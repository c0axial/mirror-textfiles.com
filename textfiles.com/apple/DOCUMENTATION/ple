                     LOADING/RUNNING P.L.EDITOR


IF YOU OWN AN APPLE II PLUS SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN INTEGER BASIC
FIRMWARE  CARD,  THE  PROGRAM  LINE  EDITOR  WILL  NOT BE RUN WHEN THE
SUPPLIED DISK IS BOOTED. THIS IS BECAUSE THE GREETING  PROGRAM  IS  AN
INTEGER BASIC PROGRAM.  SO, THE FOLLOWING STEPS MUST BE TAKEN IN ORDER
TO ALLOW THE PROGRAM LINE EDITOR DISK TO BOOT PROPERLY IN APPLESOFT. 


1. REMOVE THE WRITE PROTECT TABS FROM THE EDGE OF THE INCLUDED DISK. 

2. INSERT AND BOOT THE DISK. 

3. UNLOCK PROGRAM LINE EDITOR

4. UNLOCK PLE.FP

5. RENAME PROGRAM LINE EDITOR, PLE.INT

6. RENAME PLE.FP.PROGRAM LINE EDITOR

7. LOCK PROGRAM LINE EDITOR

8. LOCK PLE.INT

9. REPLACE THE WRITE PROTECT TAB. 

10. REBOOT THE DISK

AFTER  THIS IS DONE, JUST BOOT THE DISK NORMALLY. SOON, A DISK CATALOG
WILL APPEAR ,LETTING YOU KNOW THE PLE IS UP AND RUNNING. 

WHEN THE PLE HAS BEEN RUN, YOU SHOULDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT
THE OPERATION OF YOUR APPLE. IN FACT, EVERYTHING IS THE  SAME,  EXCEPT
FOR  ALL  OF  THE NEW COMMANDS AND FEATURES DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING
PAGES. 

NOTE: 
WHEN THE PLE IS UP AND RUNNING, DOS WILL SET HI-MEM:1536  BYTES  LOWER
THAN NORMAL FOR YOUR SYSTEM. 

PAGE 1

THERE  ARE  TWO  NEW  COMMANDS  ADDED  TO BASIC THAT ALLOW YOU TO EDIT
EITHER A PROGRAM LINE OR THE LAST LINE  OF  CHARACTERS  TYPED  AT  THE
KEYBOARD. THESE ARE CTRL-E (EDIT) AND CTRL-W

ENTERING EDIT MODE: 
    CTRL-E AND CTRL-W


THIS  IS  THE  COMMAND  USED  WHEN  YOU  WANT  TO  EDIT A LINE IN YOUR
PROGRAM.`TO TYPE CTRL-E, JUST PRESS THE CTRL  KEY  AND  HOLD  IT  DOWN
WHILE  YOU HIT THE E KEY. AFTER THE WORD "EDIT" APPEARS, TYPE THE LINE
NUMBER OF THE LINE YOU WANT TO EDIT. THE LINE WILL  APPEAR,  WITH  THE
CURSOR  AT  THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST STATEMENT IN THE LINE. THE LINE
EDITOR REMEMBERS THE NUMBER OF THE LAST LINE EDITED, SO, IF  YOU  WANT
TO  EDIT  THE  SAME  LINE AGAIN LATER, SIMPLY TYPE CTRL-E AND A PERIOD
(.). THIS WILL CAUSE THE LAST - EDITED LINE TO REAPPEAR. 


HERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO WATCH FOR WHEN USING  CRTL-E  TO  ENTER  EDIT
MODE: 

1. CTRL-E MUST BE THE FIRST CHARACTER TYPED ON A LINE. 

2. DON'T TRY TO EDIT LINE 0 OF AN APPLESOFT PROGRAM. 

3. CTRL-E IS DISABLED DURING INPUTS AND MONITOR. 

4.  BACKSPACING  INTO  THE WORD EDIT BEFORE TYPING THE LINE NUMBER MAY
DISABLE CTRL-R (RESTART) IN EDIT MODE. 

5. IF YOU INADVERTENTLY TYPE THE ESCAPE KEY BEFORE TYPING CTRL-E,  TWO
WARNING  BELLS  WILL SOUND AND YOU WILL NOT ENTER EDIT MODE. IF A LINE
NUMBER IS TYPED AFTER THE WARNING BELL, HITTING RETURN MAY DELETE  THE
LINE. 

6.  IF  A  LINE  IS LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM BASIC LINE LENGTH (128 FOR
INTEGER BASIC, 239 FOR APPLESOFT), IT WILL  BE  AUTO-PACKED,  REMOVING
ALL EXTRANEOUS SPACES FROM THE LINE. 



CTRL-W
THIS IS THE COMMAND TO USE WHEN YOU HAVE TYPED A LINE IN INTEGER BASIC
AND  RECEIVED A ***SYNTAX ERROR MESSAGE, JUST TYPE CTRL-W AND THE LINE
WILL INSTANTLY REAPPEAR. CTRL-W  WORKS  DURING  INPUTS,  AND  IT  WILL
RECOVER  AND  RE-EXECUTE  IMMEDIATE COMMANDS. THIS COMMAND CAN ALSO BE
USED TO RECOVER LINES CANCELED WITH CTRL-X. CTRL-W ACTUALLY WORKS  TWO
WAYS,  DEPENDING  ON  WHEN  IT  IS  TYPED. IF IT IS TYPED AS THE FIRST
CHARACTER ON A LINE, IT WILL  CAUSE  THE  LAST  LINE  TYPED  FROM  THE
KEYBOARD  TO  REAPPEAR.  IF  IT IS TYPED WHILE ENTERING A LINE, CTRL-W
RETYPES THE LINE AND ENTERS EDIT MODE. 

HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO BE CAREFUL OF WHEN USING CTRL-W: 

1. CTRL-W DOES NOT WORK WHEN ENTERED AS  THE  FIRST  CHARACTER  OF  AN
APPLESOFT LINE. 

2.  VERY  LONG  LINES  MAY  BE  AUTO-PACKED,  REMOVING  ALL EXTRANEOUS
SPACES. 


      EDIT MODE:CONTROL COMMANDS


ALL OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY AFTER  ENTERING  EDIT
MODE AS DESCRIBED. CONTROL CHARACTERS IN THE EDITED LINE ARE DISPLAYED
IN  INVERSE  VIDEO DURING EDIT MODE. A WARNING BELL WILL SOUND IF YOUR
LINE HAS REACHED THE MAXIMUM BASIC LINE LENGTH (128 FOR INTEGER BASIC,
239 LINES FOR APPLESOFT). 

NOTICE THE FIRST CHARACTER OF EACH COMMAND'S NAME IS THE SAME  AS  (OR
SOUNDS LIKE) THE COMMAND ITSELF. THIS IS AN EASY WAY TO REMEMBER THESE
COMMANDS. 


          EDIT MODE COMMANDS


CTRL-I
INSERT  -THIS  COMMAND  ALLOWS  YOU TO INSERT CHARACTER INTO THE LINE.
NON-CONTROL CHARACTERS TYPED AFTER A CTRL-I WILL BE INSERTED IN  FRONT
OF  THE CURSOR, AND THE REST OF THE LINE WILL SPREAD TO MAKE ROOM. ALL
FOLLOWING CHARACTERS TYPED WILL BE INSERTED UNTIL A CONTROL  CHARACTER
IS  TYPED  (SUCH  AS  <-,->, OR ANOTHER EDIT MODE COMMAND).  TO INSERT
CONTROL CHARACTERS, SEE OVERRIDE. 


CTRL-D
DELETE -TO DELETE THE CHARACTER UNDER THE CURSOR FROM THE  LINE,  TYPE
CTRL-D.  THE  CHARACTER  WILL DISAPPEAR, AND THE REST OF THE LINE WILL
MOVE IN AND FILL UP THE SPACE CREATED. IF YOU DELETE TOO MUCH, YOU CAN
RECOVER THE LINE WITH RESTART

CTRL-F
FIND -FOLLOWED BY A CHARACTER TYPED N TIMES, FIND WILL MOVE THE CURSOR
TO THE NTH OCCURRENCE OF THE CHARACTER IN THE LINE.  FOR  EXAMPLE,  TO
POSITION THE CURSOR ON THE THIRD COLON (:) IN A LINE, TYPE CTRL-F :::.
NOTICE  THAT YOU ONLY NEED TYPE CTRL-F ONCE.  TYPE ANY OTHER CHARACTER
TO TERMINATE FIND

CTRL-Z
ZAP - THIS FUNCTION DELETES ALL CHARACTERS UP TO A SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
A CTRL-Z FOLLOWED BY  A  CHARACTER  TYPED  N  TIMES  WILL  DELETE  ALL
CHARACTERS  UP  TO  THE  NTH  OCCURRENCE  OF THAT CHARACTER (MUCH LIKE
FIND). FOR EXAMPLE, TO DELETE  THREE  STATEMENTS  FROM  A  LINE,  TYPE
CTRL-Z  :::.  TYPE  ANY OTHER CHARACTER TO TERMINATE ZAP. IF YOU ZAP A
LITTLE TOO FAR, YOU CAN RESTORE THE ORIGINAL LINE WITH RESTART

CTRL-0
OVERRIDE - THIS COMMAND FUNCTIONS  EXACTLY  LIKE  THE  INSERT  COMMAND
EXCEPT  THAT  THE FIRST CHARACTER INSERTED MAY BE A CONTROL CHARACTER.
AFTER THE FIRST CHARACTER HAS BEEN INSERTED, OVERRIDE BEHAVES  EXACTLY
LIKE INSERT THAT IS, INSERTION IS TERMINATED WITH A CONTROL CHARACTER.
INSERTED  CONTROL  CHARACTERS  ARE  DISPLAYED IN INVERSE VIDEO IN EDIT
MODE. YOU CAN USE OVERRIDE TO INSERT CTRL-D'S  INTO  PRINT  STATEMENTS
FOR DOS COMMANDS. YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH OTHER CONTROL
CHARACTERS  SUCH  AS  THE  FOUR  PROGRAMMABLE CURSOR CHARACTERS (CTRL-
H,I,J,K), BACKSPACES, AND CARRIAGE RETURNS. 

CTRL-R
RESTART- THE RESTART COMMAND IS USED TO  RE-EDIT  THE  ORIGINAL  LINE,
REGARDLESS  OF  ANY  CHANGES  OR DELETIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE MADE (A LIFE
SAVER).  RESTART DOES NOT  WORK  IF  YOU  ENTERED  EDIT  MODE  WITH  A
CTRL-W. 

CTRL-P
PACK-THE PACK COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO REMOVE EXTRANEOUS SPACES IN EDITED
LINES  THAT  WOULD  OTHERWISE  CAUSE A *** TOO LONG ERROR. CTRL-P WILL
RETYPE A LINE

WITH ALL SPACES REMOVED EXCEPT THOSE WITHIN QUOTES. PACK CAN  ALSO  BE
USED WHEN YOU HEAR THE BELL WARNING YOU THAT YOUR LINE IS TOO LONG. TO
PROTECT  REMARK  LINES  FROM  BEING PACKED, ENTER A QUOTE AS THE FIRST
CHARACTER OF THE REMARK. 

CTRL-C
CONVERT - THE CONVERT COMMAND IS USED TO QUICKLY  CONVERT  UPPER  CASE
TEXT TO LOWER CASE, OR VICE VERSA. CTRL-C CONVERTS THE CHARACTER UNDER
THE  CURSOR  TO  THE CURRENT CASE SET BY THE CTRL-A/CTRL-S UPPER-LOWER
SHIFT LOCK, AND ADVANCES THE CURSOR. 

CTRL-B
BEGIN - THIS COMMAND MOVES THE CURSOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LINE. IT
IS USEFUL FOR REPOSITIONING THE CURSOR BEFORE USING THE FIND  COMMAND,
AND FOR RENUMBERING LINES. 

CTRL-N
END - THIS COMMAND MOVES THE CURSOR TO THE END OF THE LINE.CTRL-Q QUIT
-  THE  QUIT  COMMAND DELETES TO THE END OF THE LINE STARTING FROM THE
CURSOR POSITION AND EXITS EDIT MODE. THE LINE IS  ENTERED  UP  TO  THE
CURSOR POSITION. 

CTRL-M
RETURN  -  TYPING  A  CARRIAGE RETURN WILL EXIT EDIT MODE AND SAVE THE
LINE EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS ON THE SCREEN THIS  IS  THE  USUAL  WAY  OF
LEAVING EDIT MODE. 

CTRL-X
CANCEL - CTRL-X IS USED TO CANCEL THE LINE BEING EDITED, AND EXIT EDIT
MODE. A LINE CANCELLED WITH CTRL-X CAN BE RECOVERED WITH CTRL-W. 

<-,->
THE  BACKWARD  AND  FORWARD  ARROW KEYS WORK JUST AS THEY NORMALLY DO,
MOVING THE CURSOR BACKWARD  OR  FORWARD  ONE  SPACE.  THESE  ARE  ALSO
INVOKED WITH CTRL-H AND CTRL-U, RESPECTIVELY. 

CTRL-A, CTRL-S
THE  UPPER  AND  LOWER  CASE  SHIFT  LOCK KEYS ALSO WORK IN EDIT MODE.
CTRL-A IS UPPER SHIFT LOCK, AND CTRL-S IS THE LOWER SHIFT  LOCK.  (SEE
CONVERT)

STOP LIST ESC OR
CTRL-S
TEMPORARILY  STOP,I.E.   PROGRAM  LISTINGS  OR  CATALOG, HIT CTRL-S OR
ESC.  EXIT COMMAND, HIT ANY KEY. 

CANCEL LIST
CTRL-C
TO TERMINATE LISTING ENTIRELY AND RETURN TO BASIC

FLUSH LIST
CTRL-F
TO QUICKLY SKIP THROUGH LONG LISTINGS.  TO  RESUME  OUTPUT  TO  SCREEN
CTRL-F

NOTICE: ESC AND CTRL-S: 

DURING  INPUT  BE  CAREFUL. THE ABOVE COMMANDS S, C, F, ESC, WORK ONLY
WHEN CHARACTERS ARE ACTUALLY BEING PRINTED ON THE SCREEN. 



              CURSOR CONTROL

CTRL-H  -  LEFT
CTRL-I  -  RIGHT
CTRL-J  -  DOWN
CTRL-K  -  UP

THESE CHARACTER ALLOW YOU TO CONTROL THE POSITION OF THE  CURSOR  FROM
WITHIN PRINT, REM, OR INPUT STATEMENTS. 

EXAMPLE: 
A  PRINT  STATEMENT  WITH  AN  ASTERISK  FOLLOWED BY FIVE CTRL-K'S AND
ANOTHER ASTERISK WILL PRINT AN ASTERISK ONE SPACE AHEAD AND FOUR LINES
ABOVE THE OTHER. 


ESCAPE FUNCTIONS

NOTE: 
THE ESCAPE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE DURING EDIT MODE! 


ESC @, A-G
THESE ARE NORMAL APPLE ESCAPE COMMANDS. THEY WORK AS IS IN MANUAL. 

ESC P
TYPING ESC-P/ SAME AS ESC SHIFT-P, EXCEPT DON'T USE SHIFT KEY. 

ESC I, HJ, K, M
SIMULATE AUTOSTART ROM ESCAPE EDITING. SAME AS ESC A, B, C, D. 

ESC T
THIS TYPES TEXT AND RETURN,  AND  THEN  POKE  -16300,0  RETURN,  WHICH
RETURNS YOU TO TEXT PAGE 1. 

ESC L
TYPE LIST AND A CARRIAGE RETURN. 

ESC O AUTOMATICALLY TYPES CALL-936

ESC 1,2 ESC 1 WILL CATALOG THE DISK IN DRIVE 1

ESC 2 WILL CATALOG THE DISK IN DRIVE 2

ESC / USE IN PLACE OF WORD PRINT


ESC:  THIS  DOES  A  CALL-151  NOTE THAT A ":" IS A LOWER CASE "*" THE
MONITOR PROMPT CHARACTER.WHEN EXECUTED ALL THAT IS SEEN IS "MON"

ESC <- -> PERFORMS EIGHT <- AND ->.  TYPING ESC ->->->->->  WILL  COPY
AN  ENTIRE  LINE  FROM  THE  APPLE  SCREEN  WHILE  ESC <- <- WILL FAST
BACKSPACE SIXTEEN TIMES. 

ESC Q
THIS FUNCTION WILL BRING THE VALUE OF THE CONTENTS OF ANY  TWO  MEMORY
LOCATIONS.  TO  USE,  YOU  MUST  FIRST SET THE VARIABLE A EQUAL TO THE
ADDRESS OF THE LOCATION OF THE TWO-BYTE  NUMBER.   (THIS  IS  DONE  BY
TYPING A=N, WHERE N IS AN INTEGER) NEXT JUST TYPE ESC Q. THIS FUNCTION
IS  ROUGHLY  EQUIVALENT  TO  PRINT PEEK (A) + PEEK (A+1) * 256, EXCEPT
THAT VALUES GREATER THAT 32767 ARE PRINTED AS  NEGATIVE  NUMBERS.   IN
INTEGER  BASIC SETTING A=74 WILL PRINT THE CURRENT VALUE OF LOMEM: AND
A=76 WILL PRINT THE ADDRESS OF HIMEM: IN APPLESOFT USE A=105 AND  A=73
RESPECTIVELY, TO PRINT THE VALUE OF LOMEM: AND HIMEM: THIS FUNCTION IS
NOT PRINTED ON THE SCREEN DURING EXECUTION. 

ESC W
WILL  CALCULATE  THE  START  ADDRESS  AND  LENGTH OF THE MOST RECENTLY
BLOADED DISK FILE ON 48K SYSTEM.  YOU MUST CHANGE THE CONSTANTS WITHIN
THE FUNCTION WITH THE ESC CREATE PROGRAMS  FOR  USE  WITH  OTHER  SIZE
SYSTEMS. 

ESC !-% -ESC SHIFT 1 THRU ESC SHIFT 5
MAKE  AVAILABLE THE FIVE CHARACTERS THAT ARE NOT NORMALLY AVAILABLE ON
THE APPLE KEYBOARD: THE RIGHT BRACKET, THE BACKSLASH,  THE  UNDERLINE,
CTRL-/, AND CTRL

ESCAPE  FUNCTIONS  CAN  BE  USED  FOR  ANYTHI NG, REMEMBER POKES PEEKS
CALLS, TYPE RESPONSES TO INPUT, FIRE UP PRINTER DRIVER, APPEND INTEGER
BASIC. 

 ESCAPE CREATE.INT
 ESCAPE CREATE.FP

WHEN USING THE ESC CREATE PROGRAM  TO  DISPLAY  THE  ESCAPE  FUNCTIONS
YOU'VE  NOTICED THAT THE CURSOR MOVEMENT COMMANDS ESC@ @ THROUGH ESC F
ARE DEFINED IN TERMS OF THEMSELVES. 

IF YOU DON'T WANT THE TEXT OF THE ESCAPE FUNCTION TO BE  DISPLAYED  ON
THE  APPLE  SCREEN JUST INSERT (') APOSTROPHE INTO THE FUNCTION AT THE
PLACE WHERE YOU  WANT  TO  DISABLE  THE  DISPLAY  (USUALLY  THE  FIRST
CHARACTER  OF  THE FUNCTION). WHEN ENCOUNTERED, DURING EXECUTION OF AN
ESC FUNCTION, LISTING OF THE FUNCTION IS TURNED OFF  AND  (')  SKIPPED
OVER NOT ENTERED INTO THE LINE AS PART OF THE FUNCTION. 

ALSO  NOTICE ESC CTRL-E IS DEFINED AS TWO BELLS AND A CTRL-X. THIS CAN
BE A LIFE SAVER IF YOU USE ESC KEY FOR STOP LIST AND YOU  ACCIDENTALLY
HIT  THE  ESC  KEY AFTER THE LISTING HAS STOPPED. THE NEXT KEY WILL BE
PROCESSED AS AN ESCAPE FUNCTION AND  THUS  YOU  WILL  NOT  ENTER  EDIT
MODE. 

TYPE  CTRL-E TO ENTER EDIT MODE AND YOU HEAR TWO BELL, YOU KNOW TO TRY
AGAIN. 


USING PLE GREETING PROGRAM ON YOUR OWN DISK: 

A. INSERT PLE DISK AND BOOT.
B. DECIDE INTEGER BASIC OR APPLESOFT OF THE GREETING PROGRAM YOU WANT.
C. LOAD PLE
D. INSERT YOUR OWN DISK.
E. CATALOG YOUR DISK TO FIND OUT THE NAME AND FILE TYPE OF ITS EXISTING
   GREETING PROGRAM.
F. SAVE HELLO. YOU NOW HAVE REPLACED
   THE OLD GREETING PROGRAM WITH PLE


GREETING PROGRAMS:

A. LOAD PLE
B. DEL 10,30
C. ENTER YOUR PROGRAM.

INTEGER: THE LAST STATEMENTS  EXECUTED  IN  YOUR  PROGRAM  MUST  GOSUB
32767: PRINT "<CTRL-D>INT"

APPLESOFT:  THE  LAST  STATEMENT  EXECUTED  MUST  BE GOSUB 63999:PRINT
"<CTRL-D>FP"

BECAUSE THE FINAL INT AND FP IMMEDIATELY TERMINATES  THE  PROGRAM  AND
CLEARS PROGRAM MEMORY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO RUN AN OTHER PROGRAM FROM
YOUR GREETING PROGRAM. BRUN CATALOG AND EXEC ETC., ARE ALLOWED

D. INSERT YOUR OWN DISK. 

E. SAVE HELLO

IT IS POSSIBLE TO INIT A NEW DISK WITH A PLE GREETING PROGRAM. 


ENTERING BASIC FROM APPLE MONITOR

TO RETURN TO BASIC AFTER HITTING RESET OR CALL-151,TYPE CTRL-Y AND HIT
RETURN.  IF  YOU  USE  3D0G TO RE-ENTER BASIC THE PLE WILL BE DISABLED
UNTIL BASIC IS REENTERED WITH  CTRL-Y.  IF  YOU  HAVE  AUTOSTART  ROM,
HITTING  RESET  WILL ALWAYS RETURN YOU TO BASIC WITH THE EDITOR UP AND
RUNNING. 

THE PLE IS MUCH CONNECTED  TO  THE  APPLE  LIKE  A  PRINTER  OR  OTHER
PERIPHERAL.  THEREFORE  WHEN  YOU  USE  PR# IN# THE PLE IS TEMPORARILY
DISABLED AND MUST BE RECONNECTED. IN APPLESOFT CALL-1013 OR SIMPLY  AN
&  IN  YOUR  PROGRAM  OR  FROM  THE  KEYBOARD.  INTEGER DOESN'T HAVE &
STATEMENT YOU MUST USE CALL-1013 TO RECONNECT THE PLE. 


MEMORY CONFLICTS; TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER DISK

A. BLOAD REMOVE PLE
B. BSAVE REMOVE PLE,A$300,L$3A
