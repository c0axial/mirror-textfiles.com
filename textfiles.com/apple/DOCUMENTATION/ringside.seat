STARTING A GAME
---------------

WHEN  YOU  BOOT THE RINGSIDE SEAT DISK YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE FOLLOWING
OPTIONS: 

(P) PLAY A GAME (E) ENTER/REVISE/LIST FIGHTER DATA  (I)  INITIALIZE  A
DISK FOR SAVING FIGHTERS

SELECTING OPTION P WILL FIRST PROMPT YOU FOR THE MODE OF PLAY. YOU MAY
HAVE  THE  COMPUTER MANAGE EITHER, NEITHER OR BOTH BOXERS. APPLE OWNER
MAY CHOOSE EITHER THE KEYBOARD OR PADDLE INPUTS.  IF YOU HAVE SELECTED
ANY OTHER ITEM THAN DEMO MODE THE COMPUTER WILL NEXT ASK YOU TO  ENTER
THE  NAME-DIVISION  OF  THE TWO CONTESTANTS (THE NAME AND DIVISION FOR
EACH FIGHTER CAN BE FOUND BY  USING  OPTION  E).  THE  DIVISION  IS  A
TWO-LETTER  CODE REPRESENTING THE WEIGHT CLASS OF THE FIGHTER. BE SURE
TO SEPARATE THE NAME AND DIVISION OF EACH FIGHTER WITH A DASH (-). 

AS AN EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT ENTER LOUIS-HW. AFTER YOU  HAVE  SELECTED  THE
TWO  FIGHTERS YOU WILL BE ASKED TO ENTER THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS YOU WISH
FOR THE CURRENT FIGHT. ENTER A NUMBER  BETWEEN  3  AND  15  INCLUSIVE.
SHOULD  EITHER  FIGHTER HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIGHT AS EITHER A BOXER OR
SLUGGER, YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR THE STYLE YOU WISH  THE  FIGHTER  TO
USE  DURING  THIS FIGHT (ONCE A STYLE IS SELECTED IT CANNOT BE ALTERED
DURING THE FIGHT). YOU WILL THEN BE ASKED IF YOU PREFER  TO  HAVE  THE
CUMULATIVE  JUDGES'  SCORES  DISPLAYED  WHILE THE FIGHT IS IN PROGRESS
(EITHER WAY THE JUDGES' ROUND BY ROUND SCORES WILL BE GIVEN  UPON  THE
CONCLUSION OF THE FIGHT). 

PLAYING THE GAME
----------------

IN  THE  GAME,  BOTH  MANAGERS  SELECT  THEIR  FIGHTER'S STRATEGY EACH
ROUND.  ONCE A STRATEGY FOR A ROUND  IS  SELECTED,  THAT  STRATEGY  IS
EMPLOYED FOR THE ENTIRE ROUND WITH ONE EXCEPTION: 

A  FIGHTER  MAY OPT TO COVER UP DURING A ROUND IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING
KNOCKED OUT (FOLLOWING A DEVASTATING PUNCH OR A KNOCKDOWN, THE FIGHTER
BEING HIT MAY NOT  COVER  UP  UNTIL  THE  AGGRESSOR'S  "FOLLOWING  UP"
SEQUENCE  IS  COMPLETED).  IF YOU WISH TO COVER UP, AND PADDLE CONTROL
HAS BEEN REQUESTED (APPLE ONLY), PUSH THE BUTTON UNTIL  THE  COVER  UP
STRATEGY IS DISPLAYED. IF THE KEYBOARD IS BEING USED, PRESSING THE "Z"
FOR  FIGHTER  #1  OR  THE "/" FOR FIGHTER #2 WILL CAUSE THE FIGHTER TO
COVER UP. 

ONCE BOTH MANAGERS HAVE SELECTED THE STRATEGY FOR THEIR  FIGHTER,  THE
ROUND BELL WILL RING AND THE TWO FIGHTERS WILL APPROACH RING CENTER. 


THE DISPLAY
-----------

DISPLAYED  ON  THE  SCREEN  WHILE  THE  FIGHT  IS  IN PROGRESS ARE THE
FIGHTERS' NAMES, THE ROUND CLOCK, THE STRATEGY OF  EACH  FIGHTER,  THE
ROUND   NUMBER,   THE  CUMULATIVE  JUDGES'  SCORES  IF  SELECTED,  THE
PERCENTAGE OF STAMINA REMAINING, AND A REPRESENTATION  OF  THE  BOXING
RING.  THE TOP OF THE SCREEN IS USED TO ANNOUNCE THE BEGINNING OF EACH
ROUND, AND ALSO TO DESCRIBE ANY RING MOVEMENT  OF  THE  FIGHTERS.  THE
BOTTOM  HALF  IS  USED  FOR  COLOR COMMENTARY AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE
BLOW-BY-BLOW ACTION TAKING PLACE IN THE RING. 

THE SCORING SECTION, BASED ON THE  "10  POINT  MUST"  SCORING  SYSTEM,
SHOWS  THE  CUMULATIVE  ROUND-BY-ROUND SCORES BY JUDGE 1 (J1), JUDGE 2
(J2), AND JUDGE 3 (J3). THE CUT, INJURY AND  CONDITION  SECTION  SHOWS
ANY  CUTS,  INJURIES  OR  OTHER  CONDITIONS  SUSTAINED BY THE FIGHTERS
DURING THE FIGHT. THE BOXING RING DISPLAY PROVIDES A VISUAL INDICATION
OF THE POSITION OF THE FIGHTERS THROUGHOUT THE FIGHT. 

DISPLAYED ABOVE EACH FIGHTER'S NAME BEFORE THE  BOUT  BEGINS  ARE  TWO
NUMBERS  (e.g. 2/1). THE FIRST NUMBER INDICATES HIS ABILITY VS A BOXER
AND THE SECOND NUMBER INDICATES HIS ABILITY VS A SLUGGER. 

THE STRATEGY SELECTION INPUTS FOR EACH  FIGHTER  WILL  APPEAR  AT  THE
BOTTOM  OF  THE  SCREEN  AT  THE  BEGINNING OF EACH ROUND. IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWING EACH STRATEGY IS A NUMBER REPRESENTING HOW  WELL  A  FIGHTER
EMPLOYS THE PARTICULAR STRATEGY (THIS NUMBER MAY BE REDUCED AS STAMINA
IS  USED  UP,  AND  A FIGHTER BEGINS TO TIRE). SELECTING A STRATEGY BY
PADDLE IS DONE BY TURNING THE PADDLE KNOB UNTIL THE  DESIRED  STRATEGY
IS  DISPLAYED. PUSHING THE PADDLE BUTTON LOCKS IN THE CHOICE, AND THAT
IS THE STRATEGY USED DURING  THAT  ROUND.   SELECTING  A  STRATEGY  BY
KEYBOARD  IS  DONE  BY  TYPING  THE NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIRED
STRATEGY: 

1 - FLAT FOOTED

2 - COVER UP

3 - CHARGE IN

4 - STICK & MOVE

5 - STAY AWAY

6 - GO FOR KO

7 - PROTECT CUTS


PRESSING THE [RETURN] KEY WILL LOCK  IN  THE  CHOICE  AS  THE  DESIRED
STRATEGY FOR THE UPCOMING ROUND. 


STRATEGY ACTIONS
----------------

THE  FOLLOWING  IS  A  DESCRIPTION  OF  EACH  OF  THE SEVEN STRATEGIES
AVAILABLE TO EACH FIGHTER EACH ROUND. 


1 - FIGHT FLAT FOOTED

  FIGHT FLAT FOOTED ALLOWS A FIGHTER  TO  REST  DURING  A  ROUND.  HIS
ABILITY  TO CONTROL THE FIGHT, HIS AGGRESSIVENESS, AND HIS DEFENSE ALL
SUFFER AND HE BECOMES A MUCH EASIER TARGET WHILE USING THIS STRATEGY. 


2 - COVER UP

  COVER UP IS USUALLY USED AFTER SUSTAINING  CONSIDERABLE  PUNISHMENT.
THIS  IS  THE ONLY STRATEGY WHICH MAY BE CHANGED DURING THE ROUND (SEE
PLAYING THE GAME). COVER UP CONSIDERABLY REDUCES THE FIGHTER'S ABILITY
TO LAND A PUNCH AND TO CONTROL THE  ACTION.  IT  CAN  ALSO  CAUSE  THE
OPPONENT'S  PUNCHES  TO BE PARTIALLY BLOCKED. USE THIS STRATEGY IF YOU
FEAR A KNOCKOUT IS IMMINENT IN THE ROUND, OR IF YOU WANT THE  OPPONENT
TO PUNCH HIMSELF OUT. 


3 - CHARGE IN

  CHARGE  IN  IS  USUALLY  USED  IN  AN  ATTEMPT  TO  INFLICT  UNUSUAL
PUNISHMENT, AND SCORE POINTS QUICKLY. THE DEFENSE OF A  FIGHTER  USING
THIS  STRATEGY  IS  REDUCED, AND THEREFORE MAY MAKE HIM EASIER TO HIT.
ONCE CONTROL OF THE ROUND  IS  GAINED,  HOWEVER,  IT  IS  MORE  EASILY
MAINTAINED.  USE  THIS  STRATEGY EARLY IN A FIGHT TO WEAR THE OPPONENT
DOWN. IT IS ALSO SOMETIMES USED IN LATE ROUNDS IN ORDER  TO  CATCH  UP
AND  WIN  A  CLOSE DECISION. A FIGHTER MAY NOT USE THIS STRATEGY IF HE
HAS NO STAMINA REMAINING. THIS STRATEGY MAY NOT BE USED MORE THAN FOUR
ROUNDS IN SUCCESSION. ONCE A DIFFERENT STRATEGY HAS BEEN USED  FOR  AN
ENTIRE  ROUND, YOU MAY AGAIN USE "CHARGE IN" FOUR MORE TIMES IN A ROW.
NOTE THAT USING "COVER UP" WHILE A  ROUND  IS  IN  PROGRESS  DOES  NOT
SATISFY  THE  CONDITION  THAT  ALLOWS THE USE OF "CHARGE IN" FOUR MORE
TIMES. 


4 - STICK & MOVE

  STICK & MOVE IS USED WHEN TRYING TO MAINTAIN RING GENERALSHIP, WHILE
AT THE SAME TIME AVOIDING THE OPPONENT'S POWER AND REDUCING HIS CHANCE
TO SCORE. THIS ADDED DEFENSE IS ATTAINED AT THE  EXPENSE  OF  PUNCHING
POWER.  USE  THIS  STRATEGY  EARLY  IN A FIGHT TO AVOID THE OPPONENT'S
POWER WHILE HE IS WELL RESTED, OR AFTER A ROUND IN WHICH YOU  SUFFERED
MODERATE PUNISHMENT. THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO RECOUP SOME STRENGTH WHILE
NOT LOSING MUCH CONTROL. A FIGHTER MAY NOT USE THIS STRATEGY IF HE HAS
NO  STAMINA  REMAINING.  THIS  STRATEGY MAY NOT BE USED MORE THAN FOUR
TIMES IN SUCCESSION (REFER TO "CHARGE IN" FOR  RESTRICTIONS  REGARDING
THIS RULE). 


5 - STAY AWAY

  STAY  AWAY USUALLY IS USED WHEN ULTIMATE DEFENSE OR COUNTER-PUNCHING
IS DESIRED. THIS STRATEGY CAUSES THE FIGHTER'S PUNCHES  TO  LAND  WITH
MUCH LESS STING, BUT IT ALSO REDUCES THE CHANCE OF BEING KNOCKED DOWN.
USE  THIS  STRATEGY  AFTER  A  PUNISHING ROUND NOT QUITE BAD ENOUGH TO
DICTATE COVERING UP. ALSO USE THIS STRATEGY IN LATE  ROUNDS  WHEN  YOU
ARE WAY AHEAD IN POINTS. 


6 - GO FOR THE KNOCKOUT

  GOING  FOR  THE  KNOCKOUT IS USED IN AN EFFORT TO GET THE FIGHT OVER
EARLY, OR TO PUT AWAY THE OPPONENT AFTER A GOOD  OFFENSIVE  ROUND,  OR
LATE IN THE FIGHT WHEN NO HOPE IS LEFT FOR A DECISION.  THIS STRATEGY,
WHEN  USED  EARLY,  GIVES  THE FIGHTER A MUCH GREATER CHANCE TO SCORE.
WHEN USED LATE IN A FIGHT, THE FIGHTER'S CHANCE  FOR  A  KNOCKDOWN  IS
SOMEWHAT  IMPROVED,  WHILE  AGAIN  INCREASING THE OPPONENT'S CHANCE TO
LAND A PUNCH, AND TO SCORE A KNOCKDOWN OF HIS OWN. USE  THIS  STRATEGY
EARLY,  IF  THE  FIGHTER HAS A GOOD KNOCKOUT PUNCH RATING, AND LATE TO
TRY TO SALVAGE VICTORY FROM AN OTHERWISE SURE LOSS. 


7 - PROTECT CUTS

  PROTECT CUTS IS USED WHEN TRYING TO PROTECT CUTS WHICH COULD BE  BAD
ENOUGH  TO  STOP  A FIGHT (YOU WILL HAVE TO USE YOUR JUDGEMENT ON WHEN
YOU THINK THEY ARE VERY BAD). THIS STRATEGY CAN ALSO BE  USED  TO  TRY
AND  PREVENT  CUTS  FROM  GETTING ANY WORSE. THIS STRATEGY CAUSES HEAD
BLOWS TO BE BLOCKED MORE EASILY, BUT AT THE SAME  TIME  OPENS  UP  THE
FIGHTER FOR MORE SHOTS TO THE BODY. YOU WILL ALSO LOSE SOME ABILITY TO
CONTROL THE ACTION IN THE ROUND. 


NOTES ON STRATEGIES
-------------------

REMEMBER  THAT  AS  STAMINA  DECREASES, SO DOES THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE
STRATEGIES. SOME STRATEGIES ARE NOT USABLE IF A  FIGHTER  BECOMES  TOO
TIRED.   IF  THE  FIGHTER CAN MANAGE TO REST DURING A ROUND, HE MAY BE
ABLE TO REGAIN SOME STAMINA. IF HE REGAINS ENOUGH, HE MAY ALSO  REGAIN
SOME  OF HIS ABILITY TO USE HIS STRATEGIES.  EMPLOYING A STRATEGY WHEN
THAT STRATEGY RATING IS LESS THAN 2 MAY BE MORE OF A HINDERANCE THAN A
HELP. 


SOLITAIRE PLAY
--------------

IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF AN OPPOSING MANAGER AND  NO  ONE  IS  AVAILABLE,
ANGELO,  THE  COMPUTER  BOXING MANAGER WILL BE GLAD TO COACH THE OTHER
FIGHTER. SIMPLY SELECT THE APPROPRIATE OPTION ON THE "COMPUTER CONTROL
MENU" AND THE COMPUTER WILL SET THE STRATEGIES FOR THE FIGHTER(S)  YOU
TOLD IT TO MANAGE. 


STATUS AND CONDITION
--------------------

IT  IS POSSIBLE FOR A FIGHTER TO BE CUT OR SUFFER EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT
IN A ROUND. SHOULD ONE OF THE ABOVE OCCUR, IT WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THE
SECTION DIRECTLY BELOW THE NAME OF THE FIGHTER SUSTAINING THE  CUT  OR
PUNISHMENT.  THE  ACTUAL DISPLAY OF CUT STATUS VARIES ON EACH COMPUTER
AS FOLLOWS: 


1) A CUT IS SAID TO BE BLEEDING WHEN IT IS BORDERED IN RED. 

2) A CUT IS SAID TO BE EXTRA DEEP OR WORSENED WHEN IT IS DISPLAYED  IN
INVERSE. 

3)  A  CUT  IS  SAID  TO  BE  CLOSED  WHEN  IT  IS IN NORMAL TYPE (NOT
BORDERED).

EFFECTS OF MANAGERS' DECISIONS
------------------------------

A FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATION IN THE DESIGN  OF  RINGSIDE  SEAT  WAS  TO
PERMIT  EACH  FIGHTER'S MANAGER TO BECOME INVOLVED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
IN DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME THROUGH THE DECISIONS HE MAKES.
THE EQUATIONS USED TO COMPUTE  THE  OUTCOME  PROBABILITIES  OF  ALMOST
EVERY  ACTION  MAKE  EXTENSIVE USE OF THE VARIOUS STRATEGIES WHICH ARE
UNDER THE MANAGER'S CONTROL.
