Here is a quick and dirty way to give yourself more lives in Space Ace:

1) Before booting the game, enter the monitor by typing CALL -151 from BASIC.
   Type in # and then return.  This will enable the ENTER MONITOR CDA.

2) Boot Space Ace.

3) Whenever your lives are running low, enter the control panel.  The
   ENTER MONITOR CDA should be active, so select it and you will be in the
   monitor.

4) Type in 1846:09 and then return.  Music will still be playing and interrupts
   active, so type slowly or some characters will be missed.

5) Type CTRL-Y to return to the game.


You now have 9 lives.  This process can be repeated whenever your lives starts
to get low.  DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF MORE THAN NINE LIVES!  If you attempt to do
so, the game will probably crash.  When displaying the graphics screen with
the number of lives, it tends to mess up if there are more than two digits
present.

P.S.  I realize this is not the greatest cheat, but if someone wants to look
into it further, it should not be difficult to find the code which decrements
location $1846.  However, this location is not references absolutely, so
you'd have to do some dissasembling and poking around to find the code.
