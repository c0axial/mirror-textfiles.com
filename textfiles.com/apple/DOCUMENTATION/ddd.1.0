INTRO:
-----

   'DALTON DISK DISINTEGRATER' is a new
program which compresses a whole disk
into 1,2,3 or 4 binary files maximum.
As you will see, 'D.D.D. 1.0' is much
better than disk splitter, disk rigger
and disk slicer.

   It works with ONE or TWO drives and
with an original DOS 3.3 or a modified
DOS 3.3 (like PRONTO-DOS, DIVERSI-DOS,
DAVID DOS, SUPERDOS, ZDOS, HYPERDOS,
etc.).



PACK A DISK (COMPRESS):
----------------------

   When you pack, the SOURCE disk is
the disk you want to compress and the
TARGET is an initialized disk which
will contains the compressed files.
   To compress a disk into files, BRUN
D.D.D. 1.0 and enter the number of
drives you have.  Now, choose option 1
(PACK) and enter the name of the
program you want to compress.  Before
pressing 'RETURN', insert the ORIGINAL
disk into drive 1 and an initialized
disk (TARGET disk) into drive 2 if you
have 2 drives (be sure you have enough
space on this disk).  Now press
'RETURN'.  Voila!
   If you have not enough space on your
TARGET disk, the program will stop and
write 'DISK FULL'.  Just change the
TARGET disk and put another one, then
press a key (not 'ESC'...) to complete
the compression.
   When the program has finished,
press 3 to quit, 1 to PACK or 2 to
UNPACK another disk.



UNPACK A DISK (DECOMPRESS):
--------------------------

   When you UNPACK, the SOURCE is the
disk with the compressed files and the
TARGET is the disk you want to merge
onto.
   To re-assemble (UNPACK) a disk, BRUN
D.D.D. 1.0 and enter the number of
drives you have.  Now choose option 2
(UNPACK) and enter the name of the
program you want to UNPACK.  Before
pressing 'RETURN', insert the SOURCE
disk drive 1 and the TARGET disk
(a blank disk, initialized or NOT) into
drive 2 if you have 2 drives.  Now
press 'RETURN'.  Voila!
   When the program has finished, just
press 3 to quit, 1 to PACK or 2 to
UNPACK another disk.



TECHNICAL NOTES:
----------------

-  Any time you can press 'ESC' and the
   program will restart.
-  The program is completly error
   proof.
-  Filenames can be up to 20 characters
   long.
-  When you choose the option 3:QUIT,
   you will be in Applesoft.  If you
   wish to execute the program once
   again, you must "BRUN" DALTON DISK
   DISINTEGRATER (don't make a
   'CALL XXX' because of the program's
   structure...).
-  Is is not necessary for all the
   compressed files to be present on a
   single disk when you unpack a
   program.



ADVANTAGES FOR SYSOP:
---------------------

1. Because of the algorithms used in
D.D.D. 1.0, the compression is at its
maximum, so you can put more programs
on your AE LINE or BBS'S disk(s).
2. The downloadings take less time and
it is more convenient for users to
capture program(s).



ADVANTAGES FOR USERS:
---------------------

1. Less time to wait while downloading
a disk.
2. Less interventions to the AE LINE
when you download a disk (because
there's is a maximum of 4 files).
3. For those of you who have one drive,
when you will pack or unpack a disk,
you will open and close the drive's
door (for exchange SOURCE and TARGET
disk) only a few times: 2 to 8 times
maximum (DISK SLICER: 18 times...).



COMPARAISON:
------------

   Here are some examples of the
program's efficiency with regard to
DISK SPLITTER, DISK RIGGER and DISK
SLICER.

The RATING is the percent % the program
has compressed.  For example:  If the
RATING is 25%, the program has
compressed 1/4 of the disk.  It is
impossible to obtain 100%, although
obtaining 0% RATING is likely (in this
case, no compression has been done).
Higher the rating, better the
compression...

(note: DISK RIGGER1 = DISK RIGGER 1.1   and   DISK RIGGER2 = DISK RIGGER 2.0)

DISINTEGRATER:  1 to 4 files maximum
DISK RIGGER2:   2 to 5 files
DISK SPLITTER:  4 to 8 files
DISK RIGGER1:   6 files
DISK SLICER:    9 files

=======================================



   As you can see, D.D.D. compresses a
disk extremely efficiently considering
the SIZE of the files saved on disk as
well as the NUMBER OF FILES saved.

   I have programed D.D.D. for all
AE LINES to reduce transfer time.  I
hope you like it and don't hesitate to
use it!


              HAVE PHUN!
