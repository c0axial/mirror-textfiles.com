PART III: The Game

To start up the game, boot side one of the disk.  When the  option  to
enter  "1"  or  "2" appears, type in the drive # in which the scenario
disk will be. 

A sample view of Sosaria appears.  Hit the SPACE  BAR.   you  are  now
offered three choices: 

* Return to view to see the demo again

* Organize a Party to set up the game

* Journey onward to begin/continue the adventure

Only  the  first  letter  of  any  option  need be used to select that
option. 

For now, select "O".  These are the options that you have: 

* Examine the Register Lets you see what characters are available  for
adventuring.   It dis- plays the name & class of every character.  The
first 3 letters before a character's name give  the  character's  Sex,
Race,  and  Class.   The  FOURTH  letter  states  the  health  of  the
character: G = good, P = poisoned, D  =  dead,  A  =  ashes.   If  the
character  is  already  part of a party, a diamond will appear next to
his/her/its name. 

* Create a Character This allows you to create characters as described
in Part II. 

* Form a Party Allows you to form a Party of up to four members,  from
the characters on the disk.  Use the number that you entered first for
each character to choose. 

*  Disperse  a  Party This disbands a party and returns the members to
the register. 

* Terminate a Character This clears a character permanently  from  the
register.  You would use this to make room for another char- acter, or
if the present one is a total loser. 

* Main Menu Returns you to the primary option list. 

SPECIAL NOTES
-------------

COMBAT: 
When  combat  is joined, a special combat SCREEN appears.  Each member
of the party is shown separately, as is each monster.  The  characters
can all move, fight and spell individually, in order of their order in
the  party.   Although  the  players  may  only attack horizontally or
vertically, monsters may attack on a diagonal.  You may attack from  a
distance with a bow, spell or dagger.  If you attack with a dagger, it
is  considered  thrown  if  the enemy is farther than one square away.
Experience is given to the character who strikes the fatal blow! 

CHESTS: 
When a monster group on land is de- feated, a  chest  will  always  be
left  behind.  Some will contain treasure, others will be empty.  Many
of these chests will be trapped.  Some traps  include:  Acid  (injures
the  character  opening  the chest), Poison (same), Bomb (destroys the
contents of the chest  and  hurts  the  entire  party)  and  Gas  Trap
(affects the entire party). 

DUNGEONS: 
Map  everything  in  a dungeon.  There are many secret doors.  Magical
winds may blow out your torches.  If thou walks  slowly,  glimpses  of
faint  mystic  writings  may  be noticed periodically.  There are also
many traps and pits.  If the Thief is in the front of  the  party,  he
will have an excellent chance of spotting traps before the party trips
them.  If you find a fountain, be sure to stop and drink carefully. 

TRANSPORTATION: 
Most  progress  is  on foot, although you may be able to locate or buy
horses.  To sail a ship, you may not sail against the wind. 

MOON GATES: 
Passing through a Moon Gate will teleport the party to hidden  powers.
Many  areas  are  only accessable through these gates.  The coming and
going of the Moon Gates is somehow related to the phases of  Sosaria's
twin  moons,  Trammel  and  Felucca.   The  phases  of  these moons is
indicated at the top of the screen as follows: 

0: New moon         4: Full moon
1: Crescent waxing  5: Gibbous waning
2: First quarter    6: Last quarter
3: Gibbous waning   7: Crescent waning

TOWN SHOPS:
Weapons shop: Buy/Sell weapons
The Armory:   Buy/Sell armor
The Grocery:  Buy food
Guild Shop:   Buy thieving equipment
The Pub:      Gold may loosen a tongue...
The Healers:  Restorative healing
The Stable:   Buy horses
The Oracle:   Buy knowledge & insight

SPECIAL MONSTERS: 
(There are three types of monster for each reference here, but as they
differ only in name, they are not listed.)

Thief: 
Can steal any weapon or armor that is not equipped. 

Pincher: 
Can poison

Daemon: 
Can hurl magic attacks

Dragon: 
Can attack from three spaces away, even when not in the combat mode! 

Devil: 
Can hurl poisoned magic bolts!

 water.
