PREFERENCES: 


OGRE  lets  you  customize various game features to suit your own taste,
and can be used before or during a game.  Selecting  "Preferences"  from
the  "OSI" menu will display the Preferences dialogue box. This presents
you with five options to modify. Clicking on an option will  change  it.
If  an  option  has  more than one choice, click on it unitl the desired
choice is displayed. 

The Options are: 

Sound Effects: The default is  "yes"  (meaning  sound  effects  will  be
heard).  Turning sound effects off not only makes OGRE play more quietly
(in  case someone in the house is trying to sleep) , but also causes the
program to operate a little faster. 

Reminders: During play, various dialogue boxes will appear as  reminders
that you have not performed all of the actions available to you, or that
you  are  about  to  perform  an  irrecoverable action. If, for example,
"Done" is clicked  during  the  Defender  Move  phase  and  all  of  the
defenders  that  can move have not done so, then a reminder dialogue box
appears. There is a reminder for the end of each game phase as  well  as
areminders  for  ramming  and  overrunning. The default for reminders is
"yes". 

Skip Empty Turns: There are times  when  there  is  no  possible  action
during  the  phase. If, for example, the Ogre has had all of its weapons
destroyed, then there is nothing for the Ogre  to  do  during  the  Ogre
Attack Phase. Nonetheless, the Ogre Attack Phase appears and "Done" must
be  clicked  to  go  on  to  the next phase.  These "empty" turns can be
bypassed automatically by setting  "Skip  Empty  Turns"  to  "Yes".  The
default for skipping empty turns is "No". 

Ogre  Message  Speed:  During  the  one-player  game  where  the Ogre is
controlled by the computer, various messages will appear  informing  the
player as to what the Ogre is doing. The time that these messages remain
visible  can  be  modified  with  "Ogre  Message Speed". the choices are
"low", "med", and "high". The default  is  "low".  this  option  appears
dimmed during a two player game. 

Ogre  Skill  Level: This option allows the player to modify the level of
intellegence with which the Ogre plays during the one player game.   The
levels  are  "low", "med", and "high". The default is "low". This option
appears dimmed during a two player game. 


DETERMINING COMBAT RESULTS AND THE COMBAT RESULT TABLE: 

Here is how combat results  are  determined  in  the  original  OGRE  as
designed  by Steve Jackson. The computer version of OGRE computes combat
results in the same fashion, but in a manner totally transparent to  the
player. 

In  general,  each  attack  is  resolved by comparing attack and defense
strengths of the units involved, and then rolling a  die.  specifically:
For  each  attack,  all  attack strengths involved are totaled, and then
compared with the defense strength of the target  in  ratio  form.  This
ratio  is  then rounded off in the defender's favor to one of the ratios
shown on the COMBAT RESULTS TABLE. In other words,  the  target  of  the
attack,   be  it  Ogre  or  standard  unit,  gets  the  benefit  of  the
rounding-off. Examples: 2 attack points against 1 defense point would be
a "2 to 1" attack. 2 attack points vs.  2 defense points =  1  to  1;  3
attack  points  vs.  2  defense  points  = 1 to 2; 6 attack points vs. 1
defense point = 6 to 1 (treated as 5 to 1; see the Combat Results  Table
).  Once the ratio is determined and rounded off, the attacker rolls the
die and consults the proper column of the Combat Results Table  to  find
the result. Results are applied immediately.

2) An infantry unit has its strength reduced by 1

3)  An  armor  unit is disabled. the unit can neither move nor fire next
turn. An armor unit remains disabled until the end of the  enemy's  next
Combat Phase. 

4) A disabled armor unit is destroyed if it receives a second "d" result
while disabled.
