********INTRODUCTION*********

THE STORY SO FAR ... 

*History*

During the latter part of the First Stellar Expansion, is became evident
that the technology from planets in the Home Cluster could  not  support
the ever expanding colonization effort. 

The  hyperdrive had opened an era of fast, economical travel between the
stars.  Journeys that used to consume decades could be made in a  matter
of  days.   However,  the  hyperdrive  was not without its problems. Its
unrefueled  maximum  range  was  a  major  limitation.  After  3  or   4
hyperjumps,  the  ship would be completely out of the inhabited regions,
with nowhere to refuel. Its fuel capacity was also part of  thge  second
hinderance:  the so-called "Mass Limit." Stated simply, it sets a severe
limit on the maximum size of a spacecraft  that  can  enter  hyperspace.
Because  of  these  problems,  the experts were predicting an end to the
rapid expansion that had previously characterized Earth's  emergence  as
an insterstellar civilization. 

In  2105,  a  research ship traveling through the far reaches of the Tau
Ceti starsystem discovered  a  huge  alien  artifact.  Entie  scientific
communities  came  to  study  the  artifact and, several years latr, the
purpose of the great machine was discovered. It was a hyperspace boostr.
It had the capability to "push" spacecraft not  tens  but  thousands  of
light-years. Since the booster itself did not enter hyperspace, ships up
to  the  mass  limit  could  travel  a  thousand lightyears with minimal
power. 

Years of research continued. Why had the aliens abandonned the  booster?
Where  had  they  gone?   The scientists were unable to say. The booster
contained a mapping sustem depicting millions of stars, but very few  of
them had recieved any special mention. 

Finally,  the  control system was deciphered and test flights were made.
They  proved  the  machine  to  be  fully  functional  and  technician's
knowledge of the control system, adequate enough to allow regular use. 

The Second Stellar Expansion started. 

You are in a cluster of stars known as the Local Group. It is impossible
to  communicate  with Earth because travel using the booster is strictly
one-way.  Up until 40 years ago, small capsules  containing  the  latest
news  and  technical  examples  used to arrive every month from the Home
Clustedr. Then one day they stopped. There was no indication that  there
was  anything  wrong  in the Home Cluster. The ensuing panic and fear in
the Local Group nearly destroyed civilization; as it is, the LG has been
divided into two mutually hostile govenments, set on the brink  of  war.
Fortunately, 20 years ago, a second hyperspace booster was discovered at
the  planet  Diftalpa,  right  in the Local Group. The second booster is
currently being towed to Cetus Amicus,  where  is  will  be  studied  in
greater  detail. It is hoped that in the near future thre wll be two-way
communication between the Local Group and the Home Cluster ...   if  the
Local Group doesn't destroy itself first. 


*Who You Are*

The  Local  Group  has  been divided into two governments, the Federated
Worlds (FW) and the United Democratic Planets (UDP). Although trade  and
travel   continue   between   the  two  governments,  the  situation  is
deteriorating rapidly. 

Almost 8 years ago, you "retired"  from  the  Federated  Worlds  Special
Forces  (FWSF), an organization whose function is to gather intelligence
data  and  perform  covert  operations  within  the  United  Decmocratic
Planets. Now you carry the personna of a free trader from Vrommus Prime.
Your  cover  is quite airtight. Occasionally, the FWSF provides you with
money and special equipment, but only to send you out on a mission.  Not
all  of your crew is even aware that you are anything else but a trader.
So during your travels and missions, you're  ging  to  have  to  earn  a
living.

                        ******* GETTING STARTED ********
                        --------------------------------

<|  I  skipped  the  game  warranty  & repair section and the paragraphs
dealing with how to set  up  Universe  II  on  your  Macintosh,  Ibm  or
Zenith.  D.F.|>

HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL

This  manual is broken up into 8 major sections. They are: INTRODUCTION,
GETTING STARTED, PLAYING UNIVERSE II, FILE  CONTROL,  FLIGHT,  STARPORT,
DRYDOCK, and APPENDIX. 

*Introduction*  contains  the  background  history  on which the game is
based. 

*Getting Started* explains the game warranty and repair policies,<|sorry
to deprive you of that|> how to boot the program and get it  running  on
your  particular  computer, how to operate the user interface (pull down
menus, buttons, mouse, etc.), and playing tips to help  you  jump  right
into the game withut having to go through the whole manual. 

*Playing  Universe  II*  is  a guide to the way the systems on your ship
work in concert.  It  details  the  functions  of  the  various  systems
availible  for  your  spacecraft,  your  crew  and what to do with them,
insterstellar commerce, the  on-board  computer,  astrogation,  warfare,
energyd  and  time,  and  your  mission  as  a  deep-cover agent for the
Federated Worlds. 

*File Control* Explains how to create a  new  player  file,  check  yuor
disks  for  any errors, delete old player files, and save current player
files. 

*Flight* describes the workings of each of the various sections involved
in operating your spacecraft. 

*Drydock* describes all of the various services available at the orbital
drydocks, including the Labor Mart, new parts, new  supplies,  and  even
purchasing a totally new spacecraft. 

*Starport*  explains  how to use the text parser, a user interface which
allows you to: type in sentences to move about the starports, talk  with
other  characters in the game, and find special clues to help you finish
successfully. It also describes the Transaction Terminal, which  enables
you  to  buy  and  sell products, exchange ores for currency, accept and
discharge passengers, and send  your  crew  to  a  technical  school  to
increase their grade. 

*Appendix*  is  a convenient collection of tables and data neede to play
Universe II. It also includes a  glossary,  instructions  on  using  the
Universe  electronic  bulletin  board,  and an index. <| I cut the index
because  I  didn't  try  to  match  the  page  numbers  of  the   actual
documentation,  and I cut the bit about the Universe BBS because you use
have to have an account based on your purchase of the game. |>

We suggest that you  read  THE  STORY  SO  FAR  ...  and  PLAYING  TIPS.
Following  that, you should read the entirre PLAYING UNIVERSE II chapter
to understand the ideas behind each of the program sections.  Then,  you
only  need  to read the sections in FLIGHT, DRYDOCK, and STARPORT as you
need them. 

Enjoy! 



RUNNING UNIVERSE II ON YOUR COMPUTER

APPLE II

System Requirments

Apple //e with a 128K 80 column board  or  Apple  //c,  2  disk  drives,
optional Apple Mouse. 

*Starting Omnitrend's UNIVERSE II*

Universe II is distributed on five disk sides labeled A,B,C,D, and E. To
run  Universe  II,  place  disk A into drive 1 and turn on the computer.
Disk A must not be write protected. 

The  128K  80  column  board  must  be  enabled  so  that   the   double
hi-resolution  graphics  are  active. See the 80 column text card manual
for more information on enabling the double hi-resolution graphics. 

*Using the Menus With a Mouse*

If you have a mouse connected to your  computer,  you  can  use  it  for
selecting  menu  entries.  To  display  a menu, point to its name on the
white bar at the top of the screen and press the mouse button. Hold  the
button  down  and  move  the  pointer to highlight the entry you wish to
select. Once the pointer is positioned correctly, release the button. 

You may often see a window on the screen in which there will be  one  or
two  buttons.  A  button  is  a  rectangle  with  a  word  in it such as
"Continue". You may click that button by pointing to it with  the  mouse
and pressing the button. 


*Using the Menus Without a Mouse*

Too  use  the  menus  without a mouse, press the ESC (escape) key in the
upper left corner of the keyboard. This will enable you to use the arrow
keys to select the items in the menus. To move the pointer in a  certain
direction,  just  use  the  four  arrow  keys. When the item you want is
highlighted, press the RETURN key. 

You may also use the key equivalents to select menu entries in the game.
When you pull down a menu, you will see the apple character followed  by
a  letter  next  to  every  menu entry. To select an entry, press either
apple key (located on either side of the space bar) and the  letter  for
that  function.  The  apple key works in the same way that the shift key
works, so you should press the apple key first and hold  it  down  while
you  press th letter. It is not necessary to pull down a menu to use the
key equivalents. 

You may often see a window on the screen in which there will be  one  or
two  buttons.  A  button  is  a  rectangle  with  a  word  in it such as
"Continue". To press a button with the keyboard, just press the key that
corresponds to the first letter of the word in the button.  For  example
if  the work in the button is "Continue" the you may press the 'C' on te
keyboard to press it. Note that buttons override menu entries, so  if  a
menu  function's  key equivalent was "C" and the buttonn "Continue" were
on the screen, pressng "C" would "click" the button instead of selecting
the menu function. 

You may use either upper or lower case letters when using the keyboard. 

*Making Backups"

We suggest that you make backups of disk sides B,C,D, and  E.  The  disk
with  side A is copy protected, so you will neeed to... <| get a cracked
copy. (I left out the mailing instructions, etc.) For those of you  with
Unidisks, you may want to consider buying this program... |>

Omnitrend  Software  is  offering  a  free  game  update for Unidisk 3.5
owners. When your original game disks have been received, we  will  mail
you a 3.5" version of the game, which fits entirely on one disk. 

<| more mailing instructions that I left out... |>


PLAYING TIPS

These are a few playing tips to help you get started with Universe II. 

*  Check  the  vidscomm frequently. * Many of your assignments and clues
will come from listening to vidcomm  messages.  Don't  forget  that  the
government  affiliation  of  the  planet you are orbiting will determine
which vidcomm messages you receive. 

* There is a drydock nearby. * When you  are  starting  the  game,  take
advantage  of  the  drydock above Axia to obtain additional supplies and
parts. 

* There is a starport nearby. * When you are starting the game, go  down
to  the  Axia  starport and pick upsome products. Check the planet chart
and the culture chart so you will know what products to buy and where to
bring them. Hint:  Zeath is a good place to bring products from Axia. 

* Be patient. * It takes some time to become familiar with Universe II. 

* Use the Save & Continue feature. * By frequently backing up your game,
you can see  whether  a  particular  strategy  works  before  committing
yourself to it. 

*  Check your ship's status frequently. * Go into C&S every so often and
check your ship's damage levels, supplies and crew. Chances are  someone
will get a promotion. 

*  Check  if  anyone  is locked-on. * When you are orbiting a planet and
ready to send shuttles or ore-processors down to the  surface,  you  are
rather vulnerable to enemy attacks. Make sure that no one is shooting at
you before launching landers. 

*  Talk  to people. * It's a good idea to talk to everyone you meet in a
starport. 

* Check in. * Check into the FWSF headquarters on Vromus Prime every  so
often.  Admiral Bresheliah may have something important. 

*  Plan  ahead  with crew, * You may find that it will save you money to
purchase low grade crew early in the game, so that when  you  need  high
grades, you won't have to send anyone to expensive technical school. 

*  Don't  purchase  too quickly. * When you are at a starport waiting to
buy something, watch a single brand of product to get an idea of what  a
good  price is. Many times, buying the first product you see won't yield
much profit, expecially when you are paying premium price for it. 

* Check part requirments. * When purchasing a complicated system such as
an ore processor, make sure that you have  all  of  the  accesories  for
using  it  (ex.,  pilots,  marines, eneregy, resource scanner, programs,
etc.) before leaving the drydock. This will eliminate  many  unnecessary
trips. 

*  What  to  do  first.  *  When  you  begin  the  game your Agora class
spacecraft is in the Hope starsystem, but not around any  planet.  Do  a
solar  transfer  to Axia, get into a low orbit, take the orbital shuttle
down to the starport, get products and passengers for the planet  Zeath,
and then go there. From there, it's up to you!

                  **** PLAYING UNIVERSE II ****
                  -----------------------------

This  section  of  the  manual  illustrates the functions of the various
compnents (or *systems*) of a  state-of-the-art  spacecraft.  There  are
seven  different  types  of  systems. They are: Drive, Energy, Command &
Support (C&S), Scanning, Lander, Weapon, and Mining.  Notice  that  each
spacecraft  design  available to you has these seven sections in it. The
capacity of each of the  sections  determines  the  spacecraft  design's
primary  goal.  For example, ore processors and the ramscoop may only be
placed in the mining  section.  If  a  spacecraft  has  a  large  mining
section, such as the sutter, then it is primarily suited for minng. 


 SPACECRAFT SYSTEMS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All systems have several common characterisics. They are: 

*Damage Points (DP)* -
This is a measure of the abount of damage that a part can take before it
is  destroyed.  The  higher  the damage point level, the more likely the
part will survive an attack. Damaged parts can be brought back to  their
original  damage  point  level by an enginner or by the repair crew at a
drydock. 

*Size* -
The measurement of a part's bulk. The larger the part, the more room  it
will take to fit it in a section. 

*Visibility* -
The measurement of how likely a part is to be his during an attack. This
is  based  upon two factors: the part's size and the visibility modifier
of the spacecraft section the part is inside. To  calculate  the  part's
visibilitym  the  appropriate  section's visibility modifier is added to
the part's size. For example, if you have a hyperdrive of size 5  in  an
Angora  class  spacecraft,  its  visibility  wouold  be  3,  because the
visibility modifier for the drive section is -2.  This  means  that  the
drive  section  is  concealed  enough  so  that  anything  inside  of it
"appears" smaller to the outside than it really  is  and  thus  presents
less of a target. The actual visibiliy of a part may never go below 1. 

*Sophistication* -
This is the same as the sophistication of the drydock where the part was
purchased.  Only  high-grade  engineers and high sophistication drydocks
can repair the most sophisticated parts. Typically,  the  sophistication
parts are the best (and costliest). 

In addition, some systems have the following characteristics: 

*Partial operation* -
Any  system  marked  as  such  will  operate at a fraction of its normal
efficiency if damaged. The percentage of  efficiency  is  calculated  by
dividing  the  current dp level of the part by its maximum dp level. For
example, if a sub-light drive with 15 dp maximum and  500  gravities  of
acceleration  is  reduced to 11 dp, then its top acceleration is reduced
to 367 gravities (11/15 =.734  and  .734  *  500  =367).  Note:  partial
operation will affect all of a part's functions adversely. 

*Constant drain* -
If  a  system  has  the note "constant drain" in the Parts List, it will
consume power even if it has been severely  damaged,  although  it  will
stop draining if it is removed or destroyed.
