System requirements:

Airball will run on an APPLE IIgs with at least 768k and a 
color monitor. A joystick is recommended, but not 
necessary. To load the game, simply place the master disk 
in your default disk drive, then double click on the 
"AIRBALL.NODRAG" icon ( the fastest mode of play). Or 
"AIRBALL.DRAGONS (has the dragon on both sides of the screen 
but sacrifices some speed) the game will then load.


Introduction

"Now you're really in trouble" said the Evil Wizard. "I've 
warned you about trespassing in my mansion. Now, since you 
did not take heed of my warnings, I'm turning you into a 
ball of air and sending you deep into my mansion of over 250 
rooms, to search for my spellbook that may give you clues on 
how to transform yourself into a human again. It will not be 
a simple task, for you, as the ball of air, have a slow 
leak, and you'll need to jump on the air pump in some rooms 
to stay inflated. Take heed, for if you pump up too much you 
will burst! If you are lucky enough to find the spellbook in 
these rooms, you'll next have to pick up the objects I've 
left such as: crosses, tins of beans, a Buddha, a dragon 
statue, a pumpkin, a flask and even crates that you'll need 
to get over treacherous obstacles! This is your one chance 
of survival", he cackles.

"Sounds easy," you laughingly boast to the evil wizard. "Oh! 
Does it now!" He sneeres. "Well I'm also putting spikes in 
these rooms that will take your breath away, as well as 
killer pads on the floor. You have no chance for 
success...Hee! Hee!"

Playing instructions

At the start of the game you will be put on a pump. As long 
as you remain on the pump your internal pressure will 
increase. If your pressure becomes too high you will burst. 
At the bottom of the screen your pressure is represented by 
a yellow bar, pay close attention to this bar because this 
is how much air you have left until you find another pump.

Once you have acquired sufficient pressure you must search 
for the spellbook. Watch out for hidden dangers, as your 
skin is easily punctured. There are rooms that require help 
to gain access. {Hint: you need to find the flashlight to 
enter the dark room.} If you are lucky enough to find the 
spellbook, return it to the starting room and follow the 
wizard's advice.
