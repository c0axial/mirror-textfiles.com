This product is "beerware". It is free, but if you really like it (I doubt
it, but), and you actually use it (I do, why not you?), I could always do
with some cash to purchase some...

Release Notes                                    GenericComm v2.03
------------------------------------------------------------------

So this is version 2.03. There will likely be a few more updates to this
program, as time sees fit. I would appreciate comments, suggestions,
directional statements (I sound like Apple, uh oh), and most of all
questions. You can reach me through one of the addresses listed at the end
of this document. I do plan to add protocol transfers, moderate GS/OS file
and terminal emulations.

At the time I write this, no one knows exactly what is happening with the
IIGS. Apple has made several statements that products and public announcements
are forthcomming, though nothing is concrete yet. Apple's new sound tools are
a hit with developers, but when will the average user get to play with them?

Will people stop buying Vulcans! They are fast hunks of metal, not unlike
the Ford Mustang which is a unsafe at any speed automobile. Believe me, SCSI
is the *ONLY* way to go. Apple will screw anyone without SCSI, trust me.

System 6? If and when.

I believe in the IIgs, it provides an excellent solution for the home user,
school and even small business's. It runs lots of software, is of excellent
quality and gets reasonable support. It is a far better solution than an
IBM compatible, and for the most part a better solution than the expensive
Macintosh's currently available.

Version History                                 GenericComm v2.03
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0 - Initial release February 10th, 1990.
Version 1.01 - Fixed OA-? bug that required the shift key to be pressed.
               Cleaned up terminal emulation problem that would cause
               line noise to make the terminal do funny things.
               Add buffering for saving sessions. Tried the ORCA/C v1.1B9
               compiler and found it quite buggy, it didn't compile this
               code correctly at all.
Version 2.00 - Add buffering and dial list editor.
Version 2.01 - Commented all source code, uncovered many small bugs, fixed.
Version 2.02 - Rewrote parts of dial list editor, using less memory.
Version 2.03 - Fixed a weird clear screen bug.

Introduction                                     GenericComm v2.03
------------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote this program with no more intention than to satisfy a computer
science project requirement. It became actually useful at one stage, and
this is that stage, so I am letting it loose on you.

The second version reflects suggestions from a few users. I would like
some more suggestions, in order to make GenericComm a staple in a 
telecommunicators diet.

Don't expect the world, ok? I didn't spend a year writing this program, and
it shows. It is a fast though, and to the point quick and dirty terminal
program for general usage. In this current version it doesn't support
things like: terminal emulations, protocol transfers, GS/OS interaction and
file control, and fancy text editors (though I have some of these planned).
But GenericComm v1.0 contains the following features:

o    65,535 line scroll back
o    65,535 line buffer ability
o    65,535 line buffer
o    255 item dialing list
o    support for 300,1200,2400,9600,19200bps operation
o    restartable and in expressload format for fast loading and re-execution

This program requires 768k and GS/OS. It should work in 512k, though no
promises!

------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation                                     GenericComm v2.03
------------------------------------------------------------------

There should be three files included in this NuFX archive.

GENCOMM.SYS16
GENCOMM.DOC
GENCOMM.ICONS

One file is the one your reading, the other is the actual program.

The file GENCOMM.SYS16 is a GS/OS application and can be launched from any
standard GS/OS launcher. The filetype *CAN* be changed to EXE and used from a
shell like ORCA or ProSEL's shell.

The file GENCOMM.SYS16 can reside anywhere on a valid GS/OS file storage
system and will create a file if you use the dialing directory. The file is
a standard TXT file called "DIALLIST".

The modem port settings should all be defaults except for the second and
third last selections, they must be deselected so that the check mark
doesn't appear beside them. Without this setting, there can be no
communication with the modem whatsoever.

The buffering should be enabled at any speed above 2400bps or if you wish not
loose characters as you select menus.

Function Explanations                            GenericComm v2.03
------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a list of keys and the functions they perform.


Open Apple - ?      -    HELP!

This key combination will present a summary of the commands available for
your usage within GenericComm.


Open Apple - A      -    Add a system to the dialing list

After pressing this key combination, a blank entry will be added to the
Dial List, with default entries.


Open Apple - B      -    Change the current bps connection rate

This quick menu list will allow you to change the bps rate at which your
communicating with your modem at (and ultimately the online system). It
uses the up and down arrow keys to select the bps rate, and return to
confirm it. Any other keys will abort the selection process. The current
bps rate is displayed in the bottom left corner of the normal screen.


Open Apple - D      -    Dial a system

This menu selection allows you to select a system to dial by using your up
and down arrow keys. Return will confirm your selection. The dialing list
represents the online systems added using the Open Apple - A command.
Once confirmed, a second screen, which allows you to edit or dial the item
is presented. Editing the entries is hopefully logical.


Open Apple - H      -    Hangup

This menu selection will allow you hangup from the foreign system. It will
ask you to confirm you intention. Only by pressing return when "Hangup" is
highlighted, will the program try and hangup. The hangup is performed by
dropping the DTR line to the modem. Some modems have it set so that DTR is
always held high, and as a result this command might no work with all modem
configurations. Change your modem so that the "computer controls DTR"
rather than "modem holds DTR constantly high". This will remedy any hangup
problems you may encounter.


Open Apple - Q      -    Quit

This quit command does a GS/OS quit command and will mark the GenericComm
program as restartable so that if you wished to run this program again, it
would load from memory, rather from disk. This command will confirm your
desire to leave the program.


Open Apple - R      -    Remove online system from dialing list

Removing an online system from a dialing list will delete the entry for
good and must be used with caution. No confirmation is made before deleting
an entry.


Open Apple - C      -    Turn on or off buffer capture

At first, when you select this option, you will be asked to enter a file name
to act as the text file buffer of the session. If the file already exists, you
will be asked to confirm appendage. Once the buffer is turned on, the status
line at the bottom of the screen will indicate that the buffer is on. Pressing
the Open Apple - C sequence again will turn off the buffer and save the file.

Open Apple - .      -    Quit

This quit command does a ProDos 16 level quit command and will NOT mark
GenericComm as restartable. This command can be used to quickly exit back
into the shell if the filetype has been changed to an EXE file.


Open Apple - Up Arrow -  Enter Scroll Back

By pressing the above key combination the user will enter the scroll back
mode of GenericComm. Once in this mode, the four arrow keys are valid. Left
and right arrow keys will move through the scroll back one line at a time,
while the up and down arrow keys will move through scroll back at a full
page at a time.


------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Bugs and Problems                          GenericComm v2.03
------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not know the limit of the dialing list. The limit would either be the
limit of the document structure of the 360 TextTool Kit (65000+ entries),
or the limit of the actual list structure which is 255 items I believe.

I have not tested what happens in low memory situations to the scroll back.
Results would depend on the 360 TextTool kit used and how it is coded.
The same is applicable to the buffered scroll back when turned on.

HST owners:

Because of the design of the HST in regards to error checking settings,
when entering a dialing string include the following:

&m0 for 2400 or lower bps connections
&m4 for 9600bps HST connections

Since I am using the IIgs built in firmware there are limitations,
including that of buffering. The limit on the IIgs firmware buffer is
actually quite large, but to keep the code simple at the moment, I have not
modified the internal buffer and it is left at 2048 bytes. On an HST
connection, when large amounts of text are flowing into your computer, you
will see the screen attempting to display text as fast as possible. I
guarantee this will be faster in future versions, but for now you will
loose characters after the program gets 2048 characters behind the
incomming data.

I would also like to thank Parik Rao for being a pest and saying it was too
big and how he did this in assembler and it was 4k in length using the
GS/OS console device. Parik: HA!

I would like to thank Stanley Wong for saying "heh, neat" and being so
humble about everything when he actually was quite impressed. :)
