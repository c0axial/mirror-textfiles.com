-----------------
CONNECTING ROOMS:
-----------------

The  PATHWAYS command provides the mechanism to define the connections
between the rooms in your adventure.  Up to eight connections  can  be
defined  between rooms.  The PATHWAYS command calls up one of the same
three  menus  as  the  ITEMS  command.   The  reasons  for  calling  a
particular  menu  and the basic function of the ADD, DELETE, and LEAVE
commands are the same as the ITEMS command.  The only real  difference
is the information to be recorded. 

---------
PATHWAYS:
---------

When  you  add  a  pathway, the cursor will go to the left side of the
screen under the word "PATHWAY".   For  each  connection,  a  fourteen
character  pathway can be entered to define the direction that must be
taken in order to move to the connecting room.  Some typical  examples
are: 

NORTH, SOUTHEAST, UP, FOLLOW PATH, GO DOOR, CLIMB TREE, LAUNCH BOAT


---------------------------
CONNECTING TO ANOTHER ROOM: 
---------------------------


After  you  have  edited  your pathway and hit return, the cursor will
move to the right side of the same line under the word "ROOM". 

At this point, all you have to do is enter the room number of the room
you want to connect it to.  You have just made a room connection. 

What did you say?  You don't remember the room number?  Read on. 


--------------------------
SELECTING YOUR CONNECTION: 
--------------------------


Instead of entering the room number, just press the "RETURN" key.  The
display will change to show the map grid.  The room you are  currently
editing will be shown in a different color with the cursor around it. 

Move  the  cursor,  using the normal room cursor movement commands, to
the room you wish to connect to.  The "SELECTED" area will  update  to
display  the  titles of the rooms as you move the cursor through them.
Once your cursor is properly positioned, press  the  "RETURN"  key  to
establish the connection between the rooms. 


-----------------
REVERSE PATHWAYS: 
-----------------



So  far, you have established a single direction pathway from the room
you're editing to the room you've selected.   Since  most  connections
run  both  ways,  when  a  room  is initially added, you are given the
opportunity to establish the other connection.  This  feature  is  not
implemented for the edit command. 

After  you  have  defined  the connection, you will return to the room
editing display.  The second line from the  bottom  will  display  the
question: 

REVERSE PATHWAY? 

If  you  hit  "RETURN", a single direction pathway will be established
from the current room to the selected room.  If you want to  define  a
two  way path later, position to the other room and define another one
way path back to the room you are now editing.  If, in response to the
question, you type in a pathway, a two way path will be defined. 

For example, you can enter a path from room 1 east to room 2.  If  you
type  "WEST" when asked for a reverse pathway, then a path exists from
room 2 west to room 1.  It should be emphasized  that  establishing  a
path  with a reverse path, is exact- ly equivalent to establishing two
one-way paths between rooms. 

--------------------
PATHWAYS TO NOWHERE: 
--------------------


If you do not know where a particular exit goes, you can enter  a  "?"
as  the  room  number.  The room title will be shown as question marks
and exit indica- tors will be printed on the map for each  pathway  to
nowhere.   You  can  enter  the  correct destination later, as you get
further along on your adventure. 

----------------------
PATHWAY ABBREVIATIONS: 
----------------------

The more common pathway directions receive special handling.  They can
be entered as abbreviations but will be  au  tomatically  expanded  to
their full form for presentation. 

The pathway entries that are recognized are: 
          
          Pathway                  Abbreviation
          -------                  ------------

          SOUTH                         S
          EAST                          E
          WEST                          W
          UP                            U
          DOWN                          D
          NORTHEAST                     NE
          NORTHWEST                     NW
          SOUTHEAST                     SE
          SOUTHWEST                     SW

Enter  some  of  the  abbreviations above as pathways to observe their
automatic expansion into their full form.

----------------------
USING YOUR DISK DRIVE:
----------------------

The data you have entered can be stored  and  retrieved  from  a  data
disk.   DO  NOT  USE  YOUR PROGRAM DISK TO STORE YOUR ADVENTURES.  The
Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper uses data disks that  are  the  same  disk
format as DOS 3.3, but organized differently.  This means that: 

1.  Any  disk  initialized with standard DOS 3.3 can be used as a data
disk. 

2. Any data previously on  the  disk  will  be  lost  when  used  with
Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper. 

3.  There  are no files on the disk that can be recognized by any file
oriented utility.  Therefore, a program  like  APPLE's  FID  will  not
operate on the data disks. 

4. Any program (such as APPLE's COPYA) that copies the entire disk can
be used to back-up your data disks. 

When  you  select  the  XTRAS command from the highest level menu, you
will be presented with the following options: 

DISK PRINT MOVE BOOT NEW RAM LEAVE

Select DISK and the screen should display a new menu: 

FILES SLOT/DRIVE INIT CATALOG LEAVE

The various menu commands are explained below. 


-----------
SLOT/DRIVE: 
-----------


Press the "S" key and you can change slot and drive numbers  that  all
other  commands  will  operate  from.  The default is set to the drive
that you booted Quick-Draw Mapper from. 


-----
INIT: 
-----


If you don't have an initialized disk, this is the  command  for  you.
This  command produces fully compatable DOS 3.3 disks.  Until you save
Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper files on it, the disk is the same as  that
produced by APPLE DOS's INIT command. 


--------
CATALOG: 
--------


A single Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper disk can hold four different data
sets.   This  command will read the disk in the current slot and drive
and display the titles of the four files.  Missing files are displayed
as blanks.  The titles are displayed under the "FILE TITLE" heading on

the screen. 


------
FILES: 
------


A disk catalog is performed and a new  menu  is  called  up  with  the
following functions: 

SAVE RESTORE PRUGE LEAVE

When  you  press  the  "S"  key  to begin the SAVE command, the disk's
catalog will will be displayed and a flashing indicator will be placed
in the left most column of the title display area.  You  can  use  the
arrow keys to position the indicator. 

If  the  position  you selected already has a file title, your current
data will be stored in that position under  the  same  name.   If  the
position  is blank, a cursor will appear next to the indicator and you
will have to enter a file title.  Make the title discriptive, since it
will be used when the maps and information summaries are printed. 

The RESTORE command lets you select a file to bring back into  memory.
If you pick an empty file, the current memory is preserved. 

The  PURGE  command erases a file on the disk, so that you can use the
space to save a different adventure under a new title.

----------------------------
PRINTING MAPS AND SUMMARIES:
----------------------------

Selecting the PRINT command from the XTRAS menu will  call  up  a  new
menu: 

ALL MAP SUMMARY CHANGED OPTIONS LEAVE

Use these commands to print maps and summaries of your adventure: 


ALL
Prints a map and summary of the current adventure.  MAP Prints the map
only. 

SUMMARY
Prints the summary only. 

CHANGED
Prints  the summary only for the rooms that have been added or changed
since the last boot, NEW command, or RESTORE command. 

OPTIONS
Sets options that control the appearance of the printed map. 


------------
MAP OPTIONS: 
------------



Selecting the OPTIONS command from  the  PRINT  menu  calls  up  still
another menu: 

NUMS TITLES BOTH SHOW OMIT 1 2 LEAVE

These  commands control the map printing options and can be set in the
configuration program: 


NUMS
Only the room numbers are printed

TITLES
Only the titles are printed

BOTH
Both the room numbers and the titles are printed

SHOW
The entry/exit path indicators, explained  below,  are  shown  on  the
map. 

OMIT
The entry/exit indicators are removed from the map

1
Prints the map in single density graphics

2
Prints  the  map  in  double  density  graphics  (not available on all
printers)


The entry/exit indicators let you see which paths  enter  and  exit  a
room. A path leaving a room has a small line drawn perpendicular to it
on  the  outside  of  the box representing the room. The line is drawn
inside the box if the path enters the room. If a path enters and exits
a room, BOTH lines are drawn. 

You should print out maps using the various combinations to  determine
your own individual preference.

------------------
REARRANGING ROOMS:
------------------

From  the  XTRAS  menu,  the  MOVE  command  will  display the current
adventure map on the screen and present one of the following menus: 

PICKUP INSERT DELETE LEAVE

            -or-

INSERT DELETE LEAVE

The first menu is presented  when  the  cursor  is  positioned  on  an
existing  room.   The  second menu, without the PICKUP command is used
when the cursor is positioned to an empty spot. 



-------
PICKUP: 
-------


The room located at the current cursor position changes  color.   Move
the  cursor  to  the  new  location for that room.  When you press the
"RETURN" key, the  room  at  the  old  position  will  disappear,  and
reappear at the current location of the cursor.  Obviously, you cannot
move a room to a location that is currently occupied by another room. 


------------------
INSERT AND DELETE: 
------------------


These  commands  allow  you to move many rooms at one time.  Selecting
one of them indicates whether you want to insert or delete  space  and
brings up the following menu: 

ROW COLUMN HORZ.  VERTICAL LEAVE

These  commands will move the existing rooms as explained below.  None
of the commands will allow you to shift rooms off  of  the  map.   You
should  practice  the  room  moving commands until you are comfortable
using them. 


---------------
INSERT DETAILS: 
---------------


ROW
Consider a square whose upper corner is the  cursor  and  whose  lower
right corner is the lower right corner of the screen.  The ROW command
will  move  that square down one row. The ROW command will not work if
the bottom row of the square contains any rooms. 

COLUMN
Consider the same square. The column command will shift it one  column
to  the  right.  It  will  not  work if the right column of the square
contains any rooms. 

HORZ. 
All rooms in the same row as the cursor that are at or to the right of
the cursor position are shifted one column to the right. There  cannot
be a room in the rightmost position of cursor row. 

VERTICAL
All  rooms at or below the cursor position that are in the same column
as the cursor are shifted down one row. There can not be a room at the
bottom of the cursor row. 


---------------
DELETE DETAILS: 
---------------


ROW
Imagine a square whose upper left corner is the cursor and whose lower

right corner is the lower right corner of the screen. The ROW  command
will  move  that  square up one row.  The ROW command will not work if
the top row of the square contains any rooms. 

COLUMN
Consider the same square as mentioned above. The COLUMN  command  will
shift  it  one column to the left. It will not work if the left column
of the square contains any rooms. 

HORZ. 
All rooms in the same row as the cursor that are at the  right  or  to
the  right  of  the  cursor  are shifted one column to the left. There
cannot be a room in the same position as the cursor. 

VERTICAL
All rooms at or below the cursor that are in the same  column  as  the
cursor  are  shifted  up  one  row. There cannot be a room in the same
position as the cursor.
