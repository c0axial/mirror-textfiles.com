About the templates

This is a complete set of templates for the Apple IIGS system software 5.0.2.
It includes templates for almost all toolbox records, GS/OS parameter blocks,
FST specific parameter blocks, and ProDOS 16 parameter blocks.  GSBug cannot
support variable length data structures, so those data structures were either
implemented partially (up to the point where the structure becomes variable
length) or were not included.


Very briefly, here's how to use the templates:

  Type "LoadTemp GSBug.Templates" to load the template file.

  Type "_name address" to view the memory starting at 'address' through the
  template specified by 'name'.


About the help templates

Help templates are included in GSBug.Templates, so you don't have to remember
what data structures are templated or how to spell the template names.  A help
template will display a list of template names for the toolset or part of the
operating system you specify.

  Type "_Templates 0" to see the names of all the toolsets and operating
  system parts.  For example, with this release, you'll see this:

        Templates

        ADB
        AppleShareFST
        Controls
        Dialogs
        Events
        Fonts
        GSOS
        HighSierraFST
        LineEdit
        Lists
        Locator
        Menus
        MiscTool
        NoteSeq
        NoteSyn
        Print
        ProDOS16
        ProDOSFST
        QDAux
        QuickDraw
        Resources
        SANE
        Sound
        StdFile
        TextEdit
        Windows


  Type "_toolSetName 0" where toolSetName is one of the names shown by
  "_Templates 0" to list the template names for that toolset or operating
  system part.  For example, to see the templates for the Print Manager,
  you'd type "_Print 0" and you'd see this:

        Print

        PrInfoRec
        PrJobRec
        PrRec
        PrStatusRec
        PrStyleRec


About template formatting characters

Several of the data structures included in this template file have
substructures imbedded in them (for example, in a GrafPort, the portInfo
field is a LocInfo structure). To highlight the substructure fields in a
structure, I've prefixed each field name with a ">" character.  For example,
here's what the GrafPort template looks like:

        _START  GrafPort
        portInfo(LocInfo)
        >portSCB    WORD
        >ptrToPixImage  LONG
        >width  WORD
        >boundsRect WORD    4
        portRect    WORD    4
        clipRgn LONG
        visRgn  LONG
        bkPat   BYTE    32
        pnLoc   WORD    2
        pnSize  WORD    2
        pnMode  WORD
        pnPat   BYTE    32
        pnMask  BYTE    8
        pnVis   WORD
        fontHandle  LONG
        fontID  LONG
        fontFlags   WORD
        txSize  WORD
        txFace  WORD
        txMode  WORD

        bgColor WORD
        picSave LONG
        rgnSave LONG
        polySave    LONG
        grafProcs   LONG
        arcRot  WORD
        userField   LONG
        sysField    LONG
        _END
