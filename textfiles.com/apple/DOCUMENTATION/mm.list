=> Well this is our first cheat, so if there is any questions please
leave us mail.  It's pretty hard to stay alive in this game but I know
this cheat will help.  To print this file out, use Apple Writer, and set
the left margin at 0.  To change the bytes use Copy II+ 7.1, the sector
editor is in the Bit Copy Section.  Well, load ( track 5, sector 0 ) of
disk #2.  The charaters start here and go on for quite a few sectors. 

=> The way to sector edit this game is very different and is hard to
explain.  But here it goes, the charaters never start at the same bytes
but there is a way to find were to start at.  Look at Example #1. 

Example #1
----------
00-  D3  C9  D2  A0  C7  D2  C1  D9  SIR GRAY \
08-  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  ........ / First 16 bytes are for names
10-  01  03  03  02  06  70  70  60  Alignment #'s must be the same.
         \    /   \    \             Level #'s must be the same. 
      alignment  class  race         Exp. #'s must not exceed (9D) on both. 

10-  01  03  03  02  06  70  70  60  Both 70's are for Intellect, must be
18-  60  50  50  40  40  30  30  20  the same number on both bytes.  Same
20-  20  10  10  03  03  14  1C  6C  with the #'s to byte (22). Those  #'s
                  \  /        \  /   are just examples of what to put.
                 level        exp.   Bytes starting at (15-22) are abilities.

28-  0C  00  00  27  00  27  00  03  Both spell point #'s must be the same.
                  \      /        \
               spell points       spell level

30-  00  21  00  2C  00  2C  00  2C  Byte (31) is gems, 21 is equal to 27 gms
38-  00  EB  02  00  01  0A  27  00  Byte (39-3A) is gold, the numbers right
          \  /            /   \      now are equal to (747 gold pieces). 
          gold   armor class   food  Armor class is explained below.  Number
                                     (27) is equal to (39 in food).

40-  01  3E  9C  B4  00  00  1A  7E  Bytes (40-46) are what is equipped.
48-  7E  A3  B0  A0  00  00  00  00  Bytes (47-4B) are what's in the backpack

=> Remember that the bytes are different for each character, for example
the characters name may start at byte (80). 

Armor Class
-----------
byte  =  Armor class
 00           0
 01           1
 02           2
 and so on...
 09           9
 0A          10
 0F          15
 1F          31
 by changing 1F to 2F will add 16 to the last number and so on...

Alignment                       Class

 02         Elf
 03         Dwarf
 04         Gnome
 05         Half-orc

Abilities
---------
Intellect are the first #'s that are the same from Example #1.
Might is next,
Personality and so on...
Endurance
Speed
Accuracy and
Luck.

For each ability both numbers must be the same.  For example a byte of
(50) would be equal to 80 on the game. 

Spell Points
------------

A byte of (27) would be equal to 39 in the game.  Must have both numbers
the same. 

Spell Level
-----------

Spell levels go to a maximum of 7.  So the byte would be (07) on both.
