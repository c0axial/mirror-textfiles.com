Mr. Fixit contains several utilities that let you identify and recover
"blown" disks without needing an intimate knowledge of Apple DOS. 

Scan utility: Identifies flawed track/sectors on disks.  Copy utility:
Ignores  flawed sectors as it copies a diskette.  Edit utility: Allows
you to change disk sectors  &  also  contains  a  disassembler.   File
restoration  utility:  Allows  you  to recover deleted files.  There's
also a Aatalog repair utility. 

BOOTING AND RUNNING
-------------------

Booting with a 16K Ram card, LanguAge card, Apple -/e: 

Mr. Fixit is loaded into the RAM card if you have a 16K  RAM  card,  a
language  card  or an Apple //e. It won't be necessary to reload after
mOst functions arE performed. At the Applesoft  prompt  type  '&'  and
RETURN to re-enter Mr.  Fixit. 

Booting without 16K RAM, Language card, Apple //e: 
-------------------------------------------------

Mr.  Fixit will be loaded into the program area. After you run a BASIC
program or perform a DOS function (if you've  overwritten  page  3  in
RAM), you'll have to reload Mr. Fixit. 

DISK SCAN UTILITY
----------------

This utility won't scan copy protected disks. 

ESC = Abort scan

The  scan  will  start with the first track and sector (T0,S0). As the
scan progresses, the current track and sector number will be dIsplayed
in hexidecimal on the  fifth  line  along  with  the  status  of  each
sector.   The  Scan will report each flawed sector on a separate line.
When the scan is completed, you can print the results  by  typing  'P'
when  the  prompt  appears.   This will print the result to a standard
Apple printer uith the card in sLot one. 

Interpreting the Scan
---------------------

TRACK/SECTOR nn/n FLAWED BUT READABLE. When you see this  message  for
any  track, your disk is still ok, but it would be wise to make a copy
of it immediately using the Mr Fixit Copy Utility. 

TRACK/SECTOR nn/n UNREADABLE. You will not be able to  copy  the  disk
with COPYA. 

The  Copy  Utility will copy the disk, but any unreadable sectors will
be filled with hex FF in the copy. 

You may choose to use either the Mr. Fixit Copy  Utility  or  the  Mr.
Fixit Edit Utility to recover a disk with unreadable sectors. The Edit
utility  will  read  some  flawed  sectors  into  memory, so if you're
familiar with what should be on the disk, you may be able  to  recover
everything. 

First  3  tracks flawed -- Systems Image Clobbered.  An easy fix is to
INIT another disk and FID your files to it. 

Track 11 Flawed - VTOC Errors.  To fix these disks,  run  the  Catalog
Repair  Utility. Before you start to fix the catalog track, you should
make a backup copy of the disk with the Copy Utility. 

THE DISK EDIT UTILITY (DEU)
---------------------------

All standard DOS 3.3, Pascal, and CP/M disks can be  edited  with  the
utility.  Most copy protected disks can't be read with DEU.  DEU works
with individual sectors. With DEU you can read a sector from the disk,
change  the sector in memory and then write the changed sector back to
a disk. The Edit utility also lets  you  "dis-assemble"  modules  into
6502 mnemonics. 

Overview of DEU:
1. Diskette Parameters Line - Shows the track, sector, slot and drive.
2. Command Line - Wher you enter your commands and change sector data one
   byte (character) at a time.
3. Sector Display Area - Where you enter your commands and change sector
   data one byte at a time.

 E   = Edit
 ESC = Return to commande mode from edit
 H   = Help
 M   = Return to main menu
 R   = Read sector
 CTRL Q = Quit Mr Fixit
 CTRL RESET = Restart DEU
 & <RETURN> = Re-enter DEU from Applesoft
 CTRL Y     = Re-enter DEU from monitor
 (These work unless you've overwritten DEU (to page 3 of RAM)

CHANGING DISKETTE PARAMETERS
----------------------------

 T      = change track # (0-22 hex)
 S      = change sector # (0-0F hex)
 D      = change drive # (1 or 2)
 CTRL S = change slot # (1-7)
 ESC    = aborts change

OPTIONS AFTER READING A SECTOR
------------------------------

 1. Change which sector is displayed
 2. Change the display to ASCII
 3. Print display
 4. Dis-assemble the Binary files
 5. Edit the sector buffer
 6. Write the edited sector buffer to a disk
 7. Copy sectors

 ->  Reads the next sector
 <-  Reads the previous sector
 .   Increases the sector # by one without doing a read
 ,   Decreases the sector # by one without doing a read

FLAWED SECTORS - SPECIAL READ (CTRL R)

If  a  sector  can't be read because it's flawed, pressing CTRL-R will
tell DEU to read the sector ignoring some of the error  checking  code
(e.g.  checksum).  If the sector isn't badly flawed it can be read and
then written back to the  diskette.  Sometimes  repeated  reads  of  a
flawed  sector  can't  get  entirely  reproducible  results. When this
happens you must use your own judgement as to what should  be  written
back to the disk. In cases of badly flawed or copy protected disks the
edit may not be able to read a sector and return an error message. 

CHANGING THE SECTOR DISPLAY TO ASCII
------------------------------------

'A'  or  CTRL  A will toggle the display between ASCII and hex format.
If your Apple can't display lower case characters, the buffer  display
area may not display the proper ASCII character. Since the Apple can't
display  inverse  lower  case  characters, erroneous characters may be
displayed in the inverse cell. Also, any ASCII character with a  value
greater than 60 hex will display improperly in the inverse cell. 

Inverse Mode for Control Characters. The ASCII format displays control
characters in the inverse mode. Negative ASCII (most significant bit =
1)  and  positive  ASCII (most significant bit = 0) characters are not
differentia- ted. This is important  since  DOS  3.3  TEXT  files  are
stored  as  negative  ASCII  characters  and  CP/M files are stored as
positive ASCII characters. 

PRINTING THE SECTOR BUFFER (CTRL P)
-----------------------------------

Printing the display screen CTRL P. The screen contents can be printed
on any standard printer configured to slot 1 by pressing  CTRL  P.  If
the  ASCII format is in effect, the control characters will be printed
as blanks, because many printers use  control  characters  to  perform
special  functions.   Printing  can  be  stopped by pressing the (ESC)
key. 

The Disk Dis-assembler
----------------------

Pressing the 'L' key dis-assembles the contents of the  sector  buffer
into 6502 mnemonics. A word of caution here. 
 Since  the  last  one  or  two  bytes  of  the  buffer may contain an
incomplete instruction, the last dis-assembled  instruc  tion  may  be
incorrect.   An  error  may  be  persent  if the last instruction is a
two-byte instruction with the second byte 00, or if it is a three byte
instruction with the third or second and third bytes 00. The check  is
to  examine  the sector buffer for the contents of the last two bytes.
The disassembler always starts the dis-assembly with the first byte in
the sector buffer.  The dis-assembly can be printed  on  any  standard
printer  configured  to  slot  1  by  pressing CTRL L. Ppinting can be
stopped by pressing the (ESC) key. 

EDITING THE BUFFER
------------------

To edit the sector buffer enter 'E' on the command  line  followed  by
the  hexidecimal  buffer  cell  # of the byte you want to change. Then
press the space bar to enter the editor. The  buffer  cell  #  may  be
omitted  in  which case 'E' followed by space bar will give you buffer
celL #00. 

The edit mode is exited by pressing the (ESC) key. The sector  display
will  still  be  on  the  screen  and  you  can  print  it  (CTRL  P),
dis-assemble it (L), copy it (CTRL C), etc. 

After entering the edit mode the selected buffer cell is displayed  in
inverse

->  Move  to next buffer cell (increases buffer cell # in command line
by 1 and display next byte in inverse mode.)

<- Move to previous buffer cell (decrease buffer  cell  #  in  command
line by 1 and display previous byte in inverse model

CHANGING A BYTE IN THE BUFFER CELL
-----------------------------------

The  current  buffer  cell is changed by enteping the new value in hex
and pressing the space bar or the arrou keys.  If  an  error  is  made
either  type  until  the correct value is displayed or erase the input
with CTRL X. 

ENTERING ASCII (TEXT) DATA
--------------------------

The edit mode permits the direct entry of  ASCII  characters.  Enclose
the  ASCII  value  you  want  in single quotes (e.g. 'B') for negative
ASCII or double qutoes  (e.g.  "B")  for  positive  ASCII.  The  first
quotation  mark  and the last quotation mark must be of the same type.
Just as with hexidecimal changes, you can change mnly  one  byte  (ole
ASCII character) of the sector buffer at a time. CTRL X and ESC CANNOT
be  entered this way - they must be entered as hex values (CTRL X will
cancel the input, ESC will exit the  edit  mode).  Double  and  single
quotation marks should be entered as hex values. 

If  you  type  the wrong ASCII value, just keep typing until the value
you want is displayed on the commanD line. 

The ASCII character is placed in the buffer aell by pressing the space
bar or either arrow key. 

Press CTRL W to write the sector buffer to the disk. Once a sector has
been altered, its original contents are lost. 

The copy function is available for systems having two  drives  in  the
same  slot.   Press CTRL C writes the contents of the sector buffer to
the same track/sector on the disk in drive 2. The sector is  increased
by one and the disk in drive 1 is read to the sector buffer. 

THE DISK COPY UTILITY
---------------------

 The  difference  between this copy program and DOS COPYA is that this
copy will attempt to copy flawed sectors, If they copy finds a  sector
it can't read, it reports an error and writes a sector of hex FF (that
is,  it  doesn't copy any- thing it can't read from the flawed sector,
it just fills the sector on the new disk with a 'code'). Because of Mr
Fixit's attempts to copy flawed disks, this  copy  takes  much  longer
than COPYA. 

The  Disk  Copy  Utility  works  on  standard  DOS 3.3, CP/M, & PASCAL
formatted disks. 

This utility doesn't support copy protected disks. It will report  all
tracks  as  unreadable  (copying  FF  to  all  sectors)  on  most copy
protected disks. 

The copy does three steps for each track.  The  line  after  the  line
labeled  "PRESS  THE  ESC", tells you which of these steps the copy is
in: 

1. Track nn Read - Reads a track from  the  disk  to  be  copied  into
memory.   2.  Formatting disk - Formats the corresponding track on the
disk receiving the copy.  3. Track nn Copied - Writes the memory  copy
of the original disk track (DRIVE 1) to the corresponding track on the
disk receiving the copy. 

If  you  have only one drive, you'll have to swap between the original
disk and the disk receiving the copy for each  track.  Mr  Fixit  will
prompt you when it needs a disk swap. So during the copy, you will see
the following series of four screens for each track: 

1.  A screen prompting you to place the original disk into the drive. 

2.   A  screen letting you know that a track from the original disk is
being copied into memory. 

3.  A screen prompting you to place the disk to receive the copy  into
the drive. 

4.   A  screen  showing  the  results  of the copy for that track.  As
screen 1 and screen 3 display, put the requested disk  in  the  drive,
and press the space barto continue the copy. 

To return to the Copy sub-menu type (ESC). 

If there's a read error during the copy it will try to read the sector
3 times using a modified RWTS. 

When  this happens one of three error messages may be displayed on the
fourth line of the screen (in place of the 'Track nn Copied'  message.
Track  nn Flawed, Reliably Read: means at least two of the three reads
were identical and the sector (as it was on the two matching reads) is
written to the receiving disk. If this error message is the only error
displayed through out the copy run, your disk should be ok. 

Track nn Flawed, Unreliably Read: none of the three reads agreed.  The
data  stored  from  the last read is written to the receiving disk. If
you receive this message only once duting the copy, the disk receiving
the copy may have some invalid data. If the disk was a  program  disk,
you  can  try to run the programs to make sure they all work properly.
If it is a data disk, you can run the programs to make sure  they  all
work  properly,  or  disply the data on the screen using ASCII mode of
the Edit utility of Mr Fixit to make sure all the data on the disk  is
correct. 

Track  nn  Flawed,  Unreadable:  This means Mr Fixit couldn't read the
sector. After three attempts, Mr Fixit stops trying to read he  sector
and writes a code (hexFF) to the sector on the receiving copy. 

FILE RESTORATION UTILITY
------------------------

Will  restore most deleted files. This utility uses only drive 1. When
you've written on a disk after a delete, this utility may not  restore
the file. There are four error messages from this utility: 

T/S list overwritten: means that the file may still be intact, but DOS
doesn't  know  where  the  file is.  It means the track/sector list no
longer has a 'pointer' to locate the file. 

File Overwritten, File not Restored

Disk Write protected

Drive Error

CATALOG REPAIR UTILITY
----------------------

The Catalog Repair Utility repairs disks with damaged catalogs to full
operation Symtoms of catalog damage include I/O errors with  executing
the  DOS  CATALOG  command  or  files  suddenly  disappearing from the
catalog listing. You get  these  errors  because  the  catalog,  which
contains  the  information DOS needs to locate and reserve sectors for
each file saved on the disk, doesn't look like DOS expected to look at
it. 

The first thing to do when a disk is  giving  I/O  ERROR  messages  or
won't  CATALOG  properly  is  to  use  the Disk Copy Utility to make a
working copy of the damaged disk. Place the working copy  in  drive  1
and select the Catalog Repair Utility

First,  the  repair utility checks the first five bytes of each of the
16 sectors on track 11 hex. These bytes must have  certain  values  on
properly  formatted  sectors. If these bytes have improper values, the
repair utility assumes the sector has been clobbered. When sector 0 is
clobbered the VTOC is damaged and a message is written to the  screen,
When  any  of  the  remaining  sectors are clobbered the directory (or
catalog) damaged and this is reported to the screen. 

If the VTOC alone is  damaged,  then  a  check  is  made  against  the
directory for saved files, and the VTOC is reconstructed. 

If   the  directory  alone  is  damaged,  the  disk  is  searched  for
track/sector lists.  The track/sector lists are  checked  against  the
VTOC  and  the  remaining  good  directory sectors. The lost files are
identified and written back to the damaged directory sector. 

If  the  VTOC  and  directory  sectors  are  damaaged,  a  search  for
track/sector  lists  is  made. The VTOC is rebuilt to show all sectors
used. All the  track  sectors  not  identifiable  with  files  on  the
undamaged  directory  sectors  are  written to the remaining directory
sectors as saved files. 

When the VTOC and catalog  are  damaged  the  Catalog  Repair  Utility
attempts  to  recover  all  files (including files which may have been
deleted and overwritten the damage  catalog  no  longer  contains  the
information  necessary  to do anything else). Also, when the damage is
this bad, somd of the file names have been lost When the file name  is
lost,  the  Catalog  Repair will give the file a 'dummy' name 'FILE n'
where n is just a sequence number.  Finally, the file type designation
is lost when the name is lost, so the type preceding the name  of  all
FILEn files is only an 'educated guess'. 

FIXING A DISK WITH VTOC AND CATALOG DAMAGE
------------------------------------------


1.  Get a catalog list with sub-menu 4

2.  Use sub-menu 3 to change file types

3.  Use sub-menu 2 to rename File n files

4.   Working  from  the  new  catalog  list, decide which files are no
longer needed and delete them. 


CATALOG THE DISK: 

Each file with the name FILE n is a file which was "lost." You  should
replace  the  File  n name with the "lost" name. Before you rename the
files, make sure the file types are correct. 

Checking the File Type Designatioin: 

The Catalog Repair Utility must look into each file with a FILE n name
to determine whether it is an A,I,B or T type file. The  correct  file
type  will  be  assigned  in  the  majority  of  cases. It's possible,
although unlikely, the Catalog Repair Utility can be fooled and assign
the wrong file type. It's for this reason that the  File  Type  Change
Utility  is provided. The utility will prompt you on how to change the
file type of a specific file. Keep changing file types until  you  get
your program to run. 

The  Catalog  Repair  Utility contains a menu for renaming files. This
program is available so you don't have to leave the utility to  rename
the  file.   Don't  attempt  to identify a file by its position in the
catalog listing. The Catalog Repair Utility often juggles the order of
the catalog listing while it's doing it's magic.
