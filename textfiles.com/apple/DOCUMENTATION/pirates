INITIAL OPPOURTUNITIES:
A NEW PLAYER SHOULD START A NEW CAREER!
START A NEW CAREER: BEGINS A COMPLETE ADVENTURE, FROM YOUR FIRST ARRIVAL IN THE NEW WORLD TO YOUR WELL-EARNED RETIREMENT.  THIS IS THE 'STANDARD GAME' AND YOU CAN CONTINUE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
CONTINUE A SAVED GAME: ALLOWS YOU TO RESUME ANY GAME IN PROGRESS.  YOU WILL NEED THE DISK UPON WHICH YOU SAVED THE GAME.  DONT INSERT THE SAVE-GAME DISK UNTIL INSTRUCTED TO!
COMMAND A FAMOUS EXPEDITION:IS A SHORT GAME WHERE YOU COMMAND JUST ONE EXPEDITION.  THESE EXPEDITIONS ARE USUALLY LARGE, BUT END WHENEVER YOU DIVIDE UP THE PLUNDER.  FAMOUS EXPEDITIONS ARE NOT FOR A NOVICE--DOING AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL MODELCAN BE A VERY CHALLENGING TASK!
FAMOUS EXPEDITIONS:YOU MUST RE-ENACT THE ORIGINAL SKILLFUL LEADERS EXPEDITIONS!

JOHN HAWKINS,1569:THIS IS FAIRLY DIFFICULT SITUATION.  YOU HAVE A LG. POWERFUL SQUADRON BUT ARE IN TOTALLY SPANISH CARIBBEAN.  THE ONLY FRIENDLY PORTS ARE TINY ANCHORAGES.  IN REALITY, HAWKINS TRIED TO BE A PEACEFUL TRADER (SOMETIMES AT GUNPOINT--A MOST PECULIAR COMBINATION), AND FAILED.  

FRANCIS DRAKE,1573:THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION.  LIKE HAWKINS, YOU ARE INTOTALLY SPANISH CARIBBEANS, BUT NOW YOU HAVE A SMALL FORCE.  IN REALITY, AFTER AFEW FALSE STARTS, DRAKE'S BOLDNESS & BRAVERY MADE HIM SUCESSFUL.

PIET HEYN,1628:THIS IS A FAIRLY EASY SITUATION.  YOU HAVE A BALANCED TASK FORCE, AND ARE ADMIRABLY POSITIONED TO INTERCEPT SPANISH TREASURE GALLEONS OFF THE HAVANA OR IN THE FLORIDA CHANNEL.  EQUALLING HEYN'S FEAT OF AMBUSHING THE ENTIRE TREASURE FLEET WILL TAKE A COMBINATION OF GOOD LUCK AND PERSISTANCE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND TIME.

L'OLLONAIS,1966:THIS IS AN EASY SITUATION.  YOU HAVE MANY POTENTIALLY FRIENDLY PORTS AND MILITARILY WEAK SPANIARDS.  HOWEVER, DUPLICATING L'OLLONAIS' ACHIEVEMENT OF CONQUERING AND PLUNDERING THE ENTIRE MARACAIBO REGION MAY PROVE TAXING.

HENRY MORGAN,1671:THIS IS A VERY EASY SITUATION.  YOU HAVE OVERWHELMING FORCERS,VARIOUS FRIENDLY BASES, AND AN ENEMY ALREADY WEAKENED BY EARLIER RAIDS.  MORGAN CAPTURED PUERTO BELLO AND SACKED PANAMA.

BARON DE POINTIS,1697:THIS IS ANOTHER EXTREMELY EASY SITUATION.  YOU HAVE POWERFUL FORCES, WHILE THE SPANISH ARE AT THEIR LOWEST MILITARILY.  IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH BOLDNESS TO DUPLICATE DE POINTIS' CAPTURE AND SACK OF CARTAGENA.

SELECTION OF AN HISTORICAL TIME PERIOD:
(A NOVICE PLAYER SHOULD ANSWER 'NO THANKS' THIS GIVE YOU THE EASIEST ERA)

THE SILVER EMPIRE:(1560)                                                        IN THIS ERA THE SPANISH EMPIRE IS AT ITS PEAK.  ALL THE COLONIES (EXCEPT ONE) ARE SPANISH, ALL THE MAJOR PORTS & TRADE ARE CONTROLLED BY SPAIN!  HOWEVER, SPAINSGAINS HAVE BEEN SO GREAT OTHER EUROPEANS ARE ATTRACTED TO STEAL AND PLUNDER WHATERVER SPAIN CANT PROTECT.  BECAUSE OF SPAIN'S GREAT POWER, THIS IS AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING ERA, AND SHOULDNT BE ATTEMPTED BY NOVICES.
MERCHANTS & SMUGGLERS:(1600)
THIS ERA IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE SILVER EMPIRE, BUT SPAIN IS SOMEWHAT WEAKER.  A FEW ABORTIVE NON-SPANISH COLONIAL VENTURES HAVE BEGUN, BUT THE CARIBBEAN REMAINSESSENTIALLY SPANISH.  ANOTHER CHANGE IS THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE DUTCH SMUGGLING TRADE. THIS SHOULDNT BE TRIED BY NOVICES!
THE NEW COLONISTS:(1620)
THIS ERA SEES THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL COLONIES FOUNDED BY THE ENEMIES OF SPAIN, WHILE THE SPANISH POWER CONTINUES TO DECLINE.  WITH THE NEW COLONIES, PROSPECTS FOR PIRACY AND PRIVATEERING ARE IMPROVED.  LIFE IS FAIRLY CHALLENGING FOR WOULD-BE PIRATES AND PRIVATEERS.
WAR FOR PROFIT:(1640)
THIS ERA IS THE HEYDAY FOR SMALL, INDEPENDENT BUCCANEERS.  THE SPANISH MILITARY AND ECONOMY ARE AT THEIR NADIR, WHILE NEW EUROPEAN COLONIES ARE BLOOMING THROUGHOUT THE ANTILLES.  THIS PERIOD IS A GOLDEN AGE(LITERALLY!)FOR THE INDEPENDENT AND RESOURCEFULL MAN.  IT'S AN ENJOYABLE ERA FOR PLAYERS OF ALL SKILL LEVELS.
THE BUCANEER HEROES:(1660)
THESE DECADES ARE THE PEAK OF SWASHBUCKLING ADVENTURE IN THE CARIBBEAN.  SPANISHWEALTH IS REAPPEARING, BUT IMPERIAL MILITARY POWER REMAINS A JOKE.  EUROPEAN COLONIES AND PORTS ABOUND, FORTUNEHUNTING SAILORS CROWD THE TAVERNS, SEARCHING FOR LUCKY CAPTIANS. THIS IS FOR ALL LEVELS!
PIRATE'S SUNSET:(1680)
THIS ERA IS THE LAST FOR THE CARIBBEAN PIRATE ADVENTURING.  EUROPEAN NATIONS NOWTAKE SERIOUSLY EVENTS IN THE CARIBBEAN.  NAVY WARSHIPS ARE ON PATROL, LETTERS OF MARQUE ARE HARDER TO FIND, GOVERNERS ARE LESS TOLERENT.  ENJOY THIS ERA WHILE YOU CAN, FOR ITS THE END OF AN AGE.  THIS IS TOUGH FOR NOVICES BUT CHALLENGING FOR OTHERS.

SELECTING NATIONALITIES:
(A NEW PLAYER SHOULD SELECET ENGLISH BUCCANEER..) THE ROLES YOU CHOOSE DETERMINES WHERE YOU START, WHAT SHIP'S YOU HAVE, THE SIZE OF YOUR CREW, YOUR INITIAL WEALTH AND REPUTATION, ETC...   YOUR INITIAL NATIONALITY DOESNT REQUIRE YOU TO SUPPORT THE NATION ( YOU CAN BE DUTCH, AND ATTACK DUTCH SHIPS...ETC...) YOUR ACTS SPAK FOR YOU!:IF YOUR DEED PLEASE A NATION, A GOVERNER MAY REWARD YOU.  IF YOU ANGER A NATION, A GOVERNER CAN ORDER HIS HARBOR FORTS TO FIRE ON YOU!!!
ENGLISH:THIS NATION SUPPORTS PRIVATEERS IN THE 16TH CENTURY, AND JUST AS GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED PRIVATE COLONIZATION VENTURES IN THE NEXT CENTURY.
FRENCH:IS SECOND FOR PIRATES, ALTHOUGH THIS NATION PROVIDES LESS SUPPORT TO ITS SONS OVERSEAS, IT ALSO GIVES THEM MORE INDEPENDENCE, MORE FREEDOM OF ACTION.  FURTHERMORE, THE GROWING 17TH CENTURY FRENCH COLONIES ON WESTERN HISPANIOLA AND TORTUGA ARE IDEAL PIRATE BASES.
DUTCH:EXCEPT IN 1620'S, THE DUTCH SAILED AS TRADERS TO THE CARIBBEAN, NOT AS WARRIORS.  OF COURSER, ONCE IN THE CARIBBEAN, MORE THAN A FEW SUPPLEMENTED THEIR TRADING WITH MORE VIOLENT AND PROFITABLE PURSUITS.  AS A RULE, DUTCH TRADERS TRIED TO STAY ON THE GOOD SIDE OF THE FRENCH & ENGLISH, ALTHOUGH THIS WASN'T ALWYAS POSSIBLE. 
SPANISH:IS THE MOST CHALLENGING.  AS A SPANISH RENEGAD YOU START IN A WEAK POSITION, ALTHOUGH IN 1680 YOU CAN PLAY THE INTERESTING ROLE OF A COSTA GUARDA--THE SPANISH CARIBBEAN COAST GUARD WHO OFTEN ACTED LIKE PIRATES THEMSELVES! IN EITHER EVENT, SPANISH ORIGIN IS A PLEASANT CHANGE AND REFRESSHINGLY CHALLENGE.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL:
(NEW PLAYERS SHOULD BE APPRENTICES)
APPRENTICE:GIVES PLAYER MAXIMUM "AID" FROM EXPERT SUBORDINATE OFFICERS ON BOARD THE SHIP.  THIS MAKES PLAY EASIER, BUT WHENEVER THE PARTY'S LOOT IS DIVIDED, ALL THESE EXPERTS TAKE RATHER LARGE SHARES, LEAVING LITTLE FOR YOU!
JOURNEYMAN:MODERATELY EASY, THE PLAYER'S SUBORDINATES ARE LESS EXPERT (ALTHOUGH STILL QUITE GOOD), BUT YOUR SHARE OF THE LOOT IS LARGER!
ADVENTURER:MODERATELY DIFFICULT.  YOUR SUBORDINATES ARE MEDIOCRE, BUT YOUR SHAREOF THE LOOT IS VERY GOOD!
SWASHBUCKLER:EXTREMELY DIFFICULT! YOUR SUBORDINATES ARE 'DRUKEN GUTTER SWINE' OF PRECIOUS LITTLE VALUE.  OF COURSE, YOUR SHARE OF THE LOOT IS THE LARGEST POSSIBLE!

SPECIAL ABILITIES:
SKILL AT FENCING:GIVES YOU WELL-TRAINED REFLEXES THAT MAKE ENEMY ACTIONS SEEM SLUGGISH IN COMPARISON.
SKILL AT NAVIGATION:MAKES TRAVEL ON THE HIGH SEAS,FASTER AND EASIER!
SKILL AT GUNNERY:AIDS YOU DURING NAVAL BATTLES, MAKING YOUR BROADSIDES MORE LIKELY TO LAND ON-TARGET. ( USEFUL FOR ALL LEVELS )
WIT AND CHARM:IS USEFUL WHEN DEALING WITH GOVERNERS AND OTHERS OF HIGH STATIONS
SKILL AT MEDICINE:HELPS YOU PRESERVE YOUR GOOD HEALTH LONGER, AND TO SUFFER LESSFROM INJURIES.  AS A RESULT YOUR CAREER LASTS LONGER.  (GREAT IF YOU WANT TO DO MORE IN YOUR NORMALLY SHORT CAREER)

WHEN DOES THE TREASURE FLEET AND SILVER TRAIN ARRIVER AT CERTAIN TIMES????
(MAKE SURE YOU PUNCH IN THE EXACT DATES WHICH ARE LISTED BELOW WHEN ASKED THE APPROPRIATE QUESTION) NOTE: IF YOU MESS UP ON THE DATE YOU WILL HAVE AN EXTREMELY TOUGHER GAME, IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TURN EVERYTHING OFF AND START OVER!!!!

NOTE:AT TIMES THE TREASURE FLEET ISNT IN THE CARIBBEAN BUT IN SEVILLE,SPAIN,PREPARING FOR ANOTHER JOURNEY.  SIMIALARILY, AT TIMES THE SILVER TRAIN IS IN PERU LOADING SILVER AND GOLD THERE!!!! IN BOTH CASES YOU CANT GET TO THEM!!YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY REAPPEAR IN THE CARRIBEAN TO PLUNDER THEM!!

FENCING & SWORDPLAY:

BASICS OF CONTROL:
YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND YOUR OPPONENT IS ON THE LEFT!
TO ATTACK:PUSH JOYSTICK LEFT,TOWARD THE ENEMY. PUSH HIGH FOR A HIGH ATTACK, HORIZONTAL FOR A MID-LEVEL ATTACK,LOW FOR A LOW ATTACK. HOLD DOWN THE TRIGGER BEFOREAND DURING THE ATTACK FOR A SLOWER BUT MORE POWERFUL SLASHING ATTACK.
TO PARRY:DONT PUSH LEFT OR RIGHT. JUST PUSH UP TO PARRY HIGH ATTACKS, LEAVE CENTERED FOR MID-LEVEL PARRYS AND PUSH DOWN TO PARRY LOW ATTACKS.
TO RETREAT:PUSH JOYSTICK RIGHT AWAY FROM ENEMY. YOU PARRY WHILE RETRREATING, AND LIKE NORMAL PARRIES, THESE CAN BE HIGH,MID,OR LOW, DEPENDING ON JOYSTICK LEVEL
(RETREAT COMPLETELY TO THE RIGHT OFF THE SCREEN TO ESCAPE A POSSIBLE DEATH. 
TO PAUSE:PRESS SPACE BAR/PRESS AGAIN TO RESUME PLAY. (THIS APPLIES EVERYWHERE)


CHOOSING YOUR WEAPON:
THE RAPIER:IS A LONG, THIN, FLEXIBLE WEAPON WITH A SHARP POINT. IT CAN BE MANEUVERED EASILY AND THRUST INTO A TARGET WITH ACCURACY.  IT HAS A LONGER REACH THAN ANY OF THE OTHER WEAPONS BUT CAUSES LESS DAMGE.
THE CUTLASS:IS A SHORT, HEAVY, CURVED CLEAVER WITH A MEAN EDGE BUT SHORT REACH. CUTLASS HITS CAN  BE DEVASTATING (TWICE AS DAMAGING AS A RAPIER) MAKING IT A POPULAR WEAPON AMONG UNTUTORED FIGHTERS.
THE LONGSWORD:IS A CLASSIC WEAPON OF MEDIUM LENGTH.  ITS ATTACKS DO MORE THAN A RAPIER BUT LESS THAN A LONGSWORD.

THE PRINCIPLES OF FENCING:
A HIT: OCCURS WHENEVER AN ATTACK CONNECTS SHOWN BY A FLASH OF BLOOD(RED) EACH HIT WEAKANS YOUR OPPONENT AND LOWERS HIS FOLLOWERS MORALS...EVENTUALLY CAUSING VICTORY WHEN THEY ALL PANIC!
RETREAT:MOVE OFF OF THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN, YOUR SAVED BUT LOSE YOUR REP!
PANIC AND SURRENDER:WHENEVER A LEADER IN PANIC IS HIT THIS OCCURS, ALSO IN LG BATTLES WHEN A LEADER'S FORCES ARE REDUCED TO ONLY ONE MAN,AND THEN HE'S HIT! 

LEADERSHIP IN BATTLE:(CAUSES OUTCOME OF BATTLES)
ONLY A FEW OF YOUR BATTLES ARE MAN TO MAN DUELS.  MOST OF THE TIME YOU'RE LEADING YOUR STALWART CREW AGAINST THE ENEMY.  AS YOU DUEL THE ENEMY LEADER, YOUR CREWMEN ARE ALSO FIGHTING.
MORALE:YOUR HITS AGAINST THE ENEMY LEADER, AND HIS AGAINST YOU, CHANGE THE MORALE OF EACH SIDE IN BATTLE.  MORALE LEVELS RUN FROM WILD(THE BEST) DOWNWARD TO STRONG,FIRM,ANGRY,SHAKEN, AND FINALLY PANIC.

INFORMATION:
PARTY STATUS:SHOWS MENS MORALE (HAPPY,PLEASED,UNHAPPY,ANGRY) WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY MUTINY CAN ERUPT. IF YOU OUT OF FOOD EXPECT DEFECTIONS.
PERSONAL STATUS:SHOWS YOUR STANDING WITH EACH NATION, AND PERSONAL DETAILS ABOUT YOUR AGE,HEALTH,WEALTH AND REP! IF YOUR HEALTH IS POOR YOU WILL BE FORCED TO RETIRE SOON!
SHIPS LOG:RECAPS YOUR ACTIVITIES!
MAPS:IS A FILE OF YOUR MAP FRAGMENTS, TO FIND BURIED TREASURE OR YOUR LONG LOST SISTERS WHEREABOUTS, YOU MUST FIND THE REMAINING FRAGMENTS TO SERCH FOR THE DESIRED GOAL, WHEN YOU DO FIND YOUR SISTER YOU WILL START LOOKING FOR THE INFAMOUS INCA TREASURE!!! YOU MUST DUEL CERTAIN SPANISH SWINES TO GET THE MAPS NEEDED, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN BUY FOR 500GP TREASURE MAPS AND THE REMAINING PIECIES IN DIFFERENT TAVERNS AT DIFFERENT PORTS.  WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE TREASURE OR SISTER IS GO TO THE ABANDONED ISLAND OR WHATEVER (THERE DOESNT HAVE TO BE A TOWN THERE) AND GO TO INFO. AND SEARCH!
CITIES:PROVIDES NECESSARY INFO. ON ALL THE CITIES, SOMETIMES YOU WILL NEED TO BUY INFO. ABOUT A PARTICULAR CITY IF YOU HAVE NO INFO. ON FILE FROM A TRAVELLER INTHE TAVERN, OR YOU CAN PERSONALLY TRAVEL THERE.
TAKE A SUN SIGHT:ALLOWS YOU TO SPEND THE DAY PLOTTING YOUR POSITION W/ THE ASTROLABE.
SEARCH: FOR SISTER OR TREASURE ON SPECIFIC ISLAND YOU ARE AT.
SAVE GAME:ONLY IN TOWNS TO SAVE GAME AND CONCLUDE AT A LATER TIME!

GETTING AROUND TOWN:
VISIT GOVERNER:HE TELLS YOU HIS NATIONS WARS WITH AND ARE ALLIED WITH. YOU MAY BMEET HIS DAUGHTER (PREETY ONES ARE HARD TO MARRY) I USUALLY TRY AND BE DUTCH AND MARRY AN UGLY GIRL WHO EACH TIME I VISIT TELLS ME WHERE THE TREASURE FLEET AND SILVER TRAIN ARE AT, CURACO IS CLOSE TO WHERE THEY USUALLY ARE. ALSO, IF YOU FIGHT SOME OF THAT CERTAIN GOVERNERS ENEMIES HE WILL REWARD YOU MONEY,LAND AND HIGHER LEVELS OF RANK.
VISIT A TAVERN: FOR LATEST NEWS AND INFO. ALSO FOR MORE MEN! OR A TREASURE MAP!
VISIT A MERCHANT:FOR REPAIRS,SELLING OF SHIPS OR BUYING AND SELLING OF GOODS.
(NOTE: HAVING DAMAGED SHIPS SLOW YOU DOWN ALSO YOU CAN ONLY CARRY UP TO 255 OF GOODS AND SUGAR AND AROUND 170 FOOD NO MATTER HOW MANY SHIPS YOU OWN!
DIVIDE UP PLUNDER:TO END GAME OR START WITA FRESH AND HAPPY CREW!
TAKING OVER ENEMY TOWNS AND REPLACING GOVERNERS!
DO THIS BY HAVING OVER 300 MEN AND ATTACK ANY ENEMY PORT BY LAND IF YOU HAVE MORE MEN THAN THEY DO YOU AUTOMATICALY SCALE THE WALLS AND ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS KILL THE ENEMY LEADER THEN CHANGE GOVERNER TO WHATEVER NATIONALITY YOU WANT!
