                                  Scenario #1

Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first Wizardry scenario and is
designed to introduce you to Wizardry, give you practice playing, and allow you
to "build" characters up to 7th level or so.

The evil wizard Werdna has stolen a valuable item from the treasure rooms of
the mad overlord Trebor. He has placed it somewhere deep in the dungeons of
Trebor's castle, and left fearsome monsters there to guard it. Your mission is
to develop characters powerful enough to explore the deeper levels of the
dungeon and recover the item.

It is rumored that a "control center" exists somewhere in the dungeon, and that
this control center allows explorers easy access to the deeper levels of the
dungeon where the item may be found. Thus a logical first step would be to find
this facility.

Good Luck, and may your Gods be with you!



                                Welcome to the
                               World of Wizardry

Wizardry is unlike any other game you have played on your Apple ][ computer.
Using all the power and sophistication of the Pascal language, we have been
able to create the most challenging fantasy war game available for any personal
computer.

Wizardry is a huge program - in fact, at 14,000 lines of code, it may be the
largest single micro-computer game ever created. The entire Wizardry game
system, including the programs used to create the extensive Wizardry databases,
comprises almost 25,000 lines of code, and is the result of over one man year
of intensive effort.

The result is a game that simply could not have been written in BASIC. Wizardry
lets you create an control a number of adventurers, who go off on expeditions
in search of loot and glory. The more successful a character or group is, the
more powerful they become. Each character is specialized. Some are good
fighters, some can cast magical spells of many types, and some are good at
defeating the many traps that guard the goodies. As a character becomes more
powerful, he may gain some general abilities, but in all cases, cooperation is
the key to success.

From one to six players can adventure at a time, with each one controlling one
or more characters. Over the course of many, many adventures, the characters
may be able to fully map out the maze and wrest from it the arcane items that
are carefully guarded in the more inaccessible depths. However, this can take
quite a lot of playing. Fortunately, additional SCENARIOS with greater perils
and rewards are available, you may explore caverns, crumbling ruins, or even
chart out the unmapped and unknown mysteries of the huge world of Wizardry.

NOTES

                            A FEW WIZARDRY FEATURES

Multi-Player:
Wizardry allows up to six characters to adventure at a time, and many more can
be stored on diskette.

Complete Castle:
All adventures start and end in the Castle. Features provided include Tavern,
Hotel, Temple, and Trading Post.

Specialized Characters:
All Wizardry characters are unique individuals. They can be of five races and
eight "classes", have differing abilities, cast spells, fight, etc.

50 Spells:
Spells are used to invoke supernatural aid. There are 50 that can be cast, and
they vary in power and effects. Certain characters can learn certain spells,
and certain magic items can also cast spells.

Hundreds of Magic Items:
Magic Items and mundane items can be bought, sold, or found in the maze. Many
cast spells, or give the user special abilities. Magic items can have over 100
different attributes, such as who can use them, who they can be used against,
who they protect the user from, and so on.

Hundreds of Monsters:
Monsters travel in groups, like characters do, and in many cases have similar
abilities, like spell casting. Monsters also guard treasures, and may be found
with other, compatible monsters. For example, a lair might contain a Frost
Dragon, 4 evil Bishops and 9 Bushwackers.

3D Maze:
The maze is displayed in 3D perspective, just as you would see it if you
actually were in a maze looking in a particular direction. Many tricks and
traps are to be found in the maze, such as Stairs, Pits, Chutes, Dark areas,
Rotating Rooms, Elevators, Teleportors, and even areas where Magic does not
work.

Special Goodies:
In certain places in the maze unusual events and objects, unique in themselves,
may be found. The adaptable nature of the database allows us to program
"Specials" which may only happen once! What they are, we aren't saying.

This manual is designed to teach you how to play Wizardry. Only rarely,
however, will we reveal information about the internal workings of the Wizardry
game system. This is in direct contrast to other game systems where all the
rules are visible. Part of the fun of Wizardry is experimenting to find out the
best methods for handling various situations.

The best way to learn how to play Wizardry is to go through the manual in order
and actually try out the options described. With this idea in mind, get out
your Wizardry diskette and we will start the game.

You will notice there are labels on both sides of the diskette. This is because
Wizardry is such a large program that we have to use both sides of the
diskette. However, you only have to flip the diskette once each time you turn
on the computer.

Place the diskette with the label marked "BOOT THIS SIDE" facing up into the
disk drive. Turn on your computer. If you have one of the older Apples without
the autostart ROM you will have to boot by entering a 6 CTRL-P or PR#6 command.
Otherwise, the disk will start and in a few seconds the Logo Page will appear.

Press RETURN to continue. You will then be presented with three options:
   S)tart the Game.
   U)tility Options.
   T)itle Page.

To select an option, press the letter of the desired option. Option T will just
replot the title page. Option S starts the game proper. Option U is used to
access two special facilities described below.

Assuming you pressed S, the disk will hunt around for a few seconds and then
you will be presented with a message that says:

                     PUT SCENARIO IN DRIVE 1, PRESS RETURN
This is when you flip the diskette. Open the drive door, take out the disk,
flip it so the label that says 'SCENARIO" is up, carefully place it back in the
disk drive, close the drive door, and press RETURN.

If this is done correctly, the disk will whirr for a few seconds and then the
"CASTLE" will appear. You are now in the game proper. If something goes wrong,
the INSERT message will be repeated.

Congratulations, you have just completed the first step towards hours, days,
months, even a lifetime of challenge and adventure!


                            SPECIAL UTILITY OPTIONS

First of all, we suggest that you read the rest of the manual before you read
this description of the utility options.

Pressing U for Utility Options presents you with a page containing five more
options:

R)ecover accidentally lost characters.
T)ransfer characters to a new scenario.
B)ackup characters.
C)hange character names.
L)eave utility options.

If something awful happens while playing a game that causes the Apple to crash,
such as a power failure, it is possible that the current party of adventure's
might be lost in the maze. Option R lets you recover these characters. Pressing
R will prompt you to flip the diskette and will then search for lost characters
and restore them. However, since it is possible to cheat by turning off the
Apple if the party is in trouble, using this option adds 10 years to the age of
any character restored by it.

After you have conquered the initial scenario you will probably want to move on
to another. Option T lets you move characters from one scenario to another. You
will be asked to flip the diskette and a list of all the characters on the
diskette will be displayed. Choose a character by pressing its letter. If it
has a password you will have to enter it. It will then be removed from that
scenario.

Next, you will be asked to put in the scenario side of another Wizardry
diskette. This done, that character will be placed on that scenario if there is
room for him and if there is not already a character of that name on that
scenario disk. If he cannot be placed then you will be asked to put the
original scenario back so that he can be restored.

Note that some powerful magic items will only work on one scenario. When you
try to move a character with these items, you will be told what they are, and
you will not be able to transfer the character. If this happens, either sell or
give away the items and then try the move again.

B)ackup characters lets you make a record of your characters status by
transferring them to any scratch disk you may have. The scratch disk must be
either a DOS 3.3 or Pascal formatted disk, and any data on it is destroyed. If
your Wizardry disk ever becomes unreadable, you can return it and the backup
for regeneration. See the inside back over of the manual for details.

C)hange character names lets you rename your character. The main use for this
option is to prevent name conflicts when transferring characters between
scenarios.

                                  GET...READY

Once you have started the game, you will be placed in the Castle, which will be
discussed later. However, if this is your first time in the game you will have
to create some characters to play with. To do this, you will need to get to the
training grounds.

One of the options in the Castle is the E)DGE OF TOWN. Press E and you will see
a list of further options, among them T)RAINING GROUNDS. Press T and you will
be taken there.

The Training Grounds allow you to create a new character and prepare him for
use. Before we go into the various options available, it is a good idea to
learn exactly what a character is.

A character is your alter-ego in the world of Wizardry. Like anyone, he has
skills, abilities, and possessions. You control him by telling the computer
what you want him or her to do. All the parameters and information about your
character is kept on the Scenario Disk until you wish to use him, and after you
finish a game, it is returned and updated. Thus, you can continue to play with
him over many sessions, and the more you play, the more capabilities he gets,
and the more challenging and interesting the game becomes.

There are six basic characteristics a character has. They are:

                                   STRENGTH
                                     I.Q.
                                     PIETY
                                   VITALITY
                                    AGILITY
                                     LUCK

Based on the 6 characteristics, your character may become one of eight classes.
Each class has certain prime requisites, or minimum scores in certain of the
characteristics for qualification. Each class also has many abilities,
advantages, and disadvantages which other classes may not have. When you are
first starting out, you will probably only be able to qualify for one of the
first four classes. Later, as you become more powerful, you may qualify for
entry into a better class. The classes are:

Fighter:
A basic man at arms. Fighters need a minimum strength of 11. Fighters have high
hit points. They can use any armor and weapons, and are very good at combat.

Mage:
The sorcerers. Mages need a minimum IQ of 11. Mages have poor hit points. They
can use only a dagger or staff as a weapon, and cannot use any armor except for
a robe! However, they can use magical spells and may be of any alignment.

Priests:
The holy men. Priests need a minimum piety of 11. Priests have hit points
almost as good as fighters, and may use any armor or shield. Priests may not
wear helmets, and must use specifically consecrated weapons such as staffs and
cudgels. Priests do not fight as well as fighters but they can throw priestly
spells. Additionally, Priests have the ability to Dispell! Some monsters in the
maze, collectively termed the "Undead" are animate only through the power of
great Evil. These monsters can sometimes be forced from the normal planes of
existence back to the abyss where they were summoned from. Priests may not be
of Neutral alignment.

Thieves:
Thieves require an agility of 11. Thieves get better hit points than mages, can
use daggers or short swords as weapons, can wear leather armor and use a
shield. Thieves are very good at circumventing the noxious traps that may be
between a party of players and some loot. Thieves may not be of Good alignment.

Bishops:
Bishops are a combination of priest and mage, and have advantages and
disadvantages of both. Bishops have hit points intermediate to both, can wear
leather armor and use priests' weapons. They use both magical and priestly
spells, although they do not learn them as fast as the other classes. While
they start learning mage spells immediately, they must reach the fourth level
of ability before priest spells and the ability to dispell becomes theirs,
Bishops also have the ability to identify the nature of magical items, thus not
requiring them to pay the hefty charge levied for that service in the castle.
However, there are some disadvantages to having a bishop inspect an item. If
the bishop is not very careful, he may touch the item by accident. This will
cause an E)QUIP to be done, and if the item is cursed, the bishop will be
forced to use it. Like priests, bishops may not be Neutral.

Samurai:
Samurai are fantastic fighters, and can use all fighter weapons and armor.
Their hit points start out better than a fighter, but in the long run a fighter
will have better hit points. At the fourth level of ability they slowly begin
to acquire magical spells. Samurai cannot be of Evil alignment.

Lords:
Lords are a combination of fighter and priest. They have the hit points and
abilities of fighters but at the fourth level of ability they gain priestly
spells, and the ability to dispell. Lords must be of Good alignment.

Ninja:
Ninja are inhuman fighting machines, They can use any weapons or armor, but
work best without any! When fighting without protection with their bare hands,
they can cause havoc and destruction, and may even kill the strongest opponent
with a single blow. Their great training gives them a lower and lower Armor
Class as they reach higher and higher levels of ability. However, they get hit
points as does a Thief and gain no spells. Finally, they must be Evil.

There are many other statistics and abilities you must be aware of. These are:

ALIGNMENT:
Alignment describes your character's outlook towards the world, and his general
ethical status. The possibilities are GOOD, NEUTRAL, or EVIL. Note that some
classes have alignment restrictions and be aware that GOOD characters will not
be allowed to adventure with EVIL characters. Thus Lords and Ninjas will never
adventure together, but a NEUTRAL Samurai could go with either. Alignment must
be chosen when a character is created and cannot be changed through any normal
process. Thus, you should be careful in choosing it.

EXPERIENCE POINTS and LEVEL OF ABILITY:
Experience points are awarded for killing monsters, each survivor gets some
experience points. When the total reaches a certain value, you attain the next
level of ability when you rest up in the next inn. The higher level you are,
the more you need to earn to get to the next level, up to level 13 when it
becomes a constant amount. The amount needed varies depending on your class.
Each time you make the next higher level, you gain more hit points, you may
gain new abilities or better old ones (like fighting ability) and you six
characteristics may change. Usually they will go up, but sometimes they will
decline. The older you are, the more chance of a decline! If you are able to
throw spells, you may learn new ones and you will probably gain the ability to
cast more of them. Since your characteristics are generally rising, you will
probably get them high enough to qualify for a better class.

AGE:
Age is simply how old you are! After 50 you start getting more and more feeble.

Gold:
The amount of gold you have to spend.

Equipment:
The items you have. These may be mundane armor and weapons, or magical items of
some sort. You can buy or sell them, trade them to others, use them, or find
them in the maze.

Armor Class:
It is a measure of how well protected you are. This measure includes armor and
other things like hinderance and AGILITY. Bare skin is AC 10. A Sherman tank is
about AC -10. The abbreviation AC is often used to denote Armor Class.

Hit Points:
The amount of damage you can sustain before death. Each time you are hurt, a
certain number of hit points are deducted. You can recover lost hit points, up
to your maximum, by resting in the castle, or by the means of magical spell,
potion or device. The abbreviation HP will often be used in place of hit
points.

Spell Books:
These are a set of small books each player has in which he records the spells
he knows.

Spells Left:
These tell you how many spells of each LEVEL OF POWER and class (magical or
priestly) you can throw. There are seven LEVELS OF POWER, and the higher the
LEVEL, the more devastatingly effective the spell is. Resting up in the Inn
will restore a player so that he can cast all the spells he is entitled to.
Thus, the smart spell caster rests up after each expedition.

Status:
This records what the player's status is. Most often he will be OK. However, he
could be ASLEEP, AFRAID, PARALYZED, POISONED, STONED, DEAD, ASHES, or LOST
FOREVER, to name a few, When a character is not ok, he can be cured either by
application of a spell or by hauling him back to the castle and paying for the
service at the temple.

There are many more characteristics which are stored but you never see. Now
that you know what a character is all about, you can start creating one. The
main page of the TRAINING GROUNDS has three options:

                         First Training Ground Option
You can type in the name of a character you know does not exist. The computer
will search for it, and when it does not find it, it will ask you if you want
to create it. Press Y to do so.

A new page will plot with various information. You will be asked for a password
for your character. Type in a short, easily remembered, word or words. As you
do, a line of X's will appear in the password area. After you press RETURN to
signal that you have entered the password, the X's will disappear and you will
be asked to type in your password again, just to make sure you did not make any
spelling errors! If you do not want to use a password, just press RETURN.
Please see inside of back cover for password deletion notice.

Next, you will be asked what race and alignment you wish to be. For each, a
list of possibilities, with a letter but each will be plotted. Press the letter
of your choice. For example, when you have the options of:

A) GOOD
B) NEUTRAL
C) EVIL

You can press A, B, or C.

Now, in the rows marked STRENGTH, etc., a series of numbers will appear. Each
row corresponds to one of your basic characteristics. STR=STRENGTH, and so on.
These numbers are the base numbers for your race in each of the statistics. You
will also see that you have some BONUS points. You can use these in any of your
characteristics to raise them. Generally, you will want to add to one of the
first four to allow you to qualify for one of the four basic classes, and use
the rest in VITALITY. You will note that an arrow "<---" is pointing to the STR
number. At this point you can:

  -Press RETURN to move the arrow down to the next number. If you go off the
   bottom, the arrow will move back to STR.

  -Press + to add a point to the current number

  -Press - to subtract a point that you had added from the current number

As you press + and -, your scores qualify you for a class, and the name of that
class will appear on the right. When you have allocated all your points, and
you qualify for one or more classes, press ESC (the key above CTRL) to choose
one. You must then enter the letter of the class you want.

Finally, you will be asked if you really want to keep this character. If you
do, press Y. If not N. After that, your character will be placed on diskette,
and you will be returned to the main options page of the Training Grounds.

                         Second Training Ground Option
Now, by typing in the name of your character, or that of any other character
you have created, and pressing RETURN, you will be able to inspect that
character. If the character has a PASSWORD, you will have to type it in to gain
access. When you type in a password, a number of X's are displayed to disguise
your typing. If you type in the name of a character who is not already stored
on diskette, you will have the option of creating him (which really means you
are back at the first option, silly goose).

Once you have gained access to a character, you may do any of the following:

D)ELETE:
eradicates your character.

R)EROLL:
is equivalent to deleting and then creating character again.

C)HANGE CLASS:
lets you change your character into a character of another class. You will be
told which classes you qualify for, and you may press a letter to switch to
that class. If you do so, the character becomes a first level character of the
new class with zero experience points, but he gets the following advantages:

  -he keeps his maximum hit points
  -he keeps the knowledge of the spells he may have learned in the previous
   class, and may cast one spell for each spell he knows. Additionally, he may
   learn new spells of levels in which he already knows one or more spells, but
   not any spells of other levels. The net effect is to give him some of the
   abilities of his previous class(es).

S)ET NEW PASSWORD:
lets you alter the password of the character. You'll be asked to enter the new
password twice to make sure it is correct.

I)NSPECT:
lets you see all of your character's statistics and abilities. You will be
shown the character's class, level, alignment, characteristics, hit points,
gold, experience, spells left and items, and you will have the option to look
at his spell books. This page of information can be reached from many places
and will let you do different things when displayed from different places. The
only option available from the Training Grounds is the ability to R)EAD SPELL
BOOKS. Pressing R lets you choose if you want to read M)AGE or P)RIEST spell
books. Pressing either will then display the names of the spells of that class
that your character knows. Programs to print these spells will be available in
the future.

Options available in other areas include:

T)RADING:
lets you trade items and gold to members of the party your character is
adventuring with. Pressing T will display a list of the characters in the
party, and prompt for the number of the character you want to trade with. Then
you will be asked how much gold you want to give. You can enter an amount or
press RETURN to skip giving gold. Then you will be asked which item you want to
give. Again, you can press RETURN or enter the number of one of your items. The
process of giving items will repeat until you press RETURN.

E)QUIPPING:
lets you decide what of your characters possessions he will wear. A list of
your weapons, armor, shields, and so on, will be displayed, and you may choose
which, if any, you want to wear. Note however, that if you have found a cursed
item you will be forced to wear it if you equip. That's why it is a good idea
to have items I)dentified.

CASTING S)PELLS
lets you cast various spells useful to the party. Some, like curative spells
that restore hit points, ask what party member is to receive the spell.

U)SE AN ITEM:
lets you use items to cast spells.

I)DENTIFYING is done only by Bishops and lets them attempt to divine the true
nature of an item.

L)EAVE
returns to wherever you were before you inspected.

                         Third Training Ground Option
There is one last option in the Training Grounds. Type in *ROSTER and press
RETURN. You will display a list of all the existing characters. Displayed are
name, class, alignment, hit points and status (dead, alive, etc.). You must
press L to L)EAVE this page.

Lastly, by just pressing RETURN on the main page, you can move to the castle.
(This is really an option so they lied; there are four options.)

                                   GET...SET

The castle is the starting and ending point of all expeditions. There you can
rest, create parties, get help from the gods, buy and sell equipment, or go to
any other part of the game.

There ar five main options in the castle. These are:

THE A)DVENTURERS INN
G)IGAMESH'S TAVERN
THE TEMPLE OF C)ANT
B)OLTAC'S TRADING POST
THE E)DGE OF TOWN

To enter any of these, just press the first letter of the name of the place you
want to go.

Normally, the first stop at the beginning of a session is always G)igamesh's
Tavern, where you can create a party. At the top of the screen there is a
display of the current party, with space for six players. Displayed are
position number, name, Alignment, and Class, Armor class (AC), Current Hit
Points, and Status of each character. Alignment and class are displayed in the
form A-CCC where A is the first letter of the character's alignment (G, N, or
E) and CCC are the first three letters of the character's class. If the
character is OK, then the status area will display his maximum hit points.

In the tavern you may:

A)DD A MEMBER TO THE PARTY
R)EMOVE A MEMBER FROM THE PARTY
#)TO INSPECT A MEMBER
or PRESS RETURN TO EXIT

A)DD :
will ask you to enter a character's name and password and will add him or her
to the party. Characters cannot be added if they are marked on expedition (see
below) or if they are of incompatible alignment. Characters who are not OK can
be added so that they can be taken to the maze where spells can be cast on
them.

R)EMOVE:
asks you for the number of the person and removes him from the party.

#):
means you can press any valid player # to inspect that player. A page full of
information about that character will be displayed, and you will be able to
R)ead his spell books, E)quip him with armor and weapons, T)rade items and gold
to other characters, or L)eave and return to the Tavern.

Finally, just pressing RETURN takes you back to the marketplace of the castle
where you can go anywhere else.

Important Note:
When your character joins a party, his record on diskette is marked as "On
Expedition." Normally, when you leave an expedition, are lost forever, or just
leave the game, the mark is changed back to "Available." However, if you turn
off the computer, or RESET it, all knowledge of things that have happened to
your character since you joined the party will be lost, and the computer will
think he is still out on an expedition. The only way to recover a character
like this is to use the Utility functions recovery program previously
mentioned. The reasons for marking characters is that it:

1. Prevents cheating by Reset when you run into some monsters you don't think
   that you can handle
2. Provides compatibility with versions of Wizardry for multi-Apple networks,
   such as that provided by the Corvus Constellation.

An accidental power failure or RESET press will happen once in a blue moon, and
you should never have to worry about this at all.

A)DVENTURER'S INN:
is a place where any weary adventurer can get a place to rest and recover from
his exertions, and all for a modest charge. When you enter, you will be asked
for the number of the character who wishes to enter the Inn, or you may press
RETURN to leave the Inn.

Once inside, a character may rest in the stables overnight, or use one of
several types of rooms. Overnight resting allows the character to regain his
spells, but does nothing to restore hit points. The other rooms let you regain
hit points at a certain rate per week, and the more expensive the room, the
faster the rate of healing. Remember, AGE is important in this game, so you do
not want to spend too much time in a bed! As you rest you will see a week by
week plot of your hit points going up and your gold supply going down. It will
end when you are fully healed or when your gold runs out, or if you press any
key.

After using the Inn, a check is make to see if you have attained the next level
of ability. If you do, then your Maximum hit points will increase, your
characteristics may change, and you may learn new spells and gain the ability
to cast more of the older spells. If you have not made the next level, you will
be told how many points you need to get there.

Whenever a party brings back characters who are dead, paralyzed, or otherwise
unfit, they are removed from the party by the castle guards and taken to the
TEMPLE OF C)ANT. The sole exceptions are POISONED characters who will get well
on their own, and characters that are LOST forever, who will be buried. Upon
entering the temple (press "C") you will be asked who you want to help, and if
the priests of the temple can help him, they will tell you what donation is
required, and ask who will pay. If a party member can afford the fee, then the
sycophants will go to work. If the character is anything but dead or blown to
ashes, success is assured, but otherwise there is a chance that the temple's
best efforts will be to no avail! A good VITALITY usually means that they will
be able to succeed, but old, infirm, characters may be in big trouble. Dead
characters who fail to be raised from the dead are reduced to ASHES! There is
still hope because for a larger fee, it is sometimes possible to resurrect a
person from ashes, but if this attempt fails, the character is dead forever and
can never be restored by any means!

The commercial center of the castle is owned by a friendly dwarf named Boltac.
However, like all dwarfs, Boltac likes gold and will sell you your own armor if
he can. Also, since he is a monopoly, he tends to do pretty well. Press B to
enter his trading post. After you have indicated who is to enter (by pressing a
number), you will be able to:

B)UY AN ITEM
S)ELL AN ITEM
have an item U)NCURSED or I)DENTIFIED, or
L)EAVE.

B)UYING an item lets you see a list of items for sale and their prices.

You can scroll F)ORWARD or B)ACKWARD through the inventory.

P)URCHASE an item by entering a number after pressing P

return to the S)TART of the list -- or --

L)EAVE the shelves.

If you attempt to buy something that the character cannot use (for example, a
mage buying plate mail) you will be asked to confirm the purchase.

S)ELLING an item will display the items you have, along with the price that
will be paid for it, which is generally half the buying price. Unidentified
items are only worth one gold piece.

U)NCURSING and I)DENTIFYING:
also list your items and ask which you want uncursed or identified. Items which
are cursed are both detrimental and sticky! If you have a cursed sword, for
example, not only will it refuse to fight well, but it won't let you put it
down! However, the curse does not take effect until you change your equipment,
so before you do that, it's a good idea to get it identified.

Identification is the same as the BISHOP ability. When you find an item in the
maze, you know what it looks like but not what it is! By getting it identified
you can sell it, get rid of it if it is detrimental, or trade it to someone who
could use it. Both of these services cost a variable amount, depending on the
power of the particular item.

Note:
Boltac's is a true store and keeps an inventory of items for sale. While
mundane items are available in unlimited supply, magical items are not. It is
possible for Boltac to run out of stock! If this happens, the only way for him
to replenish his stock is by selling him items you have found in the maze!

To go anywhere else you have to go to the E)DGE OF TOWN. There you can go to
the T)RAINING GROUNDS, back to the C)ASTLE, into the M)AZE, or L)EAVE the game.
If you go to the training grounds, your party is disbanded.

                                     GO...

The most important part of the game of Wizardry is adventuring. After you have
gathered together in a party, purchased or traded for the best equipment you
can afford, and rested up to restore hit points and spells, it is time to leave
the safe, but expensive, confines of the castle and enter the unsafe, but
possibly lucrative, corridors of the maze.

As soon as you enter the maze from the castle, you will be placed in the camp.
Being in camp means that you have stopped somewhere and set up a strong guard
against monsters, so that members of the party can trade, equip new items,
reorder, and so on. You will see a display of the characters in the party much
like that seen in the castle, and a list of options.

You can inspect any character by pressing his number, just like in the Tavern.
In addition to the options available in the Castle, you will be able to: CAST
S)PELLS and U)SE ITEMS.


When inspecting a character, if you press S, you will be asked what spell you
want to cast. You must enter the name of the spell that can be cast in camp
(see Spells and Items) and that you know how to cast, and that you have a spell
point left to use to cast it. Remember that for each level of power of spells
for both magical and priestly spells, you are given a number of spells you can
cast. Say you have five first-level, three second-level and one third-level
priestly spells. If you know (have in your spell books) three first-, one
second- and one third-level spell, that means that you can cast any of your
three first-level spells five times, or two once and one three times, or any
combination. You have the ability to cast any of your first-level spells five
times. Since you know only one second-level spell you can throw only it, but
you can do it three times, and you can cast your third-level spell one time.
Note that it is possible to be able to throw spells of the second or higher
level, but not know any spells of that level!

For many of the camp spells, especially curative spells, you will be asked who
is to be the object of the spell. The characters and their numbers will be
displayed and you press the number of the character who is to receive the
spell.

Some magic items, such as scrolls or wands, can cast magic or priestly spells
as well. By U)SING those items you can cast the spell at no cost to you. Again,
you may be asked who is to receive the spell. Also, there is a chance that the
item will lose its magic powers. Scrolls are only good for one application, but
a wand may last for 20 or 30!

The other options in the camp are: E)QUIP THE ENTIRE PARTY, R)ORDER THE PARTY,
and L)EAVE THE CAMP.

E)QUIP
does the same as the equip that you can do in the inspect page, but it does it
for everyone in the party, It is very handy the first time you go into the
maze.

R)ORDER
lets you select the order in which the players will march through the maze.
When fighting monsters, only the first three characters can attack with
weapons, and in turn be physically attacked by monsters. Thus, it is a good
idea to have the weaker and less armored characters in the rear. You will be
asked for the number of the character who is to go into first position, the
number of the character who is to go in the second position, etc.

D)isbanding the party is useful if your party is totallylost or so weakened
that your chances of getting to the castle are remote. Disbanding your party
essentially leaves your characters in the maze waiting until a new party can
rescue the disbanded members. The status of disbaneed characters is similar to
characters who havce been slaughtered in the maze. The difference is that
disbanded characters are strill alive and retain all of their possessions.
Additionaly, there is no chance the monster will snack on them. Disbanded party
members can be located using the KANDI spell and rescued when found by
I)nspection. The I)nspect area option is described later on in the manual. Your
disbanded haracters will age 1/2 year as the have to wait around for someone to
come and get them.

L)EAVE
lets you break camp and go into the maze. This is where the real adventure
begins.

Once in the maze, a Hi-Resolution graphics display is used. The information
about your characters is at the bottom of the screen. In the top left corner is
a 3D Hidden Surface display of where you are in the maze. To the right of it is
information about which spells are active at the time, such as protection or
light.

Above that is a short list of your option keys, and between the maze display
and the status information is a blank area where messages may appear. At some
locations you will find special objects such as messages, pits, stairs, etc.
When you move onto one of those squares a message to that effect will appear.
When you enter the maze from the city, you are at the bottom of a set of
stairs.

Wizardry uses a 3D perspective plot of the maze as you would see it if you were
actually there. You will see the walls of the maze extending into the distance.
By using a spell such as MILWA you can light up the maze so that you can see
further, and also see secret doors.

Try to get a good idea of the relationship between a top view (a map) and the
3D perspective view. Mapping is an essential part of Wizardry, and the use of
the 3D display makes it more challenging and interesting.

While moving around, your options are:

F - moves you forward a step in the direction you are facing
L - turns you left
R - turns you right
K - lets you kick through a door if it is right in front of you
S - updates the status area
C - enters the camp
T - lets you change the display delay time. This is the time the game waits to
    let you see some message in combat. A delay of 1 lets messages flash with
    no delay A delay of 5000 will leave messages on the screen for about five
    seconds.
Q - lets you toggle quick plotting of the maze. See the LOMILWA spell
    description for more information.
I - lets you inspect the current area you are in for dead bodies. See below for
    more details.

As an aid to quick movement, the W-A-D cluster of keys can be used in place of
the F-L-R arrangement. If you place your left hand above the S key you will see
that your middle three fingers fall onto the W-A-D cluster. To move in any
direction, press with the finger that points to that direction. To turn left,
press the leftmost finger (A). To turn right, press the rightmost finger (D).
And to go forward, press the center (W). With a little practice you will find
this arrangement to be very handy and natural, as you can keep the fingers of
your left hand on the keys at all times, and use the leftmost two fingers of
the right hand to press K.

As you move through the maze you may find many interesting things, and messages
and questions may appear. You may also encounter monsters, in which case,
combat may ensue.

It is a good idea to keep a map of the maze. This lets you get back to the
exit. Also, be aware that there are secret doors which you rarely see, but you
can get through by trying to Kick it. If there is a door where you Kick, you'll
go through. Otherwise, you'll stub your toe!

As was mentioned above, the I)nspect option lets you search the maze for the
bodies of slain adventurers. When an entire party is wiped out (no one makes it
back to the castle and the cemetery is displayed) the bodies may or may not be
eaten by the monsters. The most likely consequence is that a body will be
stripped of some gold and equipment and left where it fell. Less likely is that
it may be dragged to another location in the maze, perhaps even lower down.
Least likely, but an increasing chance the deeper you are in the maze, is that
the body will be devoured. The KANDI spell may be used to locate dead
adventurers.

When you I)nspect, a search is made for all dead bodies in the same area as the
party. A body is in the same area if you can get to it without going through a
door. So, it must be in the same room or corridor as you are. If bodies are
found, they will be displayed with a number to the left. You can press "P" to
pick up or "L" to leave. When you press "P", you will be asked for the number
of the character to pick up. When a character is picked up he is added to the
party, and so if the party is six strong, you cannot pick up any more party
members.

Once back in the castle, the normal Temple donations can be used to obtain the
correct spells for revival of the characters.

A direct consequence of this is that any character you don't want any more
because he died and is lost somewhere in the maze, has to be deleted via the
Training Grounds. If you do not delete him, space will be wasted on disk and
may not be available to others. Also, since the dead characters are taken away
from the party by the guards when the party returns to the castle, it is a good
idea to strip them of items of gold before returning to the castle. If the
character cannot be raised from the dead, and is dead forever, the Temple will
sacrifice all he has to the gods, because he obviously did something to deserve
not being restored!

                                  COMBAT....

Without some sort of challenge, Wizardry would just be a game of mapping. And
after all, who gathers all the money in the maze together so that characters
can get it all in nice packages? That's right, it's the job of the hardworking,
and hopefully luckless, monsters. Thus, every so often your party will
encounter monsters. They may be wandering around like you, or they may be
inhabitants of a room that you have just entered. In any case, since monsters
do not generally like the habits, morals, and taste in armor and weaponry of
characters, and because they really do like the smell and taste of a good "leg
of adventurer", it is likely that a fight will take place.

When you have encountered monsters, a message to that effect will appear. In a
few seconds that will be replaced with a display of the monsters that are
opposing you, as well as a full color picture of the monsters.

For each group of monsters, and there can be four of them, you will be told the
group number of the monsters, how many there are, what they appear to be, and,
in parentheses, how many are able to attack the party.

It is interesting to note that you do not always know exactly what the monsters
are! Most of the time you will be told what they look like, and later on in the
melee you will find ot what they really are. There is a small chance that if
your party is of GOOD alignment (no evils and at least one good character), the
monsters you meet may be friendly and will invite you to pass. If not, however,
combat will ensue. Combat consists of a series of rounds, during which each
character and monster can do a single activity. First, the computer decides
what the monsters are going to do. You may notice monsters moving forward in
order to attack you. Monsters in group 1 are the closest to you, so they have
the best chance of being able to physically attack you, and physical attacks by
characters have a better chance of hitting them. Spells can be cast without
penalty by any monster in any group which has the ability to cast spells, thus
spell casting monsters will generally hang back, where it is harder for your
fighters to attack them. Similarly, the first 3 characters in your party
automatically defend the second three (if any). This means that the second
three cannot be attacked physically. It also means that they cannot physically
attack the monsters.


                                COMBAT OPTIONS

After the monsters have made their decisions, it is time for you to select the
activities your characters will engage in. In the area where the active spells
were displayed, a list of options will be presented for each character. Just as
in other areas of Wizardry, options can be selected by pressing a single key.
The options are:

F - Fight a monster, If more than one group of monsters oppose the party, you
    will have to press the number of the group you want to fight.
P - Parry. You use your weapon as a tool of defense. Makes you harder to hit.
S - Spell. You enter the spell you wish to cast and if you can cast it, you may
    be asked which group or person you wish to cast it on.
U - Use an item. A list of items that can cast a spell are displayed and you
    can use an item by pressing the number of the desired item. Or, you can
    press RETURN to try another option. You may be asked the further questions
    needed to direct the spell to the proper recipient.
R - Run! Using this option causes the entire party to try to run. There is a
    chance your party won't get away, which is dependent on depth in the maze,
    party size, etc. If you don't get away, the monsters may chase you through
    several rooms, so running can get you lost!
D - Dispell. This option is only available to Priests, and high level Bishops
    and Lords. It works only against "Undead" (Zombies, Mummies, Skeletons,
    Wraiths, etc.), and causes some of them to disintegrate. The effectiveness
    of Dispell depends on how powerful the dispeller is and how resistant the
    dispellees are. Like Fight, you have to specify the group you are
    attempting to dispell.

If you make an error entering the activities you want your characters to
perform, there are several ways you can make a correction. If the option
requires more information, such as group number, you can press RETURN to cancel
the selection and make another. If, however, the computer is now asking for
options for the next character, you can press "B" to go B)ack to the beginning
and re-enter activities for all the characters.

After you have selected activities for all the characters, you will be given
one last chance to change your mind. At this point, you can press RETURN to
commence fighting out the round, or press "B" to go back and re-enter the
activities all over again.

When all this is done, the computer will mediate the combat. Actions as they
occur will appear in the message area. It may be that your character will be
killed or incapacitated before he has a chance to do what you wanted him to. At
the end of the round the statuses are replotted. Dead or incapacitated
characters are shifted to the back of the marching order. Monster groups
totally destroyed will disappear and the other groups will shift up. (If you
are fighting three groups and you kill off group 1, then the second and third
group would shift up to become the first and second group.) Remember that the
number after the monster name in parentheses is the number of live monsters
that are active. For example:

                               7 BUSHWACKERS (4)

means there are seven live Bushwhackers of which only four are able to fight.
Perhaps you cast a Katino spell and three fell into a coma?

This entire process repeats itself until either all of the party is dead (in
which case it is off to the cemetery as you have made a tasty snack for the
monsters), or all the monsters are dead, in which case all the survivors get
the loot and experience.

Reminder:
Dead or Incapacitated characters are not left in the maze, but are
automatically carried by surviving party members. Only when the entire party is
slaughtered are characters strewn about the maze. It is these unfortunates who
cane be searched for via the I)nspect option and the Kandi spell.

The experience each character gets will be plotted where the monsters names
were listed, and the gold and items found, if any, will plot in the message
area.

However, there might be one slight problem! The treasure may be in a chest,
which you will have to open. And there may some sort of trap in the chest.
However, chests can hold a lot more loot.

If a treasure chest is found, you will have to try to open it. A chest will be
displayed, and you will have the following options. Each will ask you who is
doing the action, and you will have to enter the number of that person.

O - Open the chest. If you think the chest is not trapped, then just open it!
    But, if it is trapped, watch out!

I - Inspect the chest. There is a chance that inspecting the chest will set off
    the trap (if there is one), but the chance is much lower for Thieves. If
    you inspect you will be told what you think the trap is. But it may not be
    that at all! Each person can inspect only once.

C - CALFO spell. This spell is a priestly spell that determines the correct
    trap 95% of the time. Only a character that knows the CALFO spell, and has
    the spell points to cast it may use this spell.

D - Disarm the trap. You will have to enter what trap you think it is, and had
    better not make any spelling mistakes. If you enter the wrong trap name,
    and the trap goes off, you may be in big trouble.
L - Leave the chest alone. You don't get the loot but you don't set off any
    traps either.

After the chest has been opened, the loot will be distributed evenly between
surviving characters, and any items found will be distributed randomly. It is a
good idea to leave one or two of your item slots open so that you get your fair
share.

After the combat, it may be a good idea to C)AMP and cast a few restorative
spells if anyone got hurt. Otherwise, it's onward, ever onward!

                              TIPS FOR BEGINNERS

- Balance your party. When first starting out, have a party of 2 fighters, a
  priest, a thief, and 2 mages. This is the strongest party you can make out of
  level 1 to 3 characters.

- Remember that "Discretion is the better part of Valor." A good motto for
  beginning adventurers might be "He who lives to quits and runs away, lives to
  fight another day." It is inevitable that you will eventually meet a group of
  monsters tougher than you are. If party members start dropping right and
  left, run for it.

- Use your spell casters wisely. When fighting monsters, have them use "KATINO"
  to knock out the opposition so you can slit their throats. Of course, this
  may not work against some monsters, and these you should run from until you
  are more powerful.

- If anyone gets hurt, or if you use any spells, get out of the maze as fast as
  you can and recuperate. The best way to build up character is to dash into
  the maze, fight one encounter and run out again.

- Make accurate maps, and check them constantly. Be wary of nasty tricks
  designed to create inaccurate maps. Maps are especially useful if you are
  running away from monsters a lot.
