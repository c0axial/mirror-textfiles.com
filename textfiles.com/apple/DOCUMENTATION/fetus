The Deal:
----------------------------------

This program is SHAREWARE, but only in a weak sense.  We aren't going to tell you to delete it if you don't pay in 10 days, rather, we are simply asking you, the public to help support us in our efforts to keep the GS alive since nobody else seems willing to do it.  We have spent over $300 in long distance phone bills to get this game finished, but in order for us to continue to create games like this, we need some financial help.  All that we are asking is that you send us ---> $5 <---- so that we can pay our bills and continue to do more of these things.  Please, if you like this game or any of our other freeware games like Grackel, Copy Killers, or Quadronome, then please please please send us the $5 donation.  The future of the GS depends on it.  If you do not want to pay $5, then we ask you to at least donate $5 to the American Cancer Society or some other charitable organization as a gesture of good will. A third alternative would be to buy our MEGA game "Xenocide" which is published by Micro Revelations (1-800-442-6002).  The game is about $32 from the mail order places.

The Game:
-----------------------------------

The object of Senseless Violence I is to get all 5 of the baby bottles in as little time as possible.  Use the keypad to move the baby.  Try to avoid falling in the water by jumping on logs and rafts, and avoid being hit by the fireballs or the cars.  To pick up a bottle, simply walk the baby over it.  You will then need to return to the bottom of the screen in order to drop the bottle off (dropping is automatic when you return).  If you are killed on your way back home, then the bottle you picked up will be put back.  You can only carry 1 bottle at a time, and you get 3 lives.  The timer is a thermometer meter that runs up from 0 to 6.  If the meter reaches 6, you will not be killed, but you have done a poor job.  Play against a friend and see who can get the best time (my best time to date is 2.3).  When the game is over, press a key to return to the main menu.

The Other Stuff:
---------------------------------------

When the program boots, there is a very loud "static screen."  If you would like to prevent the static from blowing your eardrums out, hold down the Open-Apple key until you see the screen.

To skip or terminate the opening title sequence, press the <spacebar>.

This program was developed under System Disk 5.0 running on a 1.75 meg GS.  I have no idea how much memory this game requires, but it will _probably_ run on a 512K GS.  If it doesn't, then try booting it from Prodos16 V1.6.  If this still does not work, then get more memory.

The Disclaimer:
-----------------------------------------------        

* The characters and events portrayed in this game are fictitious and are not based on anyone, living or dead.

* Yes, this game does contain some material which may be offensive to some viewers, but even the most prude of humans should be able to take a joke which is exactly what this program is... a JOKE!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! So if you are a prude, don't give us a hard time or call us Sadists.  Just laugh and enjoy it.  This game is an amalgam of ideas that OTHER people gave to us, so blame them if you want to get all upset about a harmless joke.

P.S.  If for some strange reason you don't like this game, just ask yourself one question:  How much did you pay for it, eh?
