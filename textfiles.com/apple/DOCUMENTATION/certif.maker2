ENTER THE SIGNATURE LINE
-------------------------

Enter the signature text you want to appear on the certificate. 

All  certificates  include  a  pre-drawn line on which you can sign your
name; the length of the line cannot be  changed.  The  word  "signature"
beneath  the  signature  line  is replaced on the printed certificate by
what you enter on this screen. 

Signature text is centered beneath the signature line. If  you  want  to
move  the  text  to the left, use the [Spacebar] to enter some spaces at
the end of your name. 

There is only one font for signature text. It is  a  special  font  that
appears only in the signature area. 


SELECT THE *NAME* FILE
-----------------------

This  screen  appears  only  if the body text you entered has the *NAME*
wildcard. 

Select the *NAME* file from which you wish to draw names to  be  printed
on several copies of the certificate. 

If  you  have  not done so already, the program will ask you to insert a
*NAME* file disk into the appropriate disk drive. 

Insert a new disk, then select NEW DISK if the *NAME* file you  want  is
on a different disk. 


SELECT THE NAMES
-----------------

Select  SELECT  ALL  NAMES  if you want to print a certificate for every
name in the file. An asterisk will appear to the left of each name. 

Select this option also if you want to select most  but  not  all  names
from  the  list.  Then  move  the cursor to the names you DON'T want and
press [return] to delete those names. 

Select the INDIVIDUAL NAMES if you want to print certificates for only a
few of the names in the file. An asterisk will appear next to each  name
you select. 

To  remove a name accidentally selected, move the cursor to the name and
press [return]. 

Select PROCEED TO PRINT when you are done selecting names. 


PRINT THE CERTIFICATE
----------------------

Select PRINT CERTIFICATE if the printer name displayed is  the  name  of
your printer, and if you are sure that the paper is adjusted properly in
the printer. 

Until  you  become  familiar with how to align the paper for the various
certificate formats, it is a good idea to select the Print  Test  option
(described  in  the  next  section  of  these  dox)  before  printing  a
certificate. 

The format of each certificate (horizontal, vertical, or  small)  cannot
be changed. 

If your text has a *NAME* wildcard, the program will print one cert. for
each name you specified in the SELECT NAMES section. If the *NAME* cert.
are  horizontal or vertical, the program will advance the printer to the
top-of-form after each cert. is printed. If the *NAME* certificates  are
the small format, the program will print them two to a page. 

NOTE:  The  program  will  print about one-third of the certificate at a
time, then pause for a few moments before continuing. DON"T  worry  when
your printer stops before printing the entire certificate! 

When  the  printing is done, the program returns to the Print Menu. This
gives you a chance to print the certificate again.  If you want to print
the cert. again but accidentally select Main Menu, you can get  back  to
the Print Menu by pressing [esc] from the Main Menu. 


Select  PRINT  TEST  if  you  want  to  find  out where on the paper the
certificate will print.  The  program  will  print  a  four-corner  test
pattern  of  the  certificate;  this  saves you from printing the entire
certificate when you are not sure if the paper is aligned properly. This
option is particularly recom- mended the very first time you use CM  and
on all occasions where you are printing several *NAME* certificates. 

Print  Test  is  also  helpful  when you want to make sure that you have
selected the right printer in the Change Setup procedure. 


Select MAIN MENU if you want to start over or quit CM. From  there,  you
can  press  [esc] to return to the Print Menu if you decide to print the
certificate after all. If you make any other  selection  from  the  Main
Menu, the information you have entered in Steps 2-11 will be lost. 

Select  CHANGE  SETUP  if  the printer setup displayed does not describe
your printer. The program will display an alphabetical list of  all  the
printers that can be used with CM. 

Scroll through the list until you find your printer, then select it. The
program  may  have  you  respond  to one or more questions regarding the
specific configuration of your printer. 

You will have to do the Change Setup procedure only the first  time  you
print  a  certificate  (and  again  if  you ever use CM with a different
printer). Once you have specified your  type  of  printer,  the  program
remembers it. 


PRINTER TIPS
-------------

Colored ribbons and colored paper, available from your favorite computer
store, can add flair to your certificates. 

The  graphics  resolution  of  your  printer  will have an effect on the
appearance of your certificates. A graphics resolution of 120 by 72 dots
per inch provides the best quality. 

If the printer  skips  lines  while  printing  a  cert.,  turn  off  the
automatic  linefeed setting on your printer. See your printer manual for
instructions. (Note: Some of the Change Setup procedures  allow  you  to
turn off linefeeds without physically adjusting your printer.)

If  the  printer  doesn't  work,  turn it off and back on again, then go
through the Change Setup procedure. If that doesn't help,  compare  your
DIP switch settings to those recommended in your printer manual. 



*NAME* FILE
------------

This section explains how to create a new *NAME* file and how to edit an
existing  *NAME*  file.  At  the  top  of each page, the entry screen is
lettered in the order in which you will use it. Follow these  steps  for
quick reference. 

1. Select NAME FILE from the Main Menu. 

2. Select CREATE NEW *NAME* FILE from the Select Option...  screen. 

3.  Then  ENTER  NAME # 1 and keep entering as many names as you want in
the file. Then when you have entered the number of names you want,  just
hit [return] on a blank line. 

4. Then enter the name that you want to SAVE the *NAME* LIST AS. 


To edit an existing *NAME file, just select NAME FILE from the Main Menu
again  and  then  select  EDIT  EXISTING  *NAME*  FILE  from  the Select
Option... menu. Then select the name file you want to use and  then  you
should be able to walk through the menu's from there and figure it out. 

I will now describe in more detail how these steps are performed: 


SELECT *NAME* FILE OPTION
--------------------------

This  is the first screen you see when you select the *NAME* File option
from the Main Menu. 

Select CREATE NEW *NAME* FILE if you want to make a new list  of  names.
The program then goes to the ENTER NAMES screen. 

Select  EDIT  EXISTING  *NAME*  FILE  if  you  want  to  make additions,
corrections, or deletions to an existing file. The program goes  to  the
SELECT *NAME* FILE screen. 

Select the *name* file you want to edit. 

If  you  have  not done so already, the program will ask you to insert a
*name* file disk into the appropriate disk drive. 

The program then goes to the EDIT *NAME* FILE screen. 

Change the disk in the disk drive, then select NEW DISK  if  the  *name*
file you want is on a different disk. 


ENTER NAMES
------------

Enter  each  name  that  you  want  to appear in the file. Each file may
contain up to 75 names. As you enter names, the number at the top of the
screen indicates how many names are in the file. 

Each name in the list can be up to  25  characters  long.   Within  that
limit,  each name may contain as many words as you like. Enter each name
as you want it to appear on the certificate  (example,  MARY  SMITH  not
SMITH, MARY). 

Make  sure  the name is correct befor you press [return]! Once you press
[return], the only way to correct a name is through  the  EDIT  EXISTING
*NAME*  FILE  procedure.  To  make  corrections  use  the [backarrow] or
[delete] key as described in the Introduction. 

The order in which you enter names is not important.  When  you  save  a
*NAME* file, the program automatically alphabetizes the list by the last
word you enter. 

When  you are done entering names, press [return] when the entry line is
blank. 


SAVE *NAME* FILE
-----------------

Enter a name for the *name* file. Choose  a  name  that  will  help  you
remember the contents of the file. 

*NAME*  FILES  HAVE  FILENAME PREFIXES, BUT THE PREFIXES ARE ASSIGNED BY
THE PROGRAM AUTOMATICALLY. YOU CANNOT INCLUDE  A  FILENAME  PREFIX  WHEN
NAMING  A  *NAME*  FILE.  The  prefix  assigned  by  the  program is CMN
(CMN.FILENAME). The only time you will need to use the  filename  prefix
is when you are copying or deleting a file in ProDOS. 

*Name*  files  must be saved on a data disk. Never save a *name* file on
the Certificate Maker Master Program (Disk 1 - Side  A)  or  Certificate
disk.  If  you  have  more  than  one disk drive, the program displays a
message reminding you which drive to use . 

If you are saving an edited file, you can keep  both  the  original  and
edited  versions of the file by assigning a new name to the file, or you
can get rid of the original version by assigning its name to the  edited
version. 

For  more  info  on  disks,  filenames,  and filename prefixes, see your
ProDOS manual. 

When the file has been saved, the program returns to the MAIN MENU. 


EDIT *NAME* FILE
-----------------

Select ADD NEW NAME if you want to add one or more names  to  the  file.
The program goes to the screen that says, ENTER NAME TO BE ADDED. 

Select  A  PREVIOUSLY  ENTERED NAME if you want to delete that name from
the list. As you  scroll  through  the  list  of  names,  each  name  is
highlighted,  and  the word DELETE appears next to it. When the name you
want to delete is highlighted, press [return]. 

You cannot edit a previously entered name. Thus, in order to change MRAY
MSITH to MARY SMITH, you must first  delete  the  incorrect  name,  then
select Add new name and enter the correct name. 

Select SAVE EDITED FILE when you are done editing the file.  The program
goes to the screen called, SAVE *NAME* FILE. 



ENTER NAME TO BE ADDED
-----------------------

Enter  each name you want to add to the file. Remember, each name can be
up to 25 characters long, and there is a maximum of 75 names per file. 

To make corrections,  press  [backarrow]  or  [delete]  before  pressing
[return]. Once you have entered a name, you can correct it only from the
EDIT *NAME* FILE screen. 

When  you are done entering names, press [return] when the entry line is
blank. The program will then go to the EDIT  *NAME*  FILE  screen.  From
there, you can save the file. 

On  the  EDIT *NAME* FILE screen, the names you added will appear at the
end of the list. Then, when  you  save  the  file,  the  names  will  be
arranged in alphabetical order. 


                The End!
