QuickLaunch by Steve Stepenson and Seven Hills Software

QuickLaunch was written by Steve Stephenson and is fully copyrighted  by Seven Hills Software Corporation, 1991-1992.  Seven Hills Software has allowed Apple to include QuickLaunch on the Apple IIGS System Software v.6.0 Golden Master CD to help show off some of the potential power of Finder extensions under System 6.0.

QuickLaunch allows users to add the names of their favorite applications to the "Extras" menu of the System 6.0 Finder.  Those applications can then be launched simply by selecting them from the "Extras" menu!

More information on how to use QuickLaunch can be found by installing it (copy it into your boot disk's "System:System.Setup" folder and reboot) and then selecting "QuickLaunch List..." from the "Extras" menu in the Finder.  QuickLaunch has a complete online help system built into it (nice touch, Steve!).  Please take a few minutes to read the help given under the topic of "General".

Enjoy!
