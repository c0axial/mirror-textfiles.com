        Congratulations on being selected for the esteemed position of
ManHunter. This guide will introduce you to all of the information you will
find necessary to become an effective, loyal follower of the Orb Alliance. 
ManHunter is the highest position a human can hold under the Alliance, so be
grateful.

        Each day, you will be given an assignment by our sector's supervising
Orb.  The assignments will involve tracking down humans who, in some way, have
wronged the Alliance.  You will be given a 24 hour period to discover and
report the human's identity so that he can be corrected.

        You have been issued one ManHunter Assignment Device (MAD).  MAD is
your link to the Alliance computer.  With MAD, you can access the tracking
records associated with your current assignment as well as the Human Database
Service. As Manhunter, you are allowed to travel to locations pertinent to your
current assignment.  DO NOT STRAY OR LOITER.  Always conduct yourself in a
manner suitable to your position.  Treat your fellow earthlings with the
indifference they deserve.

                                        -- The Order of the Orb Alliance

MANHUNTER ASSIGNMENT DEVICE (MAD)

        MAD is a small, portable apparatus linked by radio transmission to the
Alliance computer, MAD has two functions:


INFO and TRACKER
----------------

INFO

        This function provides access to limited information on all humans
currently residing in the Planet Earth city of New York.  After pressing the
INFO button, type in the full name of the human.  The Human Database Service
will then provide your MAD with information  (Address, ID numbers, etc.) of the
selected human.  After receiving information, you may select REPEAT to try
another name or select EXIT to leave the program.  If you accidentally type in
the wrong name, you can try again or type BYE to leave the program.


NOTE: The Orb Alliance has authorized Manhunters to visit any address
      furnished by the INFO system.


        As a Manhunter, you are required to record all pertinent data that you
discover during your investigations.  Luckily, INFO provides a means to ENTER
this data through its Autoscan feature.  Whenever important information is
picked up by a Manhunter  (important documents, notes, etc.),  Autoscan
examines the data and stores important information into memory for future
access.  To observe this data, select INFO from your MAD and type NOTES in
place of name.


TRACKER


        All human movement is recorded in the Human Tracking Records database
of the Alliance computer.  Due to the low priority placed on these records,
tracking information on each human is only available from shortly before the
time of the alleged criminal activity to a time period not extending beyond the
end of that day.  Due to unforeseen difficulties with human tracking disks, the
targeted human's identity is not recorded.  Also, tracking of a target is cut
off if the human should venture under earth soil.  However, this practice is
strictly forbidden and should not hamper your investigations.

        One function of MAD is to tap into the appropriate human tracking
records for your current assignment.  When MAD first accesses tracking records,
it will determine and then "tag" the most appropriate human target signal.  A
playback will then begin of that target's movements throughout the city. 
During playback, MAD will also display any other human targets that come in
close contact with the tagged human target.You may tag any of these human
subjects that you feel may be beneficial to your investigation.  To tag a new
target, simply place your marker over the desired subject and press ENTER.  The
yellow rotating target should change to the subject you have chosen.  You may
replay tracking records as often as you find necessary.  Manhunters are
authorized by the Orb Alliance to visit any location that a tagged target
visits.


NOTE:  Experienced Manhunters have found that the most efficient way to use the
       TRACKER is to watch it until it terminates transmission.  Proceed to
       replay the transmission, closing the MAD after the target leaves each
       location.  Travel to the location shown and investigate.


SIGNAL TRACKER
--------------

        This is a recently installed feature that allows the recording of
various signals entering and leaving the Alliance central computer.

        The Alliance central computer contains a Signal Analyzer  which resides
in its  I/O buffer.  Once playback begins, the Analyzer determines if a tagged
signal contains restricted information.  ANY TAGGED SIGNAL CONTAINING
RESTRICTED MATERIAL MUST BE INVESTIGATED.  However, since the analyzer is in an
experimental stage, a certain amount of manual control is necessary.  A signal
must first be tagged by the Manhunter before it can be analyzed.  To tag a
signal, place the marker over the signal you wish to be tagged and press ENTER.
The signal will change color when it has been tagged.  After a signal has been
tagged, it is automatically fed into the Analyzer.  If the analyzed signal
contains restricted information, the signal can then be traced back to its
source by your MAD tracking device.  After the traced signal leads you to a
suspect, you will follow normal Manhunter procedure to complete your
investigation.


MANHUNTER OVERVIEW
------------------

        A Sierra 3-D Animated Adventure Game, simply stated, is an interactive
movie where you become the main character.  In this game, the main character is
a Manhunter, an agent of the future who spies on fellow humans for an alien
empire.

        Each 3-D Animated Adventure Game has a main goal, and yours in
Manhunter is to track down humans for the Orb Alliance, learn the whereabouts
of the human underground, and ultimately discover the true purpose behind the
alien invasion. You will need to move stealthfully and wisely, as time is
quickly vanishing for America and its citizens.


TIPS ON PLAYING MANHUNTER
-------------------------

1. HOW TO MOVE AROUND

        Basic instructions on how to interact with this game are included in
this manual and the reference cards enclosed.  For those who are still not sure
of what to do, there is a WALK THRU included at the end of this manual.

2. KEEP YOUR FACE COVERED AND YOUR LIPS TIGHT

        Due to the dangerous nature of this adventure game, you will want to
save your game often.  Follow the instructions on your Manhunter Quick
Reference Card to SAVE GAME whenever you encounter a potentially dangerous
situation.

        If you do encounter danger, or fail to complete all the required tasks
to get past a given obstacle, you can follow the instructions on your reference
card to RESTORE GAME to the place you were at when you last saved your game.
Intelligent use of this function has spared many Manhunter from having position
terminated permanently.


NOTE: Manhunter a New York employs a convenient feature that automatically
      gives you a second chance after you have encountered the most grisly of
      situations (namely, a gruesome death!).  This feature allows you to face
      the most unexpected of conclusions without requiring you to replay the
      entire game.


3.  KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN

        Look at and examine everything you can.  Watch closely those around
you. Pay close attention to detail.  There are many clues, both visual and
symbolic, which will help you succeed in your quest.

4.  TEAM UP AGAINST THE ENEMY

        This orb-infested metropolis can be one mean place for a Manhunter to
live.  You may find it helpful to play Manhunter with a friend.  Different
humans come up with different ways to interpret clues, and besides, it makes
life a lot more fun.

5.  GOT YOUR BACK AGAINST THE WALL?

        If you've tried every trick of the trade and still can't get anywhere, don't panic.  Even expert Manhunters have been known to get blown to shreds. It's just part of the job.
