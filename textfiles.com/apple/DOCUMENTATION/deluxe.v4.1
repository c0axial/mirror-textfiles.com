   Here is the last update of Disk Disintegrater DeLuxe.  What it have
more than V4.0?  You can now unpack old DDD files.  A few changes have been
made in "Pack" option, in "Unpack" option and also in "Prodos commands" option.

Notes:
------
a) You can keep your configuration file of D.D.DeLUXE V4.0 without any
   problem.

b) If you use the loading file "D.D.DELUXE.LOAD", you must replace it by the
   new one.

c) All DDD files packed with V4.0 are compatible with D.D.DeLUXE V4.1 (in both
   ways).

d) To unpack old DDD files, you must proceed the same way you do with
   D.D.DeLUXE DDD files.

e) When you unpack an old DDD file, there is no guarantee the unpacked disk is
   exactly the same as the original disk because there is no checksum in the
   old DDD file.  But if you unpack a new DDD file (type $DD, with message
   in the file), if D.D.DeLUXE unpack without checksum error, you can be sure
   your unpacked disk is exactly the same as the original disk.

f) Last note: For the moment, the documentation has not been updated to V4.1.
   The present documentation is for D.D.DeLUXE V4.0.
