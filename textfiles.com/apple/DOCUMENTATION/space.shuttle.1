Mission Profile.
----------------

You are in control of the space shuttle, Discovery, on the 101st
shuttle mission of the Space Transportation System. Your target is an
orbiting satellite approximately 210 nautical miles above the Earth.

Your mission: To launch, rendezvous and dock with the satellite as
many times as you can, using a minimum amount of fuel, then return
safely to Earth. A word of caution: Each time you successfully dock,
the satellite's orbit becomes more erratic.


Equipment Check.
----------------

Flight mode selection: Press Spacebar, 1, 2, 3 to cycle through
flight mode options. Press RETURN once selection has been made.

Primary Engine/Countdown Key: Press "E" to start primary engine and
initiate countdown clock. Press "E" again when orbit altitude is
reached.

Cargo Door Key: Press "C" to open/close cargo bay doors when orbit
altitude is reached.

Landing Gear Key: Press "G" to lower landing gear just prior to
touchdown.

Joystick Controller: A realistic directional hand controller forward
and back moves shuttle forward or back (x-axis). Left and right
controls left/right movement (y-axis). With the fire button depressed,
forward or back stick movement moves shuttle up or down (z-axis).
Also the fire button has other uses in Launch, Orbit, and Reentry
phases as described in those sections.

Status Check: Press SPACEBAR to cycle through readouts of this
important information: Position, axes and pitch, mission elapsed time
(MET), and remaining fuel (flight #3).


Flight Selection.
-----------------

There are 3 different flight modes. Spend time with training flights
#1 and #2 before taking on all the challenge of a real, unassisted
shuttle mission (flight #3). Flights can only be selected before
countdown begins.

Flight #1 Autosimulator: This is a combination demonstration flight
and autosimulator. The shuttle flies an abbreviated mission. You do
not use any of the console controls. In this flight mode, most aborts
are ignored. Whenever you touch the joystick, you can take control
from that point until rendezvous. Then you can only use the joystick
controller to correct your Y axis and land.

Flight 2 Simulator: Astronauts spend 1000's of hours practicing in
ground-based simulators before flying an actual shuttle mission. In
this mode, experience the challenge and demands of a real mission -
with a couple of important exceptions. You don't use any fuel units,
so you have all the time you need to complete the mission. Also,
onboard computers will assist you during flight by compensating for
less than perfect piloting skills. Most aborts are overridden, but
your flight indicator display will alert you when you've erred.

Flight #3 STS 101: A full-fledged shuttle flight. All aborts are
operative and flight conditions are quite realistic. Good luck!


Flight Evaluation.
------------------

Abort Indicator: If critical problems occur at any time during a
flight, you may receive a "Launch Scrub" or "Mission Abort" signal.
If this happens, your flight has ended. Check and look up C/W number
to find out what went wrong.

Ranking: If you safely land the shuttle at Edwards Air Force Base in
flight #3, you performance will be computer evaluated. Your ranking
will be determined by the number of successful dockings and the
number of fuel units remaining at the end of the flight.

Launch.
-------

Objective: Launch your shuttle and attempt to arrive as close to the
satellite's orbit as possible. Follow a roller coaster path, and
continually match engine thrust with the computer indicator. Stay on
the course shown on the trajectory display, and correct your plane as
indicated in the small box. Each area is critical. Incorrect
trajectory burns up extra fuel and may abort your flight. If you
plane is far out of alignment at MECO (main engine shut off), it will
be much more difficult to dock with the target.

Launch Checklist.
-----------------

Launch Phases: As you fire your main engines and lift off from the
pad, you'll be going through 3 separate phases. The numbers 1, 2, 3
on your computer screen refer to points along the track where (1)
SRB's (solid rocket booster) are fired, (2) the shuttle reaches
maximum acceleration, (3) engine shutdown approaches. The X indicates
MECO (main engine cut off).

Thrust: Notice the two long horizontal bars on the control panel. "T"
means thrust, "C" for computer. The "C" arrow represents a signal
from the onboard computer indicating the proper thrust needed during
each phase of lift-off. You control thrust with the joystick button.
Keep both "T" and "C" arrows aligned. If you don't, you will be
alerted by an alarm which indicates you are wasting fuel. Immediately
press the joystick button to increase or decrease thrust.

Hold Down Bolts: Though your engines are firing, you won't leave the
launch pad until MET + 3. The Hold Down Bolts will keep your shuttle
on the ground until your engines develop enough thrust to overcome
the force of gravity.

Trajectory/Plane: In addition to regulating thrust, you also need to
follow the correct trajectory (joystick forward/back) and adjust your
plane (joystick left/right).

Line Horn: If you stray from the indicated launch trajectory, you
will waste fuel. To alert you that this is happening, a warning horn
will sound. This alarm can help you avoid an abort situation.

Separation: A yellow flash at about 26 nautical miles will indicate
Solid Rocket Booster Separation (SRBSEP). Another flash shortly after
MECO will alert you that the Main External Tank has fallen away into
the Indian Ocean (ETSEP).

Launch Sequence:
----------------

1) Select flight mode by pressing the SPACEBAR and keys 1, 2, or 3.
Then press RETURN once selection has been made.
2) Wait approximately 5 seconds for all systems to become
operational.
3) When digital countdown clock appears, press "E" to activate Main
Engine and initiate countdown.
4) At MET-004, press the fire button to ignite main engines, then use
this button to keep "T" and "C" arrows aligned until you reach orbit.
5) Watch Trajectory Tracking Screen and use the joystick to maintain
correct ascension track and left-right alignment (horn sounds to warn
you reached orbit).
5) Watch Trajectory Tracking Screen and use the joystick to maintain
correct ascension track and left-right alignment (horn sounds to warn
you of trajectory varance).
-     Move joystick forward or backwards to maintain correct
      trajectory course. Try to stay on or just below the plotted
      line.
-     Move joystick left or right to keep dot centered in small
      "plane indicator" box.
6) At about 205 nautical miles, press "E" to shut off the main
engine. The closer you come to the 210 mile altitude, the nearer
you'll be to the target satillete's orbit. WARNING: If you shut off
the main engine at less than 195 miles, the shuttle will fall to
Earth!

Stablizing Orbit.
-----------------

Objective: Establish a stable by opening Cargo Bay Doors for heat
release and adjusting shuttle position to achieve visual contact with
Earth.

Cargo Bay Doors: Your first task is to open the bay doors. This is
vital and must be done during the first orbit. Radiators that shed
excess heat generated during the launch are on the inner surfaces of
these doors. If the doors remain closed, heat builds up inside the
shuttle and the warning horn sounds. You then have just 15 seconds to
open the doors. If you don't, the mission will be aborted.

Nose Down Maneuver: When the shuttle first achieves orbit, the nose
of the craft is pointed up, out of the line of sight of the
satellite. In order to dock, you must see the satellite. Adjust the
pitch, as explained below to bring the shuttle's nose down. When you
do this, you'll be able to see the blue Earth through the window.
Cargo bay door opening and pitch adjustment must be performed on the
first orbit before any further operations should be attempted.

Sequence to Stablize Orbit:
1) Press "C" to open cargo bay doors.
2) Press "R" to activate OMS Rotational Engines.
3) Move joystick forward or back to set pitch to -28.

Stable Orbit Summary: Cargo bay door opening and pitch adjustment
must be performed on the first orbit before any further operations
should be attempted.
