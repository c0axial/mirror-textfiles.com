GAME PLAY
---------

 HesGames uses two sets of keys during game play: the cursor keys (the
four  arrow  keys  on  the  right  of your keyboard- IIE) and a set of
motion keys (up, down, left, right,  and  action).  You  can  use  the
motion  key selections provided (see main menu) or you can select your
own motion keys. Throughout this doc file, the terms (UP, DOWN, RIGHT,
LEFT, and ACTION refer to the general motions, NOT the cursor keys. 


MAIN MENU SCREEN
----------------

 From the main menu screen, you can register up to two  players:  type
in their names and indicate which keys they will use to move. 

 From  this screen, you can switch from one event to another. Once you
have competed in some events, you can review your rank and scores. 

        ADDING OR CHANGING PLAYER INFORMATION

 To add or change information on the menu screen, use the  down  arrow
(IIe) or
 ctrl-j  (II/II+)  to  cycle through the boxes. The currently selected
box will flash. 

 In the name box type in a name and  affiliation,  for  example,  Jeff
Burman/USSR.  You can use these keys: A-Z, 0-9, /, -, and space bar. 

 Press  down  the  cursor  key  to begin the "keys" selection. You can
select which keys to use for all the motions  you  need  to  make--UP,
DOWN,  LEFT,  RIGHT,  and ACTION. When the keys box is flashing, press
the actual key you want to use for each motion. 

 The keys are listed from left to right in the  following  order:  UP,
DOWN,  LEFT,  RIGHT,  and ACTION. You can use the following keys: A-Z,
0-9, LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS, /, -, and space bar. 

       CHOOSING AN EVENT

 Once you have registered all the players, load one of the  events  by
pressing the up or down cursor keys (or the ctrl-j, ctrl-k keys on the
II/II+) until the event you want to load flashes. Press RETURN to load
in that particular event. 

       COMBINED SCORE

 For  each  first  place  score,  you  receive  a  gold medal and 1000
points. 

       RETURNING TO MENU SCREEN

 Press the escape key and then press 1 from any event to get  back  to
the menu screen. 



COMMAND MODE
------------

 The  command  mode allows you to perform various operations. Pressing
the escape key takes you into command  mode.  Once  in  command  mode,

CONTROL MODE AND PLAY MODE
--------------------------

 Each  event has two modes: a control mode and a play mode. In control
mode, you review the established records in  that  event,  and  change
some  event  options  (such  as type of dive and amount of weight). In
play mode, you participate in  the  event.  Press  ESC-6  to  go  into
control mode. Press ESC to exit control mode and return to play mode.

CLASSIC REPLAY
--------------

 The classic replay repeats any performance you have saved on a  disk.
The classic replay works with all events except archery. 

       INITIALIZE A DISK

 To  save  one  of  your  performances,  you need a specially prepared
performances disk. To prepare a performances disk, insert a  new  disk
into  the disk drive.  Press the ESC key and then press 3 to start the
save function. The program asks you for a filename. Press ESC and then
I to start the initialization  process.   This  will  take  about  one
minute.  When  initialization  is  completed,  the  program asks for a
filename. 

       DISK DIRECTORY

 To get a listing of the performances you have saved on a disk,  first
press  ESC  and  then  3  (for  save  function) or ESC and 4 (for load
function). The program will ask for a filename. Press ESC and  then  D
to list the directory. 

       SAVING YOUR PERFORMANCES

 First,  make  sure  you  have  a  prepared "performances" disk in the
drive. To save your best  performances,  type  ESC-3  from  any  event
screen  immediately  after  the  performance.  A  filename prompt will
appear at  the  top  of  the  screen.  The  filename  consists  of  an
abbreviation  of  the  name  of the event, a slash, and a filename you
provide. 

       LOADING A PERFORMANCE

 To load a saved performance, type ESC-4 from the event  screen.  Make
sure  the  disk  with  the performance that you want to load is in the
disk drive. A filename prompt will  appear  -  enter  the  appropriate

 Each  event (except archery) has a sample performance on the HesGames
disk. To load the sample, press ESC-4 and type in  the  following  for
the filename: 

              R/DEMO - RUNNING
              H/DEMO - HURDLES
              L/DEMO - LONG JUMP
              C/DEMO - CLEAN AND JERK
              T/DEMO - TWO HAND SNATCH

 After  you  have  loaded  in  a  performance,  press ESC-5 to see the
classic event replayed. 


100 METER SPRINT
----------------

 - Press the ACTION key once to indicate you are ready  to  start  the
race.   You'll hear the message ON YOUR MARK, and soon after, GET SET.
Begin the sprint when you  hear  the  word  GO.  If  two  players  are
running,  both must indicate readiness before the race can start. If a
previous performance is loaded in, it is always in readiness. 

 - Press the ACTION key of the second player (when you are running  by
yourself) to run against the computer. 

 -  The starting blocks are equipped with sensing devices to detect if
a false start was made. 

 - The instant you hear GO, start running byu pressing the  RIGHT  and
LEFT keys in rapid succession until you reach the finish line. 

 - After the runner crosses the finish line, he will continue to run a
victory lap until you press any key. 

       SWITCHING BETWEEN RUNNING AND HURDLES

 You  can  switch  quickly  between  100  meter  sprint  and 110 meter
hurdles. While in either one of these events, press ESC-8. Now use the
left and right cursor keys to select the event, then press ESC to exit
control mode and go to the new event. 



110 METER HURDLES
-----------------

 - Press the ACTION key once to indicate that you are ready  to  start
the race.  When you hear the word GO run by hitting the LEFT and RIGHT
keys rapidly. 

 -  Run  at  an even pace between the hurdles and press the ACTION key
when you want to clear the hurdle. 

 - Skim over the top of each hurdle- try not to fall down or  tap  the
hurdle. 

 -  Timing  in the leap is critical- if you hit the hurdle you'll lose
seconds. 

 - The hurdler will continue running a victory lap  until  you  hit  a
key. 



LONG JUMP
---------

 - Start off running as fast as you can by pressing the RIGHT and LEFT
keys. 

 -  The  white line is the take-off board. Plant your feet and jump as
close to the center as possible without going  over  the  line  (which
would cause a foul and a message "bad jump"). Take off by pressing the
ACTION key. 

 -  To  make  sure  you  always land forward, press the RIGHT key just
before you land. 




ARCHERY
-------

 - Each player gets six  shots  at  each  distance.  (The  scores  are
multiplied by six so that they compare to the actual outdoor event.)

 -  Keep  an  eye  on  the  wind  speed  and  direction,  which can be
unpredictable depending on the weather conditions for that  day,  such
as clear or overcast. 

 -  To  select  between  a  clear or overcast day (an overcast day has
variable and higher wind speeds), press ESC-8, and use left and  right
cursor keys to choose.  Press ESC to return. 

 - Select one of the targets; roughly position the bow by pressing the
keys below: 
               
               U   I   O
               
               J   K   L
               
               M   ,   .

 - Nock the bow by pressing the space bar. 

 -  Aim  the  bow  as  above  using  the  sight and adjusting for wind
direction and speed. Press the space bar when you are ready to release
the arrow. 

 - The longer you take to aim and shoot, the harder it will  be.  Your
grip becomes unsteady as time passes, and muscle fatigue sets in under
the strain. 

 - You are allowed only a certain amount of time to shoot. If you fail
to shoot in the time allowed, that shot will be cancelled and you will
get a score of 0. 

 -  If more than one player participates in this event, pressing ESC-9
switches from player to player. 




SPRINGBOARD DIVING
------------------

 - Start with the easier dives until you get the feel  of  the  board.
You'll soon be able to execute more dificult dives with precision, and
eventually be able to "call" the dive. 

 - For a simple dive, press RIGHT once for a forward dive, or LEFT for
a  reverse  dive. This signals to the judges the type of dive you will
perform. The scores will clear and you'll stand at attention to  alert
the judges that you are about to dive. 

 - Press the ACTION key once to start the forward momentum. You do not
need to run down the board using the left-right motion. 

 -  With  no  futher  action,  the diver will spill off the end of the
board. To make a better entry position, press the DOWN key to stop the
rotation at the precise moment. 

 - Once having mastered the basics of  diving,  work  on  your  spring
action  where you jump at the end of the board. Press the UP, DOWN, UP
keys anticipating the movements of the diver towards the  end  of  the
board. 

 -  Correct  timing and rythm give you the proper amount of height and
power. 

 - Once in the air, time your entry into the  water  to  complete  the
required number of sumersalts for your chosen dive. Press the DOWN key
to  begin  the  entry.  In  a  perfect  entry,  you  enter  the  water
vertically, your toes are pointed, and you make very little splash. 

 - You will be making a total of five motions once the  type  of  dive
has  been selected- ACTION to start the run down the board; UP-DOWN-UP
to obtain the proper spring; and DOWN to start the entry. 

 - Each judge scores the overall dive, however they may have different
criteria for scoring the dives. 

 - Practice different types of dives by playing with the timing if the
up-down-up motions. 

       CALLING THE TYPE OF DIVE

 To "call" or announce the dive you plan to do, enter the control mode
by pressing ESC-6. The TYPE OF DIVE box should flash. The dive you are
required to perform will be indicated before each round. Press the  up
cursor  key  (ctrl-k/II+) until the ROUND flashes. Select the round by
pressing right  or  left  cursor  keys.  Press  the  down  cursor  key
(CTRL-J/II+)  to  move ro TYPE OF DIVE. Press the right or left cursor
keys until the dive  you  want  to  perform  for  the  selected  round
flashes.  You  can pre-set up to ten rounds. Remember to set the round
back to 1 if you want to start at round 1.  Press  ESC  when  you  are
ready to begin the diving sequence. 

 If you fail to perform the dive announced, you will get a FAILED DIVE
message  and receive no points, even if the dive was done well. If you
complete the dive you announced, the judges will add a bonus of 10% to
the score for pre-calling the dive. 

       CHANGING PLAYERS

 To switch to another player press ESC-9. 




WEIGHTLIFTING
-------------

 - Your weightlifting power is in your thighs.  You  can  control  the
thigh muscles with the UP and DOWN keys. 

 -  Start  with  lighter weights- 45 kg is the lightest; 300 kg is the
heaviest, until you develop weightlifting skills. Timing  is  critical
and changes as you increase or decrease the weight. 

 -  If  you  watch weightlifters in action during competition, you may
notice that the lifters develop precise rythm as they  lift  all  that
weight. 

 -  To  obtain this rythm, press the DOWN and UP keys, pausing briefly
to rest and gather strength at critical moments. 

 - In the two-hand snatch, reach down, pull on the barbell, then  bend
down  slightly  to split the legs when the weight reaches chest level.
Steady yourself and then thrust the  weight  up  extending  your  arms
overhead.  (You  will  be  making a total of four down and up motions-
DOWN-UP-DOWN-UP.)

 - In the clean and jerk, first lift the barbell up to hip  level  and
then drop down into a squating position. Pause slightly and strengthen
your  legs  (up)  as  you  hold the weight at shoulder level. Pause to
summon  more  power.  Drop  down  slightly  to  bend  your  knees  and
immediately  push  up to center the weight in front of your nose. Push
down to split your legs and extend your arms. Steady  the  weight  and
push for the final thrust. (You will be making a total of eight up and
down motions- DOWN-UP-DOWN-UP pause DOWN-UP-DOWN-UP.)

 -  One  player  will  continue lifting until you switch to the second
player by pressing ESC-9. 

       CHANGING WEIGHTS

 To change the amount of weight on a barbell, first enter control mode
by pressing ESC-6. The weight box will flash. Use the left cursor  key
to  decrease the weight and press the right cursor key to increase the
weight. Hiting these keys will change the weights in 2 1/2 k59QM9  The
minimum amount of weight is 45 kg, and the maximum is 300 kg. 

       CHANGING EVENTS

 To  switch  from  one  weightlifting event to another, press ESC-6 to
enter control mode. Press the up and down cursor keys until the  event
flashes.  Press  the  left and right cursor keys until the name of the
other event appears. Press the ESC key to leave control mode and go to
the new event. 

       CHECKING RECORDS
