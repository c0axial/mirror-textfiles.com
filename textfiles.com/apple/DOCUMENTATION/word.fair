Word Fair
By: Carl Steadman

The object of this brain teaser is to find all the smaller words in the title words.  Sounds easy, but for most of us it won't be.  If you can't figure out all the words in one sitting, don't worry.  The program saves your progress each time you play. 

Further documentation is available in the program.

Happy word hunting!


EDITOR'S NOTE: There is the possibility that you will get a DISK FULL error on this program when it attempts to save data to disk.  When UpTime is pieced together we put as much information as possible on the disk.  If you should get a DISK FULL error copy the UpTime disk onto another disk and delete some of the files (not the ones listed below).
