 This program is offered free of charge.  It is not, however, public
 domain.  There is a distinction!
 
 Following are some VERY brief notes on the ANIX operating system.  This
 version of ANIX is a shell for ProDOS/8 (or ProDOS 1.x.1 etc), and runs
 on a II+, //e or IIgs.  A nicely printed manual with a disk is available
 for $25.00 (printing and mailing costs) from
 
          HAL Labs
          18942 Dallas
          Perris, CA 92370
 
 The manual is 200 pages+, and the disk has source code for many of the
 extrinsics.  If attention warrants it, I can post the manual; however, it
 would take hours to download, and cost you lots.  Hobbe's choice.  If you
 want to print your own manual, it is available on disk for $7.50 (one
 disk with ANIX, extrinsics and manual).
 
 
 Now, on to the good stuff!
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A Brief History:
 
 The original ANIX (version 1.0) was a shell for DOS 3.3, written by
 Randall Hyde to support his Lazer Pascal and other projects.  The name
 is derived from
                      Apple  uNIX
 which is not to say that it is UNIX.  It supported I/O redirection, EXEC
 files with parameters, user-written extrinsics (utilities) etc.
 
 The current ANIX v2.2 is a shell for ProDOS/8, also written by Randall
 Hyde (and modified by yours truly) mainly to provide an environment for
 the LISA v3.1 assembler.  It also supports I/O redirection
 
      =PRINT FILE >OUTFILE
      =PRINT FILE >.P                 {printer}
      =PRINT <.C  >FILE               {from COM to a file}
 
 (PRINT is an extrinsic used to print text files).
 
 ANIX v2.x has replaceable console drivers, so it works the same with
       Apple 40 column
       Apple 80 column
       Videx and Ultraterm  80x24, 80x48, 128x24
       Wizard 80 column
 It has a fairly complete cursor editing package (insert/delete char,
 insert/delete line, clear EOLN/EOP, etc) that is consistent across any
 video device that has a console driver written for it
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 To use ANIX:
 
 Make a disk with
 
          PRODOS                       {your version of ProDOS}
          ANIX.SYSTEM                  {the ANIX system}
          EXTRINSICS                   {make a directory for extrinsics}
              PRINT                        {put extrinsics in here}
              COPY
              INIT
              etc etc
 
 ANIX is a command-line processor, so anything you type will first be
 processed internally; if it is an intrinsic (internal command) like
        CATALOG      {or CAT}
        PREFIX
        DELETE
        ONLINE
        SAVE
 etc, then ANIX will execute the command and return to the prompt.
 Otherwise, it will look for an extrinsic (external command) on the disk.
 It first looks in the current directory, then it looks in the directory
 called EXTRINSICS on the root of the current volume.
 
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Intrinsic commands
 
   Notes:  all char output is to standard out (may be redirected)
           all char input is from standard in (may be redirected)
           all numbers (addresses, etc) are in HEX
 
 BRK
    transfer control to Apple monitor
       note: on IIgs, do a "3<ctrlP>" to reset video hooks
       to return to ANIX, do A003G (in bank 00!)
 
 CATALOG <pathname>
 
    do catalog of directory <pathname>, or (if <pathname> is omitted),
    of current prefixed directory
 
 CLOSE
 
    will close any open files (if an error left some open)
 
 DATE
 
    prints the current date
 
 DELETE <pathname>
 
    delete <pathname>.  Currently, will not delete a non-empty directory
 
 EXEC <pathname>
 
    execute text commands from the text file <pathname>.  Continues until
    error or end of file
 
 LOAD <pathanme> <addr>
 
    loads <pathname> at <addr>.  If <addr> is omitted, will load file at
    address in AUXTYPE (usually the save address).
 
 LOCK <switches> <pathname>
 
    sets various lock attributes for <pathname>
       =LOCK -rw MYFILE                    {lock read and write access}
       =LOCK MYFILE                        {lock all except read access}
 
 ONLINE
 
    lists all volumes online, and slots where they are located
 
 PREFIX <pathanme>
 
    sets system prefix to <pathname> or (if blank) shows current prefix
 
 RENAME <oldpath> <newpath>
 
    rename <oldpath> to be <newpath>.  Will not move file between
    subdirectories.
 
 RUN <addr>
 
    will do a JSR to the given address.
 
 SAVE <pathname> <addr> <len>
 
    save file on disk from memory, starting with <addr>, and file length
    <len>.
 
 SYSSAVE <pathname> <addr> <len>
 
    similar, except that instead of making a BIN file, it makes a SYS
    file
 
 TIME
 
    prints the current time
 
 UNLOCK
 
    unlock the specified file attributes.  See LOCK.
 
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 ANIX supports the idea of logical devices.  All disk devices are named
 
             .dN
 
 By default
 
     .d1    disk in slot 6, drive 1
     .d2      "   " slot 6, drive 2
     .d3            slot 5, drive 1
     .d4            slot 5, drive 2
     .d5            slot 7, drive 1
     .d6            slot 7, drive 2
     .d7            slot 2, drive 1
     .d8            slot 2, drive 2
 
 If you didn't know (or care to know) the name of a disk, you could
 just say
 
       =CATALOG .d1
 
 to get a catalog of the disk in drive .d1.  The drive convention is
 supported in all ANIX intrinsics, and extrinsics can use it by calling
 the routine PARSENAM (which also does all checking for valid ProDOS
 naming etc).
 
 The printer device is .P
 The communication device is .C
 
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Extrinsics
 
 
 PRINT <switches> <file1> <switches> <file2> ...
 
    will print any number of files to standard out, with many options
        -P  issue page feed
        -#  number each line
        -(n1:n2)  print lines from n1 to n2
        -[c1:c2]  print columns from c1 to c2
    refer to ANIX manual (or type in bad input and PRINT will prompt you)
 
 COPY <pathname> <pathname>
 
    will copy a file (or files with wildcard specification)
    The "=" wildcard will copy all files that match without prompting
    The "?" wildcard will prompt before each file
 
 INIT drive
 
    Will format a disk in drive specified.
 
 ED
 
     A simple line editor for text files.  Has
        Insert
        Delete
        List
        Modify
        LOad
        SAve
     Press <ctrl-2> to exit insert mode
 
 PROMF <file>
 
    print contents of OMF file, giving headers, record info, etc
    very crude so far
 
 FREESPC <drive>
 
    give free space info about a drive
 
 SETUP.ANIX
 
    allow you to edit default ANIX parameters
 
 MAKDIR
 
    create a sub-directory
 
 ADU
