     %%%  NCE, in a tavern on the waterfront, an old salt whispered to
you the tale of the Seven Bishops Christian men who had been blown far
off course into an unknown realm and who  established  seven  Kingdoms
whose  splendor  ranked with the reign of Solomon. Since that time you
have dreamed of little else. 

Now at long last you have been  granted  the  resources  necessary  to
mount  an expedition. To be sure, the Court's ministers are interested
only  in  surpassing  Portugal's  maritime  strength  and  controlling
commerce  to  and  from  the  Orient.   They  do not know of your real
motives. But no matter. The expedition is yours to  command,  and  you
feel  certain  that  adventure beyond all imagining, and riches beyond
all dreams of avarice, are in your grasp.

                         The Court

Not every visit to the palace will  fill  your  heart  with  the  same
exultation  as  the  first.   Nevertheless, here you must return - for
recognition of your  accomplishments,  for  the  glory  and  power  of
titles,  perhaps  for  more  gold  desperately needed to continue your
search. Alas, need alone will not guarantee another  audience  to  any
save novices. 


                              Home

Here, in private, may contemplate your successes (or lick your wounds)
and study the maps you've created on your journeys.  Here you may also
judge the progress you're making towards your goals - how much and how
many  rivers you've explored, how many natives you've encountered, and
how many special landmarks (great lakes, lust  jungles,  etc.)  you've
found.   Finally,  you  may learn how many missions you've established
and how much more gold you've found than you've spent. 

The Court considers all the categories  listed,  except  missions  and
lives,  in granting titles. The highest rank, Viceroy, is reserved for
those who can achieve an overall rating  of  at  least  50%  by  1540.
(Losing  an  expedition  completely  -  dying - costs you the maps and
discoveries made since the last time you stopped by the pub.  It  also
costs  you  the  opportunity  to  get  future  credit  for  all  those
discoveries save the discovery of land, and you lose a year and a half
of your valuable time.)


                              The Outfitters

It is here that you will spend your gold to equip and  provision  your
expeditions.  As  your  experience  grows, learn to choose effectively
among the ways you can invest your wealth. Do you plan to  trade?  How
many  goods  will you need? Do you aim to conquer? What size army must
you assemble? Can you find food? How much should you  take?  Find  the
answers that fit your style of exploration. Or prepare yourself for an
unhappy relationship with the Court and for expeditions barely able to
survive - hardly the marks of explorers destined to become Viceroys. 


                              Player Tip

Food  is  bought  and bartered for in relation to the number of men in
your expedition. Decide on the number of men you want first,  then  on
how  many  weeks'  worth  of food you want for them. To get a feel for
this relationship, play around with the two quantities the  first  few
times you're give the opportunity. 


                              The Pub

Wise  conquistadors will stop by here after every trip to record their
maps and discoveries. Losing also all the  maps  and  discoveries  you
made on your last three trips is heartrending.

                              The Voyage

When  you leave port, mark well the indications of your voyage and how
they continually change. On the screen window, north is always at  the
top,  west to the left. At the top of the screen you see the month and
year and the number of vessels still in your expedition. To  the  left
is  the  size  of  your army and the number of weeks you can feed that
many mouths with the food on hand. To the right is the ledger of  your
cargo  of goods and gold. At the bottom is your speed and the depth of
the water. 

Your ship's cartographer can help you but little on this part of  your
search.  Choose  the  "view map" option to learn your latitude and pay
attention to the passage of time. By  such  dead  reckoning  you  will
learn to cross the ocean with the least expense of food and life. 

There are many perils in the uncharted waters beyond Spain. Men die of
scurvey  or  of  storms  in which no one can hear their last cries for
help. Those same storms can blow you far off course and cost you vital
time. Your supply of food dwindles as you ply your way across the vast
ocean. Wander too long in search of  landfall,  and  you  will  surely
perish. 


                    From the Historical Record

Columbus' critics were right. If there had been no American continent,
no  Spanish  fleet  of  that era could have completed the ten thousand
mile expedition across the Atlantic  to  Japan.  They  couldn't  carry
enough food. 

The  food they could carry was no treat - a grim mixture of tough salt
mat, hardtack, and dried vegetables. Meals were  cooked  in  a  wooden
firebox embedded in a heap of sand on deck. Sour wine and
 stale water completed the repast. 


                    Discovery and Exploration

Bring  your  ships  into  safe  mooring  carefully and learn from your
costly mistakes. Resolve not  to  lose  more  ships  by  inattentively
running  around  or to the same shoals or shallows. Remember also that
if you leave your ships unattended while you set off on long journeys,
the sailors who man the ships (who are not  included  in  your  roster
count) just might sail away before your return. 

As  you  move  over the land think of all who will bless your name for
your discoveries.  The  Court  and  merchants  want  gold  and  trade;
sailors,  other explorers and scholars will be eager to see your maps.
Others in the Universities will be anxious to hear of the  surface  of
the land and of the people who live in it. And the Holy Church is ever
solicitous to save unenlightened souls. 

The  Church  has  a powerful ally in your need for food and someone to
help carry it. Unless you find and  learn  to  deal  with  some  local
inhabitants,  you're  not  going to get very far in your quest for the
fabulously wealthy cities you hope to find. 


                              Playing Tips

1. Imagine a world  without  roads  and  you'll  begin  to  grasp  the
improtance of rivers to the to the explorers in the 16th Century. Your
own progress also depends on your use of rivers - a moderate pace on a
river moves you as fast as a reckless pace on land. 

2.  Your  computer  will  build  maps for your as you go. Consult them
frequently. (Your positions is always approximately  in  the  center.)
You  want to build pictures in your head and perhaps even keep journal
notes of what happened where. Your goal is to be able to find your way
back to useful places and avoid dangerous ones. (one  screen  measures
120 miles on a side on the exploration surface and 960 miles on a side
on your maps.)

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

                    Making Contact with the Natives

In any new region, where the natives live will not be visible (save to
the novice) unless you take the time to stop and look for signs.  When
you  have  spotted a signal and move to enter a village, think also of
what signal you mean to  send  as  you  go  in.  Reckless  aggression?
Cautious  friendliness?  Open-handed generosity? The decision is yours
alone. And its implications and consequences are yours alone to bear. 

There will be considerable variety in the natives you encounter.  Some
will  be  more  populous,  some more credulous, some more hostile, and
some more complex combinations  of  those  attributes.  If  you  would
survive  and prosper, learn to use your ears and eyes for clues to the
natives' moods and the patterns in their responses to your actions and
combinations of actions. 


                              Trade or Conquest

Both approaches are available  to  you.  Both,  if  successful,  bring
valuable  bearers  as well as goods.  To trade, as the natives will be
quick  to  tell  (if  your  gait  and  perhaps  your  generosity  seem
suitable),  you must deal directly with the chief. He always stands in
the center of the village until and aggressive threat  causes  him  to
vanish or yield in despair. 

Conquest  is  quick, but it consumes lives and leaves bitter memories.
Trading is safer, but it is also slower and requires many goods.  Take
whatever  actions your heart and mind tell you to take - and attend to
what you learn about yourself in the bargain.  And  harken.  None  but
novices  should  always  believe  everything their bearers tell them -
especially bearers far from home on an expedition whose food is  going
stale.  And  consider  that  the  natives  remember long and well what
treatment they receive at your hands. Let your  future  dreams  temper
your present schemes. 


                    From the Historical Record

On  his  final  voyage,  Columbus found himself stranded in Jamaca. At
first the natives supplied food; but the voracious  appetites  of  the
explorers  -  they consumed 15 to 20 times as much food as the natives
did themselves - soon put them out of favor. The Spanish  were  slowly
starving. 

Columbus devised a stratagem. His almanac predicted a total eclipse of
the  moon  on  the  last night of February 1504. Columbus summoned the
native chieftain and announced that Almighty God was  displeased  with
their treatment of His chosen emissary. If food was not brought to the
Spanish, the Lord would darken the moon forever. 

The  eclipse began at moonrise. Soon the entire village ran howling to
Columbus' ship, imploring him to halt the destruction. Columbus waited
in his cabin until the full eclipse phase had passed, then emerged and
took credit for a successful intercession on their behalf. 

Columbus and his men enjoyed an ample food supply for the duration  of
their journey. 


                    Establishing Forts and Missions

Both  trade  and  conquest  can bring you the opportunity to establish
more than a thinly  manned  fort,  and  how  few  to  avoid  and  over
garrisoned armory, will depend on the size of the native population at
the site. Let the pictures signifying fort and missions be your guide.
And  let  experience tell you how eager the conquered are to throw off
their yokes during your absence. 


                    From the Historical Record

At times the natives were only too wiling for the Spanish to establish
armed garrisons in their own land. Gudcanagari, chieftian of a  Haitan
tribe,  implored  Columbus  to establish a colony so that Spanish guns
could help him defeat his rivals on the island. Columbus had  his  own
reasons  for  wanting  to  found  such  a colony. Thus was Villa de la
Navidad (Christmas Town) the first settlement and first armed fort  in
the New World. 


                              Playing Tips

1. Pay attention to the time of year and to your latitude.  Toward the
far  north  and  south,  the  effects of climate become visible in the
fall, winter and spring. And, since how much food  you'll  find  in  a
village  depends  on  when  the  last  harvest was, you'll find paying
attention to the seasons materially rewarding as well as aesthetically
pleasing. 

2. Don't underestimate native communications. Some can spread word  of
your  activities  to  cities you haven't visited yet.  And bearers can
show you the location of other settlements - and of treasures, if  you
pause long enough to listen to them. 

3.  A  mission  can  supply nearby ships and cause the sailors to wait
patiently for the return of the landing party, provided care has  been
taken to inform the mission inhabitants of the location of the ships. 


                              1540 and Beyond

Within  50  years of Columbus' first voyage, the Spanish had conquered
the  New  World's  most  advanced  civilizations  and  had  begun   to
consolidate  one half of the territory into a colonial empire.  Center
stage began to pass from the Spanish Conquistadors to the traders  and
settlers of many nations who followed. 

You  may  continue  your  explorations after 1540 if you wish, but you
will receive no more titles from the Court or  other  recognition  for
your  efforts.  If  you  wish to see the complete map of the territory
you've been exploring so you can begin anew with a New World, see  the
reference card section of this doc file.

                    Notes on the World Maker

Calling  brand new New Worlds "random continents" conveys something of
their challenge and variability, but it  doesn't  do  justice  to  the
sophistication  of  the program that produces them. New Worlds are not
simply drawn willy-nilly. They  conform  to  geological  and  cultural
principles built into the program code. 

There  is,  for  instance,  a plate tectonics model consulted for each
creation. Mountain ranges are generated where  the  plates  bump  into
each  other. And secondary ranges (like the Allegheny mountains on the
historical map) may be created as well. 

The program also consults a cultural dissemination model for its work.
The influences of major civilizations are presumed to spread  outward.
Consequently,   pueblo   dwellers  generally  will  be  found  between
city-states and primitive agriculturists. The  model  will  allow  for
varying  levels  of  this  influence  and  can thus produce occasional
continent  arrangements  which  have  no  Incan  level  civilizations.
Alternately,  it  can make a very rich and powerful arrangements, ones
which, like 16th-Century Japan, are highly  civilized  from  coast  to
coast. 


                         Competitive Play

Though only one player may use and save a position on a particular map
disk,  competitive  opportunities  may  be  created  by using 2 of the
program disk to make multiple copies of a map disk. Several  different
players  might  then  explore  the  same  terrain,  comparing progress
periodically or simply declaring the winner to be the player with  the
highest  totals  and  title  by  some agreed upon date. (Note: You can
start a new game with a map disk without disturbing a game  previously
saved  to  that  disk,  but  you cannot save more than one game on any
given disk.
