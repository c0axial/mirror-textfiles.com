UNPACK DISK
...........

   This option will allow you to unpack a DDD file (PRODOS type $DD files).


A) Even before choosing this option, insert your disk containing the DDD file,
   as the first thing DDD will do is display the volume window. Once again, use
   of the of command mentionned previously in the "STANDARD DIRECTORY
   COMMANDS". Choose the DDD file you wish to unpack and press RETURN.
   D.D.DeLUXE will then proceed by verifying that the selected file was indeed
   packed with D.D.DeLUXE. If the DDD file that you wished to unpack was not
   compatible with the version of D.D.DeLUXE that you are using, then
   D.D.DeLUXE will prompt you to use a most recent version of the program.


B) The next step consists in identifying the location of your target disk, once
   again D.D.DeLUXE will show you the inventory window of all your connected
   5.25, 3.5 800k and 1600k devices, just as in the pack option. Just choose
   one.

   NOTES:
   o   If you have no drives available to unpack the DDD file, then D.D.DeLUXE
       will warn you, For example, if the packed file is a 1600k 3.5" disk
       and you do not have that type of devices.
   
   o   If you only have one drive that can unpack the file, then D.D.DeLUXE
       will skip step B, since it will evidently assume that you will want to
       unpack on that device!


C) Now, D.D.DeLUXE will ask you wether or not you wish to format your target
   disk (that's the disk where you will unpack your disk onto, not the other
   way around!). By default, the response will be "YES", if you already know
   that your target disk has already been formatted in a standard way, (PRODOS,
   DOS 3.3, PASCAL, CP/M or other standar format), then you do not need to
   reformat your disk, you can then answer "NO".  Just remember that your
   target disk must have been formatted at least once and that, in a normal
   method (i.e. not a protected disk). In any other cases, you will have to
   format your target disk.


D) D.D.DeLUXE now proceeds in unpacking your DDD file:

a) 1 drive operation:
        Once again, if your source and target devices are the same, D.D.DeLUXE
   will assume that only one drive will be used to unpack, you will be then
   asked to alternatiovelly insert the target and source disks.

b) 2 devices operation:
        If your source and destination disks do not reside on the same device,
   then D.D.DeLUXE will assume that you are unpacking using 2 different
   devices, will ask you to insert both the disks to be used at their
   respective selected locations and start unpacking!

c) Information displayed:
   As it unpacks, D.D.DeLUXE will display the following information:

            -> "DDD status" :    Will tell you what DDD is doing
            -> "Block #"    :    the block number that DDD is currently
                                 writing on the target disk.
            -> "Total block":    The total number of blocks to unpack
            -> "Checksum8"  :    Since DDD loads 8 blocks of data at the same
                                 time to decompress them, the checksum8 is
                                 the cumulative checksum of these 8 blocks
                                 written to disk.
            -> "message window": The personnal message of whoever packed the
                                 disk.
            -> "Packed by"  :    The name of whoever packed the disk.
            -> "Date of packing":The date the disk was packed.

d)      When D.D.DeLUXE has finished, it will display you the "menu line"
   (last line of the personnal message).  This line will also be displayed on
   your main menu.
        If your DDD file has been altered or destroyed (it only takes a lone
   bad bite!), while unpacking D.D.DeLUXE always verifies the checksum of the
   file being unpacked against the checksum stored on the DDD file. This way,
   you are always sure that the unpacked file matches the original.
        If an error was detected in the checksum, D.D.DeLUXE will stop
   unpacking immediately and indicate to you the last checksum of the DDD file.
   (the checksum8 parameter of the status window indicates the checksum of the
   8 blocks stored on the disk). In this case, there is nothing you can do with
   that packed DDD file.

Voila! You have just unpacked your DDD file!




................

PRODOS COMMANDS
...............

     This option will allow you to catalog a directory, delete files, create
sub-directories, rename files, convert DDD files to type $DD,
view a text file, view DDD file informations and finaly, copy files from a
directory to another.

     Once again, as you select this option, D.D.DeLUXE will display the volume
window, as usual the "STANDARD DIRECTORY COMMANDS" described above will apply.
Furthermore, D.D.DeLUXE will always default the first catalog to FULL mode.

     On top of the usual commands, the following additional commands are
available (to activate these commands, use the arrow keys to position your
scroll bar on the file requested):


A) CTRL-C: CREATE A DIRECTORY

     This option will allow you to create a sub-directory in the working
directory. As you press CTRL-C, D.D.DeLUXE will as you to enter the name of the
directory to be created, you are allowed 15 characters maximum, then press
Return and it's done! Your subdirectory has been created.


B) CTRL-T: CONVERT TO DDD FILE

     This command will allow you to convert a DDD file that would be of a type
TXT (text file) or any other file type to a normal DDD file type $DD. This
command may be neccessary in instances where your modem transmission program
only creates files of type TXT (or other file type like BIN). Once the file
received, you must use this option to change this file type back to the usual
$DD type.
     Most of the time, this command will never be used as the majority of
contemporary modem transmission programs preserve the file type. If you ever
have doubts that a TXT file (or other file type than $DD) was actually packed
with DDD, one hint is to use for the usual DDD suffix (.A, .B or .C).
     You can try this command on any type of files. Prior to convert that file
to type $DD, D.D.DeLUXE will verify that this file was indeed packed with
D.D.DeLUXE, so have no fear that D.D.DeLUXE will ever convert a file that is
not a DDD file.


C) CTRL-V: VIEW TEXT FILE

     This command will allow you to view a text file on the screen. As you
choose this option, D.D.DeLUXE will start displaying that file on the screen.
D.D.DeLUXE will automatically display that file in page mode, when the display
window is full, D.D.DeLUXE will stop further displaying until a key has been
pressed on the keyboard (any one except ESC). Once the entire text file has
been viewed, D.D.DeLUXE will go back to the directory where you were prior to
press CTRL-V. Note that you could always exit from that command before having
viewed the entire file, by pressing CTRL-Q (quit).
     Officially, you are only allowed to view any file of type TXT, but
un-officially, you could also view  Appleworks file type AWP, but right now the
text will not be formatted exactly like Appleworks would. The reason is that
Appleworks support is not officially implemanted in this revision, but will be
in a subsequent release of D.D.DeLUXE.


D) CTRL-V: VIEW DDD FILE INFORMATIONS

     You may use this option on any DDD file.  Take note that it's the same
control key as "VIEW TEXT FILE".  D.D.DeLUXE identify automaticly which
command you wish to use by checking the file type of the file (TXT or DDD).
     This command is identical to the "VIEW LAST DDD INFO" command. Once
D.D.DeLUXE has supplied you with the informations concerning the DDD file, it
will go back to the directory where you were. Note that you can also save these
informations in a TXT file, just like "VIEW LAST DDD INFO" by pressing CTRL-S.


E) CTRL-D: DELETE FILE

     This option will allow you to delete any file in the working directory. As
you press CTRL-D, the file is deleted! Note that to delete a file type DIR,
indicating a sub directory, this sub-directory must be empty of any files. In
the eventuallity that the directory containned files, you would have first to
position into that sub directory, then delete each files containned, one by
one. In situations like that, the use of a commercial program such as Copy ][+
maybe more appropriate.


F) CTRL-R: RENAME FILE

     This option will allow you to rename any PRODOS file. As you press CTRL-R,
D.D.DeLUXE will prompt you for the new name of the file, as usual you are
restricted to 15 characters maximum. As you press Return, the file has been
renamed and D.D.DeLUXE would have refreshed the volume window accordingly.


G) CTRL-P: COPY FILE

     This option will allow you to copy a file from the working directory to
another directoty. As you press CTRL-P, D.D.DeLUXE will display the volume
window, as usual, the "STANDARD DIRECTORY COMMANDS" are available. Just choose
the target directory, press the space bar and D.D.DeLUXE will begin copying the
file to its intended destination. When the copy has finished, press any key
and D.D.DeLUXE will put you at the target directory where you stored the copy
file.
     Note that you can copy a file to another directory on the same device as
long that it is not in the same directory as the working directory. Also note
that you cannot copy a directory, copy an entire disk to another, or copy a
file from one disk to another using only one drive, for operations like that,
the use of a disk utility program such as COPY ][+ would be more adequate.
     You can use this option to do your "housecleaning" in your file, but for
users having only one drive and a ram card, this would become a very useful
utility. For example, you could pack into the ram disk and then transfer the
packed file from the ram disk to another disk. The oposite is also true,
transfer the DDD file to the ram disk, then unpack onto another disk. No more
disk swapping! (and you don't have to quit D.D.DeLUXE to run a copy program).




..................

A) EDIT MY MESSAGE
..................

     This option will allow you to edit your personal 10 lines message as well
as the menu 11th line. Each line consists of 38 characters. You will be using
the built-in D.D.DeLUXE MINI EDITOR to compose your message, here is a rundown
of the various commands of this editor:

          CTRL-J    : (or down arrow), move cursor 1 line down
          CTRL-K    : (or up arrow), move cursor 1 line up
          ->        : move cursor right 1 character
          <-        : move cursor left 1 character
          RETURN    : move cursor 1 line down and position the cursor
                      at the start of the first character
          DEL       : delete character at left of cursor
          CTRL-D    : delete character at cursor
   TAB or CTRL-I    : toggle insert mode on/off
          CTRL-N    : toggle normal or inverse mode
          CTRL-Z    : center the line
          CTRL-F    : put cursor at first character of the line
          CTRL-L    : put cursor at last character of the line
 CLEAR or CTRL-X    : Clear line
          CTRL-E    : Erase the entire message

For ][+ users, the following keys have been added:

          CTRL-R    : Prints the underscore character "_".
          CTRL-T    : Prints the backslash character  "\".
          CTRL-Y    : Prints the square bracket character "[".

     These three special characters have been added since the standard Apple
][+ cannot generate these characters directly from the keyboard, while being
able to display them.

     Note that you can type the characters in normal mode or in inverse mode.
This should allow you to be creative in your message. Note also that the insert
mode can be turned off by using the CTRL-I command again or by pressing one of
the arrow keys or Return.

     On your status line, D.D.DeLUXE will display the current insert mode (on
or off) as well as the character mode (normal or inverse). Furthermore, if you
are currently using 80 columns, D.D.DeLUXE will display an index of the various
commands available to you at the left of the window. Of course, if you are
using 40 columns display, this index will not be seen on the left of the
window, but underneath it.

     Once you have finished typing your personal message (your creation), press
ESC to return to the main menu. You can save this message for future use by
going to the configuration option, D.D.DeLUXE will save it along with all other
configuration parameters. This is the message that will appear as part of your
packed file the next time you pack a file. Note that it is not neccessary to go
to the configuration option if you only wish the personal message you just
typed to affect the files you will be packing in the current session, this is
only if you wish to have this message appear as the default message every time
you start D.D.DeLUXE.




..................

VIEW LAST DDD INFO
..................

     This option will allow you to read the message from the last disk you have
unpacked or the message from the last packed DDD file where you used the "VIEW
DDD FILE INFORMATIONS" (from PRODOS COMMANDS), whichever came last.

D.D.DeLUXE will display the following informations:

     o  the name of the DDD file
     o  the personal message of that file
     o  the menu line
     o  the name of whoever packed that file
     o  the date of packing
     o  the version of D.D.DeLUXE used in packing (>= 4.0)
     o  the type of device to be used in unpacking (5.25", 3.5" 800k or 1600k).
     o  the version of D.D.DeLUXE which the file can be unpack 

     Once you have finished reading these informations, press any key to return
to the main menu, or if you wish to save the information currently appearing on
the screen, you can do so by pressing CTRL-S (save message).

Here's how to proceed to save all these informations:

     Insert the disk where you wish to store that file, then press on CTRL-S,
D.D.DeLUXE will then show you the volume window. You will then only have to use
one of the standard D.D.DeLUXE directory commands, as mentionned previously, to
choose the directory where the text file should be saved. When you are at the
directory you wish to save the file, press the space bar. All the informations
appearing on the screen will be saved in that text file.  The filename will
start by the prefix "I.<filename>" (I for Info file).




....................

OPTIMIZE PRODOS DISK
....................

     This option will allow you to erase all the free blocks from a PRODOS
disk. What use could that serve?  Simple, it will just speed up the packing by
making the packed file smaller. An unused block still represents data, an
erased block represents the absence of data. While it is not neccessary to back
up your disk prior to optimizing it, you may elect to take this wise
precaution, just in case! Remember that the optimization option will only be
available to PRODOS disks.  DOS 3.3, PASCAL and CP/M disks will not be
optimized.
     As you choose this option, D.D.DeLUXE will show you the volume display
window, but this time, you will not see the directory window. Using the arrow
keys, select the volume you wish to optimize and press Return. Note that if you
attempt to optimize a non-PRODOS disk, D.D.DeLUXE will refuse to do so. You can
optimize all types of disks (ram disks, harddisks, 3.5, etc..) as long as it is
PRODOS.
     D.D.DeLUXE is now ready to optimize your disk. To start it, just press any
key. D.D.DeLUXE will display an information window with the following
parameters:

   -> "Total blocks"     :  Number of blocks to be scanned to optimize the
                            whole volume.
   -> "Scanning block #" :  The block number D.D.DeLUXE is presently analyzing.
   -> "Blocks optimized" :  The cumulative number of blocks that D.D.DeLUXE has
                            already optimized.

     Note that the "blocks optimized" are only the free blocks that had not
already been optimized (i.e. contains all zeros), they would not be considered.
When the optimization routine has completed, your disk has been optimized and
is now ready to be packed.




..................

FORMAT PRODOS DISK
..................

     This option will allow you to format any one of your devices connected to
your Apple, these include Ramdisk, harddisk, floppy 5.25", 3.5" 800k and 1600k
drives, PC transporter 5.25" disk, etc..

     When you choose this option, D.D.DeLUXE will give you a display window
listing all devices connected to your Apple, using the arrow keys, just choose
the devices to be formatted and press Return. D.D.DeLUXE then verifies that the
selected devices have a disk inside them and will ask you to confirm that you
indeed wish to format them. By default, the answer to this question is "NO", so
choose "YES" and press Return. As the formatting is completed, press any key to
return to the main menu.

NOTES:

  a)  If you wish to format a ram disk, depending on the type of ram disk, you
      must evidently have loaded its PRODOS driver before starting D.D.DeLUXE.
      You do not need drivers for the standard /RAM on the //e, //c and //gs,
      or /RAM5 on the //GS.
  b)  If you wish to format a harddisk, it is possible that the hard disk could
      not be formatted, just as it could work.  This is due to the peculiar
      method of some hard disk that requires that a special code be sent to its
      controller, this seems to be a protection built in by the hard disk
      manufacturer to ensure against accidental formatting of such devices.
  c)  If you wish to format a 5.25" floppy disk, D.D.DeLUXE will immediately
      verify, after formatting, that it has been formatted correctly. This is
      due to the fact that D.D.DeLUXE utilizes the Hyper-Format routine, a
      routine that does not check for errors, so we are playing it safe!
  d)  Note that, in the event where you wanted to format a 5.25" disk while
      unpacking, D.D.DeLUXE would not verify the formatting as it would pick up
      formatting errors as it unpacks to it.
  e)  D.D.DeLUXE does not store the standard PRODOS boot on the formatted disk.
      This implies that disks formatted with D.D.DeLUXE are unbootable. All
      D.D.DeLUXE uses as a boot code, is a very small message in block #0 and
      the rest is full of zeroes. Consequently, a disk formatted with
      D.D.DeLUXE can only be used to store data files (such as DDD files).
  f)  If you are using an Apple //gs and that you are formatting a 3.5 disk
      on a 3.5 Apple Drive, and if your diskette has bad blocks on it, then
      D.D.DeLUXE will eject it immediatly upon detection of the error.
  g)  If your disk to be formated is brand new, D.D.DeLUXE will not ask you
      if you want really format it, it will format it directly.




.............

CHECKSUM DISK
.............

     This option will allow you to do a checksum of a 5.25" floppy or 800k or
1600k 3.5" disks. When you select this option, D.D.DeLUXE will display the
checksum window including the following informations:

  -> Block number   : This is the first of the 8 blocks of the checksum, as you
                      already know, DDD computes the checksum every 8 blocks.
                      For example, if the display shows "Block8: 32", then the
                      checksum corresponds to block number 32 to 39 inclusive.
  -> Checksum       : Checksum of these 8 blocks.
  -> Last block     : This is the last block # to be reached
  -> Total checksum : Checksum of all blicks on disk.


     When D.D.DeLUXE has finished to compute the entire disk's checksum, you
will have the total checksum, in hexadecimal, at the bottom of the screen. Note
that if you wish, at any time, to stop the scrolling window (maybe to write
down each checksum), you can do so by pressing the space bar once, you would
restart it by pressing it again. Also note that you can checksum any type of
Apple disk, it may be PRODOS, DOS 3.3, PASCAL, CP/M or any other valid format,
even if we mention the term "block" to compute the checksum8.

     This option is not neccessary to pack or unpack disks, D.D.DeLUXE
automatically do so for you. It's just one more utility at your disposal, if
you should ever decide to check the checsums yourself.




.........

CONFIGURE
.........

     This option will allow you to customize D.D.DeLUXE according to your
personal tastes and hardware. Following is a list of the various parameters
available to you:


A) DISABLE 5.25":

     D.D.DeLUXE will only ask you this question if you are using a //GS. A lot
of //GS users no longer utilize their 5.25", in which case you may elect to
disable them from DDD. This will mean that D.D.DeLUXE will just ignore all
5.25" controllers it finds. Note that if you had disconnected your slot 6 (the
usual 5.25" controller slot), then you would have no use for this option,
unless you also had other 5.25" controllers in other slots (see configuration
#B).  The changes are made immediatly after pressing return.  It's not
necessary to save all the configuration if you want only change this option.


B) KEYCLICK:

     This option will toggle the "noise" made every tiome you press a key. Use
it according to your taste.


C) YOUR NAME:

     This is where you register your name, up to 19 characters are allowed.
This name will become your default for all further packing.


D) PACK DEFAULT DATE:

     This option should only be used if your Apple does not contain a clock
card. Basically, this date will become the default date every time you pack a
disk. To adjust this date, follow the same procedure as outlined in the PACK
function.


E) QUIT PATHNAME:

     This option will allow you to specify the default pathname to be used upon
exiting from D.D.DeLUXE. For more information on this option, check the section
"QUIT" later on in the documentation. Just remember that all pathnames must
start by "/" and that the name of the called application program must
correspond to a file type SYS.


F) SYSTEM SPEED:

     This option allows you to adjust the speed of D.D.DeLUXE according to the
speed of your CPU, for example, if you have a ZIPCHIP, chose 4Mhz, for a //GS,
chose 2.8Mhz, etc..  Why this parameter? D.D.DeLUXE will adjust the scrolling
speed, the keyclick and bell consequently.


G) SAVE YOUR MESSAGE:

     Actually, you do not have any choice! Wether you want it or not, your
personal message will be saved! This is just a reminder.


     After you have finished configuring D.D.DeLUXE, you will be asked a final
time wether you still wish to save it on disk, if you decline, you will just be
returned to the main menu. If you elected to save it, then you should insert
the disk where you have saved D.D.DeLUXE V4.0, press any key and your
configuration will be save as D.D.DELUXE.CONF. That's it! You have configured
your D.D.DeLUXE.




....

QUIT
....

     You have three methods of leaving D.D.DeLUXE, actually four if you
consider turning off the computer! When you choose this option, you will see
the default pathname as specified in your configuration along with the
following menu:

                      PRODOS.QUIT    DEFAULT     OTHER


A) PRODOS.QUIT:

     When you select this option, D.D.DeLUXE will utilize the standard QUIT
function of PRODOS (like BYE in Applesoft).  On a //gs, if you called
D.D.DeLUXE via the finder and after using D.D.DeLUXE you wish to return to
the finder, you should use this quit option.


B) DEFAULT:

     If you elect to quit to the default pathname, then D.D.DeLUXE will utilize
the pathname that you have configured, of course you will have to make sure
that the appropriate volume be online. This option will be practical if you
always use the same aplication after leaving D.D.DeLUXE, such as a
communication program.


C) OTHER:

     This option is similar to the PRODOS QUIT command but is much faster.
D.D.DeLUXE will ask you to enter the pathname of the application that you wish
to execute upon leaving. Just type the full pathname, the name of the system
file to be executed (type SYS) and press Return, D.D.DeLUXE will then load it
and execute it.




.....................

HOW TO GET MORE SPEED
.....................

     There are many ways to increase the execution speed of D.D.DeLUXE while
packing or unpacking, here are some suggestions:

a) If you use a //GS, D.D.DeLUXE switch automatically to 2.8Mhz, compressing
mechanism will then go roughly twice as fast as on 1Mhz. You could also use a
Ramdisk or a Romdisk (such as the Memory Saver) to store your DDD file. Or you
could also use a memory cache program. The speed difference is really
interesting, wether you are packing, unpacking, be it on a 5.25", 3.5", ramdisk
or hard disk. The best memory cache program is probably "DIVERSI CACHE".
Loading such a memory cache program will prove worthwile, especially if you
have many DDD files to pack or unpack.

b) If you use a ][+, //e or //c, you basically have three methods of speeding
up D.D.DeLUXE:

   1)  The first method is to use an accelerator card, such as Applied
   Engineering's Transwarp which speeds up your Apple to 3.6Mhz. The best
   accelerator is probably the ZIPCHIP from Zip Technology which increases
   speed to 4Mhz, in which case D.D.D. would pack/unpack 3 times as fast (since
   disk accesses would remain at 1Mhz).

   2)  The second method would be thru software, once again using a ramdisk.
   Note that D.D.DeLUXE is compatible with all PRODOS memory cards that fits in
   the ][+, //e or //c. You only have to load the Prodos driver before booting
   DDD. D.D.DeLUXE will then recognize your ram card, if you forgot to load the
   driver, then DDD will not recognize the extra memory. In certain rare cases,
   it is possible that there will be a conflict between the driver and DDD, in
   which case you will not be able to use your ramcard. Certain cards have Rom
   based drivers, and in such instances, no drivers require to be loaded.

   3)  You can use also a cache program if your ramdisk allows one  (check on
   the diskette that the manufacturer supplied with your RAM card)




..........

CONCLUSION
..........

     I hope that D.D.DeLUXE will please you. Louis Roy has spent countless
hours perfecting it, so be creative when you use it while composing your
personal message on each DDD file, this idea will revolutioniza the world of
packed files!

     As Louis releases new versions of his packer, be sure that they will
remain compatible to DDD 4.0, since he already reserved sufficient space for
improvement in the DDD files. He has a lot of new ideas already popping in his
mind, he only asks to program them, but for this, he needs your support
($29.95), without support, this will be the last of its kind.






===============================================================================
               MESSAGE FROM LOUIS ROY, AUTHOR of D.D.DeLUXE
===============================================================================
     Do not forget that this is a shareware program, it is a copyrighted
product of LOGIX INNOVATIONS. If you like this program and use it regularly,
you should then send $29.95 (plus $1.50 for shipping and handling) to obtain
your registered legal copy from:

               LOGIX INNOVATIONS
               2590 4th Avenue
               St-Georges
               Cte Beauce, P.Q.
               Canada   G5Y 3S8

     You will then receive your registered copy of the latest version of
D.D.DeLUXE along with its documentation (on book format). If I have enough
request, I will do a french version of this program. If you wish a french
version, send me your request by mail (or E-MAIL) with your address, your name
and your phone number.

     Understand that I need your support to be encouraged to make newer and
better versions of the extraordinary packer. Many ideas are already coming to
my head to make it even more powerful, without your support, these ideas will
never see the light of day!

     I spent hundreds, maybe thousands, hours programming this program, all
these hours, I spent in front of my //GS monitor programming in Assembler to
come up with the results you have before you, why? Only to help you, you who
are reading this release notice.

     So you have basically three moral choices:

     1) after using the program, you decide that it doesn't suit your needs
        and you must either erase all your copies or pass it on to a friend.

     2) You decide that you wish to keep the program and you mail your $29.95
        to obtain your registered copy.

     3) You decide to keep the program without sending your contribution and
        you indicate by this dishonest conduct that you cannot be trusted and
        that I should stop wasting my time for the like of you.

     So you see, this $29.95 will not kill you, but it will encourage me to
pursue further programming endeavors. Who could have foreseen that DDD 1.0
would become the standard it became? The future of D.D.DeLUXE rests with you.
