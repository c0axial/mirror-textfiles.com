         PATCH BY: DON KOENIG!


     BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM DDD ][ PRE-
SENTED TO HARD DRIVE SYSOPS WHO USE THE
SLOT/VOLUME METHOD, DDD ][  BY   DALTON
WAS PATCHED SO THAT AT BOOT UP, YOU CAN
DEFINE THE SLOT/VOLUME  OF  THE  SOURCE
AND TARGET. THIS IS EASY, BUT THERE ARE
A FEW NOTES YOU SHOULD REMEMBER  BEFORE
USING DDD ][+.

[1] WHEN DDD ][+ ASKS YOU TO INPUT THE
    VOLUME FOR EITHER  THE  SOURCE  OR
    TARGET, IT MUST *ALWAYS* BE  THREE
    CHARACTERS LONG.  EXPAMPLES:

    VOLUME 1   = 001
    VOLUME 10  = 010
    VOLUME 100 = 100

[2] IF YOU ARE NOT USING A HARD  DRIVE,
    AND WANT TO USE  DDD ][+ ,   AT THE
    VOLUME PROMPT FOR THE SOURCE    AND
    TARGET, JUST TYPE "000".  THIS WILL
    ALLOW NORMAL DDD ][ USE.

[3] BECAUSE OF HOW HARD DDD ][ WAS COM-
    PACTED, AND THE LACK  OF  ADEQUETTE
    PROGRAMMING TIME, THE OPTION    FOR
    "CATALOG TARGET" HAS A FEW BUGS  IN

    IT.  IT WILL NOT CATALOG THE TARGET
    SPECIFIED BY THE PATCH.  IT WILL DO
    WHAT IS WAS ORIGIANLLY MADE TO  DO,
    CATALOG DRIVE 1 OR DRIVE 2.    THIS
    IS NO BIG PROBLEM, IF YOU NEED   TO
    CATALOG YOUR TARGET, JUST USE   THE
    "DOS COMMAND" OPTION.

     THAT'S ABOUT IT! PLEASE DISTRIBUTE
DDD ][+ TO ALL  THE  HARD  DRIVE SYSOPS
YOU KNOW, SO THERE WILL BE NO MORE PRO-
BLEMS.
