1)  Ship View
(ESC,1,2,3,4,5)
Select front, rear, right, up, or down. All views except the front view will
display a portion of the spacecraft to indicate which view is currently
selected.

2) RPV View
('6' key)
When your RPV is deployed, you can switch to RPV view at any time. When this is
done the 'RPV View' light on the instrument panel will turn yellow. One of the
more interesting features of the game is flying the C-104 while watching from
the droid (RPV). To switch back to ship view, select one of the six ship view
keys described above.

3) Zoom
(7 & 8 keys) (Y & U keys)
Both the Main screen and the Top view have Zoom (magnification) capabilities.
The Zoom feature allows you to examine buildings and structures more closely
without flying nearer to them. The Zoom magnifies the viewing area to make
objects appear closer. The main screen can be "Zoomed In" to a power of 16X
while to Top view can be zoomed into 22X.

4) Zone Map
('J' Key)
Pressing this key will bring up the Zone Map which is divided into 36 areas.
When you begin the game the entire map will be red (except at the Base Station).
As you fly around the map will turn white in the sectors that have been scanned
by your ships sensors. Your present location is always indicated by a flashing
dot. Press Space bar to return to main screen.

5) Hyperdrive
('H' key during Zone Map)
There will be times when you will want to move quickly across the Zone. You
could fly to your destination Area using your main engines, but it would waste
time and fuel. Hyperdrive will transport you there in a matter of seconds. First
select Zone map, then press the 'H' key. A flashing dot will appear at your
current position. Move the Joystick up, down, left or right and position the dot
in the destination area. Now press button 1 or Space bar. You will arrive in the
new area in a matter of seconds. Your coordinates and sector will remain the
same.

6) Area Map
('H' key)
The area map will display your current location within the area. Unlike the Zone
Map (which freezes play), the Area map is a Heads Up display and can be toggled
on and off without stopping play.

7) Top View
('T' key)
This key is used to toggle the Top View on and off. Turning the top view off is
normally done to speed up the rate at which the main screen updates.

8) Pitch auto center
(Return Key)
Pressing this key toggles the pitch auto centering feature on and off. When auto
centering is on, the white light just below the Pitch readout will come on. This
feature will automatically return your pitch to Zero (level flight) when the
joystick is released.

9) Hover
('O', 'L', '.' keys)
These keys control the anti-gravity hover system. Push the Hover down key ('.')
to make your ship Descend. Push the Hover up key ('O') to make it ascend. The
longer you hold the key down, the faster the ship will move. Press Hover Stop
key ('L' or the Emergency Stop key (Space Bar) to stop ascending or descending.

10) Tracking
('0' key)
Push this key to toggle the RPV tracking system on or off. When your RPV is
deployed, it will try to follow your ship at all times if tracking is enabled.
The tracking indicator will turn blue when tracking is ON.

11) Emergency Stop
(Space Bar)
This key will zero all ship velocities.

12) Deploy RPV
('9' key)
Press this key to deploy your RPV. The droid is used only for exploration and
reconnaissance as it has no weapons. You can activate its camera and sensors by
selecting RPV View ('6' key).

13) Control
('C' key)
This key toggles between C-104 and RPV control.

14) Teleporter
(Left Arrow Key)
Pressing this key will engage the Object Teleportation System. Several
Conditions must be met before an object can be beamed aboard. All engines
including hover must be stopped. Altitude must at 50 meters or below and down
view must be selected. In addition, there must be an object (flashing hour glass
visible on the main screen. The teleporter is also used to retrieve the RPV.

15) Grid
('-' key)
This key is used to select full, partial, or no surface grid.

16) Data Link
(Right Arrow key)
Pressing this key will link your on board computer to the main computers at
Echelon Headquarters. Once the data link is established you can select numerous
playing options.

17) Weapons
('B', 'N', 'M', ',' keys)
These four keys are used to arm and disarm the weapon systems aboard the C-104
spacecraft. Select 'B' to arm the Lasers, 'N' to arm the Photon Cannons, and 'M'
to arm the missiles. Select ',' to disarm all weapons.

18) Auto Bank Center
('/' key)
This key toggles Auto Bank centering on or off. When stick is released, the bank
or tilt of the wings will automatically return to zero.

19) Full forward thrust
('I' key)
Pressing the 'I' key engages full forward thrusters.

20) Full reverse thrust
('K' key)
Pressing 'K' engages full reverse thrusters.
