INTRODUCTION

"Hey, thrasher!  Dontcha ever wear knee pads?"  "Didja see that?  He caught
some air on the half pipe!  Radical!"

Welcome to California.  Home of the most radical sports in the world.  Rad,
bad and aggro.  You're about to hit the beaches, parks and streets of the
Golden State to go for trophies in everything from surfing to bike racing. 
CALIFORNIA GAMES gives you the hottest sports.  And the most aggro
competition.  You even get to pick your own sponsor.

So pull on those knee pads.  You're about to get into the most fun you've had
since Mom hid your skateboard.  CALIFORNIA GAMES is going to take you from
the surf to the turf.  From the pipe to the parks.  Are you gonna love it, or
what?

We'll start you off in the heart of Hollywood, with skateboards in hot
competition on the radical Half Pipe.  Then we'll rocket up to San Francisco
for the high-flying Foot Bag and some really wild footwork.  After that, it's
down to the beach for two of the coolest sports we've got in California. 
There's an awesome Roller Skating obstacle course, followed by the king of
coastal competition.  Surfing.  You'll be shooting the tube and carving the
biggest breakers around.

Over at the dirt track, you'll pump the pedals of a BMX racing bike.  And
your moves had better be bad.  For the grand finale, you'll go to Yosemite
where you'll be flinging the fantastic Flying Disk.  That's six massive
events.  You're gonna have your hands full.  Not to mention your feet.

You're about to get into the wildest games of them all...CALIFORNIA GAMES. 
It's only, like, the most totally awesome game in the world.

OBJECTIVES

CALIFORNIA GAMES is a challenge of skills for one to eight players.  The
object of the games is to win trophies in each individual event.  Players can
also compete for the top trophy in overall competition.

CALIFORNIA GAMES includes six exciting events:  Half Pipe Skateboard, Foot
Bag, Surfing, Skating, BMX Bike Racing, and Flying Disk.  You can practice or
compete in any single event, compete in all the events, or even set up your
own competition using events that you choose yourself.

Each player chooses a sponsor for the competition.  You are judged on each
event and a record is kept of your score.  Trophies are awarded to the top
scoring competitors.

If you break an event record, CALIFORNIA GAMES will save your name and
display it on a special high score screen.  Improve your skills in each
event, compete with your family and friends and become a California Champion.

THE GAMES

HALF-PIPE SKATEBOARDING

It's time to get air on the half pipe.  Skateboarding is definitely
an awesome event, combining strength and coordination--often with amazing
results.  You'll be riding a skateboard in a specially built half-pipe. 
You'll have a 1:15 minute time period, or three falls, to build up speed and
successfully complete stunts.  Points are awarded for each stunt, and the
highest score wins the event.

OBJECT:  The object of the half-pipe event is to ride the board back and
forth on the ramp, performing stunts with proper timing and execution.

- Press the FIRE BUTTON to launch your board and start the event.
- To gain speed, move the joystick UP when the skater is going up the
side of the ramp, then move the joystick DOWN when the skater is going down.
- To perform a stunt, move the joystick as shown in the diagram.  Pay
attention to timing, because you'll fail if you move the stick too soon, too
late, or if you hold it too long.  After three falls, the event is over.

       start Kick Turn                             to start Kick Turn

- To start a kick turn, move the joystick as indicated on the diagram
above.  Earn maximum points by waiting until the last moment to start the
turn, and holding the joystick until the moment before you'd wipe out.
- To start an aerial turn, tap the joystick in the direction
indicated above.  To perform this move successfully, you must be in the air
off the edge of the ramp before tapping the joystick.
- To perform a hand plant, press and hold the FIRE BUTTON just as you
reach the top of the ramp.  The skater will plant his hands and flip the
board over his head.  Wait to release the button until the board arcs over
and returns to the ramp.  Earn maximum points for pressing the button at the
last moment, and releasing it at the last moment.

SCORING:  You score points for each stunt completed successfully.  Your score
increases with the amount of risk you take.  For example, if you hold a turn
until the last moment, you get more points than if you pull out early when
it's safer.  Some stunts are more difficult and earn higher scores than
others.

STUNT          MINIMUM       MAXIMUM
Kick Turns       100           300
Hand Plants      400           700
Aerial Turns     400           999

STRATEGY:  It's important to build up the right amount of speed before trying
a stunt.  You can gain speed by doing a "fakie."  To fakie, hold the joystick
up or down for the full duration of the ramp (from top to bottom).  Remember
that you'll wipe out if you go too fast.  Above all, be sure to get plenty of
practice on the half pipe.  This event takes experience to get the timing
down just right.

FOOT BAG

This is probably the most laid back event, but don't lose your cool,
it isn't easy.  The Foot Bag event is like juggling with your feet.  In this
event, you have to keep a juggling bag in the air for 1:15 minutes, without
using your hand.  Success is all in the timing.  If you time your kicks
correctly, you'll keep the bag bouncing high in the air.  Score extra points
by performing stunts.  The highest score wins the event.

OBJECT:  Hacking at the sack with your feet, knees and head, you must try to
make as many kicks as you can before time runs out.  And remember, you get
extra points for every stunt you perform.

- Press the FIRE BUTTON to kick the bag into the air and start the
event.
- As the bag falls back toward the ground, press the FIRE BUTTON to
kick again just before the bag reaches your foot.
- To perform a head butt, press the FIRE BUTTON just before the bag
drops below the level of your head.
- Move the joystick as indicated in the diagram to control other
movements.

       Turn Around
    (About face)

- Several types of kicks are possible, including inside kicks,
outside kicks, jumping reverse kicks, knee kicks and back kicks.
- To perform different types of kicks, move to new positions
underneath the bag while it's in the air.  For example, move to the right so
the bag will drop next to you (but not too far).  Now press the FIRE BUTTON
when the bag approaches and you'll perform an outside kick.
- Other kicks are performed by positioning yourself in different
ways.  Discover the ways to perform all the kicks by trying various movements
during practice.

SCORING:  You earn points for each stunt or kick performed successfully. 
More difficult stunts, like turning around while the bag is in the air, earn
higher scores.  You lose time if you drop the bag or kick it off the screen. 
You also earn points for consecutive kicks completed without allowing the bag
to touch the ground.  Earn bonus for catching the sack when thrown from
offscreen.  Here are some stunts to try by combining different kicks and
moves:
Any Kick: (10 pts.)
Half Axle: (250 pts.) Any two kicks with a half spin in between.
Full Axle: (500 pts.) Any two kicks with a full spin in between.
Horseshoe: (500 pts.) Left back kick + Right back kick.
Jester: (2000 pts.) Left jumping kick or right jumping kick.
Double arch: (2500 pts.) Left outside kick + right outside kick +
left outside kick.
Doda: (5000 pts.) Left outside kick + head butt + right outside kick.
Off Screen Catch: (1500 pts.)

STRATEGY:  The more complicated kicks and stunts you can complete before time
runs out, the higher your score will be.  Special bonus points are awarded
for variety, so use as many different stunts as you can.

SURFING

Surfing began as the sport of Hawaiian kings; now it rules the
California coastline.  From Santa Cruz to Rincon Point, surfers and their
colorful boards dot the miles of sun-splashed beaches.  And you're about to
join them.  You'll shoot the curl, shred the tube and probably even eat a
litte sand (when you wipe out).  It's going to be hot.  You'll be there.  And
you'll be awesome.

OBJECT:  Competition surfing is a game of staying near the curl of the wave
and maneuvering your board smoothly at high speeds.  Ride the face of the
wave, moving back and forth, in and out of the tube.  "Use" as much of the
wave as you can before your ride comes to an end.

- Press the FIRE BUTTON to catch a wave and start the event.
- Hold the joystick LEFT to avoid wiping out at the beginning of your
ride.
- To steer the board to the surfer's left, move the joystick LEFT.
- To steer the board to the surfer's right, move the joystick RIGHT.
- Hold the FIRE BUTTON down to make sharper turns.  Note that sharp
turns slow you down.
- If you go too close to the bottom of the wave, you'll either wipe
out or end your ride by leaving the wave.
- To end your ride cleanly, go over the top of the wave.
- If you go over the top of the wave and turn your board around in
the air, you can catch the wave again (but you'll wipe out if you come back
down at a bad angle).
- You get 1:30 minutes for the event or 4 wipeouts.  You earn more
points for longer rides, so try to ride each wave as long as you possible
can.

SCORING:  You're scored for the length of your ride, the number of turns you
make and your speed each time you turn.  You also earn high points from the
judges for riding in the tube (underneath the curl of the wave), and riding
near the break.  "Catching air" scores extra points:  ride up to the top of
the wave until the end of your board clears the crest, then turn and continue
your ride.

STRATEGY:  Your final score is based on how well you "use" the wave.  Riding
along straight, far out in front of the break counts for very little.  Take
risks.  The more risks you take to do your stunts, the more points you will
earn.  Making cutbacks (180-degree turns), moving up and down the wave and
doing 360's (complete circles) all earn high scores.  Earn maximum points for
high speed turns, especially if you complete them near the top of the wave or
near the break.

ROLLER SKATING

Roller Skating is hot.  Anyone can skate and almost everyone does,
with a feeling of freedom unlike any other sport.  And CALIFORNIA GAMES
skating is as radical as you can get.  The trick is to skate down a beach
boardwalk without falling.  You'll have to avoid cracks in the sidewalk,
grass, sand, puddles of water, shoes lying in your path and more.  You'll
have to squat to miss flying beach balls.  You'll even have to jump over
missing pieces of the sidewalk!

OBJECT:  The object in roller skating is to avoid the obstacles and cover the
course in the best possible time, with as many stunts as you can perform
during the event.

- Press the FIRE BUTTON to start the event.
- To begin skating, roll the joystick to the UP position.  Then roll
the joystick to the DOWN position.  Continue rolling between these two
positions to gain speed.
- Move the joystick as shown in the diagram to perform other skating
moves.

                 Clockwise Spin      __/    Forward Thrust
                 (360 degrees) 

- To squat, press and hold the FIRE BUTTON.
- To jump, release the FIRE BUTTON.
- Try and avoid all the obstacles.  You're allowed three falls.  On
the third fall you are disqualified and your race is over.

SCORING:  Score points for each obstacle you avoid.  Earn double points for
jumping over obstacles.  Earn the highest scores for 360's while jumping
obstacles.

Avoiding Obstacles:  10 - 30 points.
Jumping Over Obstacles:  20 - 60 points.
Spinning Jump Over Obstacles:  40 - 120 points.

STRATEGY:  You'll score points for each object you successfully avoid or jump
over, so be careful-- speed is less important than staying on your feet. 
Remember that you earn points for spinning jumps over obstacles (jumping and
spinning at the same time).  Complicated moves lead to high scores.  But be
careful not to fall more than twice, or you'll be out of the competition.

BMX BIKE RACING

BMX stands for Bicycle Motocross.  It also stands for radical action
and challenging competition.  In this event, riders use strong, lightweight
bicycyles to race on an action-packed course in the California desert.  There
are plenty of jumps, bumps and dips.  (Rows of low bumps are called
"Whoop-ti-dos.")  You'll need speed, a good sense of timing and a heavy dose
of endurance.

OBJECT:  The object is to cover the course in the fastest possible time,
performing stunts and avoiding or jumping over obstacles.  The fastest
daredevil rider will win the event.

- Move the joystick RIGHT to start the event.
- Move the joystick UP to steer left.
- Move the joystick DOWN to steer right.
- Move the joystick RIGHT repeatedly to increase your speed.
- Press the FIRE BUTTON to jump.
- Move the joystick LEFT to do a wheelie.
- To begin a jump, move the joystick LEFT as you ride onto a hill or
ramp.
- When you're in the air, use the joystick to perform stunts:
  - Move the stick UP to do a table top.  Hold the stick as long as
possible then release the joystick to put the bike down.
  - Move the stick DOWN to do a 360-degree turn.
  - Move the stick LEFT to do a backward flip.
  - Move the stick RIGHT to do a forward flip.
- Timing is important to perform stunts and jumps.  You must time the
start and finish of each move to complete it successfully.  If you're not
back in a "centered" position by the time you land or complete your stunt,
you will crash.
- You're allowed one "serious" fall or three "easy" falls before
you're out of the race.  If you flip and fall on your head, it's a serious
fall.
- At the end of the course, press the FIRE BUTTON to stop.  You earn
bonus points for stopping on the finishing pad.

SCORING:  Try to complete the course within the 2:00 minute time limit.  The
faster your time, the higher your score will be.  You also get points for
each stunt, with bonus points for holding stunts as long as possible.  Here's
a table of the minimum and maximum points awarded for each stunt:

STUNT           MINIMUM   MAXIMUM
Wheelie           100       200
Jump              200       400
Table Top         500      1000
360 Turn         1000      2000
Backward Flip    1500      3000
Forward Flip     3000      6000

STRATEGY:  When you complete the course, you get 60 points for each second
left in the time limit.  So finishing the course in the fastest possible time
is important, but the highest scores go to the riders who perform the most
daring stunts.  Make a 6000-point forward flip, and you've probably got a
lock on the first place trophy.

FLYING DISK

To serious competitors, the plastic saucer invented by two
Californians in 1947 is called a "flying disk."  Of course, you may know it
by another name.  Originally spelled Frisbie, the disk's most popular name
originated at Yale University, where students first started tossing empty pie
plates made by the Frisbie Pie Company one hundred years ago.  Now molded
from light and flexible plastic, the flying disk is a common sight whirling
through the air at beaches and parks everywhere in California, and it's the
perfect challenge of skill and timing to wind up the competition in
CALIFORNIA GAMES.

OBJECT:  The object of the Flying Disk is to throw accurately to the catcher
at the other end of the field.  Score extra points for difficult catches.

- Press the FIRE BUTTON to start the event.
- You get three attempts to throw and catch the disk.
- Try to throw the disk far enough to reach the catcher standing at
the other end of the field.
- Use the bar at the bottom of the screen to make your throw.  The
bar has three colors:  red, yellow and green.  Use the green area for the
most powerful throw.
- Tap the joystick LEFT to start swinging your arm back.  When the
needle reaches the green section of the bar, tap the stick RIGHT.  When the
needle reaches the green section on the right side of the bar, tap the stick
LEFT again to release the disk.
- The display at the top of the screen helps you move the catcher to
intercept the disk after it has been thrown.
- As the disk flies across the field, move the joystick LEFT or RIGHT
to run toward the point where you think the disk will land.
- To catch the disk, you must meet it with your hands.  Note that
your hands are extended only when you're running or diving.
- To attempt an overhead standing catch, hold the joystick UP to
reach up for the disk.
- To dive after the disk, press the FIRE BUTTON.

SCORING:  Points are awarded for the throw and the catch.  For the throw,
score points with the accuracy and height of the toss.  The fewer steps the
catcher has to run to meet the disk, the more points are awarded for the
throw.  Points are scored for catching the disk as follows:

- 150 pts. for a catch while running right.
- 250 pts. for a catch while running left.
- 250 pts. for a catch while diving right.
- 350 pts. for a catch while diving left.
- 350 pts. for a catch over your head.

STRATEGY:  Throwing accuracy is the key to winning the Flying Disk (of
course, it also helps to make a good catch!).  To get the best possible
score, throw the disk so the catcher doesn't have to move far to reach it,
then make a diving catch or an overhead catch.

CALIFORNIA GAMES SCORING

AWARDS CEREMONY

After every event, trophies are awarded with the names and sponsors of the
top finishers in the order they placed.

CHAMPION CEREMONY

If the players compete in all six CALIFORNIA GAMES events, a final trophy is
awarded to the Champion of the games based on the total number of points
awarded.

First Place   =  5 points
Second Place  =  3 points
Third Place   =  1 point

The points are totaled after all events have been completed, and the player
with the most points is the California Champion.

EVENT RECORDS

If an event record is broken or tied in any event, CALIFORNIA GAMES saves the
name of the record-breaking player.  The records are displayed on the Event
Records screen.  If a new record is set for an event, the previous record is
erased and the new information appears in its place.
