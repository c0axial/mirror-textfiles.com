This USE file for ACOS will take over the answering of your modem, thus
allowing for many features (suggestions please?).  The screen will be blanked
while awaiting a call; to reduce wear on the monitor (character imprints on
your screen).  While awaiting a call you can toggle the screen (back to normal
or back to black) with the spacebar.

To give credit where credit is due, Xor Blade came to me with his problem, so
it is for him that this file was written.

Installation is easy; copy the file SCR.BLANK to whatever spec you want it on,
then modify your LOGON.SEG (or whatever seg has the MODEM(0) command in it) so
instead of a MODEM(0) you have:

 use "x:scr.blank":edit(0)

(where spec "x:" is a drivespec of your choosing)

Commands Available:
SPACEBAR = toggle screen (black/normal, normal/black)
Q = quit to prodos
G = sysop login
A = pick up phone

Enjoy
