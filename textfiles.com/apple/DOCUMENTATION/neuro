GETTING AROUND IN THE REAL WORLD

         While walking through Chiba City, you'll see the world one "room" at
a time.  Many rooms have exits or doorways you can walk through.  Exits at 
the bottom of the main screen are represented by a black line.  Some doors 
may be locked or guarded; in this case it is up to you to find out how to get 
in.

         As you cruise through each room, you'll see and talk to other 
people. You can control your actions and movement using keyboard commands or 
a joystick (more commands later).

         The screen is divided into three main areas.  The largest section 
shows the room itself. In the bottom left corner are the eight command icons. 
In the bottom right corner is a special text window used for room 
descriptions and other short bits of text.  When a conversation is in 
progress, "word balloons" will appear above the speaking characters in the 
room.

JOYSTICK CONTROL

         To toggle the joystick on and off, press "J" while holding down the 
"open-apple" key.  If you have a joystick, you can use it to move a "pointer 
arrow around the screen.  Whenever you want to select anything on the screen 
-- a command icon, a menu option, some softwarez to download -- you can just 
point to it with the pointer and press the joystick button.

COMMAND ICONS

         You use the command icons to perform actions.  You can pick an icon 
by either pointing to it with the joystick pointer and pressing the joystick 
button, or pressing the corresponding key on your keyboard.

         The command icons are arranged            _______________
as in the figure to the right.  The table         | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
below refers to each icon by number, as           |---|---|---|---|
shown in the figure.                              | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
                                                   ---------------

SOUND CONTROL

         To toggle the sound effects on and off, press "S" while holding down 
the "open-apple" key".

         Here is a list of the command icons and what they do.

   KEY  ICON           DESCRIPTION
   ---  ----           -----------
1.  M   MODE           Toggles through these display options:
                            Current amount on credit chip
                            Time
                            Date
                            Constitution level

2.  I   INVENTORY      Displays what you're currently carrying and lets you
                       operate, discard, or give items, or erase software in 
a
                       deck.

3.  P   PAX            Access the PAX system if there's a PAX terminal in the
                       room.

4.  T   TALK           Talk with another person in the room.

5.  S   SKILLS         Use a skill you have acquired.

6.      WALK           When using a joystick, puts you back in control of
                       your movement after performing some other action.
                       (See Movement Commands)

7.  R   ROM CONSTRUCT  Access your ROM construct abilities (if you have one).

8.  D   DISK           Save your current game position, load an old game,
                       pause the game, start a new game, or quit the game.


MOVEMENT COMMANDS

         You can use either the keyboard or a joystick to walk around town.

         With the keyboard, you can one step by pressing a direction key once 
or keep walking by holding a direction key down.  the direction keys are 
shown below.  The arrow keys will move you immediately from room to room.

         To walk around with a joystick, first select the "Walk" command 
icon. The joystick pointer will disappear to show that you are walking 
around. Moving the joystick in the direction you want to go will then make 
you walk in that direction.  When you want to select a different command 
icon, press the joystick button again to stop walking and get the joystick 
pointer back.

COMMANDS WITHIN MENUS:

         Menus may appear throughout the game when you look at lists of items 
-- prices in a shop or your inventory list, for example.  You can select a 
menu option with the keyboard, or point to the option with the joystick 
pointer and press the joystick button.  There are several commands commonly 
used within menus:

COMMAND  KEY  DESCRIPTION
-------  ---  -----------
EXIT      X   Leave the current menu
MORE      M   View more menu options (if available)

After you select an item in your Inventory menu, you can choose from three 
special commands:

OPERATE   O   Operate an item.
GIVE      G   Give an item to another person.
DISCARD   D   Discard an item, permanently.


CONVERSATIONS

         In Talk mode (type "T" or select the Talk icon), you can carry on 
conversations with other characters in a room through the use of "word 
balloons".  Word balloons allow you to choose among several respnses or 
questions that are appropriate to the situation in that room.  When a word 
balloon appears over your head, you can see all of your possible responses by 
pressing the space bar or pulling back on your joystick after each response 
is displayed.  When you decide on the proper response, press return or the 
button on your joystick.  the response you select will be displayed a second 
time as you "say" it.  After you read a word balloon that you or another 
character has "said", press the space bar or joystick button to continue.  
You can leave a conversation your character initiated with the "talk" command 
by pressing the <ESC> key.

USING THE PAX

         When you operate a PAX machine (by selecting the PAX icon or 
pressing "P") the machine will give you three access codes and ask you for 
the verification code.

         Take the PAX Verification Code Wheel (or a reasonable facsimile 
thereof) and align the first access code, found on the outer wheel, with the 
second access code, located on the inner wheel.  Find the window that 
corresponds to the third access code.  Type the number found in the window, 
then press RETURN.  For example, if given the codes Freeside, Comlink, and 
Holy Joystick, you would line up the words "Freeside" and "Comlink", and then 
type the number in the Holy Joystick window: 512.

         Whenever text is displayed on the PAX or a database, you may press 
the "+" (plus) key to speed up the text display, or the "-" (minus) key to 
slow it down.

THE CYBERSPACE DISPLAY

         (Cyberspace jacks appear as yellow circles with a red dot in the 
middle.)  The top half of the screen shows the view from your current 
cyberspace location.  The bottom left corner of the screen is occupied by the 
cyberspace command icons.  The bottom right corner of the screen contains 
your EEG monitor, which gives you a visual representation of your brain wave 
activity.  Just below the EEG there is a gauge of your cyberdecks shielding, 
and to the right of the EEG is a gauge of ICE shielding for when you're in 
combat with ICE.

         The center of the cyberdeck panel is where information will appear 
when needed.  At the bottom center of the cyberdeck panel, there are four 
numbers; from left to right, these are the cyberspace zone number you're in, 
your X and Y coordinates in cyberspace, and the amount of money in your 
credit chip.

CYBERSPACE ICONS

         The cyberspace command icons are arranged as in the figure below.


    KEY  ICON                          _______
    ---  ----                         | 1 | 2 |
1.   I   INVENTORY                    |---|---|
2.   S   SKILLS                       | 3 | 4 |
3.   R   ROM CONSTRUCT                 -------
4.   D   DISK


         In cyberspace, the SKILLS, ROM CONSTRUCT, and DISK icons behave just 
as they do outside of cyberspace.  The INVENTORY icon displays a list of 
softwarez in your deck to operate, rather than a list of your items.  The 
MODE, PAX, TALK, and WALK icons are unavailabe in cyberspace.  There are 
three new controls: The EXIT button ("X" on the keyboard) exits from 
cyberspace. The ERASE button ("E" on the keyboard) will erase a piece of 
software from your deck.  The "Movement" button, just above the four command 
icons, is used to control your movement with the joystick.  The "Movement" 
button is similar to the "Walk" button in the real world.

All these bases can be reached by using a deck and a cyper jack. but some 
boards need a higher version of Comlink to be able for you to reach.

SOFTWARE LIST & FUNCTION
(unless noted, the highest the version, the better)

JAMMIES, SLOW- These are cyberspace interface corruptor, which slows down the 
ICE's attack.

THUNDERHEAD, PYTHON, ACID, INJECTOR- Cyperspace ICE viruses, use these on ICE 
to slowly destry the ICE defense.

VACCINE, CYBERSPACE- These are communication software for entering the 
cyberspace.

BLAMMO, BATTLECHESS 4.0- These are deck viruses, don't use them no matter 
what happen!

DOORSTOP, DECODER, BLOWTORCH, DRILL, HAMMER, DEPTHCHARGE, CONCRETE, 
LOGICBOMB- These are your ICE breakers, collect them all.

SEQUENCER- USE THESE TO FIND OUT LEVEL ONE PASSWORD, OR TO access Justice, 
bozobank after you use COMLINK (after the base into appears, move your 
joystick to inventory and select this software, this will run the softwares 
while you're on-line)

ARMORALL- Use this one, if your shield is down. warning, this only work once 
per ICE.

KGB 1.0- Use this in cyberspace to teleport you to KGB base.

COMLINK- communication softwares, version 6.0 allows you to enter cyperspace.

PROBE- allows you to find out the name of the base that ICE's are guarding, 
in higher version, you can ever find out if AI's are present.

EASYRIDER 1.0- allows you to traver over to the other zone in cyperspace.

BATTLECHESS 1.0- a chess program.

SCOUT- used in link lines to find out the numbers of levels in a base. (same 
way as in using a SEQUENCER)

HEMLOCK- use this to 'kill' Greystoke AI.


THE PURPOSE OF CYPERSPACE IS TO BREAK INTO A BASE WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE 
LEVEL ACCESS WITH-OUT A PASSWORD. YOU MUST USE YOUR SOFTWARE TO MELT DOWN THE 
ICE IN-ORDER TO REACH THE BASE.

SOMETIMES, an AI (artificial intelligence) is present after you melt the ICE. 
you must use your skill to kill them, if you don't know which skill to 
use.... try psychoanalyis.

P.S only once ICE can be defeat only with a software, and that's Greystoke.
