  Takeoff and Landing on the Carrier
  ----------------------------------

If you choose to fly the F-18, you will start out on the deck of a
Nimitz- class aircraft carrier.  Superimposed over a forward view of the
launch catapult is a flashing message: 

               PRESS [L] TO LAUNCH FROM THIS CARRIER

First increase throttle to full thrust with afterburners on.Then press
[L] to launch the jet will be released and will accelerate rapidly down
the deck.As airspeed increases, pull back on the elevator.When the F-18
clears the bow of the carrier the nose will come up and you will start
gaining altitude

In order to re-arm or refuel the F-18 you must land back on the
carrier.  To this you should try to position yourself about 3 miles west
and slightly south of the carrier on a heading of 80 degrees.As you
approach the Nimitz the carrier's landing strip should be visible to the
left of it's superstructure,angled slightly north with respect to the
ships hull.Lower your landing gear and engage the airbrake to reduce
airspeed.Now you must try to keep the jet parallel to the landing strip
by banking left or right, and aim your nose for the stern of the carrier
by pitching up or down.Reduce the throttle to about 20% to cut airpseed
even more.If you begin losing altitude too soon,increase the throttle.If
approach speed is too high, decrease throttle.As you pass over the stern
of the ship, begin to flare by raising the jet's nose and try to touch
down just short of the trip wire. If you catch the tripwire the jet will
stop abruptly & you will be returned to the launch catapult (in Free
Flight mode) or to the re-arming menu page (for either combat mode). 


Weapons Systems
---------------

A. Ordnance

In either combat mode,once you've selected a skill level the arming menu
then appears as: 

                 Select Armament

        [1] Aim-9 Missile 160 lbs x 0
        [2] Aim-7 Missile 500 lbs x 0
        [3] Agm-65 Missile 460 lbs x 0
        [4] Mk-82 Missile 500 lbs x 0
        [5] Exit Arming Menu

For the F-16 the following weight data appears below the menu: 

        F-16 Empty 14000 lbs
        Internal Fuel 3700 lbs
        Total Weight 17700 lbs

Corresponding figures are displayed for the F-18. 

Choose your weapons by pressing the appropriate number key (of course).
Each time you make a selection the number to the right of that weapon is
incremented by one and your total weight is increased accordingly. If
you select more than 6 of one weapon,that weapon's counter is reset to 0

Press [5] when you're done.Remember the combined weight of your weapons
affect the performance and flight characteristics of your jet.  As you
burn fuel and fire weapons your weight decreases and the jet becomes
more maneuverable.When flying the F-16 you can return to the arming menu
at any time by landing and steering the jet into the hanger at your
homebase If you are flying the F-18 you can return to the arming menu by
catching the trip wire on the carrier's deck landing strip.After
re-arming the F-18 you will be placed on the launch catapult.

The Dogfight Game
-----------------

A. Object & Rules

Dogfight is an intense 3-dimensional combat scenario that pits you
against Soviet MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighter aircraft.  They are equip- ped
with Atoll air-to-air missiles, while you can select from a var- iable
arsenal of Aim-9 missiles and/or Aim-7 missiles along with your 20mm
Vulcan cannon.  Your mission is to engage and shoot down all en- emy
aircraft at the skill level you've selected (hint!  Start off easy and
work your way up.  You don't want to fight their best, with your worst
now do you ??).  Then return home to refuel and re-arm.  If your mission
has been a success, a new wave of enemy aircraft will then appear at the
next higher level.  For each successful enemy hit that you score, a
token marker appears on the fuselage of your jet. Your score can be
viewed ou the rear window as the number of tokens lining the right side
of your jet. If your score exceeds 9, ten digit tokens are marked along
the left side of the fuselage.  Shoot down all enemy aircraft before
returning to base and a two-point bonus will be added to your score.  A
warning beeper will sound if an enemy missile comes within the danger
threshold of your aircraft.  If you're hit by an Atoll missile the
screen will flash red and orange and the jet will spin out of con-
trol.You have seconds to eject before your jet explodes and your body
becomes no more bits and pieces.  If you eject in time you'll float back
to earth (provided the parachute opens) where you'll be recovered and
given a new jet to fly in combat.  Once you get shot down 3 times, you
are grounded and the game is over. 



Enemy Aircraft
--------------

At the start of each mission, the enemy aircraft will come at you from
the south.  You will encounter two different types of enemy jets: the
MiG-21 and the MiG-23.  These aircraft utilize the same flight equations
as your jet, but since they weigh more and have less thrust they are
less maneuverable.  The skill level you select will determine the type &
num- ber of aircraft you must shoot down.  During a dogfight the MiG's
will track you and fire their Atoll air-to-air missiles. Missiles also
track your jet,and will detonate their warheads if they get within a hit
radius

To shoot down an enemy aircraft you must first select one as your
target.  The current targeted aircraft flashes out your window & on the
radar dis- play.  Press the [;] key & your onboard tracking computer
will automatic- ally sequence to the next target.  Since there can only
be a maximum of 3 enemies in your airspace at any time, you can cycle to
the desired target with a maximum of 2 keystrokes. 

Once you've selected a target you can fire the active weapon.  Press the
[RET] or [CR] key to recycle through your available weapon systems and
choose the one you'd like to use.  Press the [Spacebar] to fire that
wea- pon. Air-to-air missiles will automatically track the target and
detonate if they get within the hit radius.  A rising tone from your
onboard com- puter will indicate that the MiG has been hit.  The MiG
will flash, spin out of control (leaving a trail of flak in its wake)
and finally explode. 

After shooting down all opponents, or if you run out of weapons and ammo
you will have to return to base.  Any remaining MiG's will chase you un-
till you enter the safe zone surrounding your base.You then land, re-arm
and get back up in the sky to nuke those Commie's. 

The Target Strike Game
---------------------

Object and Rules: 

Your mission in the Target Strike game is to seek out and destroy all
enemy ground targets.  When flying the F-16, targets will be randomly
selected from the local area airstrips, fuel depots, factories, and mis-
sile silos.  In F-18 mode, your targets are Soviet Kynda-class cruisers
randomly placed in the sea to the south of your carrier. Each target
will be designated by a flashing red point.Your ordance can include both
Agm-65 air-to-ground missiles and Mk-82 smart bombs.  Press [RET] or
[CR] to cycle through your available weapons systems & choose the one
you like best. 

Turning on your range indicator automatically activates the ground
target ing computer.As you fly, the range indicator will show the
distance from your jet to the point on the ground that interesects your
current flight path.If this distance is greater than the range of your
selected weapon, the range circle will show all white.  When you come
withing range, position the desired homing point in the center of the
range circle and press the [Spacebar].  The weapon will be released and
will track that point to the ground.  If it impacts within the target's
hit radius, the target will explode and a shock wave will spread from
the impact point.  Scoring is the same as in Dogfighting. 

Surface to air Missiles
-----------------------

Enemy SAM launchers are only capable of detecting your presence within
the conical airspace directly above them.  If you pass within this air-
space they will track your jet and launch their missiles.Because of this
you should fly as low as possible when nearing your target.Shold an
enemy missile come within the danger threshold of your aircraft,a
warning beeper will sound.  If you are hit, the screen will flash read
and orange then spin out of control.  Rules of Ejecting are the same as
always.  Get out or be fried. 

Game Tips & Strategies
----------------------

The Dogfight Game: 

When dogfighting, it's important to have the zoom set correctly.At great
er distances, a higher zoom factor (4x-8x) will greatly increase your
accuracy.  During close-in fighting the lowest zoom factor will increase
your field view and make it easy to find a target.  Viewing the battle
from the control tower can help determine enemy aircraft altitude.You
may want to get into the habit of scanning several viewing directions
during a dogfight to give yourself a better overall view of the
surroundings. 

The Target Striking Game: 

As when dogfighting, high zoom factors increase accuracy.  When firing
air-to-ground weapons remember that aiming errors are magnified at
shallow pitch angles.Approaching the target from a steeper pitch will
allow you to deviate slightly from the target and still impact the
ground near it.However, this will also place you in greater danger of
being detected by the ever-hated SAM launchers. 

Avoiding Missiles: 

Should you detect an approaching enemy missile, there are two ways to
in- crease your chances for survival.  You can try to evade the missile,
but this will be difficult.  However the missile will run out of thrust
quick ly and lose speed rapidly once it begins to coast.Tracking
imperfections can also cause the missile to miss you (don't count on
it).  Another way to avoid the dang thing is to fly at right angles to
its flight path.  It will keep turning, wasting its energy and degrading
its homing accuracy.  If all else fails, you can eject, but this will
forfeit one of the three aircraft you are allowed each game.
