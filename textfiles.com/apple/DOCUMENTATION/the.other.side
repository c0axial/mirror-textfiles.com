The world of the other side consists of three parts-one side, your side,
the  other  side  and an unclaimed frontier that separates and surrounds
the two sides.  Each side has clearly defined borders that  are  visible
on  the  map.  the  entire  world has been divided into 55 areas. In the
middle of this world (in area 28) there is a large chasm separating  the
two  sides.  The goal of the game is to construct a bridge spanning this
chasm. Each team adds to the bridge brick by  brick.  Each  brick  costs
more as you build toward the other side.

Each  turn  of  The Other Side follows a simple and logical progression.
The four steps below make up each year/turn of the game

Planing Your Moves - Plan and then type in the  actions  you  intend  to
take during the upcoming year. 

The  Hotline  -  Communicate  with  the  other side by typing in a short
message. 

Executing Your Moves - Carry out the actions you had  planned  for  this
year

Year  End  Report  -  Record  the  important  domestic and international
information which will be used to plan your next year's moves

Planing Your Moves
At the beginning of each turn you  will  type  in  the  moves  you  have
planned  for the upcoming year. you must use the code which is described
below. You will be prompted for incomplete or improper commands.  (refer
to  the  yearly  planner  in  the players' tools section for a suggested
first turn.)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------/

b = build. 
You begin with a patrol in your capitol  city.  You  can  build  another
possession  in your capitol city or in any area adjacent to an area with
one of your possessions  in  it.  An  adjacent  area  is  one  which  is
horizontal,  vertical,  or  diagonal  to an area. You can also build new
possessions anywhere you you already have. The other's possessions  look
like yours, but they are black letters on a white background. Type , the
possession  you  want to build (d,p,b,c) and the area number you want to
place it in. 'bd31' will build a driller in area 31. 

r = run mixer. 
You make money by mixing fuels.  To  mix  fuels,  press  the  space  bar
repeatedly. Continue pressing the space bar to continue mixing. When you
are done mixing, press return. 

t = tank repair. 
A  leaky  tank  wastes  fuel. To repair a leaky tank, type t and type of
fuel in the tank. 'tg' will repair the green fuel tank. 

i = inspection. 
You can inspect the areas which contain any of your possessions.  Type i
and the area number you wish to examine. 'i20' will view area 20. To add
bricks to the bridge, you must inspect the bridge in area 28. a  command
of  'i28  will take you to the bridge where you can add bricks, one at a
time, by pressing b on the keyboard. 

p = prospecting. 
A prospector looks for rare fuel on the other side and reports  back  in
the year end report. To send out a prospector, type p. 

n = number sheet. 
The  number  sheet  displays the costs and values of all the actions and
items available to you. To look at the number sheet, type n

e = exchange. 
You can exchange a possession you own for half of its original value. To
exchange a possession for cash, type  e,  the  possession  you  wish  to
exchange (d,p,b,c), and its location. 'eb53 exchanges a bomb you have in
area 53 for cash. 

a = attack. 
An attack by your patrol will destroy the other side's patrol or bomb in
that  area  and allow you to take over their driller if one was present.
Your patrol must be right next to the possession you  are  attacking.  A
bomb   attack   destroys  everything  in  a  target  area  and  releases
contamination. To attack with a bomb you must  have  already  built  one
(although  not  necessarily  in or near the area you wish to attack). To
attack, type a, specify the possession with which you intend  to  attack
(p  or  b),  and the area you wish to attack.  'ab48' will launch a bomb
toward area 48. If you have built more than one bomb,  your  C.A.D  will
select which one to launch. 

f = fuel gift. 
Giving  fuel to the other side can be helpful, but it costs you money to
transport it across the frontier. To give fuel from your storage  tanks,
type  f, the type of fuel (o,g.b), and the number of gallons you wish to
send.  'fg15' will send 15 gallons of green  fuel  to  the  other  side.
Transportation costs for the gift will be deducted from your cash. 

m = money gift. 
Giving  money  to  the  other  side  can  also be helpful, but there are
transfer charges you must pay. To give money, type m and the  amount  of
money, plus transfer charges, will be deducted from your cash. 

c = cease fire zone. 
For  a  fee, an area can be declared neutral to allow visits or building
by the other side which will not alarm your side's C.A.D. To  declare  a
cease  fire  zone,  type  c  and the number of the area you wish to make
neutral.  'c30' will make a cease fire in area 30. Each  side  can  only
have 1 at a time. 

u = underground. 
By  setting  off a bomb underground, new fuel resources may be released.
It may contaminate the fuel. First build the bomb then type  u  and  the
area number. 'u8' will explode a bomb underground in area 8. 

Placing a possession in an area

When  building you will see a close up of the area where you are placing
the possession. To place to object  using  (i,j,k,m).  patrols  must  be
right next to objects they are either protecting or attacking. 

Breaking C.A.D. code

C.A.D.  your computer assisted defense system, if your cash gets too low
or if the other side makes moves which seem agressive, C.A.D.  may  step
in  and  take  over  your moves. When it takes over, it acts swiftly and
directly.  The only way to stop it  is  by  typing  in  the  appropriate
three-letter code (combination of a,b,c) which will turn it off. you can
get  the  code if the code breaker machine appears with C.A.D. this code
will only work during the year in which it was bought.  To use the  code
breaker,  press  return  when  the  amount  of  money  you wish to spend
appears.  Type in the three letter code when C.A.D. appears again during
this turn. 

Beyond your control
Occasionally events will occur that are completely beyond your  control.
C.A.D.   may take over or your country may experience a national strike.
A strike depletes your sides cash by $50 and causes you  to  loose  your
turn. 

Year end report
Watch  this  it tells all about your fuel and the condition of your fuel
tanks, the actions of the other side and the results of the  prospectors
explorations.   Also  note  the  contamination  levels  as they increase
leaking from your tanks.
