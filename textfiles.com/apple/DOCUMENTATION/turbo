The installation and explanation of Turbo Run is so simple that these dox are
almost completely unnecessary.  However, read it so you understand what this
game is.

Turbo Run is the first ARCADE-style on-line game written in ACOS (at least that
we know of.)  It is written for users with ProTERM.Special Emulation and makes
use of nearly all the emulation's functions including animation, mousetext, and
music.

Turbo Run is written entirely in ACOS.  Also, to facilitate easy installation,
Turbo Run is contained ENTIRELY in one file:  TURBO.SEG.S     Turbo Run will
make two files on it's own:

          TURBO.VAR           A file to temporarily store the users variables
          TURBO.TOPTEN        TopTen players list.

To clear the Top Ten players list, just DELETE the top ten file. It's as simple
as that.

If you are running your system off of a GS, it is to your advantage to run the
BBS at the "fast" mode (2.7 Mhz)..  This will make the game go a LOT faster
thus increasing the fun for the player.

To install, just "link" to the game from main.seg or wherever and in the label
BACK in Turbo Run change the link back to wherever you want.

The program will automatically check to see if the user has ProTERM emulation.
However, should a user have difficulty in getting on, as has been the case with
EPIC modem owners, the caller can simply type "PROTERM" when prompted to do so
after it says "you don't have ProTERM Emulation."  You can take this out
if your users don't have this problem.

If your board is running at 300 baud, don't even bother putting this up.

Turbo Run currently is running on a "unlimited play" system.  It is up to you,
the sysop, to determine any limit of games per call or how you wish to use this
game.  It can be used as a casino game, or merely for fun.

One last thing, the game looks REALLY bad from local mode..  Please give this
game a chance by perhaps calling your system remotely and seeing what this game
looks like to the caller.  It is worth it.  Rumor has it that there will soon
be a way to see the terminal emulation from local mode, but currently we know
of no way that this is possible.

If your users enjoy Turbo Run, you may be interested in some of our other
GBBS games, including WHEEL OF FORTUNE.  (sorry, I HAD to plug that.)
