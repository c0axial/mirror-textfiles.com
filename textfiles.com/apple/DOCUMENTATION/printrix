                                   CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION:
Printrix is a typesetting system which allows you to control the arrangement of
text on the paper, and the fonts used.  You may also insert graphics into the
text.

Printrix functions by taking a text file which you have already created,
applying a format or page design to that text file, and printing the result.
The text file is created with a word processor.  The page design is called a
"layout file," and is created with Printrix.  There are three components to a
layout file: text format, font library format, and graphics format.

Printrix is a ProDOS program.  The Printrix system provides ProDOS fonts and 25
clip-art graphics for you to use.  You must provide the text files and any
additional graphics.  Text files from AppleWorks, AppleWriter, Word Juggler,
and WordPerferct may be used directly.  Other text files may be used IF they
are saved in standard ASCII ProDOS format.  If your text file is saved in DOS
3.3 format, you must convert it to ProDOS or re-enter it using a ProDOS word
processing program.  If you are a Fontrix user (Fontrix is the sister program
to Printrix), you probably have Fontrix fonts and graphics in DOS 3.3 format.
These may be converted to ProDOS format following the instructions in Appendix
A.

WORKING DISKS
-------------
The Printrix program contains two disks, and uses both sides of each disk.  The
first disk is the Program Disk.  Its flip side is the Printrix Configuration
Disk.  The second disk contains fonts on both sides.  These disks are named
/PRINTRIX, /CONFIGURE, /FONTS1, and /FONTS2.

/PRINTRIX contains the Printrix program and lessons files.  /CONFIGURE contains
the configuration utility, a Graffile conversion utility, and 25 clip-art
graphics.  The font disks contain 43 fonts for use with Printrix.  See Appendix
A for information on the Graffile conversion utility, Appendix C for a listing
of fonts, and Appendix D for a listing of clip-art graphics.

The disks are not copy protected.  Please make back-up copies of all four
sides, using four separate disks for convenience.  Then label the working
copies and put the original disks in a safe place.  See your Apple Systems
Manual for copying information.

Hard Disk
---------
You may use Printrix from a hard disk.  We recommend that you create a
subdirectory named  /TEMP.  Copy all four Printrix original disks to this
subdirectory, then rename the subdirectory to /PRINTRIX.  Then, when you use
Printrix, set the prefix to /my hard drive/PRINTRIX, and all fonts, layout
files, and graphics will be loaded automatically.

As you develop a library of files, you may want to separate layout files and
text files according to their application.

3.5 Inch Disks

You may copy all four Printrix original disks to a 3.5 inch disk, using the
copying program from your Apple Systems Utilities.  We suggest that you name
the disk /PRINTRIX.


CONFIGURATION/RECONFIGURATION
-----------------------------
"Configuration" means telling Printrix about your system.  It needs to know
what computer you're using, how it's connected to the printer (interface card
and slot, printer port or modem port and baud rate), what word processor, and
what printer.

The Printrix Program Disk is preconfigured for the Apple Imagewriter and an
ASCII Soft word processor.  The lessons have been designed for this
configuration, and the lessons text files are in ASCII Soft word processor
form.  If you plan to work through the lessons, change the printer
configuration if necessary, but reenter ASCII Soft as the word processor.
Then, when you're ready to typeset your own text files, reconfigure your word
processor.

Floppy Disk
-----------
To configure from floppy disk, insert the Printrix Program Disk in Drive 1, and
Press Open-Apple CTRL RESET.  When the screen gives the option, press ESCAPE.
This boots the system and loads Apple BASIC.  Now insert the Printrix
Configuration Disk in Drive 1, and set the prefix by entering PREFIX/CONFIGURE.
At the prompt, enter -CONFIGURE.  The Configuration utility appears on screen.

1. The first question on screen asks which Apple computer you are using: Apple
   //e, //c, or IIgs.  Enter the appropriate number, and press RETURN.

   a. If you answered //e or IIgs, the next question concerns interface cards.
      Enter the numbers which corresponds to the manufacturer and type of
      interface card you are using, then enter the slot/port number.  Press
      RETURN after each input.

   b. If you answered //c, the next question concerns ports.  You may be
      printing through the printer port, or modem port Type A or Type B. Enter
      the appropriate information.  If you're using a modem port, respond to
      the question on baud rates.  Press RETURN after each input.

2. The next series of questions identifies your printer by manufacturer and
   model number.  Enter the correct codes, pressing RETURN after each.

3. Finally, enter the number corresponding to the word processor you use, and
   press RETURN.

Printrix now displays all configuration information on screen. If you wish to
change any entries, press R and the configuration menus will return.  If the
settings are correct, replace the Configuration Disk with the Printrix Program
Disk, and press RETURN.  The configuration file will be copied to the Program
Disk.

Thereafter, you will need the Configuration Disk only when you need to change
the configuration settings.  To reconfigure, insert the Configuration Disk in
Drive 1, boot the system, and go through the same sequence, entering the new
information.

To run Printrix from this point, insert the Program Disk in Drive 1.  You may
either press Open-Apple CTRL RESET, which boots the system and loads Printrix
automatically, or you may set the prefix to the Printrix disk by entering
PREFIX/PRINTRIX and pressing RETURN, then entering -PRINTRIX.  Either method is
fine.

Hard Disk, 3.5 Inch Disk
------------------------
To configure Printrix from hard disk or 3.5 inch disk, set the prefix to
/diskname/PRINTRIX, type -CONFIGURE, and respond to the on-screen questions as
described above.  When the screen prompts you to inset your /PRINTRIX disk,
press RETURN, since you're already working from that disk.  (Or, if you're
working from another disk which contains the /PRINTRIX subdirectory, enter the
pathname in response to the screen prompt.)  Then, to run Printrix, enter
-PRINTRIX and press RETURN.


                              CHAPTER 2 - LESSONS


This chapter contains two lessons which introduce you to the Printrix menus,
the Printrix embedded commands, creating and saving layout files, and moving
files through the system.

Lesson One is a simple business letter, containing some of the more common
formatting commands.  We recommend that all Printrix users work through this
lesson.

Lesson Two contains four special applications:  mailing labels, tables,
graphics insertion, and printing in columns.  Select the applications you need
from this lesson, as you need them.


LESSON ONE - Business Letter
----------------------------
In this lesson, you will learn how to use a standard layout file and a few
embedded commands to produce a typical business letter.  Formatting features
include margin changes, font changes, boldface, italics, and tabs.

To Begin:
To begin this lesson, you should already have ready Chapter 1 and configured
Printrix for your printer.  We suggest that you also read through Chapter 3 for
a quick overview of Printrix.

Assumptions:
We're assuming that you are using an ImageWriter, or printer of similar
resolution (with print densities between 120-200 dots per inch).  The fonts
used in this lesson have been chosen accordingly.  If your printer is either
above or below this range, the print will be a little large or a little small,
respectively.  Either ignore it for the time being, or load new fonts in the
appropriate sizes.  See Chapter 6 for instructions on loading fonts, and
Appendix C for information on the fonts available.

The sample text files have been created in ASCII Soft, so use the text files
we've provided, with Printrix configured for ASCII Soft.  Then, when you're
ready to typeset your own text files, you'll reconfigure Printrix for your word
processor.

The lessons are written for people running from a floppy disk.  If you're using
a hard disk, the prefix will be /diskname/PRINTRIX for all fonts and layout
files.

Step One:  Prepare the Text file
-------------------------------
Load your word processor and input the text to be typeset.  (Since this is a
lesson, we've already created a text file for you.  It's on the Printrix
Program Disk, under the filename TXT.LETTER.)  We've deliberately included
several common formatting commands to show you how they're used.

Step Two: Load a Layout File
----------------------------
Insert the Printrix program disk in Drive 1 and press Open-Apple CTRL RESET.
You'll see the Main Menu appear on screen.  (See Fig. 1 - Main Menu).  From the
Main Menu, press L to enter the Layout Document work area.  (See Fig. 2 -
Layout Document Menu.)  Press L again to load a layout file.

We've created a layout file for you named LAY.LETTER.  It's on the Program
Disk, so enter /PRINTRIX for the prefix, and LAY.LETTER for the filename, and
confirm.  The fonts are on the same disk, and they will be loaded
automatically.

Take a look at this layout file.  Press T to examine the text settings.  (See
Figure 3 - Text Format Menu.)  Note that we'll be typesetting on 8.5 x 11
paper, with a top margin of 1.5 inches, side and bottom margins of 1 inch.  The
justification is set to Fill.  Font 1 is active.  No page numbers, one copy of
the letter. The tabs are set to .5 inches and 4 inches.  Then press ESCAPE to
return to the Layout Document Menu.

Now press F to look at the font library.  (See Fig. 4 - Font Library Menu.)
There are two fonts loaded: 1 and 2.  Font 1 is active (note the asterisk), so
typesetting will begin with that font.  (This duplicates the Active Font
information on the Text Format Menu.)

This is your opportunity to load new fonts, if you like.  You may also examine
the font options by pressing C, but don't change any settings right now.  You
may also look at the Graphic Format Menu by pressing G from the Layout Document
Menu.

Now, press ESCAPE from the Layout Document Menu to return to the Main Menu.

Step Three: Print a Document
----------------------------
Press P from the Main Menu.  The text file to be printed, TXT.LETTER, is on the
Program Disk, so enter /PRINTRIX and TXT.LETTER to the on-screen questions, and
confirm the choice.

The Print Document Menu appears on the screen, giving you a final chance to
change the text settings or to return to the Layout Document Menu.  This menu
is a duplicate of the Text Format Menu, except for the print options at the
bottom.  Make sure your printer is on-line, and press RETURN to begin
typesetting.

That's it - your letter is ready to mail.

Explanation of the Embedded Commands

Take a look at the typeset letter, and notice the effects of the embedded
commands.  Following is a brief explanation of each:

^TAB      Jumps typesetting to the next tabstop
^ML=+1    Adds one inch to the current left margin value
^MR=+1    Adds one inch to the current right margin value
^Fi=Y     Turns Italics on
^FI=N     Turns Italics off
^FH=1     Sets horizontal boldface to 1
^FH-0     Sets horizontal boldface to 0
^ML=-1    Subtracts one inch from the current left margin value
^MR=-1    Subtracts one inch from the current right margin value
^F=2      Switches to Font 2
^F=1      Switches to Font 1

It may have looked complicated, but now you see how simple it is.  You may use
all, any, or none of these commands, as you like.  For details on each command,
see Chapter Seven.

LESSON TWO - Special Applications
--------------------------------
In this lesson, you will learn how to set up layout files and text files for
mailing labels, for tables, for printing a graphic with your letter, and for
printing in newspaper-style columns (only possible with selected printers).

We assume that you've already worked through Lesson One and are comfortable
with its contents.  The assumptions about your printer are still in effect.

Mailing Labels
--------------
The following combination of text file and layout file allows you to print
names and addresses on mailing labels which measure 3.5 inches horizontally and
1 inch vertically.  These labels are arranged vertically (a long strip of
labels).  The 1 inch vertical measurement is the distance from the top of one
label to the top of the next.

Step One:  Create the Text file

The following text file, TXT.MLABEL, is on the Program Disk.


Text file:


James Jones
1235 Peachtree Avenue
Atlanta, VA 23535
^NPAmy Anderson
394 Harrison Way
Santa Ana, Ct 07836
^NPWilliam Wilson
74614 Paseo Doble
Houston, TX 73573.......and so on


The ^NP command at the beginning of each new line causes Printrix to jump to
the top of the next page (defined by the layout files as the top of the next
label).

Step Two: Design and Save the Layout File
-----------------------------------------
Load LAY.LETTER as you did in Lesson 1.  We'll adapt it to mailing labels, then
save it under a new name for reuse.

Press T to enter the Text Format Menu.  Here, enter new settings for Form Size
(3.5 in. x 1 in., HxV).  The margins also have to be changed; set each margin
to .1 inch.  Everything else on this menu is fine as it is, so press ESCAPE to
return to the Main Menu.

If you want to change fonts, press F to enter the Font Library and load as in
Lesson One.

Again, no graphics, so skip the Graphics Format Menu.

Back at the Layout Document Menu, press S to save the layout file.  Save it to
the Program Disk under the filename LAY.MLABEL by entering /PRINTRIX and
LAY.MLABEL.  Now press ESCAPE to return to the Main Menu.

Step Three:  Print
------------------
Load your printer with mailing labels of the appropriate size.  If you don't
have any, just print on regular paper and use your imagination.  From the Main
Menu, press P, specify TXT.MLABEL, and print.

That's it.

Tables
------
Tables, or columns of numbers, are frequently part of a report.  They are not
difficult, but they do require some special font and tab commands.

Most of the Printrix fonts are set to proportional spacing, which looks good
for text but makes it impossible to line up columns.  The following layout file
has a font specially adapted to table printing.

Step 1: Create the Text file

We've put the following text file on the Program Disk under the filename
TXT.TABLE.

Text file:
----------
^F=1January^F=3^TAB$ 4926.96^TAB2633.33^TAB$ 1039.52
^F=1Febraury^F=3^TAB$26047.58^TAB$ 368.11^TAB$ 3463.85
^F=1March^F=3^TAB$ 2356.06^TAB$1357.07^TAB$34764.47

Font 3 is defined by the text file for use with columns.  The tab commands jump
the typesetting to the correct columns; spaces are used within the figures to
align the decimal points.

Step 2: Create and Save the Layout File
---------------------------------------

Begin by Loading LAY.LETTER as before.

The text settings are fine, so we'll go straight to the Font Library by
pressing F.

Load Font 1 into Position 3, through the following procedure.

1. Press 3 to make Position 3 active.

2. Press L to load a font into that position.

3. The font we'll use is SET.CASLON25, on /PRINTRIX, so enter that
   information.

Now, we need to adapt this font.  Press C to change font parameters.  The
Change Font Parameters menu appears on screen (See Fig. 5).

1. Set the font to non-proportional spacing by pressing P.

2. Set the spacebar width to equal the horizontal cell size.  Look at
the top of the screen for that value, then press W and enter the number (here,
it's 26).

3. Set the character spacing gap to -9.  This causes the character
cells to overlap when printed.  (The -g value is arrived at by
experimentation: different fonts and different printers require
different settings.  As a rule of thumb, start with a figure that is the
horizontal cell size divided by three, then make that cell          negative).

Again, there are no graphics, so return to the Layout Document Menu to save
this layout file under the filename LAY.TABLE.

Step Three: Print
-----------------
Return to the Main Menu, load your printer with regular paper, enter the Print
Document area, specify TXT.TABLE, and print.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graphics Insertion

This ability to insert graphics into your document can be used in many ways:
printing a letterhead with the letter, printing a logo on a card or letter,
adding a chart or illustration to a report, or just adding some design interest
to a letter, invitation, or greeting card.

To insert a graphic, you must have already created the graphic in one of the
three formats Printrix accepts: Fontrix Graffile, single hi-res screen graphic,
or "Print Shop style" clip art graphic.  For this lesson, we've provided a
single-screen graphic (created by Fontrix), named PIC.DRAGON on /PRINTRIX.  The
text file which calls the graphic is a postcard-sized invitation.

Step One:  Create the Text file
------------------------------
The following text file calls the graphic and causes it to print on the second
line of text.  It is located on /PRINTRIX under the filename TXT.INVITE.

Text file:

^GPS="PIC.DRAGON"
^F=1You Are Invited
to the Twenty-Third Annual
Open House

^F=2^At Pickens Elementary School
3135 Westwood Drive
Bloomington, IN
^F=3Refreshments

The embedded command to call the graphic is located on the first line of text.
Note that this invitation also uses an embedded command to change
justification, and to change fonts.

Step Two: Design and Save the Layout File

Load LAY.LETTER as before.  Since this invitation will be photocopied onto 3x5
postcards (3 in. vertical, 5 in. horizontal), we must reset the margins to
create a 3x5 printing window.  We must also position the graphic on the page.

Press T to enter the Text Format Menu.  Reset the margins as follows:  Left -
1, Right - 1.5, Top - 4, Bottom - 4.  (The horizontal form size [8.5 in.] minus
the horizontal dimension of the printing window [5 in.] leaves 3.5 in., which
is allocated between the left and right margins.  A similar process gives the
top and bottom margin values.)

Exit the Text Format Menu and press G to enter the Graphic Format Menu.  (See
Fig. 6)  Here, set Horizontal Placement to R.  Nothing else is necessary,
although you may experiment with the parameters as you like.

Exit the Graphics Menu and press F to enter the Font Library Menu.  The text
file uses three fonts.  Look at the text file to see which fonts are used
where.  Then, load fonts accordingly.  Load SET.OLDENG30 into Position 1,
SET.HELVET30 into Position 2, and SET.CASLON25 into Position 3.  All of these
fonts are on the /PRINTRIX disk.  When you've loaded SET.CASLON25, press C to
change its parameters, and set italics to Yes (just a design whimsy).

Return to the Layout Document Menu and save this layout file under the filename
LAY.INVITE.

Step Three: Print
-----------------
Return to the Main Menu, and press P to Print a Document.  Specify TXT.INVITE
on /PRINTRIX, press RETURN, and print.

Two-Column Printing
-------------------
On certain printers with reverse linefeed capabilities, such as the
Imagewriter, Printrix can typeset in two newspaper-style columns.  This means
that text runs down the first column, then back to the top of the second
column.

You may control columns from the menu or with embedded commands.  An embedded
command to end two-column printing takes effect on the next printed page.  An
embedded command to begin two-column printing takes effect on the current
printing line or the following line, depending on the placement of the command.

This example shows the interaction of menu and embedded commands to center a
headline across a page, then begin two-column printing.

Step One:  Create the Text file
------------------------------
~The following text file is located on /PRINTRIX under the name TXT.ARTICLE.

Text file:
^J=C^F=1NEW TYPESETTING SOFTWARE SAVES LIVES

^C=Y^J=F^F=2Late last March, two teenagers were strolling along a beach in
Southern California, watching the sunset and generally taking it easy.
Something glinting in the last rays of sun caught their eye, and they picked up
a bottle, awkwardly corked with palm leaves and appearing to have a message
inside.

The message read:  "To whomever finds this bottle - please send rescue mission
as our supplies are running low and our health is bad."  It went on to the give
details of the stranded travelers' location; they are on an island several
hundred miles from shore.
^NPThe message had been typeset with Printrix, a new typesetting program which
offers unparalleled clarity and diversity in fonts and page design.  Said one
of the teenagers, "As soon as we saw the graphic excellence of the message, we
knew we had to act."  So they contacted the local Coast Guard.

The rescue was quick and efficient.  Five yachtsmen were brought in from their
stranded yacht the next day, treated for minor health problems, and released.
According to Wendell Walker, the yacht's owner and captain, "I don't know what
we'd have done if we hadn't had the resources to attract someone's attention.
Not just any written message is effective these days - we used Printrix to make
sure.

The columns command is positioned first on the printing line.  The ^NP command
in this text file moves the typesetting to the top of the next column.

Step Two: Design the Layout File
--------------------------------
Load LAY.LETTER, and set right and left margins to 1.5 inches.  Use any fonts
you like for the headline (Font 1) and the body (Font 2).  Leave Two Column
Print Set to No, so that the headline will be centered across the entire page.

If you have one of these printers (Apple DMP, ImageWriter, ImageWriter II; C.
Itoh 8510, 8510 SCP; Fujitsu DL2400, DL2600; NEC 8023, 8025, CP-7, P5, P5XL,
P6, P7; Texas Instruments 855, 857, 865; Toshiba 1340, 1351, P351, P351C),
Printrix automatically utilizes a reverse linefeed capacity to return to the
top of the page between columns.

If your printer was not listed above, you must return to the top of the page
manually.  To prepare for this, set Wait at End of Page to Yes.

Step Three: Print
-----------------
From the Print Document Menu, specify TXT.ARTICLE, and print.

If Wait at End of Page is set to No, you're done.  If Wait at End of Page is
set to Yes, the printer will pause at the bottom of the first column.  At this
point, turn the printer off-line, roll the paper back, turn it on-line, and
press the spacebar to resume printing.

                             CHAPTER 3:  CONCEPTS

This chapter is designed to give you a global, intuitive understanding of
Printrix as a typesetting tool.  We recommend that all users read this material
early in their acquaintance with Printrix.

Covered in this chapter are the raw materials used by Printrix, the operations
performed on them by Printrix, and the ways the user may control these
operations.  We also explain key terms and concepts.


Printrix
--------
Printrix is a typesetting program, which means that it offers you a variety of
font, graphic, and page design possibilities.  The fonts and page designs are
applied to existing word processor text files.  The process of selecting fonts
and manipulating page design is called formatting.

Why use Printrix?  Without Printrix, you are limited to the fonts built into
your printer.  These "native" fonts vary in quality, and are limited to the
page design capacities of your word processor.  Word processors vary greatly in
the complexity and control they offer users.  Printrix supplements the simple
word processing programs and complements the more advanced.  Finally, Printrix
allows you to insert graphics into your text file during printing, thus
eliminating the need for manual paste-up.

When typesetting with Printrix, the user provides the text file and any
graphics to be used.  Printrix provides the fonts and formatting controls.  You
may change the fonts and formatting through the Printrix layout file or with
embedded commands.

Text files
---------
Printrix accepts text files form AppleWorks, AppleWriter, and Word Juggler.  No
special save process is required.

Printrix also accepts ASCII text files.  Some, but not all, word processors
have a special save procedure to convert their native text files into standard
ASCII.  See your word processor's manual for information.  ("ASCII" stands for
American Standard Code for Information Exchange.  Each letter, numeral,
punctuation symbol, space, etc., has a corresponding number.  Information is
stored and manipulated in the form of the ASCII equivalents, rather than in its
original form.)

Embedded Commands
-----------------
The embedded commands are part of the text file, entered by the user through
the word processor.  If the text file was created by a supported word
processor, Printrix reads both the word processor's standard embedded commands
for page design, and special Printrix-style embedded commands which supplement
the word processor's capacities.

If the text file was created by an unsupported word processor and converted to
standard ASCII, there are no word processor embedded commands.  All formatting
must be done through Printrix-style commands or through the layout file.
Embedded commands take effect within a document at the time Printrix reads
them.  They give "local" control of formatting.

Layout Files
------------
The layout file consists of a set of Printrix menus grouped together to control
all aspects of a typeset page.  Three main menus control text, graphics, and
fonts.  A layout file may be designed by the user for specific documents, and
saved to disk for reuse at any time, with the same or different text files.
Commands from a layout file affect the entire document, unless an embedded
command changes a setting or a new layout file is loaded.  Layout files offer
"global" control of formatting.

Fonts
-----
Fonts, like type, are complete sets of letters, numerals, and punctuation of a
particular design.

Printrix's fonts exist as files on disk.  These font files were created using
Printrix's sister program, Fontrix.  Font files are loaded from disk into your
computer's memory in order to be used for typesetting.  Printrix can use a
maximum of four fonts in typesetting any one line.  An unlimited number of
fonts may be used in a document.

The Printrix fonts are "bit-mapped," meaning that they are formed by
arrangements of dots in a rectangular grid.  When Printrix reads a text file,
it automatically converts the numerical code for each character in the text
file into the corresponding bit-map.  The individual bit-maps are composed into
lines of type.  Each line of type is then sent to your printer as a unit.

Graphics
--------
Computer graphics are files on disk which contain illustrations, charts,
graphics, art, or other images stored in a bit-mapped format.  Printrix accepts
and prints three types of graphics: the standard single hi-res screen, the
Fontrix Graffile, and the four-sector Print Shop compatible graphic.

A Graffile is a graphic image of varying size, created by Fontrix.  It may
contain fonts and other images in any combination.

A single hi-res screen can be created by Fontrix or by a number of Apple
graphics programs.

A four-sector clip art graphic can be created by Print Shop or by a number of
Apple graphics programs which are compatible with Print Shop.

Output to the Printer
---------------------
Since the Printrix fonts are bit-mapped, or arrangements of dots, they are
printed in graphics mode.  This means that the information sent tyo your
printer is a stream of dots.  The capacity to insert graphics into text is a
consequence of this feature.

The alternative to printing in graphics mode is printing in text mode.  This
means that the information sent to your printer is the ASCII code for the
character in the text file.  The printer then converts the code into the
corresponding character in the printer's native fonts.  Word processors utilize
text mode.  This requires them to depend on the native fonts of the printer,
and prevents their merging of text and graphics.

Consequences of Graphics Mode
-----------------------------
As mentioned above, printing in graphics mode allows Printrix to merge graphics
into the text, since the text is also graphic.

Printing in graphics mode also allows much more flexibility in page design,
linefeed advance, and font choice.

Graphics mode and text mode vary in printing speed: text mode is almost always
faster since less information is being sent to the printer.

Finally, printing in graphics mode means that the size and proportion of the
output is dependent on your printer's resolution and aspect ratio.

Printer Resolution
------------------
Printer resolution, or print density, refers to the number of printer dots per
inch.  Resolution is measured for both horizontal and vertical dimensions.
Most printers offer several choices of resolution.  Low-resolution printers may
print 60-100 dots per inch; medium-resolution printers may print 120-180 dots
per inch; high-resolution printers print 300 or more dots per inch.  In
general, the higher your printer's resolution, the better the quality of print
from Printrix.

Since Printrix fonts exist as bit-maps, with horizontal and vertical dimensions
measured in dots, a given font will produce output of different sizes when
printed on printers of different resolutions.  High-resolution printers will
produce smaller output; low-resolution printers will produce larger output.
Printer resolution should be taken into consideration when selecting fonts.

Aspect Ratio
------------
Aspect ratio is the relationship of horizontal resolution to vertical
resolution (width to height).  Some printers have a "square" aspect ratio, in
which the horizontal and vertical values are equal.  Other printers have a
"non-square" aspect ratio, in which the horizontal and vertical values are
significantly different.

If you create a square on screen, with each side measuring 100 dots, a printer
with a square aspect ratio will print a square, 100 dots per side.  A printer
with a non-square aspect ratio will print a rectangle, also measuring 100 dots
per side.  The proportions of the rectangle depend on the printer's aspect
ratio.

This same principle applies to graphics and to the Printrix fonts.  Depending
on your printer, a given font may appear elongated, compressed, or normal when
printed.  Again, aspect ratio should be considered when selecting fonts.

You may like the effect of aspect ratio on the appearance of your output and
choose to accept it.  Alternatively, you may use the magnification commands to
counteract the effects of aspect ratio.  When magnifying a font, be sure that
the original font is small enough so that when you magnify it, the result is
the size desired.

The Apple ImageWriter has two print modes.  The first has a non-square aspect
ratio, 161x72 dpi, and produces tall narrow print.  The second, quad density,
has a near-square aspect ratio, 160x144 dpi, and produces print of normal
proportions.



                            CHAPTER 4 - CONVENTIONS

This chapter covers the conventions used by Printrix.  These conventions
include syntax for both menu input and embedded commands.  Covered here are
filenames, file locations, use of the wildcard, letter values, number values,
and relative vs. absolute values.  The exact form or code used for input is
called "syntax."

Menu Input
----------
Printrix menus call for different types of responses:  filenames and locations,
letter values, and numerical values.  In some cases, Printrix already suggests
responses to the menu options.  You may accept the default responses by
pressing RETURN, or you may change the responses as follows.

Filenames
---------
Filenames are entered in the form they exist on disk.  A filename may have a
maximum of fifteen characters, must be with a letter, and may contain letters,
numbers, and periods.

For convenience and clarity inside Printrix, we have used standard naming
conventions to separate the file categories.  All font names are in the form
SET.name; all layout file names are in the form LAY.name.

You may continue this convention if you like, and we suggest that you do.
However, Printrix will try to load any file you specify into any part of the
program.  If you try to load a font as a layout file, or vice versa, Printrix
will display a "File Type Mismatch" message.

An additional message:  when saving layout files, use names which indicate the
text files they are used for.  You may find yourself creating files in pairs:
one text file and one layout file.

File Locations
--------------
Files are located in your system on disks, either floppy or rigid.  The disks
are identified by name.

Additionally, a disk may be subdivided into subdirectories, or paths, which
organize data storage and facilitate its use.  These paths are also identified
by name.

Therefore, in order to direct Printrix to a file, you must know the name of the
disk and any subdirectories which apply.  This location information is referred
to as the pathname, or "prefix."

Prefix information is entered into Printrix, with the filename, in the
following format:

          /prefix/filename

This may, in use, appear as:

          /diskname/path/filename

     or:

          /diskname/filename

Wildcards may not be used for pathname information.

The four Printrix disks are named /PRINTRIX, /CONFIGURE, /FONTS1, and /FONTS2.
None of them contain subdirectories.  When you boot Printrix, the prefix is
automatically set to /PRINTRIX.  You may load and save layout files to this
disk automatically as long as there is room on the disk.  To load files, and to
locate graphics and text files, you must enter the appropriate prefix.

Letter Values
-------------
Letter values, such as L, R, and C (for Left, Right, and Center) are entered by
pressing the letter corresponding to the parameter, such as H for Horizontal
Placement.  The letter value on screen will change to one of the other options.
Continue pressing H until the desired option appears.

Numerical Values
----------------
Numerical values, in response to menu options,are entered as absolute values,
meaning that the number on screen is based on the zero point for that
parameter.  In some cases, the value may be negative (e.g. character spacing
gap may be set to -8).

Wildcard Use
------------
Wildcards are a method for scanning a list of files and selecting the one you
want.  If you enter a wildcard in response to a Printrix menu, Printrix will
display on screen a list of all the files that match the wildcard, in the
specified location, and allow you to answer Yes or No to each file.  Wildcards
may be used only in response to menu questions.

The wildcard used by Printrix is the asterisk (*).  The asterisk replaces any
character or string of characters.  Therefore, if you were trying to load a
layout file, you could enter

          LAY.*

and all files on that disk which being with LAY.* would be displayed on screen,
one at a time.  You have the Yes/No option after each file.

If you enter *, all files on the disk will be displayed.  If you enter JOHN*,
all files which begin with JOHN will be displayed.

Wildcards may be used only for filenames.  They may not be used for pathnames.

Embedded Command Syntax
-----------------------
Embedded commands may be used for formatting or for graphics insertion.   The
commands are typed directly into the text file, in the forms given in the
reference section.  All embedded commands begin with a carat (^), followed by
one to three letters which identify the parameter.  In some cases, such as ^TAB
or ^NP, that's all.  In other cases, the command continues with an equals sign
(=) and then adds the value, which may be a number or a letter.  Letters in
embedded commands may be in either upper or lower case.  The letters used in
embedded commands match the letters used in the menus, for easy remembering.

          Examples: ^ML=3, ^GH=C, ^J=F

Filename and File Location
--------------------------
Printrix contains two embedded commands, the graphic print command and the load
layout file command, which require you to enter filename and file location in
the text file.

Filename and file location are input as they are for menus, with the addition
of quotation marks to set the prefix and filename off from the rest of the text
file.  Wildcards may not be used with embedded commands.

Example:

          As shown in ^GPG=/prefix/gfl.topo"the illustration

If the prefix is absent from the text file, or if its location information is
incorrect, Printrix will pause during printing and display a message asking you
to enter the correct location of the file.  You may search as many locations as
necessary, or you may omit the graphic and continue printing.  However, you may
not change the name of the graphic while printing.

Letter Values
-------------
Embedded commands which require letter values are entered into the text file by
typing the embedded command and the desired value.

          Examples: ^GH=C, ^GH=C, ^J=F

Numerical Values
----------------
Embedded commands which require numerical values are entered into the text file
by typing the embedded command and the desired values.  The range of accepted
values and the form for entering them varies according to the parameter.  For
each parameter, acceptable values and forms are specified in the reference
chapter.

Positive and Negative Values
----------------------------
In some cases, the numerical value must be positive.  For example, linefeed gap
may be set to 0 or any positive integer, but cannot be less than 0.

In some cases the numerical value may range from negative to positive, such as
with the character spacing gap.

When using a parameter which accepts negative values, the minus sign (-) always
means a negative value, NOT a relative value.

Relative and Absolute Values

In some cases, the numerical value is absolute only.  For instance, you may set
a page number to any positive integer, but you must specify the integer
directly.

In some cases, numerical values may be entered as either relative or absolute
values.  There are two ways of defining a numerical parameter (such as margins,
linefeed gap, etc.). Absolute values are calculated from a constant point, such
as the edge of the paper.  Relative values are calculated from the previous
value of the same parameter.

Relative values are entered as numbers wi8th a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.
Absolute values are entered as numbers, WITHOUT a plus or minus sign.  If you
are using a parameter which expects relative values, the minus sign (-) always
means "subtract from previous value," NOT a negative value of the parameter.

Examples:
^ML=1 sets the left margin one inch form the edge of the paper (absolute
value).

^ML=+1 adds one inch to the current left margin value (relative value).  If the
left margin had been 1.5 inches, the new setting is 2.5 inches.

^FL=6 sets the linefeed gap to six dots (absolute value).

^FL=-6 subtracts six dots from the linefeed gap of the current font (relative
value).  If that value had been 10, the new setting is 4.

Relative values are convenient for two main reasons:

Experimentation.  If you are trying out several possible formats, you can use
relative values within the text file, and change the starting values by menu
command.  This means that you will not have to re-open the text file to change
settings.

Convenience.  If you forget the original value of a parameter, but you know how
much you want to change it, you may use relative values and save yourself the
trouble of looking up the original value.

Isolating Command Values from Text
----------------------------------
If you use embedded commands, you may occasionally find that the numbers which
are part of the command are adjacent to numbers which are part of the text file
to be printed.

          Example:  Our new telephone number is ^F=2383-4862.

Printrix interprets the entire string of numbers as a font number.  When it
can't find a font numbered 2383, it continues printing in the previous font and
ignores the numbers.  The result is the absence of those numbers from the
printed text.

To avoid this, enclose the numerical part of the command in parentheses:

          Example:  Our new telephone number is ^F=(2)383-4862.

If the command contains an = or - sign, enclose it in parentheses as well:

          Example:  ^ML=(=.5)2001 has become a film classic.



                          CHAPTER 5 - WORD PROCESSORS

Printrix accepts several types of text files for typesetting.  Some preparation
may be necessary, depending on the type of text file and the amount of
formatting desired.  Preparation may involve a special save processor or
addition/substitution of embedded commands.  This chapter covers the types of
text files which you may use, and the preparation process.

Overview
--------
Text files fall into two basic categories:  formatted and unformatted.
Formatted text files are also called "native" text files.  Unformatted text
files are also called "standard ASCII" or "generic ASCII" text files.

Formatting refers to the process of inserting special codes into the text file
to control its printing.  These codes do everything from sending carriage
returns and form feeds to the printer to changing fonts.

All word processors insert some commands into the text file.  Some codes are
standard across word processors, while others vary greatly.  A text file which
contains only standard codes is called "unformatted," and is able to be read
and processed by a variety of programs.  A text file which contains nonstandard
codes can usually be read and processed only by the word processing program
used to create it, and other programs which contain special adaptations for
those unique codes.

Printrix will accept any unformatted text file, and formatted text files from
certain word processors:  AppleWorks, AppleWriter, Word Juggler, and
WordPerfect.

ASCII Text files
---------------
These files contain only carriage return/linefeed commands.  Some word
processors can convert native text files into ASCII files by stripping out the
nonstandard commands.  If you use an unsupported word processor, see its manual
for an ASCII conversion process.  If this is possible in your word processor,
you may use it to create text files for typesetting through Printrix.

You must find out through experimentation whether your ASCII file is Hard or
Soft Return.  These two types of files differ in the type of carriage return
commands they contain.

Hard Return
-----------
ASCII Hard Return files contain carriage return commands ONLY at the ends of
paragraphs.  When viewed on screen, the line of text extends off the screen to
the right.  Word wrap is not in effect.

To use these files with Printrix, merely add any formatting commands that you
like, make sure that you're configured to ASCII Hard, and print.

Soft Return
-----------
ASCII Soft Return files contain two types of carriage returns.  Hard returns
are placed at the ends of paragraphs, AND soft returns are placed between lines
of a paragraph, where the word processor has wrapped the text.  Most or all of
a paragraph may be seen on screen at once.

Since Printrix will re-wrap the text depending on the font and margin settings,
the soft returns in the text file must be converted to spaces so that
typesetting may continue on the current line.

Printrix performs this conversion automatically.  However, the hard carriage
returns must be kept operative, to allow you to begin a new paragraph, force a
new line, etc.

Because the same code may be used for both hard and soft carriage returns,
Printrix has a special convention for distinguishing between them.  Any single
carriage return is interpreted as a soft return and converted to a space,
allowing typesetting to continue ON THE SAME LINE.  Any PAIR of carriage
returns is interpreted as one hard return, and forces typesetting to continue
ON THE NEXT LINE.

Accordingly, to use ASCII Soft Return files with Printrix, move through the
text file and add carriage return as necessary.  For example, if you want to
double-space between paragraphs, the text file must contain four carriage
returns in that location.  If you want to single-space the lines of an address,
there must be two carriage returns between each line.  Be sure that the
carriage returns actually occur in pairs, with no intervening spaces or other
invisible characters.

Finally, add any Printrix formatting commands that you like, make sure that
you're configured for ASCII Soft, and print.

AppleWorks
----------
Printrix can read AppleWorks files, interpret some of the embedded commands,
and filter out the rest.

If your AppleWorks files contain formatting commands, refer to the chart in
Chapter 5 to see if those commands are supported.  If they are, you may print
the text file without alterations.  If they are not, you must insert the
equivalent Printrix commands.  You may also add other Printrix commands to
expand the formatting possibilities.  Then, make sure that you're configured fo
AppleWorks, and print.

AppleWriter
-----------
Printrix has a special AppleWriter adaptation which automatically ignores the
AppleWriter codes.  Therefore, you may use native AppleWriter text files.  To
prepare them for typesetting, just add any Printrix commands that you like,
make sure that you're configured for AppleWriter, and print.

Word Juggler
------------
Printrix has a special adaptation for Word Juggler files, which interprets and
carries out some of the common formatting commands and ignores the rest. This
means you may use the native text files from Word Juggler.

If these files contain formatting commands, refer to the chart in Chapter 5 to
see whether or not the specific command is supported by Printrix.  If it is, no
action is required.  If it is not, insert the equivalent Printrix command. You
may also insert other Printrix commands, to expand the formatting and
typesetting possibilities.  Make sure that you're configured for Word Juggler,
and print.

WordPerfect
-----------
Printrix also has a special adaptation for WordPerfect files, interpreting and
carrying out some of the common formatting commands and ignoring the rest.
This means that you may use the native text files from WordPerfect.

If these files contain formatting commands, refer to the chart in Chapter 5 to
see whether or not the specific command is supported by Printrix.  If it is, no
action is required.  If it is not, insert the equivalent Printrix command. You
may also insert other Printrix commands, to expand the formatting and
typesetting possibilities.  Make sure that you're configured for WordPerfect,
and print.

            Word Processor Commands Supported by Printrix


An "X" in a cell indicates that the word processor's embedded command for this
function is automatically supported by Printrix.  If a cell is blank, the word
processor's embedded command is not supported, and you must use the Printrix
form of the command.  For example, to utilize tab characters in AppleWorks,
AppleWriter, and Word Juggler, insert ^TAB in your text file.  If you're using
WordPerfect, the tab key is sufficient.



                          CHAPTER 6 - PRINTRIX MENUS

Printing in Printrix is controlled by a combination of menu commands, seen
on-screen in Printrix, and embedded commands, inserted into your text file from
your word processor.  The embedded commands are covered in detail in Chapter
Seven.  This chapter introduces you to the Printrix menus - their interaction
within Printrix, how they control your location within the program's work
areas, and the individual commands which are contained in each menu.

First Time in Printrix
----------------------
To enter Printrix for the first time, boot the Printrix Program Disk by
inserting it into Drive 1 and pressing Open-Apple CTRL RESET.  Then press
ESCAPE, insert the Printrix Configuration Disk and Follow the configuration
procedure described in Chapter 1.

Thereafter, when you load Printrix, you will enter at the Main Menu.  To do
this, boot the Printrix Program Disk by inserting it into Drive 1 and pressing
Open-Apple CTRL RESET, or set the prefix to /diskname/PRINTRIX and enter
-PRINTRIX.

Printrix Main Menu
------------------
When you enter Printrix, a layout file name LAY.PRINTRIX is automatically
loaded.  The screen displays the process, and may ask you for assistance in
locating the fonts.  Printrix then moves to the Main Menu. See illustration in
Lesson two.

The Main Menu is a crossroads between the two work areas of the program:
printing and page design.  You choose your first task from this menu.  After
you've finished that task, return to the Main Menu to move to another work area
or to exit. (There's one exception: for speed and convenience, you may move
directly between the Print Document Menu and the Layout Document Menu.)

To move to a work area from the Main Menu, enter the corresponding letter.  To
return to the Main Menu from any of its three branches, press ESCAPE.  If you
are several branches down in one of the work areas, you may need to press
ESCAPE several times.  To exit Printrix from the Main Menu, press ESCAPE.

See lesson two, figure 1, to see the format of the Printrix Main Menu.

Layout Document Menu
--------------------
Pressing L from the Main Menu brings up a set of menus which allow you to load
an existing layout file from disk, to save the current layout file settings to
disk, and to design the printed page, including text, graphics, and fonts.

To load an existing layout file, press L from the Layout Document Menu, and
enter the prefix and filename of the desired layout file.

If you wish to save the current page and font settings as a layout file, press
S from the Layout Document Menu.  Enter the prefix and filename.  You may write
over the current layout file by saving the new file to the same location under
the same filename, or you may create a new layout file by entering a different
location or a different filename.  The layout file will contain all settings
from the Text Format Menu, the Graphics Format Menu, the Font Library, and the
font parameters.

To enter the Font Library, the Text Format Menu, or the Graphics Format Menu,
press the corresponding letter from the Layout Document Menu.  When you have
completed your work in the Layout Document Menu, press ESCAPE.  Printrix will
return you to your previous location (the Main Menu or the Print Document
Menu).

See Lesson Two, Figure 2, to view the format of the Printrix Layout Document
Menu.

Text Format Menu
----------------
Pressing R from the Layout Document Menu brings up a new menu, the Text Format
Menu, which lists all options for controlling the placement of text on the
page, and related commands.  Included are such parameters as form size,
margins, text justification, page numbers, numbers of copies, etc.

You may accept the default values, or change as many as you like by pressing
the letter which corresponds to the parameter to be changed.  If the parameter
calls for a numerical or text value, enter the value desired.  If the parameter
offers a set of delimited options, pressing its menu letter will automatically
cause the value to change.  (For example, press J for Justification.  F will
change to L, to R, to C, and back to F, as you continue pressing J.  When all
parameters are set as desired, press ESCAPE to return to the Layout Document
Menu.

See Lesson two, Figure 3, to view the format of the Printrix Text Format Menu.

Graphics Format Menu
--------------------
Pressing G from the Layout Document Menu brings up the Graphics Format Menu,
which displays all options for controlling the printing and placement of
graphics in the document.  Included are such parameters as magnification,
horizontal positioning, and relationship of text to graphics.

You may accept the default values, or change as many as you like by pressing
the letter which corresponds to the parameter to be changed, and either
entering the desired value or continuing to press the menu letter until the
desired value appears on screen.  When all parameters are set as desired, press
ESCAPE to return to the Layout Document Menu.

See Lesson two, Figure 6, to view the format of the Printrix Graphic Format
Menu.

Font Library Format Menu
------------------------
Pressing F from the Layout Document Menu brings up a sequence of three menus.
The first menu displays the fonts that currently are loaded for use in
typesetting.  Each font is assigned a number.  These numbers are used to
identify fonts for manipulation by menu and by embedded command.  An asterisk
by the number indicates the current active font.

If you wish to load one or more new fonts, select the number into which the new
font will be loaded by pressing the corresponding number key.  Then press L
from the list of commands displayed at the bottom of the screen.  A question
appears on the screen, asking you to identify the desired new font by prefix
and filename.  Enter the necessary information, pressing RETURN after each
entry.  Press RETURN alone to accept the default values.  Repeat this process
for any other new fonts.

If you wish to delete one of the fonts currently loaded, select the
corresponding number, and press D to empty that position.

If you wish to change the parameters of one of the current fonts, select that
font, then press C.  A new menu will appear on screen, listing all
possibilities for font manipulation.  Change as many as you like, and press
ESCAPE to return to the previous menu.

A final option from the Font Library Menu allows you to reload a group of fonts
from a specified area.  See Chapter Seven for details on this function.

When all fonts and font parameters are set as desired, press ESCAPE to return
to the Layout Document Menu.

See Lesson two to view the format of the Printrix Font Library Format Menu.

Print Document Menu

Pressing P from the Main Menu brings up a sequence of two menus.

The first menu allows you to specify the text file to be printed, with the
prefix information necessary to locate the file on disk.

The second menu displays the current printing parameters, as determined by the
layout file in use.  The settings include margins, form size, justification,
color, page numbers, etc.  You may accept the parameters as they stand, or
change any or all of them.  See Chapter Seven for details on each parameter.

This screen is a duplicate of the Text Format Menu.  Any changes here will be
reflected there, and vice versa.  If you want to change any font or graphics
parameters, or if you want to save any changes made to the page design from the
Print Document Menu, you must enter the corresponding menu from the Layout
Document Menu.

For convenience, you may move directly from the Print Document Menu to the
Layout Document Menu, without returning to the Main Menu.  Press L, as
displayed on screen.  When you have finished your work in the Layout Document
Menu, press ESCAPE.  If you entered the Layout Document Menu from the Print
Document Menu, you will return to it.  If you entered from the Main Menu,
Printrix will return you there.

When all parameters are set as desired, press RETURN to accept them and begin
the printing process.  When printing is complete, Printrix will return to the
Main Menu.  You may halt printing at any time by pressing ESCAPE.  Printrix
kills the print job and returns to the Main Menu.



                             CHAPTER 7 - REFERENCE

This chapter gives detailed information on Printrix commands, including menu
commands and embedded commands.

This chapter is organized into four sections:  layout file parameters, text
format parameters, font library parameters, and graphics format parameters.

The function of each command is defined.  Then, all acceptable options or
settings for the commands are given, along with the correct form of response.
Any special considerations are included.  These may include the command's
interactions with other commands, or certain circumstances which affect the
command's operation.  When necessary, examples are given for the best use of
commands.

Finally, some commands may be used for particular typesetting effects.  These
special uses are defined and demonstrated.

Save Layout File
----------------
This option creates a disk file that records the current setting of all
printing parameters from the Text Format Menu, the Font Library Menu, and the
Graphic Format Menu.  This includes all font settings from the Change Font
Parameters Menu such as italics, boldface, etc.

Once you've saved a layout file, you may load it again at any time, for use
with the same text file or with a different one.  The layout file will restore
the previously saved values of the printing parameters, overriding the values
it finds in memory, or in the font files.

NOTE: If you want to change the name of a layout file, do not use the ProDOS
"Rename" function.  Instead, load the layout file into Printrix, then save it
again under the new name.

Location:

     Layout Document Menu (menu command only)

Procedure:


1. Set the printing parameters to the desired values, using the Text Format
   Menu, the Font Library Menu, and the Graphics Format Menu.  Then return to
   the Layout Document Menu.

2. Choose option S.

3. In response to Printrix's screen prompts, enter the prefix and filename
   specifying the disk where the file will be located, and the name of the new
   file.  Use the LAY.filename form for layout files.

If you accept the default filename, the new layout file will be written over
the old file.  If you want to keep old files, enter a new filename.

Create a "Default" Layout

When Printrix is booted, it automatically looks for and loads a layout file
names LAY.PRINTRIX.  If you use Printrix for one application a majority of the
time, you'll probably have a standard layout file.  You can load those values
automatically, every time you load Printrix, by naming this layout file
LAY.PRINTRIX.

Load a Layout File.
-------------------
This menu option lets you recall a layout file that has been previously saved
to disk.  Loading a layout file will restore the printing parameters to the
values current at the time of saving.

A layout file also reloads the fonts, in the same order as they were saved, so
that they may be referred to by the same numbers.  Their individual parameters
are also restored to the values specified by the layout file.

You may load as may layout files as you wish within a document.  When the
document has finished printing, Printrix automatically reloads the original
layout file, which it had previously saved to disk in a temporary file called
LAY.TEMP.

Location:

Layout Document Menu
Embedded Command
     ^LL="/prefix/filename"

Procedure - Menu Command


1. From the Layout Document Menu, choose option L.

2. Respond to the program's screen prompts by entering the drive and prefix
   where the desired layout file is located.

   Printrix now searches that location for the specified file.  If it finds the
   file, an on-screen message asks you to confirm.  If it cannot find the file,
   an on-screen message asks for further instructions.

3. Answer Y, and Printrix asks for the directory in which the layout's fonts
   may be found and loads the layout.  Or answer N, and Printrix continues to
   search.

Procedure
---------
At the desired point in the text file, insert the load layout command:

          ^LL="/prefix/filename"

You may include or omit the location.  If the location is included, Printrix
searches that area.  When it finds the specified file, that set of parameters
and fonts is loaded.  If the file is not found in that location, or if you do
not specify that location, Printrix will pause typesetting and display a
question on screen requesting the necessary information.

In Use

Loading a layout file by embedded commands will cause Printrix to begin a new
line of print.  Therefore, we recommend that you position the command at the
beginning or end of a paragraph, or between paragraphs.

Font Files
----------
When you save a layout file, Printrix stores information obtained from the Font
Library about the fonts' parameters and order.  The actual font files are not
saved to disk with the layout file.

When you load a layout file, you should have the necessary font files available
for Printrix to access.  It is more convenient, although not necessary, to have
all fonts together on one disk or one path.  If the fonts are in different
locations, switching between fonts by embedded command will cause Printrix to
pause typesetting and request you to input the location for the new font.

TEXT FORMAT PARAMETERS
----------------------
Form Size

This parameter defines the absolute horizontal and vertical dimensions (in
inches) of the form you're printing on.

The printing window, the space on which you may print, is a smaller rectangle
within the form size.  The printing window is defined by the margin settings.

Range:
------
Horizontal:  .01 to 14.00 inches
            (.01 to 8.50 for narrow cartridge printers)

Vertical:    .01 to 99.99 inches

NOTE:  On some laser printers, the vertical size of the printing window is
limited by the printer's graphic buffer.  See Appendix B for specific
information on your laser printer.

Location:
Print Document Menu (menu command only)

Top of Form
-----------
Printrix uses the vertical form size parameter to gauge the location of
top-of-form.  Therefore, if you're printing a multi-page document or multiple
copies, especially on small forms such as mailing labels, be sure your vertical
form size is accurate.  Measure from the top of one form to the top of the
next.  (For mailing labels, measure from the top of one label to the top of the
next, including the space between labels in the measurement.)

Margins
-------
A margin is a blank space at the top, bottom, left, or right of the form.
Margins are measured from the edge of the form inward, in hundredths of an
inch.  You may define each margin separately.

The inner rectangle formed by the four margins is the printing window, or space
on which you may typeset.  If you're printing on standard 8.5x11 inch paper, a
left margin of 1 inch and a right margin of 1.5 inches results in a line length
of 6 inches.  A top margin of 1.5 inches and a bottom margin of .75 inches
allows you to print on 8.75 vertical inches of paper.  The printing window,
then, is 6x8.75.

Range:
0.00* to max

max = form size minus opposite margin value

(In other words, the left and right margins together cannot exceed the
horizontal form size: the top and bottom margins together cannot exceed the
vertical form size.)

* EXCEPTION:

Some printers are not capable of printing all the way across a page.  If you
try to set the left or right margin to a value which exceeds your printer's
horizontal printing capacity, Printrix will automatically reset that margin to
your printer's best value.  If both right and left margins are out of bounds,
Printrix will adjust both margins to center the printing window on the page.

Location:
Print Document Menu
Embedded Command
     Left Margin         ^ML=n
     Right Margin        ^MR=n
     Top Margin          ^MT=n
     Bottom Margin       ^MB=n
n is a number within the accepted range

Timing:
Embedded commands to change margins take effect at different times, depending
on their positions.  A command to change the left or right margin will take
effect on the current line IF nothing has yet been printed on that line.  If
the command is found while Printrix is in the middle of a line, the margin
commands will take effect on the following line.

Embedded commands to change the top and bottom margins take effect on the
following page, no matter where they occur on the printed page.

Relative Values Apply:
When you change margins using the embedded commands, you may set the new values
either by absolute distance from the edges of the form, or by relative distance
from the previous margin values.

Absolute margin values are calculated in the same way that the menu command
margin values are.  Do not use a + or - symbol when using absolute margin
values.

Relative margin values are added to or subtracted from the previous value of
the margin.  Relative values are indicated by using a + or - in the command.
Relative values are convenient when you've forgotten the starting value of the
margin, or when you want to change starting values from the menu, but keep the
relationship between the margins the same.

Examples:
^ML=1^MR=1This paragraph will have left and right margins of one inch, for all
lines in the paragraph.

This paragraph ^ML=+5will have the preset margin values on the first line.  All
following lines will be indented .5 inches on the left, to produce a "hanging
paragraph."

prints as:

This paragraph will have the preset margin values on the first line All
     following lines will be indented .5 inches on the left, to produce a
     "hanging paragraph."

In Use:
When a paragraph is printed through Printrix, the arrangement of words on a
line depends on the current font and the current margins.  In most cases, the
arrangement will be different from the arrangement of that same paragraph in
your word processor.

When printing a graphic, the horizontal placement (left, right, or center) is
calculated from the current margins.  If the graphic is too large to fit within
the current margins, it will be cropped at the right and/or bottom edge to fit.
If a margin change command is found while Printrix is printing a graphic, the
new margin will take effect AFTER the graphic has finished printing.

TABSTOP SETTINGS/TAB CHARACTERS
-------------------------------
Tabs in Printrix are controlled by two parameters: tab characters and tabstop
settings.  Tabstop settings are positions on the printing line, set by either
menu or embedded command.  Tab characters are commands embedded in the text
file which cause Printrix to jump to the next tabstop and begin printing from
that position.

Tabstop Settings
----------------
You may set up to eight tabstops per line. Tabstops are measured from the
current left margin, in hundredths of an inch.  If the left margin changes, the
tabstops remain the same with respect to the left margin, and change with
respect to the left edge of the paper.

You may enter the tabstops in any order.  Printrix automatically rearranges
them in order of increasing distance from the left margin.

Range:
0.00 inches to max

max = length of printing line (horizontal form size minus the left and right
margins)

Location:
Print Document Menu
Embedded Command
     Tabstop Clear       ^TC
     Tabstop Set         ^TS=n
n is a number within the accepted range

Tab Characters
--------------
Tab characters are used to indent paragraphs or align text to a preset tabstop
position.  When Printrix reads a tab character in the text file, it jumps to
the next available tabstop position.

To enter a tab character in your text file, either press the tab key or type
^TAB.  Some word processors don't utilize standard tab characters, so these
require the ^TAB command.  See Chapter Five for information on your word
processor.

Relative Values Apply:
When using the embedded command to set tabstops, you may use either absolute or
relative measurements.

Absolute tabstop values are added to the left margin value in order to
determine their position on the page.  They do not contain + or - signs.

Relative tabstop values are added to or subtracted from the current position on
the printing line.  Relative value commands contain a + or - sign.

In Use:
In most practical settings, you'll avoid confusion by first clearing all old
tabstop settings before issuing new ones.  Use the ^TC for this purpose.  Then
use the ^TS command to set new positions, one position at a time.  You may
enter up to eight.  Printrix will ignore all tabstop settings to the right of
the eighth position.

Example:
^TC^TS=.5^TS-1.5^TABThis  ^TABparagraph will be indented .5 inches on its first
line.  The word "paragraph" will be positioned 1.5 inches from the left margin.

prints as:

     This           paragraph will be indented .5 inches on its first line.
The word "paragraph" will be positioned 1.5 inches from the left margin.

Oops!
-----
If your text file contains a tab character which falls to the right of the
rightmost tabstop on the line, Printrix is unable to position it correctly, and
will begin a new line instead.  If this occurs, either remove the tab character
from the text file, or set a new tabstop.

JUSTIFICATION
-------------
Justification is the horizontal arrangement of words on the printing line.
Printrix offers four justification styles:

Left:
lines of text have even left edges and ragged right edges.

Right:
lines of text have ragged left edges and even right edges.

Center:
lines of text are centered between the current left and right margins.

Fill:
lines of text have even left and right margins. Printrix uses
"microjustification," adding space between words and between letters as needed,
for the best visual effect.

Location:
Print Document Menu
Embedded Command
     Left      ^J=L
     Right     ^J=R
     Center    ^J=C
     Fill      ^J=F

Timing:
Embedded commands to change justification take effect on the current printing
line.  If the line contains more than one justification command, and there are
no tab characters in the line, the last justification command takes precedence.

Correct:       ^J=CThe Gettysburg Address
               ^J=FFourscore and seven years ago....

Incorrect:     ^J=CThe Gettysburg Address^J=F
               Fourscore and seven years ago....


ACTIVE FONT
-----------
Printrix keeps track of four fonts for use during a single typesetting line.
Of these four fonts, one is "active" at any given time.  The "active" font is
the font currently in use, either being acted upon through menus or being used
for typesetting.

Printrix uses the number keys to control the active font.  You may change
active fonts from the menu or from embedded command.

Range:    1-4

Location:
Print Document Menu
Font Library Menu
Embedded Command
     ^F=n
n is a number between 1 and 4

Timing:
An embedded command to change fonts takes effect immediately, even within a
word.  All text following the command will be typeset in the new font until
another font change command is found.  You may change fonts within your
document as often as you like.

All font enhancement commands apply only to the current active font.

In Use:
Printrix begins typesetting a document in the active font specified from menu.
This font will remain active until an embedded font change command is found.
If your document begins with or contains several blank lines, the vertical gap
on paper depends on the current active font.

LINEFEED ADVANCE
----------------
This parameter allows you to select single, double, or triple-spacing between
lines of text.

When lines are single-spaced, the distance from the baseline of one line to the
baseline of the next is equal to the vertical cell size of the largest font on
the line plus that font's linefeed gap.  Double-spacing and triple-spacing are
twice and three times that distance.

The linefeed advance command affects all fonts and all text in the document.

Range:         S, D, or T

Location:

Print Document Menu (menu command only)

Fine-Tuning
-----------
If you want more precise control over distance between lines than you can
achieve with Linefeed Advance, use the Linefeed Gap command.  This is a font
parameter, which can be changed for each individual font, and allows you to
specify distances measured in dots.

QUALITY OF PRINT
----------------
This command allows you to control the blackness of print.  Single-strike mode,
in which the printhead makes one pass over the line of print, is lightest.  The
maximum setting is 5, which causes the printhead to make five passes of the
line of print, striking every dot five times.

Range:         1 - 5

Location:
Text Format Menu
Embedded Command
     ^Q=n
n is a number within the accepted range

In Use:
Quality of print affects all print on a line, both text and graphics.

Since print quality operates on a printing line, it can change only between
lines.  When an embedded command to change print quality is found, the actual
change takes place on the current line, affecting even previous text on that
line.  You may want to place the print quality command only at the beginning of
a paragraph or on a line by itself.

PAGE NUMBERING; POSITION; START
-------------------------------
This group of commands controls the automatic printing of page numbers on each
page of your document.

The first command turns page numbers on or off.  The second command, Position,
selects top or bottom of the page.  The third command, Start, allows you to
begin numbering, with any positive integer.  All page numbers are printed in
the font loaded into Position 1.

Ranges:   Yes/No; Top/Bottom; 0 - 999

Location:
Print Document Menu
Embedded Command
     ^PG=Y or ^PG=N      (print page numbers)
     none                (top/bottom)
     ^PN=n               (start number)
n is a number within the accepted range

In Use:
Embedded commands to change the start number take effect on the next page
number.  If page numbers are set to print at the top of the page, any changes
will take place on the page following the command.  If the page numbers are set
to print at the bottom of the page, any changes will take place on the current
page.

NOTE:  Printrix cannot print page numbers past 999. The page following 999 will
be numbered 0.

NEW PAGE
--------
This command instructs Printrix to being a new page immediately.  Typesetting
breaks off at the point where the new page command is found, and resumes at the
top of the following page, in singe-column printing, or at the top of the next
column, in two-column printing.

Location:
Embedded Command Only
     New Page       ^NP

In Use:
If the new page command happens to coincide with the automatic page break at
the bottom margin, Printrix will skip a page before resuming printing. If this
occurs, remove the new page command or any adjacent carriage returns, or adjust
the bottom margin.

TWO COLUMN PRINTING
-------------------
This command allows you to print in newspaper-style columns.  Printrix prints
the first column, then uses the reverse linefeed capability of the printer to
return to the top of that page and print the second column.

Range:         Yes/No

Location:
Text Format Menu
Embedded Command
          ^C=Y or ^C=N

In Use:
Within the printing window defined by the margin settings, Printrix
automatically calculates column width and gutter space (the space left blank
between the columns).

When you are printing in two columns, the ^NP command immediately breaks the
current column and moves printing to the top of the next column, whether that
is on the same page or the following page.

If you use the embedded command to be in two-column printing (^C=Y), Printrix
stops the current printing line immediately, moves to the next line, and
resumes printing on that line, in two columns.  We suggest you insert this
command at the beginning or end of a paragraph or on a line by itself.

If you use the embedded command to end two-column printing (^C=N), Printrix
finishes the current page in two-column mode, then begins the next page without
columns.  You may want to use this command in conjunction with the ^NP command.

Check Your Printer
------------------
If you have one of these printers (Apple DMP, ImageWriter, ImageWriter II; C.
Itoh 8510, 8510 SCP; Fujitsu DL2400, DL2600; NEC 8023, 8025, CP-6, CP-7, P5,
P5XL, P6, P7; Texas Instruments 855, 857, 865; Toshiba 1340, 1351, P351,
P351C), Printrix automatically utilizes a reverse linefeed capacity to return
to the top of the page between columns.

If your printer was not listed above, you must return to the top of the page
manually.  To do this, set Wait at End of Page to Yes.  Then, when the printer
pauses, turn it off-line, roll the paper back, turn it on-line, and press the
spacebar to resume printing.

Wait at End of Page
-------------------
This command pauses Printrix between every page of typesetting, allowing you to
change paper stock, adjust the paper position, etc.  You may not change the
Printrix settings or the text file during these pauses.

Range:         Yes/No

Location:
Print Document Menu (menu command only)

Special Use :  Two-Column Printing
----------------------------------
This command may be used to allow two-column printing on printers which don't
have reverse linefeed capabilities.  Set Wait to Yes and Two-Column Printing to
Yes.  When the printer pauses at the bottom of the first column, manually roll
the paper back to the top of that page, and press the space bar to resume
printing.

NUMBER OF COPIES
----------------
This command allows you to print multiple copies of a document.

Range:         1 - 999

Location:
Print Document Menu (menu command only)

PRINT LITERAL CHARACTER
-----------------------
This command is used to print a Printrix embedded command as part of your
document.  Use it to tell the program to print, rather than interpret, a
command.

Range:         one character, the carat (^)

Location:
Embedded Command Only
          ^L=^

Examples:
The text string ^L=^ML=2 will be typeset as ^ML=2.

The text string ^ML2 will result in setting the left margin to a value of 2.

In Use:
The ^L= command is needed only when you want to print a Printrix command.  In
all other uses of the carat, when the following characters do not match a
Printrix command, they will be printed automatically.  This command does not
allow you to pass an escape sequence to the printer.

UNDERLINING
-----------
Two embedded commands work together to produce underlining in your documents.
The first turns underlining on, the second turns underlining off.  All text,
numerals, punctuation, spaces, and tabs between the commands will be
underlined.

Location:
Embedded Command Only
     Start Underline     ^US
     End Underline       ^UE

Timing:
The underline commands take effect immediately, even between the characters of
a word.

Special Uses: Tabs
Tab commands and underlining work well together to draw horizontal lines.  This
feature is useful in creating forms, designing tables, etc.

Examples:
^TC^TS=1.2^TS=3.5NAME^TAB^US^TAB^UE
ADDRESS^TAB^US^TAB^UE
^TAB^US^TAB^UE
^TAB^US^TAB^UE
TELEPHONE^TAB^US^TAB^UE

will print as:

NAME       ______________________________________________________
ADDRESS    ______________________________________________________
           ______________________________________________________
           ______________________________________________________
TELEPHONE   ______________________________________________________


^TC^TS=3
Chapter One ^US^TAB^UE 3
Chapter Two ^US^TAB^UE 8
Chapter Three ^US^TAB^UE 21
Chapter Four ^US^TAB^UE 35

will print as:

Chapter One ____________________________________________________ 3
Chapter Two ____________________________________________________ 8
Chapter Three __________________________________________________ 21
Chapter Four ___________________________________________________ 35


                            FONT LIBRARY PARAMETERS

Select Active Font
------------------
Use the number keys, 1 through 4, to select an active font from the group of
fonts in the current layout file.  Here, the active font is the font or font
location which you wish to operate on.

On the screen, an asterisk denotes the currently selected active font.

Range:    1-4

Location:
Font Library Menu (menu command only)


Load Font from Disk
-------------------
This command lets you load a font from disk into the currently specified active
font location (indicated on screen by an asterisk).

Location:
Font Library Menu (menu command only)


Procedure:
1. Select the active font location by pressing a number key.

(Note:  There may already be a font associated with that location.  You may
load a font anyway; Printrix will first delete the current resident, then load
the new font.)

2. Press L.

3.  Enter the prefix and filename which locate and identify the font you want
to load.  Press RETURN.  Printrix looks at the specified area.  If it finds a
file of the specified name, it will display the file and ask for confirmation.

(Note:  If you press RETURN without entering a prefix or filename, Printrix
will search the default area for any file with a SET.filename form.  You may
accept any of the fonts it finds there.)

If you answer Y, that font is loaded.  If you answer N, Printrix continue to
search the area.  If Printrix cannot find a font with the specified name, the
screen will display a message and wait for further instructions.

Delete Font from Memory
-----------------------
This Font Library option deletes the active font from the current layout file.
Use it to make room for loading other fonts.  Delete Active Font does not
disturb any font files on disk, or change the layout file on disk unless you
resave it without the deleted font.

Location:
Font Library Menu (menu command only)

Procedure:
1. Select the active font location by pressing a number key.

2. Press D.

Reload Font Library
-------------------
This option lets you load an entire new library of fonts in one fell swoop.
Printrix will load into the current layout file the first four fonts it finds
in a specified prefix, until it runs out of memory space.  The fonts are
loaded in the order they are found on disk, with the font parameters which are
saved with the font.  The layout file's font specifications are overwritten.
However, this font information will not be saved with the layout file for reuse
UNLESS you perform the Save Layout File operation.

Location:
Font Library Menu (menu command only)

Procedure:
1. Press R.

2. Enter the prefix where the desired fonts are located, and press RETURN.

The screen will display the font loading process.

Font Sub-Directories
--------------------
If you have a certain group of fonts that you generally use for one
application, and another group that gets used for a different application,
etc., you may find it convenient to keep the fonts on separate disks or on
separate paths.  You can then use the Reload command to load an entire group of
fonts quickly.

Change Font Parameters:
This command causes Printrix to display a new menu, from which you may change
the printing parameters of the active font.

Location:
Font Library Menu (menu command only)

Embedded Commands Override
--------------------------
Each of the nine font parameters has a corresponding embedded command which may
be inserted in your text file.  The menu parameters define the starting form of
the font; embedded commands change the font for special purposes within the
text file.  Within one printing job, the embedded commands control the font
appearance.  After the document has finished printing, the fonts are reset to
their original parameters for new print jobs.

Font Name and Cell Size
-----------------------
These two parameters may not be altered, either from the menu or from text
file.  They are displayed on the Change Font Parameters menu for information
purposes.

The font name identifies the current font.  It is the filename with which the
font was saved to disk in Fontrix.  To change a font name, load the font in the
Fontrix Font Editor, change its name, and resave it.  The ProDOS renaming
function is not effective.

Cell size refers to the font character frames - imaginary rectangles which
contain the characters.  The cell size is the same for all characters of the
font, even though the characters within each cell may be of different heights
and widths.  The cell dimensions are measured in dots.

Proportional Spacing
--------------------
This parameter allows you to select proportional or nonproportional character
spacing for the active font.  If a font is printed in its nonproportional form,
each character gets a preset amount of horizontal space, independent of the
width of the character.  If a font is printed in its proportional form, each
character receives a horizontal space determined by its width.  The excess
space is shaved off the right edge of the character cell.

Range:    Yes/No

Location:
Change Font Parameters Menu
Embedded Command
     ^FP=Y or ^FP=N

In Use:
For most printing, proportional spacing is preferable because it produces text
that is evenly spaced to the eye, while nonproportional spacing can leave
distracting gaps between characters.

For some applications, however, nonproportional spacing is required.  For
example, you may wish to print columns of numbers which are vertically aligned.
If this is the case, you will need to set the Spacebar Width equal to the
horizontal cell size of the font you are using, and give the font a negative
Character Spacing Gap, so that the character cells overlap when printed.  Some
experimentation may be required to find the best setting for your font; start
with a negative value that is one-third the horizontal cell size. Character
Spacing Gap and Spacebar Width are other font parameters, covered later in this
chapter.  For a more extensive explanation of nonproportional printing, with
examples, see Lesson Two.

Character Spacing Gap
---------------------
This parameter determines the amount of space Printrix issues between
characters in a font.  Spacing gap is measured in dots (pixels).  This space is
inserted between the character cells, whether the font is set for proportional
or nonproportional printing.

Range:         -99 to 99

NOTE:  In this case, the - symbol means a negative value.  It does NOT mean
that the new character spacing gap is relative to the previous value.  Do NOT
use a + symbol for positive values of the character spacing gap.

Location:
Change Font Parameters Menu
Embedded Command
     ^FS=n
n is a value within the accepted range

Special Uses: Kerning, Nonproportional Printing

The ability to set the spacing gap to a negative value is useful for
nonproportional printing, as explained in that section, and in Lesson Two.

The ability to change the spacing gap in either direction allows you to
fine-tune your printing.  This is especially important with large fonts, and in
headlines or captions.  The most frequent application is kerning.

Kerning refers to adjusting the spacing gap between particular pairs of letters
to keep the overall appearance of the text even.

In the following example, the kerned text was created by adjusting the
character spacing gap between the letters T/o, F/a, V/A, T/A, A/G, L/Y, and
Y/C.  After each adjustment, the character spacing gap must be reset to its
original value for the other letters in the word.

Example:
Unkerned:      Town,  Fame,  ADVANTAGE,  LYCEUM
Kerned         Town, Fame, ADVANTAGE, LYCEUM

(You'll have to try this to get the full effect.  AppleWorks isn't that
flexible!)

Text file:      T^FS=-2o^FS=1w^FS=4n
F^FS=-1a^FS=4me
AD^FS=1^FS=4A^FS=4NT^FS=-2A^FS=-1G^FS=rE
L^FS=-4^FS=-1C^FS=4EUM

Linefeed Gap
------------
This parameter is used to set the amount of space between lines.  It is
measured in dots (pixels).  When there is more than one font on a line, the
linefeed gap of the largest font is used for the entire line.

Range:         0-99
Location:
Change Font Parameters Menu
Embedded Command
     ^FL=n
n is a value within the accepted range

Relative Values Apply
---------------------
You may define the embedded command for linefeed gap in either absolute or
relative values.  Absolute values are entered WITHOUT + or - symbols, and they
determine the number of dots between the bottom of one line and the top of the
next.

Relative values are entered WITH a + or - symbol.  The value is then added to
or subtracted from the previous linefeed gap value.

In Use:
The linefeed gap parameter may be used for fine-tuning the space between lines,
or "leading."  However, the command applies only to one font at a time (the
active font), so be sure to change the linefeed gap values for as many fonts as
needed for your format requirements.

If you want to double- or triple-space an entire document, you may either
change the linefeed gaps of all fonts, or use the Linefeed Advance parameter
(discussed earlier in this chapter). However, if you want to use a combination
of single-, double- and/or triple-spacing, use the linefeed gap commands.

Spacebar Width
--------------
This parameter defines the amount of space left blank between words.  It is
measured in dots.

Range:         0-99

Location:
Change Font Parameters Menu
Embedded Command
     ^FW=n
n is a value within the accepted range

Relative Values Apply
---------------------
When using the embedded form of the spacebar width command, you may define the
width in either absolute or relative values.  Absolute values are entered
WITHOUT = or -symbols, and determine the number of dots between the last
character of the previous word and the first character of the following word.

Relative values are entered WITH a + or - symbol.  The value is then added to
or subtracted from the previous spacebar width value.

In Use:  Tables/Vertical Alignment
----------------------------------
When printing columns of numbers or characters, the font in use must be set for
nonproportional spacing, a negative character spacing gap, and a spacebar width
equal to the horizontal cell size.  For a more complete discussion, see Lesson
Two.

Baseline
--------
The baseline is an imaginary horizontal line which positions the font upon the
page.  Letters such as "x," "a," and "L" rest directly upon the baseline.
Letters such as "g" and "y" rest their bodies upon the baseline, while their
descenders rest below it.  When you change fonts, each font is aligned on the
same baseline for continuity across the page (the common baseline).

Changing a font's baseline value will move the font vertically with respect to
the common baseline.  If you increase a font's baseline value, characters will
be printed above the common baseline.  If you decrease the font's baseline
value, it will be printed below the common baseline.

The baseline value is measured in dots.  The top row of dots in a character
cell is zero, and the bottom row is the vertical cell size of that font.

Range:         0-99

Location:
Change Font Parameters Menu
Embedded Command
     ^FB=n
n is a value within the accepted range

Relative Values Apply

When using the embedded form of the baseline command, you may enter the
baseline in either absolute or relative values.  Absolute values are entered
WITHOUT + or - symbols.  An absolute value counts dots down from the top of the
character cell to position the baseline.

Relative baseline values are entered WITH a = or - symbol.  The value is added
to or subtracted from the previous value.

Special Uses: Superscript/Subscript

You may use the baseline parameter to cause characters to float above or hang
below the common baseline or a line of text for performing special effects, or
tasks like super- or subscripting.  You may also want to change to a smaller
font at the same time.

Examples:
E = MC^FB=(+10)2

prints as:

E = MC2

If your baseline command moves a font up or down more than half of the current
linefeed gap, Printrix will increase the space between the lines to accommodate
the repositioning.

Italics
-------
This parameter allows you to italicize (slant to the right) the active font.

Range:         Yes/No

Location:
Change Font Parameters Menu
Embedded Command
     ^FI=Y or ^FI=N

Horizontal Boldface
-------------------
This parameter allows you to increase the weight of vertical lines in the
active font.

Range:         0 - 4

Location:
Change Font Parameters Menu
Embedded Command
     ^FH=n
n is a value within the accepted range

Relative Values Apply

When you use the embedded form of the boldface command, you may enter either an
absolute or a relative value.

Absolute values determine the amount of weight added to the font.  They are
entered WITHOUT a + or - symbol.

Relative values are added to or subtracted from the previous boldface value.
They are entered WITH a + or - symbol.

Font Magnification
------------------
The horizontal and vertical magnification parameters may be used together or
separately to increase the printed size of a font.  The horizontal
magnification factor increases a font's width: the vertical magnification
factor increases its height.  You may double, triple, quadruple, etc., a font;
you may not decrease it or enlarge it by a noninteger factor such as 1.5 or
2.75.

Range:         1 - 99

Location:
Change Font Parameters Menu
Embedded Command
     ^FX=x     (horizontal magnification factor)
     ^FY=y     (vertical magnification factor)
x and y are values within the accepted range

Relative Values Apply

You may use either absolute or relative values with the embedded form of the
magnification command.  Absolute values are entered WITHOUT + or - symbols, and
determine the size of the font directly.

Relative values are entered WITH a + or - sign, and are added to or subtracted
from the previous magnification value.  In other words, if a font's current
horizontal magnification value is 2, and your text file contains the command
^FX=+2, the result will be a font printing at four times the original width.

In Use:
With magnification factors of 1, Printrix prints one dot at the printer for
each dot in the original font.  With a magnification factor of 2, Printrix
prints two dots at the printer for each dot in the original font.  If you use
large magnification values, the resolution (its smoothness) of the font when
printed will decrease.

You may use magnification to produce the extended and compressed versions of
existing fonts.  You may also use magnification to compensate for non-square
aspect ratios of printers. (See Chapter Three for a discussion of aspect ratio
in relation to graphics printing.)

Font Color
----------
This parameter allows you to change the printing color of a font, if you have a
color printer.  There are fifteen color options, each designated by a number.

1 - Black                      9 - Yellow-Black
2 - Blue                      10 - Green
3 - Blue-Black                11 - Green-Black
4 - Red                       12 - Orange
5 - Red-Black                 13 - Orange-Black
6 - Purple                    14 - Brown
7 - Purple-Black              15 - Brown-Black
8 - Yellow

Range:         1 - 15

Location:

Embedded Command
     ^FC=n
n is a number within the accepted range

In Use:
The command to change font color affects only the current active font.  If you
change fonts, the new font will print in its current color setting, whatever
that may be.  If you haven't set the font's color yet, the default color is
black.

The command takes effect immediately, even within a word.


GRAPHICS PARAMETERS
-------------------
Three commands exist to print a graphic form from your text file.  The first is
used to call a standard single hi-res screen, created by many programs
including Fontrix.  The second is used to call a Fontrix Graffile, which is an
extended-screen graphic created only by Fontrix.  The third is used to call a
Print Shop-compatible ART.graphic.

A graphic must be called from the text file, with the embedded command
corresponding to the graphic type.  The embedded command contains the filename,
the desired graphic, and may or may not also contain location information.  The
position, magnification, etc., of the graphic is controlled by a combination of
embedded commands and menu commands.

Print a single hi-res screen:  ^GPS="/prefix/filename"

Print a Fontrix Graffile:   ^GPG="/prefix/filename"

Print an ART.graphic:   ^GPA="/prefix/filename"

The filename and any location information MUST be enclosed in quotes.

If the location information is omitted, Printrix will search the default path
(the last graphic accessed) for the graphic.  If it finds a file with the
appropriate filename, that file will be printed.  If no such file is found,
Printrix will display a "File Not Found" message on screen, and offer you the
opportunity to enter a new prefix.

If the location information is incorrect, Printrix will first search the
specified area, then display the "File Not Found" message and allow you to
enter a new location.

Examples:
The following embedded command would print a single hi-res screen named
pic.halleys which is currently on disk.

^GPS="/diskname/pic.halleys"

The following embedded command would print a Graffile named gfl.skyscape, which
is stored in a subdirectory named Graffile.

^GPG="/diskname/graffile/glf.skyscape"

The following embedded command would print a clip-art graphic called art.santa.
Since no location is given, Printrix will first search its default directory,
then ask you for directions.


^GPA="art.santa"

Timing:
A graphic called by these commands will begin printing on the line immediately
following the current printing line, IF there is room remaining on the page.
If the graphic call is encountered near the bottom of the page with
insufficient space remaining before the bottom margin, Printrix will hold the
graphic until the next page.

If you call a graphic while another graphic is printing (if the second call
comes too soon in the text file), the second command will be ignored.

Watch Your Margins
------------------
If you try to print a graphic that is larger than the printing window (the
rectangle defined by the four margins), Printrix will automatically move the
graphic to the left margin, then crop it on the right and/or bottom edges to
fit the available space.  To prevent this, reset your margins to accommodate
the graphic size BEFORE calling the graphic.  If you call a graphic before
inserting the margin change command, the new margin values will be put on hold
until the graphic has finished printing.


GRAPHIC MAGNIFICATION
---------------------
Two commands control graphic magnification - one for the horizontal dimension
and one for the vertical dimension.  You may set them to the same or different
values, as you choose.

To print a graphic in its original size, use the default magnification values
of 1 and 1.  To double its size, set both dimensions to 2.  Only integer values
may be used (in other words, Printrix will not accept a magnification value of
1.5).

A graphic magnification setting will apply to all graphics in the text file,
unless changed by a subsequent embedded command.

Remember that the size of the graphic when printed depends not only on the
original size of the graphic but also on the resolution of your printer.

Range:         1 - 99

Location:
Graphic Format Menu
Embedded Command
          ^GX=x (horizontal magnification factor)
          ^GY=y (vertical magnification factor)
x and y are values within the accepted range

Note: As you move from magnification factors of 1x1 to factors of 2x2, you are
essentially causing the printer to print a 2x2 block of dots for every dot in
the original graphic.  This increases the size of the print-out, and also
decreases the apparent resolution of the graphic - diagonal lines and curves
will exhibit the "stairstep" or "jaggy" effect.  Therefore, magnify only when
necessary.

Special Uses: Correcting for Non-Square Aspect Ratios

Many printers have different print densities for the horizontal and vertical
dimensions.  (The relationship of horizontal to vertical resolution is called
aspect ratio.)  When printing graphics, this results in distortion of the
graphic - stretching in one direction or the other.  Circles on screen are
printed as ellipses, etc.  You may use the magnification commands to correct
for non-square aspect ratios by setting the horizontal and vertical dimension
accordingly.

For example, many Epson printers have a horizontal resolution of 120 dpi (dots
per inch) and a vertical resolution of 75 dpi.  Unmagnified, a graphic will
print tall and thin.  To correct, set the horizontal magnification factor to 3
and the vertical to 2.  This results in a horizontal resolution of 40 dpi and a
vertical resolution of 37 dpi, accurate enough for most purposes.  Of course,
the graphic now has increased in size and decreased in resolution, so weigh all
these factors against each other and design the page or the graphic
accordingly.

Negative Image
--------------
This parameter allows you to print a graphic as a negative image of itself.
Like a photographic negative, dark and light areas of the picture are reversed.
If the graphic is in color, pairs of colors will be reversed.

Range:         Yes/No

Location:
Graphic Format Menu
Embedded Command
          ^GN=Y or ^GN=N

Caution:  If you have a dot matrix printer, be careful about printing large
areas in solid black - you may overload the printhead element and shorten the
life of your printer.  If you have an inkjet or laser printer, don't worry.

Horizontal Placement
--------------------
This parameter allows you to position a graphic against the left margin,
against the right margin, or centered between the margins.

Range:         L, R, or C

Location:

Graphic Format Menu
Embedded Command
          ^GH=L, ^GH=R, or ^GH=C

Relationship to Text
--------------------
The relationship of text to graphics is controlled by two parameters,
Horizontal Placement and Fit Text to Graphic, described later in this section.
If a graphic is positioned left or right, you may command the text to "Flow"
around the graphic - "graphic run-around."  Lines of text are full length above
and below the graphic, and are shortened beside the graphic to fill the space
between the graphic and the opposite margin.  If a graphic is centered, no
run-around is possible, and text will break above and below the graphic.

Graphic Color Printing
----------------------
This parameter allows you to enable or suppress color printing of graphics.

Range:         Yes/No

Location:
Graphic Format Menu
Embedded Command
          ^GC=Y or ^GC=N

Fit Text to Graphic
-------------------
This parameter allows you to select between three arrangements of text around
an inserted graphic: Break, Flow, and Overlay.

Break: holds text typesetting while the graphic is being printed.  When the
graphic has finished, typesetting resumes.

Flow: performs a "graphic run-around" in which any remaining space to the side
of the graphic is filled with short lines of text.  Flow is operative ONLY when
the graphic is positioned left or right.  If the graphic is centered, you must
choose either Break or Overlay.  If you forget and set the parameter to Flow,
Printrix will ignore the command and execute a Break.  (Left, right, and center
are controlled by the Horizontal Placement parameter, discussed earlier in this
section.)

Overlay: allows you to print text directly on a graphic.


Separate from Text
------------------
This parameter controls the amount of space left blank between a graphic and
the surrounding text.  Included are the areas above, below, and to either side
of the graphic.  These areas are sometimes called "gutter space."

Range:         0.00 to max

max = length of printing line, or distance between the left and right text
margins

APPENDIX A:  FILE CONVERSION
----------------------------
All files used by Printrix must be in ProDOS format.  This includes text files,
fonts, and graphics.  Your text files and graphics may already be in ProDOS
format.  However, if you want to use Fontrix Graffiles, fonts from the
Fontpaks, or any DOS 3.3 text files and graphics, you must convert those
graphics according to the following procedure.

ProDOS Conversion: Text files and Single-Screen Graphics

Apple provides two utilities to perform the DOS 3.3-ProDOS conversion.  They
are located on the ProDOS System Utilities Disks.  CONVERT comes with the older
Apple II computers.  CHANGE DISK'S FORMAT comes with the Apple //c and newer
Apple II computers.

To use either program, follow the procedures described in your Apple manual.

ProDOS Conversion: Graffiles

Fontrix Graffiles require special conversion procedures.  A conversion utility
is proved for you on the /CONFIGURE disk.

To convert a Fontrix Graffile to ProDOS format, set the prefix to /CONFIGURE
and insert the /CONFIGURE disk (or, if you're running from hard disk, set the
prefix to the appropriate subdirectory).  Then input -PX.CONVERT.  A menu
appears, from which you may specify the source disk and file, catalog the
contents of a disk, and begin the conversion.  An on-screen counter keeps track
of the conversion process.

ProDOS Conversion: Fonts
------------------------
All Printrix fonts were created by Printrix's sister program, Fontrix, in DOS
3.3 format.  The fonts contained on the Printrix disks /FONTS1 and /FONTS2 have
already been converted for use with Printrix.

However, if you own Fontpaks, which were created using Fontrix, or if you have
created Fontrix fonts for your own use, these fonts must be converted before
you may use them with Printrix.

The font conversion is a two-step process.  First, the file structure must be
changed to ProDOS.  Second, three font parameters must be added to the font
file.

To convert the file format to ProDOS, follow the procedure described earlier
for conversion of text files and single-screen graphics.

Then, set the prefix to /CONFIGURE disk and insert the /CONFIGURE disk (or, if
you're running from hard disk, set the prefix to the appropriate subdirectory).
Type -FONT.SETUP.  Enter the prefix and filename of the font you're converting.
Printrix now goes to a look-up table to read the font size.  From this it
calculates the three parameters of spacebar width, character spacing gap, and
baseline.  The results are displayed on screen.  You may change any of these
values, or accept Printrix's suggestions.  Press RETURN to save the font with
the new parameters.

Feel free to experiment with these settings.  You may find it convenient to set
up particular fonts to use in super/subscripting (change the baseline value),
or nonproportional printing (change the spacebar width and character spacing
gap).



                             APPENDIX B:  Printers

If you read Chapter 3, you know that Printrix prints in graphics mode, which
makes the size and proportion of the print dependent on the printer's graphics
resolution and aspect ratio.

Consult the technical manual for your printer to determine the dip switch
settings and resolution (dots per inch) of your printer.



                               APPENDIX C: FONTS

Printrix comes with 43 fonts, which are contained on the Printrix disks, for
your use.  They are ready to be loaded and used.  Additional fonts are
available on Fontpaks.



                           APPENDIX D: ART.GRAPHICS

A number of four-sector graphics are contained on the Printrix Configuration
Disk.  They may be used with the Printrix ^GPA command.
