                        SELECTING A RANK

  Once you have left the demo, your first pre-flight task will be
to select a Naval rank. There are seven ranks under which you can
fly, each one providing a more challenging set of missions than
the last. Use the arrow keys or your joystick to cycle through
the various ranks. When your desired rank is highlighted, press
the return key or a joystick button to make your selection. After
you've selected your rank, a message will appear on screen
listing your objectives for that mission.


                        SELECTING WEAPONS

  Before taking off, you must decide what type of weapons your
Hellcat will be armed with for this flight. Cycle through the
list of weapons using the arroW keys or your joystick, then press
return or joystick button to make your selection.


                           TAKING OFF

  To take off from the carrier, push the joystick all the way to
the left to give your Hellcat full throttle in that direction. As
the plane nears the end of the flight deck, push the stick up and
to the left to provide elevation.


                             FLYING

  Maneuvering the Hellcat while in flight is achieved using the
following joystick positions:


                 Left Climb   Stall    Right Climb
                         \      |     /
      Full Throttle Left--3/4 Throttle-- Full Throttle Right
                         /      |     \
                Left Dive  Stall Dive  Right Dive





                             TURNING

  Turning is accomplished by reversing the horizontal direction
of the stick. Your Hellcat will lose some altitude while turning,
 so it's important to give it extra lift at the same time.


                             LANDING

  To land on the carrier, you must approach it flying into the
wind (from the right). Use the 3-D view to line up the flashing
white artificial horizon indicator with the deck of the carrier.
Just as you clear the edge of the carrier's deck, stall the plane
to allow it to drop so that its "arrester hook" can catch one of
the four arresting cables on the deck.

  Landing an airplane on the deck of a carrier requires a great
deal of skill and nerves of steel. It may take you a few practice
runs before you feel comfortable, but this practice will pay off
later When the heat is on and you have to land under fire.

  Once you have landed safely, taxi your plane to the elevator.
Then, push the joystick button to activate the elevator and lower
your plane for repairs, refueling and a new load of weapons. If
you taxi too far and miss the elevator, simply turn your plane
around and position it over the elevator again.


                         HELLCAT WEAPONS
                         ---------------

                          Machine Guns

  Your Hellcat is equipped With three .50 caliber machine guns on
each wing. These guns can be fired while in flight by pressing
button 0. Use your machine guns for shooting down enemy planes
and strafing islands.


                              Bombs

  Equipped with thirty 100 lb. bombs, your Hellcat can do heavy
damage to barracks and maching gun dug-outs on enemy islands.
After selecting "bombs" from the Weapons menu, you can drop bombs
while in flight by pressing button 1.


                             Rockets

  Designed for use on more substantial targets such as large
anti-aircraft guns, 15 of these 5 inch rockets can be carried by
your Hellcat. Once you've selected "rockets" from the Weapons
menu, you can fire rockets while in flight by pressing button 1.


                            TORPEDOES

  Once an enemy ship's guns have been disabled you'll be able to
make a torpedo run on the ship in an attempt to sink it. After
selecting "torpedo" from the weapons menu, you can release the
torpedo by pressing button 1

NOTE: you must approach the enemy ship flying low over the water
when you release the torpedo. It is important to have the ship
well in your sight before releasing the torpedo so as not to
allow the torpedo to run out of energy before hitting its target.



                          CONTROL PANEL

  Your Hellcat's control panel with it's various instruments and
guages is displayed at the bottom of your screen.



Weapon counter: indicates what type of weapon you are carrying
and how many you have left.

Hellcat counter: how many Hellcats left. You earn an extra plane
eace time you are promoted in rank.

Oil pressure guage: indicates the condition of your engine. When
your Hellcat is damaged by gunfire, the engine will begin to
smoke. The more damage your plane sustains, the more smoke it
will emit and the lower the oil pressure will drop. When oil
pressure begins to get critically low, a red light will blink on
the guage. If the oil pressure drops too low, the engine will
seize and you will crash, Each time you return to your carrier
and descend into the hold, your plane will be repaired, restoring
oil pressure to full.

3-D view: provides a three dimensional view of the world from
your cockpit. This view is especially helpful when attempting to
guage the distange between your Hellcat and an oncoming ship,
plane of other target.

In the center of the view is a flashing white cursor which serves
as an artificial forizon iundicator. This indicator is useful for
sighting targets and landing on your carrier.


Fuel guage: indicates how much fuel you have left. When the fuel
level begins to get critically low, a red light will blink on the
guage. If the plane runs out of fuel in flight, you will crash.
Each time you return to your carrier and descend into the hold,
your plane will be refueled, restoring the level to full.


Score counter: take a guess!

Enemy plane counter: take another one!



                       FLYING THE MISSIONS


  You start the game with three Hellcats. You will receive one
additional Hellcat every time you earn a promotion in rank.


                       Mission Objectives

 You will be briefed on each mission's objective before you begin
it. Bonuses will be awarded as each objective is accomplished. An
additional bonus will be awarded upon successful completion of an
entire mission.

  The two major objectives that a mission may entail are:

ISLANDS

 Targets on islands include barracks, soldiers, machine gun
dug-outs and large anti-aircraft guns. For an island to be
neutralized, all barracks, soldiers and guns must be destroyed.

SHIPS

 Enemy ships must be sunk to be neutralized.


During some missions, you will also encounter the following:

FIGHTER PLANES

It is not neccessary to shoot down all fighter planes in an area
in order to complete a mission.


TORPEDO PLANES

 To defend your carrier, it is neccessary to either shoot down
torpedo planes or destroy their torpedoes once dropped (with
bullets bombs or rockets). When a torpedo plane is sighted, an
arrow will appear in the 3-D view indicating its position
relative to you.


HIGH SCORES

 Once you have finished the game, you will have the opportunity
to save your score to disk if your score is among the top ten.
You will be prompted to enter your name. Your rank will be
recorded automatically.
