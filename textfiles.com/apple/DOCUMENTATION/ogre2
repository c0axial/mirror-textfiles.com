OGRE:  There  are  two  types of Ogres, the Mark III and the Mark V. The
Ogre is a cybertank, approximately 30 meters in  length,  equipped  with
guns,  missiles,  antipersonnel weapons, and 3 meters of biphase carbide
armor. 

An undamaged Ogre can travel at about 45 kph,  i.e.,  3  map  hexes  per
turn.  The  Ogre's goal is to destroy the Command Post and, if possible,
the entire defensive armor battalion. The  Mark  V  is  a  larger,  more
formidable version of the Mark III.

COMMAND POST: Att.S.- 0 Att.R.- 0 Def.S - 0 Movement - 0
This  is  the  defender's  strategic  communications center. The Command
Post, once positioned, cannot be moved. The Command Post is incapable of
attacking the Ogre, or of defending itself.  An attack from any  of  the
Ogre's  weapons  automatically  destroys Command Post. At times the Ogre
will, with seeming cruelty, elect to destroy a Command Post, not quickly
and mercifully with one of its nuclear weapons, but instead by  crushing
it and its inhabitants beneath the cybertank's massive treads. 

Armor  Units  - There are four types of defensive armor units: the Heavy
Tank, the Missile Tank, The Howitzer,  and  the  Ground  Effect  Vehicle
(GEV). 

HEAVY TANK: Att.S. - 4 Att.R. - 2 Def.S. - 3 Movement - 3
This  is the defender's main battle tank. A heavy tank is big, powerful,
and heavily armored. its speed is such that it can keep  pace  with  the
Ogre, except when maneuvering around rubble.  Unfortunatly, a heavy tank
must  get  within  3 km. (2 hexes) of the Ogre in order to fire upon it.
This leave the heavy  tank  vulnerable  to  almost  all  of  the  Ogre's
weapons,  including  the  possiblity of being crushed beneath the Ogre's
treads. 


MISSILE TANK: Att.S. - 3 Att.R. - 4 Def.S. - 2 Movement - 2
A missile tank is smaller and less heavily armored than  a  heavy  tank.
The  broad,  sturdy  surface from which the missile tank commander fires
long-range missiles sits atop a set of wide crawler treads that move the
missile tank slowly across the battlefield. The missile tank cannot keep
pace with the  Ogre,  thus  requiring  the  missile  tank  commander  to
continually  anticipate  the  Ogre's movement in order to keep it within
range of his missiles. The missile tank's saving grace is  that  it  can
fire  upon  the Ogre from 6 km. (4 hexes) away, allowing it to pound the
Ogre while staying out of range of most of the Ogre's weapons. 

HOWITZER: Att.S. - 6 Att.R. - 8 Def.S. - 1 Movement - 0
The howitzer is the defender's hardest hitting and longest range weapon.
A howitzer can reach an Ogre up to 12 km (8 hexes) away.  This allows  a
howitzer  to  get 2 to 3 shots at an Ogre before the Ogre can get within
striking distance. Howitzers are permanently installed and cost twice as
much as any other armor unit. The fact that a howitzer annot move is its
greatest weakness. In addition, it is all but defenseless. The defenders
must try to buy a howitzer time with the mobile armor units so that  the
howitzer may wreak considerable damage upon the Ogre. 

GROUND EFFECT VEHICLE (GEV): Att.S. - 2 Att.R. - 2 Def.S. - 2 Move - 4,3
Propelled  by  air-cushion suspension, the GEV is the defender's fastest
moving vehicle. It can move more than twice as fast as  any  other  unit
including  the  Ogre.  GEVs move once in the defender's regular movement
phase - and again after firing in the GEV movement phase.  The  seasoned
GEV  commander  will  swoop in close enough to fire at the Ogre and then
dart away just beyond the reach of the Ogre's weapons. 

INFANTRY: Att.S. - 1,2, or 3 Att.R. - 1 Def.S.- 1,2, or 3 Movement - 2
Infantry travel in groups of one, two, or three squads (6 - 8 men  to  a
squad).  Infantry  are armed with conventional and anti-tank weapons and
used powered "battlesuits" to greatly increase their mobility  (allowing
them  to  cross  rubble  that  stops other armor units) and provide some
protection from radiation and shrapnel.  Infantry cannot move as fast as
a fully funcional Ogre, and a squad leader will, if  not  careful,  find
his squad falling behind the Ogre, unable to reach it before the Command
Post  is destroyed.  Infantry must get within 1500 meters (1 hex) of the
Ogre in order to fire at it. This makes them extremely vulnerable to the
Ogre's antipersonnel weapons, as well as to being overrun by  the  Ogre.
Many  infantrymen  swear  the  supposedly emotionless Ogre derives great
pleasure from the feel of battlesuits being crushed beneath its treads. 


DEPLOYMENT: 

The defending player must  deploy  forces  in  anticipation  of  attack.
Battlefield alterations and force deployment are controlled in the field
editor.  A  detailed  discussion of the Field Editor can be found in the
"Field Editor"  section.   To  quickly  get  started  playing  Ogre  (oh
boy!!!), use one of the predesigned fields or battles. 

Loading/Saving  Fields: There are five predesigned fields from which the
player may choose. In addition to the five predesigned fields the player
may save five fields of original design. To load a field, select "Load a
Field" from the Menu. A dialogue box will appear from which one  of  the
original  or  preset  fields  can  be selected for loading. Click on the
field of choice and then click "ok". The selected field will  be  loaded
in and displayed. 

Loading/Saving Games: A previously saved game can be loaded at any time.
If a battle is in progress when another game is loaded, the current game
will  be  lost  unless it is saved first. To load a game, select "Load a
Game" from the Menu. A dialogue box will appear from which one  of  five
saved  games  can  be  selected.  Select the desired game and then click
"ok". The selected game will be loaded in and the  battle  will  proceed
from  where it was saved. The current status of a battle can be save for
continued play later. to save the battle status, select  "Save  a  Game"
from  the Menu. A dialogue box will appear, from which one of five games
can be selected for saving.  Select the  desired  game  and  then  click
"ok".  The  game  will be saved and play can continue. Alternate tactics
for a given encounter can be explored by saving the battle status  prior
to  performing  the  tactic  in  question.   After  the outcome has been
determined, the prior battle  status  can  be  loaded  in,  allowing  an
alternate tactic to be employed. 


PLAYING OGRE: 

Starting  the  Game: Once the player chooses the field configuration and
weapon deployment, then selecting "Play a Game" from the Menu will start
the actual battle. A dialogue box will appear asking which battle option
the player desires. There are two battle scenarios: Mark III or Mark  V.
Either  scenario  can  be  played  with  two players or the computer can
control the Ogre. Select the desired opion and click "ok". If this is  a
continuation  of  a  previous  game,  a dialogue box will ask whether to
start a new Ogre or continue the game with the original Ogre. Select the
desired option and click "ok".  When starting a new game under  the  two
player  option,  the  player controlling the Ogre must select one of the
hexes at the bottom of the map as and entry point for the  Ogre.   Click
"ok"  on  the  dialogue  box  asking for an entry hex and then select an
entry hex by clicking on it. Once it has entered, the Ogre can move  two
more  hexes.  Most player options are locked out at this point until and
entry hex has been selected for the Ogre. The map can be moved in  order
to scan the battlefield. 

Changing Between One and Two Player Games: It is possible to change from
a  one  player game to a two player game and vice versa. To do so, enter
the Field Editor by selecting "Edit the Field"  from  the  Menu,  during
actual  game  play.  Select "Play a Game" from the Menu. When the battle
option dialogue box appears, select the desired scenario and click "ok".
When the next dialogue box asks to start a new Ogre or continue with the
old one, select the "Keep old Ogre" option.   This  process  allows  the
battle  to continue but with someone (or something) else controlling the
Ogre. This operates somewhat differently when changing between Mark  III
and  Mark  V  scenarios.  If  "Keep old Ogre" is selected, when changing
between Mark III and Mark V scenarios then the number  of  players  will
change  but  the  original  Ogre  type will be maintained. If "Start new
Ogre" is selected then the new ogre type will enter at the bottom of the
map with full weapons and no damage. 

Game Phases: The Phase window near the top of the sidebar  displays  the
current  phase  of  game  play.  The first phase is the Ogre Entry phase
which occurs only at the beginning of a game. During that player's turn,
that player may move any or all of his units, and fire with any  or  all
of them. The phase sequence is: 

1) Ogre Enters

2) Ogre Moves

3)  Ogre  Fires  (After  the  Ogre  fires,  all armor units disabled the
previous turn become active again)

4) Defense Moves

5) Defense Fires

6) GEVs complete their movement

The Sidebar: The sidebar is different while playing the game  than  when
in  the  Field Editor. The area directly beneath the OGRE caption is the
phase window, which shows the current phase of the game.  Directly below
the Phase Window is the Tactical Display. The Tactical Display  is  used
to show the various attributes and conditions of the pieces. Clicking on
a  piece will display that piece's attributes. In addition, the tactical
window is used to display messages in response to any  erroneous  action
performed  by the player(s). Beneath the Tactical Display are te command
buttons. Just as in the Menu, if a button's text  is  dimmed,  then  the
button  is  inactive.  The "Range" and "Done" buttons are always present
(although not always active). During a movement phase, the  top  buttons
are  labeled  "Undo"  and  "Group". During an attack phase, the same top
buttons are labeled "Clear" and "Fire" The buttons work as follows: 

Range Button: The "Range" command is used to view a piece's movement and
attack range. To view a piece's range, select the piece by  clicking  on
it;  then  click  the  "Range" button. All of the hexes within a piece's
movement value (disregarding having to move around  rubble)  are  turned
blue.  Any  piece  that  falls  within  this  "umbrella" is highlighted.
Clicking anywhere on the screen will remove the umbrella. 

Done Button: The "Done" button is used to end a phase. If a  player  has
not  moved or fired all of his pieces when the "Done" button is pressed,
a dialogue box will require verification from  the  next  player  before
proceeding to the next game phase.
