           The Chaos Mailbox System                                             
                                                                                
                                                                                
The Chaos Mailbox System has existed now since May, 1988.  The name is          derived from the Chaos Duo (Waldi and Terra), who got it at a Relay Party       in Nijmegen.                                                                    
This Help file refers to Version 4.0 of the Chamas, which was fully re-         programmed in November to avoid ever-increasing chaos in the Chamas 3.2.        
                                                                                
In general:                                                                     
                                                                                
The German Press Law applies (as for all german Mailbox systems) to the         Chamas, and, as managers, we're responsible for the contents of the message     boards, as long as we're unable to say who the sender is.  Therefore            it's neccessary to register with the Chamas using NICK <nickname>.              Also, any racist, terrorist, war-promoting or personal attacks mistaken for     news in the mailbox will be erased and the sender will be banned from the       Chamas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You can log into the Chamas with help from CHECKIN, whereas                     CHECKIN N prevents the issue picture from coming.                               After the log-in, it is announced which boards contain new messages since       your last log-in.                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
Shell of Chamas                                                                 
                                                                                
Version 4.0 of the Chamas uses a so-called Geoshell.  This was introduced       for the first time by the Geo1 Mailbox X.25 and                                 is today a widespread standard for Mailboxes.  After                            certain technical problems were able to be ironed out, we decided to install    this in the Chamas as well.  You can receive the Chamas's command set           with ?.                                                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
The Chamas Daemon                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
Within the Chamas, there's a daemon, which oversees the Chamas; it is           also responsible for timeouts.                                                  If the user says nothing for a period of 5 minutes while on the Chamas          Relay                                                                           If the user sends nothing to the Chamas for a period of 15 minutes              
                                                                                
                                                                                
Commands for the Chamas:

You can check out online help for the various commands using this command.      e.g. HELP WRITE , HELP BOARD , etc.                                             
                                                                                
BOARD                                                                           This command is pretty important.                                               With BOARD * (or, B *) you can be shown the boards available.                   Behind the board names stand the symbols:                                       
                                                                                
# for writing-protected.  Only users in Level 2 or lower can write to             such boards.  (e.g.  CCC, CCO, etc.)                                          * for reading-protected.  Only users registered on a priviledged user-list        can retrieve from such boards.  Direct inquiries to Terra (151133@DOLUNI1).   + means, you are subscribed to this board.  This is to say, you are immediately   sent new messages in this board.                                              - not subscribed.                                                               
                                                                                
Also with this command, you can 'enter' a board.  This is neccessary in order   to see the contents of a board, etc.                                            You'll receive a listing of those boards which contain the available new        messages.                                                                       You'll receive a listing of those boards containing new news at hand.           
                                                                                
                                                                                
INVENTORY                                                                       
With this command it's possible to ascertain the contents of the boards.        To do that, it's neccessary, through BOARD <boardname>, to be put yourself      in a board.                                                                     
                                                                                
INVENTORY  * ( I * ) will list all the messages in a board.                     
                                                                                
INVENTORY (I) will list all new messages in a board.                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
READ/SEND                                                                       You can, using these commands, read messages, or otherwise have them sent to    you.                                                                            
e.g.:  RE 1403 or SE 1411 1412.                                                 
Should a file be longer than 50 lines, it can only be sent to you.              
                                                                                
                                                                                
WRITE                                                                           
This command enables you to receive short instructions regarding how            to write into the Chamas Boards or else the News Net.                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
SUBSCRIBE                                                                       
This command lets you register with the Netnews and the Chamas Boards.          The domain is always required.                                                  So, for example, SUB chamas.general  oder  SUB sub.market.                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
UNSUBSCRIBE                                                                     
Exactly.....just for unsubscribing.                                             
                                                                                
                                                                                
NET                                                                             
With this command it's possible to check out what network groups are            available and whether you're subscribed.                                        
                                                                                
NET shows which network groups there are.  At present these are SUB and         
DNET.  These are also the domains for the SUBSCRIBE, WRITE, etc. commands.      
                                                                                
Using NET <net group>, you can determine with which groups you are registered.  e.g.:  NET SUB.                                                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
ADDRESS                                                                         
ADDRESS gives you personal data about yourself.                                 
With ADDRESS <nickname>, you can determine the UserId and NodeId of another     user.                                                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
CALL

To exit a board and return to the main menu, type EXIT.                         With EXIT *  you leave the Chamas entirely.  In the main menu, however,         EXIT is sufficient to get you out of the System.
