EACH TURN IS 12 HOURS YOU MAY: 

1) BUILD AND ADJUST FRIENDLY TASK FORCE
2) MOVE TASK FORCES
3) LAUNCH AIR MISSIONS
4) LAUNCH MISSILE ATTACKS
5) RESOLVE COMBAT

(FOR THE PURPOSES OF MY TYPING, THE WORDS "TASK FORCE" WILL HEREBY  BE
REFERRED TO AS: TF)

NOTES

TASK FORCE MOVEMENT
===================

MOVING OF TF'S EXPENDS MOVEMENT POINTS. THE POINTS ARE DETERMINED
BY FLEET SPEED.

FLEET SPEED
-----------

30 KNOTS OR THE LOWEST SPEED OF THE SLOWEST SHIP, WHICHEVER IS LOWER

MOVEMENT
--------

1. TF RECEIVES 1 MP FOR EACH 2 1/2 KNOTS. (AT LEAST 3 MP'S)
2. 2 MP'S FOR EACH MOVE N,S,E,W
3. 3 MP'S FOR EACH MOVE NW,NE,SW,SE
4. TF WITH FEWER THAN 2 MP'S CAN NOT MOVE, BUT CAN DOCK
5. PRESSING "A" WILL START THE MOVE OVER FOR THAT SHIP ONLY
6. TF'S CAN NOT ENTER LAND

ENTERING HARBOR-UNLOADING
-------------------------

1. TF THAT BEGINS MOVE ON FRIENDLY  BASE MAY UNLOAD BY DOCKING. IF YOU
   BEGIN IN HARBOR AND WISHES TO EXIT HARBOR BUT STAY IN SAME SQUARE,
   HIT   "0"
2. EACH SHIP MAY INLOAD 18 COMPANTRIES OR 3 SUPPLIES
3. WHILE IN HARBOR, A TF IS IMMUNE TO SHIPS, SUBS, OR MISSLES

4. WHILE IN HARBOR, A SHIP IS EASIER TO HIT WITH BOMBS.

5. TO UNLOAD TROOP/SUPPLIES AT AND ENEMY BASE, FOLLOW THE ABOVE
   PROCEDURE BUT THE RATE IS HALVED

MOVEMENT SEQUENCE
-----------------

1. MOVE TF'S BY NUMBER.  ONCE A TF HAS BEEN MOVED, IT CAN NOT BE
  REVERSED
2. PRESSING "S" WILL EXAMINE A TF
3. PRESS "M" FOR EW MODE:  TF'S IN EW WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY SEEN, BUT
   WILL FIND TARGETS EASIER

LAND ATTACKS
============

WHEN SOVIET AND NATO TROOPS OCCUPY ICELAND OR FAROES, LAND ATTACK WILL
TAKE PLACE:

0=NO ATTACK
5=BANZAI!

(SUPPLIES CONSUMED WILL EQUAL THE LEVEL OF ATTACK)

AIR OPERATIONS
==============

1. CAP
2. OBSERVE SEARCH RESULTS
3. LAUNCH STRIKES
4. TRANSFER AIRCRAFT
5. LAUNCH SSM/ASW ATTACKS

CAP (Combat Air Patrol)

   CAP MISSIONS
2. FIGHTERS FLY: NORMAL CAP, AND LONG RANGE CAP

NORMAL- PROTECT TF OR BASE FROM WHICH IT ORIGINATED
LONG RANGE- PROTECT ANY BASE/TF WITHIN ITS RANGE
            (FOR CAP, RANGE=1/2 STRIKE)

3. THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO INTERCEPT AIR TO AIR MISSLE DIGFIGHT
   (BOTH WILL OCCUR IF CAP INTERCEPTS AIRCRAFT WITH STANDOFF RANGE AS 0)

AIRCRAFT TRANSFER
-----------------

AIRCRAFT TRANSFERS MAY BE PERFORMED BETWEEN CARRIERS/BASES WITH:

1) ONLY 4 TRANSFERS PER TURN
2) TRANSPORT CRAFT (CUB,STARLIFTER) MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE FIRST 2
   MISSIONS IN A.M. TURNS ONLY
3) RANGE IS TRIPLED

(WHEN USING THE TRASPORT CRAFT, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO SEND TROOPS OR
SUPPLIES ALONG WITH THEM)


AIRBORNE ASSAULT
----------------

AN AIRBORNE ASSAULT WILL OCCUR WHEN TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT ARE ENGAGED IN
A MISSION TO EBEMY CONTROLLED ICELAND OR FAROES

1) ONLY 1 ASSAULT/TURN
2) EACH PLANE WILL ATTEMPT TO DROP 1 COMPANY OF INFANTRY. IF THE PLANE
   IS DESTROYED, SO ARE IS THE COMPANY
3) THE DROPPED INFANTRY WILL AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGE IN A LEVEL 5
   ATTACK UPON THEIR DROP

LAUNCHING SSM/ASW
-----------------

1) TF'S MAY USE SSM/ASW TO ATTACK SUBS OR SURFACE SHIPS SIGHTED DURING
THE SEARCH PHASE.  TF'S IN HARBOR CAN NOT FIRE/BE HIT BY SSM/ASW

2)  IF  YOU  SELECT A SHIP TO FIRE, THE COMPUTER WILL LET YOU DO SO IF
YOU ARE IN RANGE.  RANGE OF SSM IN SQUARES=RANHE OF KM/100

3) IF THE ATTACKING TF IS IN EW MODE, EACH SHIP  IN  THAT  TF  WITHOUT
SSM, WIL FIRE A SAM INSTEAD

4) IF A SUB TF IS CHOSEN, THERE IS A 50% CHANCE OF A FIRING

5) WHEN A SUB IS IN A SSM/ASW ATTACK, EACH SUB WILL HAVE 33% CHANCE OF
FIRING 6)TO IDENTIFY TARGETS, HIT "S" WHEN ASKED FOR TARGET

COMBAT RESOLUTION
=================

1) AIR STRIKE
2) MISSLE (SSM,ASM,ASW)
3) SURFACE AND SUB COMBAT
4) RETURN AIRCRAFT TO BASES
5) LAND COMBAT
6) REPAIR AND REFIT SHIPS
7) REINFORCEMENTS

AIR STRIKE
----------

1) AIR EARLY-WARNING
2) LONG RANGE AAM COMBAT
3) DIGFIGHT
4) SHIPS FIRE LONG RANGE SAM'S
5) BOMBERS LAUNCH ASM'S
6) FLAK
7) BOMBERS DROP BOMBS

1) EARLY WARNING AIRCRAFT DETECT STRIKES 8 SPACES AWAY.
2) LONG RANGE AAM COMBAT MAY OCCUR IF THE CAP IS EQUIPPED WITH:
   PHOENIX, AMRAAM, OR APEX MISSLES

      PHOENIX: 3
      AMRAAM:  2
      APEX:    1

AAM'S FIRED BY STRIKING AIRCRAFT MAY FIND TARGETS WHEREVER THEY ARE.
THE SUCCESS OF EACH AAM FIRED IS REDUCED BY THE EW OF THE CARRIER/BASE
ATTACKED AND THE TARGET AIRCRAFT
FIGHTER AIRCRAFT MUST BE ABLE TO LOCK ON TO TARGETS TO FIRE AT THEM.
THECHANCES OF A LOCK ON IS DETERMINED BY THE RADAR STRENGTH.
THE CHANCE OF HITTING AN ENEMY PLANE WITH A MISSLE
IS AFFECTED BY THE ECM RATING OF THE TARGET:

TORNADO: 3    INTRUDER: 4  BACKFIRE:  3
FALCON:  1    HARRIER:  1  BADGER:    1
TOMCAT:  3    FORGER:   0  CUB:       0
EAGLE:   3    FLOGGER:  1  STARLIFT:  0
CORSAIR: 1    FENCER:   1

HIGHER ECM RATING -> LOWER CHANCE OF BEING HIT

3.   DOGFIGHT: INDIVIDUAL CAP FIGHTERS WILL CHOOSE A TARGET AND ATTACK
IT. IF THE ATTACK FAILS, THE OTHER PLANE MAY ATTACK.  THE RATINGS  FOR
DOGFIGHT ABILITY: 

TORNADO: 4   INTRUDER: 1   BACKFIRE: 1
FALCON:  5   HARRIER:  3   BADGER:   1
TOMCAT:  4   FORGER:   2   CUB:      1
EAGLE:   5   FLOGGER:  4   STARLIFT: 1
CORSAIR: 2   FENCER:   2

HIGHER RATING -> CHANCE OF BEING ENGAGED

AAM= SIDEWINDER: +2 POINTS
AAM= APHID: +1 POINT


4)  SHIPS  IN TARGET TF'S MAY FIRE SAM'S IF THERE IS NO STANDOFF RANGE
OR THE MISSLE RANGE IS GREATER THAN THE  STANDOFF  RANGE.   NUMBER  OF
SAM'S FIRED IS DEPENDENT UPON TYPE OF SAM: 

STANDARD: 4  SA-N-1: 1  SA-N-6: 3
SEADART:  2  SA-N-3: 2  SA-N-7: 4
SEASLUG:  1

AEGIS  CRUISERS,  TICONDEROGA, AND TORKTOWN MAY FIRE 8 STANDARD SAM'S,
THERE IS A 50% CHANCE OF A SHIP NOT FIRING AND SAM'S DURING A STRIKE


5) BOMBERS THAT SURVIVE MAY SHOOT ASM'S

6) IF STANDOFF RANGE IS 0, THE  BOMBERS  WILL  BE  ATTACKED  BY  FLAK.
SURVIVORS WILL BE PERMITTED TO ATTACK. 

7)  THE CHANCE OF A BOMBER BEING SHOT DOWN BY FLAK = TF FLAK STRENGTH+
TARGETS MISSLE DEFENSE STRENGTH, DIVIDED BY 500.  THE TF FLAK STRENGTH
IS COMBINED AA RATING OF ALL SHIPS IN THE TF.  IF THERE ARE MORE  THAN
12 SHIPS IN A TF, THE RATING IS THE AVERAGE OF THE SHIPS. 

8.  CHANCE OF BOMB HITTING TARGET IS AFFECTED BY: 

A. BOMBER ACCURACY
B. MAXIMUM SPEED OF TARGET
C. FLAK INTENSITY
D. RANGE OF STRIKE
E. SIZE OF TARGE
F. RADAR ON BOMBER (NIGHT ONLY)
