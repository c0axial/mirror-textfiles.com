RE: Robner Case

Although  it  appears that at least one member of the Robner household
had a reason for wishing Mr.Robner dead, the findings of  the  Medical
Examiner  and  evidence  gained  from  interviews  with the family and
family associates are only consistent with  the  conclusion  that  Mr.
Robner died of a self-administered overdose of Ebullion.

Summary of findings from Coroner's Examination: 

Name  - Robner,Marshall File No - H657/SJ43.1 Date - 7/8/82 Sex - Male
/Race - Caucasian /Color of Eyes - Brown /Color of Hair - Gray /Ht- 5'
11 /Wt - 192 lbs. /Distinguishing M arks  -  None  Apparent  Cause  of
Death - Drug overdose (Ebullion)

Front  and Back outline of body Small "x" written on left side of head
in Front View of Body

Explanation:  There were no injuries or marks of a suspicious  nature,
except  a  small bruise on the left temple (consistent with falling to
the floor from a chair). 

Analysis of the blood of the deceased revealed a blood level of  27mg%
for  Ebullion.   The therapeutic range of this drug is normally 4 to 6
mg%. A fatal dose, while not specified by the manufacturer,  has  been
found  to  be  in  the  10-20mg%  range.  A routine analysis for other
common drugs was unproductive. 

Findings were unremarkable except for massive liver damage  consistent
with  overdose  of  Ebullion,  and 10mg of Ebullion recovered from the
stomach. Death occurred at 1 AM, plus or minus one hour. 

The blood level of Ebullion and the massive  liver  damage  consistent
with  Ebullion  toxicity  lead  to  the inevitable conclusion that the
deceased died of an overdose of that drug.

Dear Chief:

I must once again ask for you assistance on a case involving one of my
clients. 

As you are no doubt aware, Mr.  Marshall Robner, the industrialist and
philanthropist, was found dead yesterday morning in his home.  As  far
as I can determine, he was found dead on the floor of his library, the
victim of an overdose of Ebullion, a medicine which he had been taking
lately  for  severe bouts of depression.  He had been alone during the
night, and the door to his library had been bolted  from  the  inside.
Police had to break the door down with axes, I'm told, to get inside. 

While  I  am completely convinced that there was no foul play involved
in Mr. Robner's death, it is disturbing that Mr.  Robner had called me
only three days earlier for the purpose of informing me that his  will
was to be altered. In fact, I was expecting to hear form him this week
so  that  he  could  deliver  the papers to me.  Given the size of the
Robner estate, I feel that a more  complete  investigation  should  be
undertakes,  if for no other reason that to quash the suspicions which
are inevitable in these circumstances. 

I have sifted through  the  evidence  gathered  by  the  local  police
authorities  and am passing it along for your inspection I phoned Mrs.
Robner this morning and informed her of my  intention  of  having  you
take  on  the  case.  She  was  reluctant  to  be of assistance, but I
convinced her to allow you to come around at  eight  o'clock  tomorrow
morning and spend the day. 

I will be at the house at noon tomorrow for the reading of the current
will,  which  Mr.  Robner  wrote  a  few year s ago. I hope to see you
then. 

                         Sincerely yours,
                         
                          Signed- Warren Coates

Interviews - Excerpts--

Mrs. Robner

Detective Anderson : How did you come to find Mr. Robner? 

Mrs. Robner : When I woke up this morning, I noticed that Marshall was
not  in  bed.  I wasn't alarmed, really, as it was not unusual for him
to work late at night in the library and fall  asleep  there,  I  went
down  the hall to the library and knocked on the door.  Hadn't answer,
so I knocked even harder.  When that didn't work,  I  started  calling
his  name  loudly.   So  loud, actually, that I woke up Ms. Dunbar and
George. We all were gathered there, knocking and yelling, and  finally
Mrs. Rourke, our housekeeper, was alarmed enough to come upstairs. She
suggested  calling the police, which we did. They arrived about twenty
minutes later, and started breaking down the door with axes.  When  we
entered the room, we found Marshall lying on the floor, face down. 

Anderson: Did he usually keep his door locked when he worked? 

Robner:  Almost  always. He was pretty secretive about his work and he
liked to be alone when he worked. 

Anderson: Do you know of any reason why your husband might have wanted
to take his own life? 

Robner: He's been very  depressed  lately,  you  know.  His  business,
Robner  Corporation,  is  not doing well, and there is talk of selling
out to a larger firm. Marshall founded the company, what, about twenty
six years ago, and he has been desperately trying to find some way  of
saving it. 

Anderson: The pills we found by his body, do you know what they are? 

Robner:  Yes. They were Ebullion tablets.  It's an anti-depressant his
doctor prescribed for him just last week. 

Anderson: Had he been acting less depressed since then? 

Robner: I really don't know. I haven't noticed much change. 

Anderson: Did your husband ever talk of suicide? 

Robner: He did, actually, though I never took it seriously.  He  would
talk about how everything would be easier if he were dead, but then he
would  start  again talking about how he was going to have to keep the
business going. I'm... I'm stunned, really. 

Anderson: Mrs. Robner, do you know of anyone who might have wanted  to
kill your husband? 

Robner:  Why, no. Of course not. He wasn't a very friendly man, he was
very quiet. But he was a great philanthropist, you know, and  everyone
that  knew  him respected him.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt
Marshall.  Do you really suspect he didn't commit suicide? 

Anderson: I don't suspect anything. I just want to  understand  what's
happened.

Interview-- Ms. Dunbar

Detective Anderson: You were Mr. Robner's personal secretary, is  that
right? 

Ms. Dunbar: Yes,sir. 

Anderson: I understand that you were the last person to see Mr. Robner
alive.  Could you tell me about that? 

Dunbar:  Why,  yes.  I brought him some tea at about 11 PM that night.
On nights when he expected to work late, he would always expect tea at
that hour. I brought him the tea and he  asked  me  to  leave.  That's
all. 

Anderson : Did Mr. Robner seem at all upset? 

Dunbar:  He  did  appear quite nervous, but he had been upset for some
time, as you know. 

Anderson: Do you know what he was working on  that  evening?   Dunbar:
No. I wasn't with him, except for that one time. 

Anderson: Do you recall whether the pills, the Ebullion pills, were on
the desk when you came in? 

Dunbar: No, I don't remember that. 

Anderson:  Ms.  Dunbar,  were  you  with Mrs. Robner when the door was
opened by the police? 

Dunbar: Yes

Anderson: Do you remember  her  reaction?   Anything  she  might  have
said? 

Dunbar:  She didn't really react much. I don't think she said anything
except "He's dead." or something of that sort. She  just  stood  there
with the rest of us until you people arrived. 

Anderson:  How  were  the  Robners  getting  along?  I mean, were they
happily married? 

Dunbar: I don't thing so, really. He was so quiet  and,  well  dreamy.
She  was  always  scolding  him  for  paying too much attention to the
business and to his "good works".  They rarely went out lately,  which
seemed  to  upset  Mrs.Robner  quite a bit. She had friends of her own
that  she  used  to  visit.  I  think  she  would  have  gone  insane,
otherwise. 

Anderson: Thank you, Ms. Dunbar. Oh, one last thing.  You prepared the
tea for Mr. Robner? 

Dunbar:  Yes, I started the water boiling about a quarter of, and then
poured the tea when I heard the whistle from the living room. 

Anderson: You weren't in the kitchen during the time? 

Dunbar: I just told you, no. 

Anderson: Was anyone else awake in the house while you were waiting? 

Dunbar: Yes, I believe that both George and Mrs.Robner were  awake.  I
remember George coming down, reading for a bit, then retiring. 

Anderson:  Do  you  believe  anyone  might  have  a reason to kill Mr.
Robner? 

Dunbar: No, I can't imagine it. 

Anderson: Thank you, Ms. Dunbar. Oh, Ms. Dunbar, were you at home  all
night, last night I mean? 

Dunbar:  Well, no, actually. I was out with a friend last night and we
didn't get back until about 10:30 or thereabouts. 

Anderson: Thanks again, Ms. Dunbar.

Interview - Mr. Baxter

Detective  Anderson:  You  were Mr. Robner's business partner, is that
correct? 

Baxter : That's right. 

Anderson: How long have you and Mr. Robner been partners? 

Baxter: For about twenty five years now.  I  was  his  partner  almost
from the start of the business. 

Anderson:  Mrs.  Robner  tells me that there have been problems lately
with the business. Could you tell me what that's all about? 

Baxter: Yes, the business has its problems, some of them quite  large.
Marshall  and I were working on a plan to solve those problems and get
the company back on its feet again before we would be forced  to  take
drastic  action.  I  hope  that  I  can  hold things together now that
Marshall is dead.  He was the founder of the business  and  controlled
many things by himself. 

Anderson:  Did Mr. Robner ever talk to you about personal problems, or
how he felt? 

Baxter: No, we were business partner, not intimate  fiends.   I  don't
think  he  really  had any close friends. I know he has gotten himself
very upset about the business, but that's the extent of it. 

Anderson: When was the last time you saw Mr. Robner? 

Baxter: Yesterday afternoon, at our office in town. 

Anderson: And where were you after work? 

Baxter: Last night was my concert night at the Hartford  Symphony.   I
go  there  quite  regularly.  After the concert, at about 10 o'clock,I
went home. I received a call from Ms. Dunbar this morning  telling  me
of the tragedy, and I arrived here just a few minutes ago. 

Anderson: Were you at the concert alone? 

Baxter: Quite alone. 

Anderson:  Do  you  know  of  anyone who might have wanted to harm Mr.
Robner? 

Baxter: No. Except for  George,  of  course.   During  some  of  their
shouting  matches  I've  heard  George  threaten Marshall, but I don't
really think he ever would have followed through. 

Anderson: Shouting matches? 

Baxter: George and Marshall were always at odds.  You see, George  has
been  living  like  a spoiled child all of his life.  He's twenty five
now and has never held a job. Just spends money, or  gamble  it  away.
Being  the  Robners'  only  child, he gets away with murder.  Marshall
would lecture him and threaten to cut him, off  without  a  cent,  and
then the yelling would start.  Eventually Marshall would give in. 

Anderson: When was the last time you heard this? 

Baxter:  Actually, I heard it again just last week.  strange, now that
I think of it, they went at it just last week.  I hear  that  Marshall
told  George that he had decided to disinherit him.  He even mentioned
it to me at the office the next  day.  He  seemed  pretty  serious.  I
suppose  that  the  financial  troubles  at  the company may have been
responsible for his attitude. 

Anderson: Are you at the house often? You say you have heard  some  of
these "shouting matches". 

Baxter:  Well,  I'm  not here often. Only on occasion. I have heard it
once or twice and have been told of other times. 

Anderson: Thank you, Mr. Baxter

Interview-- George Robner

Detective  Anderson:  Mr.  Robner, I have been told by Mr. Baxter that
you and your father had some serious arguments lately. Could you  tell
me what they were about? 

George Robner: I don't think that's your business. 

Anderson:  I'm  told  they  had  to  do  with  you habit of wasting or
gambling away your father's money. 

Robner: So? 

Anderson: I've even been told that he threatened to disinherit you. 

Robner: Yeah. He said he was going to.  I'll bet he didn't though.  He
never has. 

Anderson:  Mr. Robner, let me be frank.  I'm, told that you threatened
violence against your father as recently as a week ago, and  now  he's
dead. 

Robner:  Look,  I don't get what you're driving at.  You find the poor
guy dead in his room.  The room is locked. His bottle of  medicine  is
nearly empty. What sort of detective are your, anyway? 

Anderson: I'm doing th asking, if you don't mind. 

Robner: The ask someone else. 



Note: G.R. left abruptly at this point.

Interview - Mrs. Rourke

Anderson: Mrs. Rourke, how long have you been working  as  housekeeper
for the Robners? 

Rourke: Ever since the house was built, six years ago. 

Anderson: Tell em all you remember from the night of the murder. 

Rourke: I remember that by about 10:30 or so.. 

Anderson: You mean 10:30 PM. 

Rourke:  Yes.  By  10:30  when  I  went to my room to do some reading,
everyone was upstairs excepting Ms.  Dunbar,  who  had  just  returned
home.  She  went  upstairs  about 11, bringing Mr. Robner his tea.  He
almost always takes his tea at 11. I remember  saying  good  night  to
here  on  her  way up, and that's the last I heard until this morning,
with all the shouting and banging going on upstairs.  No,  that  isn't
right. George was downstairs also fr a while, only about 10 minutes or
so. 

Anderson: Could someone have gone upstairs during the night? 

Rourke:  I  don't  rightly  think so, as least not before 3 or 4.  You
see, I like to do some reading late at night, and I was  reading  this
really  exciting  mystery  story,  and,  lord, I was up until nearly 4
o'clock before I finished. And who do you think the murderer was? 

Anderson: Really, Mrs. Rourke, let's stick to the matter at hand.   Do
you keep you door closed at night when you are reading? 

Rourke: Yes, sir. 

Anderson:  So  then  it's possible that someone might have entered the
house and gone upstairs without your knowledge. 

Rourke: No, sir. I don't believe so. Why  don't  you  try  the  stairs
yourself?   For  a  new house, these stairs are the noisiest I've ever
heard. My door's right beside it, too. When the Robners owned a little
cat, I can remember hearing every footstep  creaking  up  the  stairs.
Don't  know  why  they  don't ever fix it up.  I guess it don't bother
them any. 

Anderson: But it is possible that someone might have entered after you
went off to sleep. 

Rourke: Well, I suppose it might be, but not before. 

Anderson: How long has Ms.Dunbard been living here? 

Rourke: Ever since the place was built.  She does an awful lot of work
for Mr. Robner, you know.  I don't think he could  have  gotten  along
without  her, although that's not my business to say. He was always so
nervous, fretting about everything, and forgetting to this  and  that.
It  seemed  that  she  was  always  covering his tracks, if you get my
meaning. 

Anderson: Do you have any reason to suspect anyone of wanting to  harm
Mr. Robner? 

Rourke:  Well,  of  course I've heard all of the screaming and fussing
with George and Mr. Robner. That's been going on for years, now  so  I
don't  make much of it anymore.  No, I can't imagine anyone wanting to
hurt poor Mr.Robner.  He was such a sweet man. 

Anderson: Thank you, Mrs.Rourke.
