Note from the Author
====================

Ok, the reason I didn't make one of my regular cheats is that AirBall required
modifications which couldn't practically be applied on a relocatable (S16)
file.  The AirBall cheat is therefore a CDA.  This in itself poses a problem,
as the program must be searched for in memory (after all, it IS relocatable).
The advantages of having extra code space for the cheat in memory, however,
outweigh the AirBall-relocation-searcher problems.  Because of the CDA, I was
able to actually install an extra key-command into AirBall, as documented in
the use of the cheat below.


How to Use the Cheat
====================

First of all, put the CDA into either your /AIRBALL/SYSTEM/DESK.ACCS/ sub-
directory, or in the corresponding subdirectory on your hard drive, if you like
to launch AirBall from the Finder or whatever.  Reboot your system to get GS/OS
to load the CDA.

Next, launch either AirBall.Dragons or AirBall.NoDrag.  The cheat does not
completely work with the dragons version; this is because I like the no-dragons
version better.  Therefore, you're better off running the no-dragons version.

Get to the point where the AirBall is being inflated on those air-blower
gizmos, and press Control-Open Apple-ESC.  Select "AirBall Cheat  by  >>Joe
User".

If the cheat installs fine, it will make a low-pitch to high-pitch chirp and
then put you on Quit in the Control Panel.  If you haven't loaded AirBall and
you try to run the cheat (or AirBall has been damaged), the cheat will wait
some time then give you a high-pitch to low-pitch chirp.  (The reverse of the
other one!)

The first thing you'll notice upon returning to AirBall is that you have
infinite men.  (This works on either the dragons or the no-dragons version.)

When you press Control-C, the cheat will give you a low-high chirp, telling
you it's on.  Your AirBall will no longer leak air, nor will it explode when
you stay too long on the blower gizmos, and it is now INVUNERABLE to those
various pointy objects lying around the castle.  Press Control-C to turn the
cheat off again, giving you the high-low chirp.  (Control-C crashes in the
dragons version.)


Hints
=====

Having an invunerability cheat can get you into T-R-O-U-B-L-E.  The original
author of the game (Jason Harper) didn't intend for that little AirBall to be
in some of the places you can get it to with the cheat.  Therefore, if you
find yourself hopelessly stuck somewhere (happens all the time), press Control-
C to turn off the cheat.  You'll die, but you DO have infinite men, and you'll
be returned to the last air-blower gizmo you touched.  This is a good reason
to land on evey air-blower gizmo you see, even though with the cheat you don't
need to use them.


Have fun!
