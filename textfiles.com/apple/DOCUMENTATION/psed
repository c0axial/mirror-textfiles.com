Updates

v1.0 :   The CTRL-R (repeat) option was modified, thus making it easier to use
         that command.
     :   The Open Apple-C (clear) option was changed to CTRL-K.
     :   A Spinning Cursor option was added (Open Apple-C).
v1.0a:   There was an error in the Spinning Cursor option (would jump back two
         spaces).  This has been fixed.
v1.1 :   There was a MASSIVE error in the "buffer".  (would crash if you
         entered in more than 5000 bytes).  This has been fixed (took me long
         enough)
v1.1a:   There was a small error in the Clear Buffer option.  (would print a
         lower case "k" after you cleared the buffer, and would keep the
         current screen position)
     :   A few "tiny" bugs were fixed. (the bytes free were not always updated
         on a few commands (like Repeat)
     :   Some small things were added.. You will notice them when you use the
         program
v1.2 :   Well I thought I fixed the storage error in V1.1, but it seems that I
         didn't... WELL.. It's been fixed in this version.. I've taken the
         program through MANY EXCRUCIATING tests to see if it was working this
         time. (the error was that you couldn't make files that were greater
         than 3000 or so bytes long)
     :   A "Quit" option was added by the request of Tempus Thales
v1.2a:   The Spinning Cursor has been sped up a bit.
v1.3 :   A LOAD FEATURE HAS NOW BEEN ADDED.  Yes, the highly requested command
         has been added to the program.  (lets you LOAD text files up so you
         can edit them)
     :   A KeyClick option was now added so you can create the illusion of
         someone actually "typing" something out.
     :   The Clear Buffer option command key was changed... This is the second
         time I have done this, sorry... this is the last time it will be
         changed.
     :   A help option was added.  This was requested by Ivan Drago.  It will
         give you a mousetext chart, and a control character chart.
         (when you pull up the help option, the SPACEBAR, RETURN, and ESC keys
         will get you back to your file)
v1.4 :   There was a MASSIVE error in the Tucking/Untucking routines I wrote
         (to store and retrieve the text pages).  The screen would sometimes
         fill up with garbage after an old screen was restored.  This has been
         FIXED; I RE-WROTE the routines in ML and I changed them around a bit.
         They COOK! (speed wise)
     :   There were alot of bugs in the Repeat Character option, they've all
         been fixed.  Plus the Repeat Character command has been modified a
         little (the screen is now restored when you hit RETURN or abort the
         repeat... thus any EXTRA characters that were on the screen cuz of
         repeat command--or any characters that got deleted while scrolling
         over them--will be brought back)
     :   There was a slight bug in the Free Movement command, whereas if you
         were in MouseText mode when you went into Free Movement you would be
         in Normal Text mode when you came out.  This has been fixed.
     :   The Editor will now display the current time (if you have a ProDOS
         compatable clock)
     :   The KeyClick option wasn't accessable by you (cuz I fucked up).  Now
         it can be (plus it Clicks so YOU can hear it!)
v1.4a:   Slight problem that MY program isn't exactly 100% compatable with
         ProTERM Special (at least the way that THAT OTHER GUY (that wrote it)
         thinks it should be).  I've taken a step forward in fixing this
         problem, but haven't TOTALLY fixed it.  V4.3 WILL have it ALL fixed.
v1.4b:   Well.. After alot of testing, I've found that my program is about 98%
         compatable.. I say this because, whenever I write a file and view it
         the files are fine, except on a few occations..  All I can say is
         the guy that wrote ProTERM Special is really fucked.
     :   Some small screen margin bugs were fixed
     :   The SAVE BUFFER feature was saving one additional byte that would
         throw off a text editor, and could possible screw up your file..
         This was fixed.
     :   I added a small text files that is a type of "Credit" file that I
         would appreciate that you would load into memory before you start
         writing a new file, this way I will know what files were written with
         my editor, and I can see if they are working properly.. Plus it will
         help others, who would like to write ProTERM Special text files, to
         know what to look for (program wise).
v1.4c:   There was a slight problem with the Repeat Character command.  (If
         you exceed the max length of 126 then what was sent to the buffer was
         really fucked).  This has been fixed
     :   Positioning bug in the Repeat Character command was fixed

                 ** THIS IS THE LAST RELEASE UNTIL V2.0 (ML) **
            (unless I find some massive bugs that need to be fixed)
