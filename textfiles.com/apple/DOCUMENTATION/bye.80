                               Better Bye 80
                               A program by:

                               David D. Ely

     BYE.80 is a selector program called from memory whenever a ProDOS QUIT or BASIC BYE is given. This program is based on Alan Birds' Better Bye but works ONLY in 80 columns and gives the user the added ability to choose from 32 System programs and/or Directories. I wrote this version for Hard Disk users, however, all users of large storage devices will appreciate the added control.

     To use Better Bye, simply move the Light Bar to the desired program or directory name, and press return. If a directory is chosen, a new set of programs and/or directories will be presented. Pressing escape will allow you to change Volumes.

     This program is donated to the Public Domain, however, you must contact the author for the right to include this program in any commercial software.

     For those who wish to permanently change ProDOS the following table of QUIT code locations is given:

            Operating               QUIT
             System                 Code
            Version               Location

          ProDOS    1.0            $5900
          ProDOS    1.1.1          $5700
          ProDOS 8  1.2            $5900
          ProDOS 8  1.3            $5900
          ProDOS 8  1.4            $5900

     The process to be used is as follows (note:always use a backup file!):

          BLOAD BYE.80,A$2000,TSYS
          BSAVE BYE,A$2054,L$300
          UNLOCK PRODOS (if nessasary)
          BLOAD PRODOS,A$2000,TSYS
          BLOAD BYE,A$5X00
          BSAVE PRODOS,A$2000,TSYS
          LOCK PRODOS

     This program is part of a series of programs that explore the QUIT code in ProDOS and is distributed with the permission of Alan L. Bird, the originator of the Better Bye selector program. For more information (or source code) write to the address given at the beginning of this file.
