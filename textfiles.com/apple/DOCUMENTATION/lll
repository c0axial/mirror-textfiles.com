Using L.L.L. with Print Shop
----------------------------
Some graphics, fonts, and borders have been included with L.L.L. , but many
others are available. L.L.L. is designed to work with "Print Shop" graphics,
fonts, and borders. These are found on the "Print Shop" program disk, the Print
Shop Companion, and The Print Shop Graphics Libraries. Elements from The Print
Shop Companion and The Print Shop Graphics Libraries can be used without
modification. Using elements from The Print Shop program disk requires placing
them on a standard data disk. For graphics, this can be done with the Graphic
Editor on the Print Shop program disk. Fonts and borders can be saved to a
standard data disk by using the Font Editor and Border Editor on the Print Shop
Companion disk. See Appendix A for more details. Print Shop is a trademark of
Broderbund Software.

GS Print Shop
-------------
L.L.L. works with multi-color graphics like those found in the GS version of
Print Shop. These can be printed in color on a color printer or with gray shades
on a B/W printer. L.L.L. does not use multi-color borders.

MiniPix
-------
L.L.L. can use graphics found on the MiniPix program by Beagle Bros Software.
MiniPix is a trademark of Beagle Bros.

Newsroom Clip Art
-----------------
Newsroom Clip Art can be converted to a Print Shop compatible graphic with the
PS Lovers's Utility Set (P.L.U.S.), available from the Big Red Computer Club. It
may then be used with L.L.L.


Using Labels, Labels, Labels

Making a Backup Copy
--------------------
L.L.L. is supplied on a ProDOS formatted disk and is not copy protected. You can
make archive copies for your own personal use with the ProDOS Filer or System
Utilities disk or other disk copying program.

Hard Disk and 3.5" Disk Installation
------------------------------------
L.L.L. can be used on a ProDOS compatible hard disk. To install the program on
your hard disk, copy all of the files from the L.L.L. program disk to a
subdirectory on your hard disk. L.L.L. will not function properly unless all the
program files on the L.L.L. disk reside on the same directory.

Starting the Program
--------------------
Insert the L.L.L. diskette into your disk drive with the label side up. Turn on
the computer or otherwise boot the L.L.L. program. This will bring up the LABEL
MENU for the program.

Using the Menus
---------------
Working with L.L.L. is easy because it is menu driven; that is, your choices
appear in lists or menus on the screen. You make your selection by using the
arrow keys to highlight your choice and then pressing the RETURN key. Pressing
the ESC key returns you to the previous menu.

Remember:
---------
Use the arrow keys to highlight your selection, press the RETURN key to perform
the selected function. Press the ESC key to return to the previous menu.


Cancelling Printer Operations
-----------------------------
It is possible to cancel all print operations by pressing the ESC key while the
printer is working.


Creating Labels

The same procedure is followed for creating each of the standard size labels.
Creating a label is a process of choosing a border, graphic(s), a font, and then
entering any text to be printed on the label. Users with color printers can also
specify different colors for each element of the label.

Choose Size of Label
--------------------
Begin by highlighting the type of label you want to create from the LABEL MENU
and press RETURN. Six standard label sizes are built into L.L.L.:

3-1/2" X 15/16"
3-1/2" X 1-7/16"
4"     X 15/16"
5"     X 15/16"
5"     X 3-1/2"

Other label sizes can be created by selecting Custom Size which is explained in
Appendix B.

The next screen asks if you want to create a label or load a previously saved
label. When you load a label, it is automatically converted to the size of the
label that was selected from the LABEL MENU. Once a label has been loaded, the
PRINT MENU is displayed. The loaded label may then be edited or printed.

Select a Border Type
--------------------
You are first asked to choose a border or part of a border for your label. You
can choose:  no border; top only; sides only; top and sides; bottom only; top
and bottom; bottom and sides; or full border. Highlight your choice and press
RETURN. Choosing no border allows more room on your label for text and graphics.

Select a Disk
-------------
When you boot the L.L.L. program, it examines you computer to identify all disk
drives connected to it. Each time you load a border, graphic, or font, the
available drives are displayed by their slot and drive number. To load an
element, place the data disk in a drive and select that slot and drive number
from the menu. A list of the borders, graphics, or fonts on the disk in the
selected drive is displayed and you can select the element that you want to
load. The data disk can be either a DOS 3.3 or ProDOS disk.

Place a disk with the desired border in one of your disk drives and choose the
appropriate slot and drive from the menu. All of the borders on the disk are
displayed on the screen.

Select a Border
---------------
Choose one of the borders from the disk by highlighting it and pressing RETURN.
When you press RETURN, the border is loaded from the disk. If the disk has been
removed or some type of error occurs while reading the disk, an I/O error
message will be displayed. If an error occurs, press ESCAPE, correct the problem
and try again.

Select a Color
--------------
If you have one of the supported color printers, select the color that you would
like your border to be printed in. If you have a single color printer, you can
choose any color, but it will have no effect on your printer.

Select a Graphic Type
---------------------
After selecting a border, the next screen asks you to select what type and how
many graphics you want to use on your label. The options are: no graphics; one
single-color; one multi-color; two single-color; or three single-color.
Highlight your selection and press RETURN. Choosing no graphics leaves more room
on your labels for text.

Multi-color Graphics
--------------------
Multi-color graphics are available only on the GS version of Print Shop.
However, they may be used with L.L.L. on any Apple ][ computer.

Select a Disk
-------------
Place a disk with the desired graphic in one of your disk drives and highlight
the correct slot and drive.

Select Graphics
---------------
If you are working with single-color graphics, you can now choose each graphic,
a color, and a position for it. If you are using a multi-color graphic, you can
now choose one and position it.

Select Position for Graphics
----------------------------
For each graphic selected, you can choose a position to print it on the label.
Graphics may be printed on the left, right, or centered.

Select a Text Format
--------------------
Once all the graphics have been selected, you are asked to select a text format
for your label. The choices are: no text, one line of large, two lines of large,
all large. or all small. Highlight your choice and press RETURN.

L.L.L. works with two types of text fonts. "Large Text" refers to Print Shop
fonts. Depending on the size of the font, and the size of the label, L.L.L. will
allow up to five lines of large text. "Small Text" refers to the normal 10
characters per inch font that is produced by your printer. You may have up to 5
lines of small text on your label, depending on the size of the label and the
number of large text lines you select.

Select a Disk
-------------
If you choose to have large text on your label, you have to load a font from
disk. Place the disk with the font you want in one of the disk drives and select
the drive and slot on the screen. A list of fonts on the disk is displayed on
the screen.

Select a Font
-------------
Highlight the font that you want your large text to appear in and press RETURN.
The font is then loaded from disk.

Enter Label Text
----------------
If you choose to have text on your label, your screen now displays a blinking
cursor. You may now type the text that you want to appear on your labels. The
program allows you to use the LEFT ARROW or DELETE key to back up and correct
mistakes. Press RETURN after each line is entered. Press ESC to go back up to
the previous line.

Editing Commands
----------------
Pressing Control-E deletes all text on the line that the cursor is currently on.
Pressing Control-C allows you to choose a color for the current line. Control-P
allows you to position the current line. Lines can be left, center, or right
justified. Lines selected as centered or right justified are not displayed that
way on the screen; however, they will appear correctly on your printed labels.

Position and Color Indicators
-------------------------------
Indicators on the right side of the screen show the current color and position
for each line. Position is indicated by an upper case L, C, or R. Color is
indicated by the first letter of the chosen color, such as "g" for green. Black
is indicated by a blank.

If you choose a large font, the text is displayed in that font. The size of the
label and the size of the font determine how many characters you can get on each
line of the label. The program does not allow you to type in more characters
than will fit on a line.

If you choose one or two lines of large text, there may be room for 4 lines of
small text, depending on the label size. Up to 29 characters can be entered on a
line.

When you have entered all the text to appear on the label, the PRINT MENU is
displayed.


Print Menu


The PRINT MENU allows you to: Preview the Label, Print in  a Single-color, Merge
Multi-color, Print Multi-color, Merge Single-color, Merge Multi-color, Save
Label, Change Printer Setup, or Exit to ProDOS

Preview Label
-------------
When you select to preview the label, a graphic representation of the label is
displayed on your screen. This should give you a rough idea of what the printed
label will look like. The screen display of the label is coarse since the
screen's resolution is much lower than the printer's.

Print Single Color
------------------
Choose this to print your label on a single color printer to in a single color
on a color printer. When you press RETURN, you are asked to select the number of
labels you would like to print. Use the LEFT ARROW key to reduce the number and
the RIGHT ARROW to increase it. Press RETURN when you are ready to print. Make
sure your printer is on and it is selected (online). Press ESC at any time to
stop the printing.

Elements selected to be in color and multi-color graphics are printed using a
gray scale when you choose to print them in single-color mode.

Print Multi-color
-----------------
Choose this option to print labels on a color printer. When you press RETURN,
you are asked to select the number of labels you would like to print. Use the
LEFT ARROW key to reduce the number and the RIGHT ARROW to increase it. Press
RETURN when you are ready to print. Make sure your printer is on and it is
selected (online). Press ESC at any time to stop the printing.

Merge Single-color or Multi-color
---------------------------------
The merge option lets you merge one of your designed labels with information
from an AppleWorks Data Base (ADB) file. L.L.L. uses the AppleWorks Label Format
to print your labels and the Selection Conditions to decide which labels to
print. You must set up the Label Format and Selection Conditions ahead of time.
When you are setting up your Label Format, remember that L.L.L. can print a
maximum of 5 lines per label and 29 characters per line.

Number of Copies
----------------
When you choose one of the merge selections from the Print Menu, you are first
asked to select the number of copies of each label to print. Use the arrow keys
to select the number.

Select Slot and Drive for the ADB File
--------------------------------------
The next screen asks you to select the slot and drive in which your AppleWorks
Database file can be found. Choose the appropriate slot and drive, place the
disk in the drive and press RETURN.

Select ADB File
---------------
Now the list of all the AppleWorks Data Base files on the disk is displayed.
Select the one you want to merge with.

Next, a list of the Label Report Formats for the file are displayed. Choose the
format you want to use and press RETURN. All labels meeting the Selection
Conditions in the Report Format are then printed along with the graph elements
for the labels.

Select Label
------------
Use this option if you have created a label you want to use again or if you want
to merge a database with this label. When you select Save Label, you are asked
to select a slot and drive for the disk to save the label on. The disk must be
formatted for ProDOS. Labels cannot be saved on DOS 3.3 disks. Place your disk
in the correct drive and press RETURN. It takes about 18 blocks of disk space to
save a label.

The screen now displays any labels which have been previously saved on the disk.
The selection "Enter Name For" is also displayed. Choose this selection when you
want to enter a new name to save this label under. You may enter up to nine
characters for the name of the label file. Once you have selected a file name or
entered a new one, L.L.L. saves the label to disk.

Change Printer Setup
--------------------
In order for L.L.L. to work with your particular system, you need to specify
some information about your disk drive and printer. You can do this by selecting
the SETUP option from the PRINT MENU. Once you have gone through the SETUP
option, L.L.L. remembers your choices and you only have to use SETUP again if
your Apple equipment changes. In the SETUP option, you are asked to enter the
following information:

Printer
------
The SETUP program asks you to identify your printer from a list on the
screen. Use the arrow keys to make your selection and then press RETURN. If
your printer type is not shown on the screen, check Appendix C for a list of
printers which are compatible with L.L.L.

Printer Interface Card
----------------------
Select your interface card from the list on the screen. See Appendix D for a
complete list of the interface cards supported.

Printer Interface in Which Slot
-------------------------------
Now you need to select which slot your printer is in. This is usually slot 1.

Exit to ProDOS
--------------
Selecting this option takes you out of L.L.L. and into the ProDos Program
Selector. Your current label will be lost unless you have saved it to disk.


Appendix A


Using Graphics from the Print Shop Disk
-----------------------------------------
Start up your computer with either Print Shop or the Print Shop Companion
Program. Select the GRAPHIC EDITOR Program utility from the main menu. Use
Control-G to get a graphic from the Print Shop program into the editor. Then use
Control-S to save the graphic onto your data disk. The graphic can now be used
with L.L.L.

To transfer fonts or borders from the Print Shop program disk to a data disk,
you must use the Print Shop Companion program. Select either the FONT EDITOR or
the BORDER EDITOR and use the Control-G, Control-S options to transfer the
desired files onto your data disk.


Appendix B


Creating Custom Sized Labels
----------------------------
To create custom sized labels in L.L.L., you must specify the size of the label
in border elements. Each element of a border is approximately one fifth of an
inch wide and 14/72nds of an inch high. The first two screens ask you to enter
the width and height of the label in border elements. The last screen asks you
to enter an adjustment factor which is the number of 72nds of an inch necessary
to line up the next label.

Width
-----
When you choose to create a Custom Size, you are first asked to enter the width
of the label in borders. Each border element is approximately 1/5 of an inch
wide. Multiply the width in inches times 5 to arrive at the number to enter for
the width. So, for a 3" wide label, you would use the arrow keys to change the
number to 15.

Height
------
Now indicate the height of the label by entering the number of borders which
will fit vertically on the label. To calculate this number, measure from the top
of one label to the top of the next label. Multiply this number by 72. Now
divide the result by 14. Enter the integer portion of the result (the part to
the left of the decimal point) for the height. Save the first digit of the
remainder (the first number to the right of the decimal) for the next screen. If
the labels measure 1.5" from top to top, take 1.5 times 72 = 108/14 = 7.7. Enter
7 for the height and 7 for the adjustment.

Adjustment
----------
The next screen asks you to enter the adjustment factor. The adjustment is the
number of 72nds of an inch that the printer needs to move down to start at the
top of the next label. If your labels are not lining up correctly, you can
adjust this number to correct the alignment.

Appendix E

Most problems with L.L.L. can be traced to the printer or printer interface
card. If the printer doesn't do anything or if it prints out garbage, please
follow these steps:

Go back to the PRINT MENU and check the printer setup options.

If everything seems in order in the printer setup, try turning your printer off,
pausing a few seconds to let it clear, and then turning it back on.

LLL v1.3 update

The version 1.3 update contains a simple database program for entering lists
which can be merged with LLL. The database is a BASIC program and can be
accessed by selecting Exit to ProDOS from the Print Menu. Type in /LLL when the
screen displays ENTER PREFIX. Press RETURN. Then type BASIC.SYSTEM and press
RETURN.

Using the LLL Database

A simple database program is inluded on your LLL program disk. It is designed
specifically to be used with LLL. It allows you to enter up to 200 records in a
file. Wach record consists of 4 lines of text (25 characters each) and a sort
key (5 characters).


The Sort Key

The sort key can be used to arrange the database file in any desired order. The
most commom entry for the sort key will be Zip Codes, but you could use the
first five characters of a last name for an alphabetic sort. The sort key will
not be printed on any of your labels.


Using a Data Disk

The program first asks for the location of your data disk. You may select drive
1 or 2 by entering the mumber or you may select a disk or directory by E)ntering
a prefix.


Database Functions

The database program is capable of performing the following functions:

A)dd a record
C)hange a record
D)elete a record
S)earch for a record

When you run the program, any of these functions can be selected from the main
menu by typing the first letter of the command.
    A=)0

Searching

When changing or deleting a record, you are asked to input the record number.
This number changes as you add or delete records from the file. Use the search
function to find the record you want to change or delete. The program uses a
substring search so you don't need to entire name to find a match. A=)0

 -END-
