Weightlifting:
--------------

The Snatch Method-

[] To bend down and grasp the bar, pull the joystick BACK.

[] To begin lifting the bar, push the joystick FORWARD.

[] During the lift, pull the joystick BACK to drop underneath the bar and
"snatch" it over your head.

[] To stand up from the squatting position, push the joystick FORWARD.

[] When two or more judges' lights in front of the platform turn WHITE, pull the
joystick BACk to lower the weights back down to the floor.

The Clean Jerk-

[] To grasp the bar, pull the joystick BACK.

[] To begin lifting the bar, push the joystick FORWARD.

[] During the lift, pull the joystick BACK to "clean" the bar and drop into a
squat with the bar resting on your chest.

[] To stand up from the squatting position, push the joystick FORWARD.

[] To "jerk" the bar above your head, pull the joystick BACK again.

[] To straighten your legs and complete the lift, push the joystick FORWARD one
more time.

[] When two or more judges' lights in front of the platform turn WHITE, pull the
joystick BACK to lower the weights to the floor.

Scoring: The winner is the lifter who successfully lifts the greatest weight. At
least two of the judges must give white success lights for a lift to be
considered successful.  The judges vote on the accuracy of your timing. Two
"hesitant" white votes mean your timing was poor.  Three quick white votes mean
your timing was perfect.

Timing: As the weight increases, timing becomes more critical.  The right moment
to clean the bar to your chest is easy to judge at lower weights, but extremely
difficult as the Clean and Jerk approaches 200kg.  After you clean the bar, wait
the right amount of time to gather your strength for the final lift.  Too short
and the lifter isn't ready, too long and his strength gives  out.  The key to
learning the timing is practice.

Strategy: The key to strategy in weightlifting is knowing when to increase the
weight-and how much to increase it.  Know your limits and those of your
opponents out of the competition-but make sure you can lift the weight before
you take the gamble!

Barrel Jumping:
---------------

[] To choose the number of barrels to jump, move and hold the joystick LEFT  or
RIGHT. Press the FIREBUTTON to continue.

[] Your skater appears on the ice ready to start. Press the FIRE BUTTON to begin
skating.

[] To move the skaters legs, move the joystick LEFT and RIGHT alternating in
rhythm with the movement of his legs.

[] To skate faster, maintain your joystick movements in rhythm with his legs.

[] To jump, press the FIRE BUTTON. The green flag indicates a good take-off
point for most jumps.

[] To prepare for landing, pull the joystick BACK.

[] Each player is allowed three attempts.

Scoring: The winner is the skater who clears the greatest number of barrels in
one of their attempts with a successful landing.

Strategy: Build up as much speed as possible before jumping.  The length of the
jump depends on the speed at take-off. The timing of the jump is also
important. if you jump too soon, you may not clear the last barrel-but if you
jump to late, you may crash into the first barrel.


Cliff Diving:
-------------

[] To select the height of your dive, push the joystick FORWARD or pull BACK
Press the FIRE BUTTON to prepare for the dive.

[] Your diver will appear on the ledge you selected. Press the FIRE BUTTON to
start the dive.

[] To arch your back during the dive, push the joystick FORWARD.

[] Before you enter the water, pull the joystick Back to straighten out and
   complete the swan dive.

[] To avoid hitting the bottom surface under the water, move the joystick LEFT
immediately after entering the water.

[] Each player is allowed three attempts..

Scoring:
Each diver is scored on the style and height of his dive. Smoothly executed swan
dives score the highest style points. The highest scores are obtained with
perfect swan dives from the highest ledge on "La Quebrada,"  while barely
missing the rocks at the foot of the cliff.

Wind:
The wind velocity for each dive is indicated by the length of the arrow at the
top of the screen. The stronger the wind, the longer you must keep your  divers
back arched to avoid the rocks.

Strategy:
The Depth of the water varies as waves go in and out. Try to time  your dive in
order to enter the water at its maximum depth. To achieve a  better score, try
to barley miss hitting the rocks near the foot of the cliff by arching your back
as long as necessary during the dive. Also remember,  that holding the joystick
LEFT,RIGHT,FORWARD,or Back at the time of your leap adds extra velocity in that
direction.


Slalom Skiing:
-------------

[] to start skiing down the course, press the FIRE BUTTON.

[] Control your skier's turns by moving the joystick LEFT or RIGHT to turn in
that direction.

[] Press and hold the FIRE BUTTON as you move the joystick to increase your
speed and turning sensitivity.

[] Complete the course by passing through each gate. A gate is two flags of  the
same color-you must pass between each pair of flags.

[] The gates alternate colors, so you must ski between blue flags, then red
flags. Missing a gate adds a five second penalty.

Scoring: The winner is the skier who successfully completes the course with  the
fastest time. You will be disqualified if you fall. If you collide with a  gate
head on, you'll "wipe-out." Strategy: Sharp turns slow you down. Try to use
moderate turns as often as   you can, timing each turn to position yourself for
the next gate. As you pass through one gate, you should be setting up your
approach for the next gate  down the hill.


Log Rolling:
------------

[] You may compete against another person or the computer.

[] When "Press your Fire Button" appears on either half of the screen, the
player whose name appears on that half must press the joystick FIRE BUTTON
The next player does the same. This begins the event.

[] To move the lumberjack's legs, move the joystick LEFT and RIGHT. Stay in
rhythm with the log or you may lose your balance.

[] To slow the rolling of the log from forward or backward, and change its
direction, press the FIRE BUTTON while running.

[] Each player gets three attempts.

Scoring: The winner is the last lumberjack to remain on the log. A scoring bonus
is awarded to the winner based on the balance of the two contestants. A balance
meter is displayed at the bottom of the screen. You score points whenever your
balance is better than your opponent's. Scoring also depends on  the length of
the event; if you take too long to finish off your opponent,  you'll receive a
lower score.

Balance:
Establish rhythm with your lumberjack's legs; if you don't build  speed at the
correct rate he may lose his balance. The computer keeps balance meter for both
players. When a lumberjack is off-balance, his arms extend to  help him recover.

Strategy:
Make your opponent lose his balance by stopping the log, then  changing the
direction of the log's rotation quickly back and forth. Finish  off your
opponent by rolling the log rapidly n the direction that will cause  him to fall
off.


Bull Riding:
------------

[] To choose which bull you want to ride, move the joystick FORWARD or BACK.
The bulls are named(from easiest to hardest) Ferdinand,Elmer,Bob,Tornado
and earthquake.

[] Press the FIRE BUTTON to start the event.

[] To respond to the bull's movements, move the joystick as follows: BUCK: If
the bull is bucking, move the joystick LEFT or RIGHT, in the direction that
the bull is moving. SPIN: Pull the joystick BACK to stay on the bull when it
is spinning. HALT: Move the joystick LEFT or RIGHT in the opposite direction
that the bull is moving.

Scoring: Scoring is based on the style and length of the ride. The length of  a
ride is eight seconds. Riding harder bulls is worth more points. For  the
highest scores, ride Earthquake..if you dare.

Strategy:
Try to anticipate the bull's moves correctly. Quick response to each move is the
key to finishing a ride. The practice mode allows another player  to control the
bull's actions. Use this to develop a fast response to all of  the moves a bull
can make.

Controlling the bull with the joystick in practice mode:

       FORWARD: 360 Degree spin.
       FORWARD WITH FIRE BUTTON PRESSED: 540 degree spin.
       CENTER JOYSTICK: The bull bucks and runs.
       BACK: THe bull halts suddenly.Guaranteed to throw the toughest hombre.


Caber Toss:
-----------

[] To run with the caber, move the joystick LEFT and RIGHT in rhythm with the
athlete's feet. To gain speed, increase the temp of the rhythm smoothly.

[] To plant your feet and throw the caber, press and hold the FIRE BUTTON.

[] As the caber pivots in your hand, release the FIRE BUTTON to complete the
throw. If you release too soon ot too late, the caber may not flip correct.

Scoring: The caber must flip over completely for a legal toss. The toss that
travels the farthest distance wins the event.

Strategy:
The secret to longest throws is building up your speed before the toss, while
conserving as much energy as possible. The player who learns how  to reach top
speed the fastest will usually win the event. Be careful not to  run any farther
than necessary to build up your speed-long runs with the  heavy caber will sap
your strength.


Sumo Wrestling:
---------------

[] Press the FIRE BUTTON to begin the event and go into the crouch.

[] Control your wrestler by repeatedly moving the joystick as indicated for the
following wrestling moves:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    FOREARM

                        TRIP LEFT    SNATCH    TRIP RIGHT

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[] The computer maintains stamina and balance factors for each wrestler.

[] Release the FIRE BUTTON to let go of your opponent's belt.

[] The first wrestler to leave the ring or touch the ground with any part of
his body but the feet loses the match.

Scoring: Scoring is based on reaction time-both yours and that of your opponent.
The player who can execute moves the quickest will get the highest scores. If
you throw your opponent to the ground or push him out of the ring, you'll
receive enough points to win the match. The shorter the match, the higher the
points.

Strategy:
Timing is important to success in the sumo ring. When you perform a move with
the FIRE BUTTON pressed, be sure to release the button at the proper time to
complete the move successfully. You can learn the timing through  practice. Also
keep in mind that the Utchari is a good strategic move. Try  using it when
you're about to be pushed out of the ring.

[] Silver Medal  =3 points

[] Bronze Medal  =1 point
