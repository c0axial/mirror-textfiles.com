Welcome to NetWorks, a networking environment for ProTALK!  NetWorks supports
the following features...


 o Networking Message Bases
 o Networking Mail
 o Security Modes
 o Checking Modes
 o Macro Functions (v1.1)
 o Configurable Networking Message Bases
 o Many, many, many more features!

NetWorks is constantly expanding, I am already planning regional centers  if
the needs demand, which would mean  the NetWork Bases  would expand and  you
could find possibly a closer NetWork Base or be a NetWork Base yourself!

NetWorks is simple to configure, you must first call The Apple Rebel BBS and
recieve a net  password and  message number.  Please  leave mail  to user #4
once you have been validated on The Apple Rebel BBS  stating you would  like
to participate in the network, with a  voice number I  can reach you  at.  I
will discuss terms of service  (no costs), and give  you a network password,
message number, and board names  in the  network, you may  of course  choose 
which ones you desire.

After these two things have been recieved, run  the program NET.CONFIG  from
the SYSTEM LEVEL [(B)ridge Segments], and answer all online  prompts to  the
best of your abilities.  When it is finished configuring, hit  CONTROL_RESET
and reboot the board.  Networking is now installed, it is all automatic  and
you don't need to do much!


Notice how I said MUCH.  There is one thing you will be required to do. That
is forward any mail sent to you.  The problems I discovered was that I could
not obviously mantain a  global NetWork  user listing,  as replicates  would
start to appear!  Instead, the name of the user  is entered.  The  Networked
mail is sent, if that user does NOT exist on  your board,  the mail is  sent
to you.  The mistake may be due to a typo.  If the user still does not exist
on your board, merely delete the message.  Otherwise you will have to <F>or-
ward your mail towards the correct user.

You are also strongly urged (eg, required) to call the  Apple Rebel BBS  for
updates  to the  segment.  For  the next  few weeks, updates  will be  quite
regular, as there may be bugs, or enhancements to be  made (such  as a  full
macro-type language to allow scripts), and this is  the only BBS these  will
become available.

Thanks for participating in the network, and I hope your users enjoy it!

NetWorks has now evolved, I am currently writing a daisy chain/tree structure
network,  at the suggestion and with the help of Ram Chip.  There will  be an
update to the network, only available at  the Apple Rebel  BBS.  If you  wish
this update, please call the Apple Rebel BBS @ 916/457-0624.  Thanks for your
