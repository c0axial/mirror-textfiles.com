                                DATA ENTRY
 
 Data can be entered in label or value form.  A Label consists of text used for
 headings and other static information on the worksheet.  A Value consists of
 numbers and formulas.  While entering data you may press [Escape] or
 [Closed Apple][Escape] to return to Ready mode.  Pressing [Return] will post the
 entry to the worksheet.  Edit mode is entered if an error is detected while
 keying data.
 
 
 Labels:
 
 A label is initiated using a letter, a label prefix or an otherwise unused
 punctuation mark.  A label prefix adds special meaning to the label, or allows
 characters usually used as values to be used as labels.  The Worksheet Global
 Label-prefix and Range Label-prefix commands control defaults.
 
    The Label prefixes are:     '  Left justified     "  Right justified
                                ^  Centered           \  Repeating label
 
 Values:
 
 A value is a cell entry which contains the numbers, operators, cell references,
 and functions fundamental to your sheet.
 
 The characters which begin a value entry are:
 
        0-9, ., +, -, (, @, #, and $.
 
 The commands available which set the display format for values are
 /Worksheet Global Format and /Range Format.  Specification of a variety
 of cell layouts is possible.
 
 A Formula may consist of the above values and operations including cell
 references and @functions.  They are covered further in the next section.
 
 A Formula may consist of values and operations including cell references and
 @functions.  Examples are: 3+B7, @sum(D2..D9), @MAX(T3,B4^7).  The rules for
 calculation are as follows:
    1. Parenthesized groups are calculated first.
    2. An order of precedence takes place among operators.  This means
        operands of operators of higher precedence are evaluated first.
    3. All else being equal, operators are taken from left to right.
 Plus and minus signs should ideally be used to begin each formula.
 
Operator     Function       Precedence     Operator    Function    Precedence
   ^       Exponentiation       1             <>     Not Equal         5
   -       Negatation           2             >      Greater Than      5
   +       Make Positive        2             >=     Greater or Equal  5
   *       Multiplication       3             <      Less Than         5
   /       Division             3             <=     Less or Equal     5
   +       Addition             4             #NOT#  Logical Not       6
   -       Subtraction          4             #AND#  Logical And       7
   =       Equals               5             #OR#   Logical Or        7
 
 
 Edit mode is entered when an error in data entry is detected, when you decide
 to edit an entry, or when you are prompted for information.
 
 To edit a cell, select the cell and then select edit, either by pressing [Open
 Apple] [2] or by clicking on the Status Line in the Control Panel.  When you
 do this, the entry will appear on the Edit line with the cursor at the end of
 the entry.
 
 There are several commands which can be used in the edit mode:
 
            [Closed Apple][Up]      First character of entry
            [Closed Apple][Down]    Last character of entry
            [Open Apple][Right]     Move 5 characters right
            [Open Apple][Left]      Move 5 characters left
            [Right arrow]           Move 1 character right
            [Left arrow]            Move 1 character left
            [Delete]                Erases character before cursor
            [Open Apple][Delete]    Erases character under cursor
            [Escape]                Cancels editing of entry
            [Open Apple][9]         Changes formula to result

 Macros are user-programmed commands created with key sequences.  Values,
 labels, functions or commands may be included.  For example:
 
        '/wcs15~
 
 changes the column-width of the current cell to fifteen.  /X commands give you
 the ability to program VIP Professional.
 
 Auto-execute macros are built by attaching the macro to the digit zero.
 Each time you reload the worksheet, the macro is automatically executed.
 
 Entering macros:
 1. Construct the macro in an empty worksheet cell starting with a label-prefix.
 2. Name it with Range Name Create, using [Backslash] and a letter, e.g.: \Q.
 3. Use it by pressing [Open Apple] and letter of macro, e.g.: [Open Apple][Q].
 
 Keyboard commands are entered in macros enclosed in braces as shown:
 
    {Up}........Up one cell             {Down}......Down one cell
    {Right}.....Right one cell          {Left}......Left one cell
    {Home}......Move Home               {End}.......Move to End of data
    {PgUp}......Pages up                {PgDn}......Pages down
    {Del}.......Deletes                 {Esc}.......Escape
    {Bs}........Backspaces              {Edit}......Edit function
    {Name}......Name function           {Abs}.......Absolute function
    {GoTo}......Express function        {Window}....Window function

    {Calc}......Recalculate function    {Graph}.....Graph function
    {?}.........Pauses for input until [Return] is pressed
     ~...........[Return]
 
 To use Single-step mode, press [Open Apple][Shift][1]. Press any key to advance to
 next step.  To stop Single-step mode, press [Open Apple][Shift][1].
 
 /X Commands:
  /XI(condition)~             Uses if-then condition
  /XG(location)~              Goes to a location and continues macro
  /XC(location)~              Goes to a location and calls subroutine
  /XR                         Returns from subroutine.  Used with /XC
  /XQ                         Quits macro execution
  /XM(location)~              Displays and processes a user-defined menu
  /XL(message)~(location)~    See /XN
  /XN(message)~(location)~    Displays prompt in the control panel, accepts a
                              label or number from keyboard & puts it in location
 
 
 Ranges are specified using an anchor and a free cell.
 Ranges are always rectangular in shape.
 
 With movement keys:
    1. Move the cell indicator to the start cell of the range and press [.].
    2. Move the cell indicator to the end cell.  Use any movement key.
    3. Enter the range.
 
 Explicit addressing:
 Type the cell address of the anchor cell.  Type [.] then the address of
 end cell.  Enter the range.
 
 With Range Names:
 In response to a command prompt, type in a range name.  Press [F3] to
 choose from a list of existing range names.
 
 
 Changing the Start Cell:
 
    Press [.] to rotate the start cell to the next corner
    in a clockwise direction.
 
 [Delete], [Escape] and [Closed Apple] [Escape] may be used during range
    creation to backstep the process.  [Escape] "unexpands" the range and
    returns to the anchor cell. [Delete] unexpands the range and returns
    to the current cell.  [Closed Apple][Escape] ends ranging.
 
 
 These commands are used to rearrange your worksheet once some data has been
 entered.  Copy duplicates the contents of one cell or range to others and is
 useful for proliferating data through the sheet.  Move rearranges sheet data.
 
 bels and formulas.  Copying labels or plain
 values is the most straight forward.  First a "From" (source) range or cell is
 specified followed by a destination "To".  It is important to note that Copy
 erases the previous contents of the cell. When copying formulas you should
 be aware of absolute, relative and mixed cell addresses.  If you use an
 absolute cell address the formula is transferred to the new cell still
 referencing the same locations.  With a relative cell address the formula
 values change according to their new location.  Mixed cell addresses in a
 formula are a combination of absolute and relative references.  The absolute
 part of a mixed cell address remains the same and the relative part changes.
 
 Move transfers the contents of a cell or range to a new location.  Moving cell
 entries is just like picking them up from one location and placing them at
 another.  Remember the destination will be overwritten.  These are powerful
 commands and should be used with care.
 
 
    The menu is organized in a hierarchy of commands.  Start by typing [/].
    Menu commands may be chosen by either using the arrow keys then
    [Return] or by typing the first letter of a selection.  To retreat
    to the previous menu level press [Esc].  To exit directly type
    [Closed Apple][Escape].  The Professional's most powerful commands are
    accessed through the menu tree.

 File Names and Disk Prefixes:
 
 VIP stores files by combining the prefix specified in the Worksheet Global
 Default Directory command with pathname entered.  To save a file to another
 path ignoring the default prefix, precede the filename with a slash '/'.
 For example, /Budgets/Data saves the file DATA.WKS to the volume /Budgets
 ingoring the default prefix.  Filenames may consist of letters and numbers.
 
 Three types of files are created: Print, Graph and Worksheet.
 When a file is saved, a file name extension of the appropriate type is added.
 A file ending in ".prn" contains printer ready information, ".gph" a graph,
 ".wks" a worksheet.
