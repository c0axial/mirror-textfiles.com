 Introduction
..............


     In This Intro, I Will Simply But
Briefly Emphasize On D.D.D's Primary
Features. Dalton's Disk Disintegrater
1.0 Malfunctions With Catsend 3.0 For
Known Reasons. Following Several Tests
On This Matter, Dalton Spotted A Huge
Error In Catsend (Every Version) That
Would Not Enable DDD 1.0 Compressed
Files To Be Successfuly Transmitted
Over The Phone Line. Therefore Dalton
Recently Modified DDD 1.0 To Function
With Catsend, Despite The Ugly And
Nasty Bug That Contaminates It!
DDD 1.2 Is Identical To The Original
1.0 Version, Although Version 1.2 Is
Now Fully Compatible With Catsend.
Refer To -> Dalton Disk Disintegrater
1.2 Documentation For More Information
Concerning This Topic.


     Obviously This New DDD ][ Version
Has Been Modified To Perform Properly
With Catsend. So Please Do Not Hold Any
Grudges Against It. Version ][ Has Been
Beta-Tested Over And Over, Resulting
To Our Expectations (Pretty Awesome!)



..................

 Primary Features
..................


     Here Are The Primary Features
Dalton's Disk Disintegrater ][ Will
Have To Offer You:

o This Second Version Was Designed
  With 64k Of Memory In Mind.
  DDD And Your Extra 16k Go Hand
  In Hand To Offer You Some Pretty
  Awesome Advantages.

o DDD Packs & Unpacks Programs Very
  Fast.  Unlike Disk Rigger 2.0, which
  Consumes Too Much Time.

o 85 Percent Of All Programs Will
  Entirely Compress In 2 Drive Passes
  Only! [For 64k Systems!!]

o Squeezes Every Bit Out Of Your Extra
  16k Of Ram, To Enable Maximum Speed
  And Minimum Disk Access.
  [For 64k Systems!!]

o Autochecks For 64k Of Memory On Boot.
  If Not Present, Will Configure Itself
  To A Standard 48k System.

o DDD ][ Contains A Perfected,
  Powerful And Flawless Crunching
  Algorithm Which Utilizes Every
  Packing Technique In Order To
  Achieve Maximum Data Compression.

o Amazingly Compresses Any Program
  Into Only 1 Super File!!

  Example:    *B 248 SUPER ZAXXON<248>

  Instead Of: *B 135 SUPER ZAXXON.00
              *B 135 SUPER ZAXXON.01
              *B 060 SUPER ZAXXON.02

o Arrow Driven Commands. This Allows
  Swift Access To All The Options.

o Dos Commands. This Permits You To
  Access Important Dos Commands From
  Within The Program Without Having
  To Exit Then Reenter Once Again.

 Menu Options
..............


[1]Pack
[2]Unpack
[3]Source:1  Target:2
[4]Catalog drive 1
[5]Catalog drive 2
[6]Dos commands
[7]Boot drive 1

[PACKING A DISK] - OPTION 1

o Enter Any Filename You Wish The
  Superfile To Occupy.

o Maximum Filename Length Is 25
  Characters Long.

o Make Sure Your Target Disk Has
  Sufficient Disk Space For The
  Packed Version.

o Your Target Disk Needs At Least
  200 To 300 Free Sectors Before
  You Begin The Pack. Otherwise
  A Disk Full Error May Result!
  Use Option [6] From Main Menu,
  (Dos Commands) To Either Format
  Your Target Disk Or To Delete
  Useless Files On It.

o When Packing, Make Sure The Filename
  You Use Is Not One Identical To A
  Filename On Your Target Disk. And If
  So Delete Or Rename That File Before
  Attempting The Pack.

o If A Disk Full Error Does Occur While
  Packing, DDD Will Obliterate Whatever
  Packing It Has Achieved And Leave The
  Exact Diskspace Your Original Target
  Disk Occupied Before The Pack Was
  Executed.

o If You Have Formatted A 40 Track
  Disk And Wish To Use It As A Target
  For The Pack, Go Ahead.
  DDD Supports 40 Track Capabilities,
  Which Means It Will Write On A 40
  Track Preformatted Disk (There Is
  No Need To Use A 40 Track DOS).
  If DDD Detects A 40 Track Disk,
  It Will Write On The Extra Tracks
  Only If Necessary.



[UNPACKING A DISK] - OPTION 2

o When Unpacking A Disk, The Source
  Is The Disk With The Compressed
  File And The Target Is The Disk
  You Wish To Merge Onto.

o Your Target Disk (Merge Onto)
  Doesn't Necessarily Need A
  Preformatted Disk. It Will
  Automaticaly Initialize Your
  Target Disk Before Commencing
  Decompression.

o When Entering The Filename You
  Wish To Unpack, Do Not Include
  The < Less Than Sign, XXX (Where
  XXX Is The Sectors) And > Greater
  Than Sign Following The Filename.
  Only Enter The Bare Filename And
  DDD Will Do The Rest.

  Example Enter:SUPER ZAXXON
   Do Not Enter:SUPER ZAXXON<248>



[SOURCE:1  TARGET:2] - OPTION 3

o This Option Will Permit You To
  Configure Your Drive Setup In The
  Manner You Wish! To Change The
  SOURCE Disk, Press "1" For Drive #1
  Or Press "2" For Drive #2 (Or You Can
  Hit RETURN).  Same Process To
  Configure The Target Disk.
  DDD ][ Predefines To Support 2 Drives
  (SOURCE:1  TARGET:2).

o Obviously Few Cycles Of Changing
  Disks Must Occur If You Only Have
  A One Drive System. Therefore DDD
  Will Adjust Itself To Tell You
  When To Insert SOURCE And When To
  Insert TARGET Disks.



[CATALOG DRIVE 1] - OPTION 4

[CATALOG DRIVE 2] - OPTION 5

o These Options Were Added To DDD
  Because They Are So Oftenly Used.
  Catalog Your Disks When You Are
  Unsure Of Filenames.

o Following The Directory, The Free
  Sectors Remaining On The Disk Will
  Be Illustrated For Your Convenience.

o If You Only Have One Drive, Option
  5 May Be Quite Useless To You.



[DOS COMMANDS] - OPTION 6

o This Option Was Added As Well Because
  Of Great Demand. Many Irrelevant DOS
  Commands Were Omitted.
  Here Is A List Of Accessible DOS Cmds:
  (XXX Symbolizes The Chosen Filename)

=> INIT XXX
=> DELETE XXX
=> LOCK XXX
=> UNLOCK XXX
=> RENAME XXX,YYY
=> CATALOG,DX
=> PR#X
=> IN#X

[BOOT DRIVE 1] - OPTION 7

o This Option Is Quite Useful Once
  You Have Terminated To Unpack A
  Program. You Simply Insert The
  Unpacked Version Into Drive 1 (Slot
  6 Only!) And Watch Her Boot Up...



.....................

 The Track Indicator
.....................


o Instead Of Useless Twirling
  Cosmetics Appearing On The
  Screen While DDD Is Active,
  Dalton Chose To Add A Rather
  Complete Track Status Indicator
  Oftenly Found In Bit Copiers.

o Here Is A Complete Legend Of
  The Abbreviated Significations
  Used On The Status Line:

=> MEMORY  :  48k Or 64k

Determines The Amount Of Random
Access Memory Your Apple Can Provide.


=> DRIVE   :  1 Or 2

Highlights The Drive Presently Active.


=> LEN     :  XXX Sectors

Displays Amount Of Sectors The File
Actually Contains. The LEN Gradually
Accumulates As The Packing Or Unpacking
Goes On, Until It Has Reached Its Final
Limit Or Maximum.
LEN Abbreviates LENGTH (Sector Wise).


=> TK      Abbreviates Track
=> ST      Abbreviates Status

=> R       R)eading A Track
=> W       W)riting A Track
=> C       C)ompressing A Track
=> D       D)ecompressing A Track

=> I       I)nitializing All Tracks
           The 'I' Is Illustrated
           Simutaneously As DDD ][
           Formats Each Track.

=> .       Displays A Decimal Point
           On Each Individual Track
           Once It Has Successfuly
           Been Read/Compressed Or
           Decompressed/Written.



.................

 Various Details
.................


o Ctrl-A Toggles UPPER/Lower Case.
  (Press Ctrl-A From Main Menu)

o Ctrl-K Prints Open Bracket: [
  Ctrl-L Prints Backslash: \

o XXX Equals Sectors. The <XXX> Printed
  At The End Of The Packed Filename Was
  Added Because Some DOS'S CATALOG Wrap
  Around The Sector Counter To 0 When
  A File Exceeds The Limit Of 256 Sect.
  Therefore Many Files Will Seem Too
  Small. So Just In Case, A Backup
  Counter Was Added At The End Of Each
  Compressed Filename In Order To
  Identify The Correct File Length.

o Hitting ESC From Anywhere Within
  DDD Will Return You Directly To
  The Main Menu Prompt.

o DDD ][ Will Fully Operate In Slot X.
  Therefore, BRUN DDD ][ From Any Valid
  Slot Number, Appending Drive 1 Or 2.
  All The Options From The Main Menu
  Will Work Properly Once DDD Has Been
  BRUN'ed From A Different Location
  Other Than Slot 6, Drive 1 (Note:
  You Must Press CTRL-RESET Once, From
  The Main Menu).

  Example: BRUN D.D.D. ][,SX,D1
  Or     : BRUN D.D.D. ][,SX,D2
  X Equals The Prechosen Slot Number.


o In Order To Tell DDD ][ Apart
  From DDD 1.0 And From DDD 1.2,
  Verify The Last Characters Of The
  Compressed Filename:


[Dalton Disk Disintegrater 2.0]

  SUPER ZAXXON<248>

  Notice How DDD 2.0(New Version)
  Compresses The Program Into Only
  1 File! Also Note That There Are
  Always 3 Digits In The <XXX>.


[Dalton Disk Disintegrater 1.0]

  SUPER ZAXXON<0>
  SUPER ZAXXON<1>
  SUPER ZAXXON<2>

  DDD 1.0(Old Version) Very Rarely
  Compresses A Whole Program Into
  1 File. Notice There Is Only 1
  Digit In The <X>.


[Dalton Disk Disintegrater 1.2]

  SUPER ZAXXON<<0>>
  SUPER ZAXXON<<1>>
  SUPER ZAXXON<<2>>

  Notice The <<X>> At The End Of The
  Filename. Version 1.2 Is A Slightly
  Modified DDD 1.0 In Which It's Now
  Fully Compatible With Catsend.
  Now You Can Tell All Three Versions
  Apart When Unpacking Files.

 Comparing Results
...................


o Dalton And I Have Done Several
  Comparisons Between DDD ][ And
  Disk Rigger 2.0. In Every Case,
  DDD Defeated Rigger In Both Speed
  And Packing Tests. Therefore We
  Are Quite Convinced That No Other
  Present Disk Compresser Can Surpass
  DDD's Overall Qualifications.
  As For Other Disk Crunchers Like,
  Compact It 1.0 And Disk Slicer,
  We Didn't Bother Comparing Statistics
  Because Next To DDD ][, Disk Rigger
  Performed The Best.

o I've Included A Sector/Speed Test
  Chart That Compares DDD And Rigger
  Back To Back. The Main Objectives
  Of These Tests Are To Simply Point
  Out That DDD Is More Versatile And
  Convenient To Use Especially For
  Ae/Catsend/Catfur Sysops.

 Beta Tests
............


     DDD Has Gone Through Several
Tests And It Has Performed Flawlessly.
Here Is A List Of Tests DDD Has
Successfuly Passed:

o DDD Operates Fine With Any DOS.
  Such As Diversi Dos, Pronto Dos,
  Hyper Dos, Original Dos, Etc..
  I Suggest That You Don't Use David
  Dos Because The Init Command Was
  Purged From That Operating System.
  We Suggest That You Use Pronto Dos.

o DDD Operates Fine On Any Apple ][,
  ][+, ][e, ][c, Apple Compatible
  (48k or 64k), With Either 1 or 2
  Disk Drives Online.
  There Was An Error In The Original
  DDD 1.0 Which Made The Apple ][e
  Inoperatable With 1 Drive Because
  The ][e's Monitor ROM Differs From
  The Original Apple ][ or ][+'s ROM.
  DDD ][ Now Operates Perfectly With
  1 or 2 Drives On The Apple ][e.

o We Have Transfered DDD Packed Files
  Over The Modem Using Almost Every
  Transfer Program.
  DDD Compressed Files Transmit Fine
  With Every X-fer Program With The
  Exception Of Catsend 3.0. When The
  Compressed File Exceeds 256 Sectors,
  Catsend Crashes (Bug In Catsend...).
  Therefore Catsend Will Work Fine
  Under The Condition That The DDD
  Compressed File Doesn't Exceed
  256 Sectors!

  The Authors Of Catsend Will Have
  To Make Certain Modifications To
  Their Catsend Program In Order
  To Enable Files Exceeding 256
  Sectors To Transmit Properly.
  Hopefully They Will Release A
  New Good Working Version Soon!

o The Following Transfer Programs
  Check Out Perfectly With DDD ][:

   /
o\/   ASCII EXPRESS (AE)
      [V3.0 - V4.0 - V4.2]
   /
o\/   DOS FILE EXCHANGE (DFX)
      [V2.0 - NEW V2.0]
   /
o\/   CATSEND (Applecat X-fer Program)
      [ALL VERSIONS ON CONDITIONS]
   /
o\/   DISKFER (Applecat X-fer Program)
      [V1.0 - V2.0]
   /
o\/   CAT-FUR (Applecat X-fer Program)
      [V1.1 - V2.0]



............

 Conclusion
............


o I Hope This Tutorial Has Helped
  You Make The Change From Disk
  Rigger 2.0(Absolete!) To DDD ][.


o DDD ][ Was Written Especially For
  AE/CATSEND/CATFUR Sysops Who Kindly
  Donate Their Computer Systems To
  Maintain Massive Software Piracy.
  (You're Welcome Dudes..)

o Special Thanks To The Micron
  For His Radical Catfur ][.
  Catfur Is A Major Breakthrough
  In Transfer Programs And Surely
  Enriches Pirates All Over North
  America.

o We Urge All Catsend Sysops To Make
  The Switch To Catfur ][. It's A
  More Reliable, Faster, And Very
  User Friendly Transfer Program!
  (It Works Very Well With DDD ][...)
  Catfur Compares With Commercial
  Transfer Programs Such As:
  Ascii Express And D.F.X. ][!
