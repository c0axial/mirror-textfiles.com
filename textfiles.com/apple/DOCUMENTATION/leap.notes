Programs that work under Leapfrog

SnowTerm(1)
Acer
the Finder
Music Seq Maker(2)
SHR Convert(3)
AWGS
Sonic Blaster Demo (From AE)
DiCeD

(1) Snowterm works just fine but the Snowterm default files must be in the
directory that leapfrog is in. Also, when you shell back into Snowterm, you
no longer have ANY menus on the menu bar.

(2) Music seq maker doesn't work with sequences (of course because the 
tool set isn't loaded)

(3) Works fine but program comes up with messed up color table.  If you load
a picture and then click, the normal color table is restored.

Programs that do not work under leapfrog

Tml Pascal 1.5A and II.  They will load perfectly but they somehow take over
and will not allow you to shell back out.
Any text based GS/OS applications (De-Arc)
320 Mode games

Some programs seem dependant on what order they were loaded.  DiCeD and 
Fontasm seem to perform much better if they are loaded first or second.  The finder
seems to be able to be loaded at any time, as with Acer and SHRConvert.
