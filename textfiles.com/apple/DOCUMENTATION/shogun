Preface to the Story
====================

         In Shogun,  you  play  the role  of resourceful English seaman
      John Blackthorne, Pilot-Major of the Dutch trader-warship Erasmus,
      which is  on a  secret  mission  of  trade  and plunder  to  the
      Spanish-dominated Pacific Ocean.
         The year is 1600, and  the powerful  Catholic empire  of Spain
      and  Portugal is  locked  in a death struggle  with the  upstart
      Protestant nations  of England and Holland.  The Catholic nations
      have spread  their political and  religious influence across the
      world, reaching as far as  China and the almost mythical land of
      Japan,  extracting great  wealth in  spices and precious  metals.
      Their extensive knowledge of  the Asian seaways is highly  secret
      information coveted by  English and Dutch traders. But while the
      European powers battle each other, a longer and even more vicious
      struggle is raging among the feudal lords of Japan.
         After hundreds of years of anarchy,  Japan was unified  by the
      great warrior  Nakamura,  was Taiko,  or  military ruler. But the
      Taiko  has  died,  leaving as  heir a  seven-year-old boy,  and a
      five-man Council of  Regents to  rule in his  name. The dominant
      figures on the Council are Lord Toranaga and Lord Ishido. Each is
      a daimyo:  powerful warrior-rulers who follow the ancient samurai
      traditions. Each harbors the ambition to be Shogun: supreme ruler
      under the divine but nearly powerless Emperor.
         Toranaga  and Ishido are  each  backed  by lesser daimyos and
      hordes of  samurai.  They  jockey  for  position, nearly  evenly
      matched, looking for any way of bolstering their chances. Perhaps
      the Jesuits will  swing their  support behind  one candidate,  or
      hostages  will  neutralize a powerful  supporter. The balance is
      delicate, and the appearance of the Eramus creates excitement and
      new possibilities.
         It is  into the  center of  this momentous conflict that  you,
      John Blackthorne, have been thrown, and soon you discover that the
      perils of the sea are  almost trifling  compared to the danger and
      intrigue among the samurai loards of Japan.
         Life in  Japan can be  a hazardous  affair. If  you choose  the
      wrong friends of confidants,  you may find your head detached from
      your body.  But strict  adherence to the rules of etiquette,  some
      judicious  questions,  and  careful  listening  will enhance  your
      pleasure, prestige, and prospects for survival.
         Shogun is one of a new family  of Infocom stories which utilize
      vivid graphics to  enhance the  story.  So  now, along  with  the
      quality  interactive  fiction  that  you've  come  to expect  from
      Infocom, you can  also expect beautiful  artwork  as well.  You'll
      find that the art in Shogun is  tied very closely to the story and
      gives you  a "fine-focus"  on the mood or  locale as you  play the
      role of John Blackthorne.

Hints
=====

         Shogun  contains on-screen  hints!  If you ever get stuck, just
      type HINT and follow  the instructions on  your screen.  The hints
      generally progress from a gentle nudge to a complete answer.
         Don't  let the  presence or  absence of  hints on a particular
      subject affect your thinking.  In fact, fake hints have been added
      to prevent this.
         We strongly recommend that you look at only one hint at a time.
      Avoid the temptation to use  the hints too often; this inevitably
      spoils,  or  at  least  lessens,  the  fun of  solving a solving a
      puzzle.
         If you don't have the  will power to stop  looking at the hints
      you can type HINTS OFF.  This will deactivate  the on-screen hints
      (unless you RESTART or RESTORE to an earlier point).

=============
Function Keys
=============

         As described  elsewhere  in this  manual,  many commands have
      abbreviations:  you can type N instead of NORTH, for instance, or
      I instead of INVENTORY.
         With  function keys,  you can  use a  single keystroke  as an
      abbreviation for whatever you choose.  You can use a function key
      to  abbreviate  a  long  word  that  you  don't  to type   (like
      TORANAGA),  or  to  abbreviate  a  commonly  used command  (like
      RESTORE),  or even to  abbreviate a whole sentence (like LOAD THE
      PISTOL).
         The 10 user-defined functions (F1-F10) are accessed by holding
      down the Closed Apple/Option key  and simultaneously pressing the
      number key (1-0) which  corresponds  to the  function you want to
      use. The arrow  keys  have also  been  defined  as function keys.
      Initially, they are defined as  the four cardinal directions. You
      may, however, change them also. Please  note that  the left arrow
      key is defined as WEST and cannot be user as a backspace key.
         You  start the  story with  the function  keys already set to
      commonly used commands.  To see what the function keys are to, or
      to change the  settings of the function keys,  type DEFINE at the
      prompt {>} and press  the RETURN key.  Then  use your mouse or up
      and  down  arrow  keys to  highlight the  setting(s) you  want to
      change. The vertical bar {|} or exclamation point {!} is  used as
      an abbreviation for the RETURN key automatically pressed when you
      use  that function key.  Note: Only one RETURN can be included in
      each function  key  definition.  Anything  typed after the first
      RETURN will be discarded.
         You can restore all the original settings of the function keys
      by highlighting  the  RESET DEFAULTS  command  and pressing  the
      RETURN key. You can save any changes you make by highlighting the
      SAVE DEFINITIONS command.  If after  saving your  own definitions
      you wish to RESET DEFAULTS, or save a new set of definitions, you
      may retrieve your previous  definitions save by highlighting the
      RESTORE DEFINITIONS command and pressing the RETURN key.
         To leave  the DEFINE screen,  highlight the  EXIT command  and
      press the RETURN key.

================
Special Commands
================

         Below  are  explanations  for  a  number  of useful  one-word
      commands. In many cases, these will not count as a move. Type the
      command after the prompt {>} and press the  RETURN key.  Most  of
      these commands  appear in all  Infocom games, but those  that are
      starred (*) are new.

AGAIN

        - This repeat your previous input. For instance, typing TURN THE
          WHEEL TO PORT  then  typing AGAIN  would be  like turning  the
          wheel to port twice in a row. You can abbreviate AGAIN to G.

 BRIEF

        - This command  tells Shogun  to fully  describe a location only
          the first time you enter it. On subsequent visits, Shogun will
          tell you  only the  name of the  location in BRIEF mode,  and
          remain in BRIEF mode unless  you use the VERBOSE or SUPERBRIEF
          commands.  SUPERBRIEF tells Shogun to display only the name of
          a place  you have  entered,  even if you have never been there
          before.  In  this  mode,  Shogun will  not even mention which
          objects are present. Of  course,  you  can always get a  full
          description  of your  location and  the items there by typing
          LOOK.  SUPERBRIEF mode  is meant for  players who are already
          familiar with the geography.  The VERBOSE command tells Shogun
          that you want a complete description of each location, and the
          objects in it,  every time  you enter it,  even if you've been
          there before.

 *COLOR

        - If you are playing Shogun on a computer with a color  monitor,
          you  can  type  COLOR to  change  the colors  of the  text and
          background  on  your  screen.   This  command works  only  on
          computers which support a color display.

 *DEFINE

        - This command allows you to change the settings of the function
          keys. See the "Function Keys" section above.

 DIAGNOSE

        - Shogun will  give you  a  report  of Blackthorne's (ie: your)
          physical condition.

 *HINT

        - If you have difficulty while playing the story, and you can't
          figure  out  what  to  do, just  type  HINT.  Then follow the
          directions at the top of your screen to read the hint of your
          choice.

 INVENTORY

        - Shogun  will list  what Blackthorne  is carrying and wearing.
          You can abbreviate INVENTORY to I.

 LOOK

        - This  give  you a full description of your location.  You can
          abbreviate LOOK to L.

 *NOTIFY

        - Normally  in Shogun,  the  game will not notify you when your
          score changes.  You can turn on  this notification feature by
          using the  NOTIFY command.  Typing NOTIFY a second time turns
          the feature back off.

 OOPS

        - If you  mistype a word,  such that Shogun  doesn't understand
          it, you  can correct  yourself at  the next prompt by typing
          OOPS and the  correct word.  For example, if you typed ATTACK
          THE NINAJ WITH THE SWORD  and  were  told  "[I don't know the
          word 'ninaj']" you could type OOPS NINJA rather than retyping
          the entire sentence. You can abbreviate OPPS to O.

 QUIT

        - This lets you stop.  If you want to save your position before
          quiting,   follow  the  instructions  in  the "Starting  and
          Stopping" section below. You can abbreviate QUIT to Q.

 *REFRESH

        - This command clears your screen and redraws the display.

 RESTART

        - This stops the story and starts it over from the beginning.

 RESTORE

        - This restores a previously saved position. See "Starting and
          Stopping" below for more details.

 SAVE

        - This puts a  "snapshot" of your  current position on you save
          disk.  You can return to a saved position in the future using
          the  RESTORE  command.  See "Starting and Stopping" below for
          more details.

 SCRIPT

        - Tells your printer to begin making a transcript of the story.
          A transcript may aid your memory,  but is not necessary, and
          will work only on certain computers.

 SCORE

        - This command  will  show  your current  score and a ranking
          which is based on that score.

 SUPERBRIEF

        - Tells  Shogun to give  you the  sparest level of description.
          See BRIEF above.

 *UNDO

        - You can use this command to "back up" one move. Suppose, for
          example,  that  you found  a package  but didn't know what it
          was. You might type OPEN THE PACKAGE and be told "The package
          explodes  as you open  it,  destroying all your possessions."
          You could then type  UNDO,  and you would "back up" one move.
          Your possessions would  be intact, and  you could try giving
          the package  to an enemy, or leaving  it alone, or something
          else.

 UNSCRIPT

        - This tells your printer to stop making a transcript.

 VERBOSE

        - This  command  tells Shogun  too give you  the wordiest level
          of description. See BRIEF above.

 WAIT

        - This causes time in the story to pass.  Since nothing happens
          until you type a sentence and press RETURN,  you could take a
          nap,  eat  dinner, then  return  to the  story to find  that
          nothing has changed.  You can use WAIT  to make time  pass in
          the story without doing anything. For example, if you saw two
          soldiers arguing, you might WAIT to see  what they'll  do; if
          you were  aboard a ship,  you might WAIT to see where it goes.
          You can abbreviate WAIT to Z.

Sample Transcript
=================

         This transcript is not from Shogun,  but will give you a good
      feeling for how Infocom's interactive fiction works. It contains
      some simple  puzzles and their  solutions. The player's commands
      appear in capital letters after each prompt {>}.

>LOOK
You are at the helm of the tradeships Dek Twintig, about to make port in Goro.

>LOOK AT THE SEA
The sea is as calm as the day is beautiful. The sails are full and the brisk
wind moves the ship along at a quick and steady pace. Directly to port lies
the barrier reef which makes Goro an ideal harbor, sheltered from the
relentless battering of the sea and safe from easy enemy attack.

>LOOK AT THE REEF
The reef is to port, marked by a line of churning surf and broken two hundred
yards ahead by the mouth of the winding channel that leads to the anchorage in
Goro Harbor. The Dek Twintig is running before the wind parallel to the reef.

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel is ahead and to port, marked by red and green buoys; red buoys
mark the channel's left side and green buoys mark the right side.

>WAIT
Time passes...
From atop the mainsail in the crow's nest you hear the lookout yell, "Coming
up on the channel now."

>TURN THE WHEEL TO PORT
You turn the wheel to port and the Dek Twintig slips into the channel.

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel surrounds you on both sides, about twice as wide as your ship,
with red and green buoys marking its boundaries. Beyond the buoys lie shallow
water, rocks, and disaster. The channel bends to starboard about three hundred
yards ahead.

>WAIT

Time passes...
The ship moves deeper into the channel propelled by the stiff winds.

>WAIT
Time passes...
The ship moves deeper into the channel propelled by the stiff winds. The ship
seems to be moving away from the center towards the left side of the channel.
You hear the lookout yell excitedly, "Approaching red buoy dead ahead!"
Startled, you look to the left for the buoy but it's too late because you've
just left the channel and run aground. Luckily, you're on a sand bar, and not
the rocks.

>UNDO
(UNDO done)

>TURN WHEEL TO STARBOARD
You quickly turn the helm to starboard just avoiding the red buoy. The Dek
Twintig responds, veering back towards the center of the channel.

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel surrounds you on both sides about twice as wide as your ship. The
ship seems to be veering off to the right side of the channel. You remeber
your recent close call as you hear the lookout yell, "Green buoy sighted,
Captain!"

>STRAIGHTEN WHEEL
You quickly straighten the wheel and the ship immediately centers herself in
the channel.

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel surrounds you on both sides, about twice as wide as your ship. The
lookout yells, "Channel turning starboard, Captain."

>TURN THE WHEEL STARBOARD
You turn the wheel to starboard, expertly following the center of the channel.

>STRAIGHTEN THE WHEEL
You straighten the wheel holding the Dek Twintig to the center of the channel.
The lookout yells, "Anchorage dead ahead, Captain."

>LOOK AT THE CHANNEL
The channel surrounds you, about twice as wide as your ship. The channel opens
up into Goro bay about two hundred yards ahead.

>WAIT
Time passes...
You enter the harbor under full sail, a tribute to English seamanship. The
anchorage is just a hundred yards away now.

>CREW, LOWER THE SAILS
The crewmen, who had been taking in the first sight of Goro, snap to and
scurry up the riggings and smartly lower the sails and the Dek Twintig coasts
majestically to the anchorage. You notice a small boat being launched from the
shore and heading your way.

>TELL THE FIRST MATE TO LOWER THE ANCHOR
Seersucker orders three men forward to lower the anchor. Presently, you hear a
splash and first part of your voyage is complete. The small boat is getting
closer.

>LOOK AT THE BOAT
The small board, now coming up beside the Dek Twintig, is manned by a crew of
twelve. They are dressed in strange but beautifully wrought clothing. Some of
the men look like warriors.

>SEERSUCKER, LOWER THE LADDER
With the help of Hornung and Shalle, Seersucker lowers the ladder over the
side.

>WAIT
Time pases...
Four heavily armed men board the ship and position themselves around the top
of the ladder. After a few moments a fifth man climbs the ladder. His manner
and dress set him apart from the others, he is obviously their superior.

>INVENTORY
You are carrying official letters of introduction from the Dutch government, a
sword, and a box containing a present to the people of Goro from Prince
William of Orange. You step forward to address the leader. Immediately the
four armed men jump forward, drawing their swords. You quickly step back.

>BOW TO THE LEADER
The leader takes a much more relaxed stance. His guards relax but eye you
warliy.

>GIVE LETTERS TO THE LEADER
You hand the letters of introduction to the leader. He looks at them but
doesn't comprehend their meaning.

>GIVE THE BOX TO THE LEADER
The leader takes the box and opens it. Inside is a globe of Europe and Japan
outlined in precious stones. The leader runs his hand over the European
portion of the globe letting it come to rest on the purposely unadorned
country of Spain. You feel uncomfortable with his choice of resting place.

>WAIT
Time passes...
The leader closes the box and speaks to one of the guards. The guard goes to
the side of the ship yells down to the men remaining in the small boat.
Another man, obviously of Spanish decent, climbs the ladder and boards the
ship. Eyeing you suspiciously, he approaches and introduces himself. "I am
Dario Glaz. This man," he points to the leader, "is Admiral Sukata, commander
of the port of Goro. He wishes to know who you are?"

>I AM CAPTAIN WICKS
Upon hearing your name, Glaz becomes livid with rage, turns to Admiral Sukata
and anxiously says something to Sukata. Instantly, Sukata yells something to
his men and then to Glaz. The guards on deck come to a fighting posture while
those remaining in the small boat begin to scurry up the ladder. Glaz faces
you and says, "Captain Jeremiah Wicks, I hereby place you under arrest in the
name of Admiral Sukata for the crime of piracy." As he speaks the guards move
towards you.

>I AM NOT A PIRATE
The guards continue their advance. Your crew is not sure what to do.

>I AM CAPTAIN ALEXANDER WICKS
You hurriedly explain to Glaz that Jeremiah Wicks is your half-brother, a
scrourge to your family and an enemy of England and all nations. He turns and
speaks once more to Sukata, Sukata listens intently then orders his men to
stop.

=====================
Starting and Stopping
=====================

         On  your  screen,  you will  see  a description  of the opening
      location of the story, Bridge of the Eramus, followed by the prompt
      {>} indicating that Shogun is waiting for your first input.
         Here  are  a few  inputs for  you to  try at  the first  several
      prompts. After  typing each  input, don't forget  to hit the RETURN
      key.

>INVENTORY
>TAKE THE WHEEL
>SIT IN THE CHAIR
>TURN THE WHEEL TO STARBOARD

         You should now  have a feel  for interacting with the story. You
      decide what to do next.
         Saving and restoring:  It will  probaly take you several days to
      complete Shogun. Using the SAVE feature, you can continue the story
      at a later time  without having  to start over  from the  beginning,
      just as you can place a bookmark in a book you are reading. Even if
      you aren't about to stop  playing, it's  useful to SAVE  before (or
      after) trying something dangerous or tricky.  That way, even if you
      get  lost or "killed"  in the story,  you can  return to your saved
      position.
         To save your place, type SAVE at the  prompt {>} and  then press
      RETURN.  Using a disk with data on it (other than for Shogun saves)
      may result in the  loss of that  data, depending  on your computer.
      You can save your position as often as you like by using additional
      blank disks.
         Any  time  you want to  return to a  saved position,  just  type
      RESTORE at the  prompt {>}, and hit  RETURN. You can then continue
      the story from your save.
         Quiting  and  restarting:  If you  want to start over from  the
      beginning, type RESTART and press the RETURN key. (This is usually
      faster than  re-booting.) Shogun  will  ask  you  to confirm  this
      command. If you want to stop entirely,  type QUIT and press RETURN.
      Once again, Shogun  will ask  to make sure this  is really what you
      want to do.
         Remeber: when you RESTART or QUIT, you must SAVE if you want  to
      return to your current position in the story.

===================
Interactive Fiction
===================

         In Shogun, you type your commands in plain English each time you
      see  the  prompt  {>}. Most  of  the  sentences  that Shogun  will
      understand are imperative sentences. See the examples below.
         When you have finished  typing your input, press the RETURN key.
      Shogun  will  then respond,  telling  you  whether your  request is
      possible at this point in the story, and what happened as a result.
         Shogun recognizes your words  by their first nine letteers,  and
      all subsequent letters are ignored.  For example, Shogun would not
      be able to distinguish between  DEMONSTRAtion, DEMONSTRAtive,  and
      DEMONSTRAtor.
         To  move  around,  just  type  the  direction  you want to  go.
      Directions can be abbreviated:  NORTH to N, SOUTH to S, EAST to  E,
      WEST  to W,  NORTHEAST  to NE,  NORTHWEST  to NW, SOUTHEAST to SE,
      SOUTHWEST  to  SW, UP  to U, and DOWN to D. IN  and OUT and  PORT,
      STARBOARD, FORE and AFT will also work in certain places.
         Shogun understands many different kinds of sentences.  Here  are
      examples,  using  objects  and  characters  that don't necessarily
      appear in Shogun:

>WALK TO THE NORTH
>WEST
>NE
>DOWN
>TAKE THE APPLE
>OPEN PANEL
>READ THE RUTTER
>LOOK AT THE COMPASS
>TURN WHEEL TO PORT
>LIFT THE SWORD
>TEAR THE CLOTH
>STEER TOWARD BAY
>GIVE THE CHOPSTICKS TO THE WOMAN
>CLIMB INTO THE PIT

         You may use lower-case letters  and words  like A and THE  if you
      wish. Shogun doesn't care one way or the other.
         You can use  multiple objects with  certain verbs if you seperate
      them by the word AND or by a comma. Some examples:

>TAKE THE PISTOL AND THE BAG
>DROP THE SWORD, THE COMPASS, AND THE TOWEL

         You can  include several  sentences on  one line if you seperate
      them by the word THEN or by a period.  Each sentence will be handled
      in order,  as though  you had  typed them individually  at seperate
      prompts. For example, you could type all  of the following at  once,
      before pressing the RETURN key.

>TAKE THE ROPE. GO UP THEN TURN THE WHEEL TO PORT

         If Shogun doesn't understand one of  the sentences on  your input
      line, or if an unusual event occurs, it will  ignore the rest of you
      input line.

         The words IT and ALL can be very useful. For example:

>EXAMINE THE APPLE. TAKE IT. EAT IT
>CLOSE THE HEAVY METAL DOOR. LOCK IT
>TAKE THE KIMONO. PUT IT ON
>TAKE ALL
>GIVE ALL BUT THE PISTOL TO THE PRIEST

         The  word  ALL  refers  to  every  visible  except object  those
      inside something else.  If there were an apple on the cabinet and an
      orange inside the cabinet, TAKE ALL would take the apple but not the
      orange.

         There are various kinds of  questions  that  Shogun understands.
      Examples include: WHO IS {someone}, WHERE IS {something or someone},
      and WHAT IS {something}. For example:

>WHO IS TORANAGA?
>WHAT IS A SAMURAI?
>WHERE IS OSAKA?

         When you meet other  people in  Shogun,  you can talk to  them by
      typing  their name,  then a comma,  then whatever you want to say to
      them.

>PRIEST, HELLO
>YABU, TELL ME ABOUT THE PLAN
>MARIKO, GIVE ME THE DAGGER

         Sometimes Shogun "knows" you mean  to answer a question posed by
      another  character. In  these situations you  can omit the name and
      comma.  For  example if Mariko  asked, "What's you favorite color?"
      you could answer.

>YELLOW

         You can also ask questions of characters by  using the form  ASK
      {someone} ABOUT {something}. For example:

>ASK OCHIBA ABOUT THE SAMURAI
>ASK OMI ABOUT ISHIDO
>ASK YABU ABOUT THE PLAN

         Keep  in mind,  however,  that most  people don't care for idle
      chatter,  you should listen to  others and answer their questions.
      Often your actions will speak louder than your words.

         Shogun tries  to guess your  intention when you give incomplete
      information. When it makes a guess, it will tell you. For example:

>UNLOCK THE DOOR
{with the key}
The door is now unlocked.

         If you command is ambigiuous.  Shogun will ask you to clarify.
      You can answer  these questions  simply by  supplying the  missing
      information at the very next prompt. For example:

>GIVE THE PROCLAMATION
Who do you want to give the proclamation to?

>THE QUEEN
The queen smiles as she accepts your gift.

Tips for Novices
================

         1. Draw a map.  It should include each location, the connections
      to adjoining locations,  and any interesting objects there. Remeber,
      there  are  10  possible  directions   (NORTH,  SOUTH, EAST,  WEST,
      NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, UP AND DOWN) plus IN and
      OUT, PORT, STARBOARD, FORE and AFT.

         2. EXAMINE all objects you come across in the story.

         3. TAKE as  many things as  you can carry. Most objects that you
      find are important for solving the puzzles that you'll run into.

         4. SAVE your place often, so that if you mess up or get "killed",
      you won't have to start over from the beginning.

         5. Read  the  story  carefully! There  are  often clues  in the
      description of locations and objects.

         6. Try everything  you can  think of. Even  strange or dangerous
      actions  are fun and  may provide  clues: you can always save your
      position first. Here's a silly example:

>GIVE THE BROKEN COMPASS TO TORANAGA
Toranaga scornfully refuses your offer. He continues to look in the bushes for
his dagger.

         Thus,  you discover that  maybe giving something else to Toranaga
         (perhaps your dagger?) might be better.

         7. There are many  possible routes to  the end  of Shogun. If you
      get stuck on one puzzle,  move on to another. Some puzzles have more
      than one solution;  other  puzzles  don't need to  be solved  at all.
      Sometimes you will have to solve  one puzzle in order to  obtain the
      item(s) or information you need to solve another puzzle.

         8. Play Shogun with a friend! Different people may find different
      puzzles easy and can often complement each other.

         9. If you really  have difficulty,  you can type HINT. The screen
      will then show you a list of  questions to which you can get answers.
      (Simply follow  the instructions at the top of you screen to see the
      hint of your choice.) You  don't need to  use the hints to enjoy the
      story, but it will make solving the puzzles easier.

         10. Read  the  sample  transcript  above  to  get a feel for  how
      interactive fiction works.

         11. You can  word a command  in many different ways. For example,
      if you  wanted  to  stop  the  ship,  you could  type in any of the
      following:

>DROP THE ANCHOR IN THE WATER
>THROW THE ANCHOR IN THE WATER
>PUT ANCHOR IN WATER

         If you  type a  sentence  that Shogun  doesn't understand,  try
      rephrasing  it  or   using  synonyms.   If  Shogun still  doesn't
      understand,  you're probaly trying  something that isn't important
      for completing the story.

Common Complaints
=================

         Shogun  will complain  if your input  confuses it completely.
      Shogun  would  then  ignore any further  sentences on your input
      line. (Certain events,  such as attack, will also cause Shogun to
      ignore  any  additional sentences  on your input line, since the
      event  may have  changed your  situation drastically.)  Here are
      some of Shogun's complaints:

{I don't know the word _________.}

         That word is not in the story's vocabulary. It may help to use
      a synonym  or rephrashing  the command; more  likely, you're just
      barking  up  the  wrong  tree.  Shogun  uses  many words  in the
      descriptions that  it will  not recognize in your inputs. So, you
      might read,  "The moon  casts violet  shadows across the crater,"
      but discover that Shogun doesn't know the words MOON or SHADOW or
      CRATER in your input.  When this happens, you can assume that you
      don't need  to refer to those  things to complete the story; they
      are there only to create a more vivid image of your location.

{I think there's a verb missing in that sentence!}

         Unless you are answering a question, each sentence must have a
      verb (or  one of the special  commands). Among the most important
      verbs  that Shogun  understands are TAKE,  DROP, PUT, GIVE, LOOK,
      READ, EXAMINE,  OPEN, CLOSE, ENTER, EXIT, EAT and WEAR. There are
      many more.  Remeber,  you can use a  variety of prepositions with
      your verbs. (For  example, LOOK can  become LOOK AT, LOOK INSIDE,
      LOOK BEHIND, LOOK UNDER, LOOK THROUGH, and so on.)

{I can't understand that many nouns with ________.}

         Shogun recognized  your verb, but it  can't understand so many
      noun "phrases"  with it.  For example, Shogun  may recognize SKIP
      but not SKIP THIS PART.

{You can't see any _________ right here!}

         The object  you refered to is not visible. It may be somewhere
      else, or it may be present but in a closed container.

{You can't use more than one object at a time with _________.}

         You can use multiple objects  (that is, nouns or noun phrases
      seperated by AND  or a comma)  or the word  ALL only with certain
      verbs, such as TAKE, DROP, and PUT. For example, EXAMINE will not
      work  with  multiple  objects;  you  couldn't  say EXAMINE ALL or
      EXAMINE THE BOWL AND THE SWORD.

{There isn't anything to __________!}

         You  used the  word ALL,  but  there  aren't  any appropriate
      objects visible.

{Sorry, but I don't understand. Please that another way, or try something
else.}

         The syntax  (sentence structure)  you used  is not among the
      hundreds of  syntaxes that  Shogun recognizes. For example, SIT
      UNDER THE TREE  and  SKIP AROUND THE MAYPOLE  are syntaxes  that
      Shogun wouldn't recognize.  There's a limited amount of space in
      the  program,  so syntaxes  that are less  common or not  useful
      aren't included. Try rephrasing the sentence.

{I beg your pardon?}

         You pressed the RETURN key with typing anything.
