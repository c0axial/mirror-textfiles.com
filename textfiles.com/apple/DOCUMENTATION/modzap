MODZap is the ultimate in MOD players for the Apple IIgs.  It offers full
support for 15 and 31 instrument MOD files used by the Amiga programs
NoiseTracker, ProTracker, and StarTrekker.  It plays these files on any
speed Apple IIgs using pitchbend and other special effects programs like
NoiseTracker IIgs just dont give you.  And unlike NoiseTracker, it runs
under GS/OS and uses the friendly desktop interface you already know how
to use.  Its also fully compatible with the new System 6.0 (in fact it works
better with 6.0!).

To use MODZap, just run it.  Load time should be practically instantaneous
since its a < 7k application.  Once you have a menu bar up, load a MOD,
any MOD, including ones NoiseTracker GS chokes on.  As with MODifier, you
must guess if the MOD is 31 or 15 instrument.  Start by trying 31, as most
MODs are of this type.  If the program hangs or crashes, try 15 instead.
To play, pull down the Sound menu and select Play MOD.  The Not-So-Scrolly
Player will appear before your eyes.  To end playback, simply press the
Open Apple key on your keyboard.  The song will repeat forever if you do
not stop it.

If you run into any MODs which MODZap does not play correctly, tell me!
