The Mixed Defense
=================

     The Mixed Defense does not rely on any one class of armor or artillery;
instead, it is built around a varied armor force.  Like the GEV-centered
defense, the Mixed defense calls for initial intercept forces to slow the
invading Ogre.  Once the Ogre is slowed, though, the Mixed defense adopts
aunique attack style of its own.  The Mixed defense's flexibility allows it to
throw a variety of weapons at the Ogre simultaneously.
     Typically, defensive actions start with a group of GEVs attempting to
shoot away about one thired of the Ogre's tread sections (the "slow the Ogre"
phase of the attack).  The first wave(s) of FEVs are backed up by a mixed
force of heavy tanks (placed closer to the Combine lines) and missile tanks
(placed closer to the CP).  This mixed force is very flexible and can attack
both the Ogre's weapons systems and its tread sections.  Finally, the "front"
mixed force is backed by an additional "rear" mixed force, typically formed of
missile tanks, missile howitzers, and infantry (some commanders choose
additional armor vehicles in lieu of howitzers).  The "rear" mixed force
surrounds the Command Post with a protective ring of fire, and does its best
to stop and/or disarm the (presumably) badly damaged Ogre as it lumbers toward
the Command Post.  
     The precise strategy of the "rear" mixed force is to some extent
determined by the condition of the Ogre as it draws close to the Command Post.
If the Ogre has few tread sections remaining, the "rear" force can attack the
Ogre's weapons first, and then attack tread sections at the penultimate
moment.  Most typically, the Ogre arrives with few weapons remaining, but with
a (fairly) healthy complement of tread sections intact.  In this case, the
"rear" force throws almost all its firepower at Ogre tread sections,
addressing Ogre weapons later on.
     The Mixed Defense relies on the same principle which makes the GEV
defense work; namely, striking the Ogre with a greater level of fire than the
Ogre can return.  The GEV defense accomplishes this goal by using fragile but
fast vehicles which can fire on the Ogre and then escape beyond its range. The
Mixed defense accomplishes this goal by using all available units which may
vary in defensive firepower and firing range.  Just as the GEV defense forces
the Ogre to decide which group of GEVs to pursue, the Mixed defense forces the
Ogre to decide which types of vehicles to pursue.  The main idea is to force
the Ogre to make so-called "no-win" decisions, and to hit the Ogre with
crippling fire in the process.
     Key Points:  Many of the comments made about the Howitzer-and
GEV-centered defenses apply for the Mixed Defense.  We menion a few specific
items the Mixed defense commander must watch.
     Early Attack:  It is very important to slow the Ogre before it crosses
too deeply into the Conflict Zone.  The Mixed defense is in some ways more
sensitive to this problem than the GEV defense.  If the Ogre runs into your
"front" mixed force at full speed, there is a real possibility that it will
sweep past your heavy tanks and then win the "footrace" to your Command Post.
Placement of the "front" mixed force is critical.  If the force is placed too
far forward (toward Combine lines), your first wave of interceptors will not
have enough time to slow the Ogre.  If your "front" mixed force is placed too
far to the rear (toward your Command Post), you will miss valuable
opportunities to make the Ogre pay for every one of its forward movements.
Experienced commanders try to arrange the firrst, second, and third wave
forces so that the Ogre is under continuous attack (i.e., there are absolutely
no moments of respite for the Ogre).
     Middle Attack: it is important to keep your "front" and "rear" mixed
forces truly mixed.  While we do not fully understand the Ogre's attack
algorithms, we believe the Ogre usually had a harder time dealing with varied
types of vehicles as opposed to clusters of identical vehicles (GEVs
excepted).  The Mixed defense derives much of its flexibility from striking
the Ogre simultaneously with short and long range weapons.  Don't lose this
advantage when you don't have to.  Be wary of Ogres which seem to break off
their attack and instead maneuver diagonally across the Conflict Zone.
Experience has shown that this is often an Ogre ploy calculated to draw out
your forces. separating them into groups of fast, faster, and fastest
vehicles.  Once the Ogre separates your force into distinct classes of
vehicles, it has a much easier time methodically eliminating one class of
vehicle at a time.
     Final Attack: As mentioned under other defense sections, above, you must
have a keen sense of timing to know when to begin your all out drive to
immobilize the Ogre.  Infantry are again required to play a critical, and
sadly, self-sacrificial role in shooting away Ogre tread sections.  As the
Ogre closes on your Command Post, you must make sure that your infantry squads
are in correct position to intercept the Ogre.  We remind you once again that
a disarmed but mobile ogre is a deadly weapon!
     Comments: The Mixed defense is effective against both Mk III and Mk V
Ogres. Of the "classic" defense schemes mentioned here, the Mixed defense is
probably the easiest for an inexperienced commander to master.  This is true
mostly because the Mixed defense offers extra flexibility in selecting targets
(at the mid-point of an invasion, both Ogre weapons and tread sections are
suitable targets), and because the mixed armored force tends to help the
commander recover from (small) tactical mistakes.

[============================================================================]

Basic Strategy
==============

     This manual addresses the particular type of cybertank mission where a
single "Ogre-class" cybertank invades an Alliance-occupied Conflict Zone on
its own.  In such a mission the cybertank's prime directive is to eliminate
the Conflict Zone Command Post.  As a secondary priority, the cybertank should
strive to eliminate all (or almost all) Alliance ground forces.  As a final
priority, the cybertank should return to a friendly service center after
clearing the Zone.
     Given these priorities, the cybertank's basic strategy revolves around a
deceptively simple question:

     "How should the cybertank destroy the Alliance Command Post?"

     The cybertank's attack algorithms must continuously review and reassess
this question as the attack proceeds.  Ultimately, the cybertank's options
will be to take the Command Post either by firing weapons or by ramming the
Post directly.  But this is a complex decision, a decision the cybertank can
make only in the later stages of its attack.
     Experience has shown us a potential problem.  Cybertanks can sometimes be
diverted from their primary goal (destruction of the Command Post) if they are
offered enough enticing opportunities to pursue secondary goals (e.g.
destruction of Alliance ground forces).  While reaching secondary goals is
important, pursuit of secondary goals must never prevent the cybertank from
fulfilling its prime objective.  As you prepare cybertanks for combat
missions, we suggest you install strong "initiative refocusing" blocks which
prompt the system to look again and again at the unit's primary objective.
This should help keep the cybertank focused on the task at hand.

Assessing Alliance Defenses
===========================

     Alliance defense strategies are as numerous and varied as are our own
attack plans, However, experience has shown that Alliance defense strategies
usually fall into three fairly distinct categories.  We describe these
categories below.  We believe these descriptions will be useful for you as you
refine the cybertank's pattern-recognition and strategy-planning algorithms.

Howitzer-Centered Defense
=========================

     Basic Characteristics:  Howitzer-centered defenses arrange three or more
Howitzers as a protective screen shielding an Alliance Command Post, and are
arranged so that their circles of fire overlap.  This overlap creates a broad,
deep area which the cybertank can penetrate only by exposing itself to
concentrated fire.  The theory is that the cybertank will lose all of its
weapons and most of its mobility (or vice versa) as it struggles to break
through the howitzer line.  Although the cybertank will eventually knock out
the howitzers, it will be so badly damaged in the process that it will become
easy prey for Alliance ground forces.
     Response Strategy:  The cybertank should determine early on if
howitzer-centered defense is being used.  If so, the cybertank has several
options.  One of the best is to enter the Zone only part way, then to spend
time moving laterally, thus drawing out Alliance mobile ground forces.  The
key here is to deal with mobile armor units while they are outside of the
howitzer defense circle (if possible).  Once a number of mobile units are
eliminated, the howitzers' "ring of fire" becomes much easier to penetrate.
     The cybertank must study the arrangement of the howitzers, probing for
weak spots.  In some cases, for example, the cybertank can all but bypass a
howitzer defense simply by taking a roundabout route to the Command Post.  If
there are no apparent weak spots, the cybertank should, all other things being
equal, strive to attack whichever howitzer appears to form the cornerstone for
the entire line.  The attack should be as simple and direct as possible,
minimizing the cybertank's exposure to fierce howitzer fire.

GEV-Centered Defense
====================

     Basic Characteristics:  In a GEV-centered defense, the defending
commander may well select GEVs as the only armor units he places in the field.
Even if he adds other types of units for balance, GEVs will be the dominant
element of his defense.  The case for the GEV-centered defense is nearly an
inverse of the argument for the howitzer-centered defense.  The howitzer
defense relies on tightly concentrated fire coming from a small number of
stationary units; the GEV defense relies on broadly distributed fire coming
from a large number of extremely mobile units.
     At the start of a typical defensive "scramble," GEVs make individual "hit
and run" attacks on cybertank treads (with perhaps a few joint attacks on main
batteries).  In theory, this approach enables GEVs to overwhelm the cybertank
with their superior speed, movement range, and numbers.  The intent is to
trade off a few GEVs early on for a dramatic and swift cutback in the
cybertank's mobility.  If the cybertank can be slowed.  GEVs and infantry have
much more time to stop the cybertank (and attacks will be safer since the
damaged cybertank can't give pursuit).  The GEV defense is based on the
assumption that GEVs can attack cybertanks and then escape to positions of
safety.  As we shall see, this assumption is not always sound...
     Response Strategy:  The cybertank has the advantage of knowing where GEVs
are stationed before deciding where to enter the Conflict Zone.  If possible,
use this advantage to enter the Zone at a point where GEV coverage is thin.
Once under attack, the cybertank must maneuver to cut off and eliminate small
groups of fleeing GEVs.  This may entail lateral (or even reverse) movement
for the cybertank.  This is one situation where it is unwise for the cybertank
to press straight toward the enemy's Command Post.  Instead, a zig-zag pattern
enables the cybertank to trap fleeing GEVs before they can turn around to make
repeat attacks.

Standard Defense
================

     Basic Characteristics:  The standard Alliance defense deploys an even
blend of different types of armor along with infantry.  Typical forces to
commit against a single Mk III cybertank might include: 20 Sqauds of Infantry,
2 Howitzers, 2 Heavy Tanks, 2 Missile Tanks, and 4 GEVs.  The standard defense
is very flexible, and enables the Alliance commander to resist the cybertank
in several ways.  The defense can be optimized to target either cybertank
treads or weapons.  The standard defense is perhaps the most difficult for the
cybertank to "read," since the defense permits Alliance Commanders to mask
their intentions until the last moment before their units close on the
cybertank.  If skillfully managed, a standard defensive force can bring
numerous types of weapons to bear on the cybertank simultaneously.
     Response Strategy:  Our cybertanks do quite well against the standard
defensive force provided only part of that force is engaged at any given
moment.  It is often useful for the cybertank to play a waiting game, using
some lateral movement to draw the Alliance's faster units forward.  The main
idea is to string out Alliance forces across the length of the Conflict
Zone.  In this way, the cybertank can tackle separate groups of armor rather
than attempting to forge its way straight through a highly concentrated group
of armor units.  As the cybertank encounters small groups of armor, it should,
where possible, take the added precaution of "sideslipping" past the edges of
the groups.  The sideslip maneuver helps keep the cybertank from being
trapped, and helps ensure that the cybertank will arrive at the enemy Command
Post with adequate mobility and firepower in reserve.

Entry to the Conflict Zone
==========================

     Alliance commanders almost always locate Command Posts at the rear edge
of the Conflict Zone, near the Center.  Thus, to minimize travel distance
across the Zone, and to permit greater flexibility of movement within the
Zone, the cybertank should usually enter from a central location.  There are a
few exceptions to this rule.  Some Alliance Commanders run the standard
defense by placing both their Command Post and the bulk of their defensive
forces in a rear corner of the Conflict Zone.  When facing forces deployed in
this way, the cybertank might benefit from entering the Zone at the opposite
front corner of the Zone.  In this case, an entry from the opposite corner
tends to lure Alliance forces away from their strong position near the Command
Post.

Use of Missiles
===============

     Because missiles are the most powerful and longest range weapons in the
cybertank arsenal, many AI programmers instruct cybertanks to hold at least a
few missiles in reserve to handle contingencies arising late in the attack.
On an intuitive level this strategy makes sense, but recent combat analysis
by Combine intelligence indicates that the strategy simply does not work.  In
far too many cases, missiles are destroyed without ever leaving their
launching tubes.  Thus, the latest Combine doctrine holds that missiles should
be held back only so long as the cybertank's "conventional" guns are able to
handle nearby Alliance armor units.  In all other cases, the missiles should
be treated like any other weapon in the cybertank arsenal, and should be used
as needed.  This does not mean that missiles should be used haphazardly (e.g.,
to attack a single squad of infantry).  It does mean that missiles can and
should be used on a wide range of appropriate targets (e.g., to destroy
Command Posts, or to eliminate Howitzers or armor units blocking the
cybertanks path).  Over a century ago, the first builders of nuclear weapons
said it best: "Use 'em or lose 'em."

Use of Terrain
==============

     Since both Mk III and Mk V cybertanks are free to move over all but the
most difficult land surfaces, most AI programmers give little attention to
terrain (apart from avoiding such obvious hazards as full-size bomb craters
and swamps).  To be blunt, this is a mistake.  While terrain does little to
affect the cybertank, it does affect the cybertank's enemies (in particular,
very few vehicles can cross huge piles of battlefield rubble the way a
cybertank can).  In many cases, the cybertank can use rubble or bomb craters
to block pursuit from Alliance armor units.
     Some AI programmers send cybertanks along the very edges of impassable
areas.  The theory is that, in following this path, the cybertank can be
attacked from one side only.  This approach carries some merit.  However,
recent Combine combat analysis shows that the "edge" movement is not a good
solution.  The cybertank must trade freedom of movement for (relative) safety.
The tradeoff is not a good one.  We suggest you program cybertanks to search
for travel paths which lie somewhere between the center and the perimeter of
the Conflict Zone.
