Ever wish you could whip up a super looking Icon?
Ever see a graphic on your SHR screen that you would like to have as an Icon?
What!, you say you can't draw worth a darn......
Well, there's hope yet.....   Instant Icon NDA will allow you to mark off
part of the SHR screen and save it as an Icon. Just open the NDA, hold the
mouse down to start marking off, and release the mouse when done.
Fill out the attribute box, pick a filename, and that's it. Instant Icon.
The Icons you save will load into an Icon Editor, or can be used right away.


Tips:

Icon pathnames can be up to 64 characters long. You will only be able to view
about 40 characters in the Instant Icon attribute box. You can keep typing, but
you will only be able to view the first 40 or so characters.

You can "Capture" images from a 320 mode screen. Instant Icon will convert the
colors to 640 mode.

Icons are displayed in the standard palette. If you create an Icon from a
screen that is not in the default palette, it will usually look pretty sad...


Instant Icon will allow you to mark off approx a 70x70 square, although, you
could make a rectangular Icon. Square Icons usually look the best, and not too
large. Large Icons tend to clutter up the desktop.

This is version 1.2 of Instant Icon, the first release. If you have any
