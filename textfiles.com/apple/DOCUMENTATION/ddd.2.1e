The History of Packing:
----------------------

     In the beginning, most Apple programs were single files.  In those days,
all pirates had to do to upload and download programs was to call up an AE
line and send the program across.  But as software became more sophisticated,
programs began to require full disks.  To send an entire disk just could not
be done with AE!  So pirating software had to get more sophisticated to keep
up with the new programs.  At that point, the Stack (of Corrupt Computing)
wrote his first Disk Splitter, which was a program that split a full disk into
a sector map and 1-6 binary files.  This made it possible to upload a full
disk with AE by first splitting it, then unsplitting it back to its original
state after downloading.  Although this program ignored unused sectors, it did
no data compression.  Thus began the succession of programs that ultimately
led to Disk Disintegrator ][.1 Enhanced.
     Disk Splitter worked, but it was unfriendly and the files it created took
up a lot of disk space.  It was followed by a number of similar programs which
began to use various data compression methods.  First there was Disk Rigger 1.0
and the its modifications (none of which were successful). Although it did
compression and some fancy tricks, it simply did not work. Other programs were
Disk Slicer by the Rocker and Disk Divider by M. Hata. Disk Rigger 2.0 was the
next widely accepted program after Disk Splitter, but it had been the standard
for only a short period when Dalton came out with his revolutionary Dalton's
Disk Disintegrator 1.0.  This program had a bug when working with ][e's with
one drive, so DDD 1.1 was released.  Because its data compression techniques
created files which were smaller than those of any other splitting/packing
program, Dalton's set a new standard which lasted for quite some time.  The
better the compression, the less space was required to store the split files
and the faster they could be transferred.  Then a challenger invented a new
technique: instead of splitting a full disk into several binary files, it
combined these files into one long file.  Dalton incorporated this idea into
his next major revision: DDD 2.0.  DDD 2.0 had another big bug.  It would not
compress a disk if the end of track $22 was blank (the most common reason being
a TSL on that track).  The bug was fixed in DDD 2.1, which is the current
standard.  Everyone is happy with this version--unless you own a hard drive,
and can not use your volumes conveniently.  To correct this problem, the Shadow
wrote a program called Disk Cruncher (current version 1.1) which is a nice
program (much like Dalton's in many respects), that has light-bar file
selection and volume support, but a less efficient packing routine. The next
entry into the field was Krackerjack's Fireworx.  Krackerjack has shown his
programming expertise through Krackerjack's Autograph, but his packer simply
doesn't stack up against Dalton's in speed, data compression, and reliability.
It took about six and a half minutes to unpack a fairly full disk, and the disk
in question did not work after unpacking!
     Finally, then, we are up to the present moment, as The Assembly line
proudly unveils:  Disk Disintegrater ][.1 Enhanced.  The screen has vaguely
the same look as Dalton's Disk Disintegrater 2.1, but the only internal
similarity is the incredibly efficient packing packing algorhythm written by
Dalton.

Actual Docs:
-----------
     At the main menu, the available options are displayed.  Most of these
will require no explanation.  Others will be briefly explained.

OPTION 1: Pack a disk.  This will create a single file version of the disk you
          wish to send over the phone.  It will be compatible with Dalton's 2.1
          file, and follow the same naming format (i.e. Filename<XXX>).

OPTION 2: Unpack a disk.  After selecting this option, you will be shown a
          portion of the Catalog on the disk in the source drive (as many files
          as will fit on the screen).  A light bar can be moved up and down
          until you reach the file you wish to unpack.  If there are more files
          than can be displayed on the screen, the message "[more]" will be
          displayed above and/or below the files on screen to indicate the
          location of the remaining files.  When you reach the file, hit
          [RETURN] and the file will be unpacked.  Hitting ESC will bring you
          back to the main menu.

OPTION 3: Catalog a disk.  After selecting this option, select the drive to
          Catalog.  Free space will be displayed at the bottom.

OPTION 4: Format a floppy disk.  You may initialize the target disk using this
          option.

OPTION 5: Change the source and target disks.  These default to slot 6, drive
          1, volume 000.  If these are satisfactory, no changes will be needed.

OPTION 6: Reconfigure.  This option will allow you to configure DDD 2.1E to
          your own needs.  Here is where lower case can be disabled, and more
          importantly, the buffer size can be changed.  The default size for
          the buffer is the maximum memory available (unless previously
          configured to a different size).  There are two main reasons for
          changing the buffer size.  The first is that, if your DOS is residing
          in the language card, you will not want to use the language card's
          memory, or DOS will be overwritten, and you will have a headache
          instead of a packed disk.  The second, real reason for this option is
          to allow people with Siders to disable auxiliary memory.  We can hear
          the Sider owners chanting in unison, "Why would I want to do
          something like that?" Unfortunately, since no one donated a Sider to
          the Assembly Line, we can not figure out a way to make DDD 2.1E work
          with both a Sider and auxiliary memory. If you wish to donate a Sider
          or information on how to make it work, see the number at the bottom
          of this doc.  Remember: if you wish to use DDD 2.1E and a Sider, you
          MUST disable auxiliary memory.
          Note:  After re-configuring DDD 2.1E, if you save it to disk, it MUST
                 be saved to the same disk it was loaded from.

OPTION 7: Reboot.  You must reboot to leave the program, since DOS has been
          clobbered.  After selecting this option, you can either boot from the
          source or target slot (it will always boot from drive 1).  This is
          convenient if you wish to boot your hard drive instead of your floppy
          drive.

Error Codes:
-----------

     Since DOS is not active, if a DOS error occurs, instead of receiving a DOS
error message, you will receive an RWTS error.  Here is a summary of the error
codes and what they mean:
                          Error #:    Cause of error:
                          -------     --------------
                            $08       Error during initialization
                            $10       Write protect error
                            $20       Volume mismatch error
                            $40       I/O error

Notes to hard drive owners:
--------------------------

     This program will probably benefit you more than anyone else.  All
possible efforts were made to accommodate you.  The light-bar file selection
and volume support make it a breeze to use with your hard disk.  Sider owners:
make sure to read the above note, and do not rant and rave about a bug in DDD
2.1E that does not exist.  You were informed here!  Also notice also that this
program does work correctly with large volumes, unlike DDD 2.0+.
    Things not to do with your hard disk:
    1) Do not use the Format option on a volume.
    2) Do not unpack a disk to a volume.
       This will not make you or your users very happy.
    3) Do not pack a large volume (you CAN pack a small volume!).
