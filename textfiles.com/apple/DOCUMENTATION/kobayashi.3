and,  by  mimicking  a radically increased gravitational field, pulls it
closer to the ship for examination or other purposes.  Pressor beams use
the  same  technology  but  with  polarities  reversed  to  exert  great
gravitational  pressure  on  a  small  area.   Conventional tractors and
pressors are effective only on masses less than several hundred thousand
tons; this makes their effect on other starships minimal. The net effect
of a full force tractor or pressor on a starship is equivalent to a hard
shove. Therefore, tractor and pressor beams generally are  not  used  in
battle situations. 


SCREENS

Defensive  screening  is one of the largest power drains in a Federation
starship and its main protection in  battle.   (Klingon  --  being  more
interested  in  offensive armament -- pay relatively little attention to
screening.  But  the  better-engineered  and  -powered  screens   of   a
Federation  ship are a match for Klingon phasers.) The screens are a set
of   classic    force    fields,    domains    of    tuned    high-state
particle/wavicle-packet   fluctuations:   six  sets  of  field  domains,
overlapping and reinforcing one another in a manner reminiscent  of  the
tuned  reinforcement  of phasers (i.e., one screen's destruction weakens
all of the others by 10 percent). 

Enterprise has six screens -- fore, aft, right  high,  right  low,  left
high,  left  low  --  that  completely  surround  the  ship when all are
running. Power can be selectively channeled to each of them to reinforce
one screen that's being attacked more forcefully than the others, though
this decreases the total power available  to  the  others.  Screens  are
powered out of the warp drive and do not function at peak capacity while
the  ship  is  in warp and running. This tends to encourage a captain to
choose "stand-and-fight" battle situations whenever possible. 

Self-destruct can be effected by overloading  all  of  the  screens  and
channeling  full power to them. This option is available for last-resort
situations but is not considered a viable  alternative  in  most  battle
scenarios  for  obvious  reasons.   Those who bluff self-destructs often
find their bluffs called. 


SENSORS

Enterprise's main sensor array (sometimes  referred  to  as  "scanners")
includes  a  variety  of  tachyar-based  devices  capable  of  detecting
movement or radiation and analyzing  the  composition  and  location  of
almost  every  known  element.  At  short  range  (up to 500 miles), the
sensors can detect individual creatures' life  signs.  At  medium  range
(500  to  50,000  miles)  they  are  better  at  detecting  movement and
radiation from the infrared up through visible light,  the  ultraviolet,
and  x-rays;  and  doing  compound  analysis. Long-range sensing (50,000
miles to approximately  10  parsecs,  or  32  light-years)  is  confined
primarily  to  very strong and artificial radiation sources (i.e., other
ships, which in warp drive tend to leave a readable "ion  trail"  behind
them)  and  large-scale  physical  movement  (planetary  orbits, stellar
motion, etc.). Certain lead-bearing  and  heavy-metal-bearing  compounds
(pitchblende,  etc.)  will  interfere with scanner functions. Long range
scanning in particular is easily disrupted by interstellar "jamming" and
"bad  weather,"  because  of  the  extreme   length   of   the   tackyon
particle/wave on which it relies. 

Personal  scanners,  such  as  the tricorder, are also more effective at
close range (1 to 1000 feet)  than  at  long  range  (5  to  10  miles).
Tricorder   readings  usually  have  to  be  supplemented  with  on-site
investigation: they tend to be vague.HF


TRANSPORTERS

Close-range transporters move people and objects by analyzing the energy
states of their atoms and then creating an equivalent set of states,  or
Dirac  jumps,  at  another  location. (Therefore, one briefly "ceases to
exist" while in the transporter, which is what always makes Dr. McCoy so
nervous about using it.) The transporter's maximum range is 30,000 miles
(a little more than the usual orbital altitude of a visiting  starship).
Because of the extreme proximity of the tolerances to which they must be
tuned  to  ensure  that  living  beings  get safely from one location to
another, transporters  are  cranky  and  delicate,  and  are  constantly
malfunctioning   for   one   reason   or   another:    dilithium-crystal
misalignment; interstellar jamming, or "black noise" that  threatens  to
distort  the  signal: and so forth. When screens are up, the transporter
cannot be used to beam  out  of  the  ship.  Overuse  (heavy  continuous
transporting   for  more  than  several  hours)  may  cause  transporter
circuitry to burn out.  Intraship beaming is extremely dangerous and  is
not recommended except in utmost emergencies. The result of beaming from
one location to another within the ship is almost always fatal. 


SHUTTLECRAFT

Shuttlecraft  are  small general-use spacecraft powered by impulse power
only. They are used: for trips that exceed the  transporter's  effective
range,  when  the transporter is malfunctioning, and for carring objects
either too large or too delicate to entrust to  the  transporter.  Their
power  supply  is rechargeable from the Enterprise but is still somewhat
limited.  Their effective  range  is  about  500,000  miles  at  .10  c.
(Shuttlecraft  do  not  exceed this speed limit for fear of relativistic
effects.) This gives them up to about eight hours at cruise or  an  hour
at top speed. 


COMMUNICATIONS

Subspace  "radio"  is actually a tachyon-based technology bearing little
resemblance to the radio of old. It is not dependent  on  lightspeed  --
indeed the slowest it can go is c; its high speed limit is about 136,000
c,  or  warp  9.  But  even  this  great  speed becomes insufficient for
effective communication as one's distance from Star Fleet increases. Out
near the Romulan Empire, for example, it takes nearly three weeks for  a
message  to  reach  Fleet. This leaves a starship captain pretty much on
his or her own,  although  regular  communication  with  Star  Fleet  is
expected  and  advised.  Subspace  radio  can  be  jammed  purposely  or
interfered with by bad interstellar "weather."

Communicators use the same technology but with a  shorter  range  (about
40,000 miles) and much lower power. Use in atmosphere limits their range
to about 20,000 miles, because of the dissipation of tachyon pulses into
Cerenkov radiation on contact with the gas molecules in air. 

Ship's  intercom  systems  permits  audio  and  visual communication and
conference calling to and from any location on the ship. One may also be
"patched  in"  to   external   communications,   allowing   these   same
capabilities from virtually any location. 


COMPUTER

Enterprise's  computers  are  extraordinarily  versatile,  with  a total
memory and "effective synapse  number"  that  make  some  people  wonder
whether  they're  slightly  sentient. Their exact virtual memory size is
classified; it is rumored to be in the multiple petabytes(1 PeB equals 1
quadrillion bytes.) Computers can report verbally or visually (hard copy
or display) on any phenomenon the ship's  sensors  can  detect  and,  if
requested, will include analysis. The computers also contain a vast data
base of general information on ship's function and other subjects.HF


SICK BAY

Sick  bay  contains  various  kinds  of  medical  scanning equipment and
numerous  devices  for  healing  the  sick:  primarily   the   "anabolic
protoplaser,"  which  forces  tissue  regeneration. The more delicate or
specialized the tissue (heart, brain, etc.) the longer such regeneration
takes. A broken bone can be reknit in about an hour.  Damaged  brain  or
neural  tissue  regenerates  in  one  to two days, but rehabilitation or
retaining time must be added.HF

ORNA/IOTA TRIANGULI
*******************
This system has 6 planets
Planet #2 has 2 moons
Planet #3 has 3 moons

Free traders report one intelligent species (Name: ORNAE). They  have  a
reputation  as  great  tool makers. Last contact: One standard year ago.
The Ornae were reported to be interested  in  Electronic  Equipment  and
Extracultural  Artifacts.   A  striking borderline M-class world of blue
sandstone canyons and evaporated salt-pan seas. This is the home of  the
Ornae, a strange protoplasmic/amoeboid species... never yet contacted by
Federation  personnel  but  rumored  by  free traders to be the greatest
toolmakers in the galaxy. An Ornaet will use anything as a tool...  even
itself.

Mass: 3.5 sextillion metric tons
Distance from primary: 48.6 astro-units (4,519,800,000 miles)
Pre-existing information: Location uncharted; no preliminary mapping.
Planet name: Unassigned

From  the  surface of this small, dark rocky world, far out in its solar
system, a radio signal whispers desperately into endless  night,  crying
out for help...and the language it uses is ancient English.

***********************
This system has 8 planets
Planet #1 has 3 moons
Planet #2 has 2 moons
Planet #3 has 7 moons
Planet #5 has 2 moons
Planet #6 has 4 moons

Planet  location  charted  on  two  occasions.  No  confirmation  of the
presence of intelligent life.  U.S.S.  Hastings  attempted  contact  and
assumed  lost.  U.S.S.  Vincennes  also  lost.  Causes:  Unknown.   AREA
QUARANTINED. Commanders are cautioned  to  keep  clear  of  this  system
unless  absolute  necessity.   An  R-type  world  with  a silvery, murky
methane  atmosphere  and  a  bad   reputation...no   Federation   vessel
investigating it has ever come back. 


HASTORANG/1214 NORMAE
*********************

System charted and mapped.
Planet name: Hastorang
Translation: "Lifemother"
Intelligent Hominid life
Level of civilization: Feudal
Single language: Daiya

Opened  to  licensed free trade four standard years ago. Prime Directive
is in force.  A gorgeous M-type planet, almost a twin of Earth---but  an
Earth  stuck  fast  in  the  tenth century and populated by alien kings,
armored  knights,  distressed   damsels,   and   wizards..."white"   and
otherwise. And what of the dragons? 


ACHIR/R OCTANTIS
****************
This system has 1 planet

Location and existence noted within last standard year. Area outside the
Federation's   patrol  corridors.  Several  forms  of  intelligent  life
reported  to  share  the  sphere.  All  the  species  reported   to   be
technologically  advanced.   An  alien  species has built a Dyson sphere
around this lovely rose-colored sun---a stupendous feat of  engineering,
now home to billions of people. But the star is dangerously variable and
about  to  flare up. Without the help of a Federation starship, billions
could die.

Planet #1 has 2 moons
Planet #3 has 3 moons
Planet #4 has 2 moons
Planet #6 has 2 moons
Planet #7 has 2 moons
Planet name: Niau
Type of planet: Class "M"
Diameter: 6000 miles
Mass: 5 sextillion metric tons
Distance from primary: 2 astro-units (186,000,000 miles)
Satellites: 1
Intelligent life: Not confirmed
Contact: Unconfirmed finding of "BONES" of  unknown  landing  party.  An
Earthlike planet populated by an intelligent feline species in the early
stages  of  its space program. As yet there has been no official contact
with the Federation. However, a delirious free trader  picked  up  in  a
derelict  ship  near  the system reported seeing the bones of a previous
exploratory expedition there. This observation has not been confirmed. 


JAUZAH/4403 PAVONIS
*******************
This system has 4 planets
Planet #2 has 2 moons
Planet #4 has 3 moons

Location charted and preliminary mapping done. Intelligent life readings
un-confirmed. Readings confused and  no  final  determination  made.  No
artifacts  or  other signs of life forms known to the Federation. Planet
name assigned randomly.  A small, dry, cold planet,  rich  in  minerals,
but  barren  of  cities or other artifacts. Sensors insist that life has
evolved here...but it has not yet been found. Star Fleet cannot tell  if
this is a trap, a sensor malfunction, or a misunderstanding. 


KLUSOS/515 ARAE
***************
This system has 1 planet

Location  charted  and preliminary mapping done. Intelligent life found.
Hostile action precluded direct contact. U.S.S. Nihal attacked in orbit.
All communication  refused.  Nihal  withdrew  to  avoid  prolonging  the
engagement.   About  as  non-Earthlike  as a planet can get---a world of
corrosive soil and an atmosphere full of  hydrochloric  acid.  Why  this
world"s  sleek, glassy starships attack everyone who passes by remains a
mystery... as does what can be done to stop them. 

TSHIO/803 MUSCAE
****************
This system has 6 planets
Planet #1 has 4 moons
Planet #3 has 3 moons
Planet #6 has 7 moons

Location charted. No mapping. Intelligent life found.  Anomalous  sensor
readings  indicate  possible  contamination  by  more  advanced culture.
PLANET  QUARANTINED.  Position  classified.  Prime  Directive  in   full
effect.   A  world superficially Earthlike but housing a bizarre culture
uprooted from Earth by another spacefaring species in the dim past. 


KHUT/43 PAVONIS
***************
This system has 2 planets
Planet #2 has 2 moons
Intelligent life found.
Contact: Ceased by request of Khut. Reclusive species, extremely
cautious. Privacy has religious importance. Federation vessels
are advised to avoid planet except in extreme emergency.
A hot world of mountainous continents washed by soupy seas of
hydrocarbons and liquid plastics. In those seas live the a'Khut,
intelligent and reclusive beings who in the past have asked only
to be let alone. Recently, however, they have been desperately
hailing every ship that passes their planet.
