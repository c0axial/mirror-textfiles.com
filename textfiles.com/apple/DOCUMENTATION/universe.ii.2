** Drive Systems **

Hyperdrive -
Used  for  interstellar travel. The only way to move from one starsystem
to another is to use the hyperdrive.  The hyperdrive is  too  inaccurate
to use for moving from planet to planet. 

Sub-light Drive -
Used  to  travel  between  planets within a starsystem. Unable to propel
yoour spacecraft faster than light, the sublight is too slow to be  used
for moving between starsystems. 

Gravity Generator -
Generates gravity for environmental and protective purposes. The gravity
generator  will  also  protect  you  from  acceleration  caused  by  the
sub-light drive. 


** Energy Systems **

Converter -
A power generator that transforms Ore IV into energy units. 

Accumulators -
Store energy units made by the converter. This system is primarily  used
whenn  another  system,  such as the hyperdrive, requires a large amount
opf eneregy at a rate much  faster  than  the  convertoer  can  produce.
Essentially a large collection of batteries. 

Ore Storage -
Holds the 4 different types of ore (I-IV). 


** Command and Support Systems (C&S) **

Bridge -
The  command  cneter  of your ship. If the bridge is destroyed, the game
ends. 

Crew Quarters -
The living quarters and off-duty stations for your crew. 

Computer -
The central computer for your spacecraft. It is very powerful, but not a
true machine intelligence. 

Autodoctor -
An automatic medical repair unit used for raising you  and  your  crew's
health percentage. 

Hibernaculum -
A   cold-storage  unit  for  transporting  passengers.  The  process  is
dangerous and you should expect to lose  a  certain  percentage  of  the
passengers upon revival. 

Vidcomm -
The video communications device for your spacecraft.  In this game it is
limited  to receive only. Messages are stored by repeater units in orbit
around all of the habitable planets, so you  won't  miss  any  messssges
that you might need. 

Cargo Hold -
Stores cargo that you purchase down at the starports or that you capture
from enemy vessels. 

Atmospehrics -
The  environmental  control  for  your  spacecraft.   If  this sustem is
destroyed, everyone on the spacecraft will die. 


** Scanning Systems **

Solar/Planetal Scanner -
Scans the starsystem that  you  are  in  or  the  planet  that  you  are
currently orbiting. 

Resource Scanner -
Scans the surface of habitable or airless planets for the best available
mining site. 

High Definition Scanner -
Provides a detailed scan of any spacecraft within your range. 


** Lander systems **

Orbital Shuttle -
Used  to travel to and from starports, which are found on the surface of
almost all of the habitable planets. 


** Weapon Systems **

Missile Launcher -
Powers and launches missiles at enemy ships. 

Missile Rack -
The system of racks and conveyors used to store missiles and  load  them
in the Missile Launcher. 

Enhanced Beam Weapon (EBW) -
A type of highly destructive particle-beam weapon. 

Shield Generator -
Generates  a  sphere of disruptive gravity waves around your spacecraft,
lessening the effects EBW or missile hits upon your spacecraft. 

Docking Adaptor -
Used only for docking and boarding an enemy spacecraft. It  will  adhere
to  the  other  spacecraft's  hull  and, if marines are deployed, burn a
breach right through the outer hull. 

Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) -
A variety of jamming equipment which  renders  your  ship  invisible  to
enemy scanners. 

Assault Capsule -
A  lander  used on habitable planets with a population sophistication of
40 or greater when you wish to mine ore  illiegally.  The  capsules  are
siimilar  to  the  orbital shuttles, but they carry marines, are covered
with armor, have a cannon mounted on top, and can land almost anywhere. 


** Mining Systems **

Ore Processor -
Another lander, this one greatly resembles a flying off-shore oil rig of
the 20th century. Used to mine ores on habitable and airless planets. 

Ramscoop -
A recently invented device which allows you to collect ore  IV  directly
from the atmosphere of a gaseous planet. 



CREW: USE AND MAINTAINANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running  a complex starship of the 24th century requires the aid of many
skilled technicians. Although you are  initially  provided  with  a  few
crewmen,  as  ou  expand  your ship you will find the need to hire more.
Each crewman has a number of characteristics on  which  they  should  be
judged. Hiring the right crewman can make the difference between winning
and losing. 

The characteristics for each crewman are: 

Health -
A  measurement  of  a  crewmember's  ability to perform his duty. If the
health percentage reaches 0, the crewmember  dies.  Reduced  health  may
result  from  battle  damage,  injury  when  moving dangerous cargo, and
changing watch. A crewman with a health percentage of less than 70%  may
die  of untreated injuries during any watch. This is especially true for
older crewmen. 

Age -
In the time period that Universe II depicts, a crewman's age  runs  from
20  to  130.  All crewmen automatically retire when they reach 130. On a
dossier, the  promotion  date  is  also  the  birthdate.  Age  primarily
determines  a  crewman's  ability  to  resist death from injuries. Older
crewmen are more  likely  to  die  from  untreated  (below  70%  health)
injuries. 

Specialty -
Every crewman has a specialty, which they may not switch. They are: 

Captain -
The   supreme   authority  on  a  spacecraft.  Captains  are  invariably
asomnigenated and technically always on duty. 

Astrogator -
The person responsible for getting the  spacecraft  from  one  place  to
another.  An  astrogator's  grade is especially important for hyperspace
jumps.  The  higher  grade  astrogators  will  break  the  ship  out  of
hyperspace  much  closer  to  the  habitable  zone of a starsystem, thus
saving a great deal of time and energy. 

Gunner -
The gunner is an expert on all the various forms of weaponry  that  your
ship  may  carry.  A superior gunner hs a greater accuracy with missiles
and more skill in using ECM's. 

Pilot -
The pilot is the person who flies the orbital shuttles, ore  processors,
and  the  assault  capsules.  All  lander-type vehicles require one more
pilot to operate. The  higher-grade  pilots'  ships  will  receive  less
damage  when  descending  through  the  atmosphere. In addition, when an
assualt capsule is on the ground, the pilot  mans  the  cannon  and  the
higher  grades are better shots. Pilots also move cargo to and fromm the
cargo hold. 

Miner -
They are the crewmen who land on habitable and airless  worlds  to  mine
the  various  ores.  They  are  required  to  launch ore processors. The
higher-grade miners (15 and above) will recover even more ore  than  the
resource  scanner  indicated  for  the mining site. Since miners work in
gangs, it is important to realize that their  grades  are  averaged  and
that it is the average which determines a particular ore processor's ore
recovery rate. 

Marine -
Marines are used in two circumstances: boarding & ground assaults.  When
boarding  an  enemy  spacecraft,  the  marine  works  as  a  individual,
neutralizing enemy marines, providing cover fire  or  capturing  control
panels.   During   ground   assaults,  the  marines  move  as  a  squad,
neutralizing enemy ground squads and attacking enemy  defense  stations.
All  marines  are  outfitted  with  various  types  of exosuit armor and
portable cannons. As a marine's grade rises, his ability to move and his
accuracy of fire improve. 

Engineer -
the fix-it man for your ship. Engineers  are  very  expensive  to  keep,
being  the  highest  paid of all the specialties. As an engineer's grade
rises, his speed and ability to repair the  various  ship-board  systems
improves. 


Grade -
A measurement of a crewman's knowledge of his specialty. Grades run from
1  to  20, grade 20 being the highest. Once a crewmember has been hired,
his grade will rise once a year. To speed things up, a  crewman  can  be
left at a technical school, where it will take much less than a year per
grade (and several thousand credits!). 

Promotions -
Promotions  happen  once  a year, on the crewman's birthday. A promotion
increases the crewman's grade and  income.  Once  a  crewmember's  grade
reaches 20, promotion day only signifies his next birthday. 

Income -
Income  is  based  on the crewman's grade and specialty.  The pay scales
are: 

Specialty   |   Base Income      Raise Per Grade
------------------------------------------------
Captain     |       N/A                N/A
Astrogator  |     15,000               750
Gunner      |     10,000               600
Pilot       |      7,000               250
Miner       |      8,000               300
Marine      |      4,000              1300
Engineer    |     19,000              1000

Crew can be paid when entering a drydock, in the Pay  Day  section.  Any
crew member which has not been paid in over 60 days will quit. 

Watch -
Watch  determines  which part of the day the crewman is on duty. The day
is broken up into three 8 hour watches.  Astrogators and  gunners  stand
regular  watches.  Pilots,  miners,  marines, and engineers have special
watches: They only work  when  their  duties  are  needed.  You  as  the
captain,  have undergone a process called asomnigenation. Asomnigenation
alters the body's chemistry and makes it unecessary for  you  to  sleep.
Astrogators  and  gunners  can  also  be  asomnigenated.   Anyone who is
asomnigenated is on a "full" watch and are always available. 


**Provisions**

One provision includes enough food, water, etc. to keep one person alive
for one day. Usually it is convenient to think of the provisions  supply
in terms of days, that is, with the current complement of crew, how long
before  they  starve.  To calculate the number of provision/days, divide
the number of provisions by the current number of crew. 



COMMERCE IN THE LOCAL GROUP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Local Grooup, the basic unit of  currency  is  the  credit.   The
credit  has  been fixed by the Interworld Trade Commision, at the famous
Meeting of 2167, as being equivalent in value o  one  unit  of  Ore  IV.
Since Ore IV is a common substance, but tedious to refine, it provides a
stable monetary base. 

Your  primary  goal,  as an interstellar merchant, is to earn money. The
four sources  of  revenue  available  to  youuare:   trading,  passenger
transport, mining, and orbital piracy. 


** Trading **

The  object  of  trading  is  to  buy  an  item  on  a world where it is
commonplace and relatively inexpensive and brin  it  to  a  world  whose
sophistication  is  from  1  to  10 points lower. Suddenly, your product
becomes state-of-the-art and highly  desirable.   Multiply  your  profit
times  the  10  products  you  can carry per trip and you have a sizable
amount of credits. 

Certain products are even more marketable.  Not  only  will  food/spice,
lifeforms,  narcotics,  and jewelry sell at a starport 10 sophistication
points lower than the point of purchase, they can be sold  at  starports
up  to  10 sophistication points higher than the point of purchase. This
reflects the fact that these product types have a more universal  appeal
and that they are not as dependent on local technology. 

Products have several characteristics. They are: 

Name -
This is the product's brand name. 

Type -
The  product's  classification.  Almost  every culture has product types
which are illegal to import. In the appendix is a list of  the  cultures
and their illegal product types. 

Cargo Size -
A measurement of the product's bulk. 

Sophistication -
A  measurement  of  the product's complexity.  This figure is always the
same as the product's planet of origin. At best, products  appeal  to  a
range  of 20 sophistication points. This reflects the fact that products
too simple for the buyer have been out-moded (no  one  buys  grindstones
anymore)  and  products  that  are  too  complex  do  not have the other
supporting technologies required (an ancient Egyptian would not have any
use for a television set). 

Price -
The value of a product is based upon its sophistication and its original
manufacturer's price (a figure you will never know exactly).  Note  that
products  up for sale at their planet of origin or on planets outside of
the sophistication's range of appeal will be worth 0 credits. 


** Mining **

Mining is a fairly straightforward way of earning money. It requires  at
least  one  ore processor, a mining squad, a resource scanner, a scanner
program, and patience. In additio, depending on how intent  you  are  in
the  pursuit  of  ore,  you  may  need  some  assault capsules and their
paraphernalia. 

Once the ore has  been  collected  and  refined,  it  is  brought  to  a
starport, where it can be exchanged for credits. 

The disadvantages of mining are numerous. High concentrations of ore are
difficult  to find. LAnding on airless worlds is usually very dangerous.
The start-up costs in  minng  are  very  high,  typically  above  50,000
credits. 


** Passenger Transport **

At every starport in the Local Grou there are people waiting for flights
to  other  planets.  You,  as  a  merchant, are continually hopping from
planet to planet. Equipped with a  hibernaculum,  you  can  carry  these
people  for  a  fair  amount  profit, which is based on the distance and
sophistication of the destination from your current starport. 


** Orbital Piracy **

In many of the less-developed starsystems, complete anarchy in orbit  is
the rule. Properly outfitted, you can profit from this situation. 

Capturing another spacecraft, though, is not a simple process.  You need
to  select a suitable target, scan it, and destroy its entire complement
of crew and marines, all  without  destroying  the  ship.  If  it  isn't
possible  to destroy all of the marines, you will have to send over some
of your own and hope the can secure the ship. 

Once the target ship is captured, you will be able to take  all  of  the
credits, ore, and products on board... if you survive. 


THE ON-BOARD COMPUTER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In  order  to operate, your spacecraft must be equipped with an on-board
computer. The computer controls many of the other systems on your ship. 

The speed of the computer is measured in *tevops per minute*  (trillions
of  operations  per  minute).  Program size is measured in the number of
operations which must be executed in a complete run.  So,  to  find  the
amount  of  time  it  takes  for a program to completely run, divide the
program's size (tevops) by the computer's tevops per minute figure. This
will give you the time in minutes. 

The following is a list of the programs available for your computer: 

Hyperspace Navigation -
Calculates the course, energy, time, and distance  required  to  make  a
hyperespace  jump.  This program must be available for the hyperdrive to
work. 

Normalspace Navigation -
Calculates the course, energym and  time  required  to  move  your  ship
anywhere  within  a  starsystem.  This program must be available for the
sub-light drive to work. 

Autodoctor -
Controls  the  autodoctor.  This  program  must  be  available  for  the
autodoctor to work. 

Hibernaculum -
Controls  the  freezing  and  thawing of passengers in the hibernaculum.
Thie program must be available for the hibernaculum to work. 

Solr/Planetal Scanner -
Interprets the data gathered by the solar/planetal scanner. This program
must be available for the solar/planetal scanner to work. 

Resource Scan -
Interprets the data gathered by the resource scanner. This program  must
be available for the resource scanner to work. 

High Definition Scan -
Interprets  the  data  gathered  by  the  high  definition scanner. This
program must be available for the high definition scanner to work. 

Shuttle Guidance -
Controls the ascent and descent of orbital shuttles. This  program  must
be available to launch orbital shuttles. 

Ore Processor Guidance -
Controls  the ascent and descent of ore processors. This program must be
available to launch ore processors. 

Assault Capsule Guiudance -
Controls the ascent and descent of assault capsules. This  program  must
be available to launch assault capsules. 

Missile Track -
Aims  and  launches  missiles  at a target object.  This program must be
available to launch missles. 

EBW Track -
Aims and fires the  EBW  at  a  target  object.  This  program  must  be
available to fire the EBW. 

ECM -
Controls  the  ECM  unit.  This program must be available for the ECM to
function. 

Athena IRS -
The information retrieval system program. This program contains hundreds
of important facts and figures which can be recalled  by  typing  a  key
word. 


When  you sell a computer, all of the programs you have purchased for it
will be lost. Once a program has been purchased,  there  is  no  way  to
remove it short of selling the computer.
