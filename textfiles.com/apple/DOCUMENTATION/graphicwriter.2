The Paint Palette
-----------------

Drawing in color is done with the aid of what is called the PAINT PALETTE. This
is called up on the screen by selecting "Paint Palette" from the Goodies menu or
using OPEN APPLE-A (for "Artist"). The palette is like an artist's tray of
colors used during painting. The PAINT PALETTE can be kept on the screen as you
are drawing and can be moved about by dragging on its top black part. It can be
put away by selecting "Hide Paint Palette" from the Goodies menu, or by clicking
in its CLOSE BOX. (Clicking on the title of your document at the very top of the
window also puts the PAINT PALETTE away).

Selecting A Color
-----------------

A COLOR is selected by simply clicking in one of the 48 colored ovals. A check
mark next to the oval signifies that it has been selected. Also, the selected
color will appear in the COLOR BOX at the bottom of the screen. All subsequent
typing or drawing will be displayed in this color. Note that DOUBLE CLICKING a
colored oval on the PAINT PALETTE will select that color and put the PALETTE
window away.

Typing In Colors
----------------

The way to type in color is by first selecting one from the PAINT PALETTE just
prior to typing. You can change the color of existing text by highlighting it
and then selecting a color. Note that the text will remain highlighted and
appear in an INVERTED color until you click the mouse to reveal its true color.

Painting Modes
--------------

There are 3 PAINTING MODES. The current MODE will always be checked on the
Goodies menu. HEAVY PAINT is very simple to understand. Any color you draw with
will paint directly over any drawings underneath it. WATER COLOR results in
"mixed" colors when painting over a different color than the currently selected
drawing color. The drawings below it will often "come through" resulting in
bizarre combinations of colors. However, the primary purpose of WATER COLOR is
TO LET THE BLACK SHOW THROUGH. DYE simply paints over any BLACK parts of a
picture. On an empty screen, a drawing done in DYE will end up being
transparent, but when you paint over a picture that contains the color BLACK,
then just let the BLACK portions of the drawing underneath become DYED.

Hiding Colors
-------------

On the Display you will find "Hide Red, Blue, Green or Yellow. Selecting one of
these will temporarily HIDE that particular color from the screen. The Display
menu will then change to "Show Red" or "Show Blue", etc. Re-selecting one will
once again SHOW that color. This is how you can view various colored OVERLAYS.

Living Color Or Black & White
-----------------------------

You can also select "Black & White" from the Display menu in which case the
entire screen will be displayed in black and white, or shades of gray where
there are different colors. Selecting "Living COlor" returns the screen back to
all color again regardless of which colors were previously "hidden".

"Living Color" therefore SHOWS ALL COLORS, as if you selected them from the menu
one by one. "Black & White" will override any "Show Colors" and HIDE them all at
the same time.

Objects
-------

When you draw a shape, it becomes what's called an OBJECT. This means it is
INDEPENDENT from the rest of the document or other OBJECTS.

Selecting & Changing An Object
------------------------------

This is proven by the fact that you can change the size, position or color of an
OBJECT without disturbing the others. This is done by SELECTING the OBJECT
(clicking on it with the HAND TOOL). A "marquis" type border will surround the
OBJECT telling you that it is currently SELECTED, which means you can now do
various things with the OBJECT.

An OBJECT'S LINE THICKNESS can be altered by selecting the OBJECT and then
immediately selecting a different CROSS.

An OBJECT can be RE-SIZED by holding down the CONTROL key while dragging it with
the HAND TOOL.

An OBJECT can also be ROTATED by selecting "Rotate" from the Goodies menu. This
is ideally used on TRIANGLES to obtain "arrows" of different direction.

You can change an OBJECT'S COLOR by clicking a different colored oval on the
PAINT PALETTE. Likewise, the DRAWING MODE for this particular OBJECT can be
changed by selecting "Heavy Paint", "Water Color", or "Dye" from the Goodies
menu.

Selecting Multiple Objects
--------------------------

You can select a number of different OBJECTS at the same time by holding down
the SHIFT key while clicking on them one by one. Each one of the OBJECTS will
appear with a "marquis" frame.

These selected OBJECTS will then behave as a GROUP. You can change all their
COLORS to the same color, as well as change their LINE THICKNESSES or DRAWING
MODES. You can move ALL of them in unison by holding down the SHIFT key while
dragging. However, if you try to RE-SIZE any one of them (with the CONTROL key),
only that one particular OBJECT will be altered since the others will then
become "de-selected".

Cut/Copy/Paste With Objects
---------------------------

Just as you highlighted text and performed Cut, Copy, or Paste, so can you
select an OBJECT (or multiple OBJECTS with the SHIFT key) and choose Cut or Copy
from the Edit menu. The copied OBJECT will appear on the Clipboard, replacing
whatever was there before it. As you'll recall, the Clipboard's contents can be
viewed as desired by selecting "Show Clipboard".

When an OBJECT exists on the Clipboard, you can then select "Paste" from the
Edit menu and the OBJECT will reappear at the top-left corner of the CURRENTLY
SELECTED REGION. For example, if you Cut an OBJECT from your document, and then
select a different REGION, the Pasted OBJECT will be placed at the top-left
position of this REGION -- no matter what Page you are on (or have scrolled to).
You may, of course, DRAG a Pasted OBJECT away from this position by using the
HAND TOOL. When you Paste an OBJECT directly on top of another OBJECT, you might
wish to move it away (using the HAND) in order to expose any "hidden" OBJECTS
beneath it.

Regions
-------

A REGION can be simply defined as "an area". A REGION is usually comprised of a
"group" of multiple OBJECTS that form a single picture.

Typing Regions
--------------

The simplest REGION is called the TYPING REGION. When you create a new document,
a large TYPING REGION is automatically created which essentially "covers" the
entire document. You don't have to worry about it. You just keep typing and as
you hit RETURN, the lines of text keep growing and growing.

Bottomless Regions
------------------

This beginning TYPING REGION is also known as a BOTTOMLESS REGION in that an
imaginary "rectangle" surrounds the whole document, with no tangible BOTTOM. You
can virtually type forever downwards. And just as you can keep typing, so can
you keep drawing and adding OBJECTS into a BOTTOMLESS REGION.

Boxed Regions
-------------

A BOXED REGION is one that does have a bottom. It is finite to the degree that
if you were to type in this REGION, you would eventually come to a point where
you could no longer type, that is, the REGION'S boundaries will restrict the
typing to the specified dimensions.

A BOXED REGION is most often used when you want to confine certain OBJECTS
within a particular area and act on them without disturbing any others. Such is
the case of a complex drawing that is complete to your satisfaction, and you
wouldn't want it to be changed. The "set" of OBJECTS can be copied and sent to
other places on your document, into other REGIONS or even to other documents
(via the Clipboard, or GraphicWriter Scraps).

Creating a New Region
---------------------

As previously mentioned, a new, "Untitled" document begins with a BOTTOMLESS
TYPING REGION. To create and define a totally NEW REGION, simply select "New
Region" from the Regions menu and a default "rectangle" will appear on the
screen.

The Object Mode
---------------

REGIONS have 2 different MODES. The OBJECT MODE is fairly straight forward. The
REGION is simply made up of a collection of OBJECTS brought together to form a
single picture. You create and draw the OBJECT directly within the REGION.

The OBJECTS within a REGION can be Cut or Copied. You may also create an OBJECT
outside the REGION, Copy the OBJECT then Paste it into the selected REGION.

Therefore, the purpose of a REGION is to "group" OBJECTS together. The REGION
will then behave as a single entity, which is discussed later. The reasons why
you would want to use REGIONS will become much more evident under the heading
"Page Making".

The Canvas Mode
---------------

The CANVAS MODE is quite different. This is where you draw within the selected
REGION using the PAINT BRUSH TOOL to do "free hand" drawings. You must
understand that the drawings performed in the CANVAS MODE are NOT OBJECTS. The
drawings are nothing more than "dots on the screen". These "dots" CAN NOT BE
MOVED nor can they be re-sized. They merely form a picture within the REGION and
have become "blended" into the area. You can, however, draw right over them, or
erase them by selecting and drawing with "White" paint. You may also Cut or Copy
an ENTIRE CANVAS REGION and Paste it into another CANVAS REGION, but NEVER into
an OBJECT REGION.

IMPORTANT RULE:Once you have selected either the OBJECT MODE or CANVAS MODE and
have started to draw in the REGION, you may NOT revert to the other MODE while
working in that REGION.

Black On White/White On Black

The "normal" mode for most applications is "Black on White" which means "black
text on white paper", much like a typewriter, However, GraphicWriter allows you
to do the reverse by selecting "White on Black" from the Regions menu.

This ONLY EFFECTS NON-COLORED TEXT and pertains to the ENTIRE REGION. You can
subsequently paint "over" any part of the REGION. You can revert to the opposite
by re-selecting the other "inversion" from the Regions menu.

Selecting & Operating Upon Regions
----------------------------------

A REGION becomes selected by holding down the OPEN APPLE key while clicking on
it with the HAND TOOL. The OPEN APPLE key is necessary so as to distinguish the
REGIONS from OBJECTS. Upon selection, you can operate on the entire area of the
REGION at once, such as RE-SIZING it to different dimensions by holding down the
OPEN APPLE plus the CONTROL key at the same time while "tugging" on the REGION
with the HAND. Note that by using the SCROLL BARS it is possible to create a
REGION which is larger than the viewable screen. You would alternately RE-SIZE
and SCROLL. However, due to memory limitations, a CANVAS REGION may NOT be
larger than 8 inches wide by 10 inches long.

You can change the REGION from "Boxed" to "Bottomless", or you may choose to put
a BORDER around a REGION by selecting "Framed" from the Regions menu. This will
draw a BOUNDARY FRAME, which can thereafter be removed by selecting "Unframed"/

Selecting "Show Regions" will allow you to see the positions and sizes of your
REGIONS in the form of rectangular "frames" on the screen. Thereafter, the
Regions menu will say "Hide Regions" which will, of course, remove the viewing
frames.

Helpful Rules
-------------

The OPEN APPLE key always pertains to REGIONS. If you do NOT use the OPEN APPLE
key, then you will be acting upon OBJECTS or TEXT.

The CONTROL key gives you "Control" of a REGION or an OBJECT.

The HAND is used for SELECTING, MOVING and RE-SIZING both REGIONS and OBJECTS.

The SHIFT key, while used to select MULTIPLE OBJECTS or TEXT, unfortunately may
NOT be used to select multiple REGIONS. However, you can Copy OBJECTS within
REGIONS, or CANVAS pictures, individually into or out of the Clipboard or
GraphicWriter Scraps and Paste them elsewhere as desired.

Page Design
-----------

For the advanced user or desktop publisher, REGIONS become almost mandatory for
sophisticated page layout. For example, multiple text columns (required for
creating a NEWSLETTER) can be defined by laying down REGIONS for these columns.
You can choose separate colors for the entered text as well as separate
justifications for each REGION. Changing one REGION will not alter the other. In
this way, a body of text could be typed in one column with the writing carrying
over and continuing on in the other column.

You can create as many columns as you wish, with each REGION having a unique
size, and you can scatter these REGIONS around a page as well as using multiple
pages. (See "Page Setup" to learn how you can change the actual page lengths).

Documents can also be created that are "mixed". An example would be two REGIONS
of text along with a third REGION dedicated to some artwork drawings.

Text Plus Graphics
------------------

The basic rule to remember when combining text and graphics pictures is that the
pictures will always "override" the typed text. This is because a drawing is
really a "painting" and will usually cover-up the text. Of course, a WATER COLOR
or DYE will change the apparent color of any underlapping text (until you move
one of these OBJECTS away).

Typing Over Pictures
--------------------

As you are typing, the characters might run under an OBJECT, as the text will
tend to "disappear". In fact, you might even see a "blank line" across the
screen during backspacing of text. What this means is that because you are in
the TYPING MODE at the time, there will be an illusion of parts being "erased".
You will experience this whenever you are typing and there are pictures that
"get in the way".

To review the pictures or text, that is, to see what the document "really" looks
like, all you have to do is click on the "Update" button at the bottom right
hand corner of the screen.

This will show the OBJECTS in their proper and full pictures, in which case if
any text is underneath them, the OBJECTS will "smother" the text so that the
text will not be seen. (except for most Water Color and Dye OBJECTS).

Text Within Regions
-------------------

The text entered into a BOTTOMLESS or BOXED REGION can be operated upon with the
normal editing functions such as cut & paste, highlighting and changing font,
size, or color, and so forth. However, the REGION can also maintain a set of
TABS and MARGINS and because of this, the real power of GraphicWriter begins to
be noticed.

When we create a NEW REGION, the MARGINS are set, as a default, to the left and
right boundaries of the REGION.

You'll recall the rule that the RULER you see is for the current paragraph.
Well, in this case it's our REGION! As with any paragraph, dragging the RIGHT
MARGIN MARK to a new setting will alter the text within that REGION.

Mixing Text And Graphics
------------------------

You can also combine GRAPHICS pictures within the same REGION containing TEXT.
For example, if you had a drawing in one REGION, and typed a "label" in a
separate REGION just below the drawing, then if you wanted to move both the
drawing and label to another position on the page (or to another page), you
would have to move them individually. However, the correct way to do this is to
COMBINE them all into one single REGION, making this unit much easier to work
with.

Cut-Copy-Paste
--------------

You can use Cut, Copy or Paste on any TEXT within the OBJECT REGIONS. The TEXT
is called REAL TEXT in that it is considered to be "loose" and movable. This is
best understood when you think of each REGION as being miniature "documents"
within themselves. You can take the text from one REGION and Paste it into
another.

Overlays
--------

An OVERLAY is the term used for when you "mask" an OBJECT or a REGION by placing
a WATER COLOR or a DYE OBJECT directly over it. (Of course, using HEAVY PAINT
will cover an OBJECT or REGION completely).

Through the use of the "typing fields" and OVERLAYS sophisticated artwork can be
obtained. Keep in mind as well that when your creative ideas come to life in the
form of a really good drawing, make Copies of them for safe-keeping.

Layouts
-------

You'll recall that "Show Full Page" can be selected from the Page menu in order
to view a miniature representation of the PAGE on which you are currently
working. This process proves very valuable when applied to Page Making.

Using "Show Full Page"
----------------------

When brought up on the screen, Show Full Page presents for your inspection the
"overall view" of a document Page. Lines of TEXT in this window will be
displayed as "waves". The window represents a single page, about 8 1/2 inches
across (the "viewable" section of the document window, which will be just a
portion of a wider document) and you can view different pages by first scrolling
to them prior to selecting "Show Full Page".

Rearranging The Layouts
-----------------------

One of the best usages for Show Full Page is that, by using the HAND, you can
actually drag and maneuver the OBJECTS or REGIONS about the page. In this way,
Page Making becomes much easier to accomplish. The OBJECTS or REGIONS can also
be Cut, Copied, or Pasted directly on the window (or into the Scrapboard). An
other process that you can perform on the "regular" document window with an
OBJECT or REGION can also be done on Show Full Page. The only function you can
NOT do is to RE-SIZE an OBJECT or REGION during Show Full Page.

Templates
---------

A template is the term used for a document which serves as a "model" that can be
used to create similar type documents. This is so you don't have to keep
creating the same drawings or layouts over and over.

Creating A Template
-------------------

It is very easy to create a TEMPLATE. All you do is perform your drawings and
then Save it back to the disk. For example, a document that has a logo at the
top can be used as Letterhead stationery. Then, you open up this TEMPLATE and
begin typing a letter. When ready to save this new document you MUST select
"Save As..." from the File menu. This allows you to save the document to a new
file with a different name. But take caution: Should you use "Save Document" to
save it, you'll be saving the TEMPLATE itself! The TEMPLATE will still have the
typing on it and therefore become "ruined"!

Examples Of Templates
---------------------

The main reason for creating TEMPLATES is to avoid doing extra work. When you
create a document or a report containing numerous REGIONS all carefully laid
out, or sophisticated drawings, or special areas of the document set aside for
graphs, etc, then stashing this "raw" document aside will allow you to use it
again.

Of course, if the ONLY difference amongst your documents is the actual text you
type in the REGIONS, then you could always bring up one of them, highlight the
text and Cut it out, then begin typing anew.

It is also a very wise thing to set aside a FOLDER on the disk for special
drawings, artwork, laid out REGIONS and so forth. The extra time spent in
creating TEMPLATES and FOLDERS may well prove worth it.

GraphicWriter Scraps
--------------------

GraphicWriter Scraps is a collection of sample drawings combined together within
a second Clipboard. This Scrapboard, as it is often called, can be brought up on
the screen by selecting "GraphicWriter Scraps" under the Apple menu.

A picture in this Scrapboard is like a "frame on film", The number of the
picture is shown along with the total number of pictures (1 of 4, etc). You can
move through the series of "frames" in the usual manner of clicking on the
arrows to scroll up or down, or by clicking in the scroll bar, or by dragging
the scroll "thumb".

A picture can be Cut ot Copied (by using the Edit menu) from your document and
into the Scrapboard, or a picture can be Cut or Copied from the Scrapboard and
then pasted into your document.

There is an important rule to remember which is called the FRONT WINDOW. If the
Scraps window is the front most window at the time, the editing functions (cut,
Copy or Paste) apple ONLY to the Scraps window and NOT the document. When you
CLOSE the Scraps window (or click on the document window), then the document
itself becomes the FRONT WINDOW and all editing functions behave as usual upon
the document.

You can store various pictures of your choice into the GraphicWriter Scraps so
that all of your documents can access and share them.

Page Setup
----------

Printing your document is accomplished by first selecting "Page Setup" from the
File menu. Upon doing so you will be presented with the Page Setup Window. The
Page Setup Window allows you to choose various ways of printing. You may bring
up this window at any time to "set" the parameters. However, there may be times
when you'll want to make changes to these parameters just prior to printing
special documents.

PRINTER represents the type of printer you will be using. You can choose the
ImageWriter, the ImageWriter II (which can print in colors), the LaserWriter, or
a Daisywheel type printer. (The latter can only print in DRAFT). To select a
printer, simply click in one of the "radio" buttons.

QUALITY represents the type of printing you want to use. The DRAFT button
signifies that you want to print the TEXT ONLY. This, of course, means that NONE
of your graphics drawings will be printed nor will the TEXT be able to be
printed in the different fonts, sizes, or styles (except bold and underline).
This printing mode is used most often for business letters and reports.

STANDARD represents the normal mode for printing graphics. This mode does allow
the fonts, sizes, and styles of your text to be printed. HIGH QUALITY mode is a
"double-pass" graphics printing which results in a much sharper picture than
with STANDARD (although this takes longer to accomplish). NOTE:At this time the
routines are NOT included for HIGH QUALITY for the IMAGEWRITER II and no
printing from the LASERWRITER. These will be included in GraphicWriter at a
latter time when Apple makes the routines available to the developers.

PAPER is for setting the paper length of each PAGE of your document. Note that
you can control this length while you are creating a document. The Page Number
on the screen, as well as Page Breaks, will be affected by this length. US
Letter is you normal 8 1/2 by 11 inches while US Legal is 8 1/2 by 14. A4 stands
for the common European size. Computer represents paper that is 15 inches wide.
Note that you can only print 15 inches wide PROVIDED you are using the Wide
ImageWriter.

PAGE NUMBERS, HEADERS and FOOTERS are selected individually by clicking in their
respective "boxes" (until a check appears). These are additional functions which
allow you to print the Page Number, Header or Footer for each page during the
actual printing. Clicking a checked box a second time will "un-check" it.

Clicking the "OK" button will accept the parameters, saving them for future
printing, and then return you back to your document. Clicking "Cancel" will
return you back to your document WITHOUT saving any changes you may have made to
the parameters.

IMPORTANT NOTE: These Page Setup parameters are always saved uniquely for each
document. You can therefore have many different documents, all with separate
settings.

Should your printing not quite come out as desired, then abort the printing and
bring up the Page Setup window, select the appropriate option, then continue
printing.

Print Setup
-----------

After assuring the Page Setup parameters are satisfactory, the very next step
towards printing is to select "Print Setup" from the file menu. Upon doing so
you will be presented with the Print Setup Window.

The COLORS boxes allow you to choose which of the main COLORS you would like
included in your printing. You choose a color by clicking in its box (until it
becomes checked). You can de-select (un-check) a COLOR by clicking the box a
second time. If a COLOR is not checked, then it will be excluded from the final
printing. In this way it is possible to print COLORED OVERLAYS by printing your
document a number of times. Each time you can print by selecting different
combinations of added or removed colors.

SCREEN TONES represent the degree of "screening" to be done during printing.
This is as if a screen or "grid" of a specific DOT DENSITY was laid over the
document, allowing only certain TINTS to show through. This is measured by the
percentage of SOLID BLACK.

FORM FEED is your normal type of paper feed where the printer sends the
specially prepared form paper on through during printing. CUT SHEET is where YOU
manually feed each sheet of paper during printing, one by one when asked to do
so.

The number of COPIES you wish to print can be entered by editing the COPIES box.

Clicking "Cancel" returns you back to your document WITHOUT saving any changes
to the Print Setup parameters.

Clicking the "START" button will save the current parameters and begins printing
according to all of the parameters from both the Page Setup and Print Setup
windows.

You can ABORT the actual printing by pressing OPEN APPLE-PERIOD.

Remember, these Print Setup parameters are saved uniquely for each document.

Bitmap Files
------------

Certain video scanning devices that DIGITIZE images (translate real life
pictures into patterns a computer can recognize) have the capability of creating
a disk file that, when loaded into the computer's screen memory, will display
the digitized picture. Such files are called BITMAP FILES. Essentially, they
contain BITS ("dots") that constitute a graphic picture for the Apple IIGS.
GraphicWriter has the capability of importing these BITMAP FILES provided they
have been generated from HIGH RESOLUTION graphics. For the GS this is 640 PIXELS
("dots") per line with 200 lines per screen.

To Import A Bitmap File
-----------------------

1)SELECT or create a CANVAS REGION (you can only import a Bitmap File into a
CANVAS REGION).

2)Select "Import Bitmap File" from the Goodies menu.

3)A standard file selection list window will be displayed. Select the file you
wish to import.

A standard Bitmap File contains 32,000 characters which comprises an entire
single GS screen in the High Resolution mode. The initial size of you CANVAS
REGION is unimportant. The entire 640 X 200 matrix of "dots" is imported into
memory. A smaller CANVAS REGION can be "Stretched" in size in order to see more
of the imported picture.

Exporting Bitmap FIles
----------------------

It is also possible to EXPORT a Bitmap Do;e from GraphicWriter to another
program or device (providing, of course, they have the capability of "excepting"
such a file). To do this, simply SELECT a CANVAS REGION and then select "Export
Bitmap Files" from the Goodies menu. As usual, you will be asked to enter a new
name for the file just prior to saving it.

NOTE:Since Bitmap Files require large amounts of disk space, it is NOT advisable
to use "Import" or "Export" just to transfer pictures between GraphicWriter
documents. Instead, use either Cut/Copy/Paste or GraphicWriter Scraps.

The Master Palette
------------------

Since GraphicWriter uses "Super Hi-Res" graphics, there are certain restrictions
applied to the selection of COLORS. In the "Super Hi-Res" mode, the GS can only
display FOUR unique colors per screen line, and although this restricts the
solid color spectrum, it is a necessary trade-off for good quality graphics or
word processing.

GraphicWriter behaves like it uses more than FOUR COLORS by employing a
technique known as DITHERING. This method, commonly used in the printing
industry, blends the different colored "dots" into PATTERNS that give the
appearance of different hues and shades. For example, the color PURPLE is
created by displaying alternate RED and BLUE dots. ORANGE is created with YELLOW
and RED dots, and so forth.

Changing the Master Palette
---------------------------

There may be times when SOLID COLORS will be preferred over DITHERED COLORS. For
example, one might be designing a layout which will only have one or two colors
for the camera-ready artwork at the printing press. In this case, the
restriction to four colors (where WHITE and BLACK are two of them) is more
desirable since solid, undithered colors are preferred.

By selecting "Set Master Palette" from the Display menu, the Set Master Palette
Window will be presented. If you select "Dithered", colors will be displayed on
your document using the DITHERING technique (described above). Note that the
color selections have no meaning when Dithering is selected.

By selecting "Solid Colors", your document will be displayed using FOUR
NON-DITHERED COLORS. White and Black are always chosen for two of the four
colors as White is necessary for "background" and Black is necessary for
"outlines". But, you can choose, Red, Blue, Green, or a combination of all three
for the remaining two colors.

Red, Blue and Green are offered as choices that represent the actual colored
"beams" that reflect on your monitor. By selecting different combinations, you
can obtain the following sold colors. (Note:An X means the color box is checked
while "O "means it is un-checked):


        Solid Color Table

RED  BLUE GREEN          SOLID COLOR RESULT
---  ---- -----          ------------------
 X    O    O                  RED
 O    X    O                  BLUE
 O    O    X                  GREEN
 X    X    O                  VIOLET
 O    X    X                  TURQUOISE
 X    O    X                  YELLOW
 X    X    X                  WHITE
 O    O    O                  BLACK

Colored Printing
----------------

GraphicWriter Version 1.0 supports the Apple ImageWriter and ImageWriter II
printers, as well as some Daisywheel "letter quality" printers (which can only
print TEXT). The LaserWriter will be supported pending Apple COmputer's release
of the actual LaserWriter driver software. The same holds true for the High
Quality printer drivers for the ImageWriter II.

Of these printers, only the ImageWriter II is capable of printing in COLOR.
Printing colored documents to a "Black and white" device requires some
discussion:

How Colors Will Print
---------------------

You can determine the exact way GraphicWriter will print colors to various
printers by understanding three general rules:

1) If the selected print device is the ImageWriter II, the document is printed
with the identical colored patterns as shown on the GS screen. 2) If the
selected print device is the ImageWriter or LaserWriter, colors will print in
Black and White patterns as follows.

A) If DITHERED is selected for the Master Palette, colors will be represented by
various shades of gray, depending upon the original colors' relative lightness
and darkness.

B) If SOLID COLORS is selected for the Master Palette, then all solid colors are
printed as solid Black and patterned colors are printed as Black Dots. 3)If
SCREEN TONES has been selected (from Print Setup), only the SOLID colors are
affected. If DITHERED is selected for the Master Palette, then only Black is
affected, whereas if SOLID COLORS is selected, then Black and ALL SOLID COLORS
will be affected by the SCREEN TONE selection.

Color Separation
----------------

GraphicWriter is an excellent tool for preparing multi-colored copy for
printing. However, it's important to plan your document in advance, keeping in
mind the various methods for printing, in order to achieve the desired results.

For example, if you are going to design a two or three colored promotional
piece, it is best to force the Master Palette into SOLID COLORS. Then, you would
print each OVERLAY one at a time. By selecting one of the colors from the Print
Setup parameters (and remember Black is a color), only those specific colored
portions of the artwork document will be printed in SOLID BLACK which is exactly
what is required for your camera-ready copy.

Daisywheel Printing
-------------------

A Daisywheel printer, of course, can only print TEXT characters and only in
black and white. The printer's "wheel" (which is nothing more than a metal ball
with an engraved alphabet) strikes a ribbon to print a character. It is
therefore virtually impossible to print any type of graphic "dots". However,
Style variations of BOLD and UNDERLINE are supported.
