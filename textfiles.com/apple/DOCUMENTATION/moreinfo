           If you do not believe this program is worth $10, well, then send
           me a note on how I can make the program better.

           Thanks very much in advance.

           This program may be passed around freely to anyone you like. The
           complete APW/C source code to version 1.0 is also available. Please
           include this file with the distribution since MoreInfo does not
           have a "Help" or "About" button.

.....now down to the real stuff........

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MoreInfo is an Apple IIgs Finder Extension, i.e., it adds to the Apple IIgs
System Disk 6.0's Finder (Finder version 6.0) and later versions. What is adds
is a "More Info" option to the Finder's "Icon Info" menu item.

The "MoreInfo" window shows you and allows you to change:

           o File type                 o Read access
           o Aux File Type             o Write access
           o Creation Date             o Delete access
           o Modification Date         o Rename access
                                       o Invisible/Visible
                                       o Backup needed/not needed

In addition, it also shows you (but you cannot change):

           o Full pathname
           o Storage type
           o Data fork size
           o Data fork blocks
           o Resource fork size
           o Resource fork blocks

This program requires Apple IIgs System Disk 6.0 or later to run.

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just copy the file "MoreInfo" to your folder named:

               "*:System:System.Setup"

on your boot disk. Now just re-boot.

-OR-

You can alternatively just copy the file "MoreInfo" to a folder named:

               "*:System:FinderExtras"

on your boot disk and then just run the Finder!

That's it.

Note:  You place MoreInfo in either System.Setup or FinderExtras folders.
----   Either place, it works great!

Using the Program:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run the Finder. Select some icons. Hold down the SHIFT key. Choose "Icon
Info" from the Finder's menus.

You will get the MoreInfo window instead of Finder Icon Info windows. Note
that without using the SHIFT key you get the normal Finder stuff.

MoreInfo shows you the pathname, type, aux type, creation date, modification
date, access, storage type, data size, data blocks, resource fork size, and
resource fork blocks for the file. Please note that I have not duplicated
most of the stuff you can find using the regular Finder Icon Info command.

The arrows at the lower right allow you to move through all the icons that
you have highlighted before invoking MoreInfo.

Please note that you can alter many of the values. Only change the ones
where you know what you are doing, then click the "Change" button to
make the changes happen. You cannot, for example, simply change a file
of type TXT ($04) to type S16 ($B3) and expect the former text file to
now be a IIgs Application program as if by magic. In addition, some file
systems under GS/OS will not allow all of MoreInfo's features to take
effect. As an example, changing just the rename access of an HFS file
system file will not work. This is an illegal operation under HFS. Since
no one knows what future file systems may be added, MoreInfo will try
to do what even you ask it to, and after selecting the "Change" button
the file information will be re-read from the disk and the MoreInfo window
will be updated so you can see if your change request "stuck".

Filetypes may be entered as hexadecimal numbers or as 3-letter filetype
abbreviations (such as SYS, S16, TOL, NDA, CDA, etc). Do not preceed the
hexadecimal entries with a "$". Auxilliary file types must be entered as
hexadecimal numbers.

Note:    You must click the change button to make changes. Do this before
----     leaving the current display and moving on. Whenever the Change
         button is enabled, this means that you may have made a change and
         you should click the change button to make it stick.

After you click "Change", MoreInfo will re-read the information from the
disk to see if the changes were allowed. For example, you can _try_ to change
the filetype of a folder...it simply won't be allowed.

This program could not possible have been developed as easily without
the Orca 2.0 (Byteworks) environment, APW/C (Apple) compiler, EdIt-16
text editor (SSSi and yours truly), and Rez (Apple) and Genesys (SSSi)
for resource fork creation/editing. Also, the engineers at Apple who
developed all this great system software for the GS.

Have Fun!
