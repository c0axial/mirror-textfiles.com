ICON APPLICATOR is a freeware program.

Charging a fee for ICON APPLICATOR is specifically prohibited.

One of the features of the Apple IIGS that make it easy to use is that
double clicking on a data file icon will cause GS/OS to automatically
launch the application program for that data file.

If the application has also been programmed to include the "MESSAGE CENTER"
feature of GS/OS, the application program will then automatically open the
selected data file.

Making use of the "MESSAGE CENTER" feature of GS/OS must be
specifically programmed into the application.  Many applications were
not programmed to make use of this feature.  If an application is so
programmed, it can not make use of the feature unless the data file
icon parameters include the full pathname of the application program.

Many Apple IIGS users can not make use of this automatic application
launch because they do not have an icon editor, do not understand the
importance of providing an application pathname or do not understand
how to use this feature.

ICON APPLICATOR is an easy to use program which will set the
application pathname by using the Standard Open File Dialog with which
every Apple IIGs user should be familiar.

After launching ICON APPLICATOR, the "About" dialog will appear.
Click anywhere in the dialog to close it.

Then, under the "File Menu" select the "Open" item and open the icon
file you wish to update.  A window will then appear at the bottom of
the screen.  It will display the first icon in the file at the
top-right of the dialog.  Below the icon the current application
pathname will be displayed in a long box.  Below this there are five
buttons:  "Get Application", "Previous Icon", "Next Icon", "Cancel"
and "Done".

You can change the application pathname in two ways.  First, click in
the long box and edit it manually.  Second, click on the "Get
Application" button.

NOTE: NEITHER METHOD WILL CHANGE THE "APPLICATION PATHNAME" FOR EITHER
A ProDOS 8 or ProDOS 16 APPLICATION ICON.  Double clicking on an application
program icon cause the application to be loaded and started.  It is not
necessary nor desirable to set an application pathname for an application file.


GET APPLICATION

Clicking on the "Get Application" button will cause the Standard Open
File Dialog to appear.  Only ProDOS 8 and ProDOS 16 application
programs will be displayed.  Select the application normally, that is,
just as if you were going to launch an application or open a data
file.  Double click on the application's filename or click on the OPEN
button.  When you select the application in this way, the Open File
Dialog will disappear and the full pathname of your application will
appear in the long box below the icon.

If you click on the "Cancel" button in the Open File Dialog, nothing
will change.

The other buttons in the Open File Dialog will operate normally.


PREVIOUS ICON

Clicking on this button will change the icon and pathname to the icon
just before the current icon displayed.  When you first open an icon
file, the first icon will be displayed and clicking on this button
will have no effect.


NEXT ICON

Clicking on this button will change the icon and pathname to the icon
just after the current one in the file.  If there is only one icon in
the file or if you are at the last icon, clicking on this button will
have no effect.


CANCEL

Clicking on this button will cancel the operation.  The current icon
file will not be saved to disk and no pathnames will be changed.  The
window will be closed and you can then open a new icon file.


DONE

Clicking on this button will bring up the Standard Save File Dialog.

If you change your mind about saving the modified icon file, you can
abort the save by clicking on the "Cancel" button in the Standard Save
File Dialog.

Icon files should ONLY be saved to the ICONS folder.  GS/OS can not find icons
anywhere else except in the ICONS folder.

The window will be closed and you can then open a new icon file.
