             WIZARDRY TIPS I
             

***************************************

THE BEGINNERS OF WIZARDRY SHOULD HAVE
THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF CHARACTERS:

       1)FIGHTER (FIG.,NIN.,SAM.)
       2)FIGHTER ( "  , "  , "  )
       3)FIGHTER ( "  , "  , "  )
       4)PRIEST  
       5)BISHOP
       6)MAGE

THIEVES ARE USELESS, THEY HAVE: HIGH AC
'S,
LOW HIT POINTS, BAD DISARMING SKILLS, A
ND
THEY CAN FIGHT WORTH GP.

AFTER YOUR CHARACTERS ARE APPROX. 12TH
LEVEL OR SO, YOU SHOULD CHANGE THIER
CLASSES TO THE FOLLOWING:

       1)NINJA
       2)SAMAURI
       3)SAMAURI
       4)LORD
       5)BISHOP
       6)MAGE

THE NINJA AND SAMAURIS ARE GOOD FOR 
FIGHTING. THE NINJA IS ALSO GREAT AT
DISARMING TRAPS. THE LORD IS A BACKUP
FIGHTER IN CASE ONE OF THE OTHER ONES
DIE. HE CAN ALSO CAST PRIEST SPELLS.
THE BISHOP IS THE MAIN SPELL CASTER
OF THE PARTY. ONCE HE IS OF THE 20TH
LEVEL OR SO, HE CAN CAST BOTH THE
PRIEST AND MAGE SPELLS. THE MAGE IS
THE MAIN OFFENSIVE SPELL CASTER. HE
CAN CAST THE SPELLS THAT KILL ENTIRE
GROUPS OF MONSTERS.

ALWAYS HAVE SIX CHARACTERS IN YOUR 
PARTY !!! OTHERWISE YOU SHALL SEE THE
GRAVEYARD OF ETERNAL DOOM.

THIS IS DA SIMPLE STUFF, FOR YOUR 2ND
LEVEL FIGHTERS WITH 2-7 HIT-POINTS.

THE SCROUNGER'S METHOD:
TO ACQUIRE MUCH NEEDED FUNDS FOR
RESSURECTING DEAD CHARACTERS, TRY
CREATING A FEW GNOME PRIESTS, STRIPPING
THEIR BODIES OF GOLD, AND THE (AN ACT
OF THE GODS?) DELETING THEM. THROUGH
MANY TRIALS, WE'VE FOUND THAT GNOME
PRIESTS ARE THE RICHEST OF ALL PEOPLE.
NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS AT LOW LEVELS,
RESSURECTION GETS PRETTY EXPENSIVE AT
HIGHER LEVELS....ANYONE WANNA CREATE
500 GNOME PRIESTS TO RESSURECT HIGH
LEVEL CHARACTERS???


COPPER GLOVES EXPLAINED:
THIS MYTHICAL MAGICK ITEM, WROUGHT IN
THE ELDAR DAYS, ARE SIMPLY GLOVES OF
COPPER THAT LOWER THE AC OF A GIVEN
FIGHTER BY 1. NOT QUITE WORTH 6000,
BUT AT HIGHER LEVELS........
AND, YES SILVER AND GOLDEN GLOVES DO
EXIST!

THE RESET METHOD:
THIS HARDLY NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED.
"FIGHTER #1 IS SLAIN!"
"FIGHTER #2 IS SLAIN!"
"PRIEST #1 IS SLAIN!"
"PRIEST #2 IS SLAIN!"
"MAGE #1 IS SLAIN!"
"MAGE #2 IS SLAIN!"

PRESS [RETURN] TO LEAVE THE CEMETARY
<RESET>
**BEEP!**
         APPLE ][
       (WHIR, WHIR, CLIC, CLIC)
THEN RECOVER. IF YOU HAVE THE OLD
VERSION, THEN YOU -DO- AGE 10 YEARS,
BUT DON'T LOSE HOPE, OUR CHARACTERS
HAVE LASTED 700 YEARS BEFORE DYING
OF OLD AGE. USE WITH CARE.

HOW TO GET THRU THE DARKNESS:
HERE'S THE SEQUENCE OF KEYS.
FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE DARKNESS
(** OFF LIMITS, ETC...)
WW...UNTIL YOU *OUCH* AGAINST A WALL.
DWWAWWWW..........UNTIL YOU GET TO THE
ELEVATOR. (HEY, THERE'S AN -ELEVATOR-?)
MORE ON THIS LATER. BACK TO YOU, JANE.

YOU ARE NOW ENTERING THE ZONE OF 6TH
LVL OR SO HINTS. YOU CAN TURN BACK!

THE "APPORTER" METHOD:
FIRST, MAKE OUR GOOD 'OL FRIEND, THE
FIRST LEVEL GNOME PRIEST. USE HIM
AS A BANK, TRADING ALL YOUR MONY
TO HIM AFTER AN ADVENTURE. WHEN A GIVEN
CHARACTER DIES, (E)DGE OF TOWN, (L)EAVE
GAME (THIS SAVES DATA TO DISK). THEN
GO THE GILGAMESH, (A)DD APPORTER (THE
GNOME PRIEST) AND GO TO CANT. YOU
-DO- HAVE ENOUGH MONEY, DON'T YOU?
ATTEMPT TO RESSURECT.
MURMUR - CHANT - PRAY - INVOKE!

         ** MEL NEEDS KADORTO NOW **
<RESET> AND RECOVER YOUR USELESS
APPORTER, NOW TEN YEARS OLDER (WHO
CARES?), AND TRY AGAIN TILL IT WORKS.
THIS CAN SAVE VALUABLE CHARACTERS FROM
THE INCOMPETENCE OF MR. CANT. THOUGH
YOU STILL PAY THE MONEY, YOU RUN NO
RISK OF LOSING YOUR HARD-EARNED
CHARACTER.

HOW TO GET INTO THOSE WEIRD ROOMS:
THESE ROOMS ARE MOSTLY ON THE SECOND
LEVEL (EXCEPT FOR THE PRIVATE ELEVATOR,
DISCUSSED LATER) THESE CAN BE ACCESSED
BY FINDING CERTAIN ITEMS, NONE OF WHICH
CAN BE IDENTIFIED. EXAMPLES:
STATUETTE OF A BEAR
STATUETTE OF FROG
GOLD KEY
SILVER KEY
BRONZE KEY
JADE FROG

(AND A FEW OTHERS THAT WE CAN'T RECALL)

THE BLUE RIBBON IS VERY IMPORTANT, BUT
DON'T TRY IT YET! SEE LATER...
MANY OF THESE ITEMS HAVE OBVIOUS
FUNCTIONS (BRONZE KEY STOPS BRONZE
MIST, ETC.)

MONSTER ALLOCATION CENTER:
THIS IS AN -EXTREMELY- DEADLY ENCOUNTER
WE ALWAYS HAD OCCASIONAL TROUBLE UNTIL
WE GOT ** TILTOWAIT!! ** (BOOM!!!)

DON'T TRY MAKANITO!!!! IT WON'T WORK!

THESE SUCKERS ARE...OH SAY.. ABOUT
7TH OR 8TH LEVEL MONSTERS!! LOOK OUT!!

IF YOU DO, HOWEVER, MAKE IT THROUGH,
GO TO THE FAR END OF THE ROOM, AND
YOU'LL GET THE BLUE RIBBON, THE KEY
TO THE REST OF THE GAME!

4TH LEVEL MONSTERS (4TH LEVEL IS LEV
"D", TRY DUMAPIC OCCASIONALLY!)

LOOK OUT FOR DRAGONFLIES, THEY ARE VERY
RESISTANT TO MAGIC!
DRAGONS BREATHE (OF COURSE)
GHOULS PARALYZE!
AND WORST YET...
SHADES ** DRAIN LEVELS **

LOOK OUT FOR TELEPORTERS, YOU'LL HAVE
ONE HELL OF A TIME FINDING YOUR WAY
BACK!!! LEAVE THESE STINKERS ALONE!

YOU HAVE NOW REACHED THE FINAL STAGE.
GO NO FURTHER IF YOU AREN'T DESPERATE
TO WIN!!!!

OK, HERE WE GO!!!

*************************************

=====================================
+ THESE HINTS ARE ONLY RECOMMENDED  +
+ FOR CHARACTERS OF AT LEAST TENTH  +
+ LEVEL (THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING) +
=====================================

THE ELEVATOR:
ONCE YOU GET THE BLUE RIBBON, YOU MAY
ENTER THE PRIVATE ELEVATOR. THIS
IS ON THE FOURTH LEVEL ("D") ON THE
OPPOSITE SIDE FROM THE CONTROL CENTER.
IT LEADS TO LEVELS 5-9 (A-F). LOOK
OUT, THE MONSTERS GET MUCH MORE
POWERFUL!

THE TENTH LEVEL:
TO GET THERE, FIRST GO TO LEVEL "F",
THEN FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS:
<RETURN> A A K D K D W W (UNTIL WALL)
D W W (UNTIL WALL), AND KEEY TAKING
RIGHT TURNS UNTIL YOU COME TO A DOOR.
GO THROUGH THE DOOR, AND HIT TWO MORE
W'S. AND..... A CHUTE.... TENTH LEVEL!

CONTRA DEXTRA AVENUE:
THE IDEA OF THIS IS THAT ONCE YOU
FINISH OFF A ROOM ON THE TENTH
LEVEL, GOING RIGHT, THEN STRAIGHT
FORWARD WILL TELEPORT YOU BACK TO
THE FIRST ENCOUNTER. SEARCH AROUND
THE REST OF THE ROOM (DON'T FORGET
THE CENTER) FOR THE FORWARD TELEPORTER.
AFTER 6 OR SO ENCOUNTER AREAS, THERE
WILL BE A ESPECIALLY LONG CORRIDOR, AND
YOU WILL FIND....

"THE LAIR OF THE EVIL WIZARD WERDNA"
    THE WIZARD IS  ** IN **
***************************************
**  THIS IS IT!! HOW TO SLAY         **
**      W  E  R  D  N  A  !  !  !    **
** NO ADMITTANCE TO CHARACTERS BELOW **
** 13TH LEVEL!!!! TURN BACK!!!!      **
***************************************

WERDNA'S LITTLE CLIQUE WILL CONSIST
OF THE FOLLOWING:
1-4 VAMPIRES
1 W E R D N A
1 VAMPIRE LORD
NOTE: VAMPIRES AND VAMPIRE LORDS ARE
"UNSEEN ENTITIES", AND WERDNA IS A
"MAN IN ROBES".  GOOD LUCK....
TRY THIS BATTLE SEQUENCE:
1) FIGHT AGAINST WERDNA
2) FIGHT AGAINST WERDNA
3 & 4 - FASTEST PRIEST CASTS MABADI ON
WERDNA, WHILST THE SLOWEST DISPELLS
(TO NO AVAIL?) TO VAMPIRES
5) SPELL: ZILWAN AT THE VAMPIRE LORD
6) SPELL: TILTOWAIT -  THIS'LL GET 1/2
THE VAMPIRES, AND 50% OF THE TIME
HITS THE VAMPIRE LORD.

--------GOOD LUCK---------

THIS GAME IS -SO- STRUCTURED THAT WE'VE
GOTTEN "A FRIENDLY GROUP OF W E R D N A
(OH BOY!)
WERDNA HAS THE AMULET, AND CAN CAST
TILTOWAIT, MABADI, OR, FOR THAT MATTER,
ANY OFFENSIVE SPELL. HE ALSO HEALS
HIMSELF. HIS STRIKE...
PARALYZES, POISONS, STONES, CRITICALS,
DRAINS 4 LEVELS, AND SLAYS.

THE AMULET:
ITS SPECIAL POWER (USE FROM E)QUIP)
IS A MADI UPON THE ENTIRE POWER. WHEN
USED, IT CASTS A MALOR. IT ACTS AS A
DOUBLE POWER RING OF HEALING UPON ITS
BEARER. ALL THESE POWERS ARE UNLIMITED.

THE PROBLEM:
WHEN ONE LEAVES THE DUNGEON, (THE ONLY
WAY OUT OF THE WERDNA AREA IS TO CAST
A MALOR (USE THE AMULET IF YOU WISH)
DURING COMBAT, TELEPORTING YOU AWAY
TO A RANDOM LOCATION.
WHEN YOU FINALLY DO GET OUT, TREBOR
TAKES THE AMULET, ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT
AND MOST OF YOUR GOLD (THAT'S WHY YOU
HAVE BEEN GIVING YOUR GOLD TO APPORTER)
AND INITIATES YOU INTO THE CHEVRON
CORPS. HE ALSO GIVES YOU..GET THIS-
*** 250,000 *** EXPERIENCE POINTS-
ALMOST ENOUGH TO ADVANCE US A LEVEL-
ENOUGH FOR YOU....
WERDNA CAN BE KILLED AN UNLIMITED # OF
TIMES.

HAVE FUN!!!!!!

HERE'S A LIST OF THE CHOICEST MAGIC THE
TENTH LEVEL HAS TO OFFER...
-----------------------------------
WEAPONS OF ALL PLUSES AND MINUSES
FROM -5 TO +5, SOME WITH ALIGNMENTS.

SAME FOR ARMOR. NOTE THAT BOLTAC WILL
BUY EVEN CURSED ITEMS THAT YOU AREN'T
EQUIPPED WITH.

SPECIAL WEAPONS & ARMOR
-----------------------
LORDS GARB (CLOTHING) - GIVES A LORD
A +10 ON HIS AC. WORTH 1 MILLION GOLD!!
DON'T TAKE THIS DOWN TO WERDNA!

+2 NEUTRAL PLATE ARMOR - THE ONLY
THING THAT DISTINGUISHES THIS ONE IS
THAT IT'S CALLED "?PLATE ARMOR"

THIEVE'S DAGGER - PROBABLY THE BEST
WEAPON  ( A ?DAGGER)  WHEN IT'S
SPECIAL POWER IS INVOKED, (DURING
EQUIPPING) IT TURNS THE USER INTO A
NINJA REGARDLESS OF ALIGNMENT,
RETAINING HIS PREVIOUS LEVEL.
UNFORTUNATELY, ALL THE EXP MUST
BE MADE UP TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
WHEN WE SAW "YOU NEED 2000000
EXPERIENCE POINTS TO MAKE UP THE NEXT
LEVEL" WE NEARLY FAINTED.

DRAGONSLAYER - (?SWORD) - DOES LOTSA
DAMAGE AGAINST DRAGONS. OTHERWISE, +1

WERE SLAYER - (?SWORD) - SAME AS ABOVE,
EXCEPT FOR THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE. ALSO
AS A +2 WEAPON.

MAGE MASHER - (?SWORD) - SAME AS ABOVE-
HANDY 'GAINST WERDNA.

CUSINART - (EITHER ?BLADE, OR ?SWORD)-
DOES AMAZING DAMAGE PERIOD.

MATAMORA (WHATEVER) BLADE - IN HANDS OF
A SAMURAI, IT DOES ABOUT 100 POINTS OF
DAMAGE PER STRIKE!!

DAGGER OF SPEED - (?DAGGER) - CAN ONLY
BE USED BY A MAGE. USELESS!!! GIVES
THEM FIRST PHYSICAL ATTACK - WOW!!
ALSO RAISES THEIR AC BY 2 - STINKS!

MACE PRO POISON - (?KNOBBED STICK) -
WE'RE NOT SURE, BUT WE -THINK- THAT
"PRO" ACTUALLY MEANS "FOR", NOT
PROTECTION, AS IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HELP.

MISC ITEMS.

JEWELLED AMULET -(?AMULET) - UNLIMITED
DUMAPICS.

AMULET OF MAKANITO - (?AMULET) -
OBVIOUS, TO SAY THE LEAST!

-THE- AMULET - (?AMULET)-SEE ABOVE

RING OF HEALING - RING OF REGENERATION-
SLOWLY HEALS IT'S WEARER. ALSO EITHER
DOES A KADORTO OR A PARTY MADI.

SILVER GLOVES - (?GLOVES) - +3
GOLDEN GLOVES - (?GLOVES) - +5

THAT'S IT!!
**************************************

AND HERE'S THE ULTIMATE IN SUPER
CHARACTERS. WHEN AN ATTRIBUTE DROPS
BELOW 0, IT RETURNS AT ** 31 **
THINK OF HOW POWERFUL THIS CHARACTER
WILL BE. UNFORTUNATELY, YTHESE
CHARACTERS MUST BE SO OLD THAT THEY
WILL CONSISTANTLY LOSE ATTRIBUTES
WHEN THEY GAIN LEVELS. ON THE OLD
VERSION, YOU CAN HIT RESET AND RECOVER
YOUR CHARACTERS, 10 YEARS OLDER (SORRY
TO THE PEOPLE WITH THE NEW SCENARIOS)
FINALLY, THEY WILL GET 31'S.
UNFPRTUNATELY, WHEN ONE CHANGES CLASS,
   ALL ATTRIBUTES ABOVE 18 ARE LOST, SO
YOUR CHARACTER IS STUCK WITH WHATEVER
HE GETS A 31 IN. FOR INSTANCE, WE HAD
TO PUT A 200 HP, 31 STRENGTH MAGE IN
THE FRONT! (STRIKING 1 TIME WITH A
DAGGER FOR 30 DAMAGE!)
