Cursor Positioning Sequences
----------------------------

Name  Sequence     Default   Description
----  --------     -------   -----------------------------------------------

CUU   ESC[PnA         1      Cursor Up Sequence: moves the cursor up Pn
                             lines at same column.  Cursor stops at the top
                             margin.

CUD   ESC[PnB         1      Cursor Down Sequence: moves the cursor down Pn
                             lines at same column.  Cursor stops at the bottom
                             margin.

CUF   ESC[PnC         1      Cursor Forward Sequence: moves the cursor right
                             Pn columns in the current line.  The cursor stops
                             at the right margin.

CUB   ESC[PnD         1      Cursor Backward Sequence: moves the cursor left
                             Pn columns in the current line.  The cursor stops
                             at the left margin.

CUP   ESC[Pl;PcH  Pl=1,Pc=1  Cursor Position: moves the cursor to line Pl,
                             column Pc.  If either the default values or 0 are
                             selected for Pl or Pc, the cursor moves to the
                             first line or the first column.

                             The numbering of lines and the ability to move
                             the cursor beyond the margins depends on the
                             origin mode selection.

HVP   ESC[Pl;Pcf  Pl=1,Pc=1  Horizontal And Vertical Position: this sequence
                             operates the same as the cursor position sequence
                             (CUP).

IND   ESCD         None      Index: mov/es the cirsor down one line in the
                             same column.  If the cursor is at the bottom
                             margin a scroll up is performed unless the screen
                             lock mode is set.  In this case, the index
                             sequence is ignored.

RI    ESCM           1       Reverse Index: moves the cursor up one line in
                             the same column.  If the cursor is at the top
                             margin, a scroll down is performed unless the
                             screen lock mode is set.  In this case, the
                             reverse index sequence is ingnored.

NEL   ESCE         None      Next Line: moves the cirsor down to the first
                             column on the next line.  If the cursor is at the
                             bottom margin, a scroll up is performed unless
                             the screen lock mode ius set.  In this case, the
                             cursor is moved to the first column on the bottom
                             line and the scroll up is not performed.

SC    ESC7         None      Save Cursor: saves the current cursor position,
                             graphics rendition (screen attributes) and
                             character set selection.

RC    ESC8         None      Restore cursor: restores the previously saved
                             cursor position, graphics rendition, and
                             set selection.  If none were saved, the cursor
                             moves to the origin.
