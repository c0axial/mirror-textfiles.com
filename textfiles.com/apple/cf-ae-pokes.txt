=======================================
O.K. HERE ARE THE LOCATIONS IN DOS THAT THE MICRON CHANGED. WHAT I AM GIVING
YOU ARE THE CORRECT POKES. I HAVE INSERED THESE IN AN EXEC FILE AFTER CAT-FUR
HANGS UP.
41177,141              41178,102
41179,170              44452,22
44605,21               44315,32
44316,182              44317,176
I AM SURE THAT ALL OF THESE ARE NOT REQUIRED, BUT I AM TOO LAZY TO TRY TO
FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE(S) ARE, SO I JUST RESET THEM ALL.
=======================================
  Quite a few of you have asked for the pokes this system is running on. Well
your wait is over, here they are.
To get AE to run with your BBS, try thison AE 4.2.
Micromodem II       Novation Apple-cat
1146,39             1146,39
1274,99             1274,99

                    248,peek(27)
                    255,peek(27)
If you want to run Cat-fur 2.2 from a BBS try these.
 254,32
2047,187
2046,X   X = The value of the access you wish to give  user. He can then only
             access the volumes where 'X' is equal or greater than the value
             stored in the file '@ACC' on that volume. All '@ACC' on The Pirate
             Chip are values of 0.
For those of you who run AE and Cat-fur from a hard drive, you may encounter
a problem where AE will not change volumes after Cat-fur is run. To overcome
this, use these.

These are the locations in DOS that The Micron changed when running Cat-fur,
these pokes should reset DOS to normal.
I hope this helps you in setting up your own system. If you find any omissions
or somthing you wish to add, PLEASE let me know.
