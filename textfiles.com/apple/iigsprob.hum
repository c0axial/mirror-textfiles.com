     Here is a little dismayig problem that has virtually made me loose
all respect n Apple all together.
     I just recently purchased my Apple //gs system with the works, including
that nice $10 muffin fan Apple sells for $50. After playing around with my
//GS for a day or two, I decided to plug a pair of headphones into the
headphone jack to hear what it sounds like. As soon as I plugged the
headphones in I noticed this terribly loud electrical hum coming through the
headhones, I pay much attention to this, thinking that it was the way it was
supposed to be.
     Last week, I bought the MD-Ideas Supersonic stereo card and promptly
hooked it up to my stereo system. Here's where the problems start. I thought
that the stereo card would solve the hum problem, but no such luck, the hum
was even louder and more annoying as ever. I promptly called up MD-Ideas, and
they told me that the problem was caused by the //gs fan, that is why their
fan sits on the outside of the //gs and runs on its own power supply. Then, I
proceeded to call up my Apple Dealer (B.C. Communications in Huntington L.I.)
and the owner told me that, "Oh, I have encountered this problem before, that
is why Apple doesn't make an amplifier for the //gs".
     Well, I hardly took this explaination seriously and called up Apple
Customer Relations in C.A., they put me in touch with their technical support
line, and I got an answer...Here it is: "We can't do anything about it, they
all have this problem, we suggest that you unhook the fan and leave the cover
off the machine".  I told them that unhooking the fan would void my warranty
since I have more than 3 peripheral cards plugged in, they responded with an
"We know it voids the warranty but nothing can be done."
      It can hardly be beleived that Apple would put out an overpriced product
that works halfway and not be willing to fix it or at least offer our money
back. If we use it with the fan hooked up, we can't fully enjoy our machines,
if we use it without the fan, we void the warranty and risk having to pay
Apple's overpriced repair bills. Please protest the bit of shamefull behavior
and DON'T buy the //GS fan from Apple, and if you allready have, demand a fix
or your money back!
       After all, the "S" in "Apple IIGS" stands for sound doesn't it? Or
maybe to Apple the "S" stands for swindle...
