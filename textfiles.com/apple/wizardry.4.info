I have been so busy lately I haven't been able to play but I have alreadry
mapped every level so i can answer most of your questions.

First of all, you don't throw anything into the gates of hell, you break them
down, enter, and get the Jeweled Fruit from the Tree of Fire.  To do so you
must use the Bell, Book, and Candle to break down the Gates, the Boots of
Flying to be able to get back out. I have been able to get all the way out
since a blast of fire gets me at the end.  I suspect I need to get the Blood
Blue Special (you know what I mean) to do that.

Second, you need to put the Bloodstone and the Dragon thing after evoke into
the Altar, the third item I haven't found but I suspect it is the Drmpainters
soul that you get after you put the third item in so it is probably the Jeweled
Fruit that you need (see above).

As for Trebor, you don't find him, he finds you .  Instant death.

If anyone finds the six item needed for the blue blood special tell me please (
I may start p[laying again)

As for Dondra, to get out of the first room you.  Get key.  Open south door.
Kick key south. Go South, Get key, Go North, Go North, Say Death to Colnar,
Insert Key in Keyhole, North, Say Death to Colnar, go north, read mural, go
south, go west.  You are out in the world now.  Have fun.
