Hello, with the release of ProTERM v1.9p (only a few steps from 2.0) there have
been a couple of noted problems and concerns.

Number 1; It still does not have an USRobotics HST driver in the configuration
        program.  Well this problem has already been solved.  Myers (of The
        9600 Club) re-wrote the drivers to work correctly.  I just put up the
        Super Serial Card one, the Modem Port one is done but I have yet to
        upload it.  They both work.  Remember the patch for v1.2 will not work
        with v1.9p.  Don't bother trying it, their formats are different.

Number 2; The editor DOES work.  It can save text/appleworks format (and it
        works fine)  It is extremely radical.  I like it better than Appleworks
        The editor is version 2.0, the program is v1.9p. (like I said, only
        a few steps away)

Number 3; Greg has fixed many upsetting things in proterm.  For example,
        when dialing after a few seconds if your modem doesn't connect
        for whatever reason it will keep that boards' dial screen there.
        (instead of returning you to the board list)

Number 4; It supports Y-modem CRC when downloading.  This will not speed
        anything up, but will have better error checking.  Transit finally
        works.  It fairly fast too!

Number 5; ** THE MOST IMPORTANT ** ProTERM supports mousetext and a sound
        generator, this is a terminal emulation.  Like VT-100 and Datamedia
        are.  This is UNREAL!!

        What is mousetext?  Remember when you got your //e enhanced about
        a year ago?  And Appleworks could show like open and closed Apples at
        the main menu!  This will revolutionize bulletin boards.

        ONLY WITH PROTERM V1.9 - V2.0
        -----------------------------

        The Sound Generator --> Supports pitch, tempo, tone. It is feasible
        to actually write a song that could be sent over the phone to the
        person on the other end.

        ITS TERMINAL EMULATION:  ProTERM Special, so configure your system to
        that.

        Compatibility: Semi-compatible with Datamedia 1500.  It uses
                        the same hi and lo lite control characters (inverse)
                        left, right, down are the same.  The rest are all
                        different. (except for control-g of course)

(*note: the up control character is ^K (just like the arrows))

        The Future: You'll be using your mouse pretty soon if Greg keeps
                this up.  Learn to use these radical terminal emulations,
                you'll find boards can and will be MUCH better.

        The First: The first board in the world supports mousetext/ProTERM
                special emulation.

Thank you very much, this is very important.  Would you like to use mousetext
and the sound generator in your system?  I will release a text file soon with
all the compatible control characters.

ProTERM special emulation is powerful):  Ralph Kramden

And the person on line while I figured it out: Sound Wave, thanks for the
moral support. (haha)
