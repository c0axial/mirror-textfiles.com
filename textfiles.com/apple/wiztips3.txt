         THE KOD ITEMS
         -------------

TO GET TO SOME OF THE KOD ITEMS, MALOR
DIRECTLY UP FROM OUTSIDE THE RIDDLE
ROOM IN THE 6TH LEVEL, OR DIRECTLY DOWN
FROM GNILDA ON THE 1ST LEVEL. KEEP YOUR
RIGHT PINKIE ON THE RESET KEY THOUGH
BECOUSE THIS DOES NOT APPLY FOR ALL
LEVELS. TO GET TO THOSE, FIND THE WAY
FROM THE LEVELS YOU CAN GET TO.

***************************************
**  THANKS TO TCV728 FOR GETTING US  **
**     STARTED ON THESE METHODS      **
***************************************

---------------------------------------

AT THE MOMENT, THIS CAN ONLY BE USED
ON THE PROVING GROUNDS SCENARIO. JUST
TRANSFER THE CHARACTERS TO KOD IF YOU
WISH. KOD METHOD COMING SOON...

THIS PROCESS CAN BE HAZARDOUS TO THE
HEALTH OF YOUR WIZARDRY DISK...
       +-------------------+
       !   MAKE A BACKUP   !
       +-------------------+

IF YOU DON'T HAVE LOCKSMITH 4, THEN
YOU MUST EITHER TAKE A CHANCE OR HIT
CTRL-P AND GIVE UP.

HERE'S HOW TO MAKE A BACKUP COPY:
IT MUST BE DONE W/LS4
(DON'T TRY NA][)

TRACKS 0-9 NORMAL
TRACKS F-22 NORMAL
TRACKS A-E SYNC: 36=01
       OR
TRACK 0:36=1, 21=02, 46=96
TRACKS 1-22 SYNC: 36=00
(NOTE: BOTH OF THESE REQUIRE NIBBLE
COUNTING. CONSULT YOUR MANUAL)

HEREIN, WE SHALL DIRECTLY EDIT YOUR
WIZARDRY CHARACTERS. THIS INCLUDES MOST
THINGS OF YOUR CHARACTER.
BESIDES LS4, YOU WILL NEED A GOOD
SECTOR EDITOR. WE USED NA][, BUT DISK
ZAP, DISK FIXER OR THE LIKE WILL DO.

BE VERY CAREFUL AND DOUBLE CHECK
EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU WRITE IT TO DISK.

IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU START OFF WITH
A FRESH DISK ((M)AKE SCENARIO).


  1) CREATE A CHAR W/A NAME 9 LETTERS
LONG.
  2) NOW, BREAK OUT THE SECTOR EDITOR.
YOUR CHARACTER WILL BE LOCATED ON
EITHER TRACKS 1D, 1E, OR 1F.  THE FIRST
CHARACTER ON A SCENARIO IS LOCATED ON
TRACK 1D, SECTOR D. FIND THE CHARACTERS
NAME BY COVERTING THE BYTES ON THE
SECTOR TO THEIR ASCII COUNTERPARTS.
WE WILL USE THE BYTE AFTER THE NAME AS
A REFERENCE POINT.
  3) STARTING WITH THE EIGHTH BYTE
AFTER THE NAME, YOU WILL FIND THE CHARS
PASSWORD. CHANGE IF YOU WISH AND WRITE
TO DISK. CONSULT APPLE MANUALS FOR
ASCII EQUIVALENT VALUES.
  4) AT THE 24TH BYTE AFTER THE NAME
YOU WILL FIND YOUR RACE.THE VALUES ARE:

      $01=HUMAN
      $02=ELF
      $03=DWARF
      $04=GNOME
      $05=HOBBIT
ANY OTHER VALUE WILL GIVE YOU
"NORACE".
CHANGE IF YOU WISH.
  5) AT THE 26TH BYTE AFTER THE NAME
YOU WILL FIND YOUR CLASS: THE VALUES
ARE:

     $00=FIGHTER
     $01=MAGE
     $02=PRIEST
     $03=THIEF
     $04=BISHOP
     $05=SAMURAI
     $06=LORD
     $07=NINJA
CHANGE IF YOU WISH.
  6) AT THE 30TH BYTE AFTER THE NAME
YOU WILL FIND YOUR AGE. NOTE: THESE #'S
ARE IN HEXADECIMAL (BASE 16) MAKE YOUR
CHAR 0 YEARS OLD BY ENTERING $00 FOR
THIS VALUE.
  7) AT THE 32ND BYTE AFTER THE NAME
YOU WILL FIND YOUR ALIGNMENT. THE
VALUES ARE:

     $01=GOOD
     $02=NEUTRAL
     $03=EVIL
ANY OTHER VALUE WILL GIVE YOU "NO
ALIGNMENT". CHANGE IF YOU WISH.

  8) AT THE 34TH BYTE AFTER THE NAME,
YOU WILL FIND THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE
CHAR. CHANGE THIS, AND THE NEXT 6 BYTES
TO $FF. THIS WILL GIVE YOU 31'S IN ALL
ATTRIBUTES.

  9) AT THE 42ND BYTE AFTER TH NAME,
YOU WILL FIND THE GOLD REGISTER. CHANGE
THIS, AND THE NEXT 7 BYTES TO $FF. THIS
WILL GIVE YOU 100010001 GOLD.

  10) AT THE 122ND BYTE AFTER THE NAME,
YOU WILL FIND YOUR LEVEL. CHANGE IT TO
$FF AND THE NEXT BYTE TO $7F. THIS WILL
MAKE YOU 32,767TH LEVEL. THIS IS THE
MAXIMUM.

  11) AT THE 124TH BYTE YOU WILL FIND
HP. CHANGE THIS TO $FF AND THE NEXT
BYTE TO $7F. THIS WILL GIVE YOU
32,767 HP.

  12) AT THE 126TH BYTE AFTER THE NAME,
YOU WILL FIND THE STATUS HP. CHANGE
THIS TO $FF AND THE NEXT BYTE TO $7F.

  13) AT THE 114TH BYTE AFTER THE NAME,
YOU WILL FIND THE EXPERIENCE. CHANGE IT
AND THE NEXT 3 BYTES TO $FF. THIS IS
NOT NECESSARY, BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE
THE MAXIMUM LEVEL. ANY HIGHER INVOKES
A BUG WHEREBY YOU ARE LEVEL -32,767.

  14) AT THE 128TH BYTE AFTER THE NAME,
IS THE SPELLS IN YOUR SPELL BOOK.
CHANGE IT, AND THE NEXT 7 BYTES TO $FF.
THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO CAST
ALL MAGE AND PRIEST SPELLS.

  15) AT THE 136TH BYTE AFTER THE NAME,
YOU WILL FIND THE NUMBER OF EACH SPELL.
START WITH THIS BYTE AND ENTER $FF
THEN $7F FOURTEEN TIMES (THIS WILL LOOK
LIKE FF 7F FF 7F FF 7F ETC. IT WILL
TAKE UP 28 BYTES IN ALL). THIS WILL
PROVIDE YOU WITH:

MAGE SPELLS:32767/32767/32767/32767/327
PRIEST SPELLS:32767/32767/32767/32767/3

GET THE PICTURE?


WE HAVE FOUND THE AC BYTE, BUT IT IS
RE-COMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU GO INTO THE
DUNGEON, THUS A CHANGE WOULD BE FUTILE.
OH WELL....



WE HAVE FOUND THE ITEM REGISTERS BUT
HAVE NOT FOUND OUT HOW TO UTILIZE THEM.
EVENTUALLY THOUGH WE WILL BE ABLE TO
GIVE YOU THE KOD ITEMS AND THE STAFF
OF GNILDA.

HAVE FUN!!!
