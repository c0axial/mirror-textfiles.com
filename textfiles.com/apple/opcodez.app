
     OK,
	  This is Rich again.  I found those Op. Codes for you.  If you need any
     of the other material on them, they are in the 18th issue of Hardcore
     Computist.  Other than this list of Op. Codes, all there is on the 65c02 is
     a Question/Answer section.

          So here's the list:

          That's the best I can do.  There were no further articles on the
     Instructions.  I hope it helps you out.  Catch you later.
