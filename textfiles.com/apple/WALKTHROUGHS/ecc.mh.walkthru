The title screen opens by showing the invasion of New York City.  Press ENTER
or the SPACE BAR to bypass the title screen.

Your adventure begins two years after the alien invasion.  It is your first day
on the job.  You are rudely awakened by the sector's supervising orb, who gives
instructions for your first day's assignment.

                   " Attention Manhunter! There was an explosion
                     at Bellevue Hospital! Investigate. "

Press ENTER when you are ready to proceed.  (Note: In most situations, the
Spacebar will perform the same functions as ENTER.)  Your character gets out of
bed and turns on the lights.  He takes his Manhunter Assignment Device (MAD)
and turns it on.  The computer reads "ALERT".  Press ENTER.  The computer
responds, "TRACKER has locked on Target.  Location: Bellevue Hospital."  Press
ENTER.

The yellow target is the person you are currently tracking.  Remember to always
watch where the targets go and what they do.  When the computer is finished
tracking, you will receive a message.  The computer reads, "Target signal lost.
Tracking terminated." Press ENTER.

Select TRACKER again.  After the target leaves the hospital, you will zoom out
to see the target as it travels on the city map.  Press C to close the
computer.

You are now viewing the travel map.  Locations you are authorized to
investigate are indicated by a blinking square.  Your current location is
indicated by an X.  The blue/red circle is your marker.

Trace the path of your target to investigate the locations he has visited.  To
go to Bellevue Hospital, move the marker down until it hits the bottom of the
screen.  The screen will flip to reveal the next portion of the map.  You will
see Bellevue Hospital blinking.  Position the marker over the hospital blinker.
Press ENTER to travel there.

Now you are standing in front of Bellevue Hospital.  Move your marker around
the screen to reveal various messages. Position the marker near the bottom of
the right wall and it will change into an arrow.  Press ENTER.

You are now standing where the target bombed the wall of the hospital. Press
ENTER to go inside.

Position the marker over the toe of the corpse and press ENTER.  Take note of
the victim's name (Reno Davis).  You may press ENTER to back out of view.

Next, position the marker over the corpse's face and press ENTER. Watch this
scene until the baby orbs attack your face.

Note: You can avoid death by pressing ENTER to back out of this view just
before the orbs eat your face.

After you die a message will be displayed.  Press ENTER to return to the game.
You are now outside the hospital again.  Press the TAB key to display you
inventory.  Select MAD.  Select INFO.  Type: Reno Davis.  Press ENTER. Select
EXIT.

Select TRACKER.  You may watch the target at the hospital again or press S to
skip ahead to watch you target's movements after departing the hospital.

Watch the target travel through the city.  The TRACKER will zoom in to Trinity
Church.  After the target leaves the church, press C to close the computer.

Move the marker down to the location of the Trinity Church.  Press ENTER to
travel to the church.

Position the marker over the front door of the church.  Press ENTER.

Position the marker over the matches and the marker changes into a hand.  Press
ENTER to take a match.

The marker changes into a match.  Position the marker over a candle wick. Press
ENTER to light the candle.

NOTE: Later in the game you will receive a clue on what you should do at this
location.

Select MAD from your inventory.  You will receive a message that the signal is
too weak. Maybe you should go outside to use it. Press ENTER to continue. Press
ENTER to back out of this scene.  Press ENTER again to leave the church.

Select MAD from inventory.  Select TRACKER.

Watch the church scene again or press S to skip.

The TRACKER proceeds to a bar in North Brooklyn.  Watch where the target goes
once he has entered the bar.  When the target leaves, press C to close the
computer.

Find North Brooklyn and travel to the bar.

Position the marker over the door and press ENTER.

Position the marker over the video game at the left side of the room and press
ENTER to play the game.  You will be interrupted by an unfriendly group of bar
patrons.  Watch the scene until it is your turn to throw the knives at the
bartender.  The object is to land a knife between each of his fingers (four
total) without missing.  Press ENTER to throw a knife.

Throw a knife outside of the hand area.  You will be thrown oustside.  Go back
inside and position the marker over the knife table.  Press ENTER.  This time,
throw a knife and hit a finger.

After you die, press ENTER to try again.  Aim carefully, and you will soon be
successful.

After winning the contest, watch carefully the signal that the bartender gives
you.  This will prove useful later.

Now that you have proved your skills to the thugs, you will be able to play the
video game undisturbed.

Press ENTER to play the video game.  Read the instructions.

To move your character through the video game, use arrow keys (left, right, up
and down).

Now you are on your own!  Good luck on your adventure!

Hint:  Be sure to watch for clues as you play Manhunter.  Many objects in
       the game have symbolic significance, and may be useful for more than one
       purpose.  Keep an eye out for strange or unusual things that may occur
       in the game.
