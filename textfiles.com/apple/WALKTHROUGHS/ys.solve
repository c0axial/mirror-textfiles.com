 ANCIENT LAND OF YS
 BRIEFING

 The ANCIENT LAND OF YS is an animated CRPG much like Sierra's QUEST series,
with the added feature of fighting battles to earn experience (e.g. hit points)
and gold. To battle the opposition, you must "collide" with them. The damage you

inflict, as well as the damage you receive, is determined by the type of Sword,
Shield, and Armor that you hold. As in many games, you have a hit point total
that increases to a maximum as you gain experience.

 The story revolves around the evil wizard Malificus who has stolen the six
Books of Ys. In doing so, Malificus has unleashed all kinds of evil creatures
which roam the Land of Ys, terrorizing the inhabitants. Within these Books is
the secret of the magic metal Kureria. Learning this secret and obtaining the
six Books of Ys is what is required for you to complete the game.

 You can save your game as many times as you like, each time naming the file to
be saved on your disk. The files are stored as a NAME.DAT file, where NAME is
your name for the save. It is a good idea to save your game after every major
event. This will help you later if you find you're missing something.

 This game is not extremely difficult and can be done in a relatively short
time. Throughout the game you are required to battle the evil creatures that
Malificus has sent out into the Land of Ys. The best way to defeat these
creatures is to come up from behind them and "run into them." If you meet them
head on, you'd better have ample armor and shields. Defeating these creatures
earns you gold and experience. As your experience increases, your hit point
total will increase.

 In key areas of the game, you will come upon the LARGE creatures. Be sure to
save your game before you take one of these guys on. The best way to defeat them

is to come up underneath them. These battles may get frustrating because unlike
the normal creatures you'll encounter, these sequences are more like arcade
battles. Try to evade them until you have a chance to attack.

 PLAYING GROUNDS

 There are five main areas in the Land of Ys:

 1. THE TOWN: This is where you start the game. In the town you'll find the
Fortune Teller's Shop, Weapons Shop, Armor Shop, Clinic, Bruis's Bar, and Pawn
Shop. There are also many people to speak with. Speak to the people by running
into them head on.

 2. THE LAND: There are three sections of open land with which to contend. When
you exit the town, you'll find yourself in the first land area. This is where
you will have your first battles to earn gold and experience. From here, you
cross the river via a bridge to the second section of land area. Here you'll
find a lake, many trees, and (in the northern section) the entrance to the old
silver mine. To the east of this area is the Zepic Village. To the north lies
the road up the mountain to the Shrine and the Tower.

 3. THE SILVER MINE: The silver mine consists of three levels, ending at the
vault at the bottom.

 4. THE HOLY SHRINE: The shrine sits atop the mountain north of the Zepic
Village. There are four levels in the shrine.

 5. THE TOWER: The Tower lies even further up the mountain beyond the thieves
house. You cannot enter here until you've collected three of the Books of Ys.

 FINAL NOTES

 1. There are many tasks in this game which can be done in a different sequence
than that presented in this walkthru. This walkthru assumes that the order in
which the tasks are presented is followed.

 2. This walkthru is based on the IBM version of the game. Other formats may
contain slight variations or be entirely different.

 IN TOWN AND ON THE SURFACE

 You paid your bucks, booted the game, and now you find yourself planted near
the entry gates of the town in the ANCIENT LAND OF YS. Check in your pockets and

you'll find $1,000 in spending loot. Explore the town, and enter all the open
buildings. The buildings that are closed are of no consequence to the game.

 As you explore you'll find the Fortune Teller's Shop, Armory, Weapons Shop,
Clinic, Tavern, and Pawn Shop. Speak with all the people you meet. You do this
by running head first into them. The Fortune Teller will tell you to come back
when you're ready to become a knight. To do so, go to the Armory and Sword Shops

and purchase a Sword, Shield, and Armor. Equip these items and return to the
Fortune Teller. You'll receive a mission and a Crystal. Now you're ready to
venture outside the gates to do battle with the evil creatures running wild
throughout the land.

 You will earn experience and gold by defeating the creatures in the fields. The

best way to battle all the creatures in the Land of Ys is to run into them from
above, behind, or below. Don't try to hit them head on, or you'll soon be
restoring your game.

 Explore the grassy area north of the castle, slaying beasts as you go. Cross
the bridge to the east and wander the land there. You might stumble across the
entrance to the old Mine, but don't go in yet: You're not equipped to take on
the creatures within.

 If you're lucky, you may find the Golden Amulet in the lake. This can be sold
in the pawn shop for quick cash. If you continue through an opening in the trees

to the east, you'll come to the Zepic Village. There are three houses there. One

is closed and useless to you. The other two are the Church and the home of the
Fortune Teller's Aunt Mara.

 In the church, you'll learn that the Silver Bells have been stolen. If you
visit Mara with the Crystal given to you by Sara, she'll give you a Holy Shrine
Key. North of the Zepic Village there is a path going up the mountain to the
Holy Shrine and further up to the Thieves' Shack. Once again, wait until you can

afford better armor before entering the Holy Shrine.

 Continue battling until you can upgrade you shield, sword, and armor to the
next level. Once this is done, explore the Holy Shrine. When you first enter,
you'll see six statues. One is different! Run into it and you'll be inside on
level 1. Search the area to locate two chests: One is locked, but the other
contains a Ruby Ring. You won't be able to open the other chest yet.

 Further exploration reveals a room with an ornate decoration on the far wall.
Touching the center of this design triggers a battle with the first of the
"large" creatures you'll discover in the Land of Ys. To defeat him, you must
dodge the beams and collide with him. You'll need quick fingers on the arrow
keys to win. Once you've disposed of him, a secret entrance will open where the
decoration was. This leads to the second level of the Holy shrine. Go through
the door and explore level two. Once again you'll find two chests. This time,
they'll both be locked. Become familiar with this level, noting the two jail
cells in the northeast section, then return to Town to return the Ruby Ring. Go
back to the fields and continue fighting the creatures.

 At this point, save the game and try the first level of the Mine. There are
fierce creatures that guard the entrance. Go in quickly and turn to the right.
Try to attack these creatures by hitting them from behind. If you learn to
defeat these beasts, you'll be rewarded with big bucks and experience. Once you
get the hang of defeating these foes, you'll find it easier to fight the more
difficult "small" creatures in the game.

 Try and earn enough money to buy the third level of Shield, Sword and Armor.
Stop by the pawn shop and buy a Mirror and a Wing. It also would be a good idea
to pick up a bottle of medicine (Heal Potion) at the infirmary. With all these
goodies in tow, head back to the Holy Shrine.

 HOLY SHRINE: LOWER LEVELS

 Return to the Holy Shrine and go through the secret door to level two. Head
towards the extreme lower left hallway. You'll be at what appears to be a dead
end...but! Try and walk down, as if you're walking through the wall. Suddenly
you'll pass through a doorway that was out of view! Continue down the hallway
and explore the areas to the right. Check out all the chests. You'll find a Jail

Key, and more importantly, a Treasure Chest Key! If you continue your search,
there is also a chest containing Silver Bells.

 Return to the surface and give the bells back to the priest in the church.
He'll give you a Power Ring as a reward. Return to the Holy Shrine and open all
the chests you found along the way. You will find Ring Mail, the Mask of Eyes,
and a Necklace. On your way back down, enter the two jail cells and free the
hostage you'll find there. She'll get out on her own; just continue with the
game after you speak with her. Go back through the hidden doorway and continue
down to the next level.

 Here you'll encounter more statues like the one you found at the entrance.
Check the place out and you'll find an Ivory Key, a bottle of Heal Potion, and a

Silver Shield (level 4 shield) which you should immediately use. You may notice
a chest that you can't quite seem to get to. Use your Mask of Eyes to find a
doorway previously unseen, and enter the secret area. The chest holds a Marble
Key to the bottom level of the Holy Shrine. Save your game before you enter the
bottom chamber, and battle the next "large" creature to get to the Book of
Mendal. Use your Wing to return to Town.

 BACK IN TOWN AND THE MINE

 When you check back with Sara, you'll receive some sad news. You'll also
receive the Book of Toban. Restock your Heal Potion supply (if necessary), and
head for the Mine. You can sell the Necklace you found in the Holy Shrine if you

need money.

 Enter the Mine and explore the first level. There you'll find three chests. If
you've already found the Ruby Ring in the Holy Shrine, one of the chests will be

empty. The other two contain a Time Ring and Silver Armor (level 4 armor).

 In the southeast corner of the Mine, you'll find an almost-hidden passage to
the south that will lead to level two. Explore level two until you find a cave
which is guarded by a one-eyed rock creature. He is protecting a chest in the
cave. To get him to come out, you must walk directly in front of him. Once he's
out, you must get him from behind or you'll be history! There are more of these
creatures in this area; saving the game is a good idea.

 In the cave is a chest containing a Heal Ring. Wear this immediately and your
hit points will increase over time like they do on the surface. Search this

level thoroughly. If you find the entrance to level three, don't enter yet.
There are two chests that you must find before you descend any further. They
contain the Silver Harmonica and a Seed of Rodine. When you have these two
items, use the Wing to return to Town.

 Give the Silver Harmonica to its owner, and return to the Mine. On your way,
stop by the northern-most large tree in the Fields across the bridge. If you run

into the center of this tree, it will tell you where to find a sword made of
Kureria. This is one of the most important clues in the game! When you go to
find the sword, you'll get a Silver Sword! That should tell you something. Now,
back to the Mine.

 Once in the Mine, go straight to level 3. Save your game often because the
battles are tough. Search the level for the two chests containing a Heal Potion
and the Key of Daan. At the very bottom of the level is a locked door. Save your

game before entering. Inside the vault is a chest. When you try to open it, the
next "large" creature will appear. If you don't have the Kureria (Silver) Sword,

this creature is very difficult to kill. Once you polish him off you can open
the chest and take the Book of Towala.

 If you've gotten everything listed above from the cave, use the Wing to return
to Town. Buy some Heal Potion if you need it and head to the Zepic Village and
Mara's house. She will read the books for you and tell you how to enter the
Tower.

 THE TOWER

 The Tower is a circular building that, once entered, cannot be exited without
completing the game. The center of the Tower consists of circular, columned
hallways that look the same on all levels.

 After passing through the Thieves' Shack, you enter the Tower. The first level
has three exit hallways, all leading to a circular, columned hallway. The right
hallway leads to a dead-end level containing four chests. In them you'll find
Heal Potion, a Mirror, and the Evil Ring. Don't wear the Evil Ring yet. One
chest is empty. Return through the circular hallway to the entry level. The left

exit leads to the jail level. The middle exit leads up to the second level of
the Tower.

 As you pass through this level, you'll find a hallway with a line of statues.
Use your Mask of Eyes to find the secret entrance. Upon entering, you'll find an

old man who won't talk to you. It seems he's lost a valuable Idol. Leave him,
and continue up to level three.

 Here you'll find an open chest. Keep going, through another circular hallway to

the fourth level. This level has three exits. You came in from the right; the
center leads to a dead-end level with an empty chest; the top left exit leads
up. When you enter the fifth level, you will pass through a metal detector that
senses your silver. You now find yourself back on the jail level -- in jail,
minus your silver. Here you find Ota, the husband of the wife you spoke with in
the Zepic Village. He'll tell you of a secret passageway in the Tower. As you
search the jail cell, Ogien will break through the walls to rescue you. He'll
also give you an Idol to return to the old man you found earlier. Make sure you
re-equip your level 3 sword, shield, and armor before you leave. (Remember: Your

level 4 items, being silver, were confiscated.)

 Leave the jail cell, and again climb the Tower, returning the Idol to the old
man on the way up. The old man will give you a Necklace. This one you can wear.
Since you've lost all your silver, you can now pass through the metal detector

on level 5. Go up to level 6 and you'll run into Ogien again. He'll tell you
that you need a Rod to enter the upper levels of the Tower. You should also find

a chest with a Silver Sword! Continue upwards and enter level 7. Save your game!

Yes, another "large" creature awaits you. Defeating him will net you a Hammer
and the Book of Zakan. Continue up to Level 8 where you'll reclaim the Silver
Shield.

 Level 9 contains the Sound Room. First, though, there's an exit to the left
that goes to a dead-end level with Ogien in it. He's of no help here...yet! Back

into level 9, you'll proceed until you enter the Sound Room. You should quickly
run into the first door you come to and find the old man. He'll tell you the
reason behind the sound. From your inventory, select the Heal Potion. Run out of

his room, to the right, and just before your hit points disappear, press return.

This will activate the Heal Potion. Run through the doorway and into the next
circular hallway. Use your Hammer and hit all the columns on that level. Save
the game, then try to enter level 10. If the sound continues, quit the game, and

return to your system prompt. Restart the game and restore your last save. You
should be able to enter level 10 now. (There might be a bug in the software
here.)

 Level 10 is empty, but level 11 is important. This is the first level with
magic mirrors. This level has three exits at the top. You came in from the
middle; the right exit leads to a dead-end level with an old man. He will tell
you of a girl being held captive in another Tower. The left exit leads to a
dead-end level with another "large" creature. Save the game, battle the
creature, and claim the Rod and the Book of Malaks.

 Return to the Mirror Level (11) and you'll find the Silver Armor. Level 12 has
two chests: One is empty, the other contains the Battle Shield. There is an exit

over to another Tower where the girl is. In order to get past the locked door to

get to the girl, you must be wearing the Evil Ring and the Necklace. Once
inside, the girl will give you special Glasses that enable you to read the Books

of Ys. She will also tell you that Malificus wears a black cape which can only
be pierced by a sword mode of Kueria.

 Proceed up to the next level (13), where you will find a chest with Heal
Potion. This is an important bottle because you now have to go back down the
Tower to where you last found Ogien (the level before the Sound Room). Enter the

room where Ogien is, read the Book of Malaks, then speak to Ogien. He will give
you a Blue Amulet. Go back up to Level 13.

 From level 13 (the second time), continue up to level 14. There are three exits

here. You came in through the middle exit. The right exit leads to a Temple
level where you'll find Battle Armor. The left exit continues up to Level 15.
When you enter Level 15, you'll have to battle some tough guards who'll come
bursting through a wall. If you go through that wall, you'll find the Flame
Sword.

 Level 16 is another "Mirror" level, and leads to another battle with a "large"
creature. These are Twin Heads. Once you've defeated the heads, you're ready to
face Malificus. Enter the top level and defeat Malificus to win the game.
Remember, to defeat Malificus, you must be equipped with a Kueria sword. When
battling Malificus, keep moving and trying to anticipate where he'll be. He's
moving in a sine-wave pattern. Those players who don't like arcade sequences may

have difficulty with this battle. It is, however, doable.
