Starts: first you must have your party outside of the camp and "save the game " <very important!!>

then put in your Copy II + (or any other disk editor).
go to the characters are on the following sectors

               T21 - S6  (one character)
               T21 - S7  ( 2  character)
               T21 - S8        //
               T21 - S9        //

the Staz on the disk are in same order for every sectors
(thank goodness, this make my job easier!)

the first character on every sectors starts at Byte 00
and second character starts on Bytes 80. I'm only going to
give you the edit on the first character, you can figure
out the second character by your self, its the same thing
but on different places.

   Byte    |     effect      |   Byte    |    effect      |
===========================================================
  00-0F    |      NAME       |  10-14    | ST,IQ,DE,CO,LK |
  15-17    |      EXP        |    18     |   EXP ????     |*
  19-1B    |      GOLD       |    1C     |   GOLD ????    |*
   1D      |  CURRENT LEVEL  |    1F     |old lev,If drain|
  21-22    |HP starts at B-22|  23-24    | Max Hit points |
 ==========================================================

   *  Gold and Exp: I think it's 4 pairs of Hex, but I
      alway edit the first digits and keep on raise my magic
     users' level entil he's a archmage. by the way, if you
     want a Chronomencers, you'll have to give up all the 
    spells he knows before he can become one. still, if you
    don't  have a chronomencers, you can't cast space 
     teleport spell.

the rest info are on items, a characters can carry up
 to 12 items.  for the following bytes.
 30-21   33-35   36-38   39-3b   3c-3e   3f-41
 42-44   45-47   48-4a   4b-4d   4e-50   51-53

     the items are a bit tricky, there are 3 pairs of hexes,
the first hexes are for equip or not equip that's
either  00 or 01. but on some music instruments the hex turns to 04 so I would just put a 00 for all the stuffs. and
"trade" the stuff when I starts the game, the computer will
fix it.

     the second hex are the item name.  (see list)

     the third hex are the charges the items have, since some items have no charges, so I just put FF on the items
so, they'll have unlimited charges.


     the following lists are the items. if you want it in your backpack, just put that hex.(on second pair!see above)
for example  if I want a Soul Mace, and the item number is 
42, I'll put  00 42 FF which stands for (unequip, Soul mace,
no limited use).
