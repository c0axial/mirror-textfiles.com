---------------------------------------

The Legacy of Llylgamyn -- Wizardry III

I will try to develop it from the bottom up, so if you just want to  see
early  stuff, and solve the rest yourself, then just make sure you abort
this message in time!  if you don't want any  giveaways,  you  shouldn't
have been reading this far. 

1.  Starting  out. As with the knight of diamonds, you cannot create new
characters in L of L; they must be transferred in. There are  no  posted
"minimum  level"  suggestions,  however there is a reason for this. When
you first transfer a character over, you will find that you  cannot  use
him/her in a party; the character is "only a memory". To be used in L of
L,  each  character  must  undergo the "rite of passage" which will turn
him/her into a Legacy. To do this, enter the training grounds,  call  up
the character by name, then enter "r". 

Whoops!   now  you've done it!  you see, putting a character through the
rite of passage does the following to him/her:  if it had more than  500
g.p., it now has exactly 500. All equipment is taken away. It is now 1st
level,  with  appropriate  hit  points, spells, etc. (you do get to keep
stats close to what you had, with random variations). This would make it
ideal to create a new character  in  mad  overlord,  then  transfer  it,
right?   wrong. A character with beginning stats, and less than 500 g.p.
Is going to have it <very rough> in L of  L.  At  least  give  him  some
money; that may be enough to survive. 

The  ideal  party composition when first starting out in L of L is three
fighter types and three bishops!  you will need  all  the  katino's  and
dios's  you  can  muster to survive your first few expeditions. Once you
have a few characters up around  third  level,  the  rest  will  have  a
chance. 

Some  cheats  to  speed  things  up:   L  of L does not prevent you from
transferring characters in and out; just new ones need  to  undergo  the
rite  of  passage. Magic items are not transferrable (different coding),
but gold is. This means that you can have a character undergo  the  rite
of  passage,  transfer  it to Wizardry I or II, get bundles of gold, and
transfer it back. There's not as much to buy, but it's a start. Also, if
the character is a bishop,  you  can  turn  it  into  a  superbishop  in
wizardry 1, then send him/her back to L of L with full abilities! 

Let's  see,  you've  got  your party with three fighter types (fighters,
lords, samurai, or ninja -- or conceivably a thief) and three bishops. A
quick, but dangerous, way to get experience  is  to  take  on  the  moat
monsters  at the dark fortress. By all means, use katino (one per round)
on them, and be ready to heal during melee; they hit hard! 

Interesting features of level 1: the room  you  start  out  in  has  two
obvious  doors.  There  are  also  two secret doors (next to the obvious
ones); each opens on a  sandy  beach  with  an  island  visible  in  the
distance.  The  island  is  in  the  ne  corner  of  the  8-square  lake
(6e-7e,6n-7n), but that's about all you can do about it at  the  moment,
since  there's  a lake in your way ("you're at the water's edge; go back
or you'll drown!"; you are automatically pushed back when you  see  this
message). 

Until  you're  ready  for  the  island, your best bet is to initially go
east. You find a 20' long corridor, ending in a door on the south.  When
you  get to it, you see a sign reading "barracks"; irrelevant, except to
tell you you're going the right way. Kick the door, turn east, kick  the
door,  turn  south, kick the door, turn west, kick, kick. Ah ha! another
message!  this  time,  you're  at  a  dark  fortress;  "beware  of  moat
monsters",  sayeth  the sign.  Indeed, beware. You are about to have two
or  three  encounters  with  moat  monsters,  the  toughest  (and   best
experience)  critters on level 1. This is a good way to build up initial
experience; you don't want to try level 2 until you're at least 3rd, and
preferably 4th or 5th, level (be at  least  3rd  even  if  you  bring  a
superbishop  --  lots of spellcasting creatures on the upper levels, not
to mention dragons).  Turn right, proceed as far as you can,  turn  left
(west),  proceed,  (your first moat monster encounter will take place in
the 4th square after you turn the corner (17e, 19n) -- kill 'em!),  bump
into  the west wall, and turn south. On your fourth square (8e, 15n) you
will meet some more moaties; trash 'em!  walk one more south, then  turn
left (east); the doors to the fortress!  walk forward, then kick. 

O.K.,  you've  just kicked in the northern door to the fortress, and are
at (10e,14n,1u) (incidentally, except for your  final  destination,  the
fortress  is  totally symmetrical, so you could reverse my n-s direction
and use the south door (13n) if you preferred).  Turn  left  (n),  kick,
walk two squares, turn right (e), kick, forward 2, kick, forward 1, turn
right,  kick, turn right, walk 2, kick... Gird yourself for combat, then
kick -- you are in a guardroom with some  garian  guards.   Don't  waste
spells  on them. Just fight, and most of them will run away. <<leave the
chest behind!!>> it will not contain any magic, and the traps tend to be
vicious. 

Turn left, kick,  walk  1,  turn  left,  prepare,  kick  (another  fixed
encounter  with  garian guards -- <<leave the chest>>). Kick, fight some
more garian guards and <<leave the chest>>, walk  two  squares,  take  a
deep  breath,  make  sure  everyone's healed, then... Kick!  you are now
face-to-face with the high corsair and a variable number (3-5) of garian
captains. O.K., remember all those spells you  weren't  wasting  on  the
previous  encounters?   A time will come when your characters will sneer
at this encounter, but it's not yet!  Put the  captains  to  sleep,  and
concentrate  all  the  fighters on the high corsair. Once he's dead, you
can take on the captains (those which don't run away in panic when their
leader dies). This chest will be trapped with  "alarm";  disarm  it  and
open it; it will always contain equipment, sometimes magical -- the only
magic you will be likely to find on level 1. 

Go  to  the  door  on  the  south end of the east wall, and kick. Lo and
behold, yet another message!  this time,  it's  "l'kbreth"  telling  you
that  neither good nor evil alone can so live the dungeon. This is quite
true. There are four doors ahead of you. The rightmost is an empty 10x10
room; the leftmost is a teleport back to the castle  (good  quick  exit;
you may need this later!), the middle ones are stairs. The catch is that
only  a  good  party  (at  least one good-aligned character) can use the
stairs directly opposite where you are  now  standing  (19e,13n),  while
only  an  evil  party  can use the stairs at (19e, 14n). If you pick the
wrong stairway, you will be teleported back to the castle. So  pick  the
right one, and go on up. 

The  stairs  up  from level 1 are at (19e,13n) -- good parties only, and
(19e,14n) -- evil parties only (i haven't tried a straight neutral party
-- if anyone has, let us know what happens). The good stairs take you up
to level 2, while the evil stairs go up to level 3  --  the  levels  are
approximately the same in difficulty. 

You will need to run some evils to solve this dungeon, but put it off as
long  as  possible  --  it  heavily discriminates against them!  level 4
(good parties only) has all the magic; level 5  (evil  only)  is  almost
bare.  Same with level 2 vs.  Level 3. So, take your good party, proceed
up the good stairs; you are now at (19e,0n,2u). Turn west (180  degrees)
and  walk  down  the  hall -- 4 steps, turn right, 4 steps, turn left, 4
steps, turn right, one step, left, one step, left (now facing south)  --
kick  the  door,  walk  forward one, turn left, walk 4, turn right, walk
one, turn right (now facing west), kick the door. In  case  you  haven't
guessed by now, you will be heartily sick of the fortress and this route
by  the  time  you  are  able to use the shortcut (via the island -- you
guessed it). If you have a superbishop along, just malor up to  level  2
(i don't recommend attacking level 4, despite the greater rewards, until
everybody  has enough hit points and fighting ability to survive a tough
magic or dragon breath battle). 

Let's see, you should now be at (13e, 2n, 2u).  Walk  one  square,  turn
left,  walk  one square, kick, turn right, kick (don't look back -- that
was a one-way door you just kicked through!!  to get back, you will  use
the door in the north -- currently to your right). Walk one square, turn
right, walk two squares, turn left . Blank wall here, even if you have a
light  spell  going. So kick the wall anyway -- it's an "invisible" door
like the ones you may remember from knight of diamonds. Turn right,  and
kick another invisible door in. Whew!  that was the tough part; (took me
about  six  expeditions up here to isolate this as the only way into the
rest of level 2). 

From your current location (9e,2n, 2u)  to  the  stairs  up,  you  walk:
forward,kick,forward,left,forward,  kick,  right,kick,left,kick,forward,
right,forward,kick,right,forward,   right,    forward,left,forward,kick,
left,  forward,right,kick,forward,  left,  forward  ,right,kick,forward,
forward,  left,  forward,left,kick,  right,  kick,   left,forward,right,
forward,forward,kick,  right,forward  4,kick,right,right,kick - - wait a
sec -- isn't that where I just came from??  nope -- you just  teleported
to (3e,18n,2u)!! 

O.K.,  you  are  now  at  (2e,18n,2u), facing west. Kick the door, then:
forward,left,forward,kick,left, forward, right,forward,kick,  left,kick,
left,kick,forward,right,  forward,kick  (but remember that door you just
passed on your right -- you'll need to go that way to get out!).  You're
now  in  a  north-south  hallway,  facing  east.  Turn  left (n), walk 3
squares, and "bingo"!  "I am around you always, but you have never  seen
me. You would never leave me, but were I gone, you would not cry out for
me.  What am I?" the answer is, of course, elementary (the elements play
an important part in this dungeon), namely  "air".  Turn  left,  walk  4
squares, and you're on the stairs up to level 4. 

If  you've  detoured (as you should have, as you want to have characters
of around 6th-8th level before going up to level 4), you may notice that
you've only been able to map about half of the second level. Don't worry
about it; there's another way down from 4th into the other part.  If you
got lost, your stairs up from level 2 were at (0e, 19n,2u), and you  are
now   at   (10e,2n,4u).  Other  important  locations  on  level  4  are:
(3e,1n,4u) -- stairs down to the island  on  level  1.  (13e,13n,4u)  --
stairs  down to the other half of level 2. (12e,13n,4u) -- chute down to
same (comes out at (2e,11n,2u).  (19e,14n,4u) -- stairs up to level 6 --
but you  can't  go  yet.   (17e,11n,4u)  --  a  puzzle  to  get  you  to
aforementioned  stairs  most  safely. (7e,17n,4u) -- lair of the greater
demon delf -- guardian of the crystal of evil -- an  artifact  you  must
have  to solve this dungeon.  The whole area south of (17e,10n,4u) -- is
full of squares that say "look out!" each time you walk on one of these,
you will  have  an  encounter  on  your  <<next>>  move.  All  of  these
encounters  will  be  pretty tough, and decent experience; all will have
chests; all chests will contain magic items. Jackpot!  bonanza!   here's
where  you  go  to stock everybody -- good and evil!  in particular, you
need to find some glass bottles  --  they're  "ships  in  bottles",  and
enable  you  to walk across the lake to the island (and shortcut stairs)
on the first level.  Get several, if you can. (they're quite  common  in
this section).
