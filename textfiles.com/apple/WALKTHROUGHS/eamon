WELCOME TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF EAMON
            by Donald Brown
   
    EAMON  is a computerized version of
what are called  "Fantasy  Role-Playing
Games."  When you enter the universe of
one of these games, you are  no  longer
John (or   Jane)  Smith,  mild-mannered
computer hobbyist.  Instead, you become
a character  in  a  land  of adventure,
doing  almost  anything  you  want  to.
   
    In the land of Eamon, you  will  be
a member of the select Free Adventurers
Guild, which is made up of hardy  indi-
viduals  like yourself who want to live
by your wits, defeating  horrible  mon-
sters  and  finding glorious treasures.
(For those of you who want a more  calm
life,  you  will  have  to wait for the
game "ADVENTURERS IN THE  LAND  OF  THE
CERTIFIED     PUBLIC     ACCOUNTANTS".)
   
    Unlike   most  games,  there  is no
single set goal for you to achieve,  no
way to   'win'  the  game.  Instead, in
Eamon, you have a lasting goal to  both
better  yourself  and also get rich. If
you set for yourself another  goal  (do
good to  all  princesses, kill all evil
wizards, that sort of thing),  you  may
also work  towards  it  in your quests.
   
    To run the adventures of Eamon, you
need an Apple II, one disk  drive,  and
at least 32K of memory. (Some scenarios
may require 48K.) You do not need  this
manual  (although it does help keep you
informed,  and   informed   adventurers
survive  longer!).  The  one  thing you
must possess for Eamon is a large  dose
of imagination.
   
   
    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: The full list  of
people  who  deserve mentioning here is
too long to give, but a  few  are--Bill
Fesselmeyer,  for introducing me to FRP
games, my father for introducing me  to
the Apple,  the  many  good friends who
have play-tested this for  me,  to  all
the creators of the games I have played
and to the  writers  such  as  Tolkein,
Leiber,  and  Niven  who  have given me
so many ideas. And, last but not least,
to the  talented  people  of Ann Arbor,
Michigan  who  designed  that    lovely
Dragon Picture.
   
The basic  system  of EAMON was created
and developed  by  Donald  Brown.   The
individual  adventures  were created by
various people. Non-commercial distrib-
ution is encouraged.
   
   
    Far away, at the dead center of the
Milky  Way,  is the planet of Eamon. It
doesn't orbit any suns--all of the suns
orbit it.  The shifting pulls of all of
these great bodies bring strange forces
to bear   upon  this  planet;  twisting
light, tides, even the laws of  science
itself!   Strange  things happen there,
and the citizens of Eamon  must  always
be adaptable,  for  things  are  rarely
what they seem, and  even  more  rarely
what they were yesterday!
   
    You  are  a  citizen  of this weird
world.  You are a free man  (or  woman)
out to  seek your fortune in this world
of shifting laws and  time.   You  will
usually find yourself fighting terrible
monsters  such  as  Orcs,  Trolls,  and
Dragons to get their treasure. However,
at times you may find yourself fighting
such varied  opponents as Billy the Kid
and Darth Vader!  Anything can  happen,
anything at all.
   
   
   
    EAMON  is  a  fantasy  role-playing
game.  This  means  that  the  computer
will generate  a  character for you and
you will pretend  to  be  that  person.
You will  command  your  character into
fierce battle, where  hopefully  he/she
will emerge   victorious  and  wealthy.
   
    Obviously,  not  all characters are
equal in ability. Three numbers (called
attributes)   describe   various  parts
of your physical condition.   You  also
will have    various   abilities   with
weapons, which  will  increase  as  you
gain experience  with  them,  and learn
how to better use them.   Additionally,
you will be able to learn some powerful
magic spells.   (Of  course,  you  will
have to  be  taught  these  spells, and
the teacher will  charge  you  for  the
job!)
   
    EAMON  is usually non-sexist--there
is full room for both male  and  female
adventurers.  However, for simplicity's
sake, an  adventurer  will  usually  be
referred  to as 'he'--please understand
that it  refers  to  'she'  adventurers
also.
   
   
   
         CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES
   
    As mentioned earlier, three numbers
describe the basic  'working  material'
of your character.  They are all gotten
by selecting three random numbers  from
one to eight and summing them, thus the
numbers can range from three to twenty-
four,  with  more numbers around twelve
to fifteen. (By the way, this is called
'three  die eight' or written as '3D8'.
This terminology comes from older role-
playing  games  where  you roll strange
dice, and means roll three  eight-sided
dice and add). The three attributes are
HARDINESS, AGILITY, and CHARISMA. Their
descriptions   and  effects  are  given
below--
   
               HARDINESS
   
    Your character's hardiness has  two
major  effects.   The most important is
that your hardiness is  the  number  of
points  of  damage  that  your body can
withstand before  you  die.   In  other
words,  assume  Hedric  the Horrible is
fighting a Troll.   Hedric  has  an  HD
(hardiness)  of  13.   The Troll swings
his Battle axe (as described  later  in
the COMBAT  section  of the manual) and
hits Hedric for 10  points  of  damage.
This brings  Hedric  down to three more
points of damage before  death--if  the
Troll  can hit Hedric again and do more
than two  points  of  damage    (before
Hedric can go home and heal himself, or
use some magic to  heal),  Hedric  will
die!
   
    The  other  effect  of hardiness is
the total weight that  you  can  carry.
The standard   measure   of   weight on
Eamon is the Grond, which can be  split
into ten  Dos.   You  can  carry  up to
ten times your  hardiness.   Therefore,
Hedric  can  carry up to 130 Gronds (or
1300 Dos).  Note  that  weight-carrying
ability is based on the characters base
hardiness, not the number  of  hits  he
has left.   In his unpleasant encounter
with the Troll, Hedric can still  carry
130 Gronds,  even  though  he  only has
three hits left before death.
   
    As with all three basic attributes,
a character's hardiness is not normally
changed. (Unusual magic items or spells
might  change them). Thus, a player who
starts life as a 90-pound weakling will
remain one until he dies.
   
   
                AGILITY
   
    The second  basic  ability  is  the
player's  agility  (abbreviated  'AG').
Agility's major effect is in  combat--a
player with high Agility is more likely
to hit an opponent.  Agility  may  also
be useful  for  avoiding  special traps
(like falling  down a  mine  shaft)  or
other special occurances.
   
   
               CHARISMA
   
    The last basic  attribute  for  the
player  is  his  charisma  (abbreviated
'CH').  Charisma is mostly a measure of
physical  attractiveness,  although  it
also includes such things as a forceful
manner,  pleasant  speaking  voice, and
anything else that  makes  people  look
at you and say, "Gee, what a nice guy!"
(or girl).  In some ways, charisma  may
be the   most  important  attribute, at
least for the beginning character.  The
first  major  effect  of charisma is on
the prices you'll have to pay for goods
and services (or the prices people will
pay you).  Obviously, if somebody likes
you, he  will  give  you a better price
than if you disgust him.
   
    The second effect of charisma is on
how citizens   of   Eamon  (generically
called monsters) will react to you. Not
all monsters are bad--you can sometimes
make friends with a few  of  them,  and
their  assistance  may make the differ-
ence between  life  and  death!    Your
charisma  will affect the likeliness of
their liking you--subtract 10 from your
charisma, multiply the difference by 2,
and the result adjusts  the  percentage
chance of a favorable reaction from the
monster--if there  was  any  chance  at
all!   EXAMPLE:   The Mad Hermit of the
Beginner's Cave has a 50%  friendliness
rating,  which  means  that  Joe Normal
with a charisma of  10  will  get  make
friends with the Hermit one-half of the
time.  However, old Hedric the Horrible
with his  charisma  of 5 has only a 40%
chance of making friends (5-10=-5, -5*2
=-10).   On  the  other  hand,  Lovable
Linda with her charisma of 24 has a 78%
chance of making friends. Unfortunately
a rat  with a  friendliness  rating  of
0 will  never  make friends, be it with
Joe Normal, Hedic,  or  Lovable  Linda.
   
                COMBAT
   
    Being a rough  and  violent  world,
combat  is the most important aspect of
Eamon.  In most adventures,  combat  is
taken  care of on a blow-by-blow method
--every player or monster in turn  uses
his weapon(s) on one enemy, the effects
are calculated,   and   then   applied.
   
    Every time that a player or monster
attempts  to strike someone else, there
is a percentage chance of success.  The
computer  will generate a number from 1
to 100, and if the number is less  than
the chance to hit, the blow did strike.
   
    Several factors determine just what
that chance to hit is.  If a player has
no armour on, there are three factors--
the player's agility, his ability  with
that weapon,  and  the  quality  of the
weapon (also  called  the  complexity).
   
    Roughly speaking,  all  weapons  in
the world  of Eamon can be divided into
five types--axes, bows  (this  includes
all thrown weapons and guns), clubs (or
any blunt weapons),  spears  (or  other
pole weapons), and swords. Every player
has what are called 'weapon expertises'
for each  class.   All players start at
the same levels:   5%  for  axes,  -10%
for bows, 20% for clubs, 10% for spears
and 0% for swords. (These  numbers  are
to reflect  the  fact that somebody who
doesn't know what he's  doing  is  more
likely  to hit with a club than with an
arrow.)  Your chance  of  hitting  your
target  is  equal to twice your agility
plus your ability for  the  weapon  you
are using,  plus  the complexity of the
weapon you are using.  For example, our
old friend  Hedric has an agility of 20
and is using a fair quality sword (with
a complexity  of  0%).   Since  he is a
starting  character,  he  has a   sword
ability  of  0%.   Thus  his  chance of
hitting is 40+0+0 or 40%.
   
    Weapon expertises can be  increased
through use in combat.  The scheme goes
as follows:  Assume Hedric is  fighting
his troll  and scores a successful hit.
The question now is, did  Hedric  learn
anything  about  how  to use his weapon
better?  Well, it just so happens  that
his chance  to  learn  is his chance to
have missed.  Thus,  60%  of  the  time
Hedric  will  learn  from  his blow. If
he does, his sword  expertise  will  go
up by  2%.   Thus, next time his chance
of hitting will be 42%.   (Notice  that
his chance  of  learning  on  the  next
successful blow is only 58%.)
   
    Well, Hedric somehow  made  it  out
alive  from  his  Troll battle, and has
brought his sword expertise up to  12%.
He then wants to take his booty and new
knowledge and get a better  weapon.  If
Hedric  goes  and buys a new sword-like
weapon, such as a rapier  which  has  a
weapon complexity of 15%, his chance of
hitting with it  will  be  40+12+15  or
67%.   However, if he decides to switch
weapons and get a  Battle  axe  with  a
complexity of 15%, his chance with that
will be 40+5+15 or 60%--his  experience
with swords  will not help him with his
axe.
   
    If an attacker is  wearing  armour,
his chance  of  hitting may be reduced.
After all, one just isn't as agile when
one is  fighting from within a tin can!
A player may carry a shield, which will
lower  the chance to hit by 5%, and may
also wear either leather armour (lowers
chance  by  10%),  chain mail (20%), or
plate armour  (60%!).   However,  these
numbers  are  "worst  cases".  A player
becomes used to the constricting effect
of wearing armour, and builds an armour
expertise (called AE). It is built  the
same way   that   weapon  expertise  is
increased--every time a successful blow
is landed  and  the effect of armour is
bigger than the player's AE, a check is
made on  the chance to miss and that is
the chance  of  the  armour   expertise
going up by 2%.  Thus a successful blow
may increase the chance to hit  by  4%.
Armour  expertise  is carried over from
each type of armour.   Thus  if  you've
brought  your  AE  up  to  10% while in
leather armour and  you  go  to  chain,
your chance  to  hit  will only drop by
10%, not 20%.  However, the  effect  of
armour expertise can never increase the
chance to hit--if the AE is 32% and you
go to  leather  armour,  the net effect
will be 0, not adding 22%.
   
    In  addition  to  agility,   weapon
expertise,   weapon   complexity,   and
armour, there may be magical  or  other
extraordinary  forces at work that will
affect the chance of hitting.
    When  a  blow hits, a random amount
of damage is done to the  target.  This
amount of damage is based on the weapon
and will be given in  'N D  N'  format.
(Remember  3D8  for  the  three   basic
attributes?) This base number of damage
is usually  lowered  by the armour worn
by the  defender--leather  armour   and
shield  each  take one point of damage,
chain takes 2, and plate armour takes 5
points  of  damage away from that taken
on the body (all effects are cumulative
and magical devices may act as armour).
   
    That,  of  course,  is what usually
happens.  However, due  to  flashes  of
good luck  or  clumbsiness weird things
can happen.  About 5% of  the  time  an
attacker  will  get  what  is  called a
'critical hit'.  That will get  one  of
the following  results  (each result is
followed by the  percentage  chance  of
its occurance):   Ignore  armour (50%),
three-halves normal damage (35%), twice
normal   damage  (10%),  triple  normal
damage (4%), or  automatic  kill  (1%).
   
    About 4% of the time  the  attacker
will fumble  with  his weapon.  It will
have one  of  the  following   effects:
Recover  from  fumble without any other
effect (35%), Drop weapon (40%, if  the
attacker is using built-in weapons such
as claws, the attacker simply  recovers
instead), Break weapon (20%, with a 10%
chance of hitting oneself at  the  same
time),  Hit self normally (4%), and Hit
self with  double   damage,    ignoring
armour (1%).
   
   
                 MAGIC
   
    The strange shifting forces  around
Eamon  sometimes  give results that can
only be  called  'Magical'.    However,
most of  these  effects  are  extremely
localized, and will not  be  consistent
from one  adventure  to the next.  Most
often these strange things will be  the
special  results  by  carrying  magical
items, however, some citizens of  Eamon
who have  lived  all  of their lives in
one location may have  learned  how  to
control   the   forces   around   them.
   
    There  are,  however,  four  spells
that work  almost  everywhere.   Anyone
can be  taught these spells without too
much difficulty  (if  you  can  find  a
wizard  who  will  teach them to you!).
When you learn a spell, you will  start
with a  random ability in it from 25 to
75% (you  will  not  know   what   your
ability is). As with combat experience,
this can be increased  every  time  you
successful  cast the spell--If a random
percentage  roll  is  less  than   your
chance   to  not   have cast  it,  your
ability will go  up  by  2%.   However,
there  is  a  catch in casting spells--
due to the tiring  effects  of  sending
all this power through your body, every
time that you attempt to  cast a  spell
REGARDLESS   OF   WHETHER  OR  NOT  THE
ATTEMPT WAS SUCCESSFUL your chance  for
the rest  of  the  adventure is halved.
Thus, old Hedric who knows a spell with
a 200%  ability will always cast it the
first time.  His second try  will  also
always  work  (100%  of the time).  His
third try will only work half (50%)  of
the time.  On the fourth try the chance
is down to  25%,  fifth  try  12%,  and
sixth  only 6%. Fortunately for Hedric,
however,  if  you  know a  spell   your
chance  of  successfully casting it can
never be less than 5%,  so  Hedric  can
use his   spell  for  the  rest  of the
adventure at the same odds.
   
    The four basic spells are:
   
                 BLAST
   
    This spell sends a magical  burning
arrow  at  your  opponent.  Armour will
absorb damage from it, but if the spell
is successfully cast it will always hit
its target, regardless  of  the  range.
However,  the  Blast  spell  only works
on living (or at least animate) objects
and the  targets  must  be  seen by the
person casting it. The  arrow  will  do
1 D 6  of  damage (a random number from
one to six).
   
                 HEAL
   
    The Heal spell  removes  hits  from
the body of the person casting. It will
cure 1 D 10 hits,  but  never  past  0.
(Hedric,  having taken five hits, casts
a Heal spell on  himself  successfully.
He got  a good casting this time--would
have cured 8 hits normally, however  it
only cures  five hits one him, bringing
Hedric back up to  perfect  condition).
   
                 SPEED
   
    This  powerful  spell  will  double
the caster's  agility  for  from  10 to
34 turns.  You will know when you  have
cast the  spell  successfully,  however
you will not be told when it wears off.
If you  successfully cast a Speed spell
while one is already in effect on  you,
the new  spell  will reset the time for
you--it will not  have  the  effect  of
quadrupling  your  agility.  Obviously,
when you  cast  the  Speed  spell  your
chance  of  hitting goes up accordingly
(Hedric had a  56%  chance  of  hitting
with some  weapon  before  casting  the
spell, with  40%  of  that  because  of
his 20   agility.   When  he  casts the
Speed  spell  on  himself,  his  chance
will increase  by 40% again, giving him
a 96% chance of hitting).
   
                 POWER
   
    The Power spell  may  well  be  the
most powerful  spell  available to you,
and certainly the  most  uncertain.  It
has no  set  effect, it's a call to the
Gods saying "Hey, do something!".  What
they do   will  certainly  differ  from
place to place,  and  may  even  differ
from one  moment to the next!  It could
kill all of your enemies, teleport  you
randomly  somewhere  else  in the place
you are exploring, cause an  earthquake
that buries   you  and  your  opponents
alive, or anything  else  you  can  and
cannot think of.
   
   
    For all of these spells, it  should
be pointed  out  that  this  is the way
they >> USUALLY << work out.   In  some
obscoure  sections  of the world spells
may not drop in ability every time  you
use them,  in  other  places spells may
not work at all!
   
   
        RELATING WITH CITIZENS
   
   
    There are two places  you  will  be
encountering  other  people  of  Eamon,
on your  adventures  and  at  the  Main
Hall of  the Guild of Free Adventurers.
   
    At  the Main Hall, you will be able
to communicate with the various  people
there  and  do business.  However, they
will not do you any real favors (except
possibly   giving  you  good  prices on
things if they like you), and you  will
not be  permitted to fight with anybody
there.   Essentially,  they  will    be
businessmen  and  women, out to relieve
you of some of your gold while  helping
outfit you to go get more.
   
    On  the  other  hand,  during  your
adventures outside of  the  Main  Hall,
you will  not  be  able  to communicate
with most  of  the  people  you   find.
Additionally,   they   will  usually be
rather simple-minded--when meeting  you
they will  decide  if they like you. If
they do like you, they will follow  you
around  and  fight  on your side during
any battles.  If they don't  like  you,
they will try to kill you. These people
are rather set in their ways--once they
make up  their mind about you they will
usually  keep  with  their   decisions,
unless  you  do something nasty such as
attack a friend, or  you  do  something
especially  nice,  such  as  healing an
enemy.
   
    However, just because  they  do  or
do not like you does not mean that they
will always fight to  the  bitter  end.
Some people  or  things  you  encounter
will be less  courageous  (or  smarter)
than others and will run from what they
view as a  losing   battle--both   your
enemies and your friends.  When someone
retreats they usually kick  up a  cloud
of dust  so  you  cannot  see which way
they ran,  although  they  will  always
only run  out  of exits that are really
there, and you can usually follow them.
   
    Once again, though, note  that  all
of the  statements  above were prefaced
by the word 'usually'.  In  some  parts
of the  world  you  may be able to work
quite well with  others,  give  orders,
get ideas,  even  play games with them.
As always, the key word is flexibility.
   
   
HOW TO  REALLY  AND ACTUALLY PLAY EAMON
   
(Never thought we'd get here, did you?)
   
   
    To actually run EAMON on the  Apple
II, you   must  first  'bootup'  on the
diskette marked "THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF
EAMON"  or  simply "EAMON MASTER DISK."
It must be in  slot  six,  drive  one--
Eamon  doesn't  know  how to handle any
others yet.
   
    After you are shown the title  page
(which  you  can  break out of early by
hitting the "ESC"  key),  you  will  be
almost  ready  to  enter the Main Hall.
Simply follow directions (for the  sake
of your  mothers, if nothing else!). If
you are new to Eamon (or your character
was killed  the last time he went out),
you will be  directed  to  the  man  in
charge of new adventurers. He will show
you what the  attributes  of  your  new
character  are,  and  let you read some
instructions that  are  stored  on  the
disk.   If  you  have  this manual, you
don't need to  read  his  instructions.
Finally,  you  will be sent to the Main
Hall,  where  all  old  adventurers  go
immediately from the Irishman.
   
    The  Main  Hall  will serve as your
headquarters. You can buy spells there,
as well as weaponry and armour, you can
'check  out'  yourself  and  all   your
attributes and abilities.  You can also
keep some money with the banker  there.
He gives  no interest, but money in the
bank is safe if  you're  robbed  on  an
adventurer.   (Of course, you can't use
it to ransom yourself out  of a  sticky
situation, either!).
   
   
         GOING ON AN ADVENTURE
   
    Of course, the main purpose of  the
Main Hall  is  as a place to leave from
to go  on  adventures.   Most  of  your
exploits  will  be  exploring caves and
old ruins, doing similar things  as  in
the popular  Adventure games.  However,
Eamon is wide enough to also  have  you
go to  casinos  and  gamble  your money
away, raise an army to  fight  invaders
(both  from  other  countries  and from
space!), or do  just  about  any  other
activity you can think of.
   
    Only  one  Eamon  adventure will be
stored on a  diskette.   To  go  on  an
adventure,  work  from the Main Hall as
directed, inserting the  diskette  with
the new  adventure  into the disk drive
at slot six, drive one  at  the  proper
time.   From  then  on,  you're on your
own.  (Notice:  characters who  do  not
return  from  adventures are considered
dead.  Thus, turning off  the  computer
in the midst of an adventure or halting
it by Ctrl-C or 'RESET' merely  commits
suicide).
   
    To  help  your  character  get some
gold to  equip  himself  properly   and
gather  a little bit of experience, one
adventure is included on the diskette--
The Beginners   Cave.   It's  a  gentle
little  romp  through a  set  of  caves
underground.   I  strongly  advise that
you do send your new character  through
this first.   If he can't survive this,
there's no point in going  out  to  the
dangerous places. (For more information
on The Beginners Cave, see the enclosed
sheet).
   
   
       BUYING   WEAPONS   AND    ARMOUR
   
    You will have 200 gold pieces  when
you start  a  character,  and hopefully
more after  your  adventures.   One  of
the most  important  things  for you to
do with this gold is to buy weapons and
armour. Additionally, you may sometimes
want to sell a weapon,  be  it  because
you have  no  need of it or because you
have reached the legal limit on  weapon
ownership of four.
   
    Well,  Marcos  Cavelli owns a small
weaponry store in the  Main  Hall  that
will do  this  for you.  Marcos carries
five standard  weapons--an  axe,  which
does 1D6 of damage and has a base price
of 25 gold pieces, a bow which does 1D6
and has  a  base  price  of  40, a mace
which does 1D4 and has a base price  of
20, a  spear  which  does 1D5 and has a
base price of  25,  and a  sword  which
does 1D8  and  has  a base price of 50.
For each  weapon  Marcos  sells   three
grades  of quality--poor (with a weapon
complexity of -10%, but only  half  the
base price),   medium  (with  a  weapon
complexity of 0, at normal price),  and
good (with  a weapon complexity of 10%,
at double the base price). Furthermore,
the price  you  are given can vary from
one-third to  three  times  the  normal
price, depending upon how your charisma
and how   Marcos   feels   about   you.
   
    Marcos will also buy  old  weapons.
If it's of a type that he doesn't sell,
Marcos will pay an average of 100  gold
pieces for a weapon.  If it is a weapon
from his stock, he will pay around  1/4
the normal price.
   
    Marcos's base prices for armour are
50 gold pieces for a  shield,  100  for
leather,  200  for  chain mail, and 500
for plate armour.  He  will  also  give
you a  trade-in  of  your old armour at
its old price,  subject  to  adjustment
for the   way   he   feels  about  you.
   
    Marcos's  credit  terms,  like  all
of the businesses in the Hall, are very
simple--none.
   
             BUYING SPELLS
   
    Hokas  Tokas,  the  local wizard in
the Main  Hall,  is  willing  to  teach
anybody  spells  for a price.  His base
prices for spells are:  Power (100 gold
pieces), Heal (1000 gold pieces), Blast
(3000 gold  pieces),  and  Speed  (5000
gold pieces).   As  with  Marcos, Hokas
will adjust his prices for how much  he
likes  you,  but  he  will  never  give
credit.  But, however he  may  grumble,
he is  a  nice fellow and will never do
anything to you if you  try  to  buy  a
spell  you  can't afford, or try to buy
a spell twice.
   
   
              THE BANKER
   
    Shylock McFenney, the local banker,
will open up an account  with  anybody.
He is  absolutely  trustworthy with the
funds you leave in his  care,  although
he does  not give interest, nor does he
make loans.   (He  makes  enough  money
from adventurers who deposit money with
him and never come back.)
   
   
          EXAMINING YOURSELF
   
    Unlike  most things at the Hall, it
does not cost you anything  to  examine
your attributes.    It  is  generally a
good idea to  examine  your  attributes
last thing  before  leaving to go on an
adventure,  and  write  them  down--you
cannot examine yourself in the midst of
an adventure!
   
   
         LEAVING THE UNIVERSE
   
    This  is  simply  ending  the game.
However, your character  is  stored  on
the diskette,  so  he  or  she  can  be
called up again the next time you play.
You should  only  leave the system this
way--otherwise some disk files  may  be
destroyed,  and  your character will be
trapped forever  in  the  horrible  bit
bucket!
   
   
   
    That's really about all there is to
say about playing Eamon. Of course, the
best way  to  learn is by starting up a
character and running him through a few
adventures.  One thing I would warn you
about--do not get too attached  to  any
character.  Unfortunately, while wealth
and expertise come  rather  quickly  in
this world, so does death.
   
    I am very interested in any and all
comments and suggestions  on  Eamon.  I
am particularly  interested  in getting
copies of adventures that other  people
create  for Eamon. If you want to build
your own adventures, all of the tools I
used in  creating  the  Beginner's Cave
should be on the master diskette.  Feel
free to  list  and examine them to help
build your own.  However, do not at all
be constrained  by  them,  the theme of
Eamon is do what you want to  with  it.
Eamon  hereby officially belongs to the
people who play games on computers, all
I ask is that you enjoy it.

          THE BEGINNER'S CAVE
   
    The Beginner's Cave has been set up
by the Warlord as a service to all Free
Adventurers, giving  them a  chance  to
try their skills in a not-too-dangerous
setting. Let us all toast  the  Warlord
for restocking the cave daily!
   
    Only beginners are permitted in the
Cave. A beginner is someone who has  no
armour  expertise and who still has all
of the starting levels of weapon exper-
tise.  You  are  permitted  to carry in
only one  weapon  and  any  armour  you
wish.  You  will  not  need  torches as
there is sufficient light in all  parts
of the Cave. A Knight Marshall (William
Misslefire) is on duty to be sure  that
you do not break the rules (and to keep
you from doing something really stupid,
like entering   the  cave  without  any
weapon at all!).
   
    Once you are in the Cave, you  will
give commands  by  entering  verbs  and
subjects, such as "GET STONE".  If  you
use a  verb  that  the computer doesn't
understand, all verbs will  be  listed.
You must  be  very  exact  and  use the
words  that  the  computer  knows.  For
example,  if  you  are  carrying a DEAD
MONKEY and  you  say  DROP  MONKEY  the
computer will not understand.(Sometimes
the computer does recognize  more  than
one word for an object, though). If you
want to repeat the last command  given,
simply hit 'return' when asked for your
next command.
   
    A  few  commands  you  should  know
about:
   
    N,  S,  E,  W,  U, D, NORTH, SOUTH,
EAST, WEST, UP, and DOWN all will  move
you in the direction given.
   
    INVENTORY  or  "I" will list all of
the items you are  currently  carrying.
   
    READY brings a weapon into  'ready'
mode,meaning that it will be the weapon
used in an ATTACK command.
   
    GET picks up an object (not a  mon-
ster!) from the floor. GET ALL gets all
objects there. If you get a weapon  and
you have no weapon ready, it will ready
that weapon automatically.
   
    Other  commands  are  either  self-
explanatory  or  they  are  designed to
make you experiment.
   
   
    To  return  to  the  main hall, you
must leave the  cave  (getting  to  the
Cave Entrance) and move North. Once you
have done so, Sam  Slicker  (the  local
dealer  for  treasures  and booty) will
pay you what they are worth  (with  the
price  adjusted  by your Charisma). You
will then be returned to the Main Hall.
   
    Of course,  that  is  only  if  you
survive.  If you died, remember that it
probably wasn't that great  of a  char-
acter anyway!
   
    NOTE:  If you accidentally stop the
program while it is running,  (such  as
accidentally  hitting 'reset'), you may
be able to continue  by  first  getting
back into   BASIC  and  then  entering:
   
    ]POKE 51,0:GOTO 1000
   
   
          THE MINOTAUR'S LAIR
   
    The method of running the Minotaurs
Lair is  roughly  the same as it was in
the Beginners Cave. Of course, the mon-
sters  and  treasures and rooms are not
the same, and some of  the  verbs  that
the computer  recognizes are different,
and the Power spell may have  different
results, but why quibble?
   
    A  major difference now is the fact
that you will not know the way  out.  A
hint to adventurers:In cases like this,
your top priority should be  finding  a
way out  and mapping the dungeon. Also,
only a real louse would  not  at  least
try to  find  a  good  friend if he/she
knows one is in here. (Remember, louses
do not have high charisma!)
