Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiego CHEAT

The list of names, ranks, and number of cases solved on the Detective Roster
(what you see when you depress Ctrl-L) is stored on Track 0B Byte 09.  The rank
and number of cases solved correspond to the first two bytes of a three byte
sequence that appears after each name.  The second byte is the number of games
won (in hex).  The first byte is your rank.  For example, 00 corresponds to
Gumshoe, ..........09 to Master Detective, and 0A to Super Sleuth.  You will
encounter Carmen Sandiego on your 50th case.  If you solve it correctly, you
will be promoted to Super Sleuth.  So, if you want to get there quickly, just
set the first two byte to: 09 32 which gives you 49 cases solved and a rank of
Master Detective.

The one strange thing I found was that after solving the 50th case (I actually
played all of them from the start), I did not wind up in the Hall of Fame
(Ctrl-F).  The game promoted me and asked if I wanted to go on to my next case.
I played it and now had 51 cases.  Seems strange that after you capture Carmen
you should be allowed to continue.
