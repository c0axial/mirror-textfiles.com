Conan, the solution.....

   I know that this is not an adventure game, but some people seem to have
problems in certain parts of the game.

   Level 1:  Level one is very easy..all there is to do is to kill the bat (if
you want to, 750 points) and climb up to where the blinking arrow is.

   Level 2:  You must first jump down to the bottom and get the key.  then jump
across the water and get to the other tree.  Go thru the door and go into the
cave entrance.

   Level 3:  You must get the gem at the top of the screen and then use it.  To
do this you must climb down the ladder at the bottom of the screen and go into
the teleporter (while avoiding the ants, they kill).  When you enter the
teleporter it will put you at the op of the screen.  Walk over and get the gem
(if you jump and touch the bird you will get an extra man) and go in the
teleporter again.  Climb up the ladder and jump over the scorpion and put the
gem in the gem holder.	A bubble will rise out of the la va and start going up.
Jump into it and wait until you are farther up the screen.  Then go to the left
and you will fall down the shaft.

   Level 4:  Wait around the screen (gettin extra swords if you want to) until
a gem appears.	Get it and put it in the gem holder that is by the waterfall
(you can jump thru the waterfall without dieing).  Then wait until another one
appears.  Do the same thing.  After you put the second gem in, the key will
fall from the cieling, get it.	Go back out and go thru the locked door and
leave the level.

   Level 5:  Go down to the bottom and get a gem.  Then go up and wait until a
dragon flys out of the teleporter on the right side of the screen.  Kill one
every time it flys out.  After doing this for a while, all of them will be
dead.  Then go thru the telepor ter and go put the gem in the gem holder on the
right side of the screen.  This will stop the electric "beam".  Then jump back
across and get the key that is on the left side of the screen.	Then go back
across again and go thru the door and leave the level.

   Level 6:  Every time a thing that looks like an eye appears, kill it with a
sword.	Every time you kill one, the ladder near the entrance gets longer.
When it get to the floor, climb it.when you are at the top, face to the right,
throw a sword.	This will break the chain and the chandilier will fall on the
machine and break it.  Then jump across and leave the level.

   Level 7:  This is the final level to kill Volta.  To complete the level you
must put three gems in the gem holders that are on the left side of the screen.
To get the gems you must "kill" the electric balls that Volta throws at you.
When you hit one with a sword, it turns back into a gem.  Get it and put it in
the gem holder.  After you fill all three gem holders, the "Avian Ally" will be
released from its cage and drop Volta into the lava and take you out of the
level.	You will then get a bonus and your game will be over.
