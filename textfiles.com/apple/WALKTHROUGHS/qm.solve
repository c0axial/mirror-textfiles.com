This is a step-by-step solution to the game. It is intended to get you to the end of the game in as little time as possible. Since there are supposed to be sequels that will require items found in this game, the solution may not be complete. In other words, there may be items that I have missed that are not required to solve the game, but are needed for the sequels.

Now, on with the solution...

Note: If you ever try to get something & you find that you're arms are full, just put things in your sack to make room. If you can't carry any more weight, you can drop the vial, twig, torch, & crowbar (after you've used them of course.)


In the first screen (the hexagon):

        Get key. Open S door. Kick key S. S. Get key. N. Say death to colnar. Insert key into keyhole. N. Say death to colnar (you will get the glass vial & the gem). N.

From the altar:

        S. W. W. N. Get cross. S. Drink liquid (this makes you invisible to the Wildebeest). W. W. W. N.

In town:

        W. Get pot. Get key. Unlock door with key. Open door. W. Open refrigerator. Get food. E. E. E. Look man. Sit. Give food to man (he gives you a knife). W. N.

At bird:

        N. E. Get crowbar. W. S. Look hole. Pry manhole with crowbar. Look D. Yes. D. NW. Cut fruit with knife. Get fruit. Eat fruit (you are teleported to a random spot in a different area.)

After teleport:

        Note: These instructions assume you start at the scarecrow. If you're at a different spot, just go to the scarecrow.

R   |_________|

        Get hat. W. Get dollars. S. Give gem to lioness (she tells you the secret of the Vagra fruit). N. E. E. Wear hat (you turn into a mouse).

As mouse:

        E. NW. Get twig. N. Push cheese with twig. Get cheese. N.

At dirt mover:

        Eat cheese (turn back to normal). Go mover. Get all (here's where your stuff went!) Leave mover. E. Turn wheel. Open door. N. Close door. Turn wheel. N. Open door. N. Get ladder. S. W. N. Open ladder. Put ladder across crevice. Cross ladder.

Across crevice:

        Open door. N. Open drawer (you get the rod & pin). Look box. Look hole. Put rod into hole. Get torch. Read instructions. Charge torch. Get blueprint. Look meter (this part is a bit tricky because if you do nothing for too long, you get killed. So alternate between reading the instructions & looking at the meter until the torch is full). Unplug torch. S. Put pin into torch. E. N. Pull trigger. Search men. Get wrench. Get keys. N. W. W. Look panel. Press blue pad. W.

Across Bridge:

        S. Go S hole. W. S. W. Look table. Buy clips. W. N. Look around sign. Get birdseed. N. Sit on pedestal. Say xxxx (where xxxx is the name you gave your character at the start of the game). Say death to colnar. Say teleportation. N. Get saddle. S. S. E.

At river:

        Note: Try to type fast until you're in the water because you will get killed if you wait too long here.

        Get reed. Breathe through reed. D. Look (keep looking until the men pass overhead. Don't worry if tour reed gets clogged, you'll have enough time). Get chest. U. Open chest. Look in chest. Get prism. S. E.

At hole in fence:

        Attach clips to fence. S. S. Give birdseed to bird. Put saddle on bird. Sit on bird.

That's it! Now sit back & watch the end of the game. You may have noticed a few items that serve no purpose (blueprint, cross, etc.) I can only assume that these will be needed in the sequel. Like I said before, there may be other items I missed too.

Where's Questmaster II???     Lemme at it!!!
