Title:   Solution To Manhunter
Date:    9/28/88
Time:    9:41 pm





The Society of Sin and Stairway to Heaven BBS's are proud to present the solve
for Manhunter: New York.  Cobra Commander and I spent many a day playing the
game, and we are proud to be among the first to solve it.

Day One:

1) Go to the Hospital.  Take a good look at the dead dude.  His name is Reno
Davis.  Look him up in the Info selection from MAD.

2) Go to the Bar.  Play the Video Game.  The first time, some dudes will drag
you away and make you chuck knives between a guy's fingers.  This takes
practice, but can be done.  When you accomplish this, play the game again.
This time, make a COMPLETE map of the maze, including the location of the
little squares.  If you have trouble, use graph paper.  The map is important.

3) Go to The Park where the bathrooms are.  Go to the ladies room (on the left)
and go to the very last toilet on the right.  Sit on it and flush it three
times.  Whoosh!

4) Ok, this sewer you're in now, this is the maze from the arcade game.  Every
square in your map is a key card.  Get EVERY Key Card before you leave the
maze.  Pay CLOSE attention to your map.  When you get to the cave with the
dock, make SURE you get the medallion from the dock.

5) Go to Coney Island.  Play Kewpie Doll Baseball.  Hit the Dolls in this
order.
     1) Top row, third doll.
     2) Middle Row, second doll.
     3) Bottom Row, last doll.

When the guy looks at you funny, show him the medallion.  He'll give you a
data card.

At the end of each day, MAD will ask you for the names of your suspect(s).  I
have found that it doesn't make a difference what you put, but the best names
to use are probably Phillipe Cook, Harvey Osborne, Anna Osborne, and Harry
Jones.

End of Day One.

Day Two:

1) Go to your Tracker and track the other two dudes that were with the original
guy you were tracking.  One goes to the Museum and one to the Park.

2) Go to the Wretched Excess Nightclub.  Go around into the alley.  This next
arcade sequence is pretty self explanatory.  You don't really need to save the
game here because of the fact that they let you keep doing the same thing over
and over again even though you keep dying.  When you make it through here,
though, it may be a good idea to save.  Once you're in the Nightclub, take a
closer look at the people.  When you get to the screen where you're looking the
backs of people's heads and the rock group, take a closer look at the only
person that has a brown robe on, on the left half of the screen.  When you get
knocked over, a keycard will fall onto the ground.  Before the bouncer can grab
you and throw you out, grab the keycard.  You should now have a total of 13
keycards between this one and the sewer maze.

3) Go to Central Park.  You'll notice that if you point the arrow up and start
moving to the left or right, the arrow will blink off and on.  This means that
there isn't just ONE screen above here, each time it's blinking on and off
you're traveling to a different ANGLE.  So instead of three possible ways to go
from this screen, there are actually about 15.  From this first screen, get the
arrow to be pointing right but be as far down as you can get it.  Move it up
twice.  It should still be facing right.  Hit Enter.  For this screen, line the
arrow up with the path straight ahead of you facing up.  Move it to the left
twice.  Hit Enter.  For the third screen, line the arrow up with the path
facing right, just below the tree.  Hit Enter.  For the fourth screen, get the
arrow to line up with the path straight ahead of you facing up.  Move it to the
left four times.  Hit Enter.  For the fifth screen, get the arrow as far to the
right as you can get it and still be facing up.  Move it to the left once.  Hit
Enter.  For this screen, get the arrow to be facing left but as far up as you
can get it.  Hit Enter.  Pick up the crowbar.  You should now be back at the
screen you were just at.  Make the arrow face down and Hit Enter.  Now you're
at the previous screen.  Make the arrow be pointing up but as far left as you
can get it.  Now move it twice to the right.  Hit Enter.  For this screen, make
the arrow be pointing right but as far up as you can get it.  Hit Enter.  For
this screen, get the arrow to be pointing up just left of the monument.  Move
it to the left 5 (if not 5, 6) times.  Hit Enter.  You should now see a dead
dude.  Take a close look at the papers around him, and at his face.

4) Go to your Mad Info.  Look up Harvey Osborne.

5) Go to Harvey Osborne's House, near the museum.  Look in the shopping bag and
get the key.  Push the button.  This game has quite a body count, doesn't it?
Take a look at the bitch, push the button again, and leave.

6) Go back to your tracker and watch the guy that goes to the museum.  Make a
map of where he went.  You CAN NOT mess up at the museum.  You need every key
card, all 13.

7) Go to the museum.  Go around to the locked glass doors and use the keys.
Use your map to get through the museum, up to the fourth floor where the dude's
signal stopped.  When you use a keycard to open a door, you must pass through
the door QUICKLY, or it will close.  When you get to the big wooden door, use
the crowbar.  When the dragon starts to run after you, use the medallion.
He'll remove the wood and you can go through.  When you get to the dead dude,
take a close look at the map on the wall and at the dead dude.  Take the Module
out of his hands.

End of Day Two

Day Three:

1)Go to the cemetary.  There's nothing you need here, but the sight of the dead
orb with the spear through him is worth going.

2) Go to the Church.  Go to the set of candles ob the left.  Light them in this
order.
   1) Top Row, first candle.
   2) Middle Row, third candle.
   3) Bottom Row, fourth candle.

Take the Module out of the compartment.  Extinguish the candles.

3) Go to Abdul's Pawn Shop.  Take a closer look at him.  Buy the badges in this
order.

   1) The Cross

   2) The one near it that looks like one vertical line, with a bunch of
      horizontal lines extending out of it to the right, the longest one being
      the one on the bottom.
   3) The Star

   You should now fall through a trap door and land in a secret room with a
painting and a door.  Take a closer look at the painting.  You will be prompted
to enter a code.  The correct code will let you pass to the next room, each one
identical to the first.  The codes are as follows:

    1) 4,1
    2) 1,0,3,1
    3) 2,6,4
    4) 4,2,5

You should now see a dead body (Yes, ANOTHER dead body).  Take a close look at
this one two.  Go around the corner and you should see a dude standing on
a ladder leading to a manhole.  He'll jump down and try to stab you.  This
section is similar to the punks in the alley behind the nightclub.  When you
punch him and he runs away, pick up the piece of paper he drops.  It reads:

    843769

Climb up the ladder.

4) Go to the theatre in times square.  Go to the room on the right and remove
the picture on the left of the wall facing straight ahead of you.  The code is
(yep, you guessed it):
    843769

Take out the paper.  It reads:

    UCUCC

5) Go to your MAD Info.  Look up Harry Jones.
6) Go to Harry Jones's House, it's on the southern tip of Manhatten.  Go over
   to the radio, and smash it with the crowbar.  Remove the Module.
7) Go to your MAD Info.  Look up Phillipe Cook.
8) Go to The Empire State Building.  Go to the computer and turn it on.  The
   password is (yep, you guessed it): UCUCC

Select Site Alpha, and switch the robot from Special Detail (or whatever) to
Hall Patrol.  Quit the computer.

End of Day Three

Day Four:

1) Go to the hospital.  The Robot should not be gurading the door anymore.  Go
through the door.  Don't worry about being caught and thrown in the room with
pile of bones.  Use the crowbar on the window.  This is what it means to be
"transfered to Chicago."  Now wait until the guard, the orb, and the other
robot leave the room.  Take a closer look at the machine.  Take Module D.  The
switch goes up and down, as well as the middle stopped position.  Fix it so
that the belt goes left, away from the People-Smasher.  Climb up the ladder and
you'll pass out of the room via the conveyer belt.  Now, just what we all
needed, another arcade sequence.  This one is a mother, but not as hard as the
punks outside the nightclub (at least we didn't think so).  When you get
through it, you'll wind up falling out a window and landing outside the
hospital.

2) Go to Grand Central Station.  Take a look at the three little windows at the
lower left side of the screen.  Use the crowbar.  Climb through the window and
enter the ship.  First press the upper left button (the only button you're
allowed to press at all so far).  You now have access to the three square
buttons on the bottom of the screen and the three other assorted buttons above
it.  Now press the middle square button.  After the little scene with the guard
robots is over, press the upper middle button with the little screen.  Now
press the button just to the right of it.  Now press the right square, and then
the left square.  Manuever the ship out through the hatch in the upper right
wall.

3) This maze is so easy I'm not going to take you through it.  If you can't
figure it out on your own, you're too lame to be playing Manhunter: New York.

4) After you come up through the bathrooms at the park, see Philippe getting
into his ship, and it says, "Meanwhile, back in your cockpit...", take a closer
look at the screen.

5) You're now flying around New York.  You must drop bombs on Sites Alpha,
Beta, Gamma, and Delta.  It doesn't matter in which order.  First go to the
Statue of Liberty.  See the big island with the star where the Statue should
be?  Guess again, it ain't there.  See the two small islands to the left?  Go
to the lower left island.  Press Enter to Drop the Bomb.  Try to hit the
colored square on the island.  You may have to experiment.  Next go up to the
screen with the Hospital, The Empire State Building, and Grand Central Station.
You now have to contend with Philippe.  Don't let him touch you, if he does
you've got a problem.  Drop a bomb on the Empire State Building.  If you don't
remember where it is, load in a game where it's a location on your map, and
take a note of where it is.  Next, drop one on Grand Central Station.  Finally,
on Bellevue Hospital.  If you mess up with even ONE bomb, let Phil kill you
and start over, you need all four to hit their targets.  As I said before,
this exact order isn't necessary, but I went from hardest to hit to easiest to
hit, so you don't hit all the easy ones and mess up on the hard ones after all
that work.

You've now done all the typing and keypressing necessary.  All that remains
is to watch the ending sequences and tell all your friends that you "solved"
Manhunter: New York.

We know these aren't Complete Key-By-Key Docs, but if you can't solve the game
from this, you're one DUMB FUCK!!!
