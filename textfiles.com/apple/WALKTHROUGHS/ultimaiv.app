  The Dark Ages of Britannia is the name given to that long span of time when
the infamous Triad of Evil stalked the lands and challenged all for the
supremacy of the soul...yet evil abounds but in isolated pockets and in the
hearts of men.	A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all
frontiers through the mastery of magic and force.  Daemons, dragons, and
long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed.  The
seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed
enemy types and will only survive such encounters only by strategic use of
weapons and terrain.  Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to
the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits.....

  Characters:

  Mage.  The Magi of Britannia gather in Moonglow, near the Lycaeum, where they
can study the ancient mystical scrolls of the Library.	They are restricted to
wear only cloth armour and can only use staves, daggers, and slings.  Mages
have spell points equal to twice their intelligence.

  Bard.  The Bards of Britain entertain the people with their wonderful stories
and songs of heroic deeds.  Bards not only chronicle deeds of valor, but perform
them as well.  The preferred weapon is a sling, although they may use a cross-
bow at times.  Leather armour is the only kind they may wear, and they have
magic points equal to their intelligence.

  Fighter.  From the town of Jhelom hail the mighty fighters passing their lives
in training.  They may use all armour and weapons but have no magic ability.

  Druids.  The Druids are fierce fighters, especailly when defending their
beloved groves.  They hold all trees to be sacred and their town of Yew lies
deep in the woods.  Druids are also impressive practioners of the mystic arts
and their knowledge of herbs is without peer.  They may fight with all all bows,
but prefer the mace.  Since they may not wear metal leather is their armour.
Their magic points is equal to one and a half of their intelligence.

  Tinker.  The Tinkers of Minoc are both highly skilled artisans and superb
fighters.  They may use any weapon and non-magical armour, and can repair broken
weapons.  Half of their intelligence is their magic points.

  Paladin.  These great fighters live in the town of Trinsic in the southern
part of Britannia.  They are like fighters but are able to use magic, their
spells points their intelligence, because of their deep beliefs in good.

  Ranger.  Off the western shore of the mainland lies the Ranger retreat of
Skara Brae.  They are well-versed in woods lore and fight well with most
weapons, but shun all but leather armour.  Their spell points are the same as
the Paladin.

  Shepherd.  It is uncertain whether Shepherds are skilled at anything, having
no magic or fighting ability.  They are highly valued for their knowledge of the
land and humility.

Well, that should be enough.  Anything else said would spoil the game.	In
Ultima IV, try to get as many people to join your party (you can have seven
others) so that chances of dy- ing are slim.  If you have any more questions,
leave me mail at Free Haven - (415) 946-9813.

						     Until then,
