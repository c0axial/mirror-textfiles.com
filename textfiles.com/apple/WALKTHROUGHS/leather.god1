By the way, here's some other stuff helpful to solving the game...... 

The coded message reads "Your mission is to contact wife number ____ of
the sultan and get the secret map. Identify yourself to her by asking
her to kiss your kneecaps." The correct number is the number you see
backwards. 

To get the coin (ten marsmids) go into the vizicomm booth and PULL KNOB
and OPEN BOX. Out falls the coin. 

To get the mouse, SHOW PAINTING TO MOUSE, GET MOUSE. Pretty easy. 

To get the frog(surprise!!), PUT BALM ON LIPS, PUT PIN ON NOSE, DROP
ALL, PUT HANDS OVER EARS, CLOSE EYES, KISS FROG. Then get everything. 

To get to Cleveland and get the headlight, go to Wattz Upp Dock and then
go to the oasis next to it. PUT STAIN ON CIRCLE, ENTER CIRCLE. You're in
Cleveland.  Get all the shit like the sack, rake, trellis, then go up to
the bedroom. Tear the sheet, tie the strips into a rope, tie the rope to
the bed. Tell Trent you weigh 190 lbs., then he'll get the headlight for
you. To get out of Cleveland, move the sod and enter the circle. 

To get the rubber hose, KNOCK ON DOOR,D,GIVE CHOCOLATE TO GORILLA,Z,Z,
FUCK FEMALE GORILLA,EAT CHOCOLATE,OPEN CAGE,GET HOSE,OUT,UNSTRAP

If you remove all the words from the scrap of paper, the words say
"Hissing frightens flytraps."

solve with this. later all.....
