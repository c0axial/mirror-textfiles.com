:==========================================================:


I assume you have the codewheel and a working copy of the
game. If your copy crashes, you'll need the digi-patched
copy. (Or get the patches and make a new character disk and
transfer your characters. More on this later.)


Skara Brae:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Right when you enter the town, enter the building directly
in front of you. There you'll find a whole stash of goodies
(weapons, armor, etc.) Go to the old man in the review board
and read all the info he has to say. Then go to the Mad
God's temple and say "TARJAN" to get to the catacombs. Clean
them out, get experience, and build up your characters.
After the second level of the catacombs, exit the place, get
healed and stuff, then return and this time say "CHAOS" to
the priest. You'll enter Unter Brae. On the first level,
you'll be asked for the rhyming word. Say "BLUE". Behind
there are the stairs. However, you'd save your hit points if
you did a phase door from the opposite side. On the next
level, the answer to the riddle is "SHADOW". Then on the
next level, the answer is "SWORD". Go downstairs through the
portal and make the following moves (N=north, E=east, etc.):
N.E.N.E.E.S.S.E.E.E.E.N.N.W.N.N.W.W.N.N
This way you will avoid all the annoying spinners. When you
enter the next area, you'll be able to go straight through.
However, by taking the direct route, you get hit with lots
of traps and stuff. So, before you head north, go west or
east one square, THEN go all the way north. You'll save a
lot of hassle that way. In the next section of this level,
you should go directly west then all the way north. Behind
the door you get to will be Brilhasti. Get your characters
healed and all, cast your favorite shield spells and bard
songs, then go for it.

You'll have to tromp around in the same dungeon until you
can get a chronomancer. You should get one as soon as
possible, and at the same time, build an archmage with your
other mage.

Once you get your chronomancer, <T>alk to the old man, get
the spells you need, and go to the quiet grove in the
wilderness (NW of Skara Brae). Cast the spell to Arboria
and...

Arboria:
~~~~~~~~
Tromp around in the wilderness until you get the Arefolia
leaves and a few acorns. Enter Ciera Brannia and go to the
wizard's guild. Buy the GILL spell for all your magic users.
Go to the King's Castle near the center of town and read the
info. Then go to the lake behind the fisherman's hut and
enter the palace. Be sure you have some sort of container
(i.e. canteen) and find the Life Spring. <U>se the container
there as many times as you can (I think it's 9) and then
leave. Then go to Valarian's Tower and get to the top floor.
On the third level you'll need to <U>se the acorn at the
hole in the wall, then <U>se the Water of Life in the
canteen. Go to level 4 and get the Nightspear. Then, go to
the Festering Pit. Go downstairs (you'll need to go up and
down some portals a couple times to get to the northeast
area of level 2). Find and kill Tslotha. Get his head and
heart. Return to the King in town and then go to the Sacred
Grove. Tromp around until you find the tomb door. SAVE YOUR
GAME! Enter and <U>se the heart, which puts it in the bowl.
Use the Water of Life, turn to face east, wait a move, then
enter the door. Head to the SE corner and get Valarian's Bow
and quiver. Return to the place you entered Arboria from (it
says "The ground seems to be worn here") and cast the spell
out of Arboria. Return to the old man for your next quest.

A few notes here. Every time you enter a new land, the only
way out is from the "Ground seems to be well worn here"
location. You're also probably getting itchy for a geomancer
by now, but give it up, you won't get one for quite a long
time. Also, whenever you can buy a new spell or bard song,
do it.

Gelidia:
~~~~~~~~
Go to Cold Peak (NE of the camp) to get to Gelidia. If you
stay outside too long here, you'll freeze. Therefore, don't
go exploring around, since there isn't much to see. The only
place you need to go to is the small hut to the northeast of
the Ice Keep. Read the stuff there, then go to the Keep. A
few groundrules: The answer to the "Speak your name,
Defender" question is either "HAWKSLAYER" or "ALENDAR" (both
should work). There isn't anything worth mentioning on the
second level of the Keep, so forget it. In the northwest
corner of level one, at the creature, cast the following
spells: INWO, WIHE, FOFO, INVI. Then enter the Grey tower.
Go to the top level and kill the keepers of the tower and
get the smoky lens. Next, return to the Ice Keep and go to
the curtain in the NE corner. Cast: LEVI, ANMA, PHDO. Enter
the White tower, go to the top level, kill the keepers, get
the Crystal lens and return. Go to the SE corner, and at the
black wall cast: LERE, SHSP, FEAR, SUEL, and SPBI. Enter the
black tower, and (you guessed it) go to the top level, kill
the keepers, get the black lens, and return. Now go to the
slab of white marble on the north side of the level and use
the three lenses. Go downstairs two levels and at the
riddle, answer "CALA". Go through the door and get the Wand
of Power and Sphere of Lanatir. Return to the old man in
Skara Brae.

Lucencia:
~~~~~~~~~
To get here, go to the brook east of Skara Brae. In
Lucencia, wander around until you find the following roses:
yellow, red, white, and blue. Make note of where the dead
rosebush is. Normally, you'd go to the Bard's Hall in town
to get clues, but you won't need them now. There might be a
Bard Song there to learn, so you might as well go. Then go
to the Violet Mountain and enter. Make sure you have a
container. Get to level two and find and kill the Rainbow
dragon. <U>se the container and collect some of its blood.
Get the key. Leave and SAVE YOUR GAME! Go to Cyanis's Tower
and go to level three. Kill Cyanis and get whatever artifact
he has (I forgot what it was.) Go to the dead rosebush and
use the dragon's blood. Get the rainbow rose. [NOTE: If your
copy crashed when you left Cyanis's Tower after killing him
(i.e. the land was really strange), get a fresh copy of the
character disk, apply the Digi-Patches, and transfer your
characters to it. That will fix all errors.] Then go to
Alliria's tomb and use whatever it was that you got from
Cyanis at the black crystal on level one. Go downstairs and
follow the corridors. You will encounter several women. They
will ask for different flowers:
They ask for      Give them
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Flower of Truth    White flower
Valor              Blue
Kinship            Red
Nature             Yellow
Flower of Alliria  Rainbow
Now you'll be able to get through to get the Crown of Truth
and Belt of Alliria. Return to the old man in Skara Brae.

Kinestia:
~~~~~~~~~
Get here from the Old Dwarf Mine. Wander around, get
Hawkslayer, and go to the Private Quarters. Find and get the
Left Key. Talk to the dying Ferofist. In the Barracks get
the Right Key. In the workshop, at the portal on the floor,
use the two keys. Turn the right key 18 times and the left
key 15 times. Go down. Make your way down to the Viscous
Plane. Use the GILL spell here. Head to the SW corner of ple
plane and enter the sanctum. Find Urmech, and tell him that
we can be friends. Get Ferofist's Helm and Hammer. Now, go
to Urmech again, and he'll make you a geomancer. Choose
carefully who you have it done to. I chucked my bard for the
spells, since he was a lousy fighter and I figured he could
risk his songs. Others have won by making a fighter the
geomancer. Use your best jugment. (In all actuality, I
didn't use the Geomancer spells much. By the time he gets
the good ones, you have NUKE, which is the killer spell.)
Return to the old man.

Tenebrosia:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Cast the spell at Shadow Rock to get here. Go to shadow
canyon and map the entire place. There will be a couple
places where you can't seem to get to. By using a phase door
(some places work, some don't), get into these areas. You'll
find the shadow lock. Take it and then go to tar quarry.
Have a container with you. SAVE YOUR GAME! Try to get to the
building in the center of the map. Fill the container (<U>se
it) at the tar fountain. Leave and go to the dark copse. In
the center of the map is one square you can't access. Go to
one of the trees surrounding it (either N, S, W or E) and
<U>se the tar. The tree will burn down and you'll be able to
get the shadow door. Leave and go to the place outside that
says it is the middle of nowhere. Use the shadow door and
shadow lock. Then enter Sceadu's place. Go to the second
level and totally ignore that stuff in the center of the
map. Along the north wall (in the middle) will be a secret
door allowing access to the northern area of the map. Enter,
go to the one little room, kill Sceadu and get his stuff.
Return to Skara Brae.

Tarmitia:
~~~~~~~~~
You get here from the Vale of Lost Warriors. This land is a
real pain. Follow the directions carefully and you'll be out
soon. Go to Troy and at the death head, say "ARES". You will
be zapped to the one unaccessable square in another time.
You will get the next name, and you must find the right time
and say it. This is the order:
Time           Name:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Troy           Ares
K'un Wang      Yen-Lo-Wang (don't forget the hyphens)
Rome           Mars
Hiroshima      Susa-No-O
Stalingrad     Svarazic
Nottingham     St. George
Wasteland      Sdiabm
Berlin         Tyr
Those are the exact spellings, hyphens and periods included.
Type them exactly as shown. It may be possible to skip
everything except Berlin and answer Tyr. After you say Tyr,
it asks for the real name. Type "WERRA". You'll be zapped to
another place. Find Werra and kill him. He will be alive
after you kill him, give you a speech, and then you'll be
attacked by some Black Slayers. Run from them and then go
get Werra's shield. Return to Skara Brae for the last quest.

Malefia:
~~~~~~~~
Get here from the bubbling pool of slop south of the camp a
ways. Be sure you had gotten all of the magical goodies from
the storage building in Skara Brae. Then, get the
Strifespear from Hawkslayer and find all of the statues.
This land consists of three levels, each interwoven with
portals. It is essential that you map these three levels,
since you will have to bounce up and down between lots o'
portals before you finish. You will find six statues, each
one of one of the people you encountered in the other lands:
Alliria (on level 1), Valarian (lev.2), Lanatir (lev.2),
Sceadu (lev.3), Werra (lev.3) and Ferofist (lev.3). At each
one, use their respective artifact (i.e. at Alliria's
statue, <U>se the Belt of Alliria, etc.). After you have
visited all three of them, a door on level 3 will open up
allowing access to the large area in the center (previously
it had been just the outline of a door). SAVE YOUR GAME! To
really succed from here on, you must have lots of Harmonic
Gems, and at least two spellcasters. Both must be able to
cast the DIVA and NUKE spells. Go through the door and kill
the religious nuts. Head for the center of the map and SAVE
YOUR GAME before and after each of these large battles. Go
through the door, kill the guys there, and you'll be
teleported to Tarjan's tower. Go to the center and there you
will find Tarjan. You will fight a group before him, then
you take him on. When you kill him, you are teleported
somewhere, and you are made a god!!! You win!!!

Here's a general strategy for fighting the last few battles.
Starting with the Religious nuts, this is the best method.
Attack with your front guys (having a troth lance is good,
plus the Strifespear). Each round, hide your thief. Then,
with one mage, cast NUKE. With the other mage, cast DIVA. By
doing this, the nuke will blast all the creatures, and the
DIVA will ressurect the dead guys in the first positions.
When your magic points are running low, have one mage use a
gem, while the other casts DIVA. Without a DIVA each round,
the front men will be killed, pushing the mages into the
fighting ranks. They will be killed, and without magic, you
can't win. Constant NUKEs and DIVAs are the key to success.

Another tip: As the game progresses, you'll probably acquire
new items that you can't find an immediate use for. Since
you don't want to overload yourself, create some dummy
characters in the camp for the express purpose of storing
these items. Later on in the game, you may find use for the
items, and by saving them at the camp, you won't have lost
them or had them take up precious space.

Also, a good travelling companion is Black Death (invoked
from a Death figurine.) Tungsten armor is the best, so get
it as soon as you can. As the game progresses, bows become
less useful, so don't waste space with them. (Keep one,
though).

Other than that, you're on your own. The ending is worth the
playing.
