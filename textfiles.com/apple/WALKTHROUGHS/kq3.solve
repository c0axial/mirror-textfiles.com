Once again, thank you very much for all of your help in
solving King's Quest III.  All of the above helped in one way or
another.  Not all provided valid or even intelligent thoughts to
the solution, and you know who you are!  But if it was not for
the support of the following on the Gallifrey, King's Quest III
would have taken much longer to solve.  Once again thank you and
enjoy this tutorial help guide.

- Five O


Special Thanks To SPI for cracking King's Quest III

Special Thanks to Kloey Jr. for his insight and thoughts !!!!!





        This Tutorial is dedicated to my sister, who is now mourning
the death of her pet guinea pig, Max, who left us while I solved
King's Quesy III in the wee hours of the morning.

..................................Amen.


"Hot damn!  I beat your ass.........Jesus-H, it is 4:58 AM.  I
will write the tutorial tomorrow night."

   You have just witnessed the past events of December 7....1941,
a day that will live in infamy, whoops, wrong story.  You have
just witness the events of last night or this morning as the case
may be.  I have now sat down, after three hours or so, of
re-writting my maps so that people, other than ostriches, could
read my handwritting.  If you would like a formal map, please
leave e-mail for Kloey Detect on a BBS near you.

        Well, Sierra On-Line topped themselves again.  This is the
best of the King's Quest series yet, as far as the toughness
goes, but still feel that King's Quest II was more based on fairy
tales and mythology, as in King's Quest.  Well a different guy
did this one.  Look for King's Quest IV between June and July!!!


OBJECT
<*><*><*>

        You have been captured by the evil and homsexual wizard,
Manannan, who if you can't tell by the name, probably lives in
Greenwhitch Village and skips to work wearing a pink flowing
gown.  You must escape from Manannan, rescue your sister, and
take her back to Daventry in time, or the kingdom will suffer
further ruin and be destroyed, which we would not want to happen!

        Because King's Quest III is so large, actually smaller than
King's Quest II, but a bitch to map, it makes it very difficult
to explain step-by-step how to solve it, so I am going to help
you solve this adventure, but not really:  I will provide the
information necessary to do so, but for those of you who do not
want to take the cheaters way out, you will only get the hints
that you need.

Here we go...................


--------
* NOTE *
--------

        The following maps are the most "conceptual" maps that there
are:  You may be at a poin and go south, when you go north to
return to the beginning, you will not return to the point you
started at, but instead to the left or right of the point.

There is a wrap-around effect in the game and applies only to the
north/south borders.




* - Magical item which you may not possess while Manannan is
    still in the house, unless you enjoy being killed!

O - Ocean, which you can not swim across completely or defend
    yourself against sharks!

# - Non-accessable area which is between/in the cliffs, chasms,
    walls, mountains, etc.

You have exactly 30 minutes on the game clock in which to either
gather your stuff together and solve the adventure or return to
the house, stash the stuff under your bed(pay attention, clue #1)
and then wait for Manannan to blow off.

   ---Remember to ALWAYS put the wand back when you return home.
--|
|  ---Remember to ALWAYS shut the trap door & move the book back.
|
|
|----------If you do not do this then Manannan will blow you into
                 cocaine dust.

        Just as a brief note, the majority, 99%, of these maps have
been drawn as an overhead/cross-section view, but I guess by now
you have seen that!

        In the following pages you will have the numeric key to the
above maps.  To understand them you must be at least 10 years in
age and be able to read 3 syllable words.  I will list the # of
the map location followed by the description of the location, and
then all the things that should be done on the screen.  Now bear
in mind that you may have to complete certain conditions in order
to perform certain commands.

Example: 666 - Satan's Party Hole
                        [1]Sacrafice virgin
                        [2]Get pitchfork

Comprende !!??!!




Extra Hints:
[*][*][*][*]

1] To poison the porridge, place the cookie in it.

2] To get the cat fur: a)Hold cat
                       b)Get fur

3] To stay safe during the journey to Daventry while on the
   Pirate's ship, remain at the rear of the ship untill you reach
   land.  You have to figure it out from there.

4] SAVE YOUR GAME FREQUENTLY!!!!!  I used the following format
when I saved a game: 136/210 : Captn.Room : 1:26:23

        This is the score I have : Location : Time used

5] The eagle will drop the feather randomly, so GET IT !


Before we continue let me just say I finished King's Quest III,
but did NOT have all the points, which I don't give a crap
about.  I attribute the loss in points to the following:

Failure to complete the folowing spells:
----------------------------------------
Understanding the Language of creatures(10 pts)
Causing a deep sleep(10 pts)

Failure to gain the following objects:
--------------------------------------
Reptile skins
Acorns

I needed the above two objects to complete the above two spells,
simple, isn't it!  If you could leave e-mail to me, I would
appreciate it to soothe my desire for knowledge.



Points not listed in Map/Tutorial
---------------------------------

Leaving the pirate ship and making it to Daventry(5 pts)
Evading abominable snowman(4 pts)
*Cat fur(1 pt)
*Eagle feather(2 pts)
Dropping fish powder(4 pts)
Poisoning Manannan with porridge(10 pts)

IMPORTANT: When Manannan first appears, he will ask you to go do
                 something, DO IT, you get now points, but then you
                 won't get turned to cocaine either!!

                        \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
That's all folks
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

        It took me about 10 hours to complete the thing and to map
it all out and put the above info in a descent order.  I only got
169/210 points, and I have allready discussed why.

        I have only provided you with 80% of the solve.  What I mean
by this is that you must perform certain actions before others
can obviously take place. I.e.  You must open a brew to drink it,
unless you are a conehead, or on a more understandable basis, you
must have the key in order to open the wizard's safe.

        Well....have fun....live long.....and remember to save your
game frequently......and look for King's Quest IV !!!!
