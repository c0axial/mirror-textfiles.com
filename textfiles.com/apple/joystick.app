  Excuse me?  You say that your 3 yr old joystick just took a dive?  Your
favorite game suddenly dosen't work and you realize you have a GOOD copy?  Then
it hits you:  time to dump $30-$65 into a new JOYSTICK.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  Since the above situation just happened to me very recently, and I had to wade
through tons of junk wares to the junk joystick section and was literally
ATTACKED by salesmen trying to get me to buy a good joystick, I'm going to list
some of the more popular joysticks in this file, as well as some other
alternatives to sticks that you might consider purchasing.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	       Joysticks
	       ---------

TG Products, Inc.
"TG joystick", around $45-55 at good
	       stores and larger soft-
	       ware houses

  This joystick is made by an older company, and as far as I know the first one.
Before my TG crashed, I had it for 4 years (i.e.  it's a rugged little baby) but
once I needed to send it back because my button #0 kept sticking (the company
charged my $10 and sent me a whole new stick, the kind with a round cable
instead of a ribbon cable).  On the bad side, TG wants major $$$ for one of
them, and they do take some getting used to.  One quick note:  the new- er TG
sticks do have a flip/flop switch to change to and from self-centering.  On a
scale of one to ten, TG sticks get a 7.


Kraft Inc. (not the cheese place)
"Kraft joystick", roughly $40.  I have
		  not checked the price
		  on these lately.

  Kraft makes a nice, long-handled stick with the two firebuttons in some odd
places (one on top and the other on the back...but oddly, it's very comfor-
table).  I believe they now have one with little buttons to switch from self
centering to non-self centering.  Once again, I am not familiar with this stick
very much.  Overall, from what I have seen, they are a good 8.


CH products
"Mach ][" and "Mach III" joysticks, $45
			 and $55 re-
			 spectivly.

  After my TG crashed, I went over to a Mach III and so far have not been
disappointed.  The difference between the two (besides $10) is that the III has
a button #0 on the top of the han- dle while the ][ does not.  To tell you the
truth, if they had any ]['s left I would have saved $10 and gone with it.  Both
have slide-switches to turn on and off self-centering and knobs (yes, knobs) to
change the x and y deviation from the original axis (i.e.  the little slidy
things on a T.G.  and most other joysticks).  The Mach III might be rated down
because the handle is kind of stubby (with the button on top) and too large for
fingers but too small for hands.  I suppose all sticks take get- ting used to
though.  Overall, let's give them an 8.  So far the sticks have been good, eh?


Apple Computer Inc.
"Apple joystick", $60-$65.

  BLEECH!  This joystick is SUCKY!  Yes, that's right, it SUCKS!  Nothing
against Apple, hell they make great computers, but the joystick need some HELP.
The thing falls apart quickly (so I have noticed from many people) and most also
say that it isin't very respondent (i.e.  you move left and it says 'huh?  left?
ohhh left!  duhhh').  The buttons are nice, I think.  While the Kraft and CH
products both just go down and stop (nice but 'dead') and the TG's have a bad
habit of no stop or very little (that's why the buttons are first to go), the
Apple has a nice, loud CLICK when you press one of the buttons down.  To tell
you the truth, you have my warning not to get one.  Overall, a 6.  (7 1/2 if
they didn't fall apart so quickly...)

	   Some Alternatives
	   -----------------

  Now that I have covered joysticks, let me just touch some quick points on
other products.

TG paddles- I got a pair for $10.  Nice
	    if you like a game that
	    requires paddles, and fun
	    to open and customize.

Sirus Joyport- Plug Atari-style sticks
	       into your Apple.  There
	       are a few things you
	       should know though.
	       1. Not made anymore.
	       2. Requires special
		  programming (if the
		  game dosen't actually
		  say 'joyport' then it
		  won't work with it.)
	       You can, however, plug
	       in 2 Atari Sticks and 2
	       regular sticks (or a
	       stick and a paddle!)
	       and choose with a small
	       switch on the top of the
	       unit.

Wico joystick Adapter- Same as above
		       but no special
		       programming!
		       But, for $20 it
		       still dosen't
		       work with every-
		       thing.

TG Trakball- I think we all know what
	     a trackball is, if you
	     don't, imagine an upside-
	     down mouse that sits in
	     one spot and you roll it's
	     ball(s?).	Let me say that
	     it's no good unless you
	     live for games that re-
	     quired them (Centipede on
	     the Apple is very easy
	     with it).	For $70 I say
	     forget it.

  I am sure that I missed a few sticks and probably a few 'alter- natives' but
those are the main ones.  If you have any comments, feel free to call RAPS (the
number is on the top) and leave me feedback.  Or leave me e-mail on Apple Manor
[716-654-POOF].  Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
