  Copy a program is a minor technique easily mastered.	The major problem with
copying a program is figuring out how it is protected, this is obvious.

  To see how a disk is protected, first listen to the drive as it boots up the
disk.  Be prepared to know what a normal boot sounds like, then check for any
differences.  If you hear a "swishing" or "syncopated rhythm" the disk is
proboably using nibble counting.  A procedure in which the number of "nibbles"
on a disk is compared to the number actually put on at the company.  Strange, as
it may seem, a disk with the same information with another disk have differ- ent
number of nibbles.  If this is found, finding the track is usually easy.  It is
normally a track that cannot be copied easily for it usually only has a series
of one number on the entire track, which nibble copiers tend to be quite
irritated at.  To copy that track use the option for nibble counting.  LS 5.0,
EDD 1,2, &3, NA ][ vA,vB,vC, Copy ] all have an option on the menu to "keep" or
"preserve" the nibble count.  Others like LS 4.1 have parameters to change.  (LS
4.1 = 4C=1B).

  Another common scheme is to Syncronize the tracks.  That is, to place the
sectors on one track in a special relationship with another sector on a separate
track.	The sound of this is an unusually long time on a track.  It sounds like
a "swinging pendulum" as it goes from track to track.  All copy programs have an
option to Sync Tracks.	Just choose it.

  Other techniques involve changing headers (track starts and data starts) and
ending data.  Use a "Nibble Editor" to inspect the original disk.  You will see,
usually plainly, a series of FF's or FE's or some other number (not 96's
though...) hese are called Sync Bytes.	They tell the program to get ready to
receive data.  The next bytes are called the header bytes.  They tell the
computer what track, sector, and volume of the sector.	The first three bytes
are the start bytes.  They tell the computer that this is the Start of Actual
Information.  Normally they are D5 AA 96.  They may be changed.  If they are
changed, enter the data into the copy program.	Usually through parms.	although
some copiers (one is NA ][ ) can enter it from a menu.	Later in the data you
will see a smaller series of the same Sync Bytes.  They are there as a delay.
Next comes three more bytes to show that data is next.	They are normally D5 AA
AD.  If changed, enter the altered bytes into the copier.

  These are most of the techinques that are used.  But do NOT forget that just a
normal run might work.

  As homework, try to see the headers in a normal DOS 3.3 disk.  Have Fun and
Success A.S.R.
