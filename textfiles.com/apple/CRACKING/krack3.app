This weeks topic: Mr. Cool
=-----------------------------------------------------------------------------=

   Mr. Cool is a 3-dimensional Q-Bert type game that has copy protection differ
ent that the others described in this tutorial so far.

=> Boot your DOS 3.3 system master and insert a blank disk
=> Type INIT HELLO. When you get the ] or > prompt, type DELETE HELLO.
=> Insert Mr. Cool disk and type "BRUN MRCOOL"
=> When the picture comes up, hit [ RESET ]. Type "CALL -151" to enter monitor.
=> Type 4000: EA EA EA (this removes the nibble count)
=> Type 8500: 60 (this removes the high score read)
=> Type 876C: 60 (this removes the high score write)
=> Insert the disk you just formatted and type "BSAVE MR. COOL,A$4000,L$5500"

Notes: The "4000: EA EA EA" is the start of the nibble count routine. Putting
"EA EA EA" in locations $4000-$4002 places the NOP (or No OPeration) code in
place of the jump to the nibble count. The "8500: 60" removes the high score
read routine. The routine starts at $8500 and by placing a $60 (ReTurn from
Subroutine) it never executes the routine and jumps back to the main progam.
"876C: 60" removes the high score write. It is the same as above. The reason
for disabling the high score functions is simple. If not disabled, when the
high socres are written to the disk, it would overwrite part of the MR. COOL
file or whatever else happens to be on the sectors that it uses to store the
names and scores. The read function is disabled because when it read the data
from the disk it woud crash because those aren't the names and scores.
