This weeks topic: Homeword

   Homeword, by On-line systems, is a fantastic word processor, which is both
well doccumented and easy to use. It is the first word processor, to my
knowledge, to incorporate icons at all menu prompts. It comes with a cassette
which helps in teaching you how to use the program. The de-protection is fairly
simple, and like the Xerox series, requires only a sector editor. If you do
not know how to use the Inspector sector editor, the docs can be found on
Sherwood Forest ///.

=> Read Track 10, Sector A.
=> Change byte $00 from $CE to $60
=> Write Track 10, Sector A back to disk

This does the exact same thing as the Xerox de-protecting. Note that $CE stands
for DEC (DECrement accumulator). By replacing it with $60, RTS (ReTurn from
Subroutine), you are replacing the first byte of the nibble count routine, and
telling it to jump back to the main program, without executing the nibble count
at all. If the nibble count were to be executed the program would crash,
re-boot, or freeze up.
