Im new from Wa. Just uploaded a pic i drew a while back called Thexder. Its an
original freehand drawing of the box color but looks better...(i modified the
background to my taste (new order)) so, hope ya check it out and enjoy it.
Also, here is a cheat for Wings Of Fury
 Access the monitor after booting and selecting a level
 for infinite bombs, missiles, and torpedoes, type these three things
 01/a9aa:ff
 01/a9ce:ff
 01/a9bd:ff
 
And there ya have it..
