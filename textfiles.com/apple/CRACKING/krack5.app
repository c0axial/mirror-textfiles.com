This weeks topic: Electronic Arts (EOA)
=-----------------------------------------------------------------------------=

   Electronic Arts, are the makers of One On One, Last Gladiator, Archon, Cut
and Paste, and many other excelent products. Their protection scheme is fairly
standard and the text below will mork for most of their stuff.

=> Boot the DOS 3.3 System Master. When you get the ] prompt, type INIT HELLO.

=> Next, insert your Advanced Demuffin disk in the drive. Type "BRUN ADVANCED
   DEMUFFIN 1.1"

=> Type CALL -151 to enter monitor then 3 machine language codes:
    [1] B8F1: BB  [ RETURN ]  [2] B8FC: CF  [ RETURN ]	[3] 803G  [ RETURN ]

=> Boot up a sector editor and read Track $20, Sector $0F. Write it onto Track
   $03, Sector $00.

=> Now use a bit copy program (such as EDD or Locksmith) to copy tracks 0-2 of
   the origional disk to your converted disk.

     This converts the disk to standard DOS 3.3, except the RWTS...lets take
     care of that right now...

=> Now use a sector editor to read Track $02, Sector $03. Change bytes:

   [1] $47 from $BB to $BA  [2] $51 from $CF to $AD

     This changes the RWTS checksums on the disk to standard DOS 3.3 RWTS.

=> Now read Track $01, Sector $0F

=> Change bytes $68-$6A from 20 A2 A1 to 18 60 EB

     This removes the nibble count.

-> If you are working on Cut & Paste or Last Gladiator stop here <-

=> One On One and others: Read Track $0C, Sector $04. Change bytes $06-$08 from
   A0 18 88 to 18 60 C8. Changes bytes $DC and $DD from A0 FF to 18 60. Read
   Track $09, Sector $02. Change byte $1F from $01 to $FD.

     You removed the secondary nibble count found in most EOA games except Last
Gladiator and Cut & Paste. One On One is the example used here. If this last ni
bble count is not removed, the game will function normally but the players heads
 will spin (How sneaky!!!).
