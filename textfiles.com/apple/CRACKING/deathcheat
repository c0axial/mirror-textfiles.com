About "'Death Sword' - Cheat"
-----------------------------

Let's face it, Death Sword is a great game...but... This cheat gives you
unlimited "hit-points".  Warning: You can still get your head cut off and on
Game #2, after killing off 8 of those suckers, the big guy in Pink or Purple
(take your pick) will start whipping fireballs at you...try not to get hit..

Oh, and if you really feel like messing around with the number of hit points
your opponent starts with, its on Track 7,Sector 0,Byte $1E...

Later...
