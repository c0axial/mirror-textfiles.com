****************************************

AS WE PROMISED, WE HAVE FOUND HOW TO
IMPLIMENT THE ITEM REGISTERS TO YOUR
BENEFIT. TO USE THIS, GIVE YOUR CHAR
8 ITEMS. NOW BREAK OUT THE SECTOR
EDITOR. ON THE 54TH BYTE AFTER YOUR
CHAR'S NAME (REMEMBER, IT HAS ONLY 9
LETTERS), YOU WILL FIND A "01". THE
NEXT TWO BYTES WILL BE "00" AND ANOTHER
NUMBER. THIS SECOND NUMBER IS THE ITEM
INDEX. EVERY EIGHT BYTES FOLLOWING, YOU
WILL FIND THREE BYTES IN THIS FORMAT
AND THE THIRD IS THE ITEM INDEX. THIS
WILL CONTINUE 8 TIMES (8 ITEMS). BELOW
ARE LISTED THE ITEMS AND THEIR
CORRESPONDING HEXADECIMAL CODES. SO FAR
WE HAVE ONLY DISSECTED THE ORIGINAL
SCENARIO. KOD WILL BE FORTHCOMING.

           KOD BUG

  YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT! ANOTHER BUG
IN SOME VERSIONS OF KOD...THERE IS NO
KOD'S ARMOR! YOU MAY DEFEAT THE "MAGIC
ARMOR" BUT WILL ONLY RECEIVE AN UNSET.
(WHAT SHAPE AN UNSET ACTUALLY TAKES IS
BEYOND US). WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT AN
UPDATE POLICY-TALK TO YOUR FRIENDLY
NEIGHBORHOOD INC'S.


.......................................


        NEW ITEM GARBAGE
        ----------------

DIEDEM OF MALOR - HELM OF MALOR. ONE
USE ONLY.

USE AND CARE OF MARASUMA AND SHURIKEN-
IF YOU HAVE TWO OF EITHER OF THE ABOVE,
USE THE SPECIAL POWER OF ONE AND THE
FIGHTING ABILITY WILL BE INCREASED
GREATLY.

.......................................


      KOD HAMAN AND MAHAMAN
      ---------------------

  WHEN WE FIRST USED THESE SPELLS IS
THE FIRST SCENARIO, WE VOWED NEVER TO
USE THEM AGAIN. WE DID NOT ENJOY THE
RANDOM FACTORS INVOLVED IN VIEW OF THE
EXPERIENCE LOSS. NOW WE HAVE FOUND THAT
A MENU IS GIVEN WHEN THE SPELL IS CAST.
THE MENU CONTAINS THREE OF THESE:
   1) HEAL THE PARTY - HEALS SOME HITS
ALL AROUND.
   2) CURE THE PARTY - CURES DISORDERS
LISTED IN STATUS (POISON, P-LYZE, ETC).
   3) PROTECT THE PARTY - GIVES THE
PARTY -10 AC UNTIL THE CHAR IS NEXT
EQUIPPED.
   4) TELEPORT THE MONSTERS - GETS RID
OF NASTIES, LEAVES TREASURE.
   5) INCREASE POWER OF MAGIC
   6) SILENCE THE MONSTERS - ALWAYS
WORKS.

THE SPELL STILL DRAINS LEVELS.


.......................................

            MALOR COORDINATES
            -----------------

  WE HAVE FOUND THE MALOR COORDINATES
FOR TWO OF THE KOD ITEMS. THANX TO
ST1306 FOR THIS.

WE WILL GIVE THE KOD ITEMS ONLY AS WE
ASUME THEY ARE IN THE SAME PLACE IN ALL
SCENARIOS.


   SHIELD:
            N:  0
            E:  0
            D:  2

    HELM:   N:  4
            E: 11
            D:  3

THESE ALL WORK FROM THE ENTRANCE.
REMEMBER, KEEP YOUR RIGHT PINKIE ON THE
RESET KEY!

.......................................


    HOW TO USE UNUSABLE ITEMS
    -------------------------


TO DO THIS FIND THE ITEM REGISTER AFTER
YOUR CHAR'S NAME. IT SOULD BE IN THE
FORMAT OF 01 00 XX (THE XX BEING THE
ITEM). STARTING AT THE BYTE BEFORE THE
01, COUNT BACK 5 BYTES. ON THE FITH
BYTE, PUT IN "01". THIS WILL MAKE THE
ITEM EQUIPPED AND THEREFORE USABLE.
FOR EXAMPLE, A MAGE COULD USE A
HRATHNIR. FUN HUH?

.......................................

BY THE WAY, WE HAVE FOUND THE LOCATION
OF THE MOST ANNOYING MESSAGE IN
KIZARDRY/KOD. THE OUCH! WHEN YOU WALK
INTO A WALL. IT IS ON TRACK 12 SECTOR 0
USING ASCII EQUIVILENTS, YOU CAN CHANGE
THIS TO ANY FOUR LETTER EXCLAMAITION
YOU SO DESIRE (WE WONT TELL YOU WHAT WE
PUT IN).

WELL THAT'S ALL...
