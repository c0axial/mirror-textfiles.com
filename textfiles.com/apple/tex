 About TEX
 ---------
 
 This program is FREEWARE.  You can distribute TEX freely, just don't
 sell it.  I do ask that you make sure that this doc file is made
 available with the program.  You are under no obligation to pay
 anything for TEX.
 
 However, if you like this program and want to show your appreciation
 I do accept gratuities.  If you send me $10.00 I will send you the
 latest versions of both TEX and BLU - Binary II Library Utility and
 any other FREEWARE programs that I might write.  The $10.00 will also
 entitle you to 1 additional free update that will be AUTOMATICALLY
 mailed to you when I update the programs again.  This way I make
 a little money and you do not have to spend the money downloading
 the updates.  After the first mailing and the free update I will
 continue to mail out updates, but I will include a bill for $3.00
 to cover disk and shipping costs.  This way you will always have
 the most current versions.  I will do all mail outs before I upload
 them to any source.  You will find that in the long run this method
 will be cheaper for you than the connect charges would be for
 downloading this program.  My address is:

 I repeat YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY ANYTHING FOR TEX.

 Program Selectors
 -----------------
 
 TEX supports a start-up pathname.  If you enter a start-up pathname
 from a program selector like PROSEL or ECP8 the program will use
 that pathname and strip the linefeeds from it and then exit by the
 quit code.  If there is no start-up pathname then TEX will display
 the menu and you can go on from there.
 
 
 The Menu
 --------
 
 You can select a menu item by either the first letter in the item or
 by using the arrow keys to move the inverse bar to your selection and
 then pressing return.  You will be returned to the menu after all
 processing is done.
 
 
 Selecting Files To Be Processed
 -------------------------------
 
 After making your menu selection you will be prompted for a source
 directory name and where necessary a destination pathname or target
 directory.  You can use the TAB key to skip to the next '/' in the
 pathname shown or OA-TAB to back up to the previous '/'.  The DELETE
 key will delete characters and the <-- --> keys will backspace and
 move the cursor forward.  When prompted for a destination pathname
 be sure and enter a pathname for a file not a directory.
 
 After the directory(s) are selected a catalog of the source directory
 will be displayed.  Using the up and down arrows will move the bar
 accordingly.  The left arrow will unselect an item if it was selected
 otherwise it will move the bar up.  The right arrow will select an
 item if not already selected otherwise it will move the bar down.
 Pressing the space bar will toggle a selection also.  In addition a
 OA-space or a control-a (^A) will toggle all the items.  Pressing
 return will implement the selected task using the just picked
 filenames.
 
 
 Filename Queue
 --------------
 
 The files selected are put into a linked list.  This means you can
 select the files in the order you want them processed.  This is
 particularly handy for the APPEND function. 
 
 
 Type Files
 ----------
 
 When typing files pressing any key will pause the display.  Pressing
 any key again will start the typing again.  Pressing ESC will jump to
 the end of the current file and pressing ESC again will exit back to
 the main menu.  Pressing a 'p' or 'P' will toggle the paging option.
 When paging is on the file will be displayed a screen full at a time
 and will wait for a keypress between each page.
 
 
 Append Files
 ------------
 
 This feature merges text files that you have selected into one file.
 After the merge you will be asked if you want to delete the original
 separate files.
 
 
 Strip Linefeeds
 ---------------
 
 The linefeed stripper creates a temp file with an '.S' extension.
 When it is done processing it renames the original file with an '.ORG'
 extension and renames the temp file to the original file name.
 
 At the five bytes located at $204E-2052 are the additional characters
 that TEX will strip out of a file.  They are currently set to $1A for
 control-z and $7F for delete.  You can use a block editor to change
 these defaults.
 
 
 Carriage Return Remover
 ----------------------- 
 
 The carriage return remover creates a temp file with an '.R' extension.
 When it is done processing it renames the original file with an '.ORG'
 extension and renames the temp file to the original file name. 
 
 Before processing the files you will be prompted for some settings as
 follows:
 
 1)   From the 'Minimum line length' prompt you can use the up and down
 arrow keys to change the default length.  The purpose of the minimum
 line length is to try to maintain formatting in short lines.  If you
 use the default of '60' TEX will not remove the carriage returns in
 lines of less than 60 characters.
 DEFAULT = 60
 
 2)   Removing a space immediately before a CR.  If 'Yes' then TEX
 assumes this space is extraneous and removes it.  If 'No' then TEX
 leave this space in.
 DEFAULT - Yes
 
 3)   Removing CR when followed by only ONE space.  If 'Yes then TEX
 assumes this space is not for formatting and removes the CR.  If 'No'
 then TEX assumes it is for formatting and leaves the CR in.
 DEFAULT - Yes
 
 4)   If prompting for settings is answered 'Yes' then you will be
 prompted for all the settings between every file.  If 'No' then you
 are only prompted the one time.
 DEFAULT - No
 
 When you press return to select the files to be processed if you
 hold down the open-apple key then the above defaults will be used
 and you will not be prompted for any of them.
 
 
 Deleting Files
 --------------
 
 TEX will not delete files that are locked.  I have to draw the line
 somewhere, TEX can't do everything <grin>!
 
 
 Renaming Files
 --------------
 
 When you choose the rename feature you will be prompted for the files
 as usual and then the files will be displayed one at a time with the
 cursor over them to allow you to rename them.  Pressing escape will
 skip that file and go to the next one.
 
 
 Using The Mouse
 ---------------
 
 If you have a mouse TEX will find it and allow you to use it instead
 of using the arrow keys and you can use the mouse button to select
 files though you still have to press return to start the process after
 the files are selected.
 
 The sensitivity of the mouse is at location $204B when the program
 is in memory.  This is the $4B byte after the beginning of the program.
 It is currently set at $08.  This means the mouse must move 8 increments
 to move inverse bar.  If you want to change this use a block editor or
 from the basic prompt enter:
 
 CALL-151   ;enter monitor
 BLOAD BLU,TSYS,A$2000  ;load file
 204B:XX    ;XX being the new value. Higher value=lesser sensitivity.
 BSAVE BLU,TSYS,A$2000  ;save file
 ^C         ;back to basic
 
 
 Final Words
 -----------
 
 If you encounter any bugs or come up with any suggestions for
 improving the program please let me know.  I will consider all
 reasonable suggestions for improvements
