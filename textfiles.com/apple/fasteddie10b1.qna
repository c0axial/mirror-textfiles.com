Fast Eddie (possibly) Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------


1. Registration

  We have signed up at Kagi Shareware, a service specialized in 
processing shareware fees. Kagi is collecting shareware fees for us. 
However, Kagi is NOT offering any kind of customer support. All 
comments, suggestions and problems concerning registration codes should 
directly go to Fast Eddie Labs. In order to get the quickest possible 
answer, you should _always_ send your e-mails to _both_ authors, namely 
gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch and andre.horstmann@unifr.ch .
 

  Q: What's the difference between the unregistered and the registered
     version?
  A: The only difference is the 15 minutes limit. After working with
     Eddie for 15 minutes, the program displays a message and quits.

  Q: How do I register?
  A: The Fast Eddie archive includes a Register application. Please
     fill in the boxes, choose a method of payment and forward this
     form to Kagi Shareware. How to contact Kagi is explained in the
     Fast Eddie Read Me.
     IMPORTANT: when starting up, Fast Eddie displays a serial code.
     You should send this code along with a text copy of your order
     to gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch _and_ andre.horstmann@unifr.ch . As
     soon as we receive a confirmation from Kagi, we will forward
     you your registration code per e-mail. Please keep this code in
     a safe place.

  Q: This is confusing. What exactly do I have to do to register?
  A: - start Eddie and write down the serial code in the shareware
       notice
     - quit Eddie
     - start the Register application
     - fill in the order form
     - save the order as a text file or in the clipboard
     - forward the order form to Kagi as explained in the Read Me.
       Keep in mind that some methods of payment can only be sent
       via snail mail and not e-mail or fax, or vice versa. The Read
       Me will tell you.
     - Upon sending Kagi the order form, send an email to
       gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch _and_ andre.horstmann@unifr.ch with
       a) a text copy of the order you sent to Kagi
       b) your SERIAL CODE
       c) your complete snail mail and e-mail address

  Q: Funny, I registered Fast Eddie but it reverts to the
     unregistered version.
  A: Please forward your old registration code and the serial
     number printed in the shareware notice to gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch
     _and_ andre.horstmann@unifr.ch . We will check the code and, if
     necessary, send you a new one for free.
     Please do not contact Kagi Shareware if you encounter problems
     with registration unless you have questions regarding your
     payment.

  Q: Is this fee valid for all upcoming versions of Fast Eddie?
  A: Yes.

  Q: Why should I pay a shareware fee for a *beta*?
  A: This is a good point. We believe that the current release provides
     enough functionality in order to use it as a game console or
     productivity tool.

  Q: Do you have special pricing for schools?
  A: Yes, e-mail for details


2. Support

  Q: Are you actually interested in any kind of feedback?
  A: YES!

  Q: Could you send me a ROM image?
  A: Sorry, no. We are not allowed to distribute ROM images.

  Q: I sent you an e-mail, but got no response. You guys suck!
  A: I don;t know how much e-mails we will get, but it is probable that
     we will get more mails than we can handle.

  Q: So, I don't own a Apple IIgs and can't make a ROM dump.
  A: You are only allowed to use ROM dumps with Fast Eddie if you
     also own a "physical", non-virtual Apple IIgs.

  Q: I have a few suggestions regarding improvements. What are the
     chances that you put my suggestions on your to-do list?
  A: 99%

  Q: Do you offer on-line support?
  A: Yes and no. We expect you to read the enclosed documentation, but
     if you still have questions feel free to contact us. We are also
     monitoring comp.sys.apple2 and comp.emulators.apple2.

  Q: comp.sys.apple2? I heard this newsgroup is an alias of alt.flame.
  A: Hmm, that's correct. And we make use of FlameStation, although
     only on Eddie-users with unregistered versions. :-D


3. Other issues

  Q: What do I need in order to run Fast Eddie?
  A: You need a Power Mac (any), 640x480 display with 256 colors,
     a ROM image (ROM 1 or 3), and Apple IIgs software.

  Q: This thing is dog-slow.
  A: Then your Mac is dog-slow. :)
     Seriously, Fast Eddie is running at 3Mhz and above with pure C 
code
     that is not optimized by the compiler. I don't think this is slow.

  Q: I don't understand. Why is it not optimized?
  A: Because the compiler goes belly up while optimizing the CPU
     emulation.

  Q: My old 601/66Mhz PowerPC is emulating faster than my supercool
     portable 603e/100 Mhz. What the hell are you doing?
  A: Some 603e systems do not have level 2 cache that greatly speeds up
     Fast Eddie. Also, 603e systems are often built on low-performance
     mamaboards. Lastly, Fast Eddie has been compiled specifically for
     601 PowerPC chips.

  Q: And when can I expect a faster version?
  A: Soon. We will add hand-crafted assembly code soon.

  Q: Hey, and what about IWM emulation?
  A: IWM emulation *is* actually mostly done (and even part of this
     beta!), but two things are missing so we have disabled it. Coming
     soon.

  Q: Iiik, and 1-bit sound, 5.25" disks and serial ports?
  A: How embarassing. It's in the pipeline, promised.

  Q: Why did you write Fast Eddie?
  A: Our GS monitors turned very fuzzy recently, making it hard to read
     Merlin-16 code.
