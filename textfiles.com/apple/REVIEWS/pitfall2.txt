
PITFALL II (Arcade)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, joystick, Mockingboard optional


     Lost somewhere in the Great Caverns are Harry's niece Rhonda, his cat Quickclaw, and the incerdibly valuable Raj diamond. Not one to let your comrades down, you (as Harry) immediately set off to the rescue.

     The caverns is a very big place filled with snakes, bats, scorpions, and other dangerous creatures, along with bars of gold. Less frquent are the white crosses marking "Incan Healing Centers". Should Harry be zapped by some hazard, he is magically transported back to the last white cross touched. Though getting lost appears to be the main danger, Harry will occassionally need to leap a gap, swim a river, or catch a balloon to continue the quest.

     While too many arcades emphasize competition at the expense of playability; "Pitfall II" comes near to the other extreme. Nobody dies in the caverns, there is no time limit, and the Mockingboard generated background music is actually relaxing. Every achievement (rescues, gold, etc.) and setback (getting zapped) adds or subtracts points from your score; but high scores are not saved.

    "Pitfall II's" graphics are a tad bland; but control is good and it is fun to explore the caverns. A masterpiece of low pressure arcading, this is one game you can play 'til the cows come home.
