Shadowkeep (Maze Adventure)
Compatible: 64k Apple II+, //e, //c
Requirements: One disk drive; SpeedDemon recommended

     Since its seizure by a mighty demon, the Shadowkeep has been the focus of evil-- a power which now threatens to engulf the earth. As the last, best hope of civilization, you with your eight comrades must invade the grim tower, overcome its guardians, and dispatch the dark lord.

     Featuring animated color graphics with good perspective effects, "Shadowkeep" is a long-play adventure in the mold of "Dungeons & Dragons" and "Wizardry". Many commands such as "get gold" or "Rubywand, invoke the Rod of Power" are in simple English; with purchases, combat, etc. handled via prompt windows. As in "D&D", your quest leads through successively greater perils, necessitating an on-going concern for character growth and the acquisition of magical artifacts.

     Each of the keep's nine 16x16 mazes offers its own special rewards including weapons, spell scrolls, and passwords to other mazes. Adversaries run the gamut from "death sheep", trolls, and gargoyles through ghosts and ogres. Like the members of your party, monsters vary widely in such attributes as strength, dexterity, and the ability to use magic.

     Though slow and not altogether free of minor bugs, "Shadowkeep" ranks high among my favorites. Handsome displays, unusual scope for character development, and diversity of challenges make this one good for many hours of maze busting, monster bashing entertainment.
