
ALCAZAR: THE LOST FORTRESS (Maze Adventure)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, joystick


     Your quest for wealth and power at last brings you to a strange landscape dotted with brooding castles long abandoned to wild beasts. If the legends speak truth, mere leagues to the east is your goal, ancient Alcazar with its fabled throne, crown, and untold riches.

     Whichever of several routes you choose, two or more castles must be overcome. Each, including Alcazar itself, is a multi-level maze of chambers, pitfalls, and hidden shafts patrolled by tigers, giant spiders, and even less savory magical creatures.

     Your main weapon is a revolver with only six shots; but more specialized, fresh revolvers, and other items crucial to success are sprinkled about the mazes. Some, such as rope to repair bridges, a raft to cross a lake, and magic carpets let you circumvent entire castles. Play need last only an hour; so, there is no game save option. However, random distribution of major items guarantees that each game is different.

     An informative display and nicely graduated pacing place the emphasis squarely on decision-making, though arcade skills get a fair workout as well. Good use of sound rounds out an attractive adventuring package good for many replays.
