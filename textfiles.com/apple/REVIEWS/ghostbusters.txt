
GHOSTBUSTERS (Arcade)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, KB and joystick input


     A burdgeoning ghost population has finally gotten out of hand, posing a serious threat to the quality of urban living. You can just sit around like everyone else (and wind up living in a slime bowl); OR you can open your own ghostchasing franchise, bust those turkeys, and save the city!

     True to its motion picture origins, "Ghostbusters" delivers all the customers you can handle. The ghosts come rolling in, business thrives, and you can afford better equipment. Ultimately, success leads to the roof of Zuul's temple and victory. Failure can mean a disaster of truly Marshmellow proportions.

     Featuring an attractive scenario and several well-executed action sequences, "Ghostbusters" nonetheless manages to deliver remarkably little real entertainment. Perhaps 60% of play involves unobstructed movement between locations; while ghost trapping is cumbersome and decidedly ho-hum.

     People WATCH movies. They want to PLAY games. "Ghostbusters" is too close a copy of the movie to be an enjoyable game.
