
H.E.R.O. (Arcade)
Compatible: 48K Apple II+, IIe, IIc
Requirements: One disk drive, joystick input


     The trouble with being the ace prop packer of H.E.R.O. (Helecopter Emergency Rescue Operations) is that you only get the really dirty assignments. Now there's been a mine collapse. Deadly critters have swarmed through a newly opened fissure, lava is slopping down some of the shafts; and guess who's supposed to strap on a flying suit and hop in?!

    "H.E.R.O." pits you against an incredibly hazardous hazardous labyrinth and the clock at seventeen levels of difficulty ranging from "very tough" through "insane". Dynamite helps, creating needed shortcut, and a helmet lazer fries obstreperous monsters; but you will need atouch of ESP to get through areas where the lighting has failed. (As for the lava, don't touch it; it's hot!)  Each rescue recharges the power unit, restores some dynamite, and adds points to your score.

     At the lowest (i.e. playable) difficulty levels the game is both tough and a good deal of fun. Failure to save high scores puts a damper on competition; but if you enjoy a solid quick-sticking challenge, "H.E.R.O." is a good bet.
