     In the multi-species galactic civilization of the late 31st century, sports have supplanted warfare as an outlet for agressive instincts. Foremost amon spectator entertainments is "Ballblazer", a one-on-one version of Old Earth soccerplayed in force-shielded hovercraft called "rotofoils".

     The Ballblazer field is a 55x21 curved grid with a pair of moving goal beams at each end. To score you must snatch the 1000 kg. "plasmorb" (i.e. the ball) in the rotofoil's capture field, meneuver around your opponent (who will try to rip the ball away), and fire it between your goal beams. Each score shrinks the goal; so it's best to try the three point, over-the-horizon shot early.

     Glass smooth movement, responsive controls, and lively sound effects guarentee all the lightning fast action you can handle. Original, alien, and (for many) intimidating; "Ballblazer" is competition for the arcade elite.
