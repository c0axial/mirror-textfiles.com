A DIGITAL KNIGHT PRESENTATION:-
-----------------------------
Before we begin, let me express my feelings to someone who likes to impersonate others and involve them in conflicts with others.
  THE HEAD RAG IN THE PIRACY BUSINESS
  -----------------------------------
     Name:  STEVE ESTEP
     Alias: THE WIZARD  (maybe even you!)
     Addr:  53 Collins rd
            Henderson, NV
     Phone: {702} 565-3598
PLEASE GIVE THIS RAG A FEW CALLS AND TELL HIM WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM IMPERSONATING OTHERS.  WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, WHY NOT SEND HIM A BOX FULL`OF DOG FECES?!  WELL, ENOUGH OF THAT.  ONWARD TO THE DOCS!
{202 MOD WRITTEN BY THE DIGITAL KNIGHT}
 -------------------------------------     
     
     Well, the simplest 202 mod is finally here.  Nothing fancy, just the following three features:
     1)  202 baudrate (of course)
     2)  a clock (00:00:00)
     3)  chat mode + status light
INFO ON THE 202 FILE:-
--------------------
     The file resides in memory from $7900.  A CALL 30976 will activate the input file and await carrier.  Locations $300-307 hold flag for the input file so don't alter them in anyway or unpredictable results will occur. If you need the file Relocated to another location other than at $7900, I will personally make relocation for you (if I'm not too busy).  Leave E-Mail to either DR.HEX or KRAKERJACK on various cat-fur boards and they will make sure I get it.
A WORD ABOUT THE CLOCK:-
----------------------
     The clock cannot be active when your bbs is waiting for a ring.  Upon a ring, make a call to this input file by doing a CALL 30976 and it will wait for a carrier.  Once the carrier is detected, do a CALL 30985 to enable the clock if you so desire.  You can also manipulate the clock settings by poking the following locations:
          
            seconds:  poke 32221,xx
            minutes:  poke 32222,xx
            hours  :  poke 32223,xx
            year   :  poke 32224,xx
            day    :  poke 32225,xx
            month  :  poke 32226,xx
    where xx = desired setting.
(*)         **** IMPORTANT ****
     Since the clock is based on an IRQ you MUST disable it before the user enters catfur!  Do the following:
 3000   poke 31894,96: call 31893: poke 2047,187: print chr$(4)"brun cat-fur"
USING THE 202 MOD:-
-----------------
     After connection,  you MUST do a POKE 770,1 to activate the 202 mode.  After the poke, everything will be printed out at 202.
     When taking input from the remote user, you should turn OFF the 202 mode by doing a CALL 30982.  Then, immediately after you have taken his input, turn ON the 202 by doing a CALL 30979.  (NOTE: You must do these steps everytime you take input for the mod to work.  As you can see, you will need to route all your input to either one of 2 subroutines (a 'get' and an 'input' subroutine) if you have not done so yet.)  To make myself clear, here are the sample subroutines:-
 400  call off202:get a$:call on202:return
 500  call off202: input a$: call on202: return
(So long as you turn 202 off, get the input and turn 202 back on again, you will not have any problems.)
THE CHAT OPTION:-
---------------
     Chat mode is toggled by a CTRL-T.
