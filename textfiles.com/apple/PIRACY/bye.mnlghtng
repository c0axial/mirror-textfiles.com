        Yes, unfortunately, this is no joke.  I guess all good things have to
come to an end, and since I will be going off to college this fall, that means
that Moonlighting will be moving out too.  Instead of trying to keep the board
holding on through the summer, I have decided that it would be in everyone's
best interest to take the system down once and for all, as soon as possible.

        I wanted to wait until after Applefest to take down the board because I
wanted to have the chance to tell my good friends and users in person.  I
wanted to make sure that everyone understood what is going on.

        Running Moonlighting has been wonderful, and I know I will miss it
desperately, but I realize that taking down the board is inevitable.  You all
have been terrific, because if it wasn't for you guys (and girls) Moonlighting
would have never become a reality for any of us.

        The board will go down for good on Friday, May 12 at 11:59 PM <I'll be
up>.  Thank you all once again.  Please keep in touch.

First the show and now the Board. This is too much to take.

Maddie....Do you have anyone in mind to take over from you? I know when I asked
about you takeing the board down before you said that a number of people had
expressed an interest in taking over from you when you went to school.

        If this keeps up we might as well has a funeral service for this BBS
after it goes down... suppose we put one together on a Tele-conferencing number
in the near future... I think I could contact the people fo=huhe information.

        I really appreciate hearing all of this, and believe me, it breaks my
heart to take it down.  There's nothing I can really do now, though...  I would
hate to see the board die over the summer, and I'd much rather see it go now,
happily, than in pieces at the end of the summer.  You all are just the
greatest, and I'll miss you terribly..

somewhere....remember hansel?  diskmaster....thats where I got that habbit.
heh..also.  can't call you on all the conferences we have because your parents
get mad when alliance snoops

If you're ever up by here, you'd better come by.  You have my voice number,
I'll give you my new phone number for my line when I get it, so you'll have no
excuse.

yup.  i'll be in touch easily.  you should call around a bit again.

This summer I'll definetely be calling around to a few places... I wouldn't be
able to just forget about everything.  My birthday is Thursday, y'know... Alan,
do you realize that when you hang up, Moonlighting will be gone forever?

its kinda sad.  things that have lasted so long shouldn't have to go
away...but as we know, all good things must come to an end.  and that end is
near.  i'm happy to be the last caller though...priveledged also.  this board
has seen so much for so long.

And I'm happy to see it end this way.  SO, I guess I'll be seeing you, Alan my
friend...

heh.  yup.  well, this is goodbye.  bye to moonlighting, a great board in
modUm history{  as the history's continue and the modemers cycle, everyone will
remember this board as one of the milestones....thanks for a great board and a
great time,  i'm sure I speak for all the users that have passed through here.
bye cj,  be good

"classic last words"  Take care, Alan, thanks so much... g'night, and I'll talk
to you later...

'You want to Leave us?' Ms. Dipesto gasps in horror.

'Are you sure <Y/[N]>' Y

Ms. Dipesto waves to you and says, 'Thank you for calling the Blue Moon
                             Detective Agency!'

Maddie smiles...'Goodbye, Blue Adept.'

<:notes:>

Moonlighting was one of the great boards throughout the 1987-1988 modeming years with its diverse userbase.  The sysop, Maddie Hayes or CJ (her real name), was one of the great female users of that time.  CJ was well liked and constantly on the top uploaders list of the major transfer boards around the nation....phreaking from allnet.  The loss of Moonlighting is a milestone in bbs history as the end of yet another era of piracy.  Most of the users of that era are gone now and an entirely new group of pirates has arrived to play out the saga.  New boards are now hotspots and Moonlighting has faded into the electronic sunset of modeming.  Moonlighting will be severly missed as will be Maddie Hayes.
