     Greetings.  A lot of work went into this file.  I spent many long nights
tracking down these little gems that to this day still leave me smiling.
They are the last undiscovered relic of the Apple pirate world.  They remain
hidden on your disks, unknown, unrealized, waiting to be discovered, perhaps
finally now, perhaps never.  Never to be known by anyone except for the
person who planted it in the first place.  Call me weird, but there's a
certain mystique about them.  Its like finding an old coin buried in your
back yard:  it was there, waiting to be dug up,  and you didn't even realize
it.  Or finding that last easter egg (hence the name) on that certain Sunday
when you were but a little guy.  I am speaking of what I prefer to call
"secret keys".  I always got off on finding the things.  To think that years
ago, someone, somewhere, added something a little special to their work for
someone to find later is, well, real neat.

     This file is older than promises of an upgrade for the //gs...literally
(by the way, those of you still holding out hope, give it up).  I finally
felt it was time to put aside my perfectionist tendencies and put it out with
some incomplete or un-researched entries.  I used to tirelessly pursue every
lead I could in order to track down secret keys and the like; calling
different pirate friends around the country and asking them about ones I had
heard rumors of; searching disks sector by sector looking for funny or
interesting messages; boot tracing nearly every single one of my cracked
games to see if the title page routine included some check for a special
keypress.  I put a lot of time and effort into this file, and hope that the
few people who will take the time to read it will possibly gain some
enjoyment from checking out these gems for themselves.  This file was started
almost two years ago (I can't believe it myself).  If you're like me, you
still have most of these games or programs stuffed away in disk cases that
you rarely dig into anymore (mine make great dust collectors).  Now you have
a chance to re-live some of those fond memories of playing cool Apple games
well into the wee hours.  Perhaps not, but give it a whirl anyway, you might
enjoy some of the things you discover for the first time.

     A lot of these games are ancient (some a decade old!) and you probably
don't and won't ever have them.  I do have most of them (except for the GS
stuff...I don't have a GS and probably never will unless I can get one for
under $100...any offers?)  Of course, some of the more obscure hardware
easter eggs will be a challenge for those of you who will attempt to
experience every single secret key documented in this file.  As if anyone is
actually going to try, but if you are, try going to your school or some place
where they have old outdated Apple's.  You may even find some of the older
games still making the rounds in programming class when the twits should be
coding rather than playing Mario Bros.

     I had hoped to make this guide as complete and up-to-date as possible,
but considering its been aeons since I last touched it, I felt I may as well
release it now or never release it at all.  I don't know what kind of
audience this file will receive, but I hope the few people who do take the
time to get it are pleased with the effort I took to present them with these
gems and hope they enjoy them as much as I do.

     The Apple Pirate world was a killer playground for me: all the different
BBS' and the interesting types I met in different corners of the country.
The dead and lonely back-alley wares boards and the thriving elyte message
systems.  There will never be another community, another sub-society like it.
The 80's were a decade of advancement for all computers, but Apples and Apple
users led the way.  Apple users were the innovators, the originators.  The
pirate code of honor (and dishonor) that spawned from the Apple world, all
the words (K-K00L!), customs (crack screens and rag pages) found their way
into many different areas of the computer world as a whole.  Atari and
Commodore 64 groups hoped to only come close to the rich Apple pirate
traditions.  Oh, the bustling commerce of wares being traded between
different warehouse Meccas of pirated games!  But of course, all empires must
fall, or be absorbed into a greater whole.

     Near the end, other computers' pirating customs began spilling back
into the Apple realm, and it was completely lame.  But by then, the Apple
world was pretty much extinct anyway, only being carried on by those die-hard
romantics hoping to effect some sort of revival.  Now the Apple modem world
is but a ghost of what it once was.  Lonely, desolate, Apple BBS' are few and
far between.  I sometimes call out, now only to one and sometimes two Apple
BBS'.  The Apple may be dead, but then, so are a lot of other computers.  The
90s are here, man.  Things are changing real fast.  Apple and IBM working
together?  MicroSoft and IBM, splitsville?  Its so diverse out there now.
Don't hold back.  Use your Apple experience as a stepping stone onto other
platforms.  There's so much out there to try...

     Well, I got carried away, but since this is in all likelihood my last
major Apple world contribution, what the fuck.


                             :Acknowledgements:

Thanks to Hot Rod (where ever the hell he is these days) for publishing the
first secret key files and turning me on to this entertaining pastime and
for finding all the secret keys he did.  Also, thanks go to Apple Core for
the secret keys he found and published in his "Secret Game Keys" file.
Finally, thanks to the many people that informed me of new ones I hadn't
known about.  This file basically compiles all previously published secret
keys plus the few ones I have located into this one source guide.


These are the different types of "Easter Eggs" you will find listed in this
file:

1) Secret Key (a single keypress that results in some action, such as a
   message being displayed)
2) Password (a series of keypresses that result in some action)
3) Hidden message (a message embedded somewhere in a program or somewhere on
   a disk)
4) Game cheat (a sequence of keypresses that leads to some sort of game
   cheat)

I have even included some hardware Easter Eggs!  These are ones found in
certain pieces of Apple hardware that I have deemed significant.

An entry that has "(unverified)" next to the name of the ware indicates that
I have not been able to verify that entry, but am including it for you to
explore.  No claim is made as to the actual existence of an easter egg for
that particular entry.

Enjoy!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Pirate's Signature

A) Press [ESC] at the main menu for a hidden page
B) Press [CTRL-C] at the hidden page to enter the monitor

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Airheart (Evil Sock's 16 sector crack; unverified)

A) Use a sector editor to view a message embedded on Track $00, Sector $2
B) Boot a DOS 3.3, insert your Airheart disk in the drive and then enter the
   following:

     CALL -151
     300: A9 00 8D EB B7 8D F0 B7 A9 21 8D EC B7 A9 0A 8D
     310: ED B7 A9 04 8D F1 B7 A9 01 8D F4 B7 20 E3 03 20
     320: D9 03 CE ED B7 EE F1 B7 AD F1 B7 C9 08 D0 ED 2C
     330: 00 C0 10 FB 2C 10 C0 A9 04 8D F1 B7 AD ED B7 C9
     340: 02 D0 D9 60
     300G

   This enters the monitor and creates a short program which loads some
   sectors off of the Airheart disk which contains a message from The Evil
   Sock.  I assume there is (or was) a way to load this message using a
   secret key but I was unable to figure it out.

(I tried contacting The Evil Sock to find out just how to access these
messages from a secret key.  No go.  I tore the game apart and looked for the
possible secret keys myself.  What I found instead were his routines to crash
the game if his text crack pages were changed in any way.  Neat, but no
secret keys to be found.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             30 PRINT A$

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   you pressed
C) While in the monitor, enter a '#', and whenever you access the control
   panel, you will have two new options, "Memory Peeker" and "Visit Monitor"
   "Visit Monitor" allows you to do just that, and "Memory Peeker" lets you
   look at the stack and whatever memory location you desire.

(Total entries: 138)


     Note about Bunnymen cracks:  Any ware released by the Bunnymen that I
know has a secret key always has a small, almost unnoticeable key drawn in
the upper-righthand corner of their crack pages.

     The following are file games which contain messages embedded within
them that I didn't feel merited a specific entry.  Use a file view utility to
find the messages (usually just short, inconsequential but vaguely
interesting words or phrases).

Alien Munchies
Asteron
One on One
Pacman
Space Quarks
Space Warrior
Star League Baseball


     The following games were previously noted by others to contain easter
eggs which I could definitely not verify.  Some I stripped apart without
finding the purported easter egg and some I could simply not verify at all.
You may want to venture ahead and do a little snooping yourself.  A note is
given next to each ware as to the nature of the supposed easter egg.

Acey Deucy - There is supposedly a way to make the dice roll whatever you
             want them to

Talon - Pressing [ESC] and the [CTRL-W] during game play is supposed to give
        you an extra mount


     Lastly, a blatant rip-off from Hot Rod's Secret Key file:

          Beagle Bros. - On one of their disks there is this 42 sector
          title page program by Alan Bird.  I can't remember which one
          it is though.  Maybe Fat Cat or something.  Anyway, during
          the title page routine, ctrl-B will display a message from
          them.

     The disk was D-Code.  The program was D.BUG.DEMO.  I didn't find it.


     And now, a listing of all the secret keys I ever included in my own
cracks:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dark Heart of Uukrul

A) Press '0' at the crack screen for a message alluding to the fact that The
   OverByte, during our infamous country-wide rag war, said Dark Heart of
   Uukrul would never be cracked (he denied using the word "never", which has
   long since been proven, but hey, it was funny anyway)
B) Use a sector editor to view a message embedded on Track $00, Sector $4

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pick 'N' Pile

Press [CTRL-R] during the crack screen for a secret window

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Renegade

Boot the back side to view the crack page and then type "GRAFFITTI" for a
secret rag page

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Finally, use a file view utility to view anyone of my numerous patch
programs (ahem) and other miscellaneous utilities for embedded messages.  I
stuck a whole bunch of them in there.


                       -[*]- That's all, folks. -[*]-


Special Thanks go to: The Over Byte, Mr. Atoz, Hot Rod, Rotten Apple
