Topic:   Apple II Programming Environments
Special Guest:  Tim Swihart
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet)

AFL Dyfet  Good evening and welcome to the Tuesday night Apple
AFL Dyfet  Development Forum Chat.  Tonight's topic is Apple II Development
	   Environments,
AFL Dyfet  and Tim Swihart is hear as our informal guest on this topic.  Tim
	   is
Dave Lyons (I think Matt's asleep...not sure.)
DaviesDoug (WAKE UP MATT!!!!)
AFL Dyfet  the Product Manager for APW over at Apple.    We will be using
	   PROTOCOL
AFL Dyfet  *WHIP* here tonight, starting now.  This means that if you wish to
	   ask
AFL Dyfet  a question, you must enter a '?' on a line by itself.  If you wish
	   to make
AFL Dyfet  a comment, you must enter a '!' on a line by itself.  I will call
	   you each
AFL Dyfet  in turn to speak.  First, as some of you know, we will be giving
	   away some
AFL Dyfet  connect time at the end of this chat (or around 10:00pm, whichever
	   comes
ShrinkIt   ?
GMorrison  ?
AFL Dyfet  first) to some lucky participant out there chosen at random. 
	   Before we
AFA Parik  (Hi Willie)
AFA Gary J Q = Andy, Gary M
AFL Dyfet  start with questions, I will give the floor over to Tim in case he
	   wishes to
AFL Dyfet  make some introductory statement.  GA Tim :)
A2Pro Tim  gee, my very own floor...  :-)
A2Pro Tim  I'm Tim Swihart, and as Dave already pointed out, I work for Apple
	   as the
A2Pro Tim  Product Manager for APW and MPW IIGS (our cross-developement
	   suite).
A2Pro Tim  I've had this job for just over six months and it's been a VERY
	   fast six months
A2Pro Tim  (to say the least).
A2Pro Tim  But enough about me, let's get to the REAL reason you're all
	   here....
A2Pro Tim  Dev tools for the Apple II.
A2Pro Tim  Take it away, Dave.
AFL Dyfet  (not free connect time :)
AFA Gary J :)
A2Pro Tim  :-)
AFL Dyfet  Well, our first question is from ShrinkIt.  GA Andy.
ShrinkIt   Tim, Can you give us an description on what's being done to the
	   current APW to
AFA Gary J Q = ShrinkIt, GMorrison
ShrinkIt   enhance it's performance?
ShrinkIt   GA
A2Pro Tim  Not yet....
AFA Parik  ?
ShrinkIt   Ok, next...
A2Pro Tim  We're not quite ready to start telling the public what exactly
	   we're putting
A2Pro Tim  into the new version.
ShrinkIt   Then, there *IS* a new version?
A2Pro Tim  Readers of my APDAlog article in the Spring (or was it Winter?)
	   already
A2Pro Tim  know that we're revising that product....  GA
ShrinkIt   :) GA
ShrinkIt   (Winter..)
AFL Dyfet  I believe our next question is from GMorisson.  GA GM.
AFA Gary J Q = GMorrison, Parik
GMorrison  Ok...
GMorrison  I've seen a lot lately on the Mac moving to OOOps and today I saw
	   an
GMorrison  announcemtn that the New Turbo Pascal (whatever) will have
	   ooops...
GMorrison  Is there any chance it will "invade the GS environment? ga 
AFL Dyfet  Anyone have comments on this?
A2Pro Tim  Hmmm, that's partially up to us and partially up to folks like
	   Mike W. and TML
A2Pro Tim  Mike and Tom both sell lots of Pascal (the primary OOPS platform
	   seems to be
GMorrison  Is there a "push" from Apple?
A2Pro Tim  Pascal these days)
AFA Parik  (ooops?  sounds like a mistake... "I program in OOPS!  I mean
	   OOPS!  What I..")
A2Pro Tim  Apple has a very strong backing for OOPS - I'm not sure how that
	   applies to
GMorrison  object oriented programming I think
A2Pro Tim  the GS "today".
A2Pro Tim  (yes, OOPS = Object Oriented Programming)
GMorrison  Ok, thanks.  Ga
AFL Dyfet  I know Oops tools are pushed in Macintosh Development :)...perhaps
	   this will
A2Pro Tim  Our recently released MPW IIGS Pascal compiler is a port of the
	   MPW Pascal...
AFA Gary J Q = GMorrison, Parik
AFL Dyfet  change in the future of GS development as well.  I believe our
	   next question
A2Pro Tim  We currently don't support OOPS in the MPW IIGS version, but it is
	   in the MPW
A2Pro Tim  once.
AFL Dyfet  is from Parik.  GA Parik.
A2Pro Tim  (finished)
AFA Parik  Do you have any comments on any upcoming products at AppleFest,
	   such as any
A2Pro Tim  er, "once = one"
AFA Parik  new interface files to possibly a new system disk?  ;)  ga
A2Pro Tim  ok, everybody sing in harmony....
AFA Parik  shucks
AFL Marty  ?
A2Pro Tim  :-)
AFA Parik  (was hoping you're drunk :)
A2Pro Tim  Never drink and type...
A2Pro Tim  you might short out a keyboard.
AFL Dyfet  I guess that would be a good post-applefest question :).  I
	   believe we now
AFL Marty  (use a straw :)
AFA Gary J Q = Marty
Dan Burton ?
AFL Dyfet  have a question from Marty.  GA Marty.
AFL Marty  Can you shed any light on the nature of the bug(s) in...
AFA Gary J Q = Marty, Dan
AFL Marty  the SCSI driver which Glen Bredon recently wrote a patch for?
AFL Marty  GA
AFA Parik  ?
A2Pro Tim  I've downloaded Glen's patch, but haven't had time to talk with
	   the s/w gang
A2Pro Tim  about it.  We've tried to get Glen to report it (and send us what
	   it takes to
A2Pro Tim  duplicate it), but haven't had much luck yet.  This one won't be
	   easy....
A2Pro Tim  GA
AFL Dyfet  Perhaps our DTS people might wish to comment on this...I haven't
	   been able
AFL Marty  (Done)
AFL Dyfet  to get much out of Glenn about it either :).
Chaos 89   ?
AFA Gary J Q = Dan, Parik, Chaos
KEVIN95    ?
AFL Dyfet  Okay...our next question is from Dan.  GA Dan.
Dan Burton The assembler hangs on me occationaly. To prevent this I changed
	   it so that it
Dan Burton reloads the assembler every time. Is this being fixed? ...
AFA Gary J Q = Dan, Parik, Chaos, Kevin
Dan Burton  also it seems that the linker causes programs that are run
A2Pro Tim  My assembler is restartable.  Have you reported this as a bug?
Dan Burton after a link to crash. Any info?
A2Pro Tim  Also, have you double-checked that nothing else is walking all
	   over your
A2Pro Tim  memory?
AE PhilM   !
A2Pro Tim  GA Phil...  
Dan Burton All I'm doing is assembleing several segments in a row.
AFL Dyfet  GA Phil
A2Pro Tim  (he wrote part of the product....)  :-)
AE PhilM   The Linker and Assembler and Editor all are restartable and have
	   checksum rou
AE PhilM   tines to prevent indicate if memory stomped on them
AFA Gary J Q = Dan (AE PhilM), Parik, Chaos, Kevin
AE PhilM   Doesn't sound like memory problem to me.
Dan Burton I have 4 meg in my machine and no DAs are running just strait
	   assembles
A2Pro Tim  How much RAM do you have (total) & how many desk accessories?
A2Pro Tim  (never mind...)  :-)
AFL Dyfet  I've not had any similar problems myself.  Don;t know what to
	   suggest...
DaviesDoug !
AFA Parik  !
AFL Dyfet  GA Davies...
AE PhilM   Dan - are you using APW or Orca? Which version?
DaviesDoug I've had ORCA/APW crash quite often as dan has
AFA Gary J Q = Dan (Doug, Parik), Parik, Chaos, Kevin
DaviesDoug we use orca phil
AE PhilM   The latest version of Orca has some problems--Contact Mike at
	   BW.
Dan Burton I am assembleing a LARGE program and setting Assembler to not
	   restart fixes the
Dan Burton problem
DaviesDoug mike doesn't like us anymore
DaviesDoug here at wordperfect
AFL Dyfet  :)
DaviesDoug never talks to us
AFA Gary J :X
AE PhilM   I encounterd simular problems and got a working version from
	   them.
DaviesDoug phil, dan is my boss, he works here to
DaviesDoug yah but mikes your bud
DaviesDoug .done.
AFA Gary J Q = Dan (Parik), Parik, Chaos, Kevin
AE PhilM   What can I say :) (done)
A2Pro Tim  There is a v1.1b of the ORCA shell that fixes some hangs...
Dan Burton .done.
A2Pro Tim  (done)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, next comment is from Parik...
AFA Parik  I've had the same problems, I asml a program, find bug, re-asml
	   only ONE part 
AFA Parik  of the program (uses NAMES=(____)) options and it crashes.  Got
	   fix from Mike
Dan Burton !
AFA Parik  and works well.  Question:  How does one debug a program using APW
	   Debugger
AFA Parik  if it uses the text output, WITHOUT i/o redirection (for screen
	   positioning) ga
Dan Burton Sounds like same problem I guess we need to get the next
	   version.
AFL Dyfet  You snuck a question in there, Parik :).  GA Dan, or was that your
	   comment?
Dan Burton I'm done
AFA Gary J Q = Parik, Chaos, Kevin
AFA Parik  :P I was next in queue
DaviesDoug !
A2Pro Tim  Parik - I haven't used the "APW debugger" for some time now....
A2Pro Tim  Instead, I've been using its replacement...  :-)
AFL Dyfet  Strangly enough the next question was from Parik anyway :)  GA
	   Doug.
DaviesDoug don't ya just type OFF to see the text screen?!
AFA Parik  I haven't.  :)
A2Pro Tim  (have you tried DaviesDoug's idea?)  :-)
AFA Parik  No, heh, guess I will.  :)  ga
DaviesDoug whats the replacement? and it's doug davies
AFL Marty  *simple.. just write perfect code :)
A2Pro Tim  (sorry 'bout that Doug - _I_ didn't type your screen name
	   backwards...  :-)
AFA Gary J Q = Parik, Chaos, Kevin
AFL Dyfet  I believe we (still?) are on Parik's question :)
AFA Parik  !@#$%^&*()done)(**&^%$#@!
DaviesDoug what's the replacement for the debugger tim?
AFA Parik  (although I see someone discussing UN-ANNOUNCED PRODUCTS!! hmm. 
	   shame!  :)
A2Pro Tim  (aren't we on Chaos's question?)  :-)
AFL Dyfet  NiftyList? :)  I believe our next question is from Chaos.  GA
	   Chaos.  (you are
AFL Dyfet  right Tim!) :)
AFA Gary J Q = Chaos, Kevin
Chaos 89   Do you know of any good references on file management or database
	   programing
Coach101   Tricky move Tim :)
Chaos 89   for the IIGS and GSOS?
A2Pro Tim  no, 'fraid not...
A2Pro Tim  The last database book I had was on how to write database routines
	   in 
A2Pro Tim  IBM (ugh) basic (years ago...)
Chaos 89   I'm looking for one in 65816 for starters.
AFL Dyfet  A reminder...we will be picking the lucky winner in about 20-25
	   mins :).
DaviesDoug (we already did, tim :) , thanks)
AFL Dyfet  Anyone else have a favorite book to recommend?
AFA Parik  !
A2Pro Tim  (is Doug still in the queue somewhere about the replacement for
	   APW Debugger?)
Coach101   !
A2Pro Tim  (he asks gracefully)
AFL Dyfet  GA Parik.
AFA Parik  Check through OLD AppleSoft books.  Many of them did contain
	   Database programs
AFA Gary J Q = Chaos (Parik), Kevin
AFA Parik  so you can fool around with that (one I remember is with a Apple
	   across a 
AFA Parik  rainbow and it looks really pretty, 1982 or so :)
AFA Parik  ga
AFA Gary J Q = Chaos (Coach), Kevin
AFL Dyfet  Okay...GA Coach.
Coach101   Chaos, I would concentrate on finding a good book on data
	   structures
Coach101   and then apply the algorithms to whatever language you are using
Coach101   on the II-GS.  As far as algorithms go, the series from Knuth is
	   hard
Coach101   to beat (and understand at times).   Personally, I learned what
	   I
Coach101   know by reading the code of existing systems....  Then I know it
Coach101   works in both theory and practice!! ga
Chaos 89   Thanks.  (done)
AFA Gary J Q = Chaos, Kevin, Doug
AFL Dyfet  I've read about your file manager, coach...hope to be seeing that
	   goodie
AFL Dyfet  soon :).  I believe the next question is from Kevin (meant record
	   manager),
DaviesDoug (I didn't ask a question)
AFL Dyfet  GA Kevin.
KEVIN95    Is it possible to write a program to play multitrack music on the
	   IIe?
AFL Dyfet  Yes you did, Doug :)...
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Dyfet  Any comments on this?
A2Pro Tim  I've never tried to write multitrack music - you're outta my area
	   of knowledge
A2Pro Tim  on that one.  SORRY!  :-(
DaviesDoug (oh yea, I remember now!)
AFA Gary J heheh
AFL Dyfet  I haven't had any experiance in that area either, Kevin.   I
	   believe our next
AE PhilM   !
AFL Dyfet  comment is from Phil.  GA Phil.
AFA Gary J Q = Kevin (Phil), Doug
AE PhilM   Are you talking about MIDI?? Phasor/Mockinboard sound?? or just
	   the II
AE PhilM   GA
KEVIN95    Either MIDI or just the IIe but not sound digitizing
AE PhilM   Master Tracks Pro for the IIE is a real good program for that. 
	   Not real easy 
AE PhilM   to write though.
AE PhilM   Applied Engineerings Phasor is not bad also.  (done)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, thank you Phil.  Are there any more comments?
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next question is from Doug.  Do you remember
	   it? :)  GA
AFL Dyfet  Doug.
DaviesDoug What replacement for the IIGS Debugger, Tim? (hehehe, as he asks
	   innocently)
A2Pro Tim  :-)
A2Pro Tim  I'm glad you asked....
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Dyfet  :)
AFA Gary J Q = Doug
AE PhilM   :)
Coach101   :)
DaviesDoug :)
A2Pro Tim  It just so happens that I recieved my Spring 1989 APDAlog in the
	   mail yesterday
A2Pro Tim  (did yours come yet?)
AE PhilM   Got the feeling we all know something you dont??
A2Pro Tim  and on page C-12 is this "NEW" blob that really tends to catch the
	   eye of the
Coach101   &*(^&*%*
AFA Gary J (mine didn't)
A2Pro Tim  reader...
A2Pro Tim  Next to it is a headline which reads:  GSBug and Debugging Tools
	   v.4.0B1
DaviesDoug imagine that
A2Pro Tim  This baby is the the "APW Debugger" what GS/OS was to P16 (far,
	   far, far better
AE PhilM   Gee and I thought Apple was giving up the "Closed Lip Policy"
Coach101   ?
A2Pro Tim  (Phil - I dunno - we're not supposed to talk about the Closed Lip
	   Policy)
A2Pro Tim  :-)
DaviesDoug Can't wait to get mine, maybe tommorrow
Bud Gehr   LOL
A2Pro Tim  Doug - does that answer your question?  :-)
AE PhilM   Pssst - OK not a word.
AFL Dyfet  Read my closed lips
DaviesDoug yep....can you tell us anymore about it? :)
AFA Gary J Any details on what it does?
A2Pro Tim  It a new debugger that's geared towards GS/OS....
Coach101   Anything else in this _hypothetical_ spring APDA?
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (Tim), Coach
AFL Dyfet  Yeah, some of us don't have that efficient a post awful...
AFL Dyfet  :)
A2Pro Tim  let's see - the description says things like:
A2Pro Tim  save a trace history to a file on disk...
A2Pro Tim  define and use memory protection windows
DaviesDoug what would be really neat is to be able to go into the debugger at
	   any time....
Chaos 89   !
DaviesDoug and start tracing from there :)
A2Pro Tim  view the debugger's master display (you have to see it to believe
	   it)
A2Pro Tim  Doug - glad you mentioned that...
A2Pro Tim  :-)
AFA Gary J hmmm!
A2Pro Tim  'Cause this one's got that feature...
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (Chaos), Coach
AFL Dyfet  Hmm...reminds me of my VAX debugger :)  GA Chaos...then we'll
	   switch back to
AE PhilM   Sold...I'll take three.
AFL Dyfet  more of this debugger :)
Chaos 89   Is this a Beta version?
A2Pro Tim  you just hit some key sequence (which escapes me at the moment)
	   and poof -
A2Pro Tim  there ya are.....
DaviesDoug data structure template would be nice too
Dave Lyons (Option + Apple-Ctrl-ESC)
A2Pro Tim  Chaos - yes, it's a beta version... V4.0B1
AFA Gary J Does it use the "Nifty List" data file?  :)
A2Pro Tim  (Yeah - what Dave said)
A2Pro Tim  No - only Nifty List does that...  :-)
Dave Lyons Nope, it doesn't know anything about Nifty List, and NL doesn't
	   know about the debugger.
AFA Gary J :)
DaviesDoug will they ever meet? :)
AFA Gary J Q = Doug, Coach
A2Pro Tim  but it does come with SEVERAL desk accessories - most of which are
	   brand new...
AFL Scott  (Vax debugger..)
TBGTender  anyone meet M&M&M&M&M&M&M&M&M&M
TBGTender  ?
A2Pro Tim  There's a revision to the infamous Loader Dumper and Memory
	   Mangler CDA's
Chaos 89   Is there a price?
AFA Gary J Q = Doug, Coach, TBGTender
A2Pro Tim  and there's a new one called "Scrambler"
A2Pro Tim  price = thirty bucks...
DaviesDoug does it handle the (1,S),Y instructions properly now?
A2Pro Tim  Doug - <shrug>  I'm not sure (Dave - do you know?)
Bud Gehr   $30 hummm...thats CHEAP!
A2Pro Tim  There's also a CDA version of the GS/Os exercisor in there...
DaviesDoug scramler....sounds like it moves memory blocks....,
DaviesDoug around or something like that :)
A2Pro Tim  (of course, the standard, "application" version of the GS/OS
	   exercisor is
A2Pro Tim  there as well.
A2Pro Tim  )
Dave Lyons I didn't know about any problems with (1,S),Y in the first place. 
	   Don't know.
Dan Burton Doesn't anyone else besides WordPerfect programmers use (1,s),y?
AFL Dyfet  :)
DaviesDoug we need a [1,S],Y for handles
A2Pro Tim  Doug - yep, Scrambler is just the thing to flush out those handles
	   you 
A2Pro Tim  didn't dereference properly...
A2Pro Tim  If you didn't lock your handles properly, Scrambler will let you
	   know QUICKLY
DaviesDoug hehe
AFA Gary J Q = Doug, Coach
Coach101   Available now????
A2Pro Tim  As the name implies, it "scrambles" memory...
A2Pro Tim  Coach - as soon as you get your Spring APDAlog (mine came
	   yesterday), then
A2Pro Tim  call and find out...
Doctor Why Just what you need to sort cards?  :)
Dave Lyons (It scrambles only parts of memory which could *potentially* be
	   scrambled anyway, not ones that
Dave Lyons you have locked down properly.)
DaviesDoug whew
AFL Dyfet  Okay, do we have any more comments?
AFL Dyfet  Before moving on to Coach's question, it is time to announce the
	   winner of
AFA Parik  mememe!  hehe :)
AFL Dyfet  the extra two hours of connect time....and the winner is (unless
	   proven
A2Pro Tim  Parik - you warming up to start singing???  "mimimimi" ...  :-)
AFL Dyfet  inelligible...)  Dan Burton!   Would you like to step forward now
	   so we can
AFL Dyfet  record that you can claim your prize?
AFL Floyd  <Shucks, I never win anything> :(
AFA Parik  ()()() Dan  falalalala
ShrinkIt   :(
ShrinkIt   hee... :)
Dan Burton dan went home this is doug davies...his co-worker, he said I could
	   have....
Dan Burton it since....
AFA Gary J Yeah Dan!!
Dan Burton he gets free time here anyway
AFA Parik  LOL Dan
Dan Burton cause he does stuff in AWP
AFA Parik  Er, Doug :)
AFL Dyfet  Argh...It seems hard to find someone without a free account around
	   here :)
AE PhilM   LOL
AFA Parik  Gimme $12 bucks instead.  :)
AFA Gary J :)
A2Pro Tim  Yeah, but who one the all-expense paid trip to Walla-walla
	   Washington????  :-)
Dan Burton well?
AFL Dyfet  I'm afraid we will have to move to the next choice on the list
	   then...:)...
Bud Gehr   Andy, what is the latest version of Shrinkit that you have
	   released?
A2Pro Tim  c'mon snake eyes!   Rol them dice...
A2Pro Tim  :-)
ShrinkIt   2.01
A2Pro Tim  er, Roll  (missed an "l" in there)
AFL Dyfet  And the winner is...(looking over list...suspense growing...Chaos
	   89!
Chaos 89   Thanks, I CAN USE IT.
AFL Cheryl what did Chaos win?? :)
Dan Burton boooo!!!
AFL Dyfet  Please step formward Chaos...and hopefully you can use it!
ShrinkIt   (Bud -- 2.01 is current... it's in the a2 telecom processing utils
	   area...)
AFL Cheryl Parik...shame on you!! :)
AFA Parik  Scott started it!  :)
AFL Floyd  It's also in the Utilities Communications Processing Utilities
	   area. ;)
DaviesDoug booo!!!
AFL Floyd  Those two areas are linked. :)
AFL Dyfet  I take it your not an AppleLink employee or anything like that
	   :)
ShrinkIt   (I wuz gonna say that.. 'specially since I'm between jobs... ;)
Chaos 89   No I'm not
Bud Gehr   Thanks Andy!
AFA Gary J Great!
Bud Gehr   Keep up the good work!
AFL Scott  did not!!:)
AFL Dyfet  Cheryl: Chaos just won himself 2 hours of connect time! 
	   Congradulations,
DaviesDoug thanks a lot dan :(
ShrinkIt   (but the whole description of where to find it wouldn't fit on one
	   line..sooo..
AFL Dyfet  Chaos!
AFA Parik  did too  :P   Don't feel bad Doug, just charge a extra 3 hours to
	   Dans account
Chaos 89   Thank you very much.
AppleLink  AFA Parik rolled 0 0-sided dice: 
Coach101   My ? was answered.... 
AFL Dyfet  Now, *CRACK*, returning to PROTOCOL :), I believe our next
	   question is from
AFA Gary J Q = Coach (I think!)
AFL Dyfet  TBG, as Coach's has been answered.
AFA Gary J Ok.
AFA Parik  TBG is gone
ShrinkIt   (we all just _luv_ whips, dave... :)  hee..
AFA Gary J TBG left though.
Brin Londo ?
AFL Dyfet  He is?  Okay...GA Brin, your up now :)
AFA Gary J Q = Brin
Brin Londo Okay to ask strict ToolBox ?'s
AFL Dyfet  Sure
A2Pro Tim  sure, I can make up answers to those also...
A2Pro Tim  :-)
Brin Londo Start QDII It grabs SHR screen will FindHandle(ptr(addrs)) let me
	   use?
Brin Londo If addrs is $E12000
AFL Dyfet  Do you mean is that area locked?
Brin Londo yes
Brin Londo Hard to debug behind SHR screen.
AFL Dyfet  Well, I don;t believe QD does anything by the handle.  It just
	   knows where the
AFL Dyfet  SHR screen is, and probably just locks that area for the sake of
	   memory
AFL Dyfet  manager.
AFA Gary J (If you crash while in SHR mode, type CONTROL-T <Return>)
Brin Londo Ctrl-T? gets to text mode?
AFA Gary J Yes
AFL Dyfet  Yes, from the monitor.
AFL Cheryl makes sense :)
AFA Gary J A monitor command.
Brin Londo Oh, yea It's amazing what you forget after reading 15 manuals. :)
	   
AFL Dyfet  Do we have any more questions or comments?
Coach101   ANy other goodies in the spring APDA log for II-GS types?
Brin Londo ?
A2Pro Tim  hmmmmm
AFL Dyfet  Okay, GA Brin.
Brin Londo Hints, (resounding hints on the software front), how about
	   hardware?
AFA Gary J Q = Brin
Brin Londo For AppleFest
A2Pro Tim  huh?
Brin Londo They said YES.  You heard it here first Folks!
AFL Dyfet  eh?
AFL Cheryl you didn't hear anything, Brian....
AFA Gary J What?
Brin Londo I love to spread rumors...
AFL Cheryl oh...did you ask WHICH Afest????  :)
A2Pro Tim  (he calls that a "yes"???  whooooeeee, sell him some swamp land
	   and a bridge!)
A2Pro Tim  :-)
AFL Dyfet  Don't quote me, I have non-descs to think about :)
Brin Londo Okay, see you in S.F. 
AE PhilM   ?
AFL Cheryl that's more like it :)
AFA Gary J Q = Phil
AFL Dyfet  GA Phil.
AE PhilM   How many folks tonight will be attending the Developers
	   Conference???
A2Pro Tim  Me.
A2Pro Tim  :-)
AFL Dyfet  In Kansas?
AFL Cheryl I'd like to....how do I get in?? :)
AE PhilM   No In Cupertino.
AFL Cheryl (back door??) :)
AFL Dyfet  Oh.
A2Pro Tim  San Jose actually...
A2Pro Tim  :-)
Brin Londo Company pulled my plug on S.F. but will go to Kansas.
AE PhilM   Close
AFL Dyfet  What company, Brin?
Brin Londo MCE Inc./Lawrence Productions  (educational software)
A2Pro Tim  Phil - I'll be there everyday except Monday.
AFL Dyfet  Oh by the way, I would like to thank Tim for being our patient
	   guest here
AFL Dyfet  tonight and officially end protocol :).
A2Pro Tim  <applause sign lights up>
AFL Cheryl hi Jer :)
Brin Londo Yeah Time.  ][ ][ ][
AE PhilM   Has Apple recieved a lot of A2 Attendees? Tim-or would you know.
A2Pro Tim  <the crowd goes wild>
AlphaGraph hello

A2Pro Tim  Phil - don't know...
Brin Londo Time = Tim
Coach101   Thanks Tim!
AE PhilM   ()()()() Thanks for your time, Tim.
A2Pro Tim  my pleasure...  See ya again sometime.
A2Pro Tim  If you're going to AFest, look me up.  I'll be manning the booth
	   and I'll be
A2Pro Tim  on a couple of the panels for conferences.
AFL Cheryl what booth, Tim?? (showing my ignorance) :)
A2Pro Tim  Apple's.  :-)
AE PhilM   See ya there, and at the Developers Conference.
AFL Cheryl silly me :)
A2Pro Tim  I'll be looking for ya Phil!  Maybe we can grab Mike and go get
	   lunch one day.
A2Pro Tim  :-)
AE PhilM   Just like old times except you insetad of David.
A2Pro Tim  :-)
AE PhilM   How is Dave by the way, understand he got promoted several
	   times.
A2Pro Tim  David is my boss's boss.  :-)
AE PhilM   Seemed like only a couple of year's ago he was regular folk. 
	   Congrats to him.
A2Pro Tim  I'll pass that on...
AFL Cheryl well, don't all shout at once :)
Bud Gehr   ? 
AFA Gary J Ok
AFL Dyfet  Yes Bud?
Bud Gehr   Phil whats the latest on the TWGS shipping? 
Bud Gehr   Any idea?
AE PhilM   Lots o problems--we're trying real hard--shipped about 300more
	   today.
A2Pro Tim  I'm heading out gang....   see y'all next time.  Go check your
	   mail boxes for
A2Pro Tim  your new APDAlogs.  :-)
AE PhilM   Bye Tim
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Tim.  Thanks.
AFL Dyfet  Gnight Tim :)
Bud Gehr   I ordered one from CDA and am on their list of the of the first 40
	   they will
AFL Cheryl bye Tim :)
AFA Gary J (I'll meet the mailman tomorrow  :)
A2Pro Tim  :-)
Bud Gehr   ship when they do get them in stock. I am REALLY anxious!
AE PhilM   We are shipping them as fast as we can.  Big, big backorder
	   though.
AE PhilM   And the order keep comming.
AE PhilM   Go to go make the TWGS (donught comercial)
AFA Gary J It is a product that is long overdue for the IIGS.
Bud Gehr   NO doubt about that!
AFL Dyfet  I'm sure the backorder is huge there :)
AFA Gary J It's obvious from the response.
AE PhilM   It was a real tought one to make. Seems everything is getting
	   harder and harder
AE PhilM   to do
AE PhilM   You know technology expanding everyday.  A real complicated
	   product.
AE PhilM   If it's any consolation, It's difficult for AE employees to get
	   one themselves.
AE PhilM   Only the software folks (myself included) are getting one to
	   increase productio
AE PhilM   n
Bud Gehr   Phil have you seen the mail on ATB that Herr Fixit left about the
	   the lack of
Bud Gehr   spedd increase he has seen on a TWGS equipped GS?
AE PhilM   No, tell me more...
AFL Dyfet  Oh??
Bud Gehr   I really find that hard to believe.
AFL Dyfet  Very
AE PhilM   I'm new to AL just got on a week ago.  What is ATB??
Bud Gehr   He basicly says that he did not think that window updates and such
	   were sped
AFL Cheryl Across the Boards...
AFL Cheryl a message base that linkss all the Apple // forums
Bud Gehr   up much.
AFL Dyfet  ATB is a shared message base between ALL the Apple II forums,
	   Phil.
AFL Cheryl and there's one for the Mac Forums, too :)
AFA Gary J Someone (I don't remember who) was trying to compare it with disk
	   I/O alone.
AFA Gary J It's in "Let's Discuss..." for all of the forums.
Bud Gehr   Sorry I didn;t realize that Phil was unaware of the ATB.
AE PhilM   Disk I/O is limited to 1MHz. Nothing we can do about it.
AE PhilM   Not a fair test of CPU power.
AFA Gary J I know, but that was what this guy was comparing on.  It wasn't a
	   fair test.
AE PhilM   He should know what he is doing before he publicly displays
	   misleading info.
AE PhilM   I'll check it out and download it for the folks at AE to see.  I
	   really didn't 
AE PhilM   know.
Bud Gehr   He highly endorsed the Ohio Cache card though!
AFA Gary J I haven't seen Herr Fixit's post, though.
AFA Gary J (At least I don't think I have)
AE PhilM   That what the OKS was designed for...I/O speed increase.  A
	   different product.
AFA Gary J How long ago did Herr Fixit make the post, Bud?
AE PhilM   Totally different...not the same thing.
AE PhilM   I too like the OKS card it is very nice...
Bud Gehr   I'm not sure how long ago it was, I "think" it was in a TWGS
	   folder.
AE PhilM   Overall you will see an average increase in speed of 2.2 times on
	   CPU based 
AE PhilM   tasks
Bud Gehr   It should even make the fill routine I did for CheapPaint look
	   fast if it is...
AE PhilM   It's a difference you will really notice after using one for a
	   while and then 
Bud Gehr   half as big an improvement on the GS as I have heard!
AE PhilM   switching back to slow speed (2.6mhz)
AE PhilM   You can try it now for comparison switch from (2.5) to (1) and see
	   the 
AE PhilM   difference.
AE PhilM   Time the disk at 2.6 and 1 and there is little difference
AE PhilM   Convince yourself--this is true.
AFA Gary J Try playing "Wings of Fury" at 7 Mhz.  :)
Bud Gehr   I am COMMITTED to getting a TWGS and have no doubts about it at
	   all Phil.
AE PhilM   I'm not a sales person, but this is one product that speeks for
	   itself.  I 
Bud Gehr   I just got a bit irked when Herr Fixit mentioned he so no real
	   screen update...
AE PhilM   would recommend it even if I never heard of AE.
Bud Gehr   improvements, which I really find hard to swallow.
AE PhilM   I would also recommend the OKS card or Ramkeeper with lots of RAM
	   for I/O
Bud Gehr   Herr Fixit is big into hardware sales here on ALPE BTW, I got an
	   Epic 2400...
AE PhilM   speedup
Bud Gehr   modem from him for $50 (reconditioned)
AE PhilM   Not bad...not bad at all.
Bud Gehr   and he continues to sell them here at that price.
AFA Gary J What could be "unconditioned" about a modem?
AE PhilM   If it works, buy it.
Bud Gehr   Returns he no doubt bought from Epic I would guess.
AFA Gary J Must be.
AE PhilM   What happened to Epic.  Anyone know??
Bud Gehr   I had been using a Datalinker 1200.
AFL Cheryl I'd want to know why they had to be reconditioned...Epic modems
	   haven't been out that long!!
Bud Gehr   As far as I know Epic is still in business, but they stopped
	   selling the Epic
AFL Cheryl As far as I know, they're still around...I have 2 Epic mini2400,
	   and one regular 2400 from them.
Bud Gehr   classic 2400 and are now selling the Epic Classic II 2400.
AFA Gary J I "won" an Epic Mini 2400 at AppleFest SF last Sept.  It works
	   great.
Bud Gehr   BTW Phil does AE have an upgrade policy for the 1200?
Bud Gehr   to the 2400 I mean.
AE PhilM   Yes, but I don't know what it is--Call sales 
Bud Gehr   Ok. The Epic in my view is not as good as my datalinker as far as
	   acting..
Bud Gehr   predictably with all software I have run it in. The Epic sometimes
	   refuses to
Bud Gehr   dial with ALPE software.
AFL Cheryl that's funny...I had to swap my epic to a friend who's datalinker
	   was on the 'fritz'!!
AFL Cheryl Phil...what's the warrantee on the datalinker??
Bud Gehr   at the local Apple dealer, I am not conviced that it is "that
	   much" faster or..
AE PhilM   5 Years just send it in..first call Tech Support for an RMA
	   number.
Bud Gehr   better then my GS.
AFL Cheryl great...I just have to check that it is in fact 'dead'...but it's
	   not acknowledging the dial tone
AE PhilM   Funny you should say that..I've got an SE at work and it seems a
	   little slow
AE PhilM   compared to my TWGS GS.
AFL Cheryl on his GS..with ALink..
Bud Gehr   Cheryl, my datalinker never acted weird at all in the year that I
	   have owned it
AFL Cheryl I set this friend up with ALink, configured his GS, etc...and got
	   him logged on...
Bud Gehr   Phil I worked out with a IIcx and then the SE and both were not
	   really stunning
AFL Cheryl then he got sick, and didn't use the modem for about 4
	   months...last week he called me, he couldn't
AE PhilM   Yes, but I don't know what it is--Call sales 
AE PhilM   I want a Mac SE!!!
AE PhilM   How did you manage to pull that off.
Bud Gehr   Ok. The Epic in my view is not as good as my datalinker as far as
	   acting..
Bud Gehr   predictably with all software I have run it in. The Epic sometimes
	   refuses to
AFA Gary J I was VERY lucky.  It was a local radio station contest.
Bud Gehr   dial with ALPE software.
AFL Cheryl that's funny...I had to swap my epic to a friend who's datalinker
	   was on the 'fritz'!!
Bud Gehr   I was seriously thinking of buying a Mac SE, but after using it
	   for a while...
AFL Cheryl Phil...what's the warrantee on the datalinker??
Bud Gehr   at the local Apple dealer, I am not conviced that it is "that
	   much" faster or..
AE PhilM   5 Years just send it in..first call Tech Support for an RMA
