APPLE II DEVELOPMENT FORUM CONFERENCE LOG
June 27, 1989   10:00 p.m. eastern time
Topic:   BASIC Programming (and other stuff)
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet)

JSchober   Dave... got a question for ya'.  Are the AuxTypes of DIR files
	   reserved??  (I
JSchober   assume so)
Dave Lyons Yup, I think DIR auxtypes are reserved.  The Finder *pretends*
	   that certain
Dave Lyons kinds of DIRs have certain auxtypes, so the auxtype of a DIR
	   *icon* has some
Dave Lyons significance (drop box, folder you own, etc.).  I'm talking Finder
	   on 5.0,
Dave Lyons with AppleShare folders.
JSchober   Hmmm.  But if I'm not worrying about AppleShare... well, either
	   way, Matt will
JSchober   probably kill me.  I just won't tell him.  :)
AFL Vince  Just got my first taste of Appleshare and 5.0 today, Dave..  Tim
	   and gang did some NICE work!
Dave Lyons What did you do?  I really think they *are* reserved.
AFL Marty  (death to AppleShare)
AFL Dennis Hi Jim
Dave Lyons You probably *won't* be able to set an AppleShare DIR's auxtype,
	   although
Dave Lyons I haven't tried it.  Doesn't your app work with AppleShare?
JSchober   Well, I want to keep a reference constant for a folder somewhere,
	   without ...
AFA Gary J I guess we can get started here.....
JSchober   creating a new file.  Any suggestions?
JSchober   Uhhh... what?
AFA Gary J Welcome to the Apple II Development Forum.  Tonight's topic is
	   BASIC programming.
AFL TimB   Joe, if you're talking about anything other than Rolodex....shame
	   on you! ;)
AFA Gary J I'm Gary Jacobson, and I'll act like I'm the forum leader until
	   AFL Dyfet
AFL Vince  which Basic, GS Basics, or Appleslosh?
AFA Gary J comes in  :)
AFP Draco  Gary - does that mean you'll tell bad jokes?
AFA Gary J We'll be using forum protocol this evening, so **STARTING
	   NOW**....if you
JeffDavies Can I ask a question off the subject?
AFA Gary J have a question, type a "?" on a line by itself, or if you have a
	   comment
AFA Gary J on the current topic, type a "!".
AFA Gary J I'll call on you when it's your turn, and we'll take everyone in
	   turn.
JSchober   Hi Dave... :)
AFA Gary J (Ahhh...here's Dave now  :)
AFL Dyfet  I guess I scared Vince off ??
AFL TimB   Uhoh, here's trouble!
AFA Gary J :)
AFP Draco  no more COM jokes gang
AFA Gary J We've just started, and I've instituted PROTOCOL...
AFP Draco  Oh... HI Dave!
AFL Dyfet  Okay, did Joe get his question in?
AFA Gary J Go ahead, Joe with your question..
AFL TimB   (If their Kent's jokes, not much)
JSchober   Well, I just want to finish up the question I started before Gary
	   did the intro
JSchober   I've got an Applesoft program with which I would like to store a
	   RefCon for
JSchober   a directory.  What's the best way to do this, without creating a
	   new file?
JSchober   GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave.
Dave Lyons What do you want to keep track of?  I don't see what to do offhand
	   other
Dave Lyons than creating a new file, which you don't want to do, or imbedding
	   the
Dave Lyons information in the directory's name.  Or keeping a big separate
	   file somewhere
Dave Lyons that has all the dirs' info in one place.  ga
JSchober   Well, I just need a number that indicates what the last data in
	   the dir was.
JSchober   The dir's name can't change.  :(  That's why I'd =like= to stuff
	   the number in
Dave Lyons That "last data in the dir"?
JSchober   the AuxType... but that seems to be anti-Matt behaviour...
Dave Lyons Think of it this way...if *two* programs did the same thing you
	   want yours
JSchober   A number that's an index to the most recent file put in the dir...
	   (we're
Dave Lyons to, it wouldn't work, right?  Ick.
JSchober   talking BBS development here)
JSchober   Well... yeah.  Any other little spaces that aren't used,
	   anywhere?
GSGM       ! Joe
AFL Dyfet  GA GSGM.
GSGM       Couldn't you have the program read the directory and check the
	   modified...
Dave Lyons _Any_ little spaces that "aren't used" present the same problem as
	   the auxtype:
GSGM       date field. GA
AFL Dyfet  From what I'm following, you want to add extra tracking
	   information into the
Dave Lyons why should *your* program be the one that gets to use them?
AFL Dyfet  directory itself.  I think you would be better off with a seperate
	   file to
AFL Dyfet  handle this instead of using the dir file itself.  I think Matt
	   will also
JSchober   I know, I know... but there =should= be a refCon space in the dir
	   field. :sulk:
AFL Dyfet  apperciate this :).
JSchober   Yeah, I'm sure he would, Dave :), but I'm trying to push as much
	   speed as ...
AFL Dyfet  GA Dennis.
JSchober   possible.  Ok, so it can't be done... thanks, tho! :)
Dave Lyons There *is* a refcon in a directory...it's called "the data stored
	   in a file
AFL Dennis Couldn't you place the time/date of the files in the Aux type,
	   then with a quick search find
Dave Lyons with a really weird name."  :-)
AFL Dennis the most recently modified one within the directory?  Fairly quick
	   when it comes to
AFL Dennis dir scanning.
JSchober   :)  Well, yeah, that WOULD work, Dennis, but probably would be as
	   fast as
JSchober   keeping it in a file.  Get_File_Info is much quicker than
	   Open...
Dave Lyons Idea!  If you want to use Get_File_Info
Dave Lyons instead of Open, just create a file of your own inside that dir
	   (probably a
Dave Lyons BIN file?), and use the *file*'s auxtype.  Should be fast &
	   legitimiate.
JSchober   Aha aha!  <ding!>  That's it!!  Thanks Dave!  I knew I could count
	   on you... :)
Dave Lyons :)
AFL Dyfet  Yes, that would be legitimate :).  Okay, I believe our next
	   question is from
AFL Dennis How bout using the reserved space in the Directory header, offset
	   +$14?
AFL Dyfet  GS 816.  You now have the floor.
GS 816     thank you.  
GS 816     My question may be known by some of the old timers who remember
	   things like
GS 816     call-apple in depth "All about Applesoft" and C. Bongers.  It
	   seems that I
GS 816     have found a way to duplicate the infamous RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB
	   problem that
GS 816     is described in the afore mentioned book.  I'll be honest, the
	   explaination
GS 816     of the problem is slightly over my head as it talks of tape and
	   ROM CARD
GS 816     corrections, but not if the AppleSoft is in Motherboard ROM.  Does
	   anyone
GS 816     know of a way to correct the problem by going around to the back
	   door?  That
GS 816     is via changing programming code.  It seems that there is a
	   conflict when
GS 816     arrays are searched and a gosub is on a page boundry, but even
	   adding extra
GS 816     code has not helped the situation and I still recieve the infamous
	   error msg
GS 816     when a legitimate gosub has been called.   ga
AFL Dyfet  I do vaguely recall the bug you are refering to, though I suspect
	   the problem
AFL Dyfet  is in a routine far too deeply rooted to be effected with a patch
	   other than
AFL Dyfet  with a eprom burner :).  Any other comments?
GS 816     if anyone has the book handy, it is explained on pages 100 and
	   101
GS 816     not everyone at once, please
AFL Dyfet  There are actually a couple of minor bugs in Applesoft, such as
	   with resume,
AFL Dyfet  .  I think your best bet for some of these problems is to create
	   an ampersand
AFL Dyfet  routine that operates 'correctly'.
AFL Dyfet  Any further comments?
GS 816     If anyone has any ideas, please feel free to email them to me.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe the next question is from Jeff.  GA Jeff.
JeffDavies This is off the subject, but does anybody use orca/c or orca/m in
	   the desktop
JeffDavies and have trouble with the macgen and compiling programs? I can't
	   really get 
JeffDavies either to work and need help.
AFL Dyfet  How much ram do you have in your system?
JeffDavies right now 1.25 I know I will need more, but I don't know if that
	   is it.
AFA Gary J Are you using an SCSI hard drive?
JeffDavies yes the 20SC
AFA Gary J What exactly doesn't work, does it crash?
JeffDavies yes, and when I do a ctrl-apple-T the program crashes in bank
	   @00/0000
AFA Gary J I've had exactly the same problem.  I've talked to Mike
	   Westerfield in e-mail
AFA Gary J about it here on-line, but he's never been able to duplicate
	   it.
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave.
Dave Lyons Do you have any CDAs, NDAs, or other utilities installed in your
	   system?  If
Dave Lyons so, see if the problem still occurs without them.  If it doesn't,
	   that *might*
Dave Lyons mean one of your DAs has problems, or it might mean that the ORCA
	   environment
Dave Lyons (or even part of the OS...I don't want to single out ORCA as the
	   only
Dave Lyons possibility) has a problem that happens only in "unlucky"
	   circumstances.
JeffDavies Good idea I never thing of the most obvious stuff! The orca env.
	   won't let you 
JeffDavies open a file or new window with a da active.
Dave Lyons Not even with an ORCA window in front?
AFA Gary J Let me know if you find the problem, Jeff.
JeffDavies well if an orca window is in front it's ok.
JeffDavies Vince are you the vince going to work for TML? And thanks for the
	   ideas guys!
AFL TimB   Vince who?
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I see Joe is back in the queue and is next.  I would like to
	   give the
AFL Dyfet  floor to Joe now, except that I'm not sure I will get it back :). 
	   GA Joe.
AFA Gary J :)
JSchober   (thrrrpt!)
JSchober   This is (hopefully!) a simple one -- do the Basic.System OPEN and
	   CLOSE ...
JSchober   commands respect the LEVEL byte in the ProDOS global page??  that
	   is, if I
JSchober   set a level, open a file, LOWER the lever (or is it raise it?  I
	   always get
JSchober   confused...), then do a ? CHR$(4)"CLOSE", will the opened file
	   stay open?
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave.
Dave Lyons I don't think it's documented or guaranteed.  If you only want to
	   close
Dave Lyons specific files, then do it explicitly:  ?CHR$(4);"CLOSE FILE.A",
	   etc.  The
Dave Lyons LEVEL mechanism is there for SYS programs to use, and BASIC.SYSTEM
	   *could*
Dave Lyons pass that right on to the Applesoft programmer by documented a way
	   to use it,
Dave Lyons but as far as I know that has not been done.
Dave Lyons (ga)
AFL Dyfet  Basic.System may also decide the file buffer has been closed even
	   if ProDOS
AFL Dyfet  does not.  Basic.System does use the level function to hold the
	   exec file open
AFL Dyfet  however, so at some level it does operate.
JSchober   Ok, well, I never know what files are going to be open, so I can't
	   explicitly
JSchober   close 'em.  Hmmmmm... really, Dave?  Interesting.  I'll have to
	   look at that
Dave Lyons Why don't you know??  Who opened them?
JSchober   one.  Ok, that's it... thanks.  (SEE??  Didn't take 15 mins...
	   ;)
AFL Marty  (zzzzzzzzzzz :))
JSchober   Oh, I did, but any number could be open with variable names, and I
	   don't
JSchober   currently keep a table once they're open.  (it's a long story...
	   :)
Dave Lyons If you don't know which files are open, how is the part of the
	   program that
Dave Lyons DID open them supposed to know that they are no longer available
	   for reading
Dave Lyons and writing?
JSchober   I use MLI calls to file ID numbers.  (Don't bother telling me that
	   sequential
Dave Lyons (This could *still* take 15 minutes...or I could just shut up.
	   :-)
JSchober   assignments aren't guaranteed... I know... ;)
JSchober   LOL
Dave Lyons Done, I guess.
AFL Dyfet  Again, the thing to watch is not if ProDOS keeps the file open,
	   but if Basic.
AFL Dyfet  System decides to free the buffer anyway :).  Any further
	   comments?
JSchober   Acccck.  :(
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe the next question is from Tim, who is a little off
	   (the
AFL Dyfet  subject).  GA Tim.
AFL TimB   My question is a multi-parter! :)  (Dave has already heard pieces
	   of it)
JSchober   (hmph, now HE'LL take 15 mins...   ;)
AFL Marty  (he's a _lot_ off :)
AFL TimB   With TML Pascal is it necessary to start up and initialize
	   texttools for a CDA?
Dave Lyons !
AFL TimB   Explicitly.
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave.
Dave Lyons Yup.
AFL TimB   Next question...
Dave Lyons You should make several calls, something like this:
AFA Gary J 15 seconds...  :)
JeffDavies !
Dave Lyons TextStartUp, then SetOutputDevice, SetInputDevice, SetOutGlobals,
	   and
Dave Lyons SetInGlobals.  You'll probably want to set the output and input
	   devices to
Dave Lyons be slot 3 and be either BASIC or Pascal devices.  For
	   SetOutGlobals, you need
Dave Lyons an AndMask and an OrMask.  The And mask can be $00FF (don't strip
	   off any of
Dave Lyons the lower 8 bits) and the OrMask can be $0080 (turn on bit 7). 
	   For
Dave Lyons SetInGlobals I think you'll want AndMask $007f (strip off bit 7)
	   and OrMask
Dave Lyons  $0000 (don't force any bits on).
AFL Dyfet  I knew it wasn't in Dave to give out a short answer :).  GA
	   Jeff.
AFL TimB   Can I follow up?
Dave Lyons After setting everything up, call InitTextDev(0) and
	   InitTextDev(1) to init
Dave Lyons the input device and output device.  (ga)
JeffDavies I don't know much  about the text tools but wouldn't you want to
	   do a 
JeffDavies check to see if the text tools are already active and then do a
	   start up
JeffDavies only if they aren't active?
Dave Lyons Hmmm...good question.  Actually I think it's an academic 
Dave Lyons question, since TextStartUp doesn't do a whole lot at the moment
	   anyway.
Dave Lyons One solution is to *avoid* the text tools.  Use the console driver
	   under
Dave Lyons GS/OS.  Under P8 you need to use text tools or go directly to the
	   screen.
AFL Dyfet  I think it's always a good idea to go through the motions of tool
	   startup
Dave Lyons Also, it is a good idea to
AFL TimB   Does TML Pascal have interfaces to GS/OS drivers?
Dave Lyons preserve the state of the text tools around your use of them: 
	   that means
JSchober   ! (brief question on the topic)
Dave Lyons using GetOutputDevice, GetInputDevice, GetInGlobals, GetOutGlobals
	   at the
Dave Lyons beginning and using SetXxx at the end to put everything back. 
	   ga.
AFL TimB   ^^^^^^^^^
AFL Dyfet  Um, before we get back to Tim's 'short' question, let's give Joe a
	   chance to
AFL Dyfet  sneak in his 'brief' question.  GA Joe.
JSchober   When doing output to the .console driver under GS/OS, does it
	   properly handle
JSchober   Pascal emulation codes (Ctrl-O and N for inverse on/off, etc)?
JSchober   GA
AFL Dyfet  I believe they've added a few as well as supporting the older
	   codes.  Is this
AFL Dyfet  correct, Dave?
JSchober   (did Dave pass out?)
Dave Lyons Okay, MOST of the stuff
Dave Lyons that the console driver does happens to match the "Pascal" way...I
	   don't have
Dave Lyons the manual open in front of me at the moment.  There is a lot MORE
	   stuff that
Dave Lyons the console driver can do that the Pascal codes can't.  ga
AFL Dyfet  That was my understanding also.  Okay, I guess Tim can have the
	   floor back
JSchober   Hmmm.  But so I'd have to write a conversion procedure to go
	   Pascal ==> console
AFL Dyfet  now.  GA Tim.
JSchober   Yecch.  Thanks...
JSchober   ::giving floor to Tim... gee, it's heavy...::
AFL TimB   Does TML have interfaces to GS/OS drivers?
Dave Lyons Oh, other than sending characters to the device, there are also
	   DControl
Dave Lyons calls that do keen stuff.  I *think* they are DControl, at least. 
	   Could be
Dave Lyons FST-specific calls, conceivably.  ga
AFL Dyfet  We lost Tim in there :)
AFL TimB   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AFL TimB   (You can try to shake me off, but I'm persistent! :)    )
AFL Dyfet  Okay, GA Dave.
Dave Lyons Sorry...didn't see your question, Tim.  I don't think TML Pascal
	   1.50A
Dave Lyons has GS/OS routines declared, but using the "ProDOS" directive you
	   can declare
Dave Lyons them yourself...for example, Procedure GSOSGetDirEntry(...);
	   ProDOS $201C;
Dave Lyons declares the routine so you can call it yourself.  Is this what
	   you meant?
AFL TimB   I'm a real beginner, a little advanced for me I think.  I'll wait
	   for Pascal II
AFL TimB   to use the console.driver, :)
AFL TimB   I'll go with setin and outglobals.
AFL TimB   GA
Dave Lyons You definitely need the GS/OS reference.  It's easy to model your
	   own
AFL TimB   (done, at last)
Dave Lyons declarations after the ones provided, if you have the
	   documentation.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe we are running on empty here.  Any more questions
	   for tonight?
JeffDavies I have two quick questions ...and one normal one
AFL Dyfet  Oh, I missed you Jeff.  GA Jeff.
AFL TimB   Thanks muchly (off to try out solution) :)
JeffDavies 1) wheredid the II tech notes go? and what does  AFL stand 4?
AFA Gary J II Tech Notes??
JeffDavies yes
AFL Dyfet  Let's try the second first.  AFL=Apple Forum Leader, that means
	   the poor
AFA Gary J You mean in our libraries?
AFL Dyfet  volunteer who's job it is to keep a given forum in line and
	   running.
AFA Gary J :)
JeffDavies Well  I'v been looking for the tech notes that use to be around
	   here, but
AFL Marty  (Poor, honest, hardworking slave :)
JeffDavies now can't find.
AFL Dyfet  AFA's are Forum Assistants, and they get all the dirty jobs :)
AFA Gary J :)  Yup....  heheh
AFL Marty  (AFAs play games in the entertainment area all night)
JSchober   <and AFC's answer the questions the AFL's don't know, while the FL
	   takes
JSchober   credit>
AFL Marty  :)
Doctor Why :)
AFA Gary J Jeff, as for the tech notes, look in the Apple Computer Releases
	   section
AFA Gary J of our software library.
AFA Gary J <ahem... not THIS AFA!!  :) >
AFL Marty  (AFC's ride the coattails of the famous but hardworking AFLs :)
JeffDavies ok , now for the tough one unless someone else has oa question.
JSchober   :)
AFL Dyfet  GA Jeff.
JeffDavies To save a file, in assembly, how do you do it?
JeffDavies right now I am doing the dialog box for the name
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave.
Dave Lyons You've *got* the name, and you want to know how to actually
	   create
JeffDavies then checking to see if i is present if not... I don't remember it
	   confussed me
Dave Lyons  a file and write stuff to it?
Dave Lyons Also, are you talking ProDOS 8 or GS/OS?
JeffDavies GS/OS
Dave Lyons Ah.  Do you have documentation for the GS/OS calls CREATE, OPEN,
	   WRITE, and
AFL TimB   :(
Dave Lyons CLOSE?  Those are the ones you need.
JeffDavies I think I create then write and then at the set eof and close or
	   that might be 
JeffDavies redundant at the end.
Dave Lyons You don't need to SET_EOF unless you didn't write the amount of
	   data you
Dave Lyons really wanted to.
AFL Dyfet  I hope you open somewhere in there :)
Dave Lyons You do need to Open, Write, and Close.  You need to Create first
	   if the thing
Dave Lyons doesn't already exist.
JeffDavies I don't remember exactly I was trying to save stuff I recorded in
	   Mench's 
Dave Lyons I don't know what else to tell you until you ask a more detailed
	   questin.
JeffDavies MIDIScope
Dave Lyons or ...ion.
Dave Lyons Be sure to check for errors after all the calls so you know if
	   they are
Dave Lyons really working.  Even after Close, check at least during
	   development so that
Dave Lyons you'll find out if you aren't storing a file's reference number
	   into the
Dave Lyons parameter list correctly.
AFA Gary J (questin...that must be mid-western talk for question, right?
	   :)
JeffDavies Well I will check and apply what was said thanks
Dave Lyons (For "questing," actually. :-)
Dave Lyons ok.  done
Jump Long  Hi everyone :)
AFL Dyfet  Welcome aboard Jim.  Okay, was there anything further, Jeff?
AFA Gary J Hi Jim!
Jump Long  Aye Aye, Captin' Dave
JeffDavies nope thanks alot :)
AFL Dyfet  Uh oh, I think this means we return to Tim :).  GA Tim.
AFL TimB   I'm still having problems with my CDA.  I set up my in and
	   outglobals (and ...
AFL TimB   devices) I enter a filename andthe program does a GetFileInfo with
	   no trouble, 
AFL TimB   I display the resulting values (no trouble) I ask for
	   replacements, it accepts
AFL TimB   the first writeln and readln and dies on the second one.  But I
	   don't have...
Dave Lyons Dies HOW?
AFL TimB   this problem when I'm calling from ProSEL16
AFL TimB   System just hangs.
AFL TimB   This is driving me insane (it's not a long drive) :)
Dave Lyons Will I be able to duplicate this problem with the code you sent me
	   in the
Dave Lyons P.O., Tim?
AFL Marty  gmta Tim
AFL TimB   I'm using (Input,Output) and a Page statement, could these be
	   causing it?
AFL TimB   No, DAve, I have advanced a little since last Wednesday! ;)  (Not
	   much tho)
IIGS MAN   Whats up?
Dave Lyons Gee, was that last Wednesday?  :-)  Haven't been logging on
	   regularly.  :-(
IIGS MAN   So how is System Disk 5.0 going? When is it going to be out?
AFL Dyfet  IIGS MAN, we are in protocol, which means you will have to wait
	   your turn.
AFL TimB   Just sent the newest version to you DAve. :)
AFL Dyfet  Tim, and Dave currently have the floor.
Dave Lyons Well...Tim, send me the new source & I'll take a look at it
	   tonight.
AFL TimB   I'm using the CDA as a learning experience.  :)  Sure is
	   helping!!!! :)))))
AFL TimB   (done)
AFL TimB   Thanks DAve
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave.
Dave Lyons "This summer" is when 5.0 is going to be available.  It's good. 
	   ga
AFL Dyfet  Your question has been queued, IIGS Man, and you will be next,
	   when Tim and
AFL Dyfet  Dave are done.
AFL Dyfet  GA Tim.
AFL TimB   I hear that TML is shipping TML Pascal II with GS/OS on july 1st. 
	   That's what
AFL TimB   they told me!
AFL TimB   GS/OS 5.0 that is.
AFL Dyfet  Continue Dave.
Dave Lyons GS/OS is version 3.0 on System Software 5.0.  (So there.)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, is there any further comments on Tim's ORIGINAL question?
AFL TimB   Dave :P
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe the next question is from IIgs Man.  GA.
AFL Dyfet  I think we lost IIgs Man....???
Dave Lyons (Did we already answer his question?  I jumped the gun...sorry.)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I guess we will move along to Joe then.  You have the floor,
	   Joe.
IIGS MAN   When is GSOS 3.0(system disk 5.0) going to be out?
AFL TimB   (Leave it clean Joey)
IIGS MAN   (a date)
JSchober   Dave: I thought it was GS/OS 2.0, no?  Dave (or anyone): Have the
	   annoying
JSchober   incompatibilities with the new SCSI.DRIVER been fixed yet?   
	   GA...
AFA Gary J Between June 22 and Sept 22 (summer).
AFL TimB   Smaller than a breadbasket!
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave.
Dave Lyons (No specific date has been announced, GS MAN.)  Joe, GS/OS is v2.0
	   on System
JSchober   you can kinda count out june 22-june 27... :)
AFL TimB   HEHE
Dave Lyons Software 4.0; on 5.0 is't v3.0.  There is no file called
Dave Lyons SCSI.DRIVER on 5.0; instead there is a SCSI.MANAGER and
	   SCSIHD.DRIVER (I hope
Dave Lyons I got that right).  The code is new & does not suffer from the
	   problem that
AFA Gary J (Right, Joe.  That narrows it down a bunch  :)
JSchober   <SCSI.DRIVER, SCSIHD.DRIVER... picky picky.>
Dave Lyons Glen Bredon released a patch for; I believe it works well with
	   3rd-party
Dave Lyons hard drives, too.  The SCSI.DRIVER on 4.0 was always intended to
	   be a
Dave Lyons er...an "interim" driver while the FAST one was written.  ga
AFL TimB   I gotta go.  Thanks a lot guys for the help! :) 
JSchober   Any problems with the CMS SCSI card??  (gulp)
JSchober   Night Tim!
AFL Dyfet  Gnight Tim.
Dave Lyons The SCSIHD.DRIVER works with the Apple SCSI card; it ignores the
	   CMD card.
Dave Lyons CMS.  Sorry.  As far as I know, the "generated" driver works fine
	   (although
