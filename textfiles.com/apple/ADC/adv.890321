AFL Jim    Howdy
AFL Dyfet  Hello Jim!
HazelH1    Hi guys
Dave Lyons (No parentheses needed, Joe. :-)
Matt DTS   You guys should have seen Mr. Luther today reconstructing our
	   offices like a real pro...
AFA Gary J Hi Jim!
AFL Dyfet  Oh my...
Dave Lyons <sniff> _My_ TNs haven't arrived....
Matt DTS   ...makes me wonder if maybe he missed his calling (or at least one
	   of them).
JSchober   Yeah, but aesthetics, Dave.  :)  BTW, I sent a mild nasty-gram on
	   info-apple
JSchober   about your comment that I don't like ShareWare.  :)
AFL Jim    :P Matt
AFL Marty  Hi Jim
Dave Lyons (If you want aestehtics, use "true" instead of "1=1" :-)
AFL Marty  [[[Hazel]]]
Matt DTS   (Did you get that done, anyway?  Did you pile all the garbage in
	   Dave's office like we said?)
HazelH1    HI Marty :)
JSchober   LOL... hey, good point, Dave!  Forgot THAT... (not like I use it
	   often or
JSchober   anything...)
AFL Jim    Dave, I'm still giving passing out constant reminders that we need
	   the March
AFL Jim    Tech Notes in text files.
JSchober   Hi Bill...
Lombar     I've never been in here before, what's the etiquette like?
Dave Lyons What's this...do I have an office?
BillP      Hi Joe
HazelH1    Howdy Bill!
Matt DTS   They still have to be converted by hand, and they just haven't
	   been done yet.  <shrugging>
AFA Gary J Welcome, Lombar.
Matt DTS   Dave:  Yeah, but you don't wanna go in it yet... <evil grin>
Dave Lyons What etiquette? :)
BillP      Hi Hazel!   Been a long time!
AFL Dyfet  Welcome aboard Lombar...
AFL Marty  Down the hall Dave.... to the left.... tile walls, tile floor :)
Lombar     Thanx.
AFL Jim    Well, let's get started here...
Matt DTS   or there...
AFA John   Hi Hazel!
Dave Lyons :)
Matt DTS   (Sorry - I'm in /behave mode now...)
Lombar     :)
AFL Jim    Welcome to the Apple II Development Forum! Tonight, our topic is
	   programming
AFL Jim    utilities and programming environments. We'll follow forum
	   protocol, so if you 
AFL Jim    have a question, type a question mark on a line by itself. If you
	   have a
AFL Jim    comment on the current topic, type an exclamation point on a line
	   by itself.
AFL Jim    We'll keep track of who asked to speak first and call on you when
	   it's your
AFL Jim    turn.
Parik Dude ?
AFA Gary J Q = Parik
Matt DTS   [I hate software]
AFL Jim    To start off with, I'd like to introduce my replacement here on
	   AppleLink (yes
AFL Jim    I'm leaving the ranks of AFLs). Starting in April, the new Forum
	   Leader will
AFL Jim    be Dave Sugar!
AFA Gary J Welcome, Dave!!
Matt DTS   <fanfare and tocatta>
AFL Jim    Say Hi, Dave.
Parik Dude Hi, Dave.
AFL Dyfet  Thank you!  I hope to keep things smooth during the change...
Dave Lyons Hi, Dave.
JSchober   Hi, Dave!  (Dave L, stop talking to yourself...)
AFL Dyfet  Dave's recursive
Parik Dude What's Dyfet mean? (not my question :)
Matt DTS   If you need anything from DTS, be sure to ask us so we can ignore
	   you as equally as we did Jim. <grin>
JSchober   heheh
AFL Marty  (recursive = swears repeatedly)
BillP      :)
AFL Dyfet  Older form of David....so I wouldn't get confused with a certain
	   other Dave :)
AFL Jim    I'll be here still, but in an unofficial capacity.
Parik Dude unofficial capacitance is the best.
BillP      me too  :)
AFL Jim    You mean MacDave, Dave??
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Dyfet  MacDave! :)  Another one!
Matt DTS   I can see how "AFL Sugar" might lead to some weird E-mail, that's
	   true.
JSchober   LOL Matt...
AFL Jim    Let's get on to the questions... Parik, I believe you are first in
	   the queue.
AFL Jim    GA
AFL Dyfet  :)
Lombar     I hate to sound impatient, especially for a newcomer, but my VISA
	   doesn't 
Parik Dude In the AUT forum, in INITs library a file that "speeds up text
	   output by alot.
Lombar     stretch very far...
AFA Gary J (Looks like Matt has a bug in his "behave mode"  :)
Parik Dude Has anyone used this?  Is it a RAM driver?  Just got it today, and
	   wondering 
Parik Dude what it does.  I think Orca was fassst... 
Parik Dude think = thought (but I still think)  ga
AFA Gary J Q = Parik
AFL Jim    I haven't seen it. Anyone else?
Matt DTS   !
AFL Jim    GA Matt
Matt DTS   No.
JSchober   !  (shuffling up as AUT rep...)
AFL Jim    GA Joe
Matt DTS   It could be an INIT that speeds up QuickDraw text drawing, not
	   actual text screen I/O...
Matt DTS   ...but I think I'll let Joe talk.  GA
JSchober   It patches into the Pascal text-screen (80 col... well, I guess 40
	   col, too,
AFA Gary J Q = Parik (Joe)
JSchober   if you wanted) Text Toolset.  I don't know WHAT it does to that
	   toolset, but
JSchober   anything that uses Text Tools on a Pascal driver goes like greased
	   lightning.
JSchober   ORCA and APW seem to have the best improvements.  I haven't
	   noticed any
Matt DTS   I can *guess*...
AFL Dyfet  !
JSchober   compatibility problems or anything like that.  GA...
AFL Jim    Dave, GA
AFA Gary J Q = Parik (Dave)
AFL Dyfet  How does it compare to the GS/OS console driver?
AFL Jim    (Matt, you can type an !, too)
Dave Lyons !
Matt DTS   ! (Oh, I thought my last ! was still active.  My mistake)
AFL Jim    Joe, comparison??
JSchober   It's faster, Dave.  It's REAAAL fast.  Short bugger (4 blks),
	   too.
JSchober   <that's unofficial, BTW, I can time it if you really want...>
AFA Gary J Q = Parik (Dave L, Matt)
AFL Jim    Dave Lyons, GA
AFL Jim    (and I think I'll start using Dyfet :)
Dave Lyons We're talking about Paul Elseth's FASTEXT init, right?
JSchober   (just type "Dyfet" 20 times fast...)
JSchober   Righto, Dave.
Dave Lyons If you wanna know what it does...it replaces a few functions in
	   the Text Tools:
Dave Lyons specifically 
Dave Lyons Just a sec:
AFP Draco  Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet
	   Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet Dyfet 
JSchober   (that was 16 times and slow... ;)
AFL Dyfet  !
Matt DTS   We now return to our program.
Dave Lyons Geez...printer jammed.  Anyway, it replaces WriteCString and
	   WriteString,
Dave Lyons mostly, and it checks for the special case of printing to slot 3
	   with no
Dave Lyons the firmware separately for each character.  I keep it installed
	   all the time--
AFA Gary J Ooops
Dave Lyons speeds things up a lot.  (done)
Parik Dude ? (another question)
AFL Jim    Matt, GA
AFA Gary J Q = Parik (Matt, Dyfet)
AFA Gary J Q + Parik
Matt DTS   Since the Text Tools are mainly an arbiter, they pass everything
	   along to the firmware, when some...
Matt DTS   ...of the stuff might be doable a little faster, as this init
	   shows.  The speed increase is quite...
Matt DTS   ...nice, but we still recommend that programmers use the Console
	   driver because it's not...
Matt DTS   ...slot dependent.  (See GS/OS TN #4 for more details, I think.) 
	   GA.
AFL Jim    Dyfet, GA
AFA Gary J Q = Parik (Dyfet), Parik
AFL Dyfet  It seems DL and Matt just answered both parts of my
	   question/statement!  GA
Parik Dude Has anyone here actually GOT Merlin 16+?  I'm looking for
	   something that is
Matt DTS   Ha!  We got him!  Hazing has begun!
Parik Dude like Orca/M but a faster assembler & linker... ga
DennisDoms !
AFL Jim    Somebody?? Anybody? GA Dennis
Lombar     ?
Parik Dude (don't say "No" again Matt... :)
DennisDoms `I've got it; I wouldn't claim to know it well yet.
Dave Lyons !
AFA Gary J Q = Parik (Dennis, Dave), Lombar
DennisDoms It does have provisions for importing ORCA files (HodgePodge is
	   used...
AFL Jim    Done Dennis??
AFL Jim    oops
DennisDoms as an example of a conversion).
DennisDoms GA (Done...typing "blind" :).
Dave Lyons I've got it too, but haven't used it a lot.  If you're looking for
	   something a
AFL Jim    GA Dave
Dave Lyons _little_ bit faster, Merlin 16+ is not what you want.  It's a LOT
	   faster. :)
Parik Dude :)
JSchober   heheh
Dave Lyons (Whoops...you didn't even say "a little."  There I go making a
	   minimal amount
Parik Dude thanks, GA
Dave Lyons of sense again...oh, well.)  done.
AFL Jim    How's linking to other languages?
Dave Lyons !
AFL Jim    GA Dave
Dave Lyons It can be done, but it's an extra step, I think--normally it
	   doesn't generate
Dave Lyons OMF files, but it's an option.
Dave Lyons (done)
AFA Gary J Q = Parik (Dave), Lombar
AFL Jim    GA with your question, Lombar
Lombar     I've just ordered ORCA/M.  I like the reviews on the ORCA
	   products, but admit
Lombar     ignorance.....
Lombar     I want one shell to eventually do everything.  Can I add, say, the
	   Merlin 
AFP Draco  ?
Lombar     assembler to the ORCA shell and use the ORCA pascal?
Matt DTS   !
AFA Gary J Q = Lombar (Matt), Kent
AFL Jim    I don't think you can add Merlin to the APW or ORCA environment
	   unless Glen
AFL Jim    Bredon has really changed him design :)
AFL Jim    GA Matt
Lombar     It's been four years since I did any compiler-type programming....
	     DONE
AFL Jim    Him = His
Matt DTS   Merlin is one of the three IIgs compilers or assemblers you can
	   NOT add to the ORCA shell...
Matt DTS   (the other two being MPW IIgs Assembler and MPW IIgs C :-) 
	   However, you have the concept right...
AFA Gary J :)
Matt DTS   ...in that multiple languages may be added to ORCA or APW and all
	   used under one shell.  It's just...
Matt DTS   ...that Merlin is not available in a version that runs under the
	   ORCA/APW shell.  It has it's own.
Matt DTS   GA.
Lombar     ?
AFL Jim    GA Lombar
AFA Gary J Q = Lombar, Kent
AFL Jim    (you still have the floor)
Lombar     Is it best to use all one brand of product line, or is it fairly
	   safe to
Lombar     mix and match without worrying about compatabilities?
AFL Jim    You're fairly safe mixing one high level language with assembly,
	   but you
AFL Jim    may run into some problems if you try to mix two high level
	   languages such as
AFL Jim    Pascal and C (or for that matter, ORCA Pascal and TML Pascal).
AFL Jim    GA
Lombar     I thought that according to what I read about the TML/ORCA shells,
	   you could
Lombar     mix and match C, Pascal, and Assy.  without any problems.  Anyone
	   have exper-
Lombar     ience with this?
AFL Jim    You can, but....
AFL Jim    The high level languages all use slightly different ways of
	   passing parameters
AFL Jim    and may depend on certain global routines and variables to be
	   present at run-
Lombar     Okay, I get it.  I'll just forge ahead and stick with one brand of
	   environ.
AFL Jim    time. You have to really know what the languages are doing at a
	   fairly low 
AFL Jim    level to make them talk to each other.
Matt DTS   !
AFA Gary J Q = Lombar (Matt), Kent
AFL Jim    assembly is the common denominator. 
AFL Jim    GA Matt
Lombar     I'm done for now.  Thanks.
Matt DTS   For this purpose, you can consider APW and ORCA to be the "same
	   environment"; to wit:
Matt DTS   You can use APW C or the "APW version" of TML Pascal with the ORCA
	   system with no problems.  GA.
Lombar     One more question...
AFL Jim    Kent, GA with your question...
Matt DTS   (uh-oh.  Question contention)
AFP Draco  no let him have it
AFL Jim    OK, GA Lombar
AFA Gary J Q = Lombar, Kent
Lombar     I only have 512K  :(.  Are there any pascal compilers I can use
	   besides Apple's
Lombar     I want to stick with a desktop environ
AFL Dyfet  !
AFA Gary J !
AFA Gary J Q = Lombar (Dyfet), Kent
AFL Jim    Nope, TML requires 768K and ORCA requires a Meg I think.
AFL Jim    GA Dyfet
AFL Dyfet  I would suggest TML, which has a full desktop environment, but, as
	   mentioned,
AFL Dyfet  it requires 768K...GA
Lombar     OK.  GA Kent.
AFP Draco  Thanks... I wanted to change to subject a little.
AFP Draco  Dyfet (Dave): What's the latest word on COMMAND.COM? When (if
	   ever) will we see an upgrade?
AFL Dyfet  !
AFL Jim    GA Dyfet
AFA Gary J Q = Kent (Dyfet)
AFL Jim    :)
AFL Dyfet  No, I didn't bribe Kent for that question :).  Well, we have taken
	   Command.COM
AFL Dyfet  back from PinPoint, and we will be re-releasing Command.COM
	   'release II', with
AFP Draco  I LOVE Command.COM, that's why I asked.
AFL Dyfet  all the goodies we have and with Xterm 2.0 as a complete package. 
	   For those
Matt DTS   ! ("We" = ?)
AFL Dyfet  unclear as to what Command.COM is, it is a programmable shell
	   and
AFL Dyfet  communications environment for ProDOS 8 with MANY features and
	   over 200 command
AFL Dyfet  programs.  (done...I think...:)
AFL Jim    Dyfet, WE = ??
AFL Dyfet  Oh, sorry, that would be WE as in HyperDyne Software...
AFL Jim    Dave, would you like to tell us what else HyperDyne is up to?
AFL Jim    (giving you this las chance to soapbox it before you do it and
	   look like a
AFL Dyfet  Sure.  HDS is putting out Bbasic // for the Apple // (ProDOS 8
	   based) also, and
AFL Jim    self promoter :)
AFL Marty  (BBasic???)
JSchober   <Blankenship BASIC, Applesoft with a kick... it's great!>  <===
	   unbiased, too!
AFL Dyfet  we will have a number of surprises (GS specific) by the end of the
	   year.  HDS
AFL Jim    HDS = Hyper Dave Sugar
AFL Dyfet  also has an add-on toolkit for Command.COM.  Bbasic // is an
	   enhanced Basic
AFP Draco  Dave - will you be posting some of your COM files soon?
AFL Marty  (must be too much sugar in his diet :)
AFL Dyfet  programming environment.  It's fully structured, has better disk
	   and graphics
AFP Draco  (( Despite rumors to the contrary, Sugar Daddy is NOT dave's
	   father! ))
AFA Gary J heheh
AFL Dyfet  support, and in many ways extends Applesoft into a very useful
	   environment.
AFL Marty  :)
DwightW1   how does bbasic compare with tml basic?
AFL Dyfet  In regards to COM programs (in regards to Kent's comment), most
	   everything we
JSchober   !
AFA Gary J Q = (Joe)
AFL Dyfet  have will be included already with release II of Command.COM. 
	   (done???)
AFL Jim    GA Joe
JSchober   I figure Dave could use outside comments.  ;)  BBasic sits there
	   and pretends
JSchober   it's Applesoft -- until you start programming, you can't tell it's
	   not.  But
JSchober   it offers all sorts of commands -- kinda like the GS toolbox in
	   BASIC; that's
JSchober   the best way I can think of to describe it.  (Although, unless I
	   really missed
JSchober   something, it does =not= support the GS specially; it's 128K //e c
	   GS...)   GA!
JSchober   :)
AFL Jim    Dwight, does that explain thing OK?
AFL Dyfet  (good try...most of our products seem to defy easy description
	   :)
DwightW1   yes
JSchober   :)  Well, that's true... ;)
AFL Jim    Well, the queue is empty.... Does anyone have anything new to
	   bring up this
AFL Jim    week?
Dave Lyons MIDI?
Matt DTS   (oh, God...)
Dave Lyons I managed to play a note yesterday. :-)
AFL Jim    GA Dave
JSchober   ()()()
AFL Marty  C#
Dave Lyons The Toolbox Reference Update info is incomplete, but along with
JSchober   No, no, Bb, Marty!  Sheesh...
Dave Lyons the System Disk 3.2 release notes and Jim Mensch's article in Dec
	   88 Call-
AFA Gary J Coming soon - to a shareware board near you... Dave Lyon's "Nifty
	   Tunes"!
JSchober   ROTFL Gary!
Dave Lyons A.P.P.L.E., I think it's all there.
AFL Dyfet  !
DaviesDoug yah
Lombar     --all done in C#
AFL Jim    GA Dyfet
AFL Marty  Loony Tunes?
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Dyfet  I was swamped in flashes...I just wanted to add that if anyone
	   would like
AFL Dyfet  further info on HDS products, feel free to leave me a mail message
	   with your
AFL Dyfet  address and I will see the person I have that does HDS mailings
	   now gets it...
AFL Dyfet  (done with commercial)
JSchober   "And now... Purina Cat Chow."
AFL Marty  Tim!!
AFL TimB   Marty!!
JSchober   (Howdy, Tim!)
AFL Jim    Hi Tim
AFL Jim    Tim, I was about to mention your conference this week, but I'll
	   let you do it.
AFL Jim    GA Tim
AFL TimB   OK!
DwightW1   ?
AFA Gary J Q = Tim, Dwight
Matt DTS   (How con-VEEEE-nient)
AFL TimB   Tomorrow at the Apple // Music and Sound Forum at 10pm EST we'll
	   be ...
AFL TimB   introducing Matt Denman, Apple Sound Tool programmer
	   extraordinaire!....
AFL TimB   We'll also be giving away THREE HOURS of AppleLink - PE time to
	   the person...
Dave Lyons Uh oh, we're in treble now....
AFL TimB   who asks (in my opinion) the best question.
JSchober   ::bad pun alert, Dave Lyons!::
Matt DTS   (I'm gonna thrash that boy when he gets here...)
AFL TimB   So be there or be a four equal sized object!
AFL Marty  Joe... don't harass the staff :)
AFA Gary J :)
Dave Lyons Take "note" of the prize...don't let anybody "beat" you to
	   it....
AFL TimB   (Why's that Mr Matt?)
Matt DTS   (not Matt, Dave!)
AFL TimB   (I'm a poet too)
AFL Jim    OK GA with your question Dwight
JSchober   Ugh... get Dave OUT of here!  ::groan::
DwightW1   dave, i want your 'nifty list' shareware program...and i plan to
	   pay for...
Dave Lyons And I'm going to fix the rest of your appliances to blow up on
	   you.... :)
AFL Jim    (and hush up enveryone else)
AFA Gary J Q = Dwight
AFL TimB   :X
THE GIBBER Well....At least the Bass buns are out of the way ;)
THE GIBBER oops puns
DwightW1   it... so give me the cost and where to send for it please....I
	   NEED IT!!
AFL Jim    Go Dave... a sale is made.
AFL Marty  This is your lucky day Dwight! :)
AFA Gary J Q = Dwight ($Dave$)
Dave Lyons Okay, my address is PO Box 287, North Liberty IA 52317, and Nifty
	   List is
AFL Dyfet  (and another starving programmer gets supper tonight)
Dave Lyons fifteen bucks.  If you're in a hurry, download it from ADV or AUT,
	   but you'll
Dave Lyons get a disk in any case when I get your bucks.
DwightW1   I have no doubt you have put much effort into the production of
	   your .....
AFL Jim    or dollars as they're known outside of North Liberty...
Dave Lyons (And if you already had Nifty List installed, you could do a
	   screen dump now
Dave Lyons instead of writing down that address. :-)
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Dyfet  (Nifty List truelly is)
DwightW1   program, so i will send for it prepaid AS ALL PEOPLE THAT WANT
	   SHAREWARE
DwightW1   thanks dave
Matt DTS   (if he already had Nifty List, he wouldn't need to see the address
	   on-line)
Dave Lyons (That's true, too.)
AFA Gary J He'll have to change the address, now - to California
Dave Lyons (Matt thinks Nifty List's user interface is the most user-friendly
	   one in the
Dave Lyons Whole World, by the way. :)
JSchober   hehehe
AFL Marty  ?
DwightW1   let's hope that is not necessary to change addresses
AFA Gary J Q = Marty
AFL Jim    GA Marty
AFL Marty  How much time will you be spending in the DTS jacuzzi, Dave? :)
AFA Gary J Just assign a handle to your address, Dave.
DaviesDoug and matt doesn't even like "bill and ted's excellent adventure"
	   so...
DaviesDoug he should know
Matt DTS   ("The testmonial was portrayed by actors and is not intended to
	   imply a true endorsement.")  :-)
AFL Marty  (the hour's up) :)
Matt DTS   DTS Jacuzzi?  Where?
JSchober   That's true, anyone who would want to use NiftyList would probably
	   be able to
JSchober   deref a handle...
Matt DTS   I keep asking for one and Rilla keeps saying "Maybe"...
AFL Marty  Rilla should learn to share.
Matt DTS   (we have a sink with a vortex under a hot water tap; does that
	   count?)
AFL Dyfet  (does Dave now become Dave DTS?)
Dave Lyons The jacuzi is where you throw the old GS batteries once they start
	   leaking,
Dave Lyons right?
JSchober   ugh...
Matt DTS   Sure.  Then YOU go sit in it.
Dave Lyons Beats me...I may keep my current screen name if that doesn't
	   bother anybody
AFL Marty  only when occupied :)
AFA Gary J That would certainly stir things up!  :)
JSchober   Boy, those three'll make a team, alright.  :-)
Dave Lyons too terribly much....
AFL Marty  The Three Amigos?
AFP Draco  Dave - I'm afraid we might confuse you with a civilian.
Dave Lyons (That way you don't even need to swirl or heat the water w/
	   outside forces.)
JSchober   <=== going to die of pun attack in another few seconds... LOL
	   Marty...
Matt DTS   Dave?  Civil?  It'll never happen.
AFP Draco  Joey - Pun stroke?
Dave Lyons :)
JSchober   Righto, Kent.  :)  ::slump, dead::
Matt DTS   "And with a stroke of a pun, the mighty were felled."
Matt DTS   (I can just see AFL Jim shaking his head and mumbling "I'm almost
	   out!  Hee hee hee!")
AFP Draco  Wil will PUNish them PUNctiaully
AFL Scott  And now.. straight from the from... Nah....
AFL Jim    Well.... thanks for stopping in tonight and remember to stop into
	   the auditori
Dave Lyons The pun is mightier than the sored?  or something....
AFL Jim    um next week when you'll get a change to talk to Tom Weishaar,
	   some editors 
JSchober   LOL.... no, Scott, don't try it... ;) oh my... these =are=
	   deadly... :))
Dave Lyons You could probably confuse me with a simple card trick
	   actually...no
Dave Lyons civilians necessary.
AFL Jim    from Call-A.P.P.L.E. and Nibble.
AFL Jim    See you there!
AFA Gary J ()()()()
AFL TimB   Moral: Never trust a developer from the mid-west!
AFL Jim    Good night everyone (I have to run)
DwightW1   well, good-bye everybody, and again thanks dave
