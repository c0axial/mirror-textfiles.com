Topic:  Assembly Langauge Programming
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet)


AFL Dyfet  Well, this looks like a very unusual group here tonight :)
AFA Gary J Unusual?
AFA Parik  we all have humpbacks?
AFL Dyfet  Hey, I think that worm is for us :)
Doctor Why Did I forget to zip up?   :)
AFL Jack   unusual?  Do we all snore?
RosenNeil  Hey...Developers ARE unusual!
Doctor Why (and proud of it)
AFL Dyfet  This is true, Neil :)....Hello KingsX :)
AFL Marty  I resemble that remark!
AFA Gary J unusually usual.
AFL Marty  as usual
RosenNeil  Is this a usual meeting of the unusual usuals?
AFL Dyfet  Tonight, as the banner says, we will be focusing on Assembly
           Language
AFL Marty  It usually is :)
AFL Dyfet  Programming...I think, for the moment, we will dispense with
           protocol :)
RosenNeil  Which assembler to most people here usually use?  Just curious
AFA Parik  clc?  adc?  wdc?  xba!  pei.  whoops, data overflow
AFA Gary J Oh no.  Usually? :)
AFL Dyfet  I am kinda fond of Merlin 16+ for small projects myself :)...Fast
           to get in,
Doctor Why someone grab the bit bucket!
AFL Dyfet  fast to code, and fast to get it out the door :)
Coach101   Myself, ASM65816 Apw
AFL Dyfet  Or call for Fortran Man's sidekick, Billy Bit :)
AFA Parik  orca/m forever.
AFA Gary J ORCA/M and Merlin here.
TimY2      I usualllly Orca/M.
JDavies1   Orca kicks!
Doctor Why What little I do, I use ORCA/M.
AFA Parik  has anyone checked out lisa?  Its pretty cool.  VERY VERY VERY
           fast.  But its
AFA Parik  interface is a bit awkward.  :(
AFL Dyfet  Orca I feel is supperior for LARGE projects :), but for quick and
           dirty things,
AFA Gary J Merlin's fast too.
AFL Dyfet  I do like Merlin :)
JDavies1   Is it the same as the old LISA (2.5?) for 6502?
AFA Parik  Lisa is faster.  ;)
AFA Parik  Its been improved tremendously JDavies.  Its a mousetext based
           editor, desktop
RosenNeil  Hi Phil
AFL Marty  Why do you feel ORCA is superior?
AFA Parik  sorta thing (text though), mouse support, etc.  
AFL Dyfet  Lisa is a little combersome to use, and I can't list out their
           source files
AFL Dyfet  with my nifty listing utility :)
AE PhilM   Hi Niel
AFA Parik  It uses less memory and is faster than APW Marty.  Its not menu
           based like
JDavies1   ORCA's desktop is pretty cool.
AE PhilM   (Neil)
AFA Parik  merlin.
AFA Gary J ORCA or APW is the only way to go if you want to combine multiple
           languages.
AFL Marty  Assuming you don't need to combine multiple languages, is there
           much advantage
AFL Marty  in one over the others?
RosenNeil  Thats what I like about ORCA since I love (ducking) Pascal!
Coach101   The expandable shell of Orca/Apw are really useful also...
AFA Gary J I love ducking Pascal too.
AE PhilM   The enviroment.....and partial assemblies are a BIG time saver!
AFA Parik  there are a ton of utilities for apw/orca also.  
AFL Dyfet  And you can script and batch assemble/link/everything :)
Coach101   PASCAL?  Is that the "pseudo" language used to train
           programmers?
AE PhilM   With partials I can turn over an 80000 line program in under 2
           minutes.  
RosenNeil  Hey...If Pascal is used properly (like I use it), It is a good
           language
AFA Parik  are you using the new linker Phil?
TimY2      But APW takes up a lot of space in bank 01. Correct?
AE PhilM   Yes
Coach101   How do you edit an 80,000 line program (it has comments doesn't
           it)?
AFA Parik  Tim - I use orca/m and it doesn't use up any of bank $01, as long
           as my program
AFA Parik  is not a shell base.  You must make it s16.
AE PhilM   You need memory and a hard disk to run APW or ORCA effectively.
TimY2      Ahhhhhh..I see.
AFA Parik  (otherwise the orca/m prodos intercept gets in the way)
RosenNeil  memory is an UNDERSTATEMENT!
AFA Parik  Phil, is the new linker faster or slower for you?
AE PhilM   The program source takes up 3 3.5inch disks and is spread over 60
           files
AFA Gary J wow
A GibberFC )bak(
AE PhilM   Faster....If you do basic stuff and dont have a lot of segments.
AE PhilM   MPW/GS is also VERY nice...that is if you dont mind using a MAC
           :))
Coach101   Howdy Dave...
RosenNeil  Phil......no dirty language in here :)
Coach101   Phil, do you prefer partial assemblies/compiles (Orca) or
           individual
Coach101   files (MPW)?
AE PhilM   Im used to both now.  I like partials a lot...and I also like
           files.  I used
AE PhilM   UNIX in college it's a different way of structuring your source
           code but its 
AE PhilM   just that (different) not bad.
DavidD117  What is out for System v5.0?
RosenNeil  or is 5.0.2 out yet for that matter?
AFL Dyfet  What do you mean, David?  In terms of utilities/tools?
DavidD117  Yes
Coach101   :)
AE PhilM   We recieved 5.0.2 today....tomorrow we will re-master Vulcans and
           all our 
AE PhilM   other stuff and start shipping 5.0.2 !!!
AFA Parik  what?  you're not gonna wait for 5.0.3?  ;)  (just kidding)
AFL Dyfet  Well, there is APW 2.0, with express and Rez edit, Dave :)
JDavies1   What exactly was wrong woith 5.0?
AFL Dyfet  (I should say Rez compiler and de-compiler, not edit :)
Coach101   Apw 2.0 is out????
RosenNeil  When will 5.0.2 be available to us?
AFA Parik  will both disks have to be put online, or can it be just the indiv
           files?
AFL Dyfet  Neil, I have not seen the terms of electronic distribution for
           5.0.2 yet, so
Dave Lyons BTW, Express and Rez are just part of "APW Tools and Interfaces
           Update" or
AFL Dyfet  I do not know myself how soon we can put it up :)
DavidD117  <--- has problems with downloading for four hours
Dave Lyons something like that...they work fine with APW 1.0.
AFL Dyfet  OIC, he asked 'OUT' :)
Coach101   Dave Lyons, to your knowledge is Apw 2.0 available from Apda
           now?
JDavies1   The disk for Tools and Interfaces cost $50.
AE PhilM   Yes Dave,  WHEN CAN WE GET APW 2.0???
Dave Lyons Nope, APW 2.0 is not available yet.
AE PhilM   Has anyone seen the new disassembler from the Byte Works?
AFA Parik  i've got it.  pretty neat!
AFA Gary J I'd like to see it, it sound pretty neat!
Coach101   BTW, there are some disagreements between the new tools the Orca
           shell
Coach101   and compilers....
AFA Parik  It disassembled appleworks GS.  LOL
JDavies1   What's the new disassembler?
AE PhilM   Yeah....its really nice.
AFA Gary J How is it being marketed?  Is it an add-on utility to ORCA/M?
AFA Parik  Its a seperate program for $49.95 (ouch)
AFA Parik  Its written by Paul Elseth.
AFA Gary J $49.99 list?
AFA Parik  yes.
AFA Parik  the new disassembler is a add on for apw/orca that will
           disassemble any program
DavidD117  what about copy protection?
AFA Parik  that is a BIN, S16, EXE, and a few others I believe.  It works
           great, it has
JDavies1   Where can it be found?
RosenNeil  They were selling it at AFest....but it had to be mail to you :(
AFA Parik  abilities for scripts, etc.  It even has a script for
           disassembling the GS
AFA Parik  roms!  I bought it at Applefest (the DOCS had to be mailed to me)
           and it works
AFA Parik  like a charm.  david - yes, you can disassemble a copy protected
           program and
AFA Parik  then break the protection using the source.
AE PhilM   Its not copy protected.  Any one thought of writting scripts that
           would 
AFA Gary J What
DavidD117  :)
AE PhilM   disassemble the Apple ROMS :))
AFA Gary J Oops... what was the going price for it at AppleFest?
AFL Dyfet  Assuming you can bring it into memory and save it as a file, David
           :)
AFA Gary J (not list, I hope :)
RosenNeil  can you disassemble the disassebler?
RosenNeil  no gary...50% off  $25.00
AE PhilM   No the scrip that comes with it for disassembling the ROM is
           pretty lame....I
AFA Gary J That's what I figured.
AE PhilM   mean REALLY disassemble the ROMS...comments and all :)
JDavies1   Do you get it from ByteWorks? Or where.
DavidD117  Does anyone know much about using assembly and the Apple Video
           Overlay Card?
AFA Parik  $25.00.  It comes as a desktop version and a shell version.  True
           Phil.  It
AFA Parik  did put in a lot of garbage.  :(
AFA Gary J each version is $49.95, or do you get both versions?
AFA Parik  I bought it at the byteworks booth at AppleFest Jdavies.  
AFA Parik  You get both versions.
RosenNeil  Parik...Do you know if it can disassemble DAs?
AFA Parik  yes it can.
JDavies1   Thanks Parik
AFA Gary J Sounds neat.
AFA Gary J How do you proceed through a disassembly?  What steps do you
           take, and
Doctor Why Parik, when did you get the docs?
AFA Parik  it requires 5.0 by the way.
AFL Dyfet  Dissasembly of 16 bit applications could be very tricky,
           considering all the
AFA Gary J can you back up the disassembly if you find your getting into
           data?
Coach101   Did any of the RezEditors make it to market yet?
AFA Parik  I still haven't gotten then Wayne.  :(  You load a file, and then
           it'll dis it.
AFL Dyfet  ways and places one can switch modes...I would be impressed by a
           product that
AFL Dyfet  could even attempt to handle that well :)
Doctor Why I'm waiting for them also.  :(
AFA Gary J Merlin's dissasembler can handle the changes as it comes to them,
           but of course
DavidD117  Has anyone used the Apple Video Overlay Card?
AFA Gary J there's problems if any modes are switched in a subroutine.
AFL Dyfet  Merlin's dissasembler can handle simple 'linear' situations, but,
           as you just
Dave Lyons Yup, I have a video overlay & have used it some.
AFL Dyfet  pointed out, it can get lost with a switch in a subroutine :)
AFA Parik  Its also difficult to tell where text areas are as it doesn't
           print ascii eqivs
JDavies1   To create a game like Dragon SLayer? If anyone remembers that.
AFL Dyfet  The ultimate test of any smart dissasembler is to use it on a long
           file, re-
AFA Parik  very possible JDavies.  Expensive though.  ;)  
AFL Dyfet  assemble the source it produces, and see if it really runs :)
AFA Parik  APDA now sells some video toolkit tools, look in forumlink
           (keyword forumlink)
AFA Parik  for more information.
AE PhilM   Dyfet, the disassmebler is an interactive tool not magic.  It just
           makes your
JDavies1   Well the Game would come with a player (Apple of course) @$1249
           each.
AE PhilM   job easier of interpreting the code...thats all.
AFL Dyfet  That was the point I was trying to bring accross, Phil...I have
           seen some
AFL Dyfet  very sufisticated dissasemblers for other CPU's, but those have
           been done for
AE PhilM   In the 68000 (especially the Mac) where DATA and CODE are
           seperated that is 
AFL Dyfet  hardware that does not have opcodes which change state and mode
           :)
AE PhilM   much easier to do...that is not the case with the 65816 and thus
           impossible.
AE PhilM   Unless the disassembler is "smart" enought to distinguish code
           from data...that
AE PhilM   would require super AI capabilities.
AFL Dyfet  That is also true, Phil :)...If good consistant programming
           practices are used,
RosenNeil  as opposed to super AE capabilities? :)
Dave Lyons (It would require more than super AI...you could write code where
           some stuff
Dave Lyons is *both* code and data. :-)
JDavies1   I have a real problem doing that. And that's with RI.
AFA Gary J Parik, I missed if you answered about "backing up" the program
           counter during
AFL Dyfet  the product should be able to provide a very reliable source :)
AE PhilM   True Dave
AFA Parik  In the past two minutes I just disassembled shrinkit.  hehehe 
AFA Gary J a disassembly.  Can the ORCA disassembler do that?
AFA Parik  what do you mean backing up pc?  you mean between jsls?
AE PhilM   True Dyfet...but there are times that I purposely mix data and
           code just to 
AE PhilM   make it a little tougher for the hacker to take apart the code.
           :))
AFA Gary J No, like if you are disassemling along, and find yourself into
           data, or 
JDavies1   Doesn't Merlin16's Sourceror do the same things?
AFL Dyfet  With a suitable bit of recursion and some deduction and a little
           smarts, you
Dave Lyons Gary, Mike W demo'd it to me briefly at AFest...you just select
           part of the
AFL Dyfet  can find MANY instances of mixed code and data...
AFA Gary J ASCII stuff.  Can you re-position your program counter to back-up
           to where
AFA Gary J you were still getting good code?
AFA Parik  It disassembles the WHOLE thing Gary.
AFA Parik  You then run through it afterwords.
Dave Lyons disassembly and choose a menu item to re-disassemble that part in
           a different
Dave Lyons way.
AFA Gary J Ugh.
AFA Gary J Oh.
AFA Gary J That's not too bad, then.
AFA Parik  thats right - you can make str's, etc.  But it has no text display
           (ascii chars
DavidD117  Does anyone know what GSOS is written in?
AFA Parik  so its a bit difficult unless you print out the file.  
AFL Dyfet  An easy and interactive tool is what is often needed :)...the
           results may not
AE PhilM   GS/OS is written in Assemble (I hope)
AFL Dyfet  be perfect, but it can be very useful and usable, especially when
           studying
JDavies1   GSOS is hopefully
AFA Gary J AppleSoft basic
AFL Dyfet  other programs to learn from them :)
JDavies1   written in assembly
Dave Lyons Yes, GS/OS is all written in assembly.
AFA Parik  prodos 16 was written in logo I hear... ;)
AFA Gary J :)
AE PhilM   :)
JDavies1   No Parik thats GSWorks.
AFL Dyfet  No, Parik, in Pilot :)
RosenNeil  maybe BASIC
Doctor Why I heard that it was written on July FORTH.
Dave Lyons (Next topic, anyone? :)
DavidD117  Copy protection
AFA Parik  whats apple's new IIe/c tools for development?  (new assembler or
           something
AFA Gary J What about it?
AFA Parik  announced at KC?)
AFL Dyfet  Let's cover David's question first, people :)
AFA Gary J It's probably part of MPW, Parik  :)
AFL Dyfet  Now, what precisely is your question, David?
JDavies1   Do you mean cracking it or protecting your own stuff?
DavidD117  cracking so it can be used with a hard disk
DavidD117  Is there any programs out there like copy plus but for the Apple
DavidD117  .
JDavies1   I agree with that especially If Brian Greenstone is on.
AFL Dyfet  There are a number of programs for COPYING protected software, but
           none of
JDavies1   Why ask for the master disk every level?
AFL Dyfet  those packages allow you to do more than that; You cannot use it
           to install
AFL Dyfet  protected software onto a harddisk, for example.
AFA Parik  Copy II+ exists for the Apple II david.
JDavies1   Kill the ServiceMgr
AFA Gary J Didn't Copy II+ have some patches or something like that?
AFA Parik  Copy II+ does indeed allow hard drive installation.
AFA Gary J I thought so.
DavidD117  on the gs?
AFA Gary J Yes.
AFL Dyfet  They have added patch files?  I was not aware of that :)...but
           then, I have
AFA Parik  I'd hold off on purchasing it as v9.0 is due for release real
           soon.  Yes, there
JDavies1   Well didn'y Copy II+ just break the protection?
AFA Parik  is a GS section on it with deprotects for over 200 GS programs. 
           Many allow you
AFL Dyfet  not had need for that feature of Copy II+ :)
AFA Parik  to install it on the hard drive (not all).
AFA Parik  With a little practice, you can do it yourself though.  I suggest
           dling the
AFA Parik  deprotects in the games forum software lib / information center /
           deprotects.
JDavies1   Every Parameter with the '(HD)' was suppose to allow you to
           install it on a HD.
JDavies1   Are we off the subject, or is it me?????
Dave Lyons Okay...now for the Apple II development tools that were introduced
           at KC?
AFL Dyfet  Yes, we are, Davies, and I think we should move to that second
           question, as
AFL Dyfet  Dave has just done :)
JDavies1   OK
Dave Lyons The stuff that was introduced is a compact run-time library of
           assembly
Dave Lyons routines, and a set of macros to go with it.  The result is an
           environment
Dave Lyons that you can program in really quickly, for some kinds of Apple II
           programming.
Dave Lyons There are routines & macros for dealing with 2-byte integer
           variables,
AFA Gary J Neat.  What kind of routines?
Dave Lyons strings up to 256 bytes, and arrays up to 4 dimensions.
Dave Lyons Now for the semi-bad news:  so far, the macros are only for the
           MPW IIgs
Dave Lyons cross assembler.  We would like to release a version for APW, too,
           but so
Dave Lyons far we haven't found a way to do it that makes it easy to use (the
           macros
JDavies1   Dave, we should do something bad for bring us on like that.
Dave Lyons are pretty complex, using lots of conditional tests that can't be
           done the
Dave Lyons same way in APW).
Dave Lyons BTW, the author of the routines is Eric Soldan of Apple II
           Developer Technical
Dave Lyons Support.
DavidD117  Can APW be used in ORCA/C's GUI?
Dave Lyons GUI?
Dave Lyons (Graphical User Interface?)
AFL Dyfet  I think he means 'Prizm' :)
DavidD117  Graphical User Interface
Dave Lyons The ORCA shell and the APW shell are very similar; the assemblers
           are
Dave Lyons identical.
DavidD117  Let's say desktop:)
AFL Dyfet  You can use most of the utilities that run under APW with ORCA. 
           Many of the
AFL Dyfet  same utilities provided with APW itself are also already present
           in the ORCA
AFL Dyfet  system.
AFL Dyfet  As DL pointed out, some (many) utilities are in fact identical
           :)
DavidD117  OK I 've got a question
AFL Dyfet  Okay, go ahead, David...
Dave Lyons I've got an answer...let's see if they match. :)
JDavies1   Dave BTW thanks for all help.
DavidD117  Is there any talking software for the //gs that can be developed
           with
DavidD117  Assembly?
DavidD117  ie. speech tools?
AFL Dyfet  TML used to provide a toolset you could install that would
           synthesise speach
AFL Dyfet  (a speach tool, as you put it) :).  I have never used it myself,
           but I believe
AFL Dyfet  it is still available.
Dave Lyons TML's speech toolkit is still available...but there's a hefty
           license fee
Dave Lyons from First Byte if you want to distribute it with your product.
Dave Lyons (It's also written as a three System toolsets, which bugs me. 
           User toolsets
AFL Dyfet  First Byte, in that case, has an interesting connotation :)
Dave Lyons are provided & ought to be used; there will be a November
           Technical Note from
Dave Lyons me on that subject.)
DavidD117  Can SmoothTalker just be patched into a regular program?
AFL Dyfet  Yes, I was wondering about their use of system toolsets also,
           Dave, and at
AFL Dyfet  one point had the impression that assignment of toolsets may be
           sanctioned by
AFL Dyfet  Apple.  A tech note would be very good for future clearification
           on this.
Dave Lyons My technical note, in its current form (going out for review
           inside Apple)
Dave Lyons says that all 255 System toolset numbers are reserved for
           Apple--as far as I
Dave Lyons know that's true, and we haven't ever assigned a system toolset #
           to a third
JDavies1   Speaking of Tech Notes does anyone what note discusses CDevices
Dave Lyons party.
Dave Lyons (Actually, somebody stole #30, which was a Bad Move, because now
           it's the
Dave Lyons Resource Manager!)
Dave Lyons (Those programs don't work too hot under 5.0.x.)
DavidD117  But First Byte is the only option?
AFL Dyfet  Somebody was being very bad, I see :)...David, I am not familiar
           with the
AFL Dyfet  smoothtalker, but there are many external speach senthesysers that
           can be
AFL Dyfet  hooked up to a serial port.  Making those talk is as easy as
           writing text to
AFL Dyfet  them :).  A few of the older internal cards that were once made
           for the Appe
DavidD117  Let's let the gs show its INTERNAL gifts I say.:)
DavidD117  I know RC makes double talk
AFL Dyfet  could also be easily adapted, if one is profient enough to write a
           driver :).
AFL Dyfet  Also, there is somewhere the 'old' SAM software, which provided an
           all software
AFL Dyfet  speach senthesyser.
DavidD117  for what systems?
AFL Dyfet  (SAM = 'Software Automated Mouth', I believe...the versions I
           recall were all
AFL Dyfet  8 bit, but it is possible that SAM was converted...)
DavidD117  couldn't be very understandable then
AFL Dyfet  It was not, David.  I do not know how understandable the TML
           toolkit is,
AFL Dyfet  but I suspect it suffers from the same limitations.
DavidD117  I have heard it, I'll give it about a 6 out of ten.
