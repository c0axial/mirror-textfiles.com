APPLE II DEVELOPMENT FORUM CONFERENCE LOG
August 22, 1989  10:00 p.m. eastern time
Topic:  GS/OS and System Software 5.0
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar  (AFL Dyfet)

AFL Dyfet  Hello Parik!
AFA Parik  does anyone know what the maximum size of a segment can be?  
JimMensch  yes, code segment max is 64K
AFA Parik  MM gives a error if a segment is 65536 bytes...$201
AFL Dyfet  If you like 3 byte zero page pointers, your data can be as large
           as you want :)
JimMensch  all other segments can be as large as you want
AFL Dyfet  Well, I see some people are starting to filter in...
Coach101   Montagne, ever come up with any leads on 65536 unclaimed
           interrupts?
AFL Dyfet  We will be officially starting in a minute or two, Scotty :)
Montagne   No proof, if that's want you mean.
AFL Dyfet  I've had mixed experiances with 6551 uarts myself...
Coach101   My, and Dyfet's (I think), suspicion is that extraneous
           interrupts
Coach101   are not being handled correctly by ALPE or AWGS....   4.0 did
           not
Coach101   seem to care but 5.0 is picky...
JimMensch  the interupt manager now cares more about unclaimed interupts...
JimMensch  it thinks they are a bad idea...
AFL Dyfet  I'm sure there are reasons for this new pickyness...perhaps
           related to getting
AFL Dyfet  us to dyna-slot arbitration and interrupt support from switched
           slots??? :)
Montagne   Actually, it has nothing to do with dynamic slot arbitration.
Bernard    How do you rename a volume with 5.0?
Dreid      65536 uncalimed interuppts quit Alink quickly
II GS1     what are the differences in ver 5.0?
JimMensch  you click in the desktop, then click once on the icon ya wanna
           rename. type the name and hit rtn
AFL Dyfet  I think we had better get started here....Okay, Welcome to the
           Apple II Dev.
AFL Dyfet  Forum.  Tonight's topic is GS/OS and System Software 5.0.  WE WILL
           BE USING
AFL Dyfet  PROTOCOL, starting NOW!  This means if you wish to ask a question,
           please enter
AFL Dyfet  a '?' on a line by itself, and if you wish to comment on the
           current question,
AFL Dyfet  please enter a '!' on a line by itself.  Before we actually get
           started with
EdwardF4   =\
AFL Dyfet  tonights discussion, I would like to introduce our special guests
           tonight;
EdwardF4   (sorry.  Kitten on keyboard.)
II GS1     lol
AFL Dyfet  Jim Merrit and Ray Montage, who have been directly involved in
           bringing GS/OS
AFL Dyfet  about at Apple computer :).  Jim, if you would like to step
           forwared and
JimMensch  (Jim Merrit is not here...)
AFA Gary J :)
JimMensch  he's on vacation...
AFL Dyfet  introduce yourself, feel free to do so :)...(Oops, sorry Jim...I
           got my Jim's
AFL Dyfet  confused :)...
JimMensch  But, he is in charge of the AUG group which is in charge of the
           Finder
JimMensch  the control panel and the Advanced disk utilities. He is also a
           big proponent of pascal
II GS1     how do you get involved with AUg?
JimMensch  Now, I on the other hand, write tools 
JimMensch  I worked priumarily on Quickdraw, windowMgr, Control Mgr, event
           mgr, and memory mgr for the 5.0
JimMensch  system disk.
JimMensch  GA
AFL Dyfet  (What a birthday :)....Okay, Ray, would you like to introduce
           yourself?
Montagne   Howdy, all.  I've been working on GS/OS since it's conception --
AFA Gary J (we have a nice sized party here for your birthday, Dave :)
Montagne   working mostly on generated drivers, loaded drivers, the device
           dispatcher
Montagne   and the device manager.
Montagne   GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay, thank you gentlemen.  Now, I believe we are ready for our
           first question,
AFL Dyfet  from AFC Joyce...You have the floor now, Joyce...
AFC JoyceM I am having great difficulty in getting 5.0 to re-name a
           folder...how do I
AFC JoyceM overcome this problem?  Thank you.  GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...:)
JimMensch  Its quite simple, click once in the blue background and then click
           on the folder
JimMensch  Then, start typing the new name for the folder, when you are done
           press return and its renamed. GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay, GA Joyce, I take it you have something to add...
JimMensch  (Was I Wrong joyce??? :)
AFC JoyceM So it works differently than 4.0?
JimMensch  yes, it works different from 4.0
JimMensch  ga
AFC JoyceM Thank you.  GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next question is from Coach.  You have the
           floor now...
Coach101   I was dumping a GrafPort while chasing a ScrolllRect problem and
           noticed
Coach101   that the font handle now has some high order bits set (i.e.,
           80e077d4)
Coach101   Waht is the significance of the high order bits in a handle and is
           it
Coach101   now legal to play games with the high order bits in pointers?
JimMensch  yes coach, thats cause you have the system font installed as the
           current font
JimMensch  that is the fastfont handle...
JimMensch  Coach, its legal for me to play games, with the high order bit,
           but not for you
JimMensch  sorry GA
Coach101   Thanks..... GA
BRCCMAIL   Is it possible to have other FastFonts besides Shaston?
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I see that our next question is from II GS1, who left, so I
           believe that
AFL Dyfet  BRCCMAIL has the floor next, although he stole it early :)
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...
JimMensch  Well, yes it is possible to have other fast fonts, in fact I have
           a few others, but since I have not
JimMensch  published the specs for how they work, you can't create your own.
           We may release more fast fonts
JimMensch  but, as you can see they take up a lot of disk space and memory
           room...
JimMensch  ga
JimMensch  and the specs will be released as soon as I get around to it...
JimMensch  ga
AFL Dyfet  Hmm...Okay, I believe the next question is from Dreid...GA
           Dreid...
Dreid      What about the defect in SCSI.driver mentioned by Bredon,and do
           you know OKS's
Dreid      driver which replaces SCSI.dr and mgr
AFL Dyfet  GA Montagne...you seem to have gotten in first :)
Montagne   I yield to Matt (since I was gonna ask for more info on the
           question)
Montagne   ga
Matt DTS   Bredon's mucking about with the SCSI.DRIVER was only for 4.0, and
           won't even do anything if you
Matt DTS   try to run it under 5.0, since SCSI.DRIVER doesn't exist under
           5.0.  The problems he addressed are not
Matt DTS   present in the SCSI Manager, which is a completely new set of
           code.  *I* am not familiar with the Ohio
Matt DTS   Kache loaded drivers.  GA.
AFL Dyfet  GA Ray...
Montagne   Just a general note... No driver should replace an existing driver
           unless
Montagne   the new driver identifies it's own hardware.  OKS' driver should
           not replace
Montagne   the driver supplied by Apple Computer, Inc. when using Apple's
           hardware. GA
Goalie5    What is the high order bit that was mentioned earlier and how will
           my older
Goalie5    (Sorry)
AFL Dyfet  I saw you sneaking in Goalie :)...The next question will be from
           II GS1, who
AFL Dyfet  lost his place earlier.  You have the floor now...
II GS1     Thanx :-) I just d/l the 5.0 version and I was wondering what
II GS1     Some of the major differences were.
II GS1     ga
AFL Dyfet  Perhaps Ray would most love to tell us about this one, having been
           so close to
AFL Dyfet  it's development :).  GA Ray :)
Montagne   Since no one else took it-File loading is up to 5 times faster
           when the
Montagne   file is changed to express format.  The AppleDisk3.5 driver
           performs I/O at
Montagne   twice the speed of 4.0 when doing large transfers (more than 4
           blocks), the
Montagne   SCSI driver(s) and manager increase I/O performance on SCSI
           devices by a factor
Montagne   of about 5.  And last, but certainly not least, Jim has improved
           the
JimMensch  We have added several new tools and enhanced others, see the
           discusion area for details. GA
AFL Dyfet  I bet Jim would love to tell us about the the tools :).  GA
           Jim...
Montagne   performance of Queeksdlaw by up to eight times.  GA
JimMensch  They are much faster.  (AndyBoy1 grabbed Mensches kbd)
AFL FrankD :)
JimMensch  sorry, but we changed so much that it would be a bad idea to go
           into it right now. We made some change
AFL Dyfet  I'm glad you were able to make it after all, Andy...albiet a
           little
JimMensch  ga
AFL Dyfet  indirectly :).  GA A2GS...
A2GS       You forgot to mention support for CDEV's :)
A2GS       Without getting into things to deeply.
A2GS       GA
AFL Dyfet  This is true, it would take very long to cover even in brief the
           changes made,
AFL Dyfet  so we will be going to the next question, from Sky Singer.  GA
           Sky...
SkySinger  2 questions. Are there any color printer drivers in GS/OS?  Any
           animation tools
SkySinger  now or planned?  GA.
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...
JimMensch  Yes, the imagewriter printer supports color (as does the driver)
           and no, no animation tools now,
JimMensch  as for later, you know better than that...... :)
AFL Dyfet  GA A2GS...
A2GS       Wouldn't mind seeing some 3-D tools :)
AFL Dyfet  I recall a number of cute 3-d drawing tools from the 'old' II days
           myself :)...
AFL Dyfet  in any case, I believe our next question is from AFL Tracy.  GA
           Tracy...
AFL TracyP I continually get questions in the Hardware Forum asking
           about...
AFL TracyP drivers for printers other than IWII and Epson.  Has or will
           Apple
AFL TracyP release info so that interested third prties can write drivers?
AFL TracyP ga
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   What?!
Matt DTS   Information on how to write third-party drivers has been out for
           more than a year!
Montagne   Geez Matt, Melow out!
Matt DTS   IIgs Technical Notes # 35 and 36.  I thought you were going to
           ask...
AFL TracyP Fine, how can someone obtain the aforementioned??
Matt DTS   ...if we were working on sample code, and that answer is yes. 
           Maybe not for source code sampler
Matt DTS   volume #2, but hopefully soon.  The TNs are available in the ADV
           library, right Dyfet?  <GA>
JimMensch  download em from here tracy
AFL TracyP Thanks, Matt, I'll pass it along. :))
AFL TracyP ga]
AFL Dyfet  I think we covered that question, and now I have one left over
           from the chaos
AFL Dyfet  at the very start of tonights conf.  Ray (or Jim/Matt), why is
           GS/OS now more
AFL Dyfet  sensative about unclaimed interrupts?
AFL Dyfet  GA Ray...
Montagne   I'm not sure why the change was made but it used to be like
           this... When an
Montagne   unclaimed interrupt occurred a counter was incremented.  If the
           interrupt
Montagne   was ever claimed, the counter was reset.  If the counter ever
           overflowed
Montagne   to 65536, the unclaimed interrupt message was displayed.  The
           counter 
Montagne   represented the number of consecutive unclaimed interrupts.  It is
           now
Montagne   cummulative.  Were looking into it but the dialog is indicating
           a
Montagne   condition that should not exist whether the counter is reset or
           not.GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach...
Coach101   The information I have says that the counter is checked at each
Coach101   interrupt but the behaviour is different.   I can only get the
           message
Coach101   at two different types of times...   When leaving ALPE or when a
           disk I/O
Coach101   is attempted....  Is it really susposed to be checked at each
           interrupt?
AFL Dyfet  GA Ray...
Montagne   It is only checked at interrupt time (the 65536th interrupt)GA
AFL Dyfet  I think I understand now.  Perhaps the 6551 is continually
           slamming the
AFL Dyfet  interrupt line until it's been told that the status register was
           read...if it
AFL Dyfet  is, it will certainly bump that count up VERY quickly during disk
           I/O, when the
AFL Dyfet  software is unable to service the poor chip.
Coach101   Thats a promising avenue....
AFL Dyfet  Either that, or the counter is jumping at more than a single
           increment...
AFL Dyfet  GA Ray...
Montagne   Not to likely.  The counter is incremented by the interrupt
           manager
Montagne   only when no handler has claimed it.  GA
Coach101   As a workaround how about a
AFL Dyfet  Okay, we can discuss this further in the boards, this looks like
           it will take
Coach101   CDA that uses a ProDos-16 type interrupt handler and just disposes
           of
AFL Dyfet  some time to figure out.  I believe the next question is from
           Goalie.  You have
Coach101   any interrupts that it gets....    Is that a feasible
           workaround?
Goalie5    What is the high order bit that was mentioned eariler and how do
           you make a
Goalie5    file express load format??
Goalie5    GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...
JimMensch  the High order bit we were talking about was in the high byte of
           the font handle in your grafports...
JimMensch  every handle has an extra byte at the top, which I used for
           internal flags. It is completly compatible
JimMensch  for older stuff.
JimMensch  and to express a file, you run express on it from APW, however I
           do not know if that is available yet.
JimMensch  maybe the dts guys know...
JimMensch  ga
Goalie5    Also, I have many programs written for system 4.0.
Goalie5    How will thsy run on 5.0??
Goalie5    ga
JimMensch  they will run just fine, but a little faster
JimMensch  ga
Montagne   Nevermind!
AFL Dyfet  GA A2GS...
Goalie5    Will any programming routines need to be changed on programs that
           I write??
Scotty AMS ...cancel my wuestion... thanks
A2GS       I've found in many programs that use the tools but don't follow
           all the
A2GS       guidelines, they don't purge memory and therefore may freeze or
           crash the
A2GS       system under 5.0!
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim....it seems these two are related :)
Goalie5    Also, what was APW,Jim??  Finder???
JimMensch  Not if you follow the rules in the toolbox ref manual goalie ga.
JimMensch  Goalie, its something you can buy from APDA.
JimMensch  ga
Goalie5    OK. Thanks.
Goalie5    Done.
AFL Dyfet  GA Ray...
Montagne   Thanks, nevermind!
AFL Dyfet  Ah...Okay, I believe our next question is from BRRCMAIL.  GA
           Brrc...
BRCCMAIL   I just read some info by Dave Leffler on adding new file types to
           Ftype.Main
BRCCMAIL   Is is okay for the end user to add a new Ftype file?
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   <grimacing AND whining all at the same time...>
Matt DTS   Please don't mess with Ftype.Main and FType.Aux.
Matt DTS   You are perfectly welcome to add your own FType file to the
           */Icons directory.
Matt DTS   You can have up to 30 of them, and the auxtype has to be greater
           than $0100.
Matt DTS   File type note for File Type $42 details the format (released in
           July; text format any day now, says
Matt DTS   Mark Johnson).  GA.
AFL Dyfet  (q -A2GS)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, our next question will be from the Gibber, who got misplaced
           in the que.
AFL Dyfet  GA Gibber.
A GibberFC I am currently working on drivers for the HP Deskwriter to work
           with the //gs
A GibberFC But the biggest work that I have ahead of me is the translation of
           the Semi-
A GibberFC OUtline fonts that the HP uses on the Mac.... I am wondering if
           there is a way
A GibberFC to make a new file that Quickdraw // will recognize as a "outline
           font" and 
A GibberFC allow the graphics capibility with the //gs... i.e. the scaling
           from 4 to 250
A GibberFC point with no Jaggies
A GibberFC ga
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...
JimMensch  Quickdraw does not recognize "outline fonts.." they must be
           standard bitmap fonts
JimMensch  so, you would have to create the font in the size you want and put
           it on the disk. GA
A GibberFC hmmm like a 250 point font that will can be shrunk down by the
           //gs?
A2GS       LOL
A GibberFC That will take up much hard drive space ;)
JimMensch  sure, but no matter how its scaled it will look bad. ga
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next question is from SkySinger.  GA Sky...
SkySinger  Could someone give a brief description of "resources" and how they
           operate? 
JimMensch  you have to have a file for each font if you want it to not look
           scaled...
JimMensch  resources are a seperate part of a standard file that contain data
           items that are identified by 
JimMensch  type and id. They are a way to manage standard system type data
           for programmers. The resource manager
JimMensch  acts as a type of data manager reading and writing them. GA
JimMensch  (andy) !
AFL Dyfet  GA Andy :)
JimMensch  The nice thing is that many of the tools know about resources. 
           For example, you could put the
JimMensch  data for a menu into a resource, and you could call NewMenu2 with
           just the ID of the resource,
JimMensch  and the menu manager will call the resource manager, load the
           data, build the menu, and
JimMensch  release the resource all in one step..   Pretty cool eh?   GA
SkySinger  Sounds good. Thanks. GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay, more information about resources may be found in the
           discussion area.  I
AFL Dyfet  believe the next question is from Dreid.  GA Dreid...
Dreid      I have found that when I view files in a window by date (vs icon)
           the bottom
Dreid      proportional scroll bar is not active even though I can't see
           everything
Dreid      normal?
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   Normal. Here's why:
Matt DTS   The Finder displays the headings ("Name", "kind", "Size", etc.) in
           the window's "information bar"
Matt DTS   which is a standard window part handled by the Window Manager. 
           The Information Bar doesn't scroll
Matt DTS   when the window does.  Therefore, scrolling the window makes the
           headings line up with the wrong
Matt DTS   columns, which we found to be confusing a significant, non-zero
           number of people.
Dreid      not nice if you want to check all changed files
Matt DTS   So now you grow the window to see more information.  (It's always
           been this way in the Mac Finder.)
Matt DTS   There's always trade-offs.  We opted this time to confuse fewer
           people.  GA.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe AFL Tracy is next.  GA Tracy...
AFL TracyP Why does Sys 5.0 seem so persnickety about certain modified
AFL TracyP Finder.Icons files?  A number of poeple have complained
AFL TracyP about their 5.0 disk crashing in mid-boot.  It seems
AFL TracyP to be traceable to a changed Finder.Icons file. 
AFL TracyP ga
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
AFL TracyP (it hasn't happened to me yet...:)
Matt DTS   (making up for earlier slacking) From Jim Merritt, the official
           Top Several list ...
Matt DTS   ...of Things You Can't Do to Finder.Icons:
Matt DTS   1.  Add new icons to it.
Matt DTS   2.  Change anything but the image of icons already in it.
Matt DTS   3.  Delete icons from it.
Matt DTS   Basically, Jim says the Finder makes assumptions about
           Finder.Icons, and doesn't like it if someone
Matt DTS   changed things around to make the assumptions fail.  The chief
           culprits are duplicate trash can or 
Matt DTS   "generic" icons (those which match any file).  Duplicates there
           make the Finder quite unhappy.
Matt DTS   Fortunately, you can add icons in separate files (not
           Finder.Icons) and the Finder will be happy.
Matt DTS   GA Ray.
Montagne   Besides, proper use of the installer prevents these problems. GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach...
AFL TracyP Hmmmm...those "rules" are certainly violable, though.
Coach101   Yes, but the Finder will crash with Icon files that were fine
           under 4.0
AFL TracyP I have a highly modified Finder.Icons file.  Why I haven't
AFL TracyP crashed like som others, I don't know....
Coach101   and are stored as new Icon files in the Icons folder.   Again, to
           the user
Coach101   this appears as a crash in mid-boot...    ga
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...
JimMensch  (andyboy)  a file which worked under 4.0 is not necessarily a
           "correct" file
JimMensch  That's just one of the rules of compatibility ..  GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
AFL TracyP (foloup ?, pls....)
Coach101   Ok...  But a bad Icon message is far preferable to a crash.... 
           done...
Matt DTS   Sometimes you can break the rules and not die.  We've all seen (or
           written) programs like that.
Matt DTS   That doesn't mean it won't happen soon, like as soon as your
           program with the bad icon file ships.
Matt DTS   :(
Matt DTS   Basically, since the Finder offers you a way to add as many icon
           files as you like, it's just plain
Matt DTS   easier to leave the Finder's files alone (except to change
           images).  And don't put non-file icons into
Matt DTS   separate files.  It's just a set of Finder restrictions we
           currently have.  GA Ray.
Montagne   It is also unreasonable that the system software will parse
           everything when
Montagne   performance is at risk.  We have to trust developers to follow the
           rules and
Montagne   sometimes when they don't - you have a bad day!  GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Tracy (With f/u Q)
Coach101   Good point....   
AFL TracyP I missed the answer to the ? about expressloada files.
AFL TracyP Are users capable of converting current files to ExpressLoad
AFL TracyP format, orwill those have to come from the publishers?
AFL TracyP ga
AFL Dyfet  Express is an APW utility (or will be)...GA Ray...
Montagne   They have to come from the publishers! Write'em and tell'em what
           you want.GA
AFA Parik  (retract Q)
AFL TracyP OK, thanks.  Sorry Parik...:)
AFL Dyfet  I gather there was some concern about users indiscriminently
           expressing on
AFL Dyfet  their own?
AFA Parik  (not my question, just forgot what I wanted to ask ;)
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...
JimMensch  Express on your own, but at your own risk. Some apps can not be
           expressed without rewrite and
JimMensch  the best people to decide if an application works as designed is
           the publisher. Some apps may fail if
JimMensch  expressed, and they may fail in wierd ways...
JimMensch  GA
JimMensch  (Andy went home...)
AFL Dyfet  I know that term, 'wierd ways' :)...um, I see that our next
           question is from
AFL Dyfet  Coach...GA...
Coach101   I am trying to scroll a window with my own vertical scroll
           bar....
Coach101   The action routine pointed to by my TrackControl call issues a
           ScrollRect
Coach101   call of the appropriate amount.  When my ContentDraw routine is
           entered
Coach101   I have and update region that is the entire content area of the
           window
Coach101   and a visible region that is nil (0,0,0,0).  Consequently, my draw
           routine
Coach101   does nothing....    What should I be doing?
Coach101   ga
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave...
Dave Lyons When your ContentDraw routine is entered, the update region
           doesn't mean anything in particular--
Dave Lyons but the VisRegion shouldn't be empty like that.  I dunno what's
           going on--Jim?
AFL Dyfet  Jim?  GA :)
JimMensch  Well, its like this
JimMensch  your content drawproc is called AFTER a call to begin update, so
           the update region is swapped with the
JimMensch  the vis region. If your update region was nil, then you have no
           vis region. Are you inval'ing the 
JimMensch  region scroll rect returns? scrollrect is part of quickdraw, and
           quickdraw don't know from update rgns
AFA Parik  t
JimMensch  I suspect that your update region is being set screwy. Are you
           changing the content origin?
JimMensch  ga
Coach101   Nope on the inval,   and that explains alll.......    Will
           change
Coach101   code this evening and retire for bed with a working routine....  
           AT LAST!
Coach101   THANKS THANKS THANKS
JimMensch  groovy, GA
Dave Lyons If you're not inval-ing anything, why is your content-draw
AFA Parik  (no, face mashing on keyboard)
Dave Lyons routine getting called at all, Coach?
Coach101   Ask Jim
Montagne   Next question!
Coach101   Or.....  The control changed its visible condition due to user
           interaction!
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next question is from A2GS...
A2GS       Can someone briefly explain the process, what happens when an app
           is
A2GS       'Expressed' and what allows it to run faster under 5.0 as opposed
           to 'regular'
A2GS       'UnExpressed' files?
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   Basically, Expressed files are "pre-processed" and pre-expanded in
           some ways...
Matt DTS   ...the System Loader reads through the file looking for some
           things, and Expressed files already have
Matt DTS   them recorded in the special "express" segment.  This avoids
           walking OMF records and speeds loading.
Matt DTS   More detail than we probably want to take on-line time for will be
           in a September Technical Note,
A2GS       thanx...Curious :)
Matt DTS   appropriately entitled "ExpressLoad Philosophy" (or "Speedy the
           Loader Helper", I can't remember.)
Matt DTS   GA.
A2GS       GA
Montagne   Just a note. An expressed file will still work with 4.0.
Montagne   ga
AFL Dyfet  Any further comments or questions?
AFL FrankD Good NOTE!  Thanks, Ray. :)
AFL FrankD What's a CDEV?
JSchober   Control Panel DEVice. :)
AFL Dyfet  GA A2GS...
A2GS       To my knowledge it's a file which handles a certain option among
           those
A2GS       available in the control panel (OA-ctrl-ESC), but is displayed and
           allows 
A2GS       access through the desktop too the control panel.
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...:)
A2GS       GA
Matt DTS   CDevs only affect the Control Panel NDA (through the pull-down
           Apple menu).  The text-based CDA
Matt DTS   Control Panel is not affected.  Specs will be published in
           September; File Type Note for type $C7.
Matt DTS   <GA>
AFA Parik  will expressed files work under system disk v3.2 and below?
           (sorry, a bit slow)
AFL FrankD Thanks!  Wondered about those little jewels. :)
Matt DTS   (parik:  Yes.  ProDOS 16 v1.2 or later is needed.)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, do we have any other takers for tonight?
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...
JimMensch  I have a question... What would people like to see added to the
           toolbox. New tools, new features ...
JimMensch  ga
AFL Dyfet  He asked....:)
Montagne   and the OS....
ShrinkIt   (I already sent in my list... :-)
AFL Dyfet  GA Scott...
AFA Gary J FST's
AFL Dyfet  High speed Apple supplied com drivers :)
JimMensch  not to me... :) (and I get to help chose)
AFL Scott  Palette Manager, More FST's(for the os)...Done.
Matt DTS   Jim:  DTS got Andy's list today.  We're working through it.  Be
           patient.  :)
JimMensch  FST's?? (A little vague...)
Doctor Why Concatonating prefixs or paths.
AFA Parik  Imagewriter LQ driver (full featured)
JSchober   HFS FST would be a good start... :)  <sorry, I'm kinda losing
           protocolishness.>
JimMensch  Pallette manager? to do what?
A2GS       More special FX tools like...3-D tools, fades etc... liven thins
           up! :)
AFL Dyfet  Let's take this slowly...one person at a time...
AFL Dyfet  GA Joe...you have the floor...
JimMensch  (I am recording...)
AFL Scott  Do what the mac thing does... only allowing dynamic allocation of
           palettes...
JSchober   OK... then, an HFS FST =would= be a good start, for the OS.  For
           tools... umm,
AFL Scott  such as when a user selects a different palette to work with, the
           SCBS are
JSchober   well, if you made 'em re-entrant, that'd help things tons.  :) 
           GA
AFL Scott  automatically updated for each line crossed. DONE
AFL Dyfet  I see both Scott and Joe got in there :)...GA Ray, I gather you
           wish to comment
AFL Dyfet  on some of this?
Montagne   Re-entrancy is not really an FST problem, it's a driver
           problem...
JSchober   Re-entrant tools, I meant.
Montagne   Most drivers are based heavily on firmware implementations such
           as
Montagne   BASIC, Pascal1.1, ProDOS, SmartPort or Extended SmartPort.  These
           firmware
Montagne   implementations are not re-entrant.  We could make the OS
           re-entrant but
Montagne   compatability would be almost non existant.  Not a good trade off!
           GA
JimMensch  got it, re-entrant tools, more fts's (vague) pallette manager
           (please send an explanation)
JimMensch  anyone else?
A2GS       Special FX tools of some kind, liven things up a bit, 3-D,
           Fades,
A2GS       color cycling, faster algorithms for filling, line drawing,
           etc...
Matt DTS   (horizontal scrolling in TextEdit.  Multiple rulers.  20x
           faster.)
JimMensch  Special effects, 3-d (as in rotations and such?) animation/screen
           manipulation.. anything else?
Doctor Why Concatonating prefixes or paths
A2GS       yep.
JimMensch  how 'bout 10x faster matt :)
Matt DTS   Fine.  Gotta start somewhere.
JimMensch  Concatinating prefixes? whats that?
ShrinkIt   (and not make it take a ton of memory, Jim... :-)
JimMensch  oh like 1/2/3 and stuff
AFA Gary J :)
A2GS       Nevermind my comment/question :)
AFL Dyfet  I think he means fancier calls for manipulating pathnames...
JimMensch  oh, ok...
Doctor Why It means that you can look for a file in a series of prefixes.
JimMensch  got it
JSchober   How 'bout the graphical equivalent of the TextEdit toolset??
AFA Parik  textedit = graphic i thought?
JimMensch  Like the textedit toolset on 5.0???
AFL Dyfet  Oh, I see Doctor Why....list searching...
JimMensch  or do you mean trhe text toolkit...
JSchober   No, I mean, one to ease the implementation of the basic graphic
           tools.
AFL Dyfet  GA RAY...
JimMensch  ok. Well thats a bunch for now!
Montagne   Good god! Don't use the Text Tool Set for anything!!!! 
Montagne   Other alternatives should be considered (lest we may not be able
           to
A2GS       That's what the desktop is for!
JimMensch  I will come back and ask again some times...
Montagne   provide dynamic slot switching, allowing all 14 slots to be
           used)GA
Matt DTS   Ray:  Mellow out!  :)
AFL Dyfet  I believe we have already had this long debate already in a folder
           (text tools)
Matt DTS   The Right Way will triumph in the end.
AFL Dyfet  and for now, I'd prefer to keep it there, before we get onto that
           impassioned
AFL Dyfet  subject for the rest of the night :)...
AFA Gary J :)
Montagne   Matt was waiting for that!
AFL Dyfet  I would like support of 'C' strings (char followed by /0) by GS/OS
           calls
AFL Dyfet  myself :)...Would make libraries for C easier to impliment :)
JimMensch  broader os string support. got it..
JoeM54     Is the forum to ask questions about the 5.0 system
AFL Dyfet  Yes it is, Joe, although our conference began at 10:00PM EST...
ShrinkIt   (we're suggesting improvements right now, joe... :-)
AFA Gary J I like the idea of a key-file/index toolset for indexing data in
           files. ;)
AFL Dyfet  You mean like Coach is sorta working on?  Actually, a GS/OS record
           manager
JimMensch  database/data indexing tool
Coach101   Have I got a deal for you Gary!
AFL Dyfet  would not be a bad idea :)
AFL FrankD Gotta run... sunrise comes earlier here than in California. :)
AFA Gary J Yes, Coach  :)
JSchober   Night Frank. :)
AFL FrankD Nice conference!  Thanks guys! :)
JoeM54     I have been experiencing some difficulties running applelink under
           5.0
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Frank.
AFL Dyfet  Here's one on my wishlist: Being able to hold open multiple
           handles to the same
AFL Dyfet  file....
Coach101   What do you mean?
Matt DTS   You can do that now, Dave.  They just all have to be read-only.
JimMensch  Dyfet, please mail lengthy descriptions to me...
AFL Dyfet  You can Matt!!!????  But ALL have to be read-only???
Matt DTS   (so different people, like an application and a DA, don't conflict
           over the same file.)
Matt DTS   (if the app wrote to a section of file the DA already read, how
           would the DA know?)
AFL Dyfet  I was thinking of several background inits for interesting things
           if shared
AFL Dyfet  file access were truelly possible...
Doctor Why I've got to run, thanks guys!
Matt DTS   If you can't open a file read-only, then someone else has it open
           with read-write permission.
A2GS       Would like sub-menus in pull down menus.
JimMensch  hierarchical menus got it (ugh)
Matt DTS   Use the Exerciser application and play around with it, Dave.
ShrinkIt   hierarchical menus?  Please, I vote no..
A2GS       Why?
JimMensch  thats 2 votes against... :)
ShrinkIt   Matt, tell 'em...
AFL Dyfet  I will Matt...
Matt DTS   They're a good excuse for poor human interface.
JoeM54     yes i am using an internal modem 
JimMensch  Not enough screen realestate a2gs... I wish we could take them
           back on the mac side...
Matt DTS   They make simple choices hard to access and make finding menu
           choices sometimes impossible.
AFL Scott  Tear off menus.
Matt DTS   Imagine trying to change fonts in a program with no ChooseFont
           dialog and a hierarchical font menu.
Matt DTS   (and a lot of fonts.  You'd be imagining PowerPoint on the Mac. 
           Ick.)
A2GS       Good point...could only be used for really simple/obvious menus.
JimMensch  Tear off menus, right
Matt DTS   (I could go on and on.)
Matt DTS   (And often do.)
JimMensch  please don't, he gets the point
ShrinkIt   Tear-Offs would be nice... :-)
AFL Dyfet  I believe Jim noted that :)
AFL Scott  If it was suggested before... I missed it due to
           E-Mail/FN's..Sorry. 
AFA Parik  when a program quits and is *NOT* restartable, what is done with
           the actual
AFA Parik  program ram?  That is, where in memory the program resided.  for
           some reason
AFA Parik  it won't disappear from RAM and my RAm keeps shrinking...ugh
AFA Parik  (and its NOT restartable)
JimMensch  It is empty waiting with open arms for new data parik
Matt DTS   It's released to the system, Parik.  Any memory it allocated with
           a different userID won't, however,
Dave Lyons When a program quits and isn't restartable, GQUIT calls
           UserShutdown, and all the memory with
Matt DTS   be automatically disposed of.  The application has to do that.
Dave Lyons the program's memory ID gets disposed of.  If you're losing
           memory, it sounds like the
JimMensch  Parik, you may be using the wrong ID when allocating memory, check
           with memory peeker or mangler
Dave Lyons program is allocating some memory with a different memory ID (by
           accident?  for some reason?).
AFA Parik  its nice having bunch of Apple folks.  :)  thanks, will check.
JimMensch  hmmmm .... these all sound alike... 
Matt DTS   (the preceding three answers were a graphic illustration of the
           Evils of Poor Interleave.)
Dave Lyons (Did anybody compute the interleave factor for those last answers?
           :)
AFL FrankD Looks fine to me, just have to get used to reading it. :)
AFL FrankD 1:3 Dave. :)
Dave Lyons (Parik...gee, I wish I could think of a good utility you could use
           to examine memory and
Dave Lyons see what's going on....)
JimMensch  if no other comments I think I will head out...
Montagne   I think I'll reassign some blocks!
A2GS       Why does 5.0 load certain portions of itself into scattered banks
           in memory,...
Dave Lyons "Scattered banks"??
AFL Dyfet  GA Ray...
A2GS       why not just purge all of memory so the next app which is run
           doesn't have to
A2GS       worry?
Matt DTS   DAs might not like that.
Montagne   Historically, the operating system only resided in language card
           areas
JimMensch  inits might not either
Dave Lyons Purge all of *what* memory when, A2GS?  The Memory Manager
           supports some pretty neat
Montagne   and certain portions of bank $00.  As additional features have
           been added
Dave Lyons ideas to keep from wasting your time--things can stay in RAM and
           be re-used if they're
Matt DTS   Or INITs.  Or resources loaded and released.
A2GS       thanx.  That answers my ?
Dave Lyons needed later & you didn't need the memory anyway in the
           meantime.
Montagne   such as high performance drivers and FST's, these have had to be
           loaded into
AFA Parik  bye Jim.  THANK YOU a lot for being so supportive of II.  
Montagne   managed memory since their just was not sufficient real estate in
           the 
Coach101   Good night Jim.... Thanks for the help....
Montagne   language card areas (plus bank $E0 and $E1 are slow). GA
AFL Dyfet  Have a good evening, Jim!! (that is, if you do manage to escape
           here :)
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Jim.  Thanks for coming tonight.
AFA Gary J :)
A2GS       Wasn't thinking of using the language card!?
Montagne   Meaning?
A2GS       Banks 05 and up.
Montagne   Didn't I mention use of managed memory in my answer? GA
A2GS       Yup, but seemed to also keep referring to the LC which really has
           no use now
A2GS       except to retain compatibility.
Dave Lyons No use?  It's used by the system.
Montagne   My reference was only to show that there was not sufficient real
           estate 
Dave Lyons (And compatibility is important!)
A2GS       But, wouldn't be necessary had the GS's predecessors not used
           it.
Montagne   to cram the system software into the language cards (who would
           want to with
Montagne   the slower performance) so many components are in managed memory
           where
A2GS       uderstood :)
Montagne    there is space for them and they run faster. GA
A2GS       Never questioned that :)
Montagne   Any more???
Montagne   Gonna check out.  See y'all later.
AFL Dyfet  Okay Ray, you have a good evening :)
