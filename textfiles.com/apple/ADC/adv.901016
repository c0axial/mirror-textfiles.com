Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar  (AFL Dyfet)

AFL Dyfet  Okay, I guess we are ready to get started...:)...What do you wish
           to know about
AFL Dyfet  Shanoj?
ShanoJ     Anyone here have any Scheduler experience? It's really beginning
           to annoy me.:(
ShanoJ     Well, I need to use the Scheduler for Twilight, and it just
           doesn't seem to
ShanoJ     work for some people... :( I call _SchAddTask, after checking to
           make sure the
ShanoJ     busy flag IS set, and the task never gets called!! :(
WinkieJim  Shano, BTW, Twilite disables my keyboard from working :)
ShanoJ     Well, the next version of Twilight (due out for the Twilight Time
           contest) 
ShanoJ     should fix ALL of those problems. Thing is, unless I can figure
           out what's up
ShanoJ     with the Scheduler, it STILL isn't going to be able to save the
           screen on some
ShanoJ     people's GS's.... :(
Function   Does anyone have any source code for cataloging a disk under
           GS/OS?
A2GS       No....but I can get some to you...
Function   That would be great if you could.
WinkieJim  Function, all you have to do is use the GEtDirEntry function to
           get the
WinkieJim  files in any directory
Function   Yeah, I know how and have even done it.  I just need to make some
           things work
WinkieJim  where are you having problems?
Function   I need to print all of the info to the screen using the console
           driver.  The
Function   console driver is not the problem either.
Function   Whenever I try to print stuff to the screen it comes out as
           control chars
WinkieJim  inverse you mean? 
Function   yeah
WinkieJim  Well the filenames and pathnames GS/OS gives, has the high bit
           clear.
Dave Lyons (Not necessarily!  Standard legible characters have their high
           bits clear, but high-ascii is
Dave Lyons permissible in some file systems, like AppleShare.)
WinkieJim  Ok, well standard ProDOS names then. 
Function   I can print the names fine, just not the blocks, filenames and
           mod/creation dat
WinkieJim  you either want to try setting the high bit or set the output
           filter to do it 
WinkieJim  for you.
AFA Gary J You're using GetDirEntry, right Function?  
Function   yes
AFA Gary J Are you converting the mod/creation date, etc. to ASCII
           characters before 
AFA Gary J trying to print them?  (Function)
Function   no.  I have no idea how
AFA Gary J That's why they're inverse, etc. then.
Function   I know.  I just don't know what to do
WinkieJim  First byte= Seconds
WinkieJim  2=Minutes
WinkieJim  3=Hour
WinkieJim  4=Year
WinkieJim  5=day
WinkieJim  6=month
WinkieJim  7=null
WinkieJim  8=weekday
WinkieJim  just turn it in the appropriate number or word (month 1= January
           12 Dec...)
AFA Gary J Most of the dir info stuff comes back as pure hex values.  Some
           things like
AFA Gary J dates/time is in a format like WinkieJim is displaying :)
AFA Gary J You can use the Integer Math toolset to do the conversion to
           ASCII for you.

WinkieJim  Ok big question for you all:
WinkieJim  I have a NDA with a menu bar in it's info bar.
WinkieJim  The menus come from resources.
WinkieJim  When I resize the window or move some thing in front of it (not
           when I move it
WinkieJim  around the screen) it will freeze at the DrawMenu call.
WinkieJim  The resource file is available (I know this due to NL 3.0 :)
WinkieJim  (before when the rescource file wasn;'t avail it would crash, but
           now it freezes up)
WinkieJim  I've followed TEch Note #3 to the letter and still can't see where
           it is
WinkieJim  messing up.
Dave Lyons WJ, how do you know it's available *during* the info bar draw
           call?
Dave Lyons You *do* have to do the Get/SetCurResourceApp bit in your info bar
           defproc.
WinkieJim  I call SetResourceApp with my user ID in the info bar defProc. 
WinkieJim  I also put a break in just before the DrawMenu call and went to NL
           and saw
WinkieJim  the resource file was available.
Dave Lyons Oh, okay.  How 'bout the port?  Did you do a SetPort to anything? 
           I believe DrawMenu/etc will
Dave Lyons toast if the current port is invalid.
WinkieJim  And as I said, it will work if I don't cover the menu bar with
           something else
WinkieJim  or resize the window
WinkieJim  Wouldn't a call to set the window's port in a info draw cause
           problems?
WinkieJim  (i.e. doesn't the window manager call StartInfoDraw and doesn't
           that set the
WinkieJim  current port corectly?
Dave Lyons (Good point...I think you're right)
WinkieJim  (TechNote #3 doesn't do any port setting)
AFA JoeyS  (technotes can't set ports)
WinkieJim  Ha Ha Joey  :)
Dave Lyons Still, check in Nifty List right before it fries & see what the
           port is set to (it's probably the
Dave Lyons window manager's port, which should be okay).
WinkieJim  :) Tech nbote #3 states: Do not switch to the windows port for
           drawing :)
WinkieJim  The things that gets me is that it doesn't freze if I just move
           the window a 
WinkieJim  little around the screen.
Dave Lyons WJ, if you just move the window around it's just copying the
           picture of your window, not calling
Dave Lyons your info bar defproc or content defproc to draw anything.
WinkieJim  But will if I resize the window or move it so the info bar is
           obscured by 
WinkieJim  something.
WinkieJim  that' pretty much what I assumed, but it still leaves with me
           wondering, why?
WinkieJim  :/
WinkieJim  I don't suppose adding menu items to the bar after creating it
           would cause 
WinkieJim  problems?
Matt DTS   (To the bar, yes.  To menus in the bar, no.  :)
WinkieJim  nope the menu titles remain the same...I just add menu items to
           the end of two
Dave Lyons Does your menu pull down okay?
WinkieJim  of the menus and call calc menu size right after.
WinkieJim  It pulls down, selects and works perfectly otherwise.
Dave Lyons And the newly-added items are in there, right?
WinkieJim  Yup. (originaly off the menu area until I figured out to call
           CalcMenuSize, but
WinkieJim  they are there and work perfectly.)
Dave Lyons I dunno...send me the object & I'll see what I can do.
WinkieJim  Thanks, dave. I'll get it out asap. dang thing is driveing me
           batty and is 
WinkieJim  preventing me from going to beta test stage.
AFA Gary J Programming environments tonight...uh.. let's see.  Anyone here
           using the
AFA Gary J MAX/Edit editor?
AFA Gary J I actually like the Orca editor well enough, but I need the
           ability to edit
AFA Gary J more than one file at a time (and it would also be nice to be
           able to edit
AFA Gary J files > 64K).  Would MAX/Edit be overkill for such miniscule
           wants?
Matt DTS   I have a problem with MAX/Edit (and it's ancestor, the SDE editor)
           in that...
Matt DTS   ...it uses new user IDs for each file it edits and does NOT
           dispose of them when you quit the editor.
Matt DTS   This is how it does the "You can switch from Merlin to APW with
           your files intact" bit.  The memory is
Matt DTS   not purgeable, either.
AFA Gary J Hmmm.  That's not good.
Matt DTS   If keeping files in memory is really that important to you, this
           is the way to do it, but I'd rather
Matt DTS   use the memory in my current application and do a bit of disk
           access when I reenter the editor instead
Matt DTS   of having to explictly unload files I'm editing before quitting to
           free their memory.
Matt DTS   GA.
AFA Gary J I'm not really concerned about the source staying in memory.  I
           just want to
AFA Gary J switch between multiple files while editing.  <done>
AFL Dyfet  Okay, who wishes to inject a new question at this point??
ShanoJ     APW 2.0? ZapLink?
AFL Dyfet  Go ahead Jonah...
ShanoJ     Welp, does anyone know how APW 2.0 is coming along, and whether
           there are plans
ShanoJ     to add the ability to set the OMF bits with ZapLink?
AFA Gary J That would be a nice addition, Jonah.
ShanoJ     Hell, that would be a NECESSARY addition. With all of the 3200
           color stuff I
ShanoJ     do, ZapLink is basically useless to me without it. :(
AFA Gary J Must be bank aligned, etc., eh?
DVS Softwr Would my OMF program in the libraries do the trick?
ShanoJ     Actually, it's the nospecial bit that's important. I need to get a
           lot of $01
ShanoJ     space, and I can't have my program loaded there... :(
AFA Gary J Your OMF program sets the KIND field, correct?
DVS Softwr what does he need?
ShanoJ     Dunno, DVS, what does your program do (I haven't seen it, sorry...
           :)
AFA Gary J That would work for you then, Jonah.  That's in the KIND field.
AFA Gary J Jonah, do you really have trouble with your program trying to
           grab $01 if you
AFA Gary J don't set the KIND field to not load in $01?
ShanoJ     Well, I do SOMETIMES. It shouldn't be a problem much, because it
           tries to grab
ShanoJ     $012000, which should be pretty much reserved for QDII Shadowing,
           but I thought
ShanoJ     I should be safe and make sure that it can't be loaded there....
AFA Gary J Is your program an EXE file or a S16 file (when you're developing
           it)?
ShanoJ     S16. Has to be, or else APW uses that memory and I'm screwed. :(
AFA Gary J Yes.
AFA Gary J I was just wondering.  I have some programs that use $012000, and
           as long as
AFA Gary J they're S16 files, I don't have trouble with them trying to
           reside in $01.  But
AFA Gary J the main segment is rather large.  That probably makes a
           difference.
ShanoJ     Matt, Dave, what's the official position on that? If you HAVE to
           use the
ShanoJ     $012000 space, should you set the nospecial bit in the KIND field,
           or is that
ShanoJ     only extra work?
WinkieJim  If you don't set it does it usaly load there?
AFA Gary J I would tend to want to do it before releasing the program upon
           the world, just
AFA Gary J to be safe.
WinkieJim  gary...that's what I was just thinking of :)
Matt DTS   If you "have" to use any specific address, you have to be prepared
           that you can't get it.
Matt DTS   Just because you didn't load there doesn't mean that some DA or
           INIT didn't.  You can try for it
Matt DTS   but you have to handle it gracefully if you can't get it.
AFA Gary J What, Matt??  No SysFailMgr call?  :)
WinkieJim  I usually just crash into the monitor...no system errs for me :)
Dave Lyons I believe when GQUIT loads applications it asks the loader *not*
           to use special memory--and then if
Dave Lyons that fails it trying loading again, with no restrictions.
ShanoJ     Ya, but the $012000 space should be fairly safe, as if a DA or INIT
           was loaded
ShanoJ     there, P8 is screwed, too...
Matt DTS   Maybe no one's tried to launch P8 on that system in a while.  Be
           prepared for when you can't get it.
Dave Lyons Properly-loaded DAs don't have code in special memory--but they
           might allocate non-special memory,
Dave Lyons so grab $012000 before you call DeskStartUp.
ShanoJ     Heh, I actually AM prepared, Matt! For once in my life I checked
           for a valid
ShanoJ     handle. See, I'm learning. Slowly but surely... :)
AFA Gary J I have a CDA that does NOTHING but grab $012000, just so I can
           test my 
AFA Gary J software :)
AFA Gary J (It's also fun to see how other software products handle the
           situation too :)

ShanoJ     Anyone have any thoughts on how to display 3200 color pictures
           from an NDA?
ShanoJ     I need to shut down all of the interrupt sources, but that's a
           no-no when the
ShanoJ     main program isn't the one doing it.... :(
Matt DTS   Jonah:  There are some tasks desk accessories should just leave
           alone.

ShanoJ     Does Prizm work well/reliably for anyone here?
AFL Dyfet  (I don't use Prizm myself..prefer the shell)
AFA Gary J (same here)
ShanoJ     Ya, me too. That's why. :(
AFL Scott  Prizm is very unreliable, IMHO. I have it crash or trash the
           target volume 
AFL Scott  regularly.
AFL Dyfet  I never found problems with Prizm simply because I never really
           used it :)
AFA Gary J (trash the target volume?  ugh.  That's serious)
AFL Dyfet  I had to re-construct my hd recently, Scott...What a pain :(...
AFL Scott  (that's why I don't use it! :))
ShanoJ     Ya, I had it erase source files, refuse to compile stuff, etc,
           etc, etc.
ShanoJ     Too bad, too, it COULD be really nice. :(

Nuzz       is it too late for a question?
AFL Dyfet  No Nuzz...ga...
Nuzz       I'd like to know how GSOS formats the Text in the ClipBoard
           window
Dave Lyons Well, GS/OS doesn't have anything to do with the clipboard.
Dave Lyons Are you asking about the Finder's "Show Clipboard" window?
Nuzz       Yes, finder, sorry
Dave Lyons I believe it just calls LETextBox2 with all the text, and with a
           rectangle the width of
Dave Lyons the Clipboard window.  LETextBox2 is doing the word wrapping.
Nuzz       is Scrap type 64 a line edit scrap?
Dave Lyons Scrap type $0064 is Text Edit style information--goes along with a
           Text scrap.
Nuzz       If there is style info, does the finder use this when showing
           clipboard?
Dave Lyons Nope, the Finder only uses the Text and Picture scraps ($0000 and
           $0001).
Nuzz       Dave, just so I have it straight, you're saying that Finder will
           word wrap to
Nuzz       the size of the window (Horz), irregeardless of how the text was
           "cut"
Nuzz       <bad spelling>
Dave Lyons Yes, I think that's what it does.  Carriage returns still force
           new lines, but so does wrapping.
Nuzz       Hmm, I've cut some TextEdit stuff and the finder seems to respect
           the original
Nuzz       word wrap.
Nuzz       <without a CR>
WinkieJim  it might just be luck...
WinkieJim  (i.e. both windows the same width)
Nuzz       Nope, the TE lines are much narrower than the Clip window
Dave Lyons Are there any carriage returns in the text you cut?
Nuzz       Not on all lines
Nuzz       I looked at the lines in question and there are no CR's at the
           wrap point
Nuzz       yet the clip window is just as the TE
Dave Lyons Looked at the text in Text Edit, or the $0000 Scrap on the
           clipboard?
Nuzz       The $0 Scrap type
Nuzz       I looked at it with NL
Dave Lyons That's strange.  I'm sure it's not using the $64 scrap...the
           Finder doesn't even start up TE.
Nuzz       I am trying to duplicate this. 
Nuzz       Right now, MY Clipview window only wraps at CR's. Cuts off words
           that are wider
Nuzz       than the window
Dave Lyons I just tried it (Copy from a Text Edit control) and it shows up
           with no wrapping in the Finder.
Dave Lyons (Oops, I take back the part about the Finder using the *current*
           width of the Clipboard window--
Dave Lyons it seems to have a hard-coded width.)
Nuzz       I'll try it again, and get back to you on it Dave. Thanks for the
           help

WinkieJim  SPeaking of LETExtBox...anyone know how to find out how high in
           pixels the text
WinkieJim  in a LETextBox2 is? 
Dave Lyons WJ, I don't know of a way (that would be too easy).
WinkieJim  :/
Dave Lyons If you have a *lot* of text, I don't recommend using LETextBox/2
           anyway--they aren't very fast.
WinkieJim  I hate to have to have a super long vertical data area with only
           2 lines of
WinkieJim  text :)
Dave Lyons You don't *have* to, WJ...look at the Macintosh Finder's
           solution--the scroll bars are never active!
Dave Lyons (Good solution, eh?)
WinkieJim  I know I don't have to and don't want to, but if I can't find the
           length of
WinkieJim  a LETextBox2..I have no choice
WinkieJim  because the information displayed can be almost anylength (well up
           to $FFFF)
WinkieJim  and with word wrapping it could end up anywhere in hight.
Dave Lyons I don't think the height can exceed $3fff, or QD would crash.
WinkieJim  ($FFFF in size of the text data)
Dave Lyons (By the way, don't call LETextBox with length=0.  It'll toast on
           you.)
WinkieJim  I'll put a check in for that one...
