APPLE II DEVELOPMENT FORUM CONFERENCE LOG
Tuesday, February 5, 1991  10:00 p.m. Eastern Time
Topic:  Special Guest Jay Jennings from 8/16 Journal
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar  (AFL Dyfet)


AFL Dyfet  Okay, I guess we can get started....good evening everyone and
AFL Dyfet  welcome to the Apple II Development Forum.  Tonight we will be
AFL Dyfet  discussing technical publications, and our guest will be Jay
           Jennings
AFL Dyfet  from the 8/16 Journal.  We will be using protocol tonight, so
AFL Dyfet  please bare with us.  I would now like to give Jay a chance to
AFL Dyfet  introduce himself and tell us about 8/16.  Go ahead Jay, you
           have
AFL Dyfet  the floor now....
JJennings  Thanks. I'll make it short and sweet (kind of)...
JJennings  I've been programming computers for about six years and working
           for A2-Central for a little over a...
JJennings  ...year. Last fall we had a chance to acquire 8/16 from Ariel
           Publishing. After a little...
JJennings  ...discussion we decided to go for it. My job changed and now I
           have no more free time. :) ...
JJennings  8/16-Central is a disk-based publicatin that's dedicated to
           serving Apple II programmers...
JJennings  ...and developers. We publish articles, source code, utilities,
           and anything else of...
JJennings  ...interest to the people programming the Apple II.
JJennings  Umm...what else would you like to know? :)
AFL Dyfet  I guess that was an opening for a question :)...GA Marty :)
AFL Marty  Why did you decide to use HyperStudio as the means of
           distribution?
AFL Marty  (I didn't phrase that right... make the right question out of it
           and
AFL Marty  answer it. :)
JJennings  Because text files on a disk are BORING and UGLY and NO FUN. With
           a cool front-end, on the..
JJennings  ...other hand, we can have something that at least _appears_ to be
           a magazine. I started out...
JJennings  ...writing a front-end fro scratch. Then realized (thank God!)
           that HS would do almost...
JJennings  ...everything I wanted it to. Yes, it's only good for the 16-bit
           people, but...
JJennings  ...we're working on an 8-bit front-end, too. ga
AFL Dyfet  Ga Marty :)
AFL Marty  Who writes your articles?  Are you looking for more authors?
JJennings  Everybody, and yes. I try to write one every once in a while so I
           don't go over budget (yes, we
JJennings  pay for submissions), but most articles are from outseide
           authors.
JJennings  Oh, wait...
JJennings  I have a backlog of IIgs stuff right now. I have enough articles
           for the next few issues...
JJennings  ...except for 8-bit stuff. Nobody wants to write it anymore! :(
AFL Dyfet  Okay, ga now Winkie :)
WinkieJim  The last issue of 8/16 had the 8-bit front end on it...
WinkieJim  GA That's my comment...
JJennings  Lemme respond to the comment...
WinkieJim  (of course it crashed on my GS :) :)
JJennings  That's an interim front-end. I'm looking for one that acts like
           HS. A dedicated 8/16 front-end. GA
WinkieJim  ah...
JJennings  (You must have a weird GS. Karl Bunker doesn't write stuff that
           crashes! :)
WinkieJim  It was a neat crash...very fun to watch :)
WinkieJim  ga
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Windrider has the next question...Go ahead Wind...
Windrider5 What is the ratio of 8 to 16 in terms of coverage and readership
           interest?
JJennings  Darn good question! Darn good. And the answer is...
JJennings  ...I dunno.
JJennings  (more...)
JJennings  The articles are running about 70/30 in each issue (in favor of GS
           stuff) simply because...
JJennings  ...all the new stuff (mostly) is happening on the IIgs. We have 2
           GS articles and 2 8-bit...
JJennings  ...articles per issue. But HyperLab is only for the IIgs, most of
           the letters are about the IIgs,...
JJennings  ...the Online columns are mainly GS stuff. Because that's what
           people are talking about.
JJennings  But I'm trying to put more 8-bit stuff on there. It seems like it
           gets harder every month to find it..
JJennings  ...though.
JJennings  As far as the subscribers go, we're doing a survey in April and
           we'll see what comes of that. GA
JJennings  (See what the ratio of 8 to 16-bit people is, I mean. GA)
ShanoJ     <-- 16 bit person... :)
AFL Dyfet  Hmm...that would be an interesting survey :)....Okay, would anyone
           else wish
A2Evanglst <--- 2 bit person ;)
AFL Dyfet  to ask our guest a question?
AFL Marty  What kind of 8-bit articles are you looking for?  Maybe someone
           reading the
AFL Marty  transcript will submit something if they have something specific
           to aim at.
AFL Marty  GA
AFL Dyfet  Maybe, Marty ;)
JJennings  Gee, thanks, Marty. Back when I was a freelance programmer I could
           never think of...
JJennings  ...what to write. Now that I'm an editor people are asking and I'm
           supposed to know! :) ...
AFL Marty  Yeah but you get the big bucks now. :)
JJennings  I don't have anything specific in mind. Basically, all the
           articles we run should have something...
JJennings  ...in common. That is, they should explain a programming
           technique, show how to do something...
JJennings  ...that maybe a little tricky, etc. If you write programs you
           probably butt heads with problems...
JJennings  ...all the time. When you come up with a creative solution, write
           an article about it! ...
JJennings  There are probably others out there running into the same problems
           and if you can help them get...
JJennings  ...over the hump, we all benefit with better software. GA
JJennings  Big bucks? Hahahahahah! Good one! :-P
AFL Marty  Thanks... done.
ShanoJ     Make sure you ask DTS about your 'creative solutions' before you
           write the
ShanoJ     article... They never seem to like mine... :)
ShanoJ     Guess I'm just too creative... :)
JJennings  Well...I've been yelled at by DTS before - and I'm sure it'll
           happen in the future. Send them...
JJennings  ...anyway and we'll chance it. :) GA
AFA Gary J Controversy sells :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, do we have any more questions for Jay while we have him here
           tonight?
AFL SandyB If it isn't confidential information, how much DO you pay for an
           article...
AFL SandyB (Marty, he sweeps his carpeting cause he doesn't have a vacuum, he
           doesn't
AFL SandyB get paid enough yet, :)) GA
JJennings  Hey, no secrets!
AFL SandyB :)
AFL Marty  (what's carpeting? :)
AFL SandyB LOLOL
JJennings  We pay anywhere from $50 to $100 for an article. Most go for about
           $75. No, you won't...
JJennings  ...get rich, but yo'll be famous and chicks will _swarm_ over
           you!!! (yeah, I'm still...
JJennings  ...waiting for that one to happen, too). GA
AFL Marty  chicks?? :)
AFL Dyfet  GA Sandy...
AFL SandyB If you lived here I'm sure our local APPLE // user group would
           love to have
AFL SandyB you come in and show what 8/16 is and how you put one
           together...if 8 bit
AFL SandyB programmers are difficult to find (and I'm sure they're out there)
           why 
AFL SandyB don't you all get the User Group list and send out a call for
           those
AFL SandyB programming in 8 bit? 
JJennings  Local UG list? The chances of finding 8-bit programmers in KC are
           a bit slim...
JJennings  ...but it's a thought. Hmmm...a UG demo. Cool idea. :) GA
AFL SandyB No, I meant get Apple's user group list
AFL SandyB and send out something saying what 8/16 is and why programmers
           are
AFL SandyB essential to its success...
JJennings  Okay, Apple also has a developer list. But they want MUCHO bucks
           for it I think. And we're...
JJennings  ...still small potatoes. But again, that's a good idea. I might
           throw that past Tom W.
JJennings  Yeah...
AFL SandyB Apple's off the mark if they don't kiss the ground A2 walks on,
           :).
JJennings  ...we haven't done ANY marketing of 8/16-Central yet, and when we
           do we'll include a call for...
JJennings  ...articles. GA
AFA Gary J Just curious, but what distinguishes a $100 article from a $50
           one? 
AFL Marty  $50 :)
JJennings  Hehehh!
AFL SandyB Hahahaha
AFA Gary J Marty :)
JJennings  It depends on whether you send me any cookies along with the
           article.
AFA Gary J (I should have known that would come from you :)
Apple24evr Yeah... I was wondering, also...
AFA Gary J Is it word count?  Or..
AFA Gary J technical expertise?  Or what?
JJennings  That, and it depends on the length and complexity of it. If I
           could crank out a similar...
JJennings  ...article in a couple hours, it'll go to the lower end. But if I
           look at it and say, "Kewl!", than...
JJennings  ...it goes to the higher end. GA
AFA Gary J Ok, thanks :)
A2GS       What kind of articles are you looking for?
JJennings  In the last couple issues we've done stuff on 3200 color pics,
           custom controls (March issue - that...
JJennings  ...was done today), SFGet in C, menus and windows in 8-bit, etc.
           That's typical of what we're...
JJennings  ...looking for.
JJennings  It doesn't have to be a big application or utility. Just a good
           explanation of something that might...
JJennings  ...confuse the average programmer. Like an explanation of how to
           use CopyPixels (coming...
JJennings  ...in the March issue). GA
A2GS       What kind of 3200 color stuff did you already discuss....I've got
           a couple
A2GS       of things that I might be able to add.
JJennings  Basically a way to display 3200 color pics. Source code, a
           linkable routine, and an explanation of...
JJennings  ...what's happening in the program. That's what we ran. I'd be
           interested in associated subjects.
AFL Dyfet  Go ahead Sandy....
AFL SandyB There's a pirate board around where 8/16 issues are up with the
           biggest and
AFL SandyB the best of all A2 software. Is that flattering or does that make
           you angry?
JJennings  Officially or unofficially? :)
AFL SandyB That's enough answer, :).
JJennings  No, I have another answer...
JJennings  ...no, I guess I don't. I'll get in trouble. :) GA
AFL Dyfet  That's okay Jay :)
JJennings  Answer: Don't pirate it! If you can't pay for it, tell me and
           we'll make a deal with you. GA
AFL Marty  (Was it something like "pirates suck pond scum"?)
AFA Gary J 15 cents per copy?  :)
AFA Gary J (or whatever the Open-Apple deal used to be :)
JJennings  (Not quite, Gary. Good try. :)
Barbarian6 So what is the topic tonight?
AFL Dyfet  Technical Publications, Barbarian, and Jay Jennings, from 8/16
           Journal is our
AFL Dyfet  guest tonight....
A2GS       Barbarian?
Barbarian6 yes
A2GS       oh...Barbarian  :-)  (not the game??)
AFL Dyfet  GO Sandy
AFL SandyB If A2 Central is the umbrella technical Apple // publication/
AFL SandyB organization in the country/world, how come we don't see A2's
           presence
AFL SandyB more on America Online? Is A2's profit in GEnie?
JJennings  Ooooh!
Apple24evr Hehe
JWankerl   I'd like to point out that GS+ also publishes tech info - 8/16
           isn't alone.
ShanoJ     (and GS+ is in paper, too... <poke, poke> :)
JJennings  Okay, here goes...
JJennings  ...as the A2 Round Table "big wigs", we have a free account on
           GEnie. We don't have to worry...
JJennings  ...about racking up Tom's VISA card (he yelled at me last month
           for my online time!)...
JWankerl   ShanoJ:  Paper AND disk.  They compliment each other.
JJennings  ...but we are here now, and will stay. Just not as visible as on
           GEnie...which kind of makes...
JJennings  ...sense, if you think about it. :) GA
JJennings  Yeah, paper's cool.
Mac Hater  why can't you get a IC account like Incider.
JJennings  Free advertising: Subscribe to GS+.
JJennings  sniff whine. Because I don't know how, Mac Hater. :) Besides...
JJennings  ...I almost live online as it is. I don't know if I could take
           anymore at this point. :) GA
A2GS       What the advantage of having an IC account (what is it anyways?)
Mac Hater  Free hours.  :-)  Its the Industry Connection
           (Broderbund,AE,etc,etc)
Mac Hater  Ross setup a IC for his Mac thingie
JJennings  We haven't looked into that yet. I don't know if it's a
           possibility or not to tell you the truth.
AFL Dyfet  Okay. go ahead, Apple24evr....
Apple24evr Thanks... what's the difference in $$$ between an article with a
           program and without? GA
JJennings  You get almost diddly for an article without source and a program.
           Unless you're real special...
JJennings  ...and send me some cookies.
AFL Dyfet  Probably chocolate chip or you get nothing :)
AFA Gary J (silicon cookies?)
Apple24evr Cookies, huh? What kind, specifically? GA
AFL Marty  (ahem... I have a copyright on the term "diddly" :)
AFA Gary J LOL!
JJennings  We don't - for the most part - run articles without source code.
           That's what's cool about a...
JJennings  ...disk-based publication. We can have teh source and executable
           file right there for you to play...
JJennings  ...with. GA
JJennings  I'm partial to ginger cookies - if they're soft. Chocolate chip
           are cool, too. GA
AFL Dyfet  No mess with mistyped listing or software that wasn't really
           debugged before
AFL Dyfet  publication :)...
Apple24evr Ok---almost done...
A2GS       No offense...I prefered the old paper issues :(
JJennings  Ginger cookies with cold milk (but you dont have to send the
           milk...I'll supply that).
JJennings  Me, too. No, that's not true...
JJennings  ...I used to miss the paper version. After four issues I like the
           disk version better. ...
JJennings  ...But then, I am a tad biased.
Apple24evr What if the article really doesn't have a program that could go
           with it? Or, if the demo
Apple24evr program would have to be too big to fit on the disk? GA
A2GS       could you send me 4 issues to try and persuade me   :_)
A2GS       errr  :-)
Apple24evr (I'm done harassing Jay after that last one, BTW)
JJennings  Um...like I said, for the _most_ part we don't do articles without
           programs. There can, and are,...
JJennings  ...exceptions. GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Mac has the next question...GA Mac...
Mac Hater  psuedo-off topic, but I don't mind.  How are the plans for KFest
           going?  Have
Mac Hater  you fleshed out any details on participating in a whatchamaclit
           (i'm tired...
Mac Hater  the thing where you tell people about things...argh)  *zzz*  ga
AFA Gary J :)
JJennings  A session? :)
Mac Hater  thats it
JJennings  Okay...
JJennings  We're looking for proposals at this time. There's info on
           KansasFest in the March issues of...
JJennings  ...A2-Central and 8/16-Central. I'll also be posting that info
           here very soon - maybe later...
JJennings  ...tonight after I get home.  Apple will be there again, and we're
           expanding it from...
JJennings  ...two days to six days.
Apple24evr Wow!
Mac Hater  SIX?  WOW
Mac Hater  Does that include college?
AFL Dyfet  SIX!!  Excellant!
Apple24evr And half the price, right??
JJennings  First two days, GS college, Pascal college, or C college. Next two
           days, regular KansasFest,...
AFA Gary J :)
JJennings  ...last two days, Apple Central Expo - and AppleFest-type exhibit
           fair sponsored by...
JJennings  ...Apple Midwestern Region. GA
JWankerl   What's the # to call for KFest?  I lost the scrap I had it on...
           something 6502
JJennings  913-469-6502.
JWankerl   Thanx.
A2GS       6 Days?????   No offense...but where are you going to get all the
           material to 
A2GS       fill those days....is there enough material to begin with??
JJennings  Tom - we only have to fill two days. The colleges take up the
           first two, and ACE takes up the last 2.
Mac Hater  could you repost the dates please?
JJennings  Yeah, July 16-21, 1991 in Beautiful Kansas City.
Mac Hater  Overland Park, in the middle of nowhere, you mean ;)
Apple24evr Glorious Kansas City...
AFL SandyB Right, Mac Hater, exactly.
JJennings  You could also fax a request for info at 913-469-6507. We like
           faxes.
AFA Gary J 6507?  (Must be a new processor)
AFL SandyB Gary, veiled things like that are what start rumors, right? It's a
           new
AFL SandyB processor for the ][+, LOL.
Apple24evr (LOL Gary!)
JJennings  OPKS - The town that never sleeps.
JWankerl   Man, I drove thru Kansas for XMas break - I saw a sign - McD's 100
           miles! ARGH!
AFL SandyB LOL
AFL Dyfet  I spent a week driving through Kansas one day :)
Nuzz       I missed that ACE reference. What is ACE
JJennings  Apple Central Expo = ACE. We couldn't use the name AppleFest so we
           made up our own name. :)
AFA Gary J Is that the central U.S. version of Apple Fiesta?  
JJennings  Kind of the central version of Apple Fiesta (I guess). :)
ShanoJ     I have a completely unrelated ?, for the Apple guys, when you're
           ready... 
JWankerl   Me too.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Jonah, I guess now is as good a time as any :)....Go
           ahead...
ShanoJ     Okay, I have this routine where I call MarkResourceChange and
           then
ShanoJ     WriteResourec on a resource. If I get a locked error on the Write,
           I open an
ShanoJ     alert and tell the user to unprotect the disk. If they eject the
           disk and then
ShanoJ     stick it back in, WITHOUT unlocking it, and I make the
           WriteResource call
ShanoJ     again, I DON'T get a lockedDisk error, but the resource ISN'T
           written. Then,
ShanoJ     WEIRD things start happening after I quit the program (I get file
           still open 
ShanoJ     errors, etc.) What to do?
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   Are you checking for errors other than "locked error"?
ShanoJ     Yuppers. I don't get ANY errors--carry is clear on the second
           WriteResource. :(
Matt DTS   (Which I assume is $2B, write protected [correct] and not $4E,
           invalid access [incorrect])
Matt DTS   What kind of device is it?
ShanoJ     It's a Apple 3.5" disk. (And ya, it was a $2B that I was talking
           about.)
Matt DTS   (Apple 3.5 Drive, you mean?)  Hmmm...
ShanoJ     I know the resource manager has a NotifyProc set up for disk
           ejects. Is it
ShanoJ     possibly closing the resource file or some such?
Matt DTS   A call made to an open file while the disk is offline should
           return $2E (disk switched), but
Matt DTS   it shouldn't return errors after you've inserted it.
Matt DTS   (The notify proc is only called after the fact - not before the
           disk is ejected.)
ShanoJ     But that's the problem--it's NOT! :(
Dave Lyons Jonah, are you sure that notify proc is for ejects?  I thought it
           was just for GS/OS<-->P8 switches.
ShanoJ     Hmm... I'll go check...
ShanoJ     Err, scratch that... I'm using the P8 version... :(
ShanoJ     (of AOL, that is)
Matt DTS   I can't think of anything that would cause it.  Mybe you're doing
           something else wrong.  :)
ShanoJ     That's likely, Matt, but I sure can't figure out what it is. The
           sequence of
ShanoJ     calls is
           MarkResourceChange/WriteResource/AlertWindow/WriteResource. It
           should
ShanoJ     loop on the last two, but I'm not getting an error on the Write...
           :(
Matt DTS   Well, hold on...
JWankerl   NotifyProc is for os switches, disk insert eject, volume change,
           and shutdown.
ShanoJ     (thanks, Joe.)
Dave Lyons Joe, in the case of the Resource Manager's notify proc, there only
           seem to be 3 bits set in the
Matt DTS   It does sound like the info is succesfully being written through
           GS/OS but GS/OS is unable to flush
Matt DTS   the file when it's time to update the stuff.
Dave Lyons flags word--it doesn't take all the event types.
Matt DTS   Can you use GSBug to set OS breaks on WriteGS to see what's
           happening?  (and maybe on CloseGS?)
ShanoJ     Well, the last time I used a OS break I got majorly messed up (I
           went into GS
ShanoJ     Bug, but I was in bank $3B or some such... :( ) I can try again,
           though...
JWankerl   I use OS breaks fairly regularly - they work for me well enough.
Matt DTS   Otherwise, I have no other ideas.  Sorry.  GA.
ShanoJ     Okay, thanks anyway. I'll play with it some more....
AFL Dyfet  GO II4ever :)
Apple24evr Just wanted to say, the cookies and milk go in an envelope
           tomorrow, Jay. Thanks for coming online.
AFA Gary J (I feel very sorry for the postal service at this point)
JJennings  You're welcome. I'll be looking forward to the envelope full of
           milk. :)

JWankerl   I wanna know what's the "official method" to patch into GS/OS and
           trap calls,
JWankerl   especially the Quit call so I can write some type of shell to
           launch EXE files.
JWankerl   GA
ShanoJ     Good question!!
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt
Matt DTS   The "official" method for patching the tool dispatcher
Matt DTS   is outlined in IIgs TN #87.  I don't know engineering's thoughts
           on recommending that method
Matt DTS   for the GS/OS vectors or not.  Dave?
Dave Lyons There is no special official method for patching the GS/OS
           vectors.  "Just do it."  Be sure you
Dave Lyons have interrupts disabled when you're only "half patched," and be
           sure to patch both the stack
Dave Lyons entry ($e100b0) and the inline entry ($e100a8).
Matt DTS   (And be sure to check both class 0 and class 1 calls.)
JWankerl   Half patched?  Like one entry and not the other?
ShanoJ     Naw, like bank but not address word...
Matt DTS   Like when you've replaced the first two bytes of the vector but
           not the last two.
JWankerl   Oh okay, got it.  Is it safe to remove my patch when I'm done?
Dave Lyons Well, it's not safe to *not* remove your patch when you're done,
           so....YES, it's safe. :)
JWankerl   Okay.  Just wondering what would happen if someone patched over my
           patch. :-)
Dave Lyons If someone patches over your patch, their patch will go away when
           you take yours out.  (Too bad.)
Apple24evr No-- wait---
Apple24evr Can't you patch by copying the old vectors into your code?
Apple24evr That way, it's a chain of tool patches?>
JWankerl   I don't think I'm following this now...
Matt DTS   Yes, A24Evr, but if someone removes a middle link of  the chain,
           it falls apart.
ShanoJ     Ya, but what if someone is chained to you, and you put your
           chainee back into
ShanoJ     the vector? Then everything after yours is removed...
JWankerl   I change the vectors to point to my code and then re-route my code
           to where
JWankerl   those vectors were pointing, so if someone patched into my patch
           and I removed
JWankerl   mine, then that other patch would call me and the machine would
           die, right?
Matt DTS   Daisy-chaning only works "totally" correct if all the patches are
           removed in the order they were
Matt DTS   installed.
Apple24evr Oh oh oh... I see... (I love aliases)
Apple24evr heheheh!
ShanoJ     Naw, Joe, theirs would never be called...
JWankerl   Ahhhhh!  I get it.  Temporary mind slip.  :-)
JWankerl   But then what happens when they unpatch?
ShanoJ     That's a bigger problem... :)
AFA Gary J Sounds worth testing out :)
JJennings  Let's all hop into the monitor and try it. :)
Apple24evr heh
Matt DTS   Joe, draw yourself some diagrams with arrows pointing to different
           addresses to simulate the
Matt DTS   flow of execution.  Things will become clearer.
JWankerl   Nah, Nifty List is better.  :-)
ShanoJ     Probably you should test that the current address in the vector
           and the one
ShanoJ     you're hoping to put in there are the same....
JWankerl   Good thought, Jonah.  But what should I do if they're different? 
           Not unpatch?
ShanoJ     Ya, then you just assume that something weird has happened and
           don't unpatch,
ShanoJ     just let all of the calls pass through you unaffected.
JWankerl   Yah, I could do that, but I'd have to leave a piece of my program
           around -
JWankerl   but better than crashing I reckon.
Matt DTS   Exciting though patching theory is, I think I'm going to take
           off.
ShanoJ     Nite Matt!
ShanoJ     Ya, probably a bit better than crashing... :)
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Dyfet  Goodnight Matt
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Matt.
AFL Dyfet  I would also like to thank our guest, Jay Jennings, for stopping
           by this
AFL Dyfet  evening and putting up with us as long as he has :)....
AFA Gary J Yes, thanks Jay!
Apple24evr Thanks Jay. I laughed, I cried, I wet my pants.
JJennings  Thanks, A24Evr. I try. :-P
Apple24evr LOL!
AFA Gary J BTW:  I wanted to say that I was skeptical about a disk based
           8/16 as well, but
AFA Gary J I must say that I'm very impressed by the format!  Very much like
           reading the
AFA Gary J magazine.
JJennings  Thanks! I've enjoyed being here and hope to keep putting out neat
           issues of 8/16-Central for...
JJennings  ...a long time to come.
AFL Dyfet  As do we!
Apple24evr Yeah! Let's hope for it.
