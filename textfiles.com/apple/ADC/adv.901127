APPLE II DEVELOPMENT FORUM CONFERENCE LOG
Tuesday, November 27, 1990  10:00 p.m. Eastern Time
Topic:  Open Topic
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet)


AFL Dyfet  Okay, tonight is our open topic night...this means you can bring
           up any
AFL Dyfet  development questions or problems you wish, including 'what is Gib
           coding' :)
A2Evanglst LOL!!! I am playing with the new version of Genesys trying to see
           what I can do with it ;)
Tamira     (Just don't break it Gib)
AFL Dyfet  Go ahead, Windrider...you have the floor now...
Windrider5 I'm interested in how to have a "floating window"
Windrider5 that is a window that whether or not it is active will appear in
           front of all
Windrider5 others
ShanoJ     I think you have to not use Task Master OR patch the toolbox so
           that other
ShanoJ     windows ca't be brought in front of it....
SteveB     Well, I looked at the Twilight code, and unfortunately I can't
           make a blanker
SteveB     bacause CP doesn't suppot that file type. :((((((((
SteveB     You can only make Desktop apps, CDA's, and NDA's :(((
ShanoJ     Oh I see.... Ya, Complete Pascal won't cut it for Blanker writing.
           I think 
ShanoJ     ORCA/Pascal will do it, though....
SteveB     Hm...maybee I should get that... :)
ShanoJ     Well, I prefer it, but that's because I like using combinations of
           languages,
ShanoJ     and I can't do that in Complete Pascal.... :(
SteveB     Or, maybe I should try to write one in ASM! Ugg, that would be
           dangerous!
SteveB     especially me writeing one! :) :)
SteveB     Well, Jonah, Vince Cooper said that soon he might be adding some
           new
SteveB     features to CP, so we'll have to wait.. :)
ShanoJ     Well I hope SOMEONE enters. I hear there's only ONE entry in the
           programming
ShanoJ     division, and it'd be a shame if he won all of those nifty prizes
           by default.:(

AFL Dyfet  What kinda initialization/launch environment does a blanker
           recieve?
AFL Dyfet  Does it use a custom initialization with lead pointers, does it
           receive a
AFL Dyfet  normal S16-like launch with a command string, or what?
ShanoJ     Well, I call the blanker from Twilight like this:
ShanoJ     pushlong #TextStr
ShanoJ     pushlong #MoveFlag
ShanoJ     pushword YourID
ShanoJ     jsl TheBlanker
ShanoJ     Now, if I understand things properly that shows up in a Pascal
           header something
ShanoJ     like this: procedure MyBlanker(TextStr,
           MoveFlag:Longint;MyId:Word); (I'm
ShanoJ     not sure exactly what the types are, but that's the general idea.
           Thing is,
ShanoJ     Complete Pascal won't let you do stand alone procedures, which I
           THINK the
ShanoJ     ORCA languages do.....
ShanoJ     (for writing libraries and the like....)
AFL Dyfet  Yes, but any compiler will normally generate a root launch
           interface...
Dave Lyons (Do you expect the routine to remove the parameters before
           returning?  Pascal will.)
SteveB     Yes, hopefully in the future.. :)
AFL Dyfet  You can create stand alone OBJ files, but NOT loadable/linked
           executables with
AFL Dyfet  stand alone procedures...linking will bring in the front end
           (whether it's an
AFL Dyfet  NDA front end, quit-launch handling, or whatever).  The result is
           a
AFL Dyfet  load file with a front end launch environment in front of any
           stand alone
AFL Dyfet  procedures.

AFL Dyfet  Well, let's give Scott here a chance :)...GA Scott...
AFL Scott  Is there a problem with the new Imagewriter DC printer driver that
           causes it to not stop printing
AFL Scott  When the background color is not white?
AFL Scott  (ie palette index 0?)
Dave Lyons (Not that I've heard of.)
AFL Scott  Ok, this happens with every program I have.  Including Allison.
AFL Scott  Just wondering.
AFL Dyfet  Hmm...will have to test that myself, Scott...
AFL Dyfet  GA Windrider...
Windrider5 I'd like to try again with my question about "floating windows"
AFL Dyfet  Okay!
Windrider5 How can I have an window in front of other windows without it
           being active?
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave...
Dave Lyons Yeah, if you call 
Dave Lyons TaskMaster you need to turn off the bit that makes it select
Dave Lyons windows that you click on, that's step 1.
Dave Lyons Then you have to manage the "front" window yourself--using
           HiliteWindow and SendBehind, rather
Dave Lyons than SelectWindow.
Dave Lyons Note--
Dave Lyons your "windoid" won't *always* be in front--it will just be in
           front of your application's other
Dave Lyons windows.  Desk Accessory windows will be in front of your windoid
           (or else they won't work!).
Dave Lyons And your modal dialogs will probably be in front of your
           windoid(s) too.
Dave Lyons Does that help?
Windrider5 yes thank you!
Dave Lyons (Not sure whether anything weird will
Dave Lyons happen when the Real front window gets closed--the
Dave Lyons window manager may try to hilite the windoid for you--but that
           probably just means you'll want
Dave Lyons a borderless window & draw your own title-like thing in it.)
Dave Lyons (ga)
AFL Dyfet  Okay...
AFL Dyfet  Do we have any more questions for the queue tonight?
Coach101   What does everyone think of the Apple II manual that just came out
           in the developer mailings?
AFL Dyfet  First, who here has received the mailing already?
Matt DTS   (Would this be "The Apple II Guide"?)
Coach101   Yep, I think that is the name I was looking for...
Windrider5 Is it being sent to all APDA members?
A2GS       It's nice, but it seems more of a book to help shut people up then
           to help the
A2GS       II...the dealer information in the back is VERY inaccurate.
AFL Marty  What about the rest of the information in it?
Coach101   What do you mean by "... shut people up...."  ?
Lucky24    I haven't seen the book yet, but I heard it was quite nice.  I
           don't think
Lucky24    it's nice to talk negatively of this..  It was worked on by a lot
           of people
Lucky24    And it does promote the Apple II
AFL Dyfet  That is true Lucky...mostly by volunteers...
AFL Dyfet  I know there has been a lot said about the dealer info already in
           ATB...but
AFL Dyfet  there are other parts :)...
Tamira     haven't seen it
AFL Dyfet  GA Gib...
A2Evanglst As for shutting people up I don't think that is the issue.
A2Evanglst True... Some of the dealer Info has some problems but... and I
           will say but.. there are some dealers
A2Evanglst that are listed that do care about the Apple II.  And the guide is
           a good source of Information for 
A2Evanglst people that don't have a knowledgable dealer that is willing to
           give some of the basic 
A2Evanglst information that is needed by the Apple II person.
A2GS       Maybe "shutting people up" was a little harsh....although there is
           PLENTY
A2GS       of other information offered by the guide....DEALER support is by
           FAR the
A2GS       most important thing.
Lucky24    I critize Apple plenty, but not for publishing a book on, for and
           about the 
Lucky24    Apple II.
A2Evanglst IMHO the guide was very well done... and I do know of three
           dealers in the Chicago Area that are 
A2Evanglst listed and that DO support the Apple II.  
AFL Dyfet  I wonder why it had to be done by volunteers, and not directly by
           Apple,
AFL Dyfet  though.
A2Evanglst <---- Mine is one of them <grin>
A2GS       Unfortunately....I can say just the opposite about dealers listed
           here in N.Y.
AFL Dyfet  Let's give Matt the floor for a minute...GA Matt...
Matt DTS   First, what exactly was supposedly done by volunteers?
Matt DTS   <ga>
A2GS       The typesetting   :)
Matt DTS   Ha ha.  I'm serious - what was done by volunteers?
Tamira     the marketing??
Coach101   I have not had a chance to go through the book yet but,
Coach101   the mere fact that Apple & Redgate published it was
Matt DTS   Dyfet, you're the one who said "I wonder why it had to be done by
           volunteers and not by Apple" - WHAT?
AFL Dyfet  From what I understand, information and time to produce it mainly
           came from 
AFL Dyfet  user groups and people inside Apple who worked in their spare
           time...
AFL Dyfet  GA Gib...
A2Evanglst Most of the articles were written by volunteers.
Lucky24    Sometimes this is the best type of information.  
Matt DTS   Well, this is a good thing.  You want knowledgable people with a
           little time to spare instead of...
Matt DTS   people you hire full-time who haven't been involved before (or
           worse, taking people away from
Matt DTS   engineering or other pursuits!).
A2Evanglst I would rather have someone with their heart in it than some
           marketing geek who was paid to pay 
A2Evanglst tribute to the Apple II.  
A2GS       Yes, but it also has the potential to send people the wrong
           message....
A2GS       that  "since Apple people weren't interested in supporting the II,
           it took
A2GS       some volunteers to put together the thing" <--- not my own
           interpretation,
A2GS       just an example.
Matt DTS   Second, about the dealer information:
Matt DTS   The dealer information was compiled like this:
Matt DTS   We put out notices in several places dealers are supposed to pay
           attention, such as the AppleGram
Matt DTS   newsletter, AppleLink mail, and several other places where dealers
           are supposed to look.
Matt DTS   The message, posted in these several places, told dealers that if
           they were committed to selling,
Matt DTS   servicing and supporting the Apple II, send us your dealer
           information for publication in the Guide.
Matt DTS   If a dealer did not respond favorably to this, they were *NOT*
           included.  They had to specifically
Matt DTS   state they were Apple II dealers to be included.  Now, admittedly,
           we didn't send out a hit squad 
Matt DTS   armed with intricate knowledge of low-level ProDOS globals to test
           their knowledge, but...
Matt DTS   we did not list anyone who did not respond favorably.
AFL Dyfet  Okay...that was a reasonable approach, with appearently less
           optimal than
AFL Dyfet  anticipated results...
A2Evanglst No, as for the guide.  IMHO, I believe the guide and the articles
           were meant to be informative.
A2Evanglst I don't think anyone here would like the guide if it had been put
           together without the valuable help
A2Evanglst of people like the BCS and several people online.  I am glad that
           they round up just anyone to write 
A2Evanglst the articles for the book.  
Lucky24    I have yet to see one.  Is this supposed to be bundled with the
           IIGS?
AFL Dyfet  Yes, you are next, actually, Marty :)
AFL Dyfet  GA :)
AFL Marty  I think it's commendable that people volunteered to do this
           work...
AFL Marty  it shows an enthusiasm and degree of support from the
           grass-roots...
AFL Marty  Apple II folks that would be very difficult (if not impossible) to
           duplicate
AFL Marty  with any other group....
Lucky24    Apple II people tend to be that way
AFL Marty  I wonder how many volunteers would have stepped forward had a
           similar ...
AFL Marty  publication been planned for the Macintosh.
AFL Marty  done
AFL Dyfet  Okay...Jonah, you have the floor now...GA...
ShanoJ     Okay, excuse my ignorance but how did people get this thing and,
           more
ShanoJ     importanly, how do _I_ get a copy. :)
Coach101   I got my copy in the November Apple Partner's mailing...
Coach101   Maybe Matt can answer as to how and when other copies will be
           available...
Matt DTS   You should be able to get a copy from your local Apple dealer, II
           or not.
Matt DTS   The Apple part number, for the truly obstinate, is A0243LL/A.
AFL Dyfet  :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay....GA A2....
A2GS       Okay...
A2GS       I'm just curious as to how some of the really anti-II dealers
           ended up getting
A2GS       into the book if only those which at least answered favorably
           ended up in the
A2GS       book.
AFL Dyfet  I think Matt pretty much explained this....GA Matt...
AFL Scott  What does that have to with development, A2??
Matt DTS   We asked dealers to tell us if they were committed to selling,
           servicing and supporting the Apple II.
Matt DTS   If they wrote back and said "we are", then they were included. 
           Otherwise they were not.  <GA>
A2GS       what about if they said "we are....not"?
Matt DTS   They were not included.
Matt DTS   Actual people who actually read and comprehend English sorted
           through all the replies, listing
Matt DTS   only the ones who responded as we intended.  <GA>
AFL Dyfet  I suspect the dealers misunderstood the purpose of the guide....
A2GS       o.k.  I just don't think dealers who made it into the book who
           ended up being 
A2GS       clear anti-II companies are going to help the II...are more likely
           to hurt it..
A2GS       but I'm not blaming Apple specifically for those dealers who got
           in, Apple
A2GS       can't pay a personal visit to everyone who answered.
AFL Dyfet  Some may have viewed it as a promotional opertunity, a chance to
           get warm
AFL Dyfet  bodies, any bodies, into their stores...
AFL Marty  (But you did criticize Apple for allowing it to be a volunteer
           effort.)
Matt DTS   (May I request we move on to any development questions that may be
           waiting?)
AFL Dyfet  But I think this has been debated enough in ATB already....
AFL Dyfet  Okay, ShrinkIt had the next question, being what changes people
           would like to
AFL Dyfet  see in Finder....GA Matt...
Matt DTS   May I (again, humbly) request that we get to the dev questions
           before the suggestions?
Matt DTS   I know everyone has great Finder ideas and Andy's like a Finder
           Sponge (whatever that is), but I'd
Matt DTS   like to help the programmers first.  (don't hurt me, Andy)
AFL Dyfet  Okay Matt...:)
Lucky24    Shrinkit sponge, you mean
AFL Dyfet  I actually was going to add 'keep it short'...but we can move to
           A2's question
AFL Dyfet  first :)
HeadCase   Finder binder?
Matt DTS   (Is he still there?)
Coach101   BTW....   Matt & Humility....   On the same line :)
ShrinkIt   No, actually, I was over in Swihart's cube for a moment... but
           please, do go on -- what stuff
ShrinkIt   does everyone want done to the Finder? (within reason, which I'll
           leave up to you)
AFL Dyfet  (We'll get to you, Andy :)
A2GS       Sorry to return to the previous topic...
A2GS       but I would just like to know if Apple themselves are making
           schools aware that
A2GS       this book exists....a young friend of mines school has II's and
           the teacher
A2GS       is a proclaimed II enthusist, yet he was surprised when shown the
           book and
A2GS       admitted never hearing about it.
A2GS       GA
Matt DTS   Education reps can give it to schools, and they can get it from
           dealers just like anyone else.
Matt DTS   However, if you're asking if we're going to drop thousands of
           copies on the NEA convention from a
Matt DTS   helicopter or something like that, I don't think so.  Most Apple
           reps should give it to schools with
Matt DTS   large numbers of Apple IIs.  <GA>
Dave Lyons (Why not?  Let's propaganda-bomb the NEA.)
A2GS       Nope...how about an ad JUST for the book in an edu-mag like k-12
A2GS       I think that's reasonable.
Matt DTS   I don't know, and I really don't think the development conference
           is the appropriate place
Matt DTS   to discuss it (since none of the people who do know are likely to
           show up).  GA.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Scott has the floor now...GA Scott....
A2GS       I agree....but while we're on the topic....
A2GS       never mind
AFL Scott  Ok... Am I correct in this observation:  Quickdraw through the
           Print Manager
AFL Scott  only uses palette zero?
Matt DTS   Unless otherwise instructed through printer-driver specific
           instructions, yes.
Matt DTS   (GA)
AFL Scott  Ok... Thanks.
AFL Scott  Done.
Dave Lyons (Or unless the driver looks at the MasterSCB or other SCBs??)
Coach101   That was quick....
Matt DTS   Most drivers won't do that, Dave:
Dave Lyons (OK, cool.)
AFL Scott  I've noted that, too..:)  Thanks for the observation, Dave!:)
Matt DTS   Since the normal print loop isn't associated with a given pixel
           map (therefore no SCBs), and even
Matt DTS   PrPixelMap is only a pixel map, with no way to indicate SCBs,
           there's really nothing to do but
Matt DTS   look at the Master SCB, which most printer drivers don't do - they
           use palette zero.
Matt DTS   The IW drivers (old and new) have ways to use different SCBs, but
           you have to work at them.
Matt DTS   (GA)
AFL Scott  Suppose you pass a grafPort to the PrOpenDoc call that specifies a
           different
AFL Scott  palette in the SCB... I tried this last night and it didn't work,
           so you're 
AFL Scott  correct, I guess... %)
Matt DTS   Most printer drivers will only use grafPort parameters, not any
           attached pixel maps.  In fact,
Matt DTS   those that record pictures for later imaging specifically set the
           portRect to be empty so no
Matt DTS   actual drawing will occur.
Matt DTS   (Now it might work if you do it on PrPicFile, but I don't know for
           sure.  It's shaky at best.)
AFL Scott  That doesn't work... just thought I'd let you know.:)
AFL Scott  Done!:)
Matt DTS   Best to use the real ways to do it (with the structure in the old
           driver and the picComment in
Matt DTS   the new driver.)
AFL Dyfet  GA Jonah...
ShanoJ     Matt, quick question: could you point me in the direction of info
           on how to
ShanoJ     make the printer driver use more than one palette per picture? You
           alluded to
ShanoJ     this up above, I think....
Matt DTS   Apple IIgs TN #97, Picture Comments and Printing.  It discusses
           the picComments used by the new IW
Matt DTS   and IW LQ drivers, as well as the PostScript (tm) comments used by
           the LaserWriter driver.  GA.
ShanoJ     Okay, thanks (I KNEW you'd tell me to read a tech note.... :) GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay....GA Parik, you have the floor now...(poor Andy will miss
           our Finder
AFL Dyfet  comments...)
AFA Parik  when you license a copy of system software (for a product), can
           you dist. the
AFA Parik  system software online?  ga
Matt DTS   NO!
Matt DTS   Or Maybe.
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach :)...Maybe?? :)
Matt DTS   It really depends, I believe, on whether or not you're
           distributing your product online.
Matt DTS   If you're getting money from people for the express purpose of
           downloading SSW, then you have to have
Matt DTS   an Electronic License, which costs a little more money (or a LOT
           more if you're doing Mac stuff).
Matt DTS   It's best to ask Software Licensing at Apple such questions,
           because they don't get it wrong.  :)
AFA Parik  I have a "stupid" synthlab player, I (or an AMS staff member)
           wants to license
AFA Parik  MidiSynth and distribute the tool to get around the problem.
AFL Dyfet  I have seen several shareware products distributed with GS/OS in a
           packed
AFL Dyfet  bootable disk archive...
Matt DTS   Dyfet, those are not allowed unless the system software is
           licensed, which it often isn't for
Matt DTS   shareware.
Coach101   Matt, If you have a license to distribute the system sofware with
           your software, and
Coach101   if you distribute your software electronically, it *might* be that
           you could then also
Coach101   distribute the system software electronically (solely for use
Coach101   with the software that you are distributing)...
Matt DTS   Coach:  True, but I don't know for certain and it's better to be
           safe than litigated.  :)
Matt DTS   You can reach Software Licensing at (408) 974-4667 and they'll
           tell you the Straight Dope.
AFA Parik  zanks. ga
AFL Dyfet  All cases so far seem to be 'minimal' systems with just the
           tools/system files
AFL Dyfet  needed to boot the shareware application in question...
Coach101   Yeah, but its so much fun to see a lawyer get red in the
           face....
Matt DTS   All of the system's copyrighted, not just the parts you don't need
           to run their applications.  :)
AFL Dyfet  GA Scott
AFL Scott  This is for Nuzz.... 
AFA Parik  so should we all close our eyes?
Nuzz       huh
AFL Scott  I know how many headaches you must have had when you wrote GDL...
           Simple 
AFL Scott  printing can be a pain. :)
Nuzz       Keep telling yourself "The Print Manager is my friend"
AFA Parik  darn, I thought you were going to ask him to marry you or
           something.
AFL Scott  No way!  I've met him!:)
AFL Dyfet  We can always start a rumor, Parik :)
Nuzz       Scott is always just looking at pictures
ShanoJ     Does that mean advanced printing ISN'T a pain, Scott? :)
AFL Scott  No, that means I don't want to think about advanced printing!:)
AFA Parik  (argh...ariel...they dumped the II...:(((
AFL Dyfet  Hardly a note I would want to close the log on...
AFL Scott  No loss, IMHO... They never sent me 4 issues of 8-16 anyway.
AFL Scott  I got all the disks, never the paper.
AFA Parik  but ross was a neat guy.  + Note -- umm... ummm... SSSi is still
           in business!:)
AFL Dyfet  I still prefer paper...call me old fashioned :)
AFA Parik  and of course, we must (allison) subliminally (buy) plug (allison)
           products.
Coach101   Paper yes...   Who has a keyboard and monitor in the John
           anyway?
AFL Scott  Me too... it's easy to find magazines, but all blue splined disks
           look alike
AFL Scott  from the top.
AFL Scott  (Unless you use GDL!)
AFA Parik  Do you prefer paper tnotes or file?
ShanoJ     Ya, I'd like paper too. Especially since I'm going to be writing
           for them. :)
AFA Parik  <-- prefers disk vastly
ShanoJ     It looks more impressive if it's on paper.... :)
AFA Parik  you guys must have HUGE houses!  
Nuzz       Wait till you see our new HDL (Hard Drive Labeler)
AFL Scott  Paper...  That way I can use the notebook as a lap warmer...:)
AFL Dyfet  I do have a HUGE house :)
AFL Scott  ROTFL!:)
AFL Scott  <--- Has a big mess.
