Topic:  Pascal and C
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet)


AFL Dyfet  Okay, good evening and welcome to the tuesday night Apple
AFL Dyfet  Development Forum chat.  Tonight's topic will be C and Pascal.
AFL Dyfet  We will, of course, be using protocol here tonight, starting
	   now.
AFL Dyfet  If you wish to ask a question, you must enter a '?' on a line
AFL Dyfet  by itself, and if you wish to comment on the current question
	   you
AFL Dyfet  must enter a '!' on a line by itself.  I will call each of you in
	   turn.
AFL Dyfet  Now, can we have the first questions, please...:)
Coach101   ?
AFL Dyfet  Okay Coach, GA.
AFA Gary J Q = Coach
Coach101   Does anyone know if ByteWorks released their "C" compiler and if
	   so,
Coach101   has anyone had any experience with it?  GA
AFL Dyfet  I beleive they showed a beta at AppleFest, but I haven't heard
	   since...anyone
AFL Dyfet  else know?
AFA Gary J !
Doctor Why !
AFL Dyfet  GA Gary.
AFA Gary J I know someone who ordered it, and it is backordered.  They
	   didn't have a 
AFA Gary J definite shipping date, but it is close to shipping.
AFA Gary J It was advertised in the May issue of ..
AFA Gary J A+/InCider.
AFA Gary J GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I see.  GA Doctor.
Doctor Why I ordered it at Applefest, but haven't received it yet. GA
AFA Gary J Q = Coach
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I think we have room in the queue for a few more
	   questions...:)
AFA Gary J C seems to be very popular in our source code library lately.
Coach101   Dave...., I told you not to cancel the dancing ladies!
Coach101   ?
AFL Dyfet  Oh drat...yeah, we will need to get a new chorus line.  GA
	   Coach.
Coach101   Two questions, are we using protocol so that Dave can get his
Coach101   weekly jollies with the whips & chains....   Second, does anyone
	   know
Coach101   if Apple is going to do anything with "C"in the new APW that
	   will
Coach101   come out shortly after 5.0?   
AFL Dyfet  As to APW C, the person best able to answer that question doesn't
	   seem to be
AFL Dyfet  on-line at the moment...Oh, is anyone here familiar with TML's
	   Pascal II
AFL Dyfet  announcement?
AFA Parik  yes
AFL Marty  I have it here someplace
AFL Scott  No, Tell us about it!
AFA Parik  but say it anyways :)
AFL Dyfet  Me?  I haven't seen it myself yet :).  I was hoping somebody could
	   tell me :),
AFL Dyfet  .
AFL Vince  What do you want to know?
AFL Marty  Most important new feature is the resource editor...
AFA Parik  supports > 32k linkage... 
A GibberFC (hi all....are we in protocol ;)
AFL Dyfet  Sorta, Gibber.
AFL Marty  enables programmers to graphically define menus, windows, etc.
AFL Vince  new features: Complete support for 5.0, resource editor, enhanced
	   program editor, new manual
AFA Gary J Q = Dyfet (Marty, Vince)
AFL Marty  (I'll stop.... no need for me to be a parrot)
Windrider5 ?
AFA Gary J When?  (This summer?? :)
AFL Dyfet  I do recall hearing it will ship July 1st.
AFL Marty  7/1
AFL Vince  Supports the new StartupTools and Shutdowntools directives,
	   etc..
AFL Vince  they are also having a programming contest with lots of nice
	   prizes..
AFL Marty  $49.95
AFA Gary J Q = Dyfet (Vince), Windrider
AFA Parik  (that means GS/OS will be out July 1st...?)
Doctor Why !
AFL Vince  they are offering TWGS for $299
AFL Marty  yes Parik
AFL Dyfet  Sounds pretty exciting.  Seems everyone will have a resource
	   editor pretty
AFA Gary J $49.95 is upgrade price?
AFL Vince  and they have rewritten the source code library
AFL Marty  Oui
THE GIBBER (oops the kittens knocked the phone off the hook :(
AFA Gary J What is $$$ new?
AFA Gary J Q = Dyfet (Dr Why), Windrider
AFL Vince  I would assume $129 which is their normal retail...
AFL Marty  Doesn't say here.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, GA Dr.
AFL Marty  (----=====[}}}} Joe)
Doctor Why Please cancel my ! it was already mentioned.
JSchober   (Hi all... and thrpppt Marty... :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe the next question is from Windrider.  GA Wind.
AFA Gary J Q = Windrider
Windrider5 what do you mean by graphically defining menus window?
AFL Marty  It means point and click.
AFL Dyfet  I think they meant you define a resource and draw it in resedit.
AFL Marty  The resource editor does the job of generating the code necessary
	   to
AFL Marty  draw the window at those coordinates.
AFA Gary J Q = Windrider, <empty>
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I think it's time to fill that queue.  Any new questions out
	   there?
AFA Parik  ?
Windrider5 I'll believe it when I see it
AFL Dyfet  Okay, GA Parik.
AFA Gary J Q = Parik
AFA Parik  Does GS/OS v5.0 come with a Resource Editor itself?  Is
	   APW/TML/Genesys/etc REZ
AFA Parik  program a lot like the Macs REZEDIT?
AFA Parik  (er, resedit :)
AFL Dyfet  Well, the APW rez tools are more like the Mac Resouce script
	   compiler, from
AFL Dyfet  what I understand.  Not visual, just text.  GENESYS is a full
	   blown visual
AFL Dyfet  resource editor that appearently genorates supporting code
	   routines you can
AFA Gary J Q = Parik
AFL Dyfet  then include.  I have no knowledge of what TML is doing. Anyone
	   else like to
AFL Dyfet  add any comments here?
Coach101   ?
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach.
AFA Gary J Q = Coach
Coach101   In writing a record management package, I have been looking at
	   some
Coach101   of the code that the PAW "C" compiler generates.  Some of it
	   looks
Coach101   so strange that I think I am missing something.  In particular,
	   in
Coach101   accessing a char[<255] item that is passed in,  the access could
Coach101   be simply accomplished with indexed indirect (stack is DP in "C")
	   but
AFA Parik  ?
Coach101   instead the code trundles off to LMUL (or something like that)
	   to
Coach101   do a bunch of address calculation.  Is this really necessary (from
	   a
Coach101   hardware viewpoint) or is the compiler just generating code from
	   a
AFA Gary J Q = Coach, Parik
Coach101   universal mold that is a TAD inefficient in my case?  Thanks  GA
AE PhilM   !
AFL Dyfet  GA Phil.
AE PhilM   Coach, the C compiler is not that smart.  It does not do
	   optimizations as well
AE PhilM   as some of the Pascal Compilers from TML or Byte Works....it
	   probably treats 
AFA Gary J Q = Coach (Phil), Parik
AE PhilM   char like an array and does not special case a single demintonal
	   array to use
AE PhilM   indexed addressing...and instead does a mul to find the index.
AE PhilM   done
AFL Scott  !
AFL Dyfet  GA Scott.
Coach101   Smart...   Thats an over statement.....   It is never hard to
Coach101   beat a compiler in code generation....   But, the stuff from the
Coach101   APW "C" compiler is really something to behold....   
Coach101   That will teach Tim not to be here to defend his product :)
Coach101   GA
AFL Scott  This is really a question for Phil... To go one step further in
	   optimizing...
AFA Gary J Q = Coach (Scott), Parik
AFL Dyfet  :)  And even a "hello world" can be an impressively sized
	   executable in APW C.
AFL Scott  Has AE any plans to write a "Cache optimized" compiler for use on
	   systems with
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Scott  TWGS?
Coach101   GREAT QUESTION!!!!!
AE PhilM   No, Scott.  We are not in the development tools (software)
	   business.  But we 
AE PhilM   are working with TML and the Byte Works so that they can take
	   advantage of any
THE GIBBER Fantastic!!!! A 10 on the scale ;)
AE PhilM   kind of hardware we can produce.   
AFL Scott  Thanks, Phil.
AE PhilM   A cache optimizing compiler is difficult at best...you really have
	   to know
AE PhilM   the cache algorithm in the TWGS..not very straight forward.
AE PhilM   No offence Coach...I did not do APW C.  Megamax Inc and Apple did
	   it.
AFA Gary J Q = Coach (Scott..Phil), Parik
AFL Scott  Done...
AE PhilM   done
Coach101   Done
AFL Dyfet  Okay.  Any more comments on APW C.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe the next question is from Parik.  GA Parik.
AFA Gary J Q = Parik
AFA Parik  on the sub of optimizations, does COMPACT optimize code or just
	   put it into OMF
AFA Parik  2 format?  also i wish more programmers would put their ds
	   statements at the 
AFA Parik  end of the program as compact really shrinks down the file even
	   more.  ga
Coach101   !
AE PhilM   Compact just puts code in OMF 2 format.  
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach.
Coach101   Phil said it!
AFL Dyfet  True.
AE PhilM   Sorry for buttin in!
AFL Dyfet  That's okay.  But now we need to fill the queue again :).
Coach101   Just keep an eye over your shoulder for Dave's whip :)
AFA Gary J Q = Parik, <empty>
AFL Scott  !
AE PhilM   Ouch!!
AFL Dyfet  Okay, GA Scott. *CRACK*
AFL Dyfet  (Must be a Tacheon Whip)
AFL Scott  One thing I'd like to see out of the compiler writers/Apple is an
	   option to
AFL Scott  include the symbol table lib. as part of, or a separate file that
	   can be loaded
AFL Scott  under utilities such as Nifty List, or even the Debugger.  That
	   way, it would
AFL Scott  make tracing code much easier, and it would bring Nifty List and
	   the Debugger
Coach101   !
AFL Scott  up to a level such as SDA on Vax.  GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach.
AFA Gary J Q = Scott (Coach), <empty>
Coach101   I agree Scott...  But it will take more than a compiler symbol
Coach101   table.  In "C", or any other _stack_ based variable language, 
Coach101   the debugger must know how to interpret the "systems" direct
	   page
AE PhilM   !
Coach101   stuff...   I believe in ByteWorks "C" there is a source level
	   debugger
Coach101   scheduled to come with the compiler.   In any event, if you have
	   to
Coach101   go to a debugger, at least having a hardcopy of the symbol table
Coach101   would be more than handy.  In other words..... I second that
	   motion....
Coach101   Also, 
Coach101   One of my pet peeves is indenting my own code.  I would like to
Coach101   do all my code at the left margin and let the compiler indent
	   the
Coach101   listing (aha, a listing from a "C" compiler, virgin territory)
	   to
Coach101   show what the structure of the program really is.  It is real
	   easy
Coach101   when chasing your code to skip a bunch of indented stuff as not
	   being
Coach101   a part of the code being executed because you have a misplaced
	   ";"
Coach101   or whatever.  GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Phil.
AFA Gary J Q = Scott (Phil), <empty>
AE PhilM   That's a very good suggestion Scott!!  It would be pretty easy to
	   do.  Apple 
AE PhilM   would first have to define a standard (they could use some of the
	   un-used 
AE PhilM   op-codes in the OMF discription)...then the others will follow
	   suit...
AE PhilM   Ask Tim S about this...done
AFL Dyfet  I like that idea, Phil.  I've been asking for some kind of Sym
	   file or support
AFL Scott  Will do! Thanks, Coach, and Phil!
AFA Gary J We'll just e-mail him a copy of tonight's log...  :)
AFL Dyfet  for YEARS now.   Putting it in the OMF is a very good idea.  A
	   simple utility
AFL Dyfet  could strip it off when your done with the SymDebug and have it
	   working...
AE PhilM   Yes, the loader could ignore the symbol opcodes and it would work
	   as normal...
AE PhilM   only the debuggers would have to know.
AE PhilM   It's a coordinated effort that has to originate from Apple to have
	   any chance
AE PhilM   of succeeding.
AFL Scott  !
AFL Dyfet  In fact, now that I think about it, many other 'profesional'
	   environments
AFL Dyfet  this in that manner.  GA Scott.
AFA Gary J Q = Scott, <empty>
AFL Scott  Do Mac compilers have this facility...  Dave, I was thinking
	   specifically of
AFL Scott  .STB files on Vaxen! :)
AFL Dyfet  I was thinking Unix more than VAX myself...but yes, VAXen do have
	   it as a
AFL Dyfet  seperate file.
AFL Scott  I agree, however that OMF is the place to put it on the II's,
	   tho... just think
AFL Dyfet  Of course, on the VAX you can get post-mortum debugging and
	   procedure call
AFL Scott  of the possiblities!
AFL Dyfet  trace...
AFL Dyfet  I agree that OMF is where it should be.  No need to clutter, and
	   the loader
Coach101   Might put the hexadecimal calculator people out of business!
AFL Dyfet  could easily be tought to ignore the STB stuff.
AFA Gary J Q = <empty>
AFL Scott  <---Lives in SDA :(
AFL Dyfet  Okay, any last questions for tonight.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I think we can end protocol then...
AFA Gary J Don't everyone shout at once....  :)
Coach101   Anyone know the latest "guesstimate" on 5.0 & new APW
AFA John   YAH! :)
JSchober   RSN...
AFA Gary J I've been looking at calendars here.... Apple can wait until Sept.
	   22 and 
AFA Gary J it will still be considered Summer.
AFA John   :)
AFL Dyfet  Yeah, 5.0 products may be out BEFORE 5.0 :).
JSchober   Gack...
AFA Gary J :)
AE PhilM   Spoke to Jonathan Fader today....5.0 should be licencable to
	   developers by July
AFA Gary J It could be the next AppleFest before we see anything!!
JSchober   :( Gary
AFL Dyfet  TML ships july 1st, after all.  Maybe they will have it on the
	   disk...:)
AFL Marty  Anytime school is out for more than 2 consecutive weeks is
	   summer...
AFA John   I need to get going.  Good night everyone.
AFL Marty  as far as I'm concerned :)
AFA Gary J It must be close though, with all the products anounced with it.
JSchober   Night, John.  :)
AFA Gary J Goodnight, John.
AE PhilM   So does Audio Animator...it requires 5.0.  We needed to know if we
	   could run
AE PhilM   adds
AFL Marty  TML Pascal II is supposed to ship sith System 5.0.
AFA Gary J Well, you know how release dates are......
AFL Marty  Yeah :(
AFA Gary J :(
Coach101   Yep, soft{ware} dates :)
AFL Marty  Somebody at Apple will find a way to gum up the works :(
AE PhilM   They keep finding bugs from what I here...found one the other day
	   in the SCSI 
AFA Gary J Yep.  Well, I'll try to be optimistic about this one.  July 1st
	   sounds good
AFA Gary J to me.
AE PhilM   manager...they fixed it tho
Coach101   From limited discussions with Rob Turner, I feel the internal
Coach101   freeze date is REAL close!
AE PhilM   One week is what I heard...but I heard that last week.
AFL Marty  Maybe they should let ADV members beta test the disk.
AFA Gary J typical..  :)
AFL Dyfet  TML is betting heavily that they will be able to ship July 1st.
