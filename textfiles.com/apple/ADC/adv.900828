APPLE II DEVELOPMENT FORUM CONFERENCE LOG
Tuesday, August 28, 1990  10:00 p.m. Eastern Time
Topic:     Complete Pascal 
           with Special Guest, Vince Cooper of Complete Technology
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar  (AFL Dyfet)

AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe we are now ready to get started :)
AFL Dyfet  Good evening and welcome to the Apple II Development Forum
           Conference.  We will
AFL Dyfet  be discussing Complete Pascal tonight with our special guest,
           Vince Cooper of
AFL Dyfet  Complete Technology.  We will be using protocol starting now! 
           This means that
AFL Dyfet  if you wish to ask a question, enter a '?' on a line by itself,
AFL Dyfet  and if you wish to respond/comment on the current question,
AFL Dyfet  enter a '!' on a line by itself.  I will now turn the floor over
AFL Dyfet  to our guest, Vince, who can explain to you what Complete
           Technologies is,
AFL Dyfet  and what their relationship with TML, and TML Pascal II users will
           be.
VCooper    Thanks Dave!
VCooper    Hello everyone!
VCooper    My name is Vince Cooper and I am the president of a new company
           called 
VCooper    Complete Technology, Inc. Some of you may know me as the former A2
           GS products
VCooper    manager from TML Systems.
VCooper    We are now in the business of publishing development tools for the
           IIGS with
VCooper    the former TML Pascal II and TML Basic being the first products we
           have
VCooper    brought to market.
VCooper    We have updated the Pascal product to fix some problems in the
           text editor
VCooper    and have recently released Complete Pascal 1.0, and are working
           hard on 
VCooper    Complete Pascal 2.0 which is to be a full blown upgrade of the
           product.
VCooper    We will do some work on Basic after the first of the year to
           correct some
VCooper    massive problems there, however, we felt the current market
           dictated that
VCooper    we work on the Pascal product first.
VCooper    Basicly what has happened is that TML Systems felt that their
           company was
VCooper    better off to focus their attentions on creating new and inovative
           products
VCooper    for the Macintosh and that you, their former customers were better
           off with
VCooper    another company handling their former IIGS products.
VCooper    The last few months at TML Systems all development and support
           attention was
VCooper    spent in the direction of the Macintosh and they, nor I, felt this
           was fair
VCooper    to their many many loyal IIGS customers.
VCooper    Therefore, on the first of July we started Complete Technology,
           and purchased
VCooper    the rights to TML's IIGS product line and and started immediate
           work to make
VCooper    the products the best that we could for IIGS developers.  We feel
           we have
VCooper    corrected the most drastic problem in Pascal (you couldnt edit
           source) and
VCooper    are now working hard on the other known problems as well as some
           enhancements
VCooper    that I felt were warranted...
VCooper    As far as technical support and updates go, we have institued a
           support
VCooper    program for TML's former clients with our company to open a
           support channel
VCooper    for you, and to make updates and upgrades available in the
           future.
VCooper    Unfortunately due to many different circumstances we could not
           offer free
VCooper    updates and support to all of their former clients, therefore, the
           support
VCooper    program and update offer that we have put together has a nominal
           charge 
VCooper    associated with it.
VCooper    We would like to have been able to do this for free for everyone
           since
VCooper    the previous preformance of the publisher left a bit to be desired
           in the
VCooper    support area, however, we just couldnt do it for several thousand
           people and
VCooper    stay in business very long.
VCooper    Plans?  Well, as stated we are working on an upgrade to the Pascal
           product
VCooper    to bring it in line with what we feel a professional quality
           development tool
VCooper    should be.  We will then start working on Basic to correct its
           many problems
VCooper    and bring it up to date with the current operating system used on
           the IIGS.
VCooper    The Basic work will be a little more intense since it also
           involves a
VCooper    conversion of development systems, however, we feel we can have
           something 
VCooper    accomplished sometime early next year.  Not the news some of you
           wanted to hear
VCooper    but better than you would have heard under the former
           circumstances.
VCooper    with that, I'll hand this back to Dave and see if I can handle any
           questions
VCooper    he or any of you might have for me tonight.
AFL Dyfet  I for one feel you have a strong series of products to work with,
           and hope that
AFL Dyfet  you can overcome some of the negative impressions left by TML
           Systems in the
AFL Dyfet  market place.  I think now is not a time to dwell on the mistakes
           of the past,
AFL Dyfet  but to look at the future for these potentially superb products. 
           This is, in
AFL Dyfet  many ways, about the best thing that could have happened for TML
           Pascal and
AFL Dyfet  Basic.  I believe that A2 has the first question.  GA A2...
A2GS       2 brief Q's....1) Any plans for supporting C?
A2GS       In the long run of course, GA
VCooper    In the very long run, maybe.  Personally I feel there are already
           two good
VCooper    C compilers available and I would rather see our company pursue
           something
VCooper    that isnt already there such as Fortran, or to add an assembler to
           our product
VCooper    line..
AFL Dyfet  (Just so long as you keep the nightmare of Cobol away from the
           IIgs :)
AFL Dyfet  And your 2nd Q, A2?
VCooper    No Cobol, please!  :)
A2GS       2) What is your view of the II's current status and future?
A2GS       GA
VCooper    I feel the IIGS has a bright future or I wouldnt be here...  We've
           made a
VCooper    substancial financial investment in taking over these products and
           setting
VCooper    up a company to support and maintain them.  Obviously we wouldnt
           have done
VCooper    this if we didnt feel it was going to be worthwhile in the long
           run.
VCooper    GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Omega Man, you have the floor now...
Omega Man  does/will the resource editor allow you to save sound and picture
           resources? GA
SteveB     That would be nice!
Omega Man  :)
VCooper    Right now it doesnt.  We are in the process of deciding what we
           want to do with
VCooper    the resource editor.  I'm not sure if we should enhance it to
           handle many 
VCooper    different types of resources, or if we couldnt better spend the
           time and
VCooper    resources in enhancing the compiler so that it can handle OMF
           files from
VCooper    outside sources and other options that it now doesnt have.  As
           with any 
VCooper    development company our resources are limited.  It might be better
           for us to
VCooper    leave high level resource editing and creation to speciality
           products such
VCooper    as Genesys and others and stick to the compilers.  What we have
           now is enough
VCooper    to get a basic program up and running.  It doesnt handle
           everything, and could
VCooper    probably use a small bit of enhancing, but I doubt you'll ever see
           anything
VCooper    from us that is as indepth as Genesys is in handling resource
           generation.
VCooper    GA
Omega Man  ga Froo
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Frooddude, you have the floor now...GA...
Frooddude  Ok.... Vince, who are the people behind the "We" you have been
           speaking of?
VCooper    Well, at this time the people making the decisions are myself and
           a couple of
VCooper    folks that have invested money.  I've also sent offers to a couple
           of 
VCooper    programmers that I hope to bring online soon to work on our linker
           and on our
VCooper    Basic product.  right now I'm doing all of the programming and
           support and
VCooper    that is just a bit to much for one guy to handle.  We also have a
           couple of
VCooper    girls that work here in the office handling phone calls and paper
           work so that
VCooper    I dont screw things up too bad... :)
Frooddude  Ok, thanks.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Michael, you have the floor now...GA...
Michael515 Will you have a Direct Connect area in ADV soon?
VCooper    We've spoken to Dave about that and some things are working behind
           the scenes
VCooper    for online support here on AO.
VCooper    GA
VCooper    (Right now you can catch us in the Pascal folder in the Let's
           Discuss area.) GA
AFL Dyfet  Hmm...there are a few things in the works, yes ;)...
Shadow100  About when will v1.0 be ready to send out and how much will that
           small upgrade 
Shadow100  be.
VCooper    1.0 is already shipping, sans nice looking labels.  The support
           program costs
VCooper    $29.95 for Pascal customers and $19.95 for Basic customers.  There
           are
VCooper    some letters containing information about what is going on being
           mailed out
VCooper    to all of TML's former clients, although this is moving a little
           slower than
VCooper    we would like.  If you're really curious we have posted the
           letters here online
VCooper    in the Pascal folder, inside a folder titled News From Complete
           Technology.
VCooper    GA
Shadow100  Thanks.
Kerry C2   Whats will v2.0 offer over the current v1.0 of Pascal?
VCooper    2.0 will offer a linker that allows you to link asm and c
           subroutines to
VCooper    your Pascal programs, or generates Pascal files that can be linked
           to your
VCooper    asm or C programs.  It will also offer some enhancement in the
           resource 
VCooper    editor although as I stated these enhancements will not be
           bringing it inline
VCooper    with some of the resource specific products like Genesys.
VCooper    It will also correct some problems that we have found to be our
           fault in
VCooper    the existing editor and compiler.
VCooper    (By our fault I mean we are now accepting responsibility for
           things that
VCooper    were wrong in the origional release which of course we didnt
           write.)
VCooper    GA
AFL Dyfet  Go ahead Omega Man...
Omega Man  will the 2.0 upgrade be free (to 1.0 users)? 
VCooper    We're not sure what the price will be at this time.  Please
           understand that
VCooper    you are not buying version 1.0.  It is simply thrown in as an
           enducement to
VCooper    get folks to join the support program.
VCooper    We will ONLY offer future updates and upgrades to those that do
           join the
VCooper    support system.  This is the only manner in which we can stay in
           business
VCooper    and support thousands of people that didnt purchase software from
           our company.
VCooper    Kind of a drag I know, but also a fact of business life...
VCooper    GA
Omega Man  sounds cool, :)  ...ga...
Kerry C2   Do you have plans for improving the size of source code files
           generated
Kerry C2   by the compiler, such as an optimizer in future versions?
VCooper    Once we have improved the linker then we'll look at licensing some
           things that
VCooper    will make this possible.  A few things that are not possible now
           will become
VCooper    reality once we have a new linker in the system.  There are
           existing utilities
VCooper    that can be used to decrese the size of the load files and such...
            I've
VCooper    never tried to use what is there now, so I cant say for sure if
           they work or
VCooper    not on what the compiler system is generating right now.  Some of
           you may 
VCooper    have given it a try and may be able to answer this.  This is not
           an area that I
VCooper    have checked out in depth yet.  There were too many aligators in
           the swamp for
VCooper    me to look at the ducks...  :)
VCooper    GA
Kerry C2   Thanks.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, RobertHess, you have the floor now...
RobertHess I realize that at this time, you have your hands full, but is
           there a
RobertHess glimmer in your eye of future products and directions? Do you see
           your
RobertHess company just being in the develpment tools business, or might
           you
RobertHess also look towards 'general' applications as well? GA
VCooper    Right now we're just looking at development tools and utilites. 
           Since we
VCooper    came into being with an existing product line, something most
           companies dont do
VCooper    we havent taken a long look at application programs or anything
           like that
VCooper    yet.  I never say never, but its not in the business plan right
           now.
VCooper    We do plan to look at another language or an assembler, but that's
           still many
VCooper    months away.
VCooper    GA
RobertHess Thanks, (looking forward to a Modula-2 :-) GA
VCooper    ( I thought someone just released a Modula-2, but I may be
           wrong..)
AFL Dyfet  Okay SteveB, you have the floor now...
SteveB     Ok-- I noticed AWSOME pastinng in CP v1.0. The Cutting still
           stinks, thought..
SteveB     Are you planning to fix this? :)
SteveB     (Dumb Question :)
VCooper    Yes, however, we're waiting to see what, if any, corrections are
           in the
VCooper    next version of system software.  CP 1.0 cuts and deletes much
           better than 
VCooper    its counter part, Pascal II, however, we and our beta testers
           admit there are
VCooper    still some problems there with large chunks.  We havent found any
           scrollbar
VCooper    freezing or any of the other problems, however, at least in 98% of
           all cases.
SteveB     I'm a Beta tester :)
SteveB     GA- Thanks :)
VCooper    I wont say they wont ever freeze, but nothing like what was in the
           original
VCooper    releases of this software.  We did find some problems there with
           the way the
VCooper    program was coded and corrected them.
VCooper    GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay, go ahead Omega Man...
Omega Man  Did you correct the problem with the Case statements (they couldnt
           handle multiple numbers.. like Case numer of 45..100
VCooper    that is not a bug, but it is the way this particular
           implimentation works.
VCooper    That IS something we are looking at changing, but I've not even
           looked at
VCooper    the source code in that part of the compiler yet.  If we can get
           to it, we'll
VCooper    handle that in the 2.0 release.
VCooper    You can code around that problem, and if you're having trouble
           send me some
VCooper    email and I'll get you some code fragments that show you how to
           can work around
VCooper    the limitation.
VCooper    GA
RobertHess First a comment on the previous question... case ranges are not
           part
RobertHess of 'standard' pascal, but are implemented by a couple compilers.
RobertHess ...and TML 'did' document theirs as being one of them... now my
           ?
RobertHess Vince, I assume that many of your 'support' questions are still
           in
RobertHess the relm of 'ToolBox' programming on the GS, rather then actual
RobertHess problems with your product. What ideas or methods do you have
           for
RobertHess dealing with this? How much of a burden is this proving on your
RobertHess overall support efforts? GA
VCooper    Well, I'd like to see some of the book publishers update their
           existing 
VCooper    books and I'd like to see some new books done on programming with
           resources.
VCooper    However, right now, most of the questions we're getting are on how
           to deal
VCooper    with and get around some of the problems that were in the original
           release of
VCooper    the compiler.  I believe with our first update, and our future
           upgrade, we
VCooper    will correct that and go back to answering general programming
           type questions.
VCooper    I'd MUCH rather answer those types of questions even though they
           dont really
VCooper    have anything to do with the tool being used to create the
           program...  :)
VCooper    GA
RobertHess :-> yeah, I know what you mean... GA
AFL Dyfet  Okay Kerry, GA...And then Steve will have the last Q for
           tonight...
Kerry C2   I've never been able to get Real2Integer in TMLUtils library to
           work correctly,
Kerry C2   has this/will this bug/feature be fixed in future versions?
VCooper    It is a bug, and yes, we'll fix that in 2.0.
VCooper    Right now you can call SANE and use a call that will accomplish
           much the
VCooper    same thing.
VCooper    GA
Kerry C2   I use SANE to do the conversions.
SteveB     Will you fix the Resoource Editor's problem of messing up Resource
           files when..
SteveB     you edit a menu resource? Is this a bug? :)
VCooper    It's a bug, but we're not absolutely sure whos...  Right now we
           are aware of
VCooper    some problems in the Resource Manager that cause trouble when you
           are changing
VCooper    the size of a resource which is what happens when you edit a menu
           with our
VCooper    editor.  I'm sure some of the problem is also in CP's code.  We'll
           be fixing
VCooper    this as soon as we get some updated system software and get the
           word that
VCooper    the problem we know about in the Resource Manager has been
           fixed.
Dave Lyons Steve, what sort of messing-up happens?
SteveB     When executing the Progam, I get an error "Unable to open Resource
           Fork".
SteveB     And then some Error numbers.
Kerry C2   Whenever I edit menu resources, the rest of the file becomes
           corrupted
Kerry C2   and useless.  If you don't use menu resources you should be ok
           now.
VCooper    There are some other problems with some things being off in  the
           resource
VCooper    editor that ARE our fault and only our fault that we will be
           repairing soon.
VCooper    We'll get the word out to our customers in the support program as
           soon as 
VCooper    something is done.
VCooper    GA
SteveB     Thanks :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I would like to thank our guest, Vince, for attending
           tonight....it was
AFL Dyfet  much good news you have brought....
AFL Dyfet  I know you need to leave shortly, so if you have any closing
           comments?
VCooper    Not really... Just would like to say that it has been a real
           pleasure to 
VCooper    talk to everyone and if you have further questions for me you're
           welcome to
VCooper    post them in the Pascal folder here in the Let's Discuss area.  I
           check that
VCooper    area a couple of times daily and answer any questions.  Also for
           those that
VCooper    are interested we are also doing some work on the manual and will
           be making
VCooper    some improvements there.  Wont do those of you that already have
           it much good,
VCooper    but future people that use the product wont go through the same
           cold sweats 
VCooper    that some of you did... :)
VCooper    Thanks folks!  its been a real pleasure!
Kerry C2   Thanks for your time and help, and good luck!!
AFA Gary J Thanks, Vince!
VCooper    Good night, everyone!
