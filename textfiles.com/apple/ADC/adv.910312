Topic:  Beginner's Night (and open discussion)
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet)


AFL Dyfet  Is there anything we can help you with tonight, Joel?  Hi WankerL
           :)
JoelH4     I have a question to pose, anyone know anything about "APPLE
           3's"
JoelH4     I have a friend with one, & little practical knowledge
AFL Dyfet  Give Joel a little breathing space there people :)....What kind of
           Apple III
AFL Dyfet  question do you have/
Matt DTS   I have one in my office.  Shame I don't have a monitor (or a power
           cord, or any disks, etc.).
WinkieJim  Matt, using as a doorstop are we? :) :)
AFL Dyfet  There is an active national Apple /// users group....I would
           suggest sending
AFL Dyfet  mail to 'Lavona' to find out more about it.
JoelH4     How much ProDOS/DOS 3.3 software will/won't work on one, 
AFL Dyfet  I do not know how well the II emulation mode works off-hand.....
WinkieJim  II emulation is II+ emulation only...
AFL Dyfet  If I recall, I think it used a special pre-boot disk, which would
           mean you
AFL Dyfet  could then maybe boot ProDOS after it...however, it does not
           support 80 columns
AFL Dyfet  or any other /// stuff in emulation mode...
WinkieJim  if it'll run on a II+ it should run on the /// in emulation mode
JoelH4     It does emulate a 2, I'm an old time 2e user
AFA Gary J Right, it won't emulate a IIe.
AFA Gary J (Or a Macintosh, for that matter :)
WinkieJim  I my memory serves me there is a add-on card fro the /// to allow
           it
WinkieJim  to run IIe software...but Lavona would know more...
JoelH4     Ha Ha, but a MAC can emulate us, now
Matt DTS   Macintoshes have been "emulating" Apple IIs for many years.  But
           the Apple IIe Card for the Macintosh
Matt DTS   LC is NOT "emulation".  It's a full-blown Apple IIe that runs in a
           Macintosh environment.
Matt DTS   (It just doesn't have any IIe slots.  :)
WinkieJim  The little brother always tries to emulate it's old and wiser
           brother :) :)
AFA Gary J :)
AFA Parik  (there is also trackstar for ibm/amiga, and a II+ software
           emulator for ibm/amiga/st).
JoelH4     thanks for the infomation, it will get me started Apple/// "ing"
AFA Gary J Apple /// forever!  
AFA Gary J (oops.  Old macro :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, who else has a question for tonight?
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Scott, go ahead, you have the floor now...
DevScott   I've been calling some mail order places for Orca/C and they
DevScott   tell me that it's not available due to an upgrade.
DevScott   Is this true?
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   Something like that.  The Byte Works is in the middle of updating
           the ORCA/C system, and they may
Matt DTS   not be filling new orders pending the imminent upgrade.  You could
           find out for sure by calling...
Matt DTS   ...the Byte Works, at (505) 898-8183 (New Mexico/Mountain time
           zone).  GA.
DevScott   Thanks...supposedly it will be more expensive too :(
AFL Dyfet  GA Winkie...
WinkieJim  or Byte Works is online here too.
AFA Gary J (Keyword BYTEWORKS)
DevScott   Done...
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I guess we're back to you Winkie :)
WinkieJim  Does anyone know if there is anything other than REZ that will
           convert a
WinkieJim  OMF file into a CODE resource and the CDev CODE resource?
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   Hmm...I believe that Richard Bennet's "Reslin" will do it, and
           LLRE might.  GA.
AFL Dyfet  GA Jonah...
WinkieJim  Mmm I have reslin...will have to take another look at it...
ShanoJ     Ya, I've used LLRE to do it.... Can't you also use Genesys--I know
           you can
ShanoJ     Export, but I think there's also an Import menu item in the latest
           version.
WinkieJim  Genesys, doesn't seem to have a way of doing it...
AFL Dyfet  There is an upgrade for Genesys now...
WinkieJim  Well, They havn't sent me 1.2 yet so I'll have to get on
           them...they
WinkieJim  seem to keep forgetting I was a bata tester :)
WinkieJim  Maybe I didn't find enough bugs :)
ShanoJ     Ya, 1.2 can do it, I think...
WinkieJim  ga...
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I guess we are ready for wind...ga :)
Windrider5 I have been looking at some sample C code (from Apple) eg. Dart
           and 
Windrider5 they use the function SaveDB() and restoreDB() quite a bit.  Is
           it
Windrider5 necessary to use these functions?
AFL Dyfet  Go ahead Dave...
Dave Lyons Yes!  You have to set and restore the 65816's Data Bank Register
           (DBR, or sometimes called just "B")
Dave Lyons whenever you have a C function that can get called without the B
           register already set to the bank
Dave Lyons containing your global non-array variables (the ~globals segment
           of your program).
Dave Lyons When your C program starts up, it sets B properly, and at the "top
           level" of your code you never have
Dave Lyons to worry about it.  But when the Toolbox *calls you*, like for a
           window-draw routine, the B register
Dave Lyons is not guaranteed to be set how your C code expects it.  In cases
           like that, you have to make *sure*
Dave Lyons you use -no- global variables anywhere in the routine, even
           indirectly by calling other functions,
Dave Lyons or you have to use SaveDB and RestoreDB.
Dave Lyons ga
Dave Lyons (In some languages you have a "LongGlobals" option you can turn on
           instead.)
Windrider5 Is this done at the beginning and end of the program
Windrider5 or for each routine?
Dave Lyons The START.ROOT/etc code does it at the beginning of your whole
           program--
Dave Lyons there's just one set of globals.
AFL Dyfet  Do we have any other questions out there for tonight?
AFL Dyfet  Okay, go ahead Jonah...
ShanoJ     Okay, this weekend I wrote a loaded driver for internal modems
           (like my trusty
ShanoJ     DataLink 2400). In testing it with Joe Wankerl's Transfusion NDA,
           I ran into
JWankerl   :-)
ShanoJ     some problems. The main one goes something like this: Joe wrote
           his program to
ShanoJ     work with the default driver for EXTERNAL modems. To read
           characters, he calls
ShanoJ     DStatus, then looks at the no-wait mode bit of the statusWord. If
           it's set, he
ShanoJ     calls ReadGS on one byte of memory to get a character. He loops
           through this
ShanoJ     DStatus/ReadGS until the no-wait mode flag goes false. Now, in
           my
ShanoJ     understanding, the no-wait mode flag could be set by the
           application to 
ShanoJ     whatever the programmer liked, so that the program would operate
           in the mode it
ShanoJ     wanted. However, the driver seems to be toggling it back and
           forth! Which one
ShanoJ     is right? Matt? :)
Matt DTS   What "no-wait mode flag"?
ShanoJ     In the statusWord, returned by DStatus, bit position 0x0020.
WinkieJim  ha! We finaly stumped Matt! :)
Matt DTS   Nononononononono.
ShanoJ     (Top of page 129 in the AW ref)
Matt DTS   That bit is valid for generated drivers only - if it's set,
           there's a character waiting.
Matt DTS   It does *not* represent no-wait mode, and that diagram should have
           been corrected in a recent
JWankerl   I tried to tell ya that, Jonah.  :-)
Matt DTS   Technical Note (checking to see when it came out...)
ShanoJ     Shut up, Joe... :)
AFA Gary J :)
Matt DTS   I think it will be in this month's batch, but we did talk about it
           in a conference on here earlier.
Matt DTS   You get the wait-mode status by calling GetWaitStatus, not by
           looking in the general status
Matt DTS   word.  (These diagrams are all throughout GS/OS Ref. and GS/OS
           Driver Ref., and it was very difficult
Matt DTS   trying to catch the same error in all the places the diagram was
           included!).  So...
Matt DTS   ...in light of this previously-hidden information, what is in fact
           the problem?
ShanoJ     (So it's Joe's fault... :)
AFL Dyfet  Strange, it's snowing and thundering...and yes, Matt, I recall the
           prev. conf
AFL Dyfet  where this had been discussed...
ShanoJ     Okay, that clears it up. My driver just sets that flag to 0, and I
           rewrite 
ShanoJ     Joe's program to work properly... :)
Matt DTS   STOP!
Dave Lyons Matt, I'm lost--he wants to know if there are any characters
           waiting.  Isn't that bit in the general
Dave Lyons status??
Matt DTS   (Oh, wait.  No, never mind.  go ahead.  :)
Matt DTS   Dave:  Yes, for generated drivers.  He just thought it was a
           no-wait mode bit.  Jonah didn't
Matt DTS   understand why Joe's program did what it did.  (GA)
ShanoJ     Or is it what Dave said? That's the way I have it working now...
ShanoJ     So, can my loaded driver use that bit as a 'character waiting'
           bit?
Matt DTS   Yes, you can, and you're encouraged to...but programs can't expect
           all loaded character drivers
Matt DTS   to respect that bit since it wasn't defined until 5.0.
ShanoJ     (and even then... :)
ShanoJ     Okay, so I use that bit, Joe doesn't have to rewrite anything, and
           we'll let
ShanoJ     OTHER people worry about THEIR drivers not working... :) I can
           live with
ShanoJ     that. :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I guess Winkie is next...ga Winkie...
WinkieJim  Is there a max hight for Cdev icons, the max width is 28 but what
           about hight?
AFL Dyfet  Height...hmmm....Ga Matt...
Matt DTS   Well, Dave needs to answer this, but I believe a maximum height
           such that the icon appears square is
Matt DTS   a safe bet.  Dave?
AFL Dyfet  :)
A2GS       Dave seems to be out at the moment....Hey DAVE, anyone HOME???? 
           :-)
WinkieJim  Earth to Dave...
AFA Gary J He's getting more M&M's?
Dave Lyons Oh, I'm here...
A2GS       He's here in handle but not (apparently) in mind  :)
Matt DTS   (Cut him some slack, he's been working hard -- but not too much
           slack.  :)
AFA Gary J :)
WinkieJim  I get like that sometimes GS :)
AFL Dyfet  Must not have locked down his handle...
Dave Lyons Uh, sticking with the de-facto standards
Dave Lyons for CDev icons would be good...the Control Panel doesn't go out of
           its way to figure out how
Dave Lyons tall the icons are, it just draws them in the list.  I think most
           of them are 20, and some are shorter
Dave Lyons Basically, if it works fine in the present Control Panel icon
           list, you should be fine.
Dave Lyons (ga)
AFL Dyfet  Sounds like a reasonable response :)
WinkieJim  ok, thanks...
AFL Dyfet  Okay, anyone next?
AFL Dyfet  Go ahead Jonah...
ShanoJ     Okay, this is a silly one, but in the abscence of any REAL
           questions... :)
ShanoJ     How on EARTH do you manage to set the extra 8 KIND bits that APW
           can't touch
ShanoJ     when it gives the default segment a name of "            ". Doug's
           OMF util
ShanoJ     don't work too well with that.... :(
Dave Lyons (Block.Warden)
Matt DTS   Uh...won't LinkIIgs do it for you?
ShanoJ     Well, the added complication is that I've got a library that I
           link in that
ShanoJ     has all of it's code in a separate segment (called HelpLib) PLUS a
           few routines
ShanoJ     in the main source in an AuxSeg segment. Doing it with LinkIIgs
           ran into the
ShanoJ     same problem with the "     " name again. (BTW, CAN you do it with
           a block
ShanoJ     editor? I tried that, too, and it didn't work... Then again, you
           never know 
ShanoJ     with me... :)
Matt DTS   Who is naming the segment "       "?
ShanoJ     APW gives the default segment (ie. MyProg START) a segment name of
           "        ".
Dave Lyons (I second Matt's question.  Yes, you can do Anything in a block
           editor.)
AFA Gary J Yeah, Jonah, Why not just name the "      " segment to
           something.
ShanoJ     Well, I thought of that, but there are over 200 procedures, and I
           didn't want
ShanoJ     to spend the time if there was an easier way to do it... :)
AFA Gary J OIC :)
Matt DTS   Huh?  It doesn't do that to me, does it?  (checking...)
AFA Gary J (Search for "start" a zillion times, eh? :)
ShanoJ     (Then again, it would have taken half the time I've now spent
           playing around
ShanoJ     to just give that segment a name... But think of the great
           LEARNING I'm doing!
ShanoJ     Nope, that doesn't work. Nope, that doesn't either. Nor that. etc.
           :)
AFA Gary J What are you trying to set it to?  (The KIND field, that is)
ShanoJ     Now, if there were a search for Start but not Start   AuxCode,
           then we'd be
ShanoJ     in business... :)
Matt DTS   Hmm...it just says "Segment name :", so I can't tell how many
           blanks there are.  I'll try redirecting
Matt DTS   to a file...
JWankerl   There should be 10 blanks, I believe.
JWankerl   (spaces, blanks... same difference)
ShanoJ     (Must be nice to have another computer to play with while you're
           online... :)
Matt DTS   Ten spaces, sure enough.  Well, that bites.
JWankerl   Hey, I was right!  HA HA!
ShanoJ     <-- finally found a real problem!! :)
Matt DTS   Jonah:  What happens if you use the option in LinkIIgs:  -a "     
               "="main"?

AFL Dyfet  GA A2...
A2GS       Thanx....First of all, do the new Apple printers only except "true
           type" for
A2GS       printing?  (I have a followup Q based on the answer to this one)
AFL Dyfet  That's a little more in the scope of AHW than here :)....GA Winkie
           AFTER Matt..
Matt DTS   Oh, we're on the new printers:  !
WinkieJim  StyleWriter is described as 'Designed for Macintosh only'
A2GS       That's how Apple describe everything
AFA Gary J (boo)
WinkieJim  LaserWriter LS is described as 'Not Apple II compatible at this
           time'
Matt DTS   Uh...!
A2GS       :-)
WinkieJim  so I'd guess there is hope for the LS
WinkieJim  ga only my opinon...
Pixies     yeah but that's how apple labels its customers too.. "not apple II
           compatible
Pixies     at this time"
A2GS       Is the Stylewriter the Inkjet, $599 printer?
Matt DTS   Now, for printers:
Matt DTS   StyleWriter and Personal LaserWriter LS (PLLS) were clearly
           designed for the broader Mac market, but..
A2GS       there's a BUT
Matt DTS   ...perhaps could be made to work on an Apple II.  However, it will
           not be something a user can do.
Matt DTS   Explanation:
Matt DTS   StyleWriter communicates only at 57,600 baud and does not have any
           character-based firmware built-in.
Matt DTS   In other words, the standard Apple II method of sending "a"
           through the printer port will not work
Matt DTS   with StyleWriter - it needs more hardware to do that.  It only
           knows how to print dots, which is why
Matt DTS   it's such a good match for TrueType.
A2GS       oh...
Matt DTS   The PLLS communicates at about 909,000 baud, externally clocked,
           and expects all images coming
Matt DTS   in to be compressed with a compression algorithm that it
           decompresses in *hardware*.  It has no
Matt DTS   PostScript or networking support, making it in the same class as
           the SC LaserWriters (requires mucho
Matt DTS   imaging and big communications to print).  So, that's the story. 
           GA.
A2GS       I have a second Q...unrelated to the previous...
Pixies     now if i could run AOL at that speed i'd be a shoe in at
           trivia..
WinkieJim  Pixies, didn't you get your 909,0000 baud upgrade? :)
Pixies     missed it.
A2GS       Just out of Curiosity....The GS cannot be used as a Server, right?
            Why not?
WinkieJim  a2Gs, no server software for GS
JWankerl   A2GS:  It can be used... just wait ;-)
A2GS       I know....but are there any (technical reasons), why not?
Matt DTS   A2GS -- because we chose not to write server software for it,
           mostly.
JWankerl   Yah - Apple's technical reason #1 - "The Apple IIGS is too slow"
A2GS       That's what I thought...:-(
Matt DTS   Joe, don't put words in our mouth.  The IIgs is kind of slow, but
           it could be done with hardware.
Matt DTS   Mostly, a server is a very, very complicated and secure program
           that takes a while to bullet-proof,
Matt DTS   and after AppleShare 2.0 they chose not to duplicate that effort
           for another platform.  GA.
A2GS       So why not do it....Apple can't say that there isn't a market for
           it....
A2GS       I know of PLENTY of schools AND small businesses (believe it or
           not) who would
A2GS       love to use a GS as a Server.
WinkieJim  A2GS, I'd rather put the GS to real use and let the mac sit in the
           corner :)
AFA Gary J (BUT, you're still forced to buy the mac, Winkie)
A2GS       True...but I'd like to avoid the Mac as much as possible....the
           more people
A2GS       see of what the Mac can do and of the FEW things the GS can't
           do...only hurts
A2GS       the GS.
Matt DTS   A2GS:  We knew people would want it, but it's a significant
           development effort we chose not to do.
Matt DTS   Businesses have to make those decisions sometimes.  GA.

AFL Dyfet  Okay, I guess Pixies is next...go ahead :)....
Pixies     could someone explain the use of a disassembler.. e.g. can i take
           a commercial
Pixies     program or something online, disassemble it and examine how it is
           linked 
Pixies     together.. I have a pascal basis, so would that be of any use??
Pixies     I guess if Orca's offering half price programs w/ a free Pascal
           upgrade i can
Pixies     afford a disassembler for $25
AFA Gary J Ok, Jonah, are you answering Pixies?  GA
ShanoJ     Pixies: Well, with a disasm, you can load in ANY program (pretty
           much--the FTA
ShanoJ     ones are often an exception) and see the code that makes it work.
           HOWEVER, the
ShanoJ     code will be displayed in Assembly, which looks NOTHING like
           Pascal. If you
ShanoJ     ONLY know Pascal, then ORCA/Diss isn't going to be of much use to
           you.
JWankerl   Yah, you gotta be kind of knowledgable about assembly to figure
           out how Pascal
JWankerl   is generating the code.
Pixies     ok, thanks.. well i'll have to see whatelse byteworks is
           offering..
AFA Gary J Also, disassemblers create an actual source file.  You have to be
           somewhat
AFA Gary J knowledgeable about assembly in order to make a successful
           disassembly as well.
AFA Gary J (i.e. you have to know when something looks like data, and when
           it looks like
Pixies     yeah, definately not for me..
AFA Gary J code, and that sort of thing).  If you're just looking to explore
           some code,
AFA Gary J then you can use the monitor, or a more sophisticated program
           (nudge Dave :)
AFA Gary J like Nifty List to list through a program that's loaded into
           memory, and see
AFA Gary J what it's made of.
WinkieJim  Gee, now Gary is doing Dave's comercials :) :)
AFA Gary J :)
Dave Lyons :)
Pixies     is nifty list on AOL.. or is it commercial?
AFA Gary J Nifty List is shareware, on AOL
Dave Lyons Shareware, in ADV and AUT libraries.
WinkieJim  GAry, if I give you a buck, will you promote Super Info?
AFA Gary J :)
A2GS       It's commercially available on AOL  :-)
Pixies     hmm. maybe i'll check it out..
AFA Gary J There are other utilities for looking at how programs are
           "built", such as
AFA Gary J DUMPOBJ, and such.
ShanoJ     NiftyList is second only to GSBug (ORCA/Diss is third... :)
A2GS       GSBug is GREAT
AFA Gary J (I think I'd put GSBug as a REAL CLOSE second to Nifty List, in
           my book :)
Matt DTS   Yeah, Gary, but how much coding do you do?  :)
AFA Gary J I do a fair share of coding, but I use Nifty List to get a clear
           picture of
AFA Gary J where I'm at prior to finishing things off with GSBug :)
A2GS       How about putting them both First and Orca/Diss second?
JWankerl   As soon as GSBug does imbedded names in object code it'll be
           better than NL.
JWankerl   (for tracking down bugs, that is)
Dave Lyons Gee Joe, then I guess I'll have to not put that in. :-) :-)
Dave Lyons (Don't worry, yeah, GSBug will support imbedded names someday.)
ShanoJ     (Naw, I need to step through the code to see how it works
           sometimes... )
A2GS       Or how about making them all First and the GS' monitor second...
A2GS       or how about....you get the point
JWankerl   Dave:  You'd better!!!!  ;-)
Pixies     ok, thanks.. for $10 i think i'll check it out..:)

Pixies     has anyone here seen the new pascal upgrade? like a pre-release
           version??
JWankerl   Yah, we got ahold of the newest ORCA/Pascal - it should be
           shipping to
JWankerl   registered users any week now.
Pixies     what's your opinion of the new version JW
JWankerl   Pixies:  I really haven't used it yet, so I can't say.  Sorry.
Pixies     do you know if the char bug is fixed.. that creates a big problem
           for most
Pixies     of the programs i write for pascal class..
JWankerl   Pixies:  I really dunno about it.

A2GS       BTW  Anyone know what the story is on the Animation
           Toolset??????????
Matt DTS   A2GS:  You can try asking a question and we can try answering
           it..............
A2GS       When will it be available?
AFA Gary J :)
A2GS       How's that?
ShanoJ     Or even WILL it be available?
A2GS       (2 questions  :)
Matt DTS   Not for a while.  Development was not as advanced as the
           KansasFest presentation implied.  (Sorry.)
A2GS       ok....I heard a rumor about Apple having a "Game Evanglist"...any
           truth to it?
A2GS       (that you know of)
Matt DTS   Plans call for its inclusion in future system software, but I
           don't know about any availability
Matt DTS   before that.  Evangelism (read traditional, Mac evangelism) now
           does have a game evangelist, I believe
Matt DTS   it is Craig Fryar.
A2GS       Any idea what he's Evanglising???
A2GS       other then the Mac?
Matt DTS   Not that I can talk about, sorry.  (And this is MACINTOSH
           Evangelism - I said that!)
A2GS       oh...sorry
Matt DTS   What do you expect a Mac evangelist to evangelize?
AFA Gary J Certainly not Apple II's :(
Matt DTS   Nope...that's Rob Barnes's job.  :)
A2GS       :)
A2GS       Like the GS is just rolling in Games  :)
A2GS       :(
AFA Gary J It does have some good ones, though. 
A2GS       Yeah...but it sure could use a heck of a lot more.....We don't
           even have
A2GS       SimCity....it's ridiculous...Apple even used that fact (or was it
           SimEarth)
A2GS       in there latest cruddy ad...knocking the II in InCider.
JWankerl   Yah, like Rastan -- too bad it can't be found anymore.
AFA Gary J Yeah, exactly the title on my mind, JWankerl
ShanoJ     How long did Rastan sell for? Two months or something? Jeez...
           :(
A2GS       Yeah.....Isn't anyone on the Apple II side wondering why there
           isn't an
A2GS       Apple II Games Eavnglist????
Matt DTS   A2GS:  No.  We've just gotten an Apple II evangelist since the
           first of the year.
Matt DTS   Given that we have exactly one evangelist, hiring a second one
           just for games seems a bit unwarranted.
A2GS       What does one have to do with other?
A2GS       Apple seems to think Games are important otherwise they wouldn't
           have opened
A2GS       thew position for a guy in the Mac section.
Matt DTS   A2GS:  Perhaps, but game developers have shrunk from the Mac even
           more than from the Apple II in
Matt DTS   recent years.  The few out there have been good, but not that many
           have been written.
A2GS       If that's the case how come the software store I work at just
           expanded the
A2GS       Games section for the Mac...while absolutely NOTHING new has come
           out for
A2GS       the GS in months.
Matt DTS   The IIgs software market is currently more depressed than the Mac
           software market, and hopefully
Matt DTS   our evangelist will be able to do something about it.  But
           considering all the market segments out
Matt DTS   there (education, consumer, productivity, utility, multimedia,
           etc.) I personally rate games a little
Matt DTS   lower on the totem pole than you do.
JWankerl   Ask the software publishers, A2GS... I really dunno.
A2GS       There are FAR fewer games being written for the GS then for the
           Mac....and
A2GS       that's a FACT.
A2GS       The GS is doing GREAT in education and productivity is kind of
           weak on the GS
A2GS       but at least still exists and continues to enjoy new programs
           while Games and
A2GS       Music software are absolutely NILL on the GS.
A2GS       I hope the II Evanglist is successful....a lot rides on him.
Matt DTS   And if we can make the Apple II a bigger market force, those
           developers who didn't make any money
Matt DTS   last time they tried will probably come back.  But we're not going
           to impress any big publishes by
Matt DTS   calling around and saying "Write more games."
A2GS       No....but you won't impress ANYBODY if you don't call at all.
Matt DTS   We impress them with "We're doing this to make the Apple IIgs a
           good-selling computer platform that
Matt DTS   lots of people buy and use, and golly, look at this game
           capability and unexplored market segment..."
A2GS       The fact is....I don't know of many parents who buy GS's for there
           kids who
A2GS       don't take into account how much software there is for the machine
           (especially
A2GS       Game software) and if only a Teensy Tiny percent of all the
           software on the
A2GS       GS is games then something is VERY worng....the Fact is Games
           SHOULD (in a
A2GS       healthy machines market) be something like 30%-40% of all the
           software
A2GS       available for the machine.
Matt DTS   A2GS:  Maybe in terms of retail store shelf space, but not in
           terms of sales or available software.
Matt DTS   No argument there should be more, but the way to make more is not
           to promote the IIgs as a "game
Matt DTS   machine."  It's to move it in quantity and then let people
           discover the untapped game potential.
A2GS       AGREED
AFA Gary J I do agree that games can play a big part in attracting buyers in
           the mythical
AFA Gary J "home market", especially when kids are in the formula)
Matt DTS   (Maybe with some gentle nudging...)
AFA Gary J (And even when it's just Dad making the decision)
A2GS       How about some outright slugging  :)
A2GS       EA is FINALLY doing Chuck Yeager for the PC....took them long
           enough :)
ShanoJ     For the PC? What's it on now?
A2GS       The II (or at least it used to be)
A2GS       I don't think my store is even able to get it anymore.

AFA Gary J I have a question.  Does anyone know if using the hardware
           registers DIRECTLY
AFA Gary J for accessing the serial port on a IIGS will SIGNIFICANTLY speed
           up modem
AFA Gary J access over what the firmware will do?
A2GS       Probably not...although I don't know that for a fact.
AFA Gary J (Firmware (ugh) = go into emulation mode, etc.)
Matt DTS   Hmm...the firmware will go 19,200 baud, so I don't think so.
AFA Gary J I'm not sure if my bottlekneck is due to the modem through-put or
           just
AFA Gary J getting the characters from the modem to my program.
AFA Gary J (It slows down the playability of my game, significantly)
AFA Gary J :)
A2GS       That's what Makes "Prodigy" such a dream to use....the FAST screen
           updates :)
AFA Gary J I'll have to do some testing to see if my program is waiting for
           data at the 
AFA Gary J modem port, or not.

ShanoJ     Oh, I've got one--is it the firmware on the SSC that interprets
           the commands
ShanoJ     (ie. Ctrl-A 8B) or will writing to the registers on the card do it
           (it almost
ShanoJ     has to be the former, but I just wanna check.)
AFA Gary J Jonah:  It's the firmware.  (There's registers to do all the
           command stuff)
ShanoJ     Ya, that's what I thought.... Thanks Gary.

ShanoJ     Matt: I have to call modem (ie. SSC) firmware with FWEntry, right?
           (or write
ShanoJ     my own routine to do it).
AFA Gary J Firmware reference details a way to call firmware
AFA Gary J (i.e. going into emulation, etc.)
Matt DTS   We encourage you not to call $CnXX entries with FWEntry.  If you
           can use the GS/OS generated driver,
Matt DTS   please do.
ShanoJ     Right, that's what I thought (toldya, Joe... Jeez, trying to
           confuse me...:)

Matt DTS   There are two, count them two, count them again two kinds of
           drivers --
Matt DTS   character drivers and block drivers.  That's all GS/OS has.
JWankerl   Yes, but the device ID is A (character) and not 9 (modem)  (I
           think A is char)
ShanoJ     Ya, but the generated driver for an internal modem has a device ID
           of $0016
JWankerl   okay, so it's 16... I was wrong.
ShanoJ     (character device driver, generic) not $0009 (serial modem).
ShanoJ     So if you're writing a modem program, and looking for a modem
           driver, you don't
ShanoJ     find it! :(
Matt DTS   That's because the generation routines can't tell if it's a modem
           or just some generic character
Matt DTS   device.  Not enough information to identify it.
GSPlusDiz  I think you mean 'looking for a modem DEVICE'
A2GS       SUGGESTION:  Give a 2 hour detailed conference at the K-Fest on
           Drivers,
A2GS       complete with hand outs and source code...especially for Printer
           and Modem
A2GS       Drivers.
ShanoJ     Driver, device; same difference... :)
GSPlusDiz  Sorta :)
Matt DTS   A2GS:  We did, last year.  :)
A2GS       I know I was there  :)
Matt DTS   We didn't give out sample character driver source, but we held the
           session.
A2GS       But I'm still VERY lost on the whole thing  :(
Matt DTS   And it's hard to do that session, because there are about 5
           different kinds of drivers, and everyone
Matt DTS   thinks the kind they're interested in is "GS/OS drivers".  ("
ShanoJ     So what does that leave us doing, Matt? Should the modem prog look
           for a 
Matt DTS   ("Well, I booted GS/OS, so I want a GS/OS Printer Driver for my
           LaserJet.")
ShanoJ     "Character device driver (generic)" as well as a serial modem?
GSPlusDiz  Well then, how about a detailed series of articles on drivers in
           GS+?
A2GS       There's an Idea....I just don't wanna have to wait 6 month's (3
           issues) till
A2GS       I have all the necessary info.
GSPlusDiz  Better than waiting for 5 KFests!
A2GS       True...but one detailed K-Fest would ALSO be very productive.
AFA Gary J I'd say that it should use the serial modem if it finds it
           (first), and then
AFA Gary J go to the generic if it has to.
Matt DTS   If you find more than one character device the user might want to
           use, why not let them choose?
AFA Gary J (But what Matt said is better :)
JWankerl   Well the thing is that the gs modem port automagically buffers its
           data but
JWankerl   the character drivers don't.
A2GS       automagically....nice typo  :)  (if it is a typo  :)
AFA Gary J Automatically?
AFA Gary J Does the driver set it to do it automatically, or is it derived
           from the port
AFA Gary J setting in the control panel?
JWankerl   automagically
GSPlusDiz  It's not a typo!
Matt DTS   No, no it doesn't - not unless the user automagically checked
           "Buffering: Yes" in the
Matt DTS   Control Panel...
JWankerl   Well I turn it on when I start up if it's on or not.  (So I cheat
           a bit :-)
AFA Gary J (Matt answered, thanks :)
AFA Gary J That's not automatic, then :)
AFA Gary J (Or even Automagic)
Matt DTS   And it's not going to solve your problems with Jonah's driver,
           either.
ShanoJ     Uggh... Looks like my driver wasn't as necessary as I thought...
           :(
AFA Gary J :)
JWankerl   Well what should I do, Matt?
Matt DTS   Well...I can't answer that until you ask a more specific
           question.
Matt DTS   (You guys understand now why we don't like doing phone support? 
           :)
GSPlusDiz  Actually, this WOULD be easier over the phone...
GSPlusDiz  Voice that is!
JWankerl   Well okay - how do I buffer the input of character devices?
ShanoJ     What SPECIFICALLY should Joe do, Matt? :)
ShanoJ     ...or at least faster....
AFA Gary J Matt, you mean like, "What's wrong with my program???!!
GSPlusDiz  ;)
Matt DTS   Easier for you guys, maybe, but not for the guy trying to answer
           the questions correctly and
Matt DTS   stay polite all at the same time!  (I have no tact, remember?)
JWankerl   Is there a way to make the driver call a routine whenever it gets
           a character?
Matt DTS   Well...ideally, a given driver won't lose characters if you don't
           poll it all the time.
Matt DTS   Ideally it queues the characters that come in until you send it a
           Driver_Flush command to empty the
Matt DTS   input/output buffers.
Matt DTS   If it won't do that, you the application may just be out of luck. 
           :(
JWankerl   What do you mean by don't poll it all the time?  Not check for
           characters?
Matt DTS   Yes.
JWankerl   Well then how am I supposed to know if there is a character
           waiting or not?
GSPlusDiz  Apparently you cant...
Matt DTS   You're missing a point somewhere, Joe.
JWankerl   I think so, too.
Matt DTS   Ideally:
Matt DTS   If you don't poll for characters, the driver queues them up until
           you're ready for them.
GSPlusDiz  I think I have it!
Matt DTS   So...for a loaded driver, all you have to do is read in no-wait
           mode and get the character (or check
Matt DTS   the bit for generated drivers).  That way you don't have to poll
           constantly to avoid losing characters
Matt DTS   Make sense?
JWankerl   Hmmmm... okay, so I make the DStatus call to see if there is a
           character
JWankerl   waiting and then read it if there is one?
Matt DTS   Yes, for generated drivers.
Matt DTS   For loaded drivers, try to put it into no-wait mode and then just
           read to get the character.  If there
Matt DTS   is no character waiting, it will return immediately with a
           transfer_count of zero.
JWankerl   But I lose characters that way.... they're not buffered using an
           internal
JWankerl   modem.
AFA Gary J They are if you set it up to do it.
JWankerl   How do I set it up to do it, Gary?
AFA Gary J You have to enable interrupts.
AFA Gary J There's a sample on how to do this in our library, I think.  It
           was Guy Rice's
AFA Gary J modem CDA (the name slips my mind).  He does this for a SSC, I
           believe.
ShanoJ     But he's not using a driver, Gary...
AFA Gary J Ooops, oh yeah.  Sorry.
Matt DTS   No...they are buffered if the loaded internal modem driver buffers
           them!
Matt DTS   (If they're generated drivers, you check the bit.)
JWankerl   So I need a driver that buffers the data, right?
AFA Gary J Very true.
Matt DTS   Joe:  Basically, yes!
ShanoJ     So, should I keep working on my driver, guys?!
JWankerl   ...and I'm back around to needing a driver.  :-)
JWankerl   Yep, Jonah.
WildSwan   Anybody mind if I ask a quick question (definitely off the
           topic?)
Matt DTS   Swan:  You can try, but no promises.
ShanoJ     Any other votes? :)
AFA Gary J GA, WildSwan (we're all off topic)
WildSwan   Well anyway: I'm getting back into programming the toolbox/IIgs
           and was
WildSwan   wondering about this APDA development tools... anybody know about
           them?
AFA Gary J What about them?
Matt DTS   Swan:  APDA sells several dozen Apple II development tools. 
           You'll have to be more specific.
WildSwan   For instance, I want to use resources, but what do I need to
           A:design them
WildSwan   and B: link them into the executable code
WildSwan   I've read about a linker LinkIIgs and Rez???
Matt DTS   Swan:  You'd probably be better off with a tool like Genesys if
           you don't know much about resources.
WildSwan   I'm still working off of just Orca/C and the stuff that came with
           that
ShanoJ     Swan: resources aren't linked into the code, they're attached to
           it. If you're
ShanoJ     new to this stuff, grab the new TB Ref and read about them (the
           tech notes are
ShanoJ     good place for info, too...)
WildSwan   (Sorry don't know all the technical terms, you'll have to excuse
           me, 
WildSwan   programming the IBM too long :) )
AFA Gary J You've made a good switch :)
ShanoJ     As for creating them, your best bet is Genesys, which is a
           commercial program
ShanoJ     from SSSi. You can also use the APDA tool Rez, or some of the
           shareware 
ShanoJ     resource editors in the ADV libraray.
WildSwan   I'm going to buy the TB refs over Spring Break and have slowing
           been downloadin
WildSwan   the tech notes
WildSwan   Yeah, I saw that-- what exactly comes with that?
WildSwan   Are they good resource editors, Jonah (by the way, like your
           programs :) )
AFA Gary J ORCA has a resource editor too, Design Master.
ShanoJ     Well, they're not in the same league as Genesys (and Design
           Master). These two
ShanoJ     programs allow you to DRAW your interface elements on the screen,
           then save
