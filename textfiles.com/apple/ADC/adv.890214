Topic: Apple II Assembly Language
Forum Leader: James Luther (AFL Jim)


AFL Jim    Do you all want protocol or can you guys stay on the subject? :)
Chaos 89   hi Dan
AFA Parik  no protocol.
Dan Burton Hi there
DennisDoms Yes :)
AFC DaveP  sounds like a threat
JSchober   NO! protocol... :)
AFL Marty  You know us, Jim :)
AFA Parik  Just say no...
AFL Jim    Is it Dan or Doug?
AFA Gary J Yes to protocol, Dennis?
Dave Lyons I vote no protocol, I think.
Republicn  no protocal
AFA Gary J I think??  :)
Dan Burton Its Dan Doug will be here later I think
AFL Marty  You do?
AFA Parik  therefore he assembles...
AFL Marty  What's the occasion? :)
Dave Lyons (Was this really a vote, or have you already decided?)  (Gary, I
           reserve the
Dave Lyons right to be sorry for my vote later.)
JSchober   hehehe
AFA Gary J :)
AFC DaveP  (I'm glad all this is going on...it'll be the only part I
           understand)
AFA Gary J I like that, Dave.
AFL Jim    Let's skip the protocol then. Tonight's scheduled topic is
           Assembly Language
AFL Jim    Anyone want to start off with a question?
AFC DaveP  this isn't PC??
AFL Marty  hahahahahaha
Republicn  How can I do a Bload from Prodos 8?  Can it be done easily?
JSchober   In assembly, Republican?  MLI READ calls... (OPEN, READ, CLOSE
           ...)
AFL Jim    The same way you did under DOS 3.3, except some parts of memory
           are protected.
Guy Rice   Huh?  The same way as DOS 3.3?  I don't think so...
AFA Parik  Does anyone know what the various annunciators do on the GS?  
AFA Gary J I think he means in assembly.
Republicn  It isn't any easier in Prodos then it is in DOS 3.3?
JSchober   They annunciate.
AFA Parik  enunciate... 
AFL Jim    From BASIC that is. You don't BLOAD from assembly...
Guy Rice   It's a LOT easier in ProDOS...
JSchober   Well, the MLI is far easier than the File Manager is, but the
           basic idea is the
Dave Lyons Are you using BASIC.SYSTEM, Republicn?
JSchober   same...
JSchober   (GMTA Guy)
Republicn  Dave, yes.
Dave Lyons And you want your BASIC program to do a BLOAD, then?
Matt DTS   Back (did I miss anything?)
Republicn  No, I want to do a Bload from assembly.
Mac III    sounds like you missed a lot
AFA Parik  We gossiped about you.
JSchober   Republican... then we were right in the first place.  You execute
           an MLI OPEN
JSchober   call, then READ, then CLOSE.  Just gotta make sure that you're not
           loading on
JSchober   top of memory reserved by ProDOS.  Do you have a book that
           indicates the MLI
Republicn  I need the Bload from assmebly because the program is for a //e
           and is going to
JSchober   command codes/parameters/etc?  (ie., Beneath Apple ProDOS, Apple
           ProDOS for
Republicn  use the Auxiliary memory to store data, and I am told that once
           you put stuff
JSchober   Programmers, etc...)
Republicn  in auxiliary that BASIC is written over, so the Bload must be from
           assembly.
Dave Lyons It's true that you can load stuff only into the main 64K using
           ProDOS; you'll
Republicn  No, I don't.  All the books I have are //gs assembly and this
           program is on a
Republicn  //e.
Dave Lyons have to have an assembly language routine to copy the data to
           auxiliary memroy,
Dave Lyons but you are free to BLOAD it from BASIC if you want
           (?CHR$(4);"BLOAD xxxxx" and
Dave Lyons then CALL a machine language routine to copy the data to aux
           mem).
Republicn  To move it to Auxiliary, I was going to use the AUXMOVE routine
           and I was told
JSchober   Oh.  Well, you'll really want to get some book on Advanced
           ProDOS...
Republicn  that that routine wrote over BASIC.
Republicn  I know I will.
Dave Lyons AUXMOVE does not write over BASIC; I don't know whether you'll be
           able to CALL
Republicn  So I could Bload data from Basic, move it to Auxiliary with an
           assembly routine
Dave Lyons it directly without trouble or not.
Republicn  and then have the BASIC program then Bload more data ??
Dave Lyons Yup, sounds like a good plan.  You can even use the ,B and ,L
           parameters on
Republicn  That was what I was going to do, but if AUXMOVE wrote over BASIC
           it wouldn't
Republicn  have worked.  Glad I don't have to worry about that.  Thanks a lot
           for the help
Dave Lyons the BLOAD to load one piece of a file at a time, if it's too big
           to load all
Dave Lyons at once (into your available main memory space).
DaviesDoug Hi all
Republicn  Each file isn't that big, it's just that there are a lot of
           them.
AFL Jim    Hi Doug
Mac III    basic probably uses it so you can't access it from Basic...
Mac III    but it seems likely that Basic would reside there... since Auxmove
           lives in
Mac III    both aux and main memory
Dave Lyons Uses _what_, Mac III?
Dave Lyons AUXMOVE lives in ROM; so does Applesoft.
Mac III    the aux move routine
Mac III    so does Basic map it out?
Dave Lyons Applesoft doesn't use AUXMOVE.  (Applesoft only knows about the
           1st 64K.)
Republicn  That's why this program is being moved to assembly.  It was too
           slow and we
Mac III    ok  makes sense
Republicn  couldn't give it a lot of data.
AFL Jim    Dead air...
AFL Jim    :)
Republicn  Does AUXMOVE use the area of RAM where BASIC stores the program?
Matt DTS   Anyone up for pizza?
Mac III    well... at least I showed everyone that they didn't have to be an
           expert to
AFA Parik  w/o anchovies...
Mac III    talk in here  :)
JSchober   Yeah, Matt!!  Pepperoni, double cheese, please...
AFL Scott  <----Ham, too!
AFA Parik  Do the annunciators do anything special on the GS?  I vaguely
           remember a 
Dave HDS   Your buying?
AFL Jim    It can, Repub..
AFA Parik  certain combination doing something "neat"...
Matt DTS   My what?
Dave Lyons AUXMOVE won't screw up your program unless the parameters you feed
           it tell it
Mac III    Cupid and AppleLink?
Dave Lyons to copy something over it.
JSchober   LOL... it wasn't an ADVERTISEMENT wyrm... amazing...
Republicn  Thanks.  That answered that.
Dave Lyons Parik, I think at least _one_ of them does something:  the one for
           enabling
AFL Jim    Only if you're moving something from Aux Memory to the area where
           your BASIC 
AFL Jim    program is.
Dave Lyons double-hires graphics, just like the GS.  On the IIc one is used
           for the
Dave Lyons mouse or something.
AFL Jim    Cupid just got hit by a steam roller...
AFA Parik  shucks, I thought one of them would install a 16 megahertz speedup
           card...
AFL Marty  who's cupid? :)
Republicn  Where can I get information about what Tools were added and
           modified from
Republicn  Prodo 16 to GS/OS?
Matt DTS   A really nifty and authoritative-looking description of
           AUXMOVE...
Mac III    GSOS reference manual?
Matt DTS   ...is on page 260 of the IIgs Firmware Reference Manual.
AFL Jim    What is the story on the Lisa assembler? Brian doesn't come over
           here often, so
Dave Lyons From APDA (1-800-282-APDA) buy the Toolbox Reference Update, Beta
           draft, and
AFL Jim    I haven't kept up with it.
Dave Lyons the GS/OS reference manual, vols I and II.
Matt DTS   If you want changes done for System Disk 4.0, you need the 4.0
           Release Notes...
Matt DTS   ...which APDA sends with the 4.0 disks that you can buy from
           them.
Dave Lyons (Yeah, that too.)
DwightW1   side question: why does my modem keep disconnecting me from the
           service?
Matt DTS   The other documents are things you Should Have, also.
AFA Gary J Dwight - you must be on Telenet.  I had to switch to Tymenet
           lately.
Matt DTS   Dwight:  It doesn't like you.  MCI is that way with me.
AFL Jim    Dwight, Bad phone line? Flakey modem?
Republicn  Thanks again.  I'm just getting started with assembly and this has
           helped a lot
DwightW1   true, will swtich also....thanks
Republicn  I got disconnected earlier tonight, but I can't switch to Tymnet,
           Telenet is
Republicn  the only one in my city that does 2400.
AFA Gary J I had real bad problems (7 times in one night).  I haven't died
           since I
AFL Jim    Hi Bill
AFA Gary J switched.
BillP      Hiya Jim!   Topic still assm tonight?
AFL Jim    BTW: Gary has finished uploading the new technotes into a
           background library
DaviesDoug Anyone ever had the problem of the Super-hires screen really
           screwing....
AFL Jim    area. As soon as Kent moves them over in the main libraries,
           you'll be able to
DaviesDoug up.  like pixels shifted around and glitching
AFL Jim    download them as a set or as individual files.
AFA Parik  No...
JSchober   Great!  :)
DaviesDoug I am thinking it is my CMS drive
Matt DTS   I have at home, but not at work.  I power down for a while and it
           goes away.
Dave Lyons Sounds like a software problem to me, Doug.
AFA Parik  Have you run Mr. Fixit through it?
Republicn  no
JSchober   How did the CMS drive and the SHR screen get connected??  %)
CptnCrunch Anyone out there have a fully disassembled and commented Applesoft
           Basic?
AFL Jim    Sounds like software or bad RAM.
Dave Lyons (Like a BlockMove accidentally containing the screen....)
AFA Parik  Merlin 8/16 comes with AppleSoft fully commented &
           disassembled...
DaviesDoug don't know, but I have to turn my CMS off before the screen will
           clear back
Dan Burton It looks like the screens mapping screws up
DaviesDoug up after turning my machine off four about 5 minutes
DaviesDoug NO....pixels flicker and it's like all the pixels get shifted but
           one
DaviesDoug real weird
Matt DTS   Let me guess - vertical lines the entire screen tall that are
           placed wrong?
CptnCrunch I don't have all the merlin files.  That's what I'm lookig for...
           
DaviesDoug Yep, MATT
DaviesDoug other things too
AFA Parik  ah wait, I've had that problem running Applelink before...
Matt DTS   It's not your CMS - I have a Sider and the same thing happens
           occasionally.
JSchober   (I want to know how programs can draw on the GS' border in SHR
           mode...
JSchober   definitely drawing on the BORDER... weird...)
AFA Parik  Its e-z Joe.  
Matt DTS   Joey:  Go away.  Far away.  Now.
JSchober   LOL Matt... oh, Parik??
AFA Parik  One easy way is to switch during scan line interrupts...
Matt DTS   CptnCrunch:  "Don't have all the Merlin files?"  You bought a
           defective copy?
AFA Parik  You can also use the VERCNT counter ($E0C02E) as documented in one
           of Matt's
Dave HDS   Yeah...just reload the background color register quick...
JSchober   To switch WHAT??  I always thought the border wasn't mapped to SHR
           coords...
AFL Marty  How do you not have all the Merlin files?
AFA Parik  technotes.  A demo I'll be releasiing soon changes the screen text
           color when
AFA Parik  you do a open-apple-reset and prints neat messages :).
AFA Parik  (rapidly that is, it gives a hue-colored effect.  Looks
           impressive)
CptnCrunch Well, I didn't exactly "Buy" it.  I'm "Borrowing" it.
DaviesDoug :)
AFA Parik  Its not Joe, you change $E0C034, lower nibble.
BillP      Buy it,  its well worth the cost
AFA Parik  When you change it at certain intervals, only part of the screen
           change colors.
AFL Jim    and we'll talk to you then :)
DaviesDoug just DON't change the high nibble....it's disasterous
CptnCrunch Yeah, I know...  
AFA Parik  ie, if you change when the thing is on line 60 to green, the top
           will be black 
Dave HDS   Very
Dave Lyons If "borrowing" means you have all documentation and all the
           owner's copies of
JSchober   Oh, I see what you're saying!!  Right, right, gotcha... so the
           only catch to
Dave Lyons the software, that's okay.  If and only if.
AFA Parik  and the bottom green.  Nice effects.  A guy I know in France makes
           a bouncing
AFA Parik  roller effect.  neat!
JSchober   that is that the left and right sides must be identical on each
           screen line,
JSchober   eh?
JSchober   (a bouncing WHAT??)
AFA Parik  (those things mother used to whack you with :)
JSchober   LOL... on the BORDER??
AFA Parik  Yup.  He changes at various intervals, ie, change at 60 and
           rechange at 80 so
AFA Parik  you get a 20 line roller, and then increment so at next pass
           change at 62 and
AFA Parik  at 82...neat.
AFA Gary J Sounds pretty wild.  :)
Republicn  I gotta run.  Bye all.
DaviesDoug Dans done this (the rolling effect) looks neat
JSchober   OIC... hehehee... neat trick.  I gotta play with that, some. 
           (MUCH to Matt's
AFA Gary J Bye, Repub.
BillP      I'd like to get hold of the demo that was playing in the APDA
           booth at the last
JSchober   annoyance...  >:)
BillP      Applefest
AFA Gary J Right, Bill :)
AFA Parik  You and the rest of the world...hehehe
JSchober   What was that, Bill, for us poor, unfortunate folk who didn't
           go?
Matt DTS   Playing with the border is just fine.  But I've still not heard
           the end...
AFL Jim    Me too....
Matt DTS   ...from people who *insist* there's some way to make QuickDraw
           draw on the...
Matt DTS   ...border and Apple just won't tell them.  <sigh>
AFA Parik  overscan...hehehe
DaviesDoug yah right
JSchober   LOL Matt... yeah, overscan, indeed!!  (Would be a nice touch,
           y'know...)
Dave HDS   You gotta be kidding, Matt...heh...
BillP      I wouldn't suspect people would use Quickdraw to do it
Dave Lyons (Are there a lot of people like that, Matt, or just a few
           insistent ones?)
Dave HDS   Are they certified or certifiable???
Matt DTS   just a few
AFL Jim    The few, the insistent, the ugly...
JSchober   :)
AFA Parik  Aha, another question.  When I was scanning for the oa-reset
           semivector, I
AFA Gary J :)
AFA Parik  saw that the VBL vector returns with a RTL when not in QD.  When
           in Quickdraw,
AFA Parik  does QD replace this?   Is this vector replaced with a routine
           that does
AFA Parik  something at any other time?  if so, would this effect a program
           that is using
Dave Lyons Parik, are you sure you mean the VBL vector, not the scanline
           vector or
AFA Parik  the retrace period t draw?
Dave Lyons something?  Gimme it in hex if you have it.  What System Disk,
           too?
AFL Marty  (what the h*ll's a semivector?)
AFA Parik  The VBL vector.  
BillP      an 18 wheeled vector
JSchober   (A vector that may or may not exist, Marty... :-)
Matt DTS   <raspberry>
AFA Parik  $E1/0030-33.  Jumps to a $FF area and RTLs in there with carry
           clear I believe.
AFA Gary J LOL, Bill! :)
Dave Lyons VBL points to the HeartBeat task manager, _not_ to an RTL.
Dave HDS   Messing about in the //gs e1 vectors???
AFL Marty  (thanks Bill :)
BillP      I got a good question...
Dave HDS   Isn;t that an Apple NO NO ???
Matt DTS   Sort of.  Maybe.  But maybe not.
AFL Marty  Good questions are Apple no no's?
BillP      In the package we got with Merlin 8/16...(we bought it) was an add
           for a card
DaviesDoug make sure you have appletalk interrupts off to do the border
           stuff.....
AFA Gary J It's all right to look, but not to touch, Dave.
BillP      that claims to be a hardware debugger for 8 and 16 bit mode....
DaviesDoug otherwise it ruins the timing
BillP      Does anyone have one or know anthing about it?
Matt DTS   We prefer people to use GetVector and SetVector to look at
           vectors...
Matt DTS   ...but there are some in the Firmware Reference which you can't.
Dave HDS   I'm sure you do...never know when those will be moved...
AFA Gary J Who was the manufacturer, Bill?
AFL Jim    What's the name of it, Bill?
Matt DTS   Well, there went Dave.  Bye now, Dave.  Come back sometime.
BillP      I forgot now...  I'll post a question tomorrow about it in Lets
           Discuss
AFA Gary J Was it ProDev?
DaviesDoug hi dave
BillP      I'd be happy to hear of any hardware debugger that anyone know of
           actually.  :)
JSchober   Gee, Dave, welcome to AII Development!
AFA Parik  Oh whoops, Dave you're right.  It DOES something.  So does this
           steal away
Matt DTS   There he is.
Dave Lyons Dang.  Fatal Error 0911 when I tried to go into Nifty List. :(
BillP      yes,  It was ProDev
JSchober   (and you came back that quickly??)
AFA Parik  from the retrace period?
DaviesDoug hmmmm....nifty list during a conference?
AFA Parik  (Dave's got Nifty List!  :)
BillP      know anything about it?
DaviesDoug that could be deadly :)
Matt DTS   "Dr., it hurts when I do this."  "Well, don't do that."  <ducking>
            
AFA Gary J I have a pamphlet on that, Bill (from last year!)
JSchober   Why not, Doug?
DaviesDoug sort of like driving drunk
Dave Lyons No, I was gone about 2 minutes, but you guys couldn't tell from
           the Hi/Bye
Dave Lyons line.
DennisDoms (I bought a System Saver IIgs...no more "0911"'s with the fan, it
           seems.)
JSchober   Oh, right, forgot that....
AFA Parik  Bill, Gary talked about this a LONG time ago, it sounded really
           neat...
Dave Lyons Yeah, Nifty List works great from within ALPE, as long as you
           don't get 0911
AFA Parik  Didn't they make the GS version also?
Dave Lyons errors for hitting Apple-Ctrl-ESC.  I _have_ a fan already; maybe
           I need a
Dave Lyons second one.
JSchober   A fan for the fan?
BillP      yea,  I miss beening able to do hardware break,  supposely it
           supports the GS
BillP      beening = being    ::sigh::
AFA Gary J Chuck Kelly, the designer, now has an account here on AppleLink.
AFA Gary J I wrote to him in December and he replied to me here in E-mail.
BillP      oooo   maybe we should ask about a discount on multiples
AFA Parik  Rephrased question : IRQ.VBL runs a routine that is sort of long. 
           Does this
AFA Parik  take away from the retrace period for a program that needs as much
           of it as
AFA Gary J The 8 bit version has been available for some time, but there was
           a problem
AFA Parik  possible?  Would it be wise to steal the vector away during
           program execution  
AFA Parik  and replace it later on?
BillP      Thanks Gary, I'll contact him
AFA Gary J with the IIGS version.  He said they have solved the problem and
           will be
AFA Gary J beta testing (this month?) soon.
JSchober   RSN, probably...
AFA Gary J I think his screen name is ProDev.
JSchober   (looks like it, Gary, that's a valid name...)
Dave Lyons No, it's unwise, Parik:  for example, the GS/OS Disk II driver use
           a heartbeat
BillP      well...  we can certain do some heavy beta testing for him if he
           wants  :)
Dave Lyons tasks in that queue to decide whether the cached blocks are still
           valid, I
AFA Gary J Right, Bill :)
DaviesDoug Dan got dumped by his kid
Dave Lyons think.  There could be lots of heartbeat tasks.  Probably the best
           thing you
AFA Gary J I've been wanting to see a IIGS version in action myself.
Dave Lyons program could do is (1) do the best it can or (2) detect that the
           interrupt
AFL Jim    Is this a hint that you're doing more IIGS development, Bill?
Dave Lyons routine isn't getting called often enough & tell the user to
           remove some
AFL Jim    :)
Dave Lyons utilities to improve performance.
BillP      Its no secret Jim...
BillP      Everyone who came to the conference on AppleLink software heard me
            :)
AFA Parik  Hmm, thanks Dave.  Right now the scroll routines are semi-jerky,
           so any time
AFA Parik  stolen away is crucial...:(
AFL Jim    Is that a hint that I should show up for more conferences, Bill?
BillP      Of course, I did not say anything about SHR.   :)
AFA Parik  hehe
AFA Gary J Yes you did.  You said it was too slow, Bill :)
BillP      Jim, I'm sure you have enough to keep you busy..  you can always
           call me 
AFA Parik  I remember Bill saying at the Alink software conference that FREE
           Transwarp
BillP      direct if you want to know anything  :)
AFA Parik  GS's will be given away to everyone.  *grin*
AFL Jim    so's 2400 bps...
BillP      :)
AFL Scott  I do too!:)
BillP      I'll need one first
DaviesDoug Anyone bought a Sonic Blaster yet?  Not too bad.
BillP      I was promised a beta GS Zip chip last year too,  I wonder what
           ever happen to
BillP      it
AFL Jim    Any other assembly discussion before we call it a night?
DaviesDoug <thinking>
JSchober   (any static in the Blaster, Doug??  Heard a couple bad reviews in
           info-apple..)
DaviesDoug Yah sorta, but the software is excellent
AFL Scott  B-Spline curves.. the inside story... Enquiring minds want to
           know..:)
Dave HDS   Tree Splaying anyone?
AFA Parik  You're right about VBL handler nono's Dave, I just replaced mine
           with a direct
Matt DTS   I still want pizza.
AFA Parik  RTL and it froze up the other GS...:)
AFA Parik  0 (small, mini pizza)
AFL Jim    I want Gates....
JSchober   Well, gee, Matt, go and call 'em up now!  You're paying, of
           course...
Dave HDS   Bill?
AFA Gary J Free delivery within a 3000 mile radius, right?  :)
DennisDoms (Gee, Jim, isn't there an SF branch?)
AFA Parik  30 minutes or less!
JSchober   Uh huh... in 30 minutes or less... GMTA Parik... :)
AFL Jim    Nope :(
AFA Parik  :)
AFA Parik  Go to Arnelli's pizza in Berkeley, fantastic, New York style pizza
           you'll 
AFA Parik  never forget.  
DennisDoms Hmmm...I'll go tomorrow and think of you... :)
AFL Jim    Thanks a lot, Dennis....
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Jim    I'll think of you when I wear short sleeve shirts in February...
Matt DTS   jake's, maybe
AFA Gary J How can I draw a pepperoni on my screen using assembly language? 
           :)
AFA Parik  bit shift it!
TimH06     Use the _DrawPepperoni QD call!
AFA Gary J heheh
AFL Jim    Matt, will Jakes let me bring my own sauce?
DennisDoms LDA #pepperoni, STA $2000
DaviesDoug do a ROL PIZZA
Matt DTS   Well, FrameOval and PaintOval come to mind...
BillP      here
Dave Lyons (Yeah, with an appropriate PenPattern, of course.)
BillP      someone call me?    or was it the smell of pizza
DaviesDoug i think i have gas
AFA Parik  My car does too.
