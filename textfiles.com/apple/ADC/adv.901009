Topic:  Debugging and Testing Software
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar  (AFL Dyfet)

AFL Dyfet  Good evening and welcome to the Apple II Development
AFL Dyfet  Forum.  Tonight we will be discussing software testing (not that
           anyone's
AFL Dyfet  software ever has bugs...only features)...We will not be using
           protocol just
AFL Dyfet  yet....so whomever wishes to start, feel free to grab the floor
           :)
AFL Dyfet  Dave, Matt, out of curiosity, what quality control methods does
           Apple use for
AFL Dyfet  new software?
Dave Lyons Well, basically we have "testers" and a
Dave Lyons "Bug Reporting Center" where they (or whoever) file
Dave Lyons bugs.  When an engineer claims a bug is fixed, the
Dave Lyons tester gets to verify that it's fixed, and bugs are later
           "regressed" to make sure they're
Dave Lyons really still fixed (in case somebody built the final disk with the
           wrong version of a
Dave Lyons source file, or whatever--stuff like that can definitely
           happen!).
AFA Parik  (like setting the beta bit on a system software version?  ;)
ShanoJ     Anyone know what's up with the Scheduler? It just flat out don't
           seem to work
ShanoJ     on some peoples computers. :(
AFL Marty  <-- some people (I think)
ShanoJ     Ya, Marty, you classify as some people. For more than one reason.
           :)
AFL Marty  Thanks, I think.
Dave Lyons Jonah, if the Scheduler doesn't work it's because somebody
           INCBUSYed more than they DECBUSYed.  I
Dave Lyons bet if they strip out their DAs & stuff it's fixed.  Oh, Draft
           mode printing on 5.0.2 and earlier
Dave Lyons calls SetGrafProcs, which INCBUSYs once too many--does that
           help?
ShanoJ     Uh uh, Dave. I check the busy flag, and it's set to 0. I call
           SchAddTask, and
ShanoJ     get a result flag of TRUE, but the task is never called.
Dave Lyons Jonah, the only other thing I can think of is that the "scheduler
           is busy" flag got set when a
Dave Lyons scheduled task was dispatched but never returned (i.e., you crash
           in a scheduled task).  In that
Dave Lyons case on ROM 1 only the scheduler doesn't work again until you
           power off or do a self-test.
ShanoJ     Ya, I've thought about that but my tester turns on the computer
           and trys my
ShanoJ     test program IMMEDIATELY. That means that it is HIGHLY unlikely
           that it's the
ShanoJ     bug in the Scheduler task flag.
Dave Lyons Okay, one more thing:  You're calling the scheduler WHILE the busy
           flag is 0?  In that case, the task
Dave Lyons should be executed only after somebody calls INCBUSY and then
           DECBUSY.  SchAddTask never
Dave Lyons dispatches the task immediately, so if the BUSY flag is 0 you
           don't normally want to
Dave Lyons call SchAddTask.
ShanoJ     Okay, so I've got it backwards? I should only call SchAddTask if
           the busy flag
ShanoJ     is SET? Ahh, that might be what's messing me up! Thanks, I'll give
           that a try
ShanoJ     (and if it doesn't work... :)
Dave Lyons Right--if E100FF is 0, the system *isn't* busy, so you don't have
           to use the scheduler.
ShanoJ     On a related note, is there any way to recover from a tool break
           in GSBug?
AFA Parik  'r'
ShanoJ     Well, actually, I've only set tool breaks on SchAddTask, and the
           GS just
ShanoJ     crahses and sits there.
Dave Lyons What version?
ShanoJ     v1.5
Dave Lyons Should work fine.  UNLESS your stack was in $01xx.  (In that case
           you can improve
Dave Lyons the behavior by setting $01/0100 to $80--this will make interrupts
           not trash your page-1 stack while
Dave Lyons you're in GSBug.
ShanoJ     And one more thing: if, from an interrupt, I need to call the
           Scheduler, what
ShanoJ     do I do? I'm not supposed to hog the interrupt, but if the busy
           flag is clear
ShanoJ     I'm supposed to just go do my thing....
ShanoJ     What's at $01/0100?
Dave Lyons Good question.  What's "your thing"?
ShanoJ     Guess. It's blanking in Twilight, of course! :)
Dave Lyons $01/0100 is the position of the $01xx stack whenever the stack
           pointer *isn't* in page 1.  More
Dave Lyons specifically, it's the main-memory page 1 stack, and $01/0101 is
           the auxiliary-memory page-1 stack
Dave Lyons (period)
ShanoJ     Is there any way to shadow $002000 into $012000?
AFA Parik  yes
AFA Parik  readrm=0,writeram=1 in $e0c068
AFA Gary J Hmmmm..  What do you need to do that for??
AFA Parik  (don't do it under gs/os)
AFA Gary J ($002000 into $012000?)
ShanoJ     I wanna do a weird scroll, and I need to do some strange
           shadowing.
ShanoJ     Ya, I knew that, Parik. Then again, I'm not particularly fond of
           my HD, so I
ShanoJ     might just do it anyway.... :)
AFA Gary J Weird, strange... hmmmm.  Sounds like an interesting program :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, does anyone have any questions related to tonight's topic??
ShanoJ     What exactly is tonights topic?
AFA Gary J You've been touching on in already, Jonah :)
AFL Marty  (debugging, Jonah)
ShanoJ     Oh ya, I knew that. :) Just wait till I get going... :)
AFA Parik  is gs/os vol 3 shippin' yet?
AFA Parik  er, i mean the addison-wesley one
WinkieJim  Parik, Toolbox Vol 3 is.
AFA Gary J GS/OS Reference, he means :)
AFA Parik  GS/OS Reference:The Book.  The Zen of GS/OS .  Whatever its
           called.
WinkieJim  GS/OS re f(only vol) is too
WinkieJim  <---have both final versions
AFA Gary J BOTH final versions?  Of GS/OS Reference?
AFA Parik  GS/OS and you.  How to live in a MSDos world with GS/OS.  Sex,
           lies, and GS/OS.
WinkieJim  of GS/OS Reference and Toolbox Vol 3
ShanoJ     Anyone know what might be screwing up the menu bar in View 3200?
           I'm 99% sure
ShanoJ     I'm not BLATANTLY stepping on any memory...
AFA Gary J Have you used Big Brother to check it?
AFA Gary J :)
ShanoJ     No, that I haven't. Good idea!
WinkieJim  Does it only get messed up when you don't select something?
ShanoJ     It only gets trashed after you view a 3200 color picture...
WinkieJim  Shano, make sure you keep the menu titles in no-purgable and
           non-movable memory
ShanoJ     Yup, they're in the body of my program (no resources for this one
           yet) so if
ShanoJ     THEY get purged, I'm in DEEP trouble. :)
WinkieJim  Oh...I love purging the code I'm executing code in :) :)
AFL Dyfet  Self relocating executing code...core wars lives! :)
WinkieJim  Ok, anyone have any idea how a non-registered developer can get a
           AuxType
WinkieJim  reserved for himself?
ShanoJ     Can't you just send one of those forms to DTS?
ShanoJ     Oh, and Matt and Dave, should I register Twilight's file type?
WinkieJim  Dumb Question #1: What form?
ShanoJ     That is, the blanker file type?
ShanoJ     There's one in the ADV library that you fill out and they assign
           you a file and
ShanoJ     auxType, if you say please a lot and bribe them. :)
AFA Gary J There's a form, and accompaning instructions available for
AFA Gary J download in the ADV software library.
AFA Parik  (when you d/l the filetype tech notes, a form is included.  look
           in adv/from
AFA Parik  apple/filetype notes)
AFA Gary J (3 people, same basic answer :)
WinkieJim  Ah, will do...(I get the printed versions from APDA)
Dave Lyons What's "Twilight's file type"?
ShanoJ     Well, I've been using $B4, $5457. (TW).
AFL Dyfet  I think your wild use of filetyples will be civilized by Apple yet
           :)
AFL Marty  (You mean "Twilight module filetype" don't you?)
Matt DTS   You can NOT use $B4!  That's previously assigned as run-time
           libraries!
ShanoJ     Ya, I meant module file type, Marty. Twilight itself is a CDEV, of
           course, so
ShanoJ     it has the $C7 filetype.
WinkieJim  <---needs a $BC filetype and using $0000 until I get an official
           AuxType.
WinkieJim  <----nice programmer :)
AFL Marty  Okay... wasn't sure.
Dave Lyons Ack!?  Don't be making up filetypes.  Yes, you should send in a
           form and be assigned a
Dave Lyons filetype/auxtype combination.
ShanoJ     Ya, well modules ARE runtime libraries, kinda. Anyway, the system
           loader won'y
ShanoJ     load them unless theyre int the $Bx range somewhere, so it HAD to
           be one of
ShanoJ     those reserved types....
Matt DTS   Jonah:  You're making this up.  You didn't even ask for help
           before doing this.
Matt DTS   Did you even *look* at the file type notes to see about file type
           $BC, which is available for just
Matt DTS   such purposes?  If you put one of those files in the Libraries
           directory, the Loader could do very bad
Matt DTS   things to people's applications.
Dave Lyons (Actually, you can get the loader to load anything--just load it
           into RAM first and use
Dave Lyons InitialLoad2 on it.  Or make it a Code Resource and let the
           CodeResConverter do the above for you
Dave Lyons automatically.)
Matt DTS   It's very depressing to spend years telling people not to steal
           file types just to have it happen
Matt DTS   every other week, from people who seem to be paying attention. 
           <--depressed
ShanoJ     Ya, well that's about a zillion extra things to do, and eveyone
           knows how lazy
ShanoJ     I am. :)
ShanoJ     Matt, I DID ask for help, just not on that. :)
Matt DTS   [I'm not impressed.]
WinkieJim  Do I get a prize for not stealing a fyletype? :)
ShanoJ     Hey, Matt, it's not that bad. I'm sorry.
AFA Parik  you get to buy lunch for dts
ShanoJ     Would it make it up to you if I got Marty to lend you some of his
           pigs?
ShanoJ     (sorry, couldn't resist that ONE little joke... :)
AFA Gary J Matt, Dave - Did you see Winkie's question about if you need to
           be a registered
AFA Gary J developer in order to request a file type?  (I can't recall what
           the
AFA Gary J request form stipulates )
Matt DTS   You do not have to be a Partner or Associate - nowhere on the form
           does it say that you do.
AFA Gary J Ok.  (I thought not)
Matt DTS   Jim:  You're also free to use auxtype $0000 in file type $BC, even
           if you ship it that way.  Just be
Matt DTS   prepared that other people may be using it as well.
AFL Dyfet  The point is not to step on other peoples filetypes...before Apple
           started
AFL Dyfet  tracking filetype use, it was a REAL MESS out there...I know :)
WinkieJim  Well that's the problem, I don't want to load the wrong kind of
           file and
WinkieJim  blow up the world in the process :)
ShanoJ     Ya, but that's a real problem. If I use $BC,$0000 and someone else
           uses
ShanoJ     $BC,$0000, I'm in deep do-do.
AFL Dyfet  And if you chose a type that matches something used in future
           system software,
AFL Dyfet  all the worse...
Matt DTS   So did you bother to take the form conveniently provided online
           and *ask* for a unique auxtype?
Matt DTS   Nooooo.....
AFA Gary J :)
WinkieJim  I can inmagine loading a NifytyList module into SuperInfo and
           destrying the 
WinkieJim  world as I know it :)
Matt DTS   About half the system is held together by developer cooperation,
           gang, and that means *all* of you,
Matt DTS   not just the big guys.  PLEASE pay attention before you send
           programs to several thousand people.
AFA Gary J (I KNEW this would raise Matt's ire  :)
ShanoJ     No, you're right, I didn't. I _DID_ download it, though, but it
           got lossed. :(
WinkieJim  <---follows the rules....most of the time ;)
ShanoJ     Ya, I follow a hell of a lot of rules, but I'm also REALLY
           lazy...
ShanoJ     I'm sorry Matt. Tell you what: I'm working on Twilight v2.0 right
           now. I'll
ShanoJ     send in the file type form, get a new filetype, change all of
           Twilight's code
ShanoJ     to the new one AND include a converter from the old to the new
           file types in
ShanoJ     the final archive, AND I'll put a note in the docs saying what a
           naughty boy I
ShanoJ     was and reminding everyone not to do what I did. Would that make
           things a
ShanoJ     little better?
AFL Dyfet  Lazyness on filetype hurts more than just you, Jonah...
Matt DTS   So be lazy when you're not sending stuff to a few thousand people.
            <-- SERIOUSLY unimpressed
AFL Scott  How long does it take to get a filetype assigned?  I don't want to
           use BIN as the filetype for raw
AFL Scott  images.
AFL Scott  And DTS is closed right now, and I'm shipping at the end of the
           month.
Matt DTS   It normally takes about a day, but DTS is currently closed until
           October 19th so it may be until then.
Matt DTS   I'll warn you right off that I'm resistant to allocating any new
           graphic image auxtypes -- all we
Matt DTS   need at this point is another graphic file format for other
           programs to deal with.
AFL Scott  Matt, these are raw images, previously undefined.  I want to make
           the format well known to everyone
AFL Scott  not just the people who buy the board.
AFL Dyfet  Ah...
Matt DTS   In other words, a fourth or fifth "standard" that everyone should
           be expected to revise their programs
Matt DTS   to follow.  I really have trouble believing that one of the
           existing graphics formats can't suit
Matt DTS   nearly everyone's needs, especially since Apple Preferred is
           user-extendable.
ShanoJ     Matt, we're talking about a format that's COMPLETELY unlike all
           other GS
ShanoJ     formats, particularly in the way that it can store ALL of the
           colors.
AFL Scott  No, not at all.  Tell me one that deals with raw data and NOT
           pixelmaps and I'll do it.
ShanoJ     It's HIGHLY unlikely that any existing paint program will even TRY
           to load the
ShanoJ     damn things, but it would be VERY nice for people to be able to
           get ahold of
ShanoJ     the format specs so they can include support in programs like
           SHRConvert,
ShanoJ     Convert 3200, The Graphic Exchange, etc.
Matt DTS   I tend to think of pixel maps as raw pixel data. What do you
           mean?
Dave Lyons Yeah, what's Raw Data?
ShanoJ     Raw data= 3 32K chunks of 0-$F.
AFL Scott  I mean a raw, unformatted, un-quantized, picture that can contain
           up to 4096 colors.
WinkieJim  Data that hasn't been cooked
ShanoJ     No implicit color map or pixel map.
AFL Scott  What Jonah said.
AFA Gary J What Winkie said :)
Matt DTS   In other words, a pixel map at 12 bits per pixel.
AFL Scott  Yes.
AFL Scott  But in three 32k planes.
Matt DTS   Do you see my point about publishing yet another graphic format,
           though?
AFL Scott  I see it and I agree with it.  I just don't see how 
AFL Scott  it can fit into Apple Preferred without you still having to write
           a FTN to show that the main segment
AFL Scott  is void.
Dave Lyons Can you use TIFF, Scott?
Matt DTS   Who says you have to have a MAIN block?
Matt DTS   (Dave:  We don't have an auxtype assigned for TIFF, so it may not
           help.)
AFL Scott  TIFF would be Ideal, however, under the circumstances, it's really
           too late to add the
AFL Scott  all color TIFF files (or those that I can find the spec on) and
           I'm not up to the coding right now.  
Matt DTS   I personally prefer to think you could store a GS-type pixel map
           in a regular Apple-preferred file
Matt DTS   and add a SCOTT block (or something :) that contains all the rest
           of your stuff.  If the user tries
AFL Scott  code for TIFF processing.  Additionally, that opens up another can
           of worms implying TIFF support for
Matt DTS   to load an APF file that doesn't contain the SCOTT block, you tell
           them and just display the picture.
Dave Lyons (Matt:  We should define an auxtype for TIFF.)
AFL Scott  Ok... I'll see if I can do it that way, Matt.  I guess I
           misunderstood APF format, then.  Oh... As 
AFL Scott  far as a TIFF auxtype goes.. it's a horribly convoluted format
           that's really a mess.  Just my
AFL Scott  opinion.
Matt DTS   (If someone requests it, I will - I don't normally make up
           auxtypes for stuff no one has said they
Matt DTS   want>)
WinkieJim  Why not? :) Make $77 the StuffNoOneWants filetype.
AFA Gary J Winkie :)
ShanoJ     Anyone know how to make the DOC interrupt at 50Hz? I wish Parik
           were here...
ShanoJ     Gee, Matt, could you create a TIFF file format for the GS so
           Convert 3200 can
ShanoJ     identify them?
Matt DTS   Not that you would know, Jonah, but there's a form you fill out to
           request auxtypes.
ShanoJ     Also, I hope I don't have to go through the third degree to get a
           file/aux typy
ShanoJ     for Twilight... :(
ShanoJ     Matt, not to be rude, but you know, you make this REAL easy on a
           person... :(
Matt DTS   You make it really easy on me by shipping around 10,000 bogus
           run-time libraries to the world because
Matt DTS   you're "too lazy" to fill out a simple form.  I don't mean to be
           rude (No, really, I don't!  Those
Matt DTS   of you who've been here for a while may not believe that, though
           :) but I really lose patience quickly
Matt DTS   when people treat things like this as unimportant.
ShanoJ     Hey, Matt, there isn't anything I can do about that now. I've 
           offered to fix it in
ShanoJ     the next release, which involves recoding signifigant parts of the
           program, and
ShanoJ     I'm even willing to write a converter so that people won't be
           stranded using
ShanoJ     the old Twilight modules. If that's not good enough for you, there
           aint much
ShanoJ     more I can do...
AFL Dyfet  I think a good start, Jonah, is the fill out the form...
ShanoJ     Hey, that's DONE. I found one in my binder while I was sitting
           here and its all
ShanoJ     typed out and ready to go... It'll be in the mail tomorrow.
WinkieJim  Then we won 't have to send out the FileType death squad out...
Nuzz       Just curious, why is DTS closed until the 19th ?
AFL Dyfet  Long memory Nuzz :)
WinkieJim  Two week columbus day closing :) :)
Matt DTS   Nearly everyone is working on Sample Code and other projects that
           we can't do while keeping up the
Matt DTS   current Email load.  All Apple Partners were sent an AppleLink
           explaining it.
Matt DTS   (All partners with AppleLink accounts, Andy.  :)
AFL Dyfet  :)
Paladin100 There are 10,000 Apple users left? I thought Apple converted
           everyone to Macs!
AFA Gary J :)
ShanoJ     So, no takers on the 50Hz interrupts? Shucks. :( Not my day, huh?
           :)
AFA Gary J Conversion is an individual thing, Paladin.  Apple can't do it
           for you :)
Paladin100 But they're trying!
ShanoJ     No, I swaer, my GS was turning into a Mac when I wasn't looking.
           Then I turned
ShanoJ     back and it was back to normal, but if I'd been gone for an hour
           or so.... :)
ShanoJ     Ya, as long as the squad can come out tonight so I won't have to
           do my English
ShanoJ     paper.... :)
ShrinkIt   I like that idea... "The Filetype Death Squad"... hmmm what
           possibilities...
Tamira     :>
AFL Marty  You been putting Mac disks in it again Jonah?
Tamira     must be one of those pesky Mac cloning viruses  :>
AFA Gary J Debugging type question:  Dave, what's in the future for Nifty
           List?
Dave Lyons The future for Nifty List?  Probably 3.1, 3.2....  What do you
           mean?
AFA Gary J Heheh... No, I mean, are you actually going to be able to IMPROVE
           what you've
AFA Gary J done so far?  It seems to be very complete.  Any new features in
           the works?
WinkieJim  There's always room for inpovement...
Dave Lyons There's always room for improvement...
Dave Lyons :)
WinkieJim  (my spelling could stand improvement :)
AFA Gary J :)
Dave Lyons Geez, it doesn't even have command-line history yet!
Dave Lyons And Big Brother is only half done.
AFA Gary J True.  But I consider Big Brother as a module improvement.
Dave Lyons And the \find command doesn't have wildcard bytes!
Dave Lyons And there's no NDA interface to NL!
Dave Lyons And no NL command scripts, and no redirection to disk.
AFA Gary J NDA interface?  Interesting :)
Dave Lyons And no OS calls from the command line.
WinkieJim  Dave, don't worry about a NDA NiftyList...I've got that covered
           :)
Dave Lyons And you have to enter strings into "scratch" memory and type their
           addresses, instead of typing
Dave Lyons them inside a tool-call expression.
Dave Lyons LOTS of stuff to do....
AFA Gary J You are full of ideas.  :)  Sounds fantastic!
Matt DTS   (Don't forget about no NL-provided notify proc)
Dave Lyons Eh?
Dave Lyons Oh, okay...there will be an \addnp command
Dave Lyons in 3.1 that lets you see what things are being sent to GS/OS
           Notify Procs.
Matt DTS   (And a waning when the stack is in page one and tool calls could
           toast you.)
AFA Gary J :)
Dave Lyons (Yeah, everybody will be relieved when that feature shows up.)  (
           <-- sarcasm )

ShanoJ     Okay, what's everyone's favorite debugging aid?
AFA Gary J GSBug/Nifty List combo.
ShanoJ     Ya, me to. (GSBug/NiftyList). I think GSBug is God's gift to GS
           Assembly
WinkieJim  <---favorite debugging The thing crashes on me durring the tool
           call
WinkieJim  err two thoughts in  one there :)
ShanoJ     programmers, and Nifty List is God's gift to ALL GS programmers.
           :)
ShanoJ     And ORCA/Diss has quickly become one of my favorites, too.... :)
Matt DTS   That's funny - I know several people who would swear that
           *they're* God's gift to GS programming.
AFA Gary J Matt :)
ShanoJ     Hell, I've sworn that, but they made me stop over in the DC. And I
           can't use
ShanoJ     'Well...' as a subject, either. :)

WinkieJim  Anyone know if there's a problem with NEwControl2 loading a
           rTextForLETextBox2
WinkieJim  resource for a Static Text Control?
Dave Lyons WJ, what sort of a problem?  I don't know of one.
Dave Lyons Do you have all the descriptor and flag bits set to indicate
           what's a resource and what isn't?
WinkieJim  Yup, the Call takes a pointer to a Static Text Control Template
           and the
WinkieJim  template points to the resource.
ShanoJ     'Points to the resource'?
ShanoJ     You mean it has the resource's ID?
WinkieJim  Well...gives the Resource ID
Dave Lyons What's the moreFlags value in the template?
WinkieJim  $1002
WinkieJim  wait a sec.....hmmmm
WinkieJim  $1002 is what it should be :) my binary number has an extra zero
           in it so it's
WinkieJim  $2002....god I hate it when  it's such a simple thing. :/

ShanoJ     Is there any hope of the runtime version of GSBug being updated to
           handle 
ShanoJ     the _StartTools call properly, or can't you guys talk about
           that?
Matt DTS   "runtime version"?  There's a source-level version?
AFA Gary J I thought "application" version is being dumped.
ShanoJ     I mean the stand-alone version.
AFA Gary J (The NON-Init version)
Matt DTS   It is most likely at this point that the non-INIT version of GSBug
           will go away with the next release.
ShanoJ     Oh, that's too bad. It had it's uses, particularly for startup
           code. I hate
ShanoJ     having to put a brk 00 and recompile to debug the startup. Also,
           there's NO
ShanoJ     hope of the INIT version not returning GSBug's MemID when
           _MMStartUp is called
ShanoJ     from within it, huh?
Dave Lyons Jonah, can't you set a tool break on TLStartUp instead of
           recompiling with a BRK?
Dave Lyons Yes, there's hope that the next version will return the right
           MemID for things like MMStartUp.
ShanoJ     Hmm, hadn't thought of that, Dave. Will it work? I haven't had
           much luck with
ShanoJ     tool breaks on SchAddTask....
AFA Gary J Can you give us any info on approximately WHEN the update of
           GSBug will be out?
AFA Gary J (I know you hate that kind of question! :)
Matt DTS   The 1.5b9 and 1.5b10 versions (KansasFest and beyond) are on
           Developer CD, Volume V
Matt DTS   ("Night of the Living Disc") which is being pressed as we speak.
Matt DTS   (give or take two corrupted text files.  :( )
ShanoJ     Matt, who thinks up the titles for the CD's? And, how much have
           they had to 
ShanoJ     drink when they do it? :)
AFA Gary J Ahh.  Neat. 
Matt DTS   The Developer CD's are named by various people within Apple - it's
           kind of like a contest.
Matt DTS   It so happens that "Night of the Living Disc" was thought of by
           me.
ShanoJ     Ya, it sound's like your kind of stuff. :) I must say that I'm
           glad you write
ShanoJ     tech notes. They'd be INCREDIBLY boring without your humor! :)
ShanoJ     Now, if you had just written my history textbook... :)
AFA Gary J A perfect name for an October release, I might add :)
Matt DTS   I thought so. :)

ShanoJ     Matt, Dave, how are NDA's called (ie. what calls them)? Would it
           be legal for
ShanoJ     me to try to show a 3200 color picture from an NDA?
ShrinkIt   yeah, just put up a modal dialog asking what to do, then show the
           3200 pic and
ShrinkIt   return... simple...
Dave Lyons Well, OpenNDA calls an NDA's Open routine.  You're allowed to be
           "modal" at that time
Dave Lyons and return much later (returning NIL for your window pointer).
ShanoJ     So it would be okay for me to hog all of the interrupts? Also, is
           it okay for
ShanoJ     an NDA to call RefreshDesktop?
ShanoJ     (Oh, putting aside the AppleTalk issue, for the moment...)
Dave Lyons It might be easier (than calling RefreshDesktop) to open a
           full-screen window (after doing a
Dave Lyons HideMenuBar).  That way when you close the window the system knows
           to refresh the desktop, and if
Dave Lyons some strange application is updating any of its windows at
           interrupt time (carefully!), then the
Dave Lyons visRgns for its windows will indicate that they aren't visible, so
           you don't have to worry about
Dave Lyons it.  Interrupts are still necessary, not only for AppleTalk but
           for typing, if you're reading
Dave Lyons keypresses through the event manager.  Be very careful about
           disabling interrupt sources that
Dave Lyons aren't yours.
ShanoJ     Okay, Parik suggested just grabbing 32K and storing the screen
           there, and then
ShanoJ     blasting it back when I was done. This is a no-no, right?
ShanoJ     Hmm... What's the rule about disabling interrupts? I was hoping
           that I could
ShanoJ     shut them all down as long as I promised to start them back up
           again. Is it
ShanoJ     not quite that easy?
Dave Lyons It's always better to assume as little as possible, but for a
           3200-color display program you may have
Dave Lyons to assume a lot.  You can save the screen without assuming its
           size or location (open a fresh port
Dave Lyons and examine the locInfo structure).  Or you can use
           RefreshDesktop--nothing wrong with that.
Matt DTS   "Don't do it unless absolutely necessary, and then only for very
           short periods of time."
ShanoJ     Hmm... Well, how do I judge 'absolute necessity'? For instance
           it's absolutely
ShanoJ     required to do it to show 3200 color pictures. Is that a good
           enough justifi-
ShanoJ     cation?
ShanoJ     Or, should I include a message in the NDA that says 'this NDA does
           naughty 
ShanoJ     stuff, use it at your own risk' and let the user decide if that's
           enough
ShanoJ     justification? (then again, with my programs I should probably do
           that anyway:)
Dave Lyons If you disable certain ADB interrupts, the keyboard and/or mouse
           will *not* work with certain
Dave Lyons "universal access" utilities, even if you're reading the
           keyboard/mouse softswitches directly.
ShanoJ     Well, with all the interrupts I disable for View 3200 I still seem
           to be able
ShanoJ     to read the mouse register (forgotten the address at the moment)
           and $E0C000.
ShanoJ     That indicates that I'm not shutting TOO much down, right?
ShanoJ     And finally, anyone know what's with the VOC? I've heard that none
           of the 
ShanoJ     existing 3200 color displayers work with it.... :(
Dave Lyons No, I said *with certain universal access utilities*.  Send me a
           copy of your app and I can
Dave Lyons try it out.
ShanoJ     Oh, and is there any way to tell what Hz the display is running
           at, and is
ShanoJ     it legal to CHANGE this behind the user's back, and then change it
           back when
ShanoJ     I'm done?
Dave Lyons The Video Overlay Card has its own scanline counters--they
           aren't
Dave Lyons synchronized with the GS's.  APDA has the "Video Overlay Card
           Developer Notes" or something,
Dave Lyons which you might want to get.
Matt DTS   It is definitely not legal to change from 60 Hz to 50 Hz.
Dave Lyons If you change the scan rate of the monitor, you're going to make
           the display toasty, or at least
Dave Lyons bouncy.
ShanoJ     I take it that means 'no'?
Dave Lyons If somebody has their display scanning at 50Hz, it's probably
           because they're in a European country
Dave Lyons using a PAL display--they need it set that way to get a picture.
Matt DTS   I think "definitely not" means "no", yes.
ShanoJ     Ya, that's my problem. My code won't work for Europeans, and I get
           lots of
ShanoJ     nasty notes saying 'how could you release a program that doesn't
           even work (and
ShanoJ     they're NOT talking about Twilight) and it turns out they're
           running at 50Hz 
ShanoJ     which is screwing things up...
Matt DTS   Switching it to 60 Hz isn't going to help - they run at 50 Hz for
           a reason.
ShanoJ     Well, they say that if they set it to 60Hz in the control panel it
           fixes 
ShanoJ     things....
AFL Scott  It's an interesting problem... how to code for international
           compatibility.
Matt DTS   Yeah, your program runs but other things (like some timing for
           peripherals) might not.
ShanoJ     Haven't the slightest idea how that works, though.... 
ShanoJ     Ya, Scott. FOr Australia you have to do everything upside down.
           The disks
ShanoJ     John MacLean send me go in the wrong way up.... :)
AFA Gary J And disks spin in the opposite direction, too :)
Dave Lyons Actually, I don't know exactly how the scanline counters work for
           PAL.  When I revised the
Dave Lyons technical note on VBL, I left it a little wishy-washy on the PAL
           stuff because I had no
Dave Lyons PAL equipment to play with.
ShanoJ     Gee, Dave, you mean Apple doen't sponsor trips to Europe for tech
           note 
ShanoJ     research? Jeez.... :)
ShanoJ     Any last minute advice for what I should do on the 50Hz
ShanoJ     Apples?
Matt DTS   Write alternate timing code for 50 Hz machines, maybe. 
Dave Lyons Yeah, get one of your users to tell you what you have to
           do to make it work for 50Hz!
ShanoJ     Heh, make that 50 Hz MONITORS. And I thought 2.5 Mhz was slow...
           :)
AFA Gary J (Heck, I'll try a 50 mhz machine :)
ShanoJ     Dave, do you know if the VERTCNT register is incremented the same
           on the 50 and
ShanoJ     60 Hz mahines?
ShanoJ     That's ALL I'm reading for the 3200 color pics, so SOMETHING about
           it must be
ShanoJ     screwey... :(
Dave Lyons VERTCNT is $C02E, right?  (Sorry, I think in hex.)  I believe it's
           similar but slightly different,
Dave Lyons since there are a different number of scan lines (not in the
           useful display area, obviously).  The
Dave Lyons 0..199 super-hires lines probably -don't- have the same numbers,
           though!
Dave Lyons You might try some experimentation--On all the machines I've
           tried, you *can* set your GS to
ShanoJ     Ya, somewehere around there. Lesse....... yup, $C02E.
AFL Dyfet  Hmm...interesting thought...
Dave Lyons 50Hz and still get a readable (though slightly flickery)
           display.
ShanoJ     Hmm, mine completely flips out. The whole thing jumps up and down
           and looks 
ShanoJ     most awful. :(
AFL Dyfet  You need 50hz AC power :)
ShanoJ     Also, I'm not sure that would tell me what I need to know...
ShanoJ     Right, I'll just plug the GS into my friendly local 50Hz
           Alternating Cat, and
AFA Gary J Yes, the AC power would make the difference.
ShanoJ     away I'll go! :)
AFL Dyfet  The monitor is still synced for 60hz...
AFL Dyfet  I just bet it freaks out :)
Dave Lyons Jonah, do you have RGB?
ShanoJ     Ya, I've got the standard GS RGB monitor (not the fancy Mac
           one).
Dave Lyons Did you try adjusting the vertical-position/roll control?
ShanoJ     Ya, didn't help much. I couldn't get a stable picture....
Dave Lyons Bummer...
ShanoJ     Ya. I'll try again, though. Maybe the new position of the moon
           will help 
ShanoJ     things....
ShanoJ     :)
