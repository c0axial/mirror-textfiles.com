Topic:  Assembly Language Programming
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet)


AFL Dyfet  What seems to be the problem?
QMil Eric  Only problem I'm having is figureing out 50/60hz.
AFA Gary J Eric wants to detect the video hz.
AFL Dyfet  OIC...50hz euro vs 60hz american...
QMil Eric  <--- "Knight Ow1"
AFL Dyfet  I can think of a few possibilities...
AFA Gary J Yes...  That question has come up in here before, (I think in
           connection with
AFA Gary J viewing 3200 pics)
AFL Dyfet  My suggestion would have been to trap any verticle scan line irq,
           and count occurances over the system
AFL Dyfet  clock :)
AFL Dyfet  (real time clock)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Knight, I guess you have the first question
AFL Dyfet  for tonight :)
Knight Ow1 I was curious to if there was an easier way then by watching the
           verical
Knight Ow1 counter to see which range it's using.
AFL Dyfet  You just want to verify if you are running at 50hz or 60hz,
           correct?
Knight Ow1 Want to know which it is so the PIF knows how to handle the
           counter range.
AFL Dyfet  Well, my first thought is a bit crude...trap a
AFL Dyfet  scan line interrupt, and count how many you get
AFL Dyfet  over a second (measured by the real time clock)...
Knight Ow1 (So it can calculate the difference between two numbers)
AFL Dyfet  A simpler possibility would be to retreive the
AFL Dyfet  settings from the battery backup ram (using the
AFL Dyfet  misc toolset) assuming the bit involved is 
AFL Dyfet  documented.
AFL Dyfet  Well, my clock says 10p and we already have two
AFL Dyfet  questions in the queue :)...Does anyone else have
AFL Dyfet  a suggestion for detecting vertical retrace rate?
ShanoJ     I'm sure one of the bits in the back of the Firmware ref has it
           (assuming this
ShanoJ     is on a GS...).
AFL Dyfet  I assume Owl means a IIgs....
Knight Ow1 Yes GS, but I don't have the ref book and a friend couldn't locate
           the page.
AFA Gary J Parameter $1D in the battery RAM is supposed to contain the 50/60
           hz setting.
AFA Gary J (Just looking....)
AFA Gary J I'm not sure what value is supposed to be stored there.
AFL Dyfet  I don't have my books out here in 'Joisie', but I
AFL Dyfet  thought it was in there :)...ReadBParm will let you retrieve
           it...
AFA Gary J _ReadBParam
Knight Ow1 It's easy to check after I figure out the call.
JWankerl   Of course you should use the ReadBParm to get that value.
JWankerl   The reference number for 50/60 Hz is $1D as mentioned before.
Knight Ow1 What I was really interested in is an I/O location that can be
           read to get
Knight Ow1 the status or to find out there isn't one, like the volumne.
AFL Dyfet  Hmm...do not recall off-hand...if someone has the IIgs tech ref.
           handy, they may be able to help
AFL Dyfet  you Knight...
AFA Gary J I don't remember seeing a softswitch/register that covers the
           video Hz setting.
Knight Ow1 (I did write down the bramread call, $1d, for reference)
WinkieJim  Um, the only thing I can find is a NTSC/PAL softswitch
WinkieJim  Bit 4 or $E0C02B   0=NTSC PAL
WinkieJim  1=PAL...
ShanoJ     Anyone have NiftyList and wanna try the call? I tried, but AOL
           didn't like 
ShanoJ     that... :(
Matt DTS   (What's the question?)
ShanoJ     (Hiya Matt, Jim!)
AFA Gary J How to determine the video Hz setting, Matt.
AFA Gary J (50/60 Hz)
AFL Dyfet  Knight wanted to determine if the refresh rate was 60 or
           50hz....in some manner other than using
AFL Dyfet  readbparam...
Knight Ow1 Hi Matt, reading the status of 50/60hz setting.  Possible i/o
           location?
A2GS       Why would you want too?
JWankerl   The correct way to do it is _ReadBParm with a value of $1D - it
           will *always*
JWankerl   work.
WinkieJim  A2GS, you've seen the Star Trek GS game? The author toggled that
           to simulate
WinkieJim  a "HIT" on your ship 
A2GS       sounds exciting
AFA Gary J :)
ShanoJ     (and that toggling makes my monitor VERY unhappy... :( )
Knight Ow1 A2GS, I'm using the counter for timing and need to know which
           range of values
Knight Ow1 to expect.
AFL Dyfet  You only need to determine what it is once, Knight (or should only
           need to do it once :), so you could
AFL Dyfet  do it at the start of your program before getting into your
           critical timing areas...
Knight Ow1 (I'd like our friends accross the seas to be able to use my PIF)
A2GS       PIF?
AFA Gary J (PIF = permanant init file)
A2GS       How about writing code which is timed by cycle counts rather then
           using a HZ
A2GS       timer...now there's a challenge  :-)
A2GS       ah....haven't worked on one of those in quite awhile
JWankerl   Like instruction cycles?  Not good - what about accelerators?
AFA Gary J Doesn't work if you've got a Transwarp or Zip chip, A2GS :)
A2GS       sure...just check write 3 versions of your code  :-)
A2GS       kill the "check"
JWankerl   A2GS - why didn't I think of that?  Take the easy way out!  (uh
           huh...)
A2GS       :-)
Knight Ow1 The cycles are different for differently GS's (zipchip,
           transwarp)
Knight Ow1 and allowing interupts (the whole purpose of this PIF) messes up
           cycle timing.
Matt DTS   Why do you need to know this?
WinkieJim  Couldn't you use the tick counter?
Knight Ow1 ticks are to slow only 60 per second, I need >= 1000.
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt!  You have the floor...
Matt DTS   Why do we need to know 50 Hz vs. 60 Hz?
A2GS       use scan line interrupts..will those do??
BillP      good idea.   :)
Knight Ow1 The values the vertical counter gives is different for 50 and
           60hz.  I use
Knight Ow1 them for timing between speaker clicks to form a bell that allows
           interupts.
Matt DTS   Different how?
A2GS       why not just digitize the bell?
AFA Gary J A2GS :)  
Knight Ow1 The DOC may be inuse by an application and I'm not allowed to
           touch it.
A2GS       I give you premission  :_)
Knight Ow1 not good enough. :)
AFA Gary J (not on my machine!)
BillP      I don't like anyone touching my doc
WinkieJim  A2GS is herebye sentenced to life in the bad-programming jail
A2GS       Yay....after all these years someone finally recognizes my work 
           :-)
DangardAce If there's a bad programming jail, I know a lot of MS-DOSers on
           Death Row :)
AFL Dyfet  So you are using the vertical scan line counter as
AFL Dyfet  a millisecond timer?
Matt DTS   How are the vertical counters "different" in 50 Hz mode?
Knight Ow1 As a timer yes, cause interupts can take an unkown amoun t of
           time.
Knight Ow1 The values range from $64-$FF in 50hz and from $7D-$FF in 60hz.
Knight Ow1 When the value "wraps" I need to know how much to add/subtract.
Matt DTS   Oh, so you're using hard-coded value counters to know where the
           retrace beam is on the screen.  
Knight Ow1 No, I remember the last value when I made a click and when I'm 8+
           values higher
Knight Ow1 (counting wrap) I click again.
Knight Ow1 Plus the values server to calculate duration.
James S WI Wouldn't you know it's 50hz if you get a value from $64-$7C ?
Matt DTS   I was about to point that out but got busy looking for a manual.
A2GS       good point...
AFA Gary J Yeah, adjust on the fly :)
Knight Ow1 I can't garentee(sp) that I'll read the value $64-$7C when in
           50hz.
AFL Dyfet  I think this is a case of overdesign to 'adapt on the fly'...it
           would seem logical to me to retrieve
AFL Dyfet  the PAL/NTSC bram param at program startup, and if somebody really
           changes it on the fly, just have a
AFL Dyfet  warning in the docs that they need to restart...
Knight Ow1 An interupt can cause me to miss them.  BackgroundSound is a long
           interupt.
WinkieJim  I came in late, why don't you want to use the value stored in
           Battery RAM?
Matt DTS   The value stored in battery RAM should do the trick for you,
           actually, but I can't find any reference
Matt DTS   on other ways to determine the refresh rate.  GA.
Matt DTS   (By the way, the only Apple-supplied way to change that value is
           with Ctrl-OA-Opt-Reset, which isn't
Matt DTS   likely to happen without rebooting.  :)
JWankerl   Matt - WriteBParm and WriteBRAM will change it as well.
WinkieJim  The only program I know of that changes it is Star Trek Classic
AFL Dyfet  The bparm change will not take effect till reboot, though,
           Wankerl...
JWankerl   Hmmm... would the ToBRAM vector make it take effect immediately?
Knight Ow1 I wouldn't go to that extreame.
Knight Ow1 Thank you all for the ideas!
AFL Dyfet  I think this question has ran a little long, and Randy has been
           waiting for awhile now :)...We may
AFL Dyfet  get back to this a little later....GA Randy...
RandyT2    I have ORCA/M but I've never programmed in assembly. Any
           suggestions on 
RandyT2    books for beginners, etc.
AFL Dyfet  GA Winkie
WinkieJim  Apple IIgs Assembly Language Programming by Leo Scanlon, Batnum
           books
WinkieJim  That's what i used, although I knew 6502 first, but it covers the
           whole set
AFL Dyfet  Jonah...ga...
ShanoJ     I vote for Programming the Apple IIgs in Assembly Language, by
           Lichty and Eyes,
ShanoJ     and the companion Programming the 65816 including the 6502, 65C02,
           and 65802. I
ShanoJ     thought the Scanlon book was a little simplistic and didn't cover
           much info.:(
RandyT2    will it assume -> no <-  prior knowlegde of assembly ?
DYA Jim1   Yes, Randy.
JWankerl   Yah, the scanlong book was simplistic - I mostly use it for the
           opcode
JWankerl   reference in the back.  :-)
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt
RandyT2    I had the Lichty and Eyes (borrowed) and it lost me...oh well.
BillP      What about Rogers book?
RandyT2    Rogers book?
BillP      Wagner...  didn't he do a assembler book for the IIGS?
JWankerl   Assembly Lines?  Was awesome for just the normal II.
AFA Gary J Yes, but his (Roger Wagner's) is oriented toward Merlin.
AFA Gary J (Which is fine, if you use Merlin)
DYA Jim1   (I started with NO ASM experience with Lichty and Eyes, and it
           tought me :)
Matt DTS   (sorry)  I also vote for the Lichty and Eyes books...
Matt DTS   I've *heard* (but can't personally vouch) that the Scanlon book
           uses unsupported things in its samples
Matt DTS   (GA)
ShanoJ     Also, make sure you get all of the TB Refs and the GS/OS ref.
WinkieJim  Really Matt, maybe that's what screwed me up :) :)
A2GS       I started on the ORIGINAL Wagner book....NOW there was a GREAT
           book.
A2GS       The 8-bit book.
RandyT2    I spent alot of time changing Macro names with the Eyes book (it
           was geared  
RandyT2    for apw) and I was so involved in that that I got lost.
ShanoJ     OH, also the Programmers Introduction to the Apple IIgs from Apple
           is a good
ShanoJ     starting point for getting the CONCEPTS down before delving into
           the details.
Matt DTS   The Programmer's Intro is *not* an assembly tutorial, and it
           doesn't take advantage of any of
Matt DTS   the current ways to program the IIgs (extended controls,
           resources, etc.).  GA.
ShanoJ     Matt: true, but as I said it's a good place to get a handle on the
           CONCEPTS.
AFL Scott  (NewHandle?)
JWankerl   I heard that Morgan Davis did a GS assembly book, but from what I
           gather
JWankerl   it wasn't so hot.
AFA Gary J (I'll vote for the Lichty and Eyes book too)
ShanoJ     Ya, I've got the Davis one, too.... It's so-so.
AFL Dyfet  GA Jay
JJennings  The Davis/Gookin books are quite helpful for total GS beginners, I
           think.
RandyT2    ShanoJ   what was that about CONCEPTS, I think thats where I need
           help?
A2GS       One problem...recently I was looking for info on how to make SANE
           calls
A2GS       (not that I use them) and couldn't find ANY books (with the
           exception of
A2GS       Apple's own SANE book) which described making the calls,
           clearly.
JWankerl   SANE calls?  Now there's some sketchy documentation - as bad as
           AppleTalk docs!
ShanoJ     Randy: I'm suggesting Apple's Programmer's Intro to the IIgs. It
           is an old book
ShanoJ     and doesn't handle a lot of the newer things, but it'll help you
           understand
ShanoJ     what the toolbox is and how to use it, and simple concepts like
           handles versus
ShanoJ     pointers, etc.
RandyT2    Basic is the only real experience that I've had and the structure
           seem
RandyT2    very different
WinkieJim  Have we confused you enough Randy?
RandyT2    I think so, yes..
A2GS       Men: we've succeeded, at last.
AFL Dyfet  Eventually the fog of confusion clears...:)
WinkieJim  It takes me a day to get over this conference :)
RandyT2    I don't want to take all your time (time is money on AO) 
RandyT2    Thanks for all the help!
AFL Dyfet  Okay, let us go to Winkie's question then..GA Jim, you have the
           floor now...
AFL Dyfet  (good luck Randy)
WinkieJim  ok, CDEV question(s)
WinkieJim  First, if you want to draw something while you CDEV is active,
           when do you do 
WinkieJim  it? In the Run message or do you use the Event messgae and look
           for
WinkieJim  uppdate events?
WinkieJim  (spelling doesn't count) ga
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt
Matt DTS   A CDev is supposed to be entirely a list of extended controls -
           you're not supposed to "draw"
Matt DTS   anything else.  GA.
WinkieJim  Well, rats... :)
WinkieJim  2nd part:
WinkieJim  what is the difference between the INIT messgae and the create
           message?
AFL Dyfet  GA Wankerl
JWankerl   If you create someting in the INIT message, it will not be offset
           correctly -
JWankerl   it will overlay the icon list control.  ICK!
JWankerl   You're just supposed to set values for things you created in INIT.
            GA.
WinkieJim  Ok.
Matt DTS   Yeah, create them in CreateCDEV, set them up in InitCDEV.  (GA)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, do we have any other questions for tonight?
WinkieJim  Still bummed about not being able to draw in the window.
AFL Dyfet  GA James....
James S WI Could someone give show me an example of declaring a function in
           Orca/C ?
JWankerl   Winkie- use lots of picture controls.  :-)
AFL Dyfet  Do you mean a prototype or a function?
James S WI Declaring a FUNCTION
AFL Dyfet  I suppose the simples example might be the 'null'
AFL Dyfet  program, which could be done as:
AFL Dyfet  main(int argc, char **argv)  {};  :)
James S WI is   int my_func(int, int);   correct?
AFL Dyfet  That is a prototype, not a function.  The prototype
AFL Dyfet  is used to 'model' the function.  You would then use something
           like:
AFL Dyfet  int my_func(int parm1, int parm2)  { stuff }; later
AFL Dyfet  on to actually show what it does...
ShanoJ     (Uhh... Isn't this kinda covered in the _manual_?)
James S WI I don't under stand the book.  I think I know the difference
           between 
James S WI define and declare and can define but not declare
AFL Dyfet  Scott, go ahead....
AFL Scott  Isn't defining a function done only when it used after main?  I
           mean if you
AFL Scott  follow pascal style, you'll reduce the need for declaring (whoops
           on the 
AFL Scott  earlier "defining" bit, I meant declaring)... I usually only
           define macros
AFL Scott  when I code.  GA.
AFL Dyfet  Sometimes 'forward' references to functions are unavoidable. 
           Prototypes are also needed when you
AFL Dyfet  have external functions...
AFL Dyfet  GA Bill...
BillP      When you talk about "define" in C,  you're talking about a
           compiler directive...
BillP      to define as Scott said,  a macro or constant.
BillP      ie...
BillP      #define  NULL   0
BillP      talking about a declare usually refers to what everyone is talking
           about with prototyping.
BillP      which is always a good idea and will save you alot of hassles.
BillP      Most compliers don't require prototyping but...
BillP      it will save you from having to re cast variables that you're
           passing.
BillP      I usually have a  .h file for every  .c file...
BillP      and the .h file contains function prototypes for each funtion in
           the C,
BillP      ga
James S WI OK.  I think I have it.  Thanks!
BillP      helps you clean up alot of warnings when you compile.
BillP      ga again.  :)
James S WI return;             (GA)
AFL Dyfet  In C++ prototyping is mandatory....exit(0);
AFL Dyfet  GA Bill...(seems we have a signal exception :)
BillP      one last note...    with a #define..      you don't end the
           statement with a   ;
BillP      ga
AFL Dyfet  Okay, do we have any more questions for tonight?
AFL Dyfet  GA A2...
A2GS       This is completely offbeat and really doesn't even belong in this
           conference
A2GS       room, But.....
A2GS       What types of games interest people....in other words what would
           you like
A2GS       to see on the GS?
A2GS       GA
AFL Dyfet  Galactic Empire (he asked....:)
DYA Jim1   fast arcade action. :)
JWankerl   Dragon's Lair.  :-)
A2GS       That's being worked on by READYSoft.
AFL Marty  Dragon's Lair?
BillP      Readysoft is doing IIGS????
A2GS       yez
A2GS       They did Space Ace
JWankerl   Well Space Ace wasn't my idea of a fun game.
A2GS       Not the way they wrote it....I agree.
BillP      Would you believe, my favorite IIGS game is online as shareware?
A2GS       Darts?
A2GS       :-)
AFA Gary J :)
James S WI YES
AFL Scott  No, Bill, I refuse to accept that! :) LOL!:)
BillP      :P
AFL Scott  What's the game, dude?
BillP      I was wondering anyone was going to ask..  Milstone (Mil Bourne)
BillP      action card game with great use of graphics and digitized sounds
JWankerl   What about puzzle from the Desktop on System Disk 1.0, eh?  :-)
DYA Jim1   You mean MouseDesk, Joe. :)
DYA Jim1   or whatever the name was.. some funny name.. DHR!  (puke!)
A2GS       I'm surprised that people don't have a wider range of interests
           other then
A2GS       "something which is action packed"
AFL Dyfet  Galactic Empire is NOT an arcade game :)
A2GS       Excuuuuuuse me :-)
AFA Gary J (Galactic Empire was a good one)
JWankerl   Well, Sword of Sodan would be nice, too.
DYA Jim1   RISK!!!
DYA Jim1   I've been playing it at school during study hall for a week now
           and I'm
DYA Jim1   addicted. :)  Risk GS
A2GS       That's already available for the 8-bit II
A2GS       RISK that is
DYA Jim1   I want a mac version, in color on my GS. :) maybe I'll do it
           eventually. :)
A2GS       Good luck.
BillP      I agree,  I only have the mac version.  It was done real well.
DYA Jim1   It's real fun. :)
A2GS       Nothing else?  3-D type game....Sierra type adventure?
AFL Marty  Does it have to be a game?
James S WI I would like a game that has opponents with some level of AI.
DYA Jim1   Sure, go for 3-d as well! :)  if it's done WELL
JWankerl   A good GS flight simulator like SkyFox would be awesome.
AFL Dyfet  You mean a "Leasure user Lenny" style adventure game?? :)
BillP      Lemmings
A2GS       Yes....since that seems to be the GS' weakest spot (next to
           Apple,
A2GS       not including the II Team at Apple, of course)
AFL Dyfet  Or, Bolo...\
James S WI Action is nice but not to fun when it's U agents 1,000 and U
           win.
JWankerl   Or Bilestoad.
JWankerl   Remakes of the old classics... ahhh...
AFL Scott  I'd like to see a good war strategy game on the GS. 
A2GS       SSI type game, you mean?
AFL Scott  Yeah, but something that can have scenarios/terrain programmed and
           something
AFL Scott  that uses realistic odds.
AFL Dyfet  I'd like to see something like user expandable games....
A2GS       you want terrain....I got about a thousand golf games for the
           GS.
AFL Dyfet  OIC, Scott is along the same thought pattern :)
A2GS       :-)
AFL Scott  m|m
ShanoJ     What's thay saying? Demented minds think alike?
AFL Marty  I'm curious why you asked.
A2GS       Well....let's just say for now...I'm planning with a few of my
           colleagues for
A2GS       the future.
JWankerl   2 player games over the modem or AppleTalk would be great - head
           to head stuff.
James S WI If the game is head to head there is a chance that your opponent
           will have AI
AFL Marty  Some kind of simulation would be nice.
AFL Scott  NetTrek!
AFL Dyfet  Why stop at 2 players with Appletalk :)
A2GS       Yes...but what the potential market for those type of games?
AFA Gary J (I've got one of those in the works, but the speed seems to be a
           problem)
AFA Gary J (modem speed, that is)
Matt DTS   I'd *love* to see some multi-player AppleTalk games.  We might
           never finish new system software.
Matt DTS   :)
AFL Dyfet  X-Trek, as revised at Berkeley, is cool!
AFL Scott  I wonder how hard it would be to port some Xwindows network games
           to use
AFL Scott  AppleTalk? Hmm...
AFL Dyfet  Some parts of BSD unix came out of X-Trek development, Matt :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I guess we can get to Gary's q then...
AFA Gary J This question was posed by JJennings in our message boards, but
           I've been
AFA Gary J wondering about it too (since I have been reviewing all the
           uploads here).
AFA Gary J Recently we've seem to have a ton of "custom toolsets" uploaded
AFA Gary J , and each one seems to be picking their own number for their
           use. (i.e.
AFA Gary J Tool069, Tool208, etc.)  Some seem to conflict with others that
           have been
AFA Gary J released.  Is there an Apple defined way of obtaining a toolset
           number, or is
AFA Gary J it a free-for-all?  What's the correct thing to do?  (I would say
           NEVER use a
AFA Gary J user toolset, if it were up to me) GA
ShanoJ     DON"T STEAL SYSTEM TOOLSET NUMBERS!! I HATE THAT!!!!!!
ShanoJ     Gary: Use a user toolset...
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt....
Matt DTS   Some people are obviously having trouble understanding this, so
           I'll use capital letters:
Matt DTS   ALL SYSTEM TOOL SET NUMBERS ARE RESERVED FOR APPLE; NONE ARE
           AVAILABLE FOR THIRD PARTIES TO USE.
JWankerl   YEA MATT!  APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE!!!  I wish people would learn.
Matt DTS   If you find a programmer who can't understand this, get him a copy
           of Toolbox Reference Volume 3 and
Matt DTS   HIT HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH IT.  (I'd say IIgs TN #73, too, but
           that wouldn't hurt.)  GA.
AFA Gary J :)
AFA Gary J I agree with that.  
A2GS       :-)
AFL Dyfet  Hit him hard! :)
AFA Gary J I'd say, use the entire reference set across his head :)
AFA Gary J (except he might not recover from that)
A2GS       Then why was the info for creating these toolsets provided in the
           first place?
Matt DTS   We never provided info for creating system toolsets.  It just so
           happens that they're identical
Matt DTS   to user tool sets except in how they're installed.  Some smart
           people figured this out.  GA.
JWankerl   System and User toolsets are programmed the same way-just
           installed differently
A2GS       oh....ok
AFL Marty  (elaborate a little, please)
Matt DTS   Marty:  You'll have to ask a more specific question to get more
           specific information.
A2GS       What's the difference in installation?
AFL Marty  What is the difference between a system and a user toolset?
A2GS       Is that what you meant, Marty?
AFL Marty  (i.e. in what way are they installed differently)?
Matt DTS   System tools go in the *:System:Tools folder and are installed
           with LoadOneTool.  User tools can go
Matt DTS   anywhere and are installed with InitialLoad2 and SetTSPtr.
Matt DTS   System tools are called through $E10000 or $E10004, user tools are
           called through $E10008 or $E1000C.
Matt DTS   End of differences.  GA.
AFL Marty  Thank you.
James S WI Why can't we make system tools or is there just no reason?
JWankerl   Because you can make user tools instead.  :-)
Matt DTS   System tool numbers are reserved for Apple.
Matt DTS   We keep them so we can use them for new tools.  The user tool set
           mechanism was created for this
Matt DTS   reason.
Matt DTS   Why?
A2GS       There's always the possibility that a Users toolset # will be the
           same as
A2GS       a future release of Apple's Toolset#.
Matt DTS   Because there's only 255 tool numbers possible, and that's not
           enough for Apple to have lots and still
Matt DTS   assign a tool number to every one who wants one.
Matt DTS   A2GS:  User tools are parallel but separate to system tools - the
           numbers don't collide.
AFL Dyfet  There are also only 255 possible system tools...there isn't enough
           territory there to avoid
AFL Dyfet  conflicts between Apple and different users with toolset
           needs...or as Matt just said :)
AFA Gary J :)
Matt DTS   For example, if you install FakeModalDialog as user tool #1, it
           doesn't interfere with the Tool
Matt DTS   Locator.  <GA>
A2GS       I know....I was just pointing out, what could happen if the User
           created
A2GS       a toolset as a SYSTEM toolset and then gave it his own random
           toolset #.
JWankerl   It would work until Apple made a toolset of the same number.
AFL Dyfet  Or until someone else also used that number...:)
A2GS       The question is.....will the GS last long enough for Apple to
           reach toolset #
JWankerl   (Although I don't know why you'd do that - the user toolset way
           is
JWankerl   *much* more flexible!)
A2GS       255?
JWankerl   A2GS - 255 is already taken - by GSBug.  :-)
A2GS       ok....254  :-)
AFL Dyfet  It's lasted long enough for the few people who have made use of
           system tools to conflict with each
AFL Dyfet  other already! :)
A2GS       That's no big feat -)
A2GS       oops forgot the eyes  :
AFA Gary J (with popular numbers)
AFL Dyfet  :)
Matt DTS   Yeah...what are the chances two people would both pick the same
           obscure number...69?
Matt DTS   :)
AFA Gary J LOL! :)
AFL Dyfet  It's happened already :)
AFA Gary J Well, that was exactly the point of my question.  I thought
           people were 
AFA Gary J supposed to know better than that, but apparently not :)
JWankerl   Apparently not.
AFA Gary J (I just copy the tool to my system folder long enough to test the
           upload, then
AFA Gary J delete the thing :)
JWankerl   (I'd tell 'em to rewrite it before you release it :-)
Matt DTS   You could be bold and refuse uploads that do such stupid things.
AFA Gary J :)
AFA Gary J That would certainly be a way of getting the "word" out of not
           using the tool
AFA Gary J numbers.
AFL Dyfet  I am not a proponent of censorship, except in the most extreme of
           cases...however, one can make an
AFL Dyfet  argument against releasing 'defective' software that may cause
           damage, and could consider software
AFL Dyfet  that abuses system tools in a similar manner...
AFA Gary J Perhaps a warning (to the downloader) in the file description
           would be 
AFA Gary J appropriate :)
AFA Gary J WARNING:  THIS PIECE OF SOFTWARE DOES NOT CONFORM TO APPLE
           STANDARDS.  USE AT
AFA Gary J YOUR OWN RISK!! :)
AFL Dyfet  Well, a broad-minded warning such as that would have to be
           attached to more than just tool abusers
AFL Dyfet  :)
Matt DTS   You could put them all in a "Software that breaks the rules"
           library.  :)
AFA Gary J Yep :)
AFA Gary J Well, I agree with you Dave, I have never been one to censor
           anything (unless
AFA Gary J of course it violates AO Terms of Service :)
James S WI I wunder if that folder would be bigger than all the others. :(
AFL Dyfet  The question there becomes what constitutes 'breaking the
           rules'....what about lesser misdeeds,
AFL Dyfet  such as simple filetype misuse....:)
AFL Dyfet  Where do you draw the line.....
Matt DTS   File type misuse:  Death by hanging.  Simple.
AFL Dyfet  And let's not forget 'illegal memory location' users, 'call
           patchers' (a practice common to
AFL Dyfet  Byteworks/APW/ORCA/M for shell calls through GS/OS :)
AFA Gary J Hmmm... I think the software libraries on AO would become VERY
           sparce :)
Matt DTS   Patching calls isn't illegal, just not always very smart.
Matt DTS   In a shell's case, it's the defined and accepted way to do it. 
           APW does it (Apple-labeled).
AFL Dyfet  Some feel the same way about filetype misuse, Matt :)
AFL Dyfet  But it is a good point you raised Matt....goodnight...
AFL Dyfet  Goodnight all...
