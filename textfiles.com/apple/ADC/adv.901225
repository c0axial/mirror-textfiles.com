Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar  (AFL Dyfet)

HyperWare1 Does anyone here have APW?
Coach101   Yes...
HyperWare1 How much is it?
AFA Gary J Yes
AFA Gary J Get ORCA/M:  $39 
HyperWare1 How much for ORCA/C
Goalie5    Is Orca shell the same as APW shell?
Jupiter Re $80 from programs plus
AFA Gary J Hmmm...  ORCA/C $150?  But you should be able to get it for around
           $75 or so.
FeinDavid  Yeah... Apple's new DEVELOP magazine had articles for the IIgs on
           how to 
FeinDavid  program the IIgs using your MAcintosh!
Goalie5    Does anyone in here have a MAC???
FeinDavid  I just ordered a Mac Classic.
FeinDavid  To go ALONG with my GS!  Not replace!
HyperWare1 Burn him
HyperWare1 Can't you use the Apple IIgs, on applelink?
DangardAce Yes you can but the software looks like it was written in old
           Pascal.
AFA Gary J AppleLink on an Apple II is junk, from what I hear.
DangardAce It is junk.  It works like the old AppleLink software, only
           worse.
DangardAce There's like maybe 50 Mac messages as opposed to ONE Apple II
           message there
Goalie5    I got a friend with a mac.  Does DiskCopy come with all macs?
FeinDavid  Hey... I'm a firm GS supporter... Gary! Help!  Yes. Disckcopy
           comes with all
FeinDavid  Macs...
AFA Gary J I'll vouch for FeinDavid :)   He IS a firm GS supporter.
FeinDavid  Thanx Gary.... 8)
Goalie5    I;d like to become a developer.
HyperWare1 I'm 13, so I can't.
Goalie5    Coach, do all MACS come with DiskCopy?
Coach101   I am not sure.... I do not think so.  It is however
Coach101   on the CDs that have been distributed with DEVELOP.
Goalie5    I don't have those CD's.  I'm calling my friend with a MAC and
           have him call 
Goalie5    and try to get DiskCopy off of here.
HyperWare1 Well, I can't afford a MAC, and where do you get all this stuff,
           you guys are
HyperWare1 talking about?
Goalie5    Is DiskCopy available on here?
Goalie5    And DeHex
Coach101   I do not know....  Try the MUT and MDV forums..
AFA Gary J What do you need DiskCopy for?
Goalie5    To Decompress System 5.0.4
AFA Gary J Hmmm.  Ok.
Goalie5    I got system 5.0.4 but it needs Stuffit, DeHex and DiskCopy
SteveB     System 5.0.4???
SteveB     Oh, mac :)
Goalie5    I got it from Apple this afternoon
AFA Gary J If you wait a few weeks, 5.0.4 should be available online here.
Goalie5    No GS system 5.0.4
Goalie5    I have it right here on my Hard Drive
Goalie5    (Compressed)
SteveB     yep, in a few weeks :)
Goalie5    Then I'll throw it up here for everyone
Coach101   You can not put 5.0.4 here for release Goalie....
Goalie5    Why not????  ::Sniff::
Coach101   Only an Apple authorized copy can be place here for
Coach101   downloading....
Goalie5    That's what Apple said to use..
Coach101   Not that you have done anything wrong, but your
Coach101   personal copy can not be put up for down loading..
AFA Gary J Correct.  It must be the electronic distribution licensed copy.
AFA Gary J Stuffit AND DiskCopy?  I don't understand.  (I'm really not
           familiar with
AFA Gary J DiskCopy, even though I do have a Mac)
DangardAce Stuffit alone can do it.
FeinDavid  How did you get it from Apple?
Goalie5    I FTP'ed it from APple (Don't ask)
DangardAce Oh really?
FeinDavid  Is it golden?
DangardAce 5.0.4 is on Apple.Apple.com?
AFL Dyfet  I gather it is Ace...
Goalie5    Yup, Ace.  FTP'ed it this morning
Goalie5    I got it from MCImail and my BBS
DangardAce Anyone know any public access Unixs? :)
AFL Dyfet  My site at home is tied to North Western U...:)
Goalie5    OIC. :)  Mine is tied to Crash Timeshare
AFC TAP    Mine is tied to my watch...
Goalie5    :)
HyperWare1 How can you get on Apple.COm
HyperWare1 How can I get on AppleLink, Apple Edition??????????????
Coach101   HyperWare, one way to get on AppleLink Apple Edition is to become
           an Apple Partner (aka
Coach101   Certified Developer in the old days)...
HyperWare1 I can't, I'm only 13, you have to be 18.
Goalie5    BRB, checking Mac forums
DangardAce Try MUT first,
Goalie5    ok.
DangardAce they have all that unpacking muck for the Muck.
SteveB     My First ADV Conference! :)
AFL Dyfet  Welcome aboard Steve!
SteveB     Thank you Dave! :)
SteveB     Hey Scott!!!!!!!!! :)
DangardAce Scott! Merry Christmas!
AFL Scott  Hi Steve, Pete, Scott, everyone! Merry Christmas to you all!
Coach101   Good evening Scott
AFA Gary J Hi Scott!
AFL Scott  Hiya, Coach!
SteveB     Merry Christmas Scott! :)
AFL Scott  Hiya Gary!
AFL Scott  Yo!  Marty!!!
AFL Marty  Yo!
SteveB     Yo Marty! Merry Christmas!!! :)
AFL Dyfet  So what did St. Woz bring you all this Christmas?  :)
SteveB     the EXELLENT AFL's are here!!  ;)
AFL Scott  LOL!
AFA Gary J :)
Coach101   :)
SteveB     Including dave, of course! ;)
AFL Scott  I got a Union suit!  I love it!
Coach101   Nice 
Coach101   Christmas card AGR Staff!
AFL Scott  Thanks, Coach! It was all Teds work!  He's very industrious!
SteveB     St/ Woz gave me a 40 meg HD :)
FeinDavid  St. Woz gave me crud.
AFL Dyfet  Among other things, St. Woz performed an Apple-mas miracle, and
           ressurected my
AFL Dyfet  IW II for me :)
AFA Gary J :)
DangardAce St. Woz game me a lump of Mac for all the badmouthing I've given
           Apple.
AFA Gary J A lump of Mac? 
AFL Marty  Geez Pete... you must've been extra terrible this year.
DangardAce Quite.
AFA Gary J One of the best things I saw for sale at Applefest was being sold
           at the wrong
AFA Gary J side of the show.  It was a little stuffed Macintosh that you are
           supposed to
AFA Gary J through against the wall, and that sort of thing, when you get
           mad.  They were
AFA Gary J selling them on the MAC side of the conference, though, and I
           think they would
AFA Gary J have done better selling them on the Apple II side :)
DangardAce I had one, Gary.  Wore it out. :)
A2GS       BTW was there a new issue of "II at work" at the Fest??
AFA Gary J Not that I saw, A2GS
DangardAce Barney didn't even bother to show, Alb.
A2GS       Was Barney Stone at the show?
DangardAce No.
DangardAce I saw glimpses of Tom Weishaar.
A2GS       and, scott???????
Jupiter Re st.woz got me a zip chip gsx 1600
FeinDavid  Congrats Jupiter!
FeinDavid  Like it?
Jupiter Re yeah its nice...
SteveB     Poor Jonah.....still not connected :((
FeinDavid  So, How do I get the ROM revision number for the IIgs?
DangardAce Turn it on :)
SteveB     Dave, check out some sample...
SteveB     source code in the ADV libs. :)
FeinDavid  No, not by turning it on...
FeinDavid  grrr...
AFL Scott  Read the firmware ref. manual, Dave.  They have it in there!:)
FeinDavid  checking....
SteveB     There is sample code (in CP) in the ADV libs!! :)
AFL Dyfet  There is a firmware call...$FE1F, I believe, which will return the
           rom id # on
AFL Dyfet  a IIgs.
AFL Dyfet  It's all in the firmware ref. manual, as Scott said :)
AFL Scott  Who here get's Apple Direct?
FeinDavid  Why
Coach101   I do
DangardAce Alb, don't you get it?
A2GS       Sorta, kinda, not really, sometimes  :)
AFL Scott  What'd you think of the lead article?
DangardAce What was the lead article?  "Find A Deep Pit And Deposit Your GS
           In It?"
Coach101   It was not really a surprise to me
A2GS       oh
AFL Scott  It was called "The Age of Discovery"... No surprise to me
           either.
FeinDavid  What is the lead article?  What is it?
A2GS       What was the lead article in Apple Direct?
DangardAce The Age Of Discovering Your GS is A Goner?
AFL Scott  Scroll up a few lines, A2GS!:)
DangardAce Synopses, please!
A2GS       Yeah, but what was discussed in the article, as if I didn't
           know?
AFL Scott  (let's let Steve finish his question)
SteveB     thanks Scott :)
AFL Dyfet  Yes Steve?
SteveB     This is a techy question.... :)
SteveB     Yo Rick! Merry X-mas! :)
RTAFT      Hi Gang! Merry Christmas!
AFL Dyfet  Okay...let's give some room for Steve here....What's your
           question?
SteveB     OK, I need some clues on how to respond to one of the SFP
           calls.... :)
SteveB     Std file toolbox :)
SteveB     Ok...
SteveB     In the SFPGetFile2 call, I need to define a ....
SteveB     procedure to handle clicking events...
SteveB     in the dialog. Now, I used the following...
SteveB     This is in Complete Pascal:
SteveB     SFPGetFile2(20,20,nil,refIsPointer,Ref(@'testing'),
SteveB     nil,nil,Dlog,Definition,Reply);
SteveB     Now, I defined Definition as this:
SteveB     Procedure definition(Button: Integer);
SteveB     But, when I compile and run, it freezes. Why? :(
SteveB     ::Great minds working:::   ;)
AFL Dyfet  ::buzz::  ::clank:: :)
SteveB     LOL! :)
AFA Gary J Wait 'till spring.  It'll thaw by then :)
A2GS       Suggestion....: send a note to either Dave Lyons or Matt
           Deatherage (Matt DTS)
A2GS       explaining your problem.
SteveB     hehe..anyone know? :)
AFL Dyfet  Not off-hand....
Coach101   Searching for the book..... Wait one....
SteveB     Thanks coach! :)
SteveB     the SFP calls really give me a hard time :)
SteveB     (Talk about a question of the year! :)
A2GS       They're actually VERY easy to deal with in Assembly Language
           compared with other
A2GS       tool calls.
SteveB     Yea, I DLed Jonah's code, but no help there :)
A2GS       I believe his code was for a "Custon SFO" window.
SteveB     In ASM, all you have to di is pull it off the stack...not so easy
           in Pascal! :)
A2GS       exactly
AFA Gary J It could be the way you have variables defined (since nothing
           really seems
AFA Gary J obvious from your values).  Like, are variables words or long.
AFA Gary J What I'd do if I were you (assuming that all your values turn out
           to be right)
AFA Gary J is drop into Nifty List (or GSBug) and list it out in assembly,
           to see exactly what's
AFA Gary J going on the stack.  That'll reveal any inconsistancies.
SteveB     Yep, is it a LongInt?
AFL Scott  Steve, you shouldn't have to test for a click.  SFP does that for
           you.  If you don't need a custom
AFL Scott  SF dialog don't use SFP, just stick with SF.
SteveB     Well scott, I'm using the SFP to make up my own dialog :)
SteveB     SFP dialog :)
A2GS       if anything it should be SFO (Standard File Operations)
Coach101   Steve, this question crossed into pascal syntax
SteveB     Yup...
Coach101   which is not in my scope, but it looks to me like
Coach101   a pascal routine that is expecting two parameters
Coach101   ItemHit and DialogPort will work just fine...
Coach101   ga
A2GS       BTW is this a Put or a Get Dialog?
SteveB     It's a put. :)
A2GS       I would assume Put (SFP)
SteveB     Coach!! Thanks!!!! :)
SteveB     So, its:
Coach101   I do not remember the arguement order on the stack
Coach101   for Pascal so you may have to invert the arguements
SteveB     Procedure HandleJunk(Button: Integer; Dlog: WindpwPtr);
Coach101   from the way I listed them....  ga
SteveB     right? :)
Coach101   By the way, why use SFP?
SteveB     SFPPutFile2?
Coach101   The straight SF would avoid your problem.
SteveB     Well, what other options other than SFP do I have?
Coach101   The stack order is: DialogPort, ItemHit, RTL
SteveB     So coach, how would I define a def procedure?
SteveB     As far as you can tell.. :)
Coach101   SFPutFile2 does not require the interaction with
Coach101   your program and puts up a standard save dialog box.
SteveB     SFPPutFile2, is what I mean.
Coach101   The SFPPut...  is for a custom Dialog box.  ga
SteveB     What I want to do is define my OWN dialog...I know...
Coach101   Then you need what you are using.....   
Coach101   The discussion on the DialogHitProcedure is in
Coach101   toolbox volume II   ga
SteveB     I only have TB III :(
SteveB     <-- St. Woz wasn't good to me :(
Coach101   What are you writing SteveB?
SteveB     So, it should go something like this:::
SteveB     Oh, a Word processor! Have all the code, and just need to
SteveB     put in custom SF dialogs :)
SteveB     Procedure HandleJunk(Button: Integer; Dlog: WindowPtr);   right?
           :)
Coach101   Either that or reverse the argument order..
SteveB     I should have taken up Assembly. ;)
SteveB     Ok, Dlog, then Button :)
Coach101   Do you know what actions the system is expecting of your
           routine?
Coach101   Oops........ !!!!!!   ERROR   !!!!!!
SteveB     Yup; if it is SF's strict controls, then just exit the proc and
           let SF handle 
SteveB     it...
Coach101   Both ItemHit and DialogPort are LONGs...   32 bits each......
SteveB     But, if its mine, then I use GetDitemValue and SetDItemvalue...
           :)
SteveB     Hmmm....
Coach101   Also, if you set ItemHit to 0 (zero) indicates that your dialog
           hit routine handled the hit...
Coach101   Leave it unchanged and SF will do the work for you...
SteveB     Procedure HandletheThing(Button: LongInt; Window: Longint);
           right?
SteveB     or visa-versa... :)
Coach101   Yeah, the call will looks good (50/50 chance on
Coach101   parameter order) but you might want to make the last item a
           pointer to the proper record type
Coach101   to ease your use of it.   ga
SteveB     So, what do you mean by pointer?
SteveB     making the last item?
Coach101   WindowPtr
SteveB     Ohh....Dlog:WindowPtr...ok! :)
Coach101   Right....
SteveB     So, the final output SHOULD be... :)
SteveB     Procedure TheBetterWork(Item:LongInt:Win:WindowPtr);
Coach101   Looks good to me.  If you do nothing in your
Coach101   routine, then things should work (without crashing)
Coach101   I would perform that test first to make sure that
Coach101   the linkage from SFP to you is OK (for example,
Coach101   not destroying the stack by taking too many or too few bytes off
           the stack).
Coach101   Once that seems to work, start adding whatever code you need to
           you procedure...   ga
SteveB     How do I find out if the routine is paking too many bytes off the
           stack?
SteveB     With NiftyList?
Coach101   Without using a debugger (like GSBug) and stepping
Coach101   through your program, just see if crashes under
Coach101   repetitive and varied use... ga
SteveB     Ok...now to convert a longInt to a Integer, I use "@TheLongInt",
           right? :)
SteveB     Or do I just use the longInt in the SetDItemValue?
SteveB     Directly?
Coach101   Does SetDItemValue want a 32 or 16 bit integer?
SteveB     I don't know; I only have TB Ref III :(
SteveB     Anyone know?
Coach101   Oops... Forgot that...  Wait one while I dig up TB I
SteveB     WAIT...needs a 16 bit...
SteveB     I think... :)
SteveB     Sorry guys for spending the whole hour on this :)
Coach101   I do not know Pascal and that is a Pascal ?
SteveB     Yes...
Coach101   Dyfet: how does one say 16BitInt = 32BitInt in Pascal?
AFA Gary J That's my problem, I don't know Pascal either :)
Coach101   Gary, lets vote Dyfet the Pascal type :)
AFL Dyfet  Pascal has automatic casting rules for int/long conversion....
SteveB     That's my problem; I should have learned Assembly!!!! ;)
AFL Dyfet  I am the C person, NOT Pascal :)
Coach101   So he just says it and the compiler will do thw work for him....
Coach101   SteveB.....
SteveB     Yes...
AFL Dyfet  Yes...
Coach101   The consensus of the non-Pascal types is just code
SteveB     Ok...
Coach101   a statement that assigns a short intger the value from a long
           integer and we expect
Coach101   that the compiler will take the low 16 bits for you.  ga
SteveB     So, where the SetDItemvalue call wants a integer var, I put the
           LongInt?
AFL Dyfet  Since the function is always defined first in Pascal, the size of
           arguments
AFL Dyfet  being passed are already known (this is not always the case in C,
           for example),
Coach101   Yes Steve, use an assignment statement (=:) and
Coach101   the compiler will only move 16 bits for you...
AFL Dyfet  so type conversion should occur...
AFL Dyfet  (well actually casting)
AFL Dyfet  (type conversion as such is more an ADA thing)
SteveB     Ok, thanks! I'll report to all of you what the results are!! :)
Coach101   But, going from 32 to 16 bits is conversion!!!
AFL Dyfet  The same int functions operate on 32 and 16 bit integers
           (+/-/etc), which
AFL Dyfet  implies it performs value casting much like C...
SteveB     I see...the same as an integer...ok! Thanks A LOT coach!! :)
SteveB     And Dave, too! :)
AFL Dyfet  (incidently if it wont accept the value, the Pascal compiler will
           report a
AFL Dyfet  type mismatch)
AFL Dyfet  (so it wont allow incorrect code, at least :)
SteveB     thanks Dave :)
