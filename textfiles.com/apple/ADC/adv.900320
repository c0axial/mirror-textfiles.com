Topic:  Programming Environments
Forum Leader:  Gary Jacobson (AFA Gary J)  

AFA Gary J Welcome to the Apple II Development Forum
AFA Gary J Tonight's topic is "Programming Environments"
AFA Gary J It looks like we need to use forum PROTOCOL, so....
AFA Gary J If you have a question, type a "?" on a line by itself, or if you
           have
AFA Gary J a comment on the current topic, type a "!" on a line by itself. 
           It looks
AFA Gary J like "Mac Hater" got the first question in.  GA, Mac Hater
Mac Hater  has Nicholas expanded on his post "there will be a new development
           tool within
Mac Hater  72 hours.."  or does anyone (who can tell us) say more?  sounds
           pretty fun.
Mac Hater  ga
A2GS       Drop the ! and make it a ?
Mac Hater  guess not.  :)  ga
AFA Gary J I guess no one's talking, Mac Hater.  Anyone?
Mac Hater  ga with the next question
AFA Gary J Ok.. GA, A2.
A2GS       Not a direct programming Q, but does deal with Devloping for the
           II....
A2GS       As far as I can tell, Apples opinion/marketing of the II
           stinks....
A2GS       Is there anything we can do change it?????????
AFA Gary J GA, Pest
Pest II    I think that perhaps that's a little strong...
A2GS       You can't be serious?!
Pest II    I think that there are many people at Apple who'd like to see a
           healthy AppleII
Pest II    perhaps they aren't the "right people" though...what I'd do is
           write to the 
A2GS       Yes, But I'm referring to the guy's who make the $$ decisions (ex.
           marketing)
Pest II    "powers that be" the people who can indeed change that sort of
           thing
Pest II    Unless you want to infiltrate Apple (like I do :-))
A2GS       Unfortunately there have been dozens of writing campaigns and it
           doesn't look
A2GS       like they've accomplished anything.
AFA Gary J GA with your comment, Tracy
AFL TracyP Barney Stone's group may have turned around the top-echelon
Matt DTS   There have been dozens of campaigns *discussed*.  I personally
           don't know of one that happened.
AFL TracyP of marketeers at Apple, but apparently those efforts
Pest II    Me niether Matt
AFL TracyP have yet to translate to the rank-and-file.  How else do you
A2GS       That is a possibility, Matt, But either way I'm sure the head hogs
           know
AFL TracyP explain Apple's announcement of the DMA SCSI card st week,
AFL TracyP then a big party for a whole herd of Mac announcements
A2GS       how II people feel and a letter won't make any difference (nor
           will 10,000
A2GS       letters, unfortunately)
AFL TracyP yesterday?  Why not include the SCSI announcement with the
AFL TracyP rest?  Or is Apple still trying to tell us they're ashamed of the
           A2?
AFL TracyP done
A2GS       Yes, I think they are.
AFA Gary J Interesting point, Tracy
AFA Gary J GA, Danny
AFA DannyH I don't want to sound like an apoligist for Apple but, I think
           Apple has done
AFA DannyH one helluva job for the Apple II users for the last TWO
           years....
AFA DannyH we hanve seen new peripherrals and new computers as well
AFA DannyH as a lot of new System Software with prromises
AFA DannyH of even more to come, GA
A2GS       Oh come on......there hasn't been an ad for a II in the past 2
           years
A2GS       and in that time I've seen 100's of Mac ads, saw one a few days
           ago!!!
A2GS       Big deal!!!
A2GS       I'm talking about future developments (ex. machines) as well as
           Marketing
A2GS       which will make the machine strong and improve 3rd party
           development, which
A2GS       as this point is virtually Nill, except for a few loyal companies.
A2GS       Done.
AFA Gary J I think we all could run on this topic all night, but it's true,
           that's not
AFA Gary J what we're here for.
LordRoland I agree --> new topic.
AFA Gary J Let's move on to Markus's question.  GA, Markus
Markus     I've heard APW is going to be updated. Has anyone heard anything?
           ga
A2GS       I warned you this wouldn't be a programming Q  :)
AFA Gary J GA, Roland
LordRoland Yeah, APW is being updated.  I don't know much though.  New linker
           and stuff.
Micol Sys  Any day now, from what I hear
Markus     Any idea how soon?
LordRoland Or am I thinking of ORCA?
AFA Gary J GA, Coach
Micol Sys  Or sometime in the near future (next few months)
Tamira     didn't APW 3 just come out???
Coach101   In the last 6 months Apple issued an update for APW (tools and
           interfaces)
Coach101   that included a new linker, librarian, REZ and DeREZ tools.
Markus     Yep, got those when they first hit. :)
Coach101   There is an APW 2.0 meandering its way through Apple but when it
           will be
Coach101   released would be anybody's guess...  I think there is a little
           more
Coach101   information in the development environment area here in ADV..  
           ga
Markus     thanks. I'm done. :)
AFA Gary J Ok, Thanks Markus (and Coach).  Let's move on to Gibber's
           question.
A GibberFC Does anyone know when the new sound tools will be available?  
A GibberFC I called APDA and they had info on them but no date :(
A GibberFC ga
AFA Gary J I have no idea, anyone else?
LordRoland Hmm. I thought they were coming with Sys. 6.0.
A GibberFC The person that had the answer ducked out..
A GibberFC :(
Pest II    If APDA doesn't know...does anyone?
AFA Gary J Release dates are hard to come by with ANY software.
Coach101   APDA (phone people) would probably not know until it was
           deliverable !
LordRoland Matt would've known.
AFA Gary J (Especially comeing from Apple)
A2GS       Dave????
Dave Lyons Sorry...don't know.
Dave Lyons (I'm sure APDA doesn't know, though.)
AFA Gary J Ok, Let's move on to LordRoland's question.  GA.
LordRoland OK.  I'm working on a term. program.  Everything is speeding along
           fine except
LordRoland for the text.  I was using the toolkit, but obviously it's too
           slow.  It seems
LordRoland that the best way to do it is to zap the char. directly into
           screen ram. 
LordRoland Does anyone have any recomendations as to the easiest way to go
           about doing
LordRoland this.  I don't relish typing in the individual bitmaps for the
           letters.
LordRoland GA
AFA Gary J GA, Pest
Pest II    Well, I thought that the zapping into RAM method was exactly the
           sort of thing
Pest II    that Apple want us to avoid...have you used the COUT routine?
Pest II    I don't know that it's any faster, but you probably wouldn't have
           to
AFA Gary J COUT?  On the graphics screen?
LordRoland No, I haven't.  It's graphics based. Desktop.  I need more speed. 
           I don't 
LordRoland really care about Apple Guidelines.  GA
Pest II    Ah, I see...thought you meant text text
LordRoland Sorry Apple :)
AFA Gary J GA, A2
A2GS       Seeing as how your somewhat of an "Apple Rebel" like myself :)
           .....
Coach101   Ga Dave
Dave Lyons If you're using QuickDraw, you'll get a *big* speed
A2GS       What exactly are you trying to avoid (besides the tools)?
Dave Lyons benefit from drawing a LINE at a time (with, say, DrawString)
Dave Lyons instead of a character at a time.
Dave Lyons As far as going by the "Apple guidelines" goes, if you can't get
           the job done with the
Dave Lyons toolbox, by all means do what you have to do.  Just realize that
           rules aren't there to give
Dave Lyons fascists something to do, but to maximize compatibility with
           future hardware and software,
Dave Lyons and with other present software (for ex, your
A2GS       <-- Facist???
LordRoland I hate buffering the text though, cause it just doesn't seem
           'natural'.
A2GS       What are you trying to do/avoid doing?
Dave Lyons app will work much better with a DA in front of your window if
           you're drawing with QD than if
Dave Lyons you're drawing right to the screen!).
LordRoland I just want the letters up fast.  I want the screen to keep up
           with the modem.
A2GS       Then use Apple's default font....
Dave Lyons In other words, Apple doesn't invent rules to *annoy* you, but
           to
Dave Lyons make life cool in the long run.
LordRoland Not fast enough. A2
Coach101   How fast is fast?
A2GS       store the bitmaps of the letters in a lookup table....
A2GS       (you didn't let me finish  :)
LordRoland Right on A2GS, but I don't want to type in the bitmaps.  I'd
           prefer to get
A2GS       Then use an x,y coordinate system to draw the characters at the
           correct
A2GS       place on the screen.
A2GS       So use Apple's defualt font!!
LordRoland the font in memory and then bypass QD in getting them up.
A2GS       Capture it from a SHR screen or something.
LordRoland Hmm.  I thought about that.  I guess that's my only option.
Mac Hater  is Quickdraw using shadowing?  that'll speed up.  also preshifted
           shaston is
Mac Hater  fast.
A2GS       It's the easiest (if you ask me)
AFA Gary J But as Dave points out, you loose system compatability by doing
           things that 
AFA Gary J way.
A2GS       Mac, using shadowing for such small objects would actually slow
           things down!!
LordRoland I think it was Matt who mentioned reading the actual Font Data.
LordRoland On the NET.
A2GS       Yes, but do you know where that is in ROM?
LordRoland Nope.
LordRoland Anyone?
A2GS       Well then your stuck doing it my way :)
LordRoland Educated guesses?
A2GS       You can search for it using the monitor....
Mac Hater  you can get the font handle and go from there...
LordRoland Stab in the dark?
LordRoland I'm on a Rom 02.  Is it even in ROM?
A2GS       First draw the font on the screen....look at the data from within
           the monitor
AFA Gary J The font in ROM? 
Dave Lyons Hey, you can *get* the font handle with GetFont.
A2GS       and then search for a string of data in ROM which is identicle.
Dave Lyons That's not a problem.
A2GS       Does that give the address of the FONT data in ROM?
Mac Hater  you're doing something wrong Lord Roland, TML Pascal has a example
           of a termina
Dave Lyons The *problem* is blasting it to the screen FASTER than QuickDraw
           already does--you'll have
Mac Hater  program that runs fine w/ tools.  AWGS runs fine.  
A2GS       Are there headers that he'll have to look out for within the Font
           table?
Dave Lyons to sacrifice some of the generality of QD to make it go
           faster--like lost some clipping, or force
Dave Lyons it to be aligned to a byte or word in a certain way, etc.
Dave Lyons The font data may be in RAM or ROM...it depends.
Dave Lyons (And it doesn't matter much.)
A2GS       Default Font will be in ROM.
LordRoland AWGS uses buffering.  I really don't want that.
LordRoland The only TML Pascal I've seen runs slow, slow, slow.
CMOSness   hi all
AFA Gary J Ok, It looks like we've run into a dead end on your question,
           LordRoland.
AFA Gary J Anything else?
Dave Lyons Which TML was slow?
Dave Lyons TML Pascal II uses Text Edit & updates pretty fast.  It does
           suffer from some bugs in Text Edit
Dave Lyons itself, but the speed isn't the problem.
LordRoland Sorry.  I was gone for a sec.  V 1.5, dave. 
Dave Lyons Yeah, definitely check out TML Pascal II 1.x.
Dave Lyons (done)
LordRoland OK. Thanks everyone.  I'm thru.  (DONE)
AFA Gary J Allright, let's move on to A2GS's question.  GA A2
A2GS       2 off the wall questions, one.....
A2GS       Anyone familiar with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and where
           I can get
A2GS       info on it?
A2GS       GA
LordRoland Not a clue.
AFA Gary J GA, Scott :)
AFL Scott  You can get information on OCR in several books I have that are
           packed up
AFL Scott  right now...(I'm moving)... I'll be glad to email you the
           information once
LordRoland Mac had it in 1987 :(
AFL Scott  I'm settled in my new home.
A2GS       Where'd you move to?
A2GS       (not my second Q :)
AFL Scott  Reston, VA.
AFL Scott  I haven't moved, yet...  Done.
AFA Gary J GA with your comment, CMOSness
BillP      Reston VA???    Who would live there???  :)
CMOSness   I was just going to say that
CMOSness   I remember a comp chronicals episode
CMOSness   about that, and maybe you could get info
CMOSness   thru them                    DONE.
A2GS       Great, I'm looking for info on how to write routines.
Mac Hater  you're moving with Scott also? 
AFA Gary J (I'd think that you'd want to be FURTHER away from there, Scott
           :)
A2GS       Second Q.....
A2GS       Anyone know if there are any advantages to using Huffman
           compression as opposed
A2GS       to LZW compression?
A2GS       GA
LordRoland Check with Abaton for the OCR.
A2GS       The scanner people?
LordRoland Yeah.  They had a mac char. reader in Feb. 1987.  I just happen to
           have the
LordRoland ad in front of me.
A2GS       So where's there II version???????????
A2GS       :)
A2GS       BTW Anyone able to answer my second Q?
LordRoland ?? Hack something together.
Mac Hater  huffman can be faster.  ga
AFA Gary J A2, as for compression routines, I know there are advantages and
           disadvantages
AFA Gary J to either method, but don't recall the specifics.
A2GS       Compressing or decompressing?
LordRoland Probably works through the serial port.  Then use a DA to accept
           the input.
Mac Hater  decompression.  lzw is faster if you search small series of bytes
           but then data
Mac Hater  is not always thoroughly compressed (repetetive graphics would
           be).
A2GS       Which is faster at decompressing?
LordRoland Probably costs alot, so maybe, you shouldn't HACK something
           together.
A2GS       What would cost alot?
AFA Gary J GA, CMOSness
LordRoland The OCR.
A2GS       Why?
A2GS       If it's software based.
LordRoland All Mac stuff is expensive.  Plus, it's high tech stuff.  Not
           really, but...
CMOSness   I was just wondering, A2, how does OCR fit into DL II (or does it
           :)
A2GS       It doesn't  :)   Just a pet project  :)
LordRoland It isn't software based, I don't think.
CMOSness   :)
AFA Gary J GA, DHackerott
DHackerott I'm also interested in OCR via ThunderScan
LordRoland No way, Hackerott.
DHackerott What input are you planning on?
LordRoland I really don't think it would work.
A2GS       I'm interested VIA Quicky, but could also be applied to
           Thunderscan!
AFA Gary J A2, why not put up something in the message boards.  GA, Scott
AFL Scott  Yes way... it's possible.  You just have to write routines that
           can match
AFL Scott  bit patterns...with some error factoring... it's not that hard,
           it's just
AFL Scott  time consuming... Basically for each font you need to recognize
           you need to
AFL Scott  have an equivalent bitpattern in memory to match each character. 
A2GS       Exactly!
LordRoland What is the resolution of Thuderscan.  100 dpi tops.
A2GS       There are a few hurdles which have to be overcome, it's not that
           easy.
AFL Scott  Done.
AFA Gary J Thanks, Scott.
A2GS       I wouldn't use that technique....
A2GS       NOT at all accurate.
AFL Scott  How would YOU do it, then?
A2GS       Unless you have a bitmap for every FONT in the world!
A2GS       Hold on....
AFA Gary J That's what character recognition currently has to do, isn't
           it?
AFL Scott  Yup. 
LordRoland Yeah.  You need algorithms that'll work with most fonts.
A2GS       I would use "Feature Analysis".
AFA Gary J GA, Marty
AFL Marty  It's not necessarily the case that you'd need a bitmap for every
           font
AFA Gary J (Most of the recognition stuff I'm familiar with works with a
           limited type of
AFL Marty  in the world...
AFA Gary J font and font size)
AFL Marty  All you really need is a bitmap that is "close enough" in some
           sense of
AFL Marty  the word.
AFA Gary J Right, there should be margin for error
A2GS       That doesn't offer very much flexibility.
AFL Marty  For example, we can recognize the letter "x" in a wide variety of
           fonts...
AFA Gary J GA, Bill
BillP      yea but...
BillP      won't we have outline fonts on the GS soon anyway.   :)
BillP      ga
AFL Marty  not because we have memorized the fonts, but because there are
           elements
AFL Marty  of the character that identify it as being an x.
AFL Marty  done
A2GS       It's easier seen and recognized by the human eye then by an
           algorithm!
AFL Marty  I never said it was easy.
AFA Gary J GA, Roland
LordRoland I heard that we don't have the clock speed for Outline fonts.
A2GS       That's where Feature Analysis comes in.
AFL Scott  Explain feature analysis?
AFA Gary J GA, Scott
A2GS       I've heard a lot of things which wren't true about the IIGS  !!!
A2GS       Most weren't true!
A2GS       Feature Analysis....
A2GS       Basically you define a character from the alphabet by the lines
           and curves
A2GS       which make it up...
A2GS       Ex. the letter "A" is made up of 2 diagonal lines plus one
           horizontal line.
LordRoland Does anyone know anyone called Harlock (AO name, of course)?
LordRoland Sorry to interrupt!
A2GS       The letter "D" is made up of one vertical line and one half
           loop.
A2GS       Done.
A GibberFC Unless it is block lettering... then it has 2 vertical and 2
           horizonal
A GibberFC ga
A2GS       Exactly.
AFA Gary J GA, Scott
AFL Scott  Exactly... I think we said that... Marty did, I know...  not in so
           many words..
AFA Gary J Right.
AFL Scott  however, you have to store the features somewhere... and vectors
           wouldn't
A2GS       I'm just trying to point out that using bitmaps is very
           inefficient.
LordRoland Bitmaps won't work.
LordRoland Well.
DHackerott Has anyone actually used QUICKIE yet? Does it really, really
           work?
AFL Scott  be a good choice, IMHO.  So how do you plan on defining the
           choices?
AFL Marty  I don't recall anyone arguing that they were efficient.
AFL Dyfet  (I had some nasty modem problems tonight :()
AFL Marty  Hi Dave!
AFA Gary J GA, Gibber
A2GS       I've used Quickie....
A GibberFC ack.... ga
A2GS       Defining what choices?
LordRoland My dealer has one.  I was pretty suprised.
AFL Scott  For the characters you plan on recognizing?  Vectors, angles...
           what?
AFA Gary J GA, Marty
LordRoland Hey, I gotta go.  Thanks everyone.
A2GS       Can't use angles (much to complicated and not very useful).....
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Roland.
AFL Marty  Couldn't you store the bitmap of a "generic" font?  Then compare
           the image of
A2GS       Plan to use vectors or something related to it....it's the
           algorithms that
AFL Marty  the scanned font to that of the stored one and if "most" of the
           points...
A2GS       are difficult to come up with...so I'm looking for some OCR books
           for
A2GS       some suggestions.
AFL Marty  are "close enough" to some character in the stored font, you have
           a match.
A2GS       Marty, What do you do when there's a wide range in FONT sizes?
A2GS       Feature Analysis solves this problem and is VERY flexible.
Coach101   I think you have all missed on of the basic starting
           problems....
Coach101   1) You have no idea what is horizontal and what is vertical. 
           But
AFL Marty  I dunno. I'm just tossing out ideas as they pop into my head.
Coach101   you probably know its not pure x or pure y!
A2GS       That's what the algorithms are for  :)
Coach101   Two, the old brain very quickly defined a line for you..   Your
           program
AFL Marty  If I were doing the project, I'd do it for one font size and 
AFL Marty  improve it from there.
Coach101   is going to have to figure out all of that stuff before even
           looking
Coach101   for a character!
A2GS       Why is that?
A2GS       One of the main algorithms (besides helping with character
           definitions) is to
A2GS       locate a character.
A2GS       All OCR programs follow the same general rules for locating and
           defining a
AFA Gary J GA, Scott
A2GS       character....
AFL Scott  Not necessary, Coach.. if an approximation map is "taught" to the
           software and
A2GS       I just want to know how they do it :)
Tamira     brb
AFL Scott  the software has an Orientation option, the main task of the
           scanning software
Mac Hater  y=mx+b   bye all :)
A2GS       My guess is that you have to scan the screen for a black pixel on
           a white
AFL Scott  would be to only filter those bits which are below a certain
           threshold.  After
A2GS       screen and from that determine the size and loaction of the
           character.
A2GS       Working from the black pixel on.
AFL Scott  that, the approximation map, or better yet, mask could be used to
           to tell
AFA Gary J Sounds like a slow process to me.
AFL Scott  what character is present... it's not fast... That's why most OCR
           equipment
AFL Scott  does this all on board and just feeds ascii text to a host.
AFL Scott  The key is the scanner... it's got to be accurate.
AFL Scott  Done.
A2GS       Nobody said it was fast or easy....but I don't think it's that
           slow...
Coach101   YEs, I have seen some very good results out of Kurtzweil
           equipment...
Coach101   But, the context is very important.  The stuff I have played
           around
A2GS       I think an entire page of text (1000 - 2000 characters) could be
           converted
Coach101   with on PCs did not have a strong enought concept of context and
           would
A2GS       into ASCII in under 10 seconds....
A2GS       and that's a hell of a lot faster then typeing in the entire
           page!
