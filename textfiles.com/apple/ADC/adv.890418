APPLE II DEVELOPMENT FORUM CONFERENCE LOG
April 18, 1989  10:00 p.m. eastern time
Topic:  Apple II Operating Systems
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar  (AFL Dyfet)

AFL Dyfet  Good evening and welcome to the tuesday night Apple
AFL Dyfet  Development Forum chat.  Tonight's topic is Operating
AFL Dyfet  Systems (there's the worm!).  We WILL be using PROTOCOL starting
AFL Dyfet  now.  This means that if you wish to ask a question, you
AFL Dyfet  must enter a '?' on a line by itself, and if you wish to comment
AFL Dyfet  on the question being asked, you must enter a '!' on
AFL Dyfet  a line by itself.  I will call you each in turn to speak.
AFL Dyfet  I believe the first question is technically from Gibber...could
	   you repeat
AFL Dyfet  it again?
DTS Folks  !
THE GIBBER What is an error 27 in GSOs.... I have had 3 weeks straight of
	   coming home to 
THE GIBBER my cozy 140 meg hard drive and it will not boot :(
THE GIBBER I have reinstalled the system 4 times..
AFA Gary J Q = GIBBER (DTS Folks)
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave and MAtt...
DTS Folks  $27 (hex) is I/O error - it means the hardware said it can't read
	   or write to the drive reliably.  GA.
Coach101   ?
THE GIBBER What do you suggest that I do.....??????
THE GIBBER ga
AFA Parik  !
AFL Dyfet  I would suggest a low level reformat myself...GA Parik...
DTS Folks  Many hard drives or other utilities (such as Glen Bredon's
	   MR.FIXIT) will go through a volume and...
AFA Parik  1) Check all connections to make sure they're seated correctly,
	   etc.  2) Run
AFA Parik  Mr Fixit and Bag Of Tricks through it, it most likely won't work. 
	   3) Low-level
DTS Folks  ...get rid of as many bad blocks as they can, marking them as used
	   so they don't cause problems.
AFA Parik  and then high-level format the drive, backing up all data
	   beforehand.  Fun! :)
AFA Parik  ga
DTS Folks  (this might help.  GA [sorry for the delay])
AFA Gary J Q = Gibber, Coach
AFL Dyfet  Okay.  I believe our next question is from coach...GA Coach.
Coach101   The Print manager has printer drivers and port drivers.  GSOS
	   has
Windrider5 ?
Coach101   device drivers.  What are the relationships between them
	   (especially
Coach101   between print manager port drivers and GSOS drivers) and isnt
	   this
Coach101   a little duplication?   GA
DTS Folks  !
AFA Gary J Q = Coach (DTS Folks), Windrider
AFL Dyfet  I knew one of you would go for this one!  Go ahead D & M :)
DTS Folks  It's only duplication if you think the system is more
	   interconnected than it really is.
DTS Folks  As explained in IIgs TN #35 and #36, Printer and Port drivers in
	   the Print Manager are used to...
DTS Folks  ...enable the PM to send generic commands and allow the drivers to
	   do the hardware specific stuff.
DTS Folks  For example, the Print Manager would tell a driver to print a
	   pixel map.  The ImageWriter driver would
DTS Folks  actually do the translating into printer codes.  It would then
	   call the Printer Port driver to send
DTS Folks  those codes out the Printer Port at the hardware level.
DTS Folks  A GS/OS driver is code that allows a piece of hardware to accept
	   and respond to GS/OS calls.
DTS Folks  A Print Manager port driver could, for example, call a GS/OS
	   Character Driver for a given port to
DTS Folks  do the dirty work; this is just fine.  But a GS/OS driver wouldn't
	   call a Print Manager driver.
DTS Folks  (Confusing still or makes more sense?  GA)
AFA Gary J Q = Coach (DTS Folks), Windrider
Coach101   Right....  My confusion was what looked like a duplication between
	   the
Coach101   port driver and GSOS driver.  I hate to see two entities tasked
	   with
Coach101   the same job (interface to the hardware).  Why couldn't the
	   print
Coach101   driver make a GSOS call to get to the appropriate _hardware_
	   driver.  Then
Coach101   once I installed a GSOS driver for a specific piece of hardware it
	   would
Coach101   (maybe, hopefully) be available to everyone.  GA
DTS Folks  !
AFL Dyfet  Oops...!  I got bumped!  GA Matt and Dave
DTS Folks  1) The Print Manager was designed first
AFA Gary J Q = Coach (DTS Folks), Windrider
DTS Folks  2) The port drivers fulfill functions not implemented by GS/OS,
	   such as...
JohnSchapp Why is it that GS/OS still, as yet, is not AppleShare
	   compatible?
JohnSchapp Yet Apple is developing a genlock card?
JohnSchapp Shouldn't they put emphasis where they need it?
AFA Gary J Q = Coach (DTS Folks), Windrider, JohnSchapp
DTS Folks  "Is it safe to print" and asynchronous reading and writing.  A
	   port driver could call a GS/OS driver
AFL Dyfet  We are in protocol, John.  Your question has been recorded, and
	   will be
AFL Dyfet  gotten to in turn...
JohnSchapp Like focusing on their new operating system?
DTS Folks  to do those things that a GS/OS driver can do better (reading,
	   writing, etc. synchronously), but
DTS Folks  there are still hardware-depending printing-dependent functions
	   the port driver will
DTS Folks  have to fulfill that the GS/OS drivers don't include.  GA.
Coach101   OK....    Thanks for the information....  I was looking at print
Coach101   spooling and the extra level of drivers, means extra levels of
Coach101   _spooling_ drivers.   Thanks for the time...   GA
AFL Dyfet  Any more comments on this question?
AFL Dyfet  Okay, that did clear up some confusion in my mind as well...I
	   believe the
AFL Dyfet  next question is from Windrider...GA Windrider.
Windrider5 Could someone explain high level and low level formats
	   (initializations)? GA
Jump Long  !
AFA Gary J Q = Windrider (Jump Long), JohnSchapp
AFL Dyfet  Go Ahead, Jim.
Jump Long  A low level format writes the actual tracks and sectors on a disk.
	   A high level
Jump Long  format writes the volume structure (directories, bit-maps, etc.)
	   on the
Jump Long  disk. ga
Windrider5 how is this preformed?
Jump Long  Which one?
Windrider5 both 
AFL Dyfet  The GS/OS format (and most other formatters) do both for floppy
	   drives at the
AFL Dyfet  same time.  Harddisks are normally only high level formatted.  The
	   high level
AFL Dyfet  format simply writes out the volume directory and bitmap through
	   standard
AFL Dyfet  block write calls.  Low level formats are very hardware specific
	   and require
AFA Gary J Q = Windrider (Dyfet), JohnSchapp
AFL Dyfet  utilities seperate from what is supplied with ProDOS.  Anyone else
	   wish to
AFL Dyfet  comment here?
JonL7      WHAT IS INTERLEAVE FACTOR ON A HARDDRIVE
AFL Dyfet  Interleave has to do with how the blocks are numbered on a
	   cylinder on the
AFL Dyfet  disk.  Normally two consequtive blocks are not put next to each
	   other, but
AFL Dyfet  instead are placed a few blocks apart with intervening blocks
	   numbered
AFL Dyfet  differently so that the disk driver has enough time to process the
	   current
AFL Dyfet  block it is reading before it encounters the next one.  If they
	   were right
AFA Gary J Q = Windrider (Dyfet), JohnSchapp
AFL Dyfet  next to each other, the drive would have to complete a whole
	   rotation before
AFL Dyfet  it was ready to read the next block in a sequential read...
AFL Dyfet  (my CP/M heritage shows there a little :)...did that help?
AFA Gary J !
AFL Dyfet  GA Gary.
AFA Gary J I just wanted to add that interleave is not just used on hard
	   drives, but on
AFA Gary J almose all forms of disk drives.  The speed increase that can
	   come from the
Coach101   !
JonL7      Yes so chosing the right number could speed the disk read process
	   considerably
AFA Gary J proper interleave setting has recently been illustrated on the
	   3.5 drive and
AFA Gary J GS/OS's 2:1 interleave. 
AFA Gary J GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach.
AFA Gary J Yes
JonL7      Thanks :)
Coach101   The premiere issue of APDALog (from Apple) contains an excellent
Coach101   write up on the theory behind interleaving complete with some 
Coach101   concrete examples of the benefits that can be derived from it.  If
	   you
DTS Folks  (complete with some diagrams bearing numbers that aren't exactly
	   related to the text...)
Coach101   do not have a firm handle on interleaving I suggest you read
	   Matt's
AFA Gary J Q = Windrider (Coach), JohnSchapp
Coach101   dissertation in APDALog.   GA
DTS Folks  (I can say that because I wrote the article, and it's MUCH easier
	   to blame it on APDA.  GA)
JonL7      Ok
AFL Dyfet  Okay, thank you coach...Any other comments?
AFL Dyfet  I believe our next question is from John Shapp.  GA John.
AFA Gary J Q = JohnSchapp
JohnSchapp How come GS/OS still does not work with AppleShare
DTS Folks  !
JohnSchapp yet Apple is working on developing a genlock card and not
	   concentrating
JohnSchapp their efforts.
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt and Dave...
JohnSchapp GS/OS is almost a year old now.
JohnSchapp well not really, but it's not new.
DTS Folks  If one takes the rather simplistic approach that Apple is only
	   capable of working on one project at
DTS Folks  a time, you should expect the next System Disk update sometime
	   around 1998.
JohnSchapp About the same time a new Apple II is introduced?
DTS Folks  Reality shows that Apple works on multiple projects at a given
	   time.  While I can't comment on...
JohnSchapp While five Mac's buzz by.
AFA Gary J Q = JohnSchapp (DTS Folks)
DTS Folks  specific things like when AppleShare compatibility will come to
	   GS/OS, I can say that it's very
DTS Folks  important to us to do that.  GA.
JohnSchapp What about new improvements to GS/OS, like more FSTS?
DTS Folks  Same story.  GA.
JohnSchapp The Apple 3.5 drive can read Mac disks, why is there no FST out
	   already for it?
Jump Long  You know we can't comment on unreleased products... (I had to say
	   that)
DTS Folks  (I already did)_
JohnSchapp Yes, but how long does it take to make an unreleased product?
JohnSchapp We know that GS/OS took two years.
AFL Dyfet  Quite a long time for something as complex as an os...:)
DTS Folks  The kinds of engineering efforts into good system software
	   revisions are not trivial.
AFL SandyB LOL John, that's a leading question...
Jump Long  (but I've never had the chance, Matt)
Jump Long  :)
AFA Gary J Q = JohnSchapp 
DTS Folks  GS/OS didn't come out until two years after the IIgs, but the IIgs
	   was introduced with ProDOS 16.
AFL TimB   !
AFL Dyfet  GA Tim.
AFL TimB   I thought you'd all be interested to hear of a 'new' operating
	   system that...
AFL TimB   came on a program that I just received from Electronic Arts....
	   ;)
JohnSchapp !
AFA Gary J Q = JohnSchapp (Tim)
AFL TimB   Apple DOS 4.0!!! :)  On Instant Synthesizer! 
AFL TracyP !
AFL Dyfet  Hmm...GA John...
AFL TimB   Maybe someone should tell them! 
JohnSchapp As a matter of fact AppleLink is shipped with System Disk 3.2 in
	   order to
DaviesDoug !
JohnSchapp remain AppleShare compatible.
Coach101   !
AFA Gary J Q = John (Tracy, Doug, Coach)
AFL Dyfet  Okay.  GA Tracy.
DaviesDoug Electronics Arts are too big of babies to program in gsos/p16,
	   they use p8....
DaviesDoug all the time
AFL TracyP John, I think what the DTS folks are trying to say is that 
DaviesDoug .
AFL TracyP yes, they are aware of some of the things that need to be done
AFL TracyP in the area of AppleShare awareness, FSTs, etc.
JohnSchapp !
AFL TracyP The problem is they can't say what things they're working on,
AFL TracyP what stage of development they're in, or even =if= any given
AFL TracyP product is in development or not!  <ga>
JohnSchapp I was aware of that but I was a little mad about how the Mac has
	   priority at
AFL Dyfet  I'm sure they are hard at work on it...GA Doug...
JohnSchapp DTS
Jump Long  But we can answer questions on current products :)
DaviesDoug I did
DTS Folks  The Mac doesn't have priority in Apple II DTS.  This I can
	   guarantee you.
AFA Gary J Q = John (Coach)
AFA Gary J :)
JohnSchapp Well it sure did have the spotlight in the latest issue of
	   AppleDirect.
AFL Dyfet  Oh yes :)...*crack* don't let a protocol slip happen again :)  GA
	   Coach...
Coach101   With regard to AppleLink and system disk 3.2 and AppleShare.....
Coach101   I would not suggest having AppleTalk turned on when you are
AFA Parik  !
Coach101   using AppleLink....  If anyone does anything on AppleTalk.....
DTS Folks  So complain to the AppleDirect folks.  They're NOT DTS, and they
	   are interested in your comments.
Coach101   You Die....  And, Quantum says...    oh, so sorry.... and
Coach101   Apple says....  AppleLink is more Quantum than Apple.... 
	   and....
Coach101   you are stuck....   ga
AFA Parik  AppleLink is shipping with Sys Disk v3.2 because GS/OS + AppleLink
	   eats up more
AFA Parik  than 512k.  ga
AFL Dyfet  I believe John has the next comment...GA John...
AFA Gary J Q = John
JohnSchapp Well I can't really remember except, what real purpose is there
	   in
AFL Dyfet  Q = John, Parik
JohnSchapp spending engineering effort on a genlock card that is going to be
	   used
DaviesDoug ?
JohnSchapp not too often in practical applications?
Jump Long  !
JohnSchapp Go.
AFL Dyfet  GA Jim...
AFA Gary J Q = John (Jim), Doug
Jump Long  It depends what you classify as practical. Many Educators have
 	   been asking for
AFL TimB   !!!
Jump Long  this kind of capability for a long time. There are a lot of fun
	   things you 
JohnSchapp Yes but many educators have also asked for a card to make the
	   Apple II a
Jump Long  could go with it a home, too.
Jump Long  ga
JohnSchapp file-server. I work at a school as the Computer Teacher, I know.
Jump Long  go = do
AFL Dyfet  I don't think anyone here can even guess at, let alone speak for
	   Apple's
AFA Gary J Q = John (Tim), Doug
AFL Dyfet  decision making process in regards to what is planned and why.  I
	   believe the
AFL Dyfet  next comment is from Tim.
AFL TimB   Personally, I've been very impressed with Apple's intro of the
	   VOC.  It's an...
AFL TimB   innovative and innovatively priced piece of hardware.  I too hope
	   (and I think
AFL TimB   I know) it's not the end of Apple's committment to the A2, but it
	   certainly...
JohnSchapp It's nice, but there are too many other things that should have
	   been made in
AFL TimB   shows a measure of intent.  And what a shot in the arm for the
	   //e!!!!!!!
AFL TimB   (done)
JohnSchapp the first place.
Coach101   !
AFL Dyfet  I believe the next question is from Doug.  GA Doug.
DaviesDoug How come when I'm tracing through the GS tools I see a lot of
	   this......
Coach101   Cancel !
DaviesDoug LDY #0, LDA [$69],Y ...... instead of LDA [$69]....and......
AFA Gary J Q = Doug
AFA Parik  !
DaviesDoug pea 0 pea 0, instead of LDA #0 pha pha
DaviesDoug could save some room......of that....
DaviesDoug 512k parik talked about.
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (Parik)
AFL Dyfet  I guess because Dave just started working over there
	   :)...seriously, GA Parik.
AFA Parik  time.  not 'nuff off it.  :)  dunno about tools, but many books I
	   learned 
AFA Parik  programming from did do it these slow ways, and I guess people
	   never think
AFA Parik  about it too much, converting it into a macro instead.
AFA Parik  ga
DTS Folks  !
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt and Dave...
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (DTS Folks)
DTS Folks  I can't say I've seen a LOT of that sort of thing,
DaviesDoug Just seems to me a lot of stuff isnt done as efficiently as it
	   could be....
DTS Folks  but there is no doubt some of it.  Email me the particulars and
	   I'll see if there is anything I
JohnSchapp !
DaviesDoug i look for all optimization points..
DTS Folks  can do.  (This is Dave, BTW.  Email it to Dave Lyons here.)  ga
DaviesDoug I also see things like pulling something off the stack and
	   immediately pushing
DaviesDoug it back on
KerrySpind Who knows
JohnSchapp !
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (John)
AFL Dyfet  GA John...
AFA Parik  its so people like you dig through code
AE PhilM   !
JohnSchapp The most obvious answer is the following code: LDY #0
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (John, Phil)
JohnSchapp LDA ($69),Y
JohnSchapp INY
JohnSchapp INY
AFA Gary J Right
AFA Gary J !
JohnSchapp BNE LDA ($69),Y
DaviesDoug yah, but that was not the case
AFA Parik  (handle -> pointer?)
JohnSchapp You cannot search for branches, there may be many different entry
	   points
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (Phil)
Coach101   If you had a cache accelerator, keeping all the references
JohnSchapp like BRL.., and many others.
Coach101   in the procedure bank could be beneficial
AE PhilM   !
JohnSchapp I mean branch calls not entry points
AFL Dyfet  Okay.  I believe the next comment was from AE Phil.  GA Phil.
DaviesDoug PEA 0 PEA 0    ->   LDA #0 PHA PHA is done alot, could save one
	   byte
DaviesDoug and some cycles
AE PhilM   Just a comment about efficient code...
DaviesDoug for tool calls, so no entry points, i doubt
AE PhilM   Tis better to write 500 lines of good code per day than 20 lines
	   of great code
AE PhilM   Most of the time critical stuff is limited to a small percentage
	   of the
DaviesDoug yah, but the tools have been out for a long time, hire someone to
	   clean it...
DaviesDoug up
AE PhilM   program anyway.  Unless of cource memory is important
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (Phil, Gary)
DaviesDoug memory is important
AE PhilM   Thats a lot of code
AE PhilM   And it's always changing
DaviesDoug so do a search for pea 0 pea 0
AFL Dyfet  I would like to comment that optimizing tools is a double edged
	   sword...for
AFL Dyfet  example, since the window/dialog managers occasionally call
	   quickdraw/screen
DaviesDoug I just sped up a display routine I'm working on for the current
	   WordPerfect....
AFL Dyfet  drawing routines directly instead of through standard tool calls
	   (and some
DaviesDoug project by 50 times by looking for optimizations
AFL Dyfet  tools in some situations even do direct screen writes), it is not
	   possible to
DTS Folks  !
AFL Dyfet  stick neat things in like a graphics co-processor by simply
	   trapping the
AFL Dyfet  quickdraw tool interface.  GA Matt.  And please, let's have a
	   little protocol
AFL Dyfet  here!  *CRACK*
DTS Folks  (This is Dave L)  Dave S, optimization is a completely separate
	   issue
DaviesDoug I have the question, can't I talk when I want, or do I have to
	   keep doing !'s
DTS Folks  from breaking things.  Optimizing means making a piece of code do
	   the same thing faster.  If other
AFA Gary J Q = Doug (Dave Lyons)
DTS Folks  pieces of code are assuming non-guaranteed things, that is very
	   bad.
DTS Folks  ga
AFL Dyfet  I meant in terms of people breaking in while you were talking,
	   Doug :)...
DaviesDoug :)
DaviesDoug ok, sorry, I'm ripping....
DaviesDoug on code here, just thought people might like to stir up some
	   conversation...
DaviesDoug on optimization :)
AFL Dyfet  I guess we sorta lost the original point in there, DL,
	   sorry...Um...if you
AFA Gary J !
AFL Dyfet  would like to add anything else, Doug, go ahead...
DTS Folks  {S Boing}
DaviesDoug . no done .
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Gary, GA.
AFA Gary J In defense of the PEA 0 PEA 0 code, it is possible that they may
	   have wanted
AFA Gary J preserve the accumulator... GA
JohnSchapp !
AFL Dyfet  A sliver by itself is not conclusive...true :).  GA John.
JohnSchapp Not important.
AFL Dyfet  Okay...do we have any more questions tonight?
DaviesDoug through a tool call?
AFA Parik  who likes escargo?
AFA Gary J (It doesn't have to come out that way, Doug  :)
