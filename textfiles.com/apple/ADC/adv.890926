APPLE II DEVELOPMENT FORUM CONFERENCE LOG
September 26, 1989  10:00 pm Eastern Time
Topic:  Open Discussion
Forum Leader:  Gary Jacobson (AFA Gary J)


AFA Gary J Welcome to the Apple II Development Forum.  I'm Gary Jacobson
           (sitting in for
AFA Gary J Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet), who is getting settled from a move this
           evening.
AFA Gary J Tonight our topic is an open discussion, so we can talk about
           anything you'd
AFA Gary J like (AppleFest, or whatever).  We'll be using forum protocol to
           maintain
AFA Gary J some sane-ness here, so if you have a question, type a "?" on a
           line by 
AFA Gary J itself, or if you have a comment on the current topic, type a "!"
           on a line
AFA Gary J by itself.
AFA Gary J Does anyone have any questions or comments they'd like to start
           off with
AFA Gary J this evening?
BradleyL1  Can anyone tell me what problems there were in System Software
           5.0 that are fixed in 5.01?
AFA Parik  BASIC.SYSTEM : the infamous bload problem.  GS.OS :
           init manager
AFA Parik  sometimes unable to sense which screen is up for displaying/format
           erase dialog
AFA Parik  Pro.FTS: getdirentry returns wrong buf size errors, and it goes
           on.  i'll
AFA Parik  post it in operating system in LETS DISCUSS.  Q: BradleyL1  :)
AFA Gary J GA, Dave
Dave Lyons There is officially no such thing as 5.0.1--the official releases
           go right
Dave Lyons from 5.0 to 5.0.2.  In addition to what Parik mentioned and/or is
           going to
Dave Lyons post, 5.0.2 fixes problem where, if you're very unlucky and
           running low
Dave Lyons on available memory, you can get a fatal error during a memory
           manager
AFA Gary J Q = BradleyL1 (Dave, Gibber)
Dave Lyons operation (while GS/OS tries to get rid of the cache (5.0 doesn't
           mess up
Dave Lyons your disk, but you don't get a chance to save your files, either).
            Also,
Dave Lyons 5.0.2 has Standard File sorting in a more reasonable order
           (ignoring case),
Dave Lyons and the NoteAlert, CautionAlert, and StopAlert calls were fixed so
           that they
Dave Lyons never mess up memory they don't own (another
           if-you-get-very-unlucky sort of
Dave Lyons bug), and [finally] the GetNumNDAs, AddToRunQueue, and
           RemoveFromRunQueue
Dave Lyons calls were fixed to work properly on ROM 1 (on 5.0 they prevent
           NDAs from
Dave Lyons receiving keystrokes, until you reboot).  done
AFA Gary J GA, Gibber
A GibberFC Thanks both Dave and Parik.... just haven't been able to get the
           info I have 
AFA Gary J Q = BradleyL1 (Gibber)
A GibberFC needed for a while....... Your info will HELP and hopefully my
           Application for
A GibberFC "Partner" with Apple will go through so I have the info at
           hand.... thanks GA
AFA Gary J Ok, any other questions or comments?
AFA Gary J GA, SkySinger
SkySinger  I've heard some mention by Apple software engineers that they are
           toying around
BradleyL1  Were there any fixes to the text editor toolbox, Resource
           Manager?
SkySinger  with new music and animations tools. Anyone know anything about
           them?
AFA Gary J GA, Dave
Dave Lyons I don't know for sure, but the stuff I've heard
Dave Lyons was that there may be versions of some of that stuff available
           from APDA
Dave Lyons -eventually- (not now).  ga
AFA Gary J GA, Parik
AFA Parik  The new music tools will be available early next year.  They ROCK.
           Its very
AFA Parik  simple to use, you just sequence your sounds with a keyboard using
           a program
AFA Parik  that will be included, save the file, and then pass the file info
           and it'll
AFA Parik  play your song!  Its very powerful, and will blow the amiga, st in
           the music
AFA Parik  department.  ga
A GibberFC (now we need speed) ;)
AFA Gary J GA, Doc
Doctor Why Also, they demoed a 5-8 minute song(s) with 15 instrumnents
Doctor Why And it only took 60k on disk. GA
AFA Gary J Anything else, Sky?
SkySinger  Uh... give me a few minutes.
AFA Gary J Looks like Bradley's not here anymore, GA with your question,
           RTAFT:
RTAFT      Can anyone add any details to the Video Toolkit mentioned in PR on
           A'Link?
AFA Gary J GA, Dave
Dave Lyons I'm not sure I understand the question:  is it about the VideoMix
           Toolst
Dave Lyons for the GS, for use with the Video Overlay card?
RTAFT      That's the one!
Dave Lyons Ok...what about it?
RTAFT      When will it be ready for shipping?
Dave Lyons It -is- shipping...it's toolset 33, and it comes on the
           System.Tools disk
Dave Lyons with System Software 5.0[.2].  As I understand it, APDA has been
           shipping
Dave Lyons developer notes for it for at least a couple months now, but I
           haven't
Dave Lyons actually checked the catalog for it.
Dave Lyons (GA)
AFA Gary J Anything else, RTAFT?
RTAFT      VidClip IIgs Developer's Toolkit is the one, are they the same?
Dave Lyons Nope--VidClip is a 3rd-party product,
Dave Lyons which was demo'd at the Fest.  I don't know when that ships.
RTAFT      OK, Thanks! GA
Dave Lyons (done)
AFA Gary J Ok Mark, You're next. GA
MarkHulme1 I was wondering what ever happened with Apple Music Label company
           suing
MarkHulme1 Apple.
MarkHulme1 With all this music capabilities coming out, how they get around
           that?
AFA Gary J I haven't heard anything on that for a while.  Anyone else?
Coach101   I am not sure if it is related, but
AFA Gary J (I used to read about that on NewsBytes...now it's here
           on-line)
Coach101   the intro to the music tools in volume III contains what I
           interpreted
Coach101   as a legal disclaimer about the II-gs not being a musical
           instrument..  ga
MarkHulme1 :D
MarkHulme1 Sounds like a way to get around it. GA
AFA Gary J ..just an electronic gadget  :)
AFA Gary J GA, Gibber
A GibberFC I heard that part of a Secret Agreement that Ringo Starr is going
           to become
A GibberFC The CEO of Apple..... but that is just rumor ;)
AFA Gary J heheh
Coach101   :)
AFA Gary J Maybe he'll pay more attention to the II line.
AFA Gary J (Apple IIGS, the White edition)
AFA Gary J Ok, Coach... you had the next question  GA
Coach101   Did I miss something earlier....   Is there officially something
           beyond
Coach101   5.0 at this point?  ga
AFA Gary J GA, Dave
A GibberFC afk
Dave Lyons Yes--we were telling people about its existence at AFest, but it
           isn't
Dave Lyons quite available yet.  ga
Coach101   Thanks.....  ga
AFA Gary J Sometime this winter, right?  :)
Doctor Why cancel my ?
Dave Lyons No, sometime SOON.
AFA Gary J :)
AFA Gary J Great!
Coach101   Next spring for availability from APDA.   :)
AFA Gary J Ok, next question is from SkySinger again.  GA
SkySinger  Parik, about those new music tools... do you know if it handles
           the keyboard
SkySinger  input as midi data? The implication would be that you could play
           any pre-
SkySinger  corded standard midi file thru the GS chip with the tools.
AFA Gary J (Parik's not here...:)
SkySinger  Anybody else?
AFA Gary J It sounded that way from his description.  GA, Gibber
A GibberFC That would put it *TO* close to a musical instrument..... 
A GibberFC That would really get the beatles going.... hehe
SkySinger  No, its more like a record player.
AFA Gary J GA, Doc
Doctor Why I missed part of the demo, but I believe that it takes MIDI input,
           also
Doctor Why they said that there will be an instrument editor available fro
           APDA soon.
AFA Gary J Anything els, Sky?
Doctor Why that's soon and not SOON.  :) GA
SkySinger  Thanks. If it arrives it could make it much easier to put great
           music into 
SkySinger  application. GA
AFA Gary J Parik just FN'ed me and said that it did take MIDI input...like a
           sound
AFA Gary J studio.
AFA Gary J OK, next question is from A2GS.  GA
A2GS       Oh, so soon (startled)...
II GS1     What new products are coming out for the GS and where is it going.
           (gs)
II GS1     *blush*
A2GS       I ported some files over from the Amiga (ugh) to the GS and I
           didn't realize
AFA Gary J Hold on a second, II GS1  :)  You're after Coach
II GS1     oh sorry
A2GS       but the program on the Amiga was sending files via Xmodem CRC and
           I was
A2GS       receiving them Xmodem Standard...the files were sent Via a Null
           modem cable...
A2GS       they seem to have come across fine......Did they????
AFA Gary J GA, Dave
Dave Lyons Yes.  ga
Dave Lyons :)
A2GS       Thanx  :)  DAve
AFA Gary J Coach, it looks like you're up next.  GA
Coach101   Skip me...
AFA Gary J Ok... can you ask your question again, II GS1?
AFA Gary J GA
II GS1     What is the fate of the Apple IIGS? I have heard many rumors. Why
           arent there m
II GS1     more programs for it?
AFA Gary J GA, A2GS
II GS1     yes?
A2GS       I don't work for Apple so I can't say for sure and even if I did I
           couldn't say
A2GS       But,
A2GS       that question was asked to Jean Louis Gassee at the opening
           Keynote on friday
A2GS       at the FEST and he basically side stepped the question on whether
           Apple planned
A2GS       to drop the II by 1992, by just saying that a lot of Apple
           Engineers would be
A2GS       unhappy, which to me was clearly not an answer, I have a tape of
           the Keynote
A2GS       which I just listed to (again) this afternoon and I'm very angry
           (personally)
A2GS       with that FLIMSY answer!
AFA Gary J Transcribe it and upload it  :)  I'd like to see some of his
           EXACT words :)
A2GS       GA
AFA Gary J GA, Dave
Dave Lyons I like the question better when you asked "Where is the GS going?"
            *My* GS is
Dave Lyons staying right here in front of my face for a very long time.  I
           -do- work for
Dave Lyons Apple, so I can't talk about future plans--especially not the ones
           I know
Dave Lyons something about.  Third party plans I can't talk about because I
           don't knw
Dave Lyons anything about them--if there are products you want to buy, write
           letters to
Dave Lyons developers & let them know.  I don't think the GS software
           situation is
Dave Lyons -terribly- bad, but I do think it would be better if -more- people
           paid for
Dave Lyons the software they use.  It's very discouraging to spend a lot of
           time and
Dave Lyons money developing software & not have it sell very well--and it
           definitely
Dave Lyons takes more effort to write a -good- piece of GS software than it
           does to
Dave Lyons write a text-based app for the Apple II, for example.  ga
AFA Gary J GA, Gibber
A GibberFC Frankly...When I get the parts...My //gs will be going about 12 to
           15mhz....
II GS1     hows that?
A2GS       Huh?
A GibberFC I am working on some projects that I hope will enhance the //gs
           experience
A GibberFC but I really get angered by the amount of "Leaked" info about all
           the new 
II GS1     Well thank you for the thourough answers. :-)
A GibberFC Mac stuff that is being developed and we aren't even let in on 
A GibberFC info to make clear a _promise_ that was given to us at Applefest a
           scant 12
A GibberFC months ago...  
A GibberFC I can't work on //gs stuff all day long...I sort of have to
           support a wife and
A GibberFC family.... so I have to take my time..... Keep looking up.. the //
           isn't dead
A GibberFC yet
A GibberFC ga
AFA Gary J GA, SkySinger (even though II GS1 left :)
SkySinger  At AFest in Boston Steve Glass (I think that's his name) of Apple
           told me that
SkySinger  the GS is selling better than any individual model of the Mac.
           Thats the kind
SkySinger  of thing that would keep Apple interested in keeping the GS line
           going. Its
SkySinger  really a great machine. GA.
AFA Gary J GA, A2GS
A2GS       Getting back to what Dave said about buying software...keep in
           mind Piracy
A2GS       killed the 8-bit Atari and it seems to be doing it again for the
           ST the only
A2GS       thing currently keeping it alive is it's MIDI support and one
           other thing...
A2GS       as far as the GS goes (speed wise) for those who were not at the
           FEST...
A2GS       Bill Mensch put Gassee on the spot when he came up to a microphone
           and held
A2GS       up 3 12 Mhz 65816 and said that they were ready for immediate
           shipping (I got 
A2GS       a 9 Mhz one from him later (now if I only had a TWGS))
A2GS       I'd like to see Apple's excuse for not having a faster GS now!
A2GS       GA
Dave Lyons Neat!  Hey, with 3 of those chips, we could ship 3 fast machines,
           eh? :-)
Dave Lyons (ga)
AFA Gary J :)
AFA Gary J GA, Coach
Coach101   Where is the //gs going....   It is going where Apple wants it to
           go....
A2GS       :)  (I'll take one now!)
Coach101   My reading of Apple's tea leaves, is that Apple is targeting the
Coach101   usage area (lets get Johnny the same machine for home that he
           has
Coach101   at school).  I do NOT think you are going to find many //gs's in
Coach101   the small business area.  The //'s day in business use is past.. 
           Smal
Coach101   business is the province of the Mac/IBM war (and I think the Mac
           is a
Coach101   better proposition for a small business than a //gs).  I do think
           that
Coach101   CLARIS in particular has blinders on in not seeing the usage of
Coach101   their //gs products in the home.  I would really like to see
           Claris
Coach101   at future Afest's.    Now....  Mensch vs. Gassee.....
A2GS       10 rounds
Coach101   The 65816 I pulled out of my machine when I installed my TransWarp
           was
Coach101   not made by WDC (General Instrument, I think).  Apple's volume and
           business
Coach101   stature are such that I doubt they would design/announce/ship a
           product
Coach101   that they did not have second sources for all the parts.  The loss
           of
Coach101   face (which would effect ALL sales of APPLE products) would be
           devastating
Coach101   and must be avoided.  I doubt you could buy 50,000 65816s @ 12mhz
           from
Coach101   WDC..     Mensch has to realize the situation and so (personal
           opinion
Coach101   following), Mensch took a cheap shot (unsportmanlike conduct) at
           Gassee
Coach101   done....    ga
AFA Gary J GA, Dwight
DwightW1   from one of the apple magazines, it would appear that the //gs is
           destined to
DwightW1   become the low end Mac.....    ga
AFA Gary J GA, Gibber
A GibberFC Look it takes more than just plugging in a faster chip in a //gs
           to make it go
A GibberFC faster..... It would take a whole mother-board redesign.... Now...
A GibberFC 3 years that the //gs has been shipping, we have seen the Mac go
           from 8 to
A GibberFC 25mzh.... But please don't tell me in those 3 years that there
           hasn't been a 
A GibberFC faster 65816 developed...
A GibberFC That has been Apple's excuse ever since the speed short comming
           has been in the
A GibberFC limelight.  
A GibberFC Now as for Claris....
A GibberFC I taked to Claris Tech Support..... They are telling people to use
           system 4.0
A GibberFC to use Appleworks GS.... I asked if they were going to fix it to
           work under 5.0
A GibberFC I was told it wasn't broken......  I told them to pull their heads
           out of their
A GibberFC ***** that system 5.0 was the best piece of software EVER to ship
           for the //gs
A GibberFC and if they wanted to see the sales of Appleworks GS continue...
           they should
A GibberFC work the problems out.... compare this to Beagle Brothers who just
           Acquired
A GibberFC Multiscribe GS and Multiscribe...
A GibberFC Multiscribe GS has been recompiled to work under 5.0 and
           expressloads....
A GibberFC This is the difference in the two companies.... Beagle cares for
           the // and the
A GibberFC IIgs and Claris wants to use Appleworks and Appleworks GS as an
           "Investment"
A GibberFC If AWGS had been a Macintosh program and a new piece of System
           software
A GibberFC shipped and the product was Incompatible with it...Claris WOULD
           have a fix for 
A GibberFC it in less than 2 months....... Instead of "We are looking into a
           possibility 
A GibberFC of making it work with system 5.0"
A GibberFC ga
AFA Gary J GA, Doctor
Doctor Why I wasn't there, but what I heard was that Mensch said that he
           could supply them
A2GS       Have some Oxygen Gibber  :)
AFA Gary J :)
Doctor Why in quantity, right now. He implied that Apple has known this for a
           while and
Doctor Why has not even contacted him. GA
A2GS       Unfortunately Coach, I don't think you have all the facts.  First
           the GS could
A2GS       WHIP a standard IBM PC in many if not most applications, what's
           hurting the GS
A2GS       in the small business market is not the GS itself, but rather
           Apple's marketing
A2GS       and in fact a committee of dedicated Apple "People" was setup at
           the Kansas
A2GS       City conf. at had met with Apple this past Saturday to discuss
           among other
A2GS       things the Apple ]['s image problem.  Second...as far as shipping
           the 65816
A2GS       Doctor Why bascially summed up most of what I was going to
           say...But I would
A2GS       like to add...where do you think General Instruments got the Mask
           to make the
A2GS       65816 in your GS?  From WDC and no place else...WDC does not
           actually
A2GS       manufacture the 816 they design it and then give to another
           company to make for
A2GS       them.  Mensch isn't going to first make 50,000 816's and then
           speak to Apple
A2GS       first he's going to get a contract for them and then he'll put in
           an order for
A2GS       faster 816's in large quantity's.  This is Business NOT sports,
           right now he
A2GS       has finished products of a faster 816 to prove that right now they
           ARE reliable
A2GS       and I even have test results of the 9 mhz chip I got, he had the
           same reliable
A2GS       results for his 12 Mhz chips also, he spoke up at the show because
           he wasn't
A2GS       getting anywhere with Apple until now!  GA
AFA Gary J Ok, Coach...looks like you have the last word on this one  :)
A2GS       :)
Coach101   I understand all of your points A2GS, but I still hold to my
           opinion...
Coach101   On the Claris point, I have AWGS and so have had occasion to
           visit
A2GS       I have NO arguement there!
Coach101   the appropriate folders here on ****.  Sir AWGS (Tom Hoke) is
           active
Coach101   and posted a note to the effect that the Claris position is that
Coach101   AWGS is certified under 4.0 and not under 5.0.  From Tom's
           presence,
Coach101   concern, etc, I feel a new release of AWGS will be here in the
           not
Coach101   too distant future.   By the way, Tom is very helpful with any
           problems
Coach101   you may run into.....   ga
AFA Gary J GA, Dave
Dave Lyons (Pardon me for being brief:  note that AWGS 1.0v2 does ship in
Dave Lyons ExpressLoad format.  I -thought- there were some users reporting
           it worked
Dave Lyons fine for them under 5.0; maybe they were lucky.  I don't use it
           regularly
Dave Lyons myself.)  ga
Coach101   It works pretty well for me....    The problems I have I feel
Coach101   are probably associated with AWGS irrespective of 4.0/5.0....
Coach101   ga
AFA Gary J Ok... Just a side note on the direction of the IIGS... I actually
           went to a
AFA Gary J Macintosh show held here in Phoenix over the weekend, and was
           surprised to see
AFA Gary J 12 to 14 IIGS's in the exhibit hall.  Hyper Studio was being
           demo'ed by one
AFA Gary J company.
AFA Gary J Next question is from Dwight.  GA
DwightW1   does any computer company other than Apple support two computers
           with 
DwightW1   incompatible microprocessors?
DwightW1   .......ga
A2GS       I'll answer Dwight in a sec, getting back to what you just said
           before Gary...
A2GS       I'll bet you none of those machines were being displayed at a
           booth owned by
A2GS       Apple...
A2GS       Now as for Dwight's question...
AFA Gary J You're right!  But I was still surprised.
A2GS       Yes, Commodore makes a PC clone which I believe is 286 based and
           the Amiga 
A2GS       which is 68000 based and the Commodore 64c which is 6502 based
           (assuming they 
A2GS       are still making it)
A2GS       But basically it's main machine is the Amiga which is not the
           hottest selling
A2GS       thing here in America but seems to be very strong in Europe.
A2GS       GA
DwightW1   i asked because Apple probably wants to
DwightW1   move in one direction only.  Could differing machines split the
           company?
DwightW1   .... ga
A2GS       Absolutely NO reason why it should!
AFA Gary J GA, Coach
Coach101   Dwight has a very good point...   It would seem that a company
           could
Coach101   operate more economically with only one line of processor
           chip....
Coach101   Also, does any company actively market two of their products
           into
Coach101   the same market?   ga
AFA Gary J GA, A2
Coach101   oops... two competing products into the same marketplace
A2GS       There is NO reason why the systems should have to compete with
           each other...
A2GS       Apple is ONE big company not 2 small companies wrestling for the
           same market
A2GS       they have about 9 Mac systems (lost count) all basically going for
           the business
A2GS       market and you don't see Apple killing any one of those systems no
           matter how
A2GS       similar they may be.  Now in defense of Apple (for a change)
           Gassee mentioned]
A2GS       in his keynote address when asked a similar question... that this
           the first
A2GS       time Apple has ever been faced in the 12 years they've been around
           with having
A2GS       to deal with 2 successful machines in a wide range of markets and
           their
A2GS       basically learning one step at a time on how to deal with the
           situation.
A2GS       Personally, this excuse may hold for a while, but then again
           they've had these
A2GS       2 set's of machines (Macintosh/][) in existance for the past 5-6
           years.  How do
A2GS       you explain that Apple?  GA
AFA Gary J Ok, We're loosing everyone here... Let's get to Doctor Why's
           question
Doctor Why When can we expect SCSI Utilities from Apple that recognizes
           resource forks?
A2GS       LOL
AFA Gary J :)
Doctor Why I have 5.0 on my hard disk and I'm not happy about not being able
           to back it up
Coach101   SCSI utilites and resource forks....     What do you mean...
JDavies1   Is there a Backup utility for use under System 5.0, mainly with
           resource forks
Coach101   ProSel-16....   Works like a champ.....  
JDavies1   no? (that's what I wanted to know)
Doctor Why I've heard that there was a problem with Prosel-16's backup.
AFA Gary J Yes, ProSel-16 works.
Doctor Why or at least a potential problem.
AFA Gary J What kind of problem?
Coach101   You need the correct version.   Anything above 7.0 is OK (I
           think)....
Coach101   Try DirectConnect in AUT for more information...
Doctor Why It was mentioned at an Applefest conference, but not in detail
Doctor Why Ok, I'll look there.
JDavies1   Thanks, from me too
