Topic:   Getting Started for Novice Progammers
           and Announcment of Release of System
           Software 5.0 for the Apple IIGS
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet)

AFL Dyfet  We will be getting started here momentarilily, but we should give
           a chance for
AFL Dyfet  others to arrive first...
AFL Dyfet  I see we have incomming people still, so we will give this 1 more
           minute for
AFL Dyfet  late arrivals...
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I think we should be getting started...Good evening and
           welcome to the
AFL Dyfet  Apple II Development forum's tuesday night chat.  Tonight's topic
           is 'getting
AFL Dyfet  started', a special conf. for novice programmers.  We will be
           using PROTOCOL
AFL Dyfet  tonight starting now.  This means if you have a question to ask,
           you must enter
AFL Dyfet  a '?' on a blank line, and if you wish to comment on the current
           question at
AFL Dyfet  hand, you must enter a '!' on a line by itself.  I will call each
           of you in
AFL Dyfet  turn.  But, before we get started tonight (so hold off on those
           '?' keys :), we
AFL Dyfet  have several special annoucements to make.  For the first of
           these, I will be
AFL Dyfet  turning over the floor to Dave Lyons, who has some news many of
           you have been
AFL Dyfet  waiting to hear.  GA Dave :)
Dave Lyons "Summer" is here!  System Software 5.0 is *shipping* now, so your
           dealers may
Dave Lyons already have it.  If they don't they should soon.  Retail price is
           $49.
Dave Lyons (Dealers are *allowed* but not required to give you free updates,
           without
Dave Lyons the manual.)
AFA Gary J (Yeah!)
Coach101   Applause Applause Applause
Furkle     ?
AFL Dyfet  I know all of you are happy to hear this.  In addition, we will be
           providing
AFL Dyfet  this update online as soon as it arrives.  Also, we will have a
           new batch of
AFL Dyfet  technotes available in the near future...
AFL Dyfet  I think the GS/OS team deserves a lot of credit for what they have
           done in
AFL Dyfet  this short of time, but I do not see any members here offhand, so
           I guess Dave
AFL Dyfet  Lyons will have to convey our appreciation :)
Dave Lyons (Post it!  They read Let's Discuss.)
AFL Dyfet  Yes they do, and I'm sure they would appreciate the thanks...:)
Dave Lyons Not just the GS/OS team, but the Finder/utilities team, the
           toolbox team, and
Dave Lyons the printing team, too!
AFL Dyfet  Very true!
AFL Marty  (Is there an uploading team? :)
AFL Dyfet  :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, is there anyone here who would like to add any comments on
           GS/OS's
Windrider5 ?
AFL Dyfet  release at this point?
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our first question is from Furkle, please go ahead
           with your
AFL Dyfet  question now...
Furkle     question has been answered, thanks
AFL Dyfet  Well, we aim to please :).  I believe our next question is from
           Windrider.  GA.
Windrider5 Is it true that we will need more than technotes to understand all
           the changes
Windrider5 in 5.0
Dave Lyons !
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave!
Dave Lyons Yes.
Coach101   ?
Dave Lyons The documentation you need will be available later this year from
           APDA;
Dave Lyons hopefully this summer.
AE PhilM   ?
Dave Lyons You can still use the old features without new documentation, of
           cours.e
Coach101   -?
Dave Lyons Some documentation will be sent to Apple Partners earlier than
           that, too.
Dave Lyons (ga)
AFL Dyfet  Thank you Dave.  Okay, I see Gary has a question to sneak in
           :)..GA Gary...
AFA Gary J Will this be in the form of a toolbox reference update, or is
           there more?
Dave Lyons !
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave...
Dave Lyons There will be more than one documentation product from APDA for
           5.0; no
Dave Lyons specific details are available now.  ga
AFA Gary J Thanks (and keep up the good work!)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next question is from AE Phil.  You may have
           the floor now.
AE PhilM   In 5.0 the docs say that the SF Manager now need 4 pages of ZP. 
           One for itself
Dave Lyons !
AE PhilM   and three for the list manager.  I never initialize the list
           manager in the 
AE PhilM   eariler stuff I did...but it is working.  How is that??
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave...
Dave Lyons Nope--some of the documentation was misleading; it is actually
           supposed to say
Dave Lyons (and does, in some of the documentation) that SF needs 4 pages of
           *stack
Dave Lyons space*, not direct page.  You just have to make sure you have a
           lot of stack
Dave Lyons space available when you make an SF call.  SF takes care of
           starting up the
AE PhilM   OK...thanks Dave!   It does use the list manager tho...right??
Dave Lyons List Manager for its own use.  If you aren't using it directly,
           you don't need
Dave Lyons to worry about starting it up; if you *are* using the List Manager
           yourself,
AE PhilM   Ok..thanks.
AE PhilM   done
Dave Lyons you shoul still load and start it.  (SF might not *always* start
           the list
Dave Lyons manager up automatically!)  ga
AE PhilM   I will then. done
AFL Dyfet  Okay, thanks Dave.  For our late arrivals who missed the
           announcement, System
AFL Dyfet  Disk 5.0 is NOW SHIPPING :)
HyperRam   ?
AFL Dyfet  GA HyperRam...
HyperRam   How long do you expect it will take before we have it for
           download? :)
AFA Gary J Sometime this Summer  :)
HyperRam   Sometime. :)
HyperRam   GA
Phoenix36  ?
AFL Dyfet  :)...basically as soon as we get our hot little hands on it over
           here :)
AFL Dyfet  I believe our next question is from Phoenix, GA Phoenix...
Phoenix36  What makes 5.0 so much better than 4.0?
AE PhilM   !
AFL Dyfet  Phil, was that a comment for Pheonix?  GA Phil...
Coach101   ?
AE PhilM   No..just wanted to say that AE will start shipping 5.0 on Vulcan
           and Sonic 
AE PhilM   Blaster before the end of the week.  That's all!
Coach101   !
AFL Dyfet  Thank you, Phil...As to Phoenix's question, that can take a long
           explanation...
AFL Dyfet  to put it simply, SPEED!!!  Faster desktop with new improved and
           very optimized
AFL Dyfet  tools, faster disk I/O, etc etc :)...GA Coach...
HyperRam   ?
Phoenix36  !
Coach101   Pick almost anything under 4.0 and it is faster under 5.0....  
           MUCH FASTER
Coach101   GA
AFL Dyfet  GA Phoenix...you have the floor, after all :)
Phoenix36  Speed is really worth the $49, because AWGS needs faster window
           management. 
Coach101   !
AFL Dyfet  There is also a new and improved Finder to look forward to, which
           benifits well
AFL Dyfet  from the improved speed of the tools :).  GA Coach...
Coach101   One word of caution for Phoenix,
Coach101   Do not go out to buy coffee and donuts when starting Appleworks-GS
           under 5.0!
HyperRam   LOL!
Coach101   :)
AFL Dyfet  :)...Anyone else wish to add any further comments on System
           Software 5.0 at
AFL Dyfet  this time?
JSchober   "Wowwwwww..."
HyperRam   ?
Phoenix36  !
AFL Dyfet  Go Ahead Phoenix...
AFL Vince  just that it will be at your dealers by week's end.
Phoenix36  With 5.0 on a hard disk all those 1 meg applications, should load
           like the Mac
HyperRam   ???
Phoenix36  i mean fast with TranswarpGS
AFL Dyfet  Your question is on record, HyperRam :)...And yes, the benifit in
           some
AFL Dyfet  situations is very much like or even faster than that found under
           4.0 with a
AFL Dyfet  Transwarp GS, although there is nothing stopping you from gaining
           even more
AFL Dyfet  by having one with 5.0 :)
AE PhilM   ditto :)
AFL Dyfet  Well, I believe our next question is from Coach.  You now have the
           floor...
Coach101   Under 5.0, some applications (for example FINDER) remember the
           lower
Coach101   case letters in my file names.  How is this handled from a
           compatibility
Coach101   issue with programs that may convert all lowercase letters to
           uppercase
Coach101   letters before passing them on to GS/OS?  GA
Dave Lyons !
AFL Dyfet  The case is not stored in the ProDOS filename itself, but in the
           old ProDOS
AFL Dyfet  version ID bytes found in each directory entry.  ProDOS 8, for
           example, will
AFL Dyfet  still see filenames the way it always had, irregardless of how the
           case was set
AFL Dyfet  from GS/OS.  GA Dave.
Dave Lyons No handling is necessary, possible, or present...apps that convert
           pathnames to
AFL Vince  sounds like an old Appleworks trick to me.. :)
Dave Lyons all uppercase before making GS/OS calls will always create
           filenames that are
AFA Gary J Yep  :)
Dave Lyons all uppercase.  All current FSTs ignore case, so it isn't a
           problem--it just
Dave Lyons may look ugly.
Dave Lyons (ga)
Coach101   So, AFILE and afile are the same file on disk?
AFL Dyfet  I'm sure SOMEONE will come out with a utility to capitolize all
           your filenames
AFL Dyfet  properly :)
Dave Lyons Yes, AFILE and afile are the same file on disk.  I should have
           said
AFA Parik  ?
AFA Gary J ugh :)  (Verry punny  :)
AFA Gary J err...very
Dave Lyons above that all current FSTs ignore case when matching filenames;
Dave Lyons they *record* the case so that it comes back right later when you
           read the
Dave Lyons directory.  ga
Coach101   Tanks...   Im done...
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next question is from HyperRam.  GA Hyper, you
           have the
AFL Dyfet  floor now...
HyperRam   I know this is a dumb question but does 5.0 spped up the 'screen'
           like in 
HyperRam   games?
HyperRam   :)
AFL Dyfet  That depends...if they use toolset calls, yes...
HyperRam   BBL
AFL Vince  Ok, let's cut the FNs..  :)
Dave Lyons !
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave...
Dave Lyons Games that already go right to the screen to do their animation
           will not be
Dave Lyons sped up by 5.0.  ga
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next question is from AFA Parik.  You have the
           floor now...
AFA Parik  Does 5.0 splash the colors correctly on bootup?  Is there any way
           we can make
AFA Parik  sure that apps don't stomp around $012000?  Or does the loader
           automatically
AFA Parik  set nospecialmem when loading programs?
Dave Lyons !
AFL Dyfet  You can set the appropriate bits in the load files
           themselves....GA Dave, I'm
AFL Dyfet  sure you will have more to add :)
Dave Lyons What's the "correct" way to splash colors correctly on bootup? 
           Under 5.0, apps
Dave Lyons are very unlikely to load in bank 1...if the system can avoid it,
           it doesn't
Dave Lyons load them in special memory.  Safest thing is to set the
           no-special-memory
Dave Lyons attribute in your segment kinds.
AFA Parik  the betas running around keep the background color blue.
Dave Lyons It's GQUIT that tries to avoid it, not the loader (there's a flag
           you pass to
AFA Parik  but what about programs we didn't write.  I can't notice a speedup
           in DPII
AFA Parik  when booting from Orca/M.  :(
Dave Lyons InitialLoad saying if it's okay to load into special memory or
           not).
Dave Lyons The bootup screen is light blue, just like the default desktop
           pattern is; it
Dave Lyons is no longer supposed to match the border color.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, any further comments?
AFA Parik  ga
AFL Dyfet  Okay, the Q is empty, I see...I also see that we have drifted
           quite far away
AFL Dyfet  from what tonight's topic was originally scheduled :)...So I will
           throw the
AFL Dyfet  remaining time and questions open to any programming subject
           people wish to
AFL Dyfet  ask about...feel free to get your questions in the queue :)
AFA Parik  Dave, do you know if the docs for 5.0 are shipping to developers,
           or should we
AFA Parik  buy it from APDA?
AE PhilM   !
Dave Lyons !
AFL Dyfet  GA Phil...
TomH47     ?
AFL Scott  ?
AE PhilM   Developers are expected to get a mailing later this week...that's
           what I have
AE PhilM   been told.
Dave Lyons You should definitely buy the APDA stuff when it becomes
           available.  Some
Dave Lyons preliminary stuff is being sent to all Partners soon.
AFA Parik  ga
Coach101   !?
AFL Vince  Do you know if APDA has the toolbox update reference, dave?
Dave Lyons I don't think they have any 5.0 documentation yet.
AFL Dyfet  I don't believe they have it available yet...
AE PhilM   !
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach...
Coach101   Whats the difference between a Developor and a Partner (pay $600+
Coach101   and get a deferred mailing?)?   GA
Dave Lyons ! (really Matt in disguise)
AFL Dyfet  That was a sneaky question, Coach :)...GA Dave...
AFL Dyfet  (or Matt :)
Dave Lyons He said "partners" (meaning people who currently receive Developer
           Price Lists
Dave Lyons ) since we don't know if Associates will get it or not.  Partners
           will.  GA.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe Phil had a comment...GA Phil...
AE PhilM   APDA does NOT have any 5.0 stuff yet....I called today about just
           that!
Coach101   Ok, I was thoroughly confused and making {poor} joke!  Not a
           complaint!
AE PhilM   done
AFL Dyfet  Okay...I believe our next question is from TomH.  Go ahead,
           Tom...
TomH47     I am currently teaching myself TML Pascal.  Is it a good language?
            If not
TomH47     could you recommend?
Dave Lyons !
AFL Vince  Is TML good, or is Pascal good?
TomH47     What I should go to
TomH47     Ok, is it a useful language
AFL Dyfet  First, Dave, GA...I know Vince will have something to add after
           you :)
Dave Lyons I wrote DIcEd (a usable icon editor) completely in TML Pascal
           standalone; so
Dave Lyons it is definitely "good."  I can't really compare it with any other
           Pascals,
Dave Lyons since I haven't done a nontrivial amount of work in any of them. 
           It does have
Dave Lyons some annoying aspects, but I expect they will be cleared up when
           TML Pascal II
Dave Lyons ships.  ga
TomH47     Thank you
AFL Vince  We do have our share of bugs in Pascal I.
AFL Vince  However, Pascal II has been setup for the novice/intermediate
           level programer.  All of the
AFL Vince  resource construction for 5.0 is done with a graphic based point
           and click style editor.  After
AFL Vince  you create those structures all you need do to get your programs
           running is put in the "glue" routines
AFL Vince  We're also running it on a Pascal testing suite of over 300
           programs that test all aspects of a Pacal
AFL Vince  compiler before we release it, so I dont think you'll find too
           many of the annoying things Dave
TomH47     Then it is a good time to be learning, right.  Note: Ordered TML
           II recently
AFL Vince  was refering to in this particular version.
AFL Vince  Also, we're not planning an APW compatible product to go along
           with Pascal II for those that are
AFL Vince  interested.  GA
AFL Vince  Anytime is a good time to be learning... :)
TomH47     ;)
AFL Vince  I learn every day, ask Dave, he's been giving me some lessons
           recently.. :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next, and possibly last, question for this
           evening is from
AFL Dyfet  AFL Scott.  GA Scott...
AFL Scott  APW version 2.... When is it due? Or is it even due, yet?
Coach101   Fall :)
AFL Dyfet  Well, unfortunately, Tim is not here to defend the honour of the
           APW team, but
AFL Scott  and...
AFL Dyfet  fall is what I have heard also...
AFL Scott  Does MPWGS do linking, too? 
AFL Scott  Done.
AFL Vince  MPW GS works well, and yes, it links and compiles resources.
AFA Parik  so we can't express programs until fall?  ack.
AFL Scott  Worried more about linking large programs not resources at this
           time. Thanks!
AFL Dyfet  Okay, do we have any more questions or comments for this
           evening?
AE PhilM   OA-F and OA-G are too close together...need to learn Davorak.
Coach101   Congratulations to the 5.0 team on a job WELL DONE!!!!
AFA Gary J Amen!
AFL Dyfet  Apple's excellant operating system :)
TomH47     Congrats Team
AFL Dyfet  (or should that be excellant system software :)
AE PhilM   ?
AFL Dyfet  GA Phil...
AE PhilM   The MIDI stuff in 5.0 is still not 100% with the 6850 driver are
           there any
AE PhilM   plans to correct the problems??
AE PhilM   It's MUCH better tho...
AE PhilM   done
AFA Parik  (btw Phil - is AA now shipping?  puhleeze say yes! :)
AE PhilM   No Parik....still battaling with 5.0 MIDI tools....it's working
           about 99%
AE PhilM   But once in a while it looses a byte and gets totally messed up.
AE PhilM   I'm not sure what more I can do....????
AFA Parik  i'll beta test it for you.  :)
AE PhilM   Same problem with MS JR.
AE PhilM   So I'm pretty sure it's not my code.
AFL Dyfet  Well, I guess we will have to wait and see what happens there,
           Phil...
AFA Parik  well - have fun figuring it out Phil.  We're counting on you.  go
           go go and all
AFA Parik  that stuff.  
Coach101   See you all next week.....
