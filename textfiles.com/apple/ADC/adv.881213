Topic: Pascal and C
Forum Leader: James Luther (AFL Jim)


AFL Jim    Looks like a nice small group tonight...
JSchober   Ummm... not too much....  yup, Jim...
AFL Tom    Cozy.
AFL Jim    The topic is Pascal and C, Shadow, but we rarely stick to it.
AFA Gary J I haven't noticed our banner yet, though.
AFL Jim    We'll see if Santa-Eileen programmed one for us.
JSchober   'tain't a banner... 'tis a wyrm... (pronounced: wyrm...)
Shadow100  Apple pascal or TML(other) pascal?
JSchober   Hi, Airship.
Dave Lyons As long as we're not on topic yet, somebody please explain to me
           why "lowest
AFL Jim    Either, Both
Airship    Hi everybody.
AFA Gary J Hi Airship
Dave Lyons common denomonator" in Life means something _minimal_, while w/
           fractions it
ScottG25   Howdy air!
JSchober   Hi Parik, Dennis!
Dave Lyons means something that is _bigger_than a collection of things,
           actually having
ScottG25   Howdy Parik!
Dave Lyons each of them as a _factor_?
Airship    Hmmmmm....sounds deep...
JSchober   Errr.... <bzzzzzt!> <Dave's Q just fizzled what was left of my
           brain..........>
AFA Parik  Hiya all.  I'm doing some work outside the house, so don't pay
           attention to me
AFA Parik  :-)
AFA Gary J Hmmm.  Sounds like a question you should program a computer to
           figure out...
AFA Gary J :)
JSchober   :) Gary...
AFL Jim    42
Dave Lyons :)
AFL Jim    Hi Dennis
AFL Jim    Hi Parik
DennisDoms Hi, all.
AFL Jim    We're all here, so let's get started.
JSchober   All?? Ok, welllll... :)
AFL Jim    Welcome to the Apple II Development Forum. Tonight's scheduled
           topic is Pascal
JSchober   (yo Matt!)
AFL Jim    and C. I'm Jim Luther, the Forum Leader here and Gary Jacobson,
           AFA Gary J, is
AFL Jim    the Forum Assistant for this forum.
AFL Jim    Poke? That's BASIC?
AFA Parik  (Hi Matt & John)
JSchober   :) Jim...
JSchober   (hi John)
AFA Gary J (Just what I was thinking!)
AFL Jim    Hi Matt, John
AFL Jim    Obviously, the banners *don
AFL Jim    *don't* come from Quantums technical department.
AFA Gary J :)
JSchober   (hi, Mike)
Dave Lyons Yeah, you can write a Poke in either Pascal or C, Jim :)
AFL Jim    Aren't pointers great?
JSchober   (howdy, Steve...)
Dave Lyons void Poke(addr,val) char *addr; char val; { *addr = val; }   :-)
St SteveW  Hiya Joe
AFL Jim    About the only new news I have in the Apple II Pascal/C world is
           that TML,
JSchober   (hi, John)...
AFL Jim    the Byte Works and Apple are working together to standardize the
           Pascal
AFL Jim    interfaces to the IIGS Toolbox. There will be some changes to both
           TML and ORCA
JSchober   (hi Cecil)
CecilFret  Hi guys (and gals?)
AFL Jim    Pascal as a result, but it should make writing books, magazine
           articles, etc.
AFL Jim    a lot easier.
AFL Jim    Hi Cecil, John, St...
St SteveW  Hi Jim
AFL Jim    Hi Sue
JSchober   (hi, Sue...)
SueFox     Hi Jim
SueFox     Hi All
AFL Jim    Pascal interface standards should also make it possible for Apple
           to publish
AFL Jim    more technical information using Pascal examples.
AFL Jim    Tom, Matt, do either of you know how far along these standards
           are?
JSchober   (hi, Jack!)
Matt DTS   I'll pass that one to Tom.
AFL Jack   hiya Joe  :)
AFL Tom    Thanks, Matt.  No, I am not sure.  I should pass that one on to
           Tim Swihart,
AFL Tom    but he's not here!
CecilFret  I know I jumped in late, but how about standards for C??????
           also
AFL Tom    And about the examples, Jim, I'll leave a hint that you have a
           good idea about examples.
AFL Jim    The first I heard of it was at the Apple Spring Developer's
           Conference last
AFL Jim    April.
AFL Jim    also what, Cecil?
AFL Jim    (Hi Steve)
Airship    What's the learning curve like for C?
CecilFret  The also was an afterthought.  My point is, give C equal time with
           respec to
CecilFret  pascal
CecilFret  Airship, what other languages do you know?
AFL Jim    What language(s) do you know already, Airship?
AFL Jim    :)
AFL Tom    (Is there an echo in here?)
AFL Jim    ...in here?)
Airship    Very experience in BASIC, dabble in Pascal, intermediate 65c02.
JSchober   ...in here?)  ...here?)  ...here?)
CecilFret  No echo, just people from Missoure thinking alike jus like great
           minds:)
JSchober   (hi Hal)
AFA Gary J GMTA
Dave Lyons You shouldn't have much trouble w/ C, then...'course, a "lint"
           utility would
CecilFret  Airship, the Pascal people will laugh me right off the screen,
           however....
AFL Jim    Going from Pascal to C was very easy for me Airship
Dave Lyons help a lot, since it would catch a lot of errors that aren't
           "really" errors
CecilFret  I have dabbled in both languages and found C to follow Pascall
           easily.
Dave Lyons as far as the compiler's concerned.
AFL Jim    (Hello HalC2)
CecilFret  Gotta watch C though. As long as bracketes {} match, C will figure
           out somethin
CecilFret  to do with it
HalC2      Hello Jim
Matt DTS   There's currently more of a need for standards since there are two
           Pascal...
Dave Lyons :)  Yeah, making a punctuation error in C usually results in a
           valid programs
Matt DTS   ...compilers out there, but only one C compiler (from Apple).
Dave Lyons (er...program) that doesn't do what you wanted.
Airship    Is there a C comiler other than APW currently available?
AFA Gary J So far..Matt.
JSchober   (hi, Doc)
HalC2      I am looking for a good Pascal or C compiler for the AppleII. I
           have APWC
HalC2      and TML Pascal for my IIGS
HalC2      Any suggestions?
MikeJK     ORCA C is due early next year.
AFL Jim    Hal: The only one you don't have is ORCA/Pascal
AFA Gary J Hal, are you talking about Pascal or C for a NON IIGS Apple II?
Dave Lyons HalC2, you're looking for a non-GS C compiler?
HalC2      But I need these to support the older IIe and IIc
Airship    I've heard APW can be pretty overwelming unless you're pretty
           experienced.
JSchober   (hi, Ksuther...   EGADS! 20!!)
Dave Lyons (echo, echo...)
Doc Banks  How different will ORCA C be from APW C, which I'm using now?
AFL Jim    Hi Kathryn
KSUTHER    Hello folks. 
AFA Gary J Q = Hal
THE GIBBER It won't be too much different, look at the differences in apw and
           orca/m ;)
AFL Jim    Mike Westerfield has stated that ORCA/C will be very compatible
           with APW/C
CecilFret  Uhoh the boss just showed up!!!.  HI msk
CecilFret  Airship, I don't think APW is all that bad.  After all, the IIgs
           is not really
KSUTHER    Hello Tractor man
CecilFret  for beginners.
AFL Jim    Hal: I believe that one of the 2 Pascal compilers for the //e is
           now gone, tat
Doc Banks  I'm brand new to C, and I like challenges, so I haven't found APW
           C too bad.
AFL Jim    that is Kyan Pascal. Apple Pascal is still available from APDA.
Airship    Can you run APW on a 1.25 meg machine with one 3.5 drive (& a
           5.25)?
Matt DTS   If you enjoy personal frustration, yes.
AFL Jim    :)
CecilFret  Not the best but possible Airship.  As long as you have APW on 3.5
           and source
Matt DTS   Maybe.
CecilFret  on 5.25"
THE GIBBER LOL
HalC2      Airship, I have. I know have 2 of each and thats not enough.
JSchober   (hi, Ralfy) LOL Matt...
JSchober   (hi Fuzzzzy)
Ralfy      Hi.  Lots of people here.
THE GIBBER I got frustrated with 2 3.5's and I bought a 60 meg hd for my
           workshop
Fuzzzzy    Hi.
Airship    Hmmmm...sounds like the best thing to do is wait for Orca/C or the
           like.
JSchober   :) John... agreed.... HD's are inifinitely nicer than floppies,
           especially for
JSchober   development... (and BBS'es.. %)
HalC2      Gibber, who made the drive?
AFL Jim    Hal: The only C I know of for the //e is Manx Aztec C which seemed
           to be very
AFA Parik  Not when they die...
THE GIBBER Rodime
JSchober   :) Parik...
AFL Jim    slow last time I saw it.
Fuzzzzy    Wasn't there a Hippo C for the //?
Airship    I've got Aztec C...haven't got too far into it yet but it seems to
           be a good...
DennisDoms That was WSM (Hippo C)...they're gone, too. (sigh)
Airship    system to learn the fundamentals on.
AFL Jim    Oh yeah... there's Small-C from the Byte Works, but it is more of
           a learning
CecilFret  There used to be a good small C available from out outfit in
           Arizona.  I don't
AFL Jim    tool. Not for writing applications.
CecilFret  know if they are still in business.
JSchober   (hi Charles)
BIG LYFORD Hello Joe
AFL Jim    Hi Charles
BIG LYFORD Hi All
BIG LYFORD What's up?
KSUTHER    It would be nice to have a comparative review of the different C's
           out there.
Airship    For learning C it looks like Manx Apprentice C is hard to beat
           (only $20!).
HalC2      Thanks for the C compiler suggestions.
KSUTHER    Anyone interested in tackling this project for Call -A.P.P.L.E.
CecilFret  Hey all you C people, K Suther made a good point.  Let me add my
           two bits
Matt DTS   (That would be the solicited rate, guys!  Better jump!)
AFL Jim    Does *anyone* know what happened to Kyan Software?
CecilFret  and ask you experts to put together some articles on C
Dave Lyons :)
AFL Jim    :) Matt
Dave Lyons (My  :)  was for Matt, too)
Matt DTS   (Don't shoot me, Kathryn... :-)
KSUTHER    :- humm haven't learned that one yet.
BIG LYFORD I looked at C. It makes no sense.  Needed: a book comparing BASIC
           to C, line by
BIG LYFORD line
Matt DTS   It's one where the) serves two purposes.  ASCII economy.
AFL Jim    For those you you who haven't been introduced, Cecil and Kathryn
           are the editor
AFL Jim    and technical editor of Call-A.P.P.L.E. magazine.
Dave Lyons Big L, have you done anything with Pascal?  Makes a much easier
           comparison.
JSchober   I know Cecil, but hi, Kathryn.   :)
Dave Lyons A lot of things in C have no parallels in BASIC (local variables,
           parameter
Dave Lyons passing, etc.).
BIG LYFORD No. I seem stuck on Applesoft.
CecilFret  Uh Oh Jschober, how did we meet
Matt DTS   I have this book from Compute! (don't laugh) called "From BASIC to
           C"...
JSchober   Errr.... well, here...  :)
Matt DTS   ...which does a fairly decent job of leveraging off BASIC
           knowledge...
Matt DTS   ...to teach C concepts and practices.
Fuzzzzy    Matt:  Haha
CecilFret  Comparing line by line C to BASIC is not all that straightforward
           Big Lyford
Doc Banks  I found Schildt's Advanced C (1st ed.) to be helpful in making
           conversion...
Doc Banks  from BASIC to C.
Airship    That's the problem I had with C...looks pretty cryptic.
JSchober   Ummm... if anyone sent me a FN that I didn't answer... sorry....
           if it was 
JSchober   important, send it again s'il vous plait....
AFL Jim    I learned from the book, "Programming in C" by Stephen Kochan
JSchober   But ditto, Airship.  I have this funny feeling a C program is all
           commented
THE GIBBER Try programming when your Dyslexic.....  It is murder when
           debugging
JSchober   out.........
AFA Parik  (while Joe's swamped with FNs, lets all move to another room! 
           :)
Doc Banks  Bye, folks :)
CecilFret  C does not have to be cryptic Airship.  
JSchober   :PPPP Parik...
AFA Parik  Bye Doc!
AFA Gary J Bye Doc.
AFL Jim    Bye Doc
AFA Parik  Its extremely cryptic when you're reading the moniter upside
           down...
Dave Lyons It's more _fun_ when it's cryptic, though :)
JSchober   (hi Jeff)
BIG LYFORD There's an interesting idea " more fun if it's cryptic"
AFL Jim    char (*(*x()) []) ()
Dave Lyons Well, it's fun when you're _writing_ cryptic code, but not when
           you're trying
Dave Lyons to read somebody else's, although that's good practice for writing
           more of
BIG LYFORD I think it's more effective if it's understandable and useable.
JSchober   Riiiight Jim...
Dave Lyons your own later.
AFA Gary J Looks more like line noise than program logic.
St SteveW  That was a pretty cryptic message in its own right, Dave :)
JSchober   :)
Dave Lyons Are you going to decode that declaration for us, Jim?
AFA Gary J :)
Dave Lyons (There's a utility on some Unix systems that will actually do
           that, into
AFL Jim    :)
AFA Parik  Looks like something LaPub would serve when DTS is Serving...
Dave Lyons English description...called 'cdecl' I think.)
JSchober   hehehehehehehe
AFA Gary J LOL, Parik!
CecilFret  Translates to x=x doesn't it Jim?
Ralfy      Or x<>x?
AFL Jim    x: function returning pointer to array [] of pointer to function
           returning char
AFL Jim    :)
JSchober   Say WHAT?!
CecilFret  Airship, one thing about C or Pascal is their structured nature. 
           The new
AFA Gary J :)
CecilFret  BASICS for the IIgs are starting to introduce structured
           programming
CecilFret  capabilities.
Dave Lyons Gee, I was trying to work it out myself :(   :-)
AFA Parik  (lets go to LaPub and try to serve the drink Jim concocted :)
AFL Jim    The IIGS Toolbox is much easier to program with C or Pascal
           (compared to BASIC)
Dave Lyons Sure Joe, haven't you ever needed a data type like that?  :)
JSchober   ::gulp:: <faint>
CecilFret  For sure JIM!
Dave Lyons Ralfy, "<>" isn't part of C...try "!=" instead! :)
JSchober   Yeah, Dave... remind me to include THAT in UPD!! (re-starting work
           on it in
JSchober   three days......)
AFL Jim    Pascal and C both let you define your own data structures. With
           IIGS BASIC
BIG LYFORD I guess I'll stick with Applesoft.
Airship    Yeh...The structured Basic's are great...I'm really attracted to
           more...
Ralfy      My basic - you C.
Airship    structured langs. like Pascal or C... but sometimes they're like
           working...
AFA Parik  :) Ralfy
AFL Jim    languages, you must either use some kind of "glue" library
           routines to access
Ralfy      Read me for my
Dave Lyons Big L, please don't let Jim's example scare you away from C: it's
           NOT a
Airship    with a toolbox with too many tools...you've got to weed out those
           you need.
AFL Jim    the toolbox or load the toobox call's parameters into an array
           (Micol).
Dave Lyons typical data strucutre.  In general it's easier to do things with
           structures
CecilFret  Airship, Lichty and Eyes have a new book coming out soon. 
           Although it uses
Dave Lyons and arrays than in BASIC, since you can give every type a nice
           name and
Dave Lyons get at pieces of structures by name, etc.
CecilFret  assembly language, it is a good book to get to put some order into
           the toolbox
AFL Jim    Cecil, right!
CecilFret  Have you seen it JIM?
AFL Jim    Yes
CecilFret  I reviewed it in February
CecilFret  In final form JIM?
AFA Gary J February?  And it's not out yet?
AFL Jim    I didn't get to until November :(
Ralfy      Goodnight all....
CecilFret  I.E. bookstore?
AFA Parik  Night Ralfy!
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Ralph
JSchober   Night, Ralfy!
Airship    I'll look forward to it...
BIG LYFORD Night, Jon-Boy
AFL Jim    I've got a quick question for you all....
MikeJK     h
JSchober   GA Jim..... :)
CecilFret  ga jim
Airship    Speaking of arrays, I found TML BASIC has real problems when
           handling arrays.
AFL Jim    With APW's ability to add libraries to languages, what kind of
           library modules
AFL Jim    would you like to see available for C and Pascal?
JeffDWoods That beats Integer problems, Airship!  ;)
JSchober   Ummm... biased answer: something similar to Morgan's
           ModemWorks...
Airship    It has some weird quirks with integers too.:(
AFL Jim    I've already suggested that to Morgan, Joe.
JSchober   Oh.  :)
CecilFret  That's a biggy Jim.
JeffDWoods Jim, do you mean applications for libraries or implementation?  (I
           have Orca.)
AFL Jim    I mean ready to use libraries of routines.
AFL Jim    (something like mini-toolboxes)
JeffDWoods Do you mean libraries like the system loader uses?  I didn't think
           the linker
JeffDWoods supported them yet.
Airship    Clearly defined routines for handling graphics larger than the
           screen would...
AFA Parik  (dunno what a library is :) but how about some better text
           routines...windows
AFA Parik  and such.
AFL Jim    Some of the programming magazines (for non-Apple machines) seem to
           have lots
Dave Lyons Modules like Jim's talking about could be regular libraries _or_
           run-time
Airship    be nice along with a versatile screen dump library.
Dave Lyons libraries.  I'm not sure whether they're supported yet or not. 
           (As far as I
Dave Lyons know they're not.)
AFL Jim    of "toolkits" available for Turbo Pascal (for example)
JSchober   Parik... a library is just a correction of procedures, if you're
           in Pascal
JSchober   terms.  :)
JSchober   argh... correction = collection.
Dave Lyons Quickdraw II can already handle bigger-than-screen graphics,
           Airship.
JeffDWoods Automatic memory or disk based sorts (memory when available, disk
           otherwise)
CecilFret  Screen dump to where Airship?  File or Printer?
AFA Parik  Doesn't help me joe, but don't bother.  :)
Matt DTS   The MPW IIgs Linker (LinkIIgs) will create run-time libraries.
JSchober   :)
Dave Lyons Will the GS loader load them, Matt?
Airship    Printer...the current routines I use leave my graphics looking
           chunky.
Matt DTS   Yup.
Matt DTS   (if it doesn't, it's a bug)
THE GIBBER Joe, when aer uoy gniog to learn ot epyt?????
Airship    Yeh, QD II is nice, but its taking me forever to figure out the
           new terminology
JeffDWoods Has anybody (we know of) used run-time libraries yet?
JSchober   I dunno.... one day, John... ;)_
JSchober    <see?!>
ScottG25   This is off the subject, but I'd like to see more programs that
           make...
CecilFret  Airship, the November issue of Call -A.P.P.L.E. has a screen to
           printer CDA
CecilFret  with all the necessary code from Sandy Mossberg
SEGlass    Libraries don't have to be run time to be useful.
ScottG25   programming the user interface easier... such as layout, actions,
           etc..more
AFA Gary J It works too, Cecil.  (I tried it  :)
Airship    I like dump routines like Triple Dump were I can control the
           quality.
JeffDWoods But run-time libraries allow the code to be shared which saves
           memory & disk.
CecilFret  For sure AFA Gary J.  I modifed it to dump screen to text file.
AFL Jim    Linkable libraries are very useful - look at ORCA/M for an
           example.
Airship    Cecil...text screen or SHR screen?
JSchober   (hi Lance!)
AFA Gary J Exactly my idea, Cecil!  :)
CecilFret  Text screen Airship.  Code could be easily modifed tohandle SHR
           screen
CecilFret  I think!!!
SEGlass    Run-time libraries save disk space, but not necessarily space in
           memory.
CecilFret  Tain't easy AFA Gary
ScottG25   on the lines of a working thing, vice that dialog thing that I can
           never get to
ScottG25   run...
CecilFret  Amen SEGlass!!!!!
Airship    Yeh, I've seen a lot of text screen dumpers.
JeffDWoods Steve, memory is saved if two or more routines (like NDAs) are
           using the lib.
Airship    I'd like to set my pront dumps up so one pixel on the screen give
           one on the...
Airship    printer.
JeffDWoods Aren't they?
SEGlass    Only if the two things are in memory at the same time.  Not a
           likely
SEGlass    occurance.  Moreover, if you ship an application,
SEGlass    you will have to provide a copy of the run time library.  If you
           ship
SEGlass    another application you will have to ship another copy of the run
           time
SEGlass    library.  You will also make certain that your users know how to
           move
SEGlass    things to a hard disk so that the libraries can be found.  Only
SEGlass    then will you start saving disk space.
JSchober   (ok, night, Charles!)
BIG LYFORD Bye All.
SEGlass    The cost of that space is potential compatibility problems if
           there are ever
AFL Jim    The Toolboxes are a kind of library...
AFA Parik  Night Big Lyford!
SEGlass    more than one copy of the library around.  Believe me I know
           about
SEGlass    compatibility problems.
JeffDWoods But for multi-program applications, like NDAs etc., they would be
           nice.
Matt DTS   Only if the user had a large number of NDAs and programs which all
           used the...
SEGlass    No doubt they can be useful.  Just take care in deciding when it
           is
SEGlass    right to use them.
Matt DTS   ...same RTL, Jeff.  Otherwise multiple RTLs could clog the 2/
           directory.
SEGlass    A good example would be if you were to sell a collection of DAs
           and
JeffDWoods Also, for commercial Apps they have disadvantages, but they could
           be moved into
SEGlass    wanted to share code.
JeffDWoods the program file by changing to linked libs before shipping.
AFL Jim    That's exactly what Kyan did with their Code Optimizer package for
           Kyan Pascal.
Dave Lyons (Isn't acronym double-duty Fun?  RTL = return from subroutine
           long; run-time
Dave Lyons library; NDA = New Desk Accessory; nondisclosure agreement. 
           More?)
JSchober   :) Dave...
AFL Jim    They linked only the routines needed by your application into the
           executable
AFL Jim    file.
THE GIBBER No Daves Allowed????
JeffDWoods Can run-time libs be created by anything other the
           MPW-IIGS-cross-linker?
AFA Parik  Hehehe Dave
Matt DTS   DTP = Desktop publishing or Developer Texa Port... :-)
Dave Lyons (ADB = AppleWorks Database; Apple Desktop Bus)... :)
Dave Lyons :) Gibber
Matt DTS   The APW linker currently doesn't make Run time libraries, but I
           don't know...
THE GIBBER ADB= A Definite Bug ;)

AFA Parik  :)
Matt DTS   ...about the TML or ORCA linkers (or the Micol OMF converter)
SEGlass    There is an MPW x-dev tool called makelibiigs that makes
           libraries.
JeffDWoods I don't think Orca & TML can.
SEGlass    The MPW x-dev linker can link files that follow our OMF
           standards.
SEGlass    They can be created by the cross assembler, the apw assembler, a
           compiler
JeffDWoods Does MakeLibIIgs run on the Mac or GS?
SEGlass    running on either machine.  They all can be linked together and/or
           made into
SEGlass    libraries.
SEGlass    The IIGS suffix is for tools running under MPW on a Mac.
AFL Jim    Jeff: Mac
JeffDWoods So the only way to make a IIgs RTL is to buy a Mac. :(
AFL Jim    For now :)
SEGlass    Isn't there a makelib facility in APW?
JeffDWoods For over 2 years....
Matt DTS   Yeah, but the linker won't support run-time libraries, Steve.
AFL Jim    makelib under APW makes a linakable library, Steve.
JeffDWoods MakeLib makes linker libs.  Don't RTLs have a different format?
AFL Jim    (-a)
Fuzzzzy    I have a Mac II for sale - $1500.
SEGlass    I guess we gotta start somewhere.
AFL Jim    sure!
Fuzzzzy    <just kidding> :)
AFA Parik  Sold Fuzzzy.  :)
AFA Parik  dang.  :-)
JSchober   heh... $2.34 < $1500, but I can bounce a check, LOL....
THE GIBBER Check the serial number, and then lets have a b-b-Q ;)
Airship    Got iit Cecil, thanx.
AFA Gary J I had finger arrest there....the price knocked me off my chair,
           Fuzzzzy.  :)
JSchober   hehe Gary...
Fuzzzzy    <Did I say Mac II, I meant Apple II>
ScottG25   made a profit, Joe?  used to be 2.32..
AFA Parik  :-)
JSchober   :) Fuzzy...
JSchober   Yeah, I got a nickel from Marty.... %)
AFA Gary J OH!  Minor detail... (heheh)
Airship    Is that with 16K and all!?
THE GIBBER OHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   
JSchober   Oops... wrong. Dave owes me a nickel; Marty gave me $0.02...
AFL Jim    It looks as though our scheduled hour is up this week. Feel free
           to stick
AFL Jim    around longer.
AFA Parik  Dang, we didn't make 23+...:(
AFL Jim    Thnks for coming tonight.
AFA Parik  Wanted to see if the room would blow up.  :)
CecilFret  Yup, us grandpas to be need to get our beauty rest
SEGlass    There are good ways to simulate the run time libraries using user
           tools.
JSchober   Thanks, Jim... :)  It was most interesting.........
KSUTHER    Thanks Jim!
SEGlass    You don't need any linker support.
JeffDWoods Thanks for the info, Matt & Steve!  I appreciate the direct input.
            :)
AFA Parik  ::::clap:::: ::::clap::::
Dave Lyons Why do I owe you a nickel, Joe?
Airship    G'nite everybody!
AFA Gary J How's that, Steve?
Airship    ()()()()()()()()
CecilFret  Standing applause
JSchober   Something about a bet you made in AUT with Floyd about ACU... but
           I paid off
JSchober   the bet.... something like that.  ;)
CecilFret  Night all!
KSUTHER    Hey Dave Lyons, where is that article for Call you talked with
           Charlie about?
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Cecil.
AFA Parik  (let him rave a little Dave, its good for programmers to let out
           their
JSchober   >> From: Dave Lyons / >> I'll bet you a nickel........
JSchober   Night, Cecil!
AFA Parik  frustrations in chat rooms instead of in the shell :)
SEGlass    I think what I'll do is explain it all to Matt and have him post
           it.
MikeJK     Night all. Thanks fom a MUMPSTER
JSchober   Night, Mike.
AFL Jim    Gary: Steve's talking about writing your own Toolboxes.
AFL Jim    Bye Mike
AFA Gary J OK...
JeffDWoods Steve, do you consider user toolsets a good substitute for TRLs?
JeffDWoods oops... RTLs?
AFA Parik  Take 2 2x3' pieces of wood, saw together, put a top on, you have
           one sturdy 
AFA Parik  toolbox.
THE GIBBER LOL
SEGlass    I think it could be a good substitute.
JSchober   grrrrooaaan....
JSchober   Hi, Mike.
AFA Parik  Hi Mike!
Matt DTS   ("and HAVE him post it..."  And I thought just Harry didn't like
           me...)
Matt DTS   <professional grumbler>
JSchober   :)
AFA Gary J :)
THE GIBBER Is that the //gs Carpenter's tool box???
SEGlass    Matt, now everyone knows why we hired you?
Fuzzzzy    Matt: Done with the A2 technotes yet? <ducking>
Matt DTS   You just wait, Steve.  I'll get you, and your little dog, too.
JeffDWoods I think it is more cumbersome to interface with, but otherwise a
           good solution.
AFA Parik  Yup John.  Use it to take apart your GS and install faster parts. 
           :)
Matt DTS   TNs are in duplicatin.
AFA Parik  <amatuer grumbler>
JSchober   hehehehe Parik!
JSchober   ARE in, or will be RSN?? ;)
SEGlass    I must leave.  See you all soon.
Matt DTS   It's the same thing.  :-)
AFL Jim    Bye Steve
Matt DTS   G'night, Steve.
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Steve.
JSchober   hehehehehe... NOW we know... ;)
AFA Parik  (2 more days, and Apple package should be at my door :)
JSchober   Bye, Steve!
Dave Lyons Bye, Steve!
JeffDWoods Have the TNs been uploaded yet, or do they have to wait for
           duplication???  ;)
AFA Parik  Night Steve!
Fuzzzzy    So they'll be ready for the November developer mailing that is
           going to be mailed in Jan? ;)
THE GIBBER Afa Parik: What apple package is that ????
Matt DTS   The text files aren't done, but the paper ones are in
           duplication.
ScottG25   Fuzzy/////  LOL!!
Matt DTS   Text files are in progress.
AFA Parik  John, the developer packages always come in on the 15th for me,
           and the Septemb
Matt DTS   Well, g'night.  Gotta go read messages.
AFA Parik  issue promised me a whole new set of TNs.  Its gonna come
           eventually.  :)
JSchober   CUL Matt..
AFA Gary J Fuzzzzy...Apple's clock is 2 months slow..
AFA Parik  Bye Matt
THE GIBBER Is it the apple package from Colombia??????
JeffDWoods One would think the paper copies would printed from computer text
           files.  :)
Fuzzzzy    Gee, did I run Matt off? :)
AFL Jim    'Night, Matt
THE GIBBER Now we know where you get those crazy game Ideas ;)
ScottG25   Probably are, Jeff... MacWrite...
AFA Gary J They are, Jeff...MacWrite
AFA Parik  :P John
JSchober   Right, what Scott said... and Gary... :(
AFA Parik  (why don't they use AppleWorks GS?  hehehe)
JeffDWoods So what is the delay on uploads?
JSchober   LOL Parik...
AFA Gary J Right, Parik.. We need a conversion utility.
AFA Gary J (MacWrite to AppleWorks GS)
AFL Jim    Parik, they want them printed this year :)
AFA Parik  :)
Fuzzzzy    Parik:  They tried that but got too many "Serious Sytem Errors".
           hehehe
AFA Gary J hehehe
ScottG25   THAT is the best suggestion I've heard in ages!
JSchober   LOL Jim....
JeffDWoods How about "Print to disc","AFE", and import into GSWorks?
AFA Parik  And notice how the tech notes are justified...
AFA Parik  (try that in AW GS)
AFA Parik  Its appleWorks GS now Jeff.  (GSWorks -> AppleWorks GS)
Fuzzzzy    Jeff:  The technotes are in Mac format, Matt is working to convert
           them to straight text.
AFA Gary J Jeff...the graphics don't come across that way.
JSchober   Heck... classic AWorks will do THAT, Parik!
AFA Parik  hi F4Eart!
JeffDWoods But I strongly prefer GSWorks. :)  It's easier to say, & I liked
           StyleWare!
JSchober   Hi, F4...
JSchober   hehehe... it WAS a better name...
F4EART     hello !
AFA Parik  heheh Jeff.  
JSchober   Now we have this AppleWorks (Classic) vs AppleWorks GS stuff...
Fuzzzzy    I'm outta here.  Bye all.
AFA Parik  Does anyone know if the Print Managers justification routines
           work?
AFA Parik  Bye Fuzzzzy!
JeffDWoods If you care about how long ot takes to print there is NO decision
           to make!!!
AFL Jim    Sounds like the Coca-Cola wars all over again.
AFA Gary J :)
JSchober   hehehehe... Classic AW, New AW...
JSchober   fun fun fun...
AFA Parik  Tastes Great...
JSchober   Less filling!
AFA Parik  :)
JSchober   (Less expensive, too...)
THE GIBBER Appleworks Gs is a good idea.  Now they need a machine that will
           take it to 
AFA Gary J We just need to make the "classic" AppleWorks into a CDA now... 
           
THE GIBBER it's limits :)
JeffDWoods I don't think the Print Manager justifies buying GSWorks.  ;)
JSchober   hehehehe Gary...
Dave Lyons Tastes great / less speed
THE GIBBER LOL
JSchober   Gotta run for now, folks.... thanks for the chat, Jim/Gary... see
           y'all later!
AFA Parik  Bye Joe!
AFA Gary J Goodnight, Joe.
THE GIBBER By joey
ScottG25   Less speed!
