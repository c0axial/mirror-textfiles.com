APPLE II DEVELOPMENT FORUM CONFERENCE LOG
Tuesday, January 30, 1990  10:00 pm eastern time
Topic:  Ariel Publishing's "8/16" Apple II Technical Journal

AFA Gary J Ok, let's get started.
AFA Gary J Welcome to the Apple II Development Forum.  I'm Gary Jacobson,
           filling
AFA Gary J in for Dave Sugar (AFL Dyfet) who's out of town this evening. 
           Tonight's
AFA Gary J topic and special guest(s) is Ariel Publishing, and their new
           Apple II
AFA Gary J technical journal called "8/16".
AFA Gary J Our guests this evening (please correct me if I get this wrong :)
            are
AFA Gary J Eric Mueller, the 16 bit editor for 8/16, and oops..
AFA Gary J it looks like Jerry just dropped off :)
Eric 816   :)
AFA Gary J :)
AFA Gary J Well, anyway, Jerry Kindall was here, the 8 bit editor for 8/16.
           :)
Eric 816   Is Ross here yet?
AFL FrankD You're going to see a LOT of that tonight.  Completely destroyed
           my conference the last hour.
AFA Gary J I haven't seen him, but don't know his screen name (Ross's, that
           is)
Eric 816   Ross should be along any moment now... it's "Ariel Pub" (I
           think)
AFA Gary J Eric, before we open up the floor to questions, could you tell us
           a little
AFA Gary J about yourself and the new magazine?
Eric 816   Suuure...
Eric 816   Let me start with me <grin>...
Eric 816   I've been programming Apple IIs professionally for about 3 years
           now...
Eric 816   And I knew Ross back when we both lived in the wilds of Alaska.
           Between my...
Eric 816   freelance work and Ross' newsletters, I ended up submitting a lot
           of stuff...
Eric 816   to the (now-incorporated-in-8/16) "Sourceror's Apprentice", an
           assembly...
Eric 816   language programming newsletter...
Eric 816   I'm pleased to be the IIgs editor of 8/16 because I absoutely love
           to check...
Eric 816   out new source code and programming tips. :) ...
Eric 816   Enough about me. Ariel Publishing has been around for about four
           years (and...
Eric 816   perhaps more; you'll have to ask Ross). We started publishing
           three Apple...
Eric 816   newsletters: "Reboot", an Applesoft-BASIC programming newsletter,
           "ZNews", a...
Eric 816   ZBASIC programming newsletter, and the above-mentioned
           "Sourceror's...
Eric 816   Apprentice". When Call-APPLE ceased publication a few months ago
           (rest in...
Eric 816   peace), we decided to incorporate the three newsletters into one:
           the new...
Eric 816   magazine, 8/16. We're shooting for 40-50 pages of material each
           month, ...
Eric 816   with every article including source code.
Eric 816   I think that's about it. (ga)
AFA Gary J Thank you.  I might mention here that I just released in the
           Article's and
AFA Gary J Transcripts section of our software library a file outlining
           "Writer's
AFA Gary J Guidelines" for submission of articles to 8/16.  I'm impressed by
           what you
AFA Gary J are looking for in the way of articles, and it sounds like 8/16
           is going to
AFA Gary J do a good job of filling the void left by Call A.P.P.L.E.
Eric 816   Thanks Gary (and thanks for releasing the file).
AFA Gary J Ok, I'd like to open the floor up to questions now.  Let's use
           PROTOCOL,
AFA Gary J which means if you have a question, type a "?" on a line by
           itself, or if
AFA Gary J you have a comment on the current topic, type a "!" on a line by
           itself.
AFA Gary J Questions, anyone?
AFA Gary J I have one, while everyone is thinking.  I understand that the
           first
AFA Gary J issue is due out in March.  Are you still on schedule to premier
           then?
Eric 816   Gary - you bet! :) We're going to mail the first issue out
           around...
Eric 816   the end of February.
AFA Gary J Great!  I guess I'd better get on the ball and get my order in
           :)
AFA Gary J Ok, Frank.  GA with your question.
BostnFrank How much to subscribe, & where do we send the cash?
Eric 816   Hi, Frank. Good questions. Subscription rates are as follows...
Eric 816   $29.95 for one year of the magazine. $69.95 is for one year of the
           disk...
Eric 816   and $99.90 is for one year of both. Send check/money order to Ross
           Lambert,...
Eric 816   PO Box 398, Pateros, WA, 98846, or we can take email orders with a
           credit...
Eric 816   card (send them to R.W.LAMBERT on GEnie or "Eric 816" here on
           AO)...
Eric 816   Let me cover what the disk contains quickly...
Eric 816   It will have all of the contents of that month's magazine, PLUS an
           addtional...
Eric 816   300k or so of IIgs source code, and 300k or so of 8 bit source
           code...
Eric 816   The magazine is a subset of the disk and many people have ordered
           just a disk
Eric 816   subscription. (done)
BostnFrank Disk are 5.25" or 3.5".
Eric 816   3.5" disks. (Only way we can fit everything on! <grin>)
BostnFrank Thanks.  ga
Eric 816   You bet. Thanks for asking.
AFA Gary J Thank you Eric.  It looks like our next question is from Coach. 
           GA Coach.
Coach101   How has the repsonse to 816 been (subscribers)?
Eric 816   Coach - so far, from what I understand, pretty good. We
           automatically...
Eric 816   converted all of the SApp, Reboot, and Znews subscribers over to
           8/16...
Eric 816   You'll probably want to talk to Ross when he gets here, though; he
           handles...
Eric 816   the subscriber base and can give you a more accurate answer.
           (done)
Coach101   thanks, ga
AFA Gary J I've been told that Ross is TRYING to be here.  He's having
AFA Gary J trouble getting online. :)
Eric 816   Okay... :)
AFA Gary J Ok, our next question is from Art.  GA, Art.
ArtR1      what do you mean by "gs source codes"?
Eric 816   Art - in addition to the contents of the magazine being on the
           disk, we're...
Eric 816   going to have other Apple IIgs-specific source code in a variety
           of languages
Eric 816   (ORCA/Pascal, APW C, TML Basic, to name a few). (ga)
AFA Gary J Did you have anything else to add, Art?
AFA Gary J If not, we'll move on to Frank's question.  GA, Frank.
BostnFrank How about for Merlin fans?
AFA Gary J Ooops.  Eric's been bumped now :)
AFL Marty  sigh
BostnFrank So, Gary, what else have you heard about 8/16?
BostnFrank :)
AFA Gary J Frank, from what I understand from the "Writer's Guideline" 
AFA Gary J information that Eric uploaded, Merlin 8, 16, and 16+ code is all
           being 
AFA Gary J requested.  
Eric 816   Sorry about that... the software just flaked out :(
AFA Gary J Ah...here's Eric now :)
BostnFrank neat!
BostnFrank ga
AFA Gary J Did you get that question, Eric?
AFA Gary J (I think I answered it :)
AFL Marty  You mean your modem disconnected. :)
Eric 816   Afraid not... could you repeat it? :)
BostnFrank Asked about Merlin material.
AFA Gary J Frank asked "How about Merlin fans?"
Eric 816   HOW ABOUT THOSE MERLIN FANS, HUH? :) I love Merlin - and use it
           all the time...
Eric 816   And 8/16 loves to publish Merlin source code.
Eric 816   (ga)
AFA Gary J Eric, perhaps you could take a moment to detail some of what you
           are looking
AFA Gary J for in articles, and I think that'll give a pretty good picture
           of what
AFA Gary J the magazine will be like.
AFA Gary J GA
Eric 816   Sure, Gary...
Eric 816   We're looking for articles on 'tricky stuff'. Tricky stuff is a
           nice generic...
Eric 816   title for several things: tricky stuff = new things with the
           latest system disk
Eric 816   (for example, how to use the Resource Manager). Tricky stuff =
           things that
Eric 816   just aren't explained very well in the current reference
           materials. Tricky
Eric 816   stuff = something you spent a while figuring out and you think
           others could...
Eric 816   learn from your experiences. Does that help? (ga)
AFA Gary J Yes :)
Eric 816   Let me mention one other thing... while Ross' old newsletters
           were...
Eric 816   seperated by the types of languages they used, 8/16 likes all kind
           of stuff...
Eric 816   in (as the title implies) in both 8 bit and 16 bit. We'll take
           articles for...
Eric 816   the IIgs half in almost any of the popular IIgs
           languages/assemblers (the only
Eric 816   exception is AC BASIC)... and for the 8 bit half, I believe we're
           accepting...
Eric 816   things in ZBASIC, Micol Advanced Basic (8-bit) and (of course!)
           AppleSloth.
AFA Gary J :)
Eric 816   If you have an idea for an article...
Eric 816   PLEASE don't hesitate to drop me or Jerry a line (depending on the
           number of...
Eric 816   bits, 16 or 8) and let us know about it. (ga)
AFA Gary J Thanks, Eric.  I see Frank has another question.  GA, Frank
BostnFrank Do you cover the range from expert to unlearnt?
Eric 816   Frank - we like for people to write their articles assuming that
           the...
Eric 816   reader has a working knowlege of the language at hand (for
           example, if the...
Eric 816   article was about Pascal, it would be assumed the read knew about
           WriteLn)...
Eric 816   the one exception to this rule is C: since it's such a new languag
           for most...
Eric 816   Apple II programmers, we welcome beginning articles covering the
           language...
Eric 816   and would like to see them! :) ga
BostnFrank Sounds rather well thought out.  ga
AFA Gary J Ok, Jeff has the next question.  GA, Jeff
AE Jeff    Perhaps you could mention who some of the contributors are?  And
           the subjects?
AE Jeff    ga
AFA Gary J Good question :)
Eric 816   Hi Jeff! (Have we met?) Sure, I'll talk a bit about
           contributors...
Eric 816   Since we're just starting 8/16, we haven't got any "big names"
           writing for
Eric 816   the _magazine_ yet. In The Sourceror's Apprentice, we had lots of
           great...
Eric 816   folks writing neat articles for us, such as Steve Lepisto and
           Steve Stephenson
Eric 816   (among others) and I expect they'll be writing for 8/16 as well.
           Even Glen...
Eric 816   Bredon said he'd write something for us. We do have some...
Eric 816   interesting deals 'in the works' but I can't really talk about
           them yet. ...
Eric 816   But I can say that I expect we'll have exciting, cutting-edge
           articles in...
Eric 816   future issues. (done)
AFA Gary J Sounds good, Eric.  Anything else, Jeff?
AE Jeff    What kind of subjects are coming up in the next issue?  Or can you
           say?  GA
Eric 816   In the first issue, we're going to have a little bit about
           animation...and...
Eric 816   probably a marvelous article about writing CDEVs (with a great
           example!)...
Eric 816   I'm in the process right now of deciding what will be the IIgs
           half for the...
Eric 816   first issue, so nothing is set in stone. Let me also mention that
           I am...
Eric 816   talking about the IIgs half - I'm not sure what Jerry has planned
           for the...
Eric 816   8 bit half. He usually has some neat surprises on hand, though. :)
           (ga)
AE Jeff    I'm done.
AFA Gary J Ok, Marty's up next.  GA, Marty
AFL Marty  On what information systems do you maintain an account?  What are
           your...
AFL Marty  screen names in case someone wants to contact you via EMail?
Eric 816   :P
Eric 816   I'm on AO as "A2Pro Eric" and on GEnie as "A2PRO.ERIC". (It's
           usually...
Eric 816   faster to send me a note on GEnie, but I do check AO about once a
           week)....
Eric 816   Jerry Kindall, the 8 bit editor, asks that you get in touch with
           him on...
Eric 816   GEnie as "A2.JERRY". Ross doesn't have an AO account (yet?) but
           his GEnie...
Eric 816   address is "R.W.LAMBERT". We also have a support area on GEnie in
           A2. (done)
AFL Marty  One more question...
AFL Marty  Have you considered doing a sort of sampler disk containing
           excerpts from...
AFL Marty  your magazine?  It might be nice to have one available online.
AFL Marty  (A teaser or sorts)
AFL Marty  or = of
Eric 816   Good idea, Marty! I don't know if Ross has considered it or not,
           but it...
Eric 816   sounds like a great idea to me. I'll pass the suggestion along to
           him and...
Eric 816   will be sure to upload it to ADV when we do it. (ga)
AFL Marty  (I'd love to see one done with HyperStudio :)
AFL Marty  done
AFA Gary J Ok, Frank's question is up next.  GA, Frank
BostnFrank What's your policy on advertising in 8/16?
Eric 816   Well...
Eric 816   Our rates are considerably less than Nibble, if you're looking to
           reach...
Eric 816   a market of programmers :)...
Eric 816   We've got some specials going on right now, in addition, for the
           first...
Eric 816   issue, which I'll go into if anyone is interested in details.
           There is one...
Eric 816   important thing that I did want to mention about advertising
           (thanks for...
Eric 816   reminding me)... if your company is looking for a programmer, we
           can...
Eric 816   give you a free half-page "Programmer Wanted" ad. And we HIGHLY
           urge you...
Eric 816   to take us up on the offer. The flip side of this coin is, if
           you're a...
Eric 816   programmer, we have free "situation wanted" ads. I started a new
           folder in...
Eric 816   the message area here on ADV (under "Miscellaneous Development
           Topics")...
Eric 816   with more details. GA
AFL FrankD Look who's back! :)
BostnFrank Are you Ads on disk as well as in the hard copy? ga
AFA Gary J Jerry made it back :)  Hi Jerry.
Eric 816   Frank - ads only in the magazine right now. I don't know if this
           is going to...
Eric 816   change in the future. ga
Eric 816   Hi Jerry!
BostnFrank Hi, Jerry!
AFL Marty  Jerry who?
A2 Jerry   Hi yall...
Tamira     Hi Jerry
AFL FrankD 8-bit Jerry. :)
A2 Jerry   Telenet is a wonderful animal.
Eric 816   Hehe
BostnFrank animal is the operative word.
AFL Marty  It's not the word I used :)
BostnFrank :)
AFA Gary J Jerry, could you give us some idea of what we might expect in the
           March
AFA Gary J issue from the 8 bit side of 8/16?
AFA Gary J (Eric's already told all his secrets :)
A2 Jerry   Well, we've got an interesting do-it-yourself hardware project
           involving...
A2 Jerry   biofeedback...
Eric 816   (see what I meant about exciting surprises? <grin>)
A2 Jerry   An article from Ross on ZBasic programming...
A2 Jerry   A couple of articles by yours truly detailing a super-compact
           BASIC line
A2 Jerry   editor that fits into page 3 of RAM, ...
A2 Jerry   and a nifty way to write relocatable assembly code using BRK...
A2 Jerry   and probably a few other things.
A2 Jerry   GA
AFA Gary J Thanks, Jerry.  Did you want to comment, Frank?
BostnFrank Apple II Biofeedback... brings new meaning to "user friendly!"
BostnFrank ga
AFA Gary J Ok, well our hour is up this evening, which brings the "official"
           side of this
AFA Gary J meeting to a close, but everyone is certainly welcome to stay
           around and chat
AFA Gary J as long as they'd like afterward.  I'd like to thank our guests
           for attending,
AFA Gary J and I'm looking forward to seeing the fruits of their labors here
           in a month
AFA Gary J or so!  Thank you.
Eric 816   Thanks a lot Gary!
A2 Jerry   Ouch!  Is it only a month?  Oh no.... B)
Eric 816   And thanks everyone else for attending!
AFA Gary J (PROTOCOL off)
AFA Gary J :)
AFA Gary J Yes, thank you for attending.
AFL FrankD The magazine sounds like a real winner!
Eric 816   Soooooo....... who's going to write articles for us? :)
BostnFrank Jerry, Eric:  Let's see, that'll be your April 1st issue, right?
A2 Jerry   Hmmm.  I can think of several people in this room who could write
           articles...
A2 Jerry   for us...
A2 Jerry   Especially on the 8-bit side.  I'm a real advocate of 8-bit Apples
           and I'm
A2 Jerry   really looking forward to a GOOD exchange of NEW 8-bit info.
Eric 816   I can see a few potential IIgs authors too... I urge _everyone_ to
           download...
Eric 816   the Writer's Guidelines from the library.
A2 Jerry   Tom, yeah, that means I can actually get something out of the 16
           half!
A2 Jerry   In fact, I'm getting a IIgs in order to be able to use the 16-bit
           stuff...
AFA Gary J Eric, are you (Ariel) offering any kind of trial subscription? 
           Like buy the
AFA Gary J first issue with the option of picking up the year's
           subscription? 
Eric 816   Gary - I believe we are but I'm afraid I don't have the details
           here. You...
Eric 816   might want to give Ross a ring at (509) 923-2249.
Eric 816   Jerry - :)
AFA Gary J Ok, thanks.
