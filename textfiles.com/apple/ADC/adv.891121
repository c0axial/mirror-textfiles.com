Topic:  Apple IIGS System Software 5.0.2
Forum Leader:  Dave Sugar  (AFL Dyfet)

AFL Dyfet  Welcome to the Apple II Development Forum.  Tonight's topic is
           System Software 5.0.2
AFL Dyfet  We'll be using PROTOCOL this evening, so if you have a question,
           type a "?"
AFL Dyfet  on a line by itself, or if you have a comment on the current
           topic, type a "!"
AFL Dyfet  on a line by itself.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Mac Hater, you have the floor now :)
Mac Hater  Is 5.03 coming out soon?  There are still a few bugs in 5.02
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   Apple has announced no plans for any system software beyond 5.0.2.
            (Of course, they've said...
Matt DTS   ...there will *be* some, but no specifics.)  GA.
Mac Hater  Apple does recognize the bugs though, right?  done 
AFL Dyfet  I am sure that DTS continues to catalog any new bug reports as
           before, and so I
AFL Dyfet  am sure that they are at least fully aware of what problems may
           exist.
Mac Hater  sounds good.  ga
AFL Dyfet  I would add that if anyone does have any bugs to report with
           System Software
AFL Dyfet  5.02, they should be contacting Apple.  Never assume all bugs are
           already
AFL Dyfet  known by them :).
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe that the next question is from Dwight.  You have
           the floor now.
DwightW1   we still are unable to hook to a scanner with the new GS/OS
           software? ga.
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   Actually, it's only with 5.0 and later that you *can* hook a
           scanner up; previous versions of the
Matt DTS   SCSI drivers would not recognize things other than hard disks or
           CD-ROMs.  However, Apple has not
Matt DTS   supplied a scanner driver at this point.  (But it is now possible
           to write one.)
Matt DTS   5.0.2 has no new features over 5.0.  It is merely a maintenance
           release.  See GS/OS Technical Note #1
Matt DTS   for all the details.  GA.
DwightW1   i see... now for the driver..........
DwightW1   ga
AFL Dyfet  Okay, I believe our next question is from GS Matt..GA Matt...
GS Matt    Are there any plans to make the GS tools re-entrant in upcoming
           versions...
GS Matt    ...to allow programs like MultiFinder GS to be written?  ga
AFL Dyfet  Strange this would be brought up...GA Matt...I also have a few
           comments to add.
Matt DTS   Not that anything I say *would* discourage speculation <sigh>, but
           Apple people really can't...
Matt DTS   ...comment on this one way or another, because either way would
           imply that we are or aren't going
Matt DTS   to do something.  GA.
AFL Dyfet  GA Dave...
Dave Lyons I can't comment about future plans either, but I should note
           that
Dave Lyons a MultiFinder sort of thing does not require reentrancy of the
           usual
Dave Lyons sort (the kind you have to worry about w/ toolbox calls during
           interrupts).   ga
AFL Dyfet  To further elaborate on Dave's comments, re-entrancy itself is NOT
           a real
AFL Dyfet  limitation to multi-tasking, in general.  It only represents a
           slight
AFL Dyfet  'challenge' to overcome.  I was, and may still, be putting up a
           short series of
AFL Dyfet  articles related to multi-tasking within the GS environment as it
           exists
AFL Dyfet  today.
GS Matt    Okay guys...(dreams of MultiFinder GS and Outline Fonts in System
           6.0.)...ga!
AFL Dyfet  Okay, does anyone else have any questions or comments at this
           point?  That
AFL Dyfet  Queue is looking awfully empty...
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Windrider, GA, you have the floor now.
Windrider5 for the novice .. could you define re-entrancy and multi-tasking
AFL Dyfet  Multi-tasking means, in the simplest sense, that your machine
           would be doing
AFL Dyfet  two or more things at the same time.  In some operating systems,
           for example,
AFL Dyfet  the user can run multiple applications simulataneously, with
           system resources
AFL Dyfet  and CPU time devided up for each running application.  Maybe Coach
           would do
AFL Dyfet  better at explaining this :)..GA Coach...
Coach101   Chicken :) ...
AFL Dyfet  :)
Coach101   Well from a large system (hold the boos) point of view there is a
           very
Coach101   fine line between multi-tasking and timesharing.  But both (in a
           single
Coach101   cpu) system involve, as Dyfet said, having the system working on
           more than
Coach101   one task "sort-of" simultaneously.  With a single CPU the machine
           is, at
Coach101   any finite instant in time, working on only one task.  But if the
           machine
Coach101   switches tasks fast enough and if one of the tasks has a lot of
           idle
Coach101   time (like the time it takes a user to type, or think of what to
           type
Coach101   or click) then the illusion of the machine doing two things at
           once is
Coach101   given to the user.   ....   Re-entrancy...   
Coach101   When you write a subroutine/function/procedure you will store
           various
Coach101   quantities in various locations.  Now, if your code were to be
           re-entered,
Coach101   which means while you are executing your code the system switches
           tasks
Coach101   and enters your code again at the beginning, then you code "could"
           get
Coach101   confused as to the value of a variable; like, which incarnation of
           the
Coach101   variable MyIndex is to be used.  This is a particular problem
           with
Coach101   "static" variables and almost never a problem with auto variables.
            Here
Coach101   again there is a fine line between the definitions of "re-entrant"
           and
Coach101   "recursive".  Recursive means that a function/procedure is allowed
           to call
Coach101   itself (think of a "factorial" function for a good example). 
           Re-entrancy
Coach101   means that the function can be re-entered at any time and from
           anywhere...
Coach101   I hope I was not too wordy and helped with my explanation....  
           ga
AFL Dyfet  That is a very good explanation, Coach :)...Okay, I see the Queue
           is once
AFL Dyfet  again empty, and just waiting for more comments or questions :)
Coach101   Yeah, my fingers are all warmed up now too  :)
AFA Gary J :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Coach, you have the floor now...
Coach101   Lets see if I can phrase this such that Matt will not have to hit
           his
Coach101   macro about unannounced products, ideas, etc....
Coach101   Apple has given us 5.0 (and its derivatives) which was a major
           departure
Coach101   and improvement over P16 and GS/OS 4.0.  If I draw a parallel to
           the
Coach101   ProDos-8 environment (where *nothing* other than fixes is done),
           would it be
Coach101   safe to assume that GS/OS has not yet reached that plateau.  Put
           another
Coach101   way, should one expect that some more major software things are a
           distinct
Coach101   possibility in the future?   ga
AFL Dyfet  There have been a number of things hinted at in recent Apple II
           Technotes
AFL Dyfet  already, such as a desire to produce communication drivers...I see
           Matt would
AFL Dyfet  like to add some comments, GA Matt :)
Matt DTS   1)  GS/OS is logically much more extensible (through FSTs and
           drivers) than P8 ever was.
Matt DTS   2)  P8 is also a special case.  It is occupying nearly all the
           memory it has reserved in the 64K
Matt DTS   space, and adding new features would be difficult.  GS/OS does not
           have this problem yet, as long as
Matt DTS   Apple is willing to make future versions require a larger base
           system if necessary.
Matt DTS   I don't think the IIgs System Software is at a point where no more
           changes *can* be made without
Matt DTS   serious problems, which is where ProDOS 8 currently sits.  GA.
Coach101   Thank you...
AFA Gary J there's a safe answer  :)
Coach101   But always read between the lines....   He could have said.....
AFL Dyfet  One can get a strong indication as to some areas that Apple has
           had some
AFL Dyfet  interest in future enhancements from things they have said and
           published in
AFL Dyfet  tech notes and other sources.
AFA Gary J Yes.  Reading between the lines.. the future of the Apple II
           looks bright.
AFL Dyfet  GA Coach...you have the floor again...
Coach101   Apple is currently pushing both CD-Rom and Object Oriented
           Programming
Coach101   pretty heavy in the Mac area.  The CD-Rom player will also work on
           the
Matt DTS   !
Coach101   II-GS.  Two questions...   1) Is Apple going to pursue the OOP
           approach
Coach101   on the II-GS (like provide tools) and 2) has Apple seen any signs
           of
Coach101   commercial CD-Rom offerings for the II line yet...   ga
AFL Dyfet  GA Matt...
Matt DTS   Apple is very interested in hearing from developers about what
           kind of object-oriented tools they'd
Matt DTS   like to see.  We obviously believe OOP to be the wave of the
           future for most programming, but how
Matt DTS   that applies to the Apple II depends on the needs of our
           developers and their capabilities to use
Matt DTS   the OOP tools to produce creative and inventive products.  Please
           send your comments to Developer
Matt DTS   Tools at the address listed in the back of the APW or MPW IIgs
           manuals.
Matt DTS   2)  I personally have not seen Apple II-specific CD-ROM products;
           I imagine this is largely due to
Matt DTS   the 8-bit limitation of four partitions of 32 MB each (ProDOS). 
           Using a different file system makes
Matt DTS   it *IIgs* specific, which is a smaller market.  However, Apple
           does have information on a starter
Matt DTS   kit for all developers (Apple II included) which can get your
           product burned into 100 CD-ROMs
Matt DTS   including mastering, for $1500.  Contact AIIDTS through normal
           channels for more information.  GA.
AFL Dyfet  Okay, thank you Matt..GA Coach...
Coach101   I sae that price Matt and was very IMPRESSED!  One question
           though, was
Coach101   how much of a deal it was.  That is, not saying that Apple was not
           giving
Coach101   the developer a good deal, but what kind of volume would one have
           to
Coach101   have in order to get prices like that on their own...   If you
           know?  ga
Matt DTS   I really can't answer that; I have no idea.  The evangelists for
           multimedia also do a lot of Apple II
Matt DTS   work and they put together the package for our developers; they
           really need to answer that.  I
Matt DTS   think the prices for volumes of 1,000 are less are *fairly*
           reasonable, but I can't quote numbers.  GA
Coach101   Thanks...
AFL Dyfet  Okay, are there any further comments on Coach's question?
DwightW1   (i'm not sure i understood it... can it be rephrased?
Coach101   The question or the answer  :)
DwightW1   the question please :)... 
Matt DTS   (We only have a few minutes left - let someone else rephrase it! 
           :)
AFA Gary J heheh
Matt DTS   <just kidding, coach...>
Coach101   Matt is always good at being terse and correct.  GA Matt :)
AFL Dyfet  :)
Coach101   I do it via FlashNote
Chaos 89   Can you give a short explanation of OOP?
Matt DTS   I don't think there is a short explanation of OOP.  :)
AFL Dyfet  Okay, Chaos, I see you also have a question not very easy to
           explain in a quick
AFL Dyfet  summary :)...Well, OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is more a
           different way
AFL Dyfet  of approaching programming problems than anything else.  It
           involves the idea
AFL Dyfet  ...the idea that maybe I will be saved by another fine explanation
           from Coach:)
AFA Gary J :)
Coach101   But we are out of time....
DwightW1   (thanks coach101)
AFA Gary J nah.. :)
AFL Dyfet  Now, Coach, that would be the easy way out :)....Seriously,
           perhaps someone
Coach101   Matt and Dave will probably have to correct me here since I am not
           all
Coach101   that up on OOP, but....
AFL Dyfet  knows of a good book to introduce one to OOP...
Coach101   Nope....  Thats a lot like trying to explain HyperCard in a
           paragraph  ...
Rowdy2     How about Borland's Turbo Pascal Object Oriented Programming
           Guide?  :)
AFA Gary J There's a book on OOP for the Macintosh.. (in APDA)
AFL Dyfet  I would suggest, Chaos, that you try posting that question in of
           the message
AFL Dyfet  forums, and let people respond there, where they will have more
           time and space
AFA Gary J APDA = APDAlog
AFL Dyfet  for a helpful explanation.
Chaos 89   Thanks
Coach101   Maybe we should have an OOP night to gather opinions and
           comments....
AFL Dyfet  That is an interesting idea, also, Coach...
AFL Dyfet  Okay, do we have any more questions or comments for tonight?
Coach101   Its kind of boring when you cant ask questions that will cause
           Matt
Coach101   to answer "summer", or "winter", or   :)
AFA Gary J ..to use his macro?
AFL Dyfet  :)
Dave Lyons I can!
Dave Lyons Matt...what season comes after spring but before fall?
AFA Gary J heheh
Matt DTS   Baseball season.
AFL Dyfet  :)
AFA Gary J :)
