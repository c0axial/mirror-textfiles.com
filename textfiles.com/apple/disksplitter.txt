          DISK SPLITTER 2.5
          WRITTEN BY THE STACK
          MODS BY THE ATOM

THIS IS THE SAME AS DISK SPLITTER 2.01
EXCEPT YOU CAN NOW NAME THE PARTS YOU
WANT TO SPLIT. WHEN YOU FIRST RUN DS2.5
IT WILL ASK YOU FOR A NAME. IT HAS TO
BE 5 CHARACTERS OR LESS. DISK SPLITTER
WILL THEN USE THIS NAME INSTEAD OF
]PART TO SPLIT OR MERGE. IF YOU ENTER
A NAME LESS THAN 5 CHARACTERS SUCH AS
"MOE", IT WOULD CREATE THE FILES
]MAP,MOE  1,MOE  2,ETC. THE IMBEDED
SPACES ARE NORMAL. TO MERGE THIS, YOU
NEED ONLY TYPE MOE AS THE NAME, DS2.5
WILL AUTOMATICALLY INSERT THE EXTRA
SPACES.
