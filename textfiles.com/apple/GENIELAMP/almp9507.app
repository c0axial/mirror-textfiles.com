               >>> "WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY, AND HE IS US" <<<
               """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     As long as there has been science fiction, there have been warnings 
about how computers will control us or destroy us.  They adjust all data so 
that it fits the database, which is how the average North American ended up 
with 2.3 children.  They blindly follow instructions regardless of context, 
which is why a grammar checker complains about the repetition in the 
opening paragraph of Dickens's _A Tale of Two Cities_.

     Well, relax.  The good news is that computers are not going to 
pigeonhole us into either misery or oblivion.  The bad news is that we 
humans are doing it to ourselves... or, more likely, to one another.  The 
tendency of the computer to reduce everything to ones and zeroes means 
nothing compared to the eagerness with which some of grasp a tool that only 
deals with ones and zeroes.

     For example:  I admit, with some shame, that I use a major credit 
card.  About a year ago, the bank that issued the card gave me the capacity 
to use any convenient telephone to check my last five transactions.  I 
heartily dislike the idea, which strikes me as inviting trouble.  Or hasn't 
anyone at either the bank or the credit company realized that I'm not the 
only one in the world with access to a phone, and therefore with access to 
my last five transactions?

     Here is where I made my mistake:  I called up the bank to get them to 
disable this terrific feature.

     I explained my request and--here's where I went wrong--my potential 
problem to the person on the other end of the phone.  She thought I was 
complaining about a merchant to whom I had unwisely given my credit card 
number.  I rephrased the problem.  She still thought I was complaining 
about a merchant.  I rerephrased the problems.  She thought I was 
complaining about a hypothetical merchant.  Eventually, she passed me on to 
her supervisor.

     Needless to say, I had to start at square one, explaining my concern 
from scratch.  The supervisor thought I was complaining about a merchant.  
So I rephrased the problem.  The supervisor thought I was complaining about 
a merchant....

     "Then said I, Lord, how long?  And he answered, Until the cities be 
wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be 
utterly desolate."  [Isaiah 6:11]

     It took me three different people, almost an hour of my time, and 
more frustration than I care to admit to finally get the message across.  
In the end, I had to raise my voice slightly, interrupt the zombie-like 
speech, and demand, "Listen to me.  Listen to what I am saying."

     The brains of these three people were so used to dealing with maybe 
five basic consumer complaints that they routed all requests into one of 
the five areas.  Now, just possibly the poor drones who answer the phones 
all day can be excused this atrophy of the little grey cells.  Possibly.  
But not their supervisor, and most definitely not the supervisor's 
supervisor.

     In the end, I did convey to the Level 2 supervisor just what the heck 
I wanted.  She clearly thought I was a crank for refusing such a convenient 
service, but she allowed as how she could place what she called a "phone 
block" on my card... meaning that if I wanted to pay my credit card bill, I 
could no longer do it over the phone.

     What's more, she did place that block, and she did it the first time 
I asked for it.  I know for certain that she did it, because all of a 
sudden, merchants were telling me that they couldn't accept my credit card.  
It seems the phone block that prevented others from abusing my credit card 
also prevented certain merchants from accepting my credit card.  
(Incredibly, the alleged professionals who wrote and installed the credit 
card company's software hadn't checked for such a conflict.)  I may be 
flattering myself, but this seems to me to indicate that I was the very 
first person to request a phone block.

     By the time my credit card company straightened out the problem, I 
was well on the way to collecting a second example of how some people are 
good at dealing only with the same scenario, and reject any scenario they 
haven't prepared themselves for.

     My doctor had sent me to a specialist, and that very busy, harried 
specialist, had instructed me to call him if I had certain symptoms before 
our next appointment.  So, like the naif I am, I did call him when the 
feared symptoms grabbed hold of me and shook me like a milkshake.

     The receptionist refused--absolutely refused--to put me through to 
the specialist.  If I was in extreme pain, go to emergency.  If I was not 
in extreme pain, consult my physician.  What I was absolutely not supposed 
to do, according to the receptionist, was bother the specialist.

     Now, I understand that people do make nuisances of themselves, 
wasting the time of an overworked medical specialist when protocol demands 
that a G.P. make a referral.  I would estimate that the receptionist had 
already had to deal with a hundred such nuisances that week.  What troubles 
me is that she was no longer capable of listening.  Anyone who wants to 
turn this into a treatise on overwork--and it's not a bad idea--is invited 
to write his or her own editorial.  I still find it chilling how readily 
people tend to assume that what they're hearing is what they're used to 
hearing.

     Most data base programmers make the assumptions that the data is 
going to be consistent.  Real life isn't consistent.  It's not merely that 
humans aren't consistent, it's that what happens to humans is not 
consistent.  Any program that forces you to fit the environment to the 
computer, rather than the other way around, is a third-rate program.

     The widespread use of computers in today's work-world isn't the 
problem.  It's just the symptom.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Last month, I tipped you off that you could use Lynx to read Usenet 
newsgroup such as comp.sys.apple2, merely by visiting the links on Nathan 
Mates's home page.  Well, you can, and it's a fairly non-threatening way of 
doing it, too.

     However, for those of you who want to read comp.sys.apple2 without 
bothering Nathan, it's quite simple.  Just press G to go to a specific 
place, and instead of typing something that begins with "http://", just 
type:

     news:comp.sys.apple2

and you'll be taken to comp.sys.apple2.  It will also work with other 
newsgroups, such as comp.sys.apple2.comm, comp.sys.apple2.gno, 
comp.sys.apple2.marketplace, comp.sys.apple2.programmer, 
comp.sys.apple2.usergroups, comp.binaries.apple2, comp.sources.apple2, and 
alt.emulators.ibmpc.apple2.

DEADEYE DRIVES   Hehehe, that reminds me of an incident that happened to me 
""""""""""""""   back when I was still working at Softdisk.

     A year or so ago, we discovered a very serious bug after we'd 
mastered and duplicated an issue, but before it had been mailed out.  
Unfortunately, due to the schedules of some of the larger Softdisk 
products, we couldn't reduplicate with the big automatic machines, so we 
had to resort to the old manual disk duplicators (two drives, can duplicate 
two disks at a time, manual eject button, have to be hand fed).

     Several people split up the long process of reduplicating all the 
Softdisk G-S disks with these old machines, and I did my part as well.  I 
had a couple of disk duplicators sitting on my desk, hooked up to a spare 
power strip (on the floor).  Unfortunately, one of the duplicators had an 
especially strong ejection spring, which shot disks out like toast.

     A one in a million shot:  I pressed the ejection button, the disk 
ejected (but I missed stopping it), it flew into a perfect arc down onto 
the power strip, hitting the button at just the right angle to shut off the 
duplicating machines.

     Fortunately I didn't hook my computers up to the same power strip! :)

     Actually it takes bad management to concentrate on that 15%.  If you 
do, you'll be out of business quicker than you can sneeze.  In order to 
survive in the business world, you have to look for opportunity.  I think 
the Ferrengi have something in the rules of acquisition about that.  In 
order for QC to continue to support the Apple II, Quality must first 
survive and thrive.  Otherwise, the alternative is that we're not here.  
Time marches on, the world changes and QC must react to those changes.

     The good news is that QC at no time even considered dropping any of 
its popular products.  Appleworks, timeout, Six Pack, System 6, Q drives, 
Memory cards and many third party educational products we have.  We did 
drop products that did not sell.  These were not a personal thing.  We 
needed the space for that other 85% of our business.   In business, you 
learn about a dollar per foot formula that calculates just how much space 
you can spend on a product.  If we don't have a product, just call us or 
email me.  I'll tell you where to find it or at least give you a good path 
to where to get whatever it is you're looking for.

     We still support the Apple II on our telephones, here on Genie, 
Eworld, the internet, America Online and there are Apple II sections on 
theLINQ.

     Please feel free to list the promises and I'll be glad to answer

     Uncle!  We learned one important lesson.  Never try to handle a 
subscription base the size of II Alive if it's not your primary business.  
We just didn't have the knowledge, the time, and the resources to continue 
with II Alive and I personally will miss the fun I had writing for it.

     This is mostly because the second sight card is late.  We don't have 
it yet.  AppleWorks GS tought us to wait and see something before we go 
right ahead and market it.  When it's released, I'm sure it will have 
plenty of space.  After all, it's a neat thing that frees you from the 
shackles of the IIGS monitor.

     I too used Appleworks 3 since the first day it came out.  I bought 
Appleworks GS before I had a GS.  Then I got AppleWorks 4 when it was 
Quadriga and Appleworks 5 when it was Narnia.  You never truly know what 
it's like on the mountain until you leave the valley.  Trust me, without 
Appleworks 5, you're missing a lot.

FREE IIC UPGRADE DISAPPEARS   Some bad news in IIc land, I'm afraid.  My
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   local dealer (Albany, NY) showed me a msg 
from Cupertino - Apple will no longer do the //c logic board swap for free, 
effective May 3, 1995.

     I'm now sitting with a ROM 01 //c and not happy, but I encourage 
people to appreciate the length of time that Apple _did_ support this free 
upgrade.  I have had 4 //c's upgraded over the years for free  over a 8-9 
year period.  Pretty good service.  The free lunch had to end sometime :(

PATCHES FOR PC TRANSPORTER   I thought some of you PCT users might be 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   interested in some of my latest patches to the 
PCT software.  Note:  These have only been tested a little.  Use at your 
own risk.  Let me know what you think.  These are only good for PCT 
software version 2.0.4 or 2.0.5.  As many of you know there is really no 
difference between the two.  Just different versions of ProDOS to fix clock 
problems.  Just Preferred Computing (what an arrogant name, I don't prefer 
them!) and AE were not honest about this.  I'm glad they are gone!  
Perferred did not offer to give me my money back, BTW.

     All patches are applied to the file AEPC.SYSTEM.  You will need a 
block editor that will follow files and show you the position relative to 
the beginning of the file.

     This first patch was listed earlier but I thought I'd post it again.  
It makes the PCT control panel show up in bright text.  Great for those dim 
monitors.

Start at Byte      Bytes there
                   Replace with

$1bba:             07
                   0f

     Short patch, eh?

     The next two patches are great for GS users with extended keyboards.

     This patch resets the keyboard lights on exit.  So that your Scroll 
Lock, Num Lock, and Caps Lock lights, if on at exit, will not stay on when 
you leave the PCT software.  This patch simply intercepts the exit routine 
and makes a call within the PCT software that tells it to clear all the 
keyboard lights.  I have a init for caps lock light for ROM 01 GS users 
that I hope to release in the near future that is PCT aware.  If you've 
ever tried other caps lock inits they tend to goof up the scroll lock and 
num lock lights, mine does not.  My init is also fast in that it will not 
interfere with Apple ][ telecom programs.  Encourage me!

     This final patch swaps the function of the Open-Apple (Command) and 
Solid (Option) keys on the keyboard.  Although this patch can be used by GS 
users without an extended keyboard.  Its usefulness comes in the fact that 
(at least my) extended keyboard's option key is also labeled "ALT".  The 
PCT used the Open-Apple key for the ALT key.  This patch fixes this. It 
also offers the change in the labeling of the keyboard layout map in the 
PCT control panel.  I wish I could edit it to show a real extended 
keyboard.

labeling changed.

                      44

     If there are any other patches you would like to suggest I'd like to 
hear them.  I don't know if I can do all of them though, but I might give 
it a try.  One I'd like to see is the PC time syncing with secs. from the 
GS side.  However that would requiring fixing the clock driver on the PC 
side and I don't know if I can pull that off!  Currently the PCT gets the 
time with a ProDOS GET_TIME call.  This only supports Year, month, date, 
hours, and minutes, no seconds!

Happy PCing!

MAC SERVER?  YOU DON'T NEED ANY STINKIN'...   I can't help but mention that 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   you do _NOT_ need a Mac to 
function as a server for this purpose.  A programmer can program a GS to 
act as a special server to process the specific functions of your point of 
sale application.

     I say this with certainty because I know someone who had created a 
professional, custom, networked database entirely of GSes using nothing but 
AppleTalk connections!  (It was highly impressive.)  He wrote the program 
in two parts:  clients, and a server.  The server collected data from the 
clients and generated reports.  The clients queried the workers for sales 
information.  Like I said, it was a custom application and could not be 
repurposed without considerable reprogramming.

TRANSWARP IIE HELP   I recently got a transwarp for my //e also.  No 
""""""""""""""""""   manual.  Someone sent me some nice instructions for 
how to set the two switch groups.  But the thing still drops into the 
monitor if I try to boot from the hard disk  (set in slot 7).  Is there 
something I haveto do different if uI use the hard drive. If I take it out 
the Transwarp works good. But with the HD (some kind of off brand mac drive 
SCSI) it crashes.  If I try to boot slot 6 or 5 after doing a 
control-reset, the prodos screen comes up, them the computer freezes.  So 
what gives?

>>>>>   I wouldn't know unless you told me your setup.  But let's save some
"""""   time.  Here are all the details you'll probably need.

     You can put the TW card in slot 3 (yes, finally a use for slot 3!)

     Block 1 is for Memory cards, of the bank switch type.  If you have 
any of these kind of cards in a slot (rare) OPEN that switch (push it 
down).  If you use a RamWorks in the aux slot (and if you don't, get one!) 
the TW will accelerate all programs in memory :)  Switch 8 on both blocks 1 
and 2 should be OPEN for full TW speed (leave them there).

     Block 2 is for peripheral cards, and here is where the fun begins.  
Switches 1 to 7 correspond to your slots.  Any empty slots (no cards) 
should be CLOSED.  Slot 3 (where the TW should be) should be CLOSED.

     If you have a serial interface card (like a Super Serial card for 
printer or modem), that slot should be OPEN.  Parallel interface cards can 
be CLOSED for maximium speed.  Your SCSI Hard Drive slot (7) should be 
CLOSED for maximum speed.  Do you have an Apple Hi Speed SCSI card?

     I ran this configuration with DMA on and had no problems until I 
added a PCTransporter card.  Then I had to turm DMA on the SCSI card OFF.  
That may be your problem, since the TW uses it's own DMA.

     You can change speeds (for games, etc) by running these simple basic 
programs.

     First, make a subdirectory named SPEED.

     Get into BASIC and make the following programs -

          NEW
          10 REM START 1 MHZ SPEED
          20 POKE 49268,1
          30 END

     LIST the input to make sure it is okay, and then save it as START.1MHZ

     Then make this one -

          NEW
          10 REM START 3 MHZ SPEED
          20 POKE 49268,0
          30 END

     Save as START.3MHZ

     You can also make this one, if you feel you will ever need it.  Just 
remember that if you use this, you will have to ReBoot to get the TW back 
into operation.

          NEW
          10 REM DISABLE TRANSWARP
          20 POKE 49268,3
          30 END

     Save as DISBLE.TW

     Now you should have these 3 basic programs under /H?/SPEED/ 
available- (Where /H? is the name of your HD Partition.)

     START.1MHZ
     START.3MHZ
     DISABLE.TW

Simply run the desired choice, and there you go!

these patches must not change any of the functionality of 6.0.1. If there 
are new features added, it will be up to individual software writers to use 
them or not (much like the new features that were added in 6.0.1.)  If a 
new piece of software requires the Brutal Deluxe update, it should ship 
with the patch program since this will obviously not be an official Apple 
Comp. update.

     Whether their update is "official" or not is irrelevant.  If it works 
and it's useful, people will use it.  There have been quite a few 
unofficial patches that have been endorsed by the Apple IIgs community.  
FixFontMgr is a good example.  It is included in the latest version of 
Pointless, and many people consider it a mandatory patch.  II Scroll is 
unofficial but it's so darned useful that many people can't live without 
it.  If Brutal Deluxe can create more of these types of improvements,

"""""   has done a lot of low-level work, who wouldn't trust Brutal Deluxe 
to rewrite an OS.

     I feel so strongly about this, I might design code to NOT work under 
it.  Let me hasten to add that there are programmers here I would trust to 
do such a project.  The BD folks just aren't in that lot.

     A lot of these European programs don't even work right between ROM 
01's and ROM 3's.  That speaks volumes to me about the kind of programming 
underlying it all.

     Also, I distrust many of these programs that mess illegally with my 
Battery RAM.  Quite simply, I don't see the right kind of mindset in these 
types of programmers to do an OS properly, and I don't want a poorly-done 
OS to kill the GS market by dividing it between the "good OS" and "new OS" 
camps.

     I've written SEVERAL bug-patches for the GS (I've lost count of the 
exact number; many of them were done at Softdisk, of course, but some were 
done before that).  I don't have problems with bug-patch add-ons, but 
presuming to rewrite the OS is quite a different matter.  Also, I know how 
much time and effort _I_ go to to make my patch programs 100% compatible; 
it's exhaustive and methodical work.  I haven't seen that kind of work 
ethic in many other programmers.

     I think that if people have concerns about Brutal Deluxe's proposed

     (San Rafael, CA. June 7, 1995)  Shareware Solutions II, a general 
interest bi-monthly newsletter devoted to the Apple II computer, is pleased 
to announce that it is now the exclusive distributor of "The A+ Home 
Organizer."

     Created by Dr Cynthia Field, "The A+ Home Organizer" is a collection 
of AppleWorks GS templates designed to assist you in organizing your 
personal and family information.  There's a credit card registry, a 
personal balance sheet that allows you to create a statement of net worth, 
several mortgage related templates that will help you through the maze of 
refinancing your home, a vacation planner, a template to create address 
labels, a template that lets you enter information about friends and family 
and that serves as a reminder for important dates, a medical authorization 
form, a home inventory worksheet, and a template that tracks the details of 
your financial life.  All documentation is provided on disk.

     Originally available through inCider/A+ Magazine for $29.95, 
Shareware Solutions II is making "The A+ Home Organizer" available for only 
$5.  There are no additional charges for shipping and handling, and air 
mail delivery to anywhere in the world is included as part of the $5 cost.  
Despite its low cost, "The A+ Home Organizer" is not freeware, shareware or 
public domain; it is professionally created commercial software for the 
Apple IIGS.

     In order to use these templates, you MUST own AppleWorks GS.

     Shareware Solutions II can accept checks or money orders, in US 
dollars (or drawn on a US account) and made payable to "Joe Kohn."  Sorry, 
but no credit cards or school purchase orders can be accepted.

SCRIPT-CENTRAL BACK ISSUES   I've dropped a few hints concerning a few of 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   the projects that Shareware Solutions II has 
on tap...

     HangTime has secured the copyrights to the excellent HyperCard based 
Script-Central magazine-on-disk that he edited/created for ICON.  HangTime 
and I have reached an agreement for Shareware Solutions II to distribute 
those, once again.

     There's a lot that needs to be done before all those back issues will 
become available once again.  In no particular order....

     1) We need to set a price for each issue and we need to determine a 
price for the entire collection.

     2) I need to go through all 20+ issues and re-acquaint myself with 
them in order to be able to describe what's contained on each issue.

     3) I do not yet have a complete set of disks.

     So, in the midst of preparing the next issue of SSII, I have some 
other time consuming tasks.  I imagine that we'll be able to set an 
equitable price in the next few weeks, so that should be included in the 
next issue.

     I'd just thought you'd want to know...

IIGS MS-DOS UTILITIES   Recently I spoke via internet mail with Peter 
"""""""""""""""""""""   Watson.  One of the things I asked was if he 
planned on releasing a "desktop version" of his MSDOS Utilities.  Here is 
his reply:

          Re: The "desktop version".  I have started designing it, 
       but time is a real issue.  It will probably be an NDA, which 
       means I won't try to implement some of the bells and whistles 
       that would be easy in a full application.  On the other hand, 
       you will be able to transfer files from within any other 
       application, which is as close as we're going to get to a 
       "real" MSDOS FST. 

     I have no idea when it might be available, but he _is_ working on it!

STATE OF FAXINATION   As near as I can tell, we have one problem where the 
"""""""""""""""""""   program sometimes doesn't know that it's supposed to 
turn on the Print Manager; one where the Finder is doing screen updates and 
we have a Resource Manager bug; and one where a certain model of Zoom modem 
doesn't handle the ends of pages the same way that everybody else does, and 
therefore FAXination quits after sending one page. 

     Most of our users seem to be pretty happy with the last version 
(v0.1.6) so I'll release another after I check out the fixes for the 
problems mentioned above.  Then there are a couple of features that need to 
be added, and a couple of suggestions on making things a bit easier to deal 
with, and I will finally be able to declare Version 1.0!

     Yes, fax software is a *colossal* pain, but where would the fun be if 
it was easy? :)  Have I mentioned today that I hate modems?

     Yesterday at about 6:30 I posted a message in A2 about the problems I 
was having with accessing my P8 programs.  It turns out that the problem 
was my RamFast mapping.  Everything is back to normal and I am ever so 
grateful for all the help.  In my desperation I also posted the same 
message on Usenet.comp.sys.apple2.   In A2 I had 3 suggestions within a 
couple of hours and a solution within 24 hours.  On the famous Intenet I 
had not responses with the first 24 hours, none.  Now if I ever needed 
(which I don't) any encouragement to stay on GEnie I just got it.  To me it 
makes very short work of the discussion in Usenet.comp.sys.apple2 about the 
costs and usefulness of GEnie.  Once again thanks to all.

                >>> VIRTUALLY REAL, AND REALLY VIRTUAL <<<
                """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
          Copyright (c) 1995 By Al Fasoldt.  All rights reserved.
 
     I was adjusting the sound level of my virtual CD player the other day 
when I suddenly realized how strange this act would have seemed a few years 
ago.

     But "virtual" is the buzzword of the mid-'90s for computer users, so 
no one who has mastered a modern personal computer is likely to find 
anything strange in what I was doing.

     I turned a knob in the middle of my computer screen.  Not a real 
knob, of course -- that would really have messed up the display when I was 
doing my word processing.  It was a virtual knob.

     Then I pushed the "pause" button when the phone rang.  It isn't a 
real button, mind you.  I mean, it _is_ a real button, since it does a real 
thing -- it puts the CD player on pause.  But it's not a real button, if 
you know what I mean.

     Don't feel bad.  Sometimes I don't know what I mean or what others 
mean, either, when talk comes around to the latest virtual machines.  I 
don't know of any other term for them.

     They're all around us when we use personal computers.

     You're told to click on a window.  It's not a window, of course.  
It's a virtual window.  And you're told to press a button.  It's really a 
picture of a button.

     Things can get complicated fast.  In our standard PC setup at the 
newspaper where I train journalists in the new technologies of our trade, 
reporters click on a typewriter to start up their word processor.  It's not 
a typewriter, of course.  It's not even a picture of a typewriter, if you 
are thinking along the virtual reality path.  It's a picture of a virtual 
typewriter.

     And so I have my virtual CD player.  The controls look just like the 
knobs and buttons on the Technics CD player that sits on the shelf beside 
my computer, but it's a lot more fun to use.  Any time I want to listen to 
a compact disc, I can just slide the disc into my CD-ROM drive and put my 
virtual player on the screen.

     I can even slide the virtual player out of the way if I'm doing 
something else.  It sure beats trying to lug my Technics around.

     What this means to the non-virtual CD-player business is anybody's 
guess.  I know typewriters all but disappeared when word processors and 
cheap computer printers took over.  Sure, you need a computer if you want 
to use a virtual CD player, but that's no problem; every office has 
computers, and maybe 40 percent of all homes do, too.

     Computers can be turned into virtual telephones, too.  And virtual 
TVs.  I guy I know has a virtual stereo FM receiver on his computer screen.

     One of my friends made a big discovery in the area of virtuality the 
other day.  He found a virtual keyboard on his computer screen.  It comes 
with Microsoft Windows.  If you press a virtual key on this virtual 
keyboard you get a virtual letter on the screen, I suppose.  It would have 
been a lot easier for him to press the real letter on the real keyboard, 
but it wouldn't have been, well, virtual.

     And it wouldn't have been as much fun.

     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!

     As Doug told you last month, there are several "Best of" disk 
collections in the Apple II library.  This month I'd like to give you some 
extra information about the "Best of Music Studio Songs" file, as well as 
information on the other Music Studio files available in the library.

     This file, titled BEST.OF.MS.BXY (#18976) was uploaded in June 1992.  
Since then there have only been a handful of new files uploaded for Music 
Studio.  If you have Music Studio, or have seen it for sale used and 
wondered about it, here is the information you need to get the best of the 
already recorded Music Studio songs.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Here is a list of all of the songs available on the Best of Music 
Studio Songs file.  This file is designed to fit on a single 800K 3.5" 
disk.

     To make this list, a song had to be special to some folks.  I'll make 
no attempt to evaluate them, since I have a tin ear. :)

   o ADD SOME ZIP TO YOUR LIFE!

               o ZIP DRIVE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS


          [Editor's note:  This column was originally written for 
          GEnieLamp IBM.  I've presented it here, in a slightly abbreviated 
          form, because much of the information is applicable to those who 
          wish to run a Zip drive on their Apple II.]


                    >>> ADD SOME ZIP TO YOUR LIFE! <<<
                    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Author's note:  This is an article I wrote for a computer club's monthly
"""""""""""""   magazine.  Since I wrote the article I have purchased an AC 
adapter that will work world-wide and I must say that it is half the weight 
of the one that comes with the Zip drives.  To the person who wanted to 
know if you can run programs from the drive--yes.  Just remember the 
parallel-port drive has a speed like an old AT hard drive--the Seagate 4038 
at about 29 Ms.


I Have a Zippy Drive   A couple of months ago I heard rumors that the
""""""""""""""""""""   Iomega Company was going to release a new external 
portable drive.  The name of this new drive is Zip.

     From the preliminary information I learned that:

          It would be small, measuring about 5 x 7 x 1-1/4 inches.
          It would weigh about one pound.
          The disks would hold 100 Mb of data.
          The disks would measure about 4 x 4 x 1/4 inches.
          The drives were made as a SCSI or Parallel port drive.
          The parallel Zip Drive has a Printer Pass-Though Connector.
          The cost would be about $200 for either drive.
          The 100 Mb disks would sell for about $20.
          The 25 Mb disks would sell for about $15.

     In my opinion the most important information was the cost of the new 
drive and the cost of those 100 Mb disks.

     Because Iomega makes the excellent Bernoulli drive, I was most 
interested in adding one of these new drives to my portable computer in 
order to reduce the weight we carry when traveling.  We use a Compaq Aero, 
a sub-notebook computer, which weighs only about four pounds.  We also 
carry the Bernoulli Transportable drive and about four Bernoulli 90 Mb 
cartridges.  The transportable and cartridges weigh about 12 pounds; about 
three times the weight of the computer.

     This Zip drive has reduced the weight of our computer gear by over 
eight pounds.  When traveling eight pounds is a lot of computer weight to 
loose.  Try to lose eight pounds of body weight in a week's time.

     I purchased the parallel port Zip drive because I wanted the ability 
to move the drive around to our various computers.  I wanted the ability to 
connect the drive to other peoples machines without a lot of configuration 
hassles as well.

     The Zip Drive comes with one free 100 Mb Zip Tools Disk which has 
about 20 Mb of Iomega programs to install and support the Zip drive in 
either DOS or Windows.  The one 3.5 inch (1.44 Mb) installation diskette 
furnished allows you to boot your computer with the Zip drive and to 
install the software for DOS or Windows from the Zip 100 Mb disk.  There is 
an external power supply (a cube 2x2x3 inches) along with a Data Cable 
furnished with the Zip Drive too.

     My only criticism of the Zip Drive is the Power Supply cube which 
plugs directly into an electrical outlet.  This method necessitates the use 
of a power strip for conveniently switching on or off the Zip drive.  If a 
power strip is not used, the cube will not allow you to plug any other 
gadget into the same outlet.  The same type of power cubes are used for 
portable printers and modems and I don't like them either.  I would rather 
they use a short 12 to 18 inches pig-tail wire with a plug on the end.  
This system would allow you to plug several other items into a power strip 
or a wall outlet box.

     Installation on my various systems was very easy.  If you need more 
information or if you have installation problems, there is a 130-page 
manual and a couple of short "read me" files on the 3.5 installation 
diskette.  These cover just about everything you would need should you 
experience any problems.  Well... maybe the Crash Queen would need some 
help. (grin) 

     I used the new Iomega drivers that came with the Zip drive on our 
Tower computer.  These drivers allowed me to boot with the two Bernoulli 
drives and the Zip drive when attached.

     On the portable computer and some other computers I use the Iomega 
GUEST program.  The GUEST program is a system driver which allows you to 
use your Zip drive temporarily almost anywhere.  It uses about 25 Kb of 
memory and it may be loaded in either high memory or conventional memory. 
This GUEST driver may be used as a permanent system driver as well.

     When installed, the Zip drive becomes just another drive on your 
system.  You can run programs.  You can copy files and programs to and from 
the Zip drive.  If you use Stacker you can store over 200 Mb on each disk.

     Performance of this drive has been more than adequate for me.  The 
access speed of the Zip drive is about 29 ms which equates to the speed of 
the old Seagate 4038 series drive I had in an old 286 computer.  The speed 
of data transfer to and from the Zip drive will depend on the model you 
purchase.  SCSI will be faster.  If you have a bi-directional parallel port 
or an EPP chip set, you may be able to use a faster mode of data transfer 
which will significantly improve the performance of your Zip drive.

     Caching will also speed up drive access.  Make sure you load the Zip 
drivers before loading your cache program. 

     I have been running several programs from the Zip drive and I can see 
a small difference in the speed of loading the programs.  The speeds of my 
hard drives are about 10 to 12 ms, which is about three times faster than 
the Zip drive. With the cost of the 100 Mb disks at $20, however, I can put 
up with the slower speed.

     To make the most of your Zip drive Zip disks may be used to extend 
your hard disk (hard disk upgrade alternative).  Are you constantly running 
out of hard disk space?  Your Zip drive and disks give you unlimited 
storage for all your information.  By placing files on Zip disks you have 
ready access to them without filling up your hard disk.  Zip Tools software 
will help you find any files you need, and Zip drive's hard-disk-like 
performance will let you access information quickly.

     Do you need to move information between different work locations?  
Between home and work?  To and from clients?  Your Zip drive and disks 
offer complete mobility.  Zip disks fit in a shirt pocket.  The Zip drive 
is easy to carry and is quickly set up.  The GUEST program allows you to 
use your Zip drive temporarily almost anywhere.

     Back up your hard disk.  Your Zip drive makes backups fast and 
simple.  You don't need special backup software just copy critical files to 
a Zip disk.  Copying is lightning fast and it will give an exact duplicate 
of your original files.  Should you need to restore a file simply copy it 
back to your hard drive, or just access it directly from the Zip drive. 

     Create a multimedia library (images, sounds, and video).  Because of 
their high capacity, being removable, and random access, Zip disks are 
ideal for storage-hungry image, sound, and video files.  Clips may come 
from a variety of sources including scanners, CD-ROMs, and video input 
devices.  Multimedia presentations and demonstrations may be created and 
stored to include video which may be replayed directly from the Zip disk.

     Do you need to keep files for a number of years?  Archive your 
valuable files on a Zip disk and store them in a safe place.  Whenever you 
need them you can access them quickly.

     Get organized.  If you work on several different projects or with 
many different clients, try segmenting your work onto different disks.  You 
can organize your information by project, client, date, or whatever.  Zip 
disks give you the capacity to get all associated files onto a single disk.  
Switching between projects and customers is as simple as inserting another 
Zip disk.

     To keep sensitive or confidential information safe, store it on a Zip 
disk and use your Zip Tools software and assign to it a password which must 
be used in order to read from or write to the disk.  At work you can 
protect sensitive information such as personnel files, company directories, 
and product plans or designs.  At home you can secure personal information 
such as tax records, budgets, and computerized checkbooks.

     I like this Zip drive and can recommend it as a best buy for the 
average computer user.  Considering the cost of the drive and disks it has 
proven to be an excellent purchase.

     Enjoy!
