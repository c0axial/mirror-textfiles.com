Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



                    >>> PLEASE ADJUST YOUR MINDSET <<<
                    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     In his book _The Dungeon Master:  The Disappearance of James Dallas 
Egbert III_ (Boston:  Houghton Mifflin, 1984), private investigator William 
Dear describes his hunt for a sixteen-year-old genius.  One particularly 
gruelling stage of the investigation involved searching the service tunnels 
that ran underneath Michigan State University:

               The maintenance engineer and I were the last team out 
          of the tunnels.  We emerged at about 11 P.M., after four and 
          a quarter hours underground, through unlocked double doors 
          into the basement of Case Hall, where Dallas had lived....
               What we did next was curious, and I can only call it 
          the act of a compulsive person.  WE SEARCHED THE BASEMENT.  
          If we'd been in Mother Teresa's bedroom, we probably would 
          have searched that.  We'd grown accustomed to searching.

     I thought of that incident recently when a new piece of software 
arrived in my mailbox.  I copied the program onto my hard drive, ran the 
program, and started trying every possible menu choice in an effort to find 
a bug.

     You see, I've been spending the last little while beta-testing 
software, the final stage before the software is released for sale.  I've 
gotten used to looking for bugs, and gotten used to trying menu options 
that I wouldn't normally use.

     That in turn reminded me that my fellow beta testers and I have been 
falling on each new release, closeting ourselves with the latest version, 
and emerging hours later to point out new bugs, or crow that old ones 
haven't been fixed.  Very rarely indeed did anyone rave about the features 
that had been added; our preoccupation was always the bugs that the new 
features caused.

     Okay, we WERE asked to be beta testers, not reviewers or advertising 
and promotion execs.  Even so:

     What's beta-testing like for a programmer or programming team?  For a 
programmer, beta-testing means the project is almost finished.  What's it 
like to suddenly hear 80 fantasticajillion complaints, and no compliments?

     I don't know; I don't really program.  I suspect it can be 
demoralizing.  (Writing--code, prose, or poetry--is so solitary that it's 
often demoralizing anyway.)

     It's great (if not surprising) news that there are still companies 
publishing software for the Apple II.  In the days ahead, we need to be 
particularly vigilant that we haven't become so hypnotized that we continue 
as we always have just because that's the way we've always done it.  There 
are few knowledgeable companies publishing Apple II software these days.  
Without becoming pushovers for any sloppy piece of software that comes down 
the pike, we need to realize that the Apple IIs dominance of the 
marketplace.  This economic reality means that it's a lot riskier for a 
publisher to invest in Apple II software.

     I'm not saying "Let's allow the remaining publishers to give us 
crummy support."  (This hasn't exactly been a major worry of mine lately, 
anyway.)

     I am saying that we should remember to be polite.  (Saying "please" 
and "thank you" might not make all the difference, but they do make some 
difference.)  We should remember to be reasonable.  (No more blowing up the 
first time a mistake is made, not even if you're having a rotten day.)  We 
should remember that practically every new piece of Apple II software comes 
at a bargain price... compared to a similar piece of software on a 
Macintosh or IBM.  (Sure, your computer budget is shrinking, but so is the 
publisher's.)

     To be honest, my advice is good advice even when all is smooth 
sailing.  It's just crucial advice when things are not going so well.

APPLEWORKS 4.3 MOUSETEXT DESKTOP INDEX   The other day at a meeting someone
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   asked me about patching AppleWorks 
4.3 to use mousetext in the oa-Q menu like Companion Plus.  It's really 
very simple.

     Get in a block editor like Block Warden or Zap.

     Follow SEG.AW on your AppleWorks disk or in your AppleWorks directory.

     Change bytes +$14A through +$163 to the mousetext characters of your 
choice.  These are the characters that appear on either side of "Desktop 
Index 1". To use the same characters as Companion Plus enter: D6 D7 D6 
D7.... or for the solid apple symbol, enter C0 starting at +$14A through 
+$163, 26 bytes.

     Starting at byte +$22C4 enter DA DF CC.  These are the mousetext 
characters used to draw the box.

     It's also very simple to move the oa-Q Menu to another position on 
the screen.  If anyone wants to, yell and I'll post the information.

     Note these addresses are for AW4.3 ONLY as far as I know.  I don't 
even have a copy of 4.1 or 4.2 anymore, so I have no way of checking.  As 
always, don't patch original disks.  Always use a backup.

RAMFAST PARTITION ONE BLOCK TOO LONG   I have been using the RamFAST Rev D 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   to setup hard disk drives that will 
be using a RamFAST or ship with a RamFAST, all year now.  Recently, I 
noticed that DiskTimer GS won't run on the 32 meg partition (boot 
partition) but didn't think much of it until I innocently ran ProSel-16, 
Volume Repair in the Main Directory and Fix Directory mode and learned that 
the partition was one block too long.  ProSel-16 volume repair fixed that, 
and DiskTimer GS worked!  So, now I check and fix all RamFAST created 32 
meg partitions (that is partitions that the RamFAST utility software 
creates in 32,m 768k size).  I recall and checked to verify, that the 
Chinook Hard Disk Drive Utility program always creats 32,767.5k partitions, 
which econfirms that the RamFAST 32,768k is one block too big, according to 
conventional software.

     In a future upgrade to the ROM software, would Sequential Systems 
please consider fixing this because I am now presently having to spend 
about 10 minutes resizing (correcting) the problem before shipping my Hard 
Diks (Disks) with RamFAST SCSI controllers.

MFS diskette.  A2FX and HFS conversion programs wont touch these, but 
MAC.TRANS.GS, in our A2 library, does the trick.   Even though it says GS, 
it will also work fine on an enhanced //e, though, just to complicate

ORDER NOW, AND GET 100 MEGS FREE?   I recently ordered a 170 meg HD for my

on a Thursday late in the day and they said they couldn't get it to 
Airborne that day so it would arrive Monday.  The following Thursday rolled 
around and no drive.  When I called back, they told me that they had a 
computer crash and lost a bushel of orders.  They had reconstructed the 
orders but by this time they were out of 170meggers.  No problem, they 
shipped a 270 meg for Saturday delivery with no shipping or handling.

SPECTRUM SLOWDOWN FIX   BTW, the "big clipboard slowdown" actually is not 
"""""""""""""""""""""   related to the clipboard's size.  I believe the 
clipboard slowdown occurs if you copy ANYTHING to the clipboard while 
inside Spectrum using the Spectrum.8 font.  If the clipboard contains 
copied text that references the Spectrum.8 font, the clipboard gets 
corrupted after you quit Spectrum (when the Spectrum.8 font is no longer 
resident in memory).  When you OA-Copy something new to the clipboard, 
you're replacing the old (corrupted) contents with a valid clipboard, and 
launching Spectrum won't show a massive slowdown (caused by the Scrap 
Manager eating all available memory).

     The only solution we've come up with:  Version 2.0 will ship with the 
Spectrum.8 font on disk and will install to the *:System:Fonts: folder, and 
the problem won't show up.

PMP FAX SOFTWARE REPORTS FROM THE FIELD   Wheels do need re-inventing now 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   and again...  :)

     Seriously, I want my software to work with ANY kind of fax modem.  
So, I'll have to get to Class 1 eventually, anyway, and since its the 
hardest to program for, I may as well get it over with.  Also, if I can 
write fax software that will work with a Class 1 modem, I can write it to 
work with anything...

     Anyway, I guess everyone is happy about this software :)  To keep you 
up to day, I've been converting more C code into assembly to try to speed 
things up.  Right now, it takes about 30 seconds or so (I haven't actually 
timed it) to "print" an AWGS page layout document to a fax file.  It then 
takes about 2 minutes or so to send it to the receiver. The more 
complicated the document being printed, the longer it tends to take.  To 
speed things up, I'm going to have 2 quality settings. When you "print" (ie 
save to a fax file), you'll be given 3 quality settings (Fast, Standard, 
Best).  When you send the fax, you'll be given 3 or 4 resolution settings.  
The quality setting tells PMPFax how big to make the graphic image.  When 
printing text, the bigger the better, since an enlarged graphic image will 
use larger font sizes if you have them, which will improve the general 
quality of the fax. The resolution is basically a chunkiness setting.  
Normally, PMPFax uses a 16x16 pattern to print in grey scale.  With the 
best resolution, 1 bit in the patter represents one fax pixel.  With a 
resolution setting of 2, 1 bit represents 2 bits, etc.  Its more 
complicated than that in real life, but the upshot is larger the setting, 
the chunkier the printout (and the lousier the quality) and the larger the 
setting, the faster it sends.

     As I mentioned before, I'm saving fax files into standard Apple 
Preferred format (saved with a custom block for the page information). This 
will allow PMPFax to send any AP graphic file, as well as a receive fax 
file.  Someone mentioned that type $C0, aux $0007 is the official Group 3 
T.4 raw image file, so I guess that's what I'll use for received faxes.

     So, here's the stuff that actually works:  the CDev loads fine and 
patches the Print Manager.  The patch code intercepts Print Manager calls 
to capture print jobs to fax files.  And, a stand-alone (for now) program 
will take these files and send them out.  In other words all the basics 
(except the receive) is finished.  Receiving should be quite simple, since 
all the routines I'll need are already written for the send side.  
Converting received faxes will take a bit of time, but shouldn't cause too 
many sleepless nights (two weeks' worth tops ;-)  

     So, there you have it.  Keep suggesting things, and I'll keep working.

>>>>>   There is an article in the October '94 issue of MacWorld comparing
"""""   Mac fax programs.  In a sidebar, the author describes desirable 
features of such programs.  It would be nice for a GS program to include as 
many of these as are feasible.  To paraphrase the article:

     Common features are: scheduling of outgoing faxes, send and receive 
in the background, multiple phone books, export received faxes as graphics, 
send one fax to multiple people, send multiple documents as one fax, log 
all faxes, forward a received fax to another fax machine, flip a received 
fax upside down, magnify and reduce faxes on screen.

     More sophisticated features are: send gray-scale images (like 
photos), antialiased (gray-scale) viewing of received faxes, intelligently 
omit the local area code when dialing, turn received faxes into text (OCR), 
rotate a received fax 90 degrees, dial credit card dialing sequences, can 
switch to fax manually during a voice call, automatically print received 
faxes, import and export tab-delimited phone books, a program that lets you 
quickly whip up short typed faxes.
                  (S.REEVES2, CAT38, TOP15, MSG:63/M645;1)

<<<<<   Well, first, I wasn't assuming everyone had AWGS :)  Just that most
"""""   do, which is why it would have been nice to have the graphic file 
specs. However, I'm writing my own cover sheet program, so the point is 
moot.  It will be a basic draw program.  You'll have all the basic shapes 
(ovals, rects, round rects, lines), 16 colors and 16 patterns, text, and 
APF importation of bitmaps for backgrounds, etc.  Also, of course, you'll 
have the predefined fax fields, such as page #, total pages, addresse, 
company, comments, etc.

     Short cover sheets won't be a problem.  You could always just choose 
a short page size (such as envelope) and confine your sheet to that. 
Attaching a default cover sheet (or none at all) to a phone book entry is a 
good idea.  I'll do something like that.  Since the actual print jobs are 
going to be stored in APF format, you'll be able to choose from print jobs, 
APF, and coversheet formats for sending faxes.  You'll also be able to send 
received faxes, or convert them over to APF format.  I'll also include 
groups in the phone book so you can send faxes to a number of different 
people.

     Keep the suggestions coming!

Paul                 (PMP, CAT38, TOP15, MSG:89/M645;1)

<<<<<   Well... I've changed how I'm going to do a few things.  For the
"""""   actual saved fax file, I'll be using my own format instead of APF 
and do all of the translation at "print" time.  This will greatly improve 
the speed at which the fax is actually transmitted (saving on phone bills).  
It will still be able to import APF files, but actual send jobs will be 
saved as a fax send file.

     Received images will be saved as raw T.4 fax data, with each page 
stored in a different file.  When viewing these files, the raw information 
will be read in, translated to scanline/pixel information, and squeezed 
into whatever magnification level you've selected.  When printing, I'll 
probably be stuck using whatever page size the printer driver is 
supporting.  I bet, though, if you select Compressed and 50% or whatever 
with the Laserwriter, you'll actually get a nice printout.

     As to informing you of un-sent faxes... What I'm planning on doing is 
keeping a scheduled log that contains all send jobs that haven't been sent 
yet.  Each of these jobs (which can include print jobs, coversheets, pages 
from other scheduled or received faxes, or PIC/APF files) will have a 
status and a time that they will be sent.  Normally, you will send send 
jobs immediate when they are created.  The job gets sent, then they are 
normally deleted (you'll have an option to retain sent jobs). However, 
you'll be able to sepecify a particular time to send a job.  As long as you 
keep your computer in the desktop, the fax software will look at the time 
(as well as seeing if any calls are coming in) and when the time comes for 
a scheduled fax, it will attempt to send.  If something goes wrong, the job 
will remain in the scheduled log, the status will be "Send Failed" or 
soemthing like that, and all the details will be in the main log for you to 
look at.  At boot time next, you'll probably be able to hear nifty sounds 
for "Fax Waiting", "Fax Not Sent" and the like.

SYSTEM II BRINGS THE DESKTOP TO THE APPLE II   Westerville, OH.  Kitchen 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Sink Software is shipping a 
desktop system for the Apple II computer.  The desktop brings the Apple II 
up to the same level as a MAC in user friendliness.  IBM also has a desktop 
called Windows.  Asked why the Apple II needs a desktop program, Kitchen 
Sink Software President Guy Forsythe said, "There are a lot of Apple II 
computers out there. Schools want students to see the up to date methods of 
doing things. Individuals are tired of hearing about how the Apple II is 
just too out of date and being outdone by the newer systems. But the Apple 
II can do the job!"

     The new desktop is called System II to keep in alignment with the MAC 
way of numbering their systems while at the same time making it evident 
that this is for the Apple II.  The system will work on 5.25", 3.5" and 
hard disks. One place wanting a desktop is schools that have Mac LCs with 
the //e card. The system will work on any Apple II that can run ProDOS and 
has 128K of memory.  Students will see System II and know how to use it 
because it is similar to the MAC system.  System II brings the //e up to 
date.

     The desktop is similar to "At Ease" so it is not cluttered in 
appearance, but it has the capability to copy files and other desktop 
functions. Teachers will appreciate the ability to turn off the file 
manipulation capabilities.

     What makes System II different from //e desktop programs of the past 
is that System II is more than a desktop.  It is a complete operating 
system. so teachers or developers who want to publish software that uses 
pull down menus, dialog boxes and all the other features that make the MAC 
and Windows interface so popular are available to everybody.  The system 
works in both single and double hires in both color and mono- chrome modes.

     The System II Developer's Kit includes all the programs, routines and 
information you need to write fast running, professional looking programs 
in System II.  Even things like a disk formatter are included.  The  
licensing fee lets the developer make a profit before paying any fees!

System II   $39.95 with site licenses for $99.95 allowing you to put it on 
'''''''''   as many computers as you have in one building.  This package 
includes:

Easy II Desktop: a simplified desktop for use in classrooms or at home 
where you just want to run programs quickly from an easy to use desktop. 
Easy II allows you to boot from any disk including an internal hard disk or 
file server.  You can run protected programs from a floppy disk as easily 
as any other program... all from a familiar desktop.

Full II Desktop: when it is time to do some copying or desktop arranging, 
just switch to Full II (password protection built in) to get a fully 
functional desktop system.

System II Developers Kit   $69.95.  This package inlcudes:
''''''''''''''''''''''''
     Easy II and Full II desktops.  System II Complete User Interface.  
You get all the instructions and commands that allow you to write Applesoft 
programs with a complete graphical user interface for ProDOS and single or 
double hires graphics.  This includes pull down menus, dialog boxes 
buttons, check boxes, cursor control, graphic drawing tools, etc.  You can 
publish/distribute disks using all of our interface routines.  You pay a 
$100 publishing license after you sell $1000 worth of your  product.

     You can call and order either package from the continental US at:

Broderbund and he informed me that they will be pulling the plug on the 
Apple II version of NPS.  From what he said, it will happen sometime within 
the next couple of months.  They will, however, continue to offer NPS 
technical support for another year yet.

     As a way of encouragement to Randy and Dan, yesterday I was at our 
national headquarters looking at the proofs of a magazine article which had 
been laid out on a very expensive IBM-type machine running windows, with 
comercial top-of-the-line desk-top publishing software.  The Microsoft 
screen saver kicked in with it's normal screen saver.  I moved the mouse 
and CRASH!  An error message "A fatal error has occured."  Someone yelled 
at me, "You can't touch the mouse without holding down the shift key!"

     I thought he was just kidding, but no, it's really true.  With the 
screen saver on, one little bump on the mouse brings down the whole stack 
of cards requiring a re-startup - all work lost.  (Fortunately, they had 
saved the magazine files earlier).

     What we have in the little bugs in AW are nothing compared to what 
people have to face everyday who use very expensive MS software!

     Thanks, Randy, Dan, Quality and many others, who give us programs 
which are stable!

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

   [P.SHAPIRO1]



             >>> A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT ONLINE BOOK REVIEWS <<<
             """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     As we walk through the portals of the information age, more and more 
books are being published on a variety of interesting topics.  The reading 
public is eager to find out more about these books.  Which books are 
mediocre?  Which books are good?  Which books are excellent?  Online 
information services can provide a key role in helping readers separate the 
wheat from the chaff.  By providing online book reviews shortly after the 
book has come to market, online services can promote the interests of the 
reading public as well as promote the interests of book publishers.

The Key Advantages of Online Publishing   Online publishing has three 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   distinct advantages over hardcopy 
publishing:  1) With online publishing the lead time between when the 
article is written and when it is published can be very short; and, 2) 
Online publishing does not face the rigorous space constraints that haunt  
hardcopy periodical publishers.  3) Online publishing offers the best hope 
of breaking away from the "literary" strangle-hold of the current book 
reviewing establishment.  A closer look at each of the advantages of online 
book reviews follows.

The Publishing "Lead Time" Lag   These short lead times mean that any 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   article written for an online publication 
can be published literally minutes after the author has finished writing 
it.  In comparison, hardcopy periodicals typically work on lead times of at 
least three months.  When you add the two or three months a book reviewer 
usually takes to write a review, the published book review often appears 
six months or more after the book was released.

     This long "lead time" lag is detrimental to the reading public as 
well as to book publishers.  Book reviews serve as one of the primary ways 
that people find out about new books.  If the book review process is drawn 
out, then publishers have a lag in the return on their investment (one 
which could potentially cost them).  Readers find it difficult to know 
which new books are worth buying.  As a result, society's interests may 
suffer.  By shortening the book review time cycle, online publishing can 
serve the interests of readers, publishers, and society at large.

Hardcopy Periodical Space Constraints   Many hardcopy book reviews are
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   condensed and read as if they are 
summaries of book reviews.  Newspapers and magazines typically publish book 
reviews 400 to 600 words in length.  These mini-reviews try to both 
describe and evaluate books in the span of three or four paragraphs. The 
emphasis of many of these short reviews tends to be on the reviewer's 
opinions of the book.  Readers rarely get to draw their own conclusions 
about the book's strengths and weaknesses.  Rare indeed are the times when 
readers finish reading a review with a good sense of the book's true 
content.

     In contrast, online book reviewers can write feature length book 
reviews:  the type of book review that gives you a clear sense of what the 
reviewed book is all about.  Reviews of non-fiction books can include a 
copy of the entire table of contents (where appropriate).  Reviewers can 
quote from three, four, or five different passages in the book.  And the 
quotes need not be single sentence "sound bite" quotes.

     With the book publisher's permission, an online book review could 
even include quoted segments of the book that were two or three paragraphs 
in length.  In comparison with the current practice of annoyingly short 
"sound bite" quoted passages, quoted segments in online reviews would be 
more like  "full sandwich" quotes -- far more fulfilling to both reader and 
book review author.

Breaking the Current "Literary" Strangle-hold on Book Reviews   Many
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   mainstream 
newspaper and magazine book review editors have a strong literary bent.  
Often publishers of these periodicals might hire these editors straight 
from academia.  The result is that "literary" books make up a large 
proportion of books chosen for review.  Many worthy, "non-literary" books 
are overlooked.

     Online publishing can help to break the stranglehold that the 
literary elite have on the book review publishing process.  Without the 
space constraints of hardcopy publishing, online publishing can just as 
easily publish twenty book reviews per month as ten.  No worthy book need 
ever be overlooked or brushed over.

Forging New Links Between Book Review Authors and Book Publisher   
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Online publishing of book reviews also opens up the possibility of 
forging new links between book review authors and book publishers.  There 
is no reason why the book review process needs to start when the finished 
book has reached the shelves of book stores.  Once the publisher has a 
rough draft of the finished book  book reviewers can then be contacted to 
start work on their review. There is no reason why an online book review 
cannot be published concurrently, or even two weeks before, the release of 
a new book.

     As online book reviews become more commonplace, hardcopy book reviews 
will become less important.   Online book reviews will become known for 
being "early and detailed."  hardcopy book reviews will become known for 
being "late and short."

Creating a New Type of Book Review   Online book reviews also open up the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   doorway for creating new types of book 
reviews.  There is no reason why book publishers themselves could not be 
invited to write three or four paragraphs on whey they are publishing a  
book.  Such a "publisher's statement" could be appended to the end of an 
online book review.  Thoughtful publishers will use those few paragraphs to 
honestly describe their motivation for bringing the reviewed book to 
market.  (Publishers's statements that sounded too much like a "sales 
pitch" would be quite naturally self-defeating.)  Readers could then judge 
the book on yet one more criterion:  how skilled is the publisher in 
describing the book it is publishing.

     It's a simple, yet radical, idea to let publishers describe why they 
wanted to publish a book.  Yet this idea serves the interests of both 
readers and publishers.  Online publishing makes the idea possible.

Finding Suitable Book Reviewers   Finding suitable book reviewers to write
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   online book reviews should not be 
difficult.  Currently there are about ten million students in our nation's 
colleges and universities.  Out of those ten million, it would not be 
difficult to locate fifty to one hundred skilled writers with an interest 
in writing for a national online service.  Students might also be able to 
submit their written reviews for credit in their classes.

     Other than students, an additional fifty to one hundred reviewers 
could easily be found from the general population.  These "non-student" 
reviewers could be pulled from the pool of freelance writers, published 
authors, librarians, and others with a general interest in books.

Finding Suitable Books to Review   Likewise, finding suitable books to 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   review ought not be difficult, either.  
Every two months a new edition of "Forthcoming Books" is published by R. R. 
Bowker.  Listed in this reference book are the titles of thousands of books 
due to be published within the next six months.

     These "forthcoming books" are organized into subject categories.  
Book reviewers can zero in on their particular areas of interest to cover 
the new books coming out in that field of learning.

Book Review Bottleneck Burdens Burgeoning Bibliophiles   It is ironic that 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   at a time when 
bookstores seem to be prospering, when people are rediscovering reading and 
writing via online services, and when the need for information is great, 
that the publishing industry is held at bay by this tiny bottleneck known 
as the hardcopy book review.  Online book reviews offer the best hope for 
liberating publishers, authors, and readers.  The future of the written 
word looks promising, indeed.

Autism and Apple IIs

     The following two "sidebars" were written for inclusion in the 
recently published article in II ALIVE magazine, "Autism and Apple II's".  
Space constraints precluded them from being included with the published 
article.  The sidebars are being included here in the GEnieLamp A2 for 
those who might be interested in further information on this subject.


Sidebar:  Online Resources for Parents of Autistic Children   In doing 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   research for 
this article, I uncovered some dandy online resources for parents of aus 
the autism discussion newsgroup by first navigating to the newsgroups area 
of AOL.  (Hint: Use the keyword: "newsgroups".)  Then double-click on the 
icon titled: "Expert Add."  When the dialog box appears on the screen, type 
in the name of the newsgroup: "bit.listserv.autism".

     AOL will confirm that this newsgroup has been added to the your list 
of newsgroups on AOL.  To read the messages in this newsgroups, click on 
the icon titled: "Read my newsgroups."  In browsing this newsgroup I 
encountered a wide range of messages on a diverse array of topics relating 
to autism.  Some messages were even posted by persons overseas.  And quite 
serendipitously I found out that an international conference about autism 
and computers will be taking place in the south of France in January 1995.  
The Internet has wondrous powers at connecting up persons with shared 
interests.

Sidebar:  Independent Apple II Special Needs Software Developers
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Several independent software developers are working to produce
Apple II special needs software.  Perhaps the best known of the independent 
(read: one person company) special needs software developers is Bill Lynn, 
of SimTech, in Connecticut.  Bill is a nationally recognized HyperStudio 
guru, and presents frequently at regional and national computer 
conferences.  He has also written many articles on special needs computing 
subjects.  In assembling information for this article, I sent Bill some 
questions via electronic mail on GEnie.  Here is a copy of the answer he 
sent:

From:   BILL.LYNN                       Bill Lynn

To:     P.SHAPIRO1                      Phil Shapiro

> Bill, I'm looking forward to getting the info you're sending about the
> creative stacks you've made.

     I dropped a brochure in the mail today, Phil.  You should get it in a 
couple of days, depending on how many feet of snow fall between now and 
then. ;)

> I imagine there might be info in the material you send on where parents/
> schools might buy an Apple II Switch Interface.

     No but plans for the A2 switch interface can be had pretty easily.  
Basically, you can adapt any joystick to be a switch interface by adding 
inputs to the fire buttons.  The plans for the switch interface were also 
published in ][ Alive last summer (July/August issue, pages 49-51.) in my 
article entitled "Switched On HyperStudio."  There are several sources for 
buying the interface commercially such as Don Johnston, Incorporated 
($42.00, call 1-800-999-4660), AbleNet ($36.00, call 1-800-322-0956) and 
Toys for Special Children ($41.00 & $46.00, call 1-800-832-8697).

     Now that I think of it, Phil, I uploaded a HyperStudio stack to the 
A2 libraries here on GEnie several years ago, called SIMTECH.01.BXY.  It's 
file #15531 and it includes plans on how to make the switch interface, a 
simple push switch and a call signal.  The plans for the interface call for 
using the Apple II joystick extension cord which is no longer available 
from Radio Shack (America's Technology Store).  Instead, any straight 
through DB9 cable with male plugs will substitute quite nicely.

     If you like, you can list my address and if people are interested in 
the plans I will send them a copy of the ][ Alive article (Jerry Kindall 
won't mind).

> (Is this interface different from the Adaptive Firmware Card?)

     Very much so.  It's a great deal less expensive, doesn't take up a 
slot and it's much easier to use.  However, if people already have and use 
the AFC they needn't buy or make an additional switch interface since the 
AFC will accommodate two switches in precisely the same way the A2 switch 
interface does (i.e. emulating the joystick fire buttons or the <option> 
and <apple> keys).

Cheers... Bill

     Here's a brief description of Bill Lynn's work, in his own words.  
(Also sent to me via electronic mail.)

     "A quick thumbnail sketch of what I do:  I specialize in accessible 
software for kids with physical disabilities who use switches to access the 
Apple II, IIgs and Mac.  These are all HyperStudio or HyperCard stacks that 
are programmed to respond to switch hits.  Most programs require either an 
inexpensive Apple II Switch Interface or the more expensive Macintosh 
Switch Interface (or an adapted mouse will work on both platforms).  
Although these programs are not made specifically for kids who have autism 
I do believe it may be useful to some, particularly for those who perhaps 
could bang on a big panel switch but who might not be able to relate to the 
keyboard."

These programs were designed by special educators who were looking for 
activities which address everyday needs."  The stacks require an Apple IIgs 
with 1 megabyte of RAM, and can work with either a mouse or TouchWindow.

     The titles in the ILA series include:  Community Signs, Functional 
Sight Words, Grocery Shopping, Hygiene Routines, Laundry, MacDonald's Menu, 
Identifying Money, Dialing the Phone, Telling Time, What's That Sound.  
Each title sells for $20 per disk. Demo disks for this series are 
available.  The entire series sells of disks sells for $175.  Note: You do 
not need to own HyperStudio to use this software.  A HyperStudio run-time 
disk is available from this company for an extra $10.

A Few Suggestions for Contacting Smaller Software Publishing Companies   
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     If you're interested in contacting Bill Lynn or Barbara Couse Adams 
(or any other smaller educational software publisher), you might keep in 
mind a few things to make communications easier.  When requesting 
information from smaller publishing companies, it's always thoughtful to 
send five or six postage stamps to help defray their postage expenses.  
Also, when leaving a phone message on their answering machines, leave your 
home or weekend phone number, so they don't have to incur the cost of 
calling you during peak phone-rate periods.  Even better, send electronic 
mail whenever possible.

     One interesting facet about smaller publishing companies is that 
they're usually amenable to working on "custom-built" software.  If you 
have a particular software program that you'd like made, you might try 
contacting some independent software developers to see how feasible it 
would be to make the software.

              >>> FEAR AND LOATHING IN THE COMPUTER STORE <<<
              """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     I HATE shopping for computers in a computer store.  I don't mean that 
I dislike purchasing computers.  Don't get me wrong.  I just HATE having to 
deal with the salespeople in these types of stores.  I would rather spend a 
day at the local car dealership instead of at the computer store.  I would 
rather go shopping with my wife for dresses in Macy's.  I would rather wear 
the dresses that my wife had bought at Macy's.  I would rather have a root 
canal.  Well, maybe I crossed the line with those last two.  But you catch 
my drift.  Could you tell that I was clenching my teeth while I was typing?

     I have been involved with home computers since 1983 when I purchased 
my first computer:  the Apple II+.  My family has never been without a 
computer since the day of that acquisition.  I have added printers, hard 
drives, monitors, modems, and various other equipment through the years.  I 
have even managed to acquire about five more computers.  However, almost 
without exception, my purchases after the original Apple II have been from 
somewhere besides a computer store.

     I am not saying that I have never gone into a computer store since my 
original purchase.  Quite the opposite is true.  I have actually spent a 
considerable amount of time in this type of store.  But when it comes down 
to making a major purchase, forget it.  Here is the typical conversation 
between myself and a computer salesman:

SALESPERSON:   How may I help you today, sir?
''''''''''''

ME:   Well, I was interested in this computer.  Can you tell me if the
'''   motherboard has an 128K cache or 256K?

SALESPERSON:   Well, I am not sure... but are you really asking the right
''''''''''''   question?  Shouldn't you be asking yourself whether or not 
that computer will last for the next 10 years?  That is really the 
question.  Now if you would take a look at this computer over here.  The 
Super Deluxe Mega Mainframe-in-a-box X686 computer will serve your needs 
for years to come.  This baby comes fully loaded and ready to go.  You can 
even mow your lawn with the optional mulching accessories.

ME:   Wait a minute!  This computer is thousands more than I wanted to
'''   spend.  I just wanted to...

SALESPERSON:   Oh sure!  Go ahead and limit yourself.  But I ask you, do
''''''''''''   you really want to keep your kids from going to college?

ME:   What?
'''

SALESPERSON:   Your kids!  Think, man.  What about all of the great
''''''''''''   multimedia educational software that your kids will not be 
able to run?  But I guess you just don't care that the Smith kids are 
getting scholarships to all of the best universities.  No child can get 
into the best schools without getting the advantage you can get with this 
computer.  But I don't suppose that this subject is important to you...

ME:   Well, I want my kids to have the best.
'''

SALESPERSON:  Good!  Now you are thinking.  What does your wife do for a
''''''''''''  living?

ME:   She is a teacher.
'''

SALESPERSON:   Excellent.  I am sure that your wife will appreciate the
''''''''''''   fact that this computer comes with a subscription to the 
national teacher's hot line.  The subscription gives your wife 10 free 
minutes of access.  Of course, you will need to purchase the optional 
4,000,000 baud modem.

ME:  How much does that cost?
'''

SALESPERSON:   Darrel, you are not focusing on the key issues here.  What
''''''''''''   is more important, your kids success in life or your 
checkbook?  Your wife's ability to do her job, or a few measly bucks at the 
computer store?

ME:  Goodness.
'''

SALESPERSON:   Now that you are thinking the right way, can I pack you one
''''''''''''   of these to take home.  I would, of course, add in a laser 
printer, 17" monitor, and decorative fish bowl to round out the system.

ME:   What would be the total system price on the computer you just
'''   described?

SALESPERSON:   If you have to ask, then your heart is not in the right
''''''''''''   place.  Money is not the key factor here.  The success of 
you, your wife, and your kids IS at stake.  I think that you will want to 
act upon those factors instead of allowing yourself to be limited by 
current fiscal shortsightedness.  Besides, we have a loan officer in the 
back who will be glad to set you up with a convenient monthly payment that 
will be well within your budget.

     Admit it.  The scene I just described above has happened to you on at 
least one occasion.  Right?  I been subjected many times to the hard sale 
from a computer neophyte (i.e. salesman) who didn't really know how to edit 
a simple text file.

     Here's another typical scenario:

ME:   Excuse me, could you tell me the impedance of these speakers?
'''

SALESPERSON:   Well, I could, but I would be ashamed of myself for doing
''''''''''''   so.

ME:   Why is that?  These are the speakers that are on sale, right?
'''

SALESPERSON:   Yes, these speakers are on sale, but I don't recommend them.
''''''''''''   They are not shielded and there is no amplification system 
to bring out the subtle nuances of the music.  Now over here we have our 
Bose Super Amplified 500 W Speaker System and Coffee Maker.  This product 
will give you superior sound and will not have a bit of interference from 
those traffic helicopters that fly over 3 times a day.

ME:   Holy mark-up, Batman!  I didn't want to spend that kind of money.
'''   I was interested in the speakers that you have on sale.

SALESPERSON:   Well, of course, you can purchase those speakers if you have
''''''''''''   a tin ear and don't care about true sound reproduction.

ME:   I just want to play games and stuff.  I don't need a home stereo
'''   system...

SALESPERSON:   You are limiting yourself on this one.  Why not go for the
''''''''''''   home stereo approach.  With the Bose system and a few 
additional components, you can have a better sound system on your computer 
than you do in your living room.  What a concept.  There is special this 
month on the Sony Mini-Home Studio with 5000 W Amplifier and CD-ROM player.  
In addition, I can throw in the Virtual Reality Game Playing helmet and you 
will be ready for some real game playing.

ME:   Aargh!
'''
(This cry is ripped from my mouth as I go flying out the front door of the 
store.)

     One final example should round out the explanation of my fear and 
loathing of computer stores:

ME:   Excuse me.  Could you tell me if this disk drive is compatible with
'''   a Macintosh IIx?

SALESPERSON:   What is a Macintosh IIx?
''''''''''''

ME (incredulously):   It is a computer made by Apple.  It was sold maybe
'''''''''''''''''''   three years ago in most stores.

SALESPERSON:   Oh, well this drive is not compatible with that computer.
''''''''''''

ME:   Are you sure?
'''

SALESPERSON:   Yes!
''''''''''''

ME:   Well, do you have a disk drive that will work with a IIx?
'''

SALESPERSON:   No.
''''''''''''

ME:   Okay, let's try a different route.  Can you order a disk drive that
'''   will work with my IIx?

SALESPERSON:   I will have to check with my manager.  This will only take
''''''''''''   20 minutes.  I will be right back.

ME:   Hold on.  How long does it take to get in a special order?
'''

SALESPERSON:   I don't know.
''''''''''''

ME:   Can you give me a rough estimate?  Does it take two weeks?  Does it
'''   take a month?

SALESPERSON:   Oh, okay.  It will take two weeks to get in a drive.
''''''''''''   However, since it will be a special order there will be no 
return possible.

ME (in frustration):   Don't you guys do anything to support the Mac IIx?
''''''''''''''''''''

SALESPERSON:   No, but that computer is ancient technology.  I can sell you
''''''''''''   a new computer that will work with all of our drives.  In 
the process, you can move up to the newest technology.  Besides that, the 
system plays great games.  Let me take you over here and show you the Super 
Deluxe Mega Mainframe-in-a-box X686 computer...

     And you thought it was just the Apple II world that had to endure 
this sort of abandonment!

               THE TREASURE HUNT /

Yours For the Downloading
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Charlie Hartley
      [C.HARTLEY3]



     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month we will examine 
several different files.  There is no central theme this month, but I think 
there is something here for just about everyone.  Let's get started. :)

                                 [*][*][*]


     COGITO.BXY      File #23321      285696 bytes      GS PUZZLE GAME
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.    This is Cogito, the latest FREEWARE release from Brutal Deluxe.  This 
nifty puzzle game for the GS is loosely based on the Rubik's Cube.  [But 
it's a lot more fun!--Ed.]  The object is to restore a shuffled puzzle to 
its original condition.  It starts off fairly simple and gets progressively 
harder.  You can play any of the 100+ levels at any time, but of course 
you'll have more fun if you start at level 1 and work your way up.  The 
game itself is in greyscale, but it's very well done and has some nice 
background music that you can turn on and off as you wish.  Once the game 
starts, press any key on the keyboard to get to the "setup" screen.  Be 
sure to read the READ.ME file first.  Included is Tool 220 which must be 
placed in the Tools folder located in the System folder of your boot disk.

     If you haven't discovered this game yet, rush over to the library and 
get it.   It is well worth the long download time.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Are you tired of the generic trash can on your GS Finder screen?  
Would you like something different, unusual, perhaps a little weird?  Check 
out the two files listed below that were uploaded by Lunatic.


      NUKE.NY.2.I.BXY  File #18231    1408 bytes    Finder Trash Icon
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is the latest version of Luny's popular "nuclear trash" icons.  
This version has been shrunk slightly so that Finder 6.0 won't have to move 
the fourth volume online up to the next row of disks.  NOTE: Finder 6.0 
doesn't need these icons to be in any special file!  Simply throw this icon 
file into the Icons folder on your boot disk and it'll show up!


     EXPLOSIONHT.BXY  File #18268   12672 byte   rSound for trash icon
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is a Sound Resource file for use with System 6.0 and/or 
HyperCard v1.1.  HangTime converted this sound from EXPLOSION2.BXY into a 
rSound for use with HyperCard.  Lunatic then pulled the sound out of the 
HyperCard stack and put it into its own file.  To use this sound, simply 
copy the file into your System Sounds folder on your system disk.  Then it 
will show up in the Sound CDev (without a reboot) and you can use it for 
whatever system sounds you want.  It'll be available to all HCGS v1.1 
stacks on your machine.  This is a GREAT sound for use with his updated 
Nuclear Trash icons.  You'll be able to HEAR the explosion as well as SEE 
the explosion.

     I might add that these icons and this sound can also be used within 
HyperStudio as well as HyperCard.

     SHOWME1.1.BXY    File #23179   73728 byte    GS GRAPHICS VIEWER +
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Dave Leffler has provided us with an exceptionally good NDA/Finder 
Extra to view IIgs and other graphics including MacPaint, GIF, 3200 color, 
Print Shop IIgs, and now Paintworks animations too!  Not only that but it 
also allows some simple changes in the graphics as well as the ability to 
save in several formats.  Best of all, the price is right -- FREE.  Dave 
releases this as JesusAware, the same as Freeware.

     The following comments are quoted from Dave's documentation file that 
is included with the download.

     "ShowMe! is a combination New Desk Accessory (NDA) and Finder 6.0 
Extension (FX) that will allow you to see an unobstructed full screen views 
of any type of IIgs Super HiRes Graphic, plus some other non-IIgs formats.  
You can also save the displayed graphic in a couple of different formats, 
and do some simple color conversions.

     "You may view:

  - Unpacked graphics (Screen) files
  - Eagle/Packbytes format packed graphics files
  - Apple Preferred Format packed graphics files
  - PaintWorks packed graphics files
  - PaintWorks Gold 640 mode packed graphics format
  - PrintShop GS Color Graphics
  - Unpacked 3200 Color pictures
  - Packed 3200 Color pictures, "3201"-APP and APF.
  - Graphics Interchange Format, GIF graphics versions 87a AND 89a
  - MacPaint graphics, Full or Half height

     "You may save graphics: (does not apply to 3200 color pictures)

  - Unpacked graphics (Screen) files
  - Apple Preferred Format packed graphics files, Full or Screen Size
  - Double Height Apple Preferred Format files, Full or Screen Size

     "You may convert: (does not apply to 3200 color pictures)

  - 320 mode pictures into 640 mode color pictures  
  - 320 mode pictures into 640 mode gray scale pictures
  - 320 mode to 640 mode
  - 640 mode to 320 mode
  - 640 mode to 320 mode with default palette
  - 320 mode to 640 mode with default palette

     "You may also:

  - Display more that one graphic at a time in a slide show fashion.
  - Use it as a graphics previewer before launching a graphics application.

     "You must have a IIgs running System software version 5.04 or later.  
Also a little extra memory might be nice for those large graphics files.  
Even though ShowMe! will work fine under 5.04, you'll have many more 
features when running it under the System 6.0 since it takes advantage of 
the new Finder features."

     Previous versions were called ShowPic NDA.  If you have a previous 
version, you know how good Dave's work is.  This one is the best yet.  Rush 
right over to the library and get it.  Read the documentation file to be 
sure you are setting it up correctly, and then enjoy the graphics!

       SCARABAEIDA.BXY    File #18579    4608 bytes     Finder Extra
       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                  Scarabaeidae v1.0 - by Richard Bennett
                         Copyright 1992 by Oz Data

     Scarabaeidae is a Finder extension for System 6.0 and above.  It 
doesn't do much, but what it does, it does with a vengeance.  Scarabaeidae 
will delete any Finder data files  which it finds amongst the currently 
selected files on the desktop.  If any folders are selected, Scarabaeidae 
will dive into them and delete all the Finder data files it finds inside 
them.

     If you want to remove the Finder files from any disk or folder, this 
is a quick and easy way to do it.  If you could not possible care less that 
the Finder is dropping root and data files on your disks, then you don't 
need this program.

     Install Scarabaeidae in your System/System.Setup folder, and reboot 
your IIgs.  The Extras menu should now contain Scarabaeidae.  It can be 
invoked by selecting it from the menu, or by pressing OA-Z.

     According to the dictionary, the scarab is one of a family 
(Scarabaeidae) of stout-bodied beetles (as a dung beetle) with lamellate 
antennae.  If you remember that these Finder files are often called 
"droppings" by those who dislike them, you'll understand why Richard 
selected this name.

       MINIMIZER.BXY      File #23193    7424 bytes      Finder CDev
       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                            Minimizer Ver. 1.0
                       Copyright 1994 by Bill Tudor

     According to Bill's documentation file, "Minimizer is an Apple IIgs 
Control Panel (CDev) that adds a minimize feature to the IIgs window 
manager.  This feature allows you to minimize a window to reduce the space 
required to display the window on the physical screen.  In general, you 
would minimize a window temporarily while you work in another window, and 
restore the window when you want to again work with it.  This process moves 
the window out of the way without having to close and re-open it."

     To install Minimizer, copy it to the System/CDevs folder on your boot 
disk and re-boot.  To minimize a window, hold down the Option key while 
clicking on the zoom box.  This causes the window to minimize (rather then 
Zoom).  Clicking in the title area allows you to drag the minimized window 
around the screen.  Clicking the window icon restores the minimized window 
to its original size and position.

     I've tried Minimizer several times, and it works just fine.  It's 
actually kind of neat, and useful for keeping your Finder screen 
uncluttered.  You should read the documentation file to get the most 
benefit from the program.

     Bill Tudor describes this as shareware, and requires a $10 shareware 
payment, with a catch.  If you pay him $10, you can consider it payment for 
any (or all) of his shareware programs in the A2 library.

      ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                          Desktop Doctor Ver. 1.0
                       Copyright 1994 by Bill Tudor

     The following description is taken from the documentation that comes 
with the program.

     "Desktop Doctor is an Apple IIgs Finder Extension that checks and 
fixes the Finder's desktop files and icon files.  This includes removing 
duplicate entries, keeping desktop databases up to date, and checking and 
fixing icon application pathnames in both icons and desktop files.

     "After installation, choose 'Desktop Doctor' item from the Finder's 
Extras menu.  This is bring up the desktop doctor dialogue box.  Check each 
option you wish to perform:

   "[x] Delete desktop files   -   This option deletes all existing desktop 
                                   files in the Icons folder of all of your 
                                   disks. Note that this option is normally 
                                   not performed. Any document/application 
                                   links created with the Finder's Option- 
                                   Control-Open feature will be lost.

   "[x] Rebuild desktop        -   Rebuilds your desktop databases by 
                                   scanning your disks for applications and 
                                   checking for rBundles.

   "[x] Remove duplicates      -   This options removes wasteful duplicate 
                                   entries and unused entries (orphans) 
                                   from your desktop databases.

   "[x] Check icon pathnames   -   Checks the 'Application to launch' 
                                   pathname for BOTH old-style and new- 
                                   style icons. You are given the 
                                   opportunity to correct pathnames."

     Desktop Doctor may be installed in the FinderExtras folder on the 
boot disk, or in the System.Setup folder there.  It requires System 6.0 or 
later.

     I confess that I don't know enough about this sort of thing to know 
how valuable this program can be.  However, when I ran it on my system, it 
removed 13 duplicate entries and freed up 29,154 bytes.

     Bill Tudor describes this as shareware, and requires a $10 shareware 
payment, with a catch.  If you pay him $10, you can consider it payment for 
any (or all) of his shareware programs in the A2 library.

                       Copyright 1994 by Bill Tudor

     According to Bill's documentation file that accompanies this file, 
"File Finder is an Apple IIgs Finder Extension INIT program that allows you 
to search for files on disks or in folders.  You can search for files by 
name, partial name, created date, modified date, file type, file size, 
embedded text, or any combination of the above.  Once a set of files is 
found, you can delete, open, peek at, or locate (open the Finder window 
containing the file) the file."

     You may install File Finder by copying it into either the 
System.Setup folder or the FinderExtras folder on your boot disk.  If you 
do the former, you must reboot for it to be active; in the latter case, 
just run the Finder again for it to be active.

     The following information is taken from the documentation file.

     "To search file files, select 'File Finder' from under the 'Extras' 
menu in the Finder.  If you want to search a particular disk or folder 
(including folders within the selected folder), select that folder before 
choosing the File Finder item.

     "Type in the name (or partial name) of the file you wish to search 
for, select the search location and name matching criteria and then click 
the Search button to begin the search.  The location popup allows you to 
search any disk, all disks, the current folder or the current list (if you 
already have files selected).  You can change the current folder by 
clicking the change folder button.

     "Once the search is complete, you can highlight any of the found 
files and perform the following:

   Open    - Opens the file as if you had double-clicked it in Finder
   Delete  - Deletes the file from disk
   Peek    - Peeks at the file's contents (NOTE: Requires FilePeeker)
   Locate  - Opens the Finder window that contains this file and
             selects this file

     "To use some of the advanced features of FileFinder, click the 
Options button.  You can search based on created date, modification date, 
file size, file type, or search only for files which contains a given text 
string.  There is also an option that allows you to add the files found in 
the search to the current list of files rather than replacing the old list. 
This allows you to perform more complicated searches such as finder all 
files that begin with the letter 'A' and end with the letter 'Z'."

     This is a nice program, and it does some things that others like it 
don't do.  One possible shortcoming is that it only works from the Finder 
Extra menu.

     Bill Tudor describes this as shareware, and requires a $10 shareware 
payment, with a catch.  If you pay him $10, you can consider it payment for 
any (or all) of his shareware programs in the A2 library.

       FINDFILE.BXY     File #10567    8820 bytes    File Finder NDA
       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     While we're talking about file finders, I must mention Steve Chick's 
excellent NDA.  Find File NDA, version 1.2, is not quite as fancy as Bill 
Tutor's program mentioned above; but, it has some pretty nifty features of 
it's own.

     First of all, since it's a NDA, it can be accessed from within any 
desktop program that gives you access to the apple menu.  Second, it 
searches for filenames in the background while you work.  It has a priority 
level option that let's you do high speed searches as well.

     As a test, I opened ShadowWrite, then selected Find File, put it to 
work hunting through my 240 meg hard drive, and then went back to 
ShadowWrite and began typing.  As I typed, I could hear the hard drive as 
Find File worked.  When it finished, it beeped and all I had to do was 
reselect it from the Apple menu to see what it had found.

     Find File is freeware.  It works with System 4.0 and above.  For you 
programmer types, the source code is supposed to be available in A2Pro.

    WW.PSINST.BXY   File #23312  179072 bytes   Physical Science files
    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     George Heatherly has provided science teachers with a collection of 
files created by teachers at the 1990 Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship 
Foundation Physical Science Institute.  The files include a number of 
activities created by the 1990 Physical Science Master Teachers to help 
improve the teaching of physical science. 

     This information was published by the Woodrow Wilson National 
Fellowship Foundation and is in the public domain.  A printed copy of the 
final curriculum module _might_ be available from the Foundation.  The 
files contained in this archive are all AppleWorks word processor files.

     While these files are aimed at the middle school level, they should 
be useful to high school teachers as well.  If you teach science, or know 
someone who does, this is a good download for you to get.

    CHASING.CAR.BXY   File #18041   49152 bytes   Cooperative Learning
    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     While we're talking about school-related files, here is one that I 
uploaded in 1992.

     The files in this upload are all connected to a middle school unit 
based on the computer program "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?" 
called "Chasing Carmen."

     Most of the word processor files are worksheets that can be used by 
individuals or teams to investigate and discover the facts needed to be 
successful at this game.  They are ready to print now.

     Two of the word processor files are lists of facts that the students 
will discover as they complete the worksheets.  They are presented to 
assist busy teachers.  However, I encourage the teachers to discover these 
facts first by playing the game and using the almanac.

     The AppleWorks data base template is designed to allow student teams 
to collect and organize Carmen facts and then use the data base to quickly 
find the info needed to play the game.  The master data base contains most 
of the information that I have collected.

     I have also included a similar set of data base files for use with 
FrEdBase for those who need or want to use this data base manager.

     This material has been used successfully with seventh graders.  It 
should be effective with anyone who finds the Carmen World game exciting.

     FENCED.IN.BXY   File #20817   13696 bytes   ProDOS Strategy Game
     ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     "Don't Fence Me In!" is a game for two players.  It is a game of 
strategy with skill in planning ahead a real plus.

     Players take turns claiming plots on a chart.  If those plots are 
located in correct proximity to other plots already claimed by the player, 
then a fence is built between the plots.  Once built, these fences act as a 
barrier to the other player.

     The object of the game for player #1 is to build a fence that 
connects the top to the bottom of the chart.  For player #2, it is to 
connect the sides.  If a player tries to claim a plot that is already 
claimed, he loses his turn.

     The game is not sophisticated enough to know when one or the other 
player has won.  Like chess, you must decide that for yourself.  There are 
no bells and whistles here, just the satisfaction of out-maneuvering your 
opponent.

     The program is copyrighted, but is offered as freeware.  Let me know 
what you think of it.

                                 [*][*][*]

     That's it for this month.  I hope you have found something here to 
whet your interest.  Drop me a line and let me know what you think of this 
column and offer any suggestions you might have about what should be in it.


     Until next time, happy downloading!

                            """"""""""""""""""
                     ~ GEnieLamp Profile:  Eric Shepherd ~

     This month we will profile a rising star in the Apple II world.  Eric 
Shepherd (a/k/a Sheppy) is a student at the University of California in 
Santa Barbara.  When he isn't doing school work (and often when he is) or 
watching movies, Sheppy is busy online or at his computer writing nifty 
programs.

GEnieLamp>   Tell us a little bit about yourself.
"""""""""

Sheppy>   I go to the University of California in Santa Barbara.  I chose
""""""    to go here because their computer science program was supposed to 
be quite good (and I suppose it is, although I like to make fun of it :), 
and because it's close to a number of relatives out here.  I'm starting my 
fifth year in a week; this should be my last year, unless the university 
does something really mean to me.

     I grew up all over the place.  This is my third time living in 
California. Lived in Texas twice (my brother was born in Texas) and in 
Colorado twice, and in Louisiana once.  We also lived in Sumatra, Indonesia 
for five years, which was quite an experience, and probably the best 
education I ever got was while I was there.


GEnieLamp>   How did you first get interested in the Apple II computer?
"""""""""

Sheppy>   When I was in the fourth grade, my school got its first computer: 
""""""    a TI 99/4.  They taught us to program it in BASIC and I had a lot 
of fun doing that.  About a year later, the school got an Apple ][+ and I 
switched to programming that.  Not long after that, the school got some 
//e's and hired a new math and computer programming teacher... who didn't 
know how to program the II.  I wound up teaching BASIC to my classmates for 
a while.  Anyway, I used Apple IIs more or less exclusively (although I was 
admittedly an MS-DOS freak for about six months... then I went into rehab 
and am just fine now).

     I didn't become a die-hard Apple II user until I first got online, 
though, and realized that there really were a lot of people out there using 
the II. That was the spring of 1991.  Until then, I really, really liked 
the II, but it wasn't the kind of strong addiction I feel now.


GEnieLamp>   Do you have any anecdotes you can share with us about your 
"""""""""    first experiences with the Apple II?

Sheppy>   Most of my anecdotes involve the fragile nature of floppy disks 
""""""    and how easy it is for a program gone horribly wrong to wipe them 
out.  I used to do that a lot (and I lost a lot of really nifty programs 
that way).  When I first got my IIgs, for instance, I only had 5.25" drives 
and 256K of memory, but I was determined to write a nifty paint program for 
the IIgs. I nuked a couple of disks trying to write that program.  
Eventually I did get a simple (but usable) paint program up and running, 
but by then I'd gotten a 3.5" drive, color monitor, and some RAM and was 
able to run some commercial stuff.

     Probably my best Apple II anecdote is a tidbit on the durability of 
these machines.  It was 8th grade computer class, and there were Apple //es 
on cheapo folding tables all over the classroom (you know the kind of table 
-- the ones they use in school lunchrooms).  A friend of mine sat down on 
one of those tables and it broke.  One of the //e's slid of the table, 
yanking the monitor and disk drives along with it, bouncing across the 
floor.  The cases were scuffed, but the machine, monitor, and drives all 
worked fine. I don't think most computers could take that kind of beating.


GEnieLamp>   Where do you see the future of telecommunications moving in 
"""""""""    the next five to ten years?

Sheppy>   "Yow!"  That's the best word to describe it.  It's impossible to 
""""""    imagine the future of telecommunications.  Five years ago, 
telecommunications was an infant field of tiny little companies and one or 
two giants.  Most of it was experimental.  The fastest modems readily 
available today are 28,800 bits per second.  Five years ago, everyone was 
just starting to make the move from 1200 to 2400 bits per second.  We're 
looking at a speed increase of immense proportions, and vastly increased 
interconnectivity of networks.  Today's networks will look puny and toylike 
compared to the networks at the beginning of the next millennium.  The 
Internet is big and growing fast, but we haven't yet reached the point 
where being online is _necessary_.  In five years we'll be there, and there 
will be nothing you can do in person that you can't do online.  Or, at 
least, not much (let's face it, a nice dinner out just isn't the same if 
you're not face-to-face :).

GEnieLamp>   How did you get started writing software?
"""""""""    

Sheppy>   I actually got started because my school required that we learn 
""""""    how to program in BASIC, and I learned that I really enjoyed it 
and was even pretty good at it (a unique pairing of positive attributes 
that just says "do it!").  I programmed entirely in BASIC for a few years, 
then learned assembly, Pascal, C, and a few other languages.  I guess it 
just sort of happened.


GEnieLamp>   Tell us about some of the software you have written for the 
"""""""""    Apple IIgs.

Sheppy>   Well, I've written mostly little utilities and such.  The first 
""""""    program I put out on the online services was ProBOOT in 1991.  
The first version I uploaded was version 3.0, and it's at version 5.2.1 
now.  ProBOOT lets you hold down the Apple key to bring up a menu that you 
can use to choose a disk to boot from.  It automatically activates the slot 
for that disk if it's switched out, and it sets the system speed up for 
you, too.

     I've written some stuff for Softdisk, such as Shifty List, which 
allows you to choose some of your favorite INITs, DAs, and control panels 
to be loaded when you shift-boot.  I like it not because it's useful (which 
it is) but because it's the kind of program you can find lots of clever 
uses for.  For instance, you can set up your system so that booting 
normally loads only a few extensions, but shift-booting loads lots of extra 
stuff.  That's kind of convenient.

     I've written a LOT of stuff, some I don't even remember writing. :)


GEnieLamp>   Shifty List is an impressive program.  Folks who don't
"""""""""    subscribe to Softdisk G-S may get it by calling Softdisk at 
1-800-831-2694 and requesting the issue containing it.

     What other platforms have you created software for?

Sheppy>   I released a couple of shareware programs for MS-DOS a few years 
""""""    back, but nothing major.  I also wrote some rather large 
professional database systems for MS-DOS in dBase and Clipper.  I've been 
futzing with writing some Mac software, but programming the Mac is 
depressing and I tend to suffer IIgs withdrawal when I do it.

GEnieLamp>   You've assumed a leadership position in the PowerPC
"""""""""    Programmer's Roundtable here on GEnie.  Please tell us a 
little about how this came about.

Sheppy>   To be honest, I don't really know how it came about.  There was a 
""""""    bunch of shuffling around of staff earlier in the year, and a few 
openings came up, and I had happened to post a couple of messages in the 
PowerPC RoundTables and had recently become very active in A2 and A2Pro, so 
I guess Dean just figured he didn't have much to lose.

     The interesting thing is that I was actually picked up as an 
assistant sysop, but there was no Chief Sysop in PPCPro at the time, so I 
was kind of performing those duties... and after a couple of months, it was 
made official.

GEnieLamp>   What do you consider your proudest accomplishment?
"""""""""    

Sheppy>   Waking up before noon today. :)
""""""    
     No, seriously, I'd have to say that my proudest accomplishment is the 
three months I spent at Apple on the Apple IIgs operating system quality 
assurance team in 1990.  It was fantastic work, and it was an honor to work 
with the folks that brought System 5.0 and 6.0 to us.  Helping to squash 
bugs in the system software was a tremendous thrill.  


GEnieLamp>   Who do you look up to as your mentors?
"""""""""    

Sheppy>   As hard as it is to believe, probably the person I most admire 
""""""    and look up to is my younger brother.  He's the kind of person 
that isn't afraid to do new things, and usually succeeds at them.  He's 
more dedicated to getting things finished than I am, and usually puts more 
work into it than I would.  When he finds something he has trouble doing, 
he just works at it harder until everything works itself out.  I wish I 
could get myself to do that sort of thing.


GEnieLamp>    Is your brother going to follow in your footsteps?
"""""""""

Sheppy>   My brother is a mechanical engineering major at the University of
""""""    Texas in Austin.  He's just started his second year.  He's going 
to be twenty on October 1.  Holy cow... I never realized that until now.  
Twenty...

     Anyway, he's going to be a ME [Mechanical Engineer], like my dad, so 
he's not following in my footsteps, which is for the best. :)  But I 
remember helping him with his math when he was in the first grade and I was 
in the fourth.  He finished the first, second, third, and fourth grade math 
courses all while he was in the first grade.  He's probably the only person 
in the world that can impress me without trying. :)


GEnieLamp>   What sorts of things do you like to do for fun (i.e.  
"""""""""    non-computer hobbies)?

Sheppy>   I like movies.  Even movies that sound really bad, once I start 
""""""    watching them, I can't stop.  I also like to read.  Science 
fiction, mostly.  And music... it's a wonderful thing.

GEnieLamp>   What new services do you think GEnie should provide its 
"""""""""    subscribers?

Sheppy>   Lower-cost 9600 access.  That's really important.  But even more 
""""""    important than that, in my book (but less likely to actually 
happen) is a faster protocol for uploading.  Regardless of whatever reasons 
GEnie might have for not supporting ZModem uploads, I can't stand XModem.

GEnieLamp>   What one piece of advice would you pass along to a new
"""""""""    Apple II telecommunications enthusiast?

Sheppy>   Don't bother trying to join America Online. :)
""""""

GEnieLamp>   With the decision by Apple to finally drop the IIgs from their 
"""""""""    price lists, many Apple II users are feeling frustrated.  What 
do you see as the future for the Apple II and its owners?

Sheppy>   I see the Apple II community slowly shrinking until it reaches a 
""""""    new stable point at which the number of users and the number of 
programmers equalizes itself again.  There will be fewer of each, but there 
will always be an Apple II community, and I hope to remain a part of it.


GEnieLamp>   Of all the freeware/shareware programs that you have released
"""""""""    here on GEnie, which are your favorites?

Sheppy>   Here's a list of my favorite programs, what they are, and why I
""""""    like them.

     ProBOOT 5.2.1  (A2 Library file #21525)
     '''''''''''''

     This is my favorite freeware/shareware release.  Of all my programs, 
ProBOOT has accumulated the most time and effort, and I never seem to run 
out of new ideas for what was originally a very simple concept.  And it's 
the first program I ever released for the Apple II.  This program also 
taught me the importance of beta-testing, because twice, ProBOOT went 
through three new versions in less than a week because of bugs.

     ProBOOT lets you pop up a list of disk drives that you can boot from 
just by holding down the Apple key when you boot your computer.  Selecting 
one of the drives will automatically enable that drive in the control 
panel, set up your system speed, and boot it.  You can do the same thing 
using a Finder extension that's included with ProBOOT.  It's a big 
time-saver when you have to boot from floppy disks a lot, especially when 
you have to boot older 8-bit Apple II programs, because the system will 
automatically slow down for you.

     SysFail Plus 2.3  (A2 Library file #23350)
     ''''''''''''''''

     SysFail is a useful tool for finding out why your system does weird 
things in the dark of night.  When your system goes really nuts and boinks 
into the system death manager, instead of the old "Fatal System Error 
$D0D0" type screen you used to get, you'll get a nice, long, descriptive 
set of information about what went wrong and why.  The information can be 
useful when complaining about bugs in programs. :)

     FixBoot 2.0  (A2 Library file #23268)
     '''''''''''

     This is one of those programs I wrote because I really needed to have 
it. The first versions of FixBoot were a 13K application you'd launch to 
put a boot block onto RAM disks.  Version 2.0 is an INIT that automatically 
puts boot blocks on all empty ProDOS RAM disks.  This is really convenient, 
because until FixBoot, you had to format any RAM disk you wanted to boot 
from.  And I used to set up lots of files on my RAM disk, then remember I'd 
forgotten to format it first.  With FixBoot installed, I don't have to 
think about it anymore.

     Cleaner Clean Up 1.0.4  (A2 Library file #21531)
     ''''''''''''''''''''''

     Actually, I don't remember what the latest version of this is, 
because I'm working on a new program that will do lots of nice changes to 
the Finder, and the features in Cleaner Clean Up are in there.  But Cleaner 
Clean Up is the program that gave me the idea of writing Finder extensions 
that added features to the Finder without actually looking like they're 
additions to the Finder.  Seamlessness.  Cleaner Clean Up, for instance, 
adds a warning message before letting you clean up the icons on your 
desktop, giving you the opportunity to avoid messing up the desktop icons.

     This idea of seamless Finder extension design is carried even further 
in SmartRestart, which was published on Softdisk G-S #52.  It actually adds 
a new menu item into the Finder's Special menu (a Restart item), to add to 
the IIgs Finder one of the few features of the Mac Finder that are better 
than the IIgs Finder.  This kind of thing, I think, makes computer easier 
to use, and that's important.


GEnieLamp>   That's an impressive list Sheppy!  For those of our readers
"""""""""    who want to find your other uploads, they should search in the

     Does anyone find this search useful?

     Now, have you done a search that may be of interest to others?  Post 
the results here.  Caution: edit the search results to put a space at the 
beginning of every line, or post using the "*SN" command instead of "*S" or 
GEnie will word-wrap the list and make it very hard to read.

     A search will turn up a topic only if its title or description includes 
the desired word.  Do you have any suggestions about editing topic titles or 
descriptions to add appropriate search terms?  Do you have any other ideas 
for making this topic useful?  The floor is open.
