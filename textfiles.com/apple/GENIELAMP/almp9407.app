Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



                 >>> WITH RIGHTS COME RESPONSIBILITIES <<<
                 """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     I should have know better.  Heck of an admission for someone who 
won't tolerate backpedaling to have to make, but it's true.

     Last month, I pointed out the absolute necessity of giving GEnieLamp 
proper credit.  It seems the only people -- a stupendous two -- who were 
stirred up enough to reply to my editorial were those who are obeying the 
rules.

     The reason I should have known better is that, during my school days, 
I frequently blushed with shame when a teacher delivered a broadcast 
lecture about sloppiness... or lack of diligence... or -- well, you get the 
picture.  I always assumed I was the intended recipient, whether my mark 
was 99 or 49... while those for whom the rather strident advice was 
intended preserved a look of insolent boredom.

     I don't want to analyze it, I just want to own that I should have 
remembered that only the wrong people actually listen to such strictures.  
Some of you may know it as preaching to the converted.

     I also want to clear up a misunderstanding and answer a few questions 
about giving proper credit.

     First, it is not necessary to reproduce the credit information 
facsimile.  One of my two correspondents complained that it was difficult 
to find a way to reproduce credit information that was 10 lines long and 73 
characters wide in a paper newsletter.  Having just put in a year as editor 
of the newsletter of the local Apple II user group, I knew immediately what 
he meant.  An article is always two paragraphs too long or two short.  The 
available copy never fits the available whitespace, particularly if it's 73 
characters wide and had to be spread across the page.

     In fact, the GEnieLamp credit is 8 lines, not 10 (you are not obliged 
to reprint our decorative borders), and need not be presented exactly as 
shown.  You can format it any way you like, so long as you don't add or 
omit anything, and as long as it's legible.  Just be sure to include it!

     Second, the messages GEnieLamp A2 reproduces from the A2 RoundTable 
in its HEY MISTER POSTMAN section:  I have been asked if it's necessary to 
credit GEnieLamp A2 when quoting a message from the RoundTable that 
appeared in GEnieLamp A2.  This is a tricky one.  The answer seems to be 
"no", but you still must ask permission and give credit to the RoundTable.

     GEnieLamp A2 doesn't own the messages it reproduces, but because it's 
sponsored both by GEnie and the A2 RoundTable (which makes me a servant of 
two masters), it doesn't have the same hassles of requiring permission to 
reproduce messages for its own purposes that other magazines have.  
Therefore, GEnieLamp A2 can reproduce the messages, but can't grant anyone 
else permission to re-reproduce them (unless you reproduce the entire 
column).  To reproduce an individual message or selection of them, you must 
contact GEnie, and/or the RoundTable, and/or the person who posted the 
message.  (Possibly I have listed them in reverse order of importance.)

     Third, it's been brought to my attention that the GEnieLamp credit 
information is relevant only to those in the United States and -- owing 
principally to me -- Canada.  Why should those in Australia, Europe, or 
Japan have to reproduce information about North American 800 numbers?

     The answer to this:  I don't know.  (Sorry, but I really get tired of 
people who only ask themselves questions designed to make them appear 
clever.)  Or more fully, I don't know, but you do have to.  I agree that it 
makes little sense, but you must do it.  If you think a rule or law is 
stupid, by all means lobby to have it changed.  But until it is changed, 
obey it.

     Finally, so much attention has been given to the reproduction of the 
copyright information that some are forgetting to mention GEnieLamp A2 
anywhere.  Please, put "Reprinted from GEnieLamp A2 (July 1994)" at the top 
of each article you reprint from this month's issue.  Please remember to 
include the precise issue you are reprinting from, and please remember that 
"A2" part, since there are also GEnieLamp A2Pro, Macintosh, IBM, Windows, 
ST....

                                 [*][*][*]


     It's time for you to bid Steven Weyhrich a fond farewell.  (I don't 
have to do it myself -- I get to keep working with him on A2-Central, which 
decreases my own personal sadness quite a bit.)  This month he's presenting 
the final installment in his Polishing Green Apple column and the last 
chapter of his Apple II History.  These two columns seem to get reproduced 
in every Anglophone Apple II newsletter in the world (usually uncredited 
<gnash gnash>).

     It's for people like Steven, who is a great guy besides being a 
talented writer, that I fight for proper credit.  (Face it, folks, nobody 
ever rips off my editorials, so my personal stake in this is minimal.)  One 
correspondent asked if I didn't have any respect for the GEnieLamp A2 
readers.  Sure I do, but not at the expense of the GEnieLamp A2 writers.  
Standing up for "your" writers comes with the job of editor.

     (I'm still not sure how preventing readers from stealing from 
GEnieLamp is showing them disrespect.  Does anyone out there know?)

                                 [*][*][*]


     Finally, a comment on our HEY MISTER POSTMAN column.  Every month, we 
reproduce -- facsimile -- spelling mistakes and all -- messages posted to 
the A2 RoundTable.  We don't editorialize; we don't summarize; we just 
reproduce the messages as posted.  (Okay, sometimes we cut parts of the 
message that quote other messages, and such.  But that's it.)

     It was this column that drew me back to GEnie, and it's our 
publisher's feeling that the column does a good job of attracting others.  
I'd like the column to be as informative as possible, for the sake of our 
readers.  Not, however, at the expense of those who post on the A2 
RoundTable.

     As I've said, GEnieLamp is a recognized part of GEnie, not some 
separate publication.  As I've said, we reproduce facsimile.  Even with 
that understanding, some of those who post on the A2 RT don't want to see 
their messages reproduced in GEnieLamp A2.  If you're among that group, 
would you please add a "Copyright 1994" or "All rights reserved" or 
something similar to your signature?

     I'm asking for a favor here.  It's NOT one of those deals where I 
stand on the mountain-top and proclaim, "If thou dost not add this to thy 
signature, I will copy thy messages and to hell with thee!"  It's just 
that, again, I find myself the servant of two masters -- those who read and 
those who post.  There just isn't any way for me to maintain a list of 
those who do and don't want to appear in GEnieLamp A2.  (Maybe the next 
versions of GEM and Co-Pilot will prevent me from archiving messages from a 
customizable list of GEnie accounts.  But I wouldn't count on it.)  I 
barely have the time to put together the HEY MISTER POSTMAN column as it 
is... and since I am putting the column together right up until deadline 
time, it's difficult to know what the final content will be.

     It's become obvious to me that there's no easy solution to this 
problem.  That means I must settle for a difficult solution.  I'd really 
appreciate the help of all who post to GEnie's A2 RoundTable in making the 
difficult solution as easy as possible.

                                 [*][*][*]


     This month, we celebrate two returns.  Our wandering boy Darrel 
Raines is back with his Golden Oldie review, and Charlie Hartley has 
provided us with a profile for our popular "Who's Who in Apple II?" 
interview series.

MINOR SPECTRUM BUG #1   GOOSE -- After you Open CaptureFile 
"""""""""""""""""""""   "FoldernameFilename", doing Close CaptureFile (via 
script or by choosing it from the menu) does result in  a bogus "syntax 
error".  That's a bug.

     A workaround is to save/clear the capture buffer before you want to  
start capturing to a file, then set the AutoSave path, set  AutoSaveBuffer 
ON, and set Append ON.  Data will come into memory, then  be purged to the 
file whenever the capture buffer fills.  When you are  finished capturing 
to a file do Save Buffer.

     You can then reset the AutoSave path to the "normal" capture buffer  
path, or set AutoSaveBuffer OFF so the user will be prompted when the  
capture buffer fills.

     I'm deep into v1.1 so don't remember offhand what problems are in 
v1.0 (they are all minor and can be worked around).  READ 16 ALL to see 
some  of the prior scripting messages.  I think the biggest tip is "do not 
mix  slash- delimited with colon-delimited filenames".

Thanks, --Dave   (SEVENHILLS, CAT43, TOP16, MSG:111/M645;1)


MINOR SPECTRUM BUG #2   If NOT Contains does have a subtle limitation: The 
"""""""""""""""""""""   first string needs to be AT LEAST as long as the 
second string (the manual states the command as: If Not Contains 
"LONGstring" "SHORTstring" Then Statement).

     I found that in actual use I'd end up with the first string being 
shorter than the second, which means the "if not contains" statement does 
not work (because it's expecting the first string to be longer) and 
therefore the Statement is not executed.

     Human logic says that if the second string is longer than the first 
string, then the second string is obviously NOT contained within the first 
string, but SPv1.0 did not have that rule check.  SPv1.1 adds that rule so 
you can more easily use the IF NOT CONTAINS command.

     For now, I think the easiest workaround is to use the "if contains" 
command and do the opposite (I believe the IF CONTAINS command works 
"logically" even if the first string is shorter than the second).

DESKTOOLS IV PROGRAM SELECTOR   I set up four programs for use with TO

they all worked as advertised.  Today, while doing a demo for the AppleJAX

"Insert AppleWorks program disk containing

     ESC does not reboot-I have to do a three finger job.

APPLEWORKS GS DB EASTER EGG   Back when I worked at Claris, I beat the 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   programmers over the heads with lead pipes 
until Tom Hoke put an Easter Egg into the DB module: if you press 
Apple-Option-H in any AWGS DB document, it toggles a mode in which the 
Enter key works the same as the Return key (i.e. it does whatever you've 
configured it to do). IMHO, this should have been the default, but Oh Well. 
BTW, you have to (temporarily) set Keyboard Translation to None in order 
for Apple-Option-H to be recognized (because of the Option key), but don't 
forget to set it back to Standard when you're done. Also, this attribute 
gets saved with the document, so you only have to do it once on a document 
to keep that behavior.

EXTENDED KEYBOARDS IN APPLEWORKS   In another topic, I had asked Randy if 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   AW would ever support extended 
keyboards.  Silly me--it already does.  When Randy posted the obvious 
answer (RTFM), I decided to program the extended keyboard keys (such as, 
page up and page down).  Here is what I came up with:

Extended keyboard macros:

<ba-t>:<all : oa-up>!     Page up
<ba-y>:<all : oa-down>!   Page down
<ba-s>:<all : oa-, >!     Home (start of line)
      or
<ba-s>:<all : oa-1)!      Home (start of file)
<ba-w>:<all : oa-. >!     End (end of line)
      or
<ba-w>:<all : oa-9>!      End (end of file)
<ba-r>:<all : oa-e>!      Insert
<ba-u>:<all : oa-del>!    Delete
<ba-x>:<all : oa-m>t!     Cut
<ba-c>:<all : oa-c>t!     Copy
<ba-v>:<all : oa-c>f!     Paste

     Of course, to get these macros to work, you have to enable keypad 
macros (from the main menu, select: Other Activities, Select standard 
settings for AppleWorks, UltraMacros options, Enable keypad macros).  If 
you want to use the keypad to enter numbers (like I do), you have to add 
the following macros:

<ba-1>:<all>1!
<ba-2>:<all>2!
<ba-3>:<all>3!
<ba-4>:<all>4!
<ba-5>:<all>5!
<ba-6>:<all>6!
<ba-7>:<all>7!
<ba-8>:<all>8!
<ba-9>:<all>9!
<ba-0>:<all>0!
<ba-rtn>:<all : rtn>!

     In adding these macros to your default macros, check carefully for 
conflicts with existing macros (e.g., ba-T for TripleMenu).

...THREW AWAY A PEARL   I recently attended a school district auction 
"""""""""""""""""""""   looking for various shop equipment from the 
industrial education programs.

     I didn't find what I came for, but instead noticed a lot called "Room 
of Electronics".

     In the _room_ was a junk heep 5 feet tall of about 25 disguarded 
computers, 50 overhead projectors and a bunch of other items left for dead.

     I noticed stacked in the middle of the heap 2 filthy Apple IIe 
systems.

     If you got the lot, you were responsible for removing the entire 
heap, and I did not care to do that.

     The entire room went for $40 (forty dollars).  I walked up to the guy 
who bought it and offered him $40 for the (2) IIe systems, thinking that 
maybe they'd be good for parts.  After all, there's no way they could be 
working, right?

     He sold me one of the IIe systems for $20 (twenty dollars), without 
the monitor.

     I brought it home, and it worked fine.  So, for $20, in essence, my 
school system sold me:

     1. Enhanced //e CPU with 128K
     2. (2) Unidisk 5.25 drives with controller card
     3. Apple Super Serial Card
     4. Microtek Printer Card

     What a crime. I'd be willing to guess that all the overhead 
projectors need was a bulb or fan motor. <no grin>

STM = APPLE II EMULATOR   Hello folks. This is a continuation of a
"""""""""""""""""""""""   conversation I started over in the CD-ROM topic 
in Cat 11.

     It seems Jim Nitchals (of Cavalier Computer fame) is in the throes of 
a major undertaking. He and others are busily writing an Apple II emulator 
to run on the Macintosh.

     Ho hum you say?

     Well, as a nice addition to go along with it, he has been busy 
contacting a lot of Apple II programmers who wrote things to get their 
permission to re- publish a lot of the classic software on a CD-ROM for 
these Mac owners who buy his emulator (called STM). I have succeeded in 
convincing Jim of the benefits of having both an HFS and ProDOS partition 
on this CD-ROM, one partition for each platform. He has only to go back to 
the authors and ask for additional permission to include their programs on 
a ProDOS partition as well as the HFS partition. With a ProDOS partition, 
even Apple IIe owners will be able to use this CD-ROM.

     Jim even went so far as to say he would welcome input. He can be 
reached at JIMN8@NETCOM.COM through GEnie's Internet mail gateway. I ask 
only that you be considerate of him, he is a busy man, after all. :) If you 
know how to reach any authors/programmers, let him know (and let =me= 
know!). If you have any suggestions, make them. :)

     This project of Jim's is almost exactly what I had in mind when we 
started the Lost Classics project. Unfortunately, I have been stymied by 
the lack of contacts, a problem which Jim is not saddled with. :)

     I am pretty psyched by the prospects, and if he is successful, it 
bodes well for keeping support for our lovable computers just a little bit 
longer.

>>>>>   STM (which stands for Stop The Madness! of all things :) is an
"""""   Apple ][+ emulator that runs on any Macintosh running System 7 or 
later.  It emulates it very nicely, including two Disk II drives (more 
later), the sound, all video modes, and everything else you can ask for.

     The Disk IIs are emulated by allowing you to select a disk image file 
to "insert" into each of the two drives.  If you want to play Karateka (and 
Karateka does work on STM), you would use a program on a real Apple II to 
copy your original Karateka disk into a disk image file, then bring that 
file over to your Macintosh and "insert" it into STM's drive 1.  Then you'd 
reset the Apple ][+ emulator by selecting the Reset option in one of the 
menus, and Karateka will boot up.

     The video is emulated perfectly, down to the funky colors you get in 
hires graphic modes when certain colors get close to each other.  Hires, 
lores, and 40-column text area all supported.

     The emulator comes with a DOS 3.3 System Master disk image embedded 
inside the STM program itself, so even if you don't insert a disk in one of 
the drives, you can boot into DOS 3.3.  It's very cool to watch good old 
AppleVision running on a Macintosh!

     You can choose to limit the emulated speed to 1 MHz, but even with 
that option disabled I have yet to get beyond 1.05 MHz, so it's not that 
big a deal.  You can double the size of the video screen's window, which is 
nice for people like me that have very high-resolution monitors.

     You can also choose to have a running display of the state of the 
emulated 6502 registers, accesses to various components of the system (such 
as language card RAM, the disk drives, and the simulated speaker).

     The sound works, and sounds very much like it does on real IIs, but 
it does tend to distort some since the emulator's speed isn't consistent -- 
it tends to wander anywhere from 200KHz to 1.1MHz on my Power Mac 8100/80.

     Everything I've heard and seen indicates that the emulation is 
excellent -- and it should be; it appears to have the actual Apple ][+ ROM 
included in it -- and that's the most fun of all... getting that good old 
BEEP and seeing "Apple ][" at the top of STM's window, followed by "DOS 3.3 
SYSTEM MASTER... LOADING INTEGER BASIC INTO LANGUAGE CARD."

     Way cool. :)

Jim and I have been talking about various ideas, and we may be able to do 
something of a limited nature.

     You must remember though, that Lost Classics' purpose is not 
necessarily to get software for the A2 library, but to preserve classic 
software and keep it available for current and future Apple II owners. 
Getting the software re- published commercially certainly meets that 
criteria. Barring re- publication, uploading into A2 is our fall-back 
position.

     Not to pick on you, but as a community, we Apple II owners will have 
to pay for what we get, one way or another, or we won't be getting anything 
more in the future.  Assuming the STM project sells for a reasonable cost, 
we will have to buy the disk, or there will likely not be any more made. 
And I have some ideas for follow-on projects which will only succeed if 
enough CD-ROMs are sold initially to make a sequel worthwhile.

text files shows the line number, saving text files now saves true tabs, AW 
now prints to a slot mapped to a hard drive, etc. Some may call many of 
these "features" bug fixes, but they weren't errors in coding, they 
required new code. There are also 20+ actual bug fixes.

There were so many changes to the master disks that I thought 4.1 was an

APPLEWORKS GS NOT ARRIVING AT ALL?   I hope that the person I talked to at

to check on the price and place an order for AWGS 2.0 and was told that the 
project had been cancelled.  Not delayed but cancelled.  I hope that I was 
incorrectly informed.  Please tell me I'm wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                   (M.EWEN, CAT42, TOP32, MSG:407/M645;1)

>>>>>   Bill Carver asked me to read the messages in this topic and post a
"""""   message about the cancellation of the AppleWorks GS 2.0 project.  
(I don't usually read this topic because Bill handles most of our online 
support on GEnie.)

     Here's the short version. The reason AppleWorks GS 2.0 has been 
canceled is inadequate source code and development documentation. A more 
detailed explanation (somewhat technical) follows.

     When we took over AppleWorks and AppleWorks GS, we assumed that 
updating AppleWorks GS was going to be a fairly straightforward task.  
Unfortunately, we were wrong.  The source code for AWGS is 7 megabytes in 
size.  Those who have seen it have called it the most poorly organized and 
documented source code they've ever laid eyes on.  Claris was unable to 
provide us with any form of documentation for the source code, nor were 
they able to provide us with their official bug list.

     The source code was designed to build under an old version of MPW 
(Macintosh Programmer's Workshop).  I have it on good authority that even 
the old MPW wasn't actually capable of compiling the source code as it was 
provided to us; it seems likely that it was compiled in pieces and then 
patched together by hand.  We did not receive any documentation on this 
process -- in fact, there probably never was any.

     To give you an idea of how bad the AWGS source was, consider that it 
took Jim Merritt, who we originally contracted to lead the project, four 
months just to get the source code Claris sent us to produce an executable 
version of AppleWorks GS 1.1.  Even then, the program was not 100% 
byte-for-byte identical with the shipping version because of the 
hand-patching which was used in the original version.

     Jim Merritt, as you may know, is no slouch.  He's the one who, 
working at Apple, coordinated the development of the IIGS System 5 Finder, 
among other things.  The original plan was for Merritt to divide the 
program among several programmers (of his choosing) and have them work on 
the project independently. Merritt would be responsible for coordinating 
things and making sure all the program segments could be combined into a 
fully functional program.

     This turned out to be an impossibility, because the source code 
simply was not arranged in any coherent fashion.  I've been told that there 
are sections of the AppleWorks GS source code which exist mainly because 
nobody knows exactly what they do -- Claris was afraid that removing them 
would cause the program to stop working!

     At around the same time another programmer decided he wanted a shot 
at it. This programmer was Bill Heineman, author of Harmonie, Out Of This 
World, and other programs, and renowned around the IIGS world as an 
extremely competent programmer.  As the weeks went by, we realized that it 
was beyond his abilities, as well.

     A third team, led by Steve Disbrow, also had a look at AWGS.  After 
spending a few weeks with the source code, Disbrow recommended to us that 
we scrap it and rewrite the entire AWGS application from scratch.  This is, 
for obvious reasons, an economic impossibility.  So, after almost ten 
months of effort by the top programmers in the IIGS world, we have 
concluded that the task of creating a major upgrade is a near-impossible 
one.

     While we are continuing to investigate ways of providing an upgrade 
to AppleWorks GS, we feel it is unfair to hold orders for a product which, 
at this point, we can't promise to deliver.  Rather than keep everyone 
holding their breath, we have decided to notify our customers that the 
project has been canceled.  If the project gets going again, we will let 
everyone know. We just don't want to get anyone's hopes up.

     This was not an easy decision for anyone here -- not just because 
we're now going to have hordes of angry customers calling us, but because 
this company WAS founded on the Apple II, and that computer remains special 
to many of us. Furthermore, as part of our contract with Claris to take 
over AWGS, we made a royalty guarantee, which basically means we're going 
to owe Claris a few hundred thousand dollars out-of-pocket if we don't 
release AWGS 2.0.

     Some of you have already told us you will never buy anything from us 
again because you feel betrayed by our actions.  That's certainly your 
privilege. Still, I think that if you stop to consider the situation, 
you'll realize that the main reason you're angry at us is that we got your 
hopes up -- which is something Claris certainly never did.  (If we had left 
the program in Claris' hands, do you suppose THEY would have produced an 
upgrade?)  We gave it our best shot.  We've done everything we could (more 
than most companies) to support Apple II users.  Some of you may see it 
differently.

     If you have AWGS 2.0 on order, you will receive a notice by U.S. Mail 
confirming the situation as I have outlined it here.  Thank you for your 
patience and support throughout our attempt to develop this upgrade.

     One final note.  In an RTC (which Harold mentioned) I referred to a 
specific programmer as being unable to deliver the product on time.  Harold 
did not mention this person's name, which I'm thankful for, but I still owe 
this programmer an apology.  In fact, it's possible that any or all of the 
programmers who worked on AWGS 2.0 might think I was referring to them.  It 
was certainly not the fault of any programmer; every one of them gave it 
their all.  My comments in the RTC were based on incomplete information and 
a sense of frustration.  My apologies.

Jerry

     PS -- If you are a IIGS programmer and feel that you can do what Jim 
Merritt, Bill Heineman, and Steve Disbrow put together couldn't do, drop me 
some e-mail and convince me.

>>>>>   Just some background for those of you who might not know
"""""   
     AWGS started out as GSWorks (or something similar) a product 
developed by a company called StyleWare. StyleWare published MultiScribe, 
MultiScibe GS, TopDraw and a couple of other programs that were really 
quite nice in their day. AWGS users would find MultiScribe GS and Top Draw 
QUITE familiar, as they served as the basis for a couple of AWGS modules.

     Claris bought out StyleWare SOLELY to get their hands on GSWorks. 
Rumour had it that they intended, among other things, to port it to the 
Mac. (Where it would have become, in theory, what ClarisWorks is now.) As 
part of the deal, Claris got the services of the StyleWare programmers, in 
part because there was no WAY they could work with that code (which was 
still Beta at the time) without the original progammers to interpret it for 
them.

     Claris later sold all the former StyleWare products to the Beagles. 
MultiScribe and MultiScribe GS became BeagleWrite and BeagleWrite GS, 
TopDraw became BeagleDraw, etc. (And Quality acquired them from the Beagles 
when THEY bit the dust.)

     The source code for AWGS goes back at least 5 or 6 years, perhaps 
more. It was developed by programmers who (no offense if they are reading 
this) were known for kludging things to force them to work if that was what 
it took to get things out the door on schedule. It has since been modified 
by programmers who didn't understand it in the first place, and had 
precious little understanding of programming the GS in the second place.

     That code is such a mess that even patching it to provide GSOS 
compatability took Claris many months, and making it "compatible" with v5.x 
took (as I recall) over a year. AWGS v1.0 will not even run under System 6, 
and just barely runs under v5.x.

     I am surprised to learn that Quality was planning on an upgrade based 
on the original code. I fully expected v2.0 to be a ground up rewrite (and 
I didn't understand how QC could afford it :).

     That's just background for anyone who might not understand how this 
code could be this ugly and hard to work with.

Gary R. Utter    (GARY.UTTER, CAT42, TOP32, MSG:493/M645;1)

>>>>>   Okay, now that all this has been said, I'm going to say everything
"""""   I've been thinking on this, so bear with me:

1. ON THE HISTORY OF AWGS   AppleWorks GS has always been a very 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''   slapped-together program.  Most of the reported 
bugs exist because of the nature of the source code.  Keep in mind that 
AWGS was originally written under ProDOS 16, and hasn't evolved much since 
then.  The few resources it used were constructed by hand because Apple had 
no tools for building them yet (and, for this reason, there is an illegal 
resource in AWGS' resource fork).

     AppleWorks GS is just BARELY working, by all descriptions I've heard 
from people that have seen the source code to v1.1.  The project was poorly 
managed while at StyleWare, and when Claris bought the project, they were 
just as appalled as Quality is at the quality of the code, but they had 
nothing to do but finish the job as best they could.  Most of the original 
programmers continued the work on v1.0v2; v1.1, however, was coded in some 
areas by new programmers that had no idea what the code was doing.

     Claris also enforced a precise release date, which limited what could 
be done -- the program shipped with a large number of known bugs.

2. QUALITY COMPUTERS AND AWGS   I applaud Quality for getting involved at 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   all (although I suspect they wouldn't have 
if they'd known the condition of the existing source code). And I hope Joe 
allows a team of programmers to make one last shot at the job.

3. THE FIRST THREE TEAMS   Looking at that list, there are a lot of very 
''''''''''''''''''''''''   talented programmers there. The only thing I can 
see that would prevent their making a strong impact on AWGS (aside from the 
massiveness and twistedness of the code) is the fact that, unless I'm 
mistaken, all of them have jobs and/or are extremely busy people.  They may 
quite simply not have had the time to work on it -- especially when it's so 
big.

4. THE FOURTH TEAM   My name has been mentioned in this discussion, so I'll 
''''''''''''''''''   comment.  The same day the rumors started flying, I 
emailed Quality and offered to work on AWGS, and was given a non-negative 
response (I'm being intentionally vague here).  A good number of 
programmers have expressed interest, and a lot of us are talking amongst 
ourselves about how we would go about the project if and when we get 
involved in it.

5. THE FUTURE OF AWGS   Personally, I think a more reasonable goal for AWGS 
'''''''''''''''''''''   would be to hold off on version 2.0 until after a 
minor upgrade, v1.2, is done.  This would provide an intermediate solution 
to users so they would have a more stable and System 6-friendly version of 
AWGS while, at the same time, familiarizing the programming team with the 
source code.  Then, and only then, would we tackle a version 2.0.  This is, 
of course, all assuming Quality were to agree -- it's their money.

     All of this has been my own opinion and viewpoint on the issue.  
Don't bother Quality or anyone else because of anything I said here.

     One last thing -- I tend to believe Quality will permit one last team 
to give AWGS a shot.  They can't lose anything if they do, and it might 
just save them a potentially large amount of money.  However, I don't speak 
for Quality -- or for anyone else other than myself.

QUICKIE 3.2 WITH MORE TOOLS
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                         Vitesse, Inc.
Friday, June 10, 1994                                    (818) 813-1270


                    VITESSE ANNOUNCES QUICKIE(R) 3.2

LA  PUENTE, CA -- Vitesse, Inc. announced today the release of  Quickie
3.2,  an update to their popular hand scanner system for the Apple  II.
This  latest  version  incorporates new  imaging  techniques  for  more
enhanced, sharper images than ever before.  It also contains a powerful
collection  of  image  editing  tools.  Originally,  these  tools  were
provided  to  permit  simple  cleanup of scanned  images,  to  manually
eliminate  imperfections which might be introduced  by  dust  or  other
impediments  encountered during the scanning process.  In  this  latest
release, these tools were expanded to permit more complex image editing
tasks, but continued to emphasize manual image manipulation.

With Quickie 3.2, several automatic image processing features have been
introduced.  These features can be used in combination with the  manual
tools,  or with each other, to achieve a variety of effects with little
effort.  These effects range from minor changes in resolution (Blur and
Sharpen)  to  the bizarre and surreal (Laplacian, Sobel, Negative,  and
image combinations).  Most of these effects are produced using an image
processing  technique called "filtering," while a few actually  combine
two images to produce a new effect.

The  filters  implemented in Quickie 3.2 operate  only  on  a  selected
portion of the image, and fall into three categories:  Unary, Linear or
Nonlinear.  A Unary filter simply applies a conversion formula to  each
pixel  of  the affected image individually, changing each  pixel  in  a
uniform,  predetermined way.  A Linear filter operates on a  region  of
pixels surrounding each pixel to be changed, using a linear function of
the  values of the surrounding pixels to alter the value of the current
pixel.   Linear filters always take the longest time to  process.   The
Nonlinear  filters implemented in Quickie 3.2 also examine  the  pixels
surrounding  the current pixel, but simply choose one  of  these  pixel
values to replace it.  While much quicker, Nonlinear filters are not as
fast  as  Unary  filters.   The many filters included  in  Quickie  3.2
include:   Negative, Blur, Blur More, Sharpen, Sharpen More, Laplacian,
Emboss  Raised, Emboss Inset, Sobel Horizontal (vertical and diagonal),
Gaussian  Blur, Median Filter, Minimum Filter, Maximum Filter,  Closing
Filter, and Opening Filter

Quickie  3.2  provides several functions which combine  two  images  to
create a new one.  To enable them, you must Cut or Copy all or part  of
an image  to  the  Clipboard, then Paste it into your  target  picture.
These  Image  Combinations  include Add  Images,  Average  Images,  and
Subtract  Images.  Add Images adds the pixel values of the  source  and
target  images, Average Images takes the average of pixel  values,  and
Subtract Images subtracts pixel values.

Quickie  3.2 also incorporates a technique called, "toning," which  was
initially  introduced in Quickie 3.1 as an Easter Egg.   Toning  allows
the  user  to  select the monochromatic palette of their  choice.   The
available  palettes  were  drawn from the  world  of  black  and  white
photography,  where special chemicals can turn grays in a normal  black
and  white picture into changes of brown or Sepia, blue, green, or red.
Other processes merely "warm" or "cool" the grays by subtly introducing
the  slightest  hint  of  red or blue without noticeably  altering  the
picture s color.  Selenium toning warms the grayscale palette slightly.

Quickie  3.2  requires an Apple IIgs running GS/OS  v5.0.4,  or  later;
1.5MB RAM if running GS/OS v5.0.4, or 2MB RAM if running System 6.0, or
later; a 3-1/2" floppy disk drive; a hard disk drive is recommended.

becuase it could easily be converted to Wolf 3D.  I have a copy of it since 
I was one of the testers.  It really required an acellerator to play it, 
but it worked great.

     Bug Softdisk about it.  Maybe they're finally release it.  It's  a 
shame since it was basicly finished.  Just a few last minute things needed

"""""   because it was never finished by the author.  It wasn't "shelved", 
and it wasn't "basicly finished".  There were more than "Just a few last 
minute things needed to be completed".

     It is a cool game, but it is NOT "too fancy a title for Softdisk". 
Indeed, Softdisk wrote the original game for the PC (and in fact, it was 
done by the same folks that did W-3D and Doom, before they stopped working 
at Softdisk).  And it certainly wouldn't "make all [Softdisk's] puzzle 
games pale in comparison!"  Softdisk puts out a variety of programs, and 
this is one more of them.  Catacombs is OUR game, designed BY Softdisk, FOR 
Softdisk.

doesn't finish things, they can't be released.  Anyone that wants to see 
this cool technology should bug Bill to finish it.

CO-PILOT HISTORY LESSON   To sum it up......
"""""""""""""""""""""""

     1.  A2 acquired the rights to CoPilot from Ken about a year ago.

     2.  The version we acquired was v2.1

     3.  We released that version with some tuned up scripts, specifically 
to deal with changes in the GEnie logon that took place last July.  To 
differentiate between that and the original , we called it v2.1.1, This is 
the current OFFICIAL release version. :)

     4.  As soon as v2.1.1 was out, we started working on some SIGNIFICANT 
enhancements to the scripts.  I had the overly optimistic idea that these 
could be finished by Labor Day weekend (LAST year).

     5.  I sent the source code to Harold, with the idea that we wanted to 
make some small changes to the program itself to work better with the new 
scripts.  THAT opened a whole 'nother can of worms.

     6.  We FINALLY released the enhanced scripts for Christmas.  We 
released them as "open Beta" simply to get them in the hands of the users, 
knowing that there were a few small bugs in them that we hadn't pinned down 
yet.

     7. We released two more versions of the "open beta" scripts, and the 
ones that are currently available are pretty good.  There are a couple of 
real small bugs (i.e. bugs that will not bother 99% of the people), and 
those are fixed now, but the fixed scripts have not been released.  They 
WILL be in the final release, which is now only a few weeks away.

     8.  Due to Harolds patching on v2.1 of CoPilot, we have eliminated 
the final problem (from the scripters point of view) which was that the 
program itself wrote two of the necessary scripts, and the scripts it wrote 
had problems with such things as 9600 access.

     9.  Harolds patches were not able to eliminate a few known bugs in 
the CoPilot application (such as the fact that the program will lose the 
"archive prefix" for some users for no apparent reason).  However, he was 
able to alter several things to make the program more usable, such as the 
limitation on Email adressing which prevented the use of Internet mail 
adresses in the mail module.

     10.  His most recent change resulted in the need for a couple of new 
scripts to be written.  So far, these seem bug free (they're pretty simple) 
but we want to send them out to our Beta testers this week for final 
approval.

     11.  If all goes well in the Beta cycle this week, then CoPilot 
v2.5.0 is finished. (FINALLY! :)

     12.  Harold still needs to write the new Installer scripts, but his 
depends in part on his having an exact list of what scripts and other files 
are to be Installed, and THAT depends in part on the result of the final 
Beta cycle.  (if a serious bug crops up, it might result in the need for 
one or two more new scripts, short ones).  SO, once we are absolutely final 
on the total number of scripts, and the names of those scripts, Harold can 
write the Installer, and we can turn it loose.

     14.  (that's right, there is no 13 :)  If all goes well in the next 
week, we will have v2.5.0 available in the library for the 4th of July. If 
more problems crop up, we will STILL have it available before Kfest.  (Call 
it July 15th.)

     15. The "CoPilot II" rewrite will be officially named CoPilot v3.0 
when it is released.

     PowerGuide 1.0, the navigator for the next millennium, adds to it's 
versatility.  Besides staying compatible with major telecom programs, it 
can be used as a standalone GEnie navigator as well.  PowerGuide is the 
first and only one to achieve this ulimate goal.  And it is available for 
your GS.  So no matter which telecommunication program you use or don't 
use, you can now access GEnie from one convenient place and stay in control 
all the time.

     PowerOnline is a set of scripts to interface with GEnie.  These 
scripts are written and maintained by premier script writer Glenn W. 
Hoffman, assisted by Kevin P. Reid.

     Of course, this is a big project, and by far not finished, but what's 
currently available suits about 80 - 90% of what you need in the A2 BB.

     Even though we tested this interface for several month now, we are 
releasing this stand-alone interface project as beta right now to gain more 
experience on other systems as well. So if you want to help us making the 
coolest navigator around even better, please support us in beta testing, 
thanks.

     I've made my best effort in the time available. There are 6000 
articles, with a total of 30,000 sections; about 7000 images, hundreds of 
digitized audio clips and other assorted goodies such as spreadsheet-style 
tables. There are some features that are not currently feasible on the GS, 
such as the 'Atlas' feature (it makes a Mac LC II crawl). Movies are not 
currently supported either, but I have reason to expect this to change in 
the future.

     There are a few other misc. features I haven't had time to figure 
out, and depending on sales I will go back in & finish them up.

     The color imaging seems to work quite a bit better than on the 
previous discQuest titles, for a number of reasons.

> But every day there are less vendors, less programer, less support.

     As a programmer who is STILL supporting ONLY the Apple IIGS, I get 
VERY tired of people who complain about lack of Apple II support.  Softdisk 
G-S is a quality product, putting out cool new games, new productivity 
software, new system extensions, new patch programs, new fonts, new clip 
art, new templates, and new ideas every month.  GS+ is another publication 
putting out great original software on a periodical basis.  If you don't 
subscribe to SDGS or GS+, then you have NO RIGHT to complain about there 
not being enough vendors, programmers, or support... because you are not 
taking advantage of what IS available.

     If you are starving to death, you may complain about the famine, but 
not if you're turning up your nose at all the food at the grocery store!

     The news is out folks (okay, it's still a rumor officially.)

     FLEX will be adopting the new terminology standard suggested by 
Windows Sources in their latest June issue.  The Bureau for Avoiding 
Lexically Offending Neologisms Engineered Yesterday has set down 
regulations designed to make sure that any words used to describe software 
or hardware do not unintentionally offend anyone.

     Following are some of the changes:

     1)  Hard disk drives will now be referred to as tumescent disk drives.

     2)  Floppy disk drives shall be now called relaxed disk drives.

     3)  Software bugs are now new features.

     4)  Fatal software bugs are now special features.

     5)  System crashes will be rephrased as upgrade opportunity.

     6)  The turbo/slow button on a system will now be called     
         turbo/megahertz-challanged button.

     7)  A drive's FAT, formally File Allocation Table, will now be called 
         HEFTY, How Each File Takes Yards.

     8)  For the computer manufacturer, the on/off switches must now be 
         both child proof and accessible to arthritic users.

     9)  The BIOS, Basic Input/Output System will be replaced with the 
         less graphic BMCES, Basic Mutually Consenting Exchange System.

     10) For software developers, screen color schemes are required to 
         include black, brown, red, yellow, and white in an accurate 
         reflection of the racial makeup as recorded in the 1990 U.S. 
         Census.

     Please input your comments on the new standard being implemented.  
Thank you.

          >>> SOME THOUGHTS ON THE NATURE OF HUMAN FELLOWSHIP <<<
          """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The other day I was a surfing around the Internet when I came across 
a really interesting USENET newsgroup.  (For those who might not know, a 
USENET newsgroup functions in the same capacity as an international 
bulletin board system.  People can read and post messages on any one of 
several hundred newsgroup topics.)

     The newsgroup I encountered focussed on the subject of autism.  Most 
of the messages posted to this newsgroup were by parents and relatives of 
autistic persons.  It was fascinating to read the questions people posed, 
and the answers given in response.

     Even more interesting was the fact that the people posting to this 
newsgroup were scattered all around the globe.  So a parent in Amarillo, 
Texas could be posting a message to the newsgroup one day, and hear a 
response from an autism researcher in Italy the next day.

     What struck me particularly about this newsgroup is the way it served 
to connect persons of shared interest.  Being the parent of a special needs 
child can be an intensely isolating experience at times.  Who can you turn 
to when you have questions about your child?  The child's pediatrician, of 
course, can help answer some of the medical questions a parent might have.  
But few doctors have the time or patience to answer the myriad questions a 
parent with a special needs child might have.

     Who better to help answer your questions than parents in a similar 
situation?  They have been where you are now and have encountered what you 
are now encountering.  If nothing else, they can lend a sympathetic ear and 
offer the type of general nurturing advice that we all need at times in our 
lives.

     I was also interested to note that not all was calm and harmonious in 
the autism newsgroup.  Several disagreements and disputes flared from time 
to time.  Surprising?  Not really.  People have different views about 
things.  It's natural that they might disagree at times.  Disagreements can 
even be productive, for they force us to carefully re-examine the 
supporting reasons for our points of view.

     To be sure, a fate worse than disagreement and discord is isolation 
and silence.  Imagine having an autistic child and living in a country 
without established online networks.  Suppose you lived in rural Pakistan?  
Chances are that the phone lines in rural Pakistan, where present, are not 
good enough to support the use of a modem.

     Suppose, further, that the closest village is a five mile walk from 
yours.  And that the closest town is a full day's journey.  And that a trip 
to the capital city would take three days to travel there and back.

     Now suppose that you find out that your newborn child has special 
needs.  Need not be autism; it could be any special need.  Your sense of 
isolation would be intense, immediate, and all-encompassing.  No person to 
turn to.  No place to go to seek friendly advice.  The isolation could seem 
overwhelming, even for one accustomed to living in a remote locale.

     What online communications has to offer is fellowship.  Fellowship is 
one of the most primal of human needs.  Fellowship is the glue that holds 
society together.  We engage in fellowship when we gather around to 
celebrate a birthday, to rejoice at a wedding, to mourn at a funeral. 
Fellowship is chatting with a fellow human being on the street corner.

     That street corner has expanded in dimensions in recent years.  
Anyone with a modem can share fellowship with several million other persons 
who are online.

     As I reflected upon the autism newsgroup, I noted the bittersweet 
irony of a newsgroup on autism.  Autism is a neurological condition that 
can make a person less aware of the social dimensions of our existence.  
Persons with more severe forms of autism live in an isolated world whose 
boundary extends no more than a few millimeters beyond their skin.

     It's not that such persons don't want to experience the joys of 
fellowship with other human beings.  It's just that their brains are not 
wired for such experiences to take place.

     Those of us who do have the capacity to experience fellowship should 
seize the chance to share ourselves with others.  Whether via phone, via 
modem, or in person, seize those opportunities to be a human being among 
human beings.  As social creatures, we become most human when we share our 
being with others.

                    >>> HOOKED ON STORAGE (Part 5) <<<
                    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


HOOKED ON ORGANIZATION   After getting your hard disk installed, formatted,
""""""""""""""""""""""   partitioned, and the disk management software put 
into place, an important consideration is how to organize your files to 
make them as easy to find as possible.  There are as many different methods 
of arranging your directories as there are methods of housecleaning; I will 
suggest what makes sense to me, and you can adapt that to your own 
specifications.


DESKTOP VS. DISK   First of all, remember that there is an important
""""""""""""""""   distinction between "memory" and disk storage.  I've 
talked with people who told me that they had a computer with 4 megs of 
memory and 40 megs of memory.  What they really had was a computer with 4 
megs of RAM, AND a hard disk (for storage of data) that could hold up to 40 
megs of data.  RAM is where a program RUNS (is "executed").  Disks are used 
to STORE programs or data files.  They are NOT the same.  This is important 
to remember, if you want to keep the computer bullies from kicking sand all 
over your keyboard.

     Consider this illustration.  Imagine a desk, with a surface on which 
to work, and drawers for storing things.  You might put papers on your 
desktop to work on, doing tasks such as reading, writing, sorting, 
stapling, shredding, coloring with crayons, cutting out paper dolls, and so 
on.  When you are done with your papers, you put them into a file drawer in 
the desk for safekeeping and easy retrieval.  While your papers are in the 
file drawer, you cannot very well work on them in the ways that were listed 
above.  But you also cannot keep ALL your papers out on the desktop where 
you can work on them, as eventually it would get overcrowded and you would 
lose things.

     To connect the above example to a computer, the desktop refers to 
your RAM memory.  The larger your RAM memory, the more documents (or 
programs) you can handle at a time.  If you have a small amount of memory 
(a small desktop) you may be able to handle only a single document or 
program at a time.

     The file drawer refers to your disk storage.  If you have a small 
space in a drawer for storage, you may need many different individual 
drawers in which to store your papers.  If you have several large drawers, 
you will have more space to store your papers, but it will require more 
work to organize them in a way that makes it easy to find them again.


ESTABLISHING ORDER   The analogy of a file drawer also takes us into the
""""""""""""""""""   realm of ORGANIZATION of a storage system.  Just as 
the file drawers in a desk require some sort of structure to keep track of 
the papers within, so also does a hard disk demand structure to help keep 
track of files efficiently.

     When a file drawer is small, organization is less necessary.  You can 
easily see the few folders that are there, and it is not difficult to 
quickly locate and retrieve an item.  When the number of folders gets 
beyond a certain point, however, it becomes more time-consuming to find the 
particular folder you want, unless it is arranged in some order that makes 
sense to YOU.  (Note that the method of organization does not necessarily 
have to make sense to anyone else; as long as YOU can find what you want 
quickly, then it is appropriately organized for YOU.)

     This organization can be in the form of dividers to separate 
different types of folders (correspondence, bills, insurance, financial, 
and so on), or perhaps just alphabetizing everything.  You generally must 
decide on a maximum number of folders within a category that are 
manageable, and when they go beyond that number of folders it is time to 
subdivide.  Also, the size of a folder depends on how many papers can be 
placed within it before it gets too heavy or fat to handle.  (In my medical 
office, we must occasionally divide our patient charts if they become too 
large.  It is not a pretty sight when a large, stuffed folder falls to the 
floor and explodes.)

     On a computer, there are two basic ways of keeping your files on a 
disk.  A "flat" structure just puts ALL the files in the same place.  As 
with a few folders in the file drawer, this is fine, as long as there are 
only a few data files to keep track of.  The older DOS 3.3 operating system 
for the Apple II could ONLY work in a flat structure, and so a printed 
catalog of a disk that contained many small files could run to several 
pages, usually with the files in no particular order.  To try to deal with 
this limitation, a method was devised of creating "dividers", which were 
actually dummy file entries, usually in inverse type (black letters on 
white) to separate different types of files.  Maintaining this required a 
utility that could sort the filenames on a disk, to keep the correct files 
within their boundaries.

     Here is an example of a flat file list:

     /Disk1   <--- This is the name of the disk volume
          Letter.1
          Burger.Alert
          Letter.59b
          Eviction.Note
          MegaData.System
          Letter.2
          MD.Data.1
          MD.Data.2
          Space.Raiders
          Bozo.Graphics

     There is no particular order to these files, and they don't have much 
in common.  Of course, the user could just as easily put the games on one 
disk, the word processing files on another disk, and so on.  In this 
example, the number of files is still manageable, and would not really NEED 
any further organization.  But as the number of files becomes larger, 
finding the particular one that is wanted will get more difficult.


ORDER WITH EXPANSION   With the advent of the ProDOS operating system in
""""""""""""""""""""   1984 (which was taken directly from the older SOS 
system used on the Apple III when it appeared in the late 1970s), a 
slightly different approach was taken.  Although the flat structure could 
still be used, there was a limit of 51 files that could exist in the main 
(or root) directory of a disk.  To store more files, it would be necessary 
to make use of a "hierarchical" system.  This system allows creation of 
subdirectories (similar to using a separate file drawer in a filing 
cabinet).  These subdirectories were not limited to a single level; they 
could go as "deeply" as there was room for the name that defined that 
drawer.  (This was limited to 63 characters, including the "/" that was 
used to separate subdirectory levels.)  Within each subdirectory, files 
were handled in just the same way as in the flat system; the filenames 
typically appeared in a list that was specific for ONLY that subdirectory.

     Here is an example of an entire hierarchical file list:

     /Disk1
          /Data
               MegaData.System
               MD.Data.1
               MD.Data.2
               Letter.2
          /Word
               MegaWord.System
               Letter.1
               Letter.59b
               Eviction.Note
               Letter.2
          /Games
               Burger.Alert
               Space.Raiders
          /Graphics
               Bozo.Graphics

     Notice in this example that the file "Letter.2" is present in more 
than one subdirectory.  As long as it is in a different subdirectory, there 
can be more than one file on the disk with the same name, even completely 
different types of files.  This would not be possible if the disk was using 
only a flat file system (as in DOS 3.3, for example).

     When displaying this list of files on one level only, the top or root 
level of the directory looks like this:

     /Disk1

     Data
     Word
     Games
     Graphics


     A display of the files in the Data subdirectory would look like this:

     /Disk1/Data

     MegaData.System
     MD.Data.1
     MD.Data.2

and so on.  Within any subdirectory, the files are displayed in a "flat" 
format; however, it is possible to change to another directory and access 
THOSE files also, still in the flat format.

     Notice that at the top of the root directory shown above is the name 
of the disk, "/Disk1".  In the ProDOS method of organizing disks, the start 
of a "path" to a file begins with a slash to indicate to the system that 
this is the name of a disk, rather than the name of a file or subdirectory. 
When the "Data" subdirectory was displayed, the name shown was 
"/Disk1/Data".  Again, a slash is used, but here to indicate that the file 
"Data" (a subdirectory) is under the directory "/Disk1".  This "pathname" 
specifies to the computer the path it must take to find a file on a disk. 
The full pathname for the file named "MD.Data.1" would then be 
"/Disk1/Data/MD.Data.1"

     Under GS/OS on the Apple IIgs, the same format is used, but the colon 
typically is used as a separating character, just as is done on the 
Macintosh.  Either the "/" or ":" character is acceptable in a pathname, 
but they cannot be mixed (i.e., :Disk1:Data:MD.Data.1 is acceptable; 
:Disk1:Data/MD.Data.1 is NOT).

     Finally, understand that there can be as many subdirectories in a 
pathname as you can fit, as long as the total number of characters is less 
than the limit.  Since there is a limit of 63 characters in a pathname 
under ProDOS, the deepest that subdirectories could be nested would be 29 
levels, with each one a having only single letter name (i.e., "A", "B", 
"C", etc).  The top level would be the root directory, also a single letter 
name, and the name of the file could only be a single letter.  The full 
pathname for such a file would be:

/A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/A/B/C/D/E

     In this example, the disk volume name is "/A", which has a 
subdirectory named "B" under it, which has a subdirectory named "C" under 
it, and so on down to a deeper subdirectory named "D".  Within that 
subdirectory is the file, named "E".  (If you REALLY need to be organized 
down to THAT deep a level, you need to be referred to 
Obsessive-Compulsive's Anonymous.)


WHAT GOOD ARE PATHNAMES?   To get the most use out of the hierarchical 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   filing system that ProDOS provides, it is best 
to use sensible names that are not too long, but are long enough to tell 
what they are for.  This makes it easier to find the program or file that 
you want.

     For example, I have the subdirectories on part of my hard disk 
organized in this fashion:

   /C                              : Disk Volume Name

     This is not necessarily the BEST method of setting up a hard disk, 
but it works well for me.  Notice that I have placed the various types of 
AppleWorks files within a subdirectory named "FILES", and beneath THAT 
level is another set of subdirectories that hold more files in a fashion 
that makes sense to me.  To find the A2 News Digest for July 1993, I just 
use the path "/C/WORD/FILES/NEWS/NEWS.GENIE.9307".  If a subdirectory gets 
too large (too many files to quickly find them), my personal preference is 
to subdivide it and make another subdirectory with files as similar as 
possible grouped within it.  Since I don't care to make paper copies of the 
contents of my subdirectories, it is both easier and faster for me to have 
no more than one or two screens of filenames (i.e., 20-40) to review when 
looking for a file.


FINALE   The main thing I want you to take away from this month's article
""""""   is to consider some sort of organization when planning how you 
will use a hard disk.  It will simplify your daily use of it later, when 
you begin to accumulate more and more files.

     In this series I have gone through the process of selecting, setting 
up, and using a hard disk on the Apple II and IIgs.  Although there is 
still more to be said about OTHER aspects of using Apple II computers, my 
available time for writing articles has become considerably more limited in 
recent months, and so I will at this time have to bid you goodbye for now. 
This is the twelfth article in the "Polishing Green Apples" series, and I 
hope that they have been useful to you.  Apple II Forever!

Apple II Hybrids
""""""""""""""""

  [J.CURTIS8]



              >>> THE MACINTOSH LC/IIE HYBRID (Continued) <<<
              """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     One can make a very good case for the statement that virtually all of 
Apple's success has depended upon the Apple II.  The company was founded 
with the Apple II product line.  It was the Apple II that kept Apple in 
business during its failed experiment with the Apple III.  While the first 
Macs struggled to carve out their own market niche, the Apple II was there 
as Apple's bread and butter machine.  Finally, the slim-lined, LC-style 
Macs -- which now have become Apple's best selling computers -- may well 
have failed if Apple had not initially sold three-quarters of them as 
hybrid systems with the Apple IIe PDS (Processor Direct Slot) card.

     Considered only as a Macintosh, the LC was something of a hybrid by 
itself.  Fitted with Motorola's 68020 microprocessor, the LC had a Mac 
II-level color display.  However, without the Mac II's math coprocessor, 
the LCs ran like the slower Mac SE/30.  Having one processor-direct slot, 
they were somewhat expandable like a Mac II, but they could also be 
considered plug-and-play like a Mac Classic.  Today's LC-style Macs 
continue to use essentially the same motherboard and PDS setup as the 
original LCs, but all of them run much faster with Motorola's 68030 and 
68LC040 microprocessors.

     The newest LCs have not only increased in speed, but they have also 
increased their RAM and hard disk storage over the original models.  The 
originals were sold with 2MB, expandable to 10MB, while today's 
68LC040-based machines are sold with 4MB and can be expanded to a whopping 
36MB! While few users may need that much memory, today's graphic-based, 
memory-hungry, Macintosh system software and applications benefit mightily 
from all the RAM that they can access.(1)  The LC's basic, internal hard 
drive has grown over the past three years from 40MB to 80MB, with larger 
drives optionally available.  Finally, the original LC's basic 256K video 
RAM has grown to 512K, and it is optionally expandable to 1MB... enough for 
32,000-color capability on 14 inch monitors.

     Potential buyers should keep in mind that the amount of memory and 
speed will tend to vary with the LC-style model selected in the Performa, 
Quadra, and LC lines.  Additionally, it should be kept in mind that while 
the LC's Macintosh side has grown in memory, storage and speed, there have 
been essentially NO changes in the IIe PDS card's capabilities.  Maximum 
RAM accessible by the IIe PDS card remains 1MB and the PDS card's 65C02 
microprocessor continues to run at 1 mhz in normal mode.

     It seems useful to compare the IIe PDS card with the PC Transporter 
card.  Both cards require their respective host computer's system software 
to manage most I/O functions, but management of video output is handled 
quite differently between the two.  While the PCT card sidesteps ProDOS and 
communicates directly with the monitor with its own on-board, CGA video 
controller, the LC's PDS card uses the Mac's system software to provide a 
IIe video display.  The IIe card possesses its own on-board ROM that 
translates IIe video output to the Mac's "Quickdraw" graphics language.  
The video output is subsequently handled like any other Mac video by the 
Mac's system software and microprocessor.(2)

     Like the PCT and Trackstar cards, the Apple IIe PDS card possesses 
its own external disk drive connector.  This connector allows both 3.5" 
and/or 5.25" ProDOS devices to be directly connected to the card.  The IIe 
PDS card requires a 3.5 UniDisk drive.  However, for most LC/IIe hybrid 
users there is probably no advantage to connecting a UniDisk 3.5 drive to 
the IIe card, because the IIe card's system software also allows access to 
the Mac's own high density Superdrive as a ProDOS device.  Also, like the 
PC Transporter and Trackstar, the Mac's IIe emulation allows for use of its 
host computers' hard disk drive for storage of programs and data.(3)

     The IIe PDS card possesses most of the important hardware components 
of a IIe, including the 65C02 microprocessor, 128K of on-board RAM, and a 
ROM chip with Applesoft BASIC installed.  However, without the special IIe 
card software and Mac operating system, the card would be useless as a IIe.  
Three essential IIe card files ("IIe Startup," "IIe Prefs," and 
"Basic.System") must be installed on the LC's hard disk before the IIe PDS 
card can be booted and run.(4)  An optional fourth file, called "ProDOS 
File System," resides in the Mac's system folder and enables the Mac to 
display and manipulate ProDOS disks, directories and subdirectories on its 
desktop.  However, many users have found in the past that this file can 
interfere with file translation between HFS and ProDOS on the Mac desktop, 
and they have chosen not to include this file in their installation.(5)

     The special IIe card software file called "IIe Prefs" is required in 
order to store information about how the user wishes their IIe card to be 
configured.(6)  Configuration is done through the IIe card's control panel, 
which is called the "IIe Option Panel".  This control panel is a Macintosh 
menu that is separate from the Mac's own control panel.  The Option Panel 
is accessed similarly to the IIgs and Mac control panels by simply using 
the mouse to point and click on desired options and features.

     The "IIe Option Panel" is really the heart of the LC's IIe emulator.  
Virtually every functional aspect of a real IIe can be managed with the 
Option Panel.  The user metaphorically configures slots in the Option Panel 
by dragging and dropping icons (which represent peripheral devices or 
cards) into graphic representations of IIe slots.  There are icons for 
printers, a mouse, clock, block storage devices, network card, modem, and 
memory card which can be moved around in these phantom slots.  The IIe 
emulator's slot 5 can additionally be configured for four smartport storage 
devices.  Also, any of the IIe's 7 slots can be set for startup, or the 
user can select "scan". 

     In addition to phantom slot management, the IIe Option Panel is also 
used to configure serial ports, keyboard and mouse response, system speed 
in "normal" or "fast" mode and the startup sound setting.  The IIe screen 
display can be set for monochrome or color, and the text display can be set 
for black characters on a white background or for normal white characters 
on a black background.  All of these settings, phantom slots and devices 
correspond to the LC's own settings, ports and devices, with the exception 
of those devices which are connected to the IIe card's own disk drive 
connector.  By making slot changes, the user basically tells the PDS card 
and software how they want the Mac's IIe emulation to represent itself to 
the IIe software.

     Telecomm users have reported that the LC/IIe is simply not suitable 
for running 8-bit, Apple II communication programs.  Even Apple's "IIe Card 
Owner's Guide" reports that the user may experience problems when trying to 
"use modems at a baud rate of 2400 or above".  Apple says, "you may be able 
to solve the problem and still use a higher baud rate" by selecting 
"Monochrome" in the Option Panel.(8)  However, Apple makes no promises, and 
GEnie users have reported no luck in their attempts get adequate 
performance out of their Apple II telecommunication programs with the IIe 
card.  One obvious solution is to use the Mac side of the hybrid for 
telecomm.  The downside, according to many GEnie A2 members, is that few 
Mac comm programs can match the better Apple II programs like ProTERM.(9) 

     Many AppleWorks users, especially those who are used to working on an 
unaccelerated IIe or IIc, will find that the LC/IIe hybrid will exceed 
their requirements for an AppleWorks power system.  Hard disk storage can 
be configured for up to 4 ProDOS partitions or 120MB.(7)  Improved speed in 
program execution can be achieved by doing three things:  First, the "Fast" 
setting in the LC/IIe's control panel will increase the card's processing 
speed to double that of a standard IIe.  Next, additional performance can 
be realized by selecting the "monochrome" rather than the "Color" setting 
in the Option Panel's "Display" menu.  Finally, if you don't need ALL of 
the 1MB RAM available to the IIe card, use a RAM disk for running 
AppleWorks. 

     I use AppleWorks at home on an unaccelerated GS in "Fast" mode.  At 
work, I run AppleWorks from a RAM disk on an LC-III with IIe card set to 
"Monochrome" display and "Fast" mode.  I have noticed some slight 
degradation of AppleWorks' performance on the LC/IIe, compared to the GS, 
but not enough to be an irritant, and the advantages of being able to print 
AppleWorks documents effortlessly over a Mac network to a Laser printer 
seem to balance things out nicely.  On the Macintosh side, the ability to 
import an AppleWorks document to MicroSoft Works and print it out using the 
Mac's superior fonts is also a very positive advantage. 

     Next month, in our final hybrid series article, we'll take a hard 
look at the future of Apple II computing.  We'll talk about what's involved 
in running software emulations on the new "Power" RISC systems 
(potentially, the ultimate hybrid computers), and we'll solicit the 
opinions of some of our GEnie A2 members and programmers to see what they 
think is the likelihood of an Apple IIe or IIgs emulation for the Power 
Mac.  Until then, think hybrid!


                                   NOTES
                                   """""

(1) From this writer's own experience, the standard 4MB found in the latest 
    machines is insufficient.

(2) Another way of saying this is:  When you look at IIe software running 
    on a Mac PDS card, you're looking at a Macintosh's INTERPRETATION of a 
    IIe video display.  However, when you look at PC software running on a 
    IIgs' PCT card, you're looking at a REAL, digital PC display, not 
    mediated or interpreted by ProDOS.  For the most part, however, no one 
    should be concerned about these differences.  The Mac's IIe video 
    rendering is quite faithful and is at least as fast as the original, 
    even on the first LCs.

(3) The LC/IIe setup enjoys certain advantages over a PC Transporter 
    running in a IIgs or IIe when it comes to disk storage.  While a Mac 
    hard drive can have both ProDOS and HFS partitions, the PCT requires a 
    special ProDOS file to EMULATE an MS-DOS hard drive partition.  
    Additionally, while the Mac's Superdrive can re-write CGR/ProDOS 
    through its own system software, most standard Apple drives cannot 
    re-write MFM/MS-DOS.  Consequently, the reader may recall from past 
    articles that when the PC Transporter accesses a standard Apple drive 
    through the Apple II and ProDOS, MS-DOS is laid down in low-level CGR 
    format, which can make file transfer problematical.

(4) It should be noted that the file "Basic.System" is a Mac file and is 
    different from the "Basic.System" file found on IIe ProDOS disks.

(5) It was not possible to determine as of this writing if any current or 
    modified version of this file has overcome these problems.  However, 
    the file is available in GEnie's Macintosh software libraries.

(6) For users of the PCT card, an analogous ProDOS system file is the 
    "AEPC.CONFIG" file.

(7) Of course, sufficient hard disk storage must exist in order to 
    configure for this much space.  However, in many cases, former IIe 
    users can connect their old SCSI hard disk to the LC's SCSI port and 
    use it immediately with the IIe PDS card.

(8) Apple IIe Card Owners Guide, p. 106.

(9) Some good news is that InTrec intends to release a Mac version of their 
    ProTERM software.  How well this software will maintain the Apple II 
    version's power, look, and feel will undoubtedly influence the purchase 
    of many users.

Golden Oldie Review:  ChessMaster 2100
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Darrel Raines
      [D.RAINES]



     This month's column will examine the software classic ChessMaster 
2100.  There have been computer chess games available ever since there have 
been any computer games.  The quality of chess programs has always been a 
measure of a computer's ability to simulate intelligent thought.

     I still have some of the original columns from Byte magazine that 
discuss the possibility of computers thinking.  In those columns they 
discuss (perhaps for the first time in a national forum) the type of logic 
that computer chess games could employ to simulate the strategy used by a 
great chess player.  In fact, computer chess games have been the subject of 
critical review for years as a test of the power of computers to out-think 
their creators.  The theory is that if a computer can ever master chess 
better than the humans who are champions at the game, then the validity of 
"artificial intelligence" will have been proven.

     Most versions of computer chess that run on home computers will never 
offer a serious challenge to the world champions.  However, many software 
packages exist that will give the average (or better) chess player a run 
for their money.  ChessMaster 2100 falls into this category.

     This game was made available to many different platforms when it was 
first released.  Two newer versions have appeared for the IBM platform 
entitled ChessMaster 3000 and 4000 turbo.  Besides some additional bells 
and whistles added to the interface, the game does not appear to have been 
significantly enhanced in its game-play ability.

     The Apple IIgs version uses the familiar desktop interface with 
pull-down menus that allow easy access to the various game features.  The 
game plays in 320x200 resolution graphics mode and offers good detail and 
color.  The game runs from 3.5" disk or can be loaded onto a hard drive.  
The hard drive installation requires a third-party public domain program 
called "Chess.Finder" in order for the software to be run from the Apple 
System Finder.  There is also a minor, but annoying, problem with the menu 
bar while using newer versions of the system software.  You can still load 
and play the game, but the menu bar is black.  The pull-down menus show up 
fine, but you must guess on the whereabouts of the top menu item.  This 
minor problem aside, the game has no difficulties running under newer 
system software from a hard drive.

     I should mention here that the game uses a form of copy protection 
that requires a date, person, or place to be looked up from the game 
manual.  I don't consider this type of protection to be too onerous, but it 
certainly is not as convenient as no copy protection at all.  In this area 
also there is help available.  A file that I have seen on GEnie and other 
information systems shows how to get rid of the question all-together.  I 
prefer this option, but warn you that only owners with a legal copy of the 
software should use this patch.

     Okay, how does the game play?  Great!  I am a fairly good chess 
player and find that the game is difficult to beat on the higher levels.  
However, there is a penalty to pay in the form of processing time.  The 
better you ask the computer to play, the longer it takes for the computer 
to make a move.  This can mean a lot of time waiting on your part for the 
computer to pick out its next brilliant move.  Of course, you can be using 
the time to your advantage by working on your next move.  In any case, the 
game can be quite slow in the higher game play levels.  An accelerator card 
can dramatically improve this performance.  I would recommend an 
accelerator anyway, so that you can see marked improvement with all your 
software.

     One of the things that make ChessMaster 2100 better than any of its 
predecessors on the Apple II market is the number of features available at 
the click of a mouse.  You can establish the strength of your computer 
opponent by choosing from a wide variety of options.  Computer play 
strength can be selected from a range of 1 to 14.  You can also select 
whether the computer will make random "less than the best" moves.  You can 
even tell the computer to play like a dummy.  If these options weren't 
enough, you can also choose from a number of timed-game modes.  Anyone 
preparing for a real-world chess tournament will appreciate these modes.  
You can select any time constraint you want to use.  The computer, and you, 
will be forced to make your moves in the specified time or that player will 
loose the game.  For a really quick game you can choose the Blitz mode and 
the whole game must be completed in less than 10 minutes (i.e. 5 minutes 
per side to make all moves).  There is also a feature called "Equal Time" 
mode where the computer is constrained to use about the same amount of time 
that you use to determine the next move.

     The options don't end there.  Many features are available for the 
human opponent.  You can choose between three different views of the board.  
A 2D option will show the board from above.  A 3D option will show a nice 
three-dimensional view of the board from one side.  A "War Room" option 
provides a smaller 2D view with additional windows showing pieces captured, 
notation for moves made, and computer contemplated moves.  If these 
features are not enough for you, you can also choose the colors that will 
be used for all pieces, the board colors, and you can even design and use a 
custom set of playing pieces.

     A number of other good features of varying importance round out the 
package.  The computer will play with no sound at all, bell sounds, music, 
or a human voice responding to play on both sides.  A variety of 
informational windows can be turned on or off as a way of monitoring 
computer activity.  There is a teaching mode where the computer will 
suggest your next play.  There is a list of moves made so far.  There is a 
computer thinking display that will give you insight into what plays the 
program is contemplating.  Clock displays for the human and computer 
players can be turned on or off.  All of these features are not strictly 
necessary, but add to the overall polish on the package.

     I guess at this point you could say, "Nice review, but the real 
question is how well does it play chess?"  I suppose this is a valid 
question.  However, most people who buy computer chess programs are not all 
that strong at their game.  I would venture to say that most people buy a 
chess package based on features, not on playing strength.  I would rate the 
game strength of this program as equal to that of an experienced tournament 
chess player.  That probably isn't enough of an answer, so I will attempt 
to expand upon the statement.

     The program makes use of a large opening "book" that allows the 
computer to choose its first few moves from a time-honored collection of 
the best openings that the chess world has to offer.  This is both a 
strength and a weakness for the computer.  The response from the program 
will be instantaneous for the first few moves.  However, once the opening 
book has been exhausted of moves, the computer must use its internal 
algorithm for making successive moves.  The fallacy here is that the 
opening moves may have been geared toward an objective that the computer 
algorithm does not carry forward into subsequent moves.  However, this does 
not show up as a weakness in too many games.

     Once the internal algorithm takes over, the program is a good 
position player.  The computer will attempt to crush you with its entire 
arsenal of pieces.  The big advantage for the computer is this:  it does 
not overlook any capture, fork, or discovered capture that is available in 
the next two or three moves.  This is a tremendous advantage over the 
average human player.  The advantage is even more obvious in timed games.  
I have slapped my forehead a number of times upon overlooking a simple 
fork.  This is where one of the other attractive features of the game comes 
into play.  You can take back any number of moves for yourself or the 
computer.  This feature is probably important to the weekend pawn-pusher.

     I have played chess on and off for the past 20 years.  I have 
participated in many different forms of game play including postal chess 
and modem chess.  (For those of you who want a rating to use for 
comparison, I have been rated anywhere from 1400 to 1900 during my chess 
playing career.)  ChessMaster 2100 can beat me 9 times out of 10 in the 
tougher game modes.  I can do a little better in the fast game play modes, 
but when the computer wins in the fast time play, it is usually because I 
failed to see something simple.  Let me put the ratio at 5 out of 10 for 
the faster modes.

     Bottom line on ChessMaster 2100:  If you have any interest in chess, 
whether it is a casual spark or a deep seated love of the game, you owe it 
to yourself to get a copy of this program.  You will find some combination 
of modes and timing constraints that will make the game play you on even 
ground.  You will definitely enjoy this program and may actually improve 
your chess play.

     Footnote:  Many other features are included that I should not fail to 
mention.  There is a save and load game feature.  Over a hundred classic 
games have been saved on the distribution disks.  There is an option to set 
up a game.  There is also a solve for mate feature.  The program will 
analyze a game and offer the moves that the computer would have made at any 
point in that game.  You can print the board position at any time and the 
moves made so far.  You can even tell the computer what your name is so 
that your chess clock will reflect that entry.

               THE TREASURE HUNT /
/////////////////////////////////
Yours For the Downloading
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Charlie Hartley
      [C.HARTLEY3]



     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month we will take a look at 
some of the many uploads by Pat Kern [C.KERN1].  Pat has uploaded graphics 
files including images for Classic Print Shop (DOS 3.3), The New Print Shop 
(ProDOS), Print Shop GS, as well as many double high resolution (DHR) 
graphics that may be used with a desktop publishing program such as Publish 
It! 4.

     In this month's column we will take a look at some of Pat's personal 
favorites.  All these files are public domain.

     We will begin with the Print Shop graphics, fonts, and borders.  Not 
surprisingly, Pat is fond of the "Southwest" files created for the AzApple 
User Group (Phoenix, Arizona).  She was involved with this group until she 
returned to Chicago.

     The Southwest print shop uploads were the signature graphics 
collection of the AzApple User Group public domain library. The full list 
is given below.

File#  File name             Short Description

17103  STHWEST1.PS.BXY       Southwest Print Shop graphics.
17104  STHWEST2.PS.BXY       Southwest Print Shop graphics.
17105  STHWEST3.PS.BXY       Southwest Print Shop graphics.
17106  STHWEST4.PS.BXY       Southwest Print Shop fonts/borders

17491  SWAZ.NPS.BXY          Southwest graphics,fonts,borders for 3.5.
17492  SWAZ.1.NPS.BXY        Southwest New Print Shop for 5.25.
17493  SWAZ.2.NPS.BXY        Southwest New Print Shop for 5.25.
17494  SWAZ.3.NPS.BXY        Southwest New Print Shop for 5.25.
17495  SWAZ.4.NPS.BXY        Southwest New Print Shop for 5.25

     Since these are so similar, we will concentrate on the original 
Classic Print Shop stuff. 

     STHWEST1.PS.BXY contains 62 Print Shop graphics that have a 
southwestern, cowboy, or wild west theme to them.  My personal favorites on 
this disk are Siesta (a Mexican in a large sombrero napping), Roadrunner, 
Wagon 01 (covered wagon), Stagecoach, and Campfire.  There are also many 
horse graphics, cute Native American graphics, and cowboy graphics.

     STHWEST2.PS.BXY contains 60 Print Shop graphics that continue the 
southwestern theme.  There are 12 different sun graphics and 8 horse 
graphics.  My favorites are Indian 06 which is almost a portrait of an 
Native American brave, and Indian 08 which portrays an attractive Native 
American woman.

     STHWEST3.PS.BXY contains 67 more Print Shop graphics.  If you are 
looking for Print Shop graphics of the states of the Southwest, get this 
one.  It includes a graphic of the entire region, as well as individual 
graphics of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and 
Utah.  These are well done.  Probably my favorite graphic on the disk is 
"Gracias", which looks just like Teddy Roosevelt during his Rough Rider 
days.

     STHWEST4.PS.BXY contains 29 borders and 33 fonts files.  The border 
files are all in the Southwestern theme.  My personal favorite is Longhorn. 
The fonts include the following regular fonts (upper case, numbers, 
punctuation):  Angeles, Austin, Berkeley, Cactus, California, Carmel, 
Cupertino, Dallas, Hollywood, Hombre, Houston, Lamoni, San.Diego, 
Santamonic, Seattle, Sierra, Slim, Texas, Tombstone, Utah, and Vegas.  
There are 4 font sets that include lowercase letters, numbers and 
punctuation marks:  LCDallas, LCMonica, LCSierra, and LCTexas.

     The best fonts on the disk include both upper case and lowercase 
letters plus a limited group of punctuation marks.  They include AAngles, 
ABerkeley, ACupertino, ADallas, AHombre, AMonica, APalo.Alto, and ASierra.

     There is also a text file on the disk titled INFO.FONTS that tells 
you how to access this last group of fonts.  Since it may be a bit 
difficult for some to access that file, it is reproduced below.

                                 [*][*][*]

"These Print Shop compatible fonts allow the user to combine Upper case 
with Lowercase.  Letters from the keyboard produce lowercase.  You will not 
be able to use numbers & most punctuation, since those characters are used 
for the upper case, so if you want to include addresses, phone numbers, 
dates, prices, etc. use another font.  Use the following substitutions for 
upper case letters:

A  1         F  6          K  -         P  &         U  ;
B  2         G  7          L  =         Q  *         V  :
C  3         H  8          M  #         R  (         W  "
D  4         I  9          N  $         S  )         X  <
E  5         J  0          O  %         T  +         Y  >
                                                     Z  /

Only certain punctuation can be used as follows:  .  ,  '  ?  !

With most programs, the number or punctuation will appear on the monitor.  
It will look strange, but will print out OK.  Trust me.  With LLL program, 
WYSIWYG.

You may want to print out the above substitutions and keep it in the disk 
jacket for reference.  It will save you time."

                                 [*][*][*]


     As a side note, if you do a lot of Classic Print Shop (DOS 3.3) 
stuff, have many graphics disks for it (or plan to download all these), and 
you don't have "The PS Lover's Utility Set," stop what you're doing right 
now, rush to your phone, call the Big Red Computer Club at 402-379-4680 and 
beg them to sell you a copy of it.  Among other things, it includes a 
program to print out all the graphics, borders, and fonts on a disk so that 
you can see at a glance which ones you want to use.

     Uploads #17492-17495 contain essentially the same graphics, fonts, 
and borders for The New Print Shop (ProDOS) as are described above for 
Classic Print Shop (in uploads #17103-17106).  They are not, however, in 
the same order.  I recommend that you download all four, but if you are 
looking for the fonts and/or borders, they are on #17492-17493.  All four 
of these may be found on one 3.5" upload by getting file #17491 from the 
library.

     Colorized versions of these Southwest graphics were uploaded by 
N.TOULME and include the following:

File#  File name             Short Description

18871  PSGS.SW.1.BXY         PSGS Graphics, Southwestern Theme
18872  PSGS.SW.2.BXY         PSGS Graphics, Southwestern Theme
18873  PSGS.SW.3.BXY         PSGS Graphics, Southwestern Theme
18874  PSGS.SW.4.BXY         PSGS Fonts, borders; Southwest Theme


     Moving onto double high resolution (DHR) graphics, some of Pat's 
favorites are the school graphics found in the following files:

16320 SCHOOL.1.BXY        Desc: Double Hi Res school graphics.
16377 SCHOOL.2.BXY        Desc: More school Double Hi Res clipart.
19418 SCHOOL.3.BXY        Desc: DHR School Clipart.  Part 3.
19443 SCHOOL.4.BXY        Desc: School DHR clipart.  Part 4.
16357 GRAD.1.BXY          Desc: Double Hi Res Graduation clipart.

     SCHOOL.1.BXY contains 16 graphics.  These are black and white line 
art drawings produced on the Thunderscan.  You can import any of these DHR 
graphics, into such programs as Publish It! 4, Dazzle Draw, 8/16 Paint, 
Platinum Paint, GraphicWriter III, Tutor Tech, TimeOut Paint, or any other 
program that accesses DHR graphics.

     SCHOOL.2.BXY contains 16 more school graphics; SCHOOL.3.BXY and 
SCHOOL.4.BXY each contain 24 graphics. These are all great for school 
newsletters, flyers, teacher parent conferences & meetings, fundraising
posters, advertising, and nearly anything you can think of that is school 
related.

     GRAD.1.BXY contains 16 b/w line drawings all related to school 
graduation.

     Another side note here: Big Red Computers is offering Publish It! 4 
for $25, which includes the disks and manuals.  If you (or your child's 
school) have an enhanced Apple 128K IIe, IIc, IIc+, Laser, or Apple IIgs 
with a mouse (joystick also works, but not well), and you don't have this 
program, get it!  The word is that Big Red is closing up shop at the end of 
this year, so don't waste time on this one.

     Other favorites of Pat's include the 11 files of Jewish graphics and 
the 4 files of Wedding graphics.  The file numbers, names and brief 
descriptions are listed below.

File#     File name          Short Description

16737     JEW.01.DHR.BXY     Jewish holiday & other clip art
16747     JEW.02.DHR.BXY     More Jewish DHR clip art
16748     JEW.03.DHR.BXY     Still more Jewish clip art
16754     JEW.04.DHR.BXY     Even more Jewish clipart.
16831     JEW.05.DHR.BXY     Bar Mitzvah DHR clipart.

17714     WEDDING.4.BXY      Wedding DHR graphics.  Part 4.

     If you have a newborn, one on the way, or know an expectant mother, 
you will want to check out file #21177, titled BABY.1.BXY.  This file 
contains 24 b/w line drawings of baby graphics that can be used for birth 
announcements, greeting cards, baby shower invitations, thank-yous, gift 
enclosures, photo albums, baby diaries, and anything else having to do with 
babies.

     Pat has uploaded several files that help you to create attractive 
greeting cards and emboss a variety of things.  Here are some files you may 
want to download.

File#     File name          Short Description

17778     PI.GREETING.BXY    Publish It greeting card How To.
17850     PI.EMBOSS.BXY      How to Emboss.  Publish It doc.
20818     EMBOSS.HINT.TXT    Hints for embossing


     PI.GREETING.BXY, which requires Publish It!, was created by Vivian 
Lynes for AzApple User Group Journal.  It explains how to create a greeting 
card using the Publish It! program.  Just load the document into Publish 
It! and print it out to one page.  The upload also includes a greeting card 
template to use in creating your own cards.

     PI.EMBOSS.BXY, which also requires Publish It!, is a tutorial by 
Vivian Lynes that tells how to emboss using computer printouts.  The layout 
was prepared by Pat Kern for AzApple Journal. To see this correctly, 
install the fonts Florence.12 and Florence.24 (included with upload) before 
printing.

     EMBOSS.HINT.TXT is a short text file giving some hints for embossing 
computer-generated greeting cards and even bank checks (for gift giving).  
It can be listed & captured in your copy buffer or downloaded as an ASCII 
text file.

     Pat recommends the following files by Karl Bunker and Jon Thomason 
for those who use DHR graphics.

File#     File name          Short Description

21357     SNEEZE.BXY         Multi-purpose file utility
14547     PHOTOMATRIX.BXY    Great double hires print utility

     Sneeze in a terrific freeware file utility program.  One of its 
features is the ability to display DHR graphics on command.  I won't spend 
a lot of time on this except to say that if you don't have it, you should.  
While your at it, search the library for other Karl Bunker files. All of 
them are freeware and all are terrific.

     According to its long description, Photomatrix will print out a 
collection of DHR pics about the size of a half dollar on a sheet of paper, 
about 5 across and 5 down.  It is automatic and all you need to do is tell 
it where the disks are.  It is shareware; the fee is $10.  For your money 
you will receive, some 100 additional DHR pics found  nowhere else.  The 
author is Jon C. Thomason [jonct@pro-applepi.cts.com].

                                 [*][*][*]


     That's it for this month.  I hope you have found something here to 
whet your interest.  Drop me a line and let me know what you think of this 
column and offer any suggestions you might have about what should be in it.

     Until next time, happy downloading!

Who's Who In Apple II

by Charlie Hartley
      [C.HARTLEY3]


                            >>> WHO'S WHO? <<<
                            """"""""""""""""""
                     ~ GEnieLamp Profile:  Pat Kern ~

     This month we spotlight Pat Kern (aka C.KERN1 and PATZ PIX), perhaps 
the most prolific contributor to the A2 library, particularly with files 
that deal with graphics.  (Some of her favorite uploads are featured in the 
Treasure Hunt column this month.)


GEnieLamp>   Tell us how you first became interested in the Apple II.
"""""""""

Kern>   My entry into the computing world began about 10 years ago when
""""    Apple computers were being used in schools and that other computer 
brand was being used in business.  The home computer choices were between 
the Apple IIc or IIe, or the PCjr.  At the time, I was skeptical of buying 
a computer for home use -- after all, I could balance a checkbook, use a 
calculator, type reasonably well, and had Atari 2600 for games.  So ten 
years ago I had to be convinced that we needed a computer.  Now I doubt 
that I would want to live without one.

GEnieLamp>   Was it your first computer?
"""""""""

Kern>   The IIc was my first computer and the one I still use the most
""""    today.  I managed with one disk drive and 128K in the beginning.

GEnieLamp>   You have uploaded many files of fonts, borders, and graphics
"""""""""    for the classic Print Shop (DOS 3.3), as well as for the New 
Print Shop (ProDOS) and Print Shop GS.  Which of these programs is your 
favorite and why?

Kern>   For simplicity and speed of operation, the Classic Print Shop,
""""    DOS 3.3 version, is the best choice for producing greeting cards, 
calendars, banners, and signs.  It also offers a wide variety of graphics, 
fonts and borders.  For versatility and variation, New Print Shop offers 
many options not available in the original version.  Print Shop GS and 
Companion offer many utilities for converting graphics and fonts from other 
sources.

     The first Print Shop was fast and easy to use.  New Print Shop offers 
more flexibility and is more like a desktop publishing program with many 
options in the style of greeting card, calendar, banner, or sign.  Various 
fonts can be used together, graphics in various sizes can be placed 
anywhere, different colors can be used for different parts of the document.  
Print Shop GS offers colors and the Print Shop Companion offers several 
useful utilities.

     Even though the Classic Print Shop (DOS 3.3) versions of Print Shop 
graphics, fonts, and borders were first uploaded several years ago, they 
continue to be popular for downloading for several reasons.  The original 
DOS 3.3 graphics are more numerous than in the other formats.  Clients who 
use New Print Shop or Print Shop GS can convert these graphics into formats 
compatible with whichever program they prefer.  Furthermore, any of the 
graphics formats will import into Publish It!

     There are many previously owned Apple IIs in use today, and the 
original Print Shop is one of the programs that is normally included with 
the sale of used systems.

     I was pleased when some of the monochromatic graphics I uploaded in 
Classic Print Shop format were converted into Print Shop GS by Nels Toulme, 
a GEnie client, and colorized by Yvonne Sanders.


GEnieLamp>   Where do you get the graphics that you upload?
"""""""""

Kern>   The Print Shop graphics are all in the public domain -- many were
""""    created by users.  Being of the philosophy that you can never have 
too many graphics, I began collecting them from various sources.  What I 
did was to organize them according to meaningful categories.

     I got interested in using DHR graphics when I started using the 
commercial desktop publishing program Publish It!  The original program 
came with some graphics, but it seemed like I was always searching for 
more.

     Eventually I purchased a scanner in order to create my own graphics. 
There are clip art books available that contain copyright free line 
drawings, and I used these as sources for most of my uploads.  But there 
are other sources -- newspaper ads, direct mail advertising flyers, 
business, school and religious publications; all use clip art.

GEnieLamp>   Do you have a personal style for using the Print Shop and
"""""""""    Publish It! programs?

Kern>   I like to use common programs in an uncommon way.  One of the ways
""""    to make more professional looking output from any publishing 
program is by embossing the computer printout.  Vivian Lynes, a member of 
my user group in Arizona, created a tutorial file on this technique.

GEnieLamp>   What hardware and software do you use most often?
"""""""""

Kern>   The hardware I use for scanning is ThunderScan, since it is the
""""    only scanner suitable for the IIc.  When my friend, Cindy Adams 
(C.ADAMS11) bought a Quickie scanner, she offered to sell me her 
ThunderScan.  I use this along with 8/16 Paint to clean up and edit the 
graphics I scan.

     I use Sneeze to view the graphics, and I use Photomatrix to print out 
reference sheets for the graphics.  I use Print Shop Lover's Utility Set, a 
copyrighted program produced by Big Red Apple Club, to make print out 
samples of the graphics, fonts, and borders of Print Shop.

     I use ProTERM 3.1 to call GEnie and other Bbses, and I use its editor 
for most offline word processing.  I also use AppleWorks 3.0 for spell 
checking and word processing.  I use Publish It! 4.0 for desktop 
publishing, but I wish the developers had continued updating its features.  
I use ImageWriter I and II for printing. 

GEnieLamp>   You have created all of these super files for the A2 library.
"""""""""    Search the uploads for the name C.KERN1 and the list goes on 
and on.  How do you use them personally?

Kern>   I hope that by making available what I find useful, other users
""""    will be encouraged to upload files that they have created.

     I use the files I upload in various ways in my personal life.  I 
create Publish It! documents to use as publicity for public domain disks in 
my user group library.  When I was elected to the board of directors, I 
would create illustrated reports to hand out at board meetings.  Later I 
volunteered to conduct a desktop publishing workshop SIG (special interest 
group) during user group meetings and produced flyers and instruction 
handouts. 

     Although most of the user group's 28-36 page journal was produced on 
a Mac using PageMaker, I would produce pages using Publish It! to promote 
clip art and describe the new Disks of the Month or other Apple II news.  
There was also a recipe column in the journal, and I would create this page 
using Publish It! and clip art that I created, along with recipes 
contributed on the local BBS by Don Davidson or other members.  Examples 
are here in the A2 Library 62 as Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving recipe 
files.

     One of the most creative uses of the clip art came from brainstorming 
during a user group meeting.  A member, Milt Mahler (M.MAHLER2), wanted to 
make use of all the new DHR clip art to create greeting cards, instead of 
using Print Shop.  But Publish It! didn't contain this option.  I suggested 
dividing the page into quadrants, and then flipping the graphic upside 
down, the way Print Shop does it, so that the graphic is right side up when 
the card is folded.  Vivian Lynes improved on these ideas, and produced the 
tutorial.

GEnieLamp>   Can you tell us a little about the types of things you like to
"""""""""    do for fun?  (Speaking of "non-computer" fun, here.)

Kern>   My most recent non-computer-related activity/hobby is country line
""""    dancing.  However, that activity came to an abrupt halt when I 
fractured my wrist in three places -- just two days after Christmas last 
year.  I fell on the dance floor while doing the "Electric Slide" and left 
the dinner dance with the "Achy Breaky".  If I ever hear country dance 
music again, remind me to put on my cowboy boots.

     The recovery has been slow and painful, but I continued modeming on 
GEnie even with my arm in a cast for nearly 2 months.  I found the 
pointing, clicking, and dragging of the mouse and inserting and positioning 
the drawing into the ImageWriter carriage too difficult for scanning during 
the three months of physical therapy that continued after the cast was 
removed, so I edited some graphics scanned by Lee Reasly and uploaded 9 
volumes of them as Clip.art.Lee.

     Clients who put up with my one-handed typing in the Real Time 
Conferences will be pleased to know that my touch typing skills have 
returned, and so have my typos. :)

GEnieLamp>   What accomplishments are you most proud of?
"""""""""

Kern>   I am proud that any of my contributions here or in my user group
""""    have encouraged others to contribute and make use of the files.

     I am grateful for the many friends, both seen and unseen, that I have 
made as a result of computing.  For me, these contacts are one of the 
pleasures of being part of the modem and user group community.

     Many of the things I now do came to me as a surprise ...  like when 
Dean Esmay E-mailed me that there could be a staff opening here on GEnie 
and would I be interested?... or when it was suddenly announced that I had 
become sysop of one of the branches of the local user group BBS... or when 
I read that my name was on the nomination list of candidates for the local 
user group... and finally, when I was recruited to be a Beta Tester for 
ProTERM 3 (one of the "novice users").

     I was surprised when some of the clip art I scanned was chosen for 
the A2.Best.Clip art and again when some scanned art was used on the A2 On 
Disk of Resource Central or the Disk of the Month on GEnie.  I was honored 
when my local user group named me as Ambassador at Large when I left 
Arizona and relocated to the Chicago suburbs.  The final surprise was being 
asked to be interviewed for the GEnieLamp A2 profile.

GEnieLamp>  I think you have discovered that it's the busy people who get
"""""""""   called to do even more. :)  Are you active in the local user 
group in your area?  If so, what kinds of activities are going on involving 
the Apple II?

Kern>   I became a member of AzApple in Phoenix, Arizona, at a time when I
"""""   needed them and they needed me.

     It wasn't until a year or so after coming to Phoenix that we added a 
modem to the system.  In the beginning, it was used almost exclusively by 
teenagers to call local BBSes to chat.  A few months after purchasing the 
modem, we joined the AzApple User Group and I began to call its BBS.  
Shortly after that, the teenagers went to a class there and learned enough 
about downloading and ShrinkIt to give it a try.

     Encouraged by this success, I decided to give uploading a shot.  I 
was one of those rare individuals who learned how to upload before I 
learned how to download.  Pretty soon, there were several files on the 
local BBS waiting to be validated.  Then, one day, much to my surprise, I 
got a message in E-mail that read, "You are now the librarian of the 
Desktop Publishing branch.  Have fun!"  That, before I even attended my 
first meeting!

     At that time, Jerry Cline (INTREC) was the user group's president.  I 
sat quietly in the audience at that first meeting until he asked, "Is Pat 
Kern here?"... since he had only known me through the local BBS.  I 
responded, "I am sitting next to you, Jerry."  I then handed him about 20 
disks to contribute to the public domain library.

     Soon after attending, I was searched out to become our User Group's 
Public Domain librarian for the Apple II, a job I took over.  Then when the 
elections came up, I suddenly found my name in the list of candidates for 
the Board of Directors.  So I threw my sombrero into the ring, and was 
elected.

     I served one term, then ran for reelection.  Sometime during the 
second term, we needed to relocate to Chicago.  But the sale of the home in 
Phoenix dragged on for so long that I nearly was elected to a third term.

     I lived in Phoenix, AZ for nearly 5 years.  It was there that my 
interest in computing and modeming became strong.  So strong, in fact, that 
the computer system was the last thing loaded on the moving van when we 
moved back to the western suburbs of Chicago about 2 years ago.  

     Now I am in a suburb of Chicago, and have not found a suitable user 
group to join in this area.

GEnieLamp>   How long have you been on GEnie?  Where on GEnie are we most
""""""""""   likely to find you?

Kern>   I've been on GEnie for more than 3 years.  Dean Esmay recruited me
""""    for the A2 staff in January 1992.  I am a staff librarian with 
responsibility for 8 bit clip art and graphics.

     On GEnie, you are likely to find me in the nightly Real Time 
Conferences, the Sunday RTC "talkathons" or cruising the bulletin boards -- 
when I'm not uploading, downloading, or updating and maintaining the 
libraries.  I log on nearly every day.  I log off the RTCs with the notice 
" <<<--- watch me disappear "(with the arrow pointing to my e-mail name), 
then wait and "  :: P O O F :: " , then /exit.


GEnieLamp>   What plans do you have for the future?
"""""""""

Kern>   I plan to enlarge and upgrade my present system after Kfest
""""    (or ICONference as it is now called).  There are many more projects 
I intend to pursue, and I'll need to put myself into LEARN mode once again.

GEnieLamp>   Thank you, Pat, for an enjoyable interview.

Kern>   It's been my pleasure.  I hope to meet many of your readers online
"""""   in the nightly RTC room meetings.  See you there. :)


     A note to our readers:  If you want to know more about a particular 
person and want him/her to be interviewed for the GEnieLamp A2 profile 
column, send E-mail to C.HARTLEY3 or EDITOR.A2 and we'll see what we can 
do.  In your E-mail message, tell why you think this person is a good 
candidate for the profile.

July 1994 Report
""""""""""""""""
by GEna Saikin
     [A2.GENA]



     Last summer, at KansasFest in Kansas City, Missouri, an idea to 
create an online user group meeting was conceived.  All too many Apple II 
owners are finding themselves short of local support, due to the waning 
interest in the Apple II, and it was felt that this online group would help 
fill the gaps.  Hence, PAL (Planetary Apple League) was created.

     With this group, we are striving to fill in the gaps in local 
support, and have a place for people to go who need help, want to learn 
more about their Apple II's, hear special speakers, and just have fun!

MAIN EVENT -- KansasFest (aka ICONference)   In less than a month, a few
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   hundred people will be flying, 
driving and otherwise making their way to Kansas City, MO to attend an 
annual conference, held at a Catholic college right on the Kansas/Missouri 
border. There will be dorm food, very little sleep... and Kansas in July is 
HOT.  Last year, it look doubtful that anyone east of the Missouri would 
make it -- floods had devastated the midwest -- but that didn't stop 
anyone!  We midwesterners were determined to swim.  Fortunately, we didn't 
have to.  There were two bridges open... barely.  A couple attendees even 
risked their necks getting to KansasFest last year.  A long drive and a 
weary driver caused an accident with an 18-wheeler.  Although the car was a 
bit worse for wear, the two folks came out relatively unscathed, and 
proceeded to enjoy the conference!  Why would so many people struggle, 
bargain with their bosses, save their pennies and strive so hard to face 
the above "hardships"?  

     KansasFest, which will from now on be called ICONference, is worth 
every scrap of sacrifice, every iota of pennies saved, and every struggle 
to get there.  The seminars are interesting and thoughtfully presented.  
Last year, Joe Kohn talked to us about shareware -- the importance of 
paying the fees and how to go about marketing your shareware programs and 
collecting the fees.  AppleWorks 4 was introduced, and there were many more 
seminars that were equally engaging.  But at least as important, is what 
goes on "after hours"... meeting folks you've talked with online all year 
is an exhilarating experience!  (It can also be interesting if you have 
pre-conceived notions of how they look.)

     A rough agenda has been penned by Tom Weishaar, and is presented 
below:

                                 [*][*][*]


ICONFerence July 21-23 1994   Tentative Session Schedule, as of May 27:

Keynote speaker: Randy Brandt, Project Manager, AppleWorks 4.0

Pat Wilson, Microsoft - Special Preview of Microsoft Windows 4.0 (Chicago)
    (non-disclosure required)
Pat Wilson, Microsoft - Microsoft Office for Windows Demo (2 hours)
Nick Dazio et al - Launch of the Mensch Computer
Roger Wagner - subject to be announced
Mike Westerfield - subject to be announced
Michael Lutynski - Animasia 3-D
Jim Maricondo - UNIX & the Internet; UNIX and the Apple IIgs: GNO/ME
Bill Lynn - Way Cool & Way Cheap Macintosh Utilities
Greg Nelson - Multimedia Authoring with CD-ROM
Nathaniel Sloan - The Ins and Outs of Telecom Scripting
Joe Kohn - Looking Good in Print
Joe Kohn - All About the Internet
Lane Roathe - How to get a job in the computer industry
Erick Wagner - Apple II Interfacing, How to Control and Monitor Real-World
       Devices
David Ciotti - Soldering for Beginners, Which End of the Iron is Hot?

                                 [*][*][*]


     The "unofficial" after-hours fun promises to continue this year, 
since some of our folks who were there last year and who contributed 
mightily to "after hours" will be here this year as well!

     Last year, people spent a lot of time wandering from room to room, 
trading goodies from their hard drives, comparing notes on programs, and 
meeting new people!  We had several from overseas -- Germany and Australia 
to name a couple of countries!

     Roger Wagner last year not only "inspired" a "tie wearing contest" 
but he tried to scale the dorm wall -- outside.  We have a "celebrity 
roast" and guess who got roasted last year?  (Hint:  His first name is 
Tom.)  Another bit -- or possibly byte -- of fun was the "bag biting 
contest".  What's that?  It's where a grocery bag is placed on the floor, 
and the contestants pick up the bag with their teeth/lips without touching 
the ground with hands or knees.  Doesn't sound too difficult, until you 
find out that after each successful grab, the bag is cut down, until it is 
merely a couple inches high!  

     There is so much more to tell about Kfest -- more than could ever fit 
in the article.  You'll just have to come to find out more!

LIBRARY STACKS   As always, we have plenty of useful files in our library
""""""""""""""   here in Apple II RT.  Below are "what's hot" for this

WHAT'S NEW IN A2   The new, updated GEM was released last month, and seems
""""""""""""""""   to be a hit.  GEnie Master now comes in flavors for 
AppleWorks 3.0 and 4, and now works with Spectrum.

     Calling all insomniacs!  Often, our evening RTCs (Real Time 
Conferences) are now going and going and going (isn't that the Energizer 
Bunny's line?)... until the wee hours of the morning!  Just pop in, even 
though its "after hours", and see if someone's there... you may be 
pleasantly surprised!

     And, of course, we're all gearing up for ICONference next month!  So, 
don't be shy... pop into one of our nightly RTCs (scheduled times are 9 
p.m. to 1 a.m. eastern) or our Sunday RTC (scheduled times are 2 p.m. to 8 
p.m. and 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.).  But if the bug to come into an RTC bytes you 
at other times, come on in... there just may be someone there!  Remember, a 
staff member does NOT have to be present for you to use the RTC area!  It's 
open for anyone to use at any time!

THE END IS NEAR   We've come a long way in this review of the events in the
"""""""""""""""   life of the Apple II computer and those who have helped 
shape and direct its course.  My Flux Capacitor card has nearly exhausted 
its capacity for, er, fluxing, and I've run into a wall that did not stop 
Marty McFly in his time-travelling adventures:  The future.  Although I 
could create any future I wish to in my own fertile imagination, the events 
yet to come are no more clear to ME than to anyone else who wants to try 
their hand at prognostication.  But one word does come to mind:  
Renaissance.  Webster's Dictionary defines it as "a movement or period of 
vigorous artistic and intellectual activity; rebirth, revival".  I believe 
this word accurately reflects the current level of activity in the Apple II 
world outside of Apple, Inc.  In order to take a look at why I believe this 
to be true, and at what might be in store for this computer, let's start by 
reviewing in brief what we've already covered.


OVERVIEW OF APPLE II HISTORY (THE BIG PICTURE)   Back when Apple Computer,
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Inc. got its start, it was 
just one small part of the rapidly growing field of consumer-oriented uses 
of the new microprocessor technology.  It was not the first computer 
available for home use, and some might argue that it was not the best for 
its time, either.  But it did have an openness in design that made it 
possible (for those who were excited about exploring the digital unknown) 
to "boldly go where no one has gone before".  Unbeknownst to these early 
Apple II enthusiasts, those who ran Apple Computer at the time did not 
necessarily have the same affection for the Apple Ii in their hearts.

     The problems at Apple Computer in the two years after the release of 
the Apple II were not particularly unique to that company.  They were 
suffering from the growth pains that can happen to ANY company that 
suddenly finds itself with a blockbuster product on its hands.  There is a 
sudden influx of cash (which is a heady experience in itself), a demand for 
greater levels of production for the product, and the problems associated 
with trying to meet that demand.  These difficulties were part of what 
bogged down MITS, maker of the Altair 8800, when demand for their computer 
far surpassed all their expectations.

     It has become somewhat of an expectation in the minds of the American 
consumer that if a company has a product that is sold in a store, 
advertised in national magazines, and is professionally designed, that it 
must then be a "big company".  When you as a consumer are dealing with this 
mythical large company, you expect that they have managers and employees 
who know exactly what is going on at all times, have a clear business plan,  
and are firmly in control of all aspects of the product.  When the consumer 
becomes strongly attached to that product (develops a "brand loyalty" of 
sorts), sometimes that loyalty artificially inflates the abilities of the 
company that made it, and of its employees, to a status of expectations 
that no one can really meet.  A business-oriented purchaser of an Apple II 
just might have had his confidence shaken a bit if he had known, for 
instance, that one of the first activities of the founders and early 
employees of Apple when they moved out of Jobs' garage and into a real 
office was to play games with the office telephones.  Was this sort of 
behavior an indication that the Apple II was a piece of junk?  Not at all; 
but it does highlight one problem that could not then be quickly 
overcome... one of immaturity and inexperience.

     Steve Wozniak was brilliant in his design of the Apple II; Steve Jobs 
was outstanding in his insistence on a quality appearance for the finished 
product; and all the others that made contributions in terms of hardware 
and software for this first all-in-one home computer did a top-notch job as 
well.  But without the experienced help that Apple's founders got from Mike 
Markkula and Mike Scott, the company would likely have drowned in its own 
success.  STARTING a business with a successful product is not that hard; 
what is difficult is MAINTAINING that business after it gets going.  Not 
only do you have the problems of meeting growing consumer demand, but in 
the case of a technologically complex device like a computer, you have more 
mundane things to do.  You must provide customer support involving items 
that WERE clearly spelled out in manual (which the owner likely did not 
read), as well as for problems that could not be anticipated in advance.  
As more computers are sold, there are more people that may need technical 
assistance.  This was not something that only Apple had trouble with; every 
small company that began to sell microcomputers had these same problems.  
Although Apple might well have handled things better, the help provided by 
those Apple executives who WERE experienced in business helped them survive 
the first few years.

     The next hurdle that Apple had to overcome was what they should do 
for an encore.  Sure, the Apple II was a success, and the introduction of 
the Disk II drive, with solid application software such as VisiCalc, 
ensured that they would do well for a while.  But until this time in the 
microcomputer industry, no other machine had survived much beyond two to 
three years.  At that point in the typical life of a computer, it has 
usually been surpassed by more advanced technology that does more for the 
same or lower cost.  If Apple were satisfied to be a single-product 
company, that would be fine; but the people running the company wanted it 
to survive and flourish.  Consequently, the push was begun to establish 
both short term and long-term goals for future products.  In the short 
term, the Apple III was designed to be a stop-gap machine until their long 
term goals could be achieved.  It was unthinkable that the Apple II could 
possibly last much beyond six to twelve more months, and so they put 
considerable effort into creating something they thought would be better 
than an Apple II, something that would be more suitable for a business type 
of environment.  As has been discussed before, this new computer was built 
with the capability of running Apple II software, so customers would have 
something they could do with it until an adequate supply of Apple 
III-specific software became available.  But the problems of growth pains 
and inadequate quality control killed the Apple III, despite Apple's best 
efforts to overcome their false start.  Meanwhile, the Apple II Plus 
continued to grow by leaps and bounds, ignoring the expectations of those 
within the company.

     Apple's long-term goal was to get a radically new computer platform 
designed and into production, something that would be as much ahead of the 
Apple II and III as those computers were ahead of what came before them. 
The Lisa project (and later the Macintosh) were what executives at Apple 
really believed would be the future of the company.  Certainly, with all 
the power and ease of use that these computers would promise, why would 
anyone want to still own an Apple II, or anything else?  In actuality, it 
was probably the failure of the Apple III and the continued successful 
growth of the Apple II that made a major contribution to the slow start the 
Lisa and Macintosh had.  Combined with that factor was the high cost of the 
Lisa, and the limited capability of the first Macs (with only 128K of RAM, 
there wasn't much you could do before you ran out of memory).

     All this time, the Apple II had developed its own perpetual motion 
that not even Apple's neglect could halt.  More Apple II computers in the 
home, school, and workplace meant more available customers for the 
fledgling software industry that provided fuel for these machines to run. 
And a software company, though also liable for the technical support issues 
that affected hardware manufacturers, was extremely easy to start out of a 
living room.  Just write a program, package it, put a few ads in magazines, 
and wait for the orders to come pouring in.  Though few did as well as 
VisiCalc, the growth of that company is an example of the potential that 
software authors could achieve, given the right circumstances.

     Champions of the Apple II within the company still managed to upgrade 
the product when they were given enough leeway.  The Apple IIe and IIc, 
with their improved graphics and expanded memory, were products of this 
type of advancement.  Those computers did not go far in covering new 
territory; in fact, the major justification in the minds of Apple 
executives was that miniaturization made it less expensive to produce a 
machine that worked only incrementally better than the original Apple II, 
primarily adding features that most people were adding to the II Plus 
(upper/lowercase display and keyboard, and extra memory).  Eventually, they 
allowed a true advancement in the form of the Apple IIgs, which held ties 
to the past by being compatible with old software and some hardware, and to 
the future by providing an all-new level of graphics, sound, and memory 
expansion capability.  Whereas the Apple IIe was not necessarily a better 
computer than the first Apple II or the original IBM PC, the Apple IIgs was 
clearly a considerable step forward.  Unfortunately, the IIgs was hindered 
from the start, not necessarily by blatantly obstructive efforts within the 
company, but more from the lack of corporate interest that had plagued the 
Apple II line since the Apple III had first been conceived.  By the time 
the IIgs was released, Apple's corporate mindset (the beliefs that many in 
the company held as absolute truth) was that the Macintosh and its 
descendants DEFINITELY were the true future of the company.  Consequently, 
it was difficult to get anyone to commit to making a realistic effort to 
promote and advertise the IIgs for the purposes where it would be best 
suited.  There appeared to be a paranoia that a successful Apple II of ANY 
kind would cause Mac sales to suffer.  Taken out of the active 
upgrade-support-upgrade loop, the IIgs made most of its advancements 
through the less-tangible system software development that was done for it.  
When the IIgs was first released, it was not much more able to do modern 
"desktop" computing (the graphic user interface) than was the first 128K 
Macintosh; it was primarily a larger, fancier IIe.  But with the maturing 
of its system software, and active work by outside developers, the IIgs 
eventually came into its own with a solid, mature operating system, and the 
ability to do many tasks for which people are buying other computers (not 
necessarily Macintosh).

     By mid-1992 there was a further decrease in the energy allocated 
within Apple for enhancements to the IIgs.  It was decided to change the 
Apple II Business Unit (the section within Apple that concentrated on that 
computer) into a "Continuing Engineering Unit".  This group was to maintain 
support and make small improvements for the existing Apple II and IIgs user 
base, but not to undertake any other major projects for either platform.  
While the Apple IIe and IIgs were still being produced and sold then, the 
IIgs and finally the IIe were dropped from the dealers' price sheets in the 
final quarters of 1992 and 1993, respectively.


SO WHO IS TO BLAME?   Let's take a look at the various major personalities
"""""""""""""""""""   at Apple that have had a major role in events there 
over the past fifteen years, and see how they affected the current state of 
affairs of the Apple II.  Now, bear in mind that what I write here is NOT a 
result of time spent personally talking with these people; they have 
already had others interview them often over the years about the same 
topics, and what they have wanted to say has likely been said.  Here I will 
summarize what HAS been written about them, and attempt to draw some 
conclusions.  Obviously, once I leave the Kingdom Of Factual Reporting and 
enter the Land Of Commentary, there is a chance that the judgements I may 
make are not valid.  I don't have an axe to grind with or against anyone, 
and it is not my intention to place blame squarely with any one person.  
Like any large company, Apple Computer is a collection of many different 
people's opinions, attitudes, and prejudices.  The sentiments you could get 
from talking to one person may be entirely different from those heard in 
talking with another.  With that disclaimer out of the way, let's begin.

     First of all, consider Steve Jobs.  In the eyes of many Apple II 
users, he is the quintessential villain, obstructing Apple II progress at 
every turn in favor of his baby, the Mac.  Many things have been written 
about Jobs over the years, discussing his temperament and lack of love 
toward the Apple II.  If accurate, these impressions could be summarized by 
saying that it appears Jobs was primarily a visionary, and was enamored of 
making Apple Computer a success and a Fortune 500 company (which he did, in 
the shortest time in business history).  He was also a big fan of the 
newest, the best, and the most interesting technology available; the older 
stuff was just a yawn after it was released (this includes even the Mac, 
which eventually lost its shine for him as he wanted Apple to build 
something even better).  He had an enthusiasm for the projects that looked 
like a good hack (this is what attracted him to Wozniak in the first 
place), and seemed to disdain anyone that did not wholeheartedly share his 
zeal.  His problems tended to stem from the same things that gave him his 
strength:  The single-mindedness of purpose was obnoxious to someone who 
was interested in upgrading older technology, like the Apple II -- why 
waste the time working with something old like THAT when you could be 
spending your time working with something NEW and exciting like Macintosh?  
His excitement about a pet project also tended to cause him to give out 
details about new projects when they should best be kept secret.  
Undoubtedly, Jobs played a strong role in the development of the mindset at 
Apple that the Apple II was "okay", but it was not something to waste much 
of your time with.  In this way of thinking, it was much better to be doing 
the "right thing" and to work with the Apple III or Lisa or Macintosh team.

     What about Steve Wozniak?  Although good in the technical department 
of hardware and software design, he was not of a temperament to participate 
in office politics.  Although he may have disagreed with the ways in which 
Jobs or others at Apple ran things, he did not have the business experience 
that let him feel qualified to counter their decisions with sufficient 
force to get things done his way.  He just wanted to design and build 
things, and so he tended to work at that which he did best.  When he had 
his opportunity, he left the company for a sabbatical in 1981, and later 
returned to work on whatever else happened to interest him.  But since he 
was involved in of the initial work on the Apple IIgs, he has not done much 
at Apple to champion the cause of the Apple II.

     John Sculley, the former vice-president of PepsiCo, who Jobs brought 
in to run the company after the departure of Mike Markkula, has little 
better a reputation with the Apple II community than does Steve Jobs.  This 
may be because of his position at the head of the company that has been 
practicing passive euthanasia on the Apple II for years, or perhaps because 
people have gotten the idea that he likes to tell them what they want to 
hear, but does not make any substantial efforts to carry the Apple II 
forward.  On the plus side, Sculley appears to be practical and a good 
businessman.  He is clearly able to take advantage of the opportunities 
presented to him, and to promote what he feels to be best for the company. 
He began at Apple with little experience in the technical areas that would 
be best suited for such a company, and had his rough times in trying to 
find his place.  He was considerably influenced by Jobs during his early 
months at Apple, and this likely extended to the lack of enthusiasm toward 
the Apple II.  Even after he realized the need to pull rank and to exclude 
Jobs from any influential role at Apple, it was not because he repented and 
wanted to champion the Apple II, but because Apple needed stability at the 
helm.

     As a company, Apple has felt that its business goals needed to be in 
a direction that did not put a great emphasis on the Apple II or IIgs 
computer.  As the rest of the world advanced, digitally speaking, so Apple 
needed to advance; it needed to make better, more capable, and more 
powerful computers for less money.  The contention (whether true or not) 
was that the Apple II simply did not have the "horsepower" to handle the 
higher powered applications that computer users of the late 1980s and early 
1990s demanded.  As future advances are made in available technology, this 
will mean that even machines like the most advanced Macintosh II will 
eventually be surpassed by a newer generation platform (possibly the 
PowerPC project that Apple and IBM are jointly working on through their 
Kaleida company).  But as progress continues, Apple has also learned that 
it cannot abandon its established user base, destroying the investment that 
people have made in a computer by making it obsolete.  If nothing else, the 
vocal complaints made over the years by the Apple II community have taught 
them that lesson.  Chris Espinosa, one of Apple's employees from the early 
days, was quoted in the March 9th, 1992 issue of InfoWorld as saying, 
"We're not going to do to the Macintosh what we did to the Apple II."<1>  
The Mac has achieved a degree of acceptance in the business marketplace, 
and this credibility would be hurt badly if they began to ignore the Mac in 
favor of yet another, more exciting computer.

     One factor that has contributed significantly over the years to the 
apparent inconsistency over the way that Apple has handled much of what it 
does (not just the Apple II) is the frequency of change within the company. 
This change leads to different people with different ideas taking over 
projects that were begun by others.  Tom Weishaar has said on more than one 
occasion, "[There is] this vision of Apple as an organism with a brain... 
that's [not] a correct metaphor.  Like any large organization, what it does 
is based on politics, and how many votes there are; [also,] the employees 
turn over every three years."<2>  Apple has undergone many reorganizations 
since it started business, as it has had to handle its phenomenal growth. 
Usually those changes took place in response to things not going well (such 
as with the Apple III), but sometimes it was done in an attempt to 
streamline operations and make things run more smoothly.<3>  A consequence 
of this change has been that as old people leave and new ones take their 
places, there is a natural desire to modify things that the old crew was 
doing.  Thus we have events like:

   o  Apple allowing the Apple Pugetsound Program Library Exchange to form 
      the Apple Programmers and Developers Association (Apple allowing 
      A.P.P.L.E. to form APDA, if you prefer the short version), and then 
      taking it back from them several years later.

   o  Apple spinning off their application software division (AppleWorks 
      and Mac products) to a separate company, Claris (to be less 
      competitive as a computer manufacturer with third-party software 
      developers), and later buying back Claris to bring it back under 
      corporate control.


WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY?   Second-guessing events of the past
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   is easy; we see what was done, and 
can say with presumed authority, "Well, if I had been running things, I 
would have done it like this!"  When these decisions were made (or not 
made, as the case may be), the correct path to the future was still as 
muddy as it is today.  Nevertheless, if I can make some idealistic 
statements, these are my thoughts on "what might have been."

ACCEPTANCE   Apple should have simply accepted the desire of the public
''''''''''   for the Apple II computer, and responded by promoting it 
actively.  This could have been done along with its promotions of the Apple 
III, and later the Mac.  When the Apple IIe was riding the high tide of 
popularity in December 1984, Apple should have capitalized on that, and 
redoubled the advertising for that computer.  Increased sales and profit 
would still have been good for the company, whether or not it came from 
Macintosh sales.

REALISM   Apple should have been REALISTIC instead of religiously
'''''''   IDEALISTIC.  Job's visionary approach to Macintosh as a product 
that would change the world was clearly NOT reflected in its early sales.  
A company lives on its sales, regardless of whether what it is selling 
happens to fit with its current philosophy.  The attitude should not be one 
that insists to the customer that THIS is what you want to buy, but to 
provide him with available choices and see what sells.  If the Macintosh 
was going to be as "insanely great" as Jobs and the rest of the Mac team 
believed, it would eventually pick up steam and start selling, without 
having to ignore the already-successful Apple II.

ENHANCEMENT   The products sold by Apple should have been upgraded
'''''''''''   according to the success they showed.  As Macintosh sales 
began to increase, advancing the machine to a larger memory size and more 
capabilities is perfectly reasonable.  In the same way, the Apple II should 
have had opportunities given to it in proportion to the income it produced 
for the company.  For example, at one time a notebook-sized Apple II (or 
IIgs) could have done extremely well, especially if it had been bundled 
with good general purpose software like AppleWorks.  The IIc and IIc Plus 
were good starts, but things stopped there.  The IBM clone market has shown 
that there IS a place for a notebook-sized computer with lots of memory, 
built-in hard disks, and color LCD screens.  A flat screen monitor could 
have been available for the Apple II as far back as 1985, had Apple been 
interested in developing it.

OUTSIDE EXPANSION   Even if Apple chose not to upgrade the Apple II
'''''''''''''''''   themselves, the technology could have been licensed to 
someone else who WAS interested in pushing the machine to the limit.  Even 
if these licensed Apple II products competed a bit with the Mac, it would 
also be competing with computers made by other companies.  Furthermore, the 
larger the market share, the more people are aware of your product, which 
can stimulate future sales.  And after all, license fees paid for use of 
Apple II technology would still generate income, with little effort on 
Apple's part.

ACTIVE RUMOR CONTROL   For years the rumors flew on a fairly regular cycle
''''''''''''''''''''   claiming that the Apple II had been or would be 
discontinued in short order.  When a political candidate has something 
untrue said about him, he makes a quick and decisive effort to counter that 
gossip; it can be VERY damaging to his current image and future credibility 
if he lets it go unchallenged.  Instead of making it clear that the Apple 
II was NOT being terminated, Apple seemed to usually ignore such 
statements.  Since a lack of denial is often taken as confirmation, this 
led to many Apple II users and developers leaving this computer and going 
on to something else, often the IBM PC and clones.  Decreased developers 
meant fewer new and upgraded programs, prompting then-current users to also 
move to a different computer, leading to smaller sales of existing 
software, which starts the whole cycle over.  Even "authorized" Apple 
dealers were known to spout off that same old tired rumor, because they 
heard it from "someone in the company who knows".  Official announcements 
from the company that strongly denied any discontinuation of the Apple II 
MIGHT have helped stop that cycle.


WHERE DOES THE APPLE II STAND TODAY: THE BAD NEWS
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

EDUCATION   Although the Apple II continues to have a large installed user
'''''''''   base compared to other computers in schools below the college 
level, it has been rapidly being overtaken by the onslaught of less 
expensive MS-DOS clones and Apple's own promotion of the Macintosh.  Apple 
gave up on its strong support of the Apple II at the school level in the 
same way it had done so at the consumer level.  They began to encourage 
schools to purchase Macintosh computers when they wanted to add to or 
replace their existing machines.  This was demonstrated by Apple in their 
ads; one example that appeared in inCider/A+ during 1991 showed two 
students in a computer lab.  One was sitting in front of an Apple IIe, and 
the other was at a Macintosh LC.  The Mac LC had an attractive color screen 
with graphics, where the Apple IIe had a pitiful-looking black and white 
40-column text menu displayed.  If you were looking at which computer to 
buy, which one would YOU choose?  (At that time, although the Macintosh LC 
was one of the best selling Apple computers to educational institutions, 
the best selling PERIPHERAL for the Mac LC up until 1992 was the Apple IIe 
card.)

DECLINING SUPPORT   The Apple II support market, both hardware and software
'''''''''''''''''   is not dead, but neither is it robust and thriving. 
Companies making products that work with the Apple II are often finding it 
difficult to continue in business without making unpopular decisions.  With 
flat or falling sales, they have had to either expand their coverage to 
other computer platforms, or face possible failure as a company.

     One example of this change was Applied Engineering.  For years they 
were prolific producers of hardware add-ons for the Apple II and IIgs, and 
often they had a large percentage of the total advertising pages in Apple 
II magazines.  Their early ads touted AE as Apple II experts, "because 
that's all we do".  Not only did AE begin making and selling peripherals 
for the Macintosh line, but they also made the unpopular decision to begin 
providing technical for their Apple II line through a 900-number toll phone 
line.  At the same time, Macintosh users were NOT required to pay charges 
over and above long distance just to get technical support.  Eventually, 
Applied Engineering found that they could not survive in the larger and 
more competitive Macintosh environment, and in the spring of 1994 they had 
to close their doors.

     Beagle Bros, also a long time Apple II supporter in the software 
arena, also took flack, perhaps more unjustly than Applied Engineering. 
They worked hard during 1991 in developing an integrated software product 
(BeagleWorks) for the Macintosh, and temporarily scaled back their Apple II 
support during the last days before the release of that new product.  The 
reason?  Apple II products simply were not selling at a rate high enough to 
meet overhead.  In Beagle's defense, they did NOT just leave their Apple II 
user base dangling.  Not only did they release many of their older software 
products to online services for free distribution (rather than just letting 
them disappear), but they also turned over further sales and development 
for the Apple II market to Quality Computers.  Quality, already a 
well-established Apple II mail-order company, has begun releasing new 
products under the Beagle name, ensuring that they will continue to be 
available and upgraded.

     Beagle, however, also succumbed to the pressures of the Macintosh 
market, and that company closed down in October 1992.

MAGAZINES ARE FALTERING   Unlike the old days when there were several
'''''''''''''''''''''''   magazines that catered to the Apple II market, 
there are just two glossy publications left:  GS+ Magazine and II Alive.  
Both are available only by subscription (you won't find them on the 
newsstand), and the latter is a recent start-up, in response to the failure 
of inCider/A+.  Newsletter-style publications like A2-Central and the 
National AppleWorks User Group are surviving, but they do not depend on 
advertising revenue to continue publication.  Additionally, A2-Central has 
had to make the change to a disk-only format to stay in business.

APPLE DEALER APATHY   Many of Apple's authorized dealers picked up on
'''''''''''''''''''   Apple's corporate indifference to any advancement of 
the Apple II, and themselves tended to ignore it.  There had been 
exceptions, but the general rule was that an Apple Dealer was not 
knowledgeable about the Apple IIe or IIgs and was unlikely to offer the 
IIgs as a solution for customer seeking a computer for a particular need. 
Some of this also has to do with the bottom line:  The markup (profit 
margin) for an Apple IIe or IIgs was not as high as it could once be with a 
Macintosh product, so there was less financial incentive to move those 
older products.  Sometimes, there has been even a decreased technical 
knowledge about the Apple II by the very dealers supposed to be able to 
repair them.

READ MY LIPS: NO NEW CPUS   A planned upgrade to the Apple IIgs that was
'''''''''''''''''''''''''   to be announced at or soon after the 1991 
KansasFest was killed at the last minute.  This change, which admittedly 
would not have been a major upgrade, would have still provided in a bundled 
form many of the features that customers buying a IIgs needed to get 
anything useful done (beyond simple IIe emulation).  The improved IIgs was 
to have more memory, a hard drive (built-in, as is done on many MS-DOS 
machines these days), and possibly a built-in SuperDrive (which is capable 
of reading 3.5 inch MS-DOS disks).  No reason for the cancellation was ever 
given; since it was never officially announced, the new IIgs CPU never 
officially existed anyway.  ("We do not comment on unannounced products" is 
the established party line.)  The only public announcement Apple HAS made 
was that there would NOT be any new Apple II released beyond the IIe card 
for the Mac LC.


WHERE DOES THE APPLE II STAND TODAY: THE GOOD NEWS   With all this going
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   against it, what 
possible good could there be to say about the current state of affairs 
regarding the Apple IIe and IIgs computer?  Surprisingly, there are several 
things.

APPLE II SUPPORT CONTINUES   Although Apple has indicated that we should
''''''''''''''''''''''''''   not expect to see any new Apple II CPUs 
released, they have also promised that they would continue to support the 
existing Apple II user base with hardware and software upgrades that will 
keep these computers useful.  Products they have released that show they've 
kept this promise include:

   o  GS/OS System 6.0 and 6.0.1, which offer many features similar to 
      Macintosh's System 7 package, as well as providing tighter 
      compatibility between the ROM 01 and ROM 03 IIgs computer.

   o  ProDOS 8 v2.0.3, which offers Apple IIe and IIc users the capability 
      of attaching large disk devices (such as hard drives with more than 
      two partitions) to a card in a single slot.

   o  HyperCard IIgs v1.1, an upgrade that includes more of the features 
      found in the latest Mac version of HyperCard.  This program, 
      previously available only as a commercial product, has recently been 
      reclassified in the same category as System software, which means it 
      is available to qualified user groups for free distribution to their 
      members (minus a manual, however).

   o  SuperDrive Card, a hardware add-on the makes it possible to use the 
      higher-density (1.44 MB) 3.5 disks on the IIe and IIgs, and access 
      (read-only) to MS-DOS disks.

   o  Video Overlay Card, making possible multimedia computing on the IIgs 
      that combines standard video signals with computer compatible video 
      signals.


A DEDICATED CORE OF THIRD PARTY SUPPORTERS   There are still many small
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   individual programmers and 
hardware hackers who are devoted to the Apple II.  They enjoy using this 
computer platform, and want to make new technology and programming 
techniques available for other Apple II users.  They continue to provide 
products that larger companies (who must have large returns on their 
development investment) cannot afford to produce for the Apple II.  The 
risk is that small one- or two-man companies may not be able to grow enough 
to ensure long-term support for their products.  Also, some smaller 
companies cannot afford to work full-time on the Apple II and must have a 
"real" job to support their part-time activities.

     Companies and/or products that fit into this category include:

   o  Procyon, which has come out with a Unix-like multitasking environment 
      for the IIgs called GNO/ME.  (Multitasking means that the computer is 
      doing two or more things simultaneously.  "Unix" is a multitasking 
      environment that has been in use on mainframes for years).

   o  JEM Software, Kingwood Micro Software, and Beagle Bros/Quality 
      Computers all produce AppleWorks enhancements and add-ons.  Quality 
      has gone so far as to obtain rights to product new versions of 
      AppleWorks and AppleWorks GS, which Apple and Claris let languish for 
      years.

   o  Seven Hills Software has several high quality IIgs products for the 
      serious user, including a desktop publishing package, a font editor, 
      disk utilities, drivers to make use of high quality output printers, 
      and more.

   o  Vitesse, Inc. offers a GS/OS-based package of hard disk management 
      utilities, as well as a IIgs printer driver for the better printers.

   o  Resource Central, a publisher, provides news, products, and technical 
      support for the Apple II family, as well as helping sponsor continued 
      technical education events ("KansasFest") each year.  The Apple II 
      support that comes directly from Apple through APDA (the Apple 
      Programmers and Developers Association) has now been turned over to 
      Resource Central.

   o  plus many more that I don't have room to mention here.


USER GROUPS   Just as in the beginning of the Apple II era, these groups
'''''''''''   still exist to provide the support for Apple II users that 
Apple and their authorized dealers cannot (or will not) provide.  They give 
a sense of community and comradery that can keep a new user (or 
semi-experienced user) from abandoning the II in frustration, with the 
oft-mistaken notion that the grass will be greener on the MS-DOS or Mac 
side.  Apple recognizes this and does provide many resources for Apple User 
Groups (but still tends to give much of its attention to the Mac side of 
things).

A NEW ERA OF SOFTWARE QUALITY   Since there are no longer a large number of
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   companies writing software for the Apple II 
series, we have come full circle.  In the early days, most of the available 
software came from amateur authors, and the best of it was distributed by 
fledgling software companies through computer stores and magazine 
advertising.  Today, much newer software, especially for the Apple IIgs, is 
coming from the same source:  Amateur authors.  Instead of being sold 
through stores or ads, much of this comes via online services through the 
Shareware method, or via mail-order houses.  Some companies, like Quality 
Computers, are also directing sales of the best programs, becoming a blend 
of software publisher and distributor.  Although the days of becoming a 
millionaire through selling a blockbuster Apple II program have probably 
passed forever, it is still possible to do fairly well as an author.

A LARGE LIBRARY OF AVAILABLE SOFTWARE   The Apple II has seventeen years'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   worth of software available, and 
much of the best of the old programs are available for bargain prices via 
private sales, or free for downloading from online services.


WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?   If it is true that the sun is slowly setting on
""""""""""""""""""""""   the age of Apple II computing, is there any point 
in hanging on any longer?  Yes, indeed!  First, if you own an Apple II 
computer, you have a platform that is extremely mature and well known.  
Unlike the IBM clones, who are evolving so fast that software cannot keep 
up with them, the 6502, 65c02, and 65816 have been around in one form or 
another for a long time.  People who write software for the Apple II or 
IIgs know EXACTLY how to make it do what they want it to do, and they can 
do it well.  The Apple IIgs, though released back in 1986, is just now 
coming into its full maturity, and some very high quality software is being 
released for it.  This software can make it possible to use hardware (such 
as large capacity hard disks, optical scanners, tape drives, touch windows, 
and much more) that has been made "respectable" in the IBM or Mac world, 
and is now available for reasonable prices to work on an Apple II.  The 
disadvantage faced by the IBM user is that mature 386 software will never 
exist; the 486 and its descendants will be the center of attention before 
that can happen.  The 486 will likely suffer the same fate.  Software on 
those machines simply cannot keep up with hardware when it changes so 
rapidly.  The stale "growth" of the IIgs may actually have been to its 
advantage!

     So then, how do you handle the feelings of envy you may get from 
scanning through the magazine racks, viewing all the lovely things you can 
buy for one of THOSE computers?  How is it possible to not be angry with 
Apple for what "they've" done to your favorite computer?  Here are some 
suggestions:

TAKE THINGS LESS SERIOUSLY   After all, IT'S JUST A COMPUTER.  People who
''''''''''''''''''''''''''   got upset with Chevrolet for discontinuing 
their classic Chevelle Malibu had far too much of an emotional investment 
in the car.  A computer, like a car, will NOT love you back, no matter how 
much time and devotion you put into it.  If you view it as a tool, then do 
what a carpenter does:  He continues to use his hammer, saw, and 
screwdrivers for as long as they remain useful to him.  He does NOT go out 
each year and buy the next model of hammer, just because it has a few more 
features than the old one did.

     Furthermore, make a decision to not let yourself become upset with 
Apple or with Apple dealers who were not interested in promoting the Apple 
II or IIgs.  From their point of view, they were (and are) trying to make a 
living.  As mentioned above, they didn't have much of a profit margin on 
the Apple II, and they had to pay the rent, their employees, and feed their 
kids.  Apple could possibly have changed this by dropping dealer cost for 
the IIgs, but that would have dropped APPLE'S profit margin, and make them 
interested sooner in discontinuing the IIe and IIgs.  RESOLVE to 
emotionally divorce yourself from Apple and what it did or did not do.  
Time showed us that we couldn't MAKE them change their attitudes, so why 
get ulcers over it?

ACCEPT PRESENT REALITY   This sounds somewhat defeatist, but it has a
''''''''''''''''''''''   positive reason.  Accepting what has already 
occurred (Apple's discontinuation of first the IIgs, and then the IIe) can 
make it easier to decide what you want to DO with your computer NOW, 
instead of fussing over what might have been.  Even if Apple NEVER releases 
another piece of hardware or system software for the Apple II or IIgs, they 
have provided us with tools that can be used for years to keep our hardware 
and software investment useful.

USE WHAT YOU HAVE TO ITS FULLEST   If you are using your Apple II for word
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   processing, or desktop publishing, or 
home finances, and it still works, is the End Of The Apple II really that 
big a deal?  There are still many people in this country using Apple II 
=PLUS= computers on a daily basis, because that is all the computer they 
have found that they need.  They are not suffering because they cannot run 
a desktop publishing program like Publish-It! or GraphicWriter, or a font 
enhancer like Pointless; it is just not much of a priority with them.  Dean 
Esmay, former chief sysop on GEnie's A2 Roundtable, put it well when he 
stated the following back in 1992:  "The bandits in the Apple II division 
have always done their best to bring the machine to its ultimate limits and 
past them, DESPITE the idiot marketing and the high corporate officials, 
[whose actions] those guys couldn't do anything about.  They've given us 
all they could to take the machine to its furthest abilities.  If the 
higher ups decide to drop it now that's not going to change much of 
anything for any of us.  Look at the Apple III.  That thing sold barely 
100,000 units before being discontinued and there are STILL people using 
it, STILL companies out there supporting it.  Up to [1989 or so] there were 
people still writing software for it, and at that time the machine had been 
discontinued for at least five years.  AND with only 100,000 or so ever 
sold!  There are at least fifteen times that many IIgs systems, and at 
least thirty times that many IIe/IIc systems, not even counting the clones.  
And a lot more software already available."<1>  The IIe, IIc, and IIgs 
should be useful for a LONG time yet.

     Now, if you are a major computer game aficionado, it may bother you 
that there are no longer lots of games being released for the Apple II or 
IIgs.  There ARE still some new games being released for the IIgs, and the 
quality is better than ever.  If that is not enough for you, though, 
perhaps you would be happier with a Nintendo (oops!  I mean the Super 
Nintendo, which is incompatible with cartridges for the old Nintendo.  No, 
wait; the Ultra Nintendo, with 32 bit graphics and seventeen joystick modes 
and...).  Just remember, ANY game machine or computer will be made obsolete 
someday.

FIND AND HELP NEW USERS   Another area where local Apple II user groups can
'''''''''''''''''''''''   meet a need is in the growing number of people 
who are new owners of used Apple II equipment.  Because there are many who 
have jumped the Apple II ship for the MS-DOS or Mac world, there are quite 
a few Apple II, II Plus, IIe, IIc, and IIgs computers that appear on the 
used market at bargain prices.  The prices on these used computers are 
often low enough that an interested person can justify buying one just to 
try it out ($200 compared to $1200 makes it as affordable as a VCR).  If it 
was interested in providing such a service, an Apple II user group could 
place small ads (perhaps in the classified sections of a newspaper or home 
shopper circular) to tell any new Apple II owners in the community that 
knowledgeable people are available to help them.

     If they felt so inclined, user groups could even act as buying and 
selling coordinators for used Apple II hardware and software.  This could 
make it easier both for those trying to sell used equipment, as well as for 
those looking to buy such equipment.  This would require a higher level of 
volunteer time in these groups, but has the potential of stimulating a 
growth of membership.


CONCLUSION: ENJOY YOURSELF!   The current era of Apple II computing has the
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   potential of being as exciting as the 
original days, when every new program was a discovery in learning more 
about the machine.  As a community, Apple II users need to determine the 
direction of their own future, since Apple Computer, Inc. is unlikely to be 
putting much (if any) energy into that area.  In 1977, the major sources of 
hardware and software were not from computer stores or Apple itself, but 
rather from the users.  In a sense, that is also true today.  The days of 
making a million dollars writing software for this machine are probably 
long past, but there are still many hackers out there who can write new and 
useful programs that will maintain our hardware investment.  These authors 
can distribute their products as shareware through major online services, 
or possibly as a commercial program through one of the few remaining Apple 
II software distributors (such as Quality Computers, Seven Hills Software, 
Econ, and others), or through one of the other companies mentioned above 
that continue to actively support the II.  Users of the Apple II can help 
maintain the flow of Apple II-related products by BUYING what they use 
(instead of making illegal copies), and by paying the shareware fees for 
what they download from online services.

     We have the unique opportunity to actually direct and mold the future 
of the Apple II ourselves.  Decide how you want to participate, and have 
fun with your computer!  Find ways in which you can use your "antique" 
computer and STILL amaze your friends ("I didn't know you could do THAT on 
an Apple II!")

     Apple II Forever?

     Well, NOTHING lasts FOREVER... but it can last as long as we want it 
to!
