Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""

    [EDITOR.A2]



                         >>> READ ALL ABOUT IT <<<
                         """""""""""""""""""""""""

     As I write this, things don't look good for Apple Computer, Inc.  
Resist the urge to cackle.  This is not good news for us.

     Strangely--or maybe not--neither is it the issue that's uppermost on 
our minds!  It looks as though we'll have three new newsletters this year:  
The AppleWorks Gazette, which has already published its first issue, and 
Apple Blossom and Juiced.GS, which will publish shortly.

     Apple Blossom and Juiced.GS are similar but certainly not identical 
newsletters.  Is there still room for two such publications in the Apple II 
world?  Where there's competition, some duplication of effort is 
inevitable.  Will resources be stretched too thin?  Can we still afford 
that?  This is a question that many are discussing on the A2 RoundTable.  
Eric Schonblom summed up concerns nicely when he said "our world has grown 
too small for competition, but is just the right size for cooperation."

     Last year, we lost A2-Central, GS+, NAUG's AppleWorks Forum and 
TimeOut-Central, so isn't it right that new magazines should rise to take 
their place?  Absolutely.  But none of publications were the work of a 
single person.  A2-Central was (latterly) edited by me with regular 
material being written by Steve Weyhrich and Tom Weishaar's guiding hand as 
publisher.  GS+ was published and edited by Steve Disbrow, but he had Joe 
Wankerl to handle the programming.  NAUG was not a one-man operation.  
Randy Brandt and Will Nelken worked together, again with Tom Weishaar in 
the background, to produce TimeOut-Central.

     The new publications seem, at first blush, to be one-person 
operations.  Starting this month, and continuing for the next two, we hope 
to bring you interviews with the publishers of the newest three 
newsletters.  This month you can read a profile of Max Jones, publisher of 
Juiced.GS.  Next month, we've planned a profile of Steve Cavanaugh, 
publisher of Apple Blossom.  After that, we hope to get a look inside The 
AppleWorks Gazette.

     You might share my nightmare vision of Steve Cavanaugh, Max Jones, 
Joe Kohn, Clark Stiles and me all competing over the same stories and the 
same customers.  There's no real need to worry; it was just a bad dream.  
The editors are aware of this pitfall.  There seems to be a continued 
effort to keep the competition co-operative, however counter-intuitive that 
sounds.

     Moving from nightmares to daydreams, some of you probably also share 
my dream that we could have a nice monthly magazine with feature articles, 
regular columns, and reviews instead of bi-monthlies and quarterlies.  
Unfortunately, it is just a dream.  Why?  Because one-person ventures don't 
need much money.  When you're the only employee, you needn't worry about 
making enough money to cover your wages, only your out-of-pocket expenses.

     Tom Weishaar is a fine writer/editor.  When the publication details 
started to interfere with his writing, he promoted himself to publisher and 
found a new editor.  This worked well, since Tom is also a fine publisher.  
I just hate to think of all our best writers and editors spending most of 
their time being publishers.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Speaking of good writers, I'm happy to announce that I didn't have to 
put together this issue by myself, so you'll find contributions here from 
our old friends Charlie Hartley, Jay Curtis, Phil Shapiro and Ryan Suenaga 
plus new friends James Keim, Ed Lundberg, and Max Jones.  This makes for 
one of our best all-around issues in past little while.

     We're always interested in articles, folks, and we do pay.  For every 
article, we make sure that your GEnie account is credited with the 
equivalent of non-prime time hours!

     We're particularly eager to continue to MINI_BYTES column.  This is 
an old favorite in other versions of GEnieLamp (ST and IBM), but it's 
making its debut here in GEnieLamp A2.  Here's how it works:

     Three reviewers download the same file from the A2 libraries and 
write an extremely brief review of it.  The readers get three different 
takes on one program, and the reviewers get one non-prime time hour 
credited to their accounts.  One free hour on GEnie for writing as little 
as one paragraph!

     If you'd like to join in, please send me E-mail *first*.  We have to 
get three people to agree on one file, which is the tricky part. :-)

     You'll notice that the PAUG Newsletter is missing from this issue.  
The devil of it is, I'm sure not when it will be back.  Look for an 
announcement from PAUG soon, presumably in next month's GEnieLamp A2.

Letters To The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""



NO ANIMASIA 3-D...?   I got around to reading the latest [GEnieLamp A2].
"""""""""""""""""""   It was good and I like the JMS quotes, but in your 
editorial about how we made out like bandits in '95, I noticed you didn't 
mention Animasia 3-D as one of the new pieces of GS software.  Actually, if 
you did mention it, I would be surprised because it was released on 2 
February 1995, which is too far back for anyone to remember.

Michael Lutynski [ANIMASIA]
Animasia 3-D

          I apologize unreservedly for the omission.  I had assumed 
          Animasia 3-D was released in late 1994, since that's when the ads 
          and releases started appearing (including the one in GEnieLamp 
          A2).  I should have double-checked with you before publication... 
          a procedure I would have definitely followed if there had been 
          any doubt in my mind.  Unfortunately, there was no doubt in my 
          mind, and there should have been.  Mea maxima culpa.


NO MEGADEMO...?   In your January editorial of [GEnieLamp A2] you reviewed
"""""""""""""""   the year 1995 on new Apple II hard- and software.  
Although you covered nearly all new products (which isn't too hard, since, 
unfortunately, there weren't that much), you did not mention the Ninjaforce 
Megademo that came out in February 1995.  Being the biggest _real_ GS demo 
ever, it caught a lot of attention across the II related areas on the 
Internet (and also on GEnie), making it one of the _biggest_ software 
events on the GS in 1995.

     The demo got many _outstanding_ praises, like...

     "It's the best anything I've ever seen on the GS!"--Brett Victor

     "I truly LOVE the MegaDemo!  It is the BEST I have ever seen!  This 
is one piece of software that I am going to blow the Mac people in the next 
room when I attend the next meeting in the local AUG!"--Willie Yeo 
(Kingfisher)

     So, we just cannot understand that the Megademo was not covered in 
your editorial.  We know that many Americans tend to dislike European style 
demos, but the point is that the Megademo _impresses_ about every GS user, 
and really impressive GS software is hard to find these days.

-- Jesse Blue & Clue
   Ninjaforce
   ug0a@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de

     P.S.:  We'll continue to produce _quality_ software for the GS. Check 
out 'Deskplay' and the 'Megademo Hard Disk Installer' (both should be 
available on GEnie by the time you read this), and if you've missed 
watching the Megademo, then please, do it now!

          I am sorry that you feel slighted.  As you will understand from 
          the Animasia letter above, sometimes I forget and sometimes I 
          make mistakes.

          However, in my editorial, I didn't list every freeware/shareware 
          program, and I didn't list _any_ demos.  I was not discriminating 
          against your program specifically, I was discriminating in favour 
          of all programs that were useful.  If I had my time back, I would 
          make the same decision.  However impressive your demo, it remains 
          a demo, and demos do not fit in to my personal definition of 
          "significant software".

          I was attempting to list things that I thought would show how 
          the Apple II was still useful.  I tried to list every commercial 
          release I could remember, as I thought those would have a 
          cheering effect.  If the readers had seen me "padding" a list 
          with minor freeware/shareware releases and demos, the effect 
          would not have been cheering, but depressing.  If I try too hard 
          to make the point that things are bright, doubt starts to creep 
          in--one starts to wonder if my case is so darned strong, since 
          I'm grasping at every straw available.

          All the same, I am glad Ninjaforce is around and programming and 
          look forward to your producing quality software for the IIgs.


>>>>>   You wrote:
"""""
     "However impressive your demo, it remains a demo, and demos do not 
fit in to my personal definition of 'significant software'.".

     This is discussable.  A game is considered useful because it is 
entertaining, right?  Well, this also goes for demos that entertain people 
by showing off the machine.

     But this is just as we thought:  Many Americans dislike European 
style software-demos.  No way around it.

-- Jesse Blue & Clue
   Ninjaforce
   ug0a@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de

          This is discussable?  A _personal_ definition??  The _validity_ 
          of my definitions is debatable, sure, but even as editor of 
          GEnieLamp A2, I'm allowed to have my opinions, and the editorial 
          is the place to air them.

          With regard to their being no way around Americans disliking 
          European-style demos, please note the following:

          1.  I am not American;* I am a Canadian working in, living in, 
              and editing GEnieLamp A2 from Canada.

          2.  I have never seen the MegaDemo.  This means I do not know if 
              its style is European.  Obviously I did not exclude it from 
              my list on the basis of its style if I have never seen it.

          3.  I had not realized Ninjaforce were from Europe.  Obviously I 
              cannot seriously be accused of discriminating against 
              Europeans if I didn't know Europeans had programmed the demo.

          To accuse me of prejudice on the basis of one incident is not 
          only silly and ridiculous; it is malicious.  If it were not for 
          the malice, your letter would not warrant a reply, public or 
          private.  To make such groundless insinuations merely because you 
          are displeased with me is hardly the mark of a professional.  The 
          same is true of the fact that you began by assuming a slight 
          rather than an oversight.

          I can only restate what I said before.  I didn't include your 
          demo in the list because I did not and do not consider it to be a 
          major achievement.  I was amused by the Opale demo--also 
          programmed by European programmers--but I still don't consider it 
          a highlight of 1994.  The fact that MegaDemo was not mentioned in 
          my editorial had nothing to do with the nationality of its 
          programmers.

          I am reluctant to champion MegaDemo now for the same reason I 
          didn't download it when it appeared on GEnie--it requires an 
          accelerator.  However, as by now Ninjaforce has had far more 
          exposure than any of the significant new products of 1995 got 
          from my original editorial, I don't imagine I need to champion 
          it.

          Readers who want to examine MegaDemo should download files 
          #24590 and #24591 from the A2 library.  If you have a ROM 3 IIgs, 
          you should also download file #24623, which patches the demo for 
          that machine.  You may also want to download the recent upload 
          file #26444, which finally allows the demo to be run from a hard 
          drive (this is the installer mentioned by Ninjaforce above).  
          PLEASE NOTE that you will still need an accelerator card to run 
          this demo on your IIgs.

          (Say, do you suppose there's anything to the rumor that 
          Ninjaforce are prejudiced against me and anyone else who didn't 
          own an accelerator when their demo appeared...?  Nah.)

          For those intrigued by mention of Deskplay, you will find that 
          v2.01 is file #26452 in the A2 library.

          * NOTE FOR ALL NON-AMERICAN AND NON-CANADIAN READERS:  We 
          Canadians are used to being mistaken for Americans--by Europeans, 
          Africans... practically everyone, in fact.  When we Canadians 
          gently correct the mistake, the reply is usually "Oh, of course I 
          meant _North_ American!" instead of an admission of what is, 
          after all, an understandable mistake.  We don't know why no one 
          will admit to the fact that they made an incorrect assumption, 
          but they won't.  Relax, everyone.  It's a minor gaffe at worst.

          So what's a major gaffe?  Assuming that Canadians and Americans 
          are "the same thing".  Assuming that Austrians and Germans are 
          the same.  Assuming that New Zealanders and Australians are the 
          same.  And not knowing the difference between a gaffe and a faux 
          pas. <grin>

FOOL ME TWICE....   Yesterday I heard on National Public Radio about an ad 
"""""""""""""""""   that Apple has taken out.  Supposedly addressed to MAC 
users, but the comment was that it was really addressed to investors -- 
something about Apple is not about to go out of business.  And that they 
would continue to manufacture MAC computers.  (Darn I wish I had been home 
when I heard it.  I would have taped it.)

     But, the comment that drew the most snikkers by the commentators was 
that there was an internet address that one could write to:

          "Apple.Forever@Apple.Com"

of Copland, and "products based on the PowerPC microprocessor, the Newton 
platform and Pippin technology - the television-based affordable multimedia

APPLE IIE EMULATION ON MACINTOSH   Well, I don't know where else to post 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   this, so here goes.

     I just finished running a disk that has Squirt on it.  From Squirt I 
was able to boot up Shrink It 3.0.1, AppleWorks 2.0 with TimeOut, and 
Point-to-Point.  In AppleWorks I was able to type, check spelling with 
QuickSpell, and make changes to the user dictionary.  I ran all of these 
programs on a Mac LCIII--without a IIe card!

     Today I downloaded "IIe 1.0" an Apple //e emulator for the Macintosh! 
 It is able to work with disk images, or with a disk in the internal disk 
drive of the Macintosh.  It is in an early stage of developement, and 
naturally ran pretty slowly on my LCIII (a 68040 or PowerPC would really 
help here), but it did work (and it's only about 320K).

     I'll be uploading this to the Mac Roundtable this weekend, but I 
figured there might be one or two people here who would be interested ;^)

     At this point, the emulator isn't supposed to be able to save to disk 
(it couldn't save my AppleWorks file) but it does run.  I was pretty darned 
impressed.  The author (in Australia) is asking for help in further 
development so that he can get the emulator to support the mouse, extended 
memory, etc.  Complete info is in the Read.Me.

     Note that to use this you will need to get a dump of the IIe 
ROMs...they are not distributed with the program for legal reasons.  
However, if you go to the 1WSW Web page, there is an emulators html 
document that will allow you to find a place to download them (for those of 
us less techinically inclined who don't know how to save the ROMs of our 
own IIe's).

II ALIVE TO PUBLISH QUARTERLY   After several e-mail messages to several 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   different people at S/QC, I guess I finally 
rattled enough cages and got a reply, by _phone_ this morning from Valery, 
regarding what was going on with II Alive.

     I was told that the Nov-Dec '95 issue was "in the mail".  They WERE 
planning to honor subscriptions for five(?) more issues on a quarterly 
basis.  I am _not_ exactly clear on how many they think they will publish; 
I was not fully awake here in Alaska when she called from Michigan, three 
hour time difference.

     She further said, a problem they had been having was lack of material 
to publish, not enough articles.

     That's what I was told today.

OUTPERFORMING A MAC ON ITS OWN TURF   Had to share this...

     Yesterday my son-in-law brought home some Mac disks that his

SE to disks to read on his new Mac.  Apparently they couldn't get any other 
Mac to read the disks.  I popped them in the GS and up they came with no 
problems at all.  Since they were formatted in HFS, I just copied the files 
over to another 800K HFS disk on the GS and then sneakerneted them over to 
my PB180 and copied them to freshly formatted disks there.  The professor 
will be estastic.  They contained some lesson files that he really didn't 
want to lose.

     Once again the GS shows its superiority. ;)

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPUTER ORPHANAGE   For what its worth, In today's Post 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Dispatch Newspaper here in St. Louis, 
there was a large article on orphan computers and what is happening with 
them.  Many are being refurbished and given to families with young children 
who could not otherwise afford to have a computer.  Most of the computers 
in question are Apple II's.  One of the concerns of these new users was the 
lack of software.

So, I took the liberty of sending a fax to the editor of the paper, asking 
that these folks who are looking for software, should go online and join 
GEnie.  I more or less guaranteed that there was plenty of software 
available for the Apple II, right here.  And plenty of help from a lot of 
good people.

     My point is, I wouldn't have done this if I didn't expect this 
service to be around for a long time to come.  And the more folks we can 
get here, the better.  Right? :)

facility, etc.  But essentially, the final word was something like this:

     Apple is required by U.S.law to have repair parts in stock for all 
products for no less than 11 years after the initial date of introduction.

     Apple is also required by U.S.law to have repair parts in stock and 
to honor any warrenty upgrade program which Apple initiates for no less 
than 11 years after the initial date of manufacture of the specified 
"defective" part.

IIGS WEB BROWSER SPECULATION   Writing a commercial web browser for the GS 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   is something that I've seriously considered 
doing these past several weeks.  After talking to UNIX people and reading 
the HTTP & HTML protocols until my eyeballs twitched, I've learned that 
creating such a project is definately doable.  There are several issues 
that need to be addressed, however.

     o Procyon has to first release GNO 1.0.6, which includes TCP/IP, a 
       necessary component of Internetting.

     o You'd have to buy or upgrade to GNO 1.0.6.

     o You'd have to buy SLIP, a component sold separately, so you could 
       hook into the Internet.

     o You'd have to subscribe to a local Internet service provider and 
       make sure they provide SLIP access (many do).

     o Then you'd have to buy the GS web browser, whatever it would be 
       called.

     That adds up.  Would you still be willing to buy a GS web browser 
for, say, $50-$60?  I think the people who still have and use GS's would do 
so, but it's something to think about.

     And you'd have to wait several months because the job of writing a 
web browser to support the HTML 2.0 specification is not a trivial task.  
I'd love to do it and gain the experience, but I do not currently have the 
resources available to ensure that I could work full-time for the duration 
of the project.  (However, if a dozen people were to order Animasia 3-D 
=from me,= I'd probably be all set.)

     As you can see, writing large-scale, professional software for the GS 
would be a heckuva lot easier if the real world didn't have to intrude.

     Now, do you still want a web browser for the GS?

>>>>>   The major stumbling block of a GS graphical web browser is speed. 
"""""   A 28,800 bps modem is an absolute must, but the real slowdown would 
be decompressing and displaying the graphics.  It's easier (and faster) 
with a Second Sight card because the graphics do not have to be "converted" 
for display on the standard GS screen, but it would still be slow.  GIFs 
wouldn't be too bad unless they're really big, but JPGs take a long time to 
decompress even on a fast GS.  Heck, even Mac and PC power users often turn 
off the graphics because they're so slow.

     That said, I'd still pay any reasonable amount of money for a GS 
graphical web browser.  GNO/ME 2.0.6 (I think Mike incorrectly said 1.0.6) 
will have the ability to do TCP/IP, which has been written by a third party 
and is supposed to be available shortly.  SLIP should also be available 
soon.  All the parts are there, someone just has to write the browser.

HELP WITH FINE-TUNING PMPFAX   First, PMPFax requires System 6.0.1 to work.  
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   About memory, I recommend having about 1.5 
megs of RAM free, but it will work with less.   It all depends on how many 
pages are in faxes you're sending and what features and all you're using at 
any one time.  Because it does take up quite a bit of RAM, I've also 
included a stand-alone app that you can use instead of the NDA if you're 
running low on memory.

     About 8-bit programs... PMPFax only works with GS/OS desktop-based 
applications that use the Print Manager to print.  If you are using an 
8-bit program, then you will have to get your documents into a form that a 
desktop app can use.  With AW, this is fairly simple, since AWGS and 
several NDA text editors will accept AW WP files and the like.  I'm not 
sure how you could translate PI files into a form a desktop app can use 
since I've never used PI.

     In actual use I DID manage to transmit FAXs from Hermes/Shadowrite 
successfully, but, since faxing is a general memory hog, your mileage may 
vary considerably.  If you don't have it, I would suggest using WriteAway 
to import AWP documents into, and FAX from.  Version 2.0 is available in 
the Library and it is not nearly the memory 'gobbler' that Finder is.

     If you are storing your FAX's for later transmission, an application 
like Platinum Paint is great for using PMPFax's NDA.  It requires very 
lttle memory to load, and even has a neat little 'Free Memory' indicator

     Bear, those are the same two errors I got recently.  Except I think 
the second was MarkResourceChange2
                                 ~
     I assumed it was due to the sender not having defined a station ID in 
his Mac fax software however I'm not at all certain about this.  After he 
entered an ID (and I powered my modem off and on) I received his fax ok.  
Not very scientific :-( so I'm not at all sure what the problem was/is.  I

the latest updates.  If you'd like me to email you the currently fixed 
problems (the three I mentioned), send me mail here and I'll send them to 
you.  The changes will only be to two of the files, the PMPFaxApp file and 
the PMPFaxEdit file (which should be put into the PMPFax.Code directory in 
your System directory).

     Thanks, Roger :)

<<<<<   Well, I've fixed the problem with class 1 and the new USR modems. 
"""""   I've already uploaded the fixes to everyone who has requested them.  
The problem with class 1 was really minor, but enough to thoroughly confuse 
the software :)  However, class 2.0 seems to be doing generally weird 
things.  Not PMPFax, but the modem.  I'm wondering if the USR 
implementation might be a little bit flakey.  Anyway, until I can get 
another class 2.0 modem that is non-USR for testing (hint, hint), I won't 
release any changes I make to the class 2 and 2.0 code.  If anyone has a 
class 2.0 modem that works perfectly as-is with PMPFax, please let me know.  
Thanks!

     * The newsletter will become bi-monthly instead of quarterly
     * Regular columns will appear, including the following,
          #HyperTalking - HyperCard stack design and script writing
          #The Other Side of the Rainbow - Cross-platform computing
          #The Well-integrated Computer - AppleWorks & AppleWorks GS

JUICED.GS, APPLE IIGS-SPECIFIC NEWSLETTER   In the past year, users of 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Apple IIGS personal computers 
have been forced to bid farewell to magazine and disk publications that 
supported them well through the years.

     Today, however, they have the opportunity to say say hello, and 
welcome, to a new member of their community.

     A quarterly printed publication dedicated to covering the IIGS world 
is about to arrive on the scene.

     Juiced.GS, a journal that will focus exclusively on the IIGS, will 
begin publication in the first quarter of 1996.  It will present feature 
articles and columns touting the strengths of the IIGS and the software 
needed to push it to its limits.  It will explore topics ranging from 
desktop publishing and graphics to system management to telecommunications. 

     The newsletter will also present in-depth reviews of new commercial 
software and hardware, features on existing commercial products, up-to-date 
reports from the software and hardware development front, and assessments 
on the latest and hottest shareware/freeware releases.  In each issue, 
readers will also learn how to get access to a disk loaded with shareware 
and freeware uploaded to Internet ftp sites and on-line services during the 
previous quarter, as well as usable templates, graphics, sound and music 
files.

     Most importantly, Juiced.GS will report on what users across the IIGS 
spectrum are doing to squeeze the most out of their personal computers.  
Although the emphasis will be decidely focused on productivity, all topics 
related to the IIGS will be open to discussion. Users will be invited to 
submit articles, columns and letters concerning their specific interests in 
the IIGS world.

     The newsletter will be published entirely on an Apple IIGS using 
IIGS-specific software with page proofs printed on a high-quality 
IIGS-compatible printer.  Page layouts promise to be innovative and 
compelling, with special emphasis placed on showing users how principles of 
page design and typography can be applied to their own desktop publishing 
creations using readily available page-layout software.

     Juiced.GS will be edited and published by Max Jones, a longtime IIGS 
user and computer hobbiest.  When not tinkering with his home computer, he 
is the editorial page editor of the Tribune-Star, a 42,000-circulation 
daily newspaper in Terre Haute, Ind.  In his 21 years of newspaper 
experience, Jones has worked in many phases of publishing, from reporting, 
writing and editing, to photography, page design and product management.  
He has won awards for news and editorial writing, editing and page design, 
and is currently a member of a newsroom team preparing to put the 
Tribune-Star onto the World Wide Web.

     Each issue of Juiced.GS will contain 20 pages and be delivered via 
U.S. mail.  The first issue is scheduled for release in mid-February.

     If you would like to see what form this new publication will take, 
the Juiced.GS prototype newsletter is available for download from GEnie's 
A2 Roundtable Library 48 (File number 26290), and the Cal Tech Apple II 
archive ftp site on the Internet (ftp.cco.caltech.edu/pub/apple2).  
AppleWorks GS v1.1 and at least an ImageWriter II printer are required to 
print the files.

     Subscriptions for 1996 (four issues - winter, spring, summer and 
fall) are now available at an introductory rate of $12 in the United States 
and Canada.  Overseas subscriptions are $18.  Subscriptions must be 
postmarked by Feb. 15 to be eligible for this introductory rate.

     After the first issue is mailed, the subscription price for all four 
1996 issues will rise to $14 in the U.S. and Canada, and $20 elsewhere.

     A Juiced.GS subscription comes with a money-back guarantee.  If at 
any time during the course of the year you wish to cancel, you will be 
refunded for the balance of your subscription.

     (For those who prefer not to purchase a full subscription, single 
copies of Juiced.GS will be available for $4 in the U.S. and Canada, $6 
overseas.)

     Please do not delay.  Being a charter subscriber will help ensure 
that Juiced.GS gets off to rousing start in what promises to be an exciting 
10th anniversary year for the Apple IIGS.

     To become a charter subscriber for 1996, send a personal check or 
money order for $12 ($18 overseas) to:

     your own label templates.

 -*- Works with all IIGS fonts.

 -*- Performs bulk sortations and prints postal bar codes for reduced

NEW VERSION OF TALKING TOOLS
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

 GS-12  Talking Tools 1.0.2                $35
        Update from any earlier version    $10

     Talking Tools adds speech to any Apple IIGS, without adding any 
additional hardware!  Our package is laid out for programmers, but it is 
useful for non-programmers too.

     Programmers get the First Byte talking tools, the Byte Works patches 
to the First Byte tools, complete interfaces for ORCA/M, ORCA/C and 
ORCA/Pascal, and two sample programs, along with documentation that covers 
how they work.  The documentation describes the Pascal version of the 
programs, but source is included for all three languages.

     Non-programmers can use Talking Tools with other applications, like 
Spectrum from Seven Hills Software, that support speech as an option.  You 
can also use the SpeakIt talking editor that comes with Talking Tools.  It 
can load and read any plain text file!

     Our new update brings all of the source code up to date with the 
latest tool interfaces and fixes all known bugs in the original SpeakIt 
talking editor.  The update is just $10.

     And you can even get the update free!  If you ordered Talking Tools 
after November 1st, 1995, all you have to do to get the update is ask for 
it.  If you order any other product (except another update disk) at the 
same time, we'll give any registered owner of Talking Tools a free update!

<<<<<   Ken, the SpeakIt program in Talking Tools was pretty old.  The
"""""   original source doesn't compile under the current ORCA interfaces.  
I fixed that.

     The SpeakIt program itself had several bugs.  When System 6.0 was 
released, diamonds started showing up in the word entry dialogs.  Using one 
of the scroll bars caused crashes.  There were a couple of other more minor 
problems.

     These have been corrected in the latest release.

PRODUCTS FROM EGO SYSTEMS   I'm right in the middle of getting our new 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   catalog to the printer, so I haven't had time 
to make press releases or official announcements for this, but I just 
wanted everyone to know that EGO Systems is now carrying the following 
products:

  Price includes shipping to us/canada/mex.  Surface
  mail elsewhere is $5 extra, air mail is $10 extra.

RETURN OF RAMFAST FOR THE APPLE IIE
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Good News IIe Comrades! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     Sequential Systems now sells a RamFAST specifically for the IIe. 
<yes> It works with the ZipChip, but not the Transwarp.

     I ordered one and await its arrival.

     I don't know much about it, but was told that the bus drivers were 
changed to accommodate the IIe.

     You may recall that two years ago Harold and Drew discussed online 
what it would take to make the Rev D RamFAST work reliably in an 
accelerated IIe.

     Drew said to make a Rev D board work would involve swapping all the 
74HCT bus drivers (5) with stronger 74LS parts, at the expense of using a 
little more current.  Also, a trace would need to be cut, a jumper wired 
on, and the DMA control PAL re-programmed.

     I guess this is what has happened.

     Of course, DMA will have to be off if a ZipChip is used, but I'm 
still expecting performance to be very, very good.

     And, I'll find out first hand if a RamFAST will allow a cold boot 
from a ZipDrive without a prior access attempt having been made.

     We'll see.

SEQUENTIAL TO RETURN TO GENIE?   Friday (January 5, 1996), I received a
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   brief but informative phone call from 
Joseph at Sequential Systems.  Joseph is owner/president of Sequential 
Systems.

     The basics of the discussion are that:

     Sequential Systems is very much alive and well!
     They intend to continue to manufacture and market Apple II products 
as they have been!
     They intend to actively support those products!
     They are very busy right now and especially busy picking up some of 
the pieces following the departure of Jawaid, who was apparently doing some 
work without assistance (now he's gone, what did he do and how did he do 
it, that sort of thing?).

     Sequential Systems will be active here on GEnie in some capacity, as 
soon as they get things down to normal and have the time to do so.

     I suggested that Joseph also speak with Joe Kohn and he agreed that 
this was a very good suggestion.

     Dr. Tom is NOT an official (or anything else) spokesperson of 
Sequential Systems.  He was told that he had permission to post information 
about Sequential Systems on his Web Site and apparently Dr. Tom took that 
to mean he could act as spokesperson for Sequential Systems.

     This is the beginnings of good news, IMHO.

NAUG DISKS FROM SHAREWARE SOLUTIONS II   As mentioned previously, Shareware
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Solutions II is to become the 
repository of all the disks that were previously available from the 
National AppleWorks User Group.  Included are two types of 
disks...AppleWorks template disks that had previously been available from 
the NAUG Library, and NAUG On Disk that had only previously been available 
by subscription.

     I wanted to let folks know that SSII will be offering NAUG's paper 
based catalog of disk, but since that catalog only goes up to 1994, there 
will be a supplement catalog offered on disk.  The disk is not quite ready 
yet as my first priority is to finish up the long overdue SSII newsletter, 
but when it is ready, I will be making the catalog + disk available, as a 
package, for $5.  That price, as usual, includes postage to anywhere in the 
world.

     Likewise, all the NAUG template disks and NAUG On Disk will also be 
available for $5 each, which also includes Air Mail postage to anywhere.

     Three of us spent a very pleasant Saturday taking Jane's ROM 4 GS 
apart, right down to removing the motherboard, and photographing everything 
as we went.  Jim Pittman is organizing the material.

     I didn't notice too many crash problems with the machine.  The disk 
doesn't eject, but that appears to be a problem with the drive itself.  At 
first, Jim Wifall though the machine was crashing when you drug a floppy to 
the trash, but it turns out it was just getting stuck in a loop telling a 
semi-dead floppy drive eject mechanism to do it's thing.  When the disk is 
manually ejected, the machine recovers nicely.

     And this, incidntally, is the reason for my interest in a ROM 
snatcher. :)

     Perhaps even more remarkable from a historical perspective is the 
300dpi 24 bit scan I have of the photo that was _supposed_ to go on the 
Apple II Buyer's Guide--the one with the Mark Twain machine in the picture, 
rather than the Mark Twain book.

                >>> FINDING YOUR OWN SPECIAL COMMUNITY <<<
                """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Last month I started a subscription to a new mailing list (listserv) 
that has me all excited about mailing lists again.  This new mailing list, 
WWWEDU, discusses the uses of the world wide web for educational purposes.

     For the past three years I've been an active participant in the 
Kidsphere mailing list, one of the largest worldwide mailing lists for 
educators.  The Kidsphere community is vibrant, hopping, varied, and 
interesting.  It is also populated with a large number of newbies.  (For 
those who might not know, "newbies" is the term used to describe newcomers 
to the online world.)

     To be sure, I like newbies.  They often bring with them new ideas, 
new energy, and new insights.  But I don't want to spend all my time 
hanging out with newbies.  That would be like hanging out for four years in 
the freshman lounge in high school.

     The WWWEDU crowd tends to be more technically knowledgeable.  On 
WWWEDU you don't often see the question, "Where do I plug in the phone line 
that comes out of the back of my modem?"

     For now, WWWEDU is my own special online community.  It's the 
community I most closely identify with.  I haven't disowned Kidsphere yet.  
Just that I've shifted some of my time and energy to participating in the 
WWWEDU community.

     As I make that shift, I've taken to thinking about what it is that 
makes a person identify with a community.  People identify with a 
community, online or offline, for all sorts of different reasons.  Usually 
a community is composed of people who share a similar outlook and values as 
you do.  Usually community members are people who find themselves in 
somewhat of a similar situation to yourself.

     Communities are composed of stated and unstated rules and guidelines 
of behavior.  Courtesy to fellow community members is an underlying theme 
of all communities.  When the courtesy begins to break down, the strength 
of the community itself begins to erode.

     In terms of listserv communities, the entire existence of the 
community is invented by the community members each and every day.  Within 
the general confines of the listserv subject-matter, listserv subscribers 
can choose to post any sort of public message they wish.

     Some of the messages posted to listservs are truly remarkable.  About 
once a week I read a listserv message that resounds with community spirit, 
written in a way that makes me feel proud to be a member of that community.  
You can almost feel the personal presence of the person who wrote such a 
message.  Who they are, as a human being, is carried forth in the words 
they choose to write.

     While I'm currently quite fond of the WWWEDU community, I'm sure that 
I'll be moving on to other "special communities" as I come to more closely 
connect with others of shared interest.  I won't leave WWWEDU permanently 
behind.  Just that I'll shift my time and energy to participating in the 
community that most closely vibrates in harmony with my own personal vibes.

     Can a person ever get too much community?  Me thinks not.  The human 
animal is above all a social animal.  We are most alive when we are 
participating in social interactions.

     Social interactions, interspersed with lively intellectual exchanges, 
are the hallmarks of a successful online community.  A community is 
something that you feel proud to belong to and committed to supporting.  
Communities nourish the soul, and ask only that the soul nourish the 
community in return.

Deja II AppleWorks Emulator
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Jay Curtis
  [J.CURTIS8]



                  >>> TIMING APPLEWORKS 5 ON THE MAC <<<
                  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The commercial version of "Deja II," the AppleWorks emulation 
software for the Macintosh, is now available through JEM Software.  This 
emulation software will allow you to run AppleWorks and ALL enhancements on 
a Macintosh, just as they can be run on any enhanced Apple II or IIgs 
computer.<1>  If you are a never-say-die AppleWorks and Apple II user at 
home, but you find yourself increasingly pressured into using a Macintosh 
at work, you might want to look into the Deja II emulator, developed by 
Mark Munz and Randy Brandt. 
   
     In an article that appeared in the May 1995 GEnieLamp A2, I described 
how AppleWorks would be able to run on any '030 Macintosh or higher, 
including also the RISC-based, "Power Macintosh" systems.  Mark Munz, the 
author of Deja II, has cautioned, however, that Apple built several '030 
systems that used a 16-bit bus, and that they are slower than Apple's 
later, '030 systems which used a wider bus.  These differences, together 
with the presence or absence of cache video memory in your Mac, can also 
significantly affect performance.  Mark summarizes, "Mileage varies because 
Apple has a ton of different configurations, each of which can effect the 
performance of software."<2>

     While a few AppleWorks users have recently expressed concern about 
whether the speed of Deja II on the '030 and '040 Mac systems would be fast 
enough, my own research shows that speed on two of these newer Mac systems 
is quite acceptable.  An effort has been made by Randy and Mark to balance 
the emulator's processor performance with what Mark calls "user perceived 
performance."  This means that the focus has been to provide fastest speed 
for those functions most commonly called upon by users.  Accordingly, 
without actually timing anything, the emulator generally appears to run 
AppleWorks about as fast as an LC IIe PDS card, i.e. faster than a stock 
IIe, but slower than a IIgs.  

     In fact, the results of timed tests tend to support the subjective 
impression that Deja II runs about the same as a IIe card.  The tests were 
performed on AppleWorks files running under Deja II on both an '030, 33 mhz 
PowerBook, and on an '040, 25 mhz LC-475, and the results were compared 
with AppleWorks running on a RamFAST-equipped, Apple IIgs, configured to 
"Fast" mode, and with AppleWorks running on an Apple IIe PDS card, 
configured to "Fast" and "monochrome" modes.  The IIe card was installed in 
the same LC-475 used for the Deja II testing.

     All tests were performed on the same files loaded into AppleWorks 
5.1.  The files included a 100K-sized database (containing 1040 records), a 
223-line word processor file (containing 1755 words), and an AppleWorks 
spreadsheet designed to amortize mortgages and car payments.  AppleWorks 
5.1 was configured in all cases to load all program segments and the same 
enhancements to system RAM in each machine.  With the exception of the PDS 
test, all data was accessed from each machine's hard drive.<3>

     Results were rounded to the nearest whole number (in seconds) for 
comparison purposes.  As indicated earlier, readers are cautioned that 
considerable variability is likely between machines and under different 
computing conditions.  Results can depend upon quite a number of factors 
including such things as bus width, availability of video cache, hard drive 
access speed, system speed, use of color configuration, use of extensions, 
and memory overhead.

     On the following chart, "PDS" stands for AppleWorks running on the 
LC's IIe PDS card; "LC" stands for AppleWorks running IN EMULATION under 
Deja II on the LC-475's desktop, and "PB" stands for AppleWorks running in 
emulation on the PowerBook desktop:

                          IIgs    PDS     PB     LC

   SS Recalculation         18     30     42     21
   DB Sort                   3      5      9      7
   DB Find                  12     23     51     16
   Load DB                   9     28     42     24
   Spellcheck WP File        6      9     35     15
   Scroll WP File           11     14     22     22

   Averages                 09.8   18.2   33.5   17.5

   Launch to AW Main Menu
   From Desktop             14            13

     While the GS turned in the fastest performance overall, Deja II on 
the LC-475 was next fastest, at about 56% of GS speed.  The Deja II 
emulator on the LC-475 turned in near-GS performance in the spreadsheet 
recalculation  (21 seconds vs. 18 seconds for the GS) and in the database 
string search ("DB find") function (16 seconds vs. 12 seconds for the GS).  
On average, the Deja II emulation on the LC-475 was slightly faster than 
the IIe PDS card on the first six tests.  It was specifically somewhat 
SLOWER than the PDS card, however, in scrolling and spell-checking a word 
processor file.

     While many functions on the PowerBook, slowest of the four machines, 
seemed to run at acceptable speed, a few were maddeningly slow, especially 
the spell-check and the DB string search functions.  If the user were to 
base their use of AppleWorks only on these functions, they would probably 
consider an '030 PowerBook to be too slow for running AppleWorks.  Few 
users, however, would consider the speed of these specific functions to be 
crucial to their selection of AppleWorks for use on a Mac, and the real 
advantage of being able to run AppleWorks on a notebook system like the 
PowerBook, is hard to beat, regardless of speed.

     In spite of Deja II's apparent lethargy on the '030 PowerBook, it 
launches to the AppleWorks main menu in an extraordinarily fast time, much 
faster than it takes to launch a IIe PDS card and AppleWorks from an LC's 
finder.  Launching on the PowerBook was even slightly faster than launching 
from the ProSEL desktop on a RamFAST-equipped IIgs.  Using Deja II's 
snapshot feature, a user can have AppleWorks, AND all of the desktop files 
he was previously using, available in considerably faster time than they 
can be available on nearly ANY IIgs, no matter how fast.

     Since the majority of an AppleWorks user's time on a computer is 
spent in entering data and moving through files, reasonable scroll speed 
and keyboard response are an absolute must for comfort.  Bottom line here 
is that nothing is as fast as a character-based user interface, and the 
superior speed of the Apple II's CUI is probably one of the most important 
reasons many of us still continue to use Apple II's.  

     At 22 seconds each, scroll times were the same with Deja II on both 
the LC-475 and on the PowerBook, slower than a GS or PDS card.  However, 
this speed will still prove acceptable for most users, given that scrolling 
the same file (set to the same number of lines) from within Microsoft Works 
on the PowerBook also took 22 seconds in another test.  (Scrolling was done 
from within the file's window, using the cursor rather than scroll bar.)  
This result suggests that scroll speed is more a function of the Mac's 
graphical user interface than of the Deja II emulator.  

     Strictly speaking, the GS possessed the only REAL character-based 
user interface tested among the four configurations listed above.  Although 
Deja II provides a convincing AppleWorks desktop on the Mac, it really only 
emulates AppleWorks running on a GS or IIe with the Mac's graphical 
interface.  It should also be mentioned that even the LC IIe card's user 
interface is really nothing more than a Mac's graphical interpretation of a 
IIe's CUI.<4>

     In fact, the Mac's tendency to scroll things more slowly than an 
Apple II should not be a problem for most of us.  An advantage AppleWorks 
has over programs like Microsoft Works is its extensive macro capability, 
and use of the OA-1, OA-9 and OA-arrow command-key combinations makes it 
possible to move speedily through files in AppleWorks, no matter what kind 
of platform you happen to be running on.

     Unfortunately, I didn't have a IIe that I could use to make direct 
comparisons with Deja II.  However, a IIe PDS card, installed in an '030 or 
'040 LC, can potentially run about twice as fast as a real IIe.  With this 
in mind, I suspect that Deja II on most '040 Macs would probably be FASTER 
for most AppleWorks functions than a nonaccelerated IIe would be for 
processing the same files.  

     Similarly, I was also unable to access a Power Mac system for file 
testing.  However, it seems reasonable to assume that, if Deja II on a 25 
mhz '040 Mac can run at 56% of stock GS speed, then Deja II running on a 
60-100 mhz Power Mac ought to easily be able to match or eclipse a GS in 
speed.  In fact, Mark Munz said, "D2 [Deja II] shines better on PPC 
machines."  He said that there are "actually two 65c02 emulators in D2," 
one used by the 68x series machines and another used by the PPC.  Due to 
the way that a PPC works, he said, "we've been able to get more 
optimizations out of the PPC version than the 68x version." 

     According to Mark, "the emulator portion of D2 was rewritten about 
four times in the past year."  As much of the programming as possible was 
done "without resorting to pure assembly language."  In this way, it will 
be much easier to move Deja II "to another platform (like DOS or Windows)," 
he said.

     Mark said, "I believe we've done a fairly decent job in making 
AppleWorks a usable product on '030 and '040 machines, considering that we 
had originally only planned a PPC version."  He said that "Deja ][ requires 
a lot of processor power to emulate a 65c02 environment."  Because of this, 
he said, it will not be possible to get acceptable performance out of the 
slower, 68000 series Mac systems, and users should not expect to see an 
AppleWorks emulator for these systems.  Nonetheless, Mark said that he 
plans to continue to develop Deja II in the future, and a potential port of 
Deja II to an intel-based system seems like a distinct possibility.


                                   NOTES

     <1> AppleWorks 5.0 is required, and must be purchased separately, but 
         an upgrade to v5.1 is automatic with the purchase of Deja II.

     <4> A Macintosh, with a IIe PDS card installed, translates IIe video 
         output into the Mac's Quickdraw graphical language.  The fact that 
         Apple's engineer's were able to get programs to scroll as fast as 
         they do on the IIe card is something of an engineering 
         achievement.

FROM THE AUTHOR   You are a famous crimebuster hot on the trail of that 
"""""""""""""""   world-renowned thief, Carmen Santiago, and her latest 
gang.  The rumours that she had died in a bizarre accident don't deter you; 
after all, it might just be misdirection.  So you track her to the Dark 
Woods of I/O Error, where you encounter three hideous beasts and lose your 
way in the night.

     Virgil, a Greek poet, meets you in your frenzy and tells you that the 
only way out is through Hell itself.  "Alas," he continues, "the geography 
of Hell has changed since last I guided a mortal through it, and you will 
need assistance besides mine to get through the frozen caves of Cocytus to 
Paradise."

     "Who might this assistance come from?" you wonder aloud.

     "Why, from the latest arrival to the Inferno," your guide informs 
you. "Carmen Santiago."

     Oh well.  You've tracked Carmen around the world; through Europe, 
America, and the reaches of Time.  Surely the afterlife won't be much 
harder!

     In WHERE IN HELL IS CARMEN SANTIAGO?, you will need to use your 
detective skills and knowledge of facts from Canticle One of Dante's 
Commedia:  "Inferno".  Her gang members are here, too, and they bear the 
punishment that they earned in their lives.  Besides that, they bear 
information on their fellows, as well as useful items to help you in your 
quest.

     By talking to them and interpreting their dossiers, you'll figure out 
where the others are and what items they most desire.  Beware!  You have 
only a limited amount of time to find Carmen--and if you try to find her in 
the wrong area, you'll be damned for eternity!

     ...A copy of Inferno is necessary to get anywhere in the game.  I 
recommend the John Ciardi translation of 1954 as being particularly 
accessible; it's fun to read and it explains a lot about the meaning behind 
the verse.

     However, it should be remembered that all you're "learning" in this 
game (if anything!) is the names and circumstances of the Infernal regions.  
The reasoning behind the structure of Hell is there for the reading, if 
only you put a little effort into it.  Dante's poem is a classic, and one 
that everyone should read and then discuss with others.  This way, you'll 
find out neat things that others saw but that you missed.  If you're in 
high school, why not ask your English teacher if you can devote some class 
time to reading and discussing the book?  Your classmates will thank you.

MINI_BYTE BY JAMES [3 1/2 Lamps]   The programmer of WHERE IN HELL IS 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   CARMEN SANTIAGO? seems to have a rather 
puckish sense of humor.  The game begins with the familiar theme song and 
displays "Where in heck is Carmen Santiago" on the hi-res screen.  A moment 
later "heck" bursts into flames and burns away, leaving "HELL" in its 
place.  Then, the TM (trademark) symbols begin appearing.  The first 
appears beside "Carmen Santiago" and the other two appear beside the 
programmer's name (St. John M. Morrison) and beside the word "HELL".  It is 
easy to see that this game evolved from a gag.  This is not an insult--it 
is high praise.  There is an irreverent quality that makes the game fun but 
does not detract from the "Inferno".

     A copy of the Inferno should probably accompany the game.  Some of 
the references are too obscure, even for an English major.  The only 
problem is that the translation recommended may be a little too helpful.  
(The read.me file that makes this recommendation, while quoted above, is 
NOT included in the GEnie archives.)  Whereas it was hard to get through 
without the book, it was almost too simple when using the book.  Perhaps 
the best way to play the game is to read the Inferno and then play the 
game.

     I was a little disappointed with the interface.  I don't care much 
for adventures with mixed text and graphics.  When I saw WHERE IN HELL...?, 
I realized that I was going to have to look hard at this game and not 
immediately pan it.  When I examined the actual Carmen Sandiego games, I 
realized the game's interface faithfully parodies them.  The interface 
works well enough, but it also restricts the player's options.  If you 
enjoy Eamon and Infocom adventures, be aware that this is a different type 
of game.

     In the programmer's defense, modeling a game on a piece of classic 
literature may not leave many options open to the player.  One does need to 
follow the basic progression of storyline in Dante's Inferno:  ONE MUST GO 
DOWN.  Morrison cleverly presents the player options while creatively using 
elements from the Inferno.  In some places he plays on descriptions that 
were given in the Inferno but did not play a large role in the book.  (I 
was amused by the gall stone.)

     Play is also restricted by the number of moves--if you haven't won in 
140 moves, you expire and must start again.  (This restriction is also 
typical of the Carmen Sandiego games.)

     The only problem that really bothers me is that the goal is find 
Carmen, yet you must be absolutely sure where Carmen is before you call her 
name.  If you call her name on the wrong level, you'll see "I said Carmen, 
not Charon!" and you become a permanent resident of the Inferno.  The 
message is amusing the first couple of times but gets downright frustrating 
when all that is left to do is find Carmen.  The punishment just seems out 
of context--not for hell, but for the game play generally.

     The graphics are not great--they someimtes look pretty bad until you 
relax your eyes.  The problem with the graphics is that they are complex 
scans that have been ported from a Mac.  The scans are not suited to the 
IIe and IIc hires screens.  However, I am not sure I can imagine the 
Inferno illustrated with cartoon characters (well I can, more on that 
later).  What I do like about the graphics is that they are scans of famous 
prints and illustrations from "The Inferno".  Morrison obviously went to 
some work to include these pictures.

     There are musical scores to accompany the many screens.  At first I 
was impressed with how well the music was used.  It is not as good as the 
music that accompanies "Star Trek:  First Contact" but there is a nice 
variety.  I was bothered that any key press interrupts the music.  Merely 
move among the selections and the music jolts on and off.  Fortunately, an 
option was included to turn the music off.  I think I lasted ten minutes 
before exercising this option.

     WHERE IN HELL...? is an amusing game.  It probably should not be used 
to teach Dante's work, but it might be used to pique interest in the work.  
According to the read.me file, this is the programmer's intention.  He 
suggests to high school students that they should ask their teacher if they 
can read it and that, should a student do so, his/her classmates will thank 
him for it.  Somehow I think he might be a little optimistic here.

     I enjoyed the game despite some restrictions placed on game play and 
I think it well worth the download.  If nothing else, it will at least get 
you to read the Inferno again.

     This game was originally released in 1990 as shareware.  Upon payment 
of the fees you would receive at least one more scenario, possibly three.  
The one that was definitely ready to be sent was "Pit of the Program" 
(various characters from educational software are found in the Inferno).  
The two that were listed as future "Hellpaks" were called "Deathstyles of 
the Rich and Famous" (based on a show with a similar name) and "Life in 
Hell" (based on Matt Groening's pre-Simpsons comic strip).  The only 
question that remains is "Where in Hell are the other Hellpaks?"


MINI BYTE BY ED [3 Lamps]   When I first booted WHERE IN HELL IS CARMEN
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   SANTIAGO?, I was mindful of the fact that the 
game was written in BASIC by a teacher as a study aid for students studying 
Dante's "Inferno".  I was not expecting much.  The initial text screen, 
with its choices of "Start Game" and "Exit to BASIC", seemed to confirm my 
hunch.  Then I selected "Start Game".

     "Whoa! That's slick!" was my reaction as the opening hi-res screen 
went through its animation, complete with music.  As I recognized the tune, 
I realized that WIHICS had slowed my accelerated IIgs to 1MHz-- 
automatically.  Hmm.  Up went the expectations.  The author, St. John M. 
Morrison, clearly knows his BASIC.

     As I started to play the game, though, I was disappointed in the 
graphics.  They were practically unrecognizable.  On the other hand, the 
game is filled with clever touches.  For example, when quitting the game, 
you are given three choices, not two:  yes, no, and maybe.  Those who are 
indecisive are doomed to chase a white banner forever.

     The game play itself was straight-forward and similar to the 
commercial games which inspired WIHICS.  This is not an easy game to win if 
one has not read the Inferno.  (Of course, encouraging students to read it 
was the whole point of the game.)  I confess that I've not read the 
Inferno; nonetheless, I got caught up in the game.  I was making good 
progress--if descending into Hell can be called progress--when I 
encountered an obstacle I haven't been able to overcome yet.  The program 
hangs when you have to insert the second disk.  This is no way for Carmen 
to foil someone!

     Obviously, a fix is needed for this problem.  When it is available, 
I'll go back to this game.  It is worth finishing.

                                                              --Ed Lundberg

     [EDITOR'S NOTE:  This problem does not arise if you unpack both parts 
of the archive to the same prefix... on a 3.5" disk, a hard drive, or a RAM 
disk 256K or larger.]


MINI BYTE BY DOUG [2 1/2 Lamps]   You can play--and win--this game even if
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   you don't know Dante's "Inferno" from the 
Towering Inferno.  The Divine Comedy is a closed book to me, and even I 
eventually found Salvation.  What you cannot do is play this game and 
remain ignorant about the Inferno--it teaches you a little and piques your 
interest.

     Each turn, you can do one of four things:  move up or down, search 
for items, use an item, or call a name.  If you don't know Dante, you might 
have to use trial and error to figure out when to call the name of a ghost 
("shade").  Since there are 36 possible locations, this is boring.  
Fortunately, the shades are listed in the order you must call them, Carmen 
excepted.  If you read the character dossiers at the start of the game, you 
can usually make an educated guess about their location.

     Figuring out when to use an item is easier, especially if you know a 
little ancient mythology.  The program prompts you in verse when you get to 
a puzzle that requires an item.  I quite liked these rhymes, though it took 
me several games to notice the rhyme scheme.  Finding items is a nightmare 
equal to calling a name, since there are 36 places to look and very few 
items, which means wasted turns.  The shades can also provide items.

     As I moved into the depths of hell, I was often entertained by the 
descriptions of the levels, even if they didn't advance the game.  The 
tunes that play as you descend are initially impressive, but eventually 
annoying.  The graphics undoubtedly mean more to someone who has already 
seen the engravings in question.  Too much of the time, I didn't know what 
the program was trying to show me, even after reading the description.

     The most frustrating part of the game is that you can get one level 
away from the finish and not know what to do next.  You have to find 
Carmen--just knowing that makes the game easier!  Not much, though--you 
still have to backtrack to find her.

     The programming of this game is impressive--it's fast and it's 
faithful to the interface it's based on.  The game itself is not 
outstanding, but still worth a look when you want ten minute's diversion.

by Charlie Hartley
      [A2.CHARLIE]



     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month we will take a look at 
some PostScript fonts available in the Apple II Library.

     Margot Taylor [M.TAYLOR66] began uploading PostScript fonts to the 
Apple II RoundTable Library in May 1995, and since then she has contributed 
an impression collection of freeware and shareware fonts.  She also has 
uploaded quite a few TrueType fonts. This Treasure Hunt column is dedicated 
to her PostScript (Type-1) font uploads.

     In preparation for this column, I asked Margot to share a bit of 
information about herself, and about the fonts that she has uploaded.  She 
had this to say:

     "Well Charlie, for years my interest in fonts was pretty much limited 
to those contained on the PrintShop 'Holiday Edition' graphics disk.

     "Down the road a bit (1989?) I was asked to organize a IIgs library 
for our local User Group.  Our leader said she 'had never met a font she 
didn't like'.  This no doubt was a warning but it went right by me.  
(Privately I thought fonts were pretty boring ;-)  The donated disks 
arrived one shoebox full at a time.  What had I gotten into anyway?

     "Testing all of those bit-mapped fonts was the most tedious chore of 
all.  Eventually I built a catalog in HyperStudio format.  That was a 
perfect medium for providing samples of our ever-growing font collection.

     "Then along came Pointless which opened up the TrueType world to IIgs 
users.  I began to recognize some of the fonts and even became interested 
in our junk mail.  Some of it was pretty interesting (looking).  I read 
everything on typography that I could get my hands on.  That's where I 
discovered the wonderful collection of shareware fonts offered by David 
Rakowski--and his email address was GEnie!

     "So I joined GEnie to grab a few for the library.  In three months 
time however, I had instead acquired a LaserJet PostScript printer.  But 
where were the Type-1 fonts I needed?  There are lots of Type-1 fonts in 
the Mac RT, but most are not packed in a format that IIgs users can deal 
with.  Some are very old and it is not clear whether they are Type-1, 
Type-3, or what.  I decided to nibble at them and see what I could do.

     "Our local Copymat rents time on two little grubby antique Macs.  The 
resident 'designer' is friendly and helps me out when I get stuck.  She's 
also interested in fonts ;-)

     "Unlike the TrueTypes, (most of which have 'lost' their ReadMe files 
in my neck of the woods), the Mac Type-1's all have interesting information 
attached by the author.  Sometimes a font's ancestry or unusual name is 
explained.  David Rakowski is particularly adept at writing humorous (or 
downright outrageous) requests for shareware fees based on such things as 
your telephone prefix, shoe size, or zip code (never expensive though).  He 
asks that all fees be donated to the music department at Columbia 
University. 

     "It is rumored that he does the fonts only as a hobby.  It is 
unfortunate he no longer contributes to the world of typography, nor even 
has a GEnie account (my star-struck letter was returned).  This is said to 
be due to the lack of shareware response from the Mac and PC communities, 
in spite of thousands of downloads.  Perhaps we can rectify this?

     "You probably all know him as 'Davy' of DavysDingbats, Ribbons, 
KeyCaps, etc. from the bit-mapped days.  He is also the author of the 
fabulous (in my humble opinion) 'GriffinDingbats' which contains the famous 
upper case Drop Caps.

     "What do I personally use all this wonderful stuff for?  Just 
ordinary household things:  personal correspondence, envelopes which cry to 
be opened, greeting cards, place cards, post cards, Rolodex cards, 
calendars, book plates, personal 'business' cards, small sheets of gift 
wrap, labels of all kinds (disk, binder, video, audio, file folders, 
storage drawers, key chain tags, wallet IDs, programmed telephone numbers, 
mailing stickers such as Fragile, This Side Up, Do Not Bend--you name it), 
even recipes when I'm (rarely) asked to share one! 

     "Avery's new line of WorkSaver divider sheets is a rewarding project 
also when revamping that outdated collection of shareware doc.  Command 
reference cards for infrequently run software (like my tax program), and an 
occasional inspirational sign or two.  Haven't tried bumper stickers yet 
<g>  I would be bored to death doing all these chores with the LASERJET's 
built in fonts.

     "Since I failed penmanship in the fifth grade, and only my bank and 
the IRS can decipher my signature, I like the fonts which resemble casual 
(but not messy) hand printing for personal correspondence.  I guess I use 
Architect, Arctic2, and Lumparsky the most frequently.  A nice legible 
(still casual) script font is LibbyScript2, or Dragonwick for lots of flair 
(but short messages only).

     "Formal script material such as invitations and the like, looks nice 
with Aspire, Author, Civitype or RechtmanScript, just to name a few.  For 
bookplates or the engraved-in-marble look try ElizabethAnn, Kelmscott 
(Chaucer), Nauert, or UechiGothic.  There are many other wonderful 
'classic' typefaces in this collection--too numerous to mention.

     "The greeting cards I devise (or plagiarize) tend not to be the 
hearts/flowers kind so I prefer the casual or cartoon styles of lettering.  
Some of these are Greeting, BowLegs, Dupuy (based on 'Peanuts'), 
GadzooksBold, MarkerFeltThin, Marydale, Notepad and Toonscript.

     "In the special effects department are LowerEastSide (bent wood 
feeling), Mira, EraserDust and AtticAntique (distressed), DownWind (smoke), 
InkaBod (Nordic), Inkwell (weighted), Lintsec (stencil), UpperEastSide 
(modern), UpperWestSide (N.Y. mag).

     "The old west is represented with a couple of 'Wanted Dead or Alive' 
display faces:  CartWright and BlackHawk.

     "Last but not least, I am occasionally interested in readable body 
text with a slightly distinctive air--something not your run of the mill 
resident font.  So far I have discovered:  Albatross, Dubiel, LilithLight, 
CarawayBold, CapelYFfin (a town in Wales), Cheneau, EdenLight and Octavian.

     "Gadzooks, Charlie, you've forced me to categorize my library fonts-- 
something I've been 'meaning to' for a long time.  Whew.  And this still 
leaves three subjects entirely untouched:  (1) the matter of PublishIt! 
(graphic image) fonts, (2) the "dropped/raised" all caps section, and (3) 
the magic that Ryan Suenaga has discovered with regard to creating "pseudo" 
Type-1 fonts from the TrueType version on his Mac.  I have two examples of 
the latter and they work great but he does not feel they are suitable for 
uploading.  Maybe we can persuade him ;-)  (Sorry, Ryan, but you do deserve 
credit and encouragement. :-)"

     Next, I asked Margot to tell us what programs she uses to print to 
her LaserJet printer.

     She responded, "I print from very few programs on my IIgs.  My 
personal preference depends on the task at hand.  For documents which 
require a high degree of precision to position or size (such as labels, 
greeting cards, and pica scales to three places) I use PublishIt! 4.  One 
could also use AppleWorks GS or GraphicWriter III (with a lesser degree of 
precision).  PublishIt! also permits one to choose the LaserWriter driver 
directly from it's options menu, thus eliminating the OA-P/f action 
required by other applications in order to print in PostScript.

     "Everyday things such as sample sheets for my font catalog, e-mail, 
documentation and the like, I do directly from ShadowWrite/Hermes.  It's 
almost a necessity to have a bit-mapped or TrueType screen font in play 
here to perform the line and letter spacing, however.

     "The 8-bit programs I print from are AppleWorks 3.0 and TaxPreparer 
[(c) HowardSoft].  These both ignore the installed printer driver and thus 
cannot create PostScript jobs.  (They require that the printer be set to 
PCL mode, but they DO print at 600 dpi.)

     "Speaking of drivers, I use Apple's LaserWriter Driver that comes 
with System 6.0.1.  The trick there is to rename it to something else, 
e.g., LW.PostScript, so that it can be selected from the DC Printer CDev.  
It's then a simple matter to press OA-P/f while clicking on the OK button 
in the print dialog window.  This instantly places the outgoing print file 
in the */System/Drivers folder in PostScript format.  That file (and any of 
our fancy fonts that it needs) can be sent to the printer at any time via 
the LaserBEAM utility by Joe Wankerl (THANK YOU JOE!).  Version 1.1 is 
available from GS+ Magazine, March 1994 issue.  LaserBEAM sends print files 
to the LASERJET in a flash and releases the GS immediately to do other 
chores. Fonts are sent more slowly ;-) but remain in the printer until it 
is reset or turned off.

     "This intermediate step can be a blessing if one wants to tweak the 
final result or archive it for future use.  It presents the opportunity to 
intervene:  to change fonts, lighten/darken the image, reposition an 
element, etc."

     Margot is a frequent visitor to the Apple II bulletin board, 
particularly in the topics that talk about printers and fonts.  While she 
doesn't want to be called an expert, she certainly has opened some doors 
for those who want to use their Apple II's with PostScript printers.

     The PostScript fonts that Margot has uploaded to the Apple II Library 
are descibed below.  Since the process of clearing these fonts is a bit 
more complicated than for most files (it takes someone with the right 
equipment and the right programs), some of the fonts that Margot named 
above may not be yet found in these descriptions.

                File #26439: UPPERWES.T1.BXY (88060 bytes)
                ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
     UpperWestSide is a typeface taken from the logo and headlines of the 
New Yorker magazine.  Character set contains upper case, small caps, 
numerals and punctuation.  In addition there are icons for movie ratings as 
used by the San Francisco Examiner, and small pictures of the author and 
his wife.  Released as shareware, $6.41, by David Rakowski.  This version 
is Type-1 for use with PostScript printers.  The uploader has used 
OldEnglish.TT for screen spacing.

                File #26438: TOONZSCR.T1.BXY (28664 bytes)
                ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
     ToonzScript was designed to imitate a cartoonist's hand lettered 
dialog.  The all-caps character set contains several variations of each 
letter so that a truly hand printed effect is possible.  You will have a 
lot of fun with this as an alternative to other rigid typefaces.  Numerals 
and punctuation are included as well.  This font is released by Stewart 
Daniels who states that for a fee a more complete version may be had.  This 
version is Type-1 for use with PostScript printers.  The uploader has not

Top 10 Files for December
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     This month, a new feature that lists the ten most popular files for 
the month.  To give these files a chance to seek their own levels, no files 
will be added to the list until they've been in place at least a month.  
This month, we look at the files uploaded 1-31 December 1995.

     This isn't the Academy Awards ceremony, folks; it's more like the 
People's Choice Awards (both of which are trademarked, by the way).  The 
Top 10 doesn't necessarily tell you what's new and interesting--what files 
_you_ might find interesting--it just tells you what files have been 
downloaded a lot--what other people found interesting!

PATCHHFS.BXY   The top download for December was Jawaid Bazyar's patch for 
""""""""""""   the HFS File System Translator.  This FST, which allows you 
to read and write Macintosh disks and volumes, had a bug in it that 
occasionally ruined HFS volumes.  Dave Lyons unearthed the bug and Jawaid 
Bazyar programmed the fix.

A2.DOM.9512.BXY   The A2 RoundTable Disk of the Month continues to be a

PMPFAX.INFO.TXT   People were so eager to learn about Paul Parkhurst's 
"""""""""""""""   long-awaited fascsimile send and receive program, PMPFax, 
that they downloaded this information file to learn about the features and 
the trade-in offer.  This is an incredible showing for a press release!

JUICED.GS.BXY   Max Jones hasn't been on GEnie long, but when he uploaded 
"""""""""""""   this 15-page prototype of his newsletter _Juiced.GS_, 
people ran to download it.  This is an AppleWorks GS desktop publishing 
file.  You can examine it or print off your own copy (if you own AppleWorks 
GS).

PRINT3200.BXY   Until John Wrenholt programmed this freeware beauty, there 
"""""""""""""   wasn't any way to print a 3200-color graphic.  Now there 
is!  The download count should actually be higher, since a small bug was 
quickly found in v1.0.  The bug has been fixed in this, v1.0.1.

SYMBOLIX.BXY   Symbolix v1.9 by Bright Software's Henrik Gudat is a

         ~ The _mot juiced_:  Max Jones, publisher of _Juiced.GS ~


     Just before 1995 end, Max Jones uploaded a prototype of a new 
publication, Juiced.GS.  This prototype was an AppleWorks GS desktop 
publishing document.  (It's file #26290 in the A2 libraries on GEnie.)  
Anyone can download and print out this prototype.

     ...Well, anyone with AppleWorks GS, anyway.  I don't own AppleWorks 
GS, so I got Max Jones to mail me a copy of the prototype.  I am impressed.  
The first thing that impresses me is that Jones goes and finds fresh 
stories and fresh information.  (Had you heard how few copies of Quick 
Click Calc, Quick Click Morph, and Contacts GS have been sold?  Juiced.GS 
will tell you!)  The second thing that impresses me is the layout.  The 
look is semi-professional--somewhere between the most recent issues of 
_IIAlive_ and those of _Shareware Solutions II_.

     Neither of those two magazines was the inspiration for Juiced.GS, 
though.  Jones has said that the "death" of GS+ Magazine inspired him to 
start Juiced.GS.  This month, we talk to Max Jones about his plans for this 
new publication.

                                 [*][*][*]


GEnieLamp>   Do you see yourself as a successor to GS+ Magazine?  Will you
"""""""""    focus on programming, as GS+ did?  Or is the similarity simply 
that the focus will be the IIgs?

Jones>   The demise of GS+ created an enormous void that I doubt will ever
"""""    be filled.  What Steve Disbrow did for all those years, with the 
help of some very talented people, is remarkable.  GS+ was truly a creative 
enterprise, and I will always admire and respect what they accomplished.

     Juiced.GS will make no attempt to emulate GS+.  But I do think the 
IIgs deserves its own specific publication, and I'm going to make my best 
effort to fill that niche.

     I'm not a programmer--although I'd love to try it sometime!--so 
Juiced.GS won't lean toward technical content.  On the other hand, I have 
put out feelers for technical writers in hopes that I can eventually offer 
a column in each issue on a technical topic.  Personally, I liked the 
technical stuff in GS+, although I didn't always understand it. :)  There's 
nothing wrong with challenging a reader with complex concepts and detail, 
as long as the writing is clear and logical.


GEnieLamp>   Where did the name _Juiced.GS_ come from?
"""""""""
Jones>   My system administrator at work is a former Apple II technician,
"""""    so he gets a real kick out of my allegiance to the IIgs.  After I 
started powering up my system about three years ago with more RAM and a 
hard drive, I proudly announced to him one day that I now had a juiced GS.  
Ever since, he's referred to me among his techie friends as the guy with 
the juiced GS.

     When it came time for me to name the newsletter, Juiced.GS was a 
natural.  Its core (pun intended) audience would be power users, and the 
name blended well with the Apple theme.  It helped that the name had a 
personal history as well.


GEnieLamp>   Will you be producing a magazine or a newsletter?
"""""""""
Jones>   I think a magazine format, with the current Apple II market, just
"""""    isn't feasible.  I'll take the newsletter approach, but plan to 
introduce some magazine-style techniques in the content and design.  I 
won't shy away from in-depth articles, and I hope to complement 
informative, interesting and entertaining content with a compelling layout.


GEnieLamp>   Will you be accepting advertising?
"""""""""
Jones>   I haven't ruled it out.  Right now, though, I'm focusing my
"""""    energies on building a subscriber base by producing a quality 
publication.  I'd love to have the opportunity someday soon to convince a 
product vendor or developer that advertising in Juiced.GS would make them 
money.  If that happens, I wouldn't hesitate to increase the number of 
pages in each issue.  But I'm taking it one step at a time.


GEnieLamp>   How often will you publish?
"""""""""
Jones>   In 1996, I'll produce quarterly -- winter, spring, summer and
"""""    fall.  The first issue will be published in February.  I knew 
there was enough material and interest to publish more often, but I didn't 
want to get in too deep and not be able to deliver what I promised when I 
promised it.  By publishing quarterly, I'll have the time to plan, be 
creative and pay special attention to quality.  And I'll also be able to 
meet my deadline, which I think is *very* important.


GEnieLamp>   How much will a subscription be?
"""""""""
Jones>   A charter subscription is $12 in the U.S. and Canada ($18
"""""    elsewhere).  That will get a subscriber the four 1996 issues.


GEnieLamp>   Do you think the Apple II world is still large enough to
"""""""""    support competing magazines and newsletters?

Jones>   My instincts tell me that there is still room for high-quality
"""""    Apple II publications.  How many can the Apple II world support?  
I just don't know.  I guess we'll be finding out real soon.


GEnieLamp>   Are computers a part of your daytime job?  Please tell us a 
"""""""""    little about what you do between 9 and 5.

Jones>   Actually, computers have been part of my life since I stepped into
"""""    my first newspaper job in 1975.  Back then, we had punch-tape 
computerized typesetters producing our page copy.  That's back when cold 
type had just begun to replace the hot type of the linotype machines.  I 
worked for a very forward-thinking publisher, and I'll never forget that 
day in the late '70s when he brought a Compugraphic salesman in to 
demonstrate a word-processing computer.  We were mesmerized.  We purchased 
the computers, and they changed our lives.

     Today, I'm the editorial page editor at the Tribune-Star, a 
42,000-circulation daily newspaper in Terre Haute, Ind.  I've held that 
position for a little over six years.  I write daily editorials and produce 
the opinion page that appears in our paper seven days a week.  I also write 
a weekly column called "Changing Lanes" that appears on the cover of the 
Tribune-Star's Metro section.  My column is topical, with an emphasis on 
local politics.  I also contribute when time permits to a weekly computing 
page in our newspaper, writing primarily about the local telecommunications 
scene.  I'm also part of team that's working to get our newspaper onto the 
World Wide Web.


GEnieLamp>   It's obvious that you're well qualified to publish a
"""""""""    newsletter!  What qualifies you to publish an *Apple II* 
newsletter?

Jones>   For more than six years, I've been the proud owner of a IIgs. 
"""""    About three years ago, I made the decision to upgrade my Apple II 
hardware and software rather than change platforms.  Since then, I've spent 
more and more time reading about the IIgs and experimenting with its 
features.  I think I've developed a pretty good working knowledge of the 
computer.  Although I'm far from being an expert, I do have an intense 
interest and enthusiasm for the IIgs.  While I can't contribute to the 
Apple II community with any software or hardware expertise, I *can* 
contribute by drawing on my journalistic experience and skills.  Creating a 
IIgs-specific newsletter is the best way for me to help carry the load of 
keeping the Apple II spirit alive.


GEnieLamp>   Would you tell us how you first became interested in the
"""""""""    Apple II?  Was it your first home computer?

Jones>   My son was in elementary school in 1989 and we wanted him and his
"""""    little sister to grow up with a computer in the house.  (Of 
course, I *really* wanted one, too!)  Although I had worked a lot on Macs, 
Apple wasn't producing a color version yet at a price we could afford.  We 
wanted a color monitor, and a school teacher recommended we try out a IIgs 
in her classroom.  We did, and we were hooked.  We bought one a short time 
later from an Apple dealer.  We've never regretted it.


GEnieLamp>   You've said that the emphasis of Juiced.GS will be on
"""""""""    productivity.  Would you explain that?

Jones>   Personal computers aren't toys, although they're so much fun to
"""""    use that it seems like it sometimes.  A lot of people depend on 
them to produce very useful things.  The IIgs may be old, relatively 
speaking, but it can still be an extremely productive computer.  In fact, 
it is amazing just what folks can do with this supposedly obsolete machine.  
I want the content of Juiced.GS to emphasize the computer's usefulness and 
focus attention on the people and products that keep the IIgs a viable 
platform.  That means traditional feature articles and reviews of software 
and hardware.  But it also means allowing users to tell the rest of the 
IIgs community how they use their computers to accomplish tasks that make 
their lives easier, better and more fun.


GEnieLamp>   What hardware and software are you using to produce the
"""""""""    newsletter?

Jones>   I have a Rom 3 IIgs with 5.25 meg of RAM, a 42-meg hard drive (way
"""""    too small), ZIP 8/16 accelerator, a CD-ROM drive, 2400-baud modem 
(Spectrum 2.0 telecom software) and a System Saver IIgs.

     My printer is an ImageWriter II, but I've arranged to have my page 
proofs created on an HP DeskWriter 550C.

     I usually write in Hermes (ShadowWrite) 1.3.4, but also use WordWorks 
Pro (from Softdisk GS) in some circumstances.  I'll be using AppleWorks GS 
v1.1 for page layout, at least until the new version of GraphicWriter III 
comes out.  I also use SuperConvert and Platinum Paint to create art and 
graphics.


GEnieLamp>   Is Juiced.GS going to be a one-man operation?
"""""""""
Jones>   Just me, I'm afraid.  But I will be getting some great help from
"""""    my friend Greg Nelson, a IIgs user from Lincoln, Nebraska.  He's 
printing my master pages and has been a valuable consultant to me during 
the newsletter's development process.  I may also get assistance from 
others occasionally if there are special needs that I can't handle with my 
set-up.


GEnieLamp>   Will you be accepting/soliciting submissions from other
"""""""""    writers and programmers?

Jones>   Absolutely.  I've already started.  In fact, in Volume 1, Issue 1
"""""    there will be at least one piece, maybe two, from contributors 
whose names will be very familiar to the folks in GEnie's A2 RoundTable.  
And anyone who contributes will be paid for their work.  It may not be 
much, but it will be something.  I figure as long as I'm accepting 
subscription money for this newsletter, anyone who makes an effort to 
contribute deserves something in return.


GEnieLamp>   You've mentioned that non-subscribers can get single issues
"""""""""    from you, but that only subscribers will be eligible for gift 
certificate draws.  Tell us more about this.

Jones>   Naturally, I want to encourage full subscriptions.  To do so, I
"""""    set the subscription price-per-issue ($3) lower than the single 
copy price ($4).

     To further show my appreciation to those who put their faith, trust 
and support behind me in the early stages of this project, I decided to 
have a drawing for a gift certificate before publication of each issue.  
It's my way of saying thanks to charter subscribers while immediately 
giving something back to the A2 marketplace.  The first gift certificate 
will be for $15 to the A2 vendor of the winner's choice.  As the subscriber 
base grows, so will the price of the gift certificate.


GEnieLamp>   Your press release says that "readers will also learn how to
"""""""""    get access to a disk loaded with shareware and freeware". 
What's the idea here?

Jones>   The losses of GS+ and A2-Central last year took more away from the
"""""    Apple II community than just information.  There were disks 
involved, too, that provided software and other useful files.  With GS+, it 
was original, copyrighted software.  But with A2-Central, it was 
shareware/freeware etc.  Someone made the observation during a discussion 
in CompuServe's Apple II Users Forum last fall that they were surprised no 
one had attempted to tap into the disk distribution void left by ICON.  
This person--I believe it was Beverly Cadieux of Texas II--thought there 
was still a market for distributing disks containing the latest 
shareware/freeware releases.

     Well, that got me thinking.  I download almost everything that goes 
up on Cal Tech's Apple II archive and into the CompuServe library.  And I'm 
just now beginning to tap into the massive GEnie A2 library.  I decided I'd 
supplement Juiced.GS by offering an on-disk collection of 
shareware/freeware from the previous quarter.  The first offering, however, 
will be a two-disk set called "The Juiced.GS Collection: Shareware '95".  
The disks will be packed with programs and files from last year.  The vast 
majority of Juiced.GS Collection material will not have been included on 
the Golden Orchard CD-ROM or on any of GEnie's A2 DoMs.  The files will be 
compressed with GS Shrinkit to maximize space on disk.

     I'm still finalizing pricing details, but the purchase price will be 
minimal.  It will be no more than $8 for the two-disk set, probably less.  
And single disks later on will be no more than $5, probably less.  I'll 
announce details in the first issue of Juiced.GS, and more information in 
subsequent issues.  I'll also publish an index of what material will be on 
each disk.


GEnieLamp>   What do you consider your most proud accomplishment?
"""""""""
Jones>   Whew!  Let's see.  I hit a curve ball one time... directed a
"""""    muscial comedy and played a couple of lead roles for our community 
theater... was editor of a small newspaper that won a number of statewide 
journalism awards...

     But most proud accomplishment?  I guess I'm most proud of my kids, 
but they may be turning out very well in spite of me rather than because of 
me.  :)

     I'm proud of my 20-year journalism career, during which time I've 
often been called upon to be a problem-solver and trailblazer when new 
endeavors are planned.  I love new challenges and new adventures, and it's 
nice to have others call on you for help, input and creative leadership 
when new and innovative projects are in the works.


GEnieLamp>   Who do you look up to as your mentors?
"""""""""
Jones>   This may seem hokey, but I'd have to say my primary mentor has
"""""    always been my dad.  He worked two jobs when I was growing up.  
One as a printer at a nearby U.S. Navy base (yes, there's a naval weapons 
facility in southern Indiana), and he also had a print shop of his own in 
our basement at home.  He's a quiet guy and taught us mostly by example, 
but I learned an enormous amount from him about using technology to be 
creative and accomplish things in an efficient and effective manner.  He's 
retired now, but still has a printing press in his basement and keeps very 
busy with it.  Much of his typesetting is now done on a Macintosh computer.

     I'd also say my first publisher had a profound effect on me.  He was 
a forceful and dynamic individual.  Not only did he give me the opportunity 
to develop as a journalist by tolerating my youthful arrogance and 
immaturity, he motivated me to improve and excel far beyond what I thought 
were my limits.  He died suddenly of a heart attack (at age 52, no less!) 
while I was still working for him.  I never got the opportunity to thank 
him for all he did for me, but he would have probably just scoffed and 
waved me away.  My association with him was a key building block in my 
career.  Most importantly, he helped me develop the attitude that if 
something's worth doing, it should be done right and performed with a high 
degree of spirit and enthusiasm.  I now share his philosophy:  "Life is 
short.  Play hard."


GEnieLamp>   Where do you see the future of telecommunications moving in
"""""""""    the next five to ten years?

Jones>   To tell you the truth, I'm not sure I can see as far ahead as the
"""""    next five to ten months.  The pace of change is mind-boggling.  I 
read a quote not long ago from a guy assessing the current 
telecommunications revolution.  I don't have the quote in front of me, but 
the thrust of his point was that not long ago he thought the Internet was 
clearly the most important information/technology development since the 
invention of the printing press.  But today he's modified that assessment.  
He now believes the Internet is the most important technological 
development since the discovery of fire.  An exaggeration?  Perhaps, but he 
makes a good point.


GEnieLamp>   What sorts of things do you like to do for fun (i.e.
"""""""""    non-computer hobbies)?

Jones>   I'm an avid reader, a pretty serious baseball fan, and I like
"""""    swimming and boating (but not in February in the Midwest!).  I 
also play the guitar and am involved in a lot of my kids' activities.  
There are tons of things I'd like to do, such as community theater or 
playing in a summer softball league, but I just don't have time.  Maybe 
someday.  I just wish the days were longer.


GEnieLamp>   How did you get involved in telecommunications?
"""""""""
Jones>   My first experience with telecommunications was in the early '80s
"""""    when I began occasionally sending stories to our newspaper's 
mainframe from a Radio Shack Model 100 portable computer.  The portable I 
used only had 8K of memory :) but we all thought it was pretty cool!

     More recently, I was the first non-computer department employee at 
our newspaper to be given access to on-line services and the Internet at 
work.  They were looking for someone to act as a sort of liaison between 
the computer tech people and the dozens of computer/telecommunications 
novices in our newsroom.  I kind of assumed that function.  It's kept me 
pretty busy, but it's been fun.  And *very* instructive.  I've learned a 
lot, and am learning more all the time.  A lot of reporters and editors are 
now using the Internet and other services to help them do their jobs.


GEnieLamp>   I was glad to note coverage from CompuServe in your prototype
"""""""""    issue.  GEnie is definitely the service to use if you're only 
using one, but I like to hear from "outside the family" occasionally, and I 
don't think I'm the only one.  Yet I note your preferred E-mail address is 
your GEnie account.  Do you intend to maintain a presence on other 
services?

Jones>   My GEnie address is preferred because that's my personal e-mail
"""""    address.  I use my CompuServe address mostly for my newspaper 
work, but I do monitor the Apple II Forums and occasionally participate.  
The CompuServe Apple II forums have some great people--Joe Walters, Jim 
Nichol, Shawn Goodin, Joe Kohn, etc.--but there are far fewer members than 
on GEnie.  I also monitor the comp.sys.apple2 Usenet group daily.  I will 
continue to maintain a presence in all three locations and stay in touch 
with the active participants in each spot.


GEnieLamp>   How long have you been a member of GEnie?  What new services
"""""""""    do you think GEnie should provide its subscribers?

Jones>   I finally signed on to GEnie on December 1, 1995.  I wanted to be
"""""    here a long time ago, but I live in a rural community south of 
Terre Haute with no local GEnie access.  I put off spending the money to be 
GEnie member until I had purchased some other things I needed, such as an 
accelerator, modem, telecommunications software, etc.  But I have read 
GEnieLamp A2 for a long time and received the A2 Disk of the Month through 
Shareware Solutions II.

     I'm still learning about all GEnie has to offer, so I'd better 
reserve any suggestions for when I have a better knowledge of the vast 
services available.


GEnieLamp>   What one piece of advice would you pass along to a new
"""""""""    Apple II telecommunications enthusiast?

Jones>   Read the manuals! That's something I usually do when all else
"""""    fails. :)  Makes life more complicated than it needs to be 
sometimes.

     Actually, the best advice is to dive in and explore.  Doing so will 
help you get accustomed to your telecommunications software and help you 
understand what resources are available on-line.  If you get stuck, don't 
be afraid to ask questions.  Most Apple II folks on-line would be more than 
happy to assist.
