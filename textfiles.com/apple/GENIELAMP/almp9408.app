Notes From The Editor

                   >>> SLEEPWALKING TOWARD JERUSALEM <<<
                   """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Did your parents ever sigh in exasperation when you replied "I didn't 
notice" to one of their questions?  Mine did, and I didn't understand 
why... until recently.

     In my youth, the reason I failed to notice whether a pot on the stove 
boiling was generally because I passed through the kitchen with my nose in 
a book.  I later parlayed this indifference to my surroundings into a 
talent approaching genius.  When setting up house for myself, it took me 
several months to notice that two equidistant supermarkets varied as much 
as 80 cents in the price they asked for a box of Hamburger Helper.  The box 
was on the shelf, and the price was the price, so I bought it without 
paying any attention.  Paying attention pays dividends!

     When I read Leslie Halliwell's memoir _Seats in All Parts_, I 
marvelled that the author could so clearly recall the more than 20 cinemas 
in his home town.  When I'm in a cinema, I concentrate on finding a seat 
with nobody behind me -- I'm 6'3", and hate being asked to move or slide 
down -- and then give myself over completely to the film.  Half an hour 
later, you could ask me what color the wall was, or how full the cinema 
was, and I would stare at you, helplessly.  Or at least rapidly change the 
subject.

     I hadn't noticed that I don't notice.  A cinema was a place with a 
reasonably uncomfortable seat, a screen, and projector.  One supermarket 
was the same as the next.  The only thing I ever noticed about my car was 
whether or not the gas tank needed to be refilled... until the day when the 
muffler fell off in the middle of the road.

     Earlier today, I looked up, startled, as I realized that I have now 
completed one full year as editor of GEnieLamp A2.  And just two days 
before, I made my first attempt to see how many Apple II users there are on 
GEnie.

     On page 203, you will find user profiles, where you can search the 
profiles of others users, based on interest, first name, last name, GEmail 
address, company name, city, state/province, country, or just about any 
combination of the above.  (Do not under any circumstances confuse this 
option with the GEnie mail directory, which lists just about every GEnie 
subscriber.  The list of user profiles is limited to those users who have 
taken the time to make up their own listings.)

     A search on those interest in "APPLE II" found me 217 matches.  A 
search on variant spellings (APPLE //, APPLE ][, APPLE 2, and APPLE2) 
netted me another 35, making 252 in all.  A search on "APPLE" got me 562 
matches, though that presumably includes some of those interested in the 
Apple Macintosh, the Apple III, the Apple Newton, and those funny spheroid 
things you find growing in orchards.

     AND THESE ARE JUST THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE TROUBLE TO FILL IN A USER 
PROFILE!  I don't know what percentage of GEnie users do this -- I hadn't 
until two days ago -- nor do I know how many clients the A2 RoundTable has, 
but I'd be willing to bet that this is just the tip of the iceberg.

     If you want to support the Apple II community but can't afford any 
more hardware or software this month, then here's a cheap way to make your 
voice hear.  Go fill out your user profile, and mention the Apple II as 
being one of your interests.  The more GEnie users that identify themselves 
as potential customers for Apple II products, the better off we'll all be.

     What started me thinking about all this, of course, was KansasFest 
(a/k/a ICONference).  It's not solely an Apple II event, of course, but 
there were a lot of Apple II people there.  It was my first visit, and I 
hope there'll be a second!  It was really a kick to know that there are so 
many others interested in producing -- and/or consuming -- new Apple II 
wares.

     Most of the KansasFest coverage you'll find in this month's HEY 
MISTER POSTMAN column is provided by Steven Weyhrich, also a first-timer.  
I'm glad he posted such great reports on the A2 RoundTable, quoting him 
extensively makes me miss his presence around here a little less.

     We have a Weyhrich spin-off this issue, by the way.  Leon Raesly read 
Steven's POLISHING GREEN APPLES column in our June issue, and penned a 
rebuttal, reprinted from the NovApple Newsletter with the permission of the 
author and publisher.

                            >>> CORRECTION <<<
                            """"""""""""""""""

     I was pleased to see a mention of GSTape in the June GenieLamp A2, 
however I would like to comment on some things that Steve Weyhrich wrote.

     First, GSTape does not require the RamFAST SCSI card.  It will work 
with the Apple SCSI cards, both Rev C and High Speed DMA if the Apple SCSI 
manager is installed.  The driver that comes with GSTape works with both 
the Apple and RamFAST SCSI cards.

     Second, Steve's problem with the RamFAST driver not being recognized 
was not caused by renaming the partition names.  Rather, he used ProSel to 
change the names the SCSI driver responds with when asked by GS/OS. This is 
the "device name" shown in Icon Information available from the Finder. 
GSTape does not care what your partition or volume name is, however it does 
need to tell the difference between the RamFAST hard disk driver and other 
SCSI drivers.

     If you have used ProSel to change device names and have trouble 
getting the GSTape demo to recognize the RamFAST driver, you can do a 
couple of things.  You can re-run the "modify parameters" ProSel utility 
and set the device names back to their original values.  For a RamFAST this 
is normally ".CVTECH.S7.A" or something similar depending on which slot the 
card is in and which partition on the drive is being referenced. With 
GSTape, only the ".CVTECH" is required.  You can also temporarily rename 
the PROSEL.PARMS file in the system folder to something else and reboot the 
system.

     Good question. They (him?) are arriving in SF on Monday morning, and 
they (him?) plan to call me first thing to set up a time. It has to be 
Monday or Tuesday, as I'm heading out to KansasFest first thing Wednesday 
morning.

     And, surprise, surprise. I find that Opale is not the only Brutal 
Deluxe work in progress.

     I will say that I'm a little concerned about the language problem. 
I've been e-mailing with Brutal Deluxe for the past year, and their English 
skills seem to be almost non-existant. It should be interesting, to say the 
least.

SOFTDISK G-S EASTER EGGS   Just thought I'd mention, on the topic of Easter

published with at least one Easter Egg in the main Shell program (with 
perhaps some in the other programs on the issue...). I think some of them 
are pretty good, IMNSHO...

     Just trying to keep the IIGS ever more interesting... :)

SPECTRUM PASSWORDS ON A NETWORK   If Spectrum is on a network then (a) 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   don't store passwords and (b) purchase a 
site license, unless there is _no_ possibility of two people running 
Spectrum at the same time.

     Storing passwords is a convenience for users on standalone machines 
in their home; it is a good way to hide the passwords from a casual hacker.  
Storing passwords in any program on a machine that isn't in a reasonably 
secure location is a bad idea.

ULTRAMACRO 'DIRSORT' LABEL   Someone recently asked me a question in
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   email that I'll answer here for the benefit of 
all.

     Question: "#dirsort doesn't work, do you know why?"

     Short answer: Because it doesn't have the correct address.

     Long answer: #dirsort is an UltraMacros label that is supposed to 
represent the address that can be poked to force AppleWorks to display the 
file listing in the order the files are stored on disk and not the sorted 
order AW usually displays. UM is substituting the address $2295 for 
#dirsort. After poking around in the monitor a bit, I found that the $31a2 
can be poked to force AW to display the file listing in disk order when 
adding files to the desktop. The organizer must be in memory before the 
poke.

start

A:<all:

     oa-q esc            //MAIN MENU --organizer loaded
     poke $31a2, $2c :   // disk order
     rtn rtn >!          //add files from current disk

     You have a choice at this point of poking $31a2,$20 to restore the 
default or leaving it alone. As soon as you actually get in a file that 
code is overwritten. The sorted order will be displayed next time files are 
added to the desktop.

     Although displaying the files in true disk order is faster, whether 
or not there is a _noticeable_ difference depends on the number of files in 
a directory and the speed of the computer. On a system with a RAM Fast and 
an accelerator there may be no noticeable difference.

     I knew Jay left for greener pastures, but I _thought_ I heard that 
Bryan moved to the Mac version of Softdisk.  If true, he could still be 
consulted.  If he did leave, what did I miss?

David           (SOFTDISK.INC, CAT34, TOP2, MSG:321/M645;1)


FIX FOR OCCASIONAL SPECTRUM "SLOWDOWN"   Yes, it sounds like the clipboard 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   problem.  The bug isn't with 
"large" amounts of text, but if the clipboard contains text that references 
a font that no longer exists.  For example, highlight even just one word 
that's set with Times.12, copy it, then quit to the Finder.  Delete ALL 
your "Times" fonts and launch Teach.  Edit/Paste will show garbage because 
the clipboard is corrupt.

     This shows up a lot with Spectrum because it uses an internal 
"Spectrum.8" font that goes away when you quit (i.e. it does not exist in 
the Fonts folder). However, that bug apparently does not ever appear if the 
newest Pointless is installed (which makes me think the system bug is in 
the Font Manager and not necessarily in the Scrap Manager).

     Anyway, we're doing two things to hopefully _avoid_ the bug (since we 
cannot actually _fix_ it): (1) We're going to provide Spectrum.8 on disk so 
it can exist in the Fonts folder, and (2) We're not going to make the Scrap 
Manager calls so often.

     #1 should avoid the problem; #2 will lessen the effects if the 
problem does occur.

     As Ken mentioned, the solution is just to copy something else (if you 
boot to the Finder or some launcher that gives access to NDAs, open the

APPLE BRAND JOYSTICKS   I can't believe all the positive remarks about 
"""""""""""""""""""""   Apple's joysticks. Apparently you all were either 
very fortunate, or didn't use your joysticks much. The sticks themselves 
were great, and lasted forever. The buttons, however, were (I believe) 
deliberately designed to stop functioning after only a limited amount of 
use. The actually circuitry would never go out; rather, the spring between 
the outer orange button and the electronics would always get 
compressed/bent/etc., and the button wouldn't make reliable contact anymore 
(it would if you took the orange buttons out, but that made it rather hard 
to play with).

     I saw dozens of these joysticks with the exact same button problems. 
I personally knew people who bought Apple joystick after Apple joystick 
because the buttons stopped working. I listened to computer-store personnel 
who always tried to play off Apple joystick problems as "kids being hard on 
the buttons". I even had an Apple joystick myself and experienced all these 
problems, and discovered that it was just the bad design with the springs 
that would stop working.

     In short, the Apple joystick's buttons were lemons, and I am amazed 
that anyone can recommend the Apple joystick.

TIP FOR APPLETALK USERS   I just solved a problem that's been annoying for 
"""""""""""""""""""""""   for almost six months now, and thought I'd share 
it with everyone. Talk about traps for young players, AND OLD ONES!

     My IIGS has three boot partitions, which I select with a RamFAST, 
depending on what I'm doing during that session. One of these is a fast 
boot (ie. very few INITs/DAs etc.) which starts AppleTalk and logs on to my 
Macintosh automatically and uses AppleShare to gain access to one of the 
Mac's drives.

     About six months ago, the boot process started getting slower and 
slower, until it got to the stage where it was taking up to 30-40 seconds 
longer than I thought it should have. I checked the Zip GSX, and for around 
30 seconds or so, the cache light was almost hard on. Check the Zip 
settings! Nope, the AppleTalk switch made no difference. Either did 
changing any of the slot speed switches. Re-install 6.0.1? No difference. 
Remove EVERY INIT and DA (including the Apple ones, except for Control 
Panels NDA and the AppleShare related Control Panels. Same problem.

     I didn't have time to look any further, so I forgot about it.

     Recently it had been getting worse, so I decided to take another 
look. I dropped into debug during the "hard on delay" ;-) and found it 
madly polling the serial ports. Why?

     Perhaps it's confused! Delete CDev.data. Same problem. Check out 
ATInit and AppleShare.Prep. Ahh!

     Because my Mac had been reformatted a number of times, the server 
name had changed. The IIGS was trying to log on to every past server name 
which I'd used, and was "madly polling" waiting for them all to come 
online.

     Even though only the current name appears in the AppleShare Control 
Panel, setup data STILL contains the old information! I deleted "ATInit" 
and "AppleShare.Prep", went in and logged on to the Mac again, and rebooted 
with the new parms. The IIGS booted to the desktop, with the Mac volume 
mounted, in under 10 seconds!

     Sooo... If you think AppleShare is pretty slow, try deleting "ATInit" 
and "AppleShare.Prep", reboot, re-logon, and reboot again. Both of these 
files are in "*:System:System.Setup".

 - memos (cell notes)
 - dynamic @Alert (revaluates each recalc)
 - new @Today function

DB
''
 - background text in single record layout. You type in anything you want

   background. You can make cool boxes and flashy screens.
 - mixed mode in SRL pops up a scrolling list for the current category. As 
   you cursor through, the SRL stuff is updated
 - DB Pix-style graphics command display single or double hires, PrintShop

WP

 - resizable split screens which are "remembered" as you switch around the 
   desktop. In other words, you could have 10 differently sized windows and 
   use OA-Q to move from file to file, each retaining their window setup.
 - print to screen. Handy for previewing mail merge, varying CPI, etc.
 - print Odd or Even. Handy for book printing
 - built-in Outliner
 - wild cards allow search for T?M to find Tim or Tom.
 - find text is remembered even when you switch desktop files

'''''''
 - you can pick more than 12 files at a time and the desktop is 
   automatically switched when full (12 files each)
 - improved version of WaitLess built-in

     In addition there are various bug tweaks and little new features that 
are actually very handy. Some will be happy that the screen blanker delays 
are reset by mouse moves. Others will be thrilled that the OA-A command for 
file listings now offers a "Reverse" the order option so you can go largest 
to smallest, smallest to largest, youngest to oldest, oldest to youngest, 
etc. Other new features haven't been finalized or written. We're even still 
taking ideas, with no promises.

     BTW, some will surely scream and holler that working on AW 5 has 
delayed AW 4.3 in some unjust way. Actually, it has accelerated the fixes 
in 4.3, since they had to be done in order to create a 5.0 foundation. AW 5 
has also provided the financial justification to keep doing those free 
updates we hear so much about.

     As for cost, it will be cheaper than AW 3 to AW 4, but it's not final 
yet. It will come on two 3.5" disks and include a delta manual (changes 
since AW 4). It requires at least a 256k enhanced IIe, IIc or IIgs.

<<<<<   AW 4.0 was late for several reasons which do not apply to AW 5. It
"""""   also had some bugs due to major redesign which is not needed in AW 
5, because we allowed for many of the AW 5 features while creating AW 4. 
There will only be a delta manual for AW 5 (changes since AW 4), no video, 
no fancy packaging, etc., so development time is slashed. Also, there's 
more of an agreement between marketing and programming as to what a 
realistic date is. I fully expect to ship in late September or early 
October. Most of the tough stuff is already finished now in July.

     We're attempting to design AW 5 so that _EVERY_ AW 4-compatible 
TimeOut app will work without change, but there may be a few minor 
exceptions. Again, the major structure change in AW was the redesign from 
AW 3 to AW 4. The changes in AW 5 involve adding new features, not massive 
redesign of how everything fits together.

                   Launch Of The Mensch Computer
                   Bill Mensch & Nick Dazio

     This was a presentation by Western Design Center, the current 
licensors of the 6502, 65c02, and 65816.  The primary topic was an 
introduction of a computer that Mensch has designed to make use of a new 
microprocessor that he has designed (the 65265), but it began with the 
background of just how far reaching the lowly 6502 and 65816 have become.  
The 65c02 is used in some of the new implantable defibrillators (devices 
similar to pacemakers, but for those whose hearts go frequently into 
dangerous rhythms, it shocks the heart back into a normal rhythm); in 
closed captioning devices on newer televisions; some of the intelligent 
cable TV boxes; the mouse port on the Macintosh computer; certain stereo 
systems; and Ricoh fax systems.  The Super Ninetendo, of course, uses the 
65816, but also the Franklin Digital Book system uses it.

     The Mensch computer itself does not sound too exciting.  It uses the 
new 65265 chip, which is a 16 bit chip with many opcodes similar to the 
65816, plus some built-in ROM code that assists it in running quickly and 
efficiently.  The computer has a 16 line by 40 character LCD display; the 
keyboard uses a low power chip built into it; so the entire computer can 
run easily for hours on batteries.

     Mensch is trying to position this computer as a "consumer" computer, 
not a game computer or a business computer.  He wants it to be something 
that is so simple that ANYONE can use it, without using the manual.  It has 
built-in printer port, modem port, keyboard serial port, and "host" port 
(which allows it to be connected to a "more powerful" computer, be it Apple 
II, Mac, or PC, or to a dial-up host, such as an Internet or BBS node).  
The connectors for those serial ports are the same as those used to plug 
your telephone to the wall outlet.  Also, if a user doesn't want to use a 
keyboard, it accepts a Sega-style game controller as an input device.

     The software for the Mensch computer would be on PCMCIA cards, and 
one example would be a 10 meg card (that looks as thin as a credit card) 
which could hold an operating system, an application, and the files created 
by the user for that application.

     The market he is looking at is the low-end home and consumer market; 
those who could use something less complex than a palmtop, but more than a 
pocket organizer.  In the Far East, in countries like Korea and China and 
Japan where personal computers have made considerably less inroads than 
they have here, there are companies that are very interested in the Mensch 
computer. They don't intend it to REPLACE Macs or PCs, but rather to 
supliment them.

     Examples of things it has been tested as include consumer 
applications like e-mail, digital message center (one that would bypass the 
Internet or operate separate from it), dictionary, directory assistant 
(like the Internet utilities Archie, Gopher, etc, work), organizer, 
programmer's hobby, games, control projects (he gave an example of 
fingerprint recognition associated with use of an ATM card); 

     Much of Mensch's reason for speaking with our group today is that he 
needs programmers to design and write applications for the Mensch computer.  
IIgs programmers would be perfect for this, since they already have 
familiarity with the architecture of the opcodes and microprocessor 
(similiar as it is to the 65816).

     MY OPINION:  With a $900 price tag, it is not likely to attract much 
consumer attention, as it is not as flashy as a Mac or 486 or Pentium 
computer, though it could possibly be just as powerful.  It would not run 
with off-the-shelf software, so those who ARE computer literate would 
likely ignore it.  It does not offer anything that is significantly 
different from what you can do with an already existing computer, and it 
does not have (yet) a compelling application (that is, something that is SO 
GREAT that people have to buy the computer just to use that application.  
On the Apple IIe/IIc, it was AppleWorks.  On the Mac, it was desktop 
publishing software.  On the Super Ninetendo, it was Super Mario World.  On 
the Sega it was Sonic the Hedgehog.  Etc, etc).  

     If the price was significantly decreased, and a business in a large 
city decided to offer a videotext service using these as access machines, 
it might achieve a foothold, especially with its ability to interface with 
an already existing computer.  It really should be available in a handheld 
format (like a digital book) that has the option of plugging in a keyboard 
or transferring data between the MC and a more powerful PC (Apple II, Mac, 
or IBM).

     The Mensch computer will be built by a plant that is under 
construction in Africa, and will then be the first computer to come out of 
that continent.

     Applications where I believe the 65265 chip will likely have more 
success than will the Mensch computer will be portable pocket computers; 
countertop computers with expandible features; and multifunction 
telephones.

MACINTOSH SYSTEM 7.5 OVERVIEW          DEVELOPMENT TOOLS FOR THE MENSCH
                                       COMPUTER
Mike Pruneau, Apple Computer           Jihad Jaafar & Larry Hittel

     Here we saw some of the features in the beta release of System 7.5, 
which is coming soon, with System 8 in the next year or so.  It was 
demonstrated on a PowerMac, with 16 megs of RAM.  He gave an overview of 
Apple's plans for the rest of the 90's.  They admit that with as much power 
as the Macintosh offers today, it STILL is too hard for many people to 
figure out.  There are STILL people who will NEVER read a manual that 
explains how to use their computer, even if the manual is written in as 
clear and concise fashion as possible.  Furthermore, there will be a 
continuing revolution in communication, with Internet-->"Data 
Superhighway", Multimedia-->Interactive TV, etc.  He made a good 
comparison: "If it is easy enough for my mom to use without being told how, 
it is easy."

     System 7.5 has 70 new features, some of which were demonstrated. It 
is compatible with nearly everything out there now.  Offers a built-in PC 
exchange capability, in which an MS-DOS formatted 1.4 meg disk inserted 
into a SuperDrive will appear directly on the desktop and be able to be 
opened, etc, just like a Mac disk (and as some currently available 
extensions allow you to do).

     Mac "Easy Open" is a new extension that determines or asks which 
application should open a file if it can't be figured out.

     Drag and Drop is an enhancement on Cut and Paste.  Instead of having 
to select something (an object or text), Cut/Copy it to a clipboard, and 
then Paste into another document, you can now select it and just drag it 
directly to the other document.

     Many of the features of the Finder are now scriptable (in fact, this 
is how the advanced help feature works, which is significantly better than 
"balloon help" was).

     You can lock up to two folders from prying eyes.

     You can implement "Sticky Memos", which look like post-it notes stuck 
to the screen.

     It will support up to four 4 Gigabyte volumes.

     There will be a thread manager, for better multititasking.

     There is a graphic calculator desk accessory that was impressive.  It 
will take an X/Y/Z (three variable) equation, and display its graph in a 
window, even doing rotation of the shape that the equation defines.  On the 
Power Mac it executed VERY quickly, almost immediately.

     System 7.5 will also implement a better FindFile (similar to GS, in 
giving the locations of matching files with their pathnames, but with more 
capabilities than the GS version).

     You can now print a document by dragging the document onto a 
LaserWriter icon on the desktop (just like the Lisa used to do).

     The minimum recommended memory needed for System 7.5 will be 8 megs, 
JUST for the system (if you install EVERYTHING), and they recommend 16 megs 
if you want to do any serious work.  It offers features that are, 
admittedly, available now through inits and extensions, but these will be 
built into the system and should work properly together.

     On the PowerMac "power" demo (with a 601 PowerPC chip), he showed a 
PhotoShop application that had what appeared to be a ball, with tiny bumps 
(similar to a golf ball), with raised lettering.  Using the mouse, you 
could move a light source anywhere around on this object, and it displayed 
the shadows properly.  The rendering was as fast as it would be in real 
life, and included the ball changing smoothly from one color to another.

Jim Maricondo                          Michael Lutynski

Mike Pruneau, Apple Computer           Erick Wagner
3:20pm

     I attended the interfacing talk, as I'd already seen some of the 
PowerMac stuff.  Wagner showed how to use the Apple II Plus, IIe, IIc, or 
IIgs to connect the game port to read or control analog or digital devices.  
He pointed out that the Apple II is ideal for a dedicated application like 
this, since it has been around for a long time, and can be obtained 
relatively cheaply.  He then showed some demos of devices being read or 
controlled with his IIe.

MULTIMEDIA AUTHORING WITH CD-ROM       LOOKING GOOD IN PRINT
Greg Nelson                            Joe Kohn
4:30pm

     I went to Joe's talk.  He talked about the hardware, software, and 
page layout considerations to make when doing desktop publishing with an 
Apple II or IIgs.

     These are getting shorter, as I am getting tired or typing (and you 
are likely getting tired of reading).

     More tomorrow...

PREVIEW OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 4.0      THE INS AND OUTS OF TELECOM SCRIPTING
Pat Wilson, Microsoft                 Nathaniel Sloan
10:40

     I was curious about the new Windows, as I have used 3.1 on the 
computer at my office, so I attended the Microsoft session.  There was 
originally supposed to be a non-disclosure agreement signed, but there were 
so many details about Windows 4.0 in the Kansas City paper this morning, 
the Microsoft rep didn't feel there was any point to an NDA.

     Much of what is being done with Windows 4.0 will be in making it work 
more like the Macintosh desktop (though that is not what they state, that 
is the end result).  It will now support long filenames, up to 256 
characters, while somehow retaining backward compatability with older 
versions of MS- DOS; that is, a Windows 4.0 disk with a l-o-o-o-n-g 
filename will still be easily read by a MS-DOS 2.0, as the file will have 
two names, the original 8 and 3, and the new long one.

     They are also working on Plug & Play architecture (removing the need 
for complicated configuration files), again, very similar to what the Mac 
allows.  In face, the rep used the same "my mom should be able to do it" 
analogy that the Apple rep used yesterday.

     It will provide more powerful multitasking.

HYPERSTUDIO AS A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT    MICROSOFT OFFICE FOR WINDOWS, I
Roger Wagner                                Pat Wilson, Microsoft
1:00pm

     Roger was entertaining as always.  He gave a brief background of 
HyperStudio, and pointed out that the program is very usable WITHOUT having 
to read the manual.  He announced that in January they plan to release a 
Windows version of HyperStudio, and that stacks from the Mac version (and 
presumably the GS version) will be directly usable on the PC version.

     They've had a fair amount of success in getting the program into the 
Macintosh community without getting eaten up by sharks, as have other 
companies who have ventured out of Apple II waters.  For example: McGraw- 
Hill wanted a 40-unit multimedia educational series to produce.  They chose 
HyperStudio to do it, just because it WAS easy.

     Wagner pointed out that education has been an excellent market for 
HyperStudio.  Even though sales in that market are slow to get started, a 
product purchased by a school will usually be used for many years, because 
they can't afford to change things every few years.  Furthermore, 
HyperStudio was doing color and sound multimedia before HyperCard Mac and 
even SuperCard on the Mac could do it.  Therefore, HyperStudio had the 
advantage of getting started before the others could get in.

     Another commercial application of HyperStudio as a tool for education 
has been Texaco.  That company has made use of HS to develop some 
educational presentations about use of methods of analyzing earth to look 
for oil.  It finally gave them a way to explain this difficult concept 
understandable to people, even to engineers, that had problems grasping it.  
The animations from that stack are going to show up in a PBS program about 
the topic.

     Wagner also demoed a stack that had someones resume' on it, where the 
person had used HS to make a stack that scanned pictures of the books he 
had written, photos of the classes he had taught, etc.  It was very much an 
eye-catching presentation, and would certain stand out over others that 
were only on paper.

     Wagner has himself used an Apple QuickTake camera to take photos of 
people at ICONference, and plans to show his stack later today (maybe even 
right now).

     During his presentation, Nate Trost & another crony came in and shot 
Wagner with nerf guns.  However, undeterred, Roger continued his talk.

     They do plan on getting an updated version of HyperStudio GS out, but 
have to find someone to help do the programming work.

QUICK CLICK CALC WITH PUBLISH AND SUBSCRIBE PROGRAMMER DETAILS
Mike Westerfield
2:10pm
                                        MICROSOFT OFFICE FOR WINDOWS, II
                                        Pat Wilson, Microsoft

     Westerfield pointed out that a spreadsheet for the IIgs was 
reasonable to do now, especially since AWGS 2.0 isn't going to be appearing 
any time soon.  

     Features:

     True split screen.  There can be a _billion_ cells (limited by 
available memory).  It can read AW 3.0, and will be able to read 4.0 (and 
5.0) spreadsheet files.  QCC cannot directly read AWGS spreadsheet files 
(because the format is not known, even to Claris, and has not been 
documented anywhere), but AWGS SS files can be exported to text or DIF, 
which CAN be read.  QCC can do everything that AW3.0 SS can do.  It can 
EXPORT to AW3.0 as well.

     Data can be encrypted.  The size of the spreadsheets can be limited 
to a specific size (no more than 100 rows and 10 columns, for example).

     It has a neat graphing function, that does pie charts, bar charts, 
line charts of various types, will plot two kinds of data side by side.  
Line graphics can do "fits" of data to a line.

     Colors can be changed on single cells, and not on the entire sheet 
(as with AWGS).  Also, the height and width of individual cells (columns 
and rows, actually) can be modified to allow larger fonts, etc. to be in 
those cells.

     The "publish and subscribe" feature automates copy and paste.  The 
difference is that the changes from one SS will always be linked to make 
associated changes in the other documents that are subscribed to that 
original SS.  It does it through the use of FILES, which means that the 
updates are available any time the subscribing file is opened.

     Also does cell formatting by grades (A,B,C,D, etc) and let you do 
calculations on those letter grades (i.e., "B- + 1 = A-").  Can do date and 
time math.

     "Cell notes" are available for any cell to remind you what a cell is 
for or does. (This is also a feature planned for AW 5.0).

     Cells can be have lines drawn around them in varying thicknesses.

     What does the future hold?  It depends on the response to THIS 
product. There will be at least TWO other programs coming out, probably by 
the end of the year, that will help determine whether there will be further 
products. They would like to do further productivity products, but depends 
on whether or not there is enough response to THIS (and THESE) products.

     If you buy, and don't like, it can be returned in 30 days.

ALL ABOUT THE INTERNET                 WAY COOL AND WAY CHEAP MACINTOSH

Joe Kohn                               Bill Lynn
3:20pm

     Kohn has all the ferver of an evangelist in his presentations on the 
Internet.  He concentrated on the "Internet for Dummies" approach, stating 
that all you REALLY need is to access the World Wide Web, through Lynx (for 
text-based computers, currently including the Apple II and IIgs), or Mosaic 
(for graphic based computers, Macs & PCs).

     Because of the power of the WWW, Archie, Gopher, and Veronica 
(Internet search tools) are obsolete (according to Kohn).

     Kohn says that you should imagine what you could do if the Internet 
was on your computer, accessible through a HyperStudio or HyperCard stack, 
with the power of 10 trillion stacks strong.

HyperLogo on HyperStudio.  HyperLogo is the default language on HyperStudio 
Mac and will be the default on HyperStudio PC.

>>>>>    |he Mensch Computer will never run Apple II (8 or 16-bit)
"""""   software. Bill Mensch said that he had thought about it, but then 
decided that he should "only look forward, never back," or something to 
that effect.  In the end he intentionally decided to leave out features 
that would be necessary for it to be at all compatible with Apple II 
software.

    ][n my opinion, the Mensch Computer itself has no market, especially if 
he insists on calling it a "computer."  With that label, people are going 
to be comparing it to full desktop systems and laptops, and in all respects 
it will come up short.  On the other hand, the CPU that it uses, the 6265, 
is in my opinion very well designed and lends itself to many better uses.  
It's a great low-power semi-RISC processor that can be manufactured much 
more cheaply than any other comparable microprocessors (according to the 
figures he provided).

    |)uring the Mac System 7.5 presentation everyone kept ribbing the Apple 
marketing guy giving the presentation about how some new feature he was 
describing looked "gee, just like the Apple IIgs...."  These included a 
thermometer bar during boot and the improved Find File dialog, plus a 
couple of other minor features we've been used to using on the IIgs for 
years. (Remember when the Mac got a Fonts folder? :)

    |\/|ac System 7.5 also offers hierarchical menus in the Apple menu for 
folders and other various utilities as a standard (you no longer need to 
use a third party extension for it).
    ___
     |oday we were "treated" to a demonstration of Chicago, aka Windows 
4.0. Everyone (except, I suppose, the MicroSoft employee) left the room 
feeling "it was just like the Macintosh operating system... of six to eight 
years ago."  New features touted included copying/moving files by dragging 
them with the mouse into folders (what a breakthrough! :), no more eight 
character file name limititations (though the file names are still 
translated to eight character names and saved under MS-DOS -- as a result 
you're NOT going to see the same file names any time you drop down to MS- 
DOS), and a "task bar" at the bottom or top of the screen that contained 
the names of the currently running applications (kind of like the Mac's 
applications menu).  The only vaguely interesting thing to me that was 
mentioned was that printers being accessed through Windows 4.0 would 
automatically add their drivers to the system, if they were not present. 
Beyond that I was very bored at that session and spent a large portion of 
my time there trying not to fall asleep.

    |\/|ike Westerfield gave a quite interesting overview/demonstration of 
his new Quick Click Calc spreadsheet program.  He also gave technical 
details of its publish and subscribe features and handed out disks filled 
with documents about it and some sample source code.  The technical specs 
and notes will be available in A2Pro shortly, but not the same code.  To 
get that, though, all you'll need to do is ask Mike for it directly.  He 
just wants to keep a bit better track of the distribution of the source 
code (especially since it was taken directly from the Quick Click Calc 
source itself).

     The Byte Works, long the dominant company for Apple II development 
tools, has entered the productivity tools arena with a new Apple IIGS 
spreadsheet. Quick Click Calc is the perfect solution for:

   * Grade books
   * Balancing checkbooks
   * Weekly, monthly or yearly budget plans
   * Figuring car or house payments
   * Savings plans for college or retirement
   * A super calculator
   * Charts and graphs
   * Tracking coin or baseball card collections
   * Statistical analysis

Look What You Can Do   Spreadsheets are amazing tools.  In fact, it was the
''''''''''''''''''''   spreadsheet that really got the computer revolution 
going back in the late 70s.  Why?  Because the spreadsheet was the first 
tool on a personal computer that just worked better than any of the other 
ways of doing the same job.

     Usually, when you compare spreadsheets (or any other program), you 
quickly get into a feature war.  This spreadsheet has 53 functions, and 
that one 75, and so on.  Who cares?  Sure, Quick Click Calc has the glitzy 
features found on the Mac and PC, but the real story it what you can do 
with them.

     For example, you can keep a grade book on a spreadsheet.  Unlike a 
paper grade book, a computer grade book can do things like average your 
grades.  Quick Click Calc knows that (A+C)/2 is B, for example.  You can 
draw a pie chart showing how many people are getting As, Bs and Cs, or draw 
a graph showing how Ebenezer is doing at working and playing well with 
others.

     Of course, with a computer grade book, there's always the possibility 
that Cain will hack into the computer to change Abel's grades.  But not 
with Quick Click Calc, because you can protect your files with password 
encryption.  Without the password, the file just can't be read.

Our Manual Tells You How, Not What   Our manual helps you use Quick Click 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Calc for it's abilities, rather than 
features, too.  Oh, we have the catalog of features that you need in any 
good reference book.  But we also start off with a chapter that shows you 
how to use a spreadsheet, too.

     Using our spreadsheet cookbook, you'll learn by doing, and create 
your own checkbook and grade book in the process.  You'll see how to use a 
spreadsheet as a super-calculator to calculate loan payments for your dream 
house.

Little Things Mean a Lot   If you've used spreadsheets, you know that 
''''''''''''''''''''''''   little things can be very annoying.  For 
example, scroll bars are supposed to help you get from one end of a 
document to another.  The problem is that most spreadsheet programs have 
1000 or so rows and 700 columns, but most spreadsheet documents only have a 
few dozen rows and columns.  The scroll bar gets  hard to use.  Quick Click 
Calc lets you set the size of the spreadsheet.  You tell it how big the 
spreadsheet actually is, and suddenly the scroll bars make sense for your 
spreadsheet.

Being Two Places at Once   Whether you want to keep a multi-row header in 
''''''''''''''''''''''''   one place or compare two widely separated parts 
of your spreadsheet, you'll quickly get to like our true split screen 
controls. They literally cut the spreadsheet in half, so you can scroll two 
different  parts of the same document in the same windo.

Spreadsheets that Communicate   Quick Click Calc introduces one of the most 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   useful new features to come out of Apple to 
the Apple IIGS:  Publish and Subscribe.  And a spreadsheet is the perfect 
program for it, too.

     Publish and Subscribe is like copy and paste, but it works between 
documents.  You can create separate spreadsheets for your checkbook and 
your spouse's, then create a third spreadsheet for family finances.  With 
Publish and Subscribe, the family finances spreadsheet taps into all of the 
other spreadsheets that you use for finances.  When you enter a new check 
in your checkbook spreadsheet, then open your family finances spreadsheet, 
you see the new totals--without manually copying numbers from one 
spreadsheet to another!

Formatting is Everything   Formatting is what makes one document easy to 
''''''''''''''''''''''''   read, while another with the same information is 
hard to follow.  That's why other Apple IIGS spreadsheets can show negative 
numbers in red.  But Quick Click Calc does much more.

     Of course you can change the width of a cell, but you can change the 
height, too.  That's important, since you can set the font cell by cell, 
using  big bold fonts for titles, and small fonts when you want to see a 
lot of  information in a small space.  You can use color, too, both for 
text and for  the background--and you can use different colors in different 
cells. Heck,  you can even get rid of the default grid and create your own, 
with custom  line widths.

     Of course, this makes your spreadsheets a lot easier to read, and 
that's what's important.  Just don't tell anyone how much fun you're having 
when you are supposed to be working!

Say It With Pictures   Spreadsheets are wonderful tools for holding and 
''''''''''''''''''''   analyzing information.  Modern spreadsheets are also 
pretty good at displaying it.  Quick Click Calc gives you more ways to 
display your information than any other Apple IIGS spreadsheet--and more 
than any spreadsheet we've seen at it's price  on any machine.

     You can pick from pie charts, bar graphs, and line drawings.  There 
are several styles and lots of options for each, too, so you're likely to 
find just the right way to express yourself.

     You might be surprised at just how many ways you can display 
information.  Lots of spreadsheets give you simple bar graphs or line 
drawings, but Quick Click Calc lets you plot multiple data in more than one 
dimension.  A bar or line graph can display more than one thing, so you can 
compare information with a graph.  Some spreadsheets limit you to a single 
dimension, but Quick Click Calc plots up to 3 dimensions at once.  And you 
can even fit a line or surface to scattered data points using liner 
regression!

     Quick Click Calc is the perfect program for all your number crunching 
and graphics needs.  Get yours today!

<<<<<   This may be a bit technical for some, so if it is, keep in mind
"""""   that I'm discussing gritty details.  _Using_ Publish & Subscribe is 
very easy.

     There are three documents involved in the process of publishing and 
subscribing:  The publisher, the subscriber, and the edition.

     The publisher is the document that creates the information other 
documents subscribe to.  The edition is the file created by the publisher; 
the edition works sort of like a clipboard file, saving information 
"copied" from the publisher document.  The publisher document updates the 
edition file each time the publsiher document is saved.

     The subscriber "copies" information from the edition.  The  
subscriber copies the information each time you open the subscriber 
document.

     The effect, then, is that the information is moved between the 
publisher and subscriber each time the documents are saved or loaded.  You 
can also force the update sooner.

     Internally, an edition file is basically some header information and 
a scrap, just like a scrap you would use for copy and paste inside any 
normal desktop program.

     Since the edition information is placed in a separate file, you don't 
save disk space.  The subscriber also keeps a copy inside its own document, 
just in case the edition isn't available for some reason.  The advantage to 
using a separate file is that you don't have to have the entire publisher 
document available to  update subscribers.  I could, for example, publish 
information to an edition on a network server, and your subscriber document 
can subscribe to the edition even if my computer, with the original 
information, is turned off.  My original document can be encrypted, too, 
yet you can still subscribe without a password.

     Publish and subscribe is not hard to implement in any program that 
supports Copy and Paste with the Scrap Manager, but it isn't done 
automatically, either.  You won't be able to use Publish and Subscribe with 
AppleWorks.  I will, of course, support it with  any productivity programs 
we create.

     For even _more_ details, come to my session in KansasFest.  If you 
won't be in Kansas, watch A2Pro, where we will probably do an RTC on 
Publish and Subscribe.

Mike Westerfield   (BYTEWORKS, CAT45, TOP2, MSG:35/M645;1)

<<<<<   The question came up in an e-mail message as to just how I planned
"""""   to handle updates to QCCalc.  The answer should interest any of you 
who have bought QCCalc, or who are seriously considering it.

     Labarski's Rule of Cybernetic Entomology: "There's always one more 
bug."

     My correlary:  "There are more of them now than there will be when 
the product has been out for a few weeks."

     It's inevitable that some bugs will be found, especially right after 
a new program is released to the public for the first time. My policy for 
QCCalc is simple:  If you report a bug before the first update is released, 
I'll fix it free and fast and get the fix to you ASAP.  The first update 
will be free through a  variety of means, and won't cost you any more than 
a nominal postage fee in the absolute worst case.  If there are still a 
significant number of bugs reported after the first update, I'll probably 
repeat this cycle as needed until things settlt down.

     To give you an idea how this worked in the past, this is also the 
policy I used with 3D Logo.  In that case, with one or two  exceptions, a 
bug fix was on the way to anyone who reported it within one business day of 
the report up through the first update release.  Our free distribution 
methods for the 1.0.2 update were liberal enough that I don't think many 
people (if any) paid a dime for it.

     This policy reflects some basic facts of life, like the fact that 
there will always be _some_ bugs, and especially so for a program on the 
Apple IIGS, where the smaller number of users means testing can't be as 
extensive.  (For example, Borland C had more backorders when it shipped 
than the _total_ number of compilers for _all_ languages I've ever sold!  I 
can't afford to test like they do-- or like they should.)  I also don't 
think you should have to pay for bug fixes, but that has to be tempered by 
the fact that I don't charge Microsoft prices.

     The message to you, then, is don't be afraid to biy early, but be 
sure to report any bugs you see so you get the fix right away!

NEW FROM BRUTAL DELUXE, NEW FROM KITCHEN SINK   Usually, right after
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   publishing an issue of 
SSII, I try to give myself a short break by not thinking about the next 
issue. But, Issue #7 is already starting to take on a life of its own.

     I spent a very pleasant afternoon yesterday with 50% of the Brutal 
Deluxe team, and let's just say that I got an incredible eyeful. I 
marvelled at their upcoming releases, including Convert3200, Cogito (wow! 
wow! wow!) and Opale. So, I'll be writing up a piece on that visit, and I 
have a feeling that Cogito will be released by then, so there will probably 
also be a review of that incredible game.

     Kitchen Sink's System II has arrived; it's a Finder-like environment 
for Apple IIe/IIc systems, and it is most impressive. So, I'd like to let 
people know about that with a review, and (maybe, possibly, hopefully) a 
"Such A Deal" offer.

     Well, that would be telling!  :)  We have very firm plans (i.e., the 
project has started) for one more package, and pretty firm plans (i.e., it 
currently occupies the top of the list for the next product to start, once 
the current projects are done) for another.  Beyond that, about all I can 
say is that I don't make firm plans any further in the future than the next 
pruduct.  We are carefully examining the idea of producing a _full_ line of 
GS productivity tools, either alone or in cooperation with other companies. 
Whether we really do this will depend on the sales of the first packages 
and what other opportunities come up.

     As for specifically what the packages will be, I'll just have to say 
stay tuned.  And after the two we're definitely planning at this point, 
we'll choose from a shopping list based on what people tell us they want 
and how long we thing it will take to produce, so at this point, I have 
only a vaugue idea myself.

<<<<<   A few people have been trying to pry what our _next_ productivity
"""""   package will be, after Quick Click Calc.  Heck, I have to finnish 
the initial marketting on QCCalc before I work too much on the other 
projects!  :)

     Without going into too much detail, we are looking into the 
possibility of doing a complete line of productivity software. If we do 
this, in the long term, the software would be available across multiple 
computer platforms, and would have a few other cute features that would 
make going into those tougher markets make sense.

     The way we'll pick the order of packages to do is simple.  We look at 
how many people seem to be interested in the program, how long it will take 
to develop, and based on past sales and survey results, how many we expect 
to sell.  We then pick the one with the highest profit potential.  Sounds 
calloused, but that's the way we have to work to stay in business.  If 
there is no profit potential, then we don't do the product.

     We've already done one small survey for productivity software. When 
you get your QCCalc packages, you'll see another.  And we'll do more in the 
future.

     Here's the programs we listed on our last survey.  These are all of 
the productivity packages we've seriously considered doing so far.  This is 
_not_ a commitment to do any or all of them; I'm sure, for example, that we 
would never do everything on this list.  If you see something that you 
would like us to consider that is not on the list, though, or see something 
on the list that really excites you, be sure and let me know.

<<<<<   Wow!  For a new topic, this sure has a lot of posts
"""""   
     Basically, I'm listening.  Here's a few random comments, though:

     I _did_ come very close to releasing a Draw program a while back, and 
backed off.  Why?  There was a very large contengent of people who 
basically told me that if it wasn't AutoCAD or something similar, forget 
it.  I listened to them, and didn't release the program (which was nearing 
alpha at the time).

     I think I have to make it clear that no program I plan to develop on 
the GS is going to compete with the top of the line programs on the Mac or 
PC. That level of program would take years to develop.  Also, file formats 
on other computers are generally not as available as they are on the GS, 
where there are still serious problems, so I probably won't be able to 
manage lots of import/ export options, either.  So, if you won't take 
anything less than a program that competes with the top of the line 
programs on the Mac or PC, be sure and say so.  I'll listen to that, too.

     But then, for $60, you don't get AutoCAD on the PC, either.  ;)

     What I _am_ planning in all of the programs I do is to create 
reliable, well- crafted programs that are better than the ones currently 
available.  All will work with the Manager, and will be designed to work 
together in a reasonable way from that  environment.  All will be priced in 
the $40-$120 range.

     The list of programs I posted was from an old survey we did.  That's 
why the spreadsheet was still listed.  :)

     Since that time, I've looked into the QuickTime issue a lot.  While 
it is _possible_ to create a QuickTime player for the GS, it would be so 
slow on CD ROM based movies that you would not want to use it. From a 
technical standpoint, the best bet is a movie player that can import 
QuickTime movies and convert them to a format that is optimized for the GS.  
_That_ I can do, and may do at some point. Such a program might concevably 
offer the option of playing a movie right off of the CD ROM, but I promise 
the results would not be good enough for anything but previewing the movie 
to decide if it is worth converting to the GS format and saving on a hard 
disk.  Is this still interesting?

     Anyway, like I said, I'm listening...  :)

wanted to explain that the fact that I wouldn't be able to pass out that

>>>>>   Response to the last few messages
"""""   
     I am not sure why QC posted a message about Seven Hills Software 
considering taking on AWGS, but I know they did, so now I need post 
something about the situation to hopefully head off a flood of email, phone 
calls, and postings to our category!

     First a little history: Quality Computers approached us about doing 
AWGS a long time ago (even before they had signed a contract with Claris).  
We were very interested, but we believed QC had unreasonable expectations 
as far as what they wanted done in a given timeframe, as well as what would 
be reasonable compensation, and we told them so.

     Apparently they felt we didn't know what we were talking about and/or 
some other reason(s) because when they finally did get the source code they 
didn't come back to us.

     Over the next few months they discovered for themselves that what we 
had said was exactly true: You cannot get something for nearly nothing, and 
especially not when you are demanding it yesterday.  The sad thing is, if 
they had trusted our opinion they might already have a solid v1.2 (not 
v2.0) update.

     Flash forward to last week.  Last Friday we contacted QC to say we 
were still interested in the project.  They were interested, so we began 
working with the AWGS project manager at QC to obtain source code, bug 
lists, etc. so we can decide exactly what we can do with AWGS.

     We expected end-users would NOT learn about this so either company 
could drop out without disappointing anyone, but apparently someone(s) at 
QC thought otherwise, perhaps wanting to give the impression that they were 
"doing everything in their powers" to get an update done to AWGS.

     Whatever the reason, making any kind of announcement is very 
premature considering SHS has not even seen source code, let alone signed a 
contract. And now, if nothing comes of it, Seven Hills could look bad.  So 
let me make one thing perfectly clear:

     We _want_ to do the project, and at this point the only reason we 
might not do it would be if QC is still unwilling (or unable) to be 
reasonable in _its_ expectations of features, timeframe, and compensation.  
Basically, our offer will not be unreasonable, so if QC wants the update to 
happen, it will.

     In the meantime, PLEASE do not write/call/email/post messages about 
this. If we agree to do the update, an appropriate, official announcement 
will be made.

Sincerely,

Dave Hecker, VP of R&D

     P.S. I'm not upset with anyone who already commented here; it's a 
natural reaction! :)  Also, GWIII v1.2 is now in beta testing; we'll make a 
big announcement when it's almost done. :)

     Lynx is not currently available for GNO/ME, and considering its size, 
is unlikely to be in the forseeable future (it's a 450KB executable on a 
PC!)

     Something like Mosaic would actually be easier, since the GS toolbox 
would provide a good portion of the 'rendering' tasks that Lynx has to do 
manually.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   It is really slowing us down on the 
creation of this CD.  It looks like we now will be having 2 HFS partitions 
and one ProDOS partition, in hopes that two smaller HFS partitions will be 
handled in a more stable and usable manner by the FST. At any rate, the CD 
is right about to be premastered.  However, the HFS FST's bugs have caused 
us to lose so much time that there is a chance that the premaster might not 
be back until after I go on vacation for 3 weeks in August.  If this is the 
case then the CD will not be released until mid/late September, because it 
takes 3-4 weeks to master and replicate the CD after the premaster is 
complete and tested.  However, if the premaster gets back in time, the CD 
can be replicated while I am on vacation, and it should ship the last week 
in August or first week in September...

     Sorry to bore you with all these details.. Let me lighten it up a bit 
by giving a few statistics:

 106MB of Applications
 119MB of disks (selfbooting, non-ProDOS, etc.)
 15MB of Sounds
 31MB of Stacks
 25MB of Text
 33MB of TrueType Fonts
 2MB of Finder Extensions
 3MB of NDAs
 35MB of Graphics
 5MB of Cracks, Cheats, and Deprotects
 2MB of BASIC programs
 8MB of AppleWorks
 2MB of bitmap fonts

     And a lot more! :-) It looks like the price will probably fall around 
$60, since this whole project has taken a LOT more time than we first 
expected..

Message 237       Thu Jun 30, 1994
P.LAWRENCE5 [Frank@Work]     at 11:15 EDT
 
     Hello and Goodbye (reluctantly)

     My name is Frank Andrews.  I was an Apple II programmer for 14 years, 
and when the clock runs out on my Genie account tonight, that will break my 
last, formal link with the II line.

     Why this message?  Not to be maudlin, (I passed that point a couple 
years ago :-) but rather to know that I went out amongst the community I 
shared ties with for over a decade.

     The Apple II gave a penniless newlywed in college his first 
professional job, and a couple years later, his first 'real computer'.  I 
saw a horse run across the screen of an Apple /// at NCC (Chicago) in '81, 
read of Apple II evolution in 'Call Apple', watched windows open up a new 
world on the Lisa at Applefest San Francisco in '83 and saw and heard the 
wonder of the GS in '86, (of course I had to buy one :-)

     Floundering around the dying threads of Compuserve, I found Genie in 
1989. This was certainly the place for the Apple II user and I convinced my 
parent company to open an account (hence my Lawrence Prods. address).

     While the rumors were flying about the death of the Apple IIGS, I 
ported "The Lost Tribe" over from the PC platform, (256 color graphics and 
Midi sound), an act of defiance as much as to prove that it could be done.

     I still spend time on Compuserve and have visited other forums here 
on Genie and I have to say, the level of integrity and enthusiasm is higher 
no place else than in A2 and A2Pro.

     Financial and mental pressures have persuaded my to sell my GS now.  
I HAVE to learn Windows to eat and the call of my GS was a distraction that 
impinged too much on my acceptance of this new task.  If I had a non- 
programming job, I imagine my GS would serve my needs quite adequately into 
the next century.

     With that last thought in mind I'll close my message.

     Emotion and tradition seem to fuel the 'hang on to the GS' cry of the 
past three or four years and that has its place.  But don't let these two 
items cloud the real issue.

     Does the II still serve your needs?  If so, then why move on?  And if 
you can stay, support the many fine people who are doing spectacular work 
on the Apple II.  Procyon, ByteWorks, Sequential, Shareware Solutions, 
Quality Computers, Resource Central, SoftDisk, and on and on.  This list is 
longer than the meager offerings at the start of the II's history and is 
certainly more qualified to provide outstanding products for your needs.

     And if you have to move on, remember one thing.  It can be argued 
that we are a product of our environment.  You have spent time in what was 
once the largest and IMHO the most open and honest user communities in the 
world. The first program that an Apple II ran was once call 'HELLO', and 
what might have started as a marketing strategy became the attitude and 
outlook for a generation of programmers and users.  This kind of influence 
can not be denied and will follow you to what ever platform you choose to 
move.

     Goodbye all,

     (okay, so I was a little maudlin :-)

Frank Andrews

If so, you may be missing out some excellent information in the Bulletin

what's available and waiting for you in the bulletin board area.

    If you are serious about your Apple II, the GEnieLamp staff strongly
urge  you to give the  bulletin board area a try.   There are  literally
thousands  of messages  posted  from people  like you from  all over the

Thinking About Online Communications

                  >>> ONLINE LITERARY COLLABORATIONS <<<
                  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     At the end of the last century, the invention of the typewriter 
allowed authors to produce crisp and presentable writing.  The surge in 
book publishing in the 1890s attests to the empowering effects of the 
typewriter.  Now, a hundred years later, creative expression is again 
benefiting from new developments in technology.

     Online communications have revolutionized the way writers write and 
editors edit.  Editors can respond to proposed book or magazine articles 
within hours of receiving them.  Authors can cross-fertilize ideas with 
other authors world wide.  Complementary talents can produce synergized 
creations far greater than an individual could produce on their own.

     Take the idea generation stage of writing, for instance.  The 
individual who first thinks of an idea may not be the best person to 
nurture that idea to full blossom.  One person may be talented at thinking 
up ideas but may lack the skills to develop them -- or may not have the 
time to devote to the entire writing project.  Another person might be a 
great writer in search of ideas.  Online technologies can bring these two 
people together, allowing them to collaborate in ways unthinkable in the 
past.

     Imagine the exhilaration you might feel if one day you logged onto an 
information service or bulletin board and found that someone had sent you 
an entire play or novel they had created with your publicly shared idea.  
The finished play or novel may appear two weeks, two months, two years, or 
twenty years after your idea was first shared.  Once the idea is shared, it 
becomes a literary "soup stock" for anyone to work with.

     Literary collaborations can take place in all literary genres.  
However, in the coming years the most fruitful literary collaborations may 
well occur in the dramatic arts.  After all, coming up with an interesting 
idea for a play is no easy feat.  The person with an ear for dialogue may 
or may not possess the creative spark to think of gripping play scenarios.

     All these ideas about online literary collaborations jelled in my 
mind during an incident two or three years ago.  A friend from high school 
confided in me that he yearned to write plays.  After writing several dozen 
short plays, each with its own special charm, he arrived at the conclusion 
that his calling in life was to be a playwright.

     Having little inclination to write drama, myself, I was intrigued by 
my friend's creative bent.  How wonderful that, even today, a young author 
can develop an abiding interest in the writing of plays.  How often do you 
run into an aspiring playwright?

     Today, having read some of my friend's witty and thoughtful dramas, I 
find myself conjuring fanciful dramatic scenarios in going about my daily 
business.  "What a great idea for a play!" pops into my head at least two 
or three times each week.

     I'm not the person to bring plays to life, though.  Others feel the 
calling of the muse far more strongly.  But I'm buoyed by the fact that I 
might live a vicarious life as a playwright.  Perhaps one of my ideas might 
show up as a full length play in my electronic mailbox one day.

     Plays are not the only form of literary expression.  Online literary 
collaborations could have equal possibilities in the realm of prose.  
Consider an author on the verge of finishing a brilliant novel, but who has 
trouble coming up with a satisfactory ending.  Or an author who can't get a 
chapter "right" no matter how hard he or she tries.  Or an author who needs 
a transition from one phase of a novel to the next.   Or an author whose 
monthly computer column stops short of fully developing an intriguing idea.

     All these folks might choose to submit a draft of their writing to a 
select group of online collaborators, and then consider the suggestions 
that were offered in return.  The beauty of online literary collaborations 
is that the author still retains final say in the wording of the finished 
piece.  He or she can select from the best of the suggested changes that 
are made.  The creative and analytical skills of many persons can then 
become woven into a multi-colored tapestry of ideas.

     Writers have never had it so good.  Online communications open up 
tantalizing possibilities for creative literary collaborations.  It will be 
exciting to watch this current drama unfold.  Best of all, we all can 
become playwrights and actors in this emerging play.

              >>> EMULATION SOFTWARE AND APPLE II HYBRIDS <<<
              """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The idea of emulating a computer's functions with software and 
running the emulation on a foreign hardware system is nothing new.  One 
example, which we have already mentioned, is Insignia Solution's "Soft PC" 
emulator for the Mac.  As it turns out, Insignia is now a major player in 
the Power Macintosh line with a "Soft Windows" emulator.  However, software 
emulation of foreign hardware goes much further back than the development 
of Insignia's "Soft PC".  For example, the first BASIC programming language 
for an 8080 series microprocessor and architecture (the Altair computer) 
was written, not on an Altair, but on an EMULATION of an 8080.  This BASIC 
was developed by none other than Bill Gates, president of Microsoft 
Corporation.  The 8080 emulation that Gates used to write his BASIC was 
prepared by his friend and colleague Paul Allen.

     Paul Allen's 8080 emulation ran on a DEC PDP-10 minicomputer.  As the 
story goes, Gates and Allen had to work night and day for eight weeks to 
develop Gates' BASIC in order to cover a stretcher that Gates told to the 
Altair's developer, Ed Roberts, about having a BASIC he could sell that 
would run on the Altair.  According to the story, Gates had no idea if his 
BASIC would really run on the Altair after he and Paul Allen had finished 
it, because the BASIC was, after all, developed on an 8080 emulation.  Paul 
Allen was given the job of flying from Boston to Albuquerque and installing 
the BASIC on Ed Robert's Altair.  As it turned out, the BASIC worked 
perfectly.(1)

     It should be mentioned that Gates' early experience in programming 
for the 8080 also led him to promote the development and sales of a CP/M, 
co-processor card for the Apple II.  Microsoft Corporation called these 
cards the "SoftCard," and they sold more than 100,000 of them for Apple 
IIs.  "SoftCard" owners could not only run their Apple II software, but 
they could also run Digital Research's CP/M operating system and all of the 
desktop programs that were being written for CP/M by MicroSoft at that 
time.  With his "SoftCard," Gates hoped to jump onto Apple's Apple II 
bandwagon by selling some of his software to Apple II owners.(2)

     Microsoft wasn't the only company, however, to develop a CP/M card 
for the Apple II.  The same SoftCard technology, which uses the Zilog, 
"Z-80" 8080 clone, is also found in Applied Engineering's Z-80 coprocessor 
cards.  Additionally, there were other CP/M cards made for the Apple II and 
also made for PCs.  Past and current users of CP/M must number in the 
hundreds of thousands.  No doubt, some of those who are reading this 
article have a CP/M card which they still use.  There were a huge number of 
programs written for CP/M, including earliest versions of WordStar and 
dBase, popular programs which never appeared for the Apple II's native 
operating systems.

     Apple II users who are lamenting the discontinuation of the Apple II 
line should take heart by observing what has happened to CP/M.  While it is 
unlikely that CP/M is still being used on many native systems, it 
nevertheless continues to have a life of its own on Apple and PC hybrid 
systems that use a CP/M card.  CP/M has its own bulletin board here on 
GEnie where CP/M users can obtain help and advice on software and hardware.  
A few, very capable telecommunications programs were developed for CP/M 
that were favored by Apple users.

     In the case of the Apple II, continuation of the Apple II's operating 
systems, user environment and software is probably now dependent upon the 
development of a software emulation for the Power Macintosh computer or 
Power PC.  Both of these systems use the Motorola RISC (Reduced Instruction 
Set Computing) "PowerPC" chip.  This chip is arguably the fastest and most 
powerful CPU yet devised for personal computers. 

     The PowerPC is a 32-bit microprocessor with a "superscalar" design 
that incorporates three independent instruction pipelines or execution 
units.  These are called the "FPU" (floating point unit), "IU" (integer 
unit), and "BPU" (branch processing unit).  The PowerPC's ability to 
simultaneously process multiple instructions insures significant speed 
gains over other chips.  Additionally, the chip supports a 64-bit wide data 
bus and 32-bit external address bus, capable of addressing up to 4 
Gigabytes of system RAM.  The basic PowerPC chip, the MPC-601, runs at a 
blindingly fast 60 Mhz in the base "Power Mac 7100/60."(3)

     Because of its power, small size, and cool operating temperature, it 
seems likely to many computer watchers that the PowerPC will gain a 
significant market share in personal computers over the Intel x86 series 
processors within coming months.  The chip is not only very powerful, but 
it is especially well-suited for multitasking and for running emulation 
software at acceptably fast speeds.  The first Macintosh versions of this 
computer are currently running a hybridized version of System 7, especially 
configured to make use of the PowerPC's native architecture.  In the 
future, as more and more of the Mac operating system is translated into 
PowerPC code, software is guaranteed to run faster and faster.

     Many programmers on GEnie have expressed their interest in the idea 
of writing an Apple II emulator for the Power PC or Power Mac, and at least 
one programmer on GEnie has announced that he is actively working upon a 
IIgs emulation for the PowerPC.  Quality Computers has announced in its 
publication ENHANCE that they are looking into development of an Apple II 
emulator.  However, as of this writing, no Apple II emulation has yet been 
offered for sale for the PowerPC architecture.

     Software emulations of the Apple II already exist for use on other 
architectures, however.  One emulation, designed to be run on 286 and 
386-level PCs, can even be downloaded right here on GEnie (#23169; 
APL2EM.ZIP).  The program reportedly runs DOS 3.3 and uses disk image files 
for 5.25 disks and drives.  It is said to work acceptably with all types of 
Apple II software except communications software.  (There is some 
speculation that its emulation is based on an illegal copy of the Apple II 
ROMs, however.)  In addition to this PC-ready Apple II emulator, there are 
commercial versions of Apple II emulators for the Mac.  For example, a 
company called Pegasus Technology wrote and marketed an Apple II emulator 
called "II In A Mac." 

     Pegasus sold its "II In A Mac" emulation software for $149.  You can 
download a review of the Pegasus emulator from the GEnie Macintosh software 
library.  "II In A Mac" offered a surprising number of features well before 
Apple's introduction of its IIe PDS card.  These features included 
emulation of IIe 64K ROMs, 128K of memory with emulation of an auxiliary 
slot card, emulation of a printer port, a modem port, an 80 column card, 
and emulation of 5.25" drives.  "II In A Mac" used the Mac's native 3.5" 
drive directly, while "disk image" files were also used to simulate disks 
in 5.25" Apple II drives on the Mac's hard drive.  In order to get software 
from real 5.25" disks onto the Mac's hard drive, the user was required to 
use a cable transfer, modem, or 3.5" disk copy methods.

     Popular 8-bit Apple II programs such as ProTERM, AppleWorks and 
ProSel were said to have run successfully under the Pegasus Apple II 
emulation, although they were reported to be painfully slow on the Mac's 
68000 and 68020 Motorola processors.  The 68030 processor was said to run 
"II In A Mac" at an acceptable speed, however.  

     According to information published in July's GEnieLamp A2, a similar 
program to "II In A Mac" will soon be available for commercial sale.  Like 
the Pegasus software, this emulation program, called "STM," will also run 
on native Macintoshes.  No announcement has yet been made about a (native) 
Power Mac version of "STM."  The program reportedly emulates a 64K Apple 
II+ with the DOS 3.3 System Master.  While the initial report seems to 
indicate that "STM" has somewhat less power than "II In A Mac," the 
emulation offers something that "II In A Mac" did not offer.  It will come 
on a CD-ROM disk, and it will be bundled with a great deal of original 
Apple II software.  Like "II In A Mac," "STM" will use disk image files to 
emulate 5.25" drives and disks, and it will apparently also use similar 
methods to the Pegasus software for copying files from native Apple II 
disks.  

     In this writer's opinion, STM's marketing innovations may best 
illustrate how a future, enhanced Apple IIe (or even a IIgs) emulation 
might ultimately be packaged and sold.  In order to determine how 
programmer's view the idea of writing and selling a full-function Apple IIe 
or IIgs emulation for the Power Mac, an informal survey was recently sent 
to 18 programmers who post messages frequently on GEnie's A2 programmer's 
bulletin board.  The programmers were guaranteed anonymity in exchange for 
their honest responses to the survey.  Many of those who were polled are 
people who have written very popular IIe and IIgs shareware and commercial 
software, stuff that nearly all of us in the Apple II community possess and 
use.

     The survey asked the programmers to respond to questions about the 
likelihood of whether Apple IIe and/or IIgs emulators will be produced and 
sold for the PowerPC.  The respondents were asked to rate probabilities for 
each question from "low" to "high" by marking a Likert-type scale from "1" 
to "4" for each of the questions asked.  The respondents gave an Apple II 
emulator for the PowerPC an above-average chance of being written and sold.  
An Apple IIe-only emulator for the Power PC was also given an above-average 
chance.  However, an Apple IIgs emulation was given virtually no chance of 
being written and sold.  

     Some programmers felt that no COMMERCIAL version of an Apple II 
emulator for the PowerPC would be made available for sale, but, they said, 
a SHAREWARE or FREEWARE version would be written and made available for the 
PowerPC architecture on bulletin board services.  This would be done, they 
predicted, by hobbyists or by others as a "labor of love" and as an 
exercise in learning the PowerPC architecture.  One programmer predicted 
that Apple Computer, itself, would write and sell a IIe emulation which 
would be based upon the Mac LC's PDS card and system software.

     The survey also asked additional questions about the problems and 
advantages connected with writing an Apple II emulation for the Power Mac 
or PC.  Three problems were cited most frequently by the respondents.  
First, most felt that the market for a IIgs emulation was too small to 
justify the development costs in view of the tremendous time and effort 
involved in writing the emulation.  A IIe emulation was felt to be more 
likely, however, in view of the IIe's larger potential market and greater 
simplicity.  The next problem that was frequently cited concerned access to 
Apple's ROM code for either a IIe or IIgs.  Several felt that Apple simply 
would not cooperate with programmers by making the ROM code available from 
either system for an emulation.  

     As evidenced by the existence of previous 8-bit, Apple II emulators, 
the ROM code for an 8-bit Apple II could probably be obtained without 
Apple's assistance.  In addition to those Apple II software emulators we've 
already mentioned, the Franklin, Laser, and Trackstar card were Apple II 
hardware knockoffs that also used emulated 8-bit, Apple II ROMs.  However, 
no IIgs knockoff has ever been done, and many of the programmers surveyed 
felt that the IIgs ROM-based toolset would be very difficult, if not 
impossible, to duplicate from scratch.  

     The third and final problem, cited most frequently by the 
programmers, concerned management of 5.25" disk drive software.  Because 
the best market for a IIe emulator would be public schools, it would be 
important to provide a means of accessing the huge amount of educational 
software found on 5.25" disks in the schools.  If there were no way to 
attach and access a 5.25" disk drive to a Power Mac or Power PC system, 
then the disks would have to be copied.  However, much of the educational 
software that people would like to run under a IIe emulation is copy 
protected.  Therefore, while disk image files might provide a potential 
means of accessing this software on a Power Mac system, it may simply not 
be possible to copy a lot of it, without assistance from the software 
manufacturers.

     Interestingly, the ability to access 5.25" educational software, such 
as MECC software, was also cited as one important, potential ADVANTAGE of 
an Apple II emulator.  Another advantage, frequently mentioned by the 
respondents, was that a IIe or IIgs emulation would provide a relatively 
painless way for some Apple IIe or IIgs users to migrate to the Power Mac 
or PC platform.  Some mentioned that, in the unlikely event that IIgs 
emulation software could become available, the postscript printing 
capabilities of the IIgs would come in quite handy for those users whose 
budgets would not allow the immediate purchase of Mac or Power Mac desktop 
printing programs.

     None of the survey's respondents mentioned the ability to run IIgs 
game software as an advantage of developing a IIgs emulation.  While most 
of the programmers felt that an Apple II emulator could be sold for no more 
than the current price of an Apple IIe PDS card (currently about 
$125-$139), one programmer felt that a full IIgs emulator could bring as 
much as $200.  It seems reasonable to ask, however, if a IIgs emulator 
might not bring MORE than that, if the IIgs emulator could be bundled 
together with excellent shareware and commercial game software.  A IIgs 
emulator could potentially expand the selection of games that would be 
available to PowerPC users and could ultimately help to resurrect many 
games that are no longer being sold.   Ultimately, some of the best games 
might even be ported to native PowerPC code.

     Having asked the experts about the likelihood of an Apple II 
emulator, I would now like to stick my neck out and make my own 
predictions.  First, an Apple IIe-specific emulator will almost certainly 
appear within the next 12 to 18 months for the PowerPC.  It will possess at 
least as much power, speed and capability as the LC's IIe PDS card and 
system software.  Apple will probably produce the emulator, or they will 
license their IIe ROM code to another company who will produce the emulator 
with Apple's guidance and blessings.  Apple's purpose will be to provide 
further incentives to public schools (still a significant part of Apple's 
market) to begin to purchase Power Macs.  If Apple does not produce a IIe 
emulator, then a shareware version of the IIe will almost certainly be 
produced.

     New software tools, which may make it relatively easy to port system 
software and applications, hover just over the horizon.  They will become 
available specifically because of the tremendous increases in computing 
power that are promised by the new generation of RISC hardware now being 
introduced.  One such tool, known as "FlashPort" already exists for IBM's 
RS/6000 workstation.  Echo Logic, owner of FlashPort, is reportedly 
planning an MPC-601 version of the software, which is capable of 
translating the binary instructions from software written for one processor 
into equivalent binary instructions for another processor.(5) 

     A IIgs emulator will be a while in coming, but it may eventually make 
an appearance.  CD-ROM is fast becoming a computer industry standard, and 
eventually most computers will come with a built-in CD-ROM drive.  
Considering that a compact disk can store such tremendous volumes of data, 
it seems possible that an enterprising software vendor may choose to bundle 
several computer emulations (such as the Commodore series, Amiga and Apple 
IIgs) together with the best of their software on a single CD -- a sort of 
'goldie oldies' disk for nostalgic computer users.

     While all Apple II users now enjoy the benefits of a mature computer 
system and software, the future also continues to look bright.  New, 
promising technologies are making their appearance.  Software and hardware 
capabilities are steadily increasing while the relative cost of personal 
computing is going down with increased competition and sales volume.  The 
Apple II still has a long life ahead, possibly in new, exciting, 
incarnations.

                  >>> NEVER BACK UP YOUR HARD DRIVE! <<<
                  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

         [Reprinted with permission from the NovApple Newsletter]


     Last month [in NovApple] we ran an excellent article on the 
necessity, and how, to back up a hard drive by Steve Weyhrich [from the 
June 1994 GEnieLamp A2].  However, let me present an alternative view.

     Boy, that title sure is a heretical statement!  But before you get 
all bent out of shape, let's look first at the purpose of a hard drive, and 
then at the problems with back-up programs, and the process of backing up.

     A hard drive is known as a "mass storage device".  What does that 
mean?  Simply put, that you can put a large amount of data on it, including 
programs and data files.  But that is only one function of a hard drive.  
Its major advantage is fast access to either programs or data.  So we find 
two primary purposes of a hard drive, essentially put, can be called speed 
and quantity.  The quantity, however, also increases your vulnerability.  
If the hard drive dies, you have "zero" speed, and no quantity of data or 
programs at all!

     It is to protect yourself from this catastrophe that the concept of 
"backing up your hard drive" developed.  And for this purpose, several 
programs have been written.  These programs create an image of your hard 
drive's complete data on floppy disks (of some size) or tape.  This has 
several inherent problems.

     1.  It wastes a considerable amount of time.

     2.  You are out of operation for some period of time until you can 
         get the hard drive fixed, and then restore your backup.

     3.  You are still vulnerable to a "munged" backup that you can't 
         restore.

     Hard drives collapse in many forms.  It can just mechanically die for 
a number of reasons.  The surface can get bad, or deteriorate (bad blocks).  
Directories can get munged by whatever means they get munged -- such as 
cosmic rays <grin> (it does happen fairly often).  In some cases you can 
rebuild the data, in others you have to repair the device.  But in ALL 
cases, you are out of operation until you fix the errors or the device.

     If the hard drive must be mechanically repaired, you must send it off 
somewhere to be fixed.  And for this period of time you are down.  Back-ups 
will not allow you to work with any files on them, they can only be used 
for restoring the data that was on the hard drive at the time that you made 
the last backup that you have!  Thus, if you did a backup last week, the 
rest of that weeks work, and all of this weeks work, is lost, gone forever 
into the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky!

     However a backup is a very inefficient way to provide yourself with 
data protection.  Let's look at them in principle.  All back-up programs 
copy the entire hard drive (at least once) to prepare a backup image.  This 
includes programs as well as data.  But this process means duplicating onto 
the backup information you already have.  (Or at least, should have.  You 
should have made a duplicate of your original program disk when you 
purchased it, and a second duplicate if updates to the program arrived.  
Then duplicate the updated copy, leaving the original and its' duplicate 
unchanged.  Thus, you would now have an original and its duplicate, as well 
as an updated version and its' duplicate.  You would continue to do this as 
long as you received updated versions.  And each time, of course, copy the 
updated version to replace your working copy on the hard drive.)

     An aside here.  Some programs (most notably AppleWorks) will have 
been customized with accessory utilities, patches, and so forth that you 
really wouldn't want to have to do all that over again from scratch (if you 
can even remember what you added, OR REMOVED)!  So these original programs 
I treat differently(although I have all of the original patches, add-ons, 
etc.).  For a highly modified program such as AppleWorks, I make a special 
"backup" of that program!  Using ShrinkIt, I shrink the modified, complete 
set from the hard drive onto a 3.5" disk.  Actually, I do it twice, to two 
different disks.  Now, if I must restore it, I can simply unshrink that 
file back to the repaired hard drive, without the fuss of re-patching, 
re-customizing, etc.  I'll tell you more on the use of the program ShrinkIt 
for protection of you data in a bit.

     If you are collecting fonts or graphics or sounds, or other specialty 
type files, these would be on the hard drive for fast access.  But you 
should also have an original source disk and a duplicate disk of each 
source disk on disks standing by.

     So what you are really trying to do is protect data files.  There are 
two classes of data files created by the different programs you use.

     1.  Archive copies of data files previously used, that you really 
want to keep; e.g. the data files of last year's tax returns in a 
spreadsheet.  It seems evident to me that these should not be kept on a 
hard drive, where they are simply using up space but never being accessed, 
but rather archived on floppies (with duplicate disks, or even triplicates, 
if they are important enough, such as tax files).  Whether these are 5.25" 
or 3.5" disks, these files should be off the hard drive and safely 
duplicated.

     2.  So this leaves us only the second class of data files:  the data 
files that are currently in use.  No matter what program they are generated 
from, they need to be on the hard drive for convenient and FAST access.  
However, if you are following the prudent course of duplicates for all your 
programs and special files (fonts, graphics, etc.) and have moved your 
archived files off the hard drive, then you would be doing a backup of your 
ENTIRE hard drive ONLY to secure safety for these relatively few data 
files.

     There is another way to secure protection for this small group of 
data files.  Make duplicates AS YOU WORK ON THEM onto your floppies.  
Certainly 3.5" disks are better, but if you only have 5.25" drives, they 
will also do.  Everyone knows the need to save often, and a hard drive 
certainly makes this easier and faster.  It is not much trouble to save 
these important files TWICE when you "save often".  Once to the hard drive, 
once to the floppy.

     If the program that you are using allows some type of macro, a simple 
keystroke saves your file twice.  If not, a method of organizing types of 
files to floppies makes life much easier.  All data disks can have the same 
name, with the same subdirectory.  Just place the type of file on the 
external paper label for quick identification.

     As an example, using 3.5" disks, I name all of these duplicate data 
disks /T, and under that a single subdirectory called M.  This means that 
if I pick up the "Journal" disk (or "Checkbook" disk, etc.), I still save 
to the same location "/T/M".  This then becomes my protection.  By saving 
twice, first the hard drive, then the floppy (at pathname /T/M) I have 
secured almost absolute safety.

     Actually, what I do, since these data files are critically important 
to me, is to save them three times -- first to the hard drive, second to a 
floppy disk paper labeled "Journal", and third to a floppy disk paper 
labeled "Journal.Dup".  Both disks, of course named "/T", with a 
subdirectory named "/M".  So the second saving location for all disks 
becomes "/T/M".

     I have saved hours and hours per week, and many, many disks, for the 
cost of a few seconds and a few keystrokes!  If my hard drive dies, all I 
need to do to continue working is use the floppies as my primary disk 
source.  No waiting weeks or more unable to do anything until the hard 
drive is returned!  When it does come back, I can rebuild the programs and 
data on the hard drive as before (or change the organization if I want).

     Most backup programs have an inherent weakness.  They are dependent 
on the quality of the disk (or tape) you did the backup to.  If there is a 
bad block (or even file header) on the backup, most will just die.  And 
there goes your backup!  No more!  Kaput!  Gone forever.  Even though the 
ProSel-16 backup utility does have a recovery algorithm, it can still fail.  
And if you are not on a IIgs, the 8-bit programs do not have such a 
protection.  Most backup programs do not allow a partial backup (or where 
they do, it is very awkward).  And, of course, you have to purchase most of 
them.

     But I don't want to do all this saving to floppies.  I purchased the 
hard drive for the speed and single convenience.  Is there any other 
alternative?  Yes, at least it seems so to me.  Another way is to make a 
duplicate of your working files to one subdirectory on your hard drive, and 
replicate that onto a floppy disk daily.  So here you are using the hard 
drive alone for its speed.  Save to the "organized" subdirectory where the 
data belongs.  Then save to a hard drive subdirectory called "Today" or 
whatever you wish.

     Now, at the end of the day, replicate this subdirectory unto a 
floppy.  What do I mean by replicate?  Shrink the entire subdirectory onto 
a disk at the end of each day!  Yes, ShrinkIt does a nice protection job 
for you.  And by shrinking the files -- and it shrinks data files quite a 
lot, that is, makes the resultant file substantially smaller -- you save 
time and space.  You can easily unshrink to another disk if you lose your 
hard drive.  There is even a special file recovery program if something is 
wrong with the shrunk file or disk.  Just run UnShrink to recover the data.  
It works great!

     So an alternative procedure is, save to the files regular 
subdirectory, save to the subdirectory "Today", shrink the full 
subdirectory at the end of the day to a floppy, then delete the files under 
"Today" to get ready for tomorrow!

     Another advantage of the shrink approach is that the software is all 
freeware, and is available many places.  So is the ShrinkIt recovery 
program, UnShrink.

     Of course, if you have "forked" data files from a particular 16 bit 
program, you cannot use 8-bit ShrinkIt, but must use ShrinkIt GS.  It too 
is a freeware program, and available many places.

     If ShrinkIt just would shrink over the boundaries of one disk to the 
next, it would be an excellent backup program.  When I last talked with 
Andy Nicholas (about two years ago) he was working on such a program.  
However, my guess is that since he is a Mac programer now with Apple 
Computer, Inc., he has dropped that project.

     There is, of course, one situation where this approach won't work, 
and where doing a regularly scheduled back-up MUST be done (isn't there 
always a BUT?), and that is if you don't have control of the creation and 
saving of the files.  A perfect example of this is a Bulletin Board System 
(BBS).  Here, weekly (or more often) back-ups are essential.

     But, for me at home or work, I NEVER do a back-up of my hard drive!

A Vacation from Reviewing
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Darrel Raines
      [D.RAINES]



                     >>> GETTING AWAY FROM IT ALL <<<
                     """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Last month I took one of the longest vacations that I have taken 
since graduating from college.  My family and I traveled from the teeming 
metropolis of Houston, Texas, to the cool, mountain streams of southern 
Colorado.  We spent a little over two weeks (including travel time) 
camping, hiking, horseback riding and otherwise enjoying ourselves.  We are 
talking about real camping here:  Tents, camp stoves, sleeping bags, eating 
outdoors with the mosquitoes, etc.  We had a great time!

     What has my camping trip to do with computers?  About a year ago, I 
purchased a portable sub-notebook computer for those occasions when I 
travel.  I had been feeling out of sorts when I went on a business or 
personal trip and did not have a handy word processor and spreadsheet.  I 
have really enjoyed my "travel" computer; it does a good job of what I want 
it to do.  I have not taken a single trip without my digital umbilical cord 
since the day that I purchased it.  That is, until my latest camping trip.

     I thought seriously about taking the sub-notebook along for the ride. 
 However, the dirt and extreme weather conditions that I would encounter 
made me decide against taking the computer with me.  This proved to be a 
drastic decision.  I was not aware of how dependent I had become on my 
readily available computer.  I went through some extreme withdrawal.  The 
headaches and minor shakes were the most noticeable symptoms.  However, my 
wife also claims that I was edgy and somewhat distant for the first few 
days of abstinence.  I was even known to snap at the children.  This lasted 
for the duration of the trip.

     After my harrowing experience, I have decided to chronicle the events 
of my vacation as a warning to other computer junkies.  You may have a 
similar situation come up and be faced with the following decision:  take 
your computer, or your clothing.  After this article, I am sure that you 
will decide that you would rather shop for a new wardrobe on your trip.  As 
a public service, this month's column will examine the various facets of 
camping without a computer.

DAY 1   I knew I was in trouble the very first day on the road.  We have
"""""   made a good day of travel toward the northwest edge of Texas. 
However, I am force to purchase gasoline without the benefit of my 
computer's powerful calculator functions.  There is just no way to 
determine what my mileage was and how far I could expect to travel before 
having to fill up again.

     Another problem is the kids' questions.  Our children are constantly 
asking about this subject or that.  I am in desperate need of my handy 
CD-ROM encyclopedia.  How am I supposed to know how much cotton there is in 
a bale?  Of course I don't know the population of Littlefield, Texas.  The 
mayor of Littlefield probably doesn't know the population of his town.

     As we check into a motel for the night, the real gravity of the 
situation starts to sink in.  I won't be able to play a game on my computer 
for another week and a half!  At this point, only a threat of divorce from 
my wife keeps me from turning back to Houston and my 8-megabyte mistress.  
I sleep fitfully during the night.

DAY 2   I wake up slowly.  I feel a strange sense of loss, but cannot 
"""""   remember what is wrong.  And then suddenly it all comes back to me 
in a rush.  On the road with no computer.  Aargh!

     We continue our travel into New Mexico.  The excitement of being away 
from Houston and the anticipation of the mountains starts to raise my 
spirits.  However, a major calamity hits just as we head into southern 
Colorado.  I forgot to put the road maps into our pickup.  I manage to make 
a wrong turn in Chama and end up on the wrong side of the San Juan National 
Forest.  My wife is not happy.  "But dear, if I had my computer along with 
us we could have verified the correct road using my travel atlas."  My wife 
is not talking to me.

     Despite my navigation talents, we arrive in our designated camping 
area in time to set up the tent before dark.  As soon as dusk starts to 
settle in we know we are in trouble.

     "Darrel, can our three-year-old fly?"

     "Not to my knowledge, dear."

     "In that case, the mosquitoes are carrying off our youngest child." 
We rescued our son and took a bath in mosquito repellent.

DAY 3   This will be our first full day of camping.  The fresh air and 
"""""   sound of the mountain stream awakens me.  I am the first camper to 
arise.  I sit in my lawn chair and read a book until the rest of the crew 
is up.  We decide that pancakes would taste good.  I tell my family that I 
had a great recipe in the computer cookbook back in Houston.  My oldest 
daughter groans and hands me a box of pancake mix.  The instructions on the 
side say to just add water.

     We decide to go hiking later in the day.  The trail head is up high 
in the mountains.  The tall pine trees and colorful wildflowers make for a 
gorgeous walk.  The children discover a series of cracks, or fissures, in 
the ground where the earth has opened up to swallow the unwary.  At the end 
of our hike, I realize that I did not even think about my computer for the 
past two and a half hours.

DAY 4   Horseback riding is the activity of the day.  We see a young stag 
"""""   deer along the way.  He is evidently used to seeing humans looking 
uncomfortable atop a horse.  The deer doesn't bolt until we are within 20 
feet of the tasty grass that he is eating.  After we get back from the 
ride, I hobble over to tell my wife that I need to start a journal of our 
activities.

     "This stuff will make a great article!  I wish that I had my computer 
and word processor with me."

     "Here is a pencil and paper.  Have fun."

     "I haven't used this stuff in years.  There isn't even a pencil 
sharpener out here.  What happens when the lead gets dull?"

     "Use your pocket knife."

     I whine; I whimper; I end up with the pencil broken over my head. 

DAY 5   Another hike is planned for this day.  I have trouble figuring out 
"""""   how far we hike in the three-hour trip.  I discover that I cannot 
do multiplication any more.

     We are thrown out of a restaurant because I fondle the keyboard of 
the cash register.  My two daughters are embarrassed beyond belief.

DAY 6   Laundry day.  We spend the entire day in town buying souvenirs.  I 
"""""   finish off the first book that I brought on the trip.  I seem to 
have lots of time to read.

DAY 7   Today is July 4.  We go to a beautiful fireworks demonstration.  
"""""   Our daughter tells my wife, "These are just like the fireworks that 
daddy has on his computer."  I hear a heavy sigh in the dark.

DAY 8   We hike along the Continental Divide.  There are a few patches of 
"""""   snow still clinging to the shade of the pines at this high 
elevation.  The kids have a snowball fight.  Our son, a life-long Houston 
resident, has never seen snow before.  He wants to make Frosty the Snowman.  
In July!

DAY 9   A burst of deep sobbing wakes my wife up in the middle of the 
"""""   night.  "What are you crying about?" she asks.

     "I miss my computer... ouch!  Don't DO that!  I'll be quiet."

     We go hiking one last time.  I start my third book.  I love to sit 
and read by the mountain stream that runs behind our tent.  A tall pine 
offers shade and a good back rest.  The view is lovely and the melted snow 
makes a constant murmur as it falls over the rocks.  The watery drone 
reminds me of something from home.  Oh yes, now I have it.  The computer 
fan in my study serves as a similar source of white noise.

     My family claims that they will through me in the river if I complain 
one more time about not having a handy computing device.

DAY 10   Today we bid the forest goodbye.  The morning is spent in breaking 
""""""   camp and erasing all traces of our having been there.  This is no 
small task since there were 5 children and 4 adults in our group.  "I wish 
that I had my computer so I could take a quick look at our bank account 
information."

     Splash.

DAY 11   It will not be long now.  My fingers start to itch just at the 
""""""   thought of touching the keyboard.  We eat green chiles in New 
Mexico.  Why can't we get good chiles in Houston?  When will satellite 
modem links be available throughout the country?  I spend the day 
contemplating the mysteries of life.

DAY 12   We arrive back in Houston.  Sweet rapture!  I play a game, balance 
""""""   my checkbook, and catch up on BBS news one right after the other.  
My wife finds me asleep at my computer keyboard the next morning.  She 
claims that I was tapping my heels together and murmuring, "There's no 
place like home. There's no place like home."

Yours For the Downloading
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Charlie Hartley
      [C.HARTLEY3]


     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month we will examine 12 
different files.  There is no central theme this month, but I think there 
is something here for almost everyone.  Let's get started.


                                 [*][*][*]

      TO.PERPCAL.BXY   File #22882    9472 bytes    AppleWorks Macros
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
               Perpetual Calendar macros 1.3 [12 June 1994]
                  freeware -- copyright 1994 by Doug Cuff
  algorithm partly based on an Applesoft BASIC program by ANTHONY DEBOER


     Doug Cuff [EDITOR.A2] has produced a neat little AppleWorks macro 
package.  In his long description, Doug says that this is a compact, 
memory-only perpetual calendar for AppleWorks.  It contains TimeOut menu 
file for users and macro source code for programmers.  It requires the 
built-in UltraMacros player or UltraMacros 4.2 or later.

     The download includes 4 files. TO.CALENDAR.NOW is the Timeout file 
that you place in your Timeout folder.  MACRO PERPCAL is the AppleWorks 
word processor file that contains the macros ready to compiled.  NOTES 
contains Doug's directions about how to use these macros.  VERSION HISTORY 
is just what is says.

     Once installed, it will appear on the Timeout menu as CALENDAR NOW.  
You may select it from anywhere within AppleWorks.  When selected, it first 
displays the present month in a box in the middle of the screen.  Near the 
bottom is a request to press a key.  When you press a key you are shown a 
menu of choices that include

          Choose calendar year/month     Solid Apple-C
          Today's monthly calendar       Solid Apple-T
          Launch default macros          Both Apples-L

     You may choose from this menu by highlighting your choice and then 
pressing return.  The first choice allows you to input the year you want.  
Then it displays a list of months to choose from.  The list also includes 
"whole year."  You are then shown the month/year that you selected.  If you 
selected the whole year, you are shown a month at a time, beginning with 
January.

     The second choice displays the present month again. The third choice 
launches your default macros for you.

     Using the escape key makes things a bit different.  If you press the 
escape key while the calendar is on-screen, you will get a message at the 
bottom that says "Calendar stopped ... please press a key."  Any keypress 
at this point will take you to the menu.  If you press escape at the menu, 
you will leave the menu but will not return to you default macros.  This 
means that the calendar is available to you with the Apple keypresses.  
However, your default macros are not available.  You can easily get the 
default macros back by pressing both Apple keys and the L key to launch 
them.

     Since our current calendar, the Gregorian, did not exist before circa 
1582, you can't use a year earlier than that.  However, Doug does let you 
go all the way to the year AD 9999. <grin>

     I highly recommend this little jewel!

     Ken Wong has provided us with an amusing story of Polly Nomial.  Ken 
says that he discovered this file over ten years ago on his first DEC VAX 
system.  Unfortunately, he forgets the original author.

     If you are into math and have at least a slightly ribald sense of 
humor, you will enjoy this little story.  Even a non-mathematician, such as 
myself, can have fun figuring out the play on mathematical terminology.

              Nightfall II - an Apple II planetarium program
                     Copyright 1994 by John L. Graham
                          Shareware fee is $10.00


     The following two paragraphs are lifted from John's documentation 
file included with this program.

     "Nightfall II is a planetarium program designed to display what the 
night sky will look like easily and quickly.  The display includes all of 
the stars you're likely to see even on an exceptionally dark urban night as 
well as the Moon and planets (Mercury through Saturn).  If the selected 
time is in daylight, the Sun is also shown.  The view can be set to show 
the entire sky overhead, or looking out towards the horizon at one of the 
major compass points (e.g., north, south, east, or west).  Each display may 
be saved to disk so that you may edit and print them using your favorite 
graphics program like Dazzle Draw or TimeOut Paint/Graph.

     "In addition to displaying views of the sky Nightfall II calculates 
the times of rising and setting of the Sun, Moon, and planets (Mercury 
through Saturn)."

     About all you need to know to use this neat program is your 
approximate latitude and longitude and your time zone.  Time zones may 
include any from 0 to 12.  Zero (0) is Greenwich, England time.  Five (5) 
is Eastern time, six (6) is Central time, seven (7) is Mountain time, eight 
(8) is Pacific time, nine (9) is Alaska time, and ten (10) is Hawaii time.

     It appears that the program displays the sky only over the Western 
Hemisphere.  To get a display for areas south of the equator, there is a 
menu item that has you switch from north to south.

     Saving a view to disk is simple.  There is a menu choice to save the 
screen.  Just remember that you must follow ProDOS file-naming procedures:  
the name must begin with a letter, may include only letters, numbers and 
periods, and may be no longer than 15 keystrokes.  Note that the screen are 
saved as a one double-hi-res file.  Also, if you want to save to a 
different disk, you must type the entire pathname.

     If you are looking for a program that will teach you the names of the 
stars and constellations, this is not it.  What you get with Nightfall II 
is a display of the visible sky with the stars shown according to their 
magnitude.  You also get the locations of planets (identified by name in a 
legend) and the sun and moon.

     I can see how this program, with a book that identifies the major 
stars and constellations, could be a big help in locating them in your own 
sky.

     For those of you with Apple IIes and IIcs, this is a fine program, 
well worth the $10 shareware fee.

     For those of you with GSes, John also has produced a program called 
Tonight's Sky GS v4.2 that is available in the library as file #18304.

      SNEEZE.BXY    File #21357   40448 bytes    File Viewer/Launcher
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
              Sneeze ("Applesoft Text-Based User Interface")
                              by Karl Bunker
                          public domain software


     Karl Bunker has provided the Apple II world with a variety of neat 
programs and utilities.  Perhaps my personal favorite is Sneeze.  I first 
came across this jewel several years ago before it evolved into its present 
form.  As a programmer, I learned several things from studying Karl's work 
and was able to incorporate them into some of my stuff.

     Sneeze does so many things, so well, that I doubt even those who have 
already downloaded it know what all it can do.  This brief review will 
point out some of my favorite options available with this program.

     The descriptions below are lifted for the most part from Karl's 
documentation file that is included with the program.  Read the 
documentation!  I know people who hate to read documentation, preferring to 
learn by experimenting with a program.  Those people will be a long time 
making full use of Sneeze.

     "Sneeze ("Applesoft Text-Based User Interface" --> "A.T.U.I." --> 
"Sneeze") is a text-and-graphics-display/menu/launcher program originally 
written for A2-Central On Disk.  Thanks to the generosity of the people at 
A2-Central, I am able to release this public domain version to be used by 
anyone for any purpose, free of charge.  (For subscription information on 
A2-Central magazine, write to: A2-Central, P.O. Box 11250, Overland Park, 
KS 66207)

     "Sneeze evolved from an earlier program called 'Windows'.  Windows 
(or 'Window') was originally written by Andy Anderson 1987, and was later 
extensively modified by Karl Bunker -- with help from Dean Esmay.  Sneeze 
is the result of a complete rewrite of that version of Windows (and Sneeze 
version 2.0 is the result of a complete rewrite of Sneeze 1.x).  As one 
might expect from a program with such a long and involved history, Sneeze 
is now quite a formidable little program.  Here's a partial list of what it 
can do:


     * Navigate through your disks and directories.
     * Launch BASIC, SYS, and S16 programs.
     * Print TXT or AWP (AppleWorks Word Processor) files.
     * Display TXT or AWP files on-screen.

     "Sneeze can also scan through a text file for a word or phrase.  If 
you press <S> (to scan the highlighted file) or OpenApple-S (to scan ALL 
the text files in the current folder), you will be prompted for the word or 
phrase to search for.  Sneeze will then start 'flipping through' the text 
file(s), and will stop if it finds the string of characters you entered. 
This search is not case-sensitive.  If you want to abort a long scan, press 
OpenApple-<esc>.

     "Double-sided pages:  If you like, you can have Sneeze print out a 
file using both sides of each page.  Answer 'Y' at this prompt in the 
Printer Options screen, and begin the printing.  Sneeze will first print 
only the odd-numbered pages of the file; then it will prompt you to 
'Remove, reverse and restart paper'.  This means to remove the printed 
paper, turn it over, and reinsert it into the printer.  Sneeze will then 
print the even-numbered pages.  Thus, page 2 will be printed on the back of 
page 1, page 4 on the back of page 3, and so on.  This option assumes you 
are using fanfold computer paper.

     "Sneeze can display the following types of graphics files:  Hi-res, 
Double Hi-res (DazzleDraw type), unpacked Super Hi-res (shown as filetype 
PIC), BINary SHR, Apple Preferred Format SHR, PaintWorks format SHR (both 
shown as PNT), BINary '.3200' graphics, PIC (unpacked) 3200, and PNT 
(packed) 3200.  The IIgs-specific types can only be displayed on a IIgs.  
With Apple Preferred Format graphics that are two screens tall, you can see 
the lower half of the image by pressing the down-arrow key while the 
graphic is on screen.

     "Not all files listed as PIC or PNT are actually any of the types 
supported by Sneeze, so you may occasionally see an 'Unsupported graphic 
file format' message when you try to view SHR graphics."

     If you don't have Sneeze, get it.  If you have it, get it out and 
read the documentation again (for the first time?).  It may surprise you 
what a jewel you have.

      SEPIA.IZER.BXY   File #16262   6528 bytes   Gray-Scale to Sepia
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                         Sepia-izer by Karl Bunker
                             freeware software


     Here is another jewel by Karl Bunker.  I'll let him tell you about it 
in his own words.  The following is lifted from the docs file that is 
included with the download.

     "Lots of IIgs graphics, especially scanned-in images, are gray scale.
With 16 shades of gray, a reasonable degree of photographic clarity can be
achieved on the GS.  However, gray scale is kind of -- well -- gray.  Sepia
tone is often a much more aesthetically pleasant palette, while retaining
all the clarity of gray scale.  For those who may not know, sepia tone
refers to a range of brownish tones, from almost black to almost white.
Many early photographs were sepia tone, rather than black and white.
Personally, I like sepia tone a lot.

     "Sepia-izer is a method of converting gray scale graphics to
sepia tone.  Sepia-izer will take any PIC or Apple Preferred Format PNT
file, and convert the palette of the graphic to sepia tone.  To use
Sepia-izer, simply launch it, and select a file from the list displayed.
Prompts explain how to navigate to the disk and folder your graphics are
in.  The file SF.GET must be in the same folder that SEPIA.IZER is in when
you launch it.

     "Sepia-izer is dangerous if misused.  It alters your original graphic
file, rather than creating a new graphic, so be sure your file isn't
irreplaceable.  If the original graphic was not, in fact, a gray scale
graphic, the result will be a mess.  Sepia-izer only works on Apple
Preferred Format PNT files and SHR image PIC files."

     If you remember to heed Karl's warning, and be sure you are working 
on a copy of your original graphic, then I think you will be pleased with 
the results.  I tried it on several different gray-scale graphics and each 
one was improved by the process.

      SF.GET.BXY       File #19580   8704 bytes     Applesoft utility
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                           SF.Get by Karl Bunker
                   freeware Applesoft Ampersand routine


     SF.Get, mentioned in the previous review, is for Applesoft 
programmers.  If you know nothing about programming, you probably won't be 
interested in it.  In his documentation that is included with the file, 
Karl describes it this way:

     "SF.Get is an ampersand utility which brings a rough equivalent of 
the IIgs SFGetFile toolbox call to Applesoft programmers.  What this means 
is that when an Applesoft program requires users to provide the ProDOS 
pathname of some file for some reason, there is now a simple Applesoft 
command which allows them to do so in an EXTREMELY friendly environment.

     "Rather than having to remember-and-type a file's pathname, SF.Get 
allows users to point-and-click the file from an on-screen list.  If the 
desired file is in another directory or on another disk, it can be 
navigated to with a few keystrokes.

     "The potential benefits of SF.Get should be obvious.  Many Applesoft 
programs, from the most elaborate application to the smallest "quick and 
dirty" utility, could be improved with SF.Get.  SF.Get runs on any 
MouseText-capable Apple with 80 column display.  SF.Get is freeware, and is 
hereby made freely available for all developers to use in their own 
programs, either commercial or freeware."

     The download includes the ampersand routine itself, the documentation 
file, and a sample BASIC program that demonstrates how it works.

      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                        File.Compare by Karl Bunker
                     freeware file comparison utility


     Have you ever discovered two copies of a file and wondered if one was 
just a backup of the other?  I know I have.  Karl Bunker has created this 
utility for us.

     As Karl says in the documentation file, "File.Compare is a utility 
for comparing files (Wow! No kiddin'!).  There are a bunch of reasons for 
comparing files.  You might want to do this to see whether one file is 
simply a backup of another, or is a modified version.  You might know that 
two files are different, but be curious as to just what and where the 
difference is.  If you're a programmer who often writes various types of 
file-processing utilities (like me), you might want to compare some files 
to see if your program is working as it ought."

     File.Compare requires an enhanced IIe or later Apple II.  It will 
display the results in either hexadecimal or in text format.  Whether you 
simply need to compare two text files for differences or want to take a 
detailed look at your own programs, this is a useful utility.

                         public domain lo-res game


     This is an enhanced version of InternaMaze which was first created by 
Dennis G. Ward and then converted to Applesoft by Bill Fortenberry and 
uploaded as file #1298 in 1987.  I have taken the liberty of making some 
modifications in it to make it more user-friendly.  This version adds the 
use of lowercase letters and the arrow keys to move though the maze. It 
also gives you a proper way to exit the program prematurely by pressing the 
escape key. For more information about it, see the April '94 GEnieLamp A2 
in the Treasure Hunt column.  This continues to be public domain.  Enjoy!

                              The Guillotine
                            public domain game


     This is another older file that I have tried to update and make more 
user-friendly.  Originally titled THE GALLOWS (file #1612, reviewed in the 
April '94 GEnieLamp A2 Treasure Hunt column), it was written by Douglas 
Konitzer and uploaded on March 29, 1987.  It requires an 80 column display.

     This "word guess" program displays a guillotine which lowers each 
time that you select an incorrect letter.  Like most games of this type, 
you are shown a list of the letters that you have selected.  The program 
also tells you whether the word is a person, place, or thing.  It comes 
with a supply of words, but it is fairly easy to change them or add 
additional ones.  The words can be up to 18 letters in length.

     This version fixes a few problems.  It can now tell the difference 
between lowercase and uppercase input, which was a problem before.  It also 
now correctly refers to the instrument of doom as a guillotine rather than 
a gallows.  Most importantly, it is now accompanied with a utility program 
that allows you to input and/or change the words that are used in the game.

     Try it out, I think you'll like it. :)

                  Computer Terms Quiz by Charles Hartley
                               public domain

     This is a little something that I put together to use with my 
computer classes several years ago.  Essentially what it does is let you 
take quizzes on two different sets of computer terms.  It is set up in a 
matching format, that is all of the terms are displayed on the screen and 
the definition to match is displayed at the bottom.  You use the arrow keys 
to move the cursor to the correct term and then press return.  The term is 
then marked as either correct or incorrect.

     Once you finish the quiz, the program displays for you all the terms 
that you did not know along with their definitions.  Then it returns you to 
the menu where you can choose to take either test or quit.

     The program requires 80 column display.  Hope you enjoy it.

      BUNNY.GAME.BXY     File #17118     14336 bytes     Toddler game
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                           Gillian's Bunny Game
                               public domain


     In his long description of the upload, Dean Esmay said, "This game 
was written for a two-year-old.  Loosely based on the story of Peter 
Rabbit, it helps teach keyboarding skills, but is mostly just for fun.  The 
program uses graphics and sound as the player tries to help the rabbit get 
carrots and avoid the farmer.  A doc file is included describing how the 
program works.  Originally uploaded by T.DAWSON, this has been re-uploaded 
to conform to the .BXY standard to save space and alleviate confusion.  No 
other changes have been made."

     In his documentation file that accompanies the program, Gillian's dad 
said, "Toddlers constantly challenge themselves; they want to feel grown up 
and share adult experiences.  Any parent using a computer sees a lot of 
this.  So it is that an aspiring programmer and a two-year-old daughter are 
a combination that can lead to only one thing: late night sessions at the 
Apple as Dad tries to come up with software that will be enjoyable and 
challenging for his child."

     I think it is safe to say that Mr. Dawson has succeeded. :)  This 
rather simple game is the kind of stuff that we should see more of for the 
8 bit Apples.

     Mr. Dawson goes on to say, "I wanted to give my daughter a program 
that would contain the positive elements which attracted her, ... the sense 
of accomplishment for moving an object around on the screen, and pride in 
using the computer.  I wanted to create a game that could challenge yet be 
easily mastered by a two-year-old, giving positive feedback while 
minimizing frustrating elements and mistakes.  GILLIAN'S BUNNY GAME was the 
result.

     "Requiring only the use of the arrow keys on a IIe or IIc, or the 
I-J-K-M keys on a II+, it is easy for a small child to play and needs only 
minimal assistance from a parent to start.  Once your child is familiar 
with the game, she or he can readily run the entire program, start to 
finish."

     Not only has Mr. Dawson provided us with a neat game for very young 
children, he has also provided much information in the documentation file 
to assist anyone who might be interested in learning how the program works 
from a programming point of view.

     If you have a toddler, get this program and check it out.


                                 [*][*][*]

     That's it for this month.  I hope you have found something here to 
whet your interest.  Drop me a line and let me know what you think of this 
column and offer any suggestions you might have about what should be in it.


     Until next time, happy downloading!

      pursuing publication of their work electronically on GEnie or via 
      disk-based media.  For those looking for online publications, the 
      DigiPub Software Libraries offer online magazines, newsletters, 
      short-stories, poetry and other various text oriented articles for 
      downloading to your computer.  Also available are writers' tools and

      the DigiPub Bulletin Board you can converse with people in the 
      digital publishing industry, meet editors from some of the top 
      electronic publications and get hints and tips on how to go about 
      publishing your own digital book.  The DigiPub RoundTable is the
