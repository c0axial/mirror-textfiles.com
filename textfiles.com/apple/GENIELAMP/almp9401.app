                      >>> A MIND FOREVER FORAGING <<<
                      """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The tale had a familiar theme, but it still unnerved me.

     Tim Rogentine was regaling the denizens of GEnie's A2 RoundTable with 
the story of an acquaintance planning to buy a new computer.  Mr Rogentine 
mentioned the Apple II to this acquaintance, who responded with derisive 
laughter.

     "Do you know anything about them?" he asked.

     "Enough not to get one!" was the reply.

     "I know enough not to need to know any more" is a phrase that scares 
the willies out of me.  It's the beginning of prejudice.

     Mr Rogentine's story has a happy ending, for his acquaintance was 
reasonable enough to allow him to demonstrate what an Apple IIgs can do, 
and open-minded enough to be impressed by it.  Occasionally, though, you 
come up against someone incapable of understanding the difference between 
making up one's mind and closing it.  

     One of my first lessons in keeping an open mind came from a digital 
watch.

     When I was in high school, my best friend and I both thought the
digital watch was a pretty neat idea.  However, my best friend preferred
an LCD (liquid-crystal digital) display similar to the type now found on
solar-power calculators, while I had nothing but scorn for anything but an
LED (light-emitting diode) display of the sort that now graces our VCR and
microwave oven.  After some good-natured but heartfelt debate, we
approached Mr Hicks, a teacher whose opinion we both respected, and laid
the matter before him.

     "Which of the two do you prefer?" we asked.

     I was confident of a judgment in my favor, a victory.  I knew I had 
right on my side.

     "Oh, a liquid-crystal display," Mr Hicks smiled at both of us.

     I was sure he had overlooked the ultimate advantage of the LED
display.  "But with LED, you can check the time in the middle of the
night!" I insisted.  (For younger readers:  LCD watches have not always
featured a night light.)

     "Yes, of course," Mr Hicks acknowledged.  "That's why I have that sort
of alarm clock.  But not on my wristwatch."

     Before I could rally from my shock and offer a rebuttal (which ran, I
believe, "Er--"), Mr Hicks distributed another of his all-friends-here
smiles and closed the discussion by leaving us.

     I had invested too much emotional energy in my watch to abandon it on
the spot; however, some years later I returned to a more traditional watch
with a dial face that showed time as a kind of distance instead of a
collection of numbers.  It took a while, but I had learned a valuable
lesson about the way people think when they are convinced they are on the
side of the angels.

     Such people make up their minds -- and then they close them.

     Worse still are those who close their minds on the assumption that
they have all the facts.  Opinions of one's friends are not facts.  One
_own_ opinions are not facts.  In short:  opinion, no matter how widely
held, is never fact.

     Apple II users are accustomed to those who only know enough not to
want to know any more.  Occasionally we even find ourselves dismissing the
competition without examining it.  Or perhaps we perform a grudging
examination of the alternatives, paying lip-service to the idea of being
open-minded, while determined to remain convinced that the Apple II is
superior.  "We'll give 'em a fair trial... and then we'll find 'em
guilty!" It doesn't matter what your position is -- closing your mind will
weaken it.

     My Apple IIgs can't do everything, but it does do everything I need it
to, and more.  This doesn't mean I refuse to recognize the utility of other
computers; there are indeed tasks currently beyond the capacity of my IIgs.

     However, here's the nub:  I don't need to do any of those things!

     Many years ago, when computers were just starting to become popular
acquisitions, I was given sage advice:  counter sales talk of what a
computer can _do_ by reminding yourself what you was _need_ it to do.  For
some reason, people seem eager to persuade themselves that they need
something they didn't know existed a minute before.  Built-in animation
may be impressive, but not terribly useful if you use your computer for
word processing and telecommunications.  Only once in my life have I need a
full-featured desktop publishing program... and that was when I was
working for a book publisher.

     The responsibility of keeping an open mind involves a lot more work
than making a decision and sticking to it, come hell or high water... and
of course, there are times when sticking to your decision is the Right
Thing.  But closing your mind isn't, not ever.

     Once when I was in England, I saw a poster advertising beer which
simply consisted of the brand name and the slogan "I haven't tried it
because I don't like it".  I chuckled appreciatively.

     That was many years ago... when I was still wearing a digital watch. 


                                 [*][*][*]

     One or two ancillary matters to deal with before I let you loose on 
this month's issue.

     First, we love for you to reprint GEnieLamp articles in your
non-profit newsletters, but do be aware that you're required to give us
credit.  I read a lot of Apple II user-group newsletters and magazines,
and most are scrupulous about giving credit where credit is due.  Last
month, though, I noted with some dismay that one editor had reproduced an
article by Darrel Raines and neither mentioned its source nor printed the
copyright information.  Please... if you reprint us, give us credit.  See
the end of any issue of GEnieLamp for further information.

     Second, thanks to Peter J. Paul for responding to the November 1993
plea of Steven Weyhrich, Apple II historian, for a copy of _Fire in the
Valley_.  Thanks also to Dan Cross, who also offered a copy.

     [Apple Users Conference #5]
     [303/307]
     From   : Lance Taylor-Warren
     To     : All
     Subject: Carry on a Apple II Software tradition...
     Date   : 29 Nov 93  16:00

          Have I got a deal for you...

          Have you ever wanted to be your own boss?  Have you often 
     thought about writing your own BBS Program?  Now is your chance 
     to do both. I have the following for sale:

     1 - Apple IIgs ROM 03, RGB Monitor, Extended Keyboard (5mb RAM)
     1 - Apple IIgs ROM 01, Green Screen, Regular Keyboard (1.5mb+Ram)
     1 - 3.5" drive
     1 - 5.25" drive
     2 - 5.25" drives (w/ controller)
     2 - ZipGS Accelerators (8mhz & 9mhz)
     1 - Apple SCSI card1 - RAMFast SCSI card (rev c)
     1 - Seagate 43mb Hard Drive
     1 - Quantum 80mb Hard Drive
     1 - Stereo Card for GS
     1 - ProDEV DDT 16 Debugging board

          And the icing on the offer, all the source code and commercial
     distribution rights for GBBS Pro (Both ProDOS and DOS 3.3 versions)
     and the source code and distribution rights for LLUCE as it stands
     today. This means you will fully own BOTH products. I will also
     include EVERYTHING I have Apple II related.  The systems will include
     everything on the hard drives.  All the sources and other development
     stuff as well as the DPS Support BBS as it is the day of the sale.
     Also included is the index cards of all known registered owners of
     GBBS Pro.

          As you have by most likely figured out, I'm selling all my Apple
     II stuff in hopes that someone out there has the time and the
     motivation to finish LLUCE and make a run for the market that's out
     there for it.  I'm tired of looking at it and would love to see
     someone else run with it.

          Our projected marketing figures for LLUCE show that is has the
     potential to make well over $100,000 once it's done.  All that is
     really left to finish is the docs and the installation/configure
     program. Once someone has come up to speed on how things are setup,
     you could have a new BBS product within a month. With the rapidly
     declining prices of Apple II equipment it becomes an even better
     platform to use as a base for a BBS.  Why tie up a Mac or a IBM to use
     as a BBS with that Apple II sitting in the corner collecting dust is
     just perfect for the task. So now the BIG question...

          How much do I want for everything listed above? Well, even tho
     it's worth well over $20,000.  I'm willing to let it go at a fraction
     of that price to the right person. If you are interested, please
     contact me at 702-322-5533 or via the following e-mail address,
     Internet: lance@dps.com, Fidonet 1:213/312 or 1:213/0.

     My comments?  I'm not sure how he was expecting to make $100,000 off
it with METAL being freeware...  if it was going to make that much, why
didn't he finish it?  But then who knows...

TRIVIA DROPS TEXT MODE   I would like to know how the TRIVIA board can get
""""""""""""""""""""""   away with kicking all Apple users off of TRIVIA? 
TRIVIA no longer plays in TEXT format and they do not offer front end 
graphic software for the Apple users IIE, IIC, or GS. They decided a couple 
of weeks ago to stop playing in TEXT mode. I complained in an e-mail to the 
Trivia feed back, and I will admit I called them Creeps for doing it but 
that was after I spoke with customer service and they said they could do 
nothing about it. The answer back to me was that they would not put text 
format back and that my system was obsolete and I should buy a new one. 
That they are not responsible for people who insist on keeping obsolete 
systems. WRONG THING TO SAY TO AN APPLE USER!. They even informed me I 
could buy inexpensive equipment from them. I think that the answer stunk 
and I almost dropped Geanie services. I decided to give it another month 
because Gene from the round table was supposed to get back with me, but I 
have not heard anything. Another person is now investigating, I think her 
name is Pat (I forgot to write it down). I really enjoyed playing trivia
and had friends that played there. It really isn't fair that TRIVIA is
allowed to disciminate like this. Please, the powers that be, consider
putting back Text mode or giving the Apple IIE & C, C+ & GS users front end
graphic software so we can fully enjoy ALL of Geanies services.

>>>>>   There are a few multi-player GEnie games that require graphic front
"""""   ends where none are available for the Apple II (Air Warrior and 
BattleTech, I think.)  But this is the first I've seen of a current game 
that actually removed a text version for no apparent reason.

     Most of the games have graphic front ends, but for the most part they 
aren't required.  I can't think of a reason why Trivia can't be played in 
straight text unless they've made some major changes.

     Why the folks who run NTN Trivia are doing this is beyond me.  I'm
offended by the "obsolete computer" line myself.

     One of the things we have trouble making people understand is that on
GEnie, different people run different areas.  We who run the A2 RTs have
nothing to do at all with the people who run NTN Trivia.  What they say
does not go for us, and vice-versa.

     I will have a word with them about their choice of language.  I can't
argue with them about their software choices; apparently they feel that
the changes they're making to their own software makes an ASCII version
undoable.  I can't argue with them about that because I'm not a
programmer.  But I WILL speak to them about their attitude.

EASTER EGG IN QUICKIE   Has anyone else found Quickie's Easter Egg? <G>
"""""""""""""""""""""   I'm using v3.1 so I'm not sure if it works with

APPLEWORKS QUICK-DELETE FOR FILES   Tonight I inadvertantly discovered
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   "expert" mode while in the file-delete 
operations. Which is to say I pressed OA-Return while a file was 
highlighted. I saw the hard drive light flash, suspected the worst and 
immediately exited to ProSel and launched the exhume utility --  which, 
thank Glen Bredon, salvaged a file that had several hours of work in it.

DESKJET OR DESKWRITER   Not quite the ONLY difference.  The DeskWriter's
"""""""""""""""""""""   serial port only speaks at a high baud rate 
(56.6k?) meaning you need a special high-speed serial driver to use it on a 
IIGS.  Also, the DeskWriter has AppleTalk capability built in (although you 
need a Mac to use this; there are no AppleTalk DeskWriter drivers for the 
IIGS).  The DeskJet has a parallel interface (in addition to its serial 
interface) while the DeskWriter only has the serial/AppleTalk interface 
(it's one port).  Finally, the DeskWriter comes with Mac drivers while the 
DeskJet does not (may come with Windows drivers; dunno).

                            or which have drivers (Publish It, AppleWorks)

PICKFONTS WORK-AROUND   Pickfonts is not compatible with AppleWorks 4.0.
"""""""""""""""""""""   I would assume that it will be updated.  In the 
meantime, a good workaround is to create a database with three catagories.  
(Font name, recno, and font code)

     Place the following formula in the recno field.

          @currecno (check the oa-f to be sure I've got it right)

     Then put this formula in the font code field.

          @join("<",[recno],"=",[font name],">")

     Insert enough blank records to hold your fonts.

     for all the fonts that reside in the superfonts standard directory, 
type it's name into the font name field.  ex courier.12, courier.10...

     If the font resides elsewhere, type the full pathname.  ex 
/q1/system/fonts/new.york.24

     When the file is complete, save it as Superfonts in an easy accessble 
directory.

     Create a glossary in the word processor that lists the font name and 
returns the font code followed by a <rtn>.

     There you have it.  Pickfonts.  You will need to have the database on 
your desktop when you plan to use superfonts.

WHO KILLED THE ROM 04 IIGS?   One reason Apple supported the II as long as
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   they did was that there were some VERY loyal 
people at Apple that still believed in the II -- they just happened to be 
in the minority and weren't the ultimate decision makers.

nothing to give it up.  (They are saving enough in tech support staff and 
getting enough in royalties to make it worth their while.)  The fact that 
we are selling AppleWorks does not compete with Claris in any way; if it

AUCTION REPORTS   I know there is supposed to be a place to put

if this message needs to be moved, please do so.

     I want to let everyone who might be attending any future Apple

makes not sense bidding up for items because then everyone pays a higher
price.

     They had other a few other items but I was unable to get those prices.
These were the prices for individual units.  The prices when sold in lots
of 10 or more were lower. I was going to buy the CD Rom drive but two
people told me that the price was too high by about $50.  Given some of the
bidding I saw and the prices, I wonder if Apple or the auction company had
some plants.  I saw a few people who keep their cards up on a lot of items
until the price got to a certain point then never bid on the item again and
did not take any items.  Wierd!

     Sorry for the long message but I wanted to let people who were
planning on attending any future Apple auctions to know what the going
prices were, at least in New England.  (RON.ROYER, CAT2, TOP4,

     I missed a couple of prices here than there that's why the blanks.
The kidneys only last so long.  Also the back in those fold up chairs.

     My feeling was about the best price you were going to get was
wholesale. There was quite a few dealers there and if the prices were to
low they would keep bidding because it was a real good buy and where
trying to get the merchandise for there business.  Once the price was no
long attractive the buyers would stop buying and the general public took
over.  There was around 4,000 bidders there.

     A good example of this was the MAC Classic at $425.  Normally with the
price was in the $500 range and a lot of different people bought them at
this price.  But the classic was bid on right after a comment from the
Ross-Davis people that no one was bidding up prices and they didn't care
what the prices were.  This was in a direct response to a flyer passed
around saying Ros-Davis was trying to artificially inflate the prices
either in their own interests or Apple's interest.  (I don't feel that was
happening)  The bid on the Classic stopped at $425 and everyone was all
set to get a great price, but low and behold when the auctioneer asked the
high bidder how many machines he wanted the bidder replied "all of them".
No doubt a buyer who also knew a good price.

     I think the individual buyer some times got caught up in the heat of
the auction and where not using there head.  A lot of the time there were
hundreds of the items being bid and the price was bid to high by some one
and there ended up only be a few items sold and the rest ended up being
sold in large lots.  Also people had there minds set on a particular
product and paid the price.

     I sat next to a guy who wanted a Quadra but he had gotten a quote from
a local dealer several hundred dollars less than what the machines went
for.

     Probably on the best bargains were the GS's.  It was a Rom 3 machine
with keyboard, mouse, monitor AND they were giving you a Super drive for
the 3.5" drive (no 5 1/4).  If I had known they were giving the super
drive I would have bought a couple more than the one I did buy.  Parts
alone are worth a couple hundred dollars more than that.  Live and learn.

     All in all it was an interesting experience.  I bought another GS, a
Mac IIvx and a cd rom player.  I was happy with what I paid and got, just
wish I had bought a couple more GS's.  I'd have my own network in the
house. Now I have to figure out how to network the ones I have.

      NAUG's BBS (1-615-359-8238)
      Quality Computers' BBS (1-313-774-2652)

     I wrote him a letter, but not to ask him to reconsider or to ask him
why. Whether his program is on GEnie or not is none of my business or
concern. I did ask about some personal business, then lamented the lack of
DeskJet documentation on the AppleWorks 4.0 disk. In case anyone has been
on another planet, the reason we now have DeskJet Drivers built in to
AppleWorks 4.0 is thanks to John Link. The reason we don't know how to use
them is because nobody thought to include documentation other than the
Ctrl-A and other commands added by Randy.

APPLEWORKS 4.01 UPDATES GOOF   <Sigh>  Apparently, in the fray of stuffing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   all of those little white mailers, we ran 
out of disks and one of the assembly line folks ran back to the duplicator 
for a new set of disks.  Sadly, they must have picked up a box slated for 
re-duplication that contained v. 4.0 instead of the newly duplicated 4.01 
disks.  We think this only affects a small number of the updates sent out.   
                              
     It would help us out a lot if any of you could report the version 
number of AppleWorks that you get when you get this update.  It comes in a 
small white mailer, and it should arrive at your doors anytime from today 
till mid next week.  

     Needless to say, we extend our apologies for the mixup.

RECORDING MACROS IN AW4   Three or so people have mentioned limited
"""""""""""""""""""""""   recording. As Steve pointed out, that's because 
you're using the default set, which only has a handful of bytes free, 
thanks to Steve packing it full of features. You can remove the macros you 
don't need and then recompile and resave the default to leave free space, 
or if you just want easy playback of temporary keys, use macro 0.

     The reason you can't use OA-X to replace an existing macro is because 
of the way commands like "next", "rpt" and "()x" work. This change was made 
in AW 3 with Ultra 4 to allow maximum speed and to eliminate the old 
problems with some "bad" numbers causing problems inside of loops. You can 
record over any temporary recorded macros, but macros which were compiled 
and are part of the set can't be replaced by OA-X.

SPECTRUM SHIPS!   Spectrum is a new graphics-based telecommunications
"""""""""""""""   program written specifically for the Apple IIgs.  It uses 
the standard Apple IIgs "desktop interface" so it's easy to learn and use.  
And you don't need to sacrifice speed or features.

     Spectrum supports baud rates from 50 to 57,600 and includes many file 
transfer  protocols (including Zmodem and CompuServe B+, both of which 
support auto- receiving and auto-resuming interrupted file transfers).

     A powerful, yet easy to use, scripting language lets Spectrum be 
tailored specifically for individual use.  Scripts can do almost anything, 
ranging from  emulating a bulletin board to the daily automatic logging, 
sending and retrieving of mail.

     A rich text editor is built-in for convenience (supports text, 
TeachText, and  AppleWorks Classic file formats).

     Spectrum requires System 6.0 (or later) and is compatible with The 
Manager v1.1 (not available yet).

     The retail price of Spectrum is $129.95.

Special Introductory Offer   Through January 31, 1994 Spectrum is available
''''''''''''''''''''''''''   at the VERY special introductory price of only 
$50 plus $3.50 shipping and handling.  To order call 904-575-0566, M-F, 9-5

<<<<<   ARRRRGGG!   Well, after creating the master Spectrum disks we did a
"""""   test Install to make sure the Installer scripts were working right. 
Sure enough they  did and SP ran on our system. HOWEVER, our system already 
had a  required file installed...Spectrum REQUIRES the "Hierarchic" INIT, 
but  this file was overlooked in our installation scripts, and it is not  
included on either Spectrum disk.

SO, unless you already have Hierarchic (from owning Kangaroo, TransProg, 
The Manager, or Super Menu Pack) this means you will not be able to run 
Spectrum until you get Hierarchic. :( I will upload a copy of Hierarchic 
into the A2 libraries and post the file number when I do. In the  meantime 
you can download Hierarchic (along with some extra tech info)  from the 
A2Pro library:

  Type: M530;3 (A2Pro software library)
  Then select option 6 (download a file)
  Then specify file number 3552

I really apologize for this major oversight.

Thanks, --Dave

P.S. All disks shipped on 12/17/93 or later have this problem corrected.

DANGEROUS BUG CONFIRMED IN HARDPRESSED   There have been a few (two or
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   three) cases where somebody has 
reported that HardPressed + LZSS has flat-out trashed their files.  I've 
gone around in circles trying to duplicate it, but wasn't able to.

     Well, finally somebody determined that if you use a profile that 
compresses everything with the unlikely combination of differential + LZSS 
+ adaptive Huffman (supposedly great for MODs), compressing and 
uncompressing the same file a couple of times will leave you with a hosed 
file.  Guess what, I made it happen. :-(

     The fix required is a replacement LZSS module, which I will upload as 
soon as I verify that I haven't introduced any new problems.  I'll be 
sending a copy of it immediately to everybody who has had problems with it 
before (assuming I still have their e-mail addresses), so they can verify 
that the problems are gone.

     In the mean time, turn "verify" on.  It WILL catch any problems with 
LZSS trashing a file.  The nature of the bug is such that, if you haven't 
seen any problems before now, you probably won't, but there's no telling 
whether adding a new INIT to the system will shift things around enough. 
The bug has been in there since HP v1.0, and VERY few people have reported 
problems.

     I'm glad we finally got this one... I've been worried about these 
mysterious file trashings.

NEW COPILOT SCRIPTS BEGIN _SERIOUS_ BETA   Okay, it's time for plan B.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The ProTerm scripts, while very CLOSE to being ready, just won't be 
in shape for a 12/22 release.

     The modified Installer (to handle Spectrum) is ready, but has not had 
ANY Beta testing, which makes it a very iffy proposition to haul off and 
attempt to produce a new version of CoPilot based on it by 12/22.

     SO, here is what we are going to do.

     On 12/22 I will upload the new scripts for TIC and Spectrum, complete 
with all files needed to run Spectrum/CoPilot as an OPEN BETA. That means 
that we have already run a Beta cycle, and things look pretty good, but we 
are going to use y'all for guinea pigs for a couple of weeks.

     The new PT scripts will also go up, with installation instructions, 
as Open Beta, as soon as they are ready. (Very soon, but NOT on 12/22.)

     After those of you who choose to download them and use them for a 
couple of weeks, and after we have thoroughly tested the other stuff we 
need to include, we will THEN put together a new release of CoPilot.

     This will allow us to put out a better product in the long run.

     Those of you who don't HAVE CoPilot should hold off for a few weeks 
longer and download the new version when we have it all complete. (That is 
a VERY strong suggestion...)

     Those of you who are getting Spectrum, and want to use it with 
CoPilot, will need to download CoPilot and install it for use with TIC, 
then download the new Spectrum scripts and install them over the files you 
just installed. I'll give instructions here for anyone who needs thme.

HARDWARE MYSTERY UNDER WRAPS   Joachim Lange (J.Lange7) of SHH Systeme has
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   contacted me to handle doing some beta 
testing of a new peripheral for the Apple //e and //GS that is in the final 
phases of development. I now know exactly what this product is, and what 
hardware it supports (and is capable of supporting). There isn't (to my 
knowledge) any product currently available for the Apple // series that 
does what this card does, or even comes close to it. I believe that it will 
be of great use to many Apple //e and //GS users (myself included) once it 
has passed some further real world testing and has had some further 
development work done on the associated driver code (which exists but needs 
some minor work done to fully support the capabilities of the hardware). I 
expect to have a beta revision of this hardware in my hands soon, along 
with the source code for the drivers. When this "vaporware" is firmly in my 
hands (err... in my //GS :), I'll post a message confirming it's arrival.

     The existing GS hardware permits at least a 3-node BBS:  two incoming 
data lines and one local login.  When my GS was at 8 MHz, it handled a 
simultaneous console login and dialup login at 2400 bps very easily.  I 
doubt that a second 2400 dialup would affect performance noticeably.  The 
GNO serial drivers are quite efficient, so I would be interested in seeing 
how fast I push both serial ports at the same time, while logged in myself.

IIGS STEREO GIZMO   I'm wondering...
"""""""""""""""""   How many people here would be intrested in an
inexpensive (under $30.00 + shipping) gizmo that would provide two (stereo)
"line level" outputs from the GS?

     This would require an external amplifier and speakers (or cables to
your stereo system) to complete the setup. Absolutely no adjustments,
simply plug it onto the Molex connector (next to the Ensoniqs chip) and
hook up the cables.

     If only so-so intrested, say so here, if _really_ intrested, and 
willing to commit to a purchase, say so in e-mail. If enough people commit 
to purchase, I'll start making them. (NO up-front money is being asked 
for!)

     If a "poor mans digitizer" is also desired, I can add that to the

     I've suggested this to Quality Computers and I'll suggest it here:  I
think  we're all miss the bulk of current Apple II users.....teachers.  I
don't  think most subscribe to on-line services or Apple magazines and
newsletters.  I don't think they know the rest of us exist, or that there
is any place to buy anything for the Apple II's any more.  Every classroom
in my sons' elementary school has a IIe; none of their teachers yet has
known where she can get software.

     So, if I were promoting an Apple II publication or service, I'd
advertise and publicize in teachers' publications.  There are two national
unions (the National Education Association and the American Federation of
Teachers), and I'm sure each has its own publication for its members.  Most
stations have a state union (a branch of NEA, probably), and each probably
has ITS own publication.  Then there are the local newsletters (where I
grew up, it was the "Ossining Teachers Association.")  And of course
professional journals.

     What this means is that an advertiser like Joe (or QC or anyone else)
could start with some of the smaller, cheaper publications and build up to
the bigger ones.  Publication advertising is usually less expensive than
direct mail.

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

            >>> SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT TELECOM TRAINING CENTERS <<<
            """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Our society values learning enough that we spend 200 billion dollars
each year on our public school system.  Likewise, in the interest of
promoting learning, we subsidize a large and robust public library system.

     As we walk through the portals of the information age, thoughtful
people have been spending time thinking about the role that government and
industry can play in helping bring more of our nation's population online.
What types of social institutions can we construct that can help people
learn how to use communications software?  Learn how to use bulletin
boards?  Learn how to use the national information services?  And learn
how to use the Internet?

     Currently, just a small fraction of the nation's population is
online.  This fact is drive home by considering that fewer than 10 percent
of all home computers are connected to a modem.  Furthermore, market
studies have shown that the penetration of personal computers in the home
is approximately 35 percent of the nation's households.  Taking one tenth
of 35 percent yields a paltry 3.5 percent.

     The bare truth is that the vast majority of the nation's population
is not yet online.  It behooves the nation as a whole to work vigorously to
train our fellow citizens in basic telecommunications skills.  The more
people that can be reached online, the more each one of us can benefit
from communicating with them.

     I can recall distinctly my own first faltering forays into the online
world.  A leader in my local user group, Ken DeVito, spoke in an animated
voice about connecting up his computer to the online networks.  This kind
fellow generously offered to take phone calls at his house to help people
get connected up themselves.

     After buying a modem and communications software, I hesitantly called 
Ken at his home.  Having heard that telecommunications can be a complicated 
subject I went out of my way making sure I had my modem and communications 
software all set up correctly.  Cautiously, timidly, I made my first phone 
call.  Lo and behold, the word CONNECT bounced up onto my screen.

     I imagine that most of us who are already online had similar help and 
encouragement from friends and colleagues the first few times we went 
online.  That type of informal learning was fine in the 1980s when online 
communications was largely the province of computer hobbyists.  But as we 
plunge headlong into the information age, the time is long overdue for our 
society to set up more formal channels for teaching online communications 
skills.  We cannot continue to rely on the goodwill of the Ken DeVitos of 
the world to help everyone get connected.

     What existing social institutions are best suited to take up this 
task?  Schools, for sure, can help train our younger population.  User 
groups, certainly, can help give online demonstrations and tutorials at 
their meetings.

     But neither schools nor user groups are equipped to handle the huge 
numbers of people we need to train.  The most suitable social institution 
to help train our nation's populace is public libraries.

     Public libraries already have a mandate to promote the dissemination 
of knowledge and information.  Calling upon our libraries to help train our 
nation in online skills makes even more sense when you consider the great 
overlap between basic telecommunications skills and basic research skills. 
The skills of searching and capturing information from an online database 
is closely parallel to the skills of searching and capturing information 
from a CD-ROM database.

     While public libraries serve as the perfect venue for training 
sessions in online communications skills, no one for a moment would think 
that libraries have the funds to initiate such services on their own.  What 
is obviously needed is a partnership between the private and public sectors 
to help bring telecommunications skills to the masses.

     Phone companies, naturally, can play an important role in giving 
reduced rates for the installation of new phone lines in libraries.  All 
that would be needed would be about eight to ten new phone lines for each 
library.  Computer manufacturers should obviously step forward to make 
donations of computer hardware for telecom training purposes.  These 
donated computers need not be an onerous expense since low-end computer 
systems work perfectly fine for telecommunications purposes.

     Modem manufacturers, obviously, have a social duty to make their 
immensely useful devices available for use at library training centers. 
Here again, the low-end slower modems serve eminently well for training 
purposes.

     It goes without saying that the national information services should 
step forward to donate accounts that could be used in training centers. 
Many of the national information services have probably already given 
thought to how they could help support publicly funded telecom training 
centers.

     Larger software publishers could step in to provide communications 
software and general financial support for the training centers.  Mitch 
Kapor, Steve Wozniak, and other luminaries in the computer world have 
already taken bold steps to promote social causes with the Electronic 
Freedom Foundation.  The participation and support of these luminaries 
would go far in making the training centers successful social institutions.

     Finally, the public sector can assist by providing tax incentives to 
the phone companies, computer companies, modem manufacturers, national 
information services, and software companies that donate in-kind goods or 
services to the telecom training center.  The public sector could also help 
with the issuance of "Online Citizen" certificates for those persons who 
show mastery of basic telecommunications skills.

     Few North Americans are aware that the public library systems in the 
United States and Canada are held up as model systems in other nations 
around the world.  Early in our two country's histories the people of our 
nations gave strong support to funding and promoting schools and libraries.

     For the good of our nations, we need to take the next step to help 
bring more of our citizens online.  The time for a public/private 
telecommunications skills initiative is long overdue.  For the good of our 
nations, we need to create social institutions that can take over the 
supportive role of those who helped get the first 3.5 percent of us online.

     After we're able to get the first 10 percent online, the momentum will 
be strong enough that we can pull another 50 percent online before the turn 
of the century.  And with 60 percent of the population online by the year 
2000, our countries will then be well positioned to move forward with the 
exciting possibilities of the information age.

STILL MORE CONTROL PANEL BASICS   Yes, we are STILL slogging our way
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   through the IIgs CDA Control Panel.  This 
month, as you look at ways to lose that holiday weight, pay those holiday 
bills, and shovel that holiday snow, why not take a break and join me as we 
learn about "Options" (ROM 01), or "Keyboard"/"Mouse" (ROM 03).  Scrape the 
ice off your monitor, and turn on that heater (this time of year it would 
probably be NICE to have a Pentium-based computer; they generate a LOT of 
heat... :-) )


KEYBOARD/OPTIONS   Here is another difference between the ROM 01 and ROM 03
""""""""""""""""   versions of the Apple IIgs.  At this point in the CDA 
Control Panel, the ROM 01 version is called "Options", and the ROM 03 
version is called "Keyboard".  They look something like this when you 
select them:

     (The "Double Click" and "High Speed Mouse" entries for the ROM 01 
version will be discussed below.)


Display Language/Keyboard Layout   The intent of the top two entries,
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Display Language and Keyboard Layout,
was to simplify the manufacture and use of the IIgs for foreign countries.
Older models of the Apple II would require a different character generator
chip for each country where it was sold, to account for local differences
in characters (for example, in Great Britain the character produced with a
Shift-3 was the British stylized "L", for "pound", whereas here in the
U.S.  Shift-3 produces an octothorpe, which looks like the tic-tac-toe
board).  Manufacturing and stocking all these different ROM chips increased
the cost of producing the computer.  To have it built into the IIgs,
selectable through this Control Panel, simplified things considerably.  A
separate keyboard is still necessary to be consistent with regional
differences around the world, and the Keyboard Layout needs to be adjusted
to match the type of keyboard that has been connected.  In any case, the
modular design of the IIgs still makes that easier than on previous models
of the Apple II.

     If you make changes in the Display Language you will see some unusual 
characters substituted for characters like "{", "\", and so on. For users 
in the U.S. this would be primarily a curiosity; however, if you are 
developing software that might be used by IIgs owners in other parts of the 
world, you should change the Display settings to ensure that you are not 
using some characters that will not show properly with other language 
layouts.  (AppleWorks, for instance, may not show proper screen characters 
with certain features when other Display Languages are selected).

     One of the other uses of the Keyboard Layout would be to change from 
the standard (also called "Sholes" or "QWERTY") keyboard to the Dvorak 
system.  This takes the arrangement of the letters on the keyboard and 
moves them into something that can be much faster to use--once you become 
accustomed to it.  All of the most frequently used characters in English 
are placed in the home row (where it currently holds "ASDFGH", etc.).  If 
you make this change and don't change the keycaps on the keyboard, you will 
find that typing a "D" causes an "E" to appear on the screen.

     I actually changed my Apple IIc keyboard layout years ago (via the 
"Keyboard" switch in the upper left corner) to the Dvorak layout, and used 
a typing program called MasterType to teach myself to use it.  And I do 
admit that my typing began to get faster and a little more accurate. 
However, using a Dvorak keyboard is like being left-handed in a 
right-handed world.  If the ONLY keyboard you are ever going to use is YOUR 
keyboard, you'll have no problems, once you get used to Dvorak.  But since 
there was a Dvorak keyboard at home, and a QWERTY keyboard at work, my 
brain became too confused to keep making the switches, and so I went back 
to the old standard.

     On the IIc it was not TOO much trouble to pop the caps off of all the 
keys and rearrange them into the Dvorak layout.  However, I've never tried 
this on my IIgs, and do not know how difficult it would be.  If you want to 
make this change, just be careful not to FORCE anything as you try to 
remove the keycaps.  If you break something, you'll probably have to pay 
SOMEONE to have it repaired (or replaced).


Keyboard Buffering   Keyboard buffering allows the user to continue typing
''''''''''''''''''   while the computer is busy doing something else, and 
will save up the keystrokes until the program running is again ready to 
accept them.  I have not personally seen that this works very well in the 
programs that I regularly use.  IBM-type computers seem to buffer up nearly 
EVERY keystroke that is entered, regardless of what else the system is 
doing.  If you know ahead of time which type of keystrokes will be needed 
to carry out a certain function, this can be a time saving feature. 
However, the IIgs buffer doesn't seem to be designed the same way, and you 
will just have to try it out yourself to see if having this turned on helps 
out in YOUR situation.


Repeat Speed/Repeat Delay   Repeat Speed and Repeat Delay refer to the
'''''''''''''''''''''''''   auto-repeat of keys pressed on the keyboard. On 
the Apple II Plus, a separate key was included on the keyboard to allow a 
key that was held down to repeat.  On the IIe and IIc, an AUTOMATIC repeat 
is built-in; if you press the "A" key and hold it down, it eventually 
begins to repeat and continues to do so until the key is released.  The 
IIgs does the same thing, but lets you modify it to suit your style.  The 
Repeat Speed is a relative measure of how fast the repeated keypresses are 
generated, and the Repeat Delay refers to how long a wait there is until a 
pressed key begins to repeat.  If you are a heavy-fingered typist and have 
the Repeat Delay turned down too low, you may find some accidental 
repeeeeeeeeetition of some keypresses.  If you don't like the default 
settings for these options, play with them until you find something more 
suitable.


Cursor Flash   This should be self-explanatory.  If that pulsating cursor
''''''''''''   is not at a speed that seems comfortable for you, use this 
to make it faster or slower.


Shift Caps/Lowercase   The various advanced features in this next section
''''''''''''''''''''   of the Control Panel are primarily for those who 
have become very accustomed to the feel of the keyboard, and want to work a 
bit faster.  Shift Caps/Lowercase changes the function of the Caps Lock key 
slightly.  When this feature is set to "No", the keyboard will generate 
uppercase letters when the either the Caps Lock key or the Shift key is 
down.  If this feature in the Control Panel is set to "Yes", the Caps Lock 
key will still cause letters on the keyboard to come out as uppercase; 
however, pressing the Shift key while the Caps Lock key is DOWN will cause 
letters to come out in lower case.  In other words, the Caps Lock key will 
now change the function of the Shift key--but for the letters A-Z ONLY. 
Other characters on the keyboard (such as numbers and the symbols on the 
number keys) will STILL require the Shift key be pressed to generate them.


Fast Space/Delete Keys, Dual Speed Keys   These features allows more rapid
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   movement of the cursor if the 
Control key is pressed along with certain other keys.  If Fast Space/Delete 
is set to "Yes", Ctrl-Delete causes the Delete key to erase text twice as 
fast as other keys repeat, and Ctrl-Space causes you to insert spaces twice 
as fast.  When Dual Speed Keys is set to "Fast", Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down, 
Ctrl-Left, and Ctrl-Right (arrow keys) will move the cursor twice as fast 
as usual.  If the Repeat Speed setting further up in this Control Panel is 
set to the top speed possible, these particular features will appear to do 
nothing, since it will not repeat faster than the fastest speed.


MOUSE   On the ROM 03 IIgs, the ability to make the keyboard simulate mouse
"""""   movements was built into the firmware code.  This was intended to 
make it easier for handicapped users who could not easily use a mouse still 
handle software that needed one.  Because of this, the mouse-related items 
in this Control Panel were moved to a separate entry, which looks like 
this:

      (ROM 03)

     Control Panel

     Mouse

     ~ Mouse Tracking: |*-------------|
     ~ Double Click  : |-------*------|

       -Keyboard Mouse-
     ~ Delay To Start: |-------*------|
     ~ Acceleration  : |-------*------|
     ~ Maximum Speed : |--------*-----|


     Select <- -> V ^  Cancel:Esc  Save: <-|

     Notice that the setting in the ROM 01 version (under "Options") calls
Mouse Tracking a "High Speed Mouse".  Setting that option to "Yes" makes
any movement of the mouse on your table top to cause the cursor on the
screen to move twice as far as usual.  On the ROM 03, you have some finer
control over the specifics of the mouse tracking.

     With enhancements the in System Software made available in System 6, 
the distinction between a ROM 01 and ROM 03 became less apparent, as now 
BOTH versions of the IIgs can make mouse movements accessible to 
handicapped users that cannot handle a standard mouse.  However, if a 
program that does not run under GS/OS (or under System 6) needs this type 
of access, a ROM 03 GS will still be necessary.

     Double Click items are present with both versions of the IIgs 
firmware.  The Double Click control adjusts how quickly two clicks must be 
made in order to be properly registered by programs that use them for 
shortcuts (such as selecting and launching a program from the Finder).  If 
your double clicks  aren't always being accepted, you may have this set too 
high or too low for the speed you use.  Try adjusting it and see what works 
better for you.

     The remaining items are specific for the keyboard mouse feature.  This 
is activated by pressing the Open-Apple (Command) and Shift keys at the 
same time, and then pressing and releasing the Clear key.  After you've 
done this, the numeric keypad can be used to control the position of the 
cursor on the screen, and the center key ("5") [15is used to] simulate the 
button on the mouse.  Other features involved in controlling the keyboard 
mouse can be found in the ROM 03 IIgs Owner's Reference or the System 6 
User's Reference.

     Back to the Mouse Control Panel:  Delay To Start is similar to the 
Repeat Delay on the Keyboard Control Panel; this refers to how long the 
keypad keys have to be held down before the mouse cursor will move. 
Acceleration controls the speed at which the mouse cursor moves under 
keyboard control, and Maximum Speed refers to how fast the cursor moves.

     As mentioned above, if you are running System 6.0 or 6.0.1, you have 
these features available on ANY version of the IIgs.  The adjustable 
Control Panel settings would not, of course, be available from this CDA 
Control Panel.  Instead, a ROM 01 user will need to access the NDA Control 
Panel (from the Apple in the upper left corner) in a GS/OS program, and 
make the changes in how the keyboard mouse works from there.


NEXT MONTH   Well, the heater finally kicked in, and my monitor is not
""""""""""   fogging up any more from the melted ice.  We are approaching 
the end of this examination of the Control Panel Classic Desk Accessory.  
Communication with your printer and modem like you've never seen it before, 
RS-232 serial interfaces, and more--next time, on "Polishing Green Apples"!  
Don't miss it!!

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> Tey were written before DOS 3.3.  THey work with 
original ROM Applesoft

<[Paul] PMP> i used to save my BASIC and machine language programs on 
cassette... used to mess up all the time, which annoyed me to no end then I 
took the leap and spend $350 + $99 for the controller for a 5.25" disk 
drive...

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> I would just start up the computer and cue up the
cassette and type load

<[GEna] A2.GENA> You could pose this ? in the bb... cat 2, topic 4

** <QUALITY> is here.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Hi, Jerry!

<[Paul] PMP> Greetings, Jerry.  How's it going?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Hi all

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> HI Jerry

<[GEna] A2.GENA> So, shall we begin?  Jerry, I'm going to make a few 
announcments, then give it over to you.  Since there's not a crowd, I don't
think listen-only is necessary...

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Oh, OK

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> Jerry--Love Quality--Thanks for your Apple II support

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Announce away.  (Thanks, Carl.)

<[Fred] F.GREATOREX> Hello Jerry.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Alright...as you know, WWUG was the brainchild of Lunatic, 
while we were sitting in a dorm room at kfest...and as Jeff and myself were 
the leaders of the BBB, we were appointed to get this group off it's feet.  
We figured that getting Apple II support out there was becoming more 
andmore difficult, so we'd try to help with an online support group!

     Our first area is "What's New in Appledom" -

     As we all know...AW4.0 is now shipping and becoming very popular.  In 
a few moments, Jerry here will be telling us all about it!

     Also, Spectrum is soon to come off the drawing board and into 
production...it's a desktop communciations program...will undoubtedly 
please those who use Manager and SwitchIt on a regular basis!

     ANSITerm has come out with a new version, which will be shipping 
soon.  Paul didn't stick around too long for me to have him tell us a 
little about it, but... as soon as I can find the time, I'm gonna abstract 
our interview with him last month...all about ANSITerm!

     Now, for a few previews of some library files I've found quite cool.  
For holiday pics, file #21761 has christmas and Hannukah stuff...  File 
#21778 is the December Disk of the Month...loaded with goodies.  File 
#21740 is a real nifty little program - it is an auto-trash thing...that 
is, when you dump something in the trash, it automatically erases it 
without you having to hit OA-T.  File #21728 is a general GS file utility, 
and file #11631 is a real nice program to play sounds in the background.  
Right now, I can't get it to work, but I suspect it doesn't like one or 
more of my myriad da's/inits, and I haven't had time to find out which one 
is offensive...

     Does anyone have any questions???

<[Fred] F.GREATOREX> Are any of those files duplicated on the A2 Dom disk?

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Fred, I'm not certain...haven't looked at the contents yet 
of the Dec. DOM...got most of those files from the Dean's List :)  I can't 
dl the DOM right now until I can get my 3.5" drive working :(

<[Fred] F.GREATOREX> Cool.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Alright...Here's (said in my best Johny Carson 
announcement voice <grin>) Jerry!  We're going to open the floor to 
questions...you all know the basics of AW4.0, right?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Well, as you know, AppleWorks 4 has been shipping for 
about a month and a half...  A lot of people are already using it and 
enjoying it.  B)  Anything I can help clear up about AW4?

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Jerry, I know that it incorporates many of the 
time-outs...which ones are they?

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> What has been added since VERS. 3?

<[Fred] F.GREATOREX> can you send me a free copy?

<[GEna] A2.GENA> :)

<[Jerry] QUALITY> The majority of things that have been added are new 
database features, GEna.  TotalControl is now built in.  Also, UltraMacros 
is built in...

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> What is total Control?

<[GEna] A2.GENA> I haven't played around too much with TO's myself...but...

<[Jerry] QUALITY> TotalControl is an add-on Randy Brandt developed... It 
allows one data base to access data from another data base, or from a 
spreadsheet.  It also lets you use formulas in the data base.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> That would have been a BIG help in the job I was on 
earlier - at home!

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Similar features were added to the spreadsheet...

<[GEna] A2.GENA> I had multiple db's - one for each customer...and had to
make reports on totals (customer = client)

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> Can you set up seperate calc fields in the data base 
for reports?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Reports no longer have calculated fields... all the 
calculations are done in the data base itself... You can even set up 
auto-calculate categories so that when you change one category, the 
calculated category is automatically updated.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> In the DB, too?  that could be done already in the ss, 
right?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Right... the data base has gained a whole bunch of 
spreadsheet-like features

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> Is this similar to the way AWGS hansles the DB?

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Cool!  I was using DB's exclusively, due to the fact that 
I had to cull out stuff...

<[Jerry] QUALITY> The spreadsheet remains the best place for 
number-crunching and what-ifs, the data base is the best place for keeping 
lists of things.  Actually, I'm not sure if it's at all like the AWGS data
base.  I've never used the AWGS data base.  (Believe it or not <g>)

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Actually, the SS WOULD have been better for me (number
crunching), but I HAD to take out specific things, say, all records of a
given merchandiser from an entire list of merchandisers who worked for one 
client

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> It's hard to explain how I use the data base for 
customer order.  But I need something that calcs tax and shipping after 
culling the order from the inventory DB

<[Jerry] QUALITY> In the Word Processor, you get Glossary functions.  Which 
allow you, basically, to do mail merge one record at a time...

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Jerry, when I worked on the old xerox 860's - glossary 
function was like a macro...i.e., type one letter, and a phrase would pop 
up...that's what THEY called glossary

<[Jerry] QUALITY> In other words, you want to write a letter to someone, so 
you pull up your name and address glossary; it gives you a list of the 
people in your address data base...  When you pick the name, it inserts the 
name and address into the WP document

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Wouldn't the new formula thing in the DB fill Carl's 
"order"?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Yes, you can probably do that all using the data base 
now, Carl.  The data base supports 60 categories instead of 30... so there 
will be lots more room.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Indeed! (for my vendor database, how nice!)  Jerry, one 
thing...does it support, like the ss, sideways print for the db?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> You still need Sidespread for that...  Unless of course 
you have an HP Deskjet 500

<[GEna] A2.GENA> I thought SideSpread only worked with the ss!

<[Jerry] QUALITY> True... but you can easily copy the data base records to
the spreadsheet

<[GEna] A2.GENA> True...

<[Jerry] QUALITY> The DJ 500 driver lets you print sideways from any 
application, but that's only because the DJ can print sideways.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Question...until I get my hands on AW4.0 (which may be a 
while financially), can I copy the records from the DB into the SS in 3.0?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Yes, you can... anything from one module can be copied to 
any other module, starting with 3.0

<[GEna] A2.GENA> (there are NO calculations...just data)  (now, if I can 
just find my 5.25" version of SideSpread <grin>)

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Let's see... AW4 also has three independent Desktops... 
and three Clipboards.  Built-in disk and file utilities... Better 
mail-merge...  Many of the most popular AppleWorks patches (for example,
cursor shape and blink rate) have their own option on the configuration 
menu.  There's a built-in clock display and screen blanker.  Lots of other 
stuff. B)

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Alright...anyone have any questions???  Don't all speak at 
once :)

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Jerry...I think you've left them speechless :)

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> what are the prices for upgrade

** <PMP> is here.

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Upgrades from 3.0 are $79.95...from 2.x, $99.95... From 
1.x, $119.95...  Or if you don't have AW already, you can get the package 
for $179.95.  To upgrade, you just need to send your original disks (or 
photocopies) to us...

     Quality Computers, 20200 Nine Mile Rd., St. Clair Shores, MI 48080

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> What original Time Outs are now part of the new 4.0
package?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Hmmm, TimeOut Paint...  There aren't really any TimeOuts 
included per se... that is, you don't activate them from the Apple-Escape 
menu...  It's more like AppleWorks ate 'em for lunch

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Oh...speaking of TO's...what about original TO's...are 
they compatible with 4.0?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> For example, FileMaster is now incorporated...but you 
access it from the Other Activities menu, not from the TimeOut menu

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> I uderstand--Waht features I should say--I understand
they have been incorperayted into the core program

<[Paul] P.JANETZKE> When's the world conf.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> NOW!

<[Paul] PMP> what about macros?  Does 4.0 have something like UltraMacros
built-in?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> It has an UltraMacros 4 player built in...

<[Paul] PMP> cool!

<[Jerry] QUALITY> You need UltraMacros 4.3 or later to compile and record
your own

<[GEna] A2.GENA> What about compatibility with present TO's..?  i.e., side 
spread, etc.

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Some of them will work without modification.  AW4 comes 
with an updater which will update many of them.  We hope to have more 
working early in 1994.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Is there a list of those that will/will not, and those 
that can or cannot be updated, or is it mainly "hit/miss"?

<[Jerry] QUALITY> I don't have the list handy, but it's been posted in Cat 
42 Top 29.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Ah....alright!

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Sidespread has been, I think

<[Paul] P.JANETZKE> Hey, I know it's probably been asked already but what 
is the status on the AWGS update Jerry???

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Actually, not, Paul :)

<[Paul] PMP> good question...

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Indeed!

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Well, we've got Jim Merritt as project manager...  And 
we're in the process of getting the source Claris sent us to compile... and 
looking at the suggestion lists to see what we can do in a reasonable time 
frame

<[Paul] PMP> :) thats always a problem...

<[Jerry] QUALITY> We hope to have something released next spring.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Great!  oh, and make it like system 6.0.1, too :)  right?

<[Paul] PMP> one feature, if it hasn't been mentioned yet... having the 
spell checker work in PL...

<[Jerry] QUALITY> That might be doable, depending on how closely the two 
data structures resemble each other

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> I am  mostly using AWGS--I am also in the AWGS 
Upgrade

<[Paul] PMP> and having 360 degree rotations of objects and text would be
nice :)

<[GEna] A2.GENA> I like AWGS for page layout...with an old imagewriter I, 
print quality is better than Publish It...

<[Jerry] QUALITY> If you're going to rotate something 360 degrees, what's 
the point?

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Besides...can't use Pointless with Publish It!

<[Paul] PMP> :/ 0-360 degree... like having angled text, etc.

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Not sure how feasible that is, but I'll add it to the 
list  Anyone else got any pet suggestions for AWGS?  B)

<[Paul] PMP> oh... and having boxes with widths that scale properly in
condensed mode sorta like how GWIII does it... i always have to add 
additional lines at the top and bottom to make them the same width as the 
sides

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Since mine doesn't seem to like 6.0.1, I don't use it...

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> I would like to dee a better telecomm modual for AWGS 
such as an outo logon modual

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Yes!...I'm certain that a LOT of people echo that, Carl... 
and better "split-screen" capability?

<[Paul] PMP> oh... and a BIGGY... make it IPC-compatible with an "Extras"
menu kinda like the Finder for external/TimeOut-type programs

<[Jerry] QUALITY> I'm not sure how much effort we'll be putting into the 
telecomm module, to be honest.  Most AWGS users don't have modems, so the 
telecomm is kinda low on our priority list.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Interesting note, Jerry, about users v modems

** <A.RAHIMZADEH> is here.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Hi, Auri

<[Auri Man] A.RAHIMZADEH> Hey Gena!~

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> I'm just looking for a good window (GS) interface for 
my telecomm program

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Spectrum, Carl, when it comes out!

<[Jerry] QUALITY> My suggestion right now is to invesitgate AnsiTerm or
Spectrum

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> That sounds great jerry--

<[GEna] A2.GENA> ANSITerm, though excellent, is not a GS program, right?  
er desktop, that is

<[Paul] PMP> right, its not a desktop program

<[Jerry] QUALITY> A stand-alone telecomm program is always going to be more 
powerful than the one in an integrated package

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Hint, hint...Paul...for your next update :)

<[Paul] PMP> :/

<[Paul] P.JANETZKE> Well I'm probably going to get FLAMED for this but as 
far as I'm concerned you can ditch the telecom altogether unless you make 
it something that the GS can really use like full color ANSI and stuff like
that. That's my $.02 worth.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Poor Paul...he's gotten SO many suggsetions for his next
update :)

<[Paul] PMP> :)  hey, 2.1 just came out, gimme a break!

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Well...maybe if we badger Paul...hehehe

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Paul: Sure, are you willing to pay $50 more for a better 
telecomm program?

<[Carl] C.MANUELIAN1> Jerry--I saw your ad for spectrum--is it out yet?

<[David] D.PIERCE8> Has Quality received any shipments of Spectrum from
Sevenhills?

<[Auri Man] A.RAHIMZADEH> I'm using Spectrum :)  It should be out soon!

<[Paul] PMP> Jerry, what about the "Extras" menu idea?  I'm sure this has 
been brought up before, since it would be a GREAT advantage for AWGS

<[Jerry] QUALITY> ANSI is a good way to slow down your baud rate.  B)  The 
good thing about the AWGS comm module is that it will serve to get modem 
novices online

<[Paul] P.JANETZKE> Well Jerry, my point is if it;s not the best why worry 
about it when the best can be had elsewhere. If a major update to the 
telecom would cost too much in time and/or money then find something else. 
I'm happy with PT 3.1.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> So am I, Paul, but if I can use a 'com program that is 
desktop, a good wp desktop program, etc., then I could use some of the 
other goodies, like SwitchIt, The Manager and HardPressed...

<[Paul] P.JANETZKE> I mean Megaterm isn't slow and it does excellent color 
ANSI for the GS.

<[Auri Man] A.RAHIMZADEH> Wait for MultiGS 2.0 Gena :)

<[Paul] P.JANETZKE> Good point about novice users, but the package deals 
that are offered with modems usually provide a telecom package/

<[Jerry] QUALITY> It might get zmodem..

<[GEna] A2.GENA> True, Paul, but most of the modem packages nowadays offer
Mac and ms-dos com ware

<[Paul] P.JANETZKE> No Megaterm starts as P8 but then uses superhires for
complete ANSI emulation.

Hey Jerry is Quality working on some sort of FAX software for the GS, I 
think I remember reading about this somewhere. If so what's its
status??

<[Jerry] QUALITY> I think the Q Fax software's gonna be a wash.  Unless we 
can get the author to finish it...

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Unless someone has some more questions about AW4 or AWGS, 
I think it's time for me to move along.

<[Paul] PMP> what about the "Extras" menu, Jerry?  :)

<[Jerry] QUALITY> It's a suggestion many have made, Paul

<[Paul] PMP> thought so :)  thanks

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Alright!  Thank you very much Jerry for your informative
talk!

<[Paul] PMP> Thanks for the info, Jerry.  I'll be looking forward to the 
new AWGS update!

<[Paul] P.JANETZKE> Thank for the answers Jerry!!

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Thanks for having me, GEna!

<[GEna] A2.GENA> You're welcome, Jerry!

<[Jerry] QUALITY> Randy has done a phenomenal job with AW4.  I'M 
impressed... and that's not easy.  See y'all later.

<[GEna] A2.GENA> Laters, Jerry

<[Auri Man] A.RAHIMZADEH> l8rness Jerry!  looking forward to my next II 
Alive!  :)

<[Paul] PMP> has anyone received the new II Alive yet?

<[Auri Man] A.RAHIMZADEH> not here... can't wait tho! :)

<[Jerry] QUALITY> New II Alive mailed the 7th so it's on the way.

<[Auri Man] A.RAHIMZADEH> awesome!

** <[Jerry] QUALITY> has left.

<A2.GENA> I suppose this concludes the formal part of the meeting :)  I'm
going to TRY to get Brian for January - Internetting

Review of TypeSet

               TypeSet
               by WestCode Software Inc.
               15050 Avenue of Science, Suite 112
               San Diego, CA 92128
               1-800-448-4250 (orders only)
               or 619-487-9200
               list price $49.95 (introductory price $29.95)


                               [*][*][*]

     This time, we'll be putting a software package called TypeSet on the 
examining table.  This program was created by Steve Disbrow and Joe Wankerl 
of _GS+ Magazine_ fame, and is distributed by WestCode Software.


TRUETYPE TECHNOLOGY   A little over a year ago, many Apple II computer
"""""""""""""""""""   users were surprised and pleased to find when 
TrueType technology arrived for the Apple IIgs.  With the introduction of 
Pointless, Apple IIgs owners could use scalable fonts with many most 
popular software packages.

     TrueType fonts are available from a variety of sources.  They only 
limitation to the number of typefaces available from Pointless is the disk 
space that a person is willing to allow his font collection to eat up.  
Once the typeface definition exists and is visible to Pointless, the 
software can generate a font in any size (point) that the user wants.  You 
can probably guess that many people find themselves with more fonts than 
they know what to do with.

     When WestCode Software updated their Pointless package this year, 
they made many significant improvements.  Some improvements will allow a 
user to have even more typefaces available.  The trade-off is that it can 
be confusing to find all your typefaces and to remember what they look 
like.  It is at this point that TypeSet enters the picture.


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION   TypeSet claims to be a tool that will let you do
"""""""""""""""""""   three things:

     1)  You can see a sample of each typeface in the pull-down Font menu.

     2)  You can choose which of the typefaces will be available from 
pull-down Font menus.

     3)  You can print four types of reports to a printer or the screen.

     TypeSet can be installed using the Apple Computer's Installer program
with scripts written for that specific purpose.  The first item that the
installation process requires is the name of the user.  The original can
then be copied -- there is no copy protection -- and used to install the
TypeSet program on a hard drive or on your favorite floppy system disks.
You can also simply take the appropriate file (that's right... only one!)
and put it in the System folder of your boot hard drive.  If you gather
from this that installation is a snap, then I have described the process
correctly.

     The TypeSet software works as a New Desk Accessory (NDA).  This type 
of program is available under the Apple pull-down menu within any standard 
desktop program.  From here, the software can set up and change the way 
that other software gets information about the Font pull-down menu.

     When you select the TypeSet NDA, you are presented with a number of 
choices concerning how the Font menu appears under desktop programs.  A 
button is also available that will take you to the report menu for other 
choices.  When you have made your selections, the TypeSet NDA can be closed 
and put away until the next time that you want to customize the Font menu 
look.

     Under the title of "Settings" you are given the option of whether or 
not you want What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) Font menus.  You may 
also choose the size of the typefaces displayed.  Another nice feature on 
this page is the ability to change the keyboard selection sequence to your 
own preference.

     The main feature of TypeSet is available on the main page.  You are 
given the opportunity to create and manage typeface "Sets" that can be 
selected on the fly.  A set consists of any number of typefaces that have 
been previously established under Pointless.  Any typeface that Pointless 
knows about is available; however, you can select which typefaces are shown 
as a Font menu selectable item.  Any number of sets can be created and the 
set membership is available for editing on the first page.  When you make a 
set active on this page, then only those typefaces are shown on Font 
pull-down menus until you change the set.

     One of my favorite features of the TypeSet package is the ability to 
print typeface reports.  Four different reports are available:  All 
characters, key equivalents, various sizes (same typeface), and line 
samples (multiple typefaces).  The first three reports are meant to display 
important information about any single typeface.  The final report is meant 
to be used for giving examples of many different typefaces in a small 
space.  About eight typefaces are shown per page on the line sample report.  
These reports can be shown on the screen or sent to the printer using your 
favorite print driver.  This NDA, in conjunction with Harmonie or 
Independence, provides fantastic reports on an HP IIP compatible laser 
printer.


PROGRAM PERFORMANCE   The first and last thing that hits me about this
"""""""""""""""""""   package can be summed up in one word:  speed.  
TypeSet is too slow.  I do not mean just a little pokey; I mean that you 
can eat a heavy snack during some of the operations available in TypeSet... 
even on my system, which has a 8 MHz Zip card and a RamFast SCSI 
controller.

     My major reason for buying the software was the promise of the 
ability to handle many TrueType typefaces without having to go into 
Pointless to change what was available.  I wanted to be able to create sets 
and use those sets to limit the typefaces shown on my menus.

     TypeSet seems to slow down in direct response to the typefaces that 
have been defined under Pointless.  Therefore, the very reason that I 
bought the package turns out to be its weakest point.  WestCode indicates 
that TypeSet is the perfect solution for managing large typeface selection 
situations.  I have to disagree.

     The problem is not even limited to using the TypeSet NDA.  Because 
TypeSet is active whenever a desktop program is executing, .some unexpected 
delays quickly become apparent.  Every time you start a new desktop program 
with a Font pull-down menu, TypeSet sets up the list of typefaces that will 
appear on that menu.  During the initial setup time (i.e. before the menu 
titles appear at the top of the page), there is an extended delay while the 
Font menus are created.  This was an unexpected event!  I have put together 
some typeface sets that caused the Finder to take an extra two minutes to 
start up.  (It may be that this is due to slowness of the system software's 
List Manager.  However, this is only my personal theory.)

     Another area that relates to overall speed concerns the Font menu 
using WYSIWYG names.  It takes a long time to move through the menu in this 
mode.  This happens because Pointless has to create the typeface on the fly 
-- TypeSet's manual even suggests a way to speed this up.  You must create 
a fixed point size font for each TrueType file that you list on a menu.  
This alternative takes up about 10-25 extra blocks for each typeface.  It 
can take more than 30 seconds to display a 20 item typeface menu.

     During testing, TypeSet proved to be unstable; a serious concern.  By 
this, I mean that I have had the software crash a number of times while 
trying to create sets, change sets, create reports or print reports.  I 
have never had a problem with stability in connection with the WYSIWYG Font 
menu.  The only pattern that I can glean from my testing indicates that the 
more typefaces available from the Pointless setup, the more likely that I 
am to crash the system.  This "feature", combined with the speed problems 
that I have listed, have made for some slow and frustrating evenings using 
TypeSet.

     My last concern may be related to the system crashing -- I cannot 
honestly rule out that possibility; however, it seems to me to be a 
different problem:  I have had set definitions disappear from one session 
to another.  I will have created a set that has a few of the typefaces for 
use with a particular type of program.  Once I go to another desktop 
program and reenter TypeSet, the set definition is gone.  This tends to 
serve as yet another area of frustration.

     I do not want to leave this review without listing one of the 
outstanding features of this package.  The typeface reports are an 
outstanding facet of the TypeSet NDA.  It is extremely nice to be able to 
choose a list of typefaces and have TypeSet print out a group of 
professional-looking reports; however, I have found a few areas of 
instability in this area also.  There have been times -- though relatively 
few -- when the system will crash while printing reports.  On the whole, 
this is the strongest feature of TypeSet in its current state.

RECOMMENDATION   I cannot really recommend the purchase of TypeSet at this
""""""""""""""   time.  I feel that additional testing is needed to iron 
out some of the problems that I experienced.  I also think that the program 
needs to be significantly speeded up.

     The only reason that I would recommend TypeSet at this time is for 
its reports feature.  However, this is an expensive way to handle that 
task.  Even when the software is used exclusively for reports, the speed 
problems will still be a concern.  Most people will want to wait and see 
what WestCode Software does to address these problems.  With some fixes for 
the most serious defects, I should be able to recommend this software at 
some point in the future.  Until then, I will use Pointless to manage my 
typeface selection.

called JEM Software.  He was one of the people that worked on AppleWorks 
3.0 and also worked for Beagle Bros.

     Well, Randy, let's start from the beginning... where were you born 
and where did you grow up?

BRANDT>   I was born in Morris, Manitoba and grew up in Kamsack,
""""""    Saskatchewan and Kola, Manitoba.  Kola had a population of 80 (7 
in my family).  Kamsack was [named for] an Indian chief.  My parents are 
back in Kamsack.  I have a sister in Phoenix and the rest are in Canada.


GEnieLamp>   What is your educational background?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   I have a degree in Sec Ed/English from Christian Heritage College
""""""    in San Diego.  Circa 1983.


GEnieLamp>   What had you originally planned to do with your life?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   End it.  Just kidding.  I was going to be a scientist.
""""""


GEnieLamp>   In what field?
"""""""""

BRANDT>   I went to CHC as a Biology major.  I dropped that after an "A" in
""""""    Genetics.  I loved the theory, but hated the lab work.  My virgin 
female fruit flies kept multiplying.


GEnieLamp>   How and when did you get started with computers?
"""""""""    
BRANDT>   I started with computers in college.  In 1980 my school,
""""""    Christian Heritage College, got an Apple II, and I started 
hacking.  My first program was a grading package for my girlfriend Joanna.  
She is now my wife and pregnant with kids #4 and 5.


GEnieLamp>   That first program must have impressed her, then!  :)
"""""""""
BRANDT>   Joanna wasn't impressed until I started making some money.
""""""

GEnieLamp>   What was your first programming job, and when was that?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   Beagle hired me in 1984.
""""""


GEnieLamp>    What have you directly worked on for Beagle Bros?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   My Beagle products were ProByter (a disk zap package) and
""""""    Extra K, doing docs and a bit of software.  Then I wrote Big U, 
followed by numerous others from MiniPix to MacroWorks.


GEnieLamp>   What was it like to work at Beagle Bros?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   Working at Beagle was great, although I was only there a month or
""""""    so, since I actually have worked at home for the last 8.5 years.  
It was great at Beagle Bros because Bert Kersey is hilarious and everyone 
got along.  Bert was always pulling pranks, making phony ads, etc.  He's 
just a funny person.

     His house had a trapdoor-looking pattern at the front door, with a
sign that said "Press doorbell once for trapdoor, twice to ring."  At
Hallowe'en he had a battery-powered hand clawing at the window.


GEnieLamp>   Who did you work with there?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   I worked with Mark de Jong, Mark Simonsen and Alan Bird.  Later,
""""""    in the Simonsen era, I worked with Mark Munz, Matt Reimer and
Dan Verkade.  We used to get together every Friday for lunch since we all
worked at home.


GEnieLamp>   No office to go to?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   None of us _wanted_ to go to the office to work.
""""""

GEnieLamp>  Tell us about each of your co-workers.
"""""""""
BRANDT>   Alan is the genius.  He's the only one with as many kids as I
"""""""   have.  Mark Simonsen is a good guy as well, and a very good
programmer, especially with graphics and printers.  Mark de Jong didn't
program as much, but he loved messing with little SuperMacroWorks
programs, and even did a text-based game and paint program.  Dan was a good
friend of mine before Beagle days, and I got him hooked up with Beagle.
Matt was a high school student and I met him while subbing his chemistry
class.  Years later we found out his grandfather and mine had been buddies
in Canada in the 1930s.  All the more amazing is that we met in San Diego.


GEnieLamp>   You taught chemistry?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   I subbed chemistry.  I taught English, Geometry, History, Math
""""""    and Comp Sci.


GEnieLamp>   For how long did you teach?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   I student-taught a semester, then I taught a year, then I did
""""""    some subbing.  Computers were my love and I couldn't land the 
comp sci job at my school, so I left.

     Rob Renstrom is another Beagle friend. He wrote PowerPrint and TimeOut
Graph and now owns WestCode.  John Obberick of WestCode and Jon Simonsen
are also Beagle friends.


GEnieLamp>   I didn't realize that an ex-Beagle Bros alumni owns WestCode.
"""""""""
BRANDT>   Yes, John and Rob started out at Beagle.
""""""


GEnieLamp>   How much were you involved with the AppleWorks 3.0 project for

""""""    After lengthy acrimonious negotiations, the lawyers made a deal.


GEnieLamp>   Was it a difficult project?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   Hard to say. It had tough times and easy times, but was weird
""""""    because we were used to doing our own thing.  AppleWorks 4 was 
easier in that I had complete control, but harder because of the added 
responsibility and pressure.  However, Claris wasn't paying us much so the 
motivation was lower:  we got a flat fee.  With AppleWorks 4 I get a 
royalty.  AppleWorks 3.0 is basically the only non-royalty project I've 
done since 1985.


GEnieLamp>   When did you start your own company?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   I started JEM Software before my Beagle days, back in January
""""""    of 1984.  My first products included Commodore 64 hardware and

initials.  I told her it might get somewhere someday, but she just laughed.


GEnieLamp>   How has having your own company been for you?

GEnieLamp>   So is JEM defunct now?
"""""""""
BRANDT>   No, it's been around since 1984, just not very active at the

decided to make up for it.

     I always loved sports, so maybe that made me competitive, or maybe I

Apple II Hybrids
""""""""""""""""
By Jay Curtis
  [J.CURTIS8]



                      >>> THE APPLE II AND MS-DOS <<<
                      """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Gregg Keizer may have said it best in a 1991 inCider/A+ article about 
the Macintosh LC:  "The best bridge is one you can't see."(1)  An ideal 
AppleII hybrid would be one that allowed the user simply to stick a 
foreign operating system's disk into a disk drive, open the directory and 
either perform file maintenance or launch programs by clicking icons or by 
highlighting menu items.

     Many Apple II owners have discovered that something close to that 
ideal is possible on a Apple IIgs equipped with a PC Transporter.  Until 
recently, owning an Apple IIe or IIgs with Applied Engineering's PCT card 
was more like owning two computers inside one box, rather than one 
integrated machine.  Except for Applied's excellent file transfer utility 
-- which runs only on the PC side -- there just wasn't much communication 
between the PCT and the Apple II.  The advertisements that introduced the 
PCT card in 1988 claimed, "With PC Transporter, MS-DOS programs see your 
Apple hardware as IBM hardware.  You can use the same hardware you have 
now."(2)  While truthful, many claims made in Applied's ads could be 
somewhat misleading.   Users have often found that owning a PC Transporter 
provided less convenience and integration than they imagined.

     To be certain, the PC Transporter can (and did) make use of Apple II 
peripherals.  For example, users can store MS-DOS files on standard ProDOS 
devices and on the PCT's own (MS-DOS) "Transdrives."  Similarly, ProDOS 
files can be stored on the Transdrives as well.  However, both kinds of 
data storage are nonstandard, and users have found that these nonstandard 
disks cannot be read in disk drives on other machines.  Users have also 
discovered that MS-DOS files, even those stored on ProDOS devices, were 
inaccessible in Apple II mode.  Additionally, ProDOS files that had been 
stored on the PCT's Transdrives, could only be read in those drives and not 
in standard ProDOS drives.

     Despite these limitations, a PCT card can also offer certain 
advantages.  For example, all 768 kilobytes of the PCT's RAM can be made 
available to an Apple IIe or IIgs as a RAMdisk in ProDOS mode.  With 
Applied Engineering's special ProDOS software, the PCT's RAMdisk can be 
used as expanded desktop for programs like AppleWorks.  Additionally, PCT 
users fortunate enough to own a PCT Transdrive system have found that they 
can store up to 360K of ProDOS data on a single 5.25 floppy disk, a much 
nicer alternative to the 143K available on standard Apple 5.25 floppy 
drives.

     An Apple IIe equipped with a PCT card and Transdrive system, remains 
a formidable tool.  Besides it's MS-DOS capability, it has nearly 1MB of 
RAM available in ProDOS mode.  With the additional disk drive storage 
available through the PCT's Transdrives, all of AppleWorks can be run from 
a single 5.25 or 720K floppy.  Add in Mac file transfer programs for the 
Apple II such as HFS Link, plus similar Mac file transfer programs for 
MS-DOS (available from GEnie), which will run on the PCT side, and an Apple 
IIe shares files with both Macintosh and MS-DOS systems with ease.  Today's 
Apple IIe, running with AppleWorks 4.0, a PCT card, and MS-DOS 5.0 can keep 
up with the best of them.


FILE TRANSFER   In recent months, the Apple IIgs has received a major boost
"""""""""""""   as a "GS/PC" through the development of GS/OS System 
6.0.1's MS-DOS file system translator.  To make use of this FST, however, 
you need at least one of the following:  a Floptical disk drive, a 
Superdrive, or a PC Transporter card.  With the right equipment, the FST 
opens and displays MS-DOS volumes right on the GS desktop in the same way 
that it can open and display any standard GS/OS or ProDOS volume.

     With the FST, you can copy files from MS-DOS volumes and
subdirectories to ProDOS volumes and subdirectories by dragging and
dropping icons -- in the same way that you can copy files between ProDOS,
GS/OS and HFS volumes.  You can also open and display MS-DOS text files on
the GS desktop with utilities like ShadowWrite or Teach, simply by
clicking their icons.  You can modify these files like any text file and
save them back to ProDOS.  Besides being able to work with standard MS-DOS
diskettes, the FST can also open and display those special PC Transporter
MS-DOS floppy disk volumes that have been created on standard ProDOS
drives.

     There are, however, some limitations.  Using the FST you cannot, for
example, copy ProDOS files _to_ MS-DOS volumes or delete MS-DOS files from
MS-DOS volumes.  The FST is a read-only translator.  Additionally, the FST
won't recognize PC Transporter hard drive volumes.  The FST does not have
a complete icon set and will not identify most file types under the "Icon
Info" menu bar selection.  Blank page icons for unknown file types, text
icons, and directory folders are all that appear to be available.
Fortunately, MS-DOS filename conventions takes care of part of this
problem -- the three-character filename extension can help signal the
contents of a file.

     Further refinement is called for.  An ideal FST should have its own
set of icons for most of the important MS-DOS file types.  COM, BAT, and
EXE, for example, are among those which need their own icons.  The FST
should be able to open and display hard drive volumes on the desktop, and
it should be able to perform some basic file maintenance (i.e. copy, move,
delete) upon MS-DOS files.  Such an FST should permit both reading and
writing.  In view of the fact that Apple has discontinued the Apple IIe
and IIgs including plans for the Ethernet card, it seems most unlikely that
any refinements of the MS-DOS FST will be produced by the Apple II
development team.  That task will be left to Apple II enthusiasts who have
the necessary programming skills to finish Apple's work.

     If a full read/write desktop FST is ever developed for GS/OS, it seems
probable that the FST will be created as a system extension, NDA, or
separate utility program, rather than being fully integrated into the GS
desktop.  Hugh McKay, an Apple II programer who had an MS-DOS copy program
available for the IIgs before Apple's team had released their own FST, is
one likely candidate to write a full set of MS-DOS desktop utilities for
the IIgs.  You can download Hugh's MS-DOS file copy program from the GEnie
A2 Library (file #20669:  MSDOS12.BXY).  Another likely candidate is
Australian Peter Watson.  In fact, Watson already has a nearly full set of
MS-DOS utilities which run under GS/OS (file #21414: MSDOSUTILS.BXY).

     Watson's utilities were written as a set of integrated executable
files that will run under a GS desktop shell such as ProSEL-16, or under
Watson's own minishell which he has named, appropriately enough,
COMMAND.COM.  The utilities use the text screen display rather than the GS
desktop.  These 16-bit utilities will not run under ProSel-8 or as 8-bit
ProDOS utilities -- bad news for IIe owners.

     Watson's utilities are good news, however, for PCT-equipped AppleIIgs
owners.  The utility's shell program can be launched from the GS desktop
like any ProDOS system file.  The utilities can poll all IIgs devices
online, searching for MS-DOS capable volumes.  They can display files in
_any_ MS-DOS volume, including PC Transporter hard drive volumes.  Watson's
command-line display is nearly identical to the MS-DOS command line
display.  When the directory command "MDIR" is typed, the standard MS-DOS
header with MS-DOS drive designation, serial number, and directory are
displayed first, followed by a list of files for the directory by file name
and attribute, number of bytes, date and time -- just like MS-DOS.  The
only difference for diehard MS-DOS users is that the Apple II's standard
text screen characters do not greatly resemble the funky MS-DOS font.

     The program's command-line syntax is a bit difficult for the beginner,
but online help is available for all commands.  The user has a definite
sense that this is a transitional interface between MS-DOS and ProDOS.  The
syntax is MS-DOS-_like_ syntax.  Command capabilities include format, copy,
delete, directory display, rename and type.  The most obvious advantage to
this program is that the user has considerable control over MS-DOS volumes
and files without leaving ProDOS.  The program offers more control than
that given by the GS/OS FST.

     Watson claims that he wants to add "make directory" and "remove
directory" commands plus an "undelete" command and a "read-only version"
of FDISK, which would provide hard disk partition information.  He also
says, "I want to make this a full desktop interface program -- Real Soon
Now!" As they stand right now, the utilities are solid and, at $15 for the
shareware fee, they are a real bargain.

     
PROGRAM LAUNCHING   Applied Engineering improved on its software for the
"""""""""""""""""   PC Transporter since its introduction.  One upgrade 
provided a BASIC utility called PC.LAUNCHER.  This utility creates task 
files that allow the user to directly launch any MS-DOS program from GS/OS 
or ProDOS.  On the Apple II side, each task file can be given names like 
"DBase.IV," "MicroSoft.Works" "ProCOMM.Plus," or whatever applies.  The 
user simply double clicks icons for each of these files in GS/OS and the 
corresponding MS-DOS programs are launched.  The task files can be 
installed anywhere on your hard drive, or you can create aliases of them 
under 6.0.1 and place them in a launching menu right alongside ProDOS or 
GS/OS applications.

     Apple IIe users with PCTs are also able to take advantage of this
launching capability.  Because the task files are ProDOS files, they can
be run from any 8-bit ProDOS launcher or desktop management program, such
as Byrd's Better Bye, Sneeze, or Copy II+.  MS-DOS programs are launched
like any ProDOS program, by simply highlighting the selected file and
hitting <Return>.  Because I use both AppleWorks classic and Microsoft
Works, I have Applied Engineering's MS-DOS File Translation program patched
to my AppleWorks TimeOut Program Selector with a PC.LAUNCHER task file.
This allows me to access the PCT's file translation program from within
AppleWorks, translate files directly into AppleWorks format from MS-DOS,
and then return directly to AppleWorks and call up the files.  Of course,
I can also move things the other way (from AppleWorks to Microsoft Works)
when needed.

     Launching an MS-DOS program occurs almost as smoothly as launching an
8-bit ProDOS program from GS/OS.  The only difference is that (in contrast
to the GS's "One moment please...") the "PC Transporter" announcement
screen is flashed briefly on the screen, and then the traditional DOS
memory counter runs before the selected program itself is run.  If you're
running MS-DOS from a hard drive with RamFAST interface, the time to load
MS-DOS is, subjectively, little more than it takes to run a ProDOS session
from GS/OS.  If you're booting into MS-DOS from other devices (such as a
3.5" disk, much slower than the average hard drive), the wait will be
longer.  Through use of another executable file on the MS-DOS side of
things, PCT.QUIT, it is also possible to quit back to the IIgs or IIe
desktop by simply typing BYE at the MS-DOS prompt.

     While running MS-DOS, IIgs users will especially like the fact that
the IIgs control panel and all Classic Desk Accessories are always
available during an MS-DOS session, just as they are in GS/OS.  Therefore,
the IIgs can take advantage of a kind of multi-processing, a capability
which Applied Engineering has taken special pains to insure in newer
versions of its PCT software.  One particularly useful application of this
capability may be that it allows users immediate access to ProDOS
directories through any CDA file utility while an MS-DOS program is
running.


CONCLUSION   As for the ideal Apple II hybrid posited at the beginning of
""""""""""   this month's article -- one that would allow any disk to be 
inserted in a drive and then be available for copying files or launching 
programs -- it seems to this writer that the evidence is now in.  An Apple 
IIgs with a PCT and/or a drive like a Floptical or SuperDrive is probably 
the best integrated hybrid that you are likely to see, short of the 
development of a PowerPC with an Apple II personality some time in the 
future.

     Next month we'll talk more about the kinds of disk drives that are 
necessary for good integration in an Apple II/PC hybrid and about how the 
PC Transporter does its work within an Apple II.  We'll also talk about 
low-level disk formatting or encoding schemes like MFM and GCR, something a 
potential hybrid owner/user really needs to know about for successful use 
of their machine.  Until then, think hybrid!

INTRODUCTION   The World Wide User Group (WWUG) was the brainchild of
""""""""""""   Lunatic E'Sex, conceived in a dorm room at KansasFest '93,
and nurtered down through the months, until we had our very first meeting
in October, 1993!

     We have discovered that it is at times difficult to find local support
for the Apple II's, and so have created an online user group meeting, being
held once per month (the 3rd Sunday of every month) at 4 p.m. eastern time
in the Apple II Real Time Conference (RTC) center - page 645;2.


NEWS FROM APPLEDOM   There are several new programs that are out or are
""""""""""""""""""   coming out very soon in the world of Apple II:

     Spectrum has been a long-awaited desktop communications program, and
will be very handy for those who use the Manager and HardPressed on a
regular basis...it should be shipping very, very soon...

     ANSITerm 2.1 has just started shipping.  It's an update to Paul
Parkhurst's ANSITerm 2.0 with a lot of added features.

     And, of course, the long-awaited update to the very popular AppleWorks
3.0, Appleworks 4.0 is now shipping.  December's meeting featured Jerry
Kindall who told us all about AW4.0, and the cool updates it has!


DECEMBER'S FEATURE   Jerry Kindall of Quality Computers was our featured
""""""""""""""""""   guest at the December meeting of the WWUG.  He gave
us a very thorough look-see at AW4.0 - and told us of it's many new
features.  I'll give you a brief outline here.

     AW4.0 incorporates many of the time-outs that now have to be manually
patched into AW3.0, including TotalControl, which gives you the ability to
pull data from several databases and/or spreadsheets for a report.  Time-
Out Paint and Time-Out Filemaster are two more TO's that have been
incorporated into the AW4.0 package.  These TO features will be accessed
from the "Other" menu rather than the open-apple-control-escape method used
now.

     Most of the external Time-Out features will be compatible with AW4.0,
and some that are not, will be able to be updated by the included Updater.
The rest will soon be made compatible.

     There is also the added feature that allows you to use formulas in
databases, and will increase the number of categories to 60, up from the 30
now.  This is a very handy tool for those who must use databases, in lieu
of spreadhseets for number-crunching, particularly if they have to pull out
specific peoples, places or things...when making a final report!

     Another neat feature will be in the Word Processor.  It's called
Glossary, and will allow you to merge letters individually from any
database of names/addresses...rather than having to tweak the database,
when you want to send only one or two letters out, as you do now!

     Jerry also told us that an update to AppleWorks GS was in the offing.

For ordering AW4.0, here are the prices:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
       Update from 3.0         $79.95
       Update from 2.0         $99.95
       Original               $179.95


NEWS FROM THE A2 LIBRARY   There are several excellent files in the
""""""""""""""""""""""""   library that I'll recap here, but there are
thousands of files available...and all are good!

   File #21778 is the December DOM - loaded with goodies.

   File #21740 is called AutoTrash - wherein your trash will automatically
   be dumped, when you drag it into the trashcan.  No more having to hit
   OA-T to do that!  But, be careful!

   File #21728  File Passage - a great little GS utility program.

   File #11631  BGSound - plays music in the background - even in 8-
   bit programs (like ProTERM), as it is a CDA


NEWS FROM A2   What's new?  New files, new faces and much valuable
""""""""""""   information for the users of Apple II's!  We are the best
online support for Apple II's of all the commercial online services!  Come
visit us - we're on page 645 and have a bulletin board chock full of
informative stuff, a library with over 21,000 files, and nightly RTC's for
you to come in and either just talk or ask questions about any problems
you're having.  See ya there!

INTRODUCTION   With all the news recently about the latest version of
""""""""""""   AppleWorks, it seems appropriate to reach the part of the 
History that deals with this long-lived and popular program.  In this part 
we will deal with the earlier incarnations of the program, and discuss some 
of the enhancements made to it in the past.


APPLEWORKS   There is one program in the Apple II world that has not only
""""""""""   showed amazing staying power in a world where this year's
software hit is next year's yawn, but has also gone on to spawn a number
of software companies and magazines that do nothing but sell products for
it.  That program is AppleWorks.  Originally released in 1984 by Apple
Computer, it has gone on to become one of the best selling computer
programs of all time, on ANY computer.  Although few seem to mention the
influence it has had, it is evident in the number of computer programs that
have come out for the IBM and Macintosh that have the "Works" name on them
(Microsoft Works, ClarisWorks, Beagle Works, and others).  AppleWorks was
one of the first "integrated" software packages, preceded on the Apple II
only by The Incredible Jack (published by Business Solutions in 1983; this
program ran under DOS 3.3).  It put modules that performed word processing,
database management, and spreadsheet calculations into a single
environment, using similar commands in each module.  Previous software
programs specialized for each of those jobs had their own unique keyboard
commands that were often very different from each other.  If you went from
Apple Writer to VisiCalc, or from VisiCalc to DB Master, you had to learn a
completely different method of controlling the program.  Furthermore, the
data files created by those programs were usually not compatible with each
other, making it difficult and awkward to move information directly from
one program to another.  AppleWorks not only created a continuity between
these modules, but went a step beyond in allowing them to share data with
each other via a space of memory called a "clipboard".  This clipboard was
part of a larger memory area called a "desktop", which could hold data for
up to twelve different files at the same time, which made data sharing even
more convenient.

     AppleWorks was written by Rupert Lissner (who later changed his first
name to "Robert".<1>)  Its earliest incarnation was in another product
sold by Apple, called QuickFile.  QuickFile was an Apple III database
program written in Pascal.  It was flexible and easy to use, and Apple
agreed to market it for Lissner in 1980.  It was later translated into a
version for the Apple IIe (also in Pascal) called QuickFile IIe.  As a
database program it was flexible and powerful, but somewhat slow due to the
inherent limitations of the UCSD Pascal system that Apple favored at the
time.

     After seeing the Office System on the Lisa computer, Lissner
conceived the idea of a single program that would put word processing,
database, and spreadsheet capabilities together, and run on an Apple II.
It was originally called "Apple Pie", and he began work on it in 1982.
Lissner took two years to complete his program, and did it entirely in
assembly language to achieve better speed.  He wrote versions of the
program to work on both the Apple II and Apple III computers, making use of
the same filetypes and data structures.  Apple Pie files created on an
Apple II could be used on an Apple III, and vice-versa.

     Apple decided to market the Apple II version themselves, and called it 
"AppleWorks".  Lissner was left with the rights to the Apple III version. 
He sold those rights to Haba Systems, who brought it out under the name, 
"/// E-Z Pieces".  That program continued to be compatible with the 
AppleII version up until Claris (the software company formed by Apple in 
1987) upgraded the Apple II AppleWorks to version 3.0 in 1989.


A STAR IS BORN   When it was finally released, AppleWorks was one of the
""""""""""""""   most comprehensive programs ever written for the Apple II. 
Although neither of the three modules were significantly more powerful than 
other standalone programs, they had enough power for the average computer 
user to do what was needed.  The memory management system was the extremely 
flexible, eventually being able to handle not only the basic 128K on a IIe 
or IIc, but also several different types of memory cards used on those 
computers and on the IIgs.  Far larger than the memory of the 64K Apple IIe 
on which it would run (as a minimum memory configuration), the program was 
smart enough to swap in or out from disk the parts it needed to carry out 
its various functions.  Considering that it would run on a computer whose 
microprocessor could address only 64K of memory at one time, the power 
achieved by this program is remarkable.  There are few other software 
packages ever released that have as smoothly and seamlessly made up to two 
megabytes of memory on an 8-bit computer appear to be one contiguous space.

     AppleWorks' user interface was designed with menu bars, rather than 
the older command line interface (such as the one used in Applesoft, 
Integer BASIC, and the Monitor).  Apple's own researchers had put human 
subjects in front of a computer keyboard to learn what was easiest to use. 
They designed an interface that was based on using arrow keys to move a 
cursor (or "bar") to different choices in a list, and then using the return 
key to make the selection.  They also came up with the concept of the 
"desktop" (represented in text rather than in graphics as on the Lisa and 
Macintosh), and a "clipboard" for transferring data between files.  Apple 
shared this information with Lissner, and he went on to use it in his 
program design.<2>


APPLE'S "PROMOTION" OF APPLEWORKS   The marketing decisions made concerning
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   AppleWorks have not been very clear to 
the outside observer over the years.  At the time that AppleWorks was ready 
for release there was a considerable amount of company money and time being 
spent in trying to make the Macintosh sell in the computer marketplace.  
Those who had the most influence at Apple were not very interested in a 
"simple" text-based program, when the Mac and its graphic interface was the 
"cutting edge" in technology.  Those people believed that the Mac 
represented the future of Apple, and were not interested in wasting time 
with old Apple II technology in any form.

     Another problem was Apple's past record in selling software.  Tom 
Weishaar made these comments in the November 1987 issue of Open-Apple:

"...Apple was trying very hard to get the big MS-DOS developers to work 
with the Macintosh.  One of the reasons these developers gave for their 
reluctance to work on the Mac was their fear that Apple itself would 
compete with them -- Apple, obviously, had tremendous advantages in terms 
of distribution and access to inside information.  Apple had a reputation 
for developing applications software for its machines that would kill the 
market for similar software -- Apple Writer (which was at the top of the 
Apple II software charts at the time) and a complete set of applications 
software for the Lisa being major examples.  Powerful voices inside Apple 
wanted the company to get out of the applications software business."<3>

     However, despite the concern about Apple selling AppleWorks, the 
decision was eventually made.

"Apple's punishment for its indiscretion was immediate -- within six weeks 
its illegitimate child sat at the top of the Apple II best-seller list. 
AppleWorks achieved this without the benefits of a mother's love -- it 
succeeded in spite of, not because of, Apple's meager marketing efforts in 
its behalf.  Since AppleWorks was released, for example, Apple has run 26 
pages of ads in A+ magazine.  The word 'AppleWorks' appears in those ads 
exactly zero times.  Four of the ads show screen shots of AppleWorks ... 
the Apple IIgs ad in the September 1987 A+ [shows a screen shot of] 
AppleWorks ... in the gutter between the pages and is the only one of the 
23 programs shown that isn't mentioned by name.  This is typical of the 
treatment Apple's bastard child gets from its mother.  [Del] Yocam, 
[Apple's Executive Vice-President in 1987], didn't mention it or Lissner in 
his birthday speech [at the 1987 AppleFest, celebrating the tenth 
anniversary of the Apple II], and John Sculley, Apple's president, doesn't 
mention it or Lissner in his ... book, Odyssey."<3>

     When it first appeared on the market, AppleWorks STARTED at number 2 
on Softalk's top thirty list.  It moved to the number one spot in Apple 
sales by the following month, and stayed there for a LONG time.  By the end 
of 1984, AppleWorks had moved into the number one spot in monthly retail 
software sales for ALL computers, overtaking the MS-DOS best-seller Lotus 
1-2-3 (a spreadsheet program with graphics and rudimentary word processing 
capabilities).  Some reports estimate that it was selling thirty to forty 
thousand copies per month at one time.<10>  But since it was not their 
beloved Macintosh that put an Apple program into first place, corporate 
Apple ignored the milestone.  Since that time, though no longer in first 
place, AppleWorks has continued to do very well, despite an absence of 
advertising on the part of Apple, and minimal advertising on the part of 
Claris.<3>


APPLEWORKS REVISIONS   The first change to AppleWorks came with the
""""""""""""""""""""   released of version 1.1 in 1985, which was a 
modification to help overcome problems with non-Apple printers and 
interface cards.  Later that year version 1.2 came out with the ability to 
use more easily even more of this non-Apple hardware.  Both relatively 
minor updates were made available free of charge to existing owners of the 
program.

     Version 1.3 of AppleWorks came out in early 1986 for a $20 update fee. 
It provided a bit more functionality for those users who had larger 
capacity disk drives.  Specifically, it better supported the new UniDisk 
3.5 for file storage and made it possible to format disks on that device. 
Previous versions could load files from 3.5 disks only by specifying the 
ProDOS pathname; version 1.3 could access these disks with the more 
familiar slot and drive numbers.  Also, since Apple now sold a large memory 
card which would plug into any free slot on the Apple IIe, this new version 
of AppleWorks could expand the size of the desktop to as much as 1,012K. By 
this time, Applied Engineering and other companies had already been doing 
quite well selling RAM cards for the auxiliary slot on the IIe, and had 
also included special software that patched previous AppleWorks versions to 
allow a larger desktop.  They went further than Apple, however, in also 
allowing larger word processing and database files to be created.<4>

     Up through the release of AppleWorks 1.3, the only changes that had 
been made were bug fixes and enhancements to work better with new hardware. 
In September 1986, along with announcements about the new Apple IIgs, Apple 
released version 2.0 of AppleWorks.  It now required a minimum of 128K 
(previous versions would work with 64K, but allowed only a 10K desktop). In 
exchange for the greater memory requirements, it gave users a built-in 
ability to do mail merge, added more functions to the spreadsheet, and 
supported Apple memory cards even better than v1.3.  Furthermore, word 
processing, database, and spreadsheet files could be larger than in 
previous versions.  Existing users were able to upgrade to v2.0 for $50, 
which included a completely new manual, a very reasonable price considering 
the extra abilities of this new version.<5>

     July 1987 saw one change that had an impact on future distribution of 
AppleWorks.  Apple decided to create a separate company, named "Claris", to 
handle some of the popular software that they had released for their 
AppleII and Macintosh computers over the years.  As mentioned above, 
products released by Apple had a tendency to be the "kiss of death" for 
third-party companies trying to market similar programs.  For example, 
after the outstanding success of AppleWorks, virtually NO text-based work 
processors released for the Apple II made much of an impact on the market.  
Claris had the responsibility of handling AppleWorks, Apple Writer, and the 
various Macintosh programs that had been available from Apple for that 
computer.

     Claris has publicized AppleWorks via only three major ads since they 
took the product over from Apple (as mentioned above, however, AppleWorks 
had previously received NO advertising space).  Their first promotion, run 
in 1987, stated that AppleWorks 2.0 had received a unique upgrade -- its 
own company.  This was primarily a plug for Claris, of course.  The second 
ad was rather clever.  This one had a white background with a red sports 
car up on blocks with its wheels missing.  The caption read, "There are 
still some Apple II users who don't have AppleWorks", suggesting that 
working without that program was like owning a sports car without wheels. 
Beagle Bros did an even more clever followup to that ad, by using another 
double-page spread with a white background, and four tires in the same 
location as the blocks in Claris' ad.  Their ad read, "There are still some 
AppleWorks users who don't have TimeOut", suggesting that the sports car in 
the Claris ad was AppleWorks, and TimeOut was the wheels for that car.  The 
third promotion run by Claris for the program was to announce the v3.0 
upgrade in 1989.  This one showed an old worn tennis shoe (representing the 
old version) and a new running show (representing the new version).

     A free update of AppleWorks to version 2.1 was released by Claris in 
September 1988.  It provided IIgs users some bug fixes that made it work 
better on that computer, plus it was supposed to support a desktop as big 
as eight megabytes, if that much memory was installed.  However, because of 
the way in which desktop memory in AppleWorks was handled, this turned out 
instead to be a maximum of two megabytes.  No further functionality was 
added to AppleWorks at that time.


APPLEWORKS 3.0   In 1988, while Claris was issuing its minor update to
""""""""""""""   AppleWorks, they were making plans to do some major 
improvements to the program.  Since they primarily had Macintosh 
programmers working for them, they first asked Robert Lissner, the original 
author.  He wasn't much interested, since he had already made good money 
off the program and didn't really have the motivation for such a major 
project.  Claris then decided to turn to a third-party company to do the 
work for their project, which was given the code-name "Spike".  There were 
planning to hire a company named Pinpoint Publishing to do the work. 
Pinpoint was selling an enhancement package for AppleWorks that gave users 
some features that MS-DOS users had available on their computers (a 
"pop-up" calendar, terminal program, and other modules), and seemed to be 
making a major effort to promote their product and stimulate more sales of 
AppleWorks.  By this time, however, Pinpoint was financially getting into 
trouble, with sales of their products (AppleWorks-related and otherwise) 
below what was needed to support the large user support network they had 
set up.  Consequently, they were eager for the chance to contract out to 
Claris for the AppleWorks upgrade.  However, they planned to make very 
minimal changes to it, staying exclusively within Claris' specifications.

     During this time, Claris kept hearing from AppleWorks users who were 
much more loyal to Beagle Bros, who had a series of products called 
TimeOut.  These products worked in a fashion similar to those from 
Pinpoint.  After some complicated negotiations that nearly fell through 
several times, Beagle finally took on the job to do the AppleWorks project 
for Claris.  Beagle programmers Alan Bird, Randy Brandt and Rob Renstrom 
worked on it for almost a year, in between a few other projects that were 
going on at the same time.  They did their work on Macintosh II computers 
running the MPW (Macintosh Programmer's Workshop) cross-assembler, 
primarily for the sake of speed.<6>  As enthusiastic Apple II programmers 
who also knew AppleWorks inside and out, Beagle's team added a lot of power 
Claris had not planned on in their original specifications.  Occasionally 
they called on Lissner for help in understanding why certain parts of the 
code were written as they were, but all of the work came from these "Beagle 
Boys".  Viewing it almost as a labor of love, they went beyond what they 
were asked to do, and enjoyed making AppleWorks into a program that they 
would want to use.  Randy Brandt stated, "I think it's safe to say the 
AppleWorks 3.0 project yielded the worst hourly rate I've ever made in 
AppleWorks-related programming, but it did give me a lot of insight which 
came in handy on future projects."<7>  Additionally, they fixed over one 
known hundred bugs in AppleWorks 2.1.<8>

     In June 1989, Claris announced the AppleWorks 3.0 upgrade at the 
National Educational Computing Conference in Boston.  The features that 
were added or improved are too numerous to describe here; in brief, it 
added nearly all the things users had wanted the program to do.  It was 
easier to use, it took better advantage of extra memory (going beyond the 
two meg limit on the IIgs), and it was easier to customize special printers 
to work with it.  And it included a new feature that was becoming standard 
in many commercial word processors:  A built-in spelling checker.  Because 
of these extra features, the maximum desktop size on a standard 128K 
AppleII was now reduced to about 40K (down from the original 55K).  Also, 
the program now loaded from TWO double-sided 5.25 disks (or a single 3.5 
disk), instead of the previous one double-sided 5.25 disk.

     Apple had for years included registration cards with their products, 
both hardware and software, to identify the user in Apple's files as an 
owner of that product.  Unfortunately, although they had done a good job at 
including those cards with everything they shipped out, they had done a 
somewhat less satisfactory job of actually compiling the data from those 
cards.  Consequently, Claris really had no available information about who 
was and who was not a "registered" owner of AppleWorks.  They decided that 
they would make an initial upgrade offer of $79 for customers that owned 
ANY previous version of AppleWorks (from v1.0 to v2.1), and through 
A2-Central magazine they even made available a special $99 offer:  An 
A2-Central subscriber could get the program from Claris for that price, 
even if he could not prove previous ownership of AppleWorks.<9>  Later, 
owners of previous versions could still upgrade for $99 if they wanted.

     Since that time, unhappily, Claris has concentrated exclusively on 
Macintosh products and apparently has no plans for further updates or 
upgrades to AppleWorks.  This was unfortunate, since there were several 
known bugs in the program, and Beagle Bros programmer Mark Munz eventually 
decided to release his own AppleWorks bug-patcher program into the public 
domain to correct these known problems.  Rather than take the hint and make 
a v3.1 release to officially acknowledge and correct these problems, 
Claris' policy was to simply wait until a customer complained about them 
and then to direct them to Mark's Patcher program.


ENHANCEMENTS: PINPOINT   AppleWorks has been such a major influence in the
""""""""""""""""""""""   Apple II world that the program has itself spawned 
a number of related products that act to enhance or expand its usability 
for different purposes.  This is a reflection on the widespread penetration 
of the program, as well as the desire of Apple II users for more and better 
features.

     One of the first customization features that appeared for AppleWorks 
was from Pinpoint Publishing.  They had originally been called Virtual 
Combinatics, and had sold a program for the Apple II called Micro Cookbook. 
Suddenly in 1985 they burst upon the market with a new name and a 
significant new product.  Their Pinpoint Desk Accessories was primarily an 
enhancement for AppleWorks, though it was also possible to install its 
features for use under Applesoft, and eventually Apple Writer and Word 
Perfect.  Taking after the popularity of "pop-up desktop" programs for the 
IBM PC like Sidekick, Pinpoint added some similar features to AppleWorks. 
These features were available at any time, simply by pressing solid-apple 
and P (option-P on the IIgs).  At this point a little "Accessories" menu 
would pop-up onto the screen, drawn using MouseText characters, and the 
desired feature was selected by moving the cursor bar up and down the list, 
pressing RETURN for the one you wanted (working just like AppleWorks).  The 
accessories included Appointment Calendar; Calculator; Communications (a 
small terminal program for use with a modem, which could send AppleWorks 
word processing files or save incoming text as a WP file); Dialer (just 
highlight on the screen the number you wanted to call, and it would be 
dialed for you via the modem); GraphMerge (which allowed you to print a 
word processing document with all or part of a double hi-res picture 
included with the text); Notepad (a miniature word processor, holding up to 
32 lines of text and saving notes in AppleWorks WP format); QuickLabel 
(take an address off the screen and place it on an envelope template for 
printing); and Typewriter (type and print lines one at a time).  This was 
all very exciting at the time, multiplying the abilities of AppleWorks 
beyond what it was built to do.  Because of disk-space requirements this 
was more convenient to use from a 3.5 disk or hard disk, but actually could 
be used from 5.25 disks without TOO much trouble.  Eventually a spelling 
checker was also made available to use with Pinpoint.
