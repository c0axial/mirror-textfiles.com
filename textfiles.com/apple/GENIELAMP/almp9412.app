            >>> THIS YEAR ENDS, 30 DAYS -- REDUCE SPEED NOW <<<
            """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    In Which We Continue the Cruise Control Metaphor of Last Month, and
                    Shift Smoothly into a Holiday Mood


     Not so many months ago, I was hurrying home in my car, knowing that I 
would disappoint my wife and myself if I were late.  We both work long, 
hard hours, my wife and I, and it's rare that we have time to do something 
frivolous together, like watch television or go to a movie.  We had made a 
date for that night.  Minutes were precious.

     Naturally, that night of all nights, the monthly meeting of our 
annual Apple II user group ran late.  I kept edging toward the door, trying 
to get away.  Finally, I simply bolted.

     I leapt into the driver's seat and started the engine.  Not even 
taking a moment to check my watch, I nudged the speedometer needle past the 
posted limit and headed for home.  Only when I reached a stop light did I 
look at my watch.  My heart sank.  To be on time, I needed five more 
minutes than I had.

     The fables I had read in my childhood joined hands and danced in a 
circle around my head.  Never give up before you try.  Have confidence in 
yourself, and the impossible can be possible.  Our fates are in ourselves.  
When the light turned green, I trod on the accelerator...

     ...until I reached the speed limit.  Then I turned on the cruise 
control.  Those childhood fables make great servants, but poor masters.

     I wanted badly to be home on time.  But it was no longer possible, 
and I refused to kill myself trying.  The more nervous I get about time 
pressures, the worse my driving gets, and that's a vicious circle.  Clearly 
it was time to restrain my haste, using the cruise control to enforce that 
restraint.

     Don't I make myself sound mature?  Don't I make myself sound wise?  
Well, the truth is, at the age of 33, this was probably the first time I 
had enough sense to see the bigger picture in a crisis situation.  Arriving 
home late is bad, but having an accident is worse.  (Even if you don't kill 
someone else, even if you don't kill yourself, even if no one is 
hospitalized, even if no one even has to go to the emergency department for 
a quick examination to be sure they're all right... do you have any idea 
how much hassle is created by the aftermath of putting a dent in your own 
car's fender?)  I got home five minutes late.  We had to scrap our plans 
and make new ones on the spot, but my wife and I both survived with our 
good moods intact.

     It's sad how often we confuse the urgent and the important.  If on 
Monday morning, one client says he'll pay me $1000 for a project due in two 
weeks and on Monday afternoon, another client says he'll pay me $25 for a 
project due in one week, I'm liable to start work on the $25 job because 
it's more urgent.  If my wife has a midterm worth 30% on Friday, and has a 
1% assignment given her that's due on Thursday, chances are she'll start 
work on the assignment.  We keep ourselves so busy that we don't even 
realize there is a difference between important deadlines and urgent ones, 
much less try to discern it.

     The holiday season does a particularly good job of underlining the 
difference between the important and the urgent.  Several years ago, the 
city in which I lived had a power blackout on Christmas day.  I had 
computer games and plenty of other impressive toys--nothing succeeds like 
excess--none of which counted for anything with no electricity.  All of a 
sudden, the gift that meant most to me was a simple hand-knit sweater from 
my girlfriend.  Meanwhile, what about Christmas dinner?  The turkey had 
already been in the oven for an hour when the power died.  A phone call 
from an aunt just a few blocks away revealed that she had power.  Could she 
possibly make room in her oven for our turkey as well?  Of course she 
could, and did.  (Don't ask me how.)

     A lot of the things we intended to do that Christmas day--urgent but 
not important--never got done.  We were honorably relieved from many of the 
self-imposed, false responsibilities and competition of the holiday season.  
We were warm, we had a hot meal, we had friends and relatives willing to 
help us out, and we were together.  Gifts beyond price.

     I still have the sweater that meant so much to me that Christmas.  
It's too small for me now, but of course I can't get rid of it.

     Because my wife is wearing it.

the current issue of NAUG's Forum has a patch to defeat that patch if

Ultra if AppleTalk is connected is separate, and has been around with 4.0

MACINTOSH SOUNDS ON THE IIGS   Well, Steve is right, but that ain't why 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   some of those files won't convert or play, 
Dave.  MacSoundGrabber (MSG) has (IMHO) a _very_ annoying limitation--it 
can only load & convert Mac sound resources that are 64K in size or 
smaller.  (Notice I did not say sound files--like the rSoundsample format 
on the IIGS, a file can contain more than one sample.)  As long as the 
_samples_ you wanna convert are 64K or smaller, MSG will do a dandy job of 
converting them into rSoundsample format on the IIGS.  If the sounds you 
want are bigger than 64K, other things will have to be done.  If you're a
GS+ subscriber, the program FileDump (in GS+ V5.N1) is a great help in 
converting sounds that MSG can't do.  For more info, refer to my article 
"Catch the .WAV" in GS+ V4.N6.

     FWIW, I have converted several of the AudioClips packages into rSound 
format for use with the IIGS.  Two of these packages (Star Trek: The 
Logical Collection and Terminator 2: Judgement Day) are sold directly thru 
Sound Source Interactive and can be ordered from them directly at (800) 
877-4778.  If you have any of the following packages bought in Mac or 
Windows format, _and can supply me with proof of purchase_, I can send you 
the package already converted for use on an Apple IIGS.  The packages I 
have available are:

          2001: A Space Odyssey
          Star Trek Bonus AudioClips
          Star Trek: The Next Generation "Encounter at Farpoint"

IMAGEWRITER II ON AN IBM PC?   I have a question for a friend who owns an 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Imagewriter II Printer.  She wants to run it 
on an IBM PC.  She tells me that she has a driver for an Imagewriter II in 
some sort of IBM word processing program.  She teaches and uses IIe's and 
an IBM.  Her goal is to connect the Imagewriter II with a switch box to use 
with both machines.

     Does anyone have any experience with this type of set up?  I have 
hooked up many IBM or Parallel Printers, Including a Quietwriter to a IIe, 
I have no experience with anyone hooking up an Imagewriter II to an IBM 
rig.

>>>>>   I have no experience with connecting an Imagewriter II to a PC, but
"""""   I do have a book in front of me now that explains how to do it.  On 
page 212 of _Macintosh Printer Secrets_ (1990) by Larry Pina, it claims 
that despite some people saying this connection can't be made, "it _can_ be 
done, very easily."  On the next 4 pages, Pina describes how to build the 
cable, how to set the Imagewriter II dip switches, and how to put in the 
needed MS-DOS MODE command (no, the driver does not take care of that, 
according to Pina). To tell you the truth, it doesn't sound easy to me, but 
Pina's explanation should be understandable to anyone who is conversant 
with terms like CONFIG.SYS, XT, and AT.

     Pina's explanation is too long to reproduce here.  If your friend 
can't find the book in your public library (I think it is out of print), 
email me your or her address and I'll send a copy of the relevant pages.

     By the way, I bought Pina's book a few months ago on remainder because 
it has lots of good Apple-II-relevant information on the printer I use, the 
Imagewriter II.

BIG RED COMPUTER CLUB AFTERMATH?   As everyone knows by now, Big Red

doors by the end of the year.

     The owner of Big Red, John Wrenholt, has been actively supporting the 
Apple II computer for more than a dozen years, and he does not want BRCC 
members to feel abandoned or to feel that BRCC's closure will leave Apple 
II owners without any avenues for support.

     For that reason, BRCC has included a 12 page sampler issue of 
Shareware Solutions II inside their November, 1994 mailing. That mailing 
has been sent out via bulk mail, so it may take anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks 
to reach its destination.

     The Shareware Solutions II sampler is an abridged version of the 
Volume 2, Issue 1 edition.

     If you are a BRCC member who is seeing Shareware Solutions II for the 
very first time, feel free to post questions here about Shareware Solutions 
II, or feel free to direct questions to the publisher in e-mail directed

     Other products are merely distributed by BRCC, such as software from 
Triad Ventures and Seven Hills. If someone else wanted to distribute those, 
they'd need to contact the owners and make an offer.

     In talking to John Wrenholt just the other day, he doesn't anticipate 
having a whole lot of inventory left. After all, his "going out of business 
sale" is just too good to pass up - BRCC is selling games like Pac Man for 
$3.50. I think that BRCC expects to sell off just about all their inventory 
with pricing like that. And, if they don't, I can't imagine that any other 
software distributor would really be interested in "picking them up."

you really ought to do it now. The software may not be available from

     I do that every day. There's a one-byte patch that will allow UM to 
be active while AppleTalk is active. With AW4.3 I have had no crashes 
regardless of how it is launched. With earlier versions I had to launch AW 
from ProSel-16 to keep from crashing.

     I have an article in the current NAUG AppleWorks Forum that describes 
the patch and how to apply it. If you don't have that, let me know and I'll 
e-mail it.

<<<<<   > I don't know why Dan Crutcher can use macros with AppleTalk, but 
"""""   > I've never seen it succeed

     I don't know either, since I don't do anything special (other than 
apply the patch that Randy provided that allows UM to be active at the same 
time as AppleTalk). I boot into ProSel-8, then, if I want to use GS/OS, I 
launch GS/OS which is set to run ProSel-16. From there I can go straight to 
AW4.3, with AppleTalk active, and use macros to my heart's content.

     Just a few minutes ago, I went through that process, and even 
launched Finder first and opened a Macintosh volume (via AppleTalk) in the 
Finder and then launched AW4.3. I ran about five complex macros 
(CheckWorks, a phone dialer, etc.) with no problems.

     I do the same at work. Each of my machines is a ROM 01 GS.

     I can't believe I'm the only one who can do this. If my being able to 
do it is unusual, I would suspect that my route through ProSel may have 
something to do with it.

     For anyone who has a block editor, here's the patch to allow 
UltraMacros to be active at the same time as AppleTalk:

     PATCH APLWORKS.SYSTEM TO ALLOW MACROS WITH APPLETALK ACTIVE:

     The current APLWORKS.SYSTEM disallows macros with AT active. Patch it 
with a disk editor by changing offset +142B from EE to 2C. If +142B is_not_ 
EE in your version, search for EE 96 0A in that approximate area.

     Try it. If it doesn't work, you can always reverse it by changing the 
byte back to EE.

short, all fax modems will work with Faxination, unless somebody can find a 
_real_ oddball out there that just won't respond to the standard Class 1 or 
2 modem commands. 

     Faxination will handle Group III encoding (a software function) and 
will work with all of the modem brands mentioned so far in this topic.

SOUNDMEISTER STATUS   I never in _any_ dream, not just my wildes't ones, 
"""""""""""""""""""   ever imagined it would take this long to get this 
card 'done'.

     Yes, the connector problem has been solved, cables are being built 
and cards are shipping, some people who ordered very recently got cards 
because they ordered other things as well, and we don't like to ship 
partial orders unless we really need to. For the most part, back orders are 
being filled on a date taken basis, those that had checks/money orders 
(payment attached) have been processed first due to time limits on some 
checks/money orders and then those that have payment info on the order 
sheet allready, (credit card info or school PO present). 

     Overall, I'm very pleased with the outcome, I strongly recommend 
using a good pair of non-amplified bookshelf speakers or other type cabinet 
speakers and letting the onboard amp do the work. The output is much nicer. 
If your going to hook the card into an audio system, it has a  true line 
level out signal. 

     Due to noise present in some GS systems, particulary ROM 01 boards, 
it gets amplified by the speakers if you use powered speakers. 

     The SoundMeister comes with Digital Session 1.0, which is a 'release' 
version of the last version that Econ shipped with the card, no new 
features have been added, all known (reported) bugs have been fixed, with 
one exception: Neither Econ or I was able to recreate a bug reported by a 
user when editing large files on the disk instead of  using available RAM 
only. We belive it was related to that users particular system setup with 
reference to installed inits, etc..

     The price of the card is $69.00 and $84.95 with a small set of 
speakers. Allthough the speakers we supply are the powered type, I 
recommend connecting them to the amplified output and using them that way.  
They have been tested that way, and work 100%. In addition, there are 
volume controls located on the speakers and they are functional in this 
configuration.

     An additional note: SoniqTracker v.63 has a built in volume control 
from the player. It supports the SoundMeister card. You can digitize with 
software other than Digital Session, such as AudioZap or the SuperSonic 
digitizer application program as well. SoundShop (shipped w/HyperStudio) 
should work as well, allthough I have not tried it. The SoundMeister will 
work in conjunction with the HyperStudio slotless digitizer card.

Steve

                          YMM Beta Change List

Known Bugs   Fields on the Continuous Checks without Voucher need to be 
''''''''''   moved.

     There are no 'Window Options' at this point (and may not be).

     Selecting Records Thermometer for Transaction Report and possible 
other windows/reports is not showing up?  Makes it appear that the program 
is locked up.

     Account window form layouts and maybe other form (verses normal list 
format) have shifted down and shading is overlaying some of the lines.

     Change font and cancel change font selects a bogus tiny/tiny font.

Other Planned changes for this release   Change the accumulation in the 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   reports, so that an increase in a 
liability type base account will show up as a descrease and via-versa.  The 
down side of this change is if you are reporting by base account, subtotals 
for liability type base accounts will show a subtotal for charges as 
decreases and for credits as increases (which is what they do to your 
networth but not to the base account).  Plus it is not what Credit and 
Charge say they do in the Transaction Type window.

     Add ability to set beginning and ending month for Account Report.

     Add Annual Total to the Account Monthly report (it currently prints 
only Jan to Dec).

     Change Report Margins.

     Add logic to support Epson printers better with text output.

Changes   Allow you to double click on a datafile name and have it 
'''''''   automatically start up YMM.

     Recognize and act on repeat mouse hold down actions.

     Allow you to change the font for reports and windows

     Changed the Acct List to include Beginning Balance

     Fix Bug with New File and Start with No Accounts

     Fix Bug with OA-Valid and extended file

     Fix Bug with non-Calander Fiscal Year

     Made sure that ValidFileTotals corrects problems with non-January 
Fiscal starting month.

     Automatically update data file to next version and automatically 
invoke the Validate logic the first time the file is opened and updated to 
this version.

     Changed the keys for doing YMM Valid from Option-OpenApple-C to 
OpenApple-Shift-Control-C.  Same goes for 'O' (toggle output), 'G' toggle 
super hires graphics, 'T' toggle trace, and ' ' (toggle pause).

     Ask whether a transaction is to be added at the end of a split or to 
start a new transaction.

     Changed the account monthly window so you can change the Cleared 
Balance but not the Actual Balance

     No longer Able to Select All if Split Unbalanced

     Add Menu Dialog to Allow input of Dollar Sign or other monetary 
symbol.

     Also, change the size of report headers to be based upon the size of 
the large fontid size.

     Changed program to allow you to toggle split transactions on and off 
in the reports, just like the transaction window.

     Note:  If you want to print a list of transaction by distribution 
account and you want split transactions to be included you can sort and 
subtotal on distribution account and then select distribution account not 
equal Split. This will cause all of the split transaction to sort and be 
displayed along with the other non split transactions by distribution 
account.

     Fixed automatic input of remaining split amount.  Before if you 
blanked out an existing amount it often times didn't split the amount 
correctly.

     Fixed quit insert with unbalanced split amount.  Before, it was 
possible for the program to miscalculate the split amount and if so you 
could quit inserting a split transaction with an unbalanced split amount.

     Now, I allow them to paste calculator results when entering a split 
transaction.

     Changed ValidFileTotals so that it is executed when a new version of 
the YMM datafile is created and the changes are automatically saved.

     Changed ValidFileTotals so that it displays messages as it is 
checking the file.

     Fixed problem with quitting insert with just one record causing the 
record to not get deleted.

     Fixed problem with a deleted account (number 3) getting used even 
after it was deleted as the default base account.

     Fixed Invest text report, seems to be printing the account name twice?

     Fixed bug which could cause two different memo and/or payee fields to 
overlay each other. Was due to SaveAs compressing out and deleteing a 
memo/payee that was still in use.

     Save As will lose investment information unless that file has been 
accesed by opening an investment window. Fixed SaveAs lossing Investment 
information

     Fixed so that you can change account type for the third account.

     Changed the logic for checking the number of split transactions to 
hopefully stop the occasional but not reproductable loop when adding the 
first transaction.

SOUNDMEISTER _PRO_   At this point, it's still up in the air, but there are 
""""""""""""""""""   two parts to it that alarm me: 1) The cost of the 
blank PCB itself, to get it down to a livable level, I would have to make 
250 + boards. The additional parts, it uses all the parts that the original 
card uses plus 8 additional IC's, which alone cost $30 more. We would have 
to buy in lots of 300 to get that  additional price down to $20 or so. 

     I have not to date, built a SMP board. I have the remains of the last 
working prototype. In this form, it requires a standard SM board to be 
present and connected to it. (Which in itself, is NOT a bad idea, IMHO) but 
not everything functions the way it should that way, and it would still 
require almost 2/3rds of what the original one does, so there is no sense 
in building them as an addon. I have the 'finished' board  schematic/flow 
chart/theory of operation. So, at this point, technicaly this is an un- 
finished product, it exhists in 'test  proving/theory' form hardware only 
and paper only. As a company, we can not invest any more time into it, 
however, on my own time, it's something I'm going to to try to get 
finished. The schematic needs to verified and entered into a capture 
program so that a netlist can be made and a PCB layed out. That is no 
simple task, infact, it takes many many many hours, and other such time 
spent staring at a monitor. I really shouldn't even be saying too much, 
but... 

     It is my goal to get one built, to determine feasability, at best and 
see how well it really can work. I have NO software for it other than what 
DigitalSession supports, (no direct to disk digitizing) so I can not 
promise anything in that dept. What I can say for the most part of it now 
is, _IF_ any type of SMP board ever sees the light of 'market', it will be 
a limited production, more than likly, in a kit form where you would be on 
your own as to getting some of the IC's. One reason for this is 'freedom of 
choice' (Sorry, 7-11), as I see the current design, it appears to be vrey 
flexible in what size buffered FiFo you can use, as well as the A/D 
converter chips. It requires two of each, one for left/right channels.

     I must also state at this time, the SMP was not part of the deal with 
the standard SM board. My dealings with the SMP have nothing what so ever 
to do with AEC and I can not spend company time dealing with it as such. 
Like I said, I have every bit of an intention of somehow trying to make 
something happen, and only then, when something is 100% ready to go, can I 
deal with it as AEC. As it currently stands, I have been spending some time 
going over the materials I have, I am very excited about what I have seen, 
yes, it's too bad ECON didn't bring it to market, but I too, have realized, 
it's still too far from being done to even think about it. There is atleast 
a month of fulltime days worth of work to be done. Something I don't have, 
and can't even begin to see time being available during the day to do, with 
all that goes on during a normal day (abnormal for most others) here. We 
are still working on some other Apple II products, and I'm still building 
SoundMeister cards every day, as I have been for the past month. 

     ...and I've also got this BBS program to work on. at home. :)  Not 
that I am complaining... the Apple II is fun! ...and I want a SMP board to 
add to my collection of other stuff that 'doesn't exhist' in my collection 
that could be called _the_ Smithsonian of Apple II, and /// !

     BTW: Anyone want to give a shot at an  AAtari 2600 emulator for the 
GS?? Just think of all the classic gaming fun that could be had!!!

     Mark and Ron echo my feelings pretty closely.  I am not pleased with 
Apple's practices or their support (up here in Canada, anyway) these days 
and I had decided that I would not buy any more Apple products new; only 
used, if at all.  So when I started to feel the desire for a portable 
machine, I got stuck in a bit of an ethical delimma.  I would not buy an 
Intel-based system, and there is no portable Apple II solution.  I started 
looking for used PowerBooks, but eventually ended up getting a new PB Duo 
from a shop in Toronto, because it was a closeout and the price was better 
than any of the used prices I had seen.

     My philosophy now is that I hope to get into programming on the Mac 
and work with a friend of mine who likes PCs, and hopefully broaden my 
market for my future software products, thereby allowing me to continue to 
develop for the machine I prefer, even though it is not the most profitable 
thing to do.  In effect, I'll be _using_ the Mac and Windows users to 
finance my Apple II projects! :-)

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

   [P.SHAPIRO1]



               >>> SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT ONLINE MENTORING <<<
               """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Last month a high school student casually asked me a question dealing 
with genetics.  I'm no genetics expert, but I can pass myself off well to 
someone who is just beginning to learn genetics.  (If you mumble things 
about DNA, RNA, and recessive genes you can pretty much answer any 
introductory question in genetics.)

     Having answered this person's question, I mentally patted myself on 
the back.  As I was leaving the room I yelled back to the student, "If you 
have any other genetics questions, send them on to me via E-mail.  If I 
can't answer them myself, I'll forward them to my colleague Watson."

     While this last remark was made flippantly, on the spur of the 
moment, later I came to reflect upon what I said.  It is indeed possible to 
send E-mail to James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of DNA.  Watson is 
the current director of the Human Genome Project, working at the National 
Institutes of Heath.  (You can probably reach him at jwatson@nih.gov, or 
somesuch, if your kid needs a little help before his next biology quiz.)

     Imagine if Watson, in a moment of gleeful exuberance, decided to 
invite high school students with interesting genetics questions to send him 
e-mail.

     Watson, himself, wouldn't have to answer all the questions. He'd get 
some first-year lab assistant to churn out pleasant sounding answers to the 
majority of incoming questions.  But that same lab assistant could flag 
down the most interesting sounding questions, which could then be forwarded 
directly to Watson's mailbox.

     The result?  A humble high school biology student could have the 
possibility of having his or her genetics question answered by the 
co-discoverer of DNA.

     Here's another scenario.  How about if there were some junior high 
school student who had a passionate interest in astrophysics?  In this day 
of electronic communication the possibility remains open that a junior high 
school student could test his or her ideas against the best of them.  If 
his or her question were indeed probing, an E-mail response might arrive 
from Sir Stephen Hawking.

     Just as exhilarating as it is for youngsters to be able to easily ask 
questions of professionals in a particular field, so to is the satisfaction 
that results when professionals are able to provide answers to young 
inquiring minds.  The E-mail dialogue doesn't have to occur with a famous 
scientist for the exchange to be meaningful.

     Truth is, many professionals would welcome the opportunity to 
converse online with youngsters interested in their field.  If you're an 
adult working long hours at your desk, it can be a welcome relief to spend 
a minute or two answering the question posed by an 8th grader in 
Woodbridge, Virginia--or the query from a high school student in Parker, 
Colorado.

     Every working adult in this country has the newfound capability of 
being an online mentor.  As a volunteer activity, the mentor can devote as 
much or as little time as he or she pleases.  Given the emotional rewards 
of being able to interact with a growing mind, chances are that mentors 
would allocate just a bit more time than they really should to online 
mentoring activities.

     The above examples all cited mentoring possibilities in the sciences, 
but the possibilities for online mentoring in the arts are equally 
tantalizing.  Imagine the thrill of an aspiring violist in receiving e-mail 
from one of the world's virtuoso violin players.  Or an aspiring fine 
artist receiving feedback on his or her art from someone known 
internationally for their creative work.  Or an aspiring writer receiving 
writing pointers from someone who spent a few months on the New York Times 
bestseller's list.

     When two minds communicate, the result can be magic.  After all, the 
most fertile field for any mind to grow in is a field of other minds.

The Authors   This book is a winner.  It sets out to accomplish ambitious 
"""""""""""   goals and hits its target in chapter after chapter.

     Co-authored by two veteran technology reporters, The Internet 
Business Guide reads like a Michelin travel guidebook.  It takes you by the 
hand to enchanted lands and shows you that the local customs are not that 
bewildering after all.

     Who are the authors of the book?  Rosalind Resnick is a former Miami 
Herald business reporter, who has written for The New York Times, Forbes, 
Nation's Business, and Internet World.  She currently writes a syndicated 
newspaper column, CyberBiz, addressing the very subject of this book:  
doing business in cyberspace.

     Providing a counterpoint to Resnick's "business suit" point of view 
is counter-culture journalist Dave Taylor, who enjoys cooking gourmet 
vegetarian food and has a child named "Karma."  Taylor himself is no slouch 
when it comes to writing, having published 500 articles and two other 
computer books in the past few years.

Restrained Hype   When covering a subject such as business possibilities on 
"""""""""""""""   the Internet, there is a temptation for books to hype the 
possibilities of everything and anything.  While you'll find the occasional 
hyped comment in this book, for the most part the authors exercise 
commendable restraint.  (And Resnick and Taylor keep exclamation marks to a 
merciful minimum.  Perhaps they had advance notice of the Congressional 
bill proposing to place heavy taxes on the use of exclamation marks in 
books about the Internet.)

     After all, people do not read a business guide to the Internet to 
help them make up their minds about whether business possibilities exist on 
the Internet.  They read such books to unearth practical information about 
how such business possibilities can be developed and implemented.

The Blessings of Electronic Mail   You hear so much hype about the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   multimedia possibilities for the 
Internet that you might well forget how gosh-darn useful regular old E-mail 
can be.  E-mail is sure to remain one of the most useful of all business 
tools.  The authors of this guidebook reiterate this point when they say:  
"Much of the traffic on the Internet is electronic mail.  Indeed, it's been 
estimated that well over 4000 messages are sent each second of the day on 
the Internet.  Being able to send messages in seconds to a user anywhere in 
the world is probably the single most important reason so many companies 
find the Internet so appealing." (p. xxv)

     And bucking the trend to wax poetic about the capabilities of Mosaic, 
Resnick and Taylor tell it like it is:  "Graphical browsers such as Mosaic 
can be difficult to install, and as Rosalind knows from her experience in 
accessing Mosaic through a 486 PC and a 14,400 bps modem, the program can 
be as slow as molasses when retrieving large amounts of graphics." (p. 115)

     Bravo.  Score one for candor and honesty.  Mosaic has great potential 
down the line, to be sure.  But 1994 will not be the year it becomes widely 
used.

E-mail Technical Support   Computer manufacturers and software publishers 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   have frequently been the first businesses to put 
the Internet to use.  In the chapter titled "Customer Support," the authors 
cite the example of Sun Microsystems' overwhelmingly successful online 
support project:  "In August, 1993, Sun Microsystems, a Mountain View, 
California, workstation manufacturer, launched a program called SunSolve to 
answer its customers' technical questions through Internet e-mail....  In 
the year since SunSolve was introduced, use of the toll-free telephone 
support line has dropped by 90 percent, and the company has cut support 
costs by $1,000,000 a year." (p. 234)

     Don't you love it?  The Internet has helped Sun slice toll-free phone 
costs by 90 percent.  That's a sizable savings by any measure.  And the 
saved money can go directly into providing improved online technical 
support (or to otherwise provide better value/dollar to customers).

     There's a small company in Cupertino that would do well to take note 
of such facts.  Apple Computer apparently receives an average of 11,000 
phone toll-free phone calls per day to their 1-800-SOS-APPLE phone line.  
Apple refuses to disclose how many persons it employs to answer these phone 
calls, but you can make an educated estimate that at least 100 persons are 
employed at Apple's Austin, Texas facility.

     (Here are my rough calculations:  11,000 calls times 5 minutes per 
call is 55,000 minutes.  55,000 minutes is the same as 916 hours.  Divide 
916 hours by an 8 hour work day and you get 115 technical support workers.)

     If Apple were to set up a free Internet e-mail tech support service, 
they might be able to slice their toll-free bills in a major way as well.  
Apple is hoping that their new online service, eWorld, will serve this 
function.  But with fewer than 30,000 subscribers, eWorld might be more 
accurately described as eGhosttown (or eEerie).

Marketing Do's and Don'ts   When you breach the rules of business etiquette 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   in the real world, you risk temporarily losing 
a few customers.  On the other hand, when you breach the rules of business 
etiquette on the Internet, you risk alienating 20 million persons.  In the 
chapter titled "Marketing Do's and Don'ts," Resnick and Taylor explain how 
to not put your foot in your mouth at 14,400 bps:  "On the Internet, the 
traditional rules of sales and marketing are turned upside down.  Not only 
does junk mail fall on deaf ears on the global network, but it often drives 
away customers it was meant to attract.  Slick ad copy with little or no 
informational content just doesn't fly..."  Actually, in this day and age 
slick ad copy can alienate in hardcopy form as well as in electronic form.  
The rules of business etiquette are changing for the better -- both online 
and offline.
 
FAQs:  The Answers to Most of Your Questions   The concept of the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   frequently asked question 
had its birth in the technical fields of the computer world.  But the 
concept has grabbed hold in areas far astray from hardware and software.  
The whole idea behind FAQs is to anticipate commonly asked questions so as 
to provide quick and useful responses.  The nifty thing about FAQs is that 
they save work for everyone, allowing a company's technical support staff 
to concentrate their time on answering the most difficult, uncommon 
questions.

     The authors of this book suggest that one of the best ways of making 
use of FAQ's in a business setting is to set up a "mail reflector" that 
automatically sends out your company's FAQ text file to anyone who 
requestions it via e-mail.  The person inquiring about your company's 
products or services can obtain detailed information about your company's 
products or services for the slight effort of sending an empty e-mail 
message.  (How much effort is required to send an empty Internet e-mail 
message?  About five seconds of your time.  If you're a slower typist, 
maybe ten.)

     From the consumer's point of view, mail reflectors are like instant 
karma.

     The book then goes on to describe the benefits for companies 
specifically in the computer hardware or software business to set up a 
company FTP site.  Doing so provides an easy way to distribute upgrades for 
application and system software.  Larger companies also benefit from the 
USENET newsgroups that are set up for people to share ideas about the 
company's products.

Tread Softly and Carry a Fast Modem   A recurring theme in this guidebook 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   is that businesses who seek to create 
a presence on the Internet would be well advised to tread softly:  "The 
Internet is no different from any other community, and those companies that 
'go native' by brushing up on the network's culture and mores will gain a 
competitive advantage in the electronic marketplace.  Taking time to learn 
about the Internet now can pay big dividends in the future.  If the current 
growth rate is sustained, more than 50,000,000 people will be accessible 
through the Internet by the turn of the century."

     It's refreshing to see this enlightened point of view expressed so 
well.  Sensible businesses on the Internet would do well to heed this 
advice.

Conclusion   All in all, The Internet Business Guide delivers commendably 
""""""""""   on its promise.  Businesses interested in galloping onto the 
Internet might do well to lay down their reins briefly to read this book.  
A comprehensive guide of this sort ought to appeal to the general reading 
population, as well.

                 >>> THE TURBOREZ PROJECT STILL ALIVE! <<<
                 """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

                                                           November 8, 1994

     It would be an understatement to say it's been awhile since there's 
been news from us about the status of the "fabled" TurboRez product.  As 
some of you may know, since the previewing of a prototype at the last two 
Apple Expos, we elected to do an entirely new design based on the use of 
custom gate array technology.  Even though underestimating project 
completion time seems to be a tradition with computer hardware/software 
development, let's just say that even we've been amazed at the degree of 
difficulty involved here.  This project has had an appetite for resources 
(like TIME) that has to be experienced to be appreciated.

     The current status is that, after more than a year of design and 
simulation of the virtual chips, we've got actual hardware up and running.  
This happened just in the last 5-6 weeks and the debugging process is 
proceeding steadily.  So far, the video is looking good and the circuits 
seem stable. 

     Our apologies for not being online with some news sooner.  With the 
pre-announcement situations we've created in the past, it seemed prudent to 
wait until there was new hardware actually in operation before making any 
public statement.  Normally though, given the incomplete state of the 
project at this point, we probably would have waited awhile longer.  The 
announcement of the Second Sight card (by Sequential Systems) has altered 
the marketplace however, hence some earlier information from us.

     On this note, we'll briefly discuss the two products.  Operation in a 
GS with the stock RGB monitor reveals similarities such as 256-color 
pixels, in both 320 and 640 resolution and 400-line interlaced modes.  The 
TurboRez card has a Display List CoProcessor and a high-speed blitter, 
while Second Sight has a microprocessor that does blitter emulation.  Now, 
what about the particular strengths of the two cards?

Comparing The Two   The Second Sight card's strongest suite is when it's 
"""""""""""""""""   coupled to an external SVGA monitor.  Here it offers 
some pretty high resolution, up to 1076 by 768 pixels.  Of course, to 
effectively take advantage of this, you'll really need a 17 or 19 inch 
monitor to avoid eyestrain (price a monitor this size next time you're at a 
computer store).  Second Sight does not offer overscanning.

     The TurboRez card will accept an adaptor that allows attaching a VGA 
monitor and sending out a 640 by 480 image, so it appears we come in second 
in the resolution department.  TurboRez is capable of doing overscan, 
however (vertical and horizontal, together or separately).

Pictures That Move   Where TurboRez does shine is in the area of multimedia
""""""""""""""""""   animation.  It's nice to be able to show pictures on 
the GS that have enhanced color and resolution, but what about bringing 
them to life?  In other words, making them move and flow.  Well, the 
TurboRez card enhances animation on the GS with a host of features.  First, 
of course, the high-speed Blitter for drawing shapes and objects to the 
display very quickly.  Add to that its Multi-Plane Overlay capability and 
Line Drawing (w/Scaling).  Let's talk about those last two.

Multi-Plane Overlay Technology   The Multi-Plane hardware on the TurboRez 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   card is similar in concept to the 
multi-plane techniques used by commercial film animators.  Basically, it 
means having the various elements of the picture, both moving and still, on 
separate "layers".  In TurboRez, this means that moving shapes can be 
placed in separate image layers (or planes) and pass over or under each 
other (or in front of or behind foreground/background objects) without 
"interfering" with the other picture elements.  In a single-plane video 
card (like Second Sight), an animated scene consisting of stacked shapes 
and objects is very slow and messy to update fast enough to present a 
smoothly flowing image.  To alter a shape in the "middle", means not only 
erasing and redrawing that particular shape, but also anything that appears 
above or below it onscreen. To change that one shape requires massive 
amounts of erasing and redrawing even though the neighboring shapes and 
objects are not due to change yet.  All of this activity translates to SLOW 
screen updating.

     TurboRez, with hardware Multi-Plane technology, doesn't suffer from 
these limitations.  With separate image planes, the update process is 
confined to just those shapes and objects that need it at the time.  This 
means no wasted time redrawing things that don't need it!  The result: 
Efficient and FAST animation on your GS (even without a Zip accelerator).

Texture Mapping via Line Drawing w/Scaling   The other major animation 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   enhancer is the Line Drawing 
w/Scaling hardware.  Here we take a common operation like plotting a line 
of pixels and couple it with Scaling logic.  Scaling allows magnifying or 
shrinking a bitmapped shape or object as it's being drawn.  The scaling 
operation can be done by the plotting software but that approach is never 
as fast doing it thru hardware.  By using Scaling along with Line Drawing, 
it's easy to not only alter the drawn size of a source shape but to rotate 
it as well.  Similarly, a drawing technique known as Texture Mapping is 
enhanced using the TurboRez hardware.

     Texture Mapping lets us manipulate a source texture map, which is a 
rectangular, bitmapped image of something, say a picture of woodgrain or 
red brick siding or whatever.  The effect is that it's being stretched 
across the face of some 3D object that's in the onscreen image.  The 
woodgrain might be applied to the floor of the scene and the bricks to a 
fireplace.  Where before there might have been a collection of 3D objects 
with solid-color shaded faces, we would now have objects with realistic 
textures "pasted" onto them. 

     To get a good idea of how effective this technique is, find somebody 
with a 486 PC (50 or 66 mhz) that has the popular program "Doom" and have 
them run it for you.  Now, we at RezTek aren't advocating that all games 
should imitate the shoot-em up premise of Doom, but our purpose here is to 
examine the implementation of a realtime, 3D texture mapped universe in 
which the user can move about freely and interact with.  The effect is 
quite impressive and realistic.  Now imagine something similar running on 
your GS, running at fullscreen size and animating smoothly.  How's that 
going to happen?  Only with a TurboRez GS card, using its hardware enhanced 
Line Drawing w/Scaling.

     While we're talking about features, we'll also mention that 
page-flipping is no problem and there's also support for the GS's NTSC 
video port and planned GenLocking support (for instance; the Apple VOC 
card).

What, Where, When   OK, by now the questions are when and how much.  Well, 
"""""""""""""""""   we've still got quite a bit of work to do to get this 
ready for production, so don't worry about ordering a TurboRez card just 
yet.  There will be more news posted at the first of the new year (here, on 
Genie for sure, and possibly in one or more publications).  At that time we 
should have a better handle on release time and pricing, etc. 

     Please understand that we're a dedicated but small company (i.e. 
understaffed and overworked) and that we'll be needing to apply all of our 
energy to completing the TurboRez product.  Therefore, for the near future, 
answering the phone will probably have to take a backseat to the production 
effort.  If we're slow in replying to E-mail and stuff, just take comfort 
in the thought that it was time diverted to a good cause.  Also, thanks in 
advance to folks volunteering for beta test duty but we're doing just fine 
in that regard presently.

     Thanks for your interest in this product.  And stay tuned for more 
news about TurboRez GS, the video card that'll bring powerful and dynamic 
animation to your IIGS! (..and the company bringing it to you, RezTek, of 
course.)

      [C.HARTLEY3]

     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month we will take a look at 
Sonobox, a nifty New Desk Accessory (NDA) MOD player created by Tony 
Morales, and several nice MODules for it. Let's get started. :)

                                 [*][*][*]


    SONOBOX.BXY   File #23533    22272 bytes    GS NDA Amiga MOD player
    '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                                Sonobox 1.0
            Copyright 1994 by Tony Morales, All Rights Reserved
                                 Freeware

     Sonobox is an Apple IIgs New Desk Accessory that allows the playing 
of Amiga Music MODules (MODs) from within any desktop application.  Sonobox 
features adjustable tempo and volume controls, a play list which can 
contain songs from any number of on-line disk volumes, and the ability to 
play songs in the background while you work.  Sonobox primarily recognizes 
songs that comply with the Amiga Protracker MOD standard, though support is 
also provided for Noisetracker/Soundtracker MODs and for 4-track 
Startrekker MODs.

     Sonobox requires an Apple IIgs running GS/OS 6.0 or later.  A hard 
drive and at least 2MB of memory are highly recommended, though are not 
necessary to use the program.  To install Sonobox, copy the file "Sonobox" 
from this archive into the Desk.Accs folder inside your System folder and 
restart your computer.

     To use Sonobox, select it from the Apple menu.  When you first 
install Sonobox, its play list will be empty.  You may add songs to the 
play list.  Doing this makes it easy to play songs regardless of where they 
are stored.  Sonobox keeps track of your play list between uses of the 
program by storing a small file in your Desk.Accs folder named 
"Sonobox.Data".  Each time you open Sonobox, it tries to load this file.

     To add a song to the play list, click the "Add" button.  You will 
then be presented with a dialog box, asking you to select a song.  If the 
"Play Only" checkbox in this dialog is checked when you open a song, rather 
than adding the selected song to the play list, Sonobox will attempt to 
load and play that song.

     If you do not want a particular song to remain in the play list, you 
may remove it by highlighting it and clicking the "Delete" button.

     To play a song, double-click on an entry in the play list.  
Alternatively, you may highlight the song and click the "Play" button.  
Note that if you want to play a song from disk without adding it to the 
play list, click the Add button and check the Play Only checkbox.  See the 
section on adding songs for more information.  To stop the currently 
playing song, click the "Stop" button.

     When you click on the "Options" button, a dialog box will appear with 
all of the player options Sonobox allows you to modify. 

     Normally, Sonobox uses a default timing rate of 50Hz while it is 
playing MODs.  This is due to the fact that most MODs ever created were 
written using trackers which ran at a 50Hz clock rate.  However, some MODs 
have been written to run at 60Hz.  With older MODs, there was no easy way, 
short of listening to the song, to tell which clock rate the song should be 
played at.  Sonobox allows you to select from a default playing speed of 
50Hz, or an increased speed of 60Hz.  You may toggle these settings by 
clicking on the appropriate radio button, either "50Hz" or "60Hz".

     Sonobox normally plays all songs in stereo.  You may listen to 
Sonobox's output in mono, if you wish.  When the "Stereo" checkbox is 
checked, output is in stereo, otherwise, it is mono.

     You may select from one of four different volume settings while 
listening to songs with Sonobox.  The settings you may select from are 
expressed in percentages of the maximum possible output Sonobox produces. 
The available options are 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.  Simply click the 
appropriate radio button.  The default is 100%.

     One of Sonobox's most exciting features is its ability to continue to 
play songs, even after you have closed the Sonobox window.  This is known 
as background playing.  You may turn on background playing by clicking the 
"Yes" radio button next to the "Background playing:" heading.  Turn off 
background playing by clicking the "No" radio button.

     When background playing is on, Sonobox will shut off the player when 
you quit the current application, rather than when you quit Sonobox.

     I highly recommend that all Apple GS owners get this NDA, especially 
if you enjoy the sound qualities available with the GS.

     The following MODules are recommended by Tony Morales.  I've 
downloaded each of them and listened to them.  I like what I hear, but then 
I'm probably not the best judge of good music.

Computers in Hospital
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Phil Shapiro
   [P.SHAPIRO1]



                 >>> APPLE II IN CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS <<<
                 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     It makes a lot of sense to provide hospitalized kids with 
microcomputers.  Kids in hospital have loads of free time on their hands.  
They desperately need activities to occupy their minds as the hours tick 
by.  What better way of engaging their minds than by giving them access to 
educational and recreational software?

     A few months ago, I sent out letters to about 70 children's hospitals 
around the country to find out how they might be using computers for 
educational and recreational purposes.  Among the several replies that came 
back, two hospitals described computer projects glistening with excitement.  
The Children's Hospital of Oakland, California, has a lab of six computers 
that get intensive use.   And Boston Children's Hospital has set up a 
highly unique computer project.

What's Happening at the Children's Hospital of Oakland   The computer lab 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   at the Children's 
Hospital of Oakland has two Apple IIc's, two Mac Classics, a 386 
IBM-compatible, and a Socrates video game system.  Children at the hospital 
use these computers each and every day for instructional and recreational 
purposes.  Since the computers are part of the "school program" at the 
hospital, educational software is emphasized more strongly than 
recreational software.

     As you might expect some of the most popular programs are The Print 
Shop and The Children's Writing and Publishing Center.  School program 
coordinator Patricia (Patty) Coffin explains that getting kids involved 
with creative expression helps them keep their minds focussed away from the 
other routines of hospital life.  Computers are also essential writing 
tools for the many children who's arms are connected to intravenous (IV) 
boards.  These children are unable to hold a pen in their hand, but can 
manage to peck out words on a keyboard.

     Older children in the hospital are excited about writing for the 
hospital's bi-monthly Teen Newsletter.  They use AppleWorks and other word 
processors to compose the text.  Originally this newsletter was planned as 
a quarterly publication.  But the response to the first few issues was so 
positive that the publishing schedule was accelerated to a bi-monthly.

     An interesting facet of this hospital's computer use is that the 
computers reside on carts and are frequently moved around to the children's 
bedsides.  The computers are even shared with children in the intensive 
care unit.  Children who are too sick to even speak often perk up when a 
computer is wheeled to their beside, commented Patty Coffin.

     "People consider the Apple IIc's real old, but they serve our 
purposes real well," she went on to say.  "They don't have a lot of fancy 
features, but they run so many different types of educational programs.  I 
particularly like the volume control knob on the Apple IIc's, which allows 
me to turn down the volume when the programs get too noisy.  Have you ever 
been in a small room with excited children and noisy computers each playing 
a different tune?"

     The most popular software programs used on the hospital's Apple II's 
include Reader Rabbit, Writer Rabbit, Print Shop, Children's Writing and 
Publishing Center, and the Carmen Sandiego series.  The most popular 
programs on the Mac's are Number Maze, Outnumbered, and Math Blaster.  And 
the favorites on the IBM compatible include Express Publisher, Mavis Beacon 
Teaches Typing, and the Isaac Asimov science series.

     Most of the computers used in the hospital have been donated or have 
been acquired from the Apples for the Students shopping receipts project, 
sponsored by Safeway.  Next year Coffin plans to obtain a color Mac with 
her shopping market receipts.  She says she'd love to get a CD-ROM disc 
drive sometime in the near future, too.

     One other item high on Coffin's wish list is a phone line for 
telecommunicating with the outside world.  Many of the older children 
visiting the hospital have asked if they could telecommunicate with their 
peers back in school.

     Apparently the primary financial hurdle to making this happen is not 
the price of modems or communications software, but rather the price of 
installing and maintaining an extra phone line.  Coffin has been lobbying 
for this phone line for quite a while, and is hoping that a combination of 
individual and corporate benefactors can help make it happen.

     Since the Children's Hospital of Oakland is located so near to Apple 
Computer's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, California, I was naturally 
curious to find out whether Apple Computer itself has lent any formal 
support to this project.  Coffin relates that Apple has indeed given 
encouragement to the project, but has offered little in the way of hardware 
or other contributions.  "Apple Computer must get thousands of requests for 
computer donations each year," Coffin declared, "so it's understandable 
that they cannot support everyone's pet project.  However, considering the 
immense positive effect computers can bring to the children here in our 
hospital, we just hope that in the future Apple might consider our requests 
with that in mind."

What's Happening at Boston Children's Hospital:  The "KidBits" Project
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   

     Every successful project starts out with a single individual deciding 
to get involved and make a difference.  Back in 1986, George Boggs, an 
employee at GTE Laboratories, decided the time was ripe to help bring 
computers to the children at Boston Children's Hospital.  His action was 
prompted by hearing the plight of a friend's child, who was spending 
several weeks isolated in the hospital's bone-marrow transplant unit.

     Boggs, who has since moved on to work for another company, is a 
specialist in "human factors" engineering.  His special expertise is in 
understanding how human beings can most efficiently and naturally interact 
with computer technology.  His professional training in this field helped 
lend insight into the immense usefulness of microcomputers in a pediatric 
hospital setting.

     Using GTE's internal electronic mail network, Boggs was able to 
solicit support for his ideas from 50 to 60 other GTE employees.  The group 
quickly formed a steering committee to approach the hospital with their 
proposal.

     The original idea was that GTE employees could donate their time and 
expertise to help train both the hospital's "child life specialists" and 
the children themselves.  During the planning stages of the project 
children in the hospital were consulted as to how they felt the project 
should be run. Later on, Boggs recalled that moment:  "It was very moving. 
We sat there listening to these children, who were dealing with a fatal 
illness, tell us how they wanted computers to help them with their future.  
I was overwhelmed with their courage."

     GTE Laboratories helped the hospital acquire some Apple IIe's and 
some Mac SE's.  The volunteer employees spent time during evenings and 
weekends showing how the computers could be used.  GTE Laboratories has 
even allowed some of these employees to take off daytime hours to volunteer 
at the hospital.

     To help build enthusiasm for the project, several "computer fairs" 
were organized.  The fairs involved setting up a collection of computer 
stations with different activities set up at each station.  Children were 
given "computer whiz certificates" for each station they visited.  So 
well-received were these computer fairs that the hospital has planned them 
as a regularly quarterly event.

     When word of the KidBits project got out, other people stepped 
forward to offer support.  The Boston Computer Society, the local user 
group in the Boston metro area, generously donated copies of their entire 
public domain and shareware collection.  These software programs can be 
copied and used on the current computers at the hospital, as well as on 
future computers the hospital may acquire.

     A year or two ago the GTE Laboratories employees finished work on a 
network of Macintoshes in the bone-marrow transplant unit.  Making use of 
their technical expertise, the employees set up a PhoneNet network.  
PhoneNet is a network which uses standard telephone wires to connect 
computers.  While considered "slow" for use in a business setting, PhoneNet 
networks are often the network of choice in schools, libraries, and 
non-profit organizations.

     With their PhoneNet network in place, the children in the bone-marrow 
unit can now send electronic mail back and forth between rooms.  They're 
also able to play interactive games especially designed for use on 
networks.

     One of the most active GTE volunteers in KidBits project, David Fay, 
says that he'd really like to see a modem and phone line placed on the 
networked computers.  Connecting the kids to the outside world would 
introduce yet another dimension to the KidBits project.

     Since George Boggs's departure from GTE, David Fay has stepped in to 
help preserve the momentum of the KidBits project.  Myra Fox, the director 
of Child Life Services at the hospital, says that Fay and the other GTE 
volunteers have shown extraordinary commitment to the KidBits project. 
"Working on their own time, they have poured their hearts and souls into 
KidBits.  They're a fabulous group of people."

     Fox goes on to explain that the "gift of time" is one of the most 
meaningful gifts the children (and adolescents) in the hospital receive.  
"Knowing that the GTE employees will be visiting regularly to help with the 
KidBits project can go far to buoy a patient's spirits."

     Myra Fox sums it up all well when she said:  "Computers [in 
hospitals] can help encourage socialization, provide patient entertainment, 
counteract isolation, promote choices, and offer academic education."  All 
that, and more.

December 1994 Report
""""""""""""""""""""
by GEna Saikin
     [A2.GENA]


Introduction   PAUG was created over a year ago to help cement the Apple II 
''''''''''''   community, and to provide a place of haven for those who 
can't find local support groups in their area.

What's New in A2?   The Apple II is still going strong -- in schools and 
'''''''''''''''''   homes across the country.  Though not too many new 
commercial programs are being written, many, many shareware programs are 
finding their way to the BBSes and libraries.  A great program has just 
been written by our very own Tony Morales.  It's called SonoBox, and will 
play MODs in the background of any GS/OS desktop application.  It works 
quite well, and so far, has very few conflicts with existing programs.  One 
of its positive attributes is the fact that it runs quite well under 
Spectrum.

     Paul Parkhurst (PMP) of ANSITerm fame is still working away at his 
fax software, and we'll pass on more information as it's available.

     AppleWorks 5.0 will be shipping very, very soon.  It's a major 
upgrade of the old "workhorse" AppleWorks, and information about it can be 
found in the Apple II RoundTable library, file #23470.

The Main Event   Imagine connecting to thousands of computers!  Picture 
''''''''''''''   traveling from New York to California, on to Australia, 
making a stop in Germany and Austria en route...all from the comfort of 
your home.  It is indeed well-named when it is called the Super Information 
Highway.  True, there are some potholes in the system, and one can take 
wrong turns.  But, if you have time, a local connection, and the pioneer 
spirit, you can explore to your hearts content!

     This is the Internet...a conglomeration of millions of computers, 
linked together by miles of phone wire and fibre optic technology.  There 
are thousands of bytes of information to be gleaned on the Internet.  
Interested in Star Trek?  Visit a plethora of newsgroups with that as the 
subject.  Want to see the latest pics from Jupiter?  Take a journey to the 
NASA computer system, burrowing through the internet's gopher system to get 
there, or millions of other locations.  Need to get facts on the latest in 
medicine?  There are dozens, if not hundreds of places to telnet or gopher 
to where you will get everything from information about AIDS to the latest 
research in cancer.  Need a book?  Well, you can gopher to the Library of 
Congress, or hundreds of other library systems, including university 
libraries and public libraries to find out just WHERE the book you want is!  
There's even a bookstore online that you can order from -- armed with a 
credit card and some patience...for there are thousands of books to search 
through!

     Files...let there be files!  What you cannot find anymore in computer 
stores for the Apple II systems can be found in abundance on the Internet 
through FTP and/or .binaries sites that have thousands of Apple II 
files...from programs to utilities, graphics to music.

     How does one go about linking to this Super Information Highway?  The 
three major online services -- Compuserve, Prodigy and Delphi already have 
access to the internet for their subscribers, and GEnie is not far behind, 
with planned full internet access by the end of 1994.  There are also local 
Internet Providers, one of the most major ones being NetCom.  Some are free 
to residents of the state they reside in; but most have a minimal service 
charge to the user.  Most run $17 to $25 per month, unlimited access -- a 
real bargain considering how much information you can glean from this 
humongous system -- who can buy a ticket to the nearest town, never mind 
overseas for that amount?  By downloading a file called PDAccesslist from 
the Internet RoundTable here on GEnie, you can get a list of these internet 
providers.  There are also freenets around -- one of the more famous being 
the Cleveland Freenet.  However, most of the freenets allow limited access 
to the internet, with many allowing only email access.

     There are more features to the Internet, too innumerable to mention 
here.  However, one of the best roadmaps to use is the World Wide Web 
(WWW), which can link you to a great percentage of the services on the 
internet.  It's a HyperText program -- this means that you'll see 
highlighted phrases and words, and if you hit return when your cursor is on 
one of these words or phrases, you'll be magically transported to the area 
that the word or phrase denotes.  The best way to learn the internet is 
gather speed on the onramp, and plunge in!  Nothing you can do will "break" 
the net.  You may get cornered, but you can always back out by pulling the 
plug!  Just like someone once told me about how to find yourself around in 
a strange town -- if you've got a full tank of gas and time...you can do no 
harm.  Same with the Internet.  Get ready, set and go!

What's New In A2?   September and October saw the Apple II RoundTable 
'''''''''''''''''   gearing up for the influx of AOL Refugees, and we 
weren't disappointed!  Many Apple II users who were no longer able to 
access AOL via their systems came over to GEnie, where they found a home 
and a warm welcome.

     You'll see some new RTC Hosts here.  Paul Parkhurst (PMP) will be 
hosting the 9 pm to 11 pm segment of the Friday Night RTC, and Dave "Binary 
Bear" Ciotti, will return and host our Saturday night 11-1 segment.
