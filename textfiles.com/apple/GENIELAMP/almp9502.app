Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     This month, the big news is that Spectrum 2.0 has been released, 
assuming that Seven Hills Software kept their promise.  However, in 
discussing the release of Spectrum, Dave Hecker of Seven Hills mentioned 
that they are also working on new versions of Kangaroo, TransProg III, and 
GraphicWriter III.  That's exciting.  (Of course, my cynical side 
immediately chimes in that this explains the pre-Christmas sale Seven Hills 
had on these products, but don't listen to it.  My cynical side is a just 
an old grump with a permanent case of the winter blahs.)  It's always 
exciting to know that the wheels keep turning.

     At the same time, apparently not enough of us are voting with their 
wallets.  Mike Westerfield says that sales of Quick Click Calc--a fine 
program, BTW--are not all they should be, and Michael Lutynski desperately 
needs more orders of Animasia 3-D in order to keep his head above water.

     Now, I know that few of us have enough money to buy every piece of 
software that comes on the market.  (I sure don't, as you'll read in this 
month's interview.)  But if you do have the money, then take the time now 
to order the software.  I've cut my editorial short this month so that you 
have the extra time.  (Oh, all right, I also figured that since I'm 
profiled this month, there's a limit to how much of my voice you readers 
can take.)

Unpaid Bills   I was told that the latest A2 Lamp says that I am doing 
''''''''''''   programming for Spectrum 2.0.  Someone must have their Bills 
confused.  It is not me that is doing that programming.

                   (W.SHUFF, CAT3, TOP3, MSG:265/M645;1)

          Sorry about that, Bill.  This was entirely my fault.  In fact, 
          it is Bill Tudor who has programmed XCMDs for Spectrum 2.0.  I 
          apologize for any inconvenience suffered.--Ed.


Check Before You Donate   In the January GEnieLamp A2 there is an article 
'''''''''''''''''''''''   by Phil Shapiro about the Apple II as an Equity 
Computer.  In the article, Phil discusses what might be done with the many 
Apple IIs in schools as school labs switch over to Macs and Power Macs.  To 
quote:

     "As the more affluent schools in our nation decide to equip their 
computer labs with Macs and Power Macs, large numbers of Apple II computers 
will come available on the second-hand market. Along with the computers 
themselves will come huge quantities of second-hand Apple II educational 
programs."

     It would be prudent for us to inquire closely about our local 
school's plans.  I have heard more than one report (from educators) of area 
schools =requiring that their Apple IIs be junked= -- thrown in the trash 
-- when their computer labs were "upgraded" to new machines.  I find this 
appalling, unconscionable, and outrageous.

     Phil proposes some fine uses for these machines, and others could 
think of more, but if the machines are thrown in landfills, the opportunity 
will be wasted.  We've each come to terms in some way with Apple's decision 
to figuratively bury the Apple II; for Apple IIs to literally be buried 
would be a tragedy!

APPLIED ENGINEERING SOURCE CODE   GOOD NEWS!!! GREAT NEWS!!!
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     All is not lost with the AESource archive, it seems that the archive 
was corrupted when I tried to unpackit with GShrinkit v1.1.  I then got a 
hint about trying to unpackit with Shrinkit v3.4, and to my amazement it 
worked.

     The AESource is all intact, and this includes the PCTransporter 
source.  I was able to unpackit, and took a quick look at.  The source 
itself is old, and only includes the drivers for the PCT, and not the 
actual software.  I guess something is better than nothing.  :) :) :)

ICON BASICS   Doug's comments need a little clarification.
"""""""""""
     First:  To use a new Icon it must be placed into a Folder named 
ICONS. This folder must be in the root directory of a currently mounted 
volume. It does NOT have to be on the boot volume, but this is the 
preferred place for Icons that will affect all files (like the trash can 
icons).  Generally the best method is to place icons that affect only a 
particular program onto the disk for that program, unless the program is 
kept on your hard drive.

     Second:  Since the introduction of System 6.0, the Finders own icons 
are not stored in the Icons folder.  Instead they are in the Finder's 
resource fork.  Even with the older systems, however all of the Finder's 
icons were lumped together into a single file.  If someone were to do what 
doug suggests and move their Finder.Icons (on system 5 or earlier) to a 
differnt directory, the Finder would crash.  While this method is fine for 
Icons added to the system, it will not work with the Full Trash Icon 
(unless you have more than one personal trash icon).  This is not a problem 
though. When the Finder locates a new icon it simply replaces the built in 
icon with the new one.

     Third.  Be careful adding new icons.  The Finder gets into trouble if 
more than one icon is added to the system with the same definition.  I.e if 
you placed to new Trash Icons into your Icons folder, bad things are likely 
to happen.  This is especially true for multiple copies of the "Generic 
file" icon.  For this reason, I use an icon editor to check every new icon 
folder before I use it.  I then combine any new Icons I like into my 
existing Icon Folders.  What I end up with is a nice manageable set of Icon 
folders with no duplicates.  My Icon folder looks something like this;

     Folder.Icons
     System.Icons
     Filetype.Icons
     Game.Icons

     As I find or make new Icons that I like, I just place them into the
appropriate folder.

     I hope this helps

EASTER EGGS THAT CHECK THE CALENDAR   Aside from System's 6's Time Control 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Panel, I'm not aware of any other 
Easter Eggs that depend on the IIGS clock or that only activate themselves 
on certain days. That is, until Brutal Deluxe's Blockade arrived here about 
a week or so ago.

     It seems to me that if you play Blockade on odd numbered days, the 
border flashes in time to the music. Played on even numbered days, there 
are no flashing borders.

     Knowing Brutal Deluxe, I'm sure that's just one of many Easter Eggs 
in Blockade. Another one is activated when clicking on a senstive part of 
the graphic of the young lady.

     Anyone else found any others?

blindness.  Yet he installed the two card Roadrunner, installed his

MACRO CAPTURES CELL MEMO TEXT   I figured out how to capture up to 70 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   characters of a memo, even if it's much 
longer, without crashing.  The trick is to set the column width of the 
hidden column to the max then use < .getcell x,y,1 >. The 1 tells UM to 
grab what would be displayed on the screen, if it were displayed, not the 
literal value.

     Here's my last effort on cell memos.  I made one change that pokes a 
width of 80, actually an illegal value, into the colwidth table for the 
hidden category that contains the memo.  I stopped at 80 because that's the 
maximum length of an Ultra string variable.

     posn c,r :                    // get current position
     c = c + $80 :                 // set hi bit
     $1 = .getcell 121,1,0 :       // grab memo "map"
     $2 = chr$ c :                 // stuff c in $2
     x = .substring $2, $1, 1:     // search for current cell in map
     if x > 0 x = x + $79 :        // calculate which hidden column
     poke #colwidths + X, 80:      // set hidden col to 80 width
     $1 = .getcell x,r,1           // get up to 80 characters of memo.
     $1 = .zapchar $1, $d :        // remove crs from string

AW5 PRINTER PROBLEMS   Appleworks 5.0 keeps changing the on-line status of

SPECTRUM VERSION 2.0 IS SHIPPING IN JANUARY 1995!   Even if that means 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   1/31/95, it IS shipping 
this month! :)

     Version 2.0 fixes the little "quirks" that were discovered (in-house 
and by users like you) after releasing version 1.0.  Although most of you 
have probably never experienced these problems, here are some highlights:

 + Compressing Spectrum with HardPressed is no longer a problem; Spectrum 
   is quite happy running in compressed form.
 + Spectrum's rBundle has been fixed so your Desktop file won't get bigger 
   each time Spectrum is launched.
 + The "black text" and bogus memory errors when opening Editor files has 
   been fixed.
 + Downloaded files always go into the correct folder (a lot of CoPilot 
   users saw this one).
 + Fixed a problem that could have corrupted some memory when creating or 
   editing a phonebook entry.
 + The "Copy File" script command can now copy even very large ("tree") 
   files, where previously it showed an "access not allowed" error.

     BUT VERSION 2.0 IS NOT MERELY A "BUG FIX" VERSION!  We jumped from 
v1.0 to v2.0 because of all the new features and capabilities we crammed 
into Spectrum!

     Here's an EXTREMELY short list of "new or changed features":

 + Spectrum v2.0 plays its sounds by event number, which means you can use 
   the Sound CDEV to pick which sound is associated with each event.
 + Resuming Zmodem now works with GEnie, and is even more reliable on all 
   systems when receiving unique files that happen to be named the same.
 + The Scrollback buffer can now be set to contain the "filtered" data 
   (just like the Capture buffer) or the "raw" data (just like version 
   1.0).
 + Most Online Displays now support an EDITABLE chat line (using the Arrow 
   keys).
 + Each Online Display has been updated to some degree.  One big 
   improvement to the Spectrum SHR displays is that they now show _23_ 
   lines down!
 + Phonebook entries can remember an Online Display choice.
 + Scripts execute up to 300% faster than they did in version 1.  WOW!

     THE SCRIPTING LANGUAGE ALSO HAS A *BUNCH* OF NEW FEATURES!  These new 
features will benefit you even if you don't write scripts, because people 
are already writing useful scripts for working on services such as GEnie.

Here are a few of the new scripting capabilities:
 + Use any reasonable number of NAMED variables (no longer limited to 
   variables 0 through 9)!
 + Create up to 32 "HitZones" so your script can respond to mouse clicks.
 + Work with "Spectrum External Commands" (XCMDs), which greatly extend 
   Spectrum's capabilities.  For example, a "Line Edit" XCMD lets scripts 
   display a custom window with up to 8 LineEdit boxes (the script 
   specifies the labels and the kind of data to enter).

   Other XCMDs include:
   AlertWindow -- gives scripts COMPLETE access to the AlertWindow tool 
                  call
   Chatterbox -- lets scripts manage "private" messages while in a live 
                 chat, by displaying each private chat in its own custom 
                 window)
   Debug -- helps script authors to debug their scripts
   HodgePodge -- several utilities, such as number conversions, text 
                 conversions, etc.
   Inform -- display a custom window containing a Teach file
   Lister -- lets scripts manage lists of information, and lets the user 
             interract with them in a custom window
   RadioCheck -- display a window with radio buttons and checkboxes
   rVersion -- reads rVersion info out of files which contain that info
   ScriptEditor -- access advanced TextEdit tool functions
   Speech -- speak any given phrase, IF Byte Works' "Talking Tools" is 
             installed
   Twilight II -- controls the Twilight II screen blanker so it blanks only 
                  at appropriate times, and completely inactivates it 
                  during file transfers
   XLoader -- provides an easy way to activate and inactivate Spectrum 
              External Commands while using Spectrum

Hey, Check This Out!   If you're ordering Spectrum or the Spectrum Upgrade 
''''''''''''''''''''   then you'll be interested in two more great deals 
we've worked out!

     DEAL #1 -- BALLOON is a new desk accessory (NDA) that lets you easily 
create and maintain NuFX (ShrinkIt) archives on your IIGS.  Because Balloon 
is a NDA, you don't have to quit Spectrum (or any other IIGS application) 
just to pack or unpack files!

     Dealing with NuFX archives has never been easier.  In the Finder you 
double-click an archive and instantly see what's in it...and extract the 
files right there!  And creating an archive is just as easy--simply 
highlight some icons then choose "Archive Files" from the Extras menu.

     Now, that's cool enough, but it gets EVEN BETTER:  With Balloon you 
also get a Spectrum External Command (XCMD) that transparently keeps track 
of all the files you download.  As soon as you log off and it's "safe" to 
unpack, Balloon pops open and automatically unpacks the files you received! 
(Of course there are preferences to tailor Balloon to your desires...opt 
for the completely automatic/no prompting/automatic extraction of your 
archives, or go with full prompting, or something in between.)

     The Balloon XCMD even adds several new commands to Spectrum's 
scripting language!  That right, with Balloon and the Balloon XCMD, you can 
write script to open existing archives, create new archives, add files to 
archives, and extract files from archives.

     Joe Wankerl at GS+ Magazine wrote this great utility, and you can 
purchase it from EGO Systems for $25...OR you can take advantage of the 
special deal we've worked out, where you can purchase it direct from Seven 
Hills Software for only $18!*

     *Plus tax (in FL) and shipping & handling; keep reading...

     DEAL #2 -- TALKING TOOLS is set of system tools which provide "voice 
synthesis" (computer-generated speech) for your Apple IIGS!  Because the 
speech is computer-generated instead of being recorded, these tools let you 
speak ANY phrase at will.

     To make this happen we created the "Speech" external command for 
Spectrum v2.0.  Using the Speech XCMD you can control various speech 
settings (Male or Female voice, pitch, volume, etc.), and you can write 
scripts that actually SPEAK to you!

     This capability is fun, but it's also useful.  Imagine being able to 
truly _listen_ to a GEnie Roundtable while doing something else (building a 
model, reading the newspaper, etc.)!

     Because Ewen Wannop wrote the Speech XCMD which controls the speech 
tools, we are able to provide the Speech XCMD for FREE with Spectrum v2.0.  
But the XCMD won't do diddly unless you've actually got the speech 
synthesis tools from Byte Works.

     You can purchase "Talking Tools" from Byte Works for $35...OR you can 
order direct from Seven Hills Software and get it for just $25!*

     *Plus tax (in FL) and shipping & handling; keep reading...

BALLOON V2.0 IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR THE IIGS!   EGO Systems is pleased to 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   announce that version 2.0 of  
Balloon is now shipping!

     Balloon is a new desk accessory (NDA) that allows you to easily 
create and maintain NuFX (ShrinkIt) archives on your IIGS.  Since Balloon 
is a NDA, you no longer have to run GS-ShinkIt to extract files from 
archives!  So, if you use a desktop telecommunictions program, like 
Spectrum from Seven Hills Software, you can manipulate your ShrinkIt 
archives while still online!

     Here are a few of Balloon's features:

     *  Balloon can extract files from ShrinkIt archives.

     *  Balloon can create new ShrinkIt archives.

     *  Balloon can add/remove files to/from existing ShrinkIt archives.

     *  Balloon recognizes ShrinkIt archives that are enclosed in Binary 
        II, MacBinary and America Online for Macintosh "wrappers."

     *  Balloon works properly in both 640 and 320 modes, just like all 
        good new desk accessories should!

     *  Ballon allows you to have multiple ShrinkIt archives and file 
        information windows open at once.

     *  Balloon is Finder friendly.  Double-click on a ShrinkIt archive 
        and Balloon opens it automatically!  Balloon can also communicate 
        with other system extensions to automatically open files after they 
        are extracted from an archive!

     The Balloon v2.0 package also comes with the Balloon XCMD for 
Spectrum v2.0.  By using this XCMD with Spectrum v2.0, you can have Balloon 
AUTOMATICALLY expand the ShrinkIt archives that you download with Spectrum!  
You don't even have to open Balloon!

     In addition, the Balloon XCMD for Spectrum v2.0 lets you write 
Spectrum scripts that give you full access to the Balloon new desk 
accessory and all its capabilities.  For example, you can write a script 
that will create a new archive and add files to it.  Or, you could write a 
script that would open an existing archive and extract all the files from 
it to a folder that you specify.

     As if that weren't enough great stuff, the Balloon v2.0 package also 
includes a copy of our popular new desk accessory text editor, EGOed lite. 
With EGOed lite installed in your system, you can quickly and easily read 
and print text, Teach, AppleWorks Classic and AppleWorks GS word processor 
files.  Balloon and EGOed lite will even work together to let you 
automatically open and read the word processing files that you extract from 
your ShrinkIt archives!

     So, how much does all this cost?  Believe it or not, the retail price 
for Balloon v2.0 is just $25!  This price includes first class shipping to 
anywhere in the United States, Air Mail shipping to Canada and Mexico, and 
surface mail shipping to anywhere else in the world.  (For Air Mail 
delivery outside North America, add $3, for a total of $28.)  As an added 
bonus, when you send in your Balloon registration card, we'll send you a 
FREE issue of GS+ Magazine, the only Apple IIGS Magazine and Disk 
publication!  (If you are already a GS+ Magazine subscriber, sending in 
your Balloon registration card will get you a free magazine-only back issue 
of your choice!)

     Speaking of GS+ Magazine, if you are a GS+ Magazine subscriber, you 
can get Balloon v2.0 at a special introductory price of only $20!  When you 
order, just let us know that you are a subscriber and include your customer 
number (it's on your GS+ Magazine mailing label above your name) to qualify 
for the special introductory price.  But hurry!  This special offer ends on 
April 3rd, 1995!

The Ever So Fine Print   Balloon requires System Software v6.0.1, at least 
''''''''''''''''''''''   2MB of RAM, and a hard drive.  Spectrum v2.0 is 
required to use the Balloon XCMD for Spectrum v2.0, it will NOT work with 
earlier versions of Spectrum.  (However, the Balloon new desk accessory 
WILL work with older versions of Spectrum.)

     Balloon v2.0 is a complete rewrite of the original Balloon Finder  
extension that appeared in GS+ Magazine V5.N2.  Balloon v2.0 is a  
stand-alone product and will NOT appear in GS+ Magazine!  Only current  GS+ 
Magazine subscribers can purchase Balloon for the special introductory  
price of $20.  However, if you subscribe when you place your order for  
Balloon, you can get the special pricing.  This special offer expires on 
April 3rd, 1995.

     To order Balloon, give us a call at 1-800-662-3634 between 9 a.m. and

CRY FOR HELP   Yes, this is a cry for help.  My name is Michael Lutynski
""""""""""""   and I am starting a small business called Animasia.  My 
first product, Animasia 3-D, is finally ready to begin shipping in the next 
several days.  However, the cost for printing the first run of manuals, 
registration cards, and disk labels have monopolized my expenses and almost 
completely offset the orders received so far.

     I am asking for anyone who is interested in Animasia 3-D to consider 
purchasing it now.  This is not meant to be an advertising campaign.  I 
need only four orders to help me meet my pressing financial obligations.

What Is It?   In brief, Animasia 3-D is a desktop application that creates 
'''''''''''   animations using three-dimensional models.  Animasia 3-D also 
can be used to create images and clip art for other applications.  A more 
descriptive press release is available upon request.

What You Will Receive   You will receive the following:
'''''''''''''''''''''
     Two manuals:  Tutorial and Reference
     Four disks:  Application, Tutorials, Animations, and Projects
     Registration card

     The manuals are laser printed with spiral bindings.  Of the 300+ 
total pages, there is an illustration on almost every page.  The Tutorial 
manual contains twelve complete lessons and the Reference is thorough.

     The disks contain the application, tutorials, sample animations, 
projects, and 3-D clip models.  One animation entitled "Warning" is 40 
seconds long.  For HyperCard IIgs users, there are also two new animation 
player XCMDs written by Brian Gillespie.

     There is a 30 day satisfaction guarantee.  If Animasia 3-D just isn't 
for you, you can return it for a full refund.  All in all, the package is 
professionally done.

     You will need an Apple IIGS with System Software 6.0.1 and at least 
2Mb of memory.  4Mb, a hard disk, and an accelerator are strongly 
recommended.

Why Is It Shipping Now?   Animasia 3-D was supposed to be released on 
'''''''''''''''''''''''   December 10th.  The release has been pushed back 
to correct a few significant bugs and generally to make everything as 
perfect as can be.

     As of today, 1/26/95, the only issues that remain are to determine 
which animations and 3-D clip models will be included and to type up a few 
disk notes.  All other materials are ready to go.

About Animasia   The Animasia 3-D project began as a test in the summer of 
''''''''''''''   1989.  Not until 1991 was it seriously developed.  Since 
that time, I have written several articles for GS+ magazine, created the 
Addressed For Success label printing application, and worked as technical 
support for Econ Technologies.

     Animasia 3-D was demonstrated at this summer's KansasFest.  User 
suggestions were implemented, like faster operation and support for 
gray-scale images and animations.

Conclusion   If you've already ordered, thank you very much.  Your Animasia 
''''''''''   3-D will be arriving shortly.  If you'd like to order, I'm 
asking that you please do so now; the funds are greatly needed.  The cost 
is US $99 plus $3.50 shipping and handling.  Overseas orders add $5.  
Florida residents add 6% sales tax.  At this time, only checks or money 
orders are accepted.

     The address is:

DIGISOFT CD FOR IIGS   I know we have been pretty quiet lately, and the 
""""""""""""""""""""   truth of the matter is that the CD has been finished 
since September.  However, several  unexpected problems and a lack of time 
to deal with them has delayed the  production of the disc until now.  We 
will be sending the data off to the  CD plant within the next two weeks, 
and beyond that it should take  another three weeks to be replicated, so we 
expect to ship somewhere in  the first half of February.  Price will be 
around $60, more details will  be announced soon. This is a 100% Apple II

FAXINATION DELAYED, FEATURES CUT   Sorry to hear, and report, a slight 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   delay in Faxination.  I talked with them 
today (Tuesday) and was told that there was a "minor" bug found and it 
would be fixed before shipping.  As sad as I was that I would not have my 
new toys for Christmas, I told them I appreciated them holding it back

>>>>>   Faxination will allow you to forward faxes to one new address at a
"""""   time, and the new addresses can be selected from your phone book. 
It looks like we may have to defer the batch send feature until a (maybe 
free) upgrade due to delivery delays. Also, compatibility concerns fueled 
the decision to NOT include a "timed send" feature, so you will have to 
start your fax transmissions manually. For the same reason, no redial 
feature is being included in the initial release. The limit for the number 
of entries in the phone book is about 32,767, but the practical limit for 
your machine may be smaller due to RAM or disk space limits.

Steve Bernbaum -

     Many regrets, but every time I look at the serial routines, the 
entire program seems to break. :) I now plan to include alternate port 
support, but the lateness of the program prevents me from including it in 
the initial release. I think ProTerm allows you to use the Modem port even 
if it is not enabled in the Control Panel, and Faxination certainly does. 
Perhaps you could simply put your modem in the Modem port and only 
reconfigure your communications software? (Hope so, been there with the 
mass reconfig -- several times! :)

WOLFSTEIN 3-D FOR IIGS   When will Wolf be out?  Only the dead will tell!!
""""""""""""""""""""""
     Truely, I can't give a date yet.  Bill is busy with a emergency  
project near final along with Wolf GS.  So, he is working as fast as he can 
to finalize two projects at the same time!

     I can tell you that all the main art is done.  The walls and  game 
sprites are all completed.  Misc stuff like interface screens and junk like 
that still need to be done, but are trivial stuff.

     I'll keep you all posted.  :)

Blood, automap, hounds, are they all included? (especially the former :)

<<<<<   Yes, I'm quite familiar with it since I did all the artwork
"""""   conversion.  :)

     It's based on the Mac "Third Encounter" version.  It has blood, 
automap, and hounds. ;)

     The main difference is the artwork was reduced from 128x128 pixels to 
64x64 pixels and of course reduced to 16 colors.  It was a major job but I 
think you'll like the results.  I'm quite happy with the final art.  

     There will be 90 levels!!!  It will have the original 30 which is all 
that was included in the "Jaguar", "Super Nintendo", and "Mac shareware"    
versions.  Plus it includes all 60 levels of the original "IBM" version 
which are broken down into 6 missions of  10 levels each.

     There will be at least 3 screen resolutions you can pick.  Maybe more 
in the final version.  An accellerator card is HIGHLY  recommended.

     I'm right now finishing up the interface screens, so it is getting 
close. I'll keep you posted on the progress.  I'm expecting a new version 
next week for test.
                  (S.EVERTS, CAT40, TOP6, MSG:28/M645;1)

<<<<<   The mac "third encounter" has the original 30 levels which were
"""""   used in the Jaguar and Super Nintendo versions.  They were heavily 
modified levels from the IBM version.

     The 60 extra levels are the entire levels that came with the full IBM 
version.  

     It gets kind of confusing.  Basicly, the IBM full version had 6 
missions, each with 10 levels.

     When the SNES and Jaguar versions came out, they made a new set of 30 
levels based on the IBM version.

     Then the Mac version came out and took those 30 levels. They then got 
the original IBM levels and added them back. Thats why it has 90 levels.  
When you play the IBM levels, you may notice half of them are familiar, but 
they were heavily changed.  Rooms were moved, deleted, or added, doors 
change, etc.

     So...  On the mac version, they had three versions.  One with the 3 
levels, one with the 30 levels, and one with all 90 levels.

     The gs version will only be released with all 90 levels.

     I'm sure I confused all of you now!  :)

     On the question of compatibility...  The game will NOT be compatible 
with IBM WAD files.  The formats are very different. We are building in a 
feature to allow you to load in new levels.  We aren't making a level 
editor, but hopefully some brave programmer will decide to make one for it. 
Hint, hint!!  So if someone does do an editor, I'm sure we'll see tons of 
new levels.  Bill says its possible to edit the art too, so someone can 
make an art editor too!

APPLEWORKS 5 ON A MAC?   The emulator, tentatively titled "Phoenix II" and 
""""""""""""""""""""""   heretofore referred to as "Phoenix" or "the 
Phoenix project," allows you to run AppleWorks 5 on a Mac. AppleWorks 4 
will likely be supported as well. There will be some trade- offs, at least

you'll actually being running AW5 on your Mac. That means macros and pokes 
and all that stuff is the same; this isn't _similar_ to AppleWorks, it's

QUICKDRAW II SUPPORT FOR SECOND SIGHT?   OK, I wasn't going to say anything 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   again just yet, but the QuickDraw 
II support IS being worked on!  I've managed to get about a third of QD 
disassembled and understood so far (it's about 32K of code in total), and 
I've started work on the driver structure.  At this point, I believe it to 
be possible to support higher resolutions in many programs, though of 
course not any that write directly to screen memory, even though this is an 
Apple supported method.  You will not get more colours out of existing 
programs, and I'm also concerned about the display being rather odd looking 
because of the large difference in aspect ratios.

     The best I can offer is, we'll have to wait and see how it works out. 
Initially I was quite excited about the prospects of using the Finder, 
AppleWorks GS, etc., at 1024x768, but now I realize that the display is 
going to look very squished unless I add special code to, for example, 
double the height of 640 mode icons and also change the system font.

     I also do not have any official affiliation with Sequential and have 
not seen any documentation on how to access the board.  Hopefully I'll have 
everything else pretty much ready when the board and developers' docs are 
released so I can put together the driver for the SS very quickly.

     I still think that the best use of the board will come from new 
programs written with the Second Sight in mind, but my driver system should 
help with at least some of the older programs that will not be updated.

     I know I should be happier about this than I am, but Woz made the 
cover of the latest "Apple Developer Tools Catalog" hustling Mac 
development tools.  The blurb on page 1 prattles on thus:

               "No, you're not seeing things...  that's Steve 
          Wozniak on our cover.  Woz heard about our great 
          subscription products that automatically deliver 
          regular updates.  He got so excited that he couldn't 
          resist getting in on the action!
               ... While Woz probably won't deliver these 
          terrific products personally, you're sure to be more 
          than satisfied!  Just like Woz!

     I know things, especially in technology, more faster and faster, but I 
really like my IIGS.  The macs I make use of at work are just boxes, 
ClarisWorks is OK; it just doesn't compare to the feeling I get helping at 
an Apple II user group meeting.  Words can hardly express the gratitude I 
feel towards what Woz and all the others for Apple II hardware and software 
and I know the Power Mac and MacOS are Apple's future, but it doesn't feel 
the same.  Maybe Woz has something to say beyond that bogus blurb.

                     >>> TOO MUCH TIME ON MY HANDS <<<
                     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     A long, long time ago, I used to run a computer BBS on my trusty 
Apple IIe.  Some of the callers knew each other, but most of the denizens 
knew each other only as names.  After a year or two, some of the more 
regular callers organized a "night out", when we all met for dinner to 
remind ourselves of the faces behind the names.

     The first time we did this, there was a distinct lack of 
organization.  The time, date, and place of the event floated in limbo.  
One participant asked, innocently enough, "So what's the story on the 
banquet hall?"  All she wanted to know is what progress had been made in 
making reservations at the proposed venue.  A simple enough question.

     Well, you know how it is when you have a lot of stress.  Sometimes 
you expend a lot of energy on trivial things just to keep yourself sane.  
That was and is my excuse for my following reply to the innocent question 
"What's the story on the banquet hall?"

                                 [*][*][*]


     Once upon a time, far, far away, there was a banquet hall named 
Ermintrude.  She was a very jolly and good banquet hall most of the time, 
but unfortunately she had a very low tolerance for the inane drivel that 
passes as dinner conversation in modern-day North America, and so, throwing 
off her tablecloths and curtains, she set out to seek her fortune.

     As she was trundling down the road with no thought in her mind other 
than the fact that it was quite chilly to be out without one's foundation, 
she ran into three little children named Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, and 
Peter.  She noticed that they looked quite sad.

     "Why do you look so sad?" Ermintrude asked, going for the obvious, 
and addressing all three at once, so as to save time.

     "Yea, though would fain break bread--" began one.

     "All right, knock it off!" warned Ermintrude.  "Speak English, or 
French, or both, but not something you've obviously mugged up out of a book 
published about the same time that King Arthur was in rompers."

     "We're starved!" cried all three at once.

     "Starved?" echoed the puzzled Ermintrude.  "How can that be? Surely 
your mothers have given you your Family Allowance cheques."

     "No, money is not the problem," Mopsy explained, and indeed, 
Ermintrude noticed that the children's pockets were fairly stuffed with 
loonies.

     "Then I don't understand.  There is a McDonald's right behind us, a 
Burger King in front of us, and an Arby's just down the droke a piece.  
Fast food to the right of us; fast food to the left of us; fast food all 
around us; char-broiled and sundry."

     "With a clarity unparalleled in an inanimate object, you have 
mentioned the solution and the problem in the same breath," said Flopsy, 
who, to be absolutely frank, was a trifle too verbose.  "We have partaken 
of the fare at all three emporiums..."

     "...and we're still hungry!" finished Mopsy.

     "Not overly surprising, considering that there's about as much food 
value in their containers as in the muck they dish into said containers," 
said Ermintrude sourly.  "Come with me, children, to a land beyond the blue 
mountains, where food is nourishing and no one tries to serve you while 
wearing a thing that looks like telephone operators' gear."

     So the three hungry and apparently boundlessly optimistic children 
bundled into Ermintrude, and they all set off for the land behind the blue 
mountains.

hall, to presented at approximately the same time that it has been reliably

Thinking About Online Communications

     >>> NURTURING THE EMOTIONAL BOND BETWEEN WRITERS AND READERS <<<
     """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Last month I finished reading an excellent new book, "The Metaphysics 
of Virtual Reality."  Having finished the book, my mind was swirling with 
ideas.  So I sat down and wrote a lengthy e-mail message to the author of 
the book, Michael Heim.  His Internet address was printed right there in 
the preface of the book.

     Within a day of sending the message, I received a friendly reply.   
Incredibly enough, the very person who had spent months and months of work 
writing this book was ready and able to respond to my own reactions to the 
book.

     The excitement of being able to communicate with someone whose book 
you just read is hard to describe.  The experience is akin to going 
backstage after a play  to chat with the director and actors of the 
production.  Or being invited backstage at the end of a rock concert to 
chat with your favorite performers.

     Truth is, I was already familiar with Heim's work from his earlier 
book, the uniquely insightful, "Electric Language: A Philosophical Inquiry 
Into Word Processing."  I had written a feature length review of this 
earlier book, so I e-mailed Heim a copy of the review .

     Heim was duly appreciative to receive a copy of the review I wrote.  
Actually, it took me all of five seconds to send him the review.  The 
review was already sitting on my hard drive as a text file.  The least I 
can do to show my appreciation of an excellent book is to send the author a 
copy of a review I have written about the book.

     Last year I engaged in an equally invigorating e-mail exchange with 
syndicated columnist Michael Schrage, whose 1990 book, "Shared Minds: The 
New Technologies of Collaboration," has some immensely interesting things 
to say about collaborative creativity.  Schrage is currently working at 
MIT's Media Lab, a place whose mission is to dream and play with all the 
possibilities of converging technologies.  (For a probing report on the 
goings on at MIT's Media Lab, see Stewart Brand's top-notch 1987 book, 
"Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT.")

     The excitement of direct communications between writers and readers 
is something that results in great benefits to both.  Writers, after all, 
derive emotional sustenance from the feedback they get from readers.  The 
very purpose of writing becomes real and tangible when readers are able to 
respond to your books right in your own e-mail mailbox.

     Online communications transforms the "imagined audience" into a "real 
audience."  By doing so, it nurtures the emotional bonds between writer and 
reader.

     The possibilities of writer/reader interaction got me thinking about 
the experiences I had writing a column for my college newspaper.  While an 
undergraduate, I wrote a regular commentary column on the back page of my 
college newspaper.  The words I would write on Sunday evenings at my desk, 
in my room, would be be multiplied 10,000 times to appear in bundles of 
newspaper around campus on Thursday afternoons.  I'd often receive feedback 
from friends within an hour or two after the papers hit the sidewalk.

     The positive feedback created by hearing reader reaction to my ideas 
served as a potent source of creative energy for my next column.  This same 
type of tight feedback between writer and reader is made possible by online 
communications.

     It's only fair to admit, though, that there are some downsides to 
having book readers communicate directly with book authors.  A popular 
author might receive several hundred fan e-mail messages per day.  
Naturally, fans will come to learn that not each and every e-mail message 
can be responded to personally, in detail.

     On the other hand, online communications allows book authors to 
personally involve themselves with the publicity for a book.  Book 
publishers will naturally start favoring those authors ready and able to 
put in the hours to answer online reader responses.  Grueling and expensive 
book signing tours will thankfully take on a lesser role in book publicity.

     Authors who write books on telecommunications subjects, especially, 
will be expected to be available to interact with reader fan mail.  Before 
the turn of the century, it won't be surprising to hear the comment, "I 
can't for the life of me understand why this author didn't include his/her 
Internet address in the beginning of this book.  Perhaps they're one of 
those 'recluse' authors, or something."

Yours For the Downloading
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Charlie Hartley
      [C.HARTLEY3]



     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month we will take a look at 
a variety of files available in the A2 Library.  Let's get started. :)


                                 [*][*][*]

     MAH.JONGG.BXY    File #18729    154240 bytes    GS STRATEGY GAME
     ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                                Mah Jongg 
                    By Chris Heckman and Scott Mathews
                Copyright 1991, 1992.  All rights reserved.
                              Wedge Software.
                             Shareware - $5.00

     Joe Kohn uploaded this game for Wedge Software.  He describes it as a 
"fabulous implementation of the ancient game of Mah Jongg.  Similar to 
Shanghai, but better, as each game is completely different as tiles are set 
at random."

     The following information is based on the READ.ME text file that 
comes with the download.

     The object of the game is to clear all the tiles from the screen.  To 
clear the tiles, you must first find a pair of tiles that match 
identically.  Only matched pairs can be removed from the playing field.  
Also, a tile must be considered as 'free' in order to be removed.

     A tile is considered 'free' if there are no tiles on top of the tile 
you would like to remove, and the tile has either no tiles immediately to 
its left, or no tiles immediately to its right.  Think of it as having to 
slide tiles out to the left or right without disturbing the board.

     Tiles are highlighted and removed by using the mouse.  Error messages 
will prompt you when you try to remove or match up a tile in error.

     A background image sits underneath all the tiles.  If you can clear 
the board, you'll get to see it in its entirety.

     You can load in a new set of tiles if you get bored of the default 
set.  Four tile sets are included with this download.  There are several 
other tile sets in the A2 library.

     S.DASILVA1 has recently uploaded several tilesets for Mah Jongg. Here 
is a list of them.

     File#  File Name          Description

     23864  ENGLISH.BXY        English Tileset for Mahjongg
     23865  FLAGTILES.BXY      Flag Tileset for Mahjongg
     23808  FRENCH.TILE.BXY    French Tileset for Mahjongg
     23897  HARPOON.BXY        Harpoon Tileset for Mahjongg
     23899  HEBREW.TILE.BXY    Hebrew Tileset for Mahjongg
     23807  LAKE.TILES.BXY     Lake Side Tileset for Mahjongg
     23581  NIGHT.TILES.BXY    Night Tileset for Mahjongg
     23721  PATTERN.TIL.BXY    Patterns Tileset for Mahjongg
     23896  SPHERE.TILE.BXY    Sphere Tileset for Mahjongg

     All of these are fairly short downloads, so I recommend that if you 
like Mah Jongg, download all of these are try them out.

     Instructions for creating your own tilesets are included in the 
READ.ME file.

     I like this game a lot.  It requires concentration and foresight. 
There are no "shoot 'em up" tactics here, just solid strategy and a bit of 
luck.

     DESKTOP2.BXY     File #23867     37248 bytes     GS INIT/PROGRAM 
     ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                               DeskSets v1.0
                              by Larry Badten
                                 May 1994
                     JesusAware (similar to Freeware)

     Pat Kern, who uploaded this program, said about it, "Tired of looking 
at the same startup/background screen each time you use your GS? Here's a 
program that will select from several different desktop patterns that can 
be changed daily, each bootup, or find one you like & use it all the time. 
31 patterns are included and you can add others as desired.

     Larry Badten, the author of this program said about it:  "This is a 
combination of an init (DeskSets) and a GS/OS program.  The init must be 
loaded into the boot disks' System/System.Setup folder to become active at 
boot time.  This init looks for two things: 1)  a folder called "DeskTops" 
(located in your boot disks' System folder) which contains the patterns and 
2)  a preference file which will be in your boot disks' System/Preferences 
folder (the program and/or init will create and update this file).

     "The init has several options. They are: 1)  Load a different pattern 
after each x boots (you will enter the value for x); 2)  Load a different 
pattern if the date has changed since the last boot; 3)  Don't change the 
pattern; 4)  Show the boot icon; 5)  Hide the boot icon.

     "The above options may be changed with the program "SetDesks", which 
may be launched from any ProDOS or HFS volume or directory.  Another option 
is to set the next desk pattern to be selected.  If you set a new desk 
pattern, you may elect to have it redraw your current desktop (this allows 
you to view each desktop)."

     This program works as advertised.  I've viewed each of the available 
screens and selected one of them to permanently (until I get tired of it, 
anyway) replace the plain blue screen you normally see with the Finder and 
other desktop programs like ShrinkIt GS.

     Directions are also included explaining how to create your own 
background screens.

     BIRTHDAYS.BXY    File #23887    28672 bytes     DESKSET PICTURES
     ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This upload by Pat Kern contains six more desktop backgrounds for the 
Apple GS DeskSets program by Larry Badten, review above.

     These novelty backgrounds all have something to do with wishing you a 
happy birthday.  Encourage Pat to create more backgrounds by downloading 
these.

         GRNSLEEVE.BXY    File #23872   107648 bytes     MOD SONG
         ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


     Ken Gagne uploaded this Christmas favorite, Greensleeves, better 
known as the Christmas carol "What Child Is This?" Play it with MODZap, 
Sonobox, or any other Amiga MOD player.

     I've played it with Sonobox, and it sound nice.  Download this one 
now and you will have it ready for next Christmas.

       APPLE.SALE.BXY   File #23948    17664 bytes   ADB OF PROGRAMS
       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is an interesting upload. Mr. Nissel [J.NISSEL1] has a list of 
733 pieces of Apple II software that he would like to sell in one large 
package.  While there are some duplications (indicating more than one copy 
of a piece of software available), this is an impressive list of Apple II 
software.

     I recommend that you download this AppleWorks data base file and take 
a look.  If nothing else, it's interesting to see what software he has 
accumulated.  Contact Mr. Nissel for details about what he is asking for 
this package.

      ELECREP95.BXY    File #23940    20992 bytes   ELECTED OFFICIALS
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This download contains a listing of all currently elected Federal 
Senators, Congresspeople, and Representatives of the US Territories, their 
phone #'s and office assignments, as well as the seated Governors for all 
50 States.  It also includes information on how to write to the elected 
officeholders, as well as the President and Vice-President.  All 
information is stored in AppleWorks 3.0 format.  The information is current 
as of 1-15-95.

     This is useful information in an easy to access format. Mr. Katz 
[H.KATZ] is to be commended for making it available.

         GODZILLABAR.BXY   File #23953   26240 bytes  APF GRAPHIC
         ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Joe Kohn uploaded this grayscale graphic titled Barney vs Godzilla: 
The first (and only) chapter.  It is a $C0 filetype SHR graphic.

     The Barney-haters among you will get a kick out of this graphic.  The 
rest will no doubt send hate-mail to Joe (Just kidding, please don't!). 
This is what I call a throwaway download.  Get it because you're curious 
and because it's a small download.  But then, who knows, you might find a 
real use for it. :)

         UNISYS.LZW.TXT   File #23959     5760 bytes    TEXT FILE
         ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This file contains a statement titled "Unisys Clarifies Policy 
Regarding Patent Use in On-Line Service Offerings."  This covers Unisys's 
actions to enforce it's copyright of LZW against Compuserve, as well future 
licensing needed for the use of LZW.

     Since the LZW compression is used in GIF graphics, as well as in 
products such as ShrinkIt which use it to compress and decompress files, 
this issue of potential copyright infringement is of great importance to us 
in the Apple II Roundtables.

     This statement clarifies some of the facts, and answers some of the 
questions that have been asked recently both here and on the Internet.  I 
recommend that you get this file and read it.

         BLOSSOM.NO1.BXY  File #23937   143744 bytes   NEWSLETTER
         ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                             The Apple Blossom
                                    by
                              Steve Cavanaugh

     According to Steve, "The Apple Blossom is a 4 page newsletter about 
current products for the Apple II in AWGS PL format. It uses Bookman, 
Palatino and Times (included in the archive if you don't have them.) I am 
sending it to local schools who often don't know about things like the new 
AppleWorks or Quick Click Calc. If you would like to print this and send 
copies, please feel free to do so. I have around 120 names in my database 
for my area now, and as I am doing this out-of-pocket, I can't put in too 
many more names. Maybe we'll start taking ads in the future? Enjoy."

     This version of The Apple Blossom requires that you have AppleWorks 
GS and Pointless for TrueType fonts.  If you have AWGS, but not Pointless, 
then download file #23943, which uses bitmapped fonts instead.  Steve 
includes Palatino, Times, and Bookman bitmapped fonts with this second 
download.

     I can't actually comment on this newsletter, since I don't have 
AppleWorks GS; but I can tell you that the comments in the bulletin board 
about is have been quite favorable.

       ANSITRMRTC.BXY   File #23874     9472 bytes    RTC TRANSCRIPT
       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is an edited transcript of the ANSITerm Real-Time Conference 
held on Monday, January 9, 1995.  The guest speaker was Paul Parkhurst, 
author of ANSITerm Telecommunications Software for the Apple IIGS. 

     ANSITerm is a full-featured terminal program that offers 
compatibility with PC-based bulletin board systems that use PC-ANSI 
emulation to display colored text and special graphical characters, as well 
as support for VT52 and VT100 emulations. 

     ANSITerm also works well on GEnie and will support CoPilot.

     If you are looking for a new telecommunications program, I suggest 
you take a look at this file.  It provides a wealth of information that may 
help you to decide what to get.

         SPECTRUMRTC.BXY  File #23925  19456 bytes  RTC TRANSCRIPT
         '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is the edited transcript of the Spectrum 2.0 Real-Time 
Conference held on January 16, 1995, in the A2 RTC.  Read this transcript 
for details on Spectrum 2.0's new features and when it will be available.

     Spectrum 2.0, which is a true GS Desktop telecommunications program, 
promises to be a nice piece of software, particularly for those who like to 
write their own scripts.  Even if you are looking for a plug-and-play 
program, you should take a look at this transcript.

                      Freeware for Noncommercial Uses


     Robert Claney has created this program, which will run on any 
computer with 16k.  It will tell you what kind and version of Apple 
computer you have, and how much memory you have.  

     What gives this program it's name, though, is the fact that it scans 
your computer's slots and/or ports, telling you what is present in each 
one.  It will describe in detail the individual devices attached to

will identify the capacity of any drives which are supported by ProDOS.

     If, for some reason, you transfer SlotScan to DOS 3.3, it will work 
there too.  It does require at least 16k in order to run, though.  This is 
probably how you will have to run it on a ][ or ][+.

                     ~ GEnieLamp Profile:  Doug Cuff ~

     This month we will profile our own editor, Doug Cuff.  Doug is not 
only the editor of the GEnieLamp A2, he is also the editor of the monthly 
disk magazine A2-Central, and the author of the delta manual for the new 
AppleWorks 5.


GEnieLamp>   Tell us about your job as editor of GEnieLamp A2.
'''''''''

Cuff>   About the most interesting thing about it is how I got the job!  I
''''    had just rejoined GEnie after a short absence, and heard that Dean 
Esmay was looking for an editor for GEnieLamp A2.  Since it had been 
GEnieLamp A2 that was responsible for making me come back to GEnie--I 
couldn't bear to be left out of the fun any more!--I applied, despite the 
fact that almost no one knew who I was.  I got the job, for the usual No 
Good Reason (no, I was not the only one to apply :-), and GEnieLamp 
editor-in-chief John Peters showed me the Reader's Digest version of the 
ropes.

     An important part of each edition of GEnieLamp is the HEY MISTER 
POSTMAN column, in which each editor selects a digest of the messages 
posted that month on the respective RoundTable.  This requires me and my 
fellow editors to read every single message in every single category.  (You 
don't know how much I sometimes long for the luxury of IGNoring a category 
PERmanently.)  Actually collecting the messages only takes three hours a 
week, but reading them takes much longer.  I have to read every message 
carefully, too, since I'm always on the lookout for Quik Quotes to sprinkle 
throughout the magazine.

     My favourite part of the magazine has always been the profiles.  I'm 
not sure what I've done that's worth profiling.  I only report the news, 
after all.  Others--like Jawaid Bazyar, Randy Brandt, "Brutal Deluxe", Bill 
Heineman, Michael Lutynski, Steven McQueen, Greg Templeman, Bill Tudor, 
Eric Shepherd, Dan Verkade, Joe Wankerl, Mike Westerfield, and dozens of 
others, most of whom I'm just offended by not thinking of their names off 
the top of my head--MAKE the news (by writing the programs).

     My least favourite part of the job is its deadline.  GEnieLamp A2 and 
A2-Central are both due on the same day!  Do you have any idea what it's 
like to edit two monthly magazines, both of which depend on the previous 
month's events, and both of which are due on the same day?  I manage, but 
anyone who thinks it's a lot of fun would have made an ideal companion for 
the Marquis de Sade.


GEnieLamp>   Tell us about your job as editor of the A2-Central.
'''''''''

Cuff>   It gives me the chance to pretend to be Tom Weishaar (which I
''''    ain't, however much I'd like to be), and it gives me the chance to 
work with Steve Weyhrich.  Steve is great.  He'd written columns for 
GEnieLamp A2 for quite some time before he started working at A2-Central, 
but we didn't meet until KansasFest 1994.

     It's also great fun working with Uncle DOS, who writes our letters 
column.  As fictional characters go, he's pretty three-dimensional.  It's 
an amazing kick to be the editor of a newsletter you're a charter 
subscriber of.

     Professionally, it's an odd sort of situation.  ICON, which publishes 
A2-Central and almost a dozen other disk newsletters, is a not-for-profit 
group.  Yet A2-Central pays for submissions (not much, I'm afraid, but we 
do pay), and ICON pays me a small amount (out of which I have to pay the 
authors, which is kind of unusual).  I suppose it's this anomaly that 
causes people to assume we're a major magazine, instead of the newsletter 
Tom Weishaar always envisioned us as being.

     Anything else you'd like to know about working at A2-Central?  I'm so 
close to the subject, I can't imagine what anyone would find interesting 
about it.


GEnieLamp>   Some of our readers may be interesting in submitting to
'''''''''    A2-Central.  Tell us what you might be looking for in the way
             of articles, etc.

Cuff>   If I knew the answer to that, I'd probably write and research the
''''    articles myself!  I guess what I'm looking for is something I 
haven't thought of so far.  I have two pieces of advice for aspiring 
authors, both good for all magazine and newsletter markets:  First, be sure 
you're not submitting an idea that your market has already handled.  
Second, realize that "think pieces" are the prerogative of the editor.  
I've had a few submissions in which the author is basically trying to point 
out that the future isn't so bleak for the Apple II... whether to console 
him/herself, or to console A2-Central's readers, I don't know.  None of 
this is bad, but neither is it good enough.

     To simplify:  Only editors of literary magazines are likely to be 
interested in a piece based on what an author _thinks_.  Editors of news 
magazines are more likely to be interested in what an author _knows_.  
(Editors particularly like authors who research to fill in the gaps where 
they _don't_ know.)  I've got dozens of people who can give me their wry 
observations on the Apple II's mistreatment by Apple Computer, but no one 
so far who has offered to explain exactly what Big Red Computer will be 
offering in 1995.

     Of course, A2-Central is still interested in what Apple II users 
think, same as always.  Just write Uncle DOS and tell him--he's glad to 
listen!  If you have a question or an answer to one, he's just as glad to 
get those.  Be sure to use the new address, though:  6405 Metcalf Avenue, 
Ste. 106, Box 22, Overland Park, Kansas  66202-4080.


GEnieLamp>   Tell us about your experiences as you wrote the Delta manual
'''''''''    for AppleWorks 5.

Cuff>   It was complete and utter madness, and I'd do it again in a minute
''''    if they asked me to.

     It began when Jerry Kindall asked me, in early September, if I'd be 
interested in the job.  When I said yes, he asked me how much I charged.  
I'd already been helping in the beta testing of AppleWorks 5, knew about 
how much work had been done on the program, and made a guess of a week, or 
two at the most.

     Two weeks to write the update manual for AppleWorks 5.  Right.  You 
know, if they held a contest for estimating time to project completion, 
Randy Brandt, Jerry Kindall, and I would all tie for last.  I ended up 
working over 30 days on the manual, and they weren't 9-5 days, either.  
Over the entire period, I think the earliest I went to bed was midnight, 
and there were quite a few nights when I kept working until 3 AM.  All this 
despite the fact that Randy had already written huge chunks of the manual! 
(For instance, I adapted the portion on the Outliner from his Outline 3.0 
manual.)

     All the time I was writing, AppleWorks 5 was still in development, so 
it was possible to write a page in the morning and have it be either 
obsolete or flat-out wrong by the evening.  (It was also possible to spend 
three hours trying to circumvent a bug that prevented me from being able to 
document a feature.)  Randy Brandt couldn't have been nicer.  He read 
several drafts of the manual, and corrected my errors with patience and 
good humour.

     I wrote the manual using AppleWorks 5 itself, but the last few days 
were spent putting the document into a Rich Text Format, so that Jerry 
Kindall could read it on his Mac with my original formatting intact.  This 
saved Jerry so much time, he actually arranged for me to be paid a bonus!  
I uploaded my final draft in mid-October... and that same night, Randy 
phoned me to say he'd added one last feature and ask if it was too late to 
have it in the manual.  (Jerry added those paragraphs, so it wasn't really 
too late.)


GEnieLamp>   How did you first get interested in the Apple II computer?
'''''''''

Cuff>   It's all thanks to--or possibly the fault of--my younger brother
''''    Leslie, who in turn owes his interest to his high-school chum Steve 
Garland.  My brother Les used to play games on his friend's Apple II-Plus, 
and asked for an Apple II for Christmas of 1982.

     On Christmas morning, Les had an Apple II-Plus to play with.  He 
wrote a simple program in BASIC that drew random dots on the hi-res screen, 
and that looked pretty cool.  Not only was it my first glimpse of a 
personal computer--which explains why I was impressed by a pretty quick 
hack--but the hi-res display of random dots looked like a star field.  
(Years of Star Trek had convinced me this was the loveliest possible view.)  
The computer kept drawing dots, which quickly became boring, and the other 
members of the family drifted away.

     "How many dots is it going to draw?" I asked Les.

     "Five thousand," Les replied.

     "Can you make it show how far along it is?" I asked.

     "Sure," said Les, and he interrupted the program.  He added one 
line--one line!--of code, and started the program going again.  Sure 
enough, it was now counting the dots it was drawing.  That was it.  I was 
hooked.  You could make the darned thing respond to your wishes.

     In retrospect, I realize that all Les did was insert a PRINT 
statement in the middle of a FOR-NEXT loop.  Never mind.  At that time, I 
was enormously impressed at how easily you could control the machine.


GEnieLamp>   Do you have any anecdotes you can share with us about your
'''''''''    first experiences with the Apple II?

Cuff>   Not long after my younger brother Les wowed me with a simple PRINT
''''    statement, I picked up the Applesoft BASIC manual that came with 
the machine and started writing programs.  These programs, when run, were 
singularly unimpressive... but I didn't write them to run them.  I wrote 
them to list them, to remind myself of how various commands worked and what 
their syntax was.

     My favourite early moment came when Les borrowed Mission: Asteroid 
(Hi-Res Adventure #0) from his pal Steve Garland.  For weeks, Steve and Les 
had been stuck at the first screen of the game, where you have to get past 
a receptionist by giving a password.  I watched Les type increasingly wild 
guesses for the password, then walk away from the computer in frustration 
with the game still running.  I quickly sat down in his place, never having 
seen an adventure game before.  I had seen Les type "INVENTORY", so I tried 
that.  Practically all that "I" was carrying was a watch, so I typed "LOOK 
WATCH".  It had a button on it, so I typed "PRESS BUTTON"... and the game 
told me the password!  I gave the password to the receptionist, and 
proceeded with the game.  At that point, Les came back into the room.  It 
was a couple of seconds before he could choke out, "How did you _do_ that?"  
Only then did he tell me how long he and his friend had been working on the 
problem.

     With that, I was hooked on adventure games.  Les and I finished the 
game in no time, returned the disk to his friend, and started buying our 
own adventure games.  I remember buying Mystery House (Hi-Res Adventure 
#1)--_years_ after its original release--and finishing it in one weekend.  
I bought Softporn Adventure, the text adventure that later metamorphosed 
into Leisure-Suit Larry, and finished it in one day.  Don't get me started 
on the Infocom adventures, or GEnieLamp A2 will be twice its normal size 
this month!

     For the same reason, don't get me started on when I used to run a 
BBS.  That doesn't qualify as "early years" material anyway.


GEnieLamp>   Running a BBS sounds like an exciting adventure.  Tell us
'''''''''    about your experiences.

Cuff>   Not letting me off that easily, eh?
''''
     My fondest memories of running a BBS are of the friends I made, 
people I wouldn't otherwise have met, and whom I still keep in touch with 
via E-mail.  One of my bulletin board system's leading lights was a young 
lady named Kirsten, who took to dropping by in person every second week or 
so.  One day she brought along her best friend... which is how I met Tara, 
the lady who is now my wife!

     I made other friends, too (didn't marry a one of 'em!) and got to 
visit with them this Christmas just past.  After I closed my BBS, about a 
dozen of us gathered in my living room for a wake!  We celebrated with a 
parody of Poe's poem "The Raven", co-written by my wife and myself.  
(You'll find it reproduced in the October 1994 issue of A2-Central.)

     Running a BBS also provided me with an education--one I needed, but 
one I didn't much relish at the time.  "The astonishing thing," someone 
once said, "is not that most people have a price, but how low that price 
is."  It was frightening to learn how many people considered that they had 
a right to break the rules, because they personally were on the side of the 
angels.  In practice, it didn't matter much, but I lost a few of my 
illusions about human nature.

     More of a problem was a user named Ron who began by applying for 
accounts in several names.  He rapidly moved on to trying to hack in to 
other accounts, including the system operator's (mine), which is a black 
crime.  Fortunately, he wasn't very good at it.  I banned him from the 
system.  In his attempts to get back on, he tried blackmail, he tried 
bribery, he tried threats, he tried ruining my reputation, and he tried 
portraying himself as persecuted.  All of this stopped when his employer 
had him arrested for stealing equipment to the value of--I think--$75,000.  
He was convicted and sentenced to jail.  To replace my lost illusions about 
human nature, I gained some respect for the justice system.


GEnieLamp>   Tell us a bit about your family.
'''''''''

Cuff>   Well, my wife Tara and I have been married for three years, and we
''''    haven't any children yet, so we're an abbreviated family.  We both 
come from Newfoundland, Canada's easternmost province.  (You pronounce 
"Newfoundland" to rhyme with "understand":  nyu-fnd-'LAND.  People who 
stress the middle syllable drive Newfoundlanders crazy.)  We're living in 
London, Ontario while Tara takes her computer science degree at the 
University of Western Ontario.

     My mother and father were both teachers, though by the time I was 
born, my mother had become--well, a mother--and my father was a university 
professor.  I have three brothers:  Jeff and Bob, both older, and Les, who 
is younger.

     The family history really got interesting when my father decided to 
start a publishing company, Harry Cuff Publications.  I started there as a 
shipping clerk, and taught myself most aspects of the business.  I'm 
insufferably proud--according to my brothers, anyway--of the fact that I am 
neither the eldest son, nor the one who joined the firm first, yet was 
still the one who was second in command until I let the firm to join Tara 
in London, Ontario.  Whoops, I've started talking about myself again, and 
not the family.  Next question, please?


GEnieLamp>   What do you consider your proudest accomplishment?
'''''''''

Cuff>   Our marriage.  It's a wonderful thing.  My wife and I communicate
''''    in extremely efficient but sometimes confusing ways.  At a casual 
get-together, we once utterly confounded our hostess--my wife by uttering 
the sentence, "Well, that went through my head like a pregnant earwig!" and 
me by _understanding_ it.  (All Tara meant was "That remark went over my 
head.")  Understanding someone that well produces a warm feeling.  Like 
Fezzik in _The Princess Bride_, my private picture of hell is being left 
alone with everybody going "BOOOOOOOOOOO" at me forever.  Now that I've met 
Tara, I don't have to worry about that any more, and neither does she.


GEnieLamp>   Who do you look up to as your mentors?
'''''''''

Cuff>   These days, I find it's hard to find anyone with the time to act as
''''    a mentor, don't you?  In any case, I prefer jobs that have a 
certain amount of autonomy.  With those sorts of jobs, your superiors throw 
you in at the deep end.  They don't hang about to give advice.  Some of 
them only check back months later, presumably to see if they need to have 
your remains fished out of the pool.

     While they may not have been my mentors, I'd like to use this 
opportunity to compliment a few people:  Jerry Kindall, managing editor of 
_II Alive_, is the best editor I've ever written for.  He often finds a way 
to make my articles just a little bit better and still remains sensitive to 
the author's original intentions.  GEnieLamp chief John Peters provides his 
clear head--none clearer!--when mine is muddled, volcanic, or narcissistic, 
and often provides a shoulder to sob on, too.

     Probably the closest thing I've had to a mentor is my father, whom I 
love dearly.  Oddly enough, he rarely gave me professional advice when I 
was working for the family firm, but outside the office, he sure shapes my 
values and behaviour.


GEnieLamp>   What sorts of things do you like to do for fun (i.e. 
'''''''''    non-computer hobbies)?

Cuff>   I guess programming doesn't count, does it?  I like programming,
''''    but it will never be more than a hobby.

     I enjoy theatre.  For several years, I was a stage manager with 
amateur theatre groups in Newfoundland.  I enjoy theatre-going, too, but 
that's definitely a luxury when you're looking for work, as I am these 
days.  Before I started working on A2-Central, I'd occasionally volunteer 
to usher at one of the professional local theatres, which meant I could see 
the show for nothing, but there's no time for that now.  This past summer, 
my wife and I splurged to see _Othello_ at the world-famous Stratford 
Festival.  I've wanted to attend ever since I was a young'un, and since 
Stratford is only 50 minutes' drive from where I live, the temptation was 
too great.

     I enjoy reading and writing, and am starting to worry at how little 
time I have for reading now that I'm writing for GEnieLamp A2 and 
A2-Central regularly.  I agree with Stephen King's assertion that authors 
who say "I don't have time to read" are like people who start up Mount 
Everest while claiming that they didn't have time to buy rope or pitons.


GEnieLamp>   What do you read for pleasure?
'''''''''
Cuff>  In my early adolescence, I read Agatha Christie; while a university
''''   undergraduate, I read P. G. Wodehouse; and as a graduate student, I 
read Harlan Ellison.

     That's actually a gross oversimplification, and worse, it doesn't 
address the question of what I'm reading now.  Alas, I no longer read as 
much fiction, though I do try to pick up everything by Spider Robinson, and 
occasionally dip into my wife's Heinlein collection or try to borrow a 
Vonnegut I haven't read.  And I still read Harlan Ellison.  When I feel 
like a touch of humour, I'll re-read William Goldman or British author 
Keith Waterhouse.  As a stage manager, I read hundreds of play scripts, and 
still enjoy reading those and television scripts from British series such 
as "A Bit of Fry and Laurie", "Yes, Minister", and so on.  I've read and 
enjoyed exactly one Stephen King book--_Misery_--because it dealt with the 
horrors one human being can inflict on another.  Now _that's_ terrifying.  
Vampires and devils don't do a thing for me, not on the printed page.  
Running into one in real life, however...!

     I read a lot of "light" reference books, ones that present 
information in an entertaining way--Trivial Pursuit could well have been 
invented as a way to make me appear clever--and am constantly searching for 
a well-written biography.  It's astonishing how many poorly-written bios 
there are.  People are fascinating, so why are so many books about them 
dull?


GEnieLamp>   Are computers a part of your daytime job?  Please tell us a
'''''''''    little about what you do between 9 and 5.

Cuff>  Unless you count editing GEnieLamp A2 and A2-Central, I don't have a
''''   daytime job.  (I don't really consider either a day job.  I don't 
get paid for editing GEnieLamp A2, and while I do get a small amount for 
editing A2-Central and that _is_ my only income at present, it pays too far 
below poverty level--which isn't ICON's fault, by the way--to be considered 
a day job.)  I'm looking for work, and that--plus keeping the household 
running--takes up most of my daytime hours.


GEnieLamp>   How long have you been a member of GEnie?
'''''''''

Cuff>   Boy, I'm lucky I keep all my credit card statements--I wouldn't
''''    have been able even to estimate the answer to that one:  I joined 
in 1988, when Tom Weishaar began promoting GEnie in A2-Central.  I called 
infrequently at best, partly because the nearest node was an extremely 
LONG-distance call from Newfoundland, and partly because of the atrocious 
user interface.  I didn't become a regular caller and full-fledged member 
of GEnie's A2 community until 1993.


GEnieLamp>   What new services do you think GEnie should provide its
'''''''''    subscribers?

Cuff>   It should provide better access for modems operating at 9600 baud
''''    and higher, and it should do so as soon as possible.  It's already 
waited too long.  It should provide a more efficient upload protocol than 
XMODEM.  It should provide full access to the Internet, and of course 
they're actively working on that last one.

     One service GEnie doesn't have that CompuServe does is Phone*File, an 
online telephone book--the "white pages"--for the USA.  There's also a 
"Yellow Pages" version that covers Canada and the US.  I like it a lot, and 
hope that GEnie will implement something similar.

     An "old" service GEnie should keep is ASCII-level service, so that 
you don't have to use a fancy-shmancy graphics interface just to log in.  
Businesses that don't have time for the lowest common denominator are going 
to find that their supply of new customers is limited.


GEnieLamp>   What one piece of advice would you pass along to a new
'''''''''    Apple II telecommunications enthusiast?

Cuff>  First of all, join GEnie.  I realize that sounds as though I'm
''''   drumming up trade for the service that publishes GEnieLamp A2, but 
it's genuinely what I advise.  GEnie is _the_ place to be if you use an 
Apple II.  These days, you have to be online to get the best support for 
your Apple II.  CompuServe is no longer the fun place it was.  America 
Online doesn't want to know you any more.  Delphi is still an unknown.  The 
Internet has too much strife too often.  GEnie is the clear winner.

     The only problem is that GEnie's user interface is about as intuitive 
as the second law of thermodynamics.  Therefore, my second piece of advice 
is that you start using an offline message processor like CoPilot or GEnie 
Master (GEM).  I resisted using message processors for years, figuring they 
would require me to abandon the spontaneity of being online.  I was wrong.  
(This happens sometimes.)  Now I recommend CoPilot and GEM every chance I 
get.


GEnieLamp>   What do you see as the future for the Apple II and its owners?
'''''''''

Cuff>   I prefer not to prophesy.  All I can tell you is that it's not over
''''    yet.  I have a feeling that some of us will use our Apple II 
computers until there is no longer a way to patch them up.  Probably Joe 
Kohn and I will be duking it out for the title here, but don't schedule the 
match for any time soon.


GEnieLamp>   Can you offer some advice about software and hardware that a
'''''''''    new Apple II user might invest in?  What do you have and use?

Cuff>   Much depends on what they want to do!  I love AppleWorks, and
''''    wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who has a need for a 
word processor or a data base or a spreadsheet.  (UltraMacros also provides 
a satisfying programming environment.)  I _would_ hesitate to recommend it 
to someone who wants to play games.

     I happen to like Talk is Cheap, the telecommunications program by Don 
Elton.  It's easy to write scripts for it, and it works on Apple IIe's and 
IIc's as well as IIgs's.  If it had ZMODEM, I might never need anything 
else.

     I personally prefer a monochrome monitor because I work with my Apple 
II all day, every day, and the eyestrain that a colour monitor causes in 
ridiculous.  Luckily, I use text-based applications 95% of the time, since 
I'm either using a word processor or telecommunications software, and 
colour is not likely to be vital to either task.  I can't say I recommend 
it for anyone who doesn't do at least 8 hours of word processing in a day, 
though.

     Our computer equipment consists of a ROM 01 IIgs with 4 megs of RAM, 
two monitors (one monochrome and one RGB colour), a 105-meg hard drive, a 
21-meg Floptical drive, a 9600-baud modem that only connects reliably at 
2400, and an ImageWriter II printer.  There's also a IIe with a 20-meg hard 
drive and a 1200-baud modem.

     We also have a 286 laptop on extended loan from my eldest brother, 
but I haven't used it since I dragged it to KansasFest.  It literally 
gathers dust.  MS-DOS is not my friend.


GEnieLamp>   Where do you see the future of telecommunications moving in
'''''''''    the next five to ten years?

Cuff>   This is a difficult question for those who try not to prophesy!  I
''''    have fears that the Internet as we know will be taxed or legislated 
out of existence, but I don't really know how likely that is.  I predict 
that, in ten years, telecommunications will have evolved even beyond my 
capacity to predict.  We're all in for some thrilling, frustrating times.


GEnieLamp>   Doug, it as been a pleasure talking with you.  The Apple II
'''''''''    world is blessed by dedicated, articulate folks like you.
Keep up the good work! :)

Cuff>   Thanks very much for speaking with me.  If anyone has any questions
''''    about GEnieLamp A2 or A2-Central, I hope they'll drop me a line at
editor.a2@genie.geis.com (or just EDITOR.A2, on GEnie).  I love to get 
mail!

     A note to our readers:  If you want to know more about a particular 
person and want him/her to be interviewed for the GEnieLamp A2 profile 
column, send E-mail to C.HARTLEY3 or EDITOR.A2 and we'll see what we can 
do.  In your E-mail message, tell why you think this person is a good 
candidate for the profile.
