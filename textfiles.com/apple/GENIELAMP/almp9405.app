                       >>> GOING THE EXTRA MILE <<<
                       """"""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Deadlines love to lie in wait for me.  What's more, while they're 
waiting, they invite their friends to gang up on me.

     The fact is, I always have at least three monthly deadlines -- not 
counting the rent check -- and they're all exactly the same day:  the last 
day of the month.  GEnieLamp A2 is one of those deadlines, of course, but 
the one that's been giving me the most trouble lately is editing the 
newsletter for the local Apple II user group, the London Apple Corps.

     Two months in a row, my other commitments kept me from finishing the 
newsletter in time for our monthly meeting.  (My other commitments will 
keep me from acting as editor for the London Apple Corps next year, but 
that's another story.)  I was determined not to make it three in a row, and 
bled time from other projects to get as much advance work done on the 
newsletter as possible.

     It wasn't enough to not to be late; this time I had to be early, for 
my parents were paying us a visit over the Easter weekend.  Once my father 
and mother arrived, all work would have to cease.  As my wife -- the 
long-suffering Tara -- and I drove to the airport to greet the travellers, 
one computer was uploading copies of GEnieLamp A2 while another was 
printing out the final proofs of the London Apple Corps newsletter.  When I 
finally dropped the proofs off at the printer, I felt great relief and 
satisfaction.

     Except that the printer, normally reliable, didn't have the 
newsletter ready in time for the meeting.  So I couldn't hand out copies to 
the attendees.  So the group's postage bills were going to be over budget 
again.

     Anger is powerful, but irrational anger has a greater strength.  I 
couldn't do a thing about the fact that I had no newsletters to hand out at 
the meeting, but after the meeting was over, and the newsletters ready to 
be picked up, the thing began to gnaw at me.  I had invested a lot of time 
in trying to keep the postage bill down.  It wasn't my fault that the 
newsletters weren't ready, but that didn't make me any less angry.

     I looked at the pile of newsletters with distaste.  If they'd chosen 
that moment to make a sarcastic remark, I would have chucked the lot into 
the fine-paper recycling bin.  Instead, I hauled out a city map and began 
plotting addresses on it.

     It soon became apparent that there were too many to deliver, so I 
started culling.  Anyone outside the city limits would have to rely on 
Canada Post.  Ditto for anyone who hadn't paid their club dues.  By this 
process, I managed to get it down to a couple of dozen.

     I don't know the city we live in terribly well.  Perhaps that 
accounts for the fact that it took me three and a half hours to deliver 20 
newsletters.  (Some addresses I never did find.  I only hope Canada Post 
fared better.)

     That's how I came to travel the extra mile -- quite literally -- this 
month.  I'm glad I did it, too.  It taught me something about the city I 
live in and even a little something about the members.

     Still, I wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been for someone who had 
just gone the extra mile in a less literal sense:  Harold Hislop.

     If you hang around the A2 RoundTable, you already know how another 
Apple II journal reprinted some advice on hooking up hard drives that Mr 
Hislop had posted.  Unfortunately, that journal missed a minor but 
important correction that he posted afterward.  When a couple of 
subscribers to the journal followed the advice, bad things happened.  We're 
not talking about puffs of black smoke, but something that makes your heart 
sink almost as much:  data loss.

     The subscribers called a bewildered Harold Hislop, who took the view 
-- without pleasure, but also without flincing -- that if the advice had 
his name on it, then it was his responsibility to help the unfortunate 
subscribers.

     Bravo, Harold.  It was remembering this that kept me trudging around 
peering at house numbers when I felt like slinging my stack of newsletters 
into the nearest post-box and charging it to the London Apple Corps.  
Sometimes, knowing that someone else took the responsibility of fixing a 
problem that s/he hadn't created is all the inspiration you need.


                                 [*][*][*]

     You'll notice that there's no PAL Newsletter in GEnieLamp A2.  Don't 
worry, it'll be back next month.

     You'll also notice that there are no CowToons this month.  They won't 
be back new month, because Cowboy Mike has hung up his spurs.  All hail and 
farewall, Mike.

     You'll already have noticed that our profiles of Apple II 
personalities have been absent for a while.  Is anybody missing them?  Is 
anybody bidding a good riddance to bad rubbish.  Can anyone out there hear 
me?  Hello?

MULTI GS   Reply-To: ltchean@iss.nus.sg
""""""""   From: Lim Thye Chean
           Subject: Multi GS

     I am very excited over Multi GS v2.0. In fact I am pretty impress! As 
you might have known, I am a Switch It user, and have been using it for 
quite sometime. So I am writing this mini-review for Multi GS v2.0, from a 
Switch It user perspective.

     Btw, I have also played with The Manager (demo), and the other few 
switchers (including Alan Bird's and LeapFrog).

     Multi GS v2.0 seems to combine the best of both world of Switch It 
and The Manager. It uses similar metaphor of The Manager, where you can 
click on the window to switch application, and all application shares the 
same screen. Like Switch It, it has stack sharing!

     I am very surprise to know that Multi GS stack sharing is even BETTER 
than Switch It! First, it works. :) And it excels Switch It in this: Lets 
say you have stack sharing shares set at 4K, and under Switch It, that 
means that you are not able to run application like AWGS! But Multi GS 
allows! All it does it to create a new stack space for AWGS since it is 
larger than 4K. I think this feature is pretty cool, and should be 
implemented in Switch It in the first place.

     The second feature that impressed me is: it is able to launch ProDOS 
8 program - and beyond what The Manager does - it is also able to launch 
desktop application! You see, manay applications are sure to crash. For 
example - GNO/ME or many games. I try launching GNO from Multi GS, and it 
works beautifully. And upon quitting, returns me to Multi GS. This alone 
can eliminate one of the major reason to buy Switch It.

     Up to my surprise! I can run my own Mandelbrot IIGS v2.2 on Multi GS! 
And I can switch it and out without any problem. Wow. Switch It and The 
Manager simply fails to run it nicely. And I am even more surprise to see 
my other applications such as Super Magic demo to run without any problems. 
I have tested Multi GS with many applications, and with correct setting 
(like some you have to set the write direct to screen as on), this software 
is as stable as both the commercial products. Btw, it runs Proterm fine 
too.

     It is also the only switcher than can load more than one application 
during startup. It can load up to 7! And like The Manager, it traps error 
quite nicely.

     Of course, I am still using Switch It right now, due to some 
"problems" in Multi GS. 

     First - I hate the screen updates! Icons on desktop flashes here and 
there, and this is exactly why I choose Switch It over The Manager in the 
first place. I found that irritating. Backdrop (desktop pictures) also 
drops the background occasionally.

     When switching application and Multi GS trying to close all the DAs, 
if the DAs present a dialog (like ShadowWrite with "Save..."), Multi GS 
will enter infinite loop.

     I can't find the Show window option documented.

     The 3 major reasons I prefer Switch It over Multi GS: 1) Many times 
during switching, there is a noticable pause; 2) Multi GS takes up 11K of 
stack space! 1) Even if I request Multi GS to run Finder on Start up, it 
will load Finder and returns control to Multi GS. This force me to manually 
switch to Finder everytime.

     Personally I think Multi GS is now a very powerful opponent for both 
Switch It and The Manager. It is stable and has many features lack in the 
commercial software. $20 shareware price is very reasonable, and I suggest 
users who has not bought any switcher yet take a close look at this 
software. This might be exactly what you want, with a much lower price.

     For user who has The Manager, the only 2 advantages Multi GS offer 
are ability to launch incompatible GSOS application and stack sharing.

     Switch It seems to be having the least feature among the 3. Its main 
selling point - stack sharinga is unfortunately not as good as Multi GS. 
And since you can't launch GNO from Switch It (but you can launch Switch it 
from GNO), Multi GS will be more attractive to GNO users who use it 
occasionally (like me). But Switch It is a test and proven product, and it 
is faster and less irritating when switching application. 

     I am still using Switch It. But it is a little aging now. It needs 
more functions to be able to fight with The Manager (new version is coming 
out) and Multi GS (with better stack sharing and able to launch GNO). I 
have the following suggestions:

     * Ability to launch ProDOS 8 program.

     * Ability to launch GSOS program (not switch. Switch it just quit 
       Finder and itself and pass control to the software).

     * Needs stack sharing as good as Multi GS.

     * Most important - the main advantage I saw in Switch It is the 
       compatibility with GNO - if somehow it can ALSO be an extension of 
       GNO - this will be able to differential itself from the rest. For 
       example, if GNO attempts to run an application while Switch It is 
       the desktop application, and Switch It able to trap this, this will 
       be very convenient for GNO users.

     * Features like memory map etc will be good.

WHAT DOES THE MANAGER HAVE OVER MUTLI-GS v2.0?   Hmmmm.  Good question.  In 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   my opinion, The Manager 
v1.0 has very little over Multi-GS.

     The only thing I see is that The Manager is more of an "elegant" 
MultiFinder-like utility.  I like the extra menu, and the icon of the 
program you are using as that menu's "title", I like the fact that The 
Manager is not a separate "application"; I don't like having to scroll to 
the _bottom_ of my NDAs to get to another application while using Multi-GS.

     However, Multi-GS seems to currently be more "feature-full".  The 
ability to set up a default of programs to run as soon as Multi-GS is 
loaded, stack sharing, access to a CDA that will put you in Multi-GS so 
that you can get to another application no matter what the "front-most" 
application is doing (some exceptions apply, of course).  TM 1.0 is also 
pretty slow at doing some things because of some of its background 
processing...

     BUT, I am reserving my opinion (and my Multi-GS shareware fee (:  ) 
until the release of TM v 1.1.  I _truly_ believe it will outdo Multi-GS at 
that time.  I think Dave and the beta testers will make TM into a rock 
solid MultiFinder-like utility with all of the "pluses" of Multi-GS with 
all of the current "elegance" that TM offers.  TM will also offer some

FREEWARE FLOPTICAL DRIVERS   I find that by placing a RamFAST SCSI

     I didn't mean to partition any of my disks (except one), but once 
it's there, you cannot remove it with the RamFAST software even if you do a 
low-level format.  One disk *is* divided into one 15-meg and 6 800K 
partitions.  The 15-meg one is a backup of my HD boot partition and the 
remaining six hold System 6.01 disk images.  Very handy for distributing

     Haven't tried that either.  I can't even get the $&$#%! Macs at 
school to recognize the floptical without crashing.  There are using the 
drivers and utility software provided by PLI (I bought the drive at a Mac

TURBO ASB WITH PROTERM 3.1   The Turbo-ASB is a daughter-board addition to 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   the SSC to allow the use of 38400 baud and 
full hardware handshaking. There is a driver for ProTERM 3.1 and the 
Turbo-ASB available for download from The InTrec BBS. When using the 
Turbo-ASB driver with ProTERM 3.1, you dont need to do anything special. 
From the user perspective, the only difference is that 38400 is the maximum 
baud rate instead of 19200. The only RlossS is that 110 baud doesnt work so 
well (not a big deal). In addition to the higher maximum baud rate, the 
Turbo-ASB also corrects a hardware handshaking problem present on many SSC 
boards (this problem can cause extra errors during zmodem uploads). I have 
used the Turbo-ASB and it works great with ProTERM 3.1. I would recommend 
that people who plan to use the Turbo-ASB at 38400 with a //e should have 
some sort of accelerator.

     While it is also possible to use even higher baud rates (57600 & 
230K), it becomes much harder to use and I would only recommend that for 
hardcore hackers.

can be damaged/corrupted in such a way that GSOS can detect it but ProSel 
can't.

     This file cannot be deleted by Finder, but CAN be deleted by the

with Volume Repair, and once this is done, the error message from GSOS 
disappears.

WRITING ADVENTURE GAMES   Oh, you can do a lot with SAM.  But it takes a

system that I can just pump ata into to construct my game, but I don't have 
one.  I had a good system all set up in ORCA/C a couple years ago, but I 
lost it in a hard drive crash.

designed, either in my head or on paper, but I haven't got a good way to 
crank them out. :(

<<<<<   What I want to see in a text-adventure design system (having tried
"""""   a lot of them :):

     1. The ability to create LOTS of rooms.  Many adventure design 
systems have a limit of less than 100 rooms, and that won't cut it for some 
of my more complex games.  I designed a game once with over 1,200 rooms in 
it!

     2. Directions including northeast, southwest, etc, as well as in and 
out.

     3. Nested objects -- a piece of paper tucked in a book in a desk 
drawer in a desk on top of a rug.

     4. Complex objects -- objects whose descriptions and information can 
change over time.  An object may be worthless until you have done something 
else.

     5. A reasonable parser.  Commands like "Bill, put the blue onion into 
the rightmost pot" should be accepted.

     6. Expandability -- the normal verbs go, use, open, close, eat, and 
take aren't enough to make a good game.  I need verbs like pull, push, tie, 
cut, hide, and other things like that.  I should be able to tack new verbs 
in (this is the primary thing that stalled me with SAM).

     There's more, but I won't get into it now.

     My problem with SAM and my adventure was this:

     The game begins in a cell at the top of a tower.  The ceiling is 
cracked and is clearly ready to collapse, but is being held upright by a 
sturdy beam.  A sturdy bunk is fastened to the wall, and on the bunk is a 
horse blanket (the really rough, scratchy kind).  There's a sturdy door, 
very tall, and mounted above the door (too high to reach) is an axe.  A 
window lets you see the grey and decimated landscape outside.

     If you stop to look at the beam, you'll notice that there's water 
trickling down it.

     If you mess with the beam, it slips and the ceiling crashes down on 
you. Not only are you buried under a few hundred pounds of rock, but you 
also notice, just before you die, that thousands of gallons of water pour 
down onto you.

     The solution to the "get out of the cell" puzzle was to be this:

     Get the blanket and tie it to the beam, then duck down under the 
bunk. Give the blanket a yank, and the ceiling (and the water above) come 
down. You then get out from under the bunk (still underwater) and swim to 
the surface, where you find yourself within easy reach of the axe.  You 
then grab the axe and break the door open with it.

     The problem was that to implement this in SAM, all the player had to 
do was pick up the blanket, then click USE and the blanket would get tied 
to the beam (since there's no TIE command).  Then if they clicked USE 
again, the beam would move and the ceiling would collapse.

     SAM's limited command set gave away the solution to the puzzle. 
Implemented in a text adventure, I think my puzzle would be pretty good 
(not spectacular, but reasonable).  In SAM, there isn't a puzzle, really.

A EULOGY FOR APPLIED ENGINEERING   I have extremely mixed feelings about 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   the demise of Applied Engineering.

     At first, I just couldn't believe the news that they'd gone out of 
business. So, I tried calling them. "The number you have reached is not in 
service at this time."

     I own a number of AE products, including a Vulcan Hard Drive, a 
PCTransporter, an AE-RAM card, a DataLink modem, and a TransWarpGS. At the 
point when I realized that I had more AE equipment inside my GS than Apple 
equipment, I even affixed an AE logo sticker to the front of my computer.

     Like many in the Apple II world, I was upset and felt sleighted when 
they started charging Apple II owners for "tech support." But, I understood 
the reasons; they were a company struggling to stay alive.

     Please remember that for many years, AE provided the Apple II world 
with hardware galore. For a long time, they also supported several of the 
Apple II magazines with page after page of ads. I used to be involved with 
the Apple IIGS Buyer's Guide, and know for a fact that the revenues 
generated by AE's ads kept that magazine afloat.

     Over the years, AE employed many loyal Apple II engineers and 
programmers, and provided the Apple II world with a steady source of new 
(albeit expensive) hardware. I personally became friendly with several AE 
employees, and now feel bad for them, and their families, as they line up 
for unemployment.

     Although it's been several years since I've purchased anything from 
AE, I'm saddened by their demise. For the longest time, AE was the number 1 
supporter of the Apple II, and I don't think that we should ever lose sight 
of  that.

     As with the death of anyone, it's far better for the living to 
remember the dead from the era of their lives when they were vital and 
enthusiastic. For the longest time, AE was a great friend of the Apple II 
world, and I for one would rather dwell on those good times, and look back 
fondly at AE's contributions.

     I can still clearly remember the thrill of plugging in my first GS 
memory expansion card, and having a whopping 1.5 megabytes of RAM. Thanks 
AE.

     I can still clearly remember the thrill of adding 100 megabytes of 
hard disk storage to my system. Thanks AE.

     I can still clearly remember the thrill of stepping up to 2400 baud. 
Thanks AE.

     I can still clearly remember the thrill of inviting one of my MS-DOS 
friends over to marvel at my Apple that could run IBM software...faster 
than my friend's XT. Thanks AE.

     I can still clearly remember the thrill of running my GS 3 times 
faster than other GS owners. Thanks AE.

     Thanks, AE, for all the good times. May you rest in peace.

classes.

     Now, I think the promised Fax software is based on the Rockwell 
chipset, as opposed to the Sierra chipset that the LineLink uses. It should 
be compatible, though....

     --- later ---

     I just called the technical support number listed in the LineLink 
manual. The technician told me that the LL uses a 'new' chipset that Sierra 
has developed, and it's compatible with the Rockwell chipset. He also said 
that if a particular fax program doesn't have a selection for the Sierra 
chipset, use the Rockwell one and everything will be fine. He also told me 
that I should use the MacFax software that MacWharehouse sells, as that's 
the software they (the technical support line) support. :)

     So, if you have a LineLink, this new Fax software will work just 
fine. :)

ALLTECH ARRIVES ON A2!   A Short bit of historical info:
""""""""""""""""""""""   
     Alltech Electronics Co has been around since 1983. The founder/owner 
of the company has been around the Apple II since then. Having worked with 
Vista Computer Company (Which is now ACP). Vista used to make floppy  
drives for the Apple II, one of which was the Vista 1500. A Removable 5.25" 
"magazine" that would hold 5 5.25" disks and "reach out" and get the disc 
you requested and pull it into the drive. Very similar to todays multi-cd 
players. It was very popular with BBS sysops back then.

     Alltech has three southern California stores that specialize mainly 
in PC stuff and surplus electronics p arts/equipment. The Oceanside store,  
the newest of the three, opened in 1989 is where the Apple II operations 
are centered. Alltech began mail order Apple II peripheral sales around 
1987 with a Disk ][ compatible, Full Size 5.25" drive, which we still sell 
many today.

     I came apon Alltech in 1989 when the store appeared here in Oceanside 
less than 2 miles from my house.

     Since opening the third location, and moving all the Apple II related 
operations here, we began to provide service and parts as well as expand 
the amount of products available and include new products as well, 
something we're not really known for. We do sell/stock new items as well. 
Mainly hardware items. For software sales, if we don't have it, we 
recommend other sources like Quality Computers, Big Red, Seven Hills, etc.

     We specuaialize in hard to find and older items, and. We do repairs 
on just about any Apple II peripheral. All refurbished products are fully 
checked out before shipping. Items such as printers are torn down to the 
bare bones and completely cleaned and re-assembled and tested prior to 
being sold.

     We can be thought of as "recyclers" in a way, because when we come a 
accross a large supply of something out there than can be used as an Apple 
II item, with some or no modification at all, we, we do in order to bring 
more products to the Apple II. Things as simple as the IBM PS/2 Model 25 
carry case that fit a GS system so perfectly, it could have been called a 
"IIgs system transport case" from day one. Another example is the Atari ST 
RGB Monitor we had recently, and now the CGA for the //c, a 100%  
compatible RGB color monitor solution, for only $129.00.

     We have products and services for the Apple ][/][+, //e, //c & IIgs. 
We even have parts & service availble for the Apple /// and some Lisa/Mac 
XL stuff too!

     We will be moving soon, to a 30,000 sq. foot building with 2 stories 
and the phone numbers/address will change. The 800 line will remain the 
same and the exhisting phone number/address info will remain valid as the  
local retail portion of the current location will remain .

MUCH ADO ABOUT SHAKESPEARE   I am posting this on behalf of Larry McEwen
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   (L.MCEWEN) who has uploaded his 6-disk 
Hyperstudio stack collection called, "Much Ado About Shakespeare."

                                 [*][*][*]

     MUCH ADO ABOUT SHAKESPEARE was created during 1990 and 1991.  During 
that period of time I was growing an intra-spinal-cord tumor.  I finished 
it the night before my entry into the hospital for spinal cord surgery the 
next morning.  On that day, my wife walked from the hospital to a nearby 
postal service center and sent all six disks to Roger Wagner Publishing.  
Roger was beginning to collect stacks created by HyperStudio users and 
Steven Allen was working with him to make selections.  A short time after I 
was dismissed from the hospital, Steven Allen called me and we agreed upon 
$29.95 as the price of the finished product.  During the next few months, 
v2.0 of MUCH ADO ABOUT SHAKESPEARE was finished and was advertised in the 
Roger Wagner Publishing Company catalog at $29.95.

     This is an improvement over those early versions.  Because my immune 
system continued to deteriorate, I found that I was sick more days per 
month than well.  Finally, I faced the fact that I could no longer work 
productively and was disabled.  As a hobby for those very few days in some 
months when my energy level allowed me to dabble with the IIgs, I finished 
v3.11 of MUCH ADO ABOUT SHAKESPEARE.

     MUCH ADO ABOUT SHAKESPEARE is not in the "Public Domain" and it may 
not be copied and given to another.

     It is copyrighted by Larry B. McEwen, and may not be legally used 
unless $25.00 has been sent to the national office of:

     MUCH ADO ABOUT SHAKESPEARE
     3565 Ellicott Mills Drive, Unit B2
     Ellicott City, MD, USA, 21043

     Please do this within two to three weeks.

     This is a good cause and we need help.  The first case of Primary 
Immune Deficiency Disease which caught the public's eye and ear was the 
case of the "Houston Bubble Boy", a boy who lived in 1950's Texas.  His 
story was made into a movie.  A very young John Travolta starred as the 
"Bubble Boy" whose short life was contained within that plastic sterile 
environment.

     The Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases do not receive the attention 
that the HIV "AIDS" cases do.  Our cases do not get the headlines, and they 
do not get the political attention or the budgetary appropriations.

     If you wish to have a Home.Stack without the appeal, I will send you 
one if you will send me a copy of your receipt from the IDF and your name 
and address.

     Thank you for your help and kind consideration.  Thank you!

CYNTHIA FIELD JOINS SHAREWARE SOLUTIONS II   Although I'll shortly be 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   writing up a Press Release to 
"officially" announce a change to Shareware Solutions II, I'm so excited, I 
just wanted to share the excitement with all my friends online.

     For several years, I was proud to share the inCider/A+ masthead with 
Cynthia Field. Of all of us involved with inCider/A+, it was generally 
Cynthia's articles that I turned to first, as they always included 
information that I could learn from. Over the years, she just had a way of 
finding out about new Apple II products, long before anyone else did.

     Cynthia Field's credits in the Apple II wold re long and varied. She 
currently is a Contributing Editor to NAUG's AppleWorks Forum. Many of you 
may also remember that Cynthia Field was hired by Apple Computer Inc to 
write the Apple II Newsletter. And, more recently, many will remember that 
Cynthia wrote inCider/A+'s New Product section.

     I'm pleased and proud to announce that Cynthia Field will be sharing 
her knowledge of the Apple II with subscribers to Shareware Solutions II. 
Starting in Issue #5, due to "go to press" this month, and in every issue 
thereafter, Cynthia Field will be writing a new column, tentatively titled 
"New Apple II Products."

     In each issue of Shareware Solutions II, Cynthia will be writing 
about new Apple II commercial software products and new hardware products. 
Details, of course, still need to be worked out as to the exact format of 
Cynhias column, but knowing her as I do, I wouldn't be surprised if she 
wrote about 10-15 new products that even the most die-hard Apple II fan 
hadn't heard of before.

     Is this great news, or what?

have proved to be very stable and free of data corrupting bugs. In fact, 
the only "bug" we had to fix since opening sales was a small problem due to

   - Confirm if '*.*' specified or defaulted
   - A directory name specified deletes all files in the directory
     (after confirmation!)
   - Wildcard deletes can no longer affect '.' and  '..' entries

MCOPY:
   - Use JudgeName call to convert filenames only if necessary
   - Better support for copying to non-ProDOS (eg. HFS) volumes
   - Added '/O' option (overwrite existing files automatically)
   - Defaults for '/B' & '/O' now easily patchable

   - Defaults for '/B' & '/O' now easily patchable
   - Unlike all other utilities, GMCopy now no longer supports
     the old command syntax where the device number followed the
     command name

MRENAME:
   - Now renames files in subdirectories as it was supposed to do!

FINDMFM:
   - Displays device numbers of MSDOS devices in decimal, not hex

MMD:
   - Added utility to create directories

MRD:
   - Added utility to remove directories

     You could also add that only registered users get the MMD, MRD and 
MPatch utilities.

     V2.11 will be a minor update to support PC Transporter logical 
volumes larger than 16Mb (ie. with two ProDOS files), and with additions to 
MFormat to improve use with the BlueDisk (eg. more disk sizes supported, an 
option to use the GS/OS format dialogue for the low-level format).

MORE ABOUT AUSTRALIAN SHAREWARE   In another topic, long away and far 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   away...

     The subject came up of paying shareware fees to Peter Watson for his 
MS-DOS Utility package.

     After getting an email this week from someone asking if they should 
send Peter's shareware fee to me, it was suggested that I post my reply in 
public.

     A while back, I did Peter Watson a favor. He sent me a few hundred 
dollars worth of US checks, and I cashed them, and sent Peter one check in 
return. That way, he only had to pay one bank processing fee.

     Right after we did that, Peter spoke to his banker again, and found 
out that what we'd done was unnecessary. The upshot of the whole matter is 
that Peter can cash personal US checks at his Australian bank.

     Whether he brings in one check, or twenty, he only has to pay a 
single $5 service charge. So, Peter is not cashing the checks immediately, 
but when he has $100 or $200, he'll bring them in, and be able to cash them

     Does anyone have v2.1 of John MacLean's DOS 3.3 Launcher? If so, 
could you please upload it.

     Apparently, John does not currently have use of an Apple II, but he 
completed an update to DOS 3.3 Launcher recently, and now swears that he 
sent it to me. He didn't, or if he did, I never got it. I can't track it 
down anywhere, and John is a bit hazy on who he sent it to.

     Did he send it to *YOU* ?

     If he did, I want it! Please upload it. Thanks!

     I'll have an ask around locally about 2.1 of DOS Launcher. I know I 
only have 2.0.

     John also completed yet another Graphics Exchange toolset disk about 
two or three years back, that RWP never released. Devoted Graphics Exchange 
owners may like to pester RWP for that one.

PRINT SHOP GS H-P DRIVERS   > How's Bill Heineman coming on the PSGS HP 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   > Color Printer Drivers?

     The timing of your question is kind of amazing. I just got off the 
phone with the BurgerMeister, not 2 minutes ago.

     As I'd mentioned in the last issue of SSII, the project turned out to 
be a lot more difficult and time consuming than originally anticipated. 
Apparently, Bill has had to come up with patches for 17 different PrintShop 
GS files. Originally, he thought that he'd need to patch only one or two 
files. But, with the patches applied, he says that PSGS now runs much 
faster, and due to the changes he's made, even those who own an ImageWriter 
will see improvements.

     At this point, he is quesstimating that it'll be only a few more 
weeks until he sends me a full working program.

     Then, of course, a testing phase needs to occur, and if it passes 
that, then I'll need to write some documentation. So, it's still going to 
be a while.

     But, according to Bill, the drivers WILL be done, and maybe we will 
be printing Memorial Day signs and banners on our HP printers?

     Speaking of PSGS, I can't believe that I've had that program so long, 
and only yesterday found out about an Easter Egg. Run the program, and look 
at the main menu. Then, re-set your IIGS clock to December 5-31, and look 
at the PSGS main menu again.

WHITHER PROTERM?   A while back a friend brought my attention to a thread 
""""""""""""""""   here which involved some speculation of the future of 
InTrec Software. I found and read through the related parts of the thread 
which seemed to be summed up in the following statements:

> In other circles, this is popularly referred to as "pulling a
> Beagle".
>   :-/

> Exactly my point.  Let me blunt:  InTrec is working on Mac & PC versions
> of ProTERM.  I consider ProTERM to be a great product, and would hate for
> InTrec to go the way of Beagle Bros and Applied Engineering.

     Pardon my jousting here, I can't resist a flipant cyncal reply: 
Beagle only had Point To Point and AE had Ready Link -- We have ProTERM! 
<grin>

     Excuse my moment of artistic freedom, now on with the serious stuff.

     After reading the thread and signing off, I thought it would set 
minds at ease if I explained our official position and policy on the 
subject. The piece got lengthy and after I got to a point where I thought I 
had all the bases covered, I saved it and got some Zzzz. The next morning I 
read through the text and had second thoughts about posting what to me had 
been good therapy, but to others would be boring and perhaps appear self 
gratifying. So I have not posted my (expanded) thoughts but will give the 
"Reader's Digest" version.

     Our plans are to release ProTERM/Mac in the not too distant future 
(possibly during the Summer months), and when it is released, we will 
continue to support ProTERM/A2. In fact, our strategy is the same as it was 
the day Greg Schaefer and I sat down over a couple of beers and decided 
this is what we wanted to do and they are listed in the same order of 
priortiy as they were on day one.

     o  Develop a strong telecom position by improving a product that was 
        already established in the marketplace. 

     o  Develop a version for the Macintosh platform and establish it in 
        the market.

     o  Develop a version for the PC platform and establish it in the 
        market.

     o  Look back to see what is needed to bring the Apple II product up 
        to date.

     Even then, our intention was for each product to be complimentary to 
the others. As planned, ProTERM/A2 built our company and gave it a solid 
foundation, and now ProTERM/Mac will provide the resources to build our 
strength. We consider the different products to be like siblings which will 
compliment each other in the same market. When all three are out, we will 
again look at ProTERM/A2 for a revise. All three of those product will 
allow us to support a broad base telecom market.

     At that point, we will look at whatever else may show promise, 
including another part of our original plan, offer a publishing/marketing 
platform for programmer-authors who want to maintain control of their 
products like we've done for Greg Schaefer.

     Will we "...pull a Beagle?" (to reference the exact phrase)

     Our product development of each of the ProTERM/A2 3.0 and 3.1 took 
longer than we expected. ProTERM/Mac has been the same. But our track 
record for delivering dependable products stands, and we expect it to 
remain. It does take time to do it right, but its a metter of not being 
intimidated by those who would like to see the new product. No good whine 
before its time. ;-)

     This is getting out of hand again so that's it. Hopefully that will 
end the speculation about our allegiance or our plans about new releases.

     Oh, there was one other question, "Will we be bought out by a 
monster?" Its doubtful. Truth is, we enjoy what we do, and if we sold the 
toys, the dream would end. To quote another Apple II guy who made it but 
walked, and is now still trying to make his NEXT venture, "The Journey is 
the Reward." Hey! That would be an excellent title for a book!

     For those of you who might not know. Sheppy doesn't just write 
extradornary programs for the II. Occassionaly. he turns into a knight in 
shinning armour and charges in on a white horse to safe people from 
disasters.

     At our last meeting one of our members who is unemployed showed up 
with a hard drive problem. The partition with all his programs had 
disappeared from his hard drive. Obviously, he was very concerned and did 
not know what to do. Sheppy took a quick look at the problem at the meeting 
and then took the hard drive home with him. By the next morning, he had 
recovered almost all of the lost files.

     This kind of dedication and help is greatly appreciated by all of us 
in the Apple II community.

     What would happen if God had to do it all over again?

     AND GOD SAID:

     "IN THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH."  He was then faced 
with a Notice of Violation and a class action lawsuit for failing to file a 
Part A notification and an environmental impact statement with HEPA 
(Heavenly Environmental Protection Agency), an angelically staffed agency 
dedicated to keeping the Universe pollution free.

     God was granted a temporary permit for the heavenly portion of the 
project, but was issued a "cease and desist" order on the earthly portion, 
pending further review by the HEPA.

     Upon completion of His construction permit application and 
environmental impact statement, God appeared before the Heavenly 
Environmental Protection Commission to answer unresolved questions 
regarding His application.

     When asked why He began these projects in the first place, God simply 
replied that He liked to be "creative."  This was not considered adequate 
reasoning; and God was required to substantiate this further.

     HEPA was unable to see any practical use for earth, since "THE EARTH 
WAS VOID AND EMPTY, AND DARKNESS WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP."  And God 
said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT."  He really should never have brought up this 
point, since one Commission member was very active in the Sierrangel Club 
and immediately protested, stating "How was light to be made?  Would it be 
a nuclear-powered or coal-fired generating plant?  Would there be strip 
mining?  What about thermal pollution? Air pollution?  Universal warming?"  
God explained that the light would come from a huge ball of fire.  No one 
on the Commission really understood this, but it was provisionally accepted 
assuming (1) there would be no smog or smoke resulting from the ball of 
fire, (2) a separate burning permit would be required, and (3) since 
continuous light would be a waste of energy, it should be dark at least 
one-half of the time.  And so God agreed to "DIVIDE THE LIGHT FROM THE 
DARKNESS, AND HE CALLED THE LIGHT 'DAY', AND THE DARKNESS 'NIGHT'."  (The 
Commission expressed no interest with in-house semantics.)

     When asked how the earth would be covered, God said "LET THERE BE 
FIRMAMENT MADE AMIDST THE WATERS, AND LET IT DIVIDE THE WATERS FROM THE 
WATERS."  One ecologically radical Commission member accused Him of 
double-talk, but the Commission tabled action since God would be required 
first to apply for a "firmament" permit from the ABLM (Angelic Bureau of 
Land Management), would be required to obtain water permits from the 
appropriate agencies involved, and further, insure that construction of any 
firmament would result in no net loss of wetlands.

     The Commission asked if there would be only water and firmament, and 
God said "LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH THE GREEN HERB, AND SUCH AS MAY SEED, 
AND THE FRUIT TREE YIELDING FRUIT AFTER ITS KIND, WHICH MAY HAVE SEEN 
ITSELF UPON THE EARTH."  The Commission agreed to this, as long as only 
native seeds were to be used.

     About future developments, God also said "LET THE WATERS BRING FORTH 
THE CREEPING CREATURE HAVING LIFE, AND THE FOWL THAT MAY FLY OVER THE EARTH 
UNDER THE FIRMAMENT OF HEAVEN."  Here again, the Commission took no formal 
action, since this would require approval of the Game and Fish Commission, 
coordinated with the Heavenly Wildlife Federation and the Audubongelic 
Society.

     It appeared that everything was in order until God said that He 
wanted to complete the project in six days.  At this time He was advised by 
the Commission that His timing was completely out of the question.  HEPA 
would require a minimum of six to nine months to review the permit 
application and environmental impact statement, and then there would have 
to be a 45-day public comment period followed by public hearings.  After 
any and all public comments were considered, it could feasibly take 12 to 
18 months before a permit could be issued.

     And God said, "THE HELL WITH IT!"

         >>> SOME THOUGHTS ON THE ECONOMICS OF ELECTRONIC MAIL <<<
         """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The United States postal service has proposed raising the price of a 
first class stamp from 29 cents to 32 cents. Like many other people, I'm 
adamantly opposed to this proposed increase.  It doesn't go nearly far 
enough.  An extra three cents per stamp?  Oh, come on.  If the postal 
service truly had the best interests of the nation in mind it would raise 
first class postage to 40 cents per stamp.

     Here is why:

     The low price of postage stamps continues to foster an economy based 
on shuffling papers and envelopes around the country.  Each year billions 
of letters get stuffed into billions of envelopes that get mechanically 
hauled in aging postal service trucks to technologically undernourished 
sorting centers that channel the mail to overaged airplanes that fly 
crowded skies to understaffed airports, channeling the mail back to aging 
postal service trucks driven by underpaid postal carriers who are mandated 
to deliver the mail through inclement weather even though they may not be 
feeling well.

     It's not quite that bad.  But it's close.

     By golly, it doesn't have to be this way.  If the price of postage 
stamps were increased to 40 cents, a lot of homes and businesses would 
start getting interested in using electronic mail.

     Suppose the Federal government adopted a policy to encourage the 
entire nation to get connected up online.  As a hypothetical example, 
suppose the Federal government placed an eight cent surcharge on the new 
postage stamp to help fund this goal.

     With the revenues from such a government subsidy, computer 
manufacturers could produce an inexpensive dumb terminal that could sell 
for $50.  This would be a disk-driveless machine.  Just keyboard, 
monochrome monitor, and dedicated terminal program.

     Plug this device into any phone jack, and you're connected to the 
information highway.   Using this device you can send and receive 
electronic mail to your heart's content.  No per message charge.  After 
all, e-mail takes up just a tiny section of network bandwidth.

     Now, if you want to trudge over to the post office in the freezing 
rain to stand in a long line to buy stamps, you should have the perfect 
right to do so.  It's a free country.

     But the government should make it its business to help promote 
electronic communications.  Listen, communications is the vital engine of 
all commerce.  It happens to be the engine of education, medicine, science, 
art and a few other things that are thought to have a positive effect on 
the social good.

     Streamlined communications means streamlined everything else.  
Slow-poke communications means slow-poke everything else.

     Someone once did a study to find out the real price of mailing a 
business letter.   Well, it takes about ten minutes to write a one page 
business letter.  Then it takes two minutes to print it.  One minute to 
fold it.   Three minutes to address the envelope.   Another minute to fold 
and seal the envelope.  A minute to stamp the envelope and throw it in the 
bin to be picked up by aging postal service trucks, to be hauled to...  
well you get the idea.

     The time that it takes to send one letter doesn't seem overly 
inefficient.  But if you multiply the inefficiencies of one business letter 
by a couple of billion, you arrive at a humongous collective inefficiency.

     One of the best ways of making this country more competitive in the 
international marketplace would be to raise the price of first class 
postage to a sufficiently high level that individuals and businesses start 
taking electronic mail seriously.

     Imagine the fear such an action would strike in the hearts of big 
business in Japan. The country that invented the telephone, the light bulb, 
the airplane, the transistor, and rock-and-roll -- all connected up with 
near instantaneous online communications.

     Such a prospect ought to cause a few people to lose sleep on the 
other side of the Pacific.   And for good reason.  It's as efficient to us 
as it is threatening to them.

Polishing Green Apples

                    >>> HOOKED ON STORAGE (Part 3) <<<
                    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

INITIALIZATION   Last month I concentrated on hard disk solutions for the
""""""""""""""   Apple IIc, and some tips on use for that computer.  This 
month the discussion turns to assembling a mass storage system for the 
Apple IIs that have slots -- the II Plus, IIe, and IIgs.


"INNIES" VS "OUTIES"   Slots make adding features to a computer system MUCH
""""""""""""""""""""   easier.  That has been the major strength with the 
Apple II series (except for the IIc) from the beginning.  Even the 
Macintosh finally had to crumble to popular demand and make some sort of 
internal expansion slots available for users who wanted to upgrade and 
enhance their system.

     Despite the help that slots give us, there are still two OTHER 
choices that must be made when selecting a hard drive.  The selection of an 
internal versus an external drive has mostly to do with cost and aesthetics 
(i.e., whether or not you mind having your desktop cluttered with extra 
boxes attached to sockets on the back panel).  In some situations, an 
internal drive package may be available at a lower total cost than an 
external drive, since the external needs the addition of a controller card 
(which usually comes packaged with the internal drive).


INTERNAL DRIVES   The internal drives themselves come in two basic forms.
"""""""""""""""   One type is completely self-contained on a card that 
simply plugs into a slot.  Some examples of these "hard card" types of 
drives include the Zip hard drive (sold by Zip Technologies, the makers of 
the Zip Chip and Zip GS card), several models of self-contained hard drives 
sold by Charlie's Appleseeds, and the Focus Hard Card sold by Parson's 
Engineering (which is very similar to the Zip hard drive).  The primary 
advantage of it is ease of use; you plug it in, turn the computer back on, 
and you have 20 megs or more of storage available, WITHOUT any extra wires 
trailing from the back of the computer.  The primary disadvantage of these 
drives is that you can ONLY have that one drive attached to the computer on 
that slot; if you want to add another hard drive, you will need to use 
another slot.  On the Apple IIe this may not be too great a problem, but on 
the IIgs it may require disabling one or more of the built-in features that 
already require a slot.

     The other type of internal hard drive common to the Apple II series 
is one in which the computer's power supply (that large metallic box to the 
left when you remove the top from the computer) is replaced by another 
power supply that also just happens to contain a hard disk drive assembly. 
A cable runs from the power supply/hard drive to an interface card in one 
of the slots.  Historically, internal hard drives for the Apple II series 
have been of the IDE type control protocol, rather than the more 
commonly-used SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) protocol.

     Examples of this type of internal hard drive include the Applied 
Engineering Vulcan, Applied Ingenuity's InnerDrive, and the Pegasus drive 
made by Econ.  None of these is currently available new, but can be found 
on the used market.  The Pegasus drive differed from the others in that it 
used a SCSI controller.  This has usually been an advantage over the IDE 
type of drive, primarily because of better speed obtainable with the SCSI 
interface cards.


TURBO IDE CARD   SHH Systeme, a company located in Germany, manufactures a
""""""""""""""   controller card they call the Turbo IDE.  It significantly 
improves performance of IDE drives, including older ones like the Vulcan 
and InnerDrive.  (In fact, the online "ads" I've seen for the Turbo IDE 
claim that "We make IDE drives RAMfast!", a take-off of advertising done by 
CV-Tech for its RamFAST SCSI card.)  The Turbo IDE uses DMA (Direct Memory 
Access) to achieve its higher speeds of data transfer.  This means that the 
block of memory being transferred to or from the disk drive is directly 
accessed, rather than being moved first to ANOTHER place in memory, and 
THEN being sent to the disk.

     Since IDE drives seem to cost a bit less than SCSI drives of the same 
size (at least in a quick review of ads in PC-based magazines), this could 
be a more affordable solution without any loss of performance.  
Furthermore, the Turbo IDE card will significantly speed up the operation 
of older Vulcan drives, prolonging their usefulness.  Also this card will 
support up to =two= IDE drives, so an older Vulcan plus another larger IDE 
drive could both be used.

     The utilities disk that comes with the Turbo IDE Card has its own 
formatter that is able to reformat a Vulcan drive from its original 7:1 or 
5:1 interleave to 1:1 or any other value desired (which may improve 
performance).  A complete format takes anywhere from three to eight 
minutes, depending on the size of the drive.  The Turbo IDE supports ANY 
type of IDE drive; starts up in less than a second (there is no chain of 
devices that has to be scanned, unlike SCSI cards); and it takes only nine 
seconds to get to the Finder on a minimum IIgs system, and less than a 
second to get to ProDOS 8.  Finally, it is possible to boot from any of 16 
partitions on two drives at the user's request without any extra boot 
utility, selected at boot time.


EXTERNAL DRIVES   External hard drives are more widely used in the Apple
"""""""""""""""   world at this time, primarily because of Apple's decision 
to include a built-in SCSI port on their newer model Macintosh computers.  
For the Apple II, SCSI requires two pieces of hardware:  a SCSI interface 
card, and the SCSI drive itself.  Because of the flexible design of the 
SCSI protocol, it is possible to attach up to seven devices to a standard 
SCSI card, and not all of those devices need necessarily be hard drives.  
Tape backup drives, magneto-optical and Floptical drives, and CD-ROM drives 
can be attached to most SCSI cards.  The limits may be more constrained by 
the system software than by the system hardware; whereas the Apple IIgs can 
easily accommodate all of the above mentioned devices, it may be more 
tricky for the IIe.  If you have a IIe, you will have to look carefully to 
make sure that the device you want to attach can be accessed by the 
programs you are able to use.  If you have any uncertainty about this, talk 
with a vendor that is used to dealing with Apple II users, and ask specific 
questions about compatibility with YOUR equipment.


SCSI CARDS - APPLE   For SCSI interface cards, you can chose between the
""""""""""""""""""   RamFAST SCSI card and an Apple-built SCSI card.  The 
newest (last) Apple card is the Apple II High Speed SCSI card, which is the 
fastest version available.  The older versions of the Apple SCSI card are 
identified as either Revision A or B; these have to be upgraded to be 
compatible with the Apple IIgs (although the Rev B card will work on the 
IIe).  The Rev C card works on the Apple II, II Plus, IIe, and IIgs.  The 
Apple High Speed SCSI card uses the 65c02 opcodes, and so requires an 
enhanced IIe, IIgs, or an older Apple II that has had its 6502 processor 
replace by either a Zip Chip or a 65c02 chip.  The fastest SCSI interface 
made by Apple is the Apple II SCSI card.

     As mentioned above, the Apple II High Speed card is a faster choice 
for a SCSI interface than the older cards that Apple produced.  With this 
card, the speed of data transfer between the computer and the hard drive is 
significantly improved.  There are some drawbacks, however.  First of all, 
the way in which the HS SCSI card gets faster speeds is to do Direct Memory 
Access (DMA), just as the Turbo IDE card mentioned above.  The IIe does not 
reliably work with DMA enabled on this card (it may actually cause a 
crash), and so some of the speed improvement may not be noticed on the IIe.  
On the IIgs, DMA works just fine.  However, the speed is not nearly as good 
when running ProDOS 8 applications (such as AppleWorks) as it is with GS/OS 
applications.  If a IIgs user doesn't do much in the 8-bit world, the Apple 
HS SCSI card may be just fine.  If AppleWorks and other 8-bit programs are 
frequently used, the slower speed in those programs may make this a less 
desirable choice.

     Since the Apple II High Speed SCSI card is made and sold by Apple, 
this may be the best way to go if you have any concerns about future 
compatibility and service.  (Admittedly, it may take a little explanation 
to an Apple Dealer that this item for repair goes into an Apple II and NOT 
a Mac, but if all else fails, 1-800-SOS-APPL should be able to get you the 
needed help).

     Those seeking out the Apple HS SCSI card should also be aware of a 
couple of other points.  First, Apple made a change to the ROM (firmware) 
code on the card after it was released, but did NOT make any changes in how 
those cards were labelled.  Because of this, it is not easy to always tell 
whether a particular card is the older or newer version.  One advantage of 
the newer version is that the card will continue to check the hard drive 
attached to it until it has come up to speed, and THEN try to boot that 
drive.  The older card, and many other hard disk controller cards, will 
check the hard drive to see if it is ready; if it does not receive a 
positive response from the drive, it will return a "DEVICE NOT READY" error 
and stop.  This simply means that the hard drive must be turned on first, 
allowed to come to speed, and then the computer is turned on.

     The other possible problem with the differences between the two 
versions of the Apple HS SCSI card have to do with "term power".  For a 
SCSI chain of devices to work properly, the electronics of the link between 
each device in the chain (including the card) require that the chain be 
powered by at least ONE of the devices (in some circumstances, it may be 
good if term power is supplied by more than one device).  The older HS SCSI 
card did NOT supply terminator power; the newer one does.  This may cause a 
conflict if the hard drive attached to the card does not supply term power. 
If the card DOES, everything is all right; if the card does NOT, then 
NOTHING in the chain is supplying term power, and it won't work.  There are 
some hardware patches that have been posted to alter the cards that do NOT 
supply term power so that they DO.  This does, however, require some 
knowledge of electronics and the ability to use a soldering gun, so don't 
try this trick unless you REALLY think you know what you are doing.

     Buying an Apple HS SCSI card NEW from a mail order company does not 
necessary guarantee that you will have the newer version of the card.  If 
they (or Apple) have had a card sitting in the warehouse for a long time, 
it may be the older card.  Sometimes it is not possible to tell which 
version it is until you plug it in and try it out.


SCSI CARDS - RAMFAST   The RamFAST SCSI card, formerly sold by CV
""""""""""""""""""""   Technologies and now by Sequential Systems, is more 
expensive than the Apple card.  The Apple card may be found in some places 
for $99, and the RamFAST has sold for as little as $139.  However, there 
are several major advantages of the RamFAST:

     1) It works as quickly under ProDOS 8 as it does under GS/OS.  That 
means that you do NOT take a speed hit if you prefer to work in the 8-bit 
world (as is the case with the Apple HS SCSI card).

     2) The card has BUILT-IN utilities to partition and format a SCSI 
hard drive.  That means that you CANNOT lose a configuration disk somewhere 
in the pile on your desk; the configuration programs are ON the card and 
available at any time by pressing the "0" key when you do a RESET.

     3) Some of the RamFAST utilities include tape backup software, which 
will even work in the background.  This means that you can start a tape 
backup, and then exit the utility program and do some work on a disk 
partition other than the one which is being backed up.  (Actually, you CAN 
work on the one being backed up, but it is locked and you will not be able 
to save any files to it.)

     4) Like the Turbo IDE card, the RamFAST has the ability to shuffle 
the partitions on a hard disk so a different one can be used as the boot 
partition if you wish.  For example, if you have GS/OS version 6.0.1 on one 
partition, and version 5.0.4 on another partition, you can select which one 
you want to boot by pressing the appropriate number key upon RESET.  This 
is not possible with the Apple card.

     5) You can specify exactly WHERE a partition will appear in the 
ProDOS 8 disk mapping table (which Slot and Drive number) within the 
RamFAST configuration program.  This was not possible with the Apple card 
until ProDOS 8 itself was changed to work with more than four devices on 
certain slots after version 1.9.

     6) Finally, the RamFAST is STILL being actively supported and 
upgraded by Sequential Systems.  It is highly unlikely that any further 
changes to the Apple II High Speed SCSI card will ever appear from Apple.  
At the time of this writing, Sequential has even made it possible to play 
musical CD disks in a CD-ROM drive attached to the RamFAST.  Upgrades are 
available at a very reasonable price.


SCSI CONNECTIONS   "Term power" was mentioned earlier in this article.
""""""""""""""""   Part of what "term power" is powering are the 
"termination" resistors that must be present at both ends of a SCSI chain 
of devices. The resistors decrease the extra signals that can be induced 
and reflected on the chain due to the high frequencies used in data 
transfer.  To work properly, these resistors need to be powered.  This 
power can come from only ONE device on the chain, although the newer SCSI-2 
protocol suggests that each device power its own terminator resistors (if 
being used).  If the terminator absent at the end of a chain of devices, 
none of the drives attached may appear to be present; or, if termination 
resistors are active in the middle of the chain, nothing may appear PAST 
that point.  This is not a hard and fast rule, however; sometimes things 
will work properly even though the termination has NOT been done properly.  
If it works under those circumstances, consider yourself lucky; but set it 
up properly as soon as possible to avoid an unexpected loss of data.

     In the cases of the various versions of RamFAST cards that have 
appeared (up through Rev D) and on CMS SCSI cards, the SCSI card itself has 
termination resistors on ITS end of the chain.  That means that only the 
LAST device attached to the SCSI chain needs to have termination resistors 
installed.  Other devices between the card and the end of the chain should 
have their termination resistors disconnected or turned off, as this MAY 
cause problems with proper function.  In the case of Apple's Rev C SCSI 
card, termination is NOT supplied on the card, and so the FIRST device 
attached to the card must have termination resistors installed, in addition 
to those on the LAST device attached.  Also, the cable running between the 
Apple card and the first device on the chain should be very short.

Apple II Hybrids

                    >>> THE MACINTOSH LC/IIe HYBRID <<<
                    """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     
     John Dvorak, an editorial writer for MacUser, recently wrote, 
"Suppose the Mac had been based upon the Apple II, for example.  Can you 
imagine how horrible and limited it would be?"(1)  This kind of statement 
is not surprising, especially coming from Dvorak.  Dvorak displays a 
remarkable ignorance of just how far both Apple II hardware and software 
have come in their development.  Instead of checking out his facts, he uses 
the Mac crowd's narrow beliefs and tired cliches about the II's limitations 
to try to make a point about the growth of computer technology.  In his 
editorial, Dvorak's real target is Windows running on Power Macintosh 
systems, but as he shoots at Windows he hits the Apple II and perpetuates 
Apple's own myth about its limitations.

     In fact, I can easily imagine a Mac based upon an Apple II because I 
already own such a machine.  It's called a "IIgs," and the one that I own 
has several desktop capabilities under System 6.0.1 that I cannot find on 
the System 7-equipped Mac that I use at work.

     Even as a used machine, the 16-bit Apple IIgs, with its accelerated 
Apple IIe mode, 24 bit data bus, and 8 MB addressing still offers a 
reasonable upgrade path for any 8-bit Apple II user.  Through Apple's 
development of GS/OS, the IIgs has acquired what is essentially a Macintosh 
user interface, a Mac-style operating system and, finally, both Macintosh 
and MS-DOS file system translators.  Today's IIgs with System 6 will drive 
any of the latest peripheral devices including fax-modems, CD ROM drives 
and high resolution printers.  I can easily imagine a server-class Apple II 
(built around Western Designs' 65832 microprocessor) possessing an SVGA 
display, 32 bit bus and unlimited addressing.  In truth, whatever Apple II 
limitations exist, exist because of APPLE MARKETING DECISIONS, not because 
of any inherent limitations in the technology itself.

     When Apple introduced its Apple Macintosh line in 1984, it also 
introduced a dilemma for Apple II users.  Simply put, the Macintosh was not 
designed to run Apple II software.  Unlike the users of IBM PCs and 
compatibles, who could take their old software with them when they 
"upgraded" to a new x86-based platform, Apple II users had nowhere to go.  
Many sales of the Trackstar and PC Transporter cards (discussed earlier in 
this series) were almost certainly generated because of this dilemma.  With 
no clear upgrade path, some Apple II users began migrating to PCs rather 
than Macs, and they maintained their cross-platform compatibility with the 
Apple II through the use of the PCT and Trackstar coprocessor boards.

     Apple has done a number of things to insure cross-platform 
compatibilities between the Apple II and the Mac. The company would love to 
convince their Apple II customers that all Apple products are essentially 
the same thing so that they can feel good about "upgrading" to a Macintosh.  
Nonetheless, even though both the II and Mac carry the same logo, they are 
different computers.  As it gradually became obvious that Apple had no 
intention of developing the Apple II architecture any further (nor allow 
anyone else to develop the architecture), an Apple II/Mac "bridge machine" 
became the hope of many Apple II users.

     Apple II users, however, had to wait six years after the Mac's 
introduction before a bridge machine would finally appear as the Macintosh 
LC/IIe hybrid.  Yet, for many Apple II users it was too little, too late.  
For example, IIe users had already forged their own upgrade paths by 
outfitting their computers with accelerator chips, additional RAM and other 
improved capabilities.  A good bridge machine, they reasoned, should offer 
them at least as much capability in IIe mode as they already possessed with 
their enhanced Apple IIs.  After all, when PC users upgraded to a higher 
x86 system, they were automatically guaranteed a faster microprocessor and 
better addressing to use with their existing software.  Apple II users, on 
the other hand, were getting LESS than an off-the-shelf IIe with the IIe 
PDS (Processor Direct Slot) card.

     As far as IIgs users were concerned, no bridge machine even existed, 
because the LC's IIe PDS card couldn't run IIgs software, and many IIgs 
users ran GS applications and games exclusively.  It was especially the 
superb sound and color graphics of IIgs games that GS users would miss if 
they bought an LC.  In addition, the multiple expansion slots found in IIes 
and IIGSes had always been prized by Apple II lovers, and both Apple IIgs 
and Apple IIe users were disappointed by the fact that the LC had only one 
slot, which had to be used by the IIe card.  The LC's lack of slots, 
together with the IIe card's 1 mhz processing speed were seen as 
significant limitations.

     Comparisons between the IIe card-equipped LC and the Apple IIgs were 
inevitable after the LC was first introduced in late 1990.  Most of these 
comparisons found the two computers to be nearly equal in their 
capabilities.  Price comparisons, using mostly Apple peripheral equipment 
and official retail pricing, found the LC to be cheaper in price than the 
IIgs.(2)  Most IIgs users knew, however, that the street price of a 
comparably-equipped IIgs remained less than an LC with IIe card, at least 
at the time it was introduced.  However, Apple continued to hold the prices 
of both its IIgs and IIe at the same level while gradually bringing down 
the price of its increasingly more powerful LCs.  It was this marketing 
strategy which rankled with Apple II supporters and eventually enabled 
Apple to discontinue both the IIgs and IIe by citing decreased demand for 
these systems.

     Despite the LC's perceived shortcomings at its introduction, Apple's 
LC line and its IIe PDS card have gone on to enjoy remarkable sales.  The 
LC, including its various Quadra and Performa incarnations, has been 
Apple's best selling computer, helped especially by competitive pricing and 
replacement sales to schools.  The LC's IIe PDS card remains the only Apple 
II still in production.  At one time, Apple was reported to be sending out 
75 percent of its LCs equipped with the IIe card.(3)

     Sales of the IIe card, especially to schools, remain strong in many 
places up into the present time.  Additionally, anyone who has taken the 
time to read GEnie's Macintosh LC categories will find that the topic of 
IIe card compatibility remains very important to Mac users who are 
contemplating upgrading to the latest, 68040-based, LC-style machines.  
Many of the sales of AppleWorks 4 have almost certainly gone to users of 
LCs with IIe PDS cards.

     It has been rumored on GEnie's A2 roundtable that some Apple 
officials, surprised by the strength of their LC-line and IIe PDS card, 
have lamented privately that they did not continue development of the Apple 
II line further.  Hindsight, as they say, is always 20/20, but it seems 
very doubtful that Apple will now reverse their policy toward the 
development of Apple II hardware. 

     Although it leaves much to be desired in Apple II mode, the LC/IIe 
hybrid has a number of features worth exploring.  As indicated in last 
month's article, the LC itself now comes in several versions which include 
the Quadra 605, Performa 475, LC 475, Performa 460 and LC-III.  All of 
these machines possess essentially the same motherboard with IIe PDS 
capability.  The LC-III and the Performa 460 series computers are fast 
68030-based Macs, while the Performa 475, LC 475 and Quadra 605 are VERY 
fast 68LC040-based Macs.  As reported last month, these 68040-based 
LC-style Macs run at 22 MIPS, about three times as fast as the 68030-based 
LCs.  Unfortunately, while all of these machines run Apple II software with 
the Apple IIe PDS card, they continue to run the software at 1 mhz, and 
they benefit only from slight improvement in the video display speed.  

     It is expected that, as sales of the Power Macintosh line increase, 
prices on these very fast, LC-style machines will continue to come down as 
they become Apple's low-end computers.  It has been announced that a future 
Power Macintosh upgrade will become available for the Quadra 605s and 
LC/Performa 475s.  At present, Apple is providing Power Macintosh upgrades 
for other Macintoshes but not for these LC-style machines.  Power Macintosh 
upgrades for LCs are a virtual certainty, however, given the sheer number 
of LC-style machines in existence and the potential dollars that can be 
made by anyone who provides the "Power" hardware at a reasonable cost.  The 
current official price of Apple's Power PDS card is $699.

     PowerMac upgrades will be provided in the form of complete 
motherboard swapouts from Apple or as PDS coprocessor cards from both Apple 
and DayStar corporation.  The capabilities of this new hardware will vary 
somewhat with the type of board and the type of Mac it is installed in, but 
all upgrades guarantee remarkable speed improvements in Mac emulation as 
well as the capability to run multiple operating systems in other 
emulations.  Apple II users must wait to see if the Apple II can play a 
software emulation role in the new technology.  While Apple II emulation 
software is reportedly being investigated for the PowerMac and PowerPC 
systems, it has not been promised by anyone.  Nonetheless, Apple II users 
have gotten used to waiting on new technology, and somehow it has always 
become available.

     Despite the limitations of the LC/IIe hybrid and the perception by 
people like John Dvorak that the Apple II is "limited," a IIe 
card-equipped, LC-style Mac may well represent one of the best new computer 
choices for an Apple II user who plans to maintain their IIe capability 
while expanding their software base on a new platform.  It is the 
tremendous power of the LC 475s, their IIe compatibility, their low cost, 
and the promise that these Macs will soon become PowerMac compatible that 
make them such a good buy.  Therefore, next month we will examine how well 
the LC/IIe hybrid works as an Apple II.  Until then, think hybrid!

     >>> BLUEDISK CONTROLLER (Lange) AND MS-DOS UTILITIES (Watson) <<<
     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     New developments of hard- and software for the Apple IIgs do not take 
place in the United States alone.  One firm developing new products is 
found in Germany.

     Joachim Lange (///SHH Systeme, Bergstr. 95, D - 82131 Stockdorf, 
Phone: ++49 89/8 57 70 40, GEnie: J.LANGE7) scored a big hit when releasing 
the BlueDisk controller for the Apple IIgs (and the enhanced Apple //e). 
This controller will accept two MS-DOS drives of any size.  (These are 
drives which use the MFM format for data recording, whereas the "normal" 
Apple drives use the GCR format for data recording -- the Apple SuperDrive 
is capable of both MFM and GCR formats.)  The formats currently supported 
are 5.25" disks with 360K, 720K, and 1.2MB, as well as 3.5" disks with 
720K, 800K, 1.44MB, 1.6MB, and 2.88MB. Disks can be formatted from Finder 
with the capacities mentioned for ProDOS and HFS.  (Yes, you can format 
800K and 1.6MB MFM disks for ProDOS and HFS!)  A BlueDisk controller with a 
double-drive is far cheaper than an Apple Superdrive with controller, and 
it's even cheaper than a SCSI Floptical drive.

     As I write this, the BlueDisk controller is still available as 
introductory offer for DM200 plus shipping and handling. The introductory 
offer is valid as long as the GS/OS driver and the firmware are in 
"official beta stadium".  Extensive tests by beta testers in the US and my 
own findings have shown, however, that everything works and is stable.  I 
don't know whether the introductory offer will still be valid by the time 
GEnieLamp A2 reaches you.

     With System 6.0.1 and a BlueDisk controller, you're able to read 
disks in ProDOS, HFS, and MS-DOS format in the above mentioned sizes 
directly from Finder.  You can write disks in the above mentioned sizes in 
HFS, ProDOS, and MS-DOS.

     Just a moment -- write MS-DOS?  Yes, you can write MS-DOS disks with 
a BlueDisk controller, although not from Finder.  You have to use the 
MS-DOS Utilities by Peter Watson; but more on that later on. 

     The BlueDisk controller comes with a GS/OS driver and a testing 
program. The driver provides a bit more functionality than the built-in 
firmware. The test program lets you test the drives connected to the 
BlueDisk controller. 

     The driver operates in two modes; one mode polls the drives 
continuously, which generates some noise (owners of a PC Transporter will 
know what I'm talking about; this was the reason to develop some patches, 
which "hide" the TransDrives from GS/OS); the other mode does not poll the 
drives continuously, which will keep GS/OS from recognizing disk changes 
automatically.  In this second mode you have to press the Control key to 
tell the BlueDisk controller to check the drives.  You may toggle the modes 
with the key combination Shift-Control. 

     When the driver is deactivated, you'll see a 5.25" disk icon on the 
desktop for every drive connected to the BlueDisk controller (just like for 
the normal Apple 5.25" drives).  After inserting a disk, you have to 
double-click on the drive icon, to show the disk icon for opening it (just 
like you have to do with Apple 5.25" drives).  Without the active BlueDisk 
driver not all of the above mentioned disk sizes are available, because 
they are not (yet) implemented in the firmware. 

     The circuit board itself is very well done.  You use a DIP switch to 
configure the slot you want to install the BlueDisk controller in.  A set 
of three jumpers is used to tell the BlueDisk controller how many (one or 
two) and what kind of drives (5.25" or 3.5") you have connected to it.  Two 
soldered jumper wires configure two signals for 2.88MB drives.

     After installing the controller and connecting the drives (when you 
buy everything from ///SHH Systeme, a cable for that is provided), I 
started the first tests.  I took a pack of preformatted MS-DOS disks I 
happened to have available -- the disks were recognized by Finder just fine 
as MS-DOS disks.  I reformatted one into a HFS disk and copied a file onto 
it -- and was disappointed -- it took forever and forever and forever... 
but more on this in a moment.  It was definitely NOT the fault of the 
BlueDisk controller and driver. 

     I performed the following tests (all tests were conducted with a 
stock IIgs running at 2.8 MHz):

     Writing and reading of a 490K file to the different disk sizes and 
formats with and without the BlueDisk driver.

     HFS 720K       41 sec.             (5.25")   
     HFS 800K       44 sec.
     HFS 1.4MB      24 sec.   
     HFS 1.2MB      25 sec.
     HFS 1.6MB      22 sec.

     (in Finder with the MS-DOS FST)
     MS-DOS 1.4MB   26 sec.
     MS-DOS 1.2MB   26 sec.
     MS-DOS 720K    53 sec.             (3.5")
     MS-DOS 720K    45 sec.             (5.25")

     from an Apple 3.5" drive

     ProDOS 800K    17 sec.
     HFS 800K       17 sec.

     While doing those tests I made an interesting discovery; it took 245 
seconds to write a file onto a HFS disk in one instance (see above "it 
lasted forever...").  MS-DOS disks are usually preformatted at 1:1 
interleave; when the writing took so long, I had just reformatted the disks 
for HFS, leaving the interleave intact.  When I initialized the disks from 
Finder, using the 2:1 interleave, things became a lot faster.  All the 
above tests were done on 2:1 interleave disks (even the MS-DOS timings, but 
the MS-DOS utilities write to the disks direct, not using the BlueDisk 
driver efficiently).  The differences you encounter when using the 
different interleave factors are dramatic:

          1:1 interleave 228 sec.
          2:1 interleave 45 sec. (!)

     The 5.25" 360K, 720K, and 1.2MB disks are formatted with 52:1 
interleave according to Finder!?

     I recommend you format disks always from Finder with 2:1 interleave 
for use with ProDOS or HFS.  MS-DOS disks can be formatted with different 
interleaves from within the Watson MS-DOS utilities.  They are recognized 
by the MS-DOS FST just fine. 

     (BTW, tests of the beta-testers and Joachim Lange found that the HFS 
FST is programmed for slowness deliberately!  It uses SINGLE block read and 
write calls and writes blocks in the wrong order.  That is, blocks 200-300 
are written in the order 300, 299, 298, 297, I, and it uses a single GS/OS 
call for each block.  I think you can imagine that to be slow, can't you?)

     GS/OS recognizes the drives connected to a BlueDisk controller as 
Superdrives, by the way.

     The MS-DOS FST recognizes a MS-DOS disk as such with the following 
steps:

     1. Read block 0 (the boot block)
     2. Byte $0000  has to be $E9 or $EB
         (8088 code long resp. short jump)
     3. Byte $1FE has to be $55
          (ID byte)
     4. Byte $1FF has to be $AA
         (ID byte)
     5. Bytes $00B - $00D have to be $200
         (512 bytes per block/sector) 

     Well, there's but one glitch in this whole picture -- when Kangaroo 
is used to change folders or disks, the drives connected to the BlueDisk 
controller are accessed about 20 times (when there are no disks in the 
drives), til Kangaroo displays its menu.  Even when loading just a file 
from HD, the drives are accessed once prior to loading the file.  When 
there are no entries in Kangaroo's file and folder submenus, this behavior 
doesn't occur.  When there are disks in the BlueDisk drives, Kangaroo looks 
only about three times, before displaying its menu.  When Kangaroo isn't 
activated, GS/OS just looks once at the drives and that's it.

     The testing program for the drives has the following menu:

     IRQ: 0           Rst:0            Dr2: yes      n/a: 1
     Typ2: 5.25"   Typ1: 3.5"     ME2: on/off   ME1: on/off

          1: Drive 1 Motor: OFF/ON
          2: Drive 2 Motor: OFF/ON
          O: Select Drive 1
          T: Select Drive 2
          D: Disable Drive Selection
          0: Recalibrate Selected Drive
          9: Seek Track #79 of Selected Drive
          +: Step to Next Cylinder (inwards)
          -: Step back (move outwards)
          R: Try to Read From Disk
          Q: Quit

     To test a drive, you select a drive and switch its motor on. Then you 
can issue the commands (0,9,+,-) to the drive.  The program will 
respondwith a message.  When this is a positive message, the drive is 
functioning properly. 

     BlueDisk:

     o  has been tested with Archiver's backup function; there have been 
        no problems with either of BlueDisk's formats and sizes.

     o  works just fine with HardPressed

     o  works in Slot 5, when its set to "Your Card"

     o  works with PC Transporter (there are the same problems you 
        encounter when using a Floptical with the PC Transporter) 

     Things which don't work (but neither the fault of the BlueDisk 
controller nor the driver):

     o  ProSel 16 does no backups to drives, which aren't connected to 
        Slot 5

     o  Salvation Bakkup does not recognize non-Apple drives

     o  ProSel 8 Cat Doctor does not format correctly


                                 [*][*][*]

     A software package that BlueDisk users will find useful comes from 
Peter Watson of Australia.  Watson's MS-DOS Utilities contain the following 
commands:

     MDir      reads the directory of a MS-DOS (MFM) disk
     MType     types the contents of a file to screen
     MCopy     copies files from MS-DOS to GS/OS
     GMCopy    copies files from GS/OS to MS-DOS
     MRename   changes MS-DOS file names
     MDel      deletes files from MS-DOS disks
     MLabel    creates a disk name for MS-DOS disks
     MAttrib   changes file attributes for MS-DOS files
     MFormat   formats disk for MS-DOS
     MDiskCopy copies whole disks
     findMFM   tries to recognize all connected MFM capable drives
     Online    shows all volumes online with their drive numbers
     MMD       creates a directory/folder
     MRD       deletes a directory/folder
     MFDisk    shows partition info (on a HD)
     MPatch    patches the parameters of some commands

     The commands need a shell to be usable.  A shell called COMMAND.COM 
comes with the program, but you may use the ORCA/Shell, ProSel-16, or 
GNO/ME.  The aforementioned MS-DOS commands are small programs, which are 
loaded from disk when requested.  In addition to them there are a few 
built-in commands contained in COMMAND.COM:

     Prefix    selects the standard prefix
     Cat       shows a directory/folder
     Type      shows the contents of a file on screen
     Ver       shows the version number
     Help      displays the help texts
     Quit      quits COMMAND.COM

     As you may see, the necessary functions for writing to and modifying 
MS-DOS disks are there.  After starting COMMAND.COM, the ">" prompt 
welcomes you and the program is waiting for you to enter something; it's 
solely text based.  A valid entry might be "MFormat .d7 /Q"; this erases 
the disk in device 7, creates a MS-DOS root directory, and creates the FAT 
(File Allocation Table -- what the VTOC [Volume Tables of Contents] is for 
ProDOS, the FAT is for MS-DOS.)  To copy a file from a ProDOS disk onto an 
MS-DOS disk, you have to issue the command "GMCopy .d7 :Hard2:Read.Me 
ReadMe.TXT"; this instructs Command.Com to copy the file Read.Me from 
/Hard2 onto the MS-DOS disk in device 7 and change the name of the file to 
ReadMe.TXT.

     Well, there isn't much more to say about the MS-DOS Utilities.  They 
function as advertised and do their job; however, you're dealing with 
MS-DOS, so you might have to try a few times sometimes to get the syntax of 
a command right.  Entering a command which needs parameters to operate 
without those parameters will cause COMMAND.COM to display that command 
with some samples on how to use the parameters.  With "Help name" you'll 
get an explanation of the command "name".

     Peter Watson asks US$15 or AUS$20 for his Utilities.  This is money 
well spent; you'll get a big bang for the buck.  For $5 more you'll receive 
the latest version of the Utilities.  

     All in all, still more possibilities and functionality for our "good 
ole" Apple IIgs!

I have been a "weekend" freelance photographer doing weddings and other 
events since 1985 and have always wanted to do movies.

     Well, I purchased a camcorder not long ago and started doing home 
video movies.  You know the type:  Birthdays, parties, picnics, and other 
events as requested.  I even started taping the weekly church service.

     The problem I encountered was to give proper credit to those that 
were participating.  That is where VCR Companion entered the picture.  I 
saw this program on the shelf and just had to try it out.

     VCR Companion comes with the following standard features:

     o  12 Fonts (scripts);
     o  12 Boarders;
     o  12 Background Pictures;
     o  12 Background Patterns;
     o  12 Animations; and
     o  12 Background Icons.

     Also, you can install VCR Companion to your hard drive for easier and 
faster use!  However, I was not successful in installing it to my 20 meg 
drive as it is partitioned only for ProDOS applications. 

     As a bonus VCR Companion included:

     o  12 Additional Animations;
     o  12 Icons; and
     o  3 "ready made" scripts for you to examine.

     I found the easiest way to use this program is to just start!  I had 
taped an office party and needed to put titles on the tape.  I did the 
titles in about 30 minutes and placed them on the tape without problems.  I 
took the finished tape to the boss and asked him to play it back... 
success!  All the people in the party were just raving about it... 
especially the titles!

     A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to shoot my first video 
wedding.  I warned the bride and groom ahead of time but they still wanted 
the movie of their special day.  I prepared myself with four blank tapes:  
One for the wedding, one for the reception and the one for candid shots of 
that day and the last tape for the final product.

     I took about one hour to prepare the titles and music.  I then placed 
the titles on the new tape followed by the wedding, reception, and candid 
shots!  Each section had the titles announcing the section.

     I delivered the tape to the newly weds and watch them watch their 
wedding.  They saw the titles start with a "cover" and an animation of the 
bride & groom kissing!  That scene faded to listing the grandparents, 
parents, aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters.  Well, you should be getting 
the picture by now... the movie was a success:  They were happy and so was 
I!

     Follow the easy to read instructions to put your finished titles on 
tape.  VCR Companion even gives you a diagram to follow so you can connect 
your computer to the VCR.  

     VCR Companion allows you to import your own animations created by 
Dazzle Draw, Fantavision, or Animate.  You must observe the size 
constraints placed from VCR Companion when converting from these programs 
to the VCR Companion.

     Some other uses of VCR Companion could be slide titles, "welcome to 
the business" tour, computer advertising, and many other ideas!

     I created a self run advertisement for my business that presents 
information, advertisement, and other items as a slide show.  The uses of 
VCR Companion are really endless:  Just let your imagination go and you 
will really enjoy VCR Companion.

     So even if you don't own a camcorder or a VCR you will find that the 
VCR Companion is a welcomed addition to your library... I certainly did!

               THE TREASURE HUNT /
/////////////////////////////////
Yours For the Downloading
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Charlie Hartley
      [C.HARTLEY3]



     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month we will take a look at 
a variety of files including some GS/OS stuff and some interesting text 
files.  We will conclude with one of my personal favorites.

     First we will focus on HyperCard IIgs and related files available in 
the A2 Library.  This terrific program has been available online since 
early February for the price of $3 an hour downloading.  No doubt many of 
you have already taken advantage of this addition to the library.  For the 
rest of you, here a brief description of what you need to do to get started 
with HyperCard IIgs.

     Here is a list of the HyperCard IIgs Program Files:

     File#   Title            Brief Description

     22194   INST.TOUR.BXY    HCGS Installer/Tour disk
     22195   HCGS.BXY         HCGS Program Disk
     22196   STACKS1.BXY      HyperCard IIgs stacks disk #1
     22197   STACKS2.BXY      HyperCard IIgs stacks disk #2
     22198   HCGS.HELP.BXY    HyperCard IIgs help disk
     22199   HTALKHELP.BXY    HCGS HyperTalk help disk

     Each of the files is a 3.5" disk image.  All of the six files are 
required to install HyperCard IIgs from floppy disks.  HyperCard IIgs 
_requires_ 1.5 megabytes of RAM and a single disk volume greater than 3 
megabytes.  System 5.0.4 or later is also required.

     Unpacking a disk image can be a bit of a hassle if you are not 
careful. I suggest that you download the files to a folder on your hard 
drive and then unpack them to a blank diskette using ShrinkIt GS.  Also, be 
prepared for a long download. I suggest doing it between midnight and 6 AM, 
when the online traffic is lightest.

     Once you have downloading the six files and unpacked them to 
diskettes, select the Installer program from the Tour disk and follow the 
directions to install HyperCard on your hard drive.

     Now let's take a look at several neat HyperCard stacks available in 
the A2 Library.

                                 [*][*][*]

           QUICK.TUTOR.BXY     File #15466     (HyperCard Stack)
           '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     According to A2.TYLER, who uploaded this HyperCard stack, "this is a 
stack created by Sebastian Foti, an instructional computing instructor at 
the University of Florida's College of Education.  The stack gives an 
overview of how to use the different tools within HyperCard to write one's 
own stacks.  There are some interesting ideas included for the use of 
buttons that will cause the tongues of the creators of HyperCard GS to drag 
on the floor and their eyes to bulge out of their heads."

     Foti, who calls his stack "Quick 'n Easy HyperCard Tutorial," 
describes it this way:  "This stack was created as an introduction to the 
basic elements of HyperCard GS.  It is designed to offer the user a chance 
to play with HyperCard without worrying about making a mess of the stack. 
The changes made to the stack will not be permanent."

     He begins with a brief definition of what HyperCard is.  Then he 
explains in some detail what the various elements (buttons, fields, 
pictures) of a card are with ample examples of each.  Foti gives you the 
opportunity to play with these things to your heart's content _without 
destroying the stack_.

     This is a fairly long download (182272 bytes), but in the opinion of 
this novice HyperCard user, well worth it.  Now if someone will just tell 
me how Foti did the "slippery button"....


                                 [*][*][*]

           HCFONTVIEW.BXY     File #16991     (HyperCard Stack)
           ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     According to Alvin Yee, the author of this stack, "Font Viewer is a 
stack that will let you select all Font Attributes such as Font Family, 
Size, Style & Color and alter them via HyperCard Buttons.  It will then 
show you an example (more than 1 line and in color) of your choices.  Also 
present are options for field styling and changing the background color. As 
a bonus, a HyperCard Screen Saver is included.  The Screen Saver paints 
random triangle outlines in random colors on a black background."

     This freeware stack displays all its directions on screen as the text 
that serves as an example of the font choices that you make.  At first 
glance, the scope and variety of buttons on the screen may be a bit 
overwhelming to the novice user.  If you read the onscreen directions 
carefully, it soon becomes clear what you can do with this stack.

     You may also get a print-out of the directions by first clicking on 
the sample field (where the text is).  This brings up a dialog box that 
gives you the option of printing the sample text using the current font 
attributes.

     Font attributes include style (plain, bold, italic, underline, 
shadow), size, height (use this to alter the default height set by size), 
alignment (left or right justified, or centered) and color.

     Once you have the font just the way you want it, you may install the 
font attributes onto a field in another stack.  You may also save up to 
three different settings for the font.

     Aside from its uses with HyperCard, this stack will also let you see 
what each of the fonts in your font folder look like.  As a bonus, you can 
select a full character set table using the font, style and size of the 
font that you have in the sample window.  Then you can print it out.

     This file contains 68480 bytes, which is a relatively short download, 
particularly for the value you get.


                                 [*][*][*]

            VISUAL.FX.BXY     File #14763     (HyperCard Stack)
            '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is a freeware HyperCard stack by Hangtime and Chet Day. 
According to Hangtime, it "demonstrates all the different visual effects 
available through HyperTalk.  It allows the user to try all the effects at 
any speed (very fast, fast, slowly, very slowly), and even add an image to 
go to rather than a card image (all 16 colors, plus inverse) via a PopUp 
menu! It's VERY easy to use, and it's VERY, VERY small (only about 13k!). 
This stack is _not_ locked in any way, so use it, look through it, figure 
out how it works, but most of all have fun!"

     This is another stack that gives you an opportunity to experiment 
with HyperCard without worrying about messing up.  HyperCard has a variety 
of visual effects that can be used to move from one card to another.  These 
include zoom (open, close, in, out), wipe (up, down, left, right), scroll 
(up, down, left, right), iris (open, close), barn door (open, close), 
checkerboard, dissolve, fade, and of course plain.

     If you are a novice, as I am, and particularly if you have little 
experience with visual transitions, this is an excellent stack to learn 
from.  Besides, as Hangtime says, you can take it apart to see what makes 
it tick.  In my experience as a programmer, I have frequently learned much 
from working my way through someone else's code.


                                 [*][*][*]

           NOWORRIES13.BXY     File #22323     (HyperCard Stack)
           '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This final HyperCard stack for this month's column was just recently 
uploaded to the library.  The stack was created by Brendan Bellina.  He 
describes it this way:

     "No Worries v1.3.0 is a HyperCard GS stack that allows the launching 
of GS/OS, ProDOS, Applesoft BASIC programs, as well as opening other 
stacks, New Desk Accessories, and Documents, all within an environment that 
is very similar in appearance to the Macintosh At Ease software.  Includes 
security to protect against unauthorized addition/deletion of applications 
buttons.  Earlier versions published in Script-Central.  This is the first 
freeware release."

     If you need security to prevent others from messing with the computer 
settings (school children messing with the control panels for example), 
this stack provides a straight forward way to do that.  It uses a single 
system password that restricts the user to running the programs that are 
already set up in the stack, unless he has the password.

     At the same time it gives you a point and click format for choosing 
programs to run.  Setting up the stack for these programs is easy.  For 
example, if you want to run HyperStudio from this stack, pull down the "No 
Worries" menu and select "set up mode."  Then pull it down again and select 
"Link to GS/OS Application."  From there you will select the location of 
the HyperStudio file from the standard dialogue menu.  Once you have it 
located, an icon will appear on the screen.  Drag the icon to where you 
want it.  It will now appear complete with the name of the program. 
Clicking on it will take you to HyperStudio.  Quitting HyperStudio will 
return you to this stack.

     It is also possible to link to ProDOS applications (system files), to 
BASIC programs (requires BASIC.SYSTEM), other stacks, documents (linked to 
GS/OS applications), and various menu commands.

     If you need security, and/or if you really like the look and feel of 
"At Ease," then this stack will be a good download for you.  If, like me, 
you don't need security, then you probably don't want it.

     If you decide to download this stack, be sure to become familiar with 
it before you apply the password protection.  Also, be sure to read all the 
good information provided in the help screens.  To get to them, select 
"help" from the "No Worries" menu.

     By the way, Brendan was the professor at a recent A2 University 
course on HyperCard GS over in the A2Pro Roundtable.  To learn more about 
the course, visit their library and search on "HyperCard."

     That concludes the HyperCard stuff.  Now let's look at some 
interesting text files.


                                 [*][*][*]

          NIGHT.XMAS.TX      File # 4496     (Humorous Text File)
          '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     I like this one!  As stated in the file description, "If you fed 'The 
Night Before Xmas' into a computer, and then asked the computer to explain 
the story, it would look something like this."  This is a short download 
(6300 bytes) and well worth it.

     Here is a short excerpt...

     "T'was the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the 
annual yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic 
activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential, 
including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus Musculus."


                                 [*][*][*]

          CORP.DEFS.TXT     File # 4501     (Humorous Text File)
          ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     If you work in corporate America, or even if you don't, I think 
you'll like this file.  This is a humorous text file containing some silly 
definitions for corporate terms and phrases.

     Here are two examples ...

     Clarification:  Filling in the background with so many details that 
                     the foreground goes underground

     Committee:  A group of the uninformed appointed by the unwilling, to 
                 do the unnecessary

     At only 3780 bytes, this download will only cost you pennies, and I 
guarantee that you will get at least that must satisfaction from it.


                                 [*][*][*]

            MATH.DEFS     File # 4502     (Humorous Text File)
            ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Math students, math teachers, and anyone who ever struggled through a 
math class, will enjoy this tiny little text file created by Rainer Kock. 
In it he says, "Any student who ever sat or slept through a mathematics 
course knows that certain words and phrases occur very frequently.  This 
glossary might eliminate some confusion."  You'll smile reading it.

     Sorry, no quotes this time.  At 2520 bytes, you will have it before 
you know it.


                                 [*][*][*]

          DISCLAMER.TXT     File # 4559     (Humorous Text File)
          ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     It seems that everything you buy comes with some kind of disclaimer. 
They all seem to be saying "If it ain't right, it ain't my fault!"  Well, 
whoever put this file together must have tried to incorporate all of them 
into one funny disclaimer that disclaims everything!

     If you haven't seen this one before, it just might be worth the 5040 
byte download.


                                 [*][*][*]

      MUSIC.MIDI.APPLE.BNY     File #4897     (Informative Text File)
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is an article written by Leah R. H. Weisman and Tyler D. Weisman 
(A2.TYLER) describing the development of music hardware and software on the 
Apple II line of computers.

     It includes a description of what MIDI is all about.  While the 
article was written in 1988, it still makes interesting reading today, 
especially for the beginner.

     Besides, who knows, if enough of you download the file, Tyler might 
decide to bring it up to date.  (Hint, hint!)  At 8820 bytes, this is well 
worth the download.


                                 [*][*][*]

          SPELL.MACH.BXY     File #18068     (Applesoft Program)
          ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     The Spelling Machine is an individualized spelling lessons program 
designed specifically for seventh graders.  While it was designed for use 
at school, it is perfectly suitable for parents who want to help their 
children improve their spelling.

     The freeware program begins with a diagnostic test to determine a 
list of words that the child does not already know how to spell.  Once it 
has collected a sufficient number of words, the program presents the child 
with a list of 10 words to learn.  It also prepares a worksheet to be 
printed out that includes definitions and sample sentences using the words.

     Once the child has completed the worksheet and studied the words, he 
goes back to the program to take a test.  The test is presented in a 
multiple choice format with several possible spellings to choose from.  The 
program presents the words in random order and presents each word twice for 
correct spelling.  If the child gets it right both times, it is put in his 
completed list.  Next, a new set of words, including those missed on the 
previous test, is presented complete with a new worksheet.  When new words 
are needed, the child takes another diagnostic test.

     There is a whole year's worth of lesson words available with this 
download.  It is a large download (124416 bytes), but well worth it for 
someone who has a real need for it.

     This program runs on anything from an unenhanced IIe on up.  Oh, by 
the way, the programmer is a pretty neat fellow too. <grin>


                                 [*][*][*]

     Well, that concludes this month's column.  I would appreciate any 
comments that you might have concerning the first two columns, and about 
anything you might like to see in future columns.

     Until then, happy downloading!

                             Charlie

                      >>> ON GETTING MY FIRST GS <<<
                      """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     "Where have you been?" my wife asked.

     "Picking up the GS," I replied.  "You know, the one I traded for... 
with that new client."

     "That's all we need around here -- another computer!" she exclaimed.  
I could tell, though, that she was intrigued.  Hadn't she heard me talk 
about getting one for years?

     "Are you going to give it to me to use for my papers?" she asked, 
knowing the answer.  "I could put it in the bedroom."

     "No, it's going right on my desk, next to the 486."

     "Well, don't make a big mess, Mr. GS-Man!"  But she smiled as she 
said it.

     I had traded for the GS with a new client that was getting rid of it. 
 Consulting time in return for computer.  It was a ROM 3 with a 3.5" and a 
5.25" drives, a straight stock machine with no hard drive and 1.25 meg 
memory that had cost the client thousands of dollars when bought.  I knew 
it was going to need some additions -- a hard drive, more memory, a Zip 
chip, more software -- but that would come later.  For now, it was enough 
to finally have an actual GS in the house.

     Quickly, I cleared out a spot in the computer area.  The GS wound up 
next to the IIe that had served me so well all those years, and right down 
from the 486/33.  "Got to get a SuperDrive or a BlueDisk," I thought to 
myself.  "Or maybe that Coactive thing will come through.  Well, like 
Margaret Hamilton once said, 'All in good time, dearie, all in good time.'  
Let's get this thing fired up."

     Quickly I discovered that there were no system disks anywhere with 
the machine.  Bummer!  Having a good Apple II friend in Dan Crutcher, I 
called him up and explained my plight.

     "So you finally got a real computer, eh?  Well, I hate to see a 
computer go to waste, _especially_ a GS.  I've got an old 30-meg drive you 
can borrow for a while.  Come get it."  I was in business!

     "Welcome to the IIgs!  System 6.0.1."  What a welcome sight!  After 
wanting a GS for years, I finally had one in the house.  And I must say, 
the last two weeks have been interesting, to say the least.

     I'm a computer professional.  I spend my days _working_ with 
computers, of all shapes and sizes, from 8088s to Pentiums, with even a few 
Macs thrown in here and there.  This GS, as it is right now, is in many 
ways outclassed by those other machines.  They are faster, bigger, have 
much better displays, and more useful software in many areas.

     But even acknowledging all that, there's one thing the GS has all 
over those other machines:  It's more FUN!  That's right, I get a _kick_ 
out of using this machine!  I love dragging files to the Bill the Cat 
trashcan and having him go "Ack! Phhllt!"  I enjoy the "whoosh" when I open 
windows, and the "hsoohw" when I close them.  I appreciate the filing 
system, and the simplicity of use, and the little nice features here and 
there.

     I hope to get a memory card soon, and a Zip chip also.  Dan's going 
to need this drive back also, so I've got to dig up a hard drive as well.  
But for now, I'm grabbing a few files from GEnie every so often, and 
writing some things, and just generally enjoying my new machine.

     It's good to have a GS in the house.  May it live long, and prosper.

INTRODUCTION   We conclude this month our look at the magazines that have
""""""""""""   helped us in the past, and in some cases continue to help us 
today to use our Apple II computers.  This will include GS+, Softdisk, 
Softdisk G-S, II Alive, Shareware Solutions II, and some foreign Apple II 
magazines.


GS+ (1989-Present)   In the late 1970s, Steven Disbrow entered the world
""""""""""""""""""   of microcomputers with his purchase of a TRS-80 Model 
I, complete with cassette storage and 4K of memory.  To learn more about 
his computer and what it could do, he picked up a newsstand magazine called 
"80-Micro" (published by Wayne Green, who had also started Byte and inCider 
magazines).  He enjoyed the humor that the editors of that publication 
included, and the fun they showed one could have with a computer.  Active 
also in the local TRS user's group, he originally disdained Apple IIs and 
those who used them.  However, in 1984 he found that he needed the ability 
to communicate with a mainframe computer in order to do some schoolwork.  
After looking into the cost of upgrading his TRS-80 to be able to do this, 
he found that it would actually cost him LESS to buy the newly released 
Apple IIc with a 300 baud modem (and at that time, a new IIc went for about 
$1300), so he crossed enemy lines and entered the Apple camp.

     As he got more familiar with his IIc, his interest in that computer 
and the upcoming 16-bit IIgs also increased.  While learning more about it 
from Apple magazines at the newsstand, he noticed that many of the 
publications that dealt with the Atari ST included a disk with each issue. 
Disbrow went so far as to contact several of the Apple II magazines that 
were in print at the time to see if THEY had any interest in a companion 
disk, but he did not find any interest.  After purchasing his Apple IIgs, 
he saw that there still was no combination magazine and disk for this 
computer, and decided to start one himself.

     When Disbrow started his magazine in September 1989, he chose to make 
it exclusively for the Apple IIgs, and so named it "GS+".  Published 
bi-monthly, the byline on the cover of each issue reminded subscribers of 
what made HIS magazine unique:  "The First Apple IIgs Magazine + Disk 
Publication!"  He recalled the humor and fun that he had always seen in 
80-Micro, and determined to make his magazine fun in a similar way.  
Disbrow felt that this was especially important, considering the generally 
negative attitude that was prevalent among Apple II users at the time, as 
they saw less and less active support from Apple for their computer.  Still 
in print at the time of this writing, GS+ concentrates on news, software 
and hardware reviews, published programs and utilities for the IIgs (some 
with source code), and interviews with people who are involved with the 
IIgs.<1>


SoftDisk (Sep 1981-Present) / Softdisk G-S (Nov 1988-Present)   One of the
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   survivors 
in the Apple II magazine world is also unusual in terms of the type of 
publication that it is.  Rather than using the traditional paper and ink 
medium, Softdisk came on the scene as one of the first magazines 
distributed in only a machine-readable form.  Back in 1981, Jim Mangham, a 
programmer at LSU Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, felt that the 
time was ripe for an Apple II disk-based magazine.  It would have the 
advantage of providing ready-to-run programs that did not have to be typed 
in, yet could still be listed and modified by the "reader" if desired. 
Mangham's idea was not unique in the computer world as a whole; "CLOAD" for 
the TRS-80 began as a magazine on cassette as far back as 1978, and other 
paper publications offered companion disks as an extra, containing programs 
from a specific issue.  But no one had yet put a whole magazine on disk for 
the Apple II, and Mangham decided to fill that gap.

     Originally, he planned to call it "The Harbinger Magazette", and 
after getting a preliminary first issue prepared, he called Al Tommervik of 
Softalk magazine to discuss advertising.  Tommervik thought it was a great 
idea, and not only did he want to advertise it, but asked to be a partner 
in the venture.  He suggested that they change the name to "Softdisk" 
(since it would be, in essence, a Softalk publication).  By the time 
Mangham was ready to mail out his first issue, he had fifty subscribers. 
Since he needed a minimum of two hundred pieces to qualify for a bulk 
postage rate, his father found one hundred and fifty disks in his mailbox 
that month.

     To create his new "magazette",  Mangham chose to use double-sided 
disks that were pre-notched on both edges, to ensure that both sides would 
be useable.  (Recall that the Disk II drive could only use one side of the 
disk, and so it was common to conserve money and use the other side by 
cutting a notch on edge of the disk opposite the factory one and flipping 
the disk over.)  These double-sided disks were expensive, costing him three 
dollars apiece, and so he set up the subscriptions to require return of the 
previous issue in order to get the next one (it was left up to the reader 
to make his own copies to keep).  When the disk was returned with the five 
dollars for the next issue, the reader could also use a simple text editor 
on the disk to return any "letters to the editor" he might have, commenting 
on the previous issue's contents or asking other questions.  This return 
disk could also be used for submitting programs, pictures, or articles for 
use in future issues of Softdisk.  Some of the subscribers that became 
prolific contributors of material even ended up WORKING at Softdisk!<2>

     Softalk magazine provided free advertising for Softdisk, and the 
subscriber base gradually grew.  Some of the revenue for the magazine came 
from subscription payments, and some came through advertising.  Ads for 
Softdisk were sold by the disk sector, and provided an advertiser a unique 
opportunity; he could give a potential customer a chance to actually SEE 
how the program he was selling looked.  Some of the ads could be animated 
(usually using the text screen to use less disk space), and were actually 
entertaining.  This was most prominent in the ads Softdisk had for their 
own products; by 1983 they had begun a line of software called "Rich And 
Famous" (which they said was what the authors wanted to become).  
Consisting of programs written by regular Softdisk contributors, these 
disks sold for $9.95 apiece, and a $4 royalty on each disk went to the 
author.  The disks offered various types of games, including hi-res 
graphics adventures and card games, office-based utility software, general 
Apple II utilities, and disks of music (in Electric Duet format).

     Each issue of Softdisk had a "cover", which consisted of a hi-res 
picture and the issue number.  These eventually were created to look just 
like the Softalk logo, except the globe in the upper right corner was 
animated.  Starting in August 1983, Softdisk expanded to two double-sided 
disks, and the two-way subscriptions now requested that only one of the two 
had to be returned.  One-way subscriptions were also available by now, for 
those who didn't want to bother having to return the disks.  By January 
1984 (issue #27), Softdisk became available through retail stores 
(primarily computer stores, but later also through bookstores) at the price 
of $12.95 per issue.  They also began putting out a disk magazine called 
"Loadstar" for the Commodore 64 computer in June 1984, at a price of $9.95 
(since it was a single disk per issue it cost less).<3>

     As mentioned earlier, Softalk magazine folded after its August 1984 
issue, leaving the future of Softdisk somewhat in doubt.  In return for 
some benefits that Softalk had provided (free full-page ads, space in their 
booth at computer shows, and permission to include some programs from the 
magazine on Softdisk), it had part-ownership in Softdisk.  Since Softalk 
was now bankrupt, the possibility existed that Softdisk would be absorbed 
into the liquidation of assets.  To avoid this outcome and to ensure the 
future of the magazine, Softdisk purchased back its shares from Softalk's 
creditors (at a price probably higher than what they were worth) and 
continued on their own.  Although a few ads were placed in remaining Apple 
II magazines after that, Softdisk continued primarily on word-of-mouth 
referrals (which didn't increase circulation by much).  Sales of some side 
items (primarily blank disks) helped keep the company going during this 
difficult time.<4>

     In May 1985, the two-way disk subscriptions were discontinued, and Al 
Tommervik started a brief tenure as editor-in-chief.  He helped develop a 
more professional appearance for the magazine (and for Loadstar), through 
higher quality graphics and cover design.  When Greg Malone began as 
editor-in-chief in late 1985, he continued the improvements by starting a 
graphics-based presentation in favor of the older text-based method they 
had used from the beginning.<4>

     Softdisk, Inc. added a disk magazine in 1986 for the IBM PC, called 
"Big Blue Disk".<5>  At this time Softdisk magazine itself began including 
re-releases of older commercial software whose publishers were willing to 
inexpensively release publishing rights; they also began to publish some 
newer shareware programs.  The first series of "reprints" were games 
previously released by Polarware/Penguin Software.<6>

     By 1987, Softdisk began again advertising itself in magazines, a 
practice that has been continued up to the present time.  This began a 
large expansion in circulation for the Softdisk magazette and their other 
disk publications.<6>  Later that year saw the changeover from the older 
DOS 3.3 operating system exclusively to ProDOS (beginning with issue #73). 
This issue also saw the start of a more attractive graphic user interface 
that supported use of a mouse (as well as the keyboard), and had pulldown 
menus and animated graphics.  Within the next year or so, retail 
distribution of their publications was discontinued (booksellers were not 
leaving the products on the shelf long enough to allow them to sell) and 
distribution returned exclusively to a subscription basis.<7>

     In November 1988, the first issue of Softdisk G-S was released, 
supporting the standard IIgs desktop interface standards.  This publication 
has maintained a high quality standard and has done well.  At the time of 
this writing, Softdisk, Inc. continues to put out the following monthly 
disk magazines:  Softdisk for 8-bit Apple II's; Softdisk G-S for the IIgs; 
On Disk Monthly (formerly Big Blue Disk) for the IBM PC; Gamer's Edge, also 
for the IBM PC; and Diskworld for the Macintosh.  Loadstar for the 
Commodore 64/128 is still available, but only on a quarterly basis.


II Alive (Mar 1993-Present)   Joe Gleason was the president of Quality
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Computers, an Apple II mail order company 
based in St. Clair Shores, Michigan.  He observed with considerable concern 
the gradual erosion of Apple II-specific information through the format of 
the traditional slick magazine.  When inCider/A+ added Macintosh coverage, 
this began the gradual decline in the fortunes of that magazine, which was 
Quality's major advertising outlet.  Quality had begun a combination 
magazine and catalog called Enhance, with a focus towards educators (where 
the Apple II was still fairly strong).  But Gleason wanted something more.

     Jerry Kindall, who worked at Quality and was a frequent presence on 
the online services, made this announcement in October 1992:  "When 
inCider/A+ decided to switch over to a primarily Macintosh focus, we 
decided the time was right for us to start our own Apple II publication to 
fill the void.  II Alive will begin publication in...1993.  Every single 
article will discuss the Apple II.  Every single ad will promote Apple II 
products.  The Mac will be mentioned only in connection with the Apple II 
(as will the IBM)--for example, in articles on networking or file 
exchange."<10>

     They planned to initially offer the magazine on a bi-monthly basis, 
and for people who subscribed before December 31, 1992 they offered a free 
video tape that highlighted new Apple II products.<10>  A sample issue of 
the magazine was mailed out to everyone on Quality's mailing list in early 
1993, and the first official issue appeared in March 1993.  The logo on the 
cover had a circle around the title announcing the flavor of the magazine, 
"Celebrating The Apple II".  Kindall was named as editor-in-chief, and 
eventually had some other staff hired to help him:  Ellen Rosenberg, as 
managing editor (formerly editor of A2-Central); Doug Cuff as consulting 
editor (also editor of the online magazine GEnieLamp A2 and writing for 
A2-Central); and Tara Dillinger as Interview Editor (who was also in charge 
of doing online interviews on the A2 Roundtable on GEnie).

     Regular columns featured in II Alive included Test Drives (reviews of 
new products), Ask Mr. Tech (technical questions and answers), Head Of The 
Class (programs that were of particular interest to educators), AppleWorks 
At Large (tips on uses for that program), Macro Exchange (sample 
UltraMacros programs for AppleWorks), Modem Nation (information about 
telecommunications), Shareware Spy (discussion of freeware and shareware 
software), and more.

     Compared to inCider, this magazine seemed to be having fun in the 
various articles it presented, and attempted to capture a little of the 
flavor of Softalk from the old days.  Because of Quality's introduction of 
AppleWorks 4.0 in the fall of 1993, the November/December issue was not 
available until late in December (Kindall also was responsible for writing 
the manual for that program); however, after this they worked hard at 
returning to their correct bi-monthly schedule.  At this time, II Alive is 
the only glossy magazine that deals with both the 8-bit and 16-bit versions 
of the Apple II.


Shareware Solutions II (1993-Present)   Joe Kohn had been writing articles
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   and a regular column called 
"Shareware Solutions" for inCider for quite a while, when the rug got 
pulled out from under him by the demise of the magazine.  He had taken 
extra efforts to make disks available to readers who didn't have modems, 
disks that contained some of the best available shareware and freeware 
programs he could find.  To continue in these efforts, in mid-1993 he 
decided to begin a self-published newsletter called Shareware Solutions II. 
He posted on GEnie that his newsletter would "take Apple II users on an 
exciting journey into the future.  Each month, I plan to write articles 
about freeware/shareware (of course) and will continue to provide low cost 
freeware/shareware disks to subscribers via the mail.  There will also be 
Apple II oriented reviews and articles that focus on low cost solutions to 
common Apple II problems.  There will be columns geared to novices and new 
modem owners; techies, hackers, teens, senior citizens and educators alike 
should find lots to interest them.... Subscribers will learn how to tame 
their Apple II computer, and will learn what it will take to make their 
Apple II a powerful computer solution well into the next century and 
beyond.

     "I believed it when Apple proclaimed 'Apple II Forever', and 
Shareware Solutions II will help to make that more than just an empty 
slogan!"<11>

     Rather than to try to stick to a specific publishing schedule, Kohn 
decided to sell his subscriptions on the basis of the number of issues, 
rather than by the year.  As his bi-monthly schedule fell behind at times 
this plan turned out to be wise.  And the content of his newsletter 
reflected the extra care that could be taken when a deadline didn't have to 
be rigidly adhered to; his first few issues have been excellent, including 
some special offers of commercial software for readers.  It is to be hoped 
that Shareware Solutions II will be around for a long time.


Foreign Apple II Magazines   The Apple II not only got press in the United
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   States, but has also been on the newsstands in 
Europe in various forms, though most are no longer being published.  One 
that began as "Windfall" (later changing its name to "Apple User") was the 
biggest magazine for some time.  "Peeker" was published in Germany, and 
carried articles similar to those found in Nibble.  In the Netherlands 
there are still a few hobbyist magazines that cater to the Apple II crowd, 
including "Klokhuis" (which means "Apple-Core"), "Pro-2" and "Het 
AppleDossier".<8>

     In Britain there was at one time a magazine called "Orchard 
Computing", published by a company named Argus Specialist Publications. 
Some of the issues were primarily reprints from Nibble, but they also 
accepted articles from local readers.<9>
