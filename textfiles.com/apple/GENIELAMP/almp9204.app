TOP OF THE PAGE   Talk about changes!  GEnie Lamp has divided into four
"""""""""""""""   separate issues.  Along with the original Atari ST
GEnie Lamp, we now offer the magazine for the IBM, Macintosh and Apple
][ RoundTables as well.  From now on you will be able to find GEnie Lamp
as an online readable file in each of the respective RoundTable's main
menu.  Better yet, access to the GEnie Lamp magazines is now available
as part of your GEnie*Basic package!  That is, when you capture GEnie
Lamp from the RoundTable's main menu, the GEnie clock will be off.
Cool!  (Note that this applies _only_ to the version that is found on
the ST RoundTable main menu, _not_ the libraries.)

     But wait, there's more!  GEnie Lamp now has a new home.  The GEnie
Lamp RoundTable is located on page 515.  Here, you will find all the
latest issues and back issues of GEnie Lamp Online magazine.

     Although we have split into four issues, I think you'll find that
very little has changed in terms of context.  There are several new
people on the GEnie Lamp staff and all of them are excited about
bringing to you all the latest news, hot messages, latest files and
information about your favorite RoundTable.

     If you like to hang out in the ST, IBM, Macintosh or Apple ][
RoundTable, there's something for you in GEnie Lamp!

TOP OF THE PAGE II   Well folks, welcome to the first issue of the
""""""""""""""""""   Apple II GEnie Lamp.  Those of us who have been
working on this are quite excited and eager to share our efforts with
you.

     The most important aspect of GEnie Lamp is that it is _your_ online
magazine.  GEnie Lamp ][ is a monthly round-up of the RT's events and
postings.  As such, much of it will be taken right from your postings.
Who knows?  Chances are you will get quoted in an issue real soon.

     We are actively seeking your involvement too.  Remember, every
GEnie Lamp article published means free time in the A2 RT.  And even if
you do not need the free time, you will want to get involved to support
the Apple II community you love...  or just do it for the fun of it!

IT CAN'T WAIT!   Wednesday, March 25, will be my last day as head sysop
""""""""""""""   of the Apple II RoundTables.  On Thursday, March 26, I
shall move east in GEnie to a new job--as manager of the Religion and
Ethic RT (p.390).

     I want to publically thank everyone on the A2 and A2PRO staff for
what has been four years of working pleasure. In particular, I bow in
gratitude to Tom Weishaar, who gave me the room to do what I could to
build the Apple II RoundTables into THE place to be for fun and solid
information for Apple II computers.

     I also want to thank each of you who have visited A2 and A2PRO
over the years.  Many of you have become long-distance friends, and I
value our relationships.

     Thanks to everyone for four good years.

NEW SYSTEM SOFTWARE/HYPERCARD RELEASED!
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     CUPERTINO, California--March 24, 1992--Apple Computer, Inc.  today
introduced new system software and an upgraded version of HyperCard IIGS
for the Apple IIGS personal computer.

     Apple IIGS System 6 software offers an enhanced user interface,
greater speed and performance, and data exchange capabilities not
available on current Apple IIGS operating systems.  HyperCard IIGS
version 1.1 has been upgraded to include a Media Control stack for
operating CD ROMs and videodisk players, and new HyperTalk scripting
capabilities.

     "Apple IIGS System 6 encompasses the most robust and feature-rich
system software offered since the introduction of the Apple IIGS in 1986,
bringing Apple II customers much of the same ease-of-use and
functionality now available on the System 7 Finder for the Macintosh,"
said John Santoro, Apple II product manager.  "The extensive development
of System 6 and HyperCard IIGS version 1.1 underline Apple's continuing
support of the Apple II line."


FEATURES & BENEFITS   Apple IIGS System 6 features three new File
"""""""""""""""""""   System Translators that provide easy access to
Macintosh disks, Pascal disks, Apple II DOS 3.3 disks.

     In addition, Apple IIGS System 6 offers users significant feature
enhancements to control panel and desk accessory functionality, providing
an enhanced new "look and feel" to the Apple IIGS.  Control panels can be
opened directly from the desktop and Find File and Calculator desk
accessories have been incorporated.

     Finder Help on Apple IIGS System 6 can be accessed through pop-up
menus and kept on screen while users step through procedures.  Window
handling and window appearance have also been enhanced, making it easier
to move between and manage multiple windows on a single screen.

     Apple IIGS System 6 offers two new applications--Teach and Archiver.
Teach is a desktop text processor that enables the user to jot down
notes, read disk files and create formatted or unformatted text
documents.  Teach also provides file import capability from ASCII,
AppleWorks version 3.0, AppleWorks GS, MacWrite version 5.0 formats and
AppleWriter.  Archiver offers flexible hard disk backup functions to save
and restore either individual files or entire volumes.

     The Apple IIGS System 6 Media Control toolset is a new
tool/driver/control panel/desk accessory combination that allows users to
integrate, configure and manage highly sophisticated multimedia effects.
The performance of this toolset is optimized when used in conjunction
with HyperCard IIGS version 1.1.

     The Universal Access suite (also available on Macintosh System 7
software) opens the Apple IIGS to disabled users via Video Keyboard, Easy
Access and Closeview programs, simplifying system use for the visually or
physically impaired.    As with the System 5 series, Apple IIGS System 6
users can network their Apple IIGS computers with each other and with
Apple IIe, Macintosh and MS-DOS computers.  However, System 6 improves
networking functionality via EasyMount, a new feature which allows users
to mount a network server with a simple double-click command.

     Apple IIGS System 6 replaces Apple IIGS System 5.0.4 for the
stand-alone Apple IIGS, providing a consistent graphical interface and
high performance for both the individual and networked user.


SPEED & FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS   HyperCard IIGS version 1.1 features a
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Media Control Stack for the control of
external media devices such as Laserdisk players and CD- ROM drives from
within the stack.  Control is provided to the user through a common
interface to two external devices by using standard "Play", "Fast Fwd",
etc., buttons or floating control panels.    A Tune Builder stack allows
the user to create short original tunes by simply clicking the mouse on
the stack's music staff.  Notes can be played in variable time and with
the voices of a large collection of instruments.  These tunes can then be
used as enhancements to other original stacks by cutting and pasting.

     HyperCard IIGS version 1.1 has incorporated features from Macintosh
HyperCard version 2.0 and 2.1, such as HyperTalk extensions and X
Windows.  As with original HyperCard IIGS, version 1.1 is also in color.

     The Apple IIGS SuperDrive Controller card is also available for the
enhanced Apple IIE and Apple IIGS, allowing users to utilize Apple's
SuperDrive which permits the use of 1.4MB floppy disks.  The SuperDrive
card also operates all other Apple II 3.5 disk drives.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS   Stand-alone Apple IIGS System 6 software requires
"""""""""""""""""""   an Apple IIGS personal computer with at least 1MB
of RAM, ROM version 01 or 03 and one 3.5-inch disk drive, although
configurations of 2MB of RAM and a hard drive is recommended for optimal
performance.  Networked systems require Apple IIGS computers with at
least 768K RAM, ROM version 01 or 03 and appropriate LocalTalk cables.

     HyperCard IIGS version 1.1 requires an Apple IIGS personal computer
with 1.5MB RAM, one 800K disk drive and hard disk or connection to a
networked environment, and system software 5.0.3 or subsequent version.


PRICE & AVAILABILITY   The Apple IIGS System 6 package includes six
""""""""""""""""""""   3.5-inch disks containing system and set-up
software and system tools, as well as the Apple IIGS System Software
User's Guide.  The package will be available in early April from
authorized Apple dealers, Apple Educations Sales Consultants, and
Resource Central, Inc.  (913) 469-6502) for a suggested retail price of
$39 in the United States.

     Apple is also making Apple IIGS System 6 software available from
licensed user groups and licensed on-line services.

     HyperCard IIGS version 1.1 will be available in early April from
authorized Apple Dealers and Resource Central, Inc.  for a suggested
retail price of $69.  HyperCard IIGS 1.0 owners can purchase an upgrade
to version 1.1 from Resource Central, Inc.

SYSTEM 6.0 NOW AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING!   The Apple II RoundTable is
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   pleased to announce that
System 6.0 is now available for downloading in the A2 libraries!  To get
in on this hot new operating system, which brings untold levels of power
and flexibility to your IIgs, check out the following files in the A2
libraries (page 645, option #3):

   18176 ABOUT.SYS6.TXT        IMPORTANT info on System 6.0!  Read!
   18145 S6.SYSDISK.BXY        Main SYSTEM DISK for IIgs System 6.0
   18144 S6.SYNTHLAB.BXY       SYNTHLAB disk for IIgs System 6.0
   18143 S6.FONTS.BXY          FONTS disk for IIgs System 6.0

   18141 S6.TOOLS1.BXY         SYSTEM TOOLS disk #1 for System 6.0
   18140 S6.INSTALL.BXY        INSTALL disk for IIgs System 6.0

     System 6.0 for the IIgs comes on six disks.  It's a long download
but well worth your time.  But you don't have to download all six disks!
But be sure to first check out file #18176, ABOUT.SYS6.TXT for more
details on what you'll need to get this amazing new software for your
IIgs.

     To find out more about the new System 6.0, or for help installing
it, check out Category 8, Topic 9 of the A2 bulletin board!


ENHANCED APPLE IIE AND IIC USERS ALSO BENEFIT FROM NEW SYSTEM SOFTWARE!

     If you don't have a IIgs, you're still in luck.  The new versions
of ProDOS 8 and Basic.System are also available now in the A2 library.
They include a number of bug fixes and enhancements over previous
versions.

     Probably the most exciting feature of the new PRODOS 8 version
2.01 is the ability to access more than two drive/devices per slot,
something many Apple II users have been begging for for ages!

     ProDOS 8 version 2.01 requires an enhanced Apple IIe or IIc.  It
will not work on the un-enhanced IIe or the II+.

     Here are the files you'll need to access this new system software
for 8-bit systems (it's included automatically with System 6.0 for the
IIgs, so if you have a IIgs you don't need to download these):

      18169 BASIC.1.5.BXY          BASIC.SYSTEM version 1.5.1
      18168 PRODOS.2.01.BXY        ProDOS 8 version 2.01


THANKS, APPLE!   Our thanks goes out to Apple Computer, Inc. for
""""""""""""""   providing these fantastic enhancements to the Apple II
line and for allowing GEnie users to be among the first in the country
to get them.  -Dean Esmay

the Research Lab as we tried to put the first one ever together.

     The MIT/IBM story I remember is when they were trying to reach
agreement on royalties for the development of "core" memory.  At one
time MIT turned down an offer from IBM of 1 cent per bit of core (I
assume some people still k? ow what core was).  MIT turned it down - and
took a couple of 7094's and $7 million instead. If MIT had taken it,
they would now own IBM.

     Later on, I actually worked on a project whose software development
methodology was reviewed by Grace Hopper.  I got to do a presentation to
her.  Talk about sweat!  She was tough.  But fair and very smart.

     Did anyone use mylar tape? We used that for archives (before Andy
Nichols).

     About 5 years ago I was a consultant for a job a JPL.  I studied
network traffic in Europe.  We discovered one Army network with strange
characteristics.  Further investigation showed that the network consisted
of a large warehouse with many model 35 ASR teletypes with paper tape
readers and punches.

     When a message came in it was punched on paper tape.  An army
corporal would then carry it from teletype to teletype to forward the
message to other nodes.  (was that you Gary?) The speed of a message
depended on the relative positions of the teletypes!!!  There was one
anomaly in the speed characteristics - the owner of the building got the
message first. - #Bill Mosier

>>>>>   I don't know about the first "bug", but I can relate a "bird"
"""""   story. When I was working at Continental Bank in Chicago, my
analyst boss told me about when he worked for a super-secret military
computer center - with IBM 1440 CPUs.  The trouble was, that it didn't
have air conditioning, so they made-do by leaving the windows open.  This
kept the machines cool, but it had an interesting side effect.  It seemed
that the _BIRDS_ liked the warmth, especially the pigeons.  They would
fly in and _roost_ on the cpu, dropping their you-know-what into the
innards of the machines.  (and you thought that YOU worked for a
chicken-sh*t company!).

     After a while, the s**t dried out, and piled up.  On the power
supply. Eventually, it hit combustion temperature and the cpu caught on
fire!

     The first thing they did was to call the fire department.  Then they
realized that the card decks contained super-secret data, so...they
locked the door.  They could not secure the cards, so they decided to
destroy them.  And the quickest way to destroy them was to throw them on
the fire! They didn't let the fire department in until all the secret
cards had been destroyed!  This _is_ a true story!  #Ken Lessing

>>>>>   Here's the entry on "bug" from _The New Hacker's Dictionary_,
"""""   edited by Eric S. Raymond:  "Historical note: Some have said
this term came from telephone company usage, in which 'bugs in a
telephone cable' were blamed for noisy lines, but this appears to be an
incorrect folk etymology.  Admiral Grace Hopper (an early computing
pioneer better known for inventing COBOL) liked to tell a story in which
a technician solved a persistent glitch in the Harvard Mark II machine
by pulling an actual insect out from between the contacts of one of its
relays, and she subsequently promulgated bug in its hackish sense as a
joke about the incident (though, as she was careful to admit, she was
not there when it happened).  For many years the logbook associated with
the incident and the actual bug in question (a moth) sat in a display
case at the Naval Surface Warfare Center.  The entire story, with a
picture of the logbook and the moth taped into it, is recorded in the
_Annals of the History of Computing_, Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981), pp.
285-286.

     "The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1945), reads '1545
Relay 70 Panel F (moth) in relay.  First actual case of bug being
found'.  This wording seems to establish that the term was already in
use at the time in its current specific sense.  Indeed, the use of bug
to mean an industrial defect was already established in Edison's time,
and bug in the sense of a disruptive event goes back to Shakespeare!  In
the first edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary one meaning of bug is
'A frightful object; a walking spectre'; this is traced to 'bugbear', a
Welsh term for a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the
circle) has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon through
fantasy role-playing games."  Jeff

IIGS MULTITASKING?   Multitasking for the IIGS?  What once was a foolish
""""""""""""""""""   dream for those suffering Mac envy has become
reality.  While it may take some time before any real applications are
available, the operating environment is here today thanks to Procyon:

>>>>>   Procyon, Inc. announced today the release of the GNO
"""""   Multitasking Environment (or GNO/ME) for the Apple IIgs
microcomputer.  GNO/ME brings all the power of the Unix operating system
to the IIgs for the first time.

     "GNO/ME is a programmer's dream," said Jawaid Bazyar, head of the
project.  "So many things are possible now that just weren't before."

     Jawaid is referring to GNO/ME's multitasking ability: many programs
may be run simultaneously, either interactively with the user or in the
background, where the program does it's processing (printing, compiling
a program, searching files, etc) while allowing the user to seamlessly
move on to other tasks.

     Another GNO/ME feature is multiple terminals; more than one person
can use the same IIgs at a time.  Such programs as multi-user BBS
systems are now possible.

     Matt Gudermuth, President of Procyon Inc., tells about the company.
"We founded Procyon to bring high-quality products to the badly
neglected Apple IIgs market.  It makes no sense that no one is
developing for this machine which is still far from it's capabilities,
and among all the PC brands in existence has the most loyal and
supportive user base."

     "This is something we've all been waiting for for a long time",
says Tim Meekins, the other principal programmer.  "GNO gives me the
ability to do things I only used to be able to do on the $10,000
workstations in the labs at school.  When the IIgs was released, it was
the most technologically advanced PC in the world.  GNO brings the IIgs
once again to the forefront of the home computer world."

     GNO comes with almost 40 utilities tailored specifically for the
GNO environment, and also comes with the C and assembly _source code_
for these programs, to allow budding programmers to see how it's done.

     GNO also comes with a large library of Unix subroutines, to make
porting Unix software to run on the IIgs easier than ever.  The powerful
libraries include curses and termcap flexible screen manipulation for
any terminal type, and all the C library routines your IIgs C compiler
forgot about!

     For those of you out there who like Unix, and don't want to spend
the thousands of dollars needed for a Unix computer or even for Unix for
DOS machines, GNO is an unbeatable value.

     The price for the GNO system (3 disks and full printed manuals) is
$80 US plus shipping.  Shipping is by USMail First Class ($3), or
International Airmail ($5).  GNO/ME can be ordered directly from the
publisher:

RE: Sales of Apple II Line and Apple dealers

     I have a question about the way your authorized Apple dealers are
doing business.

     I have now spoken to five different Apple salesmen about information
on and the purchasing of an Apple IIGS.  Here is what they have said:

EXPERIENCE #1   Salesman #1: "May I help you?"  Me: "Yes, I'm interested
"""""""""""""   in buying an Apple IIGS, but I don't see one here in
your store."

     Salesman #1: "Is this for a school or personal use?"

     Me: "Personal use."

     Salesman #1: "You know, the IIGS has a very short life.  After next
     year, Apple is no longer making it."

     Me: "Is that a rumor, or a fact?"

     Salesman #1: "It's a fact.  APPLE HAS NOT YET INFORMED THE GENERAL
PUBLIC, BUT THEY HAVE LET DEALERS KNOW THAT LATE IN 1992, THE IIGS WILL
NO LONGER BE MANUFACTURED.  I'm sorry to tell you this, but it is the
truth."

     Me: "Why is Apple discontinuing the IIGS?"

     Salesman #1: "Because Apple believes the Mac can do so much more in
terms of high end software."

     Me: "But I'm not at all interested in a Mac - I'd have to buy all
new software."

     Salesman #1: "Yes, that's what all the educators are telling us too.
But we do have the Mac LC, which has a //e emulation card."

     Me: "I understand there are some problems with the emulation."

     Salesman #1: "Yes, especially with the system 7 software.  That's
why we sell it bundled with system 6 software, but Apple is working on a
fix for it."

     At this point I walked over to the Mac LC, which had the //e card
up and running, but I couldn't make it do much.  It appears that it
cannot use the Mac hard drive, there is no way of using //e interface
cards (such as the //e scanner), it will not run IIGS software, and it
is not up to the speed of my real //e which uses a ZIP chip.

EXPERIENCE #2   Same store, a week later.
"""""""""""""
     Me: "I'd like to look at an Apple IIGS, please."

     Salesman #2: "I'm sorry, we don't have one anymore.  Perhaps
there's one in for repair you could look at."

     Me: "I'd like to see a working IIGS."

     Salesman #2: "Oh, no, that wouldn't work.  We would have to special
order one if you really wanted one.  We don't normally carry it."

     Me: "Why not?"

     Salesman #2: "It isn't selling well enough - that's why we don't
have one to show to people."

EXPERIENCE #3   A different authorized Apple reseller:
"""""""""""""
Salesman #3: "Apple II is no longer made."

     Me: "Which Apple II are you talking about?"

     Salesman #3: "Apple is no longer making ANY of the II line."

     Me: "Who told you that?"

     Salesman #3: "We know that because we are an authorized Apple
dealer.  We should know."

EXPERIENCE #4   Same store, a different salesman:
"""""""""""""
     Salesman #4: "Apple II is no longer manufactured."

     Me: "Is that a rumor, a way to sell Mac's, or what?"

     Salesman #4: "It's a fact."

     Me: "I don't believe it. Our school just bought a brand new Apple
IIGS."

     Salesman #4: "Apple is selling from their stock.  But they are no
longer manufacturing the IIGS."

     Me: "Can you show me some documentation from Apple?"

     Salesman #4: "Well no, Apple has not come right out and said it,
but we know the Apple II has been discontinued because none of the II's
show up on the price list."

     At this point I asked to talk with the manager of the store, who
told me the same thing.  Asking for documentation, he phoned his manager
and asked how they knew that Apple II's were no longer made.

     After the call he said, "Well, well, well.  The Apple IIGS and the
//e are still on the price list after all.  But we feel that they will
probably be discontinued next year."

     Is this how to sell Apple computers!!!???  I was ready to spend the
money to buy a IIGS because I have used Apple for many years.  I started
on a II+, then purchased two //e's, which I use in my ministry, one at
home, the other at the office.  I'm interested in staying with the II
family.  I do not want a Mac.

     I would have to buy all new software as well as throw away my
interface cards.  A IIGS at the office would allow me to continue using
what I have at home, as well as my software.  But I can't find a dealer
who will even show me one.

     And after talking with these five authorized Apple dealers who have
told me that it is or soon will be no longer made, I'm not even sure if
I want one anymore.  Who wants to buy an orphan?

     So I've begun looking at IBM compatibles.  Everyone else at the
office uses IBM compatibles.

     I'm looking at a 16 MHz 386SX system made by BSR with a .28 dot
pitch super VGA monitor, 40 MB HD, both 5 1/4" and 3 1/2" disk drives, 1
MB Ram, 101-key extended keyboard, for under $1300.  (There are systems
selling for a lot less, but they may be junk.)

     But I'd really like to stay with Apple.  But not with the sort of
trash the dealers are telling me.  Or are they telling the truth?

     Can you tell me something to help me stay with Apple?  Are you
planning on discontinuing the Apple II line next year?  I have heard a
rumor from two people now (not Apple dealers) that you are working on a
new II line computer - is this true?

     I would suggest that in order to stop the rumor mill, Apple come
right out and say what you plan to do.  Is the Apple II dead (dying
within the year), or is there something new on the horizon?

     I'd appreciate an answer.  Thanks.

                                                  Sincerely,
                                                 Terrell Smith

like that.  :)  That makes the GS a great market for new or small niche
market publishers.

     As for finding someone to release GS or Apple II programs that are
no longer in print, that's being done.  Beagle Bros. has done that with
several programs, Big Red Apple has bought up a lot of stock, and I'm
trying to find the current address for whoever owns Pecan's copyrights
to swing a deal.  All you have to do to keep a program in print --
assuming it's one that can still sell several hundred copies -- is find
out who owns the copyright and which current Apple II publisher does
that sort of program and make sure they know about each other.

     The Apple II isn't dead, and won't be for a long time.  The kind of
market has just changed -- a lot!  :)

     P.S.  We made more from the II in 1991 than in 1990, and more in
1990 than in 1989, etc.  We expect to make more in 1992 than in 1991.
We'll be here for a while, guys.  :)

Shareware, Freeware or ???
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
By Richard Vega
       [R.VEGA]



               >>> SHAREWARE, FREEWARE OR?  CONFUSED? <<<
               """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

SO WHAT IS IT?   In putting together the PD_Quickview article for the
""""""""""""""   first issue of the GEnie Lamp Mac I noticed that the
application was shareware, not public domain. I then started to ask
around to see how many people really knew the difference between them
was. I even watch a news shows where the anchorman was using the wrong
definitions. This article is going to attempt to address that, along with
some of the other terms we use for the files found in the public
libraries.

     The basic terms used for files are public domain, shareware,
copyrighted and freeware. The first thing to understand about these
terms is that they are not mutually exclusive. That will be explained
more as I explain each one. If you are going to download files from a
BBS then it is important to have at least a working knowledge of these
terms. Please note that when I use the word file, I am talking about an
application, graphic or anything that is the result of someone's work.
In fact it doesn't even have to be computer related.


PUBLIC DOMAIN   The most common term used is public domain. Most people
"""""""""""""   believe that if you can share the file with your friend
then it is in public domain. There was a time when this was true. It is
not true now.  Public domain means that the author gives up any rights
to what happens to the file. It can be used, copied changed or treated
in any way. It can even be included in a commercial product.

     This last point is important when we are talking about computer
program code.  The issue came to a head on the MS-DOS platform with the
ARC compression format.  To those who may not know, ARC on the MS-DOS
machines is the standard for compressing files together for transferring
over a modem. It is the equivalent to the Stuffit format on the
Macintosh.  What happen is that a company came out with a compatible
PKARC program for sale. The author of the ARC code, which was freely
distributed claimed that the ARC format was not public domain. Therefore
even though anyone could get a copy of ARC, the author of PKARC could
not use the code in the commercial program.

     The result of this disagreement is not as important as the basis
for the disagreement. If the ARC code was in public domain the the
author had no basis for his objection. The PKARC author could use the
code in his commercial program. If the ARC program was not in public
domain, even though it was free, then the PKARC author did not have the
right to use it, or alter it, without first receiving permission from
the ARC author.


SHAREWARE   The most common files found on public BBS systems are
"""""""""   shareware. This sprang up due to the fact that many users
where complaining that software was becoming to expensive and the you
could not return it if it did not live up to the claims made by the
publishers.  People wanted to be able to "try before you buy!" With
shareware you can get a copy off a BBS or from a friend, try out the
program for a while, and then decide if you want to pay for it or not.
Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?

     Almost immediately people started to confuse shareware with public
domain. It was understandable since up to that time anything found open
to the public was public domain. Shareware authors have their hands
full.  They first have to make the public understand that the files they
release as shareware may not be freely used, changed or altered. Second,
they are trying to find a way to get people to pay the money asked for,
if and when they decided to use the files.

     The results of the "shareware wars" have been interesting. Some
have chosen to just place the files in public with clear messages about
what they want. Others have released crippled versions of applications,
or sample files. When you pay the "THE RESULTS OF THE 'SHAREWARE     fee
you then receive the full WARS' HAVE BEEN INTERESTING."     working
copies of the files with documentation. To date I am not sure what has
been the result of any of these efforts. I have been in on many
discussions that often become heated. The bottom line I see is many
people don't understand that the author of shareware files have retained
all rights to that file. We have seen some files move from shareware to
becoming commercially packaged and distributed. Some have done very well
for the authors on the dealers shelf. As shareware they didn't bring in
a penny. The files' rights were always owned by the author. What changed
was the way the author choose to distributed it.


COPYRIGHTED   Copyright for software hold the same rights, and same
""""""""""""  muddled clarity, that it does for any other area of
creative work. Simply stated, any creative work is under the control of
it's author unless legally given to another.

     What has caused confusion is twofold. First, in the beginning,
computer programers worked mostly in a club atmosphere. Code and
programing style was freely passed around. With the onset of the
personal computer came the software marketplace and the need of
protecting you code under the copyright laws. The concept of passing
around code, ideas, programing style and even full working application
has hung on, especially in schools and "hacker" user groups. The ethics
of "a fair wage for fair labor" is slowly making it's way in the
computer users circles. As computers become an everyday items in peoples
houses the understanding of copyrighted software should become clearer.

     The other confusion lies in the fact that some software is free for
the taking.  This leads many to think that the author has given up the
                                        rights to the file (be it code,
     "THIS WAS CLEARLY SHOWN WHEN       application or data). What needs
      APPLE DECIDED TO GIVE AWAY        to be made clear is that the
      MACWRITE AND MACPAINT WITH        author of any work has the right
      EACH MACINTOSH. THEN THEY         to what happens to that work.
      DECIDED TO SELL IT SEPARATELY.    That means the right to say if,
      MANY PEOPLE DISAGREED WITH        when, where and how the creative
      THIS MOVE BUT IT WAS WITHIN       work is distributed. If some is
      APPLE'S LEGAL RIGHTS.             given freely away and then sold
                                        to others, it is within the
copyright owners right to do that. The only action that removes that
right is a legal written release of those rights. This was clearly shown
when Apple decided to give away Macwrite and MacPaint with each
Macintosh. Then they decided to sell it separately. Many people
disagreed with this move but it was within Apple's legal rights.


FREEWARE   The newest term being used is Freeware. This term was coined
""""""""   in an attempt to clear up the confusion mentioned above.
There are many files given away freely but still not in public domain.
These files often come with restrictions about how they are to be
distributed. Some are very specific about how they are _not_ to be
distributed, such as through "pay per disk" shareware companies. The
author doesn't want any money for their work and doesn't want anyone
else making money from their work. As stated above, they have the right
to make that limitation, even if we do not agree with them.

     When you get a copy of an application look for the copyright
screen.  This will tell you if the author is keeping the copyrights. If
the screen _does not_ clearly place the file into the public domain then
the rights are retained. Look also in any documentation files that come
with the file. These often contain directions as to how the file may be
shared. Be careful, for these sometime contain very restrictive
directions. Many distribution rights are restricted to GEnie or other
on-line BBS systems.


SUMMARY   Some people believe that the copyright laws are unclear about
"""""""   computer software and data. In some areas that many be true.
In the world that most of us work and play, the copyright laws are very
clear. Our rights to use and share any creative work, be it on the
computer, on canvas or in any other form are limited by the copyright
holder of that work (usually the creator). The copyright owner then has
the responsibility to make those limits clear to us in a manner that we
can understand.

Your Apple II Needs A Quickie
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
By Larry Faust
    [L.FAUST2]



THE QUICKIE SCANNER   The Quickie scanner by Vitesse promises to be one
"""""""""""""""""""   of the new products that can breathe new life into
the Apple II. It is a hand-held half page black & white scanner with up
to 400 dpi (dots per inch) resolution. Although I have mine installed on
my IIgs, the Quickie will work just as well on the IIe, the II+, or the
Laser 128.

     The scanner comes with a 6 foot cord, bootable GS/OS and ProDOS
versions of it's software on both 3.5" and 5.25" disks, and an interface
                                        card. The installation
     "THE QUICKIE SCANNER BY VITESSE    procedure is adequately
      PROMISES TO BE ONE OF THE NEW     documented in the 46 page
      PRODUCTS THAT CAN BREATHE         manual. Basically, installation
      NEW LIFE INTO THE APPLE II."      takes less than 5 minutes and
                                        boils down to plugging the card
in a slot, attaching the card's socket to the backplane of the computer
and plugging the scanner into it.

     Although the manual claims that the card can be installed and
operates "invisibly" in any slot, the short cable that goes from the
socket to the card doesn't allow for placement in any other slots other
than 1 or 2 on the GS. It also fails to give any alternative to the
"short access hole" (next to slot 2 on the GS) into which the card's
mini-DIN socket is fastened. Mine was occupied with my ProGrappler
cable, and after thinking about the problem for a little while, I chose
to move the ProGrappler cable and "modify" one of the removable plastic
covers for the longer slots for it.

     The software is equally as simple as the normal installation. The
GS/OS version comes with a run-time version of "Wings", another Vitesse
product, which further simplifies the process, and presents the
ever-familiar desktop interface. One particularly nice touch to the GS
version is the inclusion of a condensed version of the program that can
be installed as an New Desk Accessory (NDA) which can be invoked from
within virtually any GS application. (Another documentation failure: the
manual fails to point out that not only "Quickie.NDA" must be in the
Desk.Accs folder, but the file "Quickie.Prefs" must be as well!). The
choices on the pull down menus in the GS version (both stand-alone and
NDA) have keyboard equivalents.  However, the scanning options in the
NDA version are limited as compared with those of the application
itself. By contrast, the ProDOS version is simply menu driven.

     The real fun begins with the actual operation of the scanner. Once
you set the appropriate method of scaling the grey tones, proper use of
                                        the Letter/Photo switch and the
     "THE REAL FUN BEGINS WITH THE      contrast thumbwheel takes a bit
      ACTUAL OPERATION OF THE           of practice (A minor complaint:
      SCANNER."                         the infinitely-adjustable thumb-
                                        wheel is positioned right where 
one's hand would grasp the unit for scanning, and therefore is very easy
to move unintentionally). Scanning takes a steady movement of the scan
head- the software constantly "clicks" as you move the head during a
scan, letting you know when you're going too fast.

     My own experience with the scanner has led me to a somewhat
surprising solution for getting consistently straight and smooth scans-
use a "Rolling Ruler" held firmly against the top edge of the scan head.
The ruler's "wheelbase" is wider than that of the scan head, and the
straightedge provides an ideal method of making sure the material to be
scanned is lined up correctly.

     Once you finish the scan, the scanned image is processed according
to your settings and displayed on the screen. The processing time is
dependent on your settings as well as the size of the scan itself.

     The "Save As..." command gives the user the option of saving the
scan in either:

     o     Screen Format (65 blocks long),
     o     Paint Format (compressed),
     o     Apple Preferred Format (compressed),
     o     Print Shop GS format (a non-standard format used
           only for
           that program),
     o     Hi-Res format (standard format used by Publish
           It!, among
           other programs), or
     o     Double Hi-Res Format.

     The software is very forgiving if the scan does not turn just out
the way you intended and you want to try again. Just discard the old
scan, and scan again.

     Uses for the Quickie are only limited by your imagination. True, the
scans are in greyscale, but they can be imported into and "colorized"
                                        with any paint program.  Line
     "USES FOR THE QUICKIE ARE          drawings, photographs and even
      ONLY LIMITED BY YOUR              paintings can become clip-art
      IMAGINATION."                     for your desktop publishing
                                        applications or "slides" for
your slide show presentations or even the bases for your own unique
computer art.

     In summary, the Quickie scanner is simple to install in any Apple
II, is nearly flawless in operation (with practice), and is a fast and
easy way to add clip-art, photographs, and artwork to all of your Apple
II applications.

Don't Touch That Keyboard!
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
By Larry Faust
    [L.FAUST2]



                   >>> DON'T TOUCH THAT KEYBOARD! <<<
                   """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

NEW LIFE FOR APPLE II   In my article about the Quickie hand-held
"""""""""""""""""""""   scanner, I sang praises about how it could
breathe new life into the Apple II. Well, folks, when the Quickie hand
scanner is used in conjunction with Westcode's InWords OCR (optical
character recognition) software, the Apple II not only gets new life
breathed into it, but actually allows Apple users to tap the raw power
that up until now was reserved for those, ahem, "sophisticated"
machines.  And it does so for a fraction of the cost!!

     Using InWords, virtually any printed information can be scanned and
imported into:

    o   a classic AppleWorks or Appleworks GS word processor document,
        spreadsheet, or database,

    o   a BeagleWrite GS (MultiScribe GS) document,

    o   a GraphicWriter III document, or

    o   a text file for inclusion into HyperStudio (and theoretically,
        HyperCard GS)

     A user should even be able to "scan in" a program listing that has
been published in a magazine, instead of typing it!

     This powerful program was written by our good friend, Alan Bird.
Mr.  Bird was responsible for a lot of the Beagle Bros AppleWorks
enhancements. In this program, he hasn't forgotten his roots. InWords
has the familiar AppleWorks filecard interface, and hence is extremely
simple to use. It comes on non copy-protected, bootable 5.25" and 3.5"
disks.

     The documentation is well-written and indexed. It even walks the
user through several OCR sample sessions.

     InWords presents the user with THREE different ways to scan printed
material:

    o   Standard scan- used when the column of text is narrower than the
        scanner's head,

    o   Merge scan- used when the column of text is wider than the
        scanner's head, as in a hardback book, and

    o   Column scan- used when the are two or more columns of text, as
        in a newspaper or magazine.

     InWords comes with an extensive standard font table plus specific
font tables for many popular magazines (I was gratified to see
A2-Central and NAUG as two of the specific fonts recognized).

     Once the Letter switch on the scanner is set and a resolution of
300 dpi (dots per inch) is selected, the user is all set to scan down
the page (portrait mode). Again, as when using the Quickie alone, there
is the option of audio feedback to monitor the speed of your scan.

     After the scan, and Return is pressed, then the magic takes over.
This is called the recognition process, and, yes, InWords actually
analyzes your scan, compares it to the font table that you've selected,
and quickly recognizes the text which it then deposits into an
AppleWorks-like editor for proof-reading and correction by the user. All
unrecognized characters are denoted by a user-definable character (the
manual suggests one such as " ~ " which can be easily detected by a
spell-checking program).

     Don't worry if InWords doesn't recognize some particular text
because it's in a unique font. If the "Font training" option is
selected, InWords will "step through" each of the scanned characters and
ask the user to tell the program what letter or number that the
character represents. As more characters are "defined", the process gets
faster.  The program gives the user the option of saving this
information in a font table which can be saved and used again.

     The user is given the choice of THREE methods of saving the
recognized text:

    o   as a straight text or ASCII file,

    o   as a text file with a <RETURN> placed after each line, or

    o   as an AppleWorks word processor file.

     What you intend to do with the recognized text afterwards should
govern how you save it to disk. For instance, if you want to import the
recognized text to a AppleWorks database, it is important to save it
with a <RETURN> after each line, as these will define the fields and
records.

     Version 1.0 of the program (released in mid January, 1991) is the
current version of InWords, and there are the inevitable but, in this
case, relatively minor "undocumented features" or peculiarities to deal
with. Four of the most egregious:

     1) if you have a RAMdisk set up as part of your system's
        configuration, InWords doesn't like anything to be on it,

     2) if the document you are trying to scan has any blank lines, such
        as signature lines, in it, InWords will not be able to
        recognize them and will crash,

     3) the program tends to take all available memory (it shares this
        peculiarity with Classic AppleWorks pre-version 3),

     4) InWords tends to confuse similar looking characters, such as "O"
        and "0", "l" and "1", and "S" and "5",

     5) InWords doesn't allow for landscape scanning (scanning across
        the page instead of straight down it), and

     6) Although InWords supports Quickie and other Apple II hand-held
        scanners, it doesn't support flatbed scanners.

     I have it on good authority that version 1.1, which should be
shipping to registered users and available for sale by the time you read
this, corrects ALL of these shortcomings, except landscape scanning an
the flatbed scanner support.

     Despite these peculiarities, InWords allows the Apple user to
become even more productive- productivity that, again, is only limited
by the imagination- unleashing yet another part of the Apple II's power
at a very reasonable cost.

                  >>> FLAT-RATE TELECOMMUNICATION <<<
                  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
      ~ A Landmark Event in the History of Human Communications ~


     Throughout the history of human communications, there has always
been a monetary fee associated with long distance communication.  From
the pony express to the U.S. mail to the telegraph to the telephone to
the fax, every long distance communication medium has charged a "per
unit" message fee.  The underlying rule has been that the more you
communicate, the more you pay.

     Enter flat-rate telecom.

     For the first time in the history of civilization, human beings are
offered the opportunity to communicate long distance at a flat-rate.

     The upshot of this is that the MORE you communicate, the LESS you
pay per message.

     Human beings are so accustomed to being charged "per-message" fees
for long distance communication that they fail to fully appreciate the
revolutionary nature of flat-rate telecom.  Homo sapiens are creatures
of habit, and the habit to keep long distance communication to a brief
minimum is one that is hard to break.

     But take a minute to think about this.

     The United States Postal Service charges you a communication fee by
     the ounce.

     Your long distance phone carrier charges you by the minute.

     Western Union charges you by the word, for telegrams.

     But GEnie charges you a flat-rate --- by the month --- for 
     unlimited usage.

     Not only that.

     Unlike other national information services, GEnie doesn't place a
cap on how many e-mail messages you can send per month.  At no time do
                                        you have to stop and consider,
     "AT NO TIME DO YOU HAVE TO         "Gee, I wonder if I've exceeded
      STOP AND CONSIDER, 'GEE, I        my 60 messages per month limit?
      WONDER IF IT IS WORTH MY          I wonder if it is worth my
      MY WHILE TO SEND THIS NEXT        while to send this next
      MESSAGE?'"                        message?"  GEnie also goes
                                        beyond other information
services by allowing lengthy text file uploads via GE Mail.  (While
GEnie does not explicitly state a size limit for text file uploads into
the GE Mail editor, a recent test upload of a 25K text file received no
complaints from the GE Mail editor.)  Other information services limit
text file uploads to 5K or less, per e-mail message.  This effectively
forces you to send larger files via other methods, rather than as
e-mail.

     As we enter the Information Age, anthropologists have come to
appreciate that communication lies at the very core of our social
structure.  It's no exaggeration to say that civilization as a whole
advances in direct proportion to the quantity and quality of
communication taking place.

     Businesses grow through communication.

     Children learn through communication.

     Social fabric is formed through communication between human beings.

     When the per-unit fee for long distance communication is kept to a
bare bones monthly minimum, society as a whole becomes the ultimate
beneficiary.

     When people freely exchange ideas, society as a whole moves
forward.

     The full significance of flat-rate telecom becomes apparent when
you consider it as a better bargain than even flat-rate local phone
service.  Just as nobody thinks twice about picking up the phone to call
a local friend, in time nobody will think twice about making the best
use of flat-rate telecom.

     True, e-mail does not offer the equivalent communication experience
as a real-time phone conversation.  But e-mail does offer two distinct
advantages over phone communication: 1) It is non-disruptive, and, 2) It
is easy to "publish" or "broadcast" a message by courtesy copying two,
four, eight, or twenty-eight other persons.

     Whatever advances in communication occur in the next 50 to 100
years, historians will look back on the early 1990's as being a pivotal
turning point in the history of human communications.  Those were the
first days that the human animal communicated long distance without
having to pay a per-message fee.

     You don't have to be Johann Gutenberg to realize the full
significance of this development.

     And the doorways it opens up.

              ~ The "Computer Keyboarding" Freeware Disk ~

     Every once in a while a program is uploaded to the Apple II Round-
Table library that has all the polish and refinement of a commercial
                                        software program.  Two months
     "EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A           ago Charles Hartley, a middle
      PROGRAM IS UPLOADED TO THE        school computer teacher from
      APPLE II ROUNDTABLE LIBRARY       Kentucky, uploaded a disk he
      THAT HAS ALL THE POLISH AND       made called "Computer
      REFINEMENT OF A COMMERCIAL        Keyboarding."  If you missed
      SOFTWARE PROGRAM."                seeing the freeware notice on
                                        the opening screen, you could
easily mistake this program for being a commercially produced product.

     Computer Keyboarding is a touch typing tutor that thoroughly and
carefully drills you on touch typing skills.  The program takes you
right from the beginning, even giving you a short lesson in proper body
posture and hand-positioning.  Beyond that, the program keeps careful
track of your progress, so that you can easily pick up where you last
left off.

     Best of all, Computer Keyboarding runs on any 64K Apple II, and
does not require an 80 column card.  (Presumably, therefore, it could be
used on a 64K Apple II+ or an unenhanced, 64K Apple IIe.)  Naturally, it
should also run fine on any Apple IIc, IIGS, IIc+, and Laser 128 series
computer.

     Before describing this program any further, let me quote from the
documentation that comes along with the disk, describing the author's
motivation for making it:

     "I wrote this program because I could not find a decent and afford-
able typing instruction program that taught typing the way I thought it
should be taught.  This program is unique in that it puts greater
emphasis on accuracy, not speed.  Other programs that I have seen or
used seem to have a fixation with speed.  The program is highly
structured in the sense that users must attain a degree of mastery with
one set of keys before they proceed with the next set.  At the same time
there is a degree of flexibility built into it.  Users who have
difficulty with a set of lines are presented with the same set again
and/or are presented additional lines to type.  Also, users have the
opportunity to practice lessons a second time voluntarily if they wish."

     When I took this program out for a test drive I was happy to see
that the author included three cute little typing games.  But the only
way to get to these games is to progress methodically through the
lessons.

     Should you wish to download and use this program, here are some
tips and suggestions:
     
     The name of the shrunk file is: "Typing.Inst.BXY".   You can down-
load it to either a 5.25 or 3.5 inch disk.  The program itself is quite
large, and therefore needs to be unpacked to two 5.25 or one 3.5 inch
disk.

     Instructions for unpacking to two 5.25 inch disks is contained in
the AppleWorks file titled: "Read.Me.First".  First you format the two
5.25 disks using the given volume names.  Then you can unpack the shrunk
files to the two disks by following the given directions.

     As with most downloadable programs, the final step is to copy
ProDOS and BASIC.SYSTEM onto your bootup disk.  But before you boot this
disk, WAIT!   Make a backup copy first.  Put the original aside.
Because after you register your name to the disk, the disk will not
allow someone else to register under a different name.

     The whole idea is that each person gets their own typing disk,
where the program keeps careful track of your progress.  Since the
software is freeware, there is no reason why you can't easily make ten,
twenty, or as many copies of the disk as you need.  But if you register
your name on the disk before making the copy, you'll have to go through
the whole unshrinking procedure to produce a virgin "unregistered" disk.

     One final note: the documentation in the "Read.Me.First" file is
contained in an AppleWorks 3.0 word processing file.  Even if you don't
own AppleWorks 3.0, you can still display this file on your screen by
using the "Type" command on ShrinkIt.  You may want to take some written
notes if you plan on unshrinking the file to two 5.25 inch floppies.

     If you're an adult who is still doing the "hunt-and-peck" routine,
now you have no excuse for not learning to type with ten fingers.  If
you know of any teenagers who have some spare time this coming summer,
learning to type with Computer Keyboarding could be one of the best uses
they could make of their free time.

     Charles Hartley, the talented programmer who made Computer Key-
boarding, invested months of work in producing this disk.  The fact that
he is willing to share this program as freeware is a testament to his
generous and caring spirit.  We are fortunate to have such a creative,
sharing soul as an active members of the GEnie Apple II community.

                  >>> A USER'S REVIEW OF POINTLESS <<<
                  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
                        ~ by WestCode Software ~

     I'll try to hold the Pointless jokes to a minimum.  TrueType for
the Apple IIGS is the name of the game here, and Pointless is an
excellent rendition of it.

     This program begs for your abuse. You can store fonts in any online
drive, load and unload available fonts from the control panel, and read
Macintosh TrueType fonts directly from a Mac formatted disk.  (Reading
Mac disks will be allowed with the arrival of GS/OS 6.00)

     Alan Bird knew what we needed, and gave it to us in spades.
Pointless works invisibly, on screen and out the printer.  In short,
this is good stuff:

     1) Smaller system size for those with a lot of font sizes -- a
        TrueType font family can be a lot smaller than the bit mapped
        equivalent; bitmapped Courier font in 8 sizes
        (9,10,12,14,18,20,24,28) takes 61K and prints jagged characters
        in the larger point sizes. Courier bold adds another 63K for a
        124K total.

     If you use a printer driver that reduces larger point sizes for
higher quality (The Imagewriter II uses 2 times the screen font,
Imagewriter LQ uses 3 times the screen font, Deskjet uses 4 times the
screen font) you'll have used a lot of disk space for fonts.

     TrueType Courier, with bold , takes 113K, and prints smoothly at
all sizes.  And the TrueType fonts will load from any online disk -- not
just the boot volume.

     2) Better print for most printers -- Pointless generates the
        correct size when asked by your printer driver, so you
        always have that larger font size to reduce for smoother
        print.

     3) Better screen print -- I haven't noticed THAT much
        difference on the screen, except I can now read the font used in
        the AWGS communications module. The online talk is that many
        people do notice

     4) The manual is quite good.

     5) It's from WestCode, home of Inwords digital scanning
        software.  These guys deserve our support!


Bad Stuff!
""""""""""

     1) Eats system RAM if you are not careful -- Generating fonts is so
        painless, you will not notice them piling up.  At 4 megs I can
        play pretty hard.  But with five or six fonts in three sizes on
        the screen, I better not try to print.  Pointless will generate
        bit maps for each of font and point size that are 4 times the
        screen size when Harmonie asks it to. I will run out of memory.

     I had the same problem before, with the bitmapped fonts, but
Pointless is so much fun, it happens more often.

     2) Time for font generation may be a factor -- With a ZipGS 10 mhz,
        64K cache, font generation time is always less than 5 seconds.
        But I am impatient, so I load some bit mapped fonts.

     3) Genie bills will go up -- As you download more fonts (the cost of
        improvement) or you brag about the improved output, or some
        obscure font.  All in all, It's Pointless to use TruType fonts on
        the GS!


So What?
""""""""

     1) You need this program if you have Harmonie or Independence, and a
        high quality printer.

     2) LaserWriters are a special problem, and this won't help.  You
        don't need this if you have a "basic" system, unless you like to
        play with fonts.

Note: If you use a Mac, Metamorphisis will convert most any PostScript
      type1 font to TrueType, then use Stuffit (not Deluxe) and transfer
      to a Prodos disk with APFE, unShrinkit it with the GS, and you have
      a new font for your GS.

Alliance International On GEnie
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""




ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL ON GEnie   New on the marketing side of the
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Apple II world is the Alliance
International Inc.  In its simplest form, the AII is a national Apple II
user group, determined to bring the lonely Apple II user into the
interactive Apple II community.

     But AII plans on doing much more.  The following two posts can be
found in AII's new topic, Category 5, Topic 7.  The first explains the
formation of AII and the groups goals.  The second tells about AII's
current status.


         >>> WHAT IS THE ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL INC. (AII)? <<<
         """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The Alliance came about as a result of discussions between a group
of Apple II developers, users and Apple engineers on America Online's
"Across The Boards" area.  One of the developers/users involved in those
discussions, John Majka, of Louisville, KY, decided to form a "support
group" for the Apple II based on the premise that since Apple Computer,
Inc. apparently is not going to support Apple II owners, Apple II owners
should get together and support each other.

     In late 1991, AII was incorporated in the state of Kentucky.  It is
currently a "for-profit" corporation because a "non-profit" company is
somewhat more complicated to set up and there are complex state and
federal laws about tracking donations, costs, reporting, etc.  So it is
simpler and cheaper to go "for-profit", at least for a while.

     The mission of The Alliance is to promote and advance the use of
the Apple II computer in home, business, education and other markets.

     We intend to accomplish that mission by...

     1. Notifying Apple II users through national media (newspapers,
        radio, TV) that they can get support for their computer from The
        Alliance.

     2. Providing an "800" support number.

     3. Offering a subscription to a quarterly publication which lists
        available Apple II software, hardware and services and where to
        purchase it or find it.

     4. Encouraging existing developers of Apple II software to continue
        development.

     5. Encouraging developers of software for other computers (Borland,
        Aston-Tate, Lotus, etc.) for home and small businesses to develop
        software for the Apple II.

     6. Talking to, lobbying, pressuring Apple Computer, Inc. to devote
        more resources to the Apple II line.

     In order to accomplish these goals we are asking individuals and
Users Groups to become members of the Alliance.  The dues for
individuals are $20 and for Users Groups, $50.

     Your membership will tell us that  YOU  want the Apple II to live
and grow. It will tells us, and the developers that you want more
software and hardware.  It will tell us if we are right or if Apple
Computer, Inc. is right, that Apple II users don't care, and that we are
just whistling in the grave yard of the Apple II.  It will let us know
if we are wasting our time, efforts and money or not.

     If you decide to support us in supporting the Apple II, please send
your $20 or $50 check and any ideas and suggestions you may have to:

MORE ALLIANCE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 16, 1992
"""""""""""""
THE ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL INC. REACHES INITIAL MEMBERSHIP TARGET, WILL
BEGIN APPLE II PROMOTIONS

     The Alliance International Incorporated announced today that it has
reached its initial target of 150 paid members.  Alliance officials say
this early success means that The AII will soon be able to begin
actively promoting the Apple II computer through advertisements in
national magazines or newspapers.

     The ads will be aimed at current Apple II owners who do not belong
to a local users' group or subscribe to Apple II publications.  The
advertising campaign also will target new computer buyers with the
message that an Apple II computer is still an excellent buy in the
current computer market.

     The Alliance, incorporated in October, 1991, is an organization of
Apple II users and software developers who want to promote the Apple II
computer.  Although such promotional activity would normally be done by
the computer's manufacturer, Apple Computer Inc.'s marketing efforts
have been focused almost exclusively on its Macintosh line of computers
in recent years, resulting in a significant decline in consumer
awareness of the Apple II.  The Alliance is not affiliated in any way
with Apple Computer Inc.

     In January, 1992, The Alliance's board of directors had established
a minimum target of acquiring 150 dues-paying members ($20 per year for
individual memberships, $50 for user group membership) by April 1, 1992.
The board believed that achieving this goal would show that there is
sufficient user support for the goals of The Alliance. The fact that the
goal was reached two weeks ahead of schedule is especially encouraging.

     As support for the Alliance continues to grow, convincing software
developers to stay with the Apple II and to create new products for it
should become easier.

     Another goal of The Alliance is to provide greater support for
current Apple II owners by increasing the number of programs available
for the computer.  The AII intends to accomplish this goal by
encouraging current Apple II software developers to write new programs
and by persuading IBM PC and Macintosh software developers to "port" or
re-write current applications to run on the Apple IIe and Apple IIGS.

     "If Lotus 1-2-3 could run on a 40 kilobyte IBM PC, then it could
easily run on a 1 megabyte Apple IIe," said John Majka, secretary of The
Alliance.  "And there is a great deal of similarity between the
operating system and tools of the Macintosh computer and the Apple IIGS
computer.  If a program runs well on a Macintosh, re-writing it for the
Apple IIGS would be very simple.  By opening up the Apple II market,
software developers could increase their sales and profits."


APPLE ALLIANCE THOUGHTS   Allow me to post my own thoughts on the
"""""""""""""""""""""""   Alliance and its goals.  I speak here as a
member of the Alliance (I sent my $20 check last week), a friend of John
Majka's (he's in my local Apple users' group) and a longtime and
still-committed Apple II user.  I opened this topic because John asked
me -- and I agreed -- to serve as the unofficial GEnie representative
for AII.

     I support the Alliance for the same reasons that I supported an
effort that began more than a year ago here on GEnie.  For those of you
who followed that discussion, there was an attempt to accumulate enough
money to place an Apple II ad (or series of ads) in inCider or some
other national publication.  As I recall, nearly 100 GEnie subscribers
pledged money to the cause, but in the end the person who had agreed to
lead the effort abandoned it for lack of time.

     It was evident then that any such effort would engender, at the
least, a fair amount of dissension.  Everyone seemed to have his or her
own idea about what the ad should say and where it should be placed and
why we should adopt one strategy over another.

     The Alliance undoubtedly will face the same problems.  Lots of us
would like to support the Apple II in some way or another, but we want
to do it OUR way.  We would all love to see Apple Inc. step up and
actually try to persuade people to BUY the computer they make (and
software developers to write programs for it), but we also all know that
that just isn't going to happen.

     So what are our choices?  We can gripe a lot at users group
meetings or in BBS messages; we can send poison pen letters to John
Sculley, or we can join the Alliance and try to pool our resources to
create an effective, organized voice of support for the Apple II.

     The Alliance may not be the organization that YOU would have
created, or you may not agree with all of its goals or strategies, but
it is the ONLY group I know of that is actively working to create a
national (indeed, international) coalition to support and promote the
Apple II.  Its long-term goals include advertising the Apple II in
national magazines and newspapers, encouraging developers to write or
port software for the Apple II and, in general, increasing consumer
awareness of the Apple II.

     If you agree with these goals (and especially if you were willing
to pledge to the earlier effort here on GEnie) I hope you will support
the Alliance by sending your $20 membership fee to the address listed in
previous messages in this topic.

     If you have ideas, suggestions, comments for AII, or disagreements
or whatever, please post them here (or send me e-mail) and I will pass
them on to John and the other Alliance directors. --Dan  (via TCXpress)

ALLIANCE RESPONDS   (D.CRUTCHER: John Majka asked me to post the
"""""""""""""""""   following response to previous messages in this
topic:  First, all comments and criticisms and advice are well taken.
Some of us have said many of the same things.  We are NOT thin-skinned.
If you don't agree, fire away!  We don't claim to know everything nor
have a corner on the good idea market.

The Stamp   Well, its worth a shot!  The worse they can do is say "No"
"""""""""   and we're no worse off than before.  If we get it, it's
great publicity for a great computer.

Support   One of the biggest, if not the biggest gripes I've heard from
"""""""   users is that there isn't enough software for the Apple II.
We aim to change that.

     The Alliance is trying to support existing Apple II users!  One way
is that we're encouraging current Apple II developers, publishers, etc.
to stay with the Apple II or, if they've left, to come back.  Another
way is that we are going to try to get Mac & MS-DOS software people into
the Apple II market.  Both mean more products and support for the Apple
II and it's users.

Marketing   The Apple II is a great computer but the world doesn't know
"""""""""   about it.  It's time it did!  That's why we're trying to
advertise it.  Then, maybe, people will stop saying that the II is
technologically obsolete or a kid's toy and say nice things about it.
That will encourage Apple II users and developers.  It may also bring in
new computer sales.  Remember that Apple said that they would support
the II as long as people wanted to buy it.  If new users aren't buying,
Apple will drop it.  So new sales are as important as existing users.

     We will NOT be advertising in Apple II publications.  That's
preaching to the choir!  That's also the responsibility of companies
that make and sell Apple II stuff.  If we're selling anything, it's the
computer and the Apple II Dream that seems to have died at Apple
Computer Inc.  Just a few of the mags we're putting ads in are National
Review, New Woman, Sports Afield, Inc. Magazine and Nation's Business.

     Our ads will start out small but as The Alliance grows, so will the
ads and our effectiveness.

     We probably won't be advertising in other computer mags either.
That's preaching to the devil!  The readers already have their computer
and are not about to toss it out.  (Although, an IBM PC clone user here
in Louisville recently got his hands on a IIGS.  His PC clone is now for
sale.  Any offers?)

Coming out of the closet   As for pulling the Apple II out of the
""""""""""""""""""""""""   closet, if that's what they have, then we'll
encourage them to do so.  In addition to my IIGS, I still have and use a
II+!  It's even connected to my HP LaserJet IIP.  The Alliance has also
received letters with membership checks from a number of Apple II+
owners.  One was a lawyer who still uses Applewriter and is very happy.
If the user is happy and it meets his needs, fine and dandy.  If not,
maybe we can convince him to upgrade to an Apple IIGS instead of a
clone.

Education   We've not forgotten the educational wing even though most
"""""""""   software and hardware sales are not to educational
institutions.  (A recent, non-scientific survey of a few Apple II
developers showed that less than 5% of their sales went to the education
market.)  One of our members is writing up his experiences in helping a
local school make their Apple IIs more effective.  When finished, we
plan on giving it to educational computing magazines and member user
groups as an article or series of articles depending on the length.
Another member already has written a couple of books on the subject and
is writing another.  We are going to see if we can sell them.

T-Shirt   Thanks to A2 Sysops for putting The AII on your mailing list.
"""""""   We appreciate it and especially appreciate the article
mentioning The Alliance.

     If the topic of my article was not suitable, well, I can't be
perfect all the time and can't please everybody.  But if it was my
writing style, let me know and I'll change or get somebody to do it
better.  Of course, you're free to edit it too.

     The T-Shirt was done before but it might be worthwhile to do again.
My idea is a picture of an Apple II on the front of the T-shirt with the
words "One more time: This is your brain."  On the back, a picture of an
MS-DOS computer with the words, "This is your brain on drugs. Any
questions?"  We could sell the T-shirt and use the funds for additional
activities.  One person wrote in and suggested jewelry like a tie tack
or pin.

     Good idea though, contests are always good at generating publicity.
That's why radio stations use them so much.

     Let's get these ads rolling first.  If you're in the business of
supporting the Apple II, expect to be getting a letter in the next week
to 10 days.  If you haven't received it by April, 15th (TAX DAY), let us
know.  We're going to need something to send to the people who respond
to our ads.  We think brochures of Apple II software & hardware are
perfect to let them know that the II hasn't been abandoned!

     We've been up to our eye balls with processing new memberships,
getting advertising info, developing the ads, figuring out where to put
them, getting developers & publishers & others involved and getting info
for the National Apple II Day at the Mall and answering questions.  Then
there's KansasFest and Boston Applefest coming up.

     Once this stuff is out of the way, we can concentrate on other
things.

Joining   I can understand reluctance to join on the part of Apple II
"""""""   users.  One fellow sent in a membership check and said that
he'd put an article about The AII in his user group newsletter if we
were still around in 30 days.  There have been a number of ad hoc
campaigns that just petered out.  I assure you that this one won't!  We
know that we have to prove it to you and we will!  Besides, have I ever
lied to you before? :)

     We've been officially around since October 22, 1991, the
incorporation date.  That's more than 30 days right there!  It's taken a
while for word to spread and get stuff in the Apple II magazines because
of publishing schedules.  But we're in here for the long haul.

     I'm of 100% Polish blood.  There seems to be something about Poles
that doesn't let them give up.  Face it, any country whose national
anthem begins "Poland isn't lost while we are still alive..." is going
to produce fighters.  As far as The AII is concerned, "The Apple II
isn't lost while we are still alive."

     We may still lose the fight but there will be a fight!
