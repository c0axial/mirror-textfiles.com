Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""

    [EDITOR.A2]



                    >>> MUCH TOO LATE FOR GOODBYES <<<
                    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Last month, ICON (formerly Resource Central) produced its final issue 
of A2-Central (formerly Open-Apple).  I was its editor.

     When I was interviewed for GEnieLamp A2 last month, I didn't know 
A2-Central was on its last legs.  I didn't even know the issue of 
A2-Central I was working on would be the last ever.  I didn't get a chance 
to say goodbye.  I can't say goodbye here and now, because many A2-Central 
readers lives in countries GEnie doesn't reach.

     I don't suppose it matters much.  There isn't much to say.  I would 
have liked to have told all those who stuck with A2-Central even after it 
dropped its paper version--and even all those who cancelled then--about its 
spiritual successor, Shareware Solutions II.  Even though there wasn't much 
to say, I wish someone had had the chance to say it.  No one should be put 
into the ground with too few words.

     A2-Central began its life in 1985 as an one-man, eight-page 
newsletter.  That one man was Tom Weishaar, and that newsletter was 
Open-Apple.  In 1989, Open-Apple metamorphosed into A2-Central to avoid the 
wrath of Cupertino, and that change brought with it A2-Central-On-Disk.  In 
1993, the paper version of A2-Central disappeared, and A2-Central-On-Disk 
dropped the "-On-Disk" from its name, since the newsletter was available in 
disk format only.

     At the start of 1994, I started writing for A2-Central.  By the 
middle of the same year, I had been appointed editor.  I was the sixth 
person to edit the newsletter with Uncle DOS, after Tom Weishaar (accept no 
substitutes), Dennis Doms (whose Internet series began in the final issue), 
Jay Jennings (for one issue only), Ellen Rosenberg (last editor of a paper 
version), and Dean Esmay (who had edited A2-Central-On-Disk since 1989).

     Now it's gone.  The little newsletter that was printed in 
"teeny-weeny-eyestrain-o-vision" (a phrase invented by Matt Groening for 
his _Life in Hell_ comic strip) on paper not much thicker than onionskin.  
The little newsletter that spawned a mail order company.  The little 
newsletter that spawned a dozen other disk magazines.  The little 
newsletter that many absent-mindedly referred to as a magazine.

     Happily, we are not gone.  Tom Weishaar has not passed to the Great 
Beyond, and the other editors--including myself, thank you--seem to be 
pretty hale and hearty.  More happily, you are not gone.  You're still out 
there, eager to find solutions with your Apple IIs, and still getting to 
know these great computers.  Even more happily, the Apple II is not gone.  
It's been 18 years since they first made one, and two years since they last 
made one, and the computer still is not gone.

     As those of us who loved Open-Apple in its various forms remember, it 
was ten years ago when Tom Weishaar open the first editorial of his 
newsletter with the sentence, "My banker says I'm crazy to start a 
newsletter about an eight-year old computer."

     You weren't crazy, Tom.  At least, you weren't any crazier than the 
thousands who subscribed over the years.

     Open-Apple (A2-Central).  1985-1995.  R.I.P.

GRAPHICS CONVERSION WITH PRISM   All's well that ends well?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     You decide...

     A few weeks ago, I posted a message about my recent experience with 
purchasing the graphics conversion program - Prism - from Other World 
Computing.

     All told, it took 6 weeks from the time I placed my phone call until 
Prism arrived. During those 6 weeks, it was a comedy of errors. I must have 
placed 10 phone calls to the 800 toll free number, and the witches' brew of 
excuses I heard were the most absurd I've ever heard in my life.

     The thing of it is...Prism is an excellent program that does a 
superior job in converting graphics. It's just too bad that it is not 
available from anyone other than Other World Computing. Dealing with them 
was nothing but toil and trouble.

MORE GRAPHICS CONVERSION   I'm a bit of a cross platform graphics 'nut' and
""""""""""""""""""""""""   I wannna tell you that, as much as I like 
Show.me's capabilities, I've had no success in saving or converting GIF's 
of more than 15 colors or 3200 color graphics of any kind at all.  My 
hardware is a ROM 3 GS, Appletalk in slot 1 (I've tried it without it, 
too), RamFast w/256k, 85 meg Quantum HD, 4 Meg CV tech Ram card, a 
Superdrive, 3 Unidisks and a 5.25 --and a 8MHz 16k Zip.

     I highly recommend Tim Meekins' ImageQuant (very alpha, but in the A2 
library) for those who are serious in the saving and editting of graphics 
on the II GS.  It is actually the second best (commercial programs 
included) universal converter of graphics that I have ever seen.  The best 
graphic converter program for the GS has not yet been released because of 
GS/OS conflicts but is the only program that I know of that can convert 
Aldus SuperPaint Documents from the MacIntosh to the IIGS.

     Look for TGM (Tim's Graphic Mangler) in late 1995.  Perhaps sooner if 
I get over this habit of being stupid :)

AMERICA ONLINE E-MAIL   There is something very very wrong with the America 
"""""""""""""""""""""   Online Internet e-mail gateway.

     I read in my local newspaper about problems that thousands of people 
are reporting when sending Internet e-mail to AOL addresses, and have 
actually tried a few experiments.

     I've sent e-mail to AOL that got cut off mid-sentence. I've sent 
e-mail to my former AOL address which was canceled on 11/1/94, and the 
e-mail never bounced. I've sent e-mail to non-existent AOL addresses which 
have taken 4 or 5 days to "bounce."

     In short, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.

SAY IT LOUD   As Public Relations Manager here I could use a little bit of 
"""""""""""   help from all of you..

     I am finding that when I make contacts with vendors, many of them 
don't realize how much of their business is generated by Apple II using 
customers, and even fewer realize that GEnie A2 is the center of the Apple 
II universe :)

     What I'm asking you to do is:
          When you order a computer product for your Apple II, tell the 
     sales person that's what it's for, and that it will work on Apple II's 
     :)
          [of course it's a good idea to tell them this after they've take 
     your order]...

     If you are ordering from a business you've seen recommended here in 
A2, be sure to tell them that the reason you are ordering from them is that 
they were recommend in the Apple II RoundTable on GEnie..  We may be able 
to encourage some vendors to acknowledge that they have Apple II products 
that they didn't even know they had :)

SHANGHAI TILES AND HIERARCHIC   I too have found that Hierachic causes 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   problems with other programs - for 
instance, just recently when playing Shanghai I could not remove some of 
the tiles which were actually free.   

     Initially, I couldn't fathom out what the problem was, but after a 
process of elimination I found that with Hierarchic installed the problem 
was present, without it all was well.   Just to confirm it was no 
coincidence, I reinstalled/removed Hierarchic and rebooted several times - 
with the same results.

Resource Manager.

     Second, this problem is our top priority.  We expect to have a fix by 
Friday, 17 Feb. 1995.

>>>>>   Well, I received Faxination today.  I too am a bit disappointed in
"""""   my initial results.  Setup was pretty easy, using Shadowwrite to 
enter a simple test message went smoothly and the Fax/printer driver works 
as in the manual.  However, when done creating the fax document nothing 
happens as I would expect it, but no lock up.  Going into the NDA and the 
Send Fax log section shows the document and accessing it works OK.  Viewing 
the fax document works well also.  But sending the fax is impossible.  When 
trying to get the fax sent the program accesses my modem, (a Supra Faxmodem 
14.4 V.32/42/mnp2-5, the one with the special alpha numeric LED matrix 
display, using the hardware handshaking cable from Intrec), the program 
sends an error message saying that it is unable to initialize the modem, 
retrying ends with the same result.   Canceling this causes the computer to 
lock up requiring a reboot.  The P8 crash is definitely a problem.  Trying 
to place the program into receive results with the same error message and 
lockup.  I can see that the program is attempting to send commands to my 
modem, the data lights are working and the modem is apparently responding, 
the LEDs display OK and the modem works fine afterwards with Proterm 3.1.

     I have tried setting different things in the control panel, DC 
printer and modem panel, nothing changes at all.

     At this time, I've worked with the program for several hours and 
since I am constantly forced to reboot the computer I have had no choice 
but to remove the program from my system.  I noticed that there might be a 
problem with corrupted disks and did a verify disk and validate files with 
no errors.

     At this stage I am VERY disappointed, and will be waiting for initial 
bug fixed from Vitesse which I hope will be coming VERY soon!

     Three things to remember:

     1.  The alternative was no program.

you who have not returned your programs in disgust! :)

     Many of the problems seem to have come from my attempt to generate a 
"universal" init procedure, which now works most of the time. Perhaps it is 
time for me to give up and just ask for an init string from the user, even 
though the object of the game is to NOT require you to go searching through 
your modem manuals for the correct command sequence!

     Other problems arise from the BBS itself. The board uses the Metal 
BBS program, a public domain Apple II BBS system. It may take a bit of 
gettng used to, but is really quite simple once you understand where you 
need to go. Just follow the menus, and when in doubt hit the ? key, and you 
should be alright. Most of you have predefined user accounts, which you can 
find and customize by entering your invoice number when the system asks for 
your name or handle. If that doesn't work, follow the instructions for 
applying for a NEW account, and I will validate you within a day. I check 
for new applications once or twice daily, when I have time. (usually late 
at night. :)

     When logging on to the Vitesse, Inc. BBS, the System News will be 
used to advertise when a new copy of FAXination becomes available. As 
requested, I will also post a message here to let GEnie users know about 
it, too.

     We are now testing a copy which appears to handle sending and 
receiving pretty well, and has had its init procedure upgraded to  
accommodate more modems. I am also correcting the AWGS printing bug, which 
will probably take another day. As soon as these changes are checked out, 
we will be releasing them.

     Thanks again for your patience, and your comments. And please bear 
with me, I'm making mistakes as fast as I can! :)

SPECTRUM 2.0 PREFS CONVERT BUG STOMPED   EVERYONE -- Ewen has found the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   problem with Prefs.Convert. 
Depending upon the particular conversion route (what errors may have 
occured, etc.) it was possible for the Prefs.Convert program to close _all_ 
resource files, instead of just the ones it had opened. This causes the 
system to crash as soon as anyone needs access to a resource (typically the 
very next screen update)!

     The good news is if this crash occurs, the converted 
"Spectrum2.Prefs" file will already be complete, except for any previous 
passwords. So, if a crash does occur while using Prefs.Convert, just 
restart the computer, then double- click the "Install" icon to finish off 
the installation.

     NOTE: This discovery means I do NOT need any old "Spectrum.Prefs" 
files to examine, so don't bother xmailing if you haven't yet.

Thanks, --Dave

APPLEWORKS 5 DB AUTO-SORT CRASH   Anybody else having crashes that seem to 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   be related to either auto-sorting or 
category totals in the data base?  Sometimes into the monitor.

     My problem has not been consistent, might be tied in with the print

for what I just said.

LAST ISSUES OF A2-CENTRAL, TIMEOUT-CENTRAL, SCRIPT-CENTRAL, STUDIO CITY
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In the beginning was the end   We are on the bank of the river now, drying 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   off, exhausted, but alive.  After months of 
swimming upstream, this month we quit.

     When I set up ICON a year ago, I felt it would guarantee Resource 
Central's publications a long future.  ICON had not only the monthly income 
from renewals of our longstanding Apple II publications, it also had new 
Macintosh and Windows publications coming on stream that would generate new 
members, new subscriptions, and eventually, more renewals.

     Unfortunately, my dream has turned into a nightmare.  Projections for 
1995 show ICON's expenses would have been about $210,000, while income 
would have been only $140,000, a shortfall of 50 percent.  Worse, even the 
low-cost guerrilla marketing efforts we've been doing for Macrocosm, Solid 
Windows, Config.sys, and our other publications have been costing more than 
they've brought in, so there's no salvation there.

     We also operated at a significant loss during 1994.  We were able to 
cover our expenses by selling off many of our assets, such as our retail 
inventory and some of our office furniture and computer equipment.  But the 
bottom line is that we ran out of money in January.

     As our remaining assets sell, we will have the cash to pay what we 
owe to our editors and contributors.  However, we don't have the cash to 
pay back what we owe to our members for unfulfilled subscriptions, which is 
by far the biggest liability we have.  Since we simply don't have the money 
to pay you back, we've made arrangements for you to get an equivalent 
number of issues of similar computer publications from another publisher.

     If you were a subscriber to the Macintosh version of Studio City, 
your subscription has been converted into a subscription to the HyperStudio 
Journal, a new publication created by Studio City's editor, Bill Lynn.  You 
will receive your first issue with a week or two.

     If you were a subscriber to any of our other publications, about 
March 1 you'll get a letter from The Cobb Group, a computer newsletter 
company owned by Ziff-Davis, that describes a selection of their 
publications.  The letter will include a card with a label that has your 
name and address, the ICON publication you subscribed to, and how many 
issues were left on your subscription.  If you subscribed to more than one 
of our publications, you'll get a separate letter for each one.  All you 
have to do is select which of The Cobb Group's publications you'd like to 
receive and return the card to them.

     The selection includes a variety of Macintosh, DOS, and Windows 
publications.  Most of them are paper newsletters, but there are also some 
disk publications.

On a personal note...   While it's painful to see Resource Central and ICON 
'''''''''''''''''''''   disintegrate like this, your support and loyalty 
gave me and those who worked with me over the last ten years great careers.  
We want to thank you for that.  Those of you who are left are the loyalest 
and bestest.

     I am now editing two of The Cobb Group's publications.  They are 
Quick$ense, which is for Quicken users, and $imply$ecure, which is for 
Kiplinger's Simply Money users.  Both of these are on the list of Cobb 
Group publications you can subscribe to.  Our editors and staff are all 
moving on to a variety of new adventures.  Thanks for accompanying us on 
this one.

NEW VENDORS   Two new vendors to consider. I have NOT dealt with them, but 
"""""""""""   got this information from AOL. Both are current info. Blue 
Sky deals with several Apple II peripherals and cards, And Aurora has a new

          External SCSI Case w/Power Supply  = $64.95
          Sequential Systems RAM GS 4MB card  = $159.95

     Now as for Hard Drives, small SCSI drives in the 20-100 Range are 
becoming very hard to acquire.  And if they can be fcound they are usually 
very expensive.  So let me know the size drive you were looking into and 
also about how much you wanted to spend on one, and I will get back to you.

     Press Release of New Products - HD and HD Ultra drives

     Carrollton, TX (July 1, 1994) Advanced Logic Integration, Inc is 
proud to announce the release of the two 3.5" drive models for the 
Macintosh and Apple II computer. The HD and the HD Ultra drives. These high 
quality drives use the latest surface mount technology and quality Sony(tm) 
drive mechanisms. Exclusive to the ALI drives, is a green/red light 
indicating read/write activities.

     The HD drive works as an 400K, 800K and 1.44Mb on properly equipped 
Mac and Apple II computers. Fully SuperDrive compatible on SuperDrive 
equipped Macs. What makes this drive unique is its ability to be used 
externally on the new Quadra and Centris Macintosh computers (which don't 
have external drive ports). ALI has designed a special adapter kit which 
allows these single drive Macs to use a second drive. Now, you can use 
these Macs for two disk backup programs, disk-to-disk copies and disk 
installation without having to swap disks. The HD drive retails for $249. 
The Quadra Adapter Kit is $49.

     The HD Ultra is an amazing drive that allows 1.44MB Mac and DOS disks 
to be recognized on a Macintosh that is only able to recognize 800K 
floppies. The HD Ultra attached to a Mac 512Ke, Plus, SE, Classic, or Mac 
II will recognize Mac 400K, 800K and 1.44MB disks. This is accomplished by 
the processor in the HD Ultra drive and the Ultra INIT  loaded in the 
System Folder. Additionally, 720K and 1.44Mb DOS disks can be recognized by 
using Apple's File Exchange or PC Exchange utilities. The HD Ultra drive 
works without software as a 400K,  800K and 1.44Mb on properly equipped Mac 
and Apple II computers. It is fully compatible with Apple's SuperDrive. The 
HD Ultra drive retails for $339.

     The drives are the Mac "platinum" color and same footprint as Apple's 
SuperDrive. All are constructed of high quality materials, pass strict 
quality control procedures and packed with all necessary materials.

shift-booting loads EVERYTHING and regular booting uses your Shifty List

     Mr. Smith, Please don't sell all of your computer stuff.  Here's what 
happened to me the other day:  I'm totally blind I live alone and don't 
have much sighted help.  My hard drive, accidently, got initicialized.  All 
of my talk files and data files were gone. I knew that as long as my 
controler card was inside the computer, My computer wouldn't startup 
because there wasn't any data on the hard drive.  So, I turned off the 
machine, took out the disk controler card for my hard drive, and inserted a 
5.25 talking disk.  Well, thanks to God, my machine started.  Then i 
reformatted my hard drive and have been really careful every since.  If I 
can be of any help to you folks, let me know.

Thanks so much,

there are computer programs that will help you form anagrams.  The trouble 
with these programs is that they make it easy to form bad or clumsy 
anagrams, such as "lick harbour gate fort" for "the rock of Gibraltar".  
Anyone who looks up from their laptop to announce such an anagram may 
safely be met with a cry of "Who cares?"

     A good anagram is one that acknowledges the context of the original 
phrase, and avoids cheats such as phrases beginning "O," to use up a 
leftover O, ("mosquitoes" <=> "O, Moses! Quit") and clumsy constructions.  
Here are twenty anagrams of the more artful sort:

                      desperation <=> a rope ends it

     Ivanhoe, by Sir Walter Scott <=> a novel by a Scottish writer

                     conservative <=> not vice versa

                   a divorce suit <=> I advise court

                     eleven + two <=> twelve + one

                       the answer <=> wasn't here

                Saint Elmo's fire <=> is lit for seamen

                         the eyes <=> they see

                        orchestra <=> a cart horse

                       atom bombs <=> a mob's tomb

                    talcum powder <=> world cup team

                     schoolmaster <=> the classroom

                       endearment <=> tender name

                    Western Union <=> no wire unsent

                    Is pity love? <=> Absolutely!

          circumstantial evidence <=> can ruin a selected victim

                        noiseless <=> lionesses

                    no admittance <=> contaminated

                          one hug <=> enough

      a stitch in time saves nine <=> this is meant as incentive

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

           >>> FORGING NEW LINKS BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND HOME <<<
           """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Education, by its very nature, is a collaborative enterprise.  
Schools cannot succeed unless children have a supportive home environment.  
Many families cannot raise their children without a supportive school 
environment.

     Considering how vital education is to society's well-being, you would 
think that teachers and parents would be engaging in regular 
communications.  The truth is that neither parents nor teachers have time 
to phone one another regularly.  To be sure, written notes are carried by 
students back and forth between home and school, but these notes hardly 
establish the type of ongoing dialogue that makes parents and teachers well 
connected with each other.

     Enter electronic mail.  The nature of the technology makes it 
exceedingly easy to maintain an ongoing dialogue.  The reply to one message 
invites a response of its own.  Pretty soon parents and teachers can 
actually get to know each other.

     What can happen when parents and teachers communicate?  A lot.  
Parents can keep closely informed about what's happening in the classroom, 
allowing them to create parallel learning opportunities outside of the 
classroom.  Likewise, teachers can keep closely informed about happenings 
at the child's home, allowing them to make appropriate adjustments for 
events in the child's life.

     Teachers can stay clued in to when a child's pet dies, to when a new 
sibling is born, to when a new interest is sparked, to when a new personal 
milestone is reached.  For example, if a child develops a passionate 
interest in tornadoes and violent weather, imagine how useful it would be 
for a teacher to become aware of that fact.  Imagine how useful it would be 
for a teacher to know on the first day of school that the most meaningful 
thing in a student's life is baseball.  Likewise, imagine the lost learning 
opportunities to teachers who remain unaware of the fields of learning with 
special meaning to their students.

     One of the primary advantages of electronic mail exchanges between 
the home and school is that it helps re-create that mythical "tribal 
village" from which all social structures spring.  If parents get to know 
teachers on a more personal level, they're bound to have a better 
appreciation of the teacher's teaching style.  And if teachers get to know 
parents on a more personal level, they're bound to gain deeper insight into 
the child's inner self.

     Think back to when you were in school.  If your parent ever needed to 
talk with your teacher, didn't it feel awkward to have these two total 
strangers getting together for a meeting?  Would it not have seemed more 
natural if they didn't talk just two or three times per year?

     Electronic mail has several other uses in helping to forge stronger 
ties between home and school.  Parents and teachers can maintain closer 
links about developing disciplinary problems, enabling both groups to work 
in concert to nip problems in the bud.  Teachers can easily send a single 
E-mail message copied to all online parents in a particular class, making 
use of online communication's "broadcasting" capabilities.  Academic 
triumphs of the school as a whole, and of individual students, can be 
appropriately "celebrated" online on the day the good news comes to light.

     Think back to the days of the one room school house.  Everybody knew 
one another.  The social fabric was tightly knit.  People pulled together 
because the community's goals were well-defined and commonly understood.

     Online communications serve to rebuild the sense of community that 
functions as the primary wellspring of education.  With community comes 
hope, and with hope comes everything else.

Networking with Etherplus
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Phil Shapiro
   [P.SHAPIRO1]



              >>> NEWS ABOUT THE NEW "ETHERPLUS" NETWORK <<<
              """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     An Apple II news item in the latest issue of Electronic Learning 
magazine caught my eye last week.  At the end of 1994 a company named 
VELAN, based in Los Altos, California, announced that its now possible to 
use their hardware and software to connect up Apple II's to an Ethernet 
network of MS-DOS and/or Macintosh computers.

     I placed a phone call to VELAN to find out more about this.  I 
chatted for a while with Kevin Hurlbut.  Kevin explained that the brief 
news item in Electronic Learning magazine was not entirely accurate.  
Apparently it is possible to connect Apple II's to a VELAN Ethernet 
network, but the connection is made using the standard Apple II serial 
connection, rather than via an Apple II Ethernet card.
 
     For those who might not know, serial connections to a network are 
considered rather slow.  Still, the news from VELAN is quite welcome.  
These days it is possible for a school to purchase an entire lab of Apple 
II computers, second hand, for under $1000.  Networking these computers 
together, using an MS-DOS file server, might make good sense.

     Here's a copy of the press release for the new "Etherplus" networking 
product.

                                 [*][*][*]


Press Release:
11/28/1994

"EtherPlus"
ETHERNET ON VELAN NETWORKS

     VELAN Inc., a provider of educational networking systems since 1986,  
is pleased to announce the development of EtherPlus.  EtherPlus adds 
support of network industry standard 10Base-T Ethernet to VELAN's 
networking software.  EtherPlus allows VELAN's educationally oriented 
network operating system software to network MS-DOS and Macintosh computers 
using standard Ethernet hubs, cables and adapters.  This move has been 
prompted by the enormous success and popularity of 10Base-T Ethernet in the 
networking industry.

     VELAN President Max Brown said, "We are very excited because 
EtherPlus is now the only Ethernet network operating system on the market 
that also supports Apple II computers.  We believe that this product is 
ideal for educational institutions, especially schools in transition from 
Apple II's to Macintosh and MS-DOS computers."

     EtherPlus integrates seamlessly with the traditional VELAN Network 
Operating System, and can be "back fit" into previously delivered servers,  
preserving the classroom and curriculum management capabilities of the 
VELAN software.

     Schools may choose to run EtherPlus on MS DOS and Macintosh computers 
using industry standard Ethernet cards.  Additionally, the VELAN ACT 1 
Server Board and VELAN Network interface cards may be used for Apple II 
computers, or Macintosh and MS-DOS computers that cannot support Ethernet.  
For those situations where a combination is desirable, a VELAN server will 
accommodate a combination of both types of server boards.

     VELAN EtherPlus communications will open important new doors, such as 
peer-to-peer communications and Internet connections.

     EtherPlus beta testing has been completed with MS-DOS computers and 
Macintosh testing will be completed by early summer.

     VELAN also announces the completion of its file sharing capabilities 
for Macintosh computers, to go along with the previously released MS DOS 
file sharing.  The VELAN Network System can now serve administrative,  
library and multi-user management programs at Ethernet speeds, while 
managing curricula for Apple II, Macintosh and MS-DOS computers.

     Call (415) 949-9150

          or

     FAX (415) 949-9170

     for more information or for a dealer near you.

VELAN Inc.

Los Altos,  CA
94024

                                 [*][*][*]


And here's an e-mail message Kevin Hurlbut sent me, explaining the costs 
involved in setting up an Etherplus network of Apple II's.

                                 [*][*][*]


Phil,

     I'll just briefly lay out some pricing for you.  If you are only 
interested in an Apple II network,  the power of the server is not all that 
important.  A 486 with 1MB of RAM is actually overkill.  Of course,  if you 
want to do Apple II's and connect Mac's or PC's with Ethernet,  the server 
should be a power house.

     After the server, you need server boards.  They come in 3 flavors: 
VIP 1 (really old), VIP 2 (not as old) and ACT 1 (latest, greatest). The 
difference between the boards is *speed*.

     Each server board supports 16 serial devices (computers or printers). 
 The prices:

                VIP 1           $795.00
                VIP 2           $1795.00
                ACT 1           $2495.00

     To network 30 Apple II's and a couple of printers, you would need 2 
server boards.

     The base price for the software is $2195.00.  This includes all the 
software necessary to make the network run.

     Interface cards for Apple II computers cost $85.00 each.  We usually 
quote cabling at $30.00 per computer.  The system uses Unshielded Twisted 
Pair cable.

     So, the total to build a network of 30 Apple II's (assuming all the 
machines are in the same room), would be:
 
     2 Server Boards        Range between $1590.00 - $4990.00
     (depending on which boards you buy)
 
     Interface cards                         $2550.00
     Network Software                        $2195.00
     Cabling                                  $900.00

     Installation quotes have to be done on a per site basis.
 
     Optional features include a tape backup system ($995.00) and a power 
conditioner (UPS $275.00)

     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month I've decided to 
feature the transcript files of special Real-Time Conferences held in the 
Apple II RoundTable over the years.  Whether you are looking for specific 
information about a product, or just interesting in traveling down memory 
lane, there is a wealth of information available in these files.

     Most are ASCII text files that have been shrunk with various forms of 
ShrinkIt.  Unpack them and read them with your favorite word processor.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   January/February report.

     AppleWorks 5.0 was released in January and it is fantastic.  See 
Category 42, Topic 30 for official support.  More general discussion can be 
found in Category 17, Topic 27, and in Topics28-32 of that category.

     Spectrum 2.0 also started shipping in January.  The people at Seven 
Hills have worked very hard on this and it is a really great 16-bit (IIgs 
only) Communication program.  The introductory demo by Ken Lucke is a sight 
to behold and worth the price of admission by itself.  In it he shows the 
extreme versatility of the Spectrum scripting language.  It looks like a 
hypermedia stack and it's all done with Spectrum scripts and external 
commands (XCMDs)!  See Category 43, Topics 15 & 16.

     There was an upgrade to CoPilot, the IIgs offline navigator, to 
version 2.5.5.  See the library listings below for download file numbers.

     Congratulations to Joe Kohn's Shareware Solutions II newsletter on 
reaching 1000 subscribers in all 50 states plus many countries around the 
world.  For more information on SS II, see Category 28.


WHAT'S NEW IN A2   There will be a new lineup in the Roundtable conference 
""""""""""""""""   area starting March 1st.  As always, our Bulletin Board 
(option #1 from the A2 main menu) is a wealth of information on topics of 
interest in the A2 world, as well as general discussion on everything 
imaginable!  Come in and introduce yourself in category 2, topic 6.  If 
you're a fugitive from America Online, feel free to post in both topic 2 
and 6.
