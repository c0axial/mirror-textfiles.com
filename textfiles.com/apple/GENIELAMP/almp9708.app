Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.                          [A2LAMP]                        >>> GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS <<<                        """""""""""""""""""""""""""      I believe it was in the original "Oh God" movie where George Burns isasked, if he is indeed God, why he allows people to suffer.  His responseis along the lines of, "I could never figure out how to make things withonly one side."  If there's a top, there's a bottom.  If there's an inside,there's an outside.     If there's Good News, there's Bad News.     KansasFest 1997 has come and gone, and while there was some Bad News(the attendance was the lowest it's ever been, and the Avila food wasnothing to write home about), there was some spectacularly Good News aswell.  Prolific Australian programmer Richard Bennett shocked the entireworld by unveiling _Marinetti_ at KFest '97.  _Marinetti_ is the code namefor an Apple IIgs Control Panel that brings TCP/IP to the Apple IIgs, atotally separate effort from Derek Taubert's long awaited _GS/TCP_ project.It will be distributed as freeware.  Good News indeed!     KFesters also got to see hardware that never existed, software that noone ever thought would, and got to meet Apple II fanatics from all over theworld.  And while Bad News always exists, Good News is always better.     In any case, while we usually restrict our "Hey Mister Postman"feature to posts on the Genie A2 BB during the previous month, this issuewe have included quite a few early August posts due to KFest 1997straddling both months.     KansasFest forever.                                 [*][*][*]     Sometimes we don't know if something is Good News or Bad News.  Takethe current status of Genie, for instance.     Genie management has made clear that there are changes coming toGenie.  What they have not made clear is just what those changes are.  What_is_ known is that all of the Genie offline processors (_Aladdin_, _OnlineServant_, _CoPilot_, _GEM_, and any others) will break.  How badly theywill break (and, consequently, how quickly they can be fixed, if, indeed,they can be) is unknown at this time.  It also appears the way Genie usersaccess Genie will change, but, again, what this will change to is unknownas well.     This _could_ be a change for the better, after all.  If Genie droppedtheir prices and allowed a low cost offering such as Delphi does with theirContent Plan, Genie could continue to be the center of the Apple IIuniverse for many years to come.  That's an optimistic view, but it's apossibility.  Again, we just don't know.     What I _do_ know, however, is that the very production of_GenieLamp A2_ is dependent on Genie offline processors, and if they cannotbe quickly repaired, _GenieLamp A2_, at least in the form it is currentlyknown, is dead in the water, kaput, finishd.     That would be very Bad News indeed.  Stay tuned.                                 [*][*][*]     What is definitely Good News is that while KansasFest 1997 is over,the momentum of Apple II enthusiasm KFest generated has not been slowed oneiota.  The Delphi A2 Forum has been picking up tremendous amounts of steamas Apple II user after Apple II user seeks refuge from the storm that isUsenet, and the proliferation of offline processors (_Crock O' Gold_,_OLRight!_, and _QuarkNet_) has made life easier for everyone.  We areanxiously awaiting the arrival of _Marinetti_, _GSoft_, and _MUG_, andhoping that NinjaForce can find the time to finish _Kaboom!_  The BigCheese of KFest herself, Cindy Adams, is trying to convince some Apple IIgsprogrammer out there to port _Snood_ from the Mac.  Those of us involved inwriting about the Apple II have more than our usual share of work cut outfor us with covering KFest, _Marinetti_, Genie, Delphi, and trying to getthe whole Apple II world up to speed on TCP/IP.     Finally, after a brief breather, your hard-working KansasFestcommittee has set set the dates for KansasFest 1998 as July 22-26 1998 atAvila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  Mark those calendars now, andwe'll keep our monthly series of KansasFest Blatant Plugs going as long aspossible.     Good News, indeed.-- RyanGenie Mail:  A2LAMP                           Internet:  a2lamp@genie.com        __________________________________________________________       |                                                          |       |                   REPRINTING GENIELAMP                   |       |                                                          |       |   If you want to reprint any part of GenieLamp, or       |       |   post it to a bulletin board, please see the very end   |       |   of this file for instructions and limitations.         |       |__________________________________________________________|ASCII ART BEGINS       _____            _      _                              ___  ___     / ____|          (_)    | |                            / _ \|__ \    | |  __  ___ _ __  _  ___| |     __ _ _ __ ___  _ __   | |_| |  ) |    | | |_ |/ _ \ '_ \| |/ _ \ |    / _` | '_ ` _ \| '_ \  |  _  | / /    | |__| |  __/ | | | |  __/ |___| (_| | | | | | | |_) | | | | |/ /_     \_____|\___|_| |_|_|\___|______\__,_|_| |_| |_| .__/  |_| |_|____|                                                           | |                                                           |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][HEY]//////////////////////////////              HEY MISTER POSTMAN //////////////////////////////////Is That A Letter For Me?""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan Suenaga       [A2LAMP]     o BULLETIN BOARD HOT SPOTS          o A2 POT-POURRI                    o HOT TOPICS                         o WHAT'S NEW                              o THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE                                   o MESSAGE SPOTLIGHT                     >>> BULLETIN BOARD HOT SPOTS <<<                     """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""     [*] CAT  1, TOP 29 .......

However, given the toolsand the time frame work that we had, we did the best we could to merge thetwo RoundTables with the fewest number of problems for you.Here are the facts as I know them.For some time we had discussed the possibility of merging A2Pro back intoA2 in order to increase discussions in the programming topics. However, thenecessity of this merger was forced upon us when IDT, the owners of Genie,decided that the A2Pro Roundtable did not have sufficient traffic towarrant its continued existence. We were essentially given until the end ofJune to decide what to do with it.With less than a month to decide, we feverishly discussed our options andhow we could save A2Pro for you.  As soon as we had a plan we began puttingbanners and messages in the bulletin boards letting folks know what washappening. I understand that some of you did not see those messages untilit was too late, but we did the best we could.It was decided to merge the two bulletin boards all on one day, June 26,rather than stretch it out over several days. This would mean that some ofyou who were unaware of what was happening would experience one day ofhorror, but then it would be over and we could all get on with our liveshere in A2.The next step was to merge the two libraries. That was essentially donethis past weekend, although some changes may still need to be made.Now you have a new bulletin board with lots of new topics, and a librarythat has lots of new files that many of you were unaware even existed. Ihope that you will see this as an opportunity rather than as a problem.Others have tried to explain the limitations of Genie's bulletin board andlibrary management utilities and I won't add to it, except to say that wedid the very best that we could to ease the difficulties that you had toexperience. Please accept our apologies for your inconvenience.Charlie Hartley                (A2.CHARLIE, CAT1, TOP29, MSG:323/M645;1) CA MESSAGE FROM SEVEN HILLS""""""""""""""""""""""""""I just got off the phone with Seven Hills.

I am not optimistic thatthe Genie offline readers will be fixable after the changevoer. Hopefully Iam wrong, but it would be prudent for everyone to start hedging their betsright now in case the OLR's prove to be difficult or impossible to fix.With regard to joining Delphi:The Apple II community there is growing slowly but visibly. With thischange in Genie, it may see a major growth spurt in the near future. My gutfeeling is that, because of the library and OLR situations, six months fromnow the current roles and relative ranking of Delphi and Genie will bereversed.Right now the Delphi library only has a few hundred files in it, but plansare afoot to automate a large-scale upload to make it into something to beproud of like we have here on Genie. Failing that, if A2-Delphi didsomething as simple as organize a hundred users into uploading a few oftheir favorite files, things could start hopping overnight.At this time file transfers on Delphi are reliable only if using Delphi'sdirect-access membership option. Their "content" membership option givesyou access via your own internet dial-up through a telnet connection. Tosay that file transfers via telnet are unreliable vastly understates thecase.  Having said that, There Are Rumors that Delphi has something in theworks to greatly improve file transfer capabilities, but I have no word onwhat that might be or when it will surface.In no way am I suggesting that people quit Genie and join Delphi.

I have used the same routinefor all of my dialing scripts, and may have been this way when I took overfrom PMP in supporting the CoPilot scripts.I have had a very few users of both CoPilot and OLRight! who have hadproblems making connections.  Some of these problems have defied allattempts to fix.  What I am about to describe _may_ be part of the problem.The following is the stock detection script from both applications.  Thelabel names may change, but the same conditionals are used: #rget    loc 0 0    as s1 "*&*&"    rget s1 40 120 up s1    if s1 "*&*&" #noconn    fi "CONNECT" s1 if su #logon    fi "BUSY" s1 if su #busy    fi "VOICE" s1 if su #noconn    fi "NO CARRIER" s1 if su #noconn    fi "NO DIAL" s1 if su #nodial2 go #rget #logonThe script assigns a default value to the string variable s1, and thenwaits for up to 2 minutes for a line from the modem.  If it receives a linefrom the modem, it tests against the contents of the line to determinewhether a connection has been made.The Problem:  If the modem returns an empty line (i.e. a carriage returnonly) before another string, the script may exit thinking there is noconnection.  I have run into situations in some of the commands in whichattempts to put a null value into a variable that already has a valueresults in the variable not being changed.  I seem to recall that the rgetcommand is one of these, but it is tough to test that command.So...If you are having problems connecting, try changing the script to thefollowing: #rget    loc 0 0    as s1 "*&*&"    rget s1 40 120 if fa #noconn    up s1    fi "CONNECT" s1 if su #logon    fi "BUSY" s1 if su #busy    fi "VOICE" s1 if su #noconn    fi "NO CARRIER" s1 if su #noconn    fi "NO DIAL" s1 if su #nodial2 go #rget #logonIf you compare the script fragments, you can see that I have deleted theparts relating to detecting the default value of s1, and added aconditional to the rget command line.If you are having connect problems and this fixes them, _PLEASE_ let meknow!If you want to test a small script that demonstrates this 'feature' of theANSITerm scripting language, try the following (copy to a new file and runit with Command-Z): as s9 "Gotcha!" get "Press Enter or type a string" s9 note s9 exitIf you simply press Enter when you see the 'get' dialog, you should see"Gotcha!" in the following 'note' window.Don V.Zahniser - CoPilot for ANSITerm SupportDelivered by:CoPilot 2.5.6 and ANSITerm v2.13b                (D.ZAHNISER, CAT21, TOP18, MSG:148/M645;1)                            >>> HOT TOPICS <<<                            """"""""""""""""""KFEST BEFORE   Help!!!

DELPHI INTERNET FORUMS GO FREE ON THE WEBCambridge, MA (July 15, 1997) -- For the first time in its 14 years ofservice, Delphi Internet's acclaimed communities are now available for freeon the Web (http://www.delphi.com). Delphi, one of the early pioneers inbuilding communities, features more than 100 rich and welcomingspecial-interest forums where members discuss everything from Applecomputers to the Zodiac.With all the fanfare about "communities" on the Web, Delphi expects to seta new benchmark for quality. Its message boards and chat areas are hostedby energetic experts in their fields, so Delphi forums generally hone tostated topics and avoid the ambient "clutter" of most Web offerings. "It'sall about the user experience--people sharing their intelligence,information and emotions with each other--that we think the rest of the Webwill come around to," says Dan Bruns, Delphi Chief Executive Officer.Delphi forums integrate bulletin board-style message boards and chat roomsfeaturing live guests, as well as articles, tutorials, contests and othercontent selected by forum hosts specially for their members. Thecombination creates a meaningful and bonding experience for communitymembers across nine "channels" of forums, including Arts & Entertainment,Business & Finance, Computing & the Net, Current Affairs, Games, Hobbies &Crafts, Home & Family, Relationships & Support, and Travel & Cultures.Formerly dependent only on subscriptions from loyal users, Delphi will nowaccelerate advertising and transactional sales on the website. It hasrecently struck syndication alliances with a number of other websites suchas SupportHelp.com, Planet Direct, Citibank and Nynex Big Yellow, and isavailable in customized formats to other websites. Delphi also offers aPremium package of services, such as a full-service email account, 10megabytes of personal Web space and four hours of multiplayer game play,for as little as $2.90 per month.Delphi Internet, formerly owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., wasrepurchased by Bruns and other Delphi managers in April 1996, and made itsWeb debut in October 1996. In February 1997, Delphi launched Custom Forums,a related service that allows families, businesses and other web sites touse Delphi software to run their own communities(http://www.customforum.com).

However, thereare a few things an Apple II user needs to know.First of all, you'll need a web browser that can handle cookies. The latestversion of Lynx will work fine, but older versions (noticeably the one usedhere on Genie) will not work. Unfortunately, SIS doesn't handle cookies soit will not work either.Second, you need a web browser that supports secure HTML (shtml) in orderto sign up for the free service. I don't know why shtml was needed sinceyou're not (I haven't tried it, but I hope not!) giving out credit cardinformation for a free service. I would guess you give them your name andemail address so they can track spammers and other weasels. UnfortunatelyLynx does not support shtml as shipped due to the munitions export lawsgoverning encryption. SIS does not do shtml either.What this means is that you'll probably have to use a PC or Mac to do theinitial sign up, but an Apple II can be used to access Delphi as long asyou're using the most recent version of Lynx.  - Tony                   (A2.TONY, CAT28, TOP23, MSG:3/M645;1)>>>>>   Since LYNX does not support .shtml (Secure HTML) documents, you"""""   won't be able to log in for the free access using LYNX.

Here it is. :)After mentioning last week that Lynx does not ship with the ability tohandle https (secure) URLs, I decided to find out what was involved ingetting the extra "stuff" Lynx needs to do it. Well, after a 4 hour jamsession on my ISP's UNIX shell I have finally compiled a version of Lynxthat =can= do https URLs. As a bonus, I compiled in the color ANSI (slang)stuff (which my ISP already did for tin) and it looks great.What this means is that it =is= possible to get a secure connection withLynx so you can safely transmit personal information across the web. Onespecific example is that you can now signup for Delphi from their secureserver. Pretty cool.I was going to post some simple (sic) instructions on how you can do ityourself, but after what I went through I'm not sure that's such a goodidea. I would probably end up confusing more people than I help. If you arehandy with your ISP's compiler, here's basically what you need:Read this! http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month0497/msg00263.htmlThen grab all this source code:Lynx 2.7.1: http://www.slcc.edu/lynx/fote/     [NO OTHER VERSION]Fote's patches: http://www.slcc.edu/lynx/fote/patches/SSL hook replacements: email to tzeruch@ceddec.com   [*See below]SSLeay: ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL(That's a LOT of code. This is not for the feint of heart.)The reason Lynx does not ship with SSL built-in is because of the lamemunitions laws governing encryption. In order to get the SSL hooks you haveto write to the above address and say something like, "I am a US citizen, Ican legally use it, I won't illegally export it." There's more about thisin the first "Read me" URL above.Stir it all together, pray, and voila!

Brickell        [P.BRICKELL]                 >>> PART 5:  THE ANNUNCIATORS - ACT 1 <<<                """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""     Up until now I have shown you how to make your Apple listen to thereal world and tell you what is going on.  We have looked at measuringtime, temperatures, whether a button has been pressed, and how quickly.Other than beeping its speaker, your Apple has been doing a lot oflistening but no talking.  In this installment we will take a look at thebasic feature of most Apple II models that allows them to actually dothings in the outside world.     This feature consists of the annunciator output lines from the 16 pingame I/O port.  Unfortunately for //c and //c+ users, these models haveonly the 9-pin game port which does not have these lines.  As I havementioned before, if you have one of these models and are serious aboutinterfacing, it is worth looking around for an old II+ which can be had fora song these days and has a complete set of game port I/O lines.     Today's lesson is a simple introduction to the annunciators with adescription of what they are and how they are controlled.  In a subsequentinstallment we will look at how to wire them up to do useful work.     There are 4 annunciator lines on the Apple II named AN0, AN1, AN2,AN3.  These lines are TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) output signallines, for those who are familiar with such things.   Since they aredigital signals, they can have only one of two states - high or low (on oroff).   In strict electronics terms this means that when they are high (on)an annunciator line has a voltage of 3 volts DC or higher present on it.When the line is low (off) the voltage is less than 1 volt DC.  In actualuse, you will typically see a voltage of +5 volts when it is turned on andalmost zero volts when turned off.     The annunciators can be turned on and off by means of Applesoft ormachine language.  Each annunciator has two memory locations associatedwith it.  To turn the annunciator on, store a number (any number from 0 to255) in the "on" memory location.  To turn that annunciator off, you storea number of your choice in that annunciator's "off" memory location.  Forthose of you familiar with machine language and the inner workings of theApple II, these are soft switches which are set by either a read or writeoperation to the appropriate memory location.     Here are the memory locations associated with the annunciators on theApple II:                      ON      OFFAN0       decimal   -16295    -16296          hex        $C059     $C058AN1       decimal   -16293    -16294          hex        $C05B     $C05AAN2       decimal   -16291    -16292          hex        $C05D     $C05CAN3       decimal   -16289    -16290          hex        $C05F     $C05E     I have used the negative decimal numbering system for the addresses.You can, of course, use the positive notation in Applesoft if you wish.The negative addresses are however,  compatible with both Applesoft andInteger Basic.  The hexadecimal version of these addresses will be usefulfor machine language programmers.     Let's look at how to use these addresses.  As an example, to turn onannunciator 0 and then turn it off again you could use the following basicprogram:10  HOME20 PRINT "PRESS '1' TO TURN ON ANNUNCIATOR 0"30 PRINT "PRESS '0' TO TURN OFF ANNUNCIATOR 0"40 PRINT: GET A$50 IF A$ = "0" THEN GOTO 10060 IF A$ = "1" THEN GOTO 20070 GOTO 10100  POKE -16296,0: REM   TURNS AN0 OFF110 GOTO 10200  POKE -16295,0: REM   TURNS AN0 ON210 GOTO 10     Lines 20-40 ask you for an operation to perform, lines 50 and 60direct the program flow depending on the operation selected, and lines100-210 do the actual switching of the annunciator.  To switch the otherannunciators only the addresses in lines 100 and 200 need to be changed.     One peculiarity to be aware of when using the annunciators is how theannunciators are set when the Apple II is turned or reset by a CTRL-RESETkey press.  During the reset cycle on an Apple II Plus annunciators 0 and 1are turned ON and annunciators 2 and 3 are turned OFF.  This is importantto know if you are using AN0 and AN1 to operate equipment when the computeris unattended.  If a power failure occurs, you don't want to create ahazardous condition by turning on certain equipment (such as heaters)indefinitely.  For such safety-sensitive applications it is wise to selectthe annunciators which default to the off state on a power up.  Users ofother Apple II models should consult their technical reference manuals tofind out which annunciators, if any, are set on at power up.     So what can you do with all this new found information?   Perhaps Ishould tell you what you can _not_ do with it first!  You can not use the+5 volts from the annunciator lines to operate any real-world devicedirectly.  The TTL logic chips which turn these lines on and off are verylow power devices.  They are not designed to operate electrical orelectronic equipment.  Trying to use the current from the annunciator linesto run something directly will  certainly result in damage to your Apple.The only truly safe use for the annunciator lines is as a signal to triggera circuit which can provide a higher power level which can do useful work.Depending upon the voltage and power requirements of the device that youwish to run, several successive stages of power step-up (amplification) andelectrical isolation may be required.     The issue of electrical isolation is a very important one for yourpersonal safety and the for the reliability of your Apple.  Many electroniccomponents that are used in amplifying circuits (such as transistors) canallow current from the high power circuit to feed back into the low powercircuit (i.e. your Apple) if they fail for some reason.  This can bedangerous and fatal (at least to your computer).   For this reason circuitswhich provide total electrical separation (isolation), between yourcomputer and the high power device are essential in the design of systemsfor using the annunciators for real-world operations.   These circuits willbe discussed in the next installment of this series.  In the meantime don'tplug your blender into your Apple's game port  ;-)     To summarize this installment, we have seen that many models of AppleII have electrical signal lines called annunciators with can be made tochange from +5 to 0 volts and back again under software control.    Theselines are very weak signals which can not be used to operate anythingdirectly, but must be amplified by an external circuit first.  In additionto this, it is crucial to isolate them electrically from the final devicewhich is controlled by the amplifying circuit.  This protects both thecomputer and more importantly, its human operator.  We will look at theseexternal amplifying and isolating circuits next time.     I hope that for now you can begin to appreciate how your Apple may beuseful in controlling things in the outside world using the four on/offsignals which can be generated in the computer with Applesoft or machinelanguage commands.  Your assignment for next time:  think about whatdevices in your environment you might wish to have your computer control.You will have to figure out how they might be operated by a few on/offswitches and what kind of information your Apple might need to know foroperating its switches (time, temperature, etc.)NOTE:     In the next article of this series I will be referring to a specificVernier Software project on operating real world devices with theannunciator signals.  I recommend that you get your Vernier books out, orbeg, borrow or buy a copy if you want to actually build such a project.Either "How to Build a Better Mousetrap" or "Chaos in the Laboratory" willdo as both have a version of this project (Optically Isolated Switches).See one of my early installments for Vernier's address and phone number.     In the meantime, happy dreaming![EOA][FOC]//////////////////////////////                     FOCUS ON... //////////////////////////////////KansasFest 1997"""""""""""""""by Ryan M. Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.                          [A2LAMP]                    >>> THE BEST OF KANSASFEST 1997 <<<                    """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""     This is not your ordinary KansasFest  review.  As you've seen in  thismonth's _HEY MISTER POSTMAN_  column just a few  lines above, there's  newsgalore emanating  from Avila  College,  and much  of  it has  already  beencovered by the faithful in the A2 RoundTable Bulletin Board.  So instead ofyour typical rundown of the happenings of KansasFest, we here at _GenieLampA2_ would instead like  to recognize the best  that the Apple II  Communityhas to offer: the best of KansasFest 1997.BEST DEBUT   Steve Cavanaugh, publisher of _The Apple Blossom_ and _Hyper""""""""""   Quarterly_, had for years said he wanted to come toKansasFest, yet nothing came of it until this year, when some of his fellowApple II newsletter editors, in combination with his lovely wife Laurie,bugged him incessantly until he submitted.  He ended up doing a session onHyperCard IIgs, a demonstration of _Hyper Quarterly_, and making friendseverywhere he went with his disarming smile and New England accent.BEST COMEBACK   Not only did A2Pro's Todd Whitsel make it back to Kfest"""""""""""""   after four years of absence, so did a lost room key fromhis last trip to Avila.BEST DOOR SIGN  While there were many entrants, David Kerwood's Rhode""""""""""""""  Island Apple Group banner, the size of a Ridgway dorm roomdoor, was certainly an impressive site.  More impressive was the fact thatthe club made it up special for his keynote address at Kfest '97!Runner-up: Cindy Adams, The Big Cheese of Kfest, who wasn't able to bringher Cheesehead hat but did manage to post a new Momma Cheese sign on herdoor.BEST DEALS AT KANSASFEST 1997   Mike Westerfield of The Byteworks had some"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   wildly exciting pricing on most of hisproducts--so good I bought backups to some books I thought irreplaceable.Honorable mention: Max Jones of _Juiced.GS_ had arranged with well-knownApple IIgs programmer Eric Shepherd, a.k.a. Sheppy, to sell ten copies ofthe ultimate Apple IIgs power users tool; within an hour, he had sold outof all the copies of Shifty List 2.0 he had.BEST ROOMMATE IF YOU WANTED TO SLEEP   The hero of Kfest '97, Richard""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Bennett, was definitely the best guyto share a room with if you wanted to sleep--he might've spent a total ofan hour in his room all Kfest.  Despite all of this, his roomie, Tony Ward,a.k.a. Conan the Librarian, was as wiped out as anyone at the end of Kfest.BEST ROOMMATE IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SLEEP  The schedulemeister himself,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  Steve "Godzilla" Gozdziewski,who didn't want to, either.BEST USE OF EMAIL   Non-KFest attendee Loreen Miller, wife of A2Pro's Just"""""""""""""""""   Dave Miller, who mailed some of the Kfest attendees tolet them know that Dave was coming in on an earlier flight than expected.The KFesters managed to get Carl Knobloch dispatched to the airport in timeto get Dave before his baggage got through.BEST COLLABORATION   Mike Westerfield of The Byteworks and Richard Bennett,""""""""""""""""""   author of Marinetti.  A late night hack session onFriday came within a few lines of source code back in Sydney of resultingin a fifteen line telnet program written in _Gsoft_ BASIC.BEST BIT OF TELECOMM HACKING FROM AN AIRPORT   Your _GenieLamp A2_ editor,""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Ryan Suenaga, managing toget onto the Internet from a public phone in the Kansas City InternationalAirport with his Powerbook but without a quarter.  This allowed the promptpickup of Michael Hackett, Tony Ward, and Jerry Cline, who had sent emailwith their arrival information.BEST IMITATION OF A DENTIST   The Mad Hacker, Tony Diaz of Alltech"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Electronics, and his able assistant, Dremel,creating both a mess and another production run of one portable Apple IIgs,this time in a DynaMac case, using a Mark Twain motherboard.BEST DAY OF SCHEDULING   Every day, thanks to the tireless effort of Steve""""""""""""""""""""""   Gozdziewski, who posted notes everywhere everynight to keep the entire congregation updated.  Steve either dazzled ordisappointed everyone with his apology note on Saturday night due to hisnot being able to find a single thing to change on the Sunday schedule.BEST SHOW OF SPORTSMANSHIP   Scott Johnson and Paul Zaleski, both past""""""""""""""""""""""""""   winners of Bite The Bag, who agreed to a tieafter they found themselves facing each other in the ultimate test ofKansasFest fitness.BEST JOB OF NAVIGATION   The team of Steve Cavanaugh, Steve Gozdziewski,""""""""""""""""""""""   Richard Bennett, Joe Kohn, Tony Ward, DavidKerwood, Michael Hackett, and Jerry Cline, who kept your editor fromgetting lost all of KansasFest, through trips to the UPS terminal, KansasCity International Airport, CompUSA, K.C. Masterpiece, and Jess & Jim'sSteakhouse.BEST BLATANT PLUG   Max Jones, publisher of _Juiced.GS_, who was revealed"""""""""""""""""   to actually be Joe the Promotions Manager at _SharewareSolutions II_.BEST SHOWING BY A COUNTRY NOT NAMED THE UNITED STATES   Australia, with"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   three KFesters(Brian Pinch, Andrew Roughan, and Richard Bennett), just beat out Canada(Hamish Davidson and Michael Hackett).BEST LICENSE PLATE   Russ Alman of Missouri, who drove his car to KFest""""""""""""""""""   with the vanity plate reading: APL-2GS.BEST REAL-TIME COVERAGE   The tireless David Kerwood went from making"""""""""""""""""""""""   history with his keynote address to making pageswith his constant updates of the A2-Web World Wide Web page athttp://www.syndicomm.com/a2web.  Regular updates of KFest events kept theonline world up-to-date with the big bash.  For an encore, David went up toMacWorld days later and continued his real-time reports from there.BEST REASONS TO MISS KFEST, BUT DIDN'T USE THEM   Stan Marks, who had a"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   wedding anniversary justafter KFest, had his first grandchild born just before KFest, but he stilldrove over from Mississippi to make the 1997 celebration.  Runner up: CarlKnobloch, who had a grandchild born around the same time Stan did.Congratulations, guys.BEST FOOD   The Avila Cafeteria.  NOT!  Jess & Jim's Steakhouse had some of"""""""""   the world's largest baked potatoes and such great steak you'dthink you went to cattle heaven.BEST SESSION THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN   Apple Computer, Inc., canceled their"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   yearly KFest presentation for earlyFriday morning, which allowed everyone to get a little more sleep and letbreakfast start a little later.  This lent to a record turnout for a KFestbreakfast.And finally. . .BEST APPLE II SHOW OF THE YEAR   KansasFest 1997, of course.  Thanks to""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Cindy Adams, Jerry Cline, and SteveGozdziewski for heading up the planning of the best Apple II event ever.Apple II Forever!           //////////////////////////////////////// Genie_QWIK_QUOTE ////          /     " Few women admit their age.
