Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
By John Peters
   [GENIELAMP]



TOP OF THE PAGE        Welcome to the mid-month issue of GEnieLamp!
"""""""""""""""   If you haven't heard, the flagship issues of GEnieLamp
(GEnieLamp IBM, Mac, ST and A2) has split into two issues, released on the
1st and the the 15th of every month.  The issue on the 1st will concentrate
on message highlights, news and general information.  The second issue will
bring you the latest news and views from the libraries and real-time
conferences as well as other GEnie bits & pieces of information.


GEnieLamp Distribution Method Changes   In the last issue, I announced that
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   instead of listing/capturing
GEnieLamp you would soon be able to download your issue of GEnieLamp just
as you would with any other file here on GEnie.  I'm happy to announce
that the new system is in place and it works great!  Now you can DOWNLOAD
your favorite copy of GEnieLamp Online Magazine, just as you would any
other file found here on GEnie.


NOTE TO SCRIPT USERS   For Aladdin readers we have included the new
""""""""""""""""""""   GET_THE_LAMP script in this issue of GEnieLamp IBM
and ST.  With this script Aladdin will log on to the GEnieLamp page,
capture one (or more) of the issues and then either hang up or go on and do
an autopass 1 or 2.  See ADD ALADDIN for elsewhere in this issue for
details.  For Macintosh readers a new version of GEnieLamp Module v3.01e
will be released that will allow you to download any and all issues of
GEnieLamp Mac/MacPRO and the other platforms -- up to 8 at a time -- from
page 515 and the new DIGIPUB RT library at 1395.  See this column in the
next issue of GEnieLamp for complete details.


T/TalkNET Publishing & LiveWire Online   Starting with the March/April
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   issue of Livewire, T/TalkNET has
been commissioned to do the final formatting of the online version of
LiveWire Magazine.  The online version of LiveWire has many articles and
features that are not found in its sister hardcopy publication, LiveWire.
To check out the latest issue, type LIVEWIRE at any GEnie main menu
prompt.  (And like GEnieLamp, LiveWire Online is GEnie*Basic!)

     Until next time...
                                                     John Peters

FILES, FILES, FILES!   This month we'll take a look at some recently
""""""""""""""""""""   uploaded software, highlighting those files I think
deserve a second look.  So let's get started.

                               [*][*][*]

 
     For those of us that still love Classic Appleworks the National
Appleworks Users Group (NAUG) has uploaded Printer Drivers for most of the
printers that were not covered in the original program.  These printer
drivers come in the form of SEG.ER files that contain customized pre-set
codes for different printers.  To use a particular driver all you do is
rename the SEG.ER file on your copy of AW3 to another name, such as
OLD.SEGER, then copy the driver you wish to used to your disk and rename it
SEG.ER.  There are some 43 drivers included and they cover most of the
newer Letter Quality dot matrix, Ink Jet, and Laser Jet printers. Complete
instructions are included with notes about the use of each printer driver.
You can write to NAUG if you have a printer not included with the uploads
and they will be added to the list.  This is upload is very helpful for
Appleworks version 3.0 users.

20311  PRINTDRV1.BXY
20312  PRINTDRV2.BXY   Do you have a collection of your favorite DOS 3.3
""""""""""""""""""""   programs but you hardly ever run them because you
must undergo so much trouble on your Apple IIGS to do it?  Wouldn't it be
great if you could just put those DOS 3.3 programs on your hard disk and
run them like any other program?  With the programs and files included with
DOS 3.3 Launcher you can do just that.  John MacClean from Australia gives
us this capability with his DOS 3.3 Copier/Launcher program.  ProDOS 8-bit
versions are also included so you can work directly from the 8-bit level.
Several options are available from DOS 3.3 Copier including switching to 1
Mhz system speed as the program is launched.  I would highly recommend this
great set of utilities for anyone that likes those classic DOS 3.3
programs.  There is a $10 US or $15 Australian Shareware fee.


20316  DOS33.LNCHR.BXY   Go.  Yes, Go.  No don't get up and leave just
""""""""""""""""""""""   yet.  This GO is in reference to the ancient
oriental game.  There are so many rules for this game that it is played
differently depending which country you are in.  So it's no wonder that
nobody has come up with a true version of GO that can be played on the
Apple IIGS.  Formerly, only the children's version of trying to get five
pieces in a row has been available.  The latest offering from Kenrick Mock
called Pente GS is in this category.  However, just like Kenrick's mind,
this version has an interesting twist, or I should say "several"
interesting twists.

     Pente GS is easy to learn, and has great graphics and sound.  It is
recommended for 7 year olds and higher, although most 7 year olds would be
hard to beat.  Therefore, Kenrick included a computer opponent with three
levels of smartness. In the "Trivial" level the computer will only think
one move ahead and is finished within a few seconds.  The computer is easy
to beat at this level with a little practice.  In the "Student" level the
computer thinks two moves ahead and is done within a minute or two.  Then
there is the Master level (picture of Einstein sleeping) where the computer
will think three moves ahead.  As pointed out in the on-screen
instructions, this is the slowest level, taking 10 minutes to make a move.

     The object of the game is the same as previous games: get five pieces
in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  However, there is
a second way to win, namely, capture five pairs of your opponents pieces.
Pieces can  be captured if you can sandwich exactly two of your opponents
pieces between two of yours.  This is a great touch and adds a new
dimension to the game.  Kenrick you have done it again.  There is a $10
Shareware fee.


20318  PENTE.GS.BXY   Often, I have been in the middle of a project using
"""""""""""""""""""   an Apple IIGS application program and wished that I
could rename a file or create a new subdirectory, or generally do file
keeping without having to leave my application. The Classic Desk Accessory
(CDA) File-A-Trix by Karl Bunker is the answer to this problem.
File-A-Trix is a complete set of file utilities which can do the following
functions:

     o   Catalog any online disk, showing the contents of any folder
     o   Copy files from one disk or folder to another
     o   Move files -- i.e., copy and then delete the original
     o   Delete files
     o   Lock and unlock files, or change their type or auxtype
     o   Rename files
     o   Create a new folder
     o   View or print text files, and the text content of other files
     o   Find a file on a disk, using its name or partial name
     o   Initialize (format) 3.5" disks

     There is a $10.00 Shareware fee.


20392  FILE.A.TRIX.BXY   Bouncing Ferno is one of the many games to come
""""""""""""""""""""""   from the French based Free Tool Association
(FTA), since defunct.  Joe Kohn of Shareware Solutions fame, in association
with the FTA, conducted a contest for the best levels that could be
generated with the levels maker which was included with the original game.
A second contest was done for programmers which challenged them to complete
the game using the source code supplied by the FTA.  Well to make a short
story shorter, Brett Dunst of Palos Verdes, CA won for supplying the best
new Bouncin'Ferno levels, and Dustin Mitchell of Scarborough, Maine, a 14
year old High School Freshman won the grand prize for creating the most
fabulous new game.

     The result is Bouncing Ferno II.  This version of the FTA inspired
game is fully IIGS compatible and hard drive installable.  There are two
levels of 25 rooms each. Some rooms are easy, but some are really tough but
the main thing is that the flavor of the game is still FTA.  This was a
great way to continue to FTA tradition and we hope with the help of such
people as John Kohn the tradition will continue.  This program is Freeware.
You will need the English versions of the game documentation which is
available in the A2 Library at file:   18711  BF.US.DOCS.TXT.

20394  FERNO2.BXY
20442  BONCN.FRNO2.BXY   (non-bootable)   For HyperStudio version 3.1, the
""""""""""""""""""""""   people at DreamWorld have developed a New Button
Action (NBA) entitled View32 v1.00.  View32 permits the inclusion of
16/256/3200 color and 640 mode graphics into your HyperStudio stacks.  This

The System Utilities Disk
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
By Phil Shapiro
   [P.Shapiro1]



     [This article is the first in a series of GEnieLamp articles aimed at
      novice Apple II computer users.  It's hoped that some of these
      "Beginner Corner" articles might be re-printed in user group
      publications, to help meet the needs of newcomers to the Apple II.]

                               [*][*][*]

 
     The Apple II System Utilities disk is a useful disk that was bundled
in with every new Apple IIe, IIc, IIGS, and IIc+ computer sold. Many
persons who have bought second-hand Apple II computers might be unfamiliar
with what the System Utilities disk can do. This article is being written
to give an overview of the functions of the System Utilities disk, pointing
out the handful of useful "file management" tasks the disk can perform for
you.

     In its early form, between 1983 and 1985, the System Utilities disk
was named the "ProDOS Users' Disk."  If you're still using the ProDOS
Users' Disk with your Apple II, you may want to obtain the latest Apple II
System Utilities disk from your local Apple user group. The latest version
of the System Utilities disk offers some important disk copying
enhancements not found on the either the ProDOS Users' disk, nor on the
later Apple IIc System Utilities disk. (These earlier utility disks took
upwards of 17 disk swaps to copy a single 5.25 inch disk. The newer System
Utilities disk, with its Fast Copy routine, can copy any 5.25 inch disk in
two passes, or fewer.)

     As mentioned above, one of the most useful functions of the System
Utilities disk is in making back-up copies of your data disks and your
software programs. (Software programs that you buy in the store are also
commonly referred to as "applications.")

     Note, though, that the System Utilities disk can only copy software
that is not copy-protected. Since 1990, most software publishers have
removed copy-protection schemes from their commercial software.

     A second important function of the System Utilities disk is to format
blank data disks. Data disks are most frequently used to store writing that
is created with word processors.  But a data disk can equally well be used
to store graphics created with a paint program, or music created with a
music program.

     Most Apple IIe and IIc users will be using 5.25 inch floppy disks with
their systems. To format 5.25 inch disks you need to specify in which disk
drive your data disk is residing.  If you have a single 5.25 inch disk
drive, that drive is designated as: "Slot 6, Drive 1."  If you have a
second 5.25 inch drive, that drive is designated as: "Slot 6, Drive 2."
These slot and drive designation are purely historical. You do not need to
understand why your 5.25 inch disk drive is designated as a "Slot 6" disk
drive. To help you remember the slot designations of your drives, you may
want to attach a piece of masking tape, showing the slot designation, to
the front of the disk drive.

     In rare instances Apple IIe and IIc users may have a 3.5 inch
"UniDisk" disk drive attached to their computer. Such a disk drive would be
designated as "Slot 5, Drive 1."  The internal 3.5 inch disk drive on all
Apple IIc+ computers also has the designation of "Slot 5, Drive 1."

     When formatting disks with the System Utilities disk, the formatting
program will first check to see if there is any existing Apple II programs
or data on the disk. If there is, the program will prompt you to make sure
you truly intend to overwrite the existing material on disk. If you have
any doubts about what is contained on the disk, you can always press escape
and then go back and "Catalog" the disk. Doing so reveals the directory, or
table of contents of the disk.

     It may be helpful to know that it's possible to format a "double-
sided, double-density" floppy disk that was previously used on an IBM
computer system. There happen to be several gazillion of these lying around
now that homes and businesses are using high-density 3.5 inch floppy disks
for their data and programs.

     You can't, however, format a high-density IBM 5.25 inch floppy disk on
an Apple II disk drive. The formatting program will likely tell you: "Disk
is damaged," or, "Having problems accessing disk."   High density IBM 5.25
inch disks look almost identical to the standard "double-sided,
double-density" disks. The telltale difference is that the high-density
disks don't have a reinforcing circular ring in the middle of the disk.

     Another way to distinguish the two types of disks is the storage
capacity listed on the label of the disk.  Double-sided, double-density
disks have a capacity of 360 kilobytes (360K) on an IBM-style computer.
High-density IBM 5.25 inch disks have a capacity of 1.2 megabytes
(equivalent to 1200 kilobytes).

     When formatting a disk, you need to keep in mind the rules ProDOS has
for naming disks and naming files. The rules for both types of names are
identical.  Here they are:

     1) Names must be fifteen characters long, or less.

     2) Names must start with a letter, but may include numbers
        within the name.

     3) Spaces are not allowed within a name. But periods can be
        used within the name.

     It goes without saying that you should give a little thought to how
you name your files. Naming of disks is not as important. For reasons that
are too complicated to explain in a short space, it's often helpful to keep
your disk names short. You may even wish to name your disks with a single
letter. (Commonly, your first initial.)

     A third useful function of the System Utilities disk is to catalog a
disk. By cataloging a disk you can view the disk's directory, or table of
contents. This can be very useful when you need to refresh your memory
about which files are contained on a given disk. Cataloging a disk also
shows you how much free room is left on the disk.

     Knowing how much free room is left on a disk can be helpful in letting
you know when you need to format another data disk. If the System Utilities
disk indicates that you have less than 10K on a given disk, the time is
ripe to format another data disk.  For those of you who may be wondering
how much writing can fit in a given amount of disk space, you might recall
that 2K of disk space is roughly equivalent to a single typed,
double-spaced page. So a formatted ProDOS 5.25 inch disk holds (140K) holds
about 70 typed pages of writing. Likewise, a formatted 3.5 inch floppy disk
(800K) holds about 400 typed pages of writing.

     The Apple II System Utilities disk will catalog the older DOS 3.3
disks, as well as the newer ProDOS based disks.  Many of the earlier public
domain and shareware programs can be found on DOS 3.3 disks.  DOS 3.3 was
the standard disk operating system for the Apple II, up until ProDOS was
introduced in 1984. These two disk operating systems are incompatible with
one another, although it's possible to transfer text files quite easily
back forth between DOS 3.3 and ProDOS disks.

     A fourth useful function of the System Utilities disk is in deleting
files that you no longer need. It's not uncommon for someone to save some
writing that they've done, expecting that at some time in the future they
might possibly have a need for it. Two years later, they then discover,
that this earlier writing no longer has much usefulness.

     The System Utilities delete function can then be used to delete the
file that no longer has much use. By doing so you can free up disk space
that can be used for newer data.

     Some of the functions on the System Utilities disk are very seldom
used by anyone at all. You can use the System Utilities to lock and unlock
files. This simple procedure helps you protect against accidentally
overwriting a file that contains important information. Very few people
lock their files, however, because the whole idea advantage of using
computers is to update data files with newer, edited versions of the data.

     Another seldom used function of the System Utilities disk is the
function to create subdirectories. Subdirectories, also called folders, can
be helpful in organizing your files on a disk. But using subdirectories
requires that you have a mastery of ProDOS pathnames. Beginners can safely
stay away from subdirectories without missing out much.

     Even if you don't use its functions very often, it's good to be aware
of what the Apple II System Utilities disk can do.  And if you've bought a
second-hand Apple IIe, IIc, or IIc+ computer that didn't come with the
System Utilities disk, you would do well to get a copy of it from your
local Apple user group. The latest Apple II System Utilities disk is also
available for downloading from the Apple II libraries on GEnie, America
Online, and CompuServe.

HI EVERYBODY!   So, did you have any luck finding the Hairdressing
"""""""""""""   Roundtable mentioned in the April (fools) issue?  No, you
say?  He,he,he... Sorry but I just couldn't resist. ;-)

     Well, I hope everyone at least had a Happy Easter.  Mine was the usual
going to Church in the morning and then off to the family gathering for
Easter dinner.  So where is all this leading too?  Well, I'll tell ya...
While I was having Easter dinner I was thinking about how much work good
old Grandma had to go through to make all this great food and how maybe if
I knew a little something about cooking, I might be able to help her out
next time.  (Yes, I actually AM that nice of a guy :) So guess where I
decided to visit this month... oh, go ahead, take a guess...  That's right!
The Food and Wine Roundtable.  Here, you can swap your favorite recipes,
talk about kitchen equiptment, food preparation, starting a catering
business, writing a cookbook, wine-tasting, beer-brewing -- anything and
everything that has to do with food and wine is all here for the giving and
taking!  And all are welcome here... even the average Joe who knows next to
nothing about cooking, etc. -- like me!  <grin>  They even have their own
monthly newsletter called Nibbles & Bytes, which keeps you up to date on
RoundTable happenings, etc.

     So if your feeling guilty about not being able to help out good old
Grandma with Easter dinner and you want to make it up to her, or if you
just want to learn how to make your own beer <smile>, you owe it to
yourself to check out the Food and Wine Roundtable here on GEnie!  Just
type FOOD to get there.  But before you go, be sure and solve this month's
puzzle.  It'll help you learn some of that cool Food and Wine jargon.
Until next time...  Keep on smilin'!  Thanks Grandma!  :-)

I Have an Apple II. Now What?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
By Cynthia E. Field, Ph.D.
27 March 1991



AS COMPUTERS GO   the Apple II boasts a long and distinguished, if not
"""""""""""""""   unprecedented, history. The last 15 years have spawned
literally thousands of software programs, widening vistas for people of
every age and ability.  With an Apple II and the right software you can do
virtually n "Apple II Software Classics." Together, these directories can
help you find the software that's right for you.

     Needless to say, we couldn't include every noteworthy Apple II
program in this booklet's limited space. In "How Do I Get Started?" we
offer aI makes any communications job both satisfying and easy. Virtually
any word processing program can do the trick.

     Some word processors, such as Mouse Write, II Write and AppleWorks GS
1.1, have an easy-on-the-eyes screen appearance featuring menus you pull
down like window shades. Point to the File menu with a mouse. Pull down the
menu and click the mouse button to choose the Print option that's
displayed. In no time at all your thank-you note or letter is ready to
sign, seal, and deliver.

     So you never me to admit: Writing was never this easy when you were
in school.


Information Age   Organizing life's little details just got simpler, too.
"""""""""""""""   With a filing program like AppleWorks 3.0, AppleWorks GS
1.1, or DB Master Version Five, electronic address books and holiday card
lists are a cinch to edit and update. If you're active in sports leagues or
community groups, a computerized filing program is indispensable. Not only
can you track organization members, you can print the information on name
badges, RolodexThanks to modems and modern telecommunication s software
like Point-to-Point and ReadyLink, you can chat with other computer users
(more than a few romances have started this way), learn about new software
products, reserve airplane tickets, buy a microwave oven, and play a round
of chess with a distant and unseen competitor...all with a single phone
call.

     Innumerable special interest groups (SIGs) have evolved on BBSes
since personal computing's early days. Are you a Star Trek buff? Rest
assured there aremputer users nationwide who share your disdain for
Klingons. If you're retired, contact SeniorNet to learn about lifestyle and
legislative issues affecting you. SpecialNet's a SIG serving the needs of
special education and rehabilitation professionals. Computing may sometimes
seem a solitary pursuit, but just wait 'til you go online!


Chest Top Publishing   Politicians know you don't limit yourself to paper
""""""""""""""""""""   when it comes to sharing opinions. Why should Apple
II users be any different? Getting your message uce buttons, badges,
magnets, and key rings.  Projects like these aren't just fun to do--they're
perfect for gift giving and fund raising, as well.


Media Moguls   If you think pictures are worth a thousand words, picture
""""""""""""   this: With a desktop publishing program like Publish It!4,
AppleWorks GS 1.1, or GraphicWriter III, you can enhance nearly any message
with geometric shapes, colors, patterns, and illustrations. Best of all,
you don't have to be a graphics artist because desktop publishing programs
provideto make custom invitations or decorative banners--maybe even a
personalized Pin the Tail on the Donkey game poster--for your child's next
birthday party.

     Programs like The New Print Shop, The Print Shop IIGS, and
SuperPrint! handle these projects with gusto. Choose a typeface, type the
message you want, then select and position illustrations. That's all there
is to it!

     In short, a desktop publishing program may prove to be one of your
best software investments. Every day, countless Apple II users createle II
programs like On Balance, Managing Your Money 5.0, Quicken, and AlphaCheck
Plus take the drudgery out of setting up a budget and balancing the
checkbook.  Bill paying may be no less painful when your computer prints
checks for you, but at least the pain subsides more quickly.

     Personal finance programs help with long term planning, too.
Forecasting your tax liability during the year with a program like Swiftax
or Tax Preparer can keep April 15th from expanding into a 24-hour Maalox
Moment. Purchasing n software the easy way: Design templates that work with
programs such as AppleWorks 3.0 or AppleWorks GS. (For more information
about these special computer files, see "What's a Template Anyway?")

     Both AppleWorks 3.0 and AppleWorks GS are called "integrated"
programs because each includes more than a single application. With
AppleWorks 3.0 you get a word processor (with spell checker), a database
manager, and a spreadsheet program. Spreadsheets have math smarts built in,
so they're perfect for designing instance, thanks to an electronic
"Clipboard" feature. For value and performance, you can't top integrated
programs. One should appear near the top of your software shopping list.


That's Entertainment   To paraphrase an old saying, all work and no play
""""""""""""""""""""   mhe Hunt for Red October, a submarine simulation
based upon the popular Tom Clancy novel (and movie), or sign up for the
Halls of Montezuma, a military game. If your taste runs more to fantasy
adventure, try Pirates! or the King's Quest series.

     "Gimme some arcade action," you say? Look no further than Pipe Dream
or Senseless Violence II. Computer widows and widowers should be advised,
though:  These games are addicting!

     Apple II entertainment programs run the gamut from products like the
games mentioned ady Lab) accessory packs. Future rocket scientists should
explore In Search of Space:  Introduction to Model Rocketry if they haven't
yet been exposed to this challenging and enjoyable hobby. Products like
these turn your Apple II into a scientific workstation.

     Some of the best Apple II educational products--Where in the World Is
Carmen Sandiego? and Audubon Wildlife Adventures: Whales to name but
two--combine game-like sequences with stunning color graphics and realistic
sound effects.  Other programs, like Word Munchers or Math Blaster Plus,
cleverly disguise phonics or math facts with fast-paced arcade action.

     If study skills get a tad rusty, consider the assortment of "homework
helpers" available. Studymate can help you review class notes, while
Homeworker: The Student Organizer provides a word processor, outliner, and
grade keeper as well as a flashcard maker. Enjoy The Writing Adventure and
hone your composition skills at the same time. And for your next term paper
let World GeoGraph serPlatinum Paint, for example. This superb product has
all the tools you need to create artwork of any kind from simple
illustrations to professional paintings.  Most people quickly discover that
creating computer art is easier than "doing art" with traditional tools.

     At any one time, the Platinum Paint palette can feature 16 colors of
the 4096 available. Computer paints mix perfectly. Moreover, you can swap
colors or switch from pastel mode to charcoal mode by clicking on pull down
menu choices with the moua bundle on airfare--and brush up on their French
and Spanish at the same time--with Ticket to Paris and other programs in
the Ticket to... series of travel simulations.

     Sports card collectors can have a field day using databases like
Donruss Collectors Guide, Topps Collectors Guide, and Card Fax, a program
with information not just about baseball cards but about football and
basketball cards, as well. Philatelists and numismatists can manage their
investments with--what else?--Stamps or Coins.

     Even oento write their own programs from scratch in computer
languages such as AppleSoft BASIC, Assembly, Pascal, or C. While BASIC (an
acronym that stands for Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)
is by far the easiest programming language to learn and use, others require
considerable study and practice--not to mention special software for your
Apple II to "understand" these languages in the first place. Companies like
Apple Computer, Byte Works, Morgan Davis Group, Roger Wagner Publishing, So
What Soflled a "stack"; each screen display, a "card." Say you want to
prepare a presentation about birds of the tropical rain forest. You would
probably create a separate card, with pertinent facts and perhaps a
picture, for each species.

     You'd enliven your card with a variety of symbolic icons (pictures)
called "buttons." Adding a button is as easy as pulling down a menu to
invoke the program's "add a button" feature. When the user clicks on it,
the button may turn the page, so to speak, taking the viewer from ge you
face as an Apple II user is not learning how to use your computer--it's
deciding what to use your computer for. If the possibilities seem
mind-boggling at first, pace yourself. The Apple II has been around for a
long time and will continue to provid No one, it seems, has written a
program to referee the endless tennis matches played by health care
providers and Uncle Sam. And while there are dozens of grade book programs
available, none may offer the special mix of features you need.

     Thanks to programs like AppleWorks 3.0 and AppleWorksGS1.1 you
neither have to "do without" nor "make do." With less effort than you
think, you can design a custom template to tackle just about any project
you can dream up--whether it's remodeling the kitchen, designi Then give
your template a name and save the file on a data disk. After you write your
next letter with the AppleWorks GS word processor, electronically "paste"
the letter's text onto your letterhead template, which appears on screen in
a separate document "window." Then print the completed letter on your
printer.

     The same three steps apply to any task: Create the template, store it
on a data disk, and call it back to the computer screen when you wish. In
time, of course, you'll discover new ways to improt save any new versions
on a floppy disk. Toying with unlimited template ideas is one of the many
powerful things you can do with your Apple II.

     It may come as no surprise, then, that among millions of Apple II
users there are some entrepreneurial or altruistic types who create
ready-to-use templates for those of us who have neither the time nor the
inclination to design our own. Buying a template is often an inexpensive
way to tackle a project.  Moreover, studying templates designed by
experienced Apple Ibudget templates--or grade book templates!--the public
domain is a good place to start.

     Templates of higher quality usually command higher prices, too. Few
template disks cost more than $40, however. Most commercial disks hold ten
or more template projects. For example, Witkin's Best by AppleWorks 3.0
expert Ruth Witkin offers a dozen financial templates covering topics like
income taxes and investments. And each disk in the AppleWorks Productivity
Pak series from inCider/A+ Special Products features teneate personalized
birthday greetings.  If variety's the spice of your computing life, take a
subscription to SoftDisk, a "magazine on disk" featuring computer programs,
games, and clip art...as well as templates.

     Teachers searching for AppleWorks templates need look no further than
the Teachers' Idea & Information Exchange (TI&IE). For a modest membership
fee, TI&IE distributes monthly disks loaded on both sides with classroom
and administrative templates. Or put David Chesebrough's AppleWorks Teacher

ProTERM 3.1 FEATURES & CHANGES
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
General
"""""""
  <> User manual was re-written and expanded to 430 pages, and over 50
     illustrations. Help for the novice, casual user and expert.

  <> Enter Scrollback (when offline) at the touch of an ARROW key.

  <> When entering/exiting the Install menu, the terminal window is
     maintained.

  <> Text entry fields now have the concept of a "HARD-SPACE" and it is
     entered using OPTION-SPACEBAR. The HARD-SPACE is displayed using the
     checkerboard character mouse text character and works with Find,
     Replace, Reply mode and Printer-Init to name a few.

  <> There is now a Preference to control how much memory ProTERM will
     attempt to use when it runs. This is particularly useful for Slinky
     RAM users since it means they can partition their memory card between
     a RAM disk and ProTERM. Bank Switched RAM users, can partition their
     RAM cards in the event that ProTERM does not recognize the RAM-disk
     software being used.

  <> The parameters associated with Quick Dial are now saved between
     different Quick Dial attempts (not between program runs).

  <> Within the file selector:
      COMMAND-Left/Right-ARROW  Changes to the previous/next online volume.
              COMMAND-Up-ARROW  Moves to the Parent directory.
            COMMAND-Down-ARROW  Opens a directory.
            (These commands are Macintosh conventions.)

  <> Compatible with Textalker-GS vtt1.2 for sight impaired users.

  <> Pathnames allow the convention of drive location (/5,1/FILE.NAME -
     /6,2/MY.FILE etc.) entries.

  <> COMMAND-PERIOD is now equivalent to pressing the ESCAPE key.

  <> A Mouse-Down on the Date, Time, or Label in the Status-Bar
     automatically executes a Global Macro to perform user-defined
     functions.

  <> Editor Capture, Printer Capture and Receive ASCII now allow their
     status bars to be hidden.

  <> The Screen Saver now accepts a time out up to 30 minutes, and does not
     activate during an ASCII send.

  <> The File:Catalog command now displays as many files as can loaded into
     memory either alphabetically or as they are arranged in the file.

  <> The File:Print command now accepts batch filename selection. If
     multiple files are printed, then the setting of Eject Final Page
     determines whether each document is printed separately, or if they are
     all appended and print immediately following one another.

  <> The File:View command now displays location within text by screens and
     bytes and has a new Goto button for quick access to the screen number
     of choice.

  <> New management of incoming characters prevents character loss during
     mouse and COMMAND key use.

  <> A full 15 character volume name is allowed.

  <> Dramatic improvements in disk I/O error handling.


Emulation
"""""""""
  <> HeathKit H19 Emulation now supports a "mode-select" to enable Auto-CR
     to be added to an LF.

  <> Pascal Firmware emulation is now included as part of the software.

  <> Default parameters for Emulate File are now saved with the other
     preferences.

  <> Split-Screen Chat emulation now wraps the cursor after the 80th
     character instead of the 79th. (This is similar to the way VT-100
     works.)

  <> The emulation system has been changed so that a line which is cleared
     via a Clear-Line or Clear-to-End-of-Line from Col 0 now puts the line
     into Scrollback.

  <> VT-100 emulation has been changed so that margins are supported
     correctly. In prior versions, the vertical margins controlled both
     scrolling and clearing data (actual VT-100 terminals only control
     scrolling).

  <> There is now a Control Show emulation which does diagnostics similar
     to ProTERM 2.2 but also indicates high-bit data via reverse video.


Modem/Drivers
"""""""""""""
  <> Data Formats of 7E2 and 7O2 are now supported. While unusual, these
     are occasionally requested.

  <> When the ATDT dialing string is sent to the modem, it is truncated to
     the exact length instead of padding to 32 characters (the length of
     the phone number field). This assists compatibility problems with old
     modems.

  <> The USR HST driver works with the "/" messages added.

  <> A printer init string is now located in the install window. This
     string is sent to the printer prior to starting ANY kind of printer
     operation (print-screen, online printing, Editor printing, print
     file). This allows a clean to way to send a string to the port (like
     to change the baud rate) or to the printer (to always enable a certain
     font/size/etc).

  <> New modem drivers:
      - Quality Computers Q-Modem 2400.
      - Boca Research 14.4Kbps Modem.
      - Prometheus ProModem 2400 Mini.

  <> The size of the PT3.CODE0 file has been reduced by about 1/3 as
     compared to PT3.0. This saves some disk space and allows easier
     downloading of updated files.

  <> The baud (bps) of 57600 is now directly supported by the software. In
     addition, the SSC only shows rates of 110..19200 as being available.

  <> The driver loader / modem drivers have been redesigned to allow the
     possibility of user defined drivers. The modem drivers have all been
     recoded into assembly language and many of the existing drivers have
     been consolidated.

  <> It is possible to enable (via Macro pokes) a "data clicker" which can
     tick whenever a character is sent or received.

  <> There is now just a single Apple //gs Modem Port driver which exhibits
     better performance under GS/OS and AppleTalk.


The ProTERM Editor
""""""""""""""""""
  <> When data is inserted/deleted in the Editor, the Editor pans to show
     the change.

  <> The Editor now has a label in the MenuBar.

  <> There is a preference to "allow" use of the ruler. When turned off,
     PT3 will never save the ruler.

  <> It is now possible to View Files directly from the Editor. Choosing
     the "Edit" button inserts data at the current Editor cursor position.

  <> When exiting & re-entering the Editor (and Scrollback), the cursor
     position (line and column) is saved and restored.

  <> Find/Replace strings in the Editor are now saved between entry/exit of
     the Editor (and Scrollback).

  <> Paste-to-Modem directly from the Editor is changed and improved.

  <> A customized prompt string used and saved as a preference in Reply
     formatting.

  <> When a file smaller than 13 lines is loaded into the Editor, the
     display correctly positions the small file on the opening screen.


Macros
""""""
  <> PRint commands now work in the Editor and the Channel #6 command can
     be used to insert (print) data directly in the Editor at the cursor
     position.

  <> ProTERM always executes global Macro @@1 on startup. It then checks
     for a Macro file called PT3.STARTUP or a system entry called
     PTD.STARTUP. As before, an application can also pass in the name of a
     Macro file or system entry via the PT3.SYSTEM program.

  <> The Macro MIdstring command now supports a length parameter.

  <> There is now a JSr Macro command which can be used to call assembly
     language code. One potential use is to allow flow control to be
     enabled and disabled directly from a Macro.

  <> DO command parameter processing has been improved so that it is now
     possible to write a Macro which will work in Install.

  <> The MEm Macro command now accepts a hex string of data as a compact
     way to specify the contents of continuous memory locations. Ex: MEm
     30,"a9904c0034"

  <> Larger Macro files are now supported.

  <> There are new <SYstem> and <PHone> functions which return the name and
     phone number of the current system.

  <> The SEMICOLON is now used as a comment character. It signifies
     comments than extend from the SEMICOLON to the end of the line. Large
     blocks of text can be commented out when placed between ASTERISKS.

  <> The DO command now allows duplicate label names to be accessed.

  <> Full 64 character filenames can be passed to dialogs via the DO
     command (3.0 had a 40 character limit).


Scrollback
""""""""""
  <> The Find/Replace strings in the Scrollback are now saved between
     entry/exit of the Scrollback (and the Editor).

  <> Scrollback now has a label in the MenuBar.

  <> When you exit & re-enter Scrollback, your position (line and column)
     is saved and restored (this is also true in the Editor). When the
     contents of Scrollback are changed (via data coming into terminal
     mode), the position is reset to the end of the file.

  <> Upon entry to Scrollback .5K is no longer added to the status bar
     display.

  <> The Find-Next command in Scrollback is now COMMAND-G instead of
     COMMAND-N to maintain consistency with the Editor and Macintosh
     conventions.

  <> The search string/parms used with Find-Next are now saved between uses
     of Scrollback (but not between program runs).

  <> When an old Scrollback file is opened, its contents can be appended to
     the end of the current Scrollback data.

  <> Scrollback files can be appended to an existing Scrollback file.


Send & Receive
""""""""""""""
  <> Paste-to-Modem now has better pacing. When it sends a RETURN
     character, it uses the line delay parameter for the current system
     entry.

  <> Ymodem and Zmodem both send filenames in lower case in consideration
     of Unix based hosts and the like.

  <> Protocol transfer estimated time values have been recalculated making
     them more accurate.

  <> The status bar now displays the exact line rate at which the modem is
     connected. This includes 12000, 14400 and 16800. In addition, ASCII
     Send and protocol transfer timings are based on this value.

  <> The protocol CPS calculation has been improved so that it more
     accurately reflects the actual transfer throughput.

  <> There is now control over the Zmodem Send window size via a Macro
     variable.

  <> Global Macros @@5/@@6 are now automatically executed after every
     protocol transfer to perform user-defined operations.
                 (INTREC, CAT24, TOP6, MSG:1/M645)


ProTERM 3.1 FEATURES - GENERAL
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

  <> Full Dialing List with many changeable parameters for each system
     including: Name, Phone Number, Baud Rate, Data Format, Duplex, Flow
     Control, Emulation, Per Min/Hour Cost, Backspace, System Macros and
     many others.

  <> General System Support -
      - Baud Rate Support: 110 to 19200, (38400 and 57,600 with
         Apple IIGS modem port).
      - Data Format Support: 7E1, 7O1, 8N1, 8N2, 7E2 & 7O2.
      - Duplex: Full/Half.
      - Flow Control: Software or Hardware.

  <> Scrollback saves all incoming text as it scrolls off the screen so
     that it may be later read, searched, printed, saved, clipped or edited
     while on or offline. Save long distance costs and access charges by
     doing your work offline.

  <> Auto-Start Protocols allow hands-off download operations. Simply tell
     the remote host system to start sending files via Zmodem or Kermit and
     ProTERM detects the start of the transfer and begins receiving the
     data without user intervention.

  <> AutoLearn Macros allow automatic logon without user intervention. Call
     a host once in AutoLearn mode and with a keystroke, subsequent logons
     are automatic and effortless.

  <> Full utilization of ProDOS compatible clocks to display date & time,
     time connected, connect costs and protocol performance. Connect costs
     can be displayed in real time and/or saved for later reference.

  <> ProTERM's full word processor supports both text and AppleWorks files.
     Create text documents offline then: Save, Print or Send text (either
     all or selected text) directly to a remote host system from the
     Editor. Special "filters" perform case, paragraph and reply
     conversion. Use character oriented selection to Cut and Paste within
     documents. Upload documents directly from the Editor to a remote host.
     Paste Scrollback text directly to the ProTERM Editor and then edit,
     print or upload your reply to any host.

  <> Editor Reply Feature allows included text to be prefixed by custom
     reference markers.

  <> Screen "snapshots" can be sent to the printer from anywhere within
     ProTERM.

  <> Sophisticated Terminal Emulations: ANSI-BBS, ADDS, ADM-3A/5, TeleVideo
     910 & 910+, H19, VT-52, VT-100, ProTERM Special Emulation, Split
     Screen Chat, Pascal Firmware and Control Show allows easy access to
     small BBSystems as well as large mainframes.

  <> Split-Screen Chat allows real-time conferencing without confusing text
     mix-up. Log on in normal mode and then toggle in and out of
     split-screen mode with a single keypress.

  <> Control Show Emulation displays all incoming data in a visible format
     including control and high-bit characters.

  <> Emulate File feature allows files containing emulation codes to be
     viewed while offline. Use the keyboard to adjust the display speed.
     View ProTERM Special Emulation files at any speed without line noise
     problems.

  <> Complete formatting control using Dot Commands. Documents are
     impressive and easier to read when formatted with text justification,
     precise margin control, page numbering, headers, footers and more.
     ASCII uploads of documents with custom "on-the-fly" formatting is easy
     and enjoyable.

  <> Print Preview allows documents formatted with Dot Commands to be
     viewed in their final form "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG)
     before they are printed or uploaded.

  <> Easy File Transfers using the latest selection of protocols available
     for the Apple II, including: Xmodem/Ymodem (4K option), Zmodem and
     Kermit. Supports both file and batch modes, "on-the-fly" Binary II
     encoding & decoding and Zmodem Resume/CRC-32.

  <> Preference Window allows customization of many program parameters,
     protocol options and commonly used pathnames.

  <> ProTERM's Screen Saver activates automatically and darkens the screen
     after one to thirty minutes of non-activity.

  <> Programmable Delete key allows the Delete key to function as desired
     for each individual system.

  <> Copies easily to any disk media. ProTERM is ProDOS based and not copy
     protected.

  <> Full keyboard support, extended keyboards and/or mouse devices.
     Emulating terminals with function keys is a snap when using extended
     keyboards.

  <> Unattended Operation allows secure remote access to your computer.
     Password protection keeps you in control as guests call your computer
     and exchange files.

  <> Incoming data can be routed to the printer, Editor or saved to a file.
     Either "raw" data (with all the emulation codes intact) or processed
     lines (which look like the display) can be saved.

  <> HotKeys feature can be turned on allowing single keystroke commands.

  <> Easy File Selection System allows files to be selected quickly with a
     minimum of keystrokes. Alphabetized files in directories are easy to
     find. Typing the first few characters finds files automatically.
     Novice users can easily navigate through ProDOS directories using
     ProTERM.

  <> Complete disk utilities include: Copy, Delete, and Rename Files or
     directories. Catalog, Print Files, View Files, Set File Info, Create
     Directories and Format Disks. Set File Info allows filetypes to be
     changed, making it easy to work with files from non-Apple hosts.

  <> Protocol Transfer Status window shows:
      - Current transfer progress  - Estimated transfer time
      - Percent completed          - Protocol options
      - Current status             - Number of files remaining to send.

  <> After a transfer is complete, a protocol statistics window can show:
      - Number of files transferred
      - Total size of the transfer
      - Transfer termination status.
   Systems with a clock show:
      - Start & end time, and characters per second/minute.

  <> ProTERM memory management utilizes all available system memory (even
     "Slinky" style RAM cards) to support separate Editor, Transfer,
     Code-Cache and Scrollback buffers. "Slinky" RAM Cards can be
     partitioned between ProTERM and RAM Disks.

IT'S HERE & IT'S NEW! PROTERM 3.1   Again -- ProTERM improves to meet
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   current needs!  The winner of two
Awards of Excellence for "Best Apple II Software" just got better! Author
Greg Schaefer released ProTERM 1.0 in the late 1980's and subsequent
updates through 2.1 gave ProTERM users what they asked for.  InSync
Software, Inc. published an improved ProTERM 2.2 in Spring 1990, and after
eighteen months of intense development, ProTERM 3.0 was born in late 1991.

     ProTERM provides Apple II computer users with current and state of
the art telecommunications. Completely redesigned and written
"from-scratch," version 3.0 was a demonstration of extraordinary
engineering combining incredible new features, while maintaining the best
of all previous versions. Meeting the challenge of current technology, a
new improved ProTERM 3.1 was released in Spring of '93.

     NOTE: To insure a stronger tradename protection, InSync Software,
Inc., changed its name to InTrec Software, Inc. in early '93.

 The update package includes:

  <> ProTERM 3.1 on 3.5 and a 5.25 disks.
  <> New 430 page user manual. Over 100 new pages of how to do it help.
  <> "Jump Start" Quick-Help reference.
  <> Quick Reference cards.
  <> Registration materials.
  <> Sign-up kits for CompuServe, Delphi, Genie, CRS &
      Dow Jones News/Retrieval.
