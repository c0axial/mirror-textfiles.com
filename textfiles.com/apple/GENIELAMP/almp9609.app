        >>> "I HAD A WEE BOUT, BUT DR. MCCOY PULLED ME THROUGH" <<<
        """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     I got a summer vacation this year.  It was my first such in five 
years.  I may never do it again.

     The vacation itself was delightful.  I was embarrassed that my 
parents had to pay our airfare home--I'm still without any kind of day 
job--and there was one serious hitch, but I was glad to be back in the 
province where I grew up.  My wife and I had a splendid four weeks, with 
spectacular weather.

     Coming back from the vacation was a workaholic's nightmare.  I've 
agreed to edit two book manuscripts--both late when I got them--and cannot 
begin work on either until I finish the September GenieLamp A2.  The issue 
that you're reading now was already late by the time my (return) plane 
landed.  And I hadn't been able to work on the 'Lamp during my 
vacation--praise heaven!--so I had to start work knowing that the clock was 
ticking.

     Before I could even begin, I had to tell my CoPilot to collect all 
the messages that had been posted to the A2 RoundTable bulletin board in 
the four weeks I'd been absent.  I had an idea there would be a lot of 
messages, so I had to move and delete files on one hard drive partition to 
make room for the messages.  It was a good thing I did that; there were 
well over 2 megabytes worth.

     Once I had collected the backlog of messages, I had to read them--all 
of them--carefully--in order to produce the HEY MISTER POSTMAN message 
digest.  It took two full days just to read that many.  I confess that I 
skimmed once or twice, but not oftener.  Once the messages were read, I 
could begin to put together the digest.  Once HEY MISTER POSTMAN was done, 
I could begin to write and edit.

     I hope this explains why this issue was 9 days late.  Next month's 
issue will be on time, since I won't be over 1000 miles away from my 
computer.

     Incidentally, folks, as soon as I finish uploading all five editions 
of this issue, I had to start moving the back issues into the A2 
RoundTable.  The back issues used to live in the DigiPub RoundTable, but 
that RT closed in mid-July.  Look for GenieLamp A2 back issues in the A2 RT 
starting very soon.

     This month, Peter Brickell begins a column on the Real World Apple.  
I hope it will excite you as much as it does me.  Already I've got an idea 
for a simple little program I can use in the kitchen....

"""""""""""""""""""""   With zoom out (can't see printer options), type one 
line, hit return.  OA-O to insert any printer options (such as a new cpi or 
margin).  Now type a second line.  Move the cursor to the first line, then 
to the end of the line with a OA->.  Now hit OA-Del (as though you wished 
to remove the return character and bring the two lines together).  Ooops!

     To see what's happening, do it again with zoom in (see printer

CONNECTING H-P DESKJET 600C TO GS   I recently installed an HP DeskJet 600 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   on my Rom 3.  Piece of cake...  You 
=will= need a parallel card.  I ordered mine -- the Q Print II by 
Sequential Systems -- from Scantron Quality Computers.  It comes with the 
proper cable, so don't let anyone tell you that you need to buy a cable 
when you purchase your DeskJet.

     The docs that come with the DeskJet will help you set up your 
printer, and the Q Print II docs will tell you what you need to know to 
install the card in a IIGS slot and connect it to our printer.  As soon as 
you get your driver software installed and configured, you'll be all set.  
Doesn't take long at all.

     Good luck ...

FOR SALE:  PARTS FOR FASTER ZIP GS   After over a year of testing chips 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   from various manufacturers, I have 
acquired a supply of chips which test as being reliable for use in ZipGSx 
ver 1.02 accelerators at speeds above 10 mhz.  At this point the highest 
speed I have been able to achieve for reliable operation in a Rom 01 is 
16mhz at 64k cache.

     It must be noted that at high speeds it is not just the ZipGSx and 
its chips that become critical for successful reliability.  Every aspect of 
the computer becomes more critical as speed demands are increased.  As a 
point of reference, the Rom 01 which I use for primary testing is generally 
equipped with standard power supply, 4meg memory (Ram-GS, Sequential 
Systems), RamFast Rev D with 3.01f ROM, and Sound Meister audio card.  The 
only modification I have made to the computer itself is removal of the RF 
shield from the CPU cover.  I have not found any negative effects on my 
other electronics from this change, but have found a 2 - 3 mhz increase in 
reliable speed.

     I do swap other cards into the test machine for comparison, and nave 
found that at speeds above 12 mhz I have not been able to operate with any 
of the Applied Engineering memory cards which I have here. The Apple HS and 
rev C SCSI cards which I have here do not seem to have negative effects on 
reliability.

     IOW your mileage _will_ vary, depending on your equipment.  Making a 
serious attempt to get maximum speed _may_ require evaluating (possibly 
improving) every aspect of your system.

     The setup of the ZipGSx has been previously posted by Harold Hislop.  
The only changes to standard version 1.02 production cards that are 
required are:

     The Oscillator needs to be socketed, to enable speed changes.
     The TAG memory sockets must accept narrow (300 mil) chips.
     The DATA memory sockets must accept wide (600 mil) chips.
     The CPU must be -14 rated.  A high quality CPU connector cable from 
Bill Shuff (or equivalent, if you can find one somewhere else) must be used 
for best performance.

     I am making tested SRAM chip sets (4 chips per set) for 64k cache 
available, effective immediately.  Each set will have successfully passed 
testing at the stated speed, in a Rom 01 machine, for at least 3 days 
before shipment.

     Tested sets will be available at speeds up to 16mhz.

     Prices and conditions of sale will be announced in a following 
message.

<<<<<   The following prices and conditions apply to 32k and 64k sets of
"""""   SRAM that I am offering for use in ZipGSx version 1.02 
accelerators.

     Each set will be tested as a set, at the stated speed, in a Rom 01 
GS, for at least 72 hours.  Tests consist of (a) extended simultaneous 
display of GIF images and playing of music files, (b) test of 8 bit 
function (AW classic, 200k Spreadsheet calculations).

     Each set 32k set consists of two chips, one 8 X 32 -20 narrow (300 
mil) for use as TAG memory on the ZipGSx, and one 8 X 32 -35 wide (600 mil) 
for use as DATA memory on the ZipGSx.  Each 64k set consists of two 32k 
sets. The ZipGSx on which these will be installed must be equipped with:

     (a) socketed oscillator
     (b) TAG DIP sockets capable of accepting 300 mil (narrow) SRAM
     (c) DATA DIP sockets capable of accepting 600 mil (wide) SRAM
     (d) WDC 65c816-14 CPU chip

The following are highly recommended for anyone attempting serious speed 
improvement:

     (a) a Bill Shuff ZipGSx CPU cable (e-mail W.Shuff@Genie.com)
     (b) a good selection of oscillators of various speeds.

     Due to wide variance in the quality and extent of equipment attached 
to individual IIgs computers, I cannot guarantee that any specific system 
will achieve the stated speed capability of the chips supplied, or of the 
ZipGSx.  The chip sets will covered by limited warranty for 6 months:  the 
conditions of warranty are that the chips will function at the maximum 
speed your system will support, up to the rated speed.  If you cannot 
achieve a speed satisfactory to you the chips will be returnable for 
replacement or refund, subject to a 10% service charge.  If the chips will 
not pass my retest after return, the 10% charge will not be applied.

DEVELOPER SUPPORT FOR SECOND SIGHT   Sequential been giving me the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   run-around for several months now.  
Joseph (head honcho, I believe) told me that there is a firmware update 
being worked on by a third party and keeps promising to put me in contact 
with the developer but nothing has happened yet.  I don't think he knows 
what's going any more than anyone else there.

     As a developer, trying to work with the card has been very 
frustrating.  There are so many problems with the current firmware and the 
lack of important pieces of information or any assistance from Sequential 
has greatly impaired development of SS-aware software.  I certainly 
couldn't recommend the purchase of a Second Sight to anyone unless you're 
one of that needs to replace your IIgs monitor, and even then, a 
replacement monitor is probably less than the SS.

     Finally, on the QuickDraw stuff, unless someone else is working on it 
as well, it won't be part of any system software update (I'm not even sure 
what you are talking about here).  It will be a separate commercial 
product.  However, unless SS gets its act together and fixes the firmware 
problems, performance is going to be extremely disappointing.

the concept of using disk images with Gus.  Gus makes extensive use of disk 
images, something that Apple II users do not often encounter. 

     A recent edition of TidBITS (TidBITS#339/05-Aug-96, to be exact) 
contained an excellent piece by Chad Magendanz that goes a long way towards 
telling the Apple IIgs aficionado everything they ever wanted to know about 
Disk Images (there ain't much to know, it's a dirt simple concept, once you 
think about it).  Due to TidBITS restrictions on reposting articles on "for 
profit" locations, I can't upload it to the library here.  But what I have 
done is extracted the article and attached it to the Gus Information Page 
on the WWW. 

     Take a look.  And for those of you that have registered yourselves on 
the page, if you get an email notice in the next few days that the Gus page 
has changed, that's what has changed (the addition of the disk image

     I don't know about GuS, but Bright Software's GS emulator - Fast 
Eddie - can currently run the European software that came with custom 
loaders.  At this point, that's about all Fast Eddie can run.  But, it does 
it, and it does it with music.

     That said...I think Fast Eddie got a little side-tracked in the past 
month, while Bright Software worked on Flame Station and Flame Station XL.  
Once they stop laughing, maybe we'll hear some more about Fast Eddie.

something like that) which does the same thing.  And you should always be 
using the Finder's Shutdown command to reboot, anyway, from GS/OS. (or use

VIDEOTAPE OF MARK TWAIN AVAILABLE   A few months ago, I gave a presentation 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   at the GravenStein Apple User Group 
about the Mark Twain IIGS Prototype computer.  The proceedings were 
videotaped.

     I finally got a chance to view the (approximately) 90 minute video, 
and it came out fine.  Sort of.  I'm not a professional speaker or actor 
and the person shooting the video is just a video hobbyist, so it's 
certainly not in the same league, quality wise, as some of Apple's 
professionally produced videos.

     But, the video does provide a close-up of the Mark Twain computer.  
For some reason, the tape stops before we had a chance to completely 
disassemble the computer, as we did that day.  I guess you could think of 
the video as a Semi-Guided Tour Of The Computer That Could Have Changed The 
World (tm).  Additional segments of the tape show a IIe Prototype, a 
pre-release version of Wolfenstein 3-D and Brutal Deluxe's System 6.0.2.

     A video will be available, at some point in the near-future, from the 
GravenStein Apple User Group.  The projected price for the video is $20, 
although that could change.  All proceeds from the sale of the video will 
go to the treasury of the GravenStein Apple User Group.

information about the GravenStein Apple User Group, come visit the

NETWORKING TO MACS AND PCS   It is my understanding that GS/TCP, when

networking GSes with GSes, and GSes with Macs and PCs.

     When I visited with Derek Taubert, he had a localtalk network up and 
running through GS/TCP that included his IIGS, his NeXT workstation and his 
wife's Windows machine across the room.

     Of course, GS/TCP is not on the market yet.  But it will certainly 
present some interesting networking possiblities when it is.

            THE REAL WORLD APPLE /

Connecting to the World Outside
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

        [P.BRICKELL]



              >>> PART 1:  VENTURING INTO THE REAL WORLD <<<
              """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Since the first day I got my second-hand Apple II Plus back in 1989, 
I was convinced that my computer could do more than read disks, draw 
pictures on its screen, and print out my ramblings on a piece of paper.  
Certainly my purchase of an old 300 bps modem and joining Genie made me 
feel that the computer and I were no longer alone in the electronic jungle.  
Still, I felt that my new acquisition needed to stretch out beyond the 
walls of its plastic case and do some "real work" in the world.

     As I cast my gaze around my apartment full of Apple II driven 
devices, I can't imagine a computer that simply sits on my desk and munches 
characters and numbers.  Sure, my Zipped, SCSI'd, and scanner-equipped IIe 
does a great job of that (after all, I've just finished producing my 
Masters thesis on it), but I have discovered a whole additional side to my 
Apple II's.

     I would like to share that with those of you who have an interest in 
computer interfacing.  It is not terribly difficult and I have never had to 
take tools of any kind to my beloved Apples!  Everything that I have done 
uses the Apple II's game I/O port for controlling and monitoring real world 
devices.  I am referring to the 16 pin socket which the older style 
joysticks are plugged into.  Unfortunately the IIc machines don't have this 
connector and can't be used easily with these projects.  On the bright side 
however, all the devices that I have built work beautifully on a 48K Apple 
II Plus.  These machines can be had for a song these days; so experimenting 
is not expensive.

     In the following series of articles about my interfacing projects, I 
will be assuming a minimal amount of electrical knowledge.  You will need 
to know how to solder, but the books that I will shortly recommend cover 
this, the detailed plans for the projects, and also the necessary 
electronic basics.  In addition, some of the _real_  A2 hardware experts 
here on Genie have posted advice for technical newbies on these basic 
skills.  So check out the A2 Libraries and RTC for additional information.  
What I'm going to describe isn't rocket science, but it is a whole lot of 
fun and very rewarding too!

     To begin with, I'd like to give you a little taste of what is 
possible with an "obsolete" 48K Apple computer.  I hope this will get your 
interest going so that you will go out and create your own uses for that 
Apple in your closet or on your desk.

     My first foray into interfacing came when my darkroom timer sang its 
last song and left me in the lurch.  It was a simple mechanical affair 
which let me "program" any number of consecutive timing steps up to 30 
minutes duration.  My photographic work required up to 10 steps.  A quick 
trip to the local photographic store revealed that this little $25 device 
was no longer made.  After the salesperson showed me to a new digital timer 
which could handle a whopping 3 steps at a cost of $500, I knew that I 
would have to find another way!  

     After buying $10 worth of shielded cable and investing several hours 
in Applesoft, I had rigged up an Apple darkroom timer which not only rang 
at the end of each timing step, but also beeped each time I was due to 
shake my developing tank or turn over a developing print.  What luxury!  
After that there was no turning back on the road to Apple II interfacing.

     It wasn't long before I needed a reliable way to control the 
temperature in my cold-water aquarium.  This required measuring the water 
temperature and turning on and off a chiller.  The chiller was tricky, 
since it could not be switched on and off quickly without damaging the 
compressor.  I would need some way to delay the on and off switching for a 
few seconds, as well as knowing when to do it.  It turned out to be no 
match for Applesoft and a combination of a couple of projects described in 
an Apple II interfacing workbook that I had acquired from Resource Central.  

     After a few months of reliable operation, I decided that what was 
good enough for the fish was good enough for me.  Enter the air conditioner 
controller for my apartment!  No longer did I have to come home to a 
sweltering apartment because I had been environmentally friendly and turned 
off the AC while on vacation.  Now I just set the number of hours that I 
would like the unit to stay dormant, and a couple of hours before my 
return, the trusty ][ Plus turns on the air conditioner for me.  
Thereafter, it provides precision temperature control for my living 
quarters.

     Similarly, when in the depths of the Canadian winter, I am no longer 
subjected to poorly controlled baseboard heating.  The "winter version" of 
the software dutifully operates my portable heater at the same level of 
precision as the air conditioning in summer.

     My last interfacing project was one for the workbench.  Those of you 
who have Nicad battery operated tools and cleaning devices will most likely 
understand the consequences of frequently partly discharging these 
batteries before recharging them--the dreaded "memory effect".  Worse than 
this is when they are left forgotten on a fast charger.  The usual result 
is a trip to the repair facility for a costly new battery pack.  I thought, 
"Wouldn't it be nice to have one of those smart chargers which fully 
discharges the batteries before charging them and then switches to a safe 
trickle charge when finished?"  The only problem that I could see was the 
$1500 price tag for one of these babies  Once again an Apple II came to the 
rescue.  I now have a fully functional "smart charger" for about $25 and a 
time share on a ][ Plus.

     I hope that this has whetted a few appetites for interfacing.  Before 
I finish, I must recommend the books which have made it possible for me to 
do all this.  I knew very little of electronics or interfacing until I got 
Vernier Software's "How to Build a Better Mousetrap".  This is a work book 
for high school level students and teachers in the sciences and 
electronics.  It goes through the basic concepts and techniques needed to 
build the 26 interfacing projects which are described  within its pages.  
Both "Mousetrap" and its sister publication "Chaos in the Laboratory" are 
an excellent source of information and ideas on computer interfacing--and 
they are all Apple II.  My projects are either straight from the books or 
are adaptations of their projects.  I cannot recommend these books highly 
enough (BTW, I have no affiliation with Vernier Software--only good 
experiences dealing with them and their products).  

     In addition, some of the projects described in the books are 
available from Vernier as kits.  This will be a plus for those who don't 
live near a ready source of electronics parts.  The company can be reached 
through David Vernier at "dvernier@vernier.com" for pricing and ordering of 
these books.  For those wanting to take only an exploratory plunge into 
this field, I would recommend "How to Build a Better Mousetrap" as a good 
starting point.

     Next month--Getting started with timers and the game port.

Yours For the Downloading
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



                 >>> IT FEELS JUST LIKE STARTING OVER <<<
                 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This summer, I planned on giving my parents a hard drive for their 
Apple IIgs.  (It didn't happen--someone let me down--but that's another 
story.)  My parents don't use their GS much, but their grandchildren do.  I 
wanted to faster disk access for the grandkids and for the grandparents.

     The principal reason for buying a hard drive for my parents' computer 
was to install copies of three pieces of software that were big hits with 
the grandchildren, even when on slow 3.5" drives--McGee, McGee at Katie's 
Farm, and McGee at the Fun Fair.  My parents also own a simple word 
processor, and I know they avoid it because it takes so long to load.

     I didn't want to stop at tweaking the software they already have.  I 
wanted to show my parents that there was a whole new world waiting for 
them--a lot more than word processing and McGee.

     The problem was, once I had paid for a RAM card and a hard drive, I 
didn't have any money left for software.  The solution is obvious:  
freeware and public domain software.

     I scoured Genie's libraries for free software for my parents and 
their grandkids.  I found a lot.  Then I threw away absolutely everything 
that would give an Apple II critic the chance to complain about how crummy 
free Apple II software really was.  That didn't leave a lot, but what was 
left was top-quality goods.

     The experience was valuable, and you're about to reap the benefit of 
it, as I list the Apple IIgs software I could not bear to be without (and 
the file numbers for those who want to download it from Genie):


CLASSIC DESK ACCESSORIES   I happen to love CDAs, and always have.  There 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   are wonderful new desk accessories as well, but 
I love the classics.  Their only drawback is that new computer users aren't 
going to remember the Escape-Control-Command key press necessary to get to 
the CDA menu... but there are ways of dealing with that.


File.A.Trix (Karl Bunker)   Put this one at the top of your list.  This 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''   file management CDA lets you type files, check 
out the disk directory, delete and copy files, initialize disks, and search 
for files.  It works from with ProDOS, too.  (File #21352, FILE.A.TRIX.BXY)

SHR.ScreenSaver (Dale T. Taylor and Tony Ward)   If you have a paint 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   program, better include 
this.  Kids love to save screens and then mess with them.  I might never 
teach my parents how to use this--partly because you have to go hunting for 
its SCREEN files--but I'll bet my 9-year-old nephew will use it.  (File 
#24116, SHR.SAVER.BXY)

     I've deliberately chosen very few CDAs to keep the menu uncluttered.  
There are lots of other useful but not vital CDAs I might have chosen:  
Calendar, Print Screen, Calculator Demo, and Inverter.  I also left out 
CDAs that I thought my parents might not see the significance of:  Quit To, 
GameHacker, and MiniTalk.

NEW DESK ACCESSORIES   You must take care when choosing NDAs for new 
""""""""""""""""""""   computer users.  New users may never discover the 
NDA menu, so choose as many NDAs as possible that have some effect without 
needing the user to activate it.  For the rest, choose desk accessories 
that have simple, obvious, and harmless effect.

Calculator (Dan Hitchens and Dave Lyons)   This NDA is not only 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   non-threatening, it's something 
even the newest computer user will admit is practical.  Admittedly, turning 
on--or even owning!--a GS just to get at a calculator doesn't make a lot of 
sense, so expect some initial scoffing.  But just wait until they've 
misplaced every calculator in the house...!  (Found on the System Disks, 
specifically in :SystemTools1:System:Desk.Accs:)

Find.File.V1.2 (Stephen Chick)   This NDA is a little technical for the 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   true beginner, but I included in my list 
for two reasons.  The first is that it's so much better than Apple's own 
file-finding NDA, which comes with and is installed by System 6.0.1.  The 
second is that anyone who uses a word processor or even a text editor is 
going to misplace a file.  (File #10567, FINDFILE.BXY)

Hermes (Andre Horstmann)   This text editor NDA not only allows new users 
''''''''''''''''''''''''   to jot down notes, but it serves well in the 
Finder, since it will automatically open text and AppleWorks word processor 
files  If a new user is confronted with the Finder, the more file types 
that s/he can click on and actually have something happen, the better.  
(File #25304, HERMES.BXY)

LazyPepo (Tom Tooly Software)   This NDA does one thing:  go to the Classic 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Desk Accessory menu.  Great for those who 
can't remember Escape-Control-Command.  Two problems:  the name doesn't 
give a newbie any idea what the purpose of this NDA might be, and the 
programmer didn't follow the guidelines--try selecting this one from within 
Quick Click Calc, and watch the menu bar closely.  (File #16911, 
LAZYPEPO.BXY)

ShowMe (Dave Leffler)   Looking at pictures will keep an explorer's 
'''''''''''''''''''''   interest for a while, but that's not the only 
reason I recommend this picture-viewing NDA be installed.  It also has a 
Finder extra function, so that Finder newbies can click on pictures and 
animations and see them.  (File #23435, SHOWME1.1.1.BXY)

     Some users report that having this NDA installed makes their system a 
little flaky.  Others report no problems.  There is another option--Eye by 
Chris McKinsey (file #22083, EYE1.1.BXY)--but it's a $10 shareware item.  
Eye will also let you view bitmapped fonts, which ShowMe won't, and also 
shows you the contents of BIN files.

SoundIt (Rolf Braun)   Here's an NDA that will play rSounds, HyperStudio 
''''''''''''''''''''   sounds, ACE sounds, and even raw binary sounds (file 
type BIN).  It also optionally functions as Finder extension, so new users 
can click on these files and hear a result immediately.  It doesn't play 
any music files, such as synthLAB or SoundSmith.  (File #25884, 
SOUNDIT10.BXY)

MenuTime (Jay Krell) $5   There are plenty of NDAs that will put a clock in 
'''''''''''''''''''''''   the menu bar, so why am I recommending Jay 
Krell's $5 shareware item?  Simply because it doesn't interfere with 
Spectrum... and there are darned few clocks that don't cause character loss 
with that telecommunications program.  If you don't use Spectrum, there are 
other menu-bar clocks with more functions, but too many to list.... (File 
#16722, MENUTIME.BXY  V3.33)


INITS (PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY)   You put Inits in System:System.Setup:, or 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   in System:FinderExtras, or sometimes in 
either one.  Some Inits are of no benefit to anyone who does not run the 
Finder, but others are of benefit to all.  Let's look at the Inits that 
anyone can use:

Init Restarter (Matt Deatherage)   Init Restarter (or Init Runner) allows 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   CDAs, NDAs, inits, GS/OS drivers, and 
Finder Extensions to be installed "on the fly" rather than at boot time.  
This makes it possible for beginners to point-and-click on still more items 
from the Finder.  If not using the Finder, IR can be used in conjunction 
with a new desk accessory such as IRNDA to allow loading from within any 
desktop program.  (From the A2Pro library:  file #3451, IR2.0.2.BXY)

GUPP (Nathan Mates)   Mates's Grand Unified Program Patcher takes care of a 
'''''''''''''''''''   number of bugs, and no Apple IIgs should be without 
it.  It's totally invisible to the user, but makes for smoother operation.  
(File #27509, GUPP1.03.BXY)

AccentIt (Rolf Braun)   This small TIF forces a reset of keyboard 
'''''''''''''''''''''   translation to standard, making it possible to use 
the extended character set while typing.  This is necessary because 
software seems to reset the translation to none a good deal.  New users 
find they can no longer use special characters, don't know why, and don't 
know how to fix the problem.  (File #23744, ACCENT.IT.BXY)

RemoveAltDispMod (Jay Krell)   Another short TIF, this removes "Alternate 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Display Mode" from the Classic Desk 
Accessory menu.  This option does no harm, but often confuses new users.  
If you expect the IIgs to be used to play old 5.25" games, you should NOT 
install this one, because old games occasionally use this.  (File #23137, 
REMALTDISP.BXY)

     (While you're cleaning up the Classic Desk Accessory menu, don't 
forget to use the SetStart CDev to disable the programmer CDAs, Memory 
Peeker and Visit Monitor.  They're just confusing to new Apple IIers.)

EasyMount (Dave Lyons and Jim Murphy)   New users may not use EasyMount to 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   create aliases, but they're sure 
appreciate it when you set up aliases for them, so think about including 
EasyMount.  (Found on the System Disks, specifically in 
:SystemTools:System:System.Setup:)

Quick.Launch (Steve Stephenson)   QuickLaunch allows you to have a list of 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   your most frequently-used programs in the 
Finder's Extras menu.  Simple and quick.  (File #18232, QUICKLAUNCH.BXY)

MakinCopies (Bryan Pietrzak)   Most of the people I know really get a kick 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   out of a talking computer, so you can 
install this one even for users who don't watch television, let alone 
_Saturday Night Live_.  What it will do is play the sound of someone saying 
"Makin' copies!" every time you copy a file.  (File #19428, 
MAKINCOPIES.BXY)

Under.the.Rug (Lunatic E'Sex) $3   This $3 shareware item is invaluable for
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   timid first-timers or for anyone who has 
young children using their GS.  It hides the trash can so that untrained 
kids don't accidentally delete a bunch of files, or so that unruly kids 
don't intentionally do so.  When I set this up for my parents, I made a 
conspicuous alias to the file that explains just how to get the trash can 
back.  (File #21062, UNDER.RUG.BXY)


GAMES   When I was choosing games, I had to keep in mind that my parents' 
"""""   computer had no joystick and no color monitor.  I chose games that 
would draw the grandchildren to the computer, but I also hoped to get my 
parents to play a little.

Milestones.2000 (Ken Franklin) $15   Money is always a problem, but I'll 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   gladly pay $15 to put this game on any 
Apple IIgs I'm responsible for.  It's not just that the money goes to help 
the homeless--this is a great game, and it'll silence any scoffers.  My 
father used to enjoy Parker Brothers' "Milles Bornes", so I'm hoping that 
this game will entice him.  (File #21013, MS2000.151.BXY)

     If you have an extra $10--which you probably don't, not this late in 
the game--then spring for One-Armed Battle, a colorful slot machine by the 
same author.  (File #21011, OAB.151.BXY)

Dungeon (ORCA/C port by Doni G. Grande)   Zork was a great text adventure 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   game for mainframes, except that 
it began life under the name Dungeon.  Here it is, and it's a dilly.  
Well-written text adventures can be a real revelation to someone who has 
never used a computer before--it certainly was for me.  (File #16449, 
DUNGEON.1.BXY, #16450, DUNGEON.2.BXY, and #17375, DUNGEON.UPD.BXY)

Rogue (IIgs version by Scott Lindsey)   This Rogue clone uses the text 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   screen--MouseText characters and 
all--to display a different kind of adventure game:  map the dungeon, 
collect the gold, and kill the monsters.  The overall goal is to fetch a 
magic amulet and then escape with your life.  What makes this version great 
is that you can have digitized sounds attached to events in the game.  
Hint:  an elephant trumpeting, when sped up, makes a great death screech 
for the "monster death" event.  (File #15496, ROGUE.BXY)

PuyoPuyo (Bret "Slixter" Victor)   This Tetris-like game is simple enough 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   for children to play and still plenty 
challenging for adults.  The graphics are nicely cartoon-like, and the 
strategy is easier to explain than with Tetris.  (File #26573, 
PUYOPUYO.BXY)

PixMix (Doug Happel)   This program lets you create jigsaw puzzles of 
''''''''''''''''''''   varying complexity from any super hi-res graphic--be 
sure to include plenty child-suitable pictures with the game!  A nice bonus 
for Canadian parents is that the game can run either in English or French.  
(File #12726, PIXMIX.BXY)

Yahtzee (David W. Buell)   This classic dice game is implemented so that 
''''''''''''''''''''''''   you can throw away all the score pads and enjoy 
yourself.  Roll five dice and try score the combinations listed:  full 
house, straight, three of a kind, four of a kind, and five of a kind, or 
Yahtzee, and more.  (File #16458, YAHTZEE.GS.BXY)

Raster Blaster (Bill Budge)   This excellent pinball game is now freeware, 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''   and it will run on an Apple IIgs just fine.  
You don't even need a joystick--the Command and Option buttons will work as 
the flipper controls.  You will need to slow the GS down before playing and 
speed it up again afterward.  Be sure to get Larry Beam's patch, which 
allows you to quit, and to flip the flipper controls.  (File #21131, 
RASTERBLAST.BXY and #21080, RB.PATCH.BXY [Larry Beam])


MISCELLANEOUS   If you can remember how you reacted when you were 
"""""""""""""   introduced to the whole computing environment, you'll 
remember some of your fears--make sure you quiet these fears when setting 
up an Apple IIgs.

Boot6 and Boot5 (Harold Hislop)   The transition from floppy drives to a 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   hard drive can be intimidating.  You can 
make the change easier by taking these short programs that simply boot 
slots 6 and 5, and leaving a conspicuous and _meaningful_ alias on the 
desktop.  Let's face it, slot 6 for 5.25" disks and slot 5 for 3.5" disks 
is not intuitive.  Either you know it or you don't.  If you create an icon 
of a 5.25" disk for Boot6 and an icon of a 3.5" disk for Boot5, new 
computer users will soon catch on.  If they don't know the term "boot", you 
can change the names of these programs to "Start6" and "Start5", or even 
"Start.3.5" and "Start.5.2.5".  (File #23358, BOOTS.BXY)


     The great thing about the Finder is that it's free... as soon as you 
have the System Disks (which you can legitimately download from Genie).  
New users may react to the Finder as being more powerful than they need, 
which is why I spent the time and trouble to install add-ons that make it 
easy for them to point and click on pictures, sounds, documents files, and 
desk accessories--and to install a utility that hides the trash can.

     You might want to consider not using the Finder, to hide some of the 
intimidating power.  UtilityLaunch by George R. Wilde is a $10 shareware 
item that might make navigating a hard drive less worrying.  (You won't 
need Under the Rug if you use UtilityLaunch, so you can save that $3.)  You 
just set up links to the programs you've installed.  You can still have a 
link from UtilityLaunch to the Finder, so that you don't entirely 
discourage exploring.


WHAT ABOUT YOUR LIST?   The free software I chose to put on the hard drive 
"""""""""""""""""""""   only represents my favorites.  If you have a 
favorite that I've left off, why not write to me and make the case for 
it--perhaps we can print your letter in a coming edition of GenieLamp A2.  
If you have a whole list of favorites, then I _really_ want to hear from 
you--maybe I can persuade you to write an article for GenieLamp A2!
