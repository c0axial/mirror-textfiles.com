Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     This editorial isn't really about any issue facing the Apple II 
community.  This is editorial is about me.  Blatantly about me, I mean.

     This issue marks the end of my third year as editor of GenieLamp A2.  
At one point, it was supposed to mark the end of my service as editor, full 
stop.  Since beginning the first draft of this editorial, I have realized, 
with something of a shock, that my three years with GenieLamp A2 make me 
the longest-serving editor by a considerable margin.  Neither of my two 
predecessors lasted for as long as twelve consecutive months.  This must be 
something I inherited from my father:  after 30 years of service, he is 
only the _fifth_ editor of a magazine about to reach its centenary.

     Last winter, I began to feel that I wasn't offering all that much to 
the Apple II community.  The first issues of _The Apple Blossom_ and 
_Juiced.GS_ printed original material that could have appeared in GenieLamp 
A2... but didn't.  And I felt that this was largely my fault; that I hadn't 
been doing a good enough job.  The only thing this job pays is 
satisfaction, and there wasn't much of that last winter.

     So I planned to stop editing GenieLamp A2 at the end of my third 
year.  I would concentrate on writing articles for the Apple II world 
instead of editing them.  I'm proud to be an editor first--I didn't drift 
into editing as a substitute for writing; I love editing--but I thought 
that writing might revive, replenish, and renew me.  I would hand my 
EDITOR.A2 account over to the new editor, but stay on Genie and stick with 
GenieLamp A2 (as a writer) via my D.CUFF account.

     Then the roof caved in.  GEnie became Genie, and the monthly fee to 
keep an account active went from $7.95 to $23.95.  Much too costly for an 
editor who's still looking for a day job.

     I almost closed my D.CUFF account.  Then Genie introduced GenieLite 
at $8.95 a month, and I grabbed at it like a man in quicksand grabs for a 
tree root.

     The new Genie brought with it a new problem:  no more credits for 
writers, no way to reward them other than with praise.  I found myself in 
the position of having to research and write the entire contents of each 
issue.  (The writing of articles is hard, but not a struggle; it's the 
research that kills you, because it really eats up your time.)

     Recently, a fresh problem threatened.  The new Genie didn't see why 
GenieLamp editors should have special accounts.  This was, in fact, 
supposed to have been the last-ever issue of GenieLamp A2.  John Peters, 
the publisher of all GenieLamps, came through for his editors 
magnificently.  He saved our skins, and he saved GenieLamp.

     That doesn't mean I'm not tired any more.  But the knowledge of how 
close a thing it's been gave me the strength to get through this issue 
without wanting to quit.

     I'm tired this month, but the reason for it is different.  My fatigue 
is not due to disappointment or flagging spirits; it's due to having done a 
lot of hard work on the KansasFest article you'll find in this issue.  It's 
that rarity, an article I'm actually pleased with.  I hope you will be too.

     What is so rare as one of my own articles that I'm pleased with?  An 
article from someone other than me.  If you have an article, please submit 
it.  If you have an idea for an article, please send me E-mail so we can 
discuss it.

     I'm happy to report that I've just been discussing such an idea with 
a writer, so next month or the one after, there should be another voice 
speaking here to break the monotony. <grin>  I'd still like to hear from 
other writers, or those who would like to try writing.

                                 [*][*][*]


     An amusing note about last month's editorial, which addressed the 
subject of a person who had violated my copyright by reprinting part of one 
of my articles without my permission.  I got mail from people who assumed I 
was talking about them, when I wasn't.  There is no shortage of guilty 
consciences out there, it seems.

     I should have been ready for this.  As I said in my July 1994 
editorial, if you tell a group of people that some of them have done 
something wrong, the innocent will assume they're guilty, and the guilty 
will assume that you're talking about someone else, or not care that you're 
talking about them, or admit the act but deny the guilt.

     To be clear, then:  What I was talking about last month was _not_ 
someone who reprinted GenieLamp A2 material without permission.  You do not 
have to ask permission to reprint any GenieLamp A2 material, as long as you 
reproduce the copyright paragraph (see the very end of this issue) and 
mention that it is being reprinted from GenieLamp A2.  The article I spoke 
of last month originally appeared in another Apple II publication, not 
GenieLamp A2.

     That's really pretty simple.  This month, I've made it a little more 
complicated--by writing two articles for which I retain the copyright 
myself.  These two articles (and only these two) do _not_ have to be 
credited as having appeared in GenieLamp A2... but it would be a nice 
gesture.  I retain the copyright on these articles not because I want to 
hoard them but because I want to be able to reprint them without asking 
GenieLamp's permission.  Please note--they're still my copyright material.  
If, as I suspect, the only person they're worth something to is me--then 
why would you want to steal it?

"""""   description. I asked Bill about PSGS several months ago, and he 
told me that the reason nothing ever came of it was that the quality would 
NOT be improved, due to the resolution of PSGS being hard-coded to 72 dpi 
(or 144 dpi?). As mentioned above, the quality would degrade due to the 
sharp definition of the pixels (as opposed to the round or "blurred" edges 
produced by a dot matrix printer).

     If I felt it was worth doing, and I had the time, I could do it. I 
don't feel it's worth doing (and I have better things to do with my time 
right now, which I think GS users might appreciate a lot more :).

_Laboratory Robotics and Automation_, _6_, 5.

     One of my dictionaries says:  Polarography is a method of qualitative 
or quantitative analysis based on current/voltage curves obtained during 
electrolysis of a solution with a steadily increasing electromotive force.

     Another says: Polarography is an electrochemical method of 
quantitative or qualitative analysis based on the relationship between an 
increasing current passing through the solution being analyzed and the 
increasing voltage used to produce the current.

     I wonder how well the hardware and software setup is described. Based 
on the description of the topic I suppose they used a Digital-to-Analog 
converter to precisely step up the voltage.

     Is this document a thesis?  If so, do they charge very much to have 
it reproduced?  I'm kinda skiddish about buying these types of documents

CHALLENGING MISCONCEPTIONS   Today we had "Open House" at the office, with 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   about 90 new staff coming through.  On my desk 
my //e displayed a full screen (in PublishIt's page preview) saying, "Apple 
II Forever!"  The Mac next to it had a Kid's Pix screen with a hand 
pointing to the //e which said, "The Apple II is my big brother."

     Someone left a note on the //e's keyboard which said, "You are a 
brave and courageous person."

     I discovered who left the note and he explained, "You're brave to be 
using such an old machine."  Whereupon I explained that the HP LJ 4M 
sitting next to the //e was driven by the //e, showed him my postscript

GRAPHICWRITER III BUG REPORT LEADS TO ENCOURAGING NEWS   OK, here's 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   something odd.

     While working in GraphicWriter III 2.0, I go to the Apple pull-down 
menu to select the Swatterdisk NDA. Instead of the SwatterDisk control 
center window popping up, I get the GraphicWriter "About" box instead, the 
same one you get when you select "About" under the Apple pull-down menu. 
Every other NDA, and I have many installed, works fine.

     I tried this with a number of other programs, and each time I select 
the SwatterDisk NDA, the proper window pops up. The only place it fails to 
work properly is in GW III.

     Could somebody who has both GW III and SwatterDisk check to see if 
they can duplicate this problem?

     I'm beginning to get a little paranoid. A couple of windows in 
Kangaroo don't pop up properly and another won't pop up at all, now 
SwatterDisk doesn't respond inside GW III. Recently, the window of the 
Shortcuts NDA (from Softdisk GS) began not showing up when I select it from 
the Apple pull-down menu, even though the shortcut key commands continue to 
work OK.

     I know it's a full moon, but could there be any other explanation for 
all this? I'm just hoping someone can duplicate the GW III/SwatterDisk 
problem so I can rest a little easier.

Thanks,

>>>>>   Yep, the NDA selection thing is definitely a bug. We found it a
"""""   long time ago, but I could never reproduce it on my test (read: 
basic system) machine. That's not to say it's not GWIII's fault, just that 
we had a hard time reproducing it.

     It's MORE THAN LIKELY a GWIII bug, and it's on our list of things to

APPLE BLOSSOM PUBLISHER MOVES   Hi everybody, just a quick update on some 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Apple Blossom happenings. First, the next 
issue should be completed this weekend, and I hope to begin mailing by the 
middle of next week. This issue will have articles on GraphicWriter III, 
Connecting a CD-ROM to a IIGS, how to flow text inside a shape in GWIII, 
how to calculate the days of the week in the AW spreadsheet, plus the usual 
announcements, etc.

     Also, I'll be moving in the next two weeks. I've got a new job up in 
Boston, so I'll be returning there on July 6th. I don't have a permanent 
address yet, but you can send mail to me at my folks house:

          Steve Cavanaugh
          13 Hillsdale Rd.
          Holbrook, MA 02343

     I'll be able to pick it up regularly once there.

     My email here and on AOL (stevec1021@aol.com) will remain the same, 
of course, as will my Web page (http://members.aol.com/newblossom/), which 
will be updated in the next week as well, with an article from the 
newsletter and perhaps a bonus review as well. My other internet address 
(cav@strauss.udel.edu) will be closed down this week, so don't send me any 
more mail at that address.

APPLE II GROUP--AFFILIATE WITH MAC USER GROUP?   I don't know whether this 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   is the appropriate topic 
section for this or not, but the title seemed least inappropriate of the 
available choices.  This is a plea for advice.

     Our users group, the Carolina Apple Core, has been an Apple II 
support group since 1979.  Surrounded by Mac groups, we are the only group 
in central North Carolina still actively supporting the Apple II.

     Recently several of our most active members have switched to Macs, 
and on the "use it or lose it" principle have begun losing their expertise 
with Apple IIs.  Those of us who are still Apple II fanatics think the 
group should remain an Apple II organization with a Mac SIG, but there are 
problems.

     When there are Apple II-based presentations at the monthly meetings, 
the Mac people are bored and it shows.  The vice versa situation also 
applies. We have been trying to find cross-cultural topics for the 
meetings, like using the Internet, how to transfer files between platforms, 
etc, but we are running out of ideas.  Apple, Inc. is no help since they 
don't remember there ever was an Apple II.

     Is there hope for us???

>>>>>   Phil, what we had long done at the meetings in Greensboro was to
"""""   have a brief business meeting and then split up into Mac and Apple 
II groups for platform-specific presentations.

     If you don't have that kind of space luxury, then perhaps you could 
schedule the two presentations at different times, with the business 
meeting sandwiched in the middle, or something.

     I confess that I haven't been to a Greensboro meeting in well over a 
year, maybe two. I discovered that my main reason for going to them was to 
hang out with my friends, and when most of them bought Macs and PCs and 
quit coming, I eventually did also.

     I do believe that the Apple II people can put up with Macs better 
than the other way around. There appears to be a snobbery among the Mac 
users.

     The trouble is that the Apple IIs and Macs are different computers 
that were made by the same company, pretty much that is where the 
similarity ends.

     When that magazine switched from just Apple II, to add the Mac 
coverage, it became a boring rag; that then went out of business. It is 
also true that there really aren't any IBM/Mac magazines out there. The Mac 
people are always writing to Byte magazine about how the Mac wasn't 
mentioned in this or that article (even ones on desk top publishing). 
Whine, whine, whine...

     My advice is for the user group to drop the Mac coverage. You might 
even be able to bring in new Apple II members if you show how inexpensive 
it can be to get online with a 'new' Apple II system.

>>>>>   I guess I'm pretty down on user groups myself.  I'm on the Board of
"""""   Directors of the Hawai'i Macintosh and Apple User's Society, and 
basically, they've never given me anything but a very large headache. :/

     I write the two Apple II columns in the SIGNAL for them, and handle 
about 80% of the Apple II trouble calls (used to be 100% before graduate 
school forced me to say "ENOUGH!").  The problem is more in reciprocity.

     I feel I give a lot to my UG (in terms of tech support, help, writing 
articles, etc.)  I almost never get anything back.  I can't even get the 
Mac BBS librarian to put some files (TrueType fonts, for instance) in .SIT 
1.5.1 with no folders format so that Apple IIgs users can get at 'em, and 
he's a pretty prominent Apple II guy.

     Our group also started as an Apple II only group, and now it's both a 
II and Mac group, as well as Newton; however, I'd say 90% of the emphasis 
is Mac.

     My UG experience here tells me mostly one thing: if I have someone 
who's serious about Apple IIs here, before I tell them to join HMAUS, I 
tell them to join Genie.

As far as James' comment about:

>> Apple II presentations at the monthly meetings, the Mac people are bored
>> and vice versa

> This shows up in A2 with the Mac only topic.:( Who wants to read about
> individuals and schools and what the best Mac for them to get is?

     Really, part of the reason why that topic is there is pragmatic: a 
lot of Apple II people, particularly on this RT, use and own Macs (I'm 
"guilty" myself, twice).  Another part of it is very pragmatic as well: A2 
users are some of the best informed anywhere, and I see better answers to 
those Mac questions here than in the Mac RT most days.

     As a BB person, I can say also that the topic is indeed intended for 
"Quick Help" only.  Long ongoing discussions are directed to the Mac RT.  
And, even after all of this, if you're still not interested in the topic 
(believe me, I can relate; for years I swore I'd never own a Mac; at this 
point I've generally stopped swearing at them. . . well, maybe not :) you 
can always IGNore it.

KANSASFEST SCHEDULE   Godzilla (Steve Gozdziewski) will be along soon 
"""""""""""""""""""   (maybe a few days) and post the BETA schedule.

     We are very hesitant to post it ahead of time because of all the 
complaints we got last year when we had to change things.

     I am stressing NOW and will continue to stress that any schedule you 
see is not final.  Heck, we even had to change it after we arrived at Avila 
last year because they changed our meal times.  Oh well. :)

     I can tell you that the roast is planned for Friday night, and we 
will be "serving" Joe Kohn, medium rare.  So if you are interested in 
helping with that fun occasion, let me know.

time in the evening for the informal gatherings. While the number of formal

Newton "gurus" staying in the dorms. Most are willing to answer any 
question you may have and/or assist you in any way they can. 

     Please remember this is NOT the final schedule which can, and most 
likely will change. However, you should now have a good idea of the

NEW, IMPROVED HFS.FST BUG?   I have uncovered what appears to be a bug in 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   the way that GS/OS (Finder?) handles HFS 
partitions. I say appears, because it is possible that it is something 
unique to my system. I would be interested in hearing from others who might 
have had similar problems, or to see if anyone else can duplicate my 
problem.

     I have several HFS partitions on my IIgs system (Apple Hi-Speed SCSI 
card, slot 7, System 6.0.1, with patched HFS FST). I am using a 1.3 GB 
Seagate drive, partitioned into two 600 MB partitions, four 32 MB 
partitions, and one with the leftovers. Also, I have a magneto-optical 
drive, with 281MB per side (562MB per cartridge). I have it set as a single 
partition on each side.

     I have found that if I drag copy files via Finder onto the 600MB 
partition such that the files to be copied are more than the available free 
space, and if the files are in a folder, that when I get the "Disk is Full" 
error, the folder has been corrupted that it was copying into. The folder 
can no longer be deleted from Finder. This has happened twice. Also, it 
happened with a 281MB partition on the M-O drive. 

     My question is, can anyone else duplicate this? With a smaller 
partition? With something other than HFS? (I have nbever seen it happen 
with a ProDOS partition, and I have overflowed on partitions before with 
ProDOS.

     I would be interested in hearing anything about this.

"""""
     I've filled HFS volumes by having multiple folders selected in the 
Finder, and then dragging those over to the HFS volume. This could easilly 
be doing something different than if one had only one (huge) folder being 
copied. (one huge folder = one base prefix being used for the entire 
operation, multiple smaller folders = the base prefix gets changed after 
each smaller folder is finished)

     You're =only= encountering the HFS directory corruption when a disk 
full condition has occured? (try the copying with just less than enough to 
fill the HFS volume, -exactly- enough to fill the volume, and just a bit 
too much)

     I've got a =suspicion= about this, but it's too early to say what, 
and I can't test it here as I don't have a really large drive that I can 
set up as HFS.

     If they are "almost" filled, you won't see it. You will have to use 
Finder to drag a folder of files to the partition to try to =overfill= it 
and trigger the "disk is full" error. Only then will this problem appear, 
at least on my setup. An almost full drive does not trigger it.

Note, I said 'writing' not debugging.  I still have a few other additions

 It should be on Genie in the A2 Library, On my own FTP site (mentioned in 
sig below, and on comp.sys.apple2.binaries.

     If you don't know what Music Composer is (sigh):

     Music Composer is an Apple IIGS desktop program for creating and 
editing music sequence files.  It is built around the MIDIsynth tool 
(tool035). With Music Composer you can create a sequence from scratch and 
edit it or you can import files from SynthLAB, Sound Smith, Music Studio, 
or standard MIDI files.  Files can be saved as Music Composer format or 
exported to SynthLAB or standard MIDI files.  When editing you can cut, 
copy or paste tracks, measures or individual notes.  You can tranpose up or 
down both volume and note values.  You can also edit individual notes and 
MIDI data. You enter notes through a MIDI device or through the computer 
keyboard in a spreadsheet like interface.  You can also play your creations 
using music composer.

     If you don't know what the Apple IIGS is (SIGH):

 *Previous version of Music Composer can be found at my FTP site (see sig
 *below), or on GEnie, AOL, grind.isca.uiowa.edu, and other FTP sites on
 *internet.

     Sorta. It'll handle doing some types of graphics conversions for me, 
particularly small JPEGs. On larger pictures it chokes, as I only have 4Mb 
in my SE. (might be bumping this up to 8Mb, just found out that 2Mb 30 pin 
SIMMs arre under $30 each from Chip Merchant :) It -won't- handle the .BMP 
pictures that prompted my initial question here, it seems that they have 
some kind of fairly recently compression being used on them :/

     I did discover, much to my chagrin, that a certain IIgs graphics 
utility that I'm beta testing handles the pictures in question however, and 
quite nicely too. This is ideal for me, as I can download them via the Mac, 
then display on the IIgs while the Mac is busy downloading the next one. 
(appletalk is slow, but hey, it works :)

TRANSLATING HIGH-BIT CHARACTERS   I've created a little program that takes 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   a text file that was created with a 
program that uses curly quotes and other high bit characters, and changes 
the curly quotes, apostrophes, slashed zeros, and hyphens and converts them 
to standard low bit matching characters. It also finds and replaces all 
other high bit characters with a tilde (~) so that you can quickly find 
them with a word processor and change them or delete them as you please.

     If you have been plagued with loading a text file created on the Mac, 
or with some other program that uses these high bit characters and 
discovering things like 

     RThis is supposed to be in quotes.S
     or contractions such as youUve, wonUt, IUll,

then you know what a hassle it is to manually change them.

     I'm looking for 3-4 people to beta test this program for me. If you 
are interested, post a message here. I'll take the first 4 who post and 
send them the program via attached email.

     I'll ask the beta testers to try it out on as many different sized 
files, from as many different sources as you can. I'm particularly 
interested in text files created with Mac or DOS word processors, as well 
as those created as TEACH files on the GS.

     One one of caution. If you have already loaded the text file into a 
word processor such as AppleWorks and saved it back as a text file, this 
program won't help you. AppleWorks automatically strips the high bits that 
my program needs to see.

     Let me hear from you.

Dear c.s.a2,

     I hope you find the announcement below worth the bandwidth.

     Shady (Mr. ShadowWrite) and I have been working on this beast 
'secretly' for many months (me since last January), and we're happy it's 
developing the way we'd like.  Please note that it's still an alpha 
release, and alpha is alpha and not beta or final.  Alpha means:  bugs, 
crying programmers on drugs, dead machines.

     If you own a PowerMac and do have in-depth knowledge of the IIGS 
hardware, please let me know.  We're still looking for beta testers.

     One last thing:  Andre will leave planet Earth until mid August, so 
I'll have to do all answering *and* programming on my own.  Please be 
patient when contacting me.  This also means that you should send *all* 
your questions and comments to gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch.  (You might be able 
to catch him *today* 6/24/96 CET, but then he's gone..)  Thank you!

Enjoy,
Henrik

                      POWERMACS RUN APPLE IIGS SOFTWARE

                   Alpha Version Sent to Selected Testers


     Zug/Basel (Switzerland), 6/24/96 -- Fast Eddie Labs, formerly Bright 
Software, announced today the availability of alpha seeds of "Fast Eddie" 
to selected testers.  "Fast Eddie" introduces full Apple II software 
compatibility for Power Macintosh computers.  It emulates the complete line 
of Apple II computers, including the Apple IIGS.

     Fast Eddie is a collection of powerful components such as the 
Powercore CPU and core services component, the Grafitti video engine, the 
CleverPort disk interface and the n-sonic sound emulation.  Initial 
versions of Fast Eddie will not patch time-consuming toolbox calls.  "We're 
emulating metal", said Andre Horstmann, project manager of Fast Eddie Labs.  
"We want former Apple IIGS users to be able to run their favorite 
entertainment software on their Power Macs."

     The Powercore component offers 8- and 16-bit 65816 emulation, 
including interrupts, memory shadowing, bank switching, and much more.  
Other services provided by Powercore are ADB mouse support, Mac-backed real 
time clock, among others.

     The Grafitti video engine supports all popular video modes (more to 
come in near future), including Super Hires, b&w Hires and 40/80 text 
display.  The video driver is designed to produce accurate screen refreshes 
at maximum speed.

     To work with your favorite software, you need some kind of disk 
device.  CleverPort is the ultimate answer to your storage needs.  Mount 10 
disks of sizes between 1kB and 8Gb at once!  CleverPort also features an 
easy to use point & click interface.

     Last but not least, real GS software uses the n-sonic sound driver 
for rich, mind-blowing sound.  The n-sonic emulates up to 32 channels in 
mono, stereo, enhanced stereo or SonicScape-3D 4-way surround sound.

     For more information, please surf the Eddie-web at 
http://www.swix.ch/clan/shadow/eddie.html .

     The project "Fast Eddie" was started by Andre Horstmann, author of 
the most popular NDA word processor Hermes (formerly ShadowWrite) and the 
telecommunication software "ShadowDial".  Mr. Horstmann joined Bright 
Software in 1990 and greatly contributed to Bright Software's success of 
providing the Apple II community with reliable, innovative software 
solutions.

     Mr. Gudat joined the Fast Eddie project in early 1996 and added disk 
and sound support.  Mr. Gudat is the author of many software products 
including the award-winning The Gate, Eureka!Symbolix, MultiView, 
cross-platform office automation tools, voice mail & fax-back systems, and 
coauthor of SpaceFox.

     Since 1989, Bright Software has been developing innovative software 
products for Apple II computers that improve productivity through 
reliability and added functionality.  Fast Eddie is the latest and greatest 
product in this serie and demonstrates our continued support of Apple II 
users and commitment to the Apple II platform.

KansasFest 1996

    [EDITOR.A2]



               >>> THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST AT KANSASFEST <<<
               """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
           Copyright 1996 by Douglas Cuff.  All rights reserved.


     The Accidental Tourist travel guides were described by Anne Tyler in 
her 1985 novel of the same name (later a movie starring William Hurt, 
Kathleen Turner, and Geena Davis).  The Accidental Tourist guides were 
designed for the business traveller whose reactions to travel were feelings 
of anxiety and defenseless.  The guides were meant to soothe and comfort 
the non-adventurous traveller.

     If you've never been to KansasFest before, you should find that this 
guide will do the same for you.  If you're an old hand at KansasFest, this 
guide will provide you with some helpful reminders.

     One word of warning:  If there's a conflict between the advice you 
receive from the Accidental Tourist and the instructions you're given from 
the information packet when you arrive at KansasFest--pay attention to the 
official info packet.  These folks know the score.

     KansasFest began in 1989 as the A2-Central Developer Conference, and 
didn't begin calling itself KansasFest until its third year, 1991.  
KansasFest takes place in Kansas City, Missouri.  (Not Kansas City, Kansas.  
The Kansas border is less than a mile away, if that comforts you any.)

     This will be the eighth annual KansasFest, and it's not just for 
programmers and developers any more.  If you've never been to KansasFest 
before, you don't know what you're missing!  It's a great chance to learn 
about your Apple II, mingle with other users, and see what software other 
people are working on.  This is the Apple II event of the year.  I can't 
say exactly how many people will there, but 60-100 attendees is a safe 
estimate.

     KansasFest takes place entirely at Avila College, in the southmost 
part of Kansas City.  Here's the address:

          Avila College
          11901 Wornall Road
          Kansas City, Missouri  64145  U.S.A.
          phone (816) 942-8400

     Avila College is small--approximately 1500 students--which means you 
can walk anywhere on campus in five minutes.  Use of a car is therefore as 
optional as it's ever going to get, assuming you fly to Kansas.  The one 
time you are going to be hollering for a vehicle is when you try to get to 
and from Kansas City International airport.  More on that shortly.

     This year, KansasFest is scheduled for July 18-20, but dorm rooms are 
available for the nights of July 17-20.

          PM   Wed July 17    arrival
               Thu July 18    scheduled sessions
               Fri July 19    scheduled sessions
               Sat July 20    vendors' fair
          AM   Sun July 21    farewell

     The cost of the conference is $375 for the conference/dormitory 
package (meals from the college cafeteria are included) and $275 for the 
conference (lunch included).  Even if you can find a room in Kansas City 
for $25 a night, staying on campus is still a better idea, since 
after-hours activities are a big part of KansasFest.

     You will be staying in either Carondelet or Ridgway dormitory, which 
were built in 1963.  For those of you who have never experienced residence 
life or have forgotten what it was like, expect spartan surroundings.  
Forget the idea of a private bathroom, but you'll be glad to know that the 
rooms are air-conditioned.


BEFORE YOU GO   As with any trip, you need to arrange for several things:
"""""""""""""
     o  conference attendance (fee $275/$375);
     o  accommodation (included in package);
     o  meals (included in package);
     o  transport to/from conference.

     Those attending from outside the United States will also need:

     o  passport/visa;
     o  medical insurance;
     o  US currency/traveller's checks.

Conference Attendance   You may be too late to get accommodation at Avila 
'''''''''''''''''''''   by the time you read this, but do check.  The last 
day pre-registration will be accepted is July 13, but there's always plenty 
of room for off-campus conference attendees, so you may be able to register 
at Avila on July 18.

Accommodation   If you're staying at Avila College campus, chances are good 
'''''''''''''   that you're going to be sharing a room with one other 
person.  Space is limited to 80 beds this year, so if you end up in a room 
by yourself, it will be entirely by accident.  The rooms are _not_ co-ed, 
but the dorms are.

     There aren't any hotels within walking distance of Avila College, so 
plan on having transportation if you're staying off-campus.

     Here are some hotels said to be near Avila College.  Please be warned 
that I haven't stayed at any of them, so I can't make recommendations.  
Most have approximate room rates shown; some do not.

Meals   If you're staying on Avila campus, meals are included in the 
'''''   package price.  Even if you aren't staying at Avila, lunch is 
included.

     If you find the cafeteria food not to your liking--and many 
don't--you'll be relieved to know that there's a supermarket about 25 
minutes' walk away.  Here's how to get there:

     Start at Carondelet dorm.  Stand with your back to the dorm entrance, 
so that you can see the Marian Center if you look left.  Turn right from 
Carondelet and walk down to the parking lot.  Turn left and walk out of the 
parking lot, down Sister Oliver Louise Drive.  This private road takes you 
to 118th Street.  Turn left and walk on 118th until you reach Wornall Road.  
Turn right on Wornall until you reach the intersection of Wornall and 
Minor.  Turn right onto Minor Drive.

     Once on Minor, ten minutes' walk will bring you close to the end of 
Minor, to the point where you can see a large parking lot.  Veer left and 
you'll be at a small shopping mall that boasts a bank, a supermarket, and a 
restaurant.  (Note:  This trip can be made a few minutes shorter, but these 
directions are simpler, and can be easily adapted for use by motorists as 
well as pedestrians.)

     If you're not staying on Avila campus, you're probably sufficiently 
adventurous to know how to find decent food in a strange city.  Be aware 
that small groups tend to sneak off-campus to a restaurant (often either KC 
Masterpiece or Jesse & Jims) for at least one evening meal during the 
conference.  Let them know you want to be part of the excursion!

Transportation 101/A--Getting to Kansas   Many of you intend to fly to 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Kansas City.  The airport you 
will be arriving at is Kansas City International (MCI).  The airport has 
three arc-shaped terminals.  If you're meeting someone there, be sure that 
everyone intends to go to the same terminal, or that everyone is catching 
the (free) shuttle to the same car rental agency.

     You can pick up a city map at one of the airport magazine stands.  
The Gousha map has Avila College marked (grid location I-19).  If you don't 
have a map, better pay close attention:

     If you drew a map of Kansas City on a 8x11 sheet of paper, the 
airport would be in the upper left corner, to the northwest.  Avila College 
would be near the bottom of the piece of paper, near the center.  Point 
taken?

     The distance between Avila College and the international airport is 
not small.  It's perhaps 45 miles by the recommended route (below), so 
allow an hour's travel time at a bare minimum.  What with collecting your 
luggage and arranging/co-ordinating transport, it's probably safer to 
assume it will take you two hours to get from the airport to Avila, 
starting from the time the plane's landing gear touches the tarmac and 
stopping when you sling your suitcase onto the dorm bed.

Transportation 101/B--Getting to Avila   Since the distance from the 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   airport to Avila College is 28 
miles as the crow flies, and about 45 miles by car, you don't even want to 
think about taking a taxi.  You'd pay $40 minimum, possibly as much as $60.  
For a one-way trip.

     If you book ahead, you get Quicksilver to take you to Avila College 
at a more reasonable rate:

          $21.50 for 1 person
          $28.50 for 2 people
          $35.50 for 3 people
          $37.50 for 4 people
          $50.00 for 5 or more

     You _must_ book Quicksilver in advance.  They need at least one day's 
notice, so call them at 1-800-888-8294 or 816-262-0906.  IF YOU DON'T MAKE 
A RESERVATION, THEY CAN'T TAKE YOU.

     If you don't want to rent a car, you could also take the Airport 
Express van to the Overland Park Marriott hotel and take a cab from there.

     (Those of you renting cars at the airport:  we'll discuss the route 
shortly, in the ARRIVAL section.)


PREPARING FOR THE TRIP   Get plenty of sleep before you go, because you're 
""""""""""""""""""""""   not likely to get much sleep at KansasFest.  
KansasFest days are 18 hours long, unless they're 20 or 24 hours long.  
There's too much going on to waste time in sleep!

     On the same note, make sure you don't schedule anything important 
(like operating heavy machinery) for the day after KansasFest--Monday, July 
22.  You'll have had so little sleep that you won't feel your best.

Packing--Computer Stuff   Lots of people brings computers.  If you're doing 
'''''''''''''''''''''''   this, make a backup of your hard drive and leave 
the backup at home.  If you won't feel safe unless you take a backup with 
you, make two backups.

     If you're bringing a hard drive and you're travelling by plane, you 
may want to consider packing the hard drive in your carry-on luggage.  That 
way, you can extract the hard drive from the luggage before it gets X-rayed 
(!).  Tell the attendant that what you are carrying in your hand is a hard 
drive for a computer, and that it might be damaged by the X-ray machine.  
Chances are they'll handle it differently.  If they tell you that no damage 
could possibly be caused, don't believe them.  (You may have to obey them, 
but don't believe them.)  Try insisting (politely!) on special handling 
anyway.  Incidentally, X-rays are not good for diskettes either.

     Bring plenty of extension cords, power bars, and surge suppressors, 
plus phone cord if you bring your modem.  Bring plenty of blank disks.  
Bring anything you'd like to show off, either software or hardware.

Packing--Other Stuff   A word about clothing:  KansasFest is "dress 
''''''''''''''''''''   casual", and Kansas City in July is hot and humid, 
so light clothing would be a good idea.  If you're bringing anything that 
you want to hang in the closet, bring your own hangers.

     You should pack a bathrobe or something you don't mind walking the 
halls in when you rise in the morning.  The dorms will be housing both 
sexes, and there are no private bathrooms.

     Towels are supplied, but you can pack an extra one if you feel so 
inclined.  Be sure to bring all the usual toiletries:  soap, shampoo, 
toothbrush, and all the etceteras.

     There are modular phone jacks in all the dorm rooms, but phones are 
not provided, so pack a phone, if only for local calls (which are free).  
If you know who your roommate is, you can assure her or him that you're 
bringing the phone and save her or him the trouble.

     If you're serious about making the morning sessions, an alarm clock 
is a good idea.  If you're _really_ serious about attending morning 
sessions, ear plugs--for the night before--couldn't hurt either. <grin>

     Unless you're a private soul, some sort of sign for your door is a 
good idea, so that people can find you.  Many people take the trouble to 
make these before they leave.  Possibly Eric Shepherd will have a huge 
"SheppyWare World Headquarters" sign on his door.  Or then again, possibly 
not.

     Don't forget your airline tickets and other travel documents, if any, 
but don't pack them in your checked luggage.  Also don't forget a quarter 
for a phone call.


ARRIVING
""""""""

Getting from the Airport to Avila   If you've arranged with Quicksilver to 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   pick you up at the airport, as you 
leave the "gate", look for someone holding up a sign with your name on it.  
(The sign will probably also have "Quicksilver" written on it.)

     Of course, Quicksilver have been known to get busy at KansasFest 
time.  If no one is there looking for you, start by looking for them.  The 
Quicksilver people are usually easy to spot.  If there's no one from 
Quicksilver in the terminal, don't panic.  Just call them at 262-0905.  
This is a local call from the airport.  (You didn't forget a quarter for a 
phone call, did you?)

     Remember that you _cannot_ ride with Quicksilver unless you have made 
a reservation at least one day in advance.

Driving from the Airport to Avila   If you're renting a car, start looking 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   for the desk of the rental agency 
you're dealing with.  (Remember that there are shuttle buses among the 
three terminals, if necessary.)

     Once you've got your car, exit through the airport's main gate 
(Cookingham Drive) onto Interstate 29 heading south.  At highway 152, exit 
west.  Follow 152 west to I-435.  Take I-435 south and follow it around 
until it reaches Wornall Road from the west.  Then exit to Avila College 
(which is a left turn off Wornall if you approach it from I-435).  Check 
our handy Avila map below for where to park.  The best place is probably 
the lot near the dormitories.

After Hours Arrival   It's Wednesday night, and it's dark already.  
'''''''''''''''''''   Quicksilver has just dropped you off... or you've 
just parked the rental car.  You're tired after the long drive from the 
airport.  You've never been to Avila College before.  Now what do you do?

     It's easy.  The campus at Avila is small, and there are only three 
building that KFesters need to explore:

     I.  Whitfield Conference Center:  This is where most of the actual 
conference sessions take place.  It's sufficiently small that you'd have to 
try really hard to get lost here.  If you walk the path to Whitfield from 
one of the other buildings listed below, go down the stairs as soon as you 
get inside the door.  If you enter Whitfield from the roadway, you're at 
the main conference entrance, so don't worry.

     II.  Marian Center:  This is where the cafeteria is.  Unless you're 
booked into a nearby hotel, this is where you come to eat.  This is also 
where the celebrity roast is traditionally held.  Yes, you're allowed to 
attend the roast even if you're staying at a hotel, and you get to eat 
lunch here too.

     III.  either Ridgway or Carondelet dormitory:  This is where you 
sleep, at least in theory.  Even hotel-dwellers need to know about the 
dorms, since you'll spend a lot of your evenings hanging out here.  At past 
KFests, both dorms have been used, but this year, only one of them is 
available.  You'll find out which when you arrive.

     Look at the map of the campus below and get your bearings:

     If it's late Wednesday night, forget about registering for the 
_conference_.  Concentrate on registering for your _room_.

     If it's extremely late at night, the front doors of the dorms may be 
shut too.  Look for a buzzer that will rouse a member of the staff.

     The best thing to do is to read the instructions in your preliminary 
information packet, but if they don't produce satisfactory results, wander 
about one or both of the dorms until you find someone who'll take pity on 
your and let you collapse onto a bed.  You'll get a room assignment and a 
room key.  (You may even get a sheet of paper that tells you who you've 
been billeted with and how to register for the conference on the following 
morning.)

     If you're staying in Ridgway, don't collapse the minute you see your 
room key.  The lowest number it will have on it is 401.  That does NOT mean 
you're on the fourth floor.  (Particularly as Ridgway has only three 
floors.)  If your room number begins with 4, it means you're on the first 
floor (or "ground floor" to most Europeans).  Similar deal for the second 
and third floors.  If your room number doesn't begin with 4, 5, or 6, it 
means you aren't staying at Ridgway.

     If wandering around the dorms doesn't produce any results, try Marian 
Center.  If you still can't find anyone, wander down toward Whitfield.

     Arriving after hours means you get to check in to your room.  You 
still must register for the conference in the morning.  We'll cover that in 
the "Business Hours Arrival" section.  For now, what about your room?

Your Room   Rooms at the Avila College dorms each have two beds.  If your 
'''''''''   roommate is there, smile and introduce yourself.  If your 
roommate isn't there, don't be alarmed.  Your roommate may not have arrived 
yet, in which case you get to grab the best bed.  (I'm joking.  Neither bed 
will be any less loathsome than the other.)  Probably your roommate has 
already arrived, grabbed the best bed, and is out visiting others.

     Near the beds is a long institutional-looking unit with two closets, 
two sets of drawers, and assorted storage space.  The opposite side of this 
unit is a desk long enough for two people to work at.  There's plenty of 
room for two computers on this desk, but there's just one outlet per 
computer.  If you don't have a power bar or a Kensington System Saver or an 
AE Conserver, you're going to be limited to plugging in the computer and 
the monitor--no hard drive, no modem, nothing else.  (Those of you with 
internal hard drives can stop being smug right now.)

     Near the desk are two outlets that seem to be phone jacks.  They 
_aren't_ phone jacks.  The phone jack is on the other side of the room, by 
the beds.  If you didn't bring plenty of phone extension cord, you'll have 
to set up your computer at the foot of your bed.  (Don't laugh.  It's 
happened.)  Don't waste time looking for the phone; they aren't supplied, 
which is why you had to bring one in your suitcase.  To find out the phone 
number of your room (so that people can call you), ask one of the Avila 
staff.  If you didn't bring a phone, you can still use one of the pay 
phones in the hallways.

     When dialing out from your dorm room, either with a phone or a modem, 
you'll need to prefix the number with a 9 to get an outside line.  If 
you're using a modem, you may be able to use its "wait for dialtone" 
feature before you dial the number.  So the proper sequence would be:

          ATDT9w4741778

If your modem doesn't support "wait for dialtone", try using a few commas 
(,) to create a pause:

          ATDT9,,4725178

     You may also need to set your software up so it waits about 45 
seconds for a connect instead of the standard 30 seconds, because it takes 
a bit longer to get through to the number you're dialing.

     (There's information about dialing Genie later in this article.)

     The only real luxury that the rooms boast is air-conditioning.  No 
private baths here, but you'll find bathrooms just down the corridor a 
piece.  The one I frequented had one bathtub, two showers, three toilets, 
four sinks (one with an attachment for washing hair), and assorted mirrors.  
Every floor also seems to have a TV lounge and a small kitchen.

Business Hours Arrival   If you arrive at Avila between 9 AM and 5 PM, you 
''''''''''''''''''''''   can register for the conference and your room (if 
applicable) at the same time.  Check your pre-conference packet for 
information on where to register.  At press time, details were still being 
finalized, "but more than likely it will be Ridgway dorm or the cafeteria 
area."  If that doesn't work, try the main entrance of the Whitfield 
conference center.

     One note of warning:  if you've been told to register somewhere--say, 
the cafeteria at Marian center--and no one has shown up fifteen minutes 
after the listed start time, then by all means check the dorms and 
Whitfield center to see if registration has been moved there.  It's 
unlikely you'll have to worry about something like this, but it doesn't 
hurt to be prepared.


ONCE YOU'RE THERE
"""""""""""""""""

Curricular Events   Originally, KansasFest was a conference for Apple II 
'''''''''''''''''   developers--people who wanted to create software and 
hardware for others to use.  Nowadays it's for users, too.  Don't worry 
that you don't belong there--you do and you're welcome, whether you've come 
to party or come to learn.

     The sessions--no one dignifies them with the name "seminars"--are 
mostly held at the Whitfield conference center.  The main conference room 
is right inside the main doors (the doors closest to Wornall Road).  If you 
don't know how to get to the session you want to attend, come here.  It 
will either be in this room or someone in this room will know where the 
right room is.

     There's a social aspect to this part of the occasion as well.  You'll 
see plenty of schmoozing in Whitfield lobby, right outside the main 
conference room.  Expect cameras, both still and video, and demented people 
operating them.  Cameras are used to record the presentations, or people 
meeting, or the general craziness that's going on!

     On the last day of KansasFest, there's a vendors' fair.  This is a 
chance to pick up hardware and software at special KFest prices, and to see 
and buy software never before released.

Semi-curricular Events   While not officially part of the proceedings, some 
''''''''''''''''''''''   software _always_ gets released at KansasFest.  (I 
sometimes think Apple II programmers would never ever ship if it weren't 
for KansasFest and Christmas.)  This year:

     o  Marin MacroWorks will be releasing UltraMax III (TimeOut modules 
        for AppleWorks 4 and 5);
     o  Joe Kohn has hinted darkly at a "debut of several items that may 
        be of interest to IIGS owners of CD-ROM drives", which probably 
        means either the entire run of either _Studio City_ or 
        _Script-Central_ (or both?) available on CD-ROM; and
     o  Sheppy made a rash promise, as recently as April, to release 
        Shifty List 2.0 at this year's Fest--a promise I'm sure he now 
        regrets and hopes that no one remembers. <grin>  His recent 
        marriage aside, Sheppy's been kept quite busy by his day job....

     You're also likely to see product previews at KansasFest.

     o  Since Ewen Wannop will be attending, look for previews of Spectrum 
        v2.1.
     o  Ewen is also working on an offline message reader (one like 
        CoPilot) and is developing Spectrum XCMDs to make this task easier.
     o  Plead with Sheppy until he shows everyone how far Wolfenstein 3-D 
        has progressed.
     o  Perhaps someone will have obtained permission from Derek Taubert 
        to demonstrate his "in progress" web browser.

     Who knows what else?  _I_ sure don't!

Extra-curricular Events   It is perfectly possible to attend KansasFest, 
'''''''''''''''''''''''   attend the sessions 9-5, and go back home.  But 
why would you want to?

     One reason you might want to is that you're shy.  You're shy at any 
gathering, but you can't imagine conversing with Richard Bennett, Charles 
Hartley, Joe Kohn, Will Nelken, Eric Shepherd, Ewen Wannop, or Mike 
Westerfield!  There's no reason to be shy.  Do what Dean Esmay did at his 
first KansasFest:  walk around introducing yourself.  To everyone.  You'll 
meet lots of people just as awestruck as you are, and you can swap tips, 
stories, recommendations, and lies.  Don't be intimidated by meeting 
well-known Apple II figures.  Heck, we're all "just folks".

     Don't let yourself leave KansasFest without having mingled.  Wander 
around the dorms.  If there's one person sitting at a computer, just say 
"hi".  You're intelligent enough to know how to figure out if the person is 
hard at work or at home to callers.  If there are a bunch of people--which 
is far more likely, particularly during the evening--you might be shy about 
joining the group.  Don't be.  Just announce your presence ("Hi, everybody!  
Room for one more?").  You'll be surprised how welcome the group will make 
you feel.  Whatever the group is doing, it's probably in "kibitz mode", so 
join in!

     What will the group be doing?  Hard to say.  They might be:

     o  trying out software that hasn't been released yet;
     o  trying to get a piece of software to crashl
     o  trying to get it to stop crashing (i.e. debugging it);
     o  sending a group message to Genie;
     o  playing a game;
     o  fixing hardware;
     o  reminiscing about previous KansasFests; or
     o  telling stories about the heyday of the Apple II.

There's a chance that the group will be "multi-tasking"--that is, doing 
more than one of these things at the same time.

     There are other extra-curricular events that have almost become KFest 
traditions:  the Roger Wagner tie report, Nerf(TM) warfare, and a game 
called Bite the Bag, which involves a paper bag and a sense of balance.  
But what about the "real" traditions?

Tradition I:  Celebrity Roast   If the term "celebrity roast" is new to 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   you, rest assured that it's not dangerous, 
not even to the celebrity.  Open flame is not involved, except 
metaphorically.  A roast is simply an event where members of a panel give 
short speeches which "honor" the celebrity guest by dishing out 
good-natured insults and back-handed compliments:  "Some people say that 
Joe Kohn, a child of the 1960s if ever there was one, would have made a 
good drug pusher.  This is patently untrue.  Joe still hasn't grasped the 
concept that it's only the _first_ hit that's free."  (Except that most of 
the jokes will be funnier than that.)  Ideally, the person being "roasted" 
is the keynote speaker from the previous KFest, but this isn't always 
possible.  This year, the celebrity is indeed Joe Kohn, publisher of 
_Shareware Solutions II_.

     This event is catered and held in the Avila cafeteria in the Marian 
center.  It's open to all KansasFest attendees, not just those staying on 
campus.

Tradition II:  Calling Genie   The link between KansasFest and Genie is too 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   complicated to go into here--suffice it to 
say that people always manage to find time to post early reports on Genie.  
(CompuServe and comp.sys.apple2 often get the news early, too.)

     Here are the Genie numbers local to Kansas City:

          Genie node      300/1200/2400   816-474-1778
          Genie node     9600             816-472-5178
          SprintNet      2400             816-472-1430
          SprintNet     14400             816-421-5783

     Don't worry about long-distance charges within the city.  The greater 
metropolitan area of Kansas City is in two states with two area codes (816 
for Missouri and 913 for Kansas).  However, nearly all calls within the 
Kansas City metropolitan area are local.

     Remember that you need to prefix the number with a 9 (to get an 
outside line) and either a "wait for dialtone" command (w) or "pause" 
command (,) before you dial the number.

Tradition III:  Dining Out   I confess I've never been part of this 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''   tradition, but I hear that it's traditional to 
take at least one meal at one of two restaurants (or both!)--KC Masterpiece 
and Jesse & Jims.  The attraction is Kansas City steak, or so they tell me.

     If you hang out in the dorm rooms, you're bound to hear of groups 
heading off to "dine posh".  Ask to be counted in... and tell me what 
happens, all the gory details.  The thought of breaking bread with some of 
these people intrigues me.


A TYPICAL DAY   A KansasFest day doesn't begin when you might it expect it 
"""""""""""""   to.  It begins right after supper.  The pressing question 
of something to eat over with, you take the aperitif of your choice--Jolt! 
cola, Dr Pepper, or Mountain Dew--and wander around the dorms to see who's 
doing what.  Some people will be staying up until VERY late.  The reason 
for this is that program bugs stay hidden until at least 2 AM, and the 
really obscure ones wait until 5 AM.

     When morning comes, you may or may not have gotten any sleep.  If you 
have, chances are that you didn't get much of it.  The cafeteria staff stop 
serving breakfast at 8:30, but you may decide that sleep is more important.  
In fact, you may decide that sleep is more important than being at the 
first session.  Or the first two sessions.  Or world peace.

     Eventually you get out of bed and dither over which of the 
simultaneous sessions you want to attend.  You can bring paper or a 
computer to take notes, if you wish--no one will laugh or point.  No one 
will frown if you don't take notes, either.

     All sessions will run over their allotted time.  This is an immutable 
rule.  The domino theory rapidly comes into play here, which wreaks merry 
havoc with the schedule.

     After the morning sessions, there's an hour to get some lunch at the 
cafeteria at Marian center.  (Lunch is available to all attendees, whether 
staying on campus or not.)  No one takes attendance here, either.

     During lunch, the stragglers begin to arrive, and afternoon sessions 
may be more generously attended and received, since pretty much everyone is 
now awake and reasonably certain that life is worth living.  The afternoon 
sessions will officially end at 5:00 or 5:30, but they may last a while 
longer, since no one else is waiting to use the room.  It's possible to get 
so involved in the final session for the day that you miss the evening meal 
at the cafeteria.

     Or perhaps you've decided to give the cafeteria a miss.  Someone 
might be headed to a restaurant for a meal--ask around.  After you've 
eaten, well... the cycle begins all over.


LEAVING   Avila College hosts events other than KansasFest--in fact, 
"""""""   Avila's summers are tightly booked.  In previous years, both 
Ridgway and Carondelet dorms have been available to KFesters, but this 
year, the organizing committee could only get one.  That should give you 
some idea of how hectic things are.

     Because Avila is playing host to others after KansasFest is over, be 
sure to check out on time.  This year, you have the option of staying over 
on Saturday night and checking out on Sunday, but don't push it.  Avila 
still probably wants you out of there by 11 AM on Sunday.  (Check your 
KFest information packet for the exact time.)

     Incidentally, if you're travelling with Quicksilver, don't forget 
that you must have booked your return trip to the airport at least 24 hours 
in advance.  Since most people leave at much the same time, it may be 
possible to cadge a lift to the airport if you've made friends with someone 
heading that way.

     This is far from the end.  In fact, it's not even the beginning.  If 
you've been reading this, it's undoubtedly to prepare for KansasFest, which 
means it's all still to come!  So have a great time at KansasFest--and if 
you spot the man who began it all, Tom Weishaar (a/k/a "Uncle DOS"), give 
him my warmest regards.

Apple IIgs Owners' Survey
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Andy Middleton
   [L.MIDDLETON3]



     The May 1996 issue of GenieLamp A2 carried a request for the users of 
Genie's A2 RoundTable to respond to a survey.  This issue, we present the 
results of that survey.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Many thanks to all who answered.  In fact 40 people responded to my 
survey.  It may not sound like a lot but the info I received was plenty and 
took quite a bit of time to go through.

 1.  HOW MUCH MEMORY IN YOUR GS?

     Almost everyone has at least 4 megs of RAM.  Several (including 
myself) have 8 megs.

 2.  DO YOU OWN A HARD DRIVE?  HOW MANY MEGS?  WHAT SYSTEM SOFTWARE?

     Everyone reported that they had some size of a hard drive and use 
System 6.0.1.

 3.  DO YOU OWN A CD-ROM DRIVE?

     22 of the 40 who responded own a CD-ROM drive.  One person who 
doesn't have one owns the Golden Orchard CD!  Now that is dedication to the 
Apple II!

 4.  WHAT OTHER PERIPHERALS DO YOU HAVE?

     Those who responded to this question have the usual setup at least 
one 3.5" and one 5.25" drives.  Some people didn't mention it.  Is it safe 
to assume that they have some type of drives?  Those that have sound cards 
own mainly the SuperSonic Stereo Card from MDIdeas (like myself) or the 
SoundMeister.  A few people own the Sonic Blaster from AE.

     As for speed there are 31 Zips (plus one more counting mine) and 7 
Transwarps being used.  (Note:  I am including those who responded with 
more than one machine.)  I was surprised to see only 10 people (11 counting 
myself) own the Second Sight.  As for modems, 14.4s dominated the survey. I 
did get one or two 28.8s and even a 2400 (yikes!).  For SCSI cards, the 
RamFAST edged out the Apple High Speed Card out of those who owned one.

 5.  SLOT OCCUPANCY:

     [The responses to this item have not been summarized.]

 6.  DO YOU OWN ANOTHER COMPUTER BESIDES THE GS?

     Only 7 respondents (8 counting myself) do not own other computer 
besides our GS(s).

 7.  WHAT IS THE PRIMARY USE OF YOUR GS?

     These answers varied greatly.  A few said "for everything".  Several 
people answered word processing, entertainment, telecommunications, 
home/small business use.

 8.  DO YOU WRITE PROGRAMS FOR THE GS?

     Most of the responses came back with "no" or "not any more."  Some 
that said no would like to, however.  Those that do program do it for 
personal use only and are not looking to become some type of software 
programmer.

 9.  DO YOU BELONG TO AN APPLE USERS' GROUP?  IF SO, WHICH ONE(S)?

     19 of those that responded belong to a users' group.

10.  WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE GS SOFTWARE?

     Spectrum and CoPilot received the top votes.  Overall, telcom ware 
dominated this question (ANSI-Term, ProTERM, GEM, etc.).  Believe it or not 
Appleworks Classic 5.1 finished next in line, followed by AppleWorks GS and 
GraphicWriter III.  Two votes were given for software that turns lights 
on/off in the house.

(For the next three or four questions, please don't answer with items 
currently being worked on and/or upgraded.  Also be very realistic, if 
possible.  AWGS 2.0 is a dead issue so don't put that as an answer.)

11.  WHAT PIECE OF SOFTWARE THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE 
UPGRADED?  WHAT KIND OF ENHANCEMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ADDED TO IT OR 
IMPROVED?

     GS/OS was the clear winner with about 4 or 5 votes.  Many people want 
a Second Sight patch done to QuickDraw II and want to see the bugs removed. 
Although I asked respondents not to use it, AppleWorks GS received two or 
three votes for a complete rewrite.  SuperConvert was mentioned three or 
four times--people want JPEG support.  CoPilot was mentioned twice.  
GraphicWriter III was mentioned three or four times--better handling of 
picture objects.

12.  WHAT NEW PROGRAM WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE COME OUT FOR THE GS?

     This one was actually a no-brainer.  The majority of votes were for a 
web browser for the net.  Some people even said that the ability to view 
the graphics is not a necessity for it.  Other programs receiving more than 
one vote were a new full-fledged word processor like WordPerfect or MS Word 
on a PC or Mac.  Also software for use of a flatbed scanner on a GS was 
mentioned more than twice.

13.  ANY NEW HARDWARE/PERIPHERALS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOR THE GS?

     Not many people had an answer for this one, but those who did gave 
votes to an Ethernet card, flatbed scanner, a faster accelerator and a full 
stereo sound card.

14.  ANY YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE REVISED?

     Again, not many answered but those who did agreed on a revision of 
the Second Sight, a faster Zip (about 20 mhz), the Soundmeister upgraded to 
the Pro version.  Some people answered with software upgrades but that 
should have been for question 11.  Also one person mentioned a Pentium 
processor for the PC Transporter.

15.  FOR QUESTIONS 11-14, HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PAY FOR 
EACH?  (TRY TO CONSIDER THE PROGRAM WRITERS' OR HARDWARE DEVELOPERS' TIME 
AND EFFORT.)

     This question was probably the hardest for people to answer.  I think 
if developers were to see these answers, they would probably decide whether 
or not it is worth putting something out on the market.  Those who didn't 
list specific prices for items gave an average price range of $30-$200 for 
software.  This depended on the features that are put into the program. 
Hardware varied a little more, about $50-$300.  The GS Web browser fell 
between $20-$100.  A full fledged word processor (either an AWGS upgrade or 
other) went between $90-$150.  Software upgrades averaged out to about $35 
depending on how major the upgrade turns out.

16.  WITH SUCH A SMALL AND LIMITED MARKET FOR THE GS, DO YOU FEEL THERE 
SHOULD BE COMPETITION AMONG SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE?  (FOR EXAMPLE:  AUTOARK 
AND HARDPRESSED.)

     Those who gave me straight-out answers voted 12 to 10 in favor of 
competition.  The majority of cases cited the fax software scenario.  Those 
who did not said that competition was okay, however cooperation is needed 
also.  I did not count these votes in the numbers I mentioned.  Some stated 
that competition was okay for small projects but bigger projects should 
involve cooperation from various developers/programmers (like the system 
software upgrade) so that many new features can be added and most of the 
bugs can be eliminated.  A few people took this question literally and 
thought I was talking specifically about AutoArk and HardPressed.  They 
said to buy a Zip drive or a bigger hard drive and use a backup software or 
disk compression program!

17.  FEEL FREE TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE GS:

     About half of those who responded gave comments.  Out of these 
people, about 85% feel quite content with the GS.  A few people mentioned 
that the GS doesn't need to go through as many repairs or tinkerings as a 
PC would.  (Agreed!!)  The other 15% stated that the time to move to a PC 
or Power Mac is in sight.  The reasons given are the software and hardware 
availability that cant be found on a GS.  One person expressed that the 
reason for this is because owners/users don't want to pay what a developer 
feels he/she should get.

                                 [*][*][*]


     I have to say I really enjoy using my GS.  Yes, it is slower than the 
rest but we don't need to worry about major hardware upgrades to keep up 
with today's technology.  My word processors' output can look exactly like 
the output of WordPerfect or Word on a Mac or PC.

     Thanks again to everyone who responded.  Lets hoper developers and 
program authors see this survey to find out what really want and how much 
we will pay for it!

     Apple II forever and ever!

AppleWorks 5 Documentation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



                UNOFFICIAL APPLEWORKS 5 DELTA MANUAL UPDATE
                """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
           Copyright 1996 by Douglas Cuff.  All rights reserved.


     I wrote the delta manual for AppleWorks 5.0 in September and October 
1994.  A lot has happened since then.  For instance, an update--AppleWorks 
5.1--was released in the summer of 1995.  It's time to update the 
AppleWorks 5 delta manual as well.

     I'll be covering 8 basic areas in this article:

     o  features programmed but not covered by the manual;
     o  documentation you should have gotten but didn't;
     o  factual errors in the manual;
     o  one serious typographic error;
     o  simple typographic errors;
     o  AppleWorks 5.1 changes and new features;
     o  things not to do (problems without fixes); and
     o  common problems and fixes.

     One important correction doesn't fit into any of these areas, and it 
has to do with who wrote the manual.  My answer is not "me".  My answer is 
"mostly me".  I am the principal author, not the sole author.  Whole 
sections of the AppleWorks 5 delta manual are based on documentation that 
Randy Brandt wrote (for Beagle Bros's Outline 3.0, JEM's DB Pix, and so 
on).  Perhaps the credit on the title page should really read "by Doug Cuff 
with Randy Brandt".  Thanks, Randy.

     Another tidbit which doesn't fit into the body of this article has to 
do with an omission in the AppleWorks 4 reference manual.  When you visit 
the Time-based options in the Standard Settings menu, you should know that 
turning on auto-save _automatically_ turns on the keeping backups of files 
(in the Miscellaneous portion of the Standard Settings menu).  Many of you 
have figured this out, but it doesn't seem to be documented.

     An important note before you begin:  This is not an official 
document.  I wrote the AppleWorks 5 delta manual for Quality Computers (now 
doing business as Scantron Quality Computers).  I don't own the update 
manual; they do.  Any official update document has to come from them, not 
me.


WHAT THERE WASN'T TIME TO TELL YOU   When AppleWorks 5 was being tested, 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   programmers Randy Brandt and Dan 
Verkade kept adding features.  One or two features were added, or the way 
they worked changed, too late to be documented.  (The documentation 
deadline was more than a month earlier than the software deadline.)

     The "AW5 Specs" file distributed on the AppleWorks program disk notes 
one feature not described in the manual:  in the word processor, when using 
OA-O to enter printer options, pressing OA-Return after either the code or 
the numeric value associated with the code (as with indentation and 
margins) makes for a quick return to the file.  With OA-Return, you no 
longer have to press Escape at the OA-O prompt.  This can be a significant 
time-saver.

     As the delta manual tells you, you can hold down both Apple keys as 
you boot AppleWorks if you want to TimeOut to load Utilities only, for a 
faster start.  UltraMacros and the Init Manager will also be off for that 
session, which is something the manual does not mention.

     The AppleWorks 4 manual tells you (on page 465) that you can 
configure certain inits by holding down the OA key.  This is not true for 
AppleWorks 5.  Holding down the _SA_ key lets choose which inits and which 
AfterWork modules you want installed.  (There is an anomaly associated with 
this, though.  If you continue to hold down the SA key as you press N for 
no, three modules in a row will be deselected.)  The AfterWork modules are 
loaded first.  If you want to load all the AfterWork modules but want to 
select certain inits, you can begin holding down the SA key as the last 
AfterWork module is loaded.  Holding down the SA key does not affect the 
TimeOut options at all--all available TimeOut applications are loaded.

     If you hold down the SA key through the entire boot process, 
UltraMacros will not be loaded either.  (You can checked by pressing 
SA-Escape.  If UltraMacros are not loaded, you will see the message "Dot 
cmd error".)  If you release the SA key after you make the decision about 
the final init in the list, UltraMacros will be loaded, but the startup 
macro will not run.

     If you hold down the OA key as you boot, you are not asked any 
questions.  Holding down the OA key produces similar results to holding 
down both Apple keys--only TimeOut Utilities are loaded--except that this 
time, UltraMacros and the Init Manager will be loaded... but only if that 
how you have the options set in the Standard Settings menu.  If you 
normally have either option turned off, holding down OA during the boot 
will not turn them on.

     To sum up, hold down both Apple keys for the fastest start.  Hold 
down the OA key for a fast start that leaves UltraMacros active.

     Two UltraMacros commands disappeared from AppleWorks 5, "store" and 
"recall".  Their disappearance is not documented in the delta manual.  
Under AppleWorks 5.0, these commands appear to be processed but will not 
work!  Under AppleWorks 5.1, the compiler will tell you that it no longer 
recognizes these commands by giving you a syntax error when it tries to 
process them.

     While it has nothing to do with the development of the program, time 
is also the reason that there is no index in the AppleWorks 5 delta manual.  
You will find an index on _Texas II_ Disk 14, and those who were 
subscribing to this magazine on disk at the time this disk was issued were 
lucky enough to receive a paper copy of the index.


WHAT THERE WASN'T ROOM TO TELL YOU   Along with the delta manual, I 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   submitted the necessary changes and 
additions to the AppleWorks Quick Reference card.  Presumably it was too 
expensive to print a new reference card.  If you'd like to make the changes

     There was no room in the manual for a reference page for the Outliner 
nor room on the Quick Reference card for another column.  Users will have 
to rely on the built-in help menu, or use the following chart:

     OA-A Add son

     The manual does not make clear which word processor markers are 
reserved for the Outliner module.  These are markers 192-254.


FACTUAL ERRORS   The manual claims that AppleWorks 5 is not available on 
""""""""""""""   5.25" disk.  In fact, Quality Computers shipped it on 
seven 5.25" disks, but these were intended only to allow 5.25" drive users 
to install AppleWorks 5 to a hard drive.  The 5.25" drive option is no 
longer officially supported, but it is possible to create a set of 5.25" 
disks that will run AppleWorks 5.  Not terribly wise, but possible.

     If inactivity is detected when a cell memo is open, the AfterWork 
screen saver will only work on an Apple IIgs.  The manual doesn't have this 
wrong, it just doesn't mention it.


ONE SERIOUS TYPOGRAPHIC ERROR   Page 20 and page 87 both give the wrong 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   parameter for saving text files in the 
Merlin assembler format.  You should use "pokeword $0A76,$80A0" and 
"pokeword $0A76,9".  "Pokeword $A72" is wrong.  This location of this 
feature was changed after the manual was written.

     (This feature to create Merlin-compatible files will not work if the 
first character in the file is a Return.  Make sure the file does not begin 
with a Return character.  Also, in some circumstances, tab rulers will be 
saved to the Merlin file instead of being ignored, as they should properly 
be.)


SIMPLE TYPOGRAPHIC ERRORS   On page 16, there's a claim that the heat-death 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   of the universe isn't due to happen for several 
million years.  This should read several billion years.  (Mind you, a 
billion equals several million anyway, so what's all the fuss?)

     On page 29, the second sentence of the first paragraph begins 
"AppleWorks 4 used Control-T for spaces, but AppleWorks 4 uses that key 
to...".  This should read "but AppleWorks 5 uses that key to...".

     On page 41, the note for Outline 3.0 users ends with the text 
"{outdent}".  This is a formatting code inadvertently left in the finished 
manual.  You can't pin this one on me. <grin>

     On page 91, the second part of the first answer ends with the 
sentence "See the section of Disabling AfterWork for more files that you 
can delete."  This should read "See the section on...".


APPLEWORKS 5.1 CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES   Plenty of bugs were squashed with 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   AppleWorks 5.1 release.  It's 
free, so there's really no excuse not to move from AppleWorks 5.0 to 5.1.  
Please don't ask me to list all the bug fixes in AppleWorks 5.1.

     The UltraMacros .awpath command had a bug which left a trailing "/" 
at the end of the string.  That has been fixed, but the fix breaks the 
default macros as supplied with AppleWorks _5.0_.  Use the new default 
macros as supplied with AppleWorks 5.1.  Also, change any of your own 
macros that used a work-around for the .awpath bug.

     In the data base, the Set Preferences option now allows you to set a 
date format for each individual data base file.  This means you can have 
the general setting display a date such as "June 24, 1995" for the macro 
sa-' command and for the word processor date option, while using numeric or 
abbreviated dates in the data base.  The preferences may also be used to 
keep a year from being added to a date for which you wish to record only 
the month and day.  The bad news is that you should probably update all 
your existing data base files to reflect this new setting.  The good news 
is that you'll only have to do this once.  Plus, it's worth it.

     Binary search now finds numbers with leading 0's, and requires an 
exact match.  If you don't want an exact match, hold down the OA key.

     The DB Replace TimeOut application now lets you choose to search for 
whole words only.  As with AppleWorks, use the OA key to indicate a search 
for whole words--either use OA-Return instead of Return when selecting 
"Anywhere" or "In one category", or press OA-A or OA-I instead of A or I.


THINGS NOT TO DO   Here are a few things that you should not do in 
""""""""""""""""   AppleWorks 5:

     o  Don't use the Installer if you already have a folder called AW5 on 
        the volume you're installing to.  Rename or delete the first AW5 
        folder before beginning.  If you attempt to use the Installer and 
        you already have a folder called AW5 on the volume you're 
        installing to, the Installer will hang!

     o  Don't use the Control-Q/Control-W Quick Find feature in the 
        Outliner.

     o  Don't use the three following MouseText characters when filling 
        out fields in the data base:  Solid-Apple (@), Mouse Pointer (B), 
        or Lower Left Corner (T).  You may still use these characters when 
        creating background text.

     o  Don't use OA-- (Open-Apple-hyphen), the keyboard shortcut for the 
        UltraMacros command "cell", while creating a cell note in the 
        spreadsheet.  It won't work, and it may do some harm.

     o  Don't try to access the TimeOut menu from the Clipboard (OA-Q OA-C 
        then OA-Escape).  If you do, AppleWorks 5 will crash!

     o  Don't use the TimeOut DIF applications from anywhere but the Main 
        Menu.


A FEW PROBLEMS AND FIXES   Worksheets created with AppleWorks 4.3 may have 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   their NT (Number of Times to recalculate) option 
set to 1 under AppleWorks 5.0.  No fix is known.

     The data base Preferences screen does not allow you to toggle the 
"recalc order" message.  To see this, get into a data base file, press 
OA-O, select option 6 ("set preferences") and examine option 7.  There is a 
fix for this in _Texas II_'s Bev's Free Patcher v6.0 for AppleWorks 5.1.

     Quality Computers shipped AppleWorks 5.0 with a slightly screwy 
version of the ImageWriter II printer installed.  If you find that your 
ImageWriter II prints in standard mode even when you manually tell the 
printer to use near letter-quality mode, you have found the problem.  Three 
possible fixes:

     1.  Upgrade to AppleWorks 5.1--a good idea anyway--which doesn't have 
         this problem.  Be sure to copy the SEG.ER file!

     2.  Choose "Remove a printer" from the Print settings menu, then add 
         ImageWriter II to the list again.  It's that simple.

     3.  Choose "Change printer specifications" then choose "Interface 
         cards".  If the current control characters are "control-I 80N 
         Escape c" (restore default settings), all you have to do is change 
         these codes.  You could choose simply "control-I 80N" or enter 
         "control-I 80N Escape K0", which resets the printing color to 
         black.

There are even more drastic solutions, such as selling off your ImageWriter 
II printer, or never using AppleWorks again, or donating your Apple II to 
the national debt, but I can't recommend them.

     Any Apple IIgs user who finds that AppleWorks 5 crashes when it is 
run, or finds that it crashes the second time it is run, should use Randy 
Free's Patcher, which is supplied with AppleWorks 5, (or Bev's Free 
Patcher) to change the setting of GS/OS background tasks.  Some people find 
that the crashes happen if background tasks are on.  Others find that 
crashes occur if the tasks are off.

     Despite the appearance of these and other unconfirmed bugs in 
AppleWorks 5.1, it is a very stable release.  Please don't be frightened 
away from AppleWorks 5.1.  Even with a few minor and obscure bugs, it's 
still more stable than AppleWorks 4.x or 5.0!

     This feature lists the ten most popular files for the month.  To give 
files a chance to seek their own levels, no files will be added to the list 
until they've been in place at least a month.  This month, we look at the 
files uploaded 1-31 May 1996.

     This isn't the Academy Awards ceremony, folks; it's more like the 
People's Choice Awards (both of which are trademarked, by the way).  The 
Top 10 doesn't necessarily tell you what's new and interesting--what files 
_you_ might find interesting--it simply tells you what files have been 
downloaded a lot--what other people found interesting!

                            """""""""""""""""""

     The process of panning for gold involves one heck of a lot of 
throwing away stuff that isn't gold.  This month, the Treasure Hunt looks 
at some of the files in the A2 Library that have had fewer than 6 
downloads.  All of these files were uploaded from 3-1/2 to 6 years ago.

     I don't want to make fun of anyone, and I certainly don't want to 
discourage anyone from uploading their work.  What I would like to do is 
look at some files that were unpopular, and try to guess why.  Please don't 
assume this has any implications for any files you were thinking about 
uploading!

                                 [*][*][*]


                File #19389:  SOUV.PAGES.BXY (16128 bytes)
                """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This AppleWorks data base lists souvenir pages that have been issued 
by the American post office.  The only reason I can think of for its 
apparent lack of popularity is that there aren't a lot of philatelists in 
the Apple II community.  Typing in data is a long and thankless task, and 
most such data is quickly downloaded.  There's no reason that I can see for 
this file to have had so few download hits.

                File #16788:  LAGOVERNOR.BXY (15488 bytes)
                """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This IIgs Super Hi Res graphic shows three line-drawing type 
portraits of three Louisiana gubernatorial candidates.  I don't imagine 
politics is a hot area in computer-related RoundTables, but there are 
probably two other reasons why this file had only been downloaded 5 times 
by the time I began this column.  The first reason is limited time, and the 
second is limited space.  This file was uploaded in October 1991, which was 
probably not long before the actual election.  After the election, who 
cares?  Also, even if you assume that all Genie's callers are 
American--which you shouldn't--then less than 2% of the callers should 
logically turn out to be from Louisiana.  Heck, I uploaded a short 
AppleWorks data base of prime ministers of Canada--even though there are 
over 25 million Canadians, very few people downloaded that file.  In fact, 
I feel gratified that it has been downloaded as many times as it has.

                 File #18698:  IBMPC.M.BXY (1555456 bytes)
                 """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This is a data base, in DB Master format, of all of the files in the 
IBM PC RoundTable library on Genie as of mid-1992.  It has several things 
working against it.  First, it's hard to imagine a file that would become 
outdated as quickly.  Even the file above has a long shelf-life compared to 
library listings, since the latter are out of date by the time you compile 
them and save them to disk.  Second, DB Master was never a popular data 
base once AppleWorks took hold of the market.  Third, not everyone in the 
A2 RoundTable has an IBM-compatible computer, and therefore has limited 
interest in the IBM RT.  Fourth, those that have both computers are not 
necessarily going to want a list of IBM files on their Apple II computer.

                File #14661:  BLU.VIDEX.2.BXY (10080 bytes)
                """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This file contains a patch so that Videx 80-column card owners can 
use Floyd Zink's freeware Binary Library Utility.  BLU was an extremely 
popular program before ShrinkIt came along.  I had always supposed that 
Videx was a pretty popular 80-column card, too.  I suppose the distinction 
is that Videx cards were not popular by the time BLU was being used.  
(After all, Apple Computer had been releasing Apple II computers with 
built-in 80-column cards for over 6 years by the time this file was 
uploaded.)  The lesson here is that uploads that require specific but 
no-longer-popular hardware don't get many download hits.

     This file has an interesting parallel--PARADE.SB.BXY--which is a 
music file specific to the Sonic Blaster sound card.  The same music, 
released in a format that was not hardware-specific, was considerably more 
popular.

               File #11753:  RTC.TECHWARE.TXT (20160 bytes)
               """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This ASCII text file is a transcript of a Real-Time Conference about 
Tutor-Tech with TechWare's David Lampert.  It beats me why this has been 
downloaded so few times.  Tutor-Tech is hypermedia for the Apple IIe and 
IIc.  Given the popularity of HyperCard and HyperStudio, you would have 
thought people would have been rushing to download this file.  Does anyone 
out there know why Tutor-Tech never got the respect it deserves?

                                 [*][*][*]


     That's all for this month.  I hope you enjoyed this look at five of 
the _least_ popular files in the Apple II libraries.  I hope I haven't 
offended anyone, and most of all, I hope this column won't deter you from 
contributing your own uploads to the A2 RoundTable.  Don't worry that it's 
not significant enough!  All contributions gratefully accepted.
