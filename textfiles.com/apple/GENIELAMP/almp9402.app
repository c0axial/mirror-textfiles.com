Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
By Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



                  >>> EVERYBODY OUT OF THE GENE POOL <<<
                  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Details are still a little sketchy, but the spring catalog from 
Resource Central notes that there will be an ICON Summer Conference this 
July in Kansas City.  Since it's sponsored by the International Computer 
Owners Network, it might not be exactly the same KansasFest of old, but you 
can bet that it will attract the Apple II community.  (For those of you 
just tuning in, ICON runs the Apple II, Macintosh, and PowerPC RoundTables 
on GEnie.  The Resource Central empire seems to be changing and expanding.)

     The upcoming conference, whatever its name, started me thinking.  
What with one thing and another -- poverty, and formerly living on an 
island, in a city within five miles of Canada's easternmost point, being 
chief among them -- I've never looked in on Uncle DOS and the usual 
suspects when they gather in Kansas City during the summer.  Therefore I 
don't really know what happens and who turns up.

     From what I hear, however -- chiefly through reports in Shareware 
Solutions II, in our sister publication, GEnieLamp A2Pro, and "live" on 
GEnie itself -- the event attracts old-timers and newcomers.  It attracts 
people who are online and those who aren't.

     Both these points strike me as being extremely important.  We of the 
Apple II community need to meet newcomers and to be introduced to people 
who don't own a modem... if only to persuade them to buy one!  Otherwise, 
the Apple II gene pool will become extremely limited.  It's not as if we 
represent any serious threat to computing as it is, but unless we seek out 
those just lurking outside the light of our campfire, things are going to 
get mighty incestuous.

     When I bought my first modem, I started looking for a local BBS.  
Because of their unofficial nature, there weren't any listed in the 
telephone directory, so I was forced to cast my net widely.  I started on a 
multi-national information/communication network much like GEnie.  From 
there, I tracked down a private BBS in Toronto -- Canada's equivalent of 
Detroit, New York, or Chicago... depending on who you ask.  The BBS in 
Toronto, Ontario led me one province east to a BBS in Montreal, Quebec.  
The BBS in Montreal led me to one much closer to home, in Canada's Maritime 
region.  (All this time, my phone bill was mounting.)  I got as close as 
Halifax, Nova Scotia, but could not get beyond that... and there was no way 
I could afford to call long-distance for my daily telecommunications fix.  
I gave up.

     Some months later, I picked up a local teacher's newsletter, and 
discovered that there was a local BBS within about two miles of my house.  
Once I had made that first call, I soon found half a dozen other BBSes 
being mentioned, and learned the first rule of BBSes:  BBSes concentrate on 
advertising themselves on other BBSes.  Instead of looking for new 
customers, they try to poach users from other system operators.

     The lesson is, I hope, clear.  Before you open that important first 
door, you think you're alone in the house.  Once you open the right door, 
though, you'll find a party going on.

     "Yes, but surely, by now, everybody knows about at least one Apple II 
magazine or on-line service?" I hear you say.  (Well, when I'm the one 
writing the editorials, I jolly well hear you say it.)

     "Not by a long shot," I reply.

     Just two months ago, quite by chance, one poor, lost soul with an 
Apple II Plus, two Disk ][ drives, and a barbarically slow DOS 3.3 
application program happened to meet one of our local Apple II experts.  
Upon learning of a ProDOS version of the same program -- even of the 
existence of ProDOS itself -- this individual's eyes reportedly became as 
wide as salad plates, and said eyes were close to filling with tears.  This 
person's reaction to the news flash that there was an Apple II user's group 
close by, I leave to the reader's imagination.

     With that insularity very much in my mind, I'm pleased to announce 
that this issue contains an article from a Apple II enthusiast outside the 
GEnie network... Ron Higgins has contributed a piece on a bug in the Apple 
Super Serial Card.  I'd like to thank Ron for helping us dispel the myth 
that GEnieLamp A2 is only for those on GEnie.  Not only are GEnieLamp A2 
readers found on networks other than GEnie, but our contributors are 
sometimes outside the fold too.  We welcome your submissions, no matter 
where you are!  It's wonder to receive an article from outside the GEne 
pool -- I hope the first won't be the last.

     If you have some obscure piece of hardware, or some kind of _strange_ 
hardware problems, or just want to learn a bit about what makes your Apple

soldering iron is! :) Smokers are welcome, we have special air handling 
equipment for the comfort of non smokers :)

     If you have any questions about hardware, the care and feeding 
thereof, modification tips, etc. please bring them to the RTC next 
Wednesday night. If we run out of hardware stuff, one never knows what the 
topic will turn to... (last night it was ASCII art, which Bird does quite 
nicely :)

HOW _DARE_ WE OUTPERFORM AT LOWER COST?   This is a MAJOR COMPLAINT about
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   AppleWorks 4.0.  I use a Mac at 
work and AppleWorks 4 is making it look bad.  Most of the people at work 
have either a Mac or Apple II at home, the ones that have computers anyway.

     They keep coming up to me and asking why the $500 Mac program, they 
just purchased, can't do some of the stuff AppleWorks 4.0 can do.  What 
should I tell them?  Although this posting is mostly "toung 'n cheek", it 
is based on fact.  I know your name is "Quality", but can't you just 
slack-off a little until the people at Apple give the Mac an AppleWorks.

(That means I keep my freedom, _and_ get to pay lots of self-employment tax 
and medical insurance.)  It's been a very enjoyable arrangement for me, and 
hopefully for them as well.  People have warned me about the dangers of 
writing Apple II software (it's a dead market!) since 1984.  I started at 
Beagle back then with just a wife and an apartment.  By May we'll have five 
kids living in our house, with virtually all payments being made by
Apple II software sales.  While it's true no one is getting rich from the

     I have been using the DiscQuest software with a RamFAST (with latest 
SS ROM) and an Apple PowerCD.  Everything works as advertised with the 
CD-ROM that was sent with the package, The Family Doctor.  The graphics are 
not in color but much more detailed than I expected.  My only complaint is 
the selection of currently available CD-ROM software does not really 
interest me. If I could get an encylcopedia CD-ROM, it would go from being 
a good purchase to a great purchase.  I would be happy to answer any other 
specific questions.

SWIM CHIP   I need a bit of help...
"""""""""   I have a PCT here for repair, I beleive it has a dead drive 
controller chip on it... What does this have to do with SuperDrives?? 
Simple, the chip in question is an Apple chip! I strongly suspect that AE 
obtained these from Apple, and that they may be the same chip used on the 
SuperDrive controller cards.

     The Apple part number is:010-0101-1 (c) Apple 1987 It is a 44 pin 
PLCC (about 3/4" square surface mount chip)

     If someone with a SuperDrive controller could check for a chip with 
this number (it might end with -2 or higher) I'd appreciate it. (It would 
at least give me an idea of where I might be able to find a chip to fix 
this PCT)

     Thanks!

Applied Engineering purchased a number of those chips from Apple for use on 
their PC Transporter cards, to enable the PCT to have Apple drives

DOS 6.2 AND PC TRANSPORTER   For anyone interested, I got my PCT to work

EDUCATION, MODEMS, AND THE APPLE II   I received an e-mail letter this
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   morning related to the education 
survey that I uploaded recently. I prefer not to identify the writer, but I 
would like to share with you my response to something in the letter because 
I think it relates to this topic.

                                  ++++++

               In your letter you said, "I think it is fair to 
          say that education is not interested in this medium." 
          referring to online communications.

               I have to disagree. I believe that educators do 
          not frequent online services because (1) they do not 
          have access to the necessary equipment, (2) they do not 
          know what is available and the possibilities that 
          exist, (3) generally they do not have the time or money 
          necessary to explore online communications on their 
          own, and (4) educational institutions, particularly 
          public ones, do not encourage such activities for many 
          of the same reasons list above.

               Case in point: This fall I made it possible for 
          two teachers at my school to have their students 
          participate in an exchange of writings with students in 
          other parts of the country. This was through the 
          ScrapBook USA writing project headed by Emery Roth on 
          America On Line. I handled all of the online work from 
          my home because our school does not have access to a 
          modem and phone line to do this at school.

               The teachers and the students were excited about 
          the project and put a lot of effort into it. As it came 
          to a conclusion, I heard the same comments from many, 
          "It would be nice to be able to do more of this!"

               However, they won't unless I make it possible. 
          Neither of the teachers have a modem at home. The 
          school is not prepared to spend the money needed to 
          make online communications a possibility at school. The 
          costs involved include long-distance phone bills since 
          there are no local numbers for us and we have not been 
          able to convince those who control the purse strings 
          that it is worth the expense.

               Within five years I believe you will discover 
          that educators will be using online communications to 
          great advantage, because by that time education will 
          have caught up with _today's_ business world and the 
          difficulities I mentioned above will have been 
          overcome.

               The interest is there, and it is growing. The 
          problem for online services is to anticipate it and be 
          there waiting.

BUG IN SSC CHIP FIXED   As I promised, I have received, installed and 
"""""""""""""""""""""   test the new Harris CDP 65C51AE1 replacement chip 
for the standard 6551 on the Apple brand SSC. I ordered it from Lightning 
Systems, P.O. Box 4, Mukwonago, WI 53149-0004. (414) 363-4282

     As you know, the standard 6551 has a problem, when using CTS hardware 
handshaking, with trashing the character being sent when the CTS flow 
control line is asserted.

     I have personally experienced this problem on my SSC, using hardware 
CTS handshaking, driving a serial printer. (I use CTS handshaking rather 
than DTR or XON/XOFF for reasons I won't explain here.)

     I am pleased to report that the new chip has solved this problem, all 
for $4.00.

     But, there's more.

     With the chip, I received info about a $27 replacement chip for the 
6551 on the SSC, that supports additional baud rates of 38.4K, 57.6K, 
115.2K and 230.4K.

     From personal experience, I know my Zipped //e has enough trouble 
keeping up at 19,200 baud with ProTerm, so I have seriously to wonder about 
the practical effect of being able to use the higher bauds rates.  Anyone 
care to speculate?

     FWIW, here is what the sales sheet says:

          -------------------------------------------------------

          Turbo ASB

               Do you have a high-speed modem, or other 
          high-speed serial communications device? Did you know 
          that most Serial Interface Cards for the Apple II are 
          limited to only 19.2k bps?

               Well, they don't have to be anymore. The Turbo 
          ASB can blow away that nasty 19.2k bps barrier. With 
          the Turbo ASB, your serial communications can run as 
          fast as 230,400 bps!!!

               The Turbo ASB replaces that pokey old 6551 chip 
          on your Serial Interface Card and transforms it into a 
          speed demon.

               The Turbo ASB supports all the standard bps rates 
          you are used to (slow...) and adds 38.4k, 57.6k, 115.2k 
          and 230.4k!

               The Turbo ASB is available from Lightning 
          Systems. Order product "Turbo ASB". $27.00 each plus 
          $3.00 S&H in the States, $10.00 S&H everywhere else.

          -------------------------------------------------------

     Can the IIe handle 230,400 bps?  For that matter, can the IIGS?

Hugh...           (H.HOOD, CAT12, TOP5, MSG:170/M645;1)

>>>>>   Hmmm.... "dis 'ere chip sounds neat" :)
"""""   I know, from experience, that a stock //e can handle 19.2KBps, as 
long as minimal screen handling is done. (ie: feeding a bunch of stuff to a 
printer, or some other device) Receiving 19.2KBps is also doable, the catch 
again is trying to keep a screen updated...

     I would think that if the slick code was written for this new chip, 
and used on a //e with an 8Mhz Zip Chip, that the max baud rate it could 
handle (in bursts) would possibly be as high as 230.4KBps.

     The biggest bottlenecks in handling the serial port is trying to keep 
the screen updated properly, and the _long_ delays for disk I/O, should 
they be needed. The disk I/O problem (for the most part) goes away with a 
RamFast (Hello cached DMA, Goodby huge overhead times :) but the screen 
still needs some real special handling... It's do-able, but somewhat tricky 
to program (due to the 80 col screen being held in two seperate banks of 
memory.) This screen handling would require hard coded line address lookup 
tables, with even / odd bank information being extracted from the 
horizontal posn.

     PMP, (Paul) should be able to comment on what he's found as far as 
high speed serial goes, after all he wrote AnsiTERM (and it handles some 
high speed stuff :)

"""""   systems concerning using the //e with his Turbo ASB replacement 
chip for the 6551 in the SSC.

          =======================================================

               My Apple //e has got a Zip Chip 8000 (8 MHz) in 
          it, so may results may be better than others.

               I've been able to use ProTERM v3.1 running at 
          57,600bps without any problems.  115,200bps overruns it 
          though.

               The need that I see the Turbo ASB filling is 
          those that have modems faster than 14.4k (V.32bis).

               The reason for this is that compressed files (the 
          most commonly transferred) achieve about 1650cps 
          (16,500bps), but as modems get faster and faster (I've 
          got a 21.6k USR) the transfer rate starts to exceed the 
          19.2k limit of the SSC.

               I feel that 38,400bps should be just about right 
          for those high-speed modems.  (At least for now)  But 
          I've also provided for 57,600 and 115,200 if we need 
          them.

KOHN HIRES HEINEMAN TO CREATE PRINT SHOP UTILITY   Bill Heineman has 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   proclaimed to me that he 
will be able to create some type of program patch for Print Shop GS so that 
greeting cards, signs, banners, etc can be printed to Hewlett-Packard 
DeskJet 500, DJ500c, DJ550c, LaserJet and DeskWriter printers, as well as 
to Apple's StyleWriter I printer.

     Now that Bill has had a chance to look at PSGS, and knows what would 
be involved and how much time would be needed to complete the project, he 
was able to give me a revised quote on the cost.

     It's a lot higher than previously estimated.

     So, thinking again out loud...the pledges that have come in so far 
will only cover a small percentage of that cost. So, maybe that's not quite 
the way to go?

     I wonder if a more realistic scenario might be that I just pay Bill 
his fee, and then publish the results as a low cost commercial software 
product, with a special "Such A Deal" discount offered, of course, to 
Shareware Solutions II subscribers.

     OTOH, being a man of my word, the reward is still open, and will go 
to the first person that can create a freeware or shareware patch/utility.

     The only thing that bothers me about the "contest" and reward is that 
it's just so uncertain.  Maybe it'll result in a Shareware Solution, but 
maybe it won't?  To date, no other programmer has contacted me to tell me 
that they are working on such a project.

this for the few hundred dollars that has already been pledged, and then 
release it as freeware.

thoughts on reading your comments about taking pre-orders is that it would 
take a lot of paperwork to stay on top of, and probably some accounting

writer.  Then, the completed program/patch/whatever would be sold as a 
commercial product through Shareware Solutions II.

     In that way, no one else besides me is taking a risk of any kind.

     The completed product would then be available for the same ball-park 
figures as several people have pledged ($20-$25). Maybe $20 for subscribers 
and $25 for non-subscribers?

     Switching gears...I just want to say that Shareware Solutions II is 
the first business venture that I've ever been involved with, having always 
worked for others before.  I guess at this point that I'm asking for some 
business type of advice.  If it's inappropriate for me to be talking about 
things like this "in public", someone just tell me.  As I said in Issue #1, 
this is all new ground for me.

SPECTRUM AND SECURITY   Two points about security when using "Spectrum"
"""""""""""""""""""""   With some of my calls I have to dial a number which 
includes a 10 digit PIN to connect to our Mercury Phone system.  This would 
be visible to anyone who opened the dialing menu.

     Sending a PassWord from the internal store is visible & liable to be 
in a capture buffer if connected to a Full Duplex system.  I have proved 
this.

     Using scripts for dialling& log on gives you more scope for 
protecting sensitive info.

     My way of ensuring they do not get passed on with scripts is to store 
them in a 'File' which I can hide anywhere on my 105mByte drive.  The 
script only needs to know the location of it.  As an exercise in security I 
have protected this further with a PIN.  Although no one else has access to 
my system I could set it so that if someone tries unsuccesfully to run the 
script the file would be over written, not just deleted.

NEW FINANCIAL GENIUS   Financial GeniuS * v 2.0 has been released!  This is
""""""""""""""""""""   a financial program similar to others on the market 
today.  FULL featured, cheaper, and more user friendly than ANY other 
financial program. And this one is for your GS.

     Financial GeniuS is a program that will store your financial records 
and allow you easy access to this information in many forms.  Financial 
GeniuS has the ability to produce a variety of report forms which will 
allow budgeting, cost projections, credit card management, investment 
management, tax return reports, year-to-date analyses,  and many other 
useful applications.  All entry of data- categories, budgets, transactions, 
addresses, etc.- is incredibly easy to master and use without hassle on a 
daily basis.  Financial GeniuS uses the standard methods of entry on the GS 
(menus, line edits, lists, text edits, radios, check boxes, pop-up 
menus...) with a flexibility that few can ignore.  All in all, Financial 
GeniuS is the perfect program for a person or family who is financially 
conscious (or attempting to become that way).

     The only way to get the full perspective on this financial program is 
to dowload the demo from your local BBS.  If that is not possible, the demo 
is available from the author for $5.  Send a check or money order to:

        Rick Adams
        FGS Demo
        1627 Ball St.
        Galveston, TX 77550.

     The demo includes a tutorial that will help you to understand the 
basics of the program.  A separate demo account has been included to 
illustrate basic use of the program as well as to let you in on some 
advanced features available to you while using the program.

     NOTE:  Financial GeniuS is being distributed as shareware.  The demo 
version does not allow changes to be saved to an account.  In order to 
receive the fully enabled version as well as written documentation, the 
shareware fee of $35 must be paid to the author.

Update Notice   The wait is over!  The new version of Financial GeniuS is
'''''''''''''   ready to ship. I listened to all of your suggestions and 
fit in a few of my own as well. You will be amazed by the improvements!  
Version 2.0 is a total rewrite. No more waiting for disk access; version 
2.0 now loads everything when you open your account.  Because Financial 
GeniuS is now memory-based, you are allowed access to all portions of the 
program at any time.  If you discover you need to enter a category to your 
account while you are entering transactions, you can open up the category/ 
budget section, enter your new category, and BOOM, it appears in the 
transaction window for immediate use.  Improved handling of all aspects of 
your account has been added.  You may now edit, remove, and add auto 
transactions and payee addresses.  Use of auto transactions has been 
dramatically enhanced to allow entry of any transactions you want in any 
order you specify.  System 6 controls allow ease of movement through 
windows to make entry of data much more fluid and controlled.  Filtering of 
transactions has been dramatically improved; find the transactions you need 
in no time at all. In addition to the increased functionality of FGS, the 
data structure has been expanded to allow larger accounts while maintaining 
its goal of using only necessary memory.  The new account limits include: 
200 categories, 150 auto transactions, 200 payee addresses, up to 50 
transactions in the clipboard, and transactions still only limited by 
memory! This update is a must!

     New Features :

$       Memory based to make it faster and more accurate; well tested to 
        prevent bugs.

$       Separation of program segments to make all sections of the program 
        available at all times (i.e. concurrent category, transaction, auto 
        transaction, and payee address abilities).

$       Re-developed menus and windows to be more accessible and 
        comfortable.

$       Updated for complete System 6 compatibility.

$       Finder*-like Windows menu to rapidly find or close a specific 
        window.

$       Customize the program by saving window positions.

$       Cut, Copy, and Paste transactions via a clipboard.

$       Expanded support of split transactions.

$       Memos in transactions.

$       Expanded support of variable budgets.

$       Better report generation: faster, more intuitive, and easier to 
        read. (Saves to disk in Teach or ASCII).

$       Print checks using the GS Print Manager.

$       Auto load and auto backup features.

$       Compatible with The Manager, SwitchIt!, and other program 
        switchers.

$       Was 16k, now uses only 9k of stack space!

$       Convert program makes v 1.0 files compatible with version 2.0 while 
        checking for errors in account files.

$       130 pages of written documentation.

$       Import accounts from other programs.

$       Smaller account files.

$       Lots more!

     NOTE: The upgrade price for Financial GeniuS v 1.x to 2.0 is $15.  
Send check or money order AND _registration number_ to:

        FGS Update
        1627 Ball St.

Demo Account Not Yet Available   Due to circumstances beyond my control, 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   the demo account mentioned in the 
Financial GeniuS announcement is _not_ included in the uploaded demo. That 
demo account will be uploaded separately as soon as it is completed. Since 
the beginning of the year is now here (Happy New Year!), I thought it best 
to let the 'public' try before they buy NOW.

     A tutorial is included with the demo that will give you the basic 
feel for the program and will let you know whether you want it or not.  The 
demo account will show a lot more abilities of Financial GeniuS and show 
you more possibilities for maintaining your finances.  If you're in no 
rush, wait for the demo account to be released.  I will re-upload a 
'complete' package when that time comes.

     Finally, if you desire to upload the FGS demo to another bulletin 
board system, PLEASE _wait_ for the package that contains the demo account. 
That way others will see a 'complete' Financial GeniuS!

Thanks,

KEYBOARDING 5 UPDATED   Keyboarding 5 (aka Computer Keyboarding) version 
"""""""""""""""""""""   5.1.2, dated 12-20-93, has been added to the 
library.

21861  KB5.HD.BXY -- this is the complete version for hard drives and 
                     for 3.5 inch diskettes.

21862  KB5.D1.BXY -- this contains the files for the 5.25 inch STARTUP
                     diskette. Add ProDOS and BASIC.SYSTEM to make it
                     bootable.

21863  KB5.D2.BXY -- this contains the files for the 5.25 inch PROGRAM
                     diskette.

     This version includes all previous bug fixes as well as numerous 
cosmetic changes designed to make the program more user-friendly.

     Keyboarding 5 is SHAREWARE. Until you pay the shareware fee, each 
time the program is booted you will be reminded to pay the fee. The program 
allows you to complete all of the 'home keys' lessons and begin with the 
first set of new keys (e u g). However, it will lock up at that point if 
the fee has not been paid. The key to unlocking the rest of the program is 
given to you when you pay the fee.

     The SHAREWARE fee is $10 if you download the program or obtain it 
from another source other than me. When you send the fee to me, specify an 
e-mail address or snail-mail address to get the password in return.

     If you wish to get the program directly from me, do the following:

     1. Send me $15.

     2. Include your name and address.

     3. Identify which size diskette you want - 3.5 inch or 5.25 inch.

     4. If you are purchasing this for someone else, give me that name too.

     5. Mail it all to
            Charles Hartley
            455 Foster Lane
            Shepherdsville, KY 40165

     I will send the program on bootable diskettes. I have a license with 
Apple to include ProDOS and BASIC.SYSTEM with the program.

     If you request the program on a 3.5 inch diskette, I will include 
some extra goodies since there is ample room on that diskette.

     Keyboarding 5 continues to be available as a site license for 
schools. The school site license fee is $100. Address all inquires to me at 
the address above.

     Thanks!

NEW HARD DRIVES   A2.Bill asked me to move the discussion of new hard disk 
"""""""""""""""   drive products over here as a more appropriate place.  
So, here we are in our new home.

     Later tonight, I'll post brief reports of both the Roadrunner40 and 
the AppleLeaf hard disk drives.  I'll also discuss the Diplomat.  

     The Roadrunner is primarily aimed at the Apple IIe because the 
package includes a late (read the latest) model CMS SCSI card.  This holds 
the price down a lot.  Also included are a card for power on which any  
available 2.5" Quantum GO Drive (SCSI) can be mounted.  The producer was 
able to obtain something just under 1,000 of these 40 meg drives, and 
designed the card for the power, SCSI ID and Terminator power.  Again ways 
to hold the price down.....  

     The Roadrunner has been tested in a IIe and a IIGS at Charlie's 
AppleSeeds and found to work correctly in both machines!  

     Retail price is a suggested $199.00

     Where else can one find, for an Apple IIe, a 40 meg drive AND SCSI 
card for that price?  AND, don't forget, its SCSI!

     Also available, a limited supply of Roadrunner20 units for a 
suggested retail price of $149.00.........

PROSEL LITE   New addition to the Roadrunner:  ProSel LITE
"""""""""""   ProSel LITE adds the ProSel 8 (PRO)gram (SEL)ector to the 
Roadrunner, so that you can have the best program selector available on the 
Apple II Series in 8 bit mode....  Essentially, what you get is the ability 
to create a program selector screen for your Roadrunner.  The EXTERNAL 
Program Selector Editor is part of the LITE package, as are all of the 
screen demo files which show you what can be done.  In addition, thre 
(there) are about 10 pages of dox, in AWP format for how to best use the 
Program Selector Screen and both the internal and external screen editors.

     ProSel 8, discussed elsewhere on GEnie, can be purchased for $28.00 
plus $2 postage, with proof of purchase of your Roadrunner.  That 
represents a $10 (25%) discount over the suggested retail price.

NEW COPILOT "OPEN BETA" SCRIPTS   The CoPilot scripts for Spectrum and TIC
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   are in the library, and have been since 
before daybreak.:)

     The library folks are aware that the CoPilot files need to be 
released as soon as possible, and they will be making every effort to get 
them out. If there is any delay on this, it WILL be unavoidable. (And my 
apologies to the library staff for putting them under pressure like this.)

     The ProTerm scripts are VERY near complete, and if nothing unexpected 
comes up in THAT arena, you should see them early next week.

>>>>>   I've been so busy trying to whip the new CoPilot ProTerm scripts
"""""   into shape that I've got 800K or unread messages in my A2 buffer!  
I'm not sure what Gary has posted about the ProTerm version of these 
scripts but I thought I'd take a second to give a status report.

     As far as I know, the scripts are done and bug free.  The last set of 
changes are in the hands of the Beta testers....  Since I may be going out 
of town for a couple days, I'm deciding whether to bite the bullit and 
upload them....  I'm inclined to upload them and see what happens :).  In 
any event, you should see them within a week..no matter what.

     These scripts are pretty much direct translations of Gary's TIC 
scripts. Because of this, I've used none of the power commands in the 
ProTerm macro set.  The bad side is that it makes it GOto laden spaghetti 
code.  The good side is that it is so like the TIC/SPECTRUM scripts, almost 
anyone can look at additions to the TIC scripts and easily impliment them 
in the ProTerm scripts.  Also, this first order usage of the ProTerm macro 
language should allow use with ProTerm 3.0 as well as 3.1.  I did about 
half the scripting using ProTerm 3.0 by accident.  But after switching to 
3.1 I didn't see any reason why 3.0 shouldn't be perfectly adequate.  If 
there are any problems with 3.0, please jump in and let me know.  I want to 
make sure they are 3.0 compatible (and I _think_ they are now).

     I'll leave it to Gary to explain the 'features' of the scripts.  You 
can yell at me for any ProTerm bugs though...:)  Watch for them.  It won't 
be long now....

     Ah, the good ol' days!

     Not to mention the "other guys", but if anyone also gets on 
CompuServe (hey, I use it to access my company mainframe - GEnie is where I 
have my fun :) - the 'Behind the Screens' column by John Edwards in the Jan 
94 magazine was interesting.

     He mentions a kind of yearning for 4k RAM, Kilobaud and OnComputing 
magazines, the take-over of the micro computer industry by "consultants", 
the disappearance of the original hackers (in the good sense).

     I still have my original 1979 Apple II in my 4-year old daughter's 
room.  She still gets a great kick out of making it tick.  I get a much 
greater kick watching her have fun with it.

     Circa 1976, had taken BASIC and FORTRAN courses at the Univ of 
Minnesota totally by consequence (another whole story) and fell in love 
with the things.  A year before my high school physics teacher was busy 
building a computer from a kit (Altair I believe) and got me interested in 
the kit building side.  So HeathKit was a way of life for some time as 
well.

     Drooled over the ads in Byte magazine about the 4K RAM machines that 
you put together on the "kit a month" plan.  Then the ads for the Apple I, 
you could get just the motherboard and add your own case, power supply and 
keyboard - or - buy the works in a case already!

     Even in those days, Apple was high priced compared to other 
computers.  I recall the month-long debate over spending my $2000 on 16K 
Apple II with an AppleSoft language card, or get the Ohio Scientific 
computer with 32K of memory, disk drive, monitor for the same price.  The 
decision on the Apple was almost a coin toss type of affair.  What sinched 
the deal was I couldn't find software for the O.S. machine outside of the 
Montgomery Wards store.  Yes, Wards!  They sold them right next to the 
tires and batteries.  :)

     I loved what the Lisa and Mac computers could do and had a part in 
bringing a Lisa into our office.  This eventually became a love/hate affair 
as the arrogance of the Mac owners/users and the shenannigans within Apple 
Inc. regarding the II vs Mac became more profound.  So, when my dad saw 
this neat new IIGS computer coming on the market, he asked if I'd be 
interested in one.  How can you say "no" to your dad. ;)  I'd guess that 
this Woz signature machine will last at least as long as the II in my

     Sometimes we Apple II users have our rewards.

     I had a project at the office which would work the best using a 
database.  Our office is awash in messy-dos machines.  The guru in charge 
of software feels that if it is bigger (read more expensive), the software 
must be better so in his infinite wisdom, bought rBASE as our data base 
software.  In an attempt to give it a fair shot, I have been trying to 
learn rBASE for a year and  like the other folks in the department, have 
muddled along and still can't set up a data base.  (If the manual is over 1 
1/2 inches thick, don't buy it).  Having a deadline to meet, I said to hell 
with messy-dos and planned on using Appleworks database to get the project 
done.  As luck would have it, the nor'easter of 94 (thats what the news 
media called it) gave me the chance to get Appleworks up and running at 
home.  My boss told me to take work home Monday night and work at home 
instead of driving 35 miles to the office on Tuesday.  Not one to argue 
with the boss, I did just that.  As the snow fell and the wind blew, I 
typed away on the IIGS and got the project done.

     Wednesday morning, I brought my Deskjet 500 printed custom output 
into the office and showed the boss what could be done with a "SIMPLE" 
database program on a obsolete computer.  As he was working with my output, 
I went into my office and started doing some SuperCalc work on my messy-dos 
machine when the computer hung on me.  It wouldn't even recognize a 
ctrl-alt-delete boot.  I turned off the machine and rebooted to find only a 
blank screen, no cursor and the sound of the harddrive spinning.  When the 
service tech looked at my dead machine, he found that the motherboard was 
fried and had to be replaced.

     Could it be that my DOS machine saw the Apple output and threw in the 
towel?

               """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The other day I got to thinking about the two types of 
telecommunications skills a person can possess.  The first type is 
technical skills:  how to use the features in your communications software, 
how to read and leave messages on local bulletin boards and national 
information services, how to diagnose the problem when your modem has 
difficulty connecting with a remote system.

     The other type of telecommunications skill is far more subtle and 
amorphous.  It's the skill a person has at knowing what to say, how to say 
it, where to say it, and whom to say it to.  It's the "savoir faire" skill 
of knowing accepted online social practices, and of playing the game 
according to the unwritten rules.

     It's this second type of telecommunications skill I find most 
fascinating.

     You can tell when a person has developed a facility at this skill.  
Their public message postings sound concise, well-thought out, sensitive to 
others' feelings, and inviting reply.  Their private electronic mail 
messages have similar attributes.

     You can also tell when a person's online social skills are not fully 
developed.  The person who sprinkles exclamation marks hither and thither 
in their writing may be unaware that their puppy-dog exuberance betrays a 
certain naivete.  Likewise the poor soul who has yet to learn that the 
English language has evolved to where lower case lettering is indeed 
permissible.

     Knowing what to say online is only half the battle though.  Knowing 
how to say it is the real challenge.

     It takes skill to choose just the right words to elicit the desired 
response.  Another way of saying this is that online communications gives 
you ample opportunities to put your foot in your mouth.

     You need not feel overly self-conscious if you do commit the 
occasional social gaffe, though.  Online communications is so new to all of 
us that everyone can recall social gaffe's of their own.

     Just last week I myself had a narrow escape.  In a moment of reckless 
abandon I courtesy-copied an electronic mail message.  My reason for doing 
so was to save myself the trouble of sending a separate e-mail message to 
the courtesy-copied party.

     Doesn't sound too dangerous on the face of it, does it?  Aha, but 
foot-in-mouth opportunities abound in the online world.  No sooner had I 
dispatched the message than I realized the possible perils of my action. 
Some stray comments in my message could possibly be taken the wrong way by 
the courtesy-copied party.

     Luckily, I narrowly escaped a rather embarrassing situation.  Next 
time I'll think twice about using the convenience of courtesy-copying.  I'm 
all the wiser for having narrowly missed that precipice.

     The truth is that online social skills are closely akin to the social 
skills we use in conducting our everyday face-to-face affairs.  Those who 
have developed refined social skills in the tangible world usually have no 
trouble transferring those skills to the online world.

     Tact.  Courtesy.  Thoughtfulness.  A reserved, controlled demeanor. 
These are all indicia of a refined mind -- both online and off line.

     These are commendable skills to hone and refine.  You cannot learn 
them quickly.  You cannot learn them from any guidebook.  You can only 
learn them through experience.

     As you journey through the online world, take time to reflect upon 
the positive examples of online social skills you encounter.  You will 
enrich yourself immeasurably as a result.

INTRODUCTION   We finally reach the end of our tour of the Apple IIgs
""""""""""""   Classic Desk Accessory Control Panel, with a discussion of 
the Printer Port and Modem Port options.  If you are one of the many who, 
like me, have recently updated to a newer, faster modem, this may be 
helpful.


PRINTER PORT / MODEM PORT   These two options in the Control Panel are
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   quite similar, so I will deal with them 
together.  Modifying the characteristics of a serial port on the Apple II, 
II Plus, or IIe required popping the top off the computer and flipping some 
tiny little DIP switches.  To do this on the IIgs is much easier; you just 
enter our handy little CDA Control Panel and use the arrow keys to change 
things.

     Before describing the various entries in these Control Panels, let's 
diverge for a moment and discuss parallel versus serial devices, and then 
explain what a serial device needs to properly communicate.  The parallel 
interface was designed originally by a company named Centronics, which 
manufactured printers, way back before microcomputers existed.  They 
designed an inexpensive way of sending data from a computer to a printer 
that involved having a separate wire for each of the eight bits in a byte. 
Besides these eight wires, there was also a wire from the computer to the 
printer to tell it that a character was coming, and another wire from the 
printer back to the computer to tell it that the character had been 
printed, and it was ready for more.  The only problem with the parallel 
interface is that it is expensive to have a cable that runs over a long 
distance (if your printer and computer can't be right next to each other). 
Because of these drawbacks, the serial interface is often used as an 
alternative.

     Serial interfaces have been around for a LONG time, so long that a 
specific standard has been defined to designate exactly how a serial 
interface should work.  This is called the RS-232-C standard, and that's 
why you see that name on some serial devices (when they claim to be 
compatible with that standard).  The simplest serial interface would be one 
line for data and another for a ground, but several others were added over 
the years, until there were as many as 25 different lines with different 
meanings.  In the microcomputer world, where practicalities such as price 
have reigned supreme, this has been reduced significantly.  The Apple IIc, 
the first Apple II to use the serial interface as a standard, used only 
five of the lines coming out of the computer, although the plug at the 
other end had to have 25 pins to follow the RS-232-C standard.  The IIgs 
and Macintosh computers use eight lines for data transmission to achieve 
slightly better control.  This uses one data line in each direction, plus 
other lines for control (letting one device tell another when it is ready 
for more).

     Now that we have that out of the way, here is what these Panels look 
like:

              Select <- -> V ^  Cancel: Esc  Save <-|

     (Note that as in previous month's articles, the "~" character 
represents the checkmark that appears next to each line in Control Panel 
setting that is the default selection for that feature.)  All these 
parameters are necessary to help your computer communicate properly with 
alien species (i.e., printers and modems).  Now, we'll take each of these 
in turn to explain what they mean.

Device Connected   On the ROM 01 IIgs, this is an option that can be
''''''''''''''''   adjusted by pressing the right or left arrow keys to 
select "Printer" or "Modem".  On the ROM 03 IIgs, the Printer and Modem 
Control Panels are smart enough to tell you what setting you have made in 
the Slots Control Panel.  If you have Slot 1 set for "Printer", it tells 
you that; if for "Modem" (yes, you could have two modems attached), it 
tells you that.  If for "Your Card" it will say that also, and if 
"AppleTalk" (on the ROM 03), that name is displayed.  If AppleTalk is 
selected for either of these two slots, many of the other options are NOT 
displayed; apparently only the first four are needed to properly control an 
AppleTalk interface.

Line Length   This option refers to the number of characters that will be
'''''''''''   sent to a port before a carriage return (Ctrl-M) character is 
automatically generated by the computer and sent down the serial data line. 
This may be necessary when using some very old printers that REQUIRE this 
type of control, or if the page that you are trying to print seems to 
continually print characters off the right edge of the paper.  In most 
modern applications, however, the software takes care of where the line 
should end and continue on the next, so most users should just set this to 
"Unlimited".  A modem also MUST have this option set to "Unlimited".

Delete first LF after CR   Here, LF = Linefeed (Ctrl-J), and CR = Carriage
''''''''''''''''''''''''   Return (Ctrl-M).  When these terms were 
originally defined back in the teletype and typewriter days, a Carriage 
Return meant that the movable print head was moved back to the left end of 
the line.  However, without a Linefeed to move the paper up one line, any 
printing that continued from this point would go right over that printing 
that had already appeared on the line.  So, when information was sent to a 
teletype it was necessary to send both a Ctrl-J and a Ctrl-M to make sure 
that the next line of printing WAS printed on the next line.

     From the beginning, the original Apple II would move the cursor to the 
next line on the screen with ONLY the Ctrl-M character.  It became 
customary for printers attached to Apple II's, and later to the Macintosh 
series, to also require ONLY the Ctrl-M character, rather than the 
Ctrl-M/Ctrl-J (CR/LF) byte pair.  This made sense in terms of saving a bit 
of time during printing, and space in a text file; each line in the file 
would require one byte less of storage if it only used the Ctrl-M 
character.

     In the CP/M world, and later in the MS-DOS world of the IBM PC, the 
custom of using BOTH the CR and the LF bytes persisted, and so some 
printers expect to receive BOTH a CR and LF to work properly.  Other 
printers (such as the Apple ImageWriter) only require a CR to work properly 
(in its default setting).

     Since the settings on printers differ, this can be used to change how 
the serial port talks to the printer.  If all the lines in your word 
processing document print out double spaced, setting this option to "Yes" 
will allow the serial port firmware to "eat" the extra LF character.

Add LF after CR   Similar to the above discussion, an application that
'''''''''''''''   does NOT send a LF after a CR may cause some printers to 
print every line in a document on top of each other.  If that happens with 
your setup, setting this option to "Yes" will cause the serial port 
firmware to burp out an extra LF character every time a CR character is 
sent.

Echo   When using a modem, two modes of data transmission are used.
''''   "Full-duplex" means that a character sent to the computer on the 
other end is sent back ("echoed") to the computer on your end. 
"Half-duplex" (which GEnie and nearly no one else uses) means that the 
characters sent from your end are NOT sent back to your computer. 
Therefore, to see what you are typing, your terminal program must be set to 
half-duplex, or you must set this Control Panel option to "Yes". If you see 
ttwwoo of everything you type, the remote computer is sending each 
character you type back to you, and you need to set Echo to "No".

Buffering   This option, if activated, uses a space in RAM where data being
'''''''''   sent to the printer or modem can be temporarily stored up when 
the device is busy and can't handle any more data for a moment.  For a 
modem, if you find that you are losing some data at times, turning this 
option on may help.  Apple's manuals suggest leaving this turned off unless 
a particular program or device requires that it be on.

     One "gotcha" that once hit me was turning Buffering "On" in the 
Printer Port.  It began to cause problems when I tried to print several 
documents from AppleWorks; as each new document began to print, it appeared 
to clear out the remainder of the previous document.  After tearing out a 
few hairs ("But this USED to work!!!"), I finally recalled that I had made 
that change, and returning it to normal fixed everything.  Moral: Don't 
turn Buffering "On" unless you have specific instructions to do it.

     You will probably find that if you use a high speed modem (9600 baud 
or faster) this option will need to be turned "On".

Baud   The approximate speed (in characters per second) that the serial
''''   port will send data to the device attached to it.  When the IIgs was 
designed, the most common speed for printers was 9600, and for modems was 
1200.  The baud rate for printers should be set to the fastest speed that 
the printer can handle (make sure the settings on the printer match what 
you set here).  For many modems, this setting may NEED to be set to the 
speed at which you want to use the modem; however, with newer modems, it 
may be possible to have the Baud setting in the Control Panel set to the 
highest speed (19200) EVEN if the modem cannot communicate faster than 2400 
baud.  This Control Panel setting will determine how fast the computer 
communicates with the modem; the modem will communicate over the phone line 
at whatever speed IT has been set to.

     In general, put this option to the highest setting that allows you to 
make a reliable connection.

Data/Stop Bits   To allow eight bits of data to be sent on a SINGLE
''''''''''''''   electrical line between two devices, there has to be a way 
to tell when one byte ends and the next one begins.  Consider this series 
of characters: "GODISNOWHERE".  Does it mean "GOD IS NOWHERE" or "GOD IS 
NOW HERE"?  Without the space character it could be difficult to determine 
the correct meaning of the words.  In the transmission of a series of bits, 
it is absolutely critical that there be a way to tell where the "space" 
should go.

     "Data Bits" refers to whether a byte is sent as five, six, seven, or 
eight bits.  Although five or six bits may not send many characters based 
on the ASCII character set, some older standards require such a setting.  
However, I know of no standard BBS or major online information service that 
uses such a limited protocol.

     "Stop Bits" refers to how a byte is terminated; by the above example, 
it identifies how a "space" between bytes is identified.  This is either 
one or two bits.

     In nearly all circumstances these days, it will be unnecessary to 
change this setting from 8/1 to anything else.

Parity   This option has to do with an older method of error checking.
''''''   After each character is transmitted, a parity bit may be required 
to allow the computer on the receiving end to determine whether or not the 
character was sent accurately.  If not, that one character would be 
re-transmitted.

     Parity is set to either "Odd", "Even", or "None".  An "Odd" parity 
requires that an extra bit, either 0 or 1, is added to the end of the 5, 6, 
7, or 8 bit character to make sure that it has an odd number of 1 digits.  
"Even" parity means that the extra bit should make the entire transmitted 
character have an even number of 1 digits.  "None" means that the parity 
protocol is not used, and in most cases this will be the best choice.

DCD, DSR/DTR, XON/XOFF Handshake   These three Handshake options are used
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   to help the device attached to a serial 
port to be able to tell the computer to stop sending data to it.  A 
printer, for instance, is not able to print data as quickly as the computer 
can send it.  If the printer could not tell the computer "Stop, I'm full 
right now!," data would be lost as the computer continued to dump data to 
it.

     DCD stands for "Data Carrier Detect"; DSR for "Data Set Ready"; DTR 
for "Data Terminal Ready"; and XON/XOFF are the names for ASCII characters 
that tell the transmitting device to start and stop sending, respectively.


THE END OF THE CLASSICS   Finally, we are at the end of this description of
"""""""""""""""""""""""   the CDA Control Panel.  Hopefully, it has made it 
easier for you to make adjustments to your Apple IIgs, and to understand 
what those adjustments are for.  Next time, join me here as we begin to 
look into the use of increasingly affordable hard disks on Apple II 
computers.

             >>> HOW THE APPLE II READS AND WRITES MS-DOS <<<
             """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The Macintosh world has been buzzing recently about an 
Apple-manufactured 68040 Processor Direct Slot card that actually allows a 
Macintosh to run MS-DOS programs.  Running inside a Mac Quadra 610, this 
486 co-processor does has features that take it beyond the PC Transporter; 
however, I can't help but be amused by the attitude of the Mac-o-philes at 
my work place.  One in particular has been crowing about what an "amazing 
technological breakthrough" the card represents and how "nothing like it 
has ever been done before."  One of these days I'll bring him to my home 
and quietly demonstrate how my PC Transporter-equipped IIgs can launch and 
run the latest versions of Microsoft Works, ProCOMM Plus, and Word Perfect 
from GS/OS desktop icons.

     The PC Transporter is, for all practical purposes, a small, 
high-speed XT that is contained upon a single card.  When it was 
introduced, XTs were considered "aging technology" in the PC world, when 
compared to the accepted 286 standard, and the just-emerging, ultra-fast, 
386 systems.  Nonetheless, the ability to cram an entire XT on a single 
card was considered an engineering accomplishment, and the card must be 
viewed, historically, as state-of-the-art technology in consideration of 
what it could do.

     Even today, the PCT is no slouch.  People who have just enough 
knowledge about computers to think that they "know" you can't run IBM 
software on an Apple II, are usually amazed when they see a machine that 
will do exactly that.  The PCT uses a V30 microprocessor -- essentially the 
equivalent of an Intel 8086, only smaller.  The V30's speed is 7.14 mhz, 
but subjectively it runs much faster than that.  I can compare the card's 
performance (using non-Windows, MS-DOS applications) with an old XT and 
with an HP Vectra 386/16 at my work place.  Running inside my GS, most of 
the PCT's functions seem much closer in speed to the HP Vectra than the XT.

     I haven't tried to verify Applied Engineering's claim that MS-DOS 
programs run 3 times faster on the PCT than on a PC/XT.  Many factors 
govern speed and the perception of speed on personal computers, and with 
Applied's claim, you could easily imagine the PCT running like a 22 Mhz 
386.  Don't.  It probably isn't THAT fast.  Think along the lines of a fast 
286 running a text-based program.  Yes, Windows WILL run on the PCT, but 
there's no advantage in doing that.  A GS user already has a (better) 
windowing environment with GS/OS system 6.0.1, and according to those who 
have tried it, Windows will slow down the PCT to a snail's pace.  The PCT 
is strictly a DOS engine, and what it does, it does with speed and panache.

     According to Applied Engineering, the PCT gets its speed from the 
fact that it is a "co-processor."  In either an Apple IIe or IIgs, the 
Apple's own microprocessor and ProDOS system software handle the I/O from 
the V30 while emulating PC I/O ports.  This enables the PCT's V30 to 
process MS-DOS programs "at full speed" while accessing its own on-board 
RAM.(1)  Therefore, the PCT can be said to be running INSIDE an Apple, both 
figuratively and literally, given that most of the I/O is overseen by 
ProDOS.

     There are, however, two important exceptions to the rule that you 
need ProDOS for I/O management:  First, the PCT has its own Color Graphics 
Adapter (CGA) controller for generating video.  In a IIgs, a "ColorSwitch" 
is required to automatically switch between the GS's RGB analog color 
output and the PCT's digital output.  The second exception to ProDOS I/O 
management is found in the PCT's on-board, MFM floppy disk controller.  If 
it were not for the MFM controller, there would be no way to get program 
instructions from a STANDARD MS-DOS diskette into your Apple II/PC hybrid.  
It is helpful to think of this controller as your principal doorway to the 
MS-DOS world beyond the PC Transporter and Apple II hybrid system.

     Considered by itself, the PC Transporter card is capable of working 
with three types of MS-DOS volumes.  These volume types are MFM, GCR and 
hard disk.  The PCT can read and write directly to MFM/MS-DOS volumes ONLY 
through its on-board MFM floppy disk controller.  The controller, in turn 
must be connected to either PC Transporter "Transdrives" or to a standard 
Apple 3.5 microfloppy drive to be able to read and write MFM/MS-DOS 
diskettes.  The PCT reads and writes to hard disk and GCR/MS-DOS volumes 
through the Apple's microprocessor and ProDOS.

ABOUT "LOW-LEVEL" FORMAT   "GCR" and "MFM" are sometimes called "low-level"
""""""""""""""""""""""""   formats or "disk formats." This is done to 
distinguish them from "file formats," such as MS-DOS, ProDOS and HFS.  
"MFM" is principally used by PCs and PC compatibles, while "GCR" is 
principally used by Apple IIs.  Another way to think about GCR and MFM is 
that they are HARDWARE-RELATIVE terms that have to do with the schemes used 
by the drives themselves, and their interface cards or controllers, for 
encoding data on diskettes.  MFM stands for "modified frequency 
modulation."  GCR stands for "group code recording." On the other hand, the 
FILE formats MS-DOS, ProDOS and HFS, should be thought of as 
"SOFTWARE-RELATIVE" terms for our present purposes.(2)

     As file formats, MS-DOS, ProDOS and HFS can be independent of MFM and 
GCR.  Thus, it is possible to have MFM-encoded ProDOS diskettes, and it is 
also possible to have GCR-encoded MS-DOS diskettes.  The 1.4MB and 720K 
ProDOS disks created by Floptical disk drives are MFM-encoded ProDOS.  The 
720K and 360K ProDOS disks created by the PCT's Transdrives are also 
MFM-encoded.  However, convention pairs MS-DOS with MFM in the PC world and 
ProDOS with GCR in the Apple II world.  (It should be noted that HFS is 
often written to both MFM and GCR; Superdrive-equipped Macs routinely work 
with both formats.)

     It appears to some Apple watchers that the company will soon leave 
the GCR standard behind (along with the Apple II) to make their drives and 
data disks more cross-platform compatible with the PC world and to save 
money.  This would seem to be a logical step as Apple moves toward 
promotion of the PowerPC and, therefore, a single hardware standard with 
the PC world.  It is all the more reason for Apple II devotees wishing to 
remain with dynamite power applications like ProTERM 3.1 and AppleWorks 4.1 
to develop bridges to enable them to move their data with greater ease 
between their Apple and other platforms when needed.

     It is important for cross-platform and hybrid users to keep in mind 
which kind of diskette (GCR or MFM) that they are working with, because 
each kind of diskette requires a certain kind of disk drive and/or 
interface in order for it to be written or read.  For example, a user 
cannot write a 720K MFM/ProDOS diskette in a Floptical disk drive or PCT 
Transdrive, then take it to a standard GCR 800K Apple drive and read it.  
Similarly, anyone who takes advantage of the PCT card's ability to write 
MS-DOS to a diskette through a standard GCR Apple drive and controller, 
should not expect to be able to read one of these diskettes in a standard 
PC or compatible drive.

     The Apple 3.5 and Applied's Platinum 3.5 are, however, capable of 
reading and writing both 720K MFM/MS-DOS AND 800K GCR/ProDOS when hooked to 
the PCT card.  On the ProDOS side of an Apple II/PC hybrid, a special 
Applied Engineering software program called "PCT.SWAP" can turn these 
drives on and off as ProDOS drives.  This capability has caused some 
AppleII fans to opt for the PC Transporter card in place of Apple's 
Superdrive bundle.  

     As many know, the Superdrive and its controller card give Apple II 
users the capability to rewrite high density HFS, MS-DOS, and ProDOS in MFM 
and GCR.  By comparison, however, the PCT's advantage is that it gives the 
user the ability to not only rewrite MFM/MS-DOS and GCR/ProDOS, but also to 
RUN MS-DOS.  Additionally, IIe users who do not possess 800K 3.5 capability 
get the added benefit of a 3.5 floppy disk controller (usable on both 
ProDOS and MS-DOS sides of their machine) with their PCT card.  

     Unfortunately, the Superdrive cannot be hooked to the PCT's MFM 
controller and cannot be accessed by the PCT as an MFM/MS-DOS device.  The 
Superdrive's double and high density diskettes CAN, however, be accessed by 
the PCT through the Apple II's ProDOS emulation of PC I/O (in the same way 
that standard Apple 3.5 drives can be accessed by the PCT through the Apple 
ports).  Additionally, with Peter Watson's (GS/OS) MS-DOS utilities and 
System 6.0.1's MS-DOS FST, it is possible to format and rewrite MFM/MS-DOS 
in both double density and high density from the IIgs side of a GS/PC 
hybrid, or from ANY GS for that matter, hybrid or not.

     For those who already have 3.5 capability (hopefully most of us by 
now), one drawback to consider in comparing the PCT and Apple's Superdrive 
bundle is that the PCT's controller will not handle high density (1.4MB) 
diskettes.  This is often the essential consideration for those who 
purchase the Superdrive.  Also, while the PCT and Apple 3.5 combination 
will read and write MFM/MS-DOS, PC-compatible drives on other machines are 
finicky about reading and writing MFM/MS-DOS diskettes which have been 
FORMATTED in the Apple 3.5 drive.  Most Apple II hybrid users who rely on 
the PCT and Apple 3.5 drive combination purchase preformatted IBM 
diskettes.  Others may wish to consider using the PCT Transdrive system, 
which not only flawlessly formats MFM/MS-DOS, but is also able to display 
MFM/MS-DOS diskette volumes on the GS/OS desktop with the MS-DOS FST.

     Though neither the PCT Transdrive system nor the PCT and Apple 3.5 
combination are capable of reading or writing high density diskettes, there 
is one MFM-capable device, other than the Superdrive, that CAN read and 
write 1.4MB high density.  The Floptical disk drive has been receiving much 
attention lately among Apple II hybrid and cross-platform users because of 
its ability to handle MFM encoding AND its ability to rewrite high density.  
This gives it many advantages, especially for Apple IIgs devotees who want 
to work with both the MS-DOS and HFS file system translators.  It seems 
important, therefore, to briefly consider use of the Floptical in this 
series on Apple II hybrid computers.

ABOUT FLOPTICAL DRIVES   Tulin, PLI and IOMEGA sell the majority of
""""""""""""""""""""""   Floptical drives to AppleII owners.  Unlike 
Superdrives, Floptical drives are limited to only MFM encoding.  However, 
besides being able to rewrite high density diskettes, they also can read 
and write VERY high density (21MB) Floptical diskettes.  These Floptical 
diskettes are 3.5 floppy diskettes which have been "etched" or "stamped" on 
one side with a series of small pits, laid down in concentric rings.

     If you turn a Floptical diskette over, open the shutter and hold the 
diskette at an angle to an incandescent bulb you get refraction, a rainbow 
effect across the diskette's surface appearing much the same as when you 
hold an old LP record at an angle to light.  A light emitting diode inside 
the Floptical drive's case shines on this surface, and an optical servo 
mechanism reads the pits to position its magnetic read/write heads.  
Therefore, positioning is done optically, but, unlike an optical disk, 
which encodes data optically in small reflective pits, data are encoded 
MAGNETICALLY on Floptical diskettes.  The Floptical drive achieves its very 
high data densities because of the precision which can be derived from 
optical positioning.  

     Like the Apple Superdrive, the Floptical drive cannot be accessed 
directly as an MFM/MS-DOS device by a PCT card because it cannot be 
attached to the PCT's MFM/MS-DOS controller.  The diskettes can, however, 
be accessed as special hard disk volumes by the PCT.

     Floptical drives are SCSI devices, and therefore they must be hooked 
to an SCSI controller card.  Once they are properly configured on the SCSI 
bus, a floptical diskette, placed in one of these drives, can function like 
any other hard drive volume, with one important difference.  Floptical 
diskettes are removable.  Being removable, they can be used as backup 
devices or substitute volumes containing alternative programs and data.  
Therefore, they can also provide multiple hard disk volumes to both the 
Apple II and PC sides of the hybrid.  Used as PCT hard drive volumes, these 
diskettes offer tremendous flexibility to Apple II hybrid users.

     Next month, we'll talk more about PCT hard drive volumes and about 
use of the PCT control panel and hardware drivers.  We'll also talk more 
about the kind of software that runs on the PC side of the Apple II/PC 
hybrid and what benefits the user can expect.  Until next month then, think 
hybrid!

     (2) Before we make this definition too rigid, however, we should

            systems.  They are also disk operating systems.  As such, they 
            have code built into them which enables them to work with

Golden Oldies
"""""""""""""
by Darrel Raines
      [D.RAINES]



     One of the potentially frustrating things about owning an older 
computer system is that you feel left out when you see your friends going 
to the nearest computer store and buying that great new game for their 
system.  They plop down $50 for a new dungeon game that will blow the socks 
off anything that was ever created before.  The package consists of music 
and graphics that will make you think that you are actually in the room 
with the dragon that just toasted your exploration crew.

     All this sounds great to the average Apple IIgs owner (except the 
high purchase price).  The trouble is that there are no longer new games 
coming out for the Apple.  You begin to feel left out and start to consider 
purchasing a new computer just so you can play the latest and greatest 
computer games.  Well, hold onto your mouse for just a minute.  I have an 
alternative that I think you should consider:  used software.

     Unless you were a lot wealthier than the average Apple II owner, you 
did not have the resources to purchase every game that was written for the 
Apple II over the years.  I certainly tried, but even I could not 
accomplish this feat.  Therefore, many games and other useful software were 
written for your computer, but escaped your clutches for some reason or 
other.  Now is your opportunity.

     Run, don't walk, to the nearest Apple IIgs and boot up the 
telecommunications software.  Log onto GEnie and hop over to the Apple II 
RoundTable (A2).  Enter the bulletin board area (option 1) and set your 
category for number 4 (SET 4).  You are ready to enter the magic kingdom.  
In just a few weeks, you'll have hundreds of opportunities to purchase used 
software that needs a new, loving home.  All that you have to do is browse 
(BRO) the different topics to find the software that you managed to miss in 
the past few years.  There are even a number of hardware items that may 
tickle your fancy.

     Once you see a title that sounds good, drop a note to the person who 
left the original "For Sale" message.  If the price sounds too steep, then 
make a counter-offer.  If the price sounds fair, then shout quickly "I will 
take that item off your hands."  If you are the first one to make an offer 
that the owner accepts, then you will be the proud owner of a new toy.  The 
seller will generally send the package to you and expect prompt payment in 
return.  You will get the original software, documentation, and many hours 
of entertainment.

     I should interject a word of caution at this point.  I have never had 
a problem in receiving merchandise or payment while using this process.  
However, the possibility does exist that you could get ripped off during an 
exchange.  I have never experienced a problem other than slow payment.  I 
have also been guilty of taking some time in shipping equipment to a 
purchaser.  I am working on this; it only works against me in the long run.  
Be sure to work out who pays for shipment and what order the payments are 
exchanged with the person you are buying from.  Take nothing for granted; 
spell out every detail.

     I have been able to find many good deals by purchasing my software in 
this manner.  I have also sold some items that would otherwise be gathering 
dust on my shelves.  Not only that, but by selling my used software, I have 
more money to purchase someone else's used game for my computer.  What a 
deal!

     I have finished many computer games, especially adventure games, 
where the software and documentation look exactly like they did when I 
purchased the game.  The only difference is that I have completed playing 
the game and killing the ultimate bad guy.  Now I do not know what to do 
with the game.  I will not be playing again anytime soon, since I spent 
long hours on the game before finishing it.  Why not sell the software on 
the Apple II RoundTable?

     You can place an ad for a software package almost as easily as you 
can find someone else's software to purchase.  All you have to do is 
compose a brief ad for the forum message and type it under the correct 
topic in category #4.  There are topics for 8-bit software, 16-bit 
software, IIgs computer systems, peripherals, and so on.  Find the correct 
category and type away.  Even if you happen to pick the wrong topic, the 
forum sysop will move the message for you and leave a friendly note telling 
you where to look for replies.

     I have managed to find several packages just recently that I have 
been wanting to purchase for years.  I never got around to ordering this 
software... or I didn't have the money... or something always came up.  By 
buying used software, I have been able to get a few games that I always 
wanted, a page layout package that looked useful, and a database program 
that my wife needed for her Biology Test Question Bank.  These packages 
were purchased for a reasonable price and included full documentation and 
the original disks.

     Now that you know the "Used Software Solution", why don't you clean 
out the computer closet?  Place ads for all your unwanted software.  Make 
inquiries about software you see in the Apple II RoundTable.  Sell software 
and equipment.  Buy a new game.  Trade adventure games with someone one the 
far side of the continent.  It might even provide you with as much 
excitement as your friend who just purchased that $50 game for his IBM 
clone.  Maybe more.

     Since we have opened this Pandora's box used software, a natural 
question follows:  "Which software should I try to find?"  You can ask your 
friends what games they have enjoyed playing.  You can seek opinions in the 
other categories on the RoundTable.  Of course, the reason that I brought 
up the subject is that I have an even better idea.  You can read GEnieLamp 
A2 edition.

     You see, next month, and from time to time in the future, I will be 
reviewing some golden oldie software packages that you can purchase on the 
used software market.  This will help you find that gem that you may have 
missed when it first came out.  Until next time, happy bargain hunting.

Known Bug in Apple SSC Card
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Ron Higgins
   [rhiggins@carroll1.cc.edu]



     In the "Hey Mister Postman" column of November 1993 issue of 
GEnieLamp A2, B.PERCIVAL and H.HOOD were discussing a problem with the 6551 
chip in Apple's Super Serial card, frequently used as a printer or modem 
interface.  The 6551 chip, which the SSC uses, can lose characters when 
sending.  Typically, this can interfere with PTSE screens and with ZMODEM 
file transfers.

     Every time the CTS line from your modem goes low to tell the computer 
to stop transmitting data, the current character is lost.  What happens is 
that the 6551, (ACIA -- Asynchronous Communications Interface Adaptor) chip 
stops transmitting immediately when the CTS line is lowered, no matter 
where in the current character it is.

     A character is made up of 8 bits (ones and zeros that computers can 
understand).  These bits are sent to your modem one at a time.  If the 
modem is getting the bits too fast, it must tell your computer to stop 
sending them until it can catch up.  It does this by signaling the computer 
via a control line to stop sending data.

     In the old 6551 chip design, the 6551 would stop sending bits 
immediately upon getting the signal from the modem to stop sending data.  
It didn't matter where in the current character it was, the chip just 
stopped.  It would then throw away the unused portion of the character it 
was sending and, when asked to start sending data again, restart with the 
next character.  This is, of course, bad -- we have now lost part of a 
character.  To the receiving end, this appears as a missing character on 
the screen, or an error in a file transfer.

     Now the question is whether or not you are affected by this problem.  
You may be run into this "bug" if the following conditions exist:

          o  You are sending data from your computer to another 
             (it may affect uploads, but never downloads).

          o  You are using a high speed modem (9600 bps or faster).

          o  You are using hardware flow-control (sometimes called 
             hardware handshaking)

     What do I do if affected by this problem?

     The only solution to this problem is to purchase a replacement 6551 
chip where the problem has been corrected.  The Harris CDP65C51AE1 chip, 
mentioned in the November 1993 issue, is a good replacement.  I've been 
using it without trouble for over 11 months now.

     Where do I get a replacement?

     Good question -- this is NOT something you can run to Radio Shack(tm) 
for.  You need to order it from a electronic parts supply house.  I do not 
know of anywhere that will sell just one chip, but I'm sure that they 
exist.

     On the other hand, I have purchased a small quantity of these chips 
(about 75 pieces), and am offering them to anyone needing them.  The cost 
is $4 per chip with $3 shipping & handling per order in the US.  Send check 
or money order to the address listed below.  Send E-mail to my Internet 
account for information on shipping costs outside the US.

     Remember, don't fix it if it ain't broke!

[To save you the trouble of asking about the Turbo ASB, read on.  Also, see 
the "Hey Mister Postman" section in this issue of GEnieLamp A2.  On behalf 
of our readers, I asked Mr Higgins about the Turbo ASB, a product he is 
currently working on. -- Ed.]

     The Turbo ASB is an add-on board for an Apple Super Serial Card (or 
compat.).  What is does is eliminate the 19,200 bps barrier that the SSC 
has.  It's an external baud rate generator that pushes the 6551 ACIA to a 
maximum of 230,400 bps.  It also supports standard bps rates of 38,400, 
57,600 and 115,200.

     All you need to take advantage of all this speed is one of my add-on 
cards and a 1-byte change to software.  It will definitely be supported in 
ProTERM, with probable support in ANSIterm, Spectrum, ModemWorks/ProLine, 
and PMP drivers for ACOS.

     The World Wide User Group (WWUG) is our online usergroup, which meets 
the 3rd Sunday of every month.  The online usergroup concept was developed 
to create support for our Apple II community, support which is sadly waning 
in too many areas.

     A special announcement:  WWUG has now been renamed PAL.  T. R. Onan, 
who goes by the name TRON, won the naming contest, and will choose a 
publication from Resource Central as his prize.  PAL -- Planetary Apple 
League -- was voted in primarily because both the acronym and the words say 
volumes; PAL for friend, and what they stand for indicates that we ARE 
indeed a world-wide organization!


WHAT'S NEW IN APPLE II-DOM   AppleWorks 4.01 has now been shipping for a
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   time, and so far, it's been proven to be a 
real nifty update of the ever-popular AppleWorks 3.0, the staple of many 
Apple II users.

     ANSITerm 2.1 is out, and it too, is being hailed as a great 
telecommunications program, that has many new features that were NOT in 
version 2.0.  

     And, finally, Spectrum has been released and has been shipping, and 
is also meeting with great enthusiasm in the Apple II world.  Below, will 
be a short note on the meeting with Dave Hecker of Seven Hills, and Ewen 
Wannop, the author.


PAL MEETING -- JANUARY 19, 1994   Dave Hecker of Seven Hills and Ewen
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Wannop (all the way from England!) graced 
us with their presence at January's meeting of PAL.  Below are a few short 
features of Spectrum, a GS/OS Desktop term program for the GS.

     First, Spectrum is a GS/OS desktop program, therefore, all the 
goodies (inits, desk accessories, etc.) that are available under GS/OS 
desktop programs will be available in Spectrum!  And, users of The Manager, 
HardPressed and AutoArk will be able to use these programs with Spectrum, 
as well!  You could, as well, scribble something in ShadowWrite while still 
online, or go to your calendar NDA and note a date of something you may see 
online to attend!

     Spectrum has many of the "common features" of most telecom programs 
-- it has a chat mode, various emulations available, and a "macro" ability.  
However, Spectrum goes beyond macros, into a total scripting language -- 
which is by far more flexible!  You could even develop a script to run a 
BBS!

     Other features of Spectrum include disk utilities (copy, format, 
delete, and so on).  These are just a few goodies.  To find out more, check 
out SEVENHILLS category in the Apple II RoundTable Bulletin Board, #43.


THE LIBRARY STACKS   Below are some great files...brought to us by our

INTRODUCTION   In this segment of the History, we look further into
""""""""""""   improvements made to AppleWorks, and then take a look at the
newest version, 4.0.


ENHANCEMENTS: BEAGLE BROS AND COMPANY   The next significant AppleWorks
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   add-on appeared in June 1986.  It
was a product sold by Beagle Bros and called MacroWorks.<1>  Written by
Randy Brandt, this program patched itself into the keyboard-reading routine
of AppleWorks and allowed the user to automate certain functions and assign
them to a specific key on the keyboard.  Previously, many of AppleWorks
features were accessed by pressing either the open-apple or solid-apple
(option) key together with another key (recall that the apple keys were
nothing more than access to the pushbutton inputs on the joystick).  For
instance, open-apple and "C" (oa-C) together were used to start a "copy"
function.  Before MacroWorks was patched into the program, either oa-C or
sa-C had the same effect.  After adding this enhancement, the solid-apple
keys were given their own, separate identity, offering more than double the
number of functions that could be executed from the keyboard.  (Pinpoint
had done something similar, by taking sa-P for its own purposes).

     A macro was actually a series of keystrokes that could be entered from
the keyboard (similar to WPL programs for Apple Writer), but was automated
so that a single keypress would activate it.  For example, typing a return
address could be assigned to the sequence solid-apple-A (sa-A).  Or sa-S
could be defined to save ALL the files on the desktop and quit the program.
Anything that could be done manually with AppleWorks could be automated
with MacroWorks, and it could even do some things that could NOT be easily
done manually.

     The idea of automating keystrokes in AppleWorks was not unique to
MacroWorks; soon after, AutoWorks was released by Alan Bird of Software
Touch, and Pinpoint Publishing got into the act with their product,
Keyplayer.  Brandt upped the ante later in 1986 with an upgrade called
Super MacroWorks, which added a few new features and was made to work
specifically with the new version 2.0 of AppleWorks.

     It didn't take long for the other companies to come out with enhanced
versions of their programs to work with the newer version of AppleWorks.
But the most significant enhancement yet came during 1987.  Beagle Bros had
just undergone a change in management, as its founder Bert Kersey retired
and his company merged with Software Touch.  Mark Simonsen and Alan Bird,
owners of Software Touch, had previously worked at Beagle before leaving to
start their own company.  Aside from AutoWorks, they had released
enhancements such as SideSpread (which would allow a spreadsheet to be
printed sideways on a dot matrix printer) and FontWorks (which allowed word
processor files to be printed using different font styles and sizes, using
codes embedded in the WP text).  As they merged back into the Beagle fold,
they brought with them plans for a series of AppleWorks add-ons and
enhancement.  These would be accomplished via a new core program (or
"engine", as they called it) called TimeOut.

     Written by Alan Bird, TimeOut installed itself into AppleWorks and
interfaced directly with Lissner's remarkable built-in memory manager.  The
neat thing about TimeOut was that after the engine itself was installed,
adding other modules was no more complicated than copying them over to the
disk from which AppleWorks started.  This addressed one of the problems
with all of the other enhancement programs available; if they were not
installed in the correct order, the patches would begin to step on each
other, and crashes were much more likely.  TimeOut provided a
clearly-defined protocol for adding new features to AppleWorks without this
patching hassle.

     The first TimeOut modules released included DeskTools, FileMaster
(which allowed file copying and more), Graph (spreadsheet graphing),
QuickSpell, SideSpread (update of the older Software Touch program),
SuperFonts (update of FontWorks), and UltraMacros (a more powerful version
of Randy Brandt's Super MacroWorks, using ideas from AutoWorks).  More
followed in subsequent years, including a thesaurus module and a
full-featured telecommunications module that worked within AppleWorks.


ENHANCEMENTS: JEM SOFTWARE   Over the years, Beagle Bros has been a major
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   contributor to the longevity of AppleWorks
through its many TimeOut enhancements.  And they did many users a favor by
making upgrades available virtually free, through a program they called
"Beagle Buddies".  Just contact your Buddy, give evidence that you really
owned the program, and he would update (for example) UltraMacros from
version 3.0 to 3.1, without charge.  The down side of this service,
however, was that there was NO income received by Beagle for updates,
making it financially difficult to pay the authors of those updates for
their work.  For this reason, authors like Randy Brandt (one of the
AppleWorks 3.0 revision authors) have decided to start their own private
company for release of other products for AppleWorks.  Through his company,
JEM Software, he released PathFinder, which made setting the pathname for
the AW "Add Files" menu easier and faster to change.  Although that feature
was built in to AW 3.0, Brandt did not stop there.  With the help of Dan
Verkade, he created TotalControl, which added features to the database
module that make specific qualifications for the type of entries that could
be made in new or existing records.  DoubleData changed the database module
so AW could handle twice as many categories per record as it was designed
to do.  Mr. Invoice made it possible to produce invoice-type documents with
AppleWorks, and DB Pix added graphic capability to the database, displaying
single and double hi-res and Print Shop / Print Shop GS graphics.  Brandt
also wrote an update to UltraMacros 3.1, called Ultra 4.0, which added
considerable power to the macro language.  All these add-on programs
enhanced the usefulness of AppleWorks for very specific applications,
significantly extending the lifespan of the program.

     Brandt also came up with the concept of "inits" for AppleWorks.  A
small patch was made to AppleWorks to incorporate this feature.  Adding an
init was simple; it was copied into a subdirectory called AW.INITS, and any
binary program found there with a name that started with "I." was
automatically loaded and patched in at startup time.  These inits ranged
from one that improved the handling of the screen print function built-in
to AW, to other much larger applications (TotalControl was added via an
init, for example).  The difference between these inits and TimeOut
applications was that inits were always working, whereas TimeOut programs
had to be specifically activated to work.  Brandt used the same concept of
simple extensions when he designed Ultra 4.0; additional commands (called
"dot commands") could be added to the macro language in the same way as
other inits.


ENHANCEMENTS: PATCHES   As with other popular programs, there have been
"""""""""""""""""""""   many patches that have appeared over the years to
customize AppleWorks to do things more to a particular user's likings.
These first appeared as one to several byte patches that would be applied
using Applesoft, poking the bytes to memory and then using the BASIC.SYSTEM
command "BSAVE" to put them into the right place in the program.  Patches
were published in various places to do things like changing the pitch and
duration of AW's awful error tone, make it possible for AW to access a disk
device in slot 1 or 2 (which it refused to do ordinarily), or make more
than one custom printer (not easily done in versions before 3.0).  Other
patches were published to fix various bugs that were uncovered over time.
Eventually, these patches were collected into several different programs
whose purpose was to streamline the process.  Randy Brandt, through JEM
Software, released Late Nite Patches for AppleWorks 2.0.  John Link created
a program called SuperPatch that he provided via online services initially,
later changed it to shareware as it got more and more massive, and
eventually arranged for it to be sold via Quality Computers.  Written in
Applesoft, John's program made it possible to not only apply the various
patches, but to also remove them neatly.

     Beagle Bros came out with AW 3.0 Companion (later updated to Companion
Plus) which allowed not only a large number of useful changes to be made to
AppleWorks, but also included a version of Mark Munz' Patcher program to
correct some bugs that had made it into the program (and which Claris
refused to fix via an upgrade).  The Beagle program followed John Link's
lead by making it possible to remove most patches as easily as they were
applied.


APPLEWORKS 4.0   The year 1993 brought a major surprise:  Another upgrade
""""""""""""""   for AppleWorks.  Two paths converged during that year to
bring about this unexpected turn of events.  Quality Computers, a
mail-order business based in Michigan, had been steadily increasing in size
and influence during the previous several years.  They began as do most 
such enterprises, selling software and hardware products that various 
companies around the country had available.  One of their earliest 
enterprises was to sell software written by Joe Gleason, the company's 
founder.  They were prominent in their advertising in the Apple II 
magazines that remained in the market; in inCider/A+ magazine they always 
had the first two to four pages of available ad space.  During the early 
1990s, they even began to distribute some hardware items of their own 
(usually produced by another company, who allowed Quality to sell them 
under their own name).  When Beagle Bros decided to concentrate solely on 
their upcoming Macintosh product, Quality stepped in and purchased the 
rights to sell and upgrade the Beagle products, thus expanding their 
influence in the world of Apple II software.

     Randy Brandt, as mentioned above, had also been quite busy with
production of software products to enhance AppleWorks.  Although AppleWorks
3.0 in 1989 had many of the features that he wanted to have, he
continued to come up with new ways to enhance it.  Through Beagle Bros and
his own JEM Software, he continued to create add-on tools to allow users to
get more out of the program.  But in the back of his mind there was always
this wish that AppleWorks ITSELF could be enhanced and fixed, to modernize
it with features that many of the MS-DOS and Macintosh products on the
market had incorporated since that last version of AW was released by
Claris.  Unfortunately, Claris continued to show no interest in
doing ANYTHING with AppleWorks, not even being willing to make the effort
to release an update to fix known bugs in the program.  Claris' other 
AppleII product, AppleWorks GS, suffered from the same neglect.

     In the spring of 1993, Brandt contacted Joe Gleason at Quality
Computers and discussed his interest in a major upgrade to AppleWorks 3.0.
Having worked on the "Spike" project to develop 3.0, Brandt knew the
program inside and out, and knew exactly how he could accomplish his goals
of program enhancement.  The BEST method would be to incorporate the
changes into the program source code and recompile it; but Claris still
held the rights to it.  Gleason was extremely interested in the proposal,
and began holding discussions with Claris to see if they would be willing
to sell the license for releasing AppleWorks to Quality Computers.  This
would give Quality the opportunity to upgrade AppleWorks through a
rewrite, as well as to provide technical support in a way that had not
previously been possible.

     Brandt and his long-time programming associate, Dan Verkade, began
working on the upgrade to AppleWorks (code-named "Quadriga"), while Gleason
negotiated with Claris.  Although they all hoped that it would be possible
to release the finished product as AppleWorks 4.0, they recognized the
possibility that Claris would not relinquish its death grip on the
program.  In that eventuality, it was determined that there would be no
choice but to put it out as a VERY large patch program.  The proposed
product name would be "TheWorks 4.0", and in order to make use of it a
customer would need to already own AppleWorks 3.0.  Installing TheWorks
would patch into AppleWorks and make use of what code in the program was
still useful, but still give access to all the new features they wanted to
include.

     Many features included with the Quadriga project were like a "best-of" 
list from TimeOut modules of the past:  Triple Desktop, which gave access 
to as many as thirty-six files at a time; UltraMacros, in the improved 
"Ultra 4" version that JEM Software had released, in a form which allowed 
playback of pre-compiled macros (the compiler would be available 
separately); DoubleData, to increase the number of available categories in 
the database module from thirty to sixty; TotalControl, which further 
enhanced the abilities of the database; support for more printers, 
including newer style printers such as the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500; 
links between the database and word processor; and links between 
spreadsheets (similar to the "3-D" features that were currently available 
in MS-DOS programs like Lotus 1-2-3).

     While Brandt and Verkade worked on the program code itself, Gleason
was doing his best to convince Claris that it would be in their best
interest to sell AppleWorks to Quality.  As Quadriga was nearing
completion, Gleason showed Claris executives that Quality was prepared to
release it as a patch program, even if AppleWorks was NOT sold to them.
Apparently Claris took this as clear evidence that Quality not only was
determined to follow through on the project, but could pull it
off.  Negotiations became more serious, and by late August 1993 a contract
was signed by both parties.  This contract allowed Quality to purchase (for
an unspecified sum) the rights to publish AppleWorks AND AppleWorks GS,
and have the right to use that product name (which was actually an Apple
trademark licensed to Claris).

     With the legalities out of the way, the Quadriga project proceeded at
full steam.  They had a goal of releasing the program by October 1, but
some last minute problems delayed the actual debut of the program until
November 1, 1993.  As with many programs, some bugs surfaced within a week
of the distribution of v4.0.  However, these were quickly resolved, and
shipping of an updated version 4.01 resumed within a week.  A version 4.02
update was expected by the start of the next year, to fix some other less 
serious problems that had been identified by early users.  Brandt himself 
wrote a small patch program to customize version 4.01 and 4.02.  Compared 
to four years of absolute inactivity by Claris to fixing known problems in 
version 3.0, this was much better support.<2>, <3>


BEYOND APPLEWORKS   AppleWorks is probably the most powerful integrated
"""""""""""""""""   program ever written, in terms of speed (being
text-based) and overall useability for a wide range of purposes.  The one
single problem that it has caused in the Apple II world is that it is SO
comprehensive that it has killed the market for nearly every
other text-based word processor, database, or spreadsheet program, even at
a time when new such programs were being written.  At this point in time,
there would be little point in creating a new text-based program in either 
of these categories, since AppleWorks 4.0 covers all those areas so
comprehensively.  For most users, AppleWorks 4.0 (also known as
AppleWorks "Classic") will meet ALL of their needs in a computer program.
And on an Apple IIgs with expanded memory, the 4.0 version can make it
possible to process and manipulate tremendous amounts of data easily.

     However, what AppleWorks CANNOT do on an Apple IIgs is to take
advantage of some of the features that GS/OS makes available:  Easy access
to foreign disk storage formats, use of outline font technology (via
Pointless), access to a graphic-based work environment, the ability to
switch between multiple programs (via program switchers like The Manager
and Switch-It!) and many other features that IIgs users prefer.  The other
Claris program that Quality purchased, AppleWorks GS, could possibly meet
the requirements for those users.  AWGS (which is actually a rewrite of an
older program, GS Works, purchased by Claris from StyleWare and remodelled
slightly) is significantly different from AppleWorks and cannot be
considered an upgrade, but may meet the needs of IIgs users that want
something more like a desktop publishing program.  Since Quality Computers
has also purchased the rights to AppleWorks GS, IIgs users can look forward
to a revision to THAT program as well, to correct the many known bugs that
IT contains.  And, depending on how good Quality can make it,
AppleWorks GS may not be quite the killer of competing software that
AppleWorks Classic was.  Other programs have been released over the years
that Claris has neglected AWGS to try to fill in the gap, and at least on
the IIgs side of this fence, some healthy competition may result in better
software for all users.

      in pursuing publication of their work electronically on GEnie or via
      disk-based media.  For those looking for online publications, the
      DigiPub Software Libraries offer online magazines, newsletters,
      short-stories, poetry and other various text oriented articles for
      downloading to your computer.  Also available are writers' tools and
      'Hyper-utilties' for text presentation on most computer systems. In
      the DigiPub Bulletin Board you can converse with people in the
      digital publishing industry, meet editors from some of the top
      electronic publications and get hints and tips on how to go about
      publishing your own digital book.  The DigiPub RoundTable is the
      official online service for the Digital Publishing Association.  To
      get there type DIGIPUB or M1395 at any GEnie prompt.
