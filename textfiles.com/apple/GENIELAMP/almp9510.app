Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



                    >>> AGREEABLE TO DISAGREEMENTS <<<
                    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     "Maybe there's something here to make you think or make you laugh or 
just make you mad.  Any of those reactions would please me.  Boredom, 
however, would be a bummer."  That's Stephen King writing, in his one 
non-fiction book to date, _Danse Macabre_.

     That's pretty much how I feel about my editorials.  This month, I'm 
delighted to report that some people on the Usenet newsgroup 
comp.sys.apple2 actually felt that my September editorial deserved some 
discussion.  In fact, one of the csa2 denizens actually wrote to me, as 
you'll see in this month's "From My Mailbox".  Thanks a lot, Mr. Lee!

     (I have to say I noticed the fact that the messages were titled 
"Genielamp editorial".  Capitalization aside, it's GEnieLamp _A2_, folks.  
There is a GEnieLamp A2Pro, you know.  Not to mention versions for five 
other platforms.  At least you didn't separate "GEnie" from "Lamp"!)

     If you missed it, last month's editorial was about the movement to
send in "Tell Apple About..." registration cards to Apple Computer, Inc.  
The part that seemed to provoke the most reaction was this paragraph:

     "Apple Computer has been doing all right.  But it could have done 
better.  Perhaps they don't miss the revenue they've lost, but they have 
indeed lost revenue with its cavalier treatment of its original customers.  
They're so big, they don't notice little losses... until they start to add 
up."  (For a summary of the issue and my response, please see this month's 
"From My Mailbox".)

     Also, Ron Wilson objected to my use of the phrase "some shmoe in the 
mailing room", claiming that it was elitist.  By objecting, Ron earned me a 
dollar!  (He earned himself absolutely nothing.  Sorry, Ron.)

     In my original draft of the editorial, the wording was "some poor 
sap", which I thought was nicely neutral.  Someone else read the editorial, 
pointed out that "sap" wasn't neutral at all, but added the comment "but no 
one's going to notice".  Instead of choosing a more neutral phrase ("some 
unfortunate soul"), I deliberately chose a slightly less neutral one, and 
made a $1 bet that someone out there would notice.

     The other person (whom I won't be naming, since s/he lost) knew how 
little mail I get, either good or bad, and took the bet.  Heh heh heh.  
Never bet against the GEnieLamp A2 readship!

     It's really heart-warming to provoke discussion.  Writers and editors 
often feel as though their thoughts and words are falling down a well, or 
into the bottom of Echo Canyon.  It's gratifying to learn otherwise.

     I managed to stir up response with another part of September's 
GEnieLamp A2... when I reviewed FAXination 0.1.6.  Michael Ewen was 
displeased that I'd reviewed software even though I couldn't get it to work 
(presumably on the grounds that other people have been able to get it to 
work).  I was of the opinion that if I couldn't get it to work, that was 
precisely the sort of thing that a reviewer should mention (on the grounds 
that other people have had NO success in getting to work).  The review was 
as balanced as my experiences with the product allowed it to be.

     As far as I know, I didn't convert Mr Ewen to my point of view any 
more than he converted me to his... we've agreed to disagree.  I don't 
intend to rehash the whole issue in this month's editorial, but I do want 
to assure you that I want to hear from you whenever you read something in 
GEnieLamp A2 that makes you think, makes you laugh, or makes you mad.

                                 [*][*][*]


     I find that getting mad is often counterproductive.  (So is exploding 
with rage or dying of a heart attack brought on by stress, so I still let 
myself get mad sometimes.)  That's why I was so delighted by the comments 
that Ryan Suenaga attached to one of his "Tell Apple About..." cards.  
You'll find it in the Message Spotlight section of HEY MISTER POSTMAN, but 
it deserves mention here because I consider it this month's guest 
editorial.

     If you like what Ryan has written, please write him and tell him so.  
(In other words, treat him better than you treat me. <grin>)

Letters To The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""


SEPTEMBER EDITORIAL   I read the Sep 1995 issue of GEnieLamp [A2] and found 
"""""""""""""""""""   the editorial very interesting.  Doug Cuff said Apple 
probably didn't miss the people who had Apple II's and decided not to buy 
Macs because of the way Apple treated II users.  Well, I'll disagree on one 
point, that Apple doesn't miss us.  A case in point my old grammar school, 
which has been using Apple IIe's as far back as I can remember back in 6th 
grade, recently puchased a bunch of PC clones for their computer lab.  
Apple if they had continued supporting the Apple II would have had a 
permanent presence in the educational market.  Instead they tried to push 
the Mac, and while a lot of schools jumped in, some just switched over to 
PC's.

     Also, from news reports, Apple has lost a bit of it's marketshare in 
the computer world, and with the introduction of Windows 95, one magazine 
said this might sound the death kneel for Apple Computer.  Since I'm going 
to get a new computer soon to complement my Apple IIe, I was considering a 
Mac, but with the news going around about Apple, I am reconsidering.  Apple 
has missed us, they might've not missed us before because the Mac was way 
ahead of the PC a few years ago, but the PC's are coming on and maybe 
people are jumping in and leaving the Mac behind, and now Apple will regret 
that they didn't treat Apple II users right.

          I don't think you and I disagree; I think we just express the 
          same concept differently.  I know Apple isn't doing as well in 
          the education field as they could have done, but Apple probably 
          thinks it just isn't doing as well as it should be doing.  See 
          the difference?  We know what they did to tick us off, but Apple 
          has long since forgotten us, and that they've ticked us off, and 
          is reacting to results rather than causes.--Ed.

>>>>>   I received the last GS+ the other day and it was another excellent
"""""   issue, albeit emotional to read.

     I realize this was the last issue, but a correction needs to be 
raised.  In the Letters section on page five, Mr. Avilla asked if Animasia 
3-D is compatible with the Second Sight.  The reply was misleading.  You 
stated that Animasia 3-D uses the special graphics Fill Mode which is not 
supported by the Second Sight.  In actuality, Animasia 3-D's use of Fill 
Mode can be disabled by unchecking the Optimize option in the Animate 
Options dialog box.  Therefore, Animasia 3-D works just fine with the 
Second Sight.  The Optimize/Fill Mode feature is explained clearly in both 
the Reference and Tutorial manuals.  Regretably, the lasting impression 
will be that the two are incompatible.

AV SYSTEMS CUSTOMER REACTION   People that know me, know that I am a quiet 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   and polite person.  I don't publicly say bad 
things about people unless they have really crossed the line.

     You may remember that a message (#71) was recently posted about 
Adrian Vance and mentioned a new catalog advertising the Apple II disks his 
company sells.

     I recently had an Internet encounter with Mr. Vance where I was 
personally attacked (via email) for a question and a suggestion that I 
posted in the comp.sys.apple2.usergroups newsgroup.

     Like most folks here in A2 and A2Pro, I appreciate the work Charlie 
does in keeping the bulletin board organized so information is easy to find 
and of a relevant nature.  If you've ever lurked around the Internet 
newsgroups you'll notice that people frequently post in wrong areas.  While 
this is common for newbies, it is not expected of seasoned computer 
veterans.

     Well... to make a long story short, I got tired of seeing Mr. Vance's 
posts/advertisements in the wrong newsgroups. When I look in the 
"usergroups" area, I expect to find information about user groups.  Adrian 
knows better, he's been around for many years.  So I posted a simple 
message...

EW> Does this catalog provide any user group information?
EW> If not, you shouldn't be posting this type of message here.

     I received a rather nasty and unexpected email reply...

AV> ...After you have done that I would respectfully request
AV> that you roll the paper into a thin tube and shove it up
AV> your a**, jerk.

AV> And don't try to buy anything from us.  I've recorded
AV> your name and we will not sell any of our 450 Apple II
AV> disks to you.

     To which I replied...

EW> I stand by my comment.  It was not rude or out of place.
EW> You are an experienced computer person and know better.
EW> The User Group newsgroup is ONLY for User Group information,
EW> not advertisements for products.  The marketplace group
EW> is the proper place...

     And received the following...

AV> Dear Erick Jerk:
AV>   Why don't you stand by your comment until Hell freezes
AV>   over...

AV>   Who appointed you to the Usenet Police Force?  As
AV> usual, with your kind, you're wrong, out to lunch and
AV> stupid.  And again, take your complaint and shove it.

     I found Mr. Vance's remarks to be vulgar and without any basis.  
While I wish to support as many Apple II vendors as possible, I will not do 
any business with him.  Besides, most of the software he sells (if I 
remember correctly) would be considered packaged public domain and 
shareware software (with perhaps some new or modified programs by Adrian).  
Personally, I would obtain software of this type either directly from the 
GEnie libraries or buy it from Joe Kohn of Shareware Solutions II.  Don't 
forget to support your local user group library if you are fortunate enough 
to have one!

     I'm not looking to turn this into an Adrian Vance hatefest. I just 
want folks to be informed consumers.  And part of being informed is knowing 
how reputable the supplier is.

     Also, the Internet is a lot like the Wild West.  Lots of gunslingers 
shooting off flaming messages with little [law] enforcement taking place.  
So you folks just getting started with newsgroups or IRC should take note.  
Don't take it too personally.

Erick
                 (E.WAGNER10, CAT4, TOP39, MSG:72/M645;1)

>>>>>   A couple of years ago I purchased several disks from this
"""""   individual's catalog.  When I wrote him about some problems with 
the programs I also was viciously & vilely assaulted.  As an urban medic, I 
have been exposed to some pretty rough stuff.  Frankly, Vance's response to 
my polite complaint was worse than vulgar.  Let it suffice to say that 
Erick's encounter was very similar to mine --- wild ravings, vile personal 
attacks etc.  My encounter,however, resulted from some legitimate 
complaints about his product/service.  I, too, was told that it would be a 
cold day before he would ever sell an item to me (I was marked!).

     Interestingly, I still frequently receive his catalogs.  It is a 
shame that so many worthy & reputable Apple II vendors & publications have 
ceased to exist while this individual continues to survive.  The attitude 
that exists in this RT ( & most of the Apple II community) is the opposite 
of what A. Vance exhibited to me --- and apparently others.

     I believe I am justified in saying that the buyer most definitely 
must be aware if dealing w/Adrian Vance --- & don't dare complain or 
criticize (unless you want to experience a flaming worse than you could 
ever imagine). Quick example, I paid over $10.00 for a GS shareware game 
that is in the A2 library [this was before I knew about the A2 RT & was 
just beginning to learn about modems/on-line services].  The catalog lead 
me to believe that this was a commercial game that filled a 3.5 disk and 
would run on any GS. When I couldn't get it to run I wrote him for help.  I 
also mentioned my dissapointment with some of the other programs whose 
quality was less than what the catalog implied.  The response was far from 
what one would expect from a business (& certainly not what I learned in my 
business courses).

     In his defense, though the catalog never mentioned shareware, the 
appropriate "read-me" notice was included on the disk.  I suppose he has 
the right to sell public domain/shareware at whatever (high) price he 
chooses.  I just believe his catalog should be less "this is wonderful" & 
more accurately describe the product.  I can find no defense for his 
approach to customer relations.

     No one should have to put up with the type of verbal assault Erick & 
I received from Adrian Vance.  Unfortunately, not many other sources for 
Apple II programs exist.  It is my opinion that there are better, & less 
costly, sources remaining.  Personaly, even if his prices were not a factor 
I would never purchase something from this individual or a company he is 
affiliated with (e.g. The AV Catalog).

>>>>>   Since this is the Vendors Press Release topic, the discussions
"""""   following the post of AV Systems recent press release, to include 
vendettas, testimonials, opinions, personal feelings, etc., probably are 
appropriate here.....

     Before I go further, I must state that I paid a lot of money for ad 
space in the next AV Systems Catalog, which was the topic of the original 
post.  Beyond that, I feel I must make a couple of observations.....

     ERICK, unless I read incorrectly, you stated that you took upon 
yourself to act as TOPIC COP in an area of the Internet.  Adrian Vance was 
the target of your post; I agree that Adrian posts his "press releases" 
often, and readers may get tired of it (however, recent GS+ ads, preceeding 
their RIP post, were long in the extreme, on the internet and nobody 
indicated any outrage).

     You state that Adrain posted responses to you in E-MAIL, which means 
he went private with you.  On that note, I feel it inappropriate for you to 
take those private messages public, here on GEnie.  Your response seems a 
bit out of the ordinary for this group.  I personally was offended by your 
action, and that feeling has nothing to do with my having space in the 
catalog.

     To all others; AV Catalog deals with, primarily, educational 
software. The catalog defines and reminds the reader about Copyable 
Software (not copy protected) and whether such software is Public Domain.  
I will carefully review the Winter/Spring 1995 catalog I have here to make 
certain, but I do not recall ANY PUBLIC DOMAIN software in there, nor any 
software that should not be there......

     AV Systems is one of the last of the Apple II vendors remaining.  You 
don't have to like Adrian Vance.  Nobody is asking for that.  But don't 
bring private arguments public as a warning to the rest of us.  That does 
not belong here.  Private means private; taking YOUR side of a private 
argument public is by demonstrating the evil other side of that argument is 
not fair to the other party, and we have no idea how much you quoted out of 
context in the second place, and besides, none of what you, ERICK, and Mr. 
Vance are doing is any of OUR business.

WOZNIAK SPEAKS OUT ABOUT APPLE   The following is re-posted from DaveNet. I 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   think you'll find it _most_ interesting...

   From: Steve Wozniak, steve@woz.org
   Re: Apple is a Lousy Lover

   I concur strongly but not wholeheartedly with your Apple comments.

   Mike Markkula organized Apple as a marketing driven company. And Steve
   Jobs spoke out for buying the current technologies of the world and
   adding value by piecing them together to create complete, finished
   computers.

   So Apple is not the company I had hoped it would be.

   I always thought that a major player in the personal computer
   business, with their label on the products, would be composed of top
   engineers and multiple labs full of scientists developing new devices
   out of physics and chemistry. I only worked for HP and Apple. HP had
   lots of such labs. In fact they had chip manufacturing plants in each
   division around 1976, for a technological edge. HP was known inside
   and out as an engineering oriented company.

   It seemed to me in recent years that new software diverted to the PC
   because of market share. You try to put the cause more on alienation
   of developers. Have you worked with executives of producers of major
   software titles who had full choice to choose which platforms to
   develop for? My experience tells me that they go for market share. But
   Apple had a lot of very dedicated fans who saw how right and good the
   Mac OS was, and would never switch. Extreme loyalty was perhaps
   Apple's strongest strength.

   I feel that Apple has hurt and alienated both the loyal developers and
   loyal users. The developer who finds his platform and libraries and
   development language yanked back and forth finally gives up the
   loyalty. The user who buys a PowerBook full of red stickers "Ready for
   PowerPC upgrade" (I leave mine on) finds that the computer is dropped
   from Apple's line before the upgrade is even available.

   You fall in love with one model of Mac and convince yourself what a
   great computer you have, and half a year later it's obsolete and
   uncertain to work with the niftiest apps of the future. Customer
   loyalty fades.

   I think Apple lost a lot in the Microsoft lawsuit. Apple should have
   sued them for *not* copying the Mac as closely as possible. Had we
   gone to Microsoft and said "do anything the way we've already found is
   good, for 25 cents" the result might have been a commonality as
   beneficial to Apple as Microsoft. When you're comfortable with one OS
   because of all your skills, it's scary to change. Were the two
   platforms very similar, the comfort feeling wouldn't trap Mac users or
   PC users to their familiar machines.

   John Sculley, and others, were outspoken as to the importance of Apple
   reaping great rewards by keeping everything proprietary, with examples
   of how US companies licensed away the world to the Japaneese. But the
   result is a totally owned and protected OS that leads to loyal users
   because it's hard to step out of it into an OS very different. So Mac
   users are trapped into Macs as long as the Mac is very different from
   the alternatives.

   I feel most sorry that the best quality people are not solidly in the
   Mac camp anymore.

   About me: I'm a private evangelist for the school district in Los
   Gatos, where I live. I had two goals in life, to be an engineer and to
   teach 5th grade. For several years I've been teaching computers to not
   only teachers but also 5th through 8th graders.

ADVERTISE IN SHAREWARE SOLUTIONS II?   Joe, with the Demise of GS+, there 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   is now essentially no place for 
Apple II vendors to advertise.

     Might you consider adding a classifieds section, and even taking real 
ads?

TomZ
                  (A2.TOMZ, CAT28, TOP4, MSG:175/M645;1)

>>>>>   I wouldn't have considered it before now, but with the recent
"""""   demise of GS+ Magazine, maybe now is the time to reconsider.

     First off, I would not want to sacrifice any editorial content to 
make room for ads.  So, including ads would require increasing the size of 
the newsletter.

     If that were to happen, the page count would have to be increased to 
24 pages per issue.  That would have 2 very major consequences...it would 
increase the cost of printing SSII by 20%, and it would bump the postage 
costs up to the next level, meaning that it would cost an additional $.23 
to send each issue to a US address (and a heckuva lot more to send it 
overseas).

     As you can all imagine, SSII's profit margin is slim, and I do not 
want to do anything that could jeopardize the future of SSII.  That means 
that in order for any ads to even be considered, they'd have to at least 
pay for themselves, as far as printing/postage costs.

     So, without saying yes, and without saying no, and without making any 
committment whatsoever to carry ads...let me suggest that if there are any 
Apple II vendors who might want to advertise in SSII, contact me.

     In all honesty, SSII's finances are just fine, and I wouldn't want to 
do anything to jeopardize the financial well being of SSII.  To paraphrase 
(because I can't remember the exact quote), 'he who does not learn from 
history is bound to repeat the mistakes of the past.'

     So, this is going to take a lot of thought.  When making decisions 
that are monumental, I like to mull everything over for a loooong time.

"""""   might really consider that classified section, too.  I know a lot 
of folks, me included, get some magazines for the ads, not the articles.  
:)

     The problem is you might not fill the ad section.  Maybe you should 
keep with the newsletter tradition and do what the newspapers do--add a 
special ad section that is printed separately from the newsletter, and just 
fasten them together (or fold them together if they are in an envelope by 
then).

     Just a thought.

SHAREWARE SOLUTIONS II TO SELL GAMES   As most of you know, I worked for 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Big Red Computer Club for several 
years, and over the years have remained friends and in contact with BRCC's 
owner.

     As you also know, BRCC is still in business, but because they haven't 
advertised or actively promoted the software they carry, sales are 
(understandably) way down.  Although nothing definite has been decided, 
BRCC is thinking about closing down the Apple II end of the business.

     However, they still have a large software inventory, so we've just 
agreed to transfer a lot of BRCC's IIe/IIc un-sold entertainment programs 
to Shareware Solutions II.  Among some of the IIe/IIc titles that will 
become available from Shareware Solutions II will be Neuromancer, Dragon 
Wars, Qix, Renegade, Print Master PS Graphic Disks, and possibly some 
AtariSoft titles.  There may be others.

     Stay tuned for details. And, expect a few more surprises from SSII...

     In fact, the next announcement you hear may knock your socks off.  
No, strike that last comment from the record.  It _will_ knock your socks

CONVERT 3200 FROM II   Shareware Solutions II has plans to distribute a

conversion program.  Its primary use is to convert GIF and TIFF and BMP 
graphics (as well as several other formats common to PCs) to 3200 color

"""""   version of Convert3200, by the author of Convert 3200. As you read 
the following, please keep in mind that English is not the author's native 
language:

Some good things about Convert 3200 :

        - it is fast (15 sec for 3200, 6 sec for 256, 2 sec for 16)
        - it is not expensive ($15)
        - it loads a lot of foreign file formats (gif,pcx,iff,bmp,bin, tiff 
          (with some restrictions), and all IIgs formats)
        - it can save in foreign file format (pcx,iff,bin,tiff...)
        - it lets you resize the picture exactly as you want
        - it handles the Printshop GS conversion very well
        - it is very easy to use (only 1 'Convert Area' botton)
        - it is able to work alone : it can load, convert and save the file 
          from one folder without any help. (you have only to give the 
          start folder, the destination folder, the kind of conversion you 
          wish and it will work alone.
        - it has a lot of low levels options : you can modify the rgb 
          component, remove some colors yourself, access to a lot of 
          statistics (number of colors, use frequency of the color..)
        - online help (just hit the tab key)
        - you can parameter the work of the conversion (script editor)
        - one "I believe in god" option :-)
        - some nice easter eggs
        - you can put yourself the 16 palettes in the 256 mode conversion 
          (hit on the option key in the same time than you click on the 
          convert area botton. After this, use the tab key to change the 
          palette, the click to put it on a line, the esc key to start the 
          conversion).
        - ALL THE SOURCE CODE WILL BE FREELY AVAILABLE FOR THE BUYERS !!

     the bad things :

        - the converted area can't be larger than 320*200
        - it is only working with 256 color picture. it can't work with 
          true colors pictures as TGA, JPEG, some Tiff format...
        - it won't save using gif file format because of the law problem 
          around the algorithm LZW.
        - it doesn't support the second sight card

GREETING CARD CONTEST CLOSES   The Shareware Solutions II Greeting Card 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Contest is now officially ended.

     It's now time to start going through all the contest entries to pick 
the winners.  But, the truth of the matter is that so many phenomenal 
desktop published designs came in that it's simply going to be impossible 
to choose one winner per category.

     Let me try to describe my dilemma...

     For more than 2 years, I've been using AWGS to layout SSII, so I 
thought I knew the program pretty well and thought I had a grasp on its 
capabilities.

     And, then a newsletter created with AWGS arrives as a contest entry 
that has even me thinking, "I didn't know you could do that on a IIGS."

     There's some tough decisions to be made, as many wonderful entries 
came in that had been created with AWGS, including greeting cards, order 
forms, a User Group brochure, envelope templates, letterheads, and even 
more greeting cards.

     In any case, I'd like to thank all of you who entered the contest, 
and I'd like to salute all of you for "doing what can't be done on an Apple 
II."

     There sure are a number of you out there doing creative and artistic 
work, and I'm very very impressed.  Actually, I'm in awe of what people are 
able to create with a little imagination and an Apple II. You will be too 
when you've seen what I've seen.

about Hyperstudio or Hypercard cards?

   -=-= Preliminary Rules for "Operation Happy Birthday Apple IIgs" =-=-
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Cards must be made entirely on an Apple II family machine (Apple II, II+, 
  //e, iic, IIgs).
- Any graphic can be used, imported, or scanned (as long as the Apple II 
  software will handle it).
- Any printer can be used to print or emboss the card (as long as it's 
  driven by an Apple II machine).
- All cards must carry the line (or something similar in text) "Made 
  entirely by an Apple IIgs"  (or Apple //e, etc.)
- Upload all cards to A2 Library #62 "Desktop Publishing."  Include as a 
  keyword "Birthday."
- Give yourself credit either on the card or in the upload.
- There is no size limit.
- You may download, print and send as many cards to Apple as you wish.
- Cards should be sent to Apple to arrive on September 15, 1996.

Any further suggestions?

This is "Operation Happy Birthday Apple IIgs" - Ten Years Old.  Next year 
we can do the original Apple II - Twenty Years Old, as Ryan suggested. (Did 
I get those ages correct?)

tradition, the Byte Works is having a garage sale to clear out boxes of 
high-quality, printed manuals from the days before laserprinting. Back in 
those days, we had to print 1000 copies of a product to keep the unit cost 
down.  Today, we're faced with several boxes each of some products.  We 
don't want to throw them out, but we don't want to store more than we'll 
ever need.

     So we decided to sell these popular products to you at garage sale 
prices. How low will we go?  As low as 60% off of mail order prices!   You 
decide the price, because the more you buy, the lower the price.   Buy just 
one product from this list, and you already get a substantial 25% discount.  
But if you buy two programs, either from this list or from our general 
catalog, you take 33% off of any program in the sale list.  Buy and 4 or 
more programs from our current catalog and you take 60% off of any program 
in our sale list!  At one time, distributors paid more for these programs 
when they ordered them by the hundred!

     Of course, you may be wondering if we'll ever do the same thing with 
our other programs.  In a word, no.  You see, all of our other programs are 
printed as we need them, so we don't have boxes of them sitting in storage. 
Only the products on this sale list will ever be sold  at prices like 
these.

     But hurry, because even these products won't be sold at garage sale 
prices forever!  On Halloween night, October 31, 1995, we'll throw out all 
of the extra programs.  And if we get down to the last box of any program, 
we'll stop selling it at the sale price--we want to keep a few for 
desperate people in the years to come!  So if you want unbelievable garage 
sale prices on some of our most popular programs ever, get your order in 
fast!

SCRIPT-CENTRAL RIDES AGAIN   Shareware Solutions II, in association with 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Southern Rock Software, is pleased to announce 
the availability of Script-Central.

     Script-Central is an interactive HyperCard IIGS based magazine on 
disk that was produced and distributed from 1991-1995 by ICON and Resource 
Central. All in all, 22 issues, each comprising two 3.5" disks, were 
produced. Originally available by subscription only, Shareware Solutions II 
is making all those back issues available for purchase once again.

     Script-Central has a dual focus and serves as both a showcase for the 
very best HyperCard-generated software ever created, and as an on-going 
tutorial and resource guide for those who want to learn how to use 
HyperCard to create their own software or presentations.

     In order to run any issue of Script-Central, your IIGS system must 
meet the minimum requirements that are necessary to run HyperCard; those 
are a hard disk drive and at least 2 Megabytes of RAM.

     Additionally, you must own HyperCard IIGS (See below).

     Shareware Solutions II is making Script-Central available as single 
issues or multiple issue sets. Following are all applicable pricing 
options:

     Single issues are available for $7 each.

     A six issue combo pack (choose any six issues) is available for $36. 
Shipping charges are $3 for US destinations or $5 elsewhere. As a bonus, we 
will include a one disk "HyperCard Player" that will allow you to launch 
each issue of Script-Central.

     You can purchase all 22 issues for $99. As a bonus, we will include 
the full six disk set that comprises HyperCard IIGS. Due to the weight 
involved, shipping charges are $6 for US or Canada delivery; $20 elsewhere.

     For those of you who wish to purchase the one disk "HyperCard 
Player," it is available for $5, with no additional shipping charges 
required. Please be aware that the one disk version of HyperCard is just 
fine for using Script-Central, but in order to use HyperCard to create your 
own stacks, you will need the complete six disk set. That complete 
HyperCard IIGS disk set is available for $15.

     Lastly, we have a one disk demo version of Script-Central available 
for $5, or $8 for both the demo disk and the one disk "HyperCard Player."

     All orders will be shipped by air mail, and Shareware Solutions II 
can accept money orders or checks made payable in US funds to "Joe Kohn."

SOFTDISK (_NOT_ SOFTDISK GS) CEASES PUBLICATION   Learning that GS+ would 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   no longer be published 
was bad enough, but that same day I was also notified that issue #166 of 
Softdisk would be the final issue of the Apple II software subscription.  
It may be a cliche, but "Woe is me" is about all I can think of to say 
right now.  My mind is numb & I feel as if someone cut off several vital 
parts of my body.

     Although I also subscribe to Softdisk G-S I looked forward to the 
"Monthly Mystery", Appleworks templates, games etc. that will no longer 
appear in my mailbox.   I'd like to say "Thanks for the memories"  & be 
understanding of the economics that caused this decision to be made --- but 
I also want to scream, cry, curse & ....... I can't take this!

     Please tell me that Softdisk G-S will not soon join the exodus.

     Dear Softdisk G-S Subscribers,

     To dispel your fears and raise your hopes:

     Excerpts from Diskovery [Issue #69]
     by Lee Golden

     The time has come (once again) to promote ourselves and our friends 
in the industry around us. As the months fly by toward 1996, 1997, and 
beyond, the early days of the Apple II computer with Steve Jobs and the Woz 
are further and further away. This column, from Tom Hall's G.Essence to 
this Diskovery, has tried many times to convince you to support those who 
support you. It is now more imperative that you do so.

     It seems like just last month that A+/inCider filled our mailbox 
every month. Was it really three years ago? Resource Central has been 
reduced to a couple of spin off publications and a summer conference. 
Remember when A-2 Central was the biggest publication going? It seems GS+, 
even with their high-quality articles and programmer-specific pieces 
couldn't keep enough customers in the door to publish bi-monthly. (I've 
heard they will continue selling software as EGO Systems, P.O. Box 15366, 
Chattanooga, TN, 37415-0366.)

     When you receive Softdisk G-S, show it to your friends, talk about at 
User Group meetings, [join a User Group!] and especially use Industry 
Connection to locate/purchase new things.

     Now, I also don't want you to become paranoid. Softdisk G-S has some 
incredible submitters, some fantastic editors and enough money to be around 
for a VERY long time. Others are not so fortunate. Keep us informed. Tell 
us what you like (and don't like) and we will keep you happy for years to 
come.

     Here's the Publications listing from Industry Connection. If we left 
anyone out, let me know!!!

HYPERCARD IIGS MANUALS BACK IN PRINT   Yesterday I got 4 orders for the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   reprinted HyperCard IIGS manuals. 
That put the total at 11, one more than I said I would need to reprint the 
books as an APDA product.  Thanks, guys!

     We ordered the books today.  It will be a week to 10 days before we 
get them back, and you'll be charged at that time.  The orders will ship 
2-3 days later.

     For those of you who were waiting, wait no more!  HyperCard is 
definitely back.  And as an APDA product, it will stay that way.  For 
details, see Cat 19, Top 4, Mess. 31.  I'll also repost everything in an 
official press release as soon as I wade out from under the project I'm 
working on right now.

ABC DIRECT DISK DRIVE   I asked David Hardaway of ABC Direct about the 
"""""""""""""""""""""   SuperDrive controller that they are planning and 
got this response:

     We are still on schedule for a 1.44MB controller card for the Apple 
//e and IIGS.  The card will ship probably in October 95 at a current 
projected price of $129.00.  This may go up or down as project gets closer 
to completion

     For those  of you who had not heard, ABC is marketing SuperDrive 
compatible disk drives, basically the same drives marketed by Applied 
Engineering before they went out of business. A message from David earlier 
this year about those is appended:

     "Platinum cased, 1.44MB External disk drives that use the Sony 
mechanism. Will work with all SuperDrive compatible Macintosh computers.  
The Ultra 1.44MB connects directly to non-SuperDrive computers. Enables Mac 
Plus,   SE and Mac II computers to run 1.44MB disks without the SuperDrive 
upgrade."

     According to David, the Plus drive will work just fine with an Apple 
IIGS...as an 800K drive without the card, and once the card is available, 
as a 1.44MB disk drive.

SUPERCONVERT 4.0 FEATURES   I think the JPEG rumor started at KansasFest. 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   :)  Here's the poop:

     o  SuperConvert v4.0 _will_ support viewing on the Second Sight card.

     o  It _MIGHT_ support loading color JPEGs (i.e. we're working on it 
        while waiting for an updated Second Sight ROM, but aren't 
        guaranteeing anything)

     The way it would work: JPEGs would be loaded as a "True Color" image. 
SuperConvert's "True Color" images will be directly viewable on the 
(updated) Second Sight card with no conversion necessary.

     If you don't have a capable SS card then some conversion will be 
necessary first, and we haven't finalized exactly how we're going to handle 
that (probably a confirmation message about "do you want to convert the 
image to view it" with a preference to automatically do it without asking).

     BTW/FYI: Any "conversion" to view on the Second Sight card would be a 
conversion in the bit depth (colors) and/or resolution of the image. 
GIF/TIFF/PICT/JPEG (and Apple Preferred, SHR Screen, etc.) are simply 
different _formats_ that a given graphic can be stored in. That is, the 
image's bit depth and resolution doesn't necessarily change among the file 
formats; only the _way_ that data is stored changes.

     For example, Format A might save the image data this way:
       Words 1-2-3: R-G-B values for pixel #1
       Words 4-5-6: R-G-B values for pixel #2

     While Format B might save the same image data this way:
       Words 1-2-3: B-R-G values for pixel #2,000
       Words 4-5-6: B-R-G values for pixel #1,999

     Both formats can describe the _exact_ same images; they each just 
have a different way of storing that image data on disk.

     Another way to think of it: Knowing that you have a "GIF" file versus 
a "TIFF" file doesn't tell you how many colors are in the picture, or what 
the size/resolution of the picture is; it just tells you what _format_ the 
picture is saved in (i.e. "I know 'ACME Painter' knows how to read GIF 
files, so I can use any image that happens to be stored in the GIF file 
format").

     The only affect the file _format_ has on a graphic image is that the 
particular format may have limitations. For example, imagine you have an 
8-bit color image (a max. of 256 colors) that is 1000x1000 pixels big. If 
you wanted to save this as a TIFF or GIF image there is no problem, because 
those file formats can save an image that large, and the formats do allow 
saving 256 colors.

     However, if you wanted to save the same image in the "MacPaint" 
format, the image data would have to be adjusted to fit into the 
limitations of that format (in particular, the bit depth would have to be 
reduced from 8-bits to just 2-bits, and the image size would have to be 
reduced significantly).

     I called Vitesse on Tuesday (9/5) and the gal who answered the phone 
told me the fofollowing: Unless Bill has the bug squashing done and a final 
product to them by the end of this month, they will cancel (CANCEL) the 
project and refund all  orders to date. So if any of you have any influence 
with Bill, beg (and I use that term literally) him to find the time to get

"""""   3D by the end of the month that Vitesse would cancel it, I emailed 
Scott Everts, who did the art. This was his reply:

     Bill no longer works for Interplay and I don't talk to him much 
anymore.  I haven't had a talk with Kevin at Vitesse in quite awhile 
either.  The last version I got had no save or load function, no menu bar 
support, and some of the monsters caused the game to crash. It was close, 
but still not finished.  The problem is, Bill won't finish the game.  He is 
working at a new company and has no time to work on it.  I tried my hardest 
to convince him to finish it, but its no use.  I seriously don't think it 
will see the light of day.  I'm rather mad about it since I worked so hard 
on the art and Bill promised me it would ship.  Oh, well.

     Sorry for the bad news, but I think that's it for the GS.  I finally 
shelled out the money for a Pentium 133.  I plan to keep my GS, but without 
the support of GS+ magazine, we don't have a hard copy forum for 
advertising anymore.  I'm very saddened about it after all this time, but 
it looks like the party is over.   :(

     The card that I have for my Apple IIgs says to add additional 
comments in a letter if there is not enough space.  Here's my additional 
comments :)

September 15, 1995

Apple Computer, Inc.
One Infinite Loop
Cupertino, CA  95015

To whom it may concern:

     I am writing this to Tell Apple about a problem with my Apple IIgs.

     The problem I am having is that Apple Computer, Inc., has forgotten 
that it exists.

     I want to take this opportunity to than Apple Computer, Inc., for 
providing us with the most versatile and useful piece of computing 
equipment in the history of man:  the Apple II.

     This letter and response card are being sent on September 15, 1995, 
exactly nine years to the date of the introduction of the Apple IIgs.

     The Apple II community has survived for years with little assistance 
from Apple Computer, Inc.  In recent years it has survived with none.  
Years after the last Apple II rolled off of the assembly lines, the Apple 
II community is cruising the Internet, printing on laser printers, using 
TrueType and Postscript fonts, viewing photographic images on SVGA 
monitors, playing with CD Roms and huge hard drives, and still using 
Appleworks all these years later.

     The Apple II is still a force in education, where there are more 
Apple II computers in use today than any other type of computer.  Many 
young children still have their first computing experience on an Apple II.

     The Apple II user is still churning out term papers and homework 
assignments, doing graduate level statistics and Master's thesis, writing 
resumes and preparing presentations, all with an Apple II.

     The only problem I have with the Apple II is with Apple Computer, 
Inc. Apple Computer, Inc. doesnUt remember us anymore, which is amazing 
considering that the Apple II built Apple Computer, Inc.  If there had 
never been an Apple II, there never would have been an Apple ///, a Lisa, a 
Macintosh, a Newton, a Performa, a Powerbook, a Quadra, a PowerMacintosh, 
maybe never a Next or Windows or even an IBM PC.  Without us there may 
never have been spreadsheets or integrated software or graphics or color 
for personal computers.

     What does forgetting us mean?

     Forgetting us means not offering us any new system software for years 
and years.

     Forgetting us means cancelling the last Apple II product from Apple 
Computer, Inc. with a press release, the Ethernet card.

     Forgetting us means not giving us a trade-in path of any kind to your 
currently made computer line.

     Forgetting us means not providing an Apple II emulator for the 
PowerMacintosh.  Many Apple II users would forgive the years of neglect 
that have been heaped on us if you provided us with at least this.

     Most of all, forgetting us means ignoring six million computers 
worldwide.  There are still more Apple IIs out there than PowerMacintoshes, 
by a factor of almost three to one.  We may not be as large a market as 
others, but we are steadfast, strong, and proud.  We will not forget how we 
have been treated, but we will forgive you when you remember us again.

     Happy birthday, Apple II.  We still love you.

     Apple Computer, Inc., don't forget us.  You may never have loved the 
II the way we do, and we will never forget how you treated it.  But we can 
still forgive.

Sincerely,

                 >>> GETTING CLUED IN ABOUT EACH OTHER <<<
                 """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This past week I've been spending time assembling text files for my 
world wide web page.  While doing so, I've spent time thinking about how 
little each one of us knows about each other.

     Truth is, most of us don't have a clue about each other.  Even people 
who I consider close friends continuously surprise me with interesting 
facets of their lives I had never known about before.  If these friends had 
set up personal web pages telling about themselves, I might have come to 
know them sooner and in greater depth.  I could have been clued in to who 
they were three years ago, rather than today.

     One fascinating aspect of the world wide web is that it offers the 
opportunity to shorten the time period involved in discovering background 
information about friends and colleagues.  By visiting a person's home page 
you can find a lot about who they are and what their interests are.

     Why is it important for people to be clued in about each other?  It's 
important because otherwise we could all pass through life without the 
slightest idea of what anybody else is doing.  This would be a shame 
because of the enormous number of missed opportunities for people to 
connect with one another.

     The reason that personal web pages are so interesting is that they 
allow us to better understand where each of us is coming from.  And the 
more you know about where a person is coming from, the better you'll be 
able to understand who they are as a person. 

     To be sure, human beings are multifaceted creatures.  For instance, I 
happen to have a strong interest in computers in education.  But I'm also 
very interested in video production, multiculturalism, philosophy, music, 
ethics, and special needs computing.  One of my strongest interests is in 
technology access issues.  I also try to follow developments in the arts, 
for the arts dignify the soul.

     My interests and hobbies are all laid out publicly on my web page.  
Interests and hobbies are a good starting point for constructing a personal 
web page.  But if your web page goes no further than a list of interests 
and hobbies, you're overlooking one of the best tools for letting others 
learn about you.  If you'd like others to gain a view into who you are as a 
person, you need to include copies of things you've written.  How you 
write, and what you choose to write about, reveal essential clues as to who 
you are as a person.

     On my own web page I've chosen to include copies of various articles 
I've written.  Reading these articles ought to give people a glimpse into 
how I think and what I value.

     I've also posted copies of some fictional children's stories I wrote 
for my elementary school students.  The stories I tell, and how I tell 
them, reveal more about me than possibly anything else on my web page.

     To help others learn more about what I think, I've posted copies of a 
few book reviews I've written in the past few years.  Anyone who reads 
these book reviews ought to gain a pretty good sense of how I think.  And 
how a person thinks cuts close to who they are as a person.

     To round out my home page, I thought it might be fun to include a 
little humor and mischief.  One section of my home page includes mock press 
releases and news stories.  What a person laughs at is yet one more clue as 
to who they are as a person.

     We live in a world where most of us pass thru life oblivious to our 
fellow travelers in time.  The world wide web is a powerful tool for making 
each one of us a little more informed about each other.

     So take time to learn who your fellow travelers are.  Take time to 
tell them who you are.  You may well be surprised at the opportunities that 
unfold as a result.

                       >>> SURFING WITHOUT A GUI <<<
                       """""""""""""""""""""""""""""
            Copyright 1995 by Al Fasoldt.  All rights reserved.

     The World Wide Web is a wonderful way to surf the Internet.  
Everybody knows you can't ride those Web waves without a modern graphical 
interface -- a GUI--such as the ones in Windows, OS/2, a fancy Unix system 
or the Mac, right?

     Not true.  You can hitch a ride from surf to shore any time you want 
to, without an icon or a window in sight.  All you need is the most basic 
telecommunications software.  Practically anything will do, as long as it 
has a setting for VT100 or VT102 emulation.

     And that means just about any computer can use the Web.  If your 
computer, no matter how old, is able to run a telecomm program that has a 
VT100 or VT102 option, you can join all the power users in cyberspace.

     You can do this by means of an Internet provider... a company that 
gives your computer access to the Internet through your telephone line... 
or by using a commercial online service that allows text-based connections.  
Ones that do not allow this kind of connection include America Online and 
Prodigy, which have their own graphical interface.  (In other words, you 
can't connect to either of them unless you have a computer that will run 
their special software.)

     GEnie is ideal for those who use a non-graphical interface when 
dialing into the service.  I tried out GEnie's text-based access to the 
World Wide Web to see how it worked.

     I ran an ordinary telecomm program and set it to VT102.  When GEnie's 
service answered, I typed INTERNET and then chose LYNX from a menu.  Lynx 
is the standard text-based Web browser for Internet sites (it makes use of 
Web links--get it?) and is very easy to use.

     A menu at the bottom of the screen is always visible.  It tells you 
how to move from one Web page to the next, how to go to another Web 
address, how to move from link to link, and so on.  Links are shown in 
boldface type, and you go from one to another by pressing the tab key or 
one of the arrow keys.

     The good news about Lynx is that it is fast.  I'd say it's about 
three times as fast in displaying Web pages as a graphical Web browser is.  
That's no surprise, since Lynx doesn't have to deal with pictures.  (You 
can speed up your graphical Web browser the same way by turning off the 
pictures.)

     The bad news is obvious.  You can't view Web pages the way they were 
designed to be seen, full of pictures and logos and big and small type.  
You just see text, all the same size.

     But that doesn't mean you can't view the pictures.  If a picture on a 
Web page is downloadable... if--if the way the page is set up allows 
this--you can press one key and have the picture sent to your computer.  If 
you're running a multitasking computer, you can then view the picture using 
another program that's running at the same time, or you can view it later.

     It's a little kludgy, perhaps.  But it works.

     Access to the Internet through GEnie was much speedier when I tried 
it recently than it was a few months ago.  GEnie is doing a good job of 
upgrading its own software and hardware.  It was also cheaper, because 
GEnie has dropped all extra charges for most high-speed connections.  
There's no extra charge for Internet access, either.

     An Internet access service is a better way to connect for serious 
surfers.  You'd pay less per month if you're online for many hours a week.  
But a commercial service that allows text-based Web browsing can be ideal 
for anyone who uses the Web only occasionally--and who does not care to 
make the move to a graphical operating system or an entirely new computer 
just to get out into cybersurf now and then.

     Give it a try.  The surf's up and the water's fine.

                          """""""""""""""""""""""

     As I told you last month, Charlie Hartley no longer has the time in 
his schedule for this column, which sorts out the wheat in the A2 library 
from the chaff.  I'll be writing it until I find someone to take the job 
on!  (I hate to use threats, but it's the truth, folks. <grin>)

     When you're telecommunicating, it's often easy to forget that the 
names you see of people leaving messages are attached to real, life people.  
Fortunately, there are lots of pictures of these people in the A2 
libraries.  (If you'd like your picture to appear in the libraries, E-mail 
me about where to send a photo and I'll digitize it for you.)  We have our 
very own "rogue's gallery".

     You can find most of these pictures for yourself just by searching on 
the keywords "a2user" or "userpic", but you'll miss a few as well.  This 
list contains 77 pictures I found by combing through the libraries.  To 
make the list more useful, I've included cross-references, which tell you 
where you can find more pictures of the same individual.

     Some of these pictures are in IIgs format, but quite a lot of them 
are in GIF format, which means you can view them on any Apple II.  
(Actually, there's a utility that will let you view IIgs format pictures on 
8-bit Apple II computers, but that's a subject for another column.)

     Do your feet start to hurt after you've been gazing at the pictures 
in an art gallery or museum for more than five minutes?  Mine sure do.  
That's why it's nice that you don't have to suffer like that to download 
these pictures.  However, since there are 77 pictures, I won't be 
describing them in any detail.  We've got a lot to see, so let's get to it.

October 1995 Report
"""""""""""""""""""
by David R. Kerwood
        [D.KERWOOD]



     The mission of the Planetary Apple User's Group (PAUG) is to serve as 
the online heart of the worldwide Apple II Community.  PAUG's goals include 
providing help and support for folks who may not have a local group nearby, 
and to create a virtual link between both the online and offline user group 
community.  PAUG sponsorship of an online user group is focused on 
promoting the fact that the Apple II is still alive, and doing very well.

     There _is_ support; PAUG can provide it, or help you find it!  We 
meet the third Sunday of every month at 7:00 pm Eastern in the Apple II 
RoundTable Real-Time Conference area.  With no dues to pay or miles to 
drive, PAUG offers the Apple II user a friendly and comfortable association 
with others with similar computing interests, plenty of accurate 
information, hints, tips, and the security that comes with knowing that you 
have all the computing support you could possibly need right at your 
fingertips.  What could be more convenient?

THE MAIN EVENTS   Of course the main event in September was the monthly 
"""""""""""""""   PAUG online meeting, held in the Apple II RoundTable
Real-Time Conference area on GEnie. The theme of the meeting was Going Back 
to School with the Apple II, and there were some interesting discussions on 
using some of the latest hardware and software for the Apple II in a school 
environment, as well as hint and tips for using our all time favorite 
applications.

     First among these was an online evaluation of the utility of 
Sequential Systems' Second Sight video card for the IIgs and IIe in a 
school environment.  The accessibility and clarity of gif images on both 
the standard RGB monitor and a VGA or Super VGA was already well known to 
those attending, which in turn prompted discussions on text displays and 
for large screen projection in a classroom setting.  The consensus was that 
the quality of text screens far exceeds anything now available for any 
Apple II, with the possible exception of Phil Shapiro's Big Text Machine 
application for displaying really large text screens.  The flexibility of 
an Apple IIe or IIgs for large overhead displays would be apparent with 
either an LCD overhead projector or display imager (such as the popular 
Proxima Desktop Projectors) connected to the VGA output of the Second Sight 
card, and the standard Apple RGB or composite monitor connected to the CPU.  
The IIgs or IIe would then be capable of driving the two displays 
simultaneously, which would be a real asset in a large room or lab.  In 
fact, with this setup, a IIgs could easily drive _three_ monitors, those 
being the IIgs RGB monitor connected to the IIgs video port, a composite 
monitor connected to the composite video port (also standard on the IIgs), 
and the large display connected to a Second Sight card.

     If you were interested in really pushing the envelope, the addition 
of an Apple II Video Overlay Card (which has both RGB and composite video 
out connectors) on a ROM 3 machine (or a suitably modified ROM 01 machine) 
plus Second Sight would allow at least two more monitors to be jacked into 
a IIgs or IIe.  So as you can see, the possibilities are limited only by 
your own imagination and your budget.

     Some useful hints and tips were also discussed.  Again, on the 
subject of monitors, one individual with a couple of IIc's "gathering dust" 
was wondering how he could test if they really worked, but did not have any 
monitor to connect them to (a personal computer without a display being 
about as useful as a car without wheels).  He was reminded that the IIc can 
be directly connected to the RCA connector on a VCR, and then to a TV, and 
you can get a good enough display on a TV to see if the computer can 
actually do something.

     The Apple II in the classroom was also praised as being one of the 
most appropriate platforms for teaching basic keyboarding skills, one of 
those entry-level techniques that many of us now take for granted.  Any 
Apple II running the excellent application Computer Keyboarding 5 (by the 
Apple II RoundTable staffer Charlie Hartley) is a perfect setup for 
teaching entry level keyboarding skills, either to children or to adults.

     Conversely, one of the meeting participants pointed out the fact that 
using the Apple II to allow students to express themselves creatively seems 
to have been forgotten by many educators, at least in his experience.  
Perhaps as a side effect of a lot of the very expensive hardware and 
software that many school systems seem to be enamored of these days, it 
seemed to that individual that there were more and more instances of 
teachers not being willing to take their classes to his computer lab to do 
anything beyond basic keyboarding instruction.  It may be that the 
intimidation factor of fancy new hardware and software would be enough to 
discourage teachers from letting their students hammer away on the 
keyboard--particularly if they don't have the benefit of training that is 
necessary to comfortably utilize the latest personal computers (leaving all 
discussions of DOS/Windows machines vs. Macs vs. Apple IIs aside for now).

     So, as a reminder to the reader... put a child in front of an Apple 
II with a painting and drawing program presenting a blank screen in front 
of them, and let them go to work!  Watching a youngster create (or an 
"oldster", for that matter), now that is a magical thing!

     As a tool for educators, the Apple II running AppleWorks was still 
thought of as the teacher's number one assistant.  The new spreadsheet 
application from The Byte Works, Quick Click Calc, was also thought of so 
highly by one participant that he was going to see if Byte Works could 
produce a site license version of this very complete and versatile program.  
He was particularly enthusiastic about the graphing capabilities that QC 
Calc has built into it.

     Cindy Adams, the online host for the meeting, received some advice in 
turn on how to implement HyperStudio as a "front end" for her networked 
IIgs computers in a school computer lab.  What was unresolved was whether 
or not the network server needed to have a full network version of 
HyperStudio resident on the server's hard drive, or if individual run-time 
versions of HyperStudio would do the trick.  Cindy took her hints and tips 
and will investigate; if she's ever able to get it to work I'll report it 
in the next PAUG newsletter.  Stay tuned.
