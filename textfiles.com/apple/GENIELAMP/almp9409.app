READING GEnieLamp   GEnieLamp has incorporated a unique indexing system 
"""""""""""""""""   to help make reading the magazine easier.  To 
utilize this system, load GEnieLamp into any ASCII word processor or 
text editor.  In the index you will find the following example:

                   HUMOR ONLINE ............ [HUM]  
                    [*]GEnie Fun & Games.

     To read this article, set your find or search command to [HUM].  
If you want to scan all of the articles, search for [EOA].  [EOF] will 
take you to the last page, whereas [IDX] will bring you back to the 
index.

MESSAGE INFO   To make it easy for you to respond to messages 
""""""""""""   re-printed here in GEnieLamp, you will find all the 
information you need immediately following the message.  For example:

                    (SMITH, CAT6, TOP1, MSG:58/M475)
        _____________|   _____|__  _|___    |____ |_____________
       |Name of sender   CATegory  TOPic    Msg.#   Page number|

     In this example, to respond to Smith's message, log on to page 
475 enter the bulletin board and set CAT 6.  Enter your REPly in TOPic

Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



COME JOIN US ON GENIE   The A2 RoundTable is trying to make it very easy 
"""""""""""""""""""""   for those of you who don't already have a GEnie 
account to join us here.  To start with, America Online users who have been 
driven out into the snow can get a special deal (a $50 credit) when they 
sign up with GEnie.  They can get a special deal on ProTERM, Spectrum, or 
Talk is Cheap modem software.  And they can get a special deal on getting 
Co-Pilot, the offline message processor for the IIgs--for a limited time, 
you can download Co-Pilot free (once you have a GEnie account).

     If you're reading this copy of GEnieLamp A2 on the Internet, you'll 
be interested to know that you can telnet to GEnie via SprintNet.  Three 
caveats:

     o  you must already have a GEnie account;
     o  you must pay an extra $2/hour;
     o  you can't transfer files (the lines won't be 8-bit clear).

     If you'd like to try it out, type the following:
          telnet hermes.merit.edu

     You should see the following prompt:
          Which host?

     Answer:
          sprintnet-313171

     Then you should see the familiar GEnie prompt:
          U#=

     Follow GEnie's standard logon procedure.


ASCII ART BUGS THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED   A visually impaired user has lets us 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   know that the ASCII art in the 
various editions of GEnieLamp plays heck with his speech synthesis 
software.  For that reason, we've flagged the ASCII art in this issue with 
the phrases "ASCII ART BEGINS" and "ASCII ART ENDS".  These phrases are 
right-justified in the AppleWorks version of GEnieLamp A2.  (In the text 
version, the phrases have a bunch of spaces in front of them.)

     If you're visually impaired, let us know if the changes help.  If 
you're fully sighted and are distracted by the new phrases, please let us 
know that, too.

QUICKIE-C SHIPS...   As the matter of fact, we began shipping Quickie-C

...BUT EARLY BUYERS, PAY ATTENTION!   After checking the master 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   distribution disk against the files 
which should have been released, then reconstructing events, it was 
discovered that the first 35 or so Quickie-C packages were shipped with the 
wrong version of the QuickieC.NDA file!

     It seems that the disk copier found a problem with the original 
master.  The master disk was then rebuilt.  Apparently, due to a clerical 
error, a file from December of 1993 was used, and the copier faithfully 
reproduced a program with debugging code still in it!  In short, the 
QuickieC.NDA's shipped to date cannot possibly run.

     The master disk has been corrected.  Anyone experiencing difficulty 
running Quickie-C should contact Vitesse if they want to receive their 
corrected program disk by E-mail.  Otherwise, Vitesse will be mailing new 
disks to everyone affected by this error.

     The Quickie 3.2 applcation is not affected by this problem, so ONLY 
the QuickieC.NDA file needs to be replaced.  The NDA download will probably 
take about 10 minutes at 2400 BAUD.

     Our deepest apologies, and everyone will get their corrected programs 
as soon as possible.

APPLE II ENVY   A M*C friend of mine was over Sunday evening, and was 
"""""""""""""   kidding me about "get a _real_ computer."  Then he said 
he'd like to see the screen of my archaic machine.  So I obliged.  (heh 
heh)

     I showed him GEM running through ProTerm with AW.  He kept saying 
things like, "Hey, you can _append_ to the clipboard?!  I wish the M*C 
could do that."  After several of these outbursts ("Hey, that scrolls 
faster than my M*C.."), I suggested that he upgrade to a //e.  Suddenly he 
realized the things he'd been saying, and mumbled something about "The M*C 
will probably be able to do those things in the next upgrade..."   :)

     I'll verify this...

     Randy and I were roommates at ICONference.  I finally came in the 
second night after 1 am...ready to crash.  Randy appeared shortly after.  
Then we started talking, and talking, and talking...til 5am.  It was 
delightful, but I was beat.  He went to shower before sleep, so I 
gratefully crawled into bed.  When he returned (with a second wind) he 
continued talking till I feared I would doze off in the middle of something 
he was saying -- or worse, in the middle of something _I_ was saying.  We 
finally called it quits about 6:45, so he could rest up for his keynote 
speech at 9 am.  :)

PETER WATSON ANNOUNCES THAT HE HASN'T MOVED   Peter Watson, the author of

me to pass along an important message.

     It seems as if an Australian postal employee closed Peter's post

returned, with a stamped notice that said, "moved, left no forwarding 
address."

     If you mailed Peter a check for MS-DOS Utilities, and it was 
returned, please re-send it to the exact same address. Thanks...

SPLIT SCREENS IN APPLEWORKS GS   This may be common knowledge to everyone 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   but me, but I just found out that you CAN 
do horizontal & vertical split screens in the AWGS spreadsheet. I have 
mentioned to many people that one of the things that I really needed in a 
spreadsheet was the ability to scroll around without losing my row & column 
labels. I just found out that you can do this by choosing "Set Titles" in 
the menu.

     I feel really dumb for not having tried this choice, but I guess I 
just thought that that had to do with titles for the spreadsheet when it 
was printed out & didn't need that. However, no one ever told me that this 
choice worked to do what I wanted so maybe quite a few people don't know 
this. Anyway, I thought I'd expose my "duh - ness" just in case there's 
someone else like me reading this who has the same problem.

     BTW, although this is 1 feature that I _really_ need, it does not in 
any way diminish my enthusiasm for the new Quick Click Calc!  That 
spreadsheet, with better graphing, publish & subscribe, cell notes, and 
other features has fantastic capabilities!  If you haven't gotten it yet, 
and have any use for GUI spreadsheets, get it right away!

     My macros work fine with AppleTalk active -- as long as I launch AW4 
from ProSel-16 rather than Finder (and have applied the patch you provided 
to allow me to run UM with AT active).

     Simple question (with probably not-so-simple answer): What does 
ProSel-16 do that allows AW4/UltraMacros to work with AppleTalk? It seems 
to me that the answer to that question might help solve the problem of how 
to make UM work right regardless of how it was launched? Has anyone talked 
to Glen Bredon about this?
                 (D.CRUTCHER, CAT17, TOP14, MSG:254/M645;1)


...NO APPLEWORKS 6?   I like the spreadsheet idea, but the problem there is 
"""""""""""""""""""   lack of code space. We've maxed it out, and so even 
if there was ever an AW 6 (there won't be), the spreadsheet would be left 
alone. Remember that we're in essence writing modules that have to fit in 
about 35k of code space, regardless of how much desktop you have.

AMERICA ONLINE KICKS OUT APPLE II     |he following official messages are
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""     from AOL:

Dear Member   The members of America Online Apple II edition are the 
'''''''''''   foundation upon which the entire America Online service has 
been built.  Starting with the launch of the service as AppleLink Personal 
Edition in 1988, you have helped us build an online community that now 
numbers almost 1 million members.  I want to thank each of you for your 
contribution, your support and your feedback over the years.

     The computing industry has changed dramatically since those first 
days of online communications.  Apple Computer, Inc. has withdrawn from the 
Apple II business over the past few years.  Many major software vendors 
have stopped supporting the product over this time period.  We have been 
able to continue our support of our Apple II service so far by 
incorporating it into the America Online product.

     Now we find, with great regret, that we simply can no longer support 
the Apple II service.  It has become commercially impossible for us to 
properly maintain the product.  Many of you I'm sure have noticed a 
diminished level of product quality in the last few months.  Without 
technical support from the industry, we are not able to add new services, 
fix existing problems, or prevent new problems.  Therefore we have made the 
sad decision to discontinue the Apple II edition of America Online as of 
November 1, 1994. In the weeks leading up to this date features of the 
service you have used in the past may become unavailable or non-functional.

     We would like to thank each of you for your long and continued 
support and, if at all possible, keep you as part of our online community.

     If you now have the ability to use America Online on another 
operating system (PC-DOS, Windows or Macintosh) we invite you to convert 
your membership to one of these other systems.

     For details on the last month of service for the Apple II Edition of 
America Online, important dates and billing information, please read the 
other articles on this menu.

     We have enjoyed serving you and hope to continue to do so on one of 
our other platforms.

Sincerely,

Steve Case

REACTION TO AMERICA ONLINE'S PERFIDY   Since America Online has now 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   announced they will be terminating 
support of the Apple II on November 1, 1994, I would like to state the 
following:

     I will be keeping my America Online account at least until that date. 
Beyond that date, I may decide to cancel the account.  If for some reason 
you have the urge to email me as sheppy@aol.com, keep this in mind. 
Fortunately, I'm here on GEnie, and you're here on GEnie.

     But I AM disappointed by AOL's decision (but not surprised in the 
least -- just this morning, before this was announced, I predicted here on 
GEnie that precisely this would happen within the next few months).

     This was just an announcement of my intentions.  A similar notice 
will be posted on AOL tomorrow (they shut the system down for their Monday 
night maintenance before I could post it there tonight).

LIVEWIRE NOW AVAILABLE FOR IIGS   What is LiveWire
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   

     Well, it's an online magazine which covers what's going on around 
GEnie...at one time it was published on paper and snail-mailed to GEnie 
users, but now it's available in electronic form only.  For several months, 
they have been doing a multimedia version for Macs and PCs, but now they 
have a GS version. currently, it's only available in the software libary on 
page 20. (m20;3) it's the newest file in the library, (I forget the number) 
called LW9408.IIGS.SEA or something similar to that. Eventually, it will be 
on the page that lists the other versions, and hopefully it will eventually 
be on the A2 page. Note that page 20 is free...so don't worry about how 
long the download is, it doesn't cost anything to download LiveWire. (as 
long as you're not at 9600 baud, and you aren't using the 800# or 
surcharged node, and not in prime-time)

     I just heard about this today (Saturday) from one of the editors of 
LiveWire.
                   (T.BUCHHEIM, CAT2, TOP13, MSG: /M645;1)

>>>>>   Well, I've finally found my way in here and will try to be a more
"""""   regular presence.  The second issue is -- well -- lots better than 
the first, in my opinion.  The first was a bit rushed (to say the least), 
but I had more time on the second to assemble and polish things (little 
things like coloring the menu fonts and so on).  This extra time was thanks 
to Mary Trzyna for doing a great job on the graphic conversions and rushing 
them to me.  :)

     Anyhow, thanks for the positive comments.  Oh, and this issue does 
have a quit button (thanks, Gary).  It was something I never thought about 
until I finished the first issue and suddenly found myself wondering, 
"Ooops!  I don't know how to do that."  <grin>

     The October issue will utilize the fontload NBA, which Auri let me 
know about, and I feel suitably dumb for wishing for something that 
HyperStudio DID have. ;)  I apologize for any inconveniences with the 
fonts, and as of the October issue, these problems should disappear.  
Thanks, Auri.

     While I've used HyperStudio quite a bit in the past, I'm still 
learning (while trying to make the IIGS version of LiveWire as 
professional-looking as possible).  So any constructive criticism is 
welcome.

     As a side note, there were two issues of the IIGS LiveWire that 
weren't released (may they RIP), because I wasn't satisfied with the 
artwork conversions for either.  This was NOT Mary's fault (she did an 
admirable job), it was because the 640by200 resolution just didn't cut it 
graphically for the pictures.  The dithering just looked too dithered, and 
I personally don't care for dithering to begin with.

     June's issue proved to be more of just getting our feet wet, while I 
actually did manage to finish July's issue.  But after a bit of debating 
with myself, I decided not to release the July issue and to switch to the 
320by200 graphic mode predominantly.  My most outstanding problem was 
finding a good font, which the Apple RT staff helped me find in the Studio 
City font.

     The September issue will be available RSN.  Enjoy.

the land.  You must aid the inhabitants of Sosaria by slaying the evil 
Mondain.

or thief.  You may also adjust various characteristics including strength, 
agility, stamina, charisma, wisdom, and intelligence.  You may then enter 
the world of Sosaria, where you can interact with others, pick up and carry 
or examine objects, and combat beasts and monsters.

APPLE II ROUNDTABLES RENEW SUPPORT OF THE APPLE II   GENIE SERVICES, 1994 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   AUGUST 12 (A2) -- The 
Apple II RoundTables on GEnie (A2 and A2Pro) today annouced the next step 
in their growing support for the Apple II line of computers.  New 
announcements included: A special GEnie sign up deal for former Apple II 
AOL customers; and special deal on modem software arranged with all the 
major publishers of Apple II telecommunications programs for America Online 
users; the release of a new version of an Apple IIgs-specific offline 
navigator program for GEnie; and the assumption of the assignment of all 
official file types and all other types, codes, and IDs for the Apple II 
from Apple Computer, Inc.  All are just the start of the Apple II 
RoundTables' continuing drive to carry the torch of worldwide Apple II 
support into the next millennium and beyond.

     Starting immediately, all former America Online (AOL) Apple II users 
may sign up for GEnie under a special deal provided by the Apple II 
RoundTable which grants those users $50.00 worth of online credit during 
their first month online.  (Details below.)  AOL's support for their Apple 
II software will be ending on November 1st, 1994.

     At the same time, an improved version of CoPilot, an Apple 
IIgs-specific offline navigator program for GEnie, is being made available 
for as freeware to all Apple II users.  CoPilot v2.5 allows users to 
automate all of their online tasks on GEnie, saving them time, money, and 
effort.  When using CoPilot, all of the users' work is done offline, and 
the program then transfers all of their data to and from GEnie in the least 
amount of time possible.  This comes on the heals of the release of GEM 
4.22 last month, a similar navigator for 8-bit Apple II systems.

     Upon signing up for GEnie, all former AOL Apple II users will be 
eligible for a special deal provided by the Apple II RoundTable for reduced 
prices on the three most popular Apple II telecommunications programs:  
Spectrum for $65.00 (+$3.50 s&h), Talk is Cheap for $20.00 (s&h included), 
and ProTerm 3.1 for $45.00 (+$5.00 s&h). In addition, purchasers of the 
ProTerm package on this special deal with receive a free disk containing 
both Co-Pilot and GEM, the two most popular Apple II-based GEnie 
navigators.  (Details below.)

     Technical support of the Apple II line of computers on GEnie is 
growing as the Apple II RoundTables take over the official assignment of 
all Apple II file types, resource types, font IDs, sound codes, request 
codes, and all other similar types, codes, and IDs from Apple Computer, 
Inc.  All third party Apple II developers will now send their requests for 
assignments to the Apple II RoundTables, at the address 
A2PRO@genie.geis.com.  The technical support provided by the Apple II 
RoundTables is expected to grow with the publication of Apple II technical 
documents and additional third party developer assistance programs.

     "We are dedicated to providing worldwide online support for the Apple 
II line of computers for as long as Apple II computers exist," said Dean 
Esmay, president of Syndicomm, the company that runs all the Apple computer 
RoundTables on GEnie.  "These new offers and programs are just the start. 
While other online services are eliminating their Apple II support or 
allowing them to languish, we are continuing to increase our support.  
We're even hard at work on a full-blown graphical front end, which we hope 
to have available by the end of 1994." he added.

     Established in 1985, GEnie Services is one of the fastest growing 
online information services in the country.  GEnie is offered by GE 
Information Services (GEIS), a division of General Electric Co., USA.  
GEnie and GEIS are headquartered in Rockville, Maryland.

QUICK CLICK DATA?   Databases seem to be a popular item, so I'm going to
"""""""""""""""""   give you some first impressions about them and look for 
some opinions.

     First, the idea of doing a text database on an Apple IIGS leaves me 
cold.  It would take a lot of convincing to get me to even consider this.

     Beyond that, there seem to be two distinct kinds of databases to fill 
two distinct kinds of need.

     One kind is a full programmable database.  These programs, like 4th 
Dimension, are really specialized programming languages, not user-oriented 
databases.  Right from the box, it would be difficult for the average user 
of, say, AppleWorks GS to do anything useful with such a program. 
Developing a useful programmable database would be a long, expensive 
project that would be useful to a relatively small number of people, so the 
price would have to reflect that.  I doubt I will do one like this, but you 
can convince me otherwise.

     Another kind of database is the user database, like the one in 
AppleWorks GS.  AppleWorks GS doesn't carry things as far as they can go 
with this sort of design.  (That's not a criticism; AppleWorks GS is a 
useful program as it stands.)  This is what I'd be most likely to do.  So, 
start with what you see in AWGS and add the following:

     1.  More flexible selection rules.
     2.  More extensive field search rules.
     3.  Publish & Subscribe.
     4.  Encryption.
     5.  Better display of records, allowing free-format "cards" for the 
         records that allow you to move, resize & color fields more or less 
         like a CAD program.
     6.  Ability to include non-text data, like digital recordings, 
         pictures, movies.
     7.  Printing rules that allow formatted records to be printed in a 
         variety of layouts.  Thing of this:  Create a picture on a small 
         card, and add name & address fields.  Plop them down on a page & 
         print.  You get a page of mailing labels with a logo.

     I think something like this is reasonable to develop, can be sold for 
under $100, and, I hope, would have a wide appeal.  I'd like to hear your 
opinions, though.

QUICK CLICK WORD?   There seems to be a lot of talk about word processing.
"""""""""""""""""   It ranges from people who basically want EGO Ed with 
multiple rulers to folks who want Microsoft Word or Word Perfect for the 
GS--and they want it for less that $100, too.  :)

     My intent with the Quick Click Calc series is to produce a line of 
software which is a step above the kind of software you find in intergrated 
applications like AWGS or Microsoft Works 3.0.  All will work with each 
other, and all will support The Manager.  I have no current plans to create 
an integrated application, nor do I particularly think that's needed as 
long as The Manager works well with the applications.

     With these things in mind, assuming I do a word processor, here's 
some of the features you folks mentioned (and a few you didn't) that I 
would be likeky to include:

     Full support for the Apple desktop metaphor
     Selection of any font, color, size or style
     Insert pictures
     Insert movies
     Support speech
     Support subscribe to QCCalc
     Multiple columns
     Headers & Footers
     Index generation
     Table of contents generation
     Sections (these allow multiple formats on the same page; sort of a 
          poor-man's page layout)
     Print preview
     Spell checker
     Multiple rulers
     Footnotes
     Imorting a few formats (Not AWGS--they don't know what their own 
          formats are!)
     Exporting through a few standard formats
     Encryption
     Print merge with a QC Database
     Jsutification & tabs, various kinds, via rulers
     Split screen
     Character/Word/Line/Paragraph counts

Here are some things I almost certainly would not include:

     Macro language
     Thesaurus
     Importing for every format under the sun
     Grammar checker
     Outliner
     Built-in graphics editor

So, given that list, would you:

     1. I'm not interested in a word processor--write something I care 
        about!  (Name it.)

     2. I want a word processor, but this doesn't fill my needs.

     3. I'd probably buy it, but I really want Microsoft Word, and I still 
        want it for under $100.

     4. This is great--where do I sent the check?

(Street price for _all_ Quick Click programs is <$100.)

MONITOR STYMIES LUGGABLE IIGS   It's not that the line is _that_ long....  
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   I can't build any more in the Otrona case 
unless you don't care about the monitor.  I have no more 4" composite 
monitors.  Havn't been able to find anymore.  That is the only size PCB 
that will fit in there.  (the area for the monitor PCB to fit is about 3.5" 
x 6" or so.)  Thats it.

     Now... if you want to use (and you have) an item such as a Kaypro or 
Compaq type case, I can help you.  Otherwise, if you (Joe) look around up 
there for a 4" open frame type, +12VDC Composite input monitor assembly, I 
can help you get one built.  (Using the Otrona case, I have one here)

     The hardware needed to build one of these is as follows:

     IIgs CPU with:

     InnerDrive (This becomes the power supply) (A Vulcan will do, but I 
                like the AI P/S better, no heat sinks to worry about 
                mounting, and it's lasted me since Joe saw it so it must be 
                suitable!)

     SCSI Card, preferably a RAMFast Rev D, (Size is the main factor, 
                allthough I have an Apple High Speed SCSI)

     RAM Card. 4 Meg, since your not going to want to go inside there too 
                much just go for the gusto and get it over with.  It needs 
                to be a small type card.  AE GS RAM III is the best, but 
                also most expensive in a 4 meg configuration.  Also good is 
                the Harris Labs GS Sauce & Pacemark (Q-RAM) GS RAM SIMM 
                card.  The GS Sauce is actually to long, but because it's a 
                low profile card, it fits.  The Sequentail Systems RAM GS 
                misses by 1/8th an inch in the Otrona case.  I actually had 
                the OctoRAM in there for a while, but the thing blocked 
                slot 7 because I had to bend the card out of the way.  The 
                Sequential card did the same thing when used with the 
                Otrona case.  If a Compaq/Kaypro box is used the RAM & SCSI 
                card size limitation isn't as bad. 

     Hard Disk: It will need to be an Quantum ELS or similar variety.  A 
                2.5" drive will work even better!  No full size 3.5" drives 
                or old types should be used, as the heat generated will 
                probably cause some trouble. 

3.5" External Drive & a Mac II fSE/II Floppy mounting bracket.  (I've got 
                plenty of the brackets. A PS/2 Faceplate is optional)  The 
                drives LED and eject swith will be used in the assembly.

     Misc Descrete items:

     12" of ribbon cable (25 pin or more) rubber feet, a few sizes, about 
20 are needed.  These are the "bailing" wire for the entire operation. 
Spacers, DB 25 Male and Female crimp connectors, wire ties, 6/32 screws, 
etc. and about 10 fiberglass cutwheels for the Dremil.

     If you wish a "matching" keyboard, one will have to be sacraficed to 
the Dremil, as the numeric keypad will have to get chopped off if it is to 
fit on the front. 

     Of course, there is more.  A well stocked PC/CLone shop is a handy 
thing to have nearby when you attempt things like this, as they are an 
invaluable source for things like rubber feet and spacers/stanoffs and 
other Tiwanese made small parts that you just couldn't do without. :)

     Using an Osborne case is out of the question.  The way the thing 
holds itself together prohibits cutting into the frame, and without doing 
this you would not be able to have any cards installed. 

     Thats about it.  If you have either a 4" composite monitor. (even if 
the ttube is broken, the PCB is all I need, I have CRTs) or a Compaq/Kaypro 
case you want to use, (I can use the 9" monitor I mentioned earlier in 
those we can get started on making anyone who wants one their very own).  
Of course, Joe is first. :)

     BTW:  The monitor type, to be a little more specific, they are 
usually a small metal frame assy, and the PCB has a 10 pin edge connector.  
The common variety are TTL input.  Some will take a 75 ohm composite 
signal.  Thats the kind I need.  The TTL one won't work.  Unless someone 
has a  small circut (one IC) that will convert composite to TTL.  I tried a 
few various chips and wasn't able to get it to work with desirable results.

DESK ACCESSORY SPELL CHECKER?   Keep the faith on an NDA spellchecker from 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Softdisk. The "shuffling/departure of 
programmers" hasn't affected this (except possibly to delay it a bit).  If 
anything, you're more likely to get the finished product in the future than 
you have been for the past year and a half (because some with the departure 
of every programmer, you must remember that a new programmer has come in; 
and all I'll say is, that isn't necessarily a bad thing... :)

PARKHURST MICRO PRODUCTS' PMPFAX SOFTWARE   As the name implies, this new 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   topic will be used to talk 
about what you people would like to see in a send/receive fax package for 
the Apple IIGS.  I'm currently working on a package right now, so it would 
be a great time to give me suggestions before I'm finished.  Since I don't 
have a lot of experience actually using fax software on other platforms, 
let me know what features you liked in other software packages and what 
features you maybe *haven't* seen that you'd like in this package.

     Since I've only been working on this for less than a week, there's no 
finally release date, price, or availability information, since nothing as 
of now actually exists.  :)  But I really do need your input, so let me 
know what you'd like.

     Currently, I'm going to be including the following:  send/receive, 
support for class 1 and 2 (and possibly 2.0 if I can find the specs), fax 
log and phone directory, user-created cover sheet (give me some suggestions 
as to how you'd like this implemented), executed as a control panel and/or 
NDA, will patch the Print Manager to allow you to "print" faxes from any 
application that uses the Print Manager...

     Please continue along with the suggestions.  Also, if anyone has 
actually programmed an application that talks to G3/Class 1 fax modems, I'm 
always open to advice...  :)

Paul                  (PMP, CAT38, TOP15, MSG:1/M645;1)

<<<<<   Well, so far, all I've gotten finished is the Class 1 driver. Class
"""""   2 isn't standard, and Class 2.0 has just come out.

     Fax polling should be pretty simple, as will passwords and the like. 
What I thought instead of a "Fax" printer driver, would be to just patch 
the Print Manager directly and give you the ability to fax or print, no 
matter what printer driver you happen to be using.  This would be easier 
than having to go into the control panel and change your printer to "fax" 
and have to redo all of your pages and such to conform to whatever paper 
sizes I'd have to include in the driver, etc.  I've already done part of 
this and I can get ahold of the print record and other information so it 
shouldn't be that big of a deal.

     One other thing... how would you like fax receive to work?  Should it 
be a self-starting CDev when working in the desktop?  That is, when it 
hears the phone ring, it will automatically bring up a system window and 
try to answer the fax.  I could try to have it work entirely in the 
background, but timing with faxes is sometimes critical.

     Any more thoughts, let me know...

Paul                  (PMP, CAT38, TOP15, MSG:5/M645;1)

<<<<<   So far, I've got my GS sending class 1 faxes.  I've been spending
"""""   my time on the desktop interface, so the PMPFax CDev will now save 
print jobs to disk (so I can later send them).  My next step will be to get 
the send program working with the new document format (I was sending PIC 
files just to get my routines down, so now I'll have to modify the program 
to send Apple Preferred files).

     I was planning on having a polling option so you can call up fax 
depositories and the like, as well as having timed fax sends and the like. 
Any other ideas, just keep 'em coming....  :)

CONTACTS GS   I have some good news and some weird news to report about 
"""""""""""   Contacts GS, and its imminent re-release.  First the weird 
news...

     As you remember, when last we spoke about Contacts GS, I'd 
commissioned Will Nelken to create TimeOut Modules for use with importing 
and exporting the Contacts GS data file back and forth between Contacts and 
AppleWorks Classic.

     I guess you could say that I've been the beta-tester for the TimeOut 
Modules, and it has not been a fun summer.  As soon as Will generated some 
new code, I could promptly "break it."  It seemed as if we were making no 
progress, until a very weird thing happened this past Friday.

     Will is developing 3 different versions of the TimeOut modules.  I 
tried testing out the version that works with AppleWorks v3 and UltraMacros 
4, and realized that I'd better install UltraMacros first.  Try as I might, 
I couldn't.  The Installer kept crashing.

     Quite odd, I thought.

     So, I called Quality on Friday, and a duplicate set of UM4 disks 
arrived today.  I decided to not only install UM4 onto AW3, but to go back 
and re-install it on AW 4.0.2.  I did.

     Now, for the good news....

     B-I-N-G-O !!

     I discovered that TimeOut ContactsMover works just fine.

     There's just one minor tweak to the AppleWorks 3.0/ UM 3.x version, 
and then the Contacts GS package will be completed.

     I'm breathing a whole lot easier.

     And, so is my copy of AppleWorks v4.0.2.  Strange error messages that 
I've been seeing for months have magically disappeared.

     Apparently, the copy of UltraMacros that I purchased last December 
was the cause of all my AppleWorks v4.x problems.  Unbelievable!  Who would 
have ever imagined? Did I ever verify the UM disk?  No.

Joe Kohn           (JOE.KOHN, CAT28, TOP5, MSG:49/M645;1)


...AND TIMEOUT CONTACTSMOVER   What Will Nelken has done is to create 3 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   totally different versions of TimeOut 
ContactsMover.  Depending on which version of AppleWorks you are using will 
determine which version of ContactsMover you'd install.

     I guess that you could say that we are operating under the assumption 
that not everyone has upgraded AppleWorks to v4.x, and we wanted to provide 
support for those still using AppleWorks v3.0.

     So, 2 of the versions of TimeOut ContactsMover are actually for use 
with AppleWorks v3.0. One version supports UltraMacros 3.x, while the 
secord version supports UltraMacros 4.x.  To use either of those with 
AppleWorks v3.0 does require that you own UltraMacros.

     The TimeOut ContactsMover version for AppleWorks v4.x requires 
nothing extra, as AppleWorks v4.x already has an UltraMacros "player" built 
in to the system.

     TimeOut ContactsMover moves data back and forth between AppleWorks 
and Contacts GS; it's a 2 way street.  If you currently maintain an 
AppleWorks name & address database, you can use TimeOut ContactsMover to 
automatically convert that database into a format that is instantly 
recognizable by the Contacts NDA.  It does everything for you, including 
saving your newly created Contacts data file in the proper sub-directory.

     On the "other side of the 2 way street", TimeOut ContactsMover will 
convert your already existing Contacts data file into an AppleWorks 
database, and from there, you can easily generate mailing labels, reports, 
lists, etc.

     TimeOut ContactsMover makes Contacts GS a much more flexible program.

     What Will Nelken has created in TimeOut ContactsMover is quite 
impressive and quite flexible.  Using it, you can not only create a brand 
new Contacts GS data file, but you can even append the one you already 
have, all from right within AppleWorks.  And, it does it right before your 
eyes.  Quickly and effortlessly.

     Using Contacts GS data with other programs is not restricted to 
AppleWorks Classic.  You can seamlessly and easily load all the Contacts GS 
data, for example, into Addressed For Success, DB Master, or any word 
processing program of your choosing.

     The above should not be construed in any way to mean that you need to 
own AppleWorks or Addressed For Success to get great value from the 
Contacts GS New Desk Accessory.  In and of itself, Contacts GS is a 
stand-alone product (well, as "stand-alone" as a New Desk Accessory can 
be).  As a name and address database in New Desk Accessory format, it's 
quite convenient and handy.  As an example, I'm typing this off-line using 
Co-Pilot, and I can easily access Contacts GS right this second from the 
Apple Pull Down Menu, and find out if *you* are a SSII subscriber.

     As I said way-back-when, Contacts GS is my first software publishing 
venture, and I just wanted to "do it right."  I wanted to add as much value 
and utility and functionality as was possible.  Did Contacts GS need 
TimeOut ContactsMover?  No.  Does TimeOut ContactsMover add value and 
utility and functionality to Contacts GS?  Absolutely.

Greetings Dan,

     In reference to your friend on AOL who is intimidated by 
GEnie...She's right!  GEnie is much less user friendly than AOL or Delphi.  
I'm looking at a stack of papers next to my computer that explain how to 
get around GEnie.  26 pages to learn CoPilot navigator.  23 pages from 
Category 1 explaining how GEnie the Apple Bulletin Board is set up.  26 
pages from Category 1 for new users on how to get around the Apple area of 
GEnie.  67 pages of the GEnie Manual for Apple II Users.

     GEnie is EXTREMELY INTIMIDATING for the average computer user that 
doesn't know the online language of bulletin boards, online services, etc. 
"User Friendly" GEnie is not (in terms of ease of navigation).  I much 
prefer a GUI type of interface that I can point and click.

     There are only 2 ways your friend will use GEnie.

               (1) You sit down and show them how to navigate.  Not once 
                   but several times.

               (2) When AOL folds and they default to GEnie.  I don't know 
                   about Compuserve but Delphi is much easier to navigate.

     I've been lurking in GEnie for a long time trying to get the hang of 
it.  I've found people online in general are the high end users who feel 
comfortable with this medium.  I (as is your friend) am not one of those 
people.

     I left Delphi and came to GEnie because I really like my GS.  I'm 
just a beginner who didn't need access to Internet because it's big, 
complex, and was too much at once.

     The "PEOPLE" on GEnie are much more user friendly than Delphi.  They 
love the Apple II and are quick with an answer, even if their awswers are 
over my head.

     When I was on Delphi, there was a guy named Chuck Orem who could 
shift down and tell me too: ...turn the knob right, OK click the mouse, 
yes...now pull down the file menu...and all this while we were online, 
don't know how he did it?  He also had me call his home if I didn't 
understand.  If your friend can find someone on GEnie to do that they will 
be here for life.

     Sorry for the long post but I can really empathize with your friend, 
I'm a cement head among A+ students that are very sincere about helping me 
but forget that I don't know their language (computer-eze).

     If your friend wants some help navigating GEnie, drop me an e-mail 
note and I'll walk them through the steps as far as a beginner can over the 
phone or via GEnie.  My e-mail address is M.JAMES10.  I'd rather not post 
my phone #.  Wish I had someone willing to do that when I started at GEnie. 
THAT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT THING TO POST ON PAGE 645!!  Need a GEnie 
mentor?  Type # 23 and someone will contact you by voice phone, cool.

    While on GEnie,  do  you spend most of your time  downloading files?
If so, you may be missing out some excellent information in the Bulletin
Board  area.   The messages  listed above  only scratch  the surface  of
what's available and waiting for you in the bulletin board area.

    If you are serious about your Apple II, the GEnieLamp staff strongly
urge  you to give the  bulletin board area a try.   There are  literally
thousands  of messages  posted  from people  like you from  all over the
world.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, DC
                  APRIL 1, 2006

     The Federal Telecommunications Bureau has just released a new set of 
guidelines that establishes nationwide norms for electronic mail 
communications.

     Effective immediately, two new governmental departments are being 
formed to combat abuses involving online communications:  The Department of 
Grammar Abuse and The Department of Typographical Errors.

     Beginning early next year, government agents will start monitoring 
all online electronic mail correspondance, and will prosecute all United 
States citizens who include grammatical and/or typographical errors in 
their "private" correspondance.

     The Government of the United States will no longer stand for its 
citizens to commit crimes against the English language.  The first 
infraction will be dealt with harshly.  Those who commit grammar crimes 
will be tortured--their computer equipment will be seized and replaced with 
aging and obsolete PowerPC's computers from Apple Computer Inc, the 
Taiwanese company that currently produces computerized kitchen utensils.  
(Note:  Prior to The Great Takeover of 1995, Apple manufactured the poorly 
made and highly unpopular PowerPC computers.)

     A second offense will result in imprisonment at the Federal Grammar 
Improvement Center.

     Third time offenders will be treated much more harshly.  They will be 
imprisoned and forced to watch non-stop re-runs of "The John Sculley Comedy 
Hour" TV show that aired briefly in late 1997.

     In a joint statment issued to the press, President Amy Carter and 
Vice-President Chelsea Clinton said, "The time has come for us to put aside 
personal and individual freedoms in the quest for better grammar!"

                      DOING BUSINESS ON THE INTERNET:
       HOW THE ELECTRONIC HIGHWAY IS TRANSFORMING AMERICAN COMPANIES
       """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
                             by Mary J. Cronin

(308 pages, softcover)

Publication date:  1994

       Publisher:  Van Nostrand Reinhold
                   115 Fifth Ave.
                   New York, NY  10003

            ISBN:  0-442-01770-7

           Price:  $29.95


     Walk into any bookstore and you're bound to find a shelf with at 
least a dozen books covering the subject of business management and 
efficiency.  Nearby you'll find a shelf overflowing with new books about 
the Internet.

     Until now these two shelves of books had little in common. "Doing 
Business on the Internet" is the first book to link these two related 
topics.

     The author of the book, Mary J. Cronin, works as the university 
librarian at Boston College, and teaches information management at Boston 
College School of Management.  She brings to the subject the well-informed 
mind of a librarian, tempered with the pragmatism of someone closely 
familiar with real-world business practices.

     The result is a book that is highly readable, yet meticulously 
referenced and footnoted.  "Doing Business on the Internet" is must reading 
for information managers in companies large and small.  The book also has 
an audience with persons who have a general interest in the socio-dynamics 
of online communications.


The Nature and Scope of the Book   "Doing Business on the Internet" was 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   written to persuade as well as describe.  
The heart of this tome is a series of case studies describing how companies 
are using the Internet.  To assemble these case studies, Cronin visited and 
communicated with information managers known for evangelizing the benefits 
of Internet connection within their companies.  She then conducted 
follow-up interviews via electronic mail.  The results of her 
investigations are assembled with an aim to persuade as well as describe.

     To persuade what?  To persuade businesspeople that a whole slew of 
unforeseeable benefits can arise by connecting their employees to the 
Internet.

     The central thesis of this book is aptly illustrated in the section 
where Cronin explains how IBM was at first reluctant to offer Internet 
access to its employees.  You would think that a behemoth computer company 
would be the first to comprehend the benefits of Internet access.  Not so. 
Until a few years ago the prevailing attitude at IBM was that everything 
that IBM employees needed to know could be found on IBM's internal company 
networks.

     These days IBM managers have arrived at the more enlightened point of 
view that there may be times where valuable information and ideas could 
possibly exists outside IBM's internal company networks.  In those rare 
instances, it could be useful for IBM employees to conduct searches on the 
Internet.


Information as the Fundamental Building Block of Business   Cronin starts 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   with the basic 
principle that, "information is the fundamental building block of any type 
of product or service."   She then goes on to discuss how information can 
provide a crucial competitive advantage:  "Executives have long recognized 
the importance of information for competitive advantage....  In order to 
make better decisions, chief executives and top level managers require 
fresh information about trends in the economy and the marketplace, about 
the activities of competitors, new developments in technology, and new 
product opportunities."

     In the information age, to be informed is to be armed with knowledge. 
 And a primary way of becoming informed these days--is to be connected to 
the Internet.


Improved Communications with Customers   The Internet offers more than 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   information and ideas, though.  
The net can help forge new ties between customers and companies.  Since the 
cost of sending electronic mail is far less expensive than the cost of a 
phone call or letter, companies can use e-mail to communicate regularly 
with prospective customers as well as with established customers.  Indeed, 
companies can set themselves apart from their competitors by making it a 
practice to respond promptly and thoughtfully to "external e-mail."  In 
Cronin's words:  "If a company decides to distinguish itself through the 
quality of its customer service organization, the network can be a decisive 
asset in achieving this goal."

     Of course, communicating with customers is a two way street. 
Customers benefit by getting answers to their questions.  But companies 
also benefit by getting speedy feedback about their products or services.  
The Internet provides a new type of "intimacy" between company and 
consumer.  In a very real sense, the Internet can help establish bonds of 
cross-loyalty of a new order.  While some companies may cringe at the 
invariable "closeness of contact" that results, Cronin astutely observes: 
"Getting closer to the customer is probably one of the most important 
benefits of using the network."


Computer-Assisted Journalism   Manufacturing sector companies are not the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   only ones to benefit from closer customer 
contact.  News providers are also reaching out for closer contact with 
customers.  Cronin tells how The Boston Globe newspaper has started a 
regular column on electronic communications, and regularly includes the 
newspapers' Internet address to solicit reader feedback. Journalists can 
then get direct and immediate feedback to their stories. And the 
journalists themselves can use such feedback to become better informed 
about happenings in their local community.

     Along similar lines, the Washington Post newspaper has initiated a 
regular column covering oddities on the Internet.  This same newspaper has 
taken to including the Internet address of reporters at the end of 
articles.  USA Today currently accepts letters to the editor via Internet 
electronic mail.  (Internet address: usatoday@clark.net)

     Cronin goes on to tell about a radio station in San Francisco, KKSF, 
that has set up a gopher on the Internet.  Listeners of this station can 
access a playlist of songs on the gopher.  Should these listeners get the 
urge to purchase any of the music being played, they can quickly and easily 
obtain information about the location of record stores that carry KKSF 
music.


Using the Internet to Promote Science and Research   In a chapter titled 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   "Transforming Research 
and Development," Cronin explains the immense benefits offered by the 
Internet to scientists and researchers:  "For the millions of researchers 
connected to the Internet, the communication power of the network has 
transformed the nature of their work."  Naturally, the benefits that accrue 
to researchers often yield ancillary commercial benefits as well.

     Two specific types of scientific collaboration on the Internet are 
examined in this chapter:  improving medical diagnosis through computer 
imaging, and using the power of supercomputers to help locate untapped oil 
reserves.

     Cronin relates how the net helps doctors and researchers perform 
medical imaging from the data output of MR (magnetic resonance) and CT 
(computer tomography) scanners.  Medical researchers can make use of remote 
supercomputer data crunching resources, saving the researchers the burden 
of having to purchase a dedicated supercomputer for their own use.

     In a similar type of computer application, geologists and 
oceanographers are using the power of supercomputers on the Internet to 
help them locate possible undersea petroleum reserves.  Gathering data 
about the possible location of such reserves is the easy part.  Analyzing 
the data using computer models is the processor-intensive part.


Overseas Uses of the Internet   Few people realize the true international 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   scope of the Internet.  While it's true 
that the Internet had its origins here in the United States, today the net 
has extended its tentacles to almost every continent.

     To help readers gain an appreciation of how the Internet is being 
used overseas, Cronin relates anecdotes of how businesses in Singapore are 
using the net:

     "Singapore provides an interesting example of competing through 
connectivity--and the dynamic relationship between policy, commerce, and 
technology in the global village.  Singapore promotes itself as the 
'Intelligent Island,' and its National Computer Board has adopted a plan 
called IT2000 to transform Singapore into the information technology 
capital of Asia.  Government agencies make every effort to smooth the way 
of multinational corporations wishing to use Singapore as a communication 
hub for the twenty-first century."


Empowering Individuals Within Companies   Connecting to the Internet can 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   empower companies as a whole, as 
well as empowering individuals within companies.  Cronin cites the example 
of Apple Computer's Steve Cisler, whose informative postings pop up 
regularly on many Internet discussion lists:  "Steve Cisler, another active 
Internet participant, shares information on the Internet through detailed 
meeting reports and informative postings to discussion lists."

     Cisler, a senior scientist at the Apple Library, Apple's corporate 
library, regularly summarizes meetings and happenings in the 
technology/information science field.  He also makes it a practice to help 
disseminate information on the growing freenet movement taking place around 
the world.

     For Cisler, his computer's keyboard serves as his printing press.  
The Internet serves as an accessible and cost-free tool for disseminating 
his writings instantly around the world.

     Interestingly enough, Cisler's Internet postings are often imbued 
with a public spirit.  Apple Computer may pay his paycheck, but his public 
spirited postings could easily give someone the impression that he is 
working for the public at large.


Well-Documented Thoughts   Each of the book's nine chapters has about 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   fifteen to twenty citations to further readings 
on related topics.  Most references are to books and periodicals from 1991, 
1992, and 1993.  The quantity and quality of research that was done in 
assembling "Doing Business on the Internet" is indeed impressive.  
Citations are given to periodicals as diverse as the Internet Business 
Journal, Scientific American, Forbes, and Sloan Management Review--to name 
a few.  Book citations range from better known books on telecommunications 
(i.e. Krol's "Whole Internet Guide & Catalog," and the like), to lesser 
known books on modern business practices.  Along with all the standard and 
predictable references, Cronin includes references to annual reports from 
Motorola and Intel, information sources often overlooked by others.


Minor Quibbles and Nit-Picking   "Doing Business on the Internet" succeeds 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   in many respects, but the book does gloss 
over a few topics that beg for greater coverage.  For instance, what effect 
will the snowballing freenet movement have on company/customer relations?  
And if online communications with customers yields substantial benefits to 
companies, what actions are these companies taking to help train the 
general population in basic telecommunications skills?

     To be sure, freenets are mentioned in passing once or twice in the 
book.  But the subject could well merit an entire chapter in future 
editions of the book.

     Another minor quibble with this book is that it leaves the reader 
wishing for more.  The content is indeed gripping and well-presented--but 
one might wish for just a few more anecdotes, a few more case studies.


Conclusion   Cronin's book is as much about people as it is about 
""""""""""   technology.  One of the recurring themes of the book is the 
slowness with which people come to understand the usefulness of new tools 
and technologies.  Those who do comprehend the power of these tools have a 
one-up on their business competitors:  "Companies already linked to the 
Internet receive the advantages of high-speed telecommunications and 
continuously evolving technology while learning invaluable lessons about 
the management of networked organizations....  We are just beginning to 
understand the impact of networked communications on our daily lives and 
way of doing business."

     "Doing Business on the Internet" brings you the voices of many people 
who have evangelized the benefits of Internet connection within their 
companies.  The book succeeds in the way that it lets you draw your own 
conclusions from these first hand sources.

     It's an irony of modern life that it sometimes takes superhuman 
efforts to convince businesses to act in their own best interest.  When it 
comes to convincing business managers about the benefits of connecting 
their employees to the Internet, this book is just the ticket.

True Stories

     I've never told this story publicly, but I figure it's long enough 
ago, and Apple's interest in this Apple II stuff is behind us, so what the 
heck.

     A few years ago we got a license to distribute the DOS 3.3 System 
Master on-line, which we hadn't had before.  So the disks were mailed to 
us, straight from Apple Licensing.

     So I get this really nice package from Apple with the nice white disk 
envelopes and labels and stuff.  And just to make sure everything's kosher, 
I boot the System Master that they sent us.

     Well, it boots into DOS 3.3... and up comes an old copy of Locksmith, 
the ancient Pirate's Favorite in the heady days of the DOS 3.3 Apple II 
world.

     I'm really not kidding.  I looked over the disk carefully and that's 
all it was... a copy of Locksmith.  On a write-protected, Apple labelled 
disk that Apple Licensing sent straight to us.

     What's doubly funny is the original Locksmith was copy protected, so 
this means that somewhere in Apple's history, someone either "cracked" this 
or accepted a pirate copy.

     When we got it we realized these people had no idea what the heck 
they were doing when it came to Apple II stuff.  So we quietly uploaded 
another copy of the DOS 3.3 System Master we had lying around, and that's 
what's up there in A2 today.

     I wonder if I still have that disk?  I'm pretty sure it's buried 
somewhere in my huge collection of 5.25 disks, gathering dust.  :-)

                   """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This month's column is dedicated to those of you who are newcomers to 
GEnie, or who have never downloaded or uploaded files, and want to become 
more familiar with the process.  I will provide information about the 
processes, as well as the software you need to consider obtaining.

     Much of the content of this column is duplicated from other sources, 
written by other folks, within the A2 area.  It is being repeated here in 
the hope that its message will reach a larger, or at least a different 
audience.

     We in A2 want to encourage you to become actively involved in the 
roundtable.  Questions are encouraged.  Visit the bulletin board or the 
Real Time Conference rooms and find out how friendly we can be. :)

     And now, on with the show!

                                 [*][*][*]


     Downloading a file from the A2 library is a fairly straightforward 
task.  After you access GEnie and find yourself at the prompt following the 
announcements, type m645;3 and press return.  This will take you directly 
to the menu displayed below.  (You can also type "A2" at the prompt, and 
then select #3 from the main menu to get here.)

Enter # or <P>revious?

     To download a file that you know the number for, select #6 from the 
menu.  (If you don't know the file number, #3 will let you search for it by 
key word or uploader.)  Next you will be asked the file number; type it and 
press return.  Next you will be shown the long description of the file and 
given several options.  The option you want is "D" to download it.

     Next you must select from the following menu:

     1. XMODEM
     2. XMODEM (w/1k blocks)
     3. YMODEM
     4. ZMODEM

     What you select will depend on the software you are using.  For 
example, TIC (Talk is Cheap) does not support ZMODEM, but ProTERM and 
Spectrum do.  Before you go online to download, read your software 
documentation to determine which of these to use.  (YMODEM is generally 
considered a bad option.)  Once you make your choice, you will be told:

"File is ready. Start your XMODEM [or whatever mode you chose] receive 
file."

At this point, what you do is determined by how your software handles 
things.  Again, read your software manual first.

     Once the download is complete, and you press a key or two in response 
to prompts, you will be asked if you want to download another file.  If you 
do, you will go through the process again; if not, you will go back to the 
library menu screen.

     The following information is copied from the information available in 
category 1 of the A2 bulletin board.  It should help you to understand the 
format of files in the A2 library, as well as what you must do to any file 
that you plan to upload or download.


What is the .BXY file format?   You have probably been noticed that the 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   files in our library end with the suffix 
.BXY.  Pronounced "boxy," this type of file is a Binary II file containing 
a single NuFX archive created by ShrinkIt.  In essence, these files are 
nothing but ShrinkIt files inside Binary II "envelopes". 

     This .BXY file format is the official A2 RoundTable packing standard. 
Older files created with BLU or other packing programs will not be accepted 
in our library.  In addition, files created by ShrinkIt without a Binary II 
"wrapper" will also not be accepted on new uploads.  Thus, older style .SHK 
and .SDK files will not be accepted into our library.

     The reasons for this are manifold.  This standard was established in 
1989 in cooperation with GEnie, CompuServe, Apple Computer, Andy Nicholas 
(author of ShrinkIt), and Gary Little, creator of Binary II.  This standard 
has been accepted because it will, in the long run, make life easier for 
all users.  It's important that industry-wide standards be established and 
adhered to.

     There are two ways to create a BXY file, and two ways to download and 
unpack them.  You can use whichever you find easiest to use and remember.

     To create a .BXY file, you just need to use ShrinkIt 2.1 or later 
(use the latest version available, which as of this writing is 3.4).  With 
this method, you select the files you want to archive.  Next ShrinkIt will 
ask you to type in a filename for the archive.  End your filename entry by 
pressing Open-Apple-Return (instead of Return alone) and ShrinkIt will add 
Binary II formatting automatically.  If your communications program has a 
Binary II option for UPloading--(such as ProTERM, Point-to-Point, or 
Spectrum--just pack with ShrinkIt normally (i.e. without the 
Open-Apple-Return at the end), but turn your communication software's 
Binary II option ON while uploading.  Don't do both!

     To download a BXY file, you should turn the Binary II option of your 
term program ON.  For ANY OTHER download, you should NOT use the Binary II 
option.  After the download, just use ShrinkIt to unpack.

     If your term program does not have a "Binary II" option for 
downloading, simply download the file without this option.  You can then 
just use ShrinkIt 2.1 or later to unpack without any difficulty. 

     Just remember these simple rules:

     A) When uploading, pack all files with ShrinkIt.  Do not use any 
        other packing program. 

     B) When uploading, EITHER use Open-Apple-Return when entering the 
        filename of the archive, OR use the Binary II option of your 
        terminal program.  PLEASE DO NOT DO BOTH.

     C) When downloading .BXY files, turn the Binary II option of your 
        term program on.  If your program doesn't have this option, or you 
        prefer to download BXY files using exactly the same steps as other 
        types of files, just download normally with Binary II off.  But 
        make sure you have ShrinkIt 2.1 or later. 

     D) When downloading any other type of file (XX., PP., .BNY, .BQY, 
        .TXT, etc.) do NOT use the Binary II option of your term program. 

     Don't worry if you forget to turn Binary II on when downloading, as 
ShrinkIt will handle the file anyway.  But ultimately, most users will be 
better off making use of this option. 


Graphics File Uploads   In the interest of making downloads and subsequent 
"""""""""""""""""""""   viewing as simple as possible, A2's IIgs graphics 
libraries will be supporting a single file type of both standard SHR 
graphics and 3200 color graphics. 

     In library 22, along with graphic programs, you will find 3200 color 
pictures.  These are special graphics whereby each scan line may have a 
different palette of 16 colors, giving 200 * 16 = 3200 possible different 
colors.  Our 3200 color pictures are (or will be converted to) type 76 
block $C1, or PIC, files.  This type of picture requires a special viewer.  
We recommend Chris McKinsey's SuperView.  You can enter "SUPERVIEW.BXY" at 
the "download file" prompt.  Additionally, it will also view normal 
one-screen pictures. 

     Library 23 contains standard SHR pictures of 320x200 or 640x200 
resolution, using no more than 16 palettes, although most generally use 
one.  These pictures will be in Apple Preferred Format, or PNT files 
($C0/0002).


Rules About Disk Archives   Here follows a few clarifications on doing 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   "disk" archives:

     A2 normally insists on "file" archives for all ProDOS and GS/OS 
uploads.  This is because we can't know what kind of hardware every 
downloader may have, and because hard disk owners get downright irate when 
they have to dust off their 5.25 drive and plug it into their GS just to 
unpack a file that they will then have to transfer to their hard disk.  And 
we can't blame them.  In fact, if the upload is a collection of related 
files, we really prefer that they be placed in their own folder and the 
entire folder be archived, though this is by no means a required step.

     However, some things such as DOS 3.3 files, the TETRIS2 upload, etc. 
cannot be placed on a ProDOS disk.  Since ShrinkIt is a ProDOS program, the 
only way it can handle such files is by shrinking the entire disk without 
worrying about the contents.

     Let's consider what this means.  If you are archiving a well-used DOS 
3.3 disk, much of the "blank" disk space will actually contain files that 
have been erased from the disk catalog.  Remember, deleting a file merely 
removes it from the catalog; it does NOT remove it from the disk.  (That's 
why "Undelete" programs are able to work.)

     Now, ShrinkIt has no way of telling which disk sectors are in use and 
which are free, and archives all 560 DOS 3.3 sectors.  This means that all 
those previously deleted files are ALSO archived, although they aren't in 
the catalog.  This is incredibly inefficient and you can easily wind up 
with a disk archive that is larger than the unpacked length of the files 
you are uploading!

     Some people have tried to get around this by transferring the DOS 3.3 
files to a ProDOS disk and putting them in a "file" archive.  This is an 
bad idea for several reasons.  First, the downloader must convert it back 
to DOS 3.3 to use.  You'd be amazed how many people don't understand how to 
do that or why it's necessary.  The confusion factor is just too much.  
Secondly, the files will have to be renamed to something that ProDOS will 
take.  All too often, the new name will cause the program to crash.  And 
the user will be unable to fix it because he won't know what the original 
names were.

     We also want to remember that DOS 3.3 uploads must not contain a copy 
of the DOS 3.3 system software.  Apple Corp. still owns it and frowns on 
this practice.  We check all DOS 3.3 uploads for this and do not release 
the ones that still have DOS on them.

     Here's how to fix all these problems:

     1) Format a blank DOS-less disk. I use Copy II+.

     2) Copy all the files to be uploaded to the new disk.

     3) Archive the new disk.

     The freshly formatted disk will have all unused sectors "zeroed out". 
These "zeroed" sectors compress to an extremely small space, so that the 
resulting "disk" archive is at most just a block or two larger than a 
"file" archive would have been.

     I hope this makes the reasoning behind the A2 rules clearer to you.

      UPLOAD.TIPS.BXY    FILE #20171    12800 BYTES    UPLOADING TIPS
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Tom Zuchowski provides a variety of tips for newcomers to GEnie who 
want to upload files to the A2 library.  As Tom says, "Newcomers to A2's 
uploading process must go through a learning curve.  These tips will guide 
you past the most common errors made by newcomers who are uploading for the 
first time.  If you follow them closely you can be confident that your 
uploads will be correct and easily handled by the A2 staff and those who 
will download it."

                                 [*][*][*]


     Obviously, if you plan to do any up- or downloading, you will need a 
copy of ShrinkIt.  If you do not have one, or if your copy is fairly old, 
you can get the latest versions from the library.  There is a version for 
those of you with Apple IIe (enhanced with 128K of memory) or the Apple 
IIc, as well as a version for the Apple IIgs.  (There is also a version for 
an Apple II+ with 64K.)  First we will talk about the IIe version.


    SHRINKIT34.EXE (file #20074 - 41856 bytes) ShrinkIt for the IIe/IIc
    '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is ShrinkIt for the IIe & IIc, the standard archiver/de-archiver 
for the Apple IIe enhanced with 128K of memory, or the IIc, and ProDOS. 

     This version of ShrinkIt will unpack itself with a little help from 
you.  Read the directions below for details.

     Make sure to give it a file type of TXT when you download it.  This 
is important!  You may want to double-check that your terminal package is 
not downloading as BIN.  Also, it's important that you keep the file name 
as "SHRINKIT34.EXE".  Make sure that you have 82 free blocks on the same 
disk as SHRINKIT34.EXE.  Then run BASIC.SYSTEM and from the "]" prompt, 
type -SHRINKIT34.EXE  (that's a dash, then the name of the file).

     That will get you the working version of ShrinkIt for the IIe & IIc! 
It will fit on a 5.25 diskette.  The documentation is available in another 
file (see below).

     In order to make the file SHRINKIT34.EXE unpackable to a single 5.25 
floppy disk, the documentation file was removed from it.  The documentation 
merely details the history, and give other general info about the program.  
It's not necessary to have this file to operate the program.  Should you 
feel the need for completeness, then this file is for you.  The BXY version 
of Shrinkit 3.4 already contains this file so a download is unnecessary.

                                 [*][*][*]


     If you have a GS, the ShrinkIt for you is GS-ShrinkIt v1.1 which is 
described below.  (You may also want to download ShrinkIt 3.4 in order to 
unpack 5.25" disk archives.)


       GSHK.BSE V1.1  (file #19517 - 118272 bytes)  GS-ShrinkIt v1.1
       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is GS-ShrinkIt v1.1.  This is also a ShrinkIt self-extracting 
archive inside a Binary II wrapper.  This means that you'll have to remove 
the Binary II wrapper either when downloading using your communications 
program (that is, turn Binary II mode ON), or remove the Binary II wrapper 
with a separate program once you've downloaded this archive if you have a 
program like BLU or an older version of ShrinkIt.  If your terminal program 
doesn't have a Binary II mode and you don't have a separate program, you 
should follow the instructions above and download SHRINKIT34.EXE.  Once you 
have ShrinkIt 3.4, you can use that to remove the Binary II wrapper from 
GSHK.

     GSHK v1.1 is faster compressing, faster decompressing, can make 
self-extracting archives, and has been made easier to use.  A MUST-HAVE for 
anyone downloading files from A2 or A2Pro!

     Remember, you MUST download this with Binary II turned on, or use 
some other utility after the download to remove the Binary II wrapper.  
Then just run the program to have it extract itself.

                   Apple II Offline Navigators for GEnie
                   '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 
     The Apple II RoundTable on GEnie (A2) offers three FREE (aside from 
download charges) great time-saving programs for Apple II users to navigate 
throughout all GEnie.
 
     With CoPilot, GEM, or TCXpress, you perform all your work offline, 
that is, while not connected to the system.  You can read and write E-mail 
or bulletin board messages, scan new uploads and select files to download, 
and more (downloads not supported by TCXpress).  Once you're ready, the 
offline navigation program is instructed to go online on GEnie, at which 
point it sends all messages, collects all replies to previous messages, 
downloads all selected files, and so on, all at the fastest possible speed 
(much faster than a human could do it manually).  Within a few minutes it 
finishes its task and then automatically logs off the system.
 

Apple IIgs Only   CoPilot is a full GS/OS desktop program that runs on the 
"""""""""""""""   Apple IIgs   only.  It requires 1 meg of RAM, a hard 
drive, and Apple IIgs System 6.0.  There are three versions of CoPilot 
v2.5--one each for ProTERM 3.0 (or later), Talk is Cheap 3.31 (or later), 
and Spectrum.  There is an older version of CoPilot (v2.1) still available, 
for Point to Point 4.0 and Talk is Cheap 3.20.

     For those of you with Apple IIgs's, the CoPilot files are

     file#   file name               Description

     23130   COPILOT.SPC.BXY  V2.5   CoPilot v2.5 and Spectrum scripts

                                         Talk is Cheap 3.20

     For a limited time, you can download all three flavors of CoPilot 
v2.5 for nothing!  GEnie surcharges (but not charges of connecting networks 
such as SprintNet and DataPac) will be waived while you download the file.  
Check to see if the offer is still open before downloading!

     TCXpress is a GEnie-specific message processor that uses the 
combination of AppleWorks 3.0, TimeOut TeleComm and UltraMacros (3.1 or 
4.x).  TCX is menu-driven and will auto-capture mail and roundtable 
messages and will auto-send mail and RT messages that you compose offline.  
Includes quote-back, mark and unmark, auto-file-save options.  This file 
contains both TCX versions:  TCX3 for use with UltraMacros 3.1, and TCX4 
for use with Ultra 4.  UnShrinks to a 3.5-inch disk, and REQUIRES either a 
hard drive and a 3.5 drive, or two 3.5 drives.  It also requires that you 
own Ultramacros 3.1 or 4.X, and Timeout Telecomm.

July/August 1994 Report
"""""""""""""""""""""""
by GEna Saikin
     [A2.GENA]


     Planetary Apple Users Group (PAUG) was started almost exactly a year 
ago, at KansasFest (Kfest)... to help provide support to the Apple II user 
who may have no local user group available.  You may have heard of it under 
its former name, Planetary Apple League (PAL).

     In the past year, we have had a number of special speakers on a 
variety of topics, letting us in on the cutting edge of Spectrum, 
AppleWorks 4 and other new programs and developments.

     Plans are in the process of having folks who are members of outside 
User Groups to come to future PAUG meetings and tell us about their User 
Group, and tying this in with a greater cooperation between PAUG and our 
sister User Groups out there.


WHAT'S NEW IN APPLEDOM   There are many exciting things happening in the 
""""""""""""""""""""""   Apple II world.  A couple of new programs are out, 
including Quick Click Calc--a powerful spreadsheet--and the latest update 
to AppleWorks 4.  Version 4.3 is the last change for the current version, 
but AppleWorks 5 is planned for release before then end of the year.  
Animasia, a 3D animation program is slated to come out very soon, and 
send/receive faxware for the IIgs is in the cooker.

     On November 1, 1994, America Online (AOL) will be shutting the door 
on Apple II users using their Apple II systems.  They will no longer be 
able to access AOL with their Apple II.  

     The Apple II RT (A2) has been gearing up to make these exiles feel at 
home, and already, we are seeing many, many new faces, as more and more 
refugees straggle in and find themselves a home.  A2 has created a special 
deal for these refugees, including a $50 credit and great discounts on 
ProTERM, TIC and Spectrum, which will come with a GEM and Co-Pilot disk, 
our two popular offline processor programs.


THE MAIN EVENT   This newsletter will combine two months worth of meetings, 
""""""""""""""   for our July meeting was the last Sunday in July--as a 
post-Kfest get-together.

     Though we had no "special speaker", many folks who were at 
ICONference (formerly KansasFest) showed up to tell us about their 
experiences.  And what experiences were had!

     It was three days packed with learning and lots of fun!  Seminars 
covered everything from the new Animasia to a demo on the Mensch computer; 
from Joe Kohn's inspired talk on the Internet to a glimpse at the PowerPc, 
a taste of Chicago (the new Windows) and System 7.5 for the Mac.

     There was as much after Hours--as much fun as last year, if not more 
so!  We had the usual "bite the bag" contest (won by Roger Wagner), a "Nerf 
gun fight", many pizza parties, and an annual roast of Mike Westerfield 
(excellent... poor guy, never had a chance! <grin>).

     Actually, it's so hard to describe the goings on there... you have to 
be there to appreciate what went on!  So, all of you, prepare for next 
year, so we can see you there!

     Our August meeting was dedicated to an Open House for our new friends 
from AOL--giving them a quick tour of what A2 and GEnie has to offer them!  
We had a huge crowd--over 20 people showed up for this big event!

     What do we have to offer?  A library that's had over 23,000 uploads 
with thousands of cool files; a bulletin board chock full of information 
and support; and a very active Real Time Conference, manned 7 days a week, 
from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. eastern on a nightly basis, Saturday afternoons and 
virtually all day Sundays.


THE LIBRARY STACK   Here are a bunch of great files that are from our very 
"""""""""""""""""   own Dean's List.  If you want to learn more about Kfest 
and have a IIgs, download Auri's masterpiece, file #23122.  There's a lot 
of good stuff about what went on there.  File #23102 has some great 
pictures of Kfester's.

 +23050 KEYWORDINFO.TXT         Describes how GEnie library keywords work


WHAT'S NEW IN A2?   A2 is in the process of gearing up for AOL refugees and 
"""""""""""""""""   we have increased our RTC schedule as well (to Saturday 
afternoons).  We will soon be present in Chat, manning an "AOL Refugee 
Center" and will appear in GENIEus as "Help Desk for a night" on 31 August.

     Come to our next meeting in September (topic to be announced) and 
enjoy the company of your fellow A2 users!  We would like to say "Welcome 
Home" to our AOL friends, and let you know that you've picked the best 
online service for Apple II support out there!
