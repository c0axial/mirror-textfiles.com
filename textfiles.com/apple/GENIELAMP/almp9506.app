Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     Summer's here, and that means it's time for--you guessed it--reruns 
on your TV!

     Instead of reruns, I'd like to talk to you about a summer special 
that's been scheduled.  It's called KansasFest, and it's especially for 
Apple II users.  It's not on TV... it's a summer get-together in Kansas 
City, Missouri.

     Last time, I told you that you could write me for information about 
KansasFest.  (Thanks to those who did!)  This month, I'm pleased to 
announce that the "transfer of power" has taken place, and that you should 
now E-mail registrations and information requests to:

     kfest.info$@genie.com

If your mailer won't let you include a dollar sign ($) in an E-mail 
address, try this address instead:

     kfest@galadriel.ecaetc.ohio-state.edu

     As you'll see in this month's issue of the PAUG newsletter, 
KansasFest is a go!  If you've never been to KansasFest before, you'll want 
to go this year, and if you're an old Kfest hand, you don't need me to 
encourage you to return.

     KansasFest began as a summer conference for Apple II programmers, but 
it quickly became a more informal get-together for Apple II users of all 
sorts.  KansasFest was started by Resource Central, which metamorphosed 
into ICON.  As we all know, ICON and all its disk publications disappeared 
this year, but the Apple II community on GEnie was determined that 
KansasFest live on, and they've pulled it off!

     KansasFest guarantees you a great time.  I went for the first time, 
last year, and it was wonderful.  Lots of demonstrations of new products, 
lectures, and just plain hanging around with Apple II people.  Nobody tries 
to be la-di-da or uppity, there's a cup of tea for all.  (Well, the cup of 
tea is more likely to be a can of Jolt Cola, Dr Pepper, or Mountain Dew, 
but you get the idea.)  Stay up all night programming.  See the PAUG 
newsletter for details on what's been planned and how you can enjoy the 
fun!

                                 [*][*][*]


     Here's a tip for those of you who can't wait for GEnie to unveil the 
Usenet newsgroup part of their Internet services:

     You can already read Apple II related newsgroups using Lynx!

     To do that, you'll need to know a little bit about using Lynx via 
GEnie.  So go explore, and come back here when you're done.

     Right.  All you need to do to read the messages in comp.sys.apple2 
and other such newsgroups is go to a web page that has a link to those 
newsgroups.  If you know about such a web page, please use it.  If you 
don't, you can use this example.

     Once you've started Lynx on GEnie, press G to go to a specific page.  
Then type:

     http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~nathan/apl2.resource.html

     This should get you to Nathan Mates's Apple II page.  (I first met 
Nathan when he generously sent me some of his Apple IIgs programs for 
inclusion on A2-Central.  Hi, guy!)

     Hands off the keys for a moment, please!  Yes, on the first screen 
you should see a reference to comp.sys.apple2, but you don't want to select 
that link.  We're still in the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section.  
Press the space bar once or twice, until you see the Newsgroups section 
Nathan has set up.  Then move the cursor to comp.sys.apple2, and press 
Return.  Voila!  A bunch of subject headers from that newsgroup.  You can 
join in the fun on the Usenet.  In fact, you can even try to post a message 
if you like.  It might even work! :-)

     Who else would tell you these things, gang?

SEQUENTIAL BBS NOW ON THE NET   The Sequential BBS is now available from

       login: bbs

     (i.e., 'bbs' is both the login name, and the password. The password 
MUST be typed in lowercase letters).

     Since GEnie now has Telnet capabilities, I am turning the Sequential

YOUR MONEY MATTERS TO BE A LOST CLASSIC?   I got some bad news and some 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   good news.

     After quite a bit of time trying to unsuccessfully duplicate some 
problems with the beta version of YMM that testers found but which they 
couldn't duplicate,  I've decided to not release a new version of YMM.  
That's the bad news. 

     However, the good news is that I'll be happy to release the program 
and it's source code to the Lost Classics. I'll be talking to A2.Tim to get 
this done as soon as possible.

     In retrospect I wish I had done quite a few things differently in 
developing and marketing YMM.  Along with some complaints on the program I 
have gotten many more compliments (many times from the same people). Trying 
to continue to support and update YMM on a part time basis along with 
everything else (wife, home, job, and two kids) has been hectic and it 
hasn't allowed me enough time for YMM to support it the way I would have 
liked to.  Hopefully someone else (or multiple someone elses) will be able 
to step in and do a better job.

     I'll be making up quite a few copies of the program, the beta 
version, the validation program, and the documentation which I will send 
out as required and I will answer any questions that I can.  

     However, along with releasing YMM to the A2 Lost Classics I'll also 
be selling my Apple IIgs computer and software.  I've been using an Apple 
II+, IIe, and finally Apple IIgs for close to 14 years and it'll be hard to 
let go of it.  I wrote three commercial programs for the Apple II series of 
computers and in total have had over 3000 users of these programs.  It was 
a lot of work and a lot of fun.  

     We did get a PC Clone around Christmas time with a CD Rom and while 
the operating system on the IIgs is better, there is a wealth of home and 
educational software available for it that is really awesome.  Apple's 
teatment of the IIgs and it's lack of marketing support for the IIgs made 
the decision to get a PC clone pretty easy for me (plus my wife uses an IBM 
PC at work).

     I'll be around for a couple of months but then expect I'll most 
likely drop my Genie account.  I'll always be available by snail mail 
though.

NEW EXTERNAL COMMANDS FOR SPECTRUM 2.0   I just posted THREE new Spectrum 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   XCMDs! :)

     If the files are OK they will be:

          #24921 - BatchXfer
          #24922 - Freezer
          #24923 - Library

     BatchXfer lets scripts send multiple files via the Ymodem-batch or 
Zmodem- batch protocol. (Users could always do this manually, but a script 
could not.)

     Freezer "disconnects" the mouse during file transfers, so moving the 
mouse will not cause character loss at that time. There are also commands 
that scripts can use to freeze/unfreeze the mouse during any "crucial" 
access.

     Library lets scripts access a common "library" script that contains 
functions you often use. For example, if you write 10 scripts and in each 
one you include a subroutine that centers text, you can instead put the 
"center text" function into the library and change those 10 scripts to call 
the library function. If you wanted to change the centering routine to fix 
a problem or add some feature, instead of modifying the routine in those 10 
separate scripts you'd just have to modify the common library script.

APPLE II HARDWARE FROM ABC DIRECT   I've been exchanging e-mail with David 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   of ABC Direct, who are marketing a 1.44 
MB floppy drive for the Mac and Apple II which is basically the same as the 
old AE drive.  I asked if it would work as a 1.44 MB drive on the GS and 
his response was:

     "Yes, our 1.44MB drive will work in the IIgs.  If the IIGS is 
SuperDrive compatible, then you will see 1.44MB. Otherwise, you will need 
to wait for our 1.44MB controller card that will be available in August.

     1 800 481 6782

     So it looks like we will be seeing a new superdrive card for the 
Apple II line this summer. Good news for our market again!

from Icon/Tom Weishaar and could get all the missing issues of the 
publications (I do have quite a few I bought used, but not complete...) I'd 
see to it that such a CD being produced. Would there be interest in such a 
CD?

TRUETYPE AND POSTSCRIPT FONTS   Hi all, this is a long post coming, hope 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   you don't mind:

     Mark Kline and I have been working on a problem he's had at school 
and I thought this was exciting enough information to share with everyone 
:)

     Mark has a computer lab with many GS's tied to a Laserwriter Select 
360, a Postscript printer.  He's able to display Truetype fonts on screen 
via Pointless, and if the fonts he wants to use for printing have 
Postscript equivalents, he can d/l the Postscript equivalents with 
Laserbeam.

     Unfortunately, Mark also has a bunch of TrueType fonts that don't 
have Postscript equivalents, including a few mathematical fonts (he's a 
teacher).  So we needed to find a way to send the TrueType fonts to the 
Postscript printer and have them make sense.

     Having a Macintosh, I know that the Mac Laserwriter driver can make 
the conversion on the fly or d/l the TrueType font to the printer and the 
font can be used like any Postscript font.  So that was my starting point, 
and after a few days of fooling around, I've figured out how to use a Mac 
to convert a TrueType font to a downloadable Postscript file that will 
contain the font data and remain in the printer; I'm hesitant about calling 
this a Postscript font because it's really not one.  However, you can d/l 
it using Laserbeam or your favorite comm program (not fully tested, but it 
works with both the Mac and Laserbeam, so I'll assume it works with 
anything).

     Here we go:

     (1) Make sure the TT font you want to use is installed in the Mac.

     (2) Use a Macintosh word processor (I use WriteNow 4, but any should 
do) to create a new document, select the font you want to convert, and 
insert a single space into the document, of any size.

     (3) Make sure the Laserwriter is chosen in the Chooser, ATalk on.

     (4) Select Page Setup, click the options button, and make sure 
"substitute fonts" is _not_ checked.

     (5) Select Print, under "Destination" click the "File" radio button, 
then hit "Save".

     (6) In the Save File dialog box, save as Format: PostScript Job, Font 
inclusion: All (All But Standard 13 should work as well :), under whatever 
name you want (in this case, I use the name 'Tryit').

     (7) Open the file (Tryit) with your word processor.

     (8) Search for the string "%%BeginFont" without the quotes.

     (9) Between the last line following %%BeginFont starting with a % 
(mine says "%IPS-TrueTypeFont-1-1-1", again without the quotes) and the 
first line without a preceeding % (mine says "25 dict begin" without 
quotes), insert, on its own line, "serverdict begin 0 exitserver" without

     That file now contains the pseudo Postscript font.  Send the thing to 
the printer however you want (comm program, Laserbeam, Laserwriter utility 
on the Mac). . . it may give you an error message while loading (it does 
for me :), but the font appears to stay in the printer; shows up on 
documents like a regular font after that, and I would suspect you don't 
even have to change the name of the fonts anymore (Laserbeam users know 
what I'm talking about).

     Caveats: I have not tested extensively yet, but this seems to work 
fine with TrueType fonts from the KeyFonts CD Rom, which I use regularly.  
I would think it would work with any TT Font on the Mac; additionally, the 
generated files are quite large (close to 300k so far, it seems), which can 
take quite a bit of time to d/l.  I thought this was exciting enough to 
post about.  Have a good time with it; I'll be around to try and answer 
questions on it :)

GENIE FRONT-END FOR THE IIGS NEWS   Well, the final results of the "Name 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   the Apple IIgs Front End" poll are 
here!  After the votes were tabulated, the winners were easy to find... 
unfortunately, however, we cannot yet release them.  :)  After a long 
discussion with the GEnie for the Apple IIgs Product Manager, Syndicomm and 
A2Pro management came to the realization that the front end simply couldn't 
be ready on time if we included the recommendations of the beta testers, 
who have been a marvelous help as we've moved towards a truly polished 
product.

     Therefore, we are extending the beta test, as well as re-opening the 
field to anyone else who would like to be a tester.  We will not reject 
anyone, so even if you were informed earlier that we were full, we have a 
place for you.  If you'd rather not use pre-release software, well... it 
looks like we can offer you August 1st as a release date.  We're very sorry 
that it couldn't be sooner.

     PLEASE!  If there's anything you'd like to have included in the front 
end, let us know ASAP.  Your suggestions may not be prepared in time for 
version 1.0, but they will certainly be given most careful consideration.

     Also, it has come to my attention that some users are not sure 
exactly what this entire "Front End" thing is all about.  Thus, I have 
created a topic in A2's Category 3 where you can ask any questions you 
like.  No, this is _not_ a new version of CoPilot (although we hope to 
release a new CoPilot version at some point in the future).  No, you do 
_not_ need any other program to use this.  Topic 37 is now available in 
A2's bulletin board to help answer these and other questions.

     The remainder of the voting results (with the top three scores hidden 
for the suspense :) follow.  Thank you for your patience.

EARLY REPORTS OF SECOND SIGHT   It's love at Second Sight!
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   

     I'm back... with an upgraded RamFAST, my Second Sight card installed 
and a lovely 15" .28 pitch SVGA monitor. Gorgeous! (QuickDraw desperately 
needs an upgrade, though). 

     One thing... can you guys make the ribbon cables a little longer? I 
have a ROM 01, and with the card in slot 3, the cable won't reach the 
connector opening (for now, my GS case is opened up for the VGA cable to 
reach inside). I'd have gladly paid a little more for a little more 
cable...

     I ordered my card on 9/16/94, the wait was definitely worth it. Great 
job, Sequential!

<<<<<   > Could you please reveal who you ordered it from
"""""

     Directly from Sequential. I saw the TurboRez at Apple Expo West, and 
then and there set aside funds for the eventual release of that card. When 
I heard about Second Sight, I _immediately_ ordered one. I almost got 
whiplash reaching for the phone ;) I was one of the first to place an 
order. Of course, I've been gnashing my teeth for 8 months waiting... I 
would also have gotten a TurboRez for our other GS if it would have been 
released.

     My card came with 1 meg video memory soldered on. Since I've got one 
of the first cards, the firmware isn't totally tricked out yet, and the 
manual is at present a stapled handout. But all of these will be 
automatically sent out as soon as they are finished, so don't fret.

     The SecondView software is very straightforward. It displays both 
GIFs and TIFFs. A disk of GIFs is included. The pictures are breathtaking 
compared to the GS SHR screen. Seeing that resolution on the standard GS 
RGB monitor was kind of weird after getting used to the limits of the GS 
display for so long. And my 15" SVGA monitor is fabulous, just like pics 
you would see on a PeeCee or a MAC, but with more style, of course.

> Hmmm, I don't like the sound of the ribbon cable being too short. Do you 
> mean it won't reach the opening directly behind the slot it's in?

     My cable is about an inch too short. The VGA connector needs to go in 
the opening behind slot 2. If I put the Second Sight in slot 2 it would 
just barely reach. I could barely put it in the (DB-25) opening in front of 
slot 3, but then I would have to move my SoundMeister and three other 
connectors (domino effect) and the VGA connector would need an adapter 
plate for the oversize hole. I don't like the idea of Apple leaving the 
M2B0 signal off of the other slots 1-6, so I'll probably break out the 
soldering iron to deal with that anyway. I made a little extension cable 
but I couldn't track down any 16-pin male headers today.

     BTW, Jawaid... Is my cable an exception? The VGA cable is 8-7/8" from 
the base of the HD-15 (where it meets the backplane of the GS) to the far 
side of the 16-pin header when installed.

     Anyway, the SHR screen is a little jaggy with Second Sight because 
you lose the dithering. But it is no big deal because there are no black 
lines between the scan lines either. Right now I have my RGB monitor hooked 
up to the standard RGB port, and my SVGA monitor running from Second Sight 
simultaneously. I've only had the card for a couple of days now, but I 
can't even look at the RGB monitor anymore. How did I avoid going blind 
looking at that screen?! Now I can read my messages from across the room 
with this baby. When comparing GIFs simultaneously on both screens, WOW! 
Order yours today, if you haven't already done so. If/when Quickdraw II is 
updated, the GS will really sparkle! I can't wait to see a //e with one of 
these under the hood. Thanks, Sequential!
                  (FROG.MAN, CAT20, TOP14, MSG:74/M645;1)

<<<<<   > How does the card improve the display on the RGB monitor if it's
"""""   > plugged into the card. (You can do that can't you? I may be
        > mistaken.)

     The improvement is significant. The display is white, not grayish, 
and 640 X 400 GIFs are very crisp!

>> My cable is about an inch too short.

> What's the chance of geting a longer cable to solve this problem.

     I called Sequential and they said that the first couple of boards 
sent out unfortunately had a VGA cable that was too short. They are sending 
a new one out to me pronto. So the problem already has been fixed...

HANGTIME'S HOTEL SURVEY   Quick comments (from memory) for those planning 
"""""""""""""""""""""""   to stay at a hotel while at KFest:

     The Fairfield is the closest to Avila, however NO hotel is within 
walking distance of the collage, you will need transportation.  This hotel 
is barebones, but clean and reasonably priced.  In years past they did 
offer a free continental breakfast (that was quite yummy, BTW).

     The Marriott is a gorgeous hotel with full amenities as I recall, but 
naturally you pay for that.  They do have weekend rates (Fri-Sun).

     Also I think I remember some questions regarding the difficulty in 
getting from the airport to the hotels, and from the hotels to the collage. 
Both are a snap.  The I-435 loop takes you almost from the airport (it's a 
short drive [I think on route 29, but that's foggy ... Hey, It's been a 
year]) to the hotels (they're right off the loop). From the hotels you just 
get back on 435 and get off at Wornall (There's even a little sign on the 
highway for Avila), and make a right ... the school is "down the road a 
piece" on the left.

to Avila College.  (This is only what I was told, so don't hold me to it if 
they change their rates.)  They need 1 day advance notice, so we might want 
to wait until a little closer to time to call them at  -----

                A 24-bit video card for Apple II computers.


Monitors   Works either with standard VGA/SVGA monitors, or with the 
''''''''   standard IIGS RGB ("AppleColor RGB") monitor & compatibles.

Modes   The following existing Apple II and IIGS video modes are emulated 
'''''   for display on an SVGA monitor.

        40 & 80 column text

        80x60*
        132x25
        132x60*

     There are three basic graphics modes: indexed (palette), Hi-Color, 
and True-Color.

     In indexed mode, each pixel can be one of 256 colors that are 
specified in a palette. Each of these 256 palette entries can be one of 
16.7M colors.  (All modes)

     In Hi-color mode, each pixel can be any of 32768 direct colors (no 
index or palette lookup).  (resolutions up to 800x600)

     True-color mode is similar, but each pixel can be any of 16.7M 
(million) colors. (resolutions up to 640x480)

     (Note: existing software titles will not automatically use the high- 
resolution modes).

     (* indicates that the mode is not available when used with an 
AppleColor RGB monitor.)

     (Since the VGA chip is completely programmable, there are actually a 
potential of millions of different text and graphics video modes - the 
above list is just the most commonly used ones).

Software Support   SecondSight comes with an image viewer program that 
''''''''''''''''   supports GIF and 8-bit TIFF images.  A Photo-CD viewer 
will be forthcoming soon.

     A programmer's library with on-disk documentation is also available, 
to facilitate the development of third-party software for the card.

     At the current time no QuickDraw II support is provided.

Cost   Pricing will be detailed in a future post; or feel free to call

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   

     1) There will be exactly six more issues of II Alive, including the 
May/June issue which is currently in production.  (There is no  March/April 
issue.  However, this doesn't mean you have missed an issue;  when you 
subscribed we signed you up for six issues; we don't just blindly  cut you 
off after a calendar year).

     2) Since we will cease publishing after six more issues, we are not 
accepting renewals.  We are, however, considering making individual  issues 
available as they are released, for those whose subscription runs  out 
before we stop publishing.  Pricing has not yet been set.  Possibly  we 
might offer some sort of mini-subscription (2-3 issues at a time).  We  are 
still considering what to do about this.  Drop me a note and let me  know 
what you think.

     3) At the end of II Alive's run, any subscriber who is still owed 
issues will receive a refund for unfulfilled issues.  (It is possible that 
we might arrange for subscription transfers to another publication, but it 
seems unlikely.)

     Sadly, II Alive subscriptions have been continuing to fall off and  
our Apple II business now represents less than 15% of our total sales  
volume. It's still profitable for us to sell Apple II products at the  
moment, but with the way things are going we will be very surprised if  the 
Apple II market is still profitable for us this time next year.

     On an unrelated note, I will no longer be employed by Quality 
Computers after June 6, 1995.  (I will be doing consulting and freelance 
writing full time, in case anyone is wondering.)  The parting is amicable 
and it is likely I'll be working on QC projects in the future, on a 
contract or part-time basis.

FAXINATION UPDATE V0.1.6   Another FAXination update is now available.  As 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   before, just unpack it and use the files to 
replace your old programs.  You can find it on the Vitesse BBS by

1. At the Main Menu, enter X for File Transfers.

     2. Enter 3 to go to Area 3 for FAXination Updates.  This is VERY 
important.

     2.a. If you go too far, use the 'Z' command to change areas, then do 
step 2.

     3. Enter 'S' to tell the BBS to Send you a file. (On your own 
computer, you will be receiving the file.)

     4. Choose 'A' to add a file to your Y-Modem batch, then select file 
number 1.

     5. Choose 'B' to Begin transmitting the files in your Y-Modem batch. 
Instruct your own computer to receive files using Y-Modem.

     This update corrects the bug in the FAXination printer driver which 
forces the "Condensed" check box to always be checked.  This same bug 
sometimes caused one or more pages of certain documents to be improperly 
scaled.

     A new set of options is now available which lets you set a prefix and 
suffix which are appended to the phone number each time you dial. Each of 
these fields can contain up to 20 characters.

     A new checkbox called "Line Noise Compensation" forces the fax 
transmission speed to slow down.  This is useful in cases where the fax 
appears to connect properly, but the received document is completely or 
partially garbled.

     Another new checkbox called "Extended Class 1 Protocol" is effective 
only with Class 1 modems.  Most Class 1 modems automatically handle delays 
between messages during the fax protocol conversation, and this box should 
normally remain unchecked.  However, some modems seem to do exactly what 
they are told, when they are told, so checking this box will cause 
FAXination to ensure that the required delays are being honored.  This 
check box is ignored for Class 2 modems.

     Error messages have been modified.  If the modem experiences "No Dial 
Tone," "Busy," "No Carrier" or similar conditions unexpectedly, the message 
will reflect this fact.  If the error is an unexpected condition related to 
the fax protocols, a generic error is generated indicating a "Fax Protocol 
Error."

     A few more instruction cycles have been trimmed from the interrupt 
handler.  This may improve reliability, especially when receiving faxes.

     A great deal of time has been spent searching for the "Fax Print" bug 
and the "Crash When Ready to Receive" bug.  These have not been found, but 
there are indications that there may be a CDEV or INIT conflict involved.  
If anyone experiences a consistent problem with printing faxes, or finds 
that their machine crashes while waiting for an incoming fax, please list 
the contents of your CDEVS folder and your SYSTEM.SETUP folder and e-mail 
them to the address below.  Otherwise, disable the programs one at a time, 
keeping track of what is being changed, and reboot and retry the failed 
operation until it works.  Then PLEASE tell us which program seems to be 
causing the conflict so we can fix it or at least warn everyone about what 
to look out for!!

     Thanks, and happy faxing!

SOFTWARE FOR THE SECOND SIGHT CARD?   Seven Hills Software, Procyon, and 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Sequential Systems are pleased to 
announce their cooperation to produce software that takes advantage of the 
Second Sight video card!

     In the near future Seven Hills Software plans to release two product 
updates that (among other improvements) will take advantage of the Second 
Sight card:

- SuperConvert is expected to support displaying pictures in higher 
  resolutions and colors

- Spectrum's ANSI display is expected to display true ANSI colors instead 
  of the "dithered" colors offered by the standard IIGS video hardware

     Support is also planned for other titles; watch for future 
announcements from Seven Hills Software.

IS 3.01 THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF SUPERCONVERT?   Yes, therefore No.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     The good news (which one can infer from the Second Sight notice 
posted in another Seven Hills topic) is that there WILL be an update to 
SuperConvert!  Jason Harper decided that his schedule just won't permit him 
to finish the update, so he has released all the source code to us!

     And we've already got someone lined up who thinks they'll be able to 
tackle the project and finalize the update.  The update already includes 
lots of great improvements; the new author will be polishing some of them, 
and filling in some of the "holes" where new features were planned but 
never written.  And, at the same time, we anticipate adding support for 
viewing pictures via the Second Sight video card from Sequential Systems.

     As always, I'll post more information when I have it. :)

Thanks,

<<<<<   The first upgrade was already almost done by Jason.  Our goal is
"""""   just to _complete_ that upgrade with its many current improvements 
and ship it.  Haven't you been waiting long enough? :)

     These Load Formats were added:
      + Apple II:
         New Print Shop Graphics
         Thunderscan Raw Scan File
         Springboard Publisher's "Works of Art"
      + Apple IIGS:
         ComputerEyes GS raw data file
      + Macintosh:
         MacPaint, as a monochrome image (a new image type in SuperConvert)

     The only item that falls outside "just _finishing_ the upgrade" is 
support for viewing pictures via the Second Sight board, which we 
anticipate will be relatively easy (and "safe").

     After the first update (which also includes lots of cool new 
features) is released, we've got some BIG plans on the drawing board. :)

GS/TCP GRAPHIC WEB-BROWSING SOFTWARE   Since GS/TCP is a 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   "When-he-has-the-time" project for 
the programmer (Derek Taubert), progress on it is somewhat herky-jerky :-)  
A more viable short-term solution would be something that works like 
"Slip-Knot" for PC's.. it interfaces to the Lynx program on an Internet 
shell account for people who don't have access to SLIP or PPP (the two 
direct methods to interface to the Web).

     Now, when TCP gets finished, support for it could easily be added to 
such a browser.

     I agree that Second Sight would be almost a prerequisite for such a 
beast (and I'm not even being biased here! :-)  While we GS'ers have lived 
with 16-color graphics for years, it _does_ take a non-trivial amount of 
time to convert a 256-color image to 16 colors.  This processing time would 
be on top of that which it takes to uncompress a GIF or JPEG image.  Yes, 
you could do a mostly-text browser which worked much like Lynx in that you 
only get an image when you specifically request it, but what fun is that? 
:-) (besides, that's what Lynx already does...)

Message 71        Wed May 10, 1995
JOE.KOHN [SSII]              at 10:25 EDT
 
     I remember being so intimidated the first time I attended KansasFest. 
 After all, there were going to be all these famous Apple II super-stars 
there, all these folks that I admired from afar.  How, I wondered, would I 
ever be able to talk to the likes of such mega-folks like Burger Bill or 
Roger Wagner?

     My fears were alleviated within minutes of arrival at Avila College.

     I found people there with all different computer skill levels.  I 
found teenagers and grand-fathers, students and teachers, programmers and 
hobbyists.  I soon discovered that there really was a "community" of Apple 
II users.  It didn't matter whether people were professional programmers or 
13 year olds.  There was a sense (and that sense is evident every day here 
on A2) that we were 'all in this together' and that all our differences 
disappeared as we gathered to socialize and learn from each other.

     For me, that first KansasFest was a real eye opener.  I never 
realized before that there were others like me.  I seriously thought I was 
unique and alone, lost in my own little Apple II world, until I went to 
KansasFest, and found hundreds of others who all spoke the exact same 
language as I did and cared about the exact same things I cared about.  I 
found I wasn't the only one who spent 60 or 70 hours every week sitting in 
front of my computer.  I found out that I wasn't the only one who struggled 
in front of my computer, trying to figure things out.

     By the time I got to KansasFest, I'd already been working with my 
Apple II for several years, but had done so from the isolation of my 
computer room.  I was already hopelessly obsessed and addicted to my Apple 
II, and it really was a great relief to learn that I wasn't alone.  During 
that first KansasFest, the isolation ended.  Not only did I meet my heroes, 
I became friends with them.

     KansasFest is an educational activity and a celebration that's a lot 
like going to summer camp with 100 of your closest friends.  It's always a 
thrill to meet people you've "met" online and to marvel that they don't 
look anything like you imagined they would.  It's inspirational to watch 
Roger Wagner in action.  It's amusing to watch Bill Heineman being followed 
around by teenage burger-wannabes.  It's great to meet our Australian 
brethren and laugh about the slang they speak.  It's a kick to see Tony 
Diaz's portable IIGS.  It's even fun to argue politics with Apple II peers 
and to philosophize on the meaning of life.

     KansasFest is truly the highlight of the year for Apple II users.  
It's fun and inspirational.  It's phenomenal to meet folks from all over 
the world who all care about the same things you care about.

     Forget any fears about not fitting in.  At KansasFest, you _will_ be 
among peers and good friends.

Joe

    While on GEnie,  do  you spend most of your time  downloading files?
If so, you may be missing out some excellent information in the Bulletin
Board  area.   The messages  listed above  only scratch  the surface  of
what's available and waiting for you in the bulletin board area.

    If you are serious about your Apple II, the GEnieLamp staff strongly
urge  you to give the  bulletin board area a try.   There are  literally
thousands  of messages  posted  from people  like you from  all over the
world.

Lynx and VT100
""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     Now that Internet services have come to GEnie, you can travel the 
World Wide Web and really explore.  You don't have to feel left out any 
more just because you have an Apple II.  (References to web pages are 
showing up everywhere these days:  I was only a little surprised to see 
them show up in movie ads, but shocked when one appeared on my bank 
statement last month!)  The Apple II doesn't yet have the fancy 
graphics-based interfaces such as Mosaic and Netscape, but you'll find the 
text-based interface of Lynx quite adequate.  All you need is VT100 
emulation.

     Don't let the term "VT100" intimidate you.  It's simply a standard 
display mode that most computers, including the Apple II, can support.  
That's really all you need to know.

     Can _your_ terminal program support VT100?  Probably.  ANSITerm, 
ProTERM, Spectrum, and Talk is Cheap all support it.  Chances are, you're 
already using one of those package to log on to GEnie... and if you're not, 
you probably should be.

     Not all Apple II terminal programs support VT100 equally, however.  
Apart from normal and inverse characters, VT100 can require bold, 
underlined, blinking, double wide, and double high characters... and 
combinations, such as bold underline.

     For the purpose of Lynx, you'll find what you need most are normal, 
bold, and underline characters, plus VT100's ability to move the cursor to 
any position on the screen.  Why you need normal characters should be 
self-explanatory.  Bold is often used in web pages for emphasis, so it's 
nice to have.  Underline is used to indicate links, so it's more than nice; 
it's vital!  (If you don't already know what links I'm talking about, see 
the sidebar at the end of this article.)

     Another consideration when using Lynx is what download protocols a 
telecom package supports.  Some images are embedded into web pages, which 
the Lynx user must do without, but others pictures may be downloaded.  If 
you download a file, GEnie asks you if you want to use Zmodem or Xmodem, so 
your terminal software had better support one or the other.

     Let's look at how various Apple II telecommunications programs stack 
up when it comes to VT100:

ANSITerm
""""""""
     Computer:  Apple IIgs only
     VT100 display:  super hi-res graphics

     ANSITerm, a commercial package, is probably the best of the lot for 
using Lynx on GEnie.  "Out of the box", it appears that its VT100 mode 
supports underlining but not bold characters.  However, you can configure 
ANSITerm's screen colors to get bold.  (Personally, I used a white 
background and a blue foreground.)  There's a trade-off, though:  either 
your normal characters or your bold characters must have a dithered look, 
which makes them harder to read.  You should choose the more ragged-edged 
characters for the bold text... it's the lesser of two evils.  Or you may 
prefer the default of having bold text displayed as normal text... it's up 
to you.

     ANSITerm not only supports Zmodem and Xmodem file transfer, but also 
Kermit.  Kermit is the method most often found on the net, so if you're 
expecting that your Internet time on GEnie will lead you to seek out a 
full-fledged Internet provider, and you're going to be buying 
telecommunications software, you should definitely consider ANSITerm for 
your IIgs.

     For use on the Internet, ANSITerm definitely rates an A+.

SnowTerm
""""""""
     Computer:  Apple IIgs only
     VT100 display:  super hi-res graphics

     SnowTerm is a shareware package that does an excellent job of 
displaying all VT100 modes, including blinking text, which ANSITerm cannot 
handle.  Since you're unlikely to come across blinking text while browsing 
the web, however, this point is somewhat moot.  The important point is that 
VT100 does an excellent job of displaying both underline and bold text.  It 
has a readable font for all modes... its display is even better than 
ANSITerm's, to my taste!

     SnowTerm falls down badly in the area of file transfer, though.  It 
offers nothing, not even Xmodem.  Since beginners are unlikely to need file 
transfer, SnowTerm's excellent handling of VT100 codes earns it a solid A.

ProTERM
"""""""
     Computer:  Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc+, Apple IIgs
     VT100 display:  text

     ProTERM, a commercial package, is the only text-based VT100 telecom 
software tested that earns a better-than-average rating.  Text-based 
software is at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to displaying both 
normal, bold, and underlined text.  The Apple II's 80-column text screen 
can display only normal and inverse text.  We can use inverse to indicate 
underlined text--much more important than bold when using Lynx--but what 
can we do about bold text?  One option is to ignore it entirely.  The other 
option is to use inverse text for bold as well.  However, if you use 
inverse for both underline and bold text, which is the ProTERM default, you 
won't be able to tell the links from the emphasized text!  Which is better?  
Well, if you ask me, it's better to ignore the bold text, but ProTERM lets 
you configure this parameter to your own taste.  That earns ProTERM extra 
marks.  Still, VT100 on the text screen is poor at best, partly due to 
anomalies in the way the 80-column text screen handles inverse.

     ProTERM also does well in the file transfer department, providing not 
only the Zmodem and Xmodem modes that GEnie encourages you to use, but also 
Kermit, for those that feel they may venture out further on the Internet.  
If you don't have an Apple IIgs, then ProTERM is the package that any 
Apple II Internet explorer should buy!  It rates a solid B+.

Agate
"""""
     Computer:  enhanced Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc+, Apple IIgs
     VT100 display:  double hi-res graphics

     Agate is a shareware package that uses the double hi-res screen to 
display underline text exactly as it should, with no recourse to inverse 
text.  However, its VT100 emulation is not perfect, and it occasionally 
drops characters... which can be dreadful, particularly if Agate chose to 
drop a character just as cursor co-ordinates were being sent.  Also, Agate 
does not allow you to use the arrow keys to navigate during Lynx, which is 
a serious disadvantage.  It is for this reason that Agate ranks the lowest 
of the graphics-based VT100 emulators for the Apple II.  Also, beware that 
the program has been known to crash on receipt of some of the more rare 
VT100 sequences.

     When it comes to downloading, Agate supports Zmodem but not Xmodem.  
This is a trifle unusual, but will not be of great importance to the user.  
Agate's poor user interface should earn it a much lower rating, but it gets 
a B from me mostly because of its valiant attempt to use the double hi-res 
screen for character display.


Kermit
""""""
     Computer:  Apple II+, Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc+, Apple IIgs
     VT100 display:  text

     Kermit is a freeware program.  It obeys the Kermit and VT100 
protocols rigorously.  It displays both underline and bold text in inverse 
characters, which can be confusing.  As noted above, it makes it difficult 
to tell where the links are at a glance.  Also, Kermit has a command-line 
interface that makes it a poor choice for the beginning user.

     Kermit supports Xmodem downloading--as well as Kermit, of course.  
Only its rigorous adherence to the standards earns it a C+.

Spectrum
""""""""
     Computer:  Apple IIgs only
     VT100 display:  text

     Spectrum is a commercial program.  While I feel that Spectrum is a 
good telecommunications package overall, its VT100 emulation is truly 
deplorable.  Not only is it text-based (in a GUI program!), but it doesn't 
support either underline or bold text.  If using inverse for both made it 
difficult to navigate with Lynx, using inverse for neither makes it an 
absolute nightmare.  The fact that it consistently drops characters with my 
local host--even after a shift-boot!--doesn't make me feel any better about 
Spectrum's VT100 display.  At least it properly supports the arrow keys.

     Spectrum fares a good deal better in the downloading department.  It 
supports Zmodem and Xmodem, and it is rumored that a Kermit module will 
eventually be available for its latest incarnation.  Frankly, it is only 
Spectrum's use as a general telecom program that prevents it from receiving 
a failing grade for its VT100 emulation instead of the C grade I have 
supplied.

     NOTE FOR SPECTRUM OWNERS:  If you already own Spectrum, the best 
thing to do is give the VT100 mode a miss.  Instead, use the ANSI 
emulation!  This works _very_ well so far as Lynx is concerned.  Don't 
forget to turn color Lynx menus on, though, when you visit GEnie's Internet 
area, if you want to see why I recommend Spectrum's ANSI mode over its 
VT100 mode.

TelCom
""""""
     Computer:  Apple IIgs only
     VT100 display:  text

     TelCom is a freeware program originally intended for use with GNO/ME. 
 It uses inverse for both underline and inverse, and supports Xmodem 
downloading.  It was meant as a bare-bones telecom package, and that's all 
it is.  Rating:  C-.

Talk is Cheap (v4.x)
""""""""""""""""""""
     Computer:  enhanced 128K Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc+, Apple IIgs
     VT100 display:  text

     Talk is Cheap is a commercial program that added VT100 support in its 
most recent version.  It uses inverse text for both bold and underline.  
TIC's VT100 emulation doesn't always clear the screen properly, which is a 
serious flaw when using Lynx.

     As for transfer protocol, Talk is Cheap supports Xmodem but not 
Ymodem.  When it comes to Lynx-ability, it only rates a D.  It hurts me to 
give TIC such a low rating, because I've used it for years and love 
it--overall, it's a good, affordable telecom program--but its VT100 module 
just isn't up to snuff.

ATP
"""
     Computer:  Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc+, Apple IIgs
     VT100 display:  text

     ATP is a shareware program of considerable years.  It uses inverse 
text for both bold and underline, which can be a trial, for the reasons 
discussed.  It makes the problem worse by not having a blinking cursor 
(either box or underscore), so it's very hard to tell exactly what link the 
cursor is resting on!  It doesn't support the arrow keys, and it doesn't 
allow downloading... neither Zmodem nor Xmodem.  As far as using Lynx goes, 
this program is awful:  D.

Z-Link
""""""
     Computer:  Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc+, Apple IIgs
     VT100 display:  text

     This shareware package fails the VT100 test by crashing into the 
monitor when it receives a VT100 initiation sequence.  For that reason, I 
can't tell you whether or not it supports bold or underlined characters.  
Its documentation tells me it supports Xmodem but not Zmodem downloading, 
but avoid it.  Rating:  F.

                                 [*][*][*]


     You should be aware that I haven't mentioned absolutely all the 
Apple II telecommunications software that claims to support VT100, but I've 
tried.  There's a shareware (or possibly freeware) program called GSVT that 
isn't mentioned in this article... because it's not available for download 
on GEnie.  I last saw it on CompuServe years ago.  There's also TMTerm, 
which works under GNO/ME, and I understand that it supports VT100 
display... though I don't think it's technically a telecommunications 
package.  If you know of any program I've missed, I'd be delighted to hear 
from you.

     The revelation that Spectrum's ANSI modem works better for Lynx that 
does its VT100 mode might lead you to try ANSI software for the Apple II 
instead.  Certainly the ANSI modes of both Spectrum and ANSITerm handle 
Lynx quite well.  I am aware of three shareware or freeware ANSI programs 
for the Apple IIgs:  MegaTerm, GenericTerm, and ColorTerm.  None of these 
support downloading.  GenericTerm is probably the best of these three, with 
MegaTerm coming a close second.  You should avoid ColorTerm... its font is 
illegible and it doesn't clear the screen very well  (It also doesn't work 
on a ROM 3 IIgs.)

     If you want to take advantage of GEnie's new Lynx option, my 
recommendation is that you use ANSITerm (VT100 or ANSI mode) or Spectrum 
(ANSI mode, but not VT100) if you have a IIgs, or ProTERM if you don't have 
a IIgs.  If you can't afford one of these commercial packages, I recommend 
SnowTerm for the IIgs or Agate for the IIe and IIc.  In fact, if you're 
absolutely certain you'll never need to download (which is unlikely), I 
recommend SnowTerm, ahead of ANSITerm or Spectrum, for any IIgs user.

     The World Wide Web works a lot like HyperStudio and HyperCard.  If 
you've used either package, you can equate "links" with "buttons", stop 
reading this sidebar right now, and go back to the article. :-)

     When you read a document on the web with Lynx, certain words or 
phrases will be underlined or highlighted (depending on your 
telecommunications software).  These words or phrases indicate links to 
other places on the web.  All you have to do is move your cursor to the 
link, press Return, and you'll be taken to a new place... and probably see 
even more links!

     For example:  imagine every word you see in the text below that has 
[square brackets] around it is a link.

       My name is [Doug Cuff].  I was born in [St. John's], 
       [Newfoundland], [Canada].  I use an [Apple II] computer.

     If you selected "Doug Cuff", you'd get information about me.  If you 
selected "St. John's", you'd get information pertaining to that city.  Same 
deal with the "Newfoundland" and "Canada" links.  If you selected 
"Apple II", you'd see a wide range of information of interest to Apple II 
users.

     The great thing about the web is that links can point to information 
pretty much anywhere.  You don't have to have your Apple II link point to 
information you yourself created... you can have the link point to 
information about the Apple II elsewhere, or even to the web document of 
someone else who's interested in the Apple II!  (No sense reinventing the 
wheel, is there?)

     When using Lynx, the World Wide Web resembles hypertext, with the 
highlighted words and phrases providing links to other areas.  With 
graphics-based tools like Mosaic and Netscape (not yet available for the 
Apple II, remember), the World Wide Web resembles hypermedia, since these 
tools can display graphics as you browse!

     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month, regular columnist 
Charlie Hartley is taking a leave of absence, but he'll be back next month.

     I thought we'd take a closer look this month at some of the "Best of 
A2" disks that A2 RoundTable staff created back in 1991 and 1992.  If this 
column has encouraged you to do any exploring on your own, you'll probably 
have seen these files, which were designed to fit on a single 800K 3.5" 
disk.  Since the short descriptions don't give you much of an idea exactly 
what these archives hold, I thought GEnieLamp A2 should provide detailed 
lists.

     Here are the 9 "Very Best of A2" archives:

     This collection of black and white double hi-res clip art contains 46 
pictures suitable for use with desktop publishing programs such as 
PublishIt! and Graphicwriter III.  The graphics were collected by Tom 
Konczal in December 1991.

     The archive includes a great shareware program called PHOTOMATRIX, 
which allows you to print out single- and double-high resolution graphics 
in condensed form... 30 pictures to a page.  PHOTOMATRIX, by John C. 
Thomason, is the only shareware item on this disk.  The pictures themselves 
are public domain and they may be used for any purpose, without charge.

     Let's look at the pictures, which are divided into 8 categories:  
holidays, military, office, planes, school, ships, sports, and 
miscellaneous.  Each category has its own subdirectory.

                             >>> HOLIDAYS <<<

CANDY.CANE   On the left side of the screen is candy cane wrapped in holly;

COUPLE.DANCE   A man and woman dressed in evening clothes "close" dance;
''''''''''''   they surrounded by bubbles.  There's space for a message to 
the right.

FATHER.TIME   On the left, Father Time with scythe in hand and hourglass at
'''''''''''   his feet; in the lower right corner, a baby, wearing a sash, 
is throwing confetti.  There's space for a message between them.

HAUNT.HOUSE   In the background, a large haunted house with moon and clouds
'''''''''''   overhead, and a few bats; in the foreground, a small 
graveyard; to the left, dead tree with owl sitting in it.

HEARTS.HEART   The outline of this large heart is made of many smaller
''''''''''''   hearts of various sizes.  There's space for a message inside 
the heart.

JACK.O.LATERN   A large jack o'lantern, facing right.

NY.BALLON   A baby clings is lifted aloft by one large balloon and three
'''''''''   small ones; confetti surrounds.  There's space for a message on 
the largest balloon.

SANTA.BEARD   A portrait of Santa, wearing cap, with an extra-large beard
'''''''''''   providing space for Christmas message.

SNOW.MAN   A cute two-stage (one ball for head, second for body) snowman is

     As Charlie would say, that's it for this month.  Keep in mind that 
many pictures have been uploaded since 1991 and 1992, so there are plenty 
excellent pictures in the A2 Library that weren't eligible for inclusion in 
these "Best of" archives.  Charlie will be back next month.  If you bug him 
enough, maybe he'll provide you with descriptions of other "Best of"

June 1995 Report
""""""""""""""""
by David R. Kerwood
        [D.KERWOOD]



     The mission of the Planetary Apple User's Group (PAUG) is to serve as 
the online heart of the worldwide Apple II Community.  PAUG's goals include 
providing help and support for folks who may not have a local group nearby, 
and to create a virtual link between both the online and offline user group 
community.  PAUG sponsorship of an online user group is focused on 
promoting the fact that the Apple II is still alive, and doing very well.

     There _is_ support; PAUG can provide it, or help you find it!  We 
meet the third Sunday of every month at 7:00 pm Eastern in the Apple II 
RoundTable Conference area.  With no dues to pay or miles to drive, PAUG 
offers the Apple II user a friendly and comfortable association with others 
with similar computing interests, plenty of accurate information, hints, 
tips, and the security that comes with knowing that you have all the 
computing support you could possibly need right at your fingertips.  What 
could be more convenient?

THE MAIN EVENTS   It's been some time since we've last put out a 
"""""""""""""""   newsletter, but that has not been for a lack of anything 
to report!  The truth is that there has been a lot of reorganization and 
reshuffling of people associated with PAUG, and with the Apple II 
Roundtables on GEnie.  Things are starting to settle down now, and we're 
certain that you'll like the result.

     To give some idea of the breadth of information and topics that have 
been the hallmark of PAUG meetings, here is a little list of what we've 
been up to, since our initial inception as the World Wide User Group, then 
as the Planetary Apple League, and now as PAUG:

   1993
October  - Inaugural meeting of the then WWUG (now PAUG) - WWUG and 
           Syndicomm, with a visit from Tom Weishaar; and Softdisk/Softdisk 
           G-S, with Bryan Pietrzak
November - Telecommunications and the Apple II
December - Jerry Kindall (Quality Computers), and AppleWorks 4.0

   1994
January  - WWUG becomes PAL; Dave Hecker (Seven Hills), and Spectrum
February - Jawaid Bazyar (Procyon/Sequential), and discQuest
May      - Sam Latella, and the newsletter A2World
June     - Upcoming events at (ICONFest - nee KansasFest)
July     - Highlights and happenings from ICONFest
September- PAL becomes PAUG; User group Open House
October  - Accessing GEnie with the Offline navigators GEM and CoPilot
November - Accessing the Information Superhighway, upcoming GEnie Internet 
           access
December - The sights and sounds of Christmas with Pat Kern (graphics), 
           Tony Morales (Sonobox) and Clay Juniel (GS Entertainment)

   1995
January  - AppleWorks 5.0, with Will Nelken and Randy Brandt
February - User group Open House
March    - Mike Westerfield (ByteWorks), and Quick Click Morph for the IIgs
April    - GEnie's Internet Access
May      - Hypermedia and the IIgs, using HyperCard and HyperStudio

     As you can see, we've been on kind of roll this year, fulfilling our 
mission of serving as the online Apple II user group resource for the 
entire planet!  We have had great guests for many of our meetings, and on 
several occasions have had the honor of hosting new product announcements 
and services.  Our biggest coup came just this past March, with ByteWorks 
choosing the monthly PAUG meeting as its venue for the formal rollout of 
the spectacular new addition to their Quick Click Line of productivity 
applications for the IIgs, Quick Click Morph.  The mighty morphin' power 
ranger for the IIgs, Mike Westerfield, happily proclaimed that the 
generation time to create a typical morph animation on his accelerated IIgs 
was equivalent to what you'd see on a 50 MHz 486 PC clone.  Mike has 
uploaded a demo morph animation to the A2 Library here on GEnie, file 
number 24489 (KARENCAT.BXY).  This jaw-dropping animation shows Mike's 
daughter "morphing" into their family cat, "Psi".  If anything qualifies as 
something well worth the download time, then file #24489 is it--a must see!

     April found PAUG in the enviable position of bringing user group 
support for the largest resource entity now available to the Apple II 
family of computers--the Internet.  All any Apple II user needs now to get 
on the onramp to the "Information Superhighway" is GEnie access.  The PAUG 
meeting went a long way towards illuminating the possibilities now 
available to anyone on GEnie, from gopher, archie, and veronica for 
information searching, and ftp access to worldwide collections of files and 
applications.  Perhaps the most exciting development was the announcement 
that GEnie subscribers would now be able to break into the hottest area of 
the Internet, the World Wide Web, using the text-based navigation tool 
called Lynx.  With Lynx, any Apple II with telecommunications software 
having VT-100 emulation can serve as a window into the vast wealth of 
information available on the 'Web!

     Our most recent PAUG meeting brought a focus to what is possible on 
the Apple IIgs using the two supremely-capable hypermedia authoring tools 
for that platform, HyperCard IIGS (HCGS), from Apple, and HyperStudio, from 
Roger Wagner Publishing.  The need for hypermedia support had become 
particularly apparent since Apple Computer reclassified HCGS as system 
software, which allowed it to be made downloadable from GEnie.  In 
addition, the demise earlier this year of the ICON-based disk publications 
Studio City and Script-Central made the need for support a pressing issue 
for many.  Some of the most interesting stacks available for downloading 
were discussed, as well as tips and hints for those that were interested in 
creating their own stacks.  A good example of the power of hypermedia is 
one very noteworthy HCGS stack that can be used as a program launcher and 
alternative to the Finder.  Called "No Worries", it can best be described 
as a near clone of the popular Macintosh application "At Ease".  It can be 
a lifesaver if your IIgs is available and accessible to small children, or 
for those who want to use the computer but are uncomfortable with The 
Finder.  Formerly shareware, this super stack has been updated and released 
as freeware!  Highly recommended by A2's own resident hypermedia guru 
Hangtime, it can be found in the A2 Library as file #22323.

WHAT'S NEW IN THE APPLE II WORLD?   Things are really hopping with both 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Apple II hardware and software.  In 
addition to the products mentioned above, Sequential has begun shipping 
their VGA card for the Apple IIe and IIgs.  Called Second Sight, this 
relatively inexpensive bundle consisting of a video card and imaging 
software promises to transform computing on the Apple II.  Initial reports 
from those who have installed the card have highly favorable, some to the 
point of near ecstasy! 

     A significant update to the only full-featured desktop 
telecommunications software for the IIgs has been published by Seven Hills 
Software.  Spectrum v2.0 rivals the best telecomm software available for 
any computing platform, and has garnered a loyal following in A2.  When 
combined with the GEnie offline navigator CoPilot, Spectrum has become one 
of the slickest ways for Apple IIgs users to fully utilize GEnie, while 
maintaining their online time (and costs!) at a minimum.  Our own Ken Lucke 
has written a full set of customized CoPilot scripts that take advantage of 
the special features only available in the Spectrum v2.0, and watching 
these scripts do their thing is an eye-opener to anyone who has ever said, 
"You can't do that on an Apple II!"

     Speaking of CoPilot, the latest version of what many consider the 
best GEnie offline navigator available for any platform is now v2.5.5.   
CoPilot, when used with either Talk Is Cheap, ProTERM, or Spectrum, can 
really enhance your online experience on GEnie.  And the very least it will 
do is save you money!  The easiest way to get to it is to choose item #7 
from the A2 Roundtable Menu.

     Randy Brandt has gone on record as saying that he plans to publish at 
least one more update to AppleWorks, now selling well at v5.0 (and v5.1 is 
coming soon!).  But this will be no ordinary update to this very popular 
8-bit integrated program.  Code-named Phoenix, this is not actually an 
update, per se, but an Apple II emulator that will run Appleworks v5.x on 
Macintosh computers.  GEnie, as always, will continue to provide all the 
resources of the A2 subscribers and staff to bear for any of your 
questions, including Phoenix when it's released.  All versions of 
AppleWorks and AppleWorks GS are supported in the Apple II Roundtable on 
GEnie, having an entire category of topics devoted to all facets of these 
highly versatile integrated applications.

     Vitesse has released their fax software for the IIgs. Called 
FAXination, it has also brought a capability to this machine that most had 
never thought would exist.  FAXination has had some significant early 
teething problems in its initial release, but Vitesse has come a long way 
toward making successful send/receive fax capability a reality for the IIgs 
with v1.0.6.  Parkhurst Micro Productions is also working on production of 
fax software for the IIgs, and CEO Paul Parkhurst has announced that the 
package is going into beta-testing, with an anticipated release later this 
year.

     And one more bit of hardware news of note--there is a removable media 
drive that has just recently hit the market that has gotten many in the 
Apple II community to sit up and take notice.  While it was not originally 
intended to be used as an Apple II peripheral, the Iomega "Zip" drive is a 
SCSI device that uses ejectable 100 or 25 megabyte disks, and it has been 
checked out by several of the GEnie subscribers in A2.  The bottom line?  
It works, and works quite well.  With a typical retail price of about $200, 
and media cost of about $20 per 100 MByte disk (each about the size of a 
thick 3.5" floppy disk), the Iomega "Zip" drive has been found to be a cost 
effective method for backing up your data, as well as being able to be used 
as a removable hard drive, much like a SyQuest unit.  The Zip Drive 
recently was the topic of a Real Time Conference (RTC), which was replete 
with detailed information on how to use this drive with the Apple II.  Want 
to know more?  Well, we archived the RTC for you, just download file #25002 
(IOMEGA.ZIP.BXY) for the straight story.  If you're not familiar with 
GEnie's Real Time Conference, this transcript will give you a good idea of 
what the RTCs are all about.  Check it out!

WHAT'S NEW IN GENIE'S A2 ROUNDTABLE?   As I mentioned earlier, there has 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   been quite a lot going on as far as 
our own internal reorganization is concerned.  Here is the new breakdown of 
the main movers and shakers on the A2 staff, and their positions.  
Remember, they are here to serve you, and to make your time on GEnie as 
enjoyable and productive as it can possibly be!

     Our Chief of Apple II Operations (A2 and A2Pro):

       Lunatic E'Sex       Chief of Apple II Operations    A2.LUNATIC

     The Apple II RoundTable Staff:

       Susan MacGregor     Chief Sysop                     A2.SUSAN
         Tim Tobin         Assistant Chief Sysop           A2.TIM
       Charlie Hartley     Bulletin Board Manager          A2.CHARLIE
         Sarah Phillips    BB Assistant Manager            S.PHILLIPS1
         Doug Cuff         BB Assistant Manager            EDITOR.A2

       Richard Bennett     Special Projects                RICHARD.B
       Loren Damewood      A2 Help Desk                    LORENZO
       Bill Dooley         Internet Access                 A2.BILL
       Harold Hislop       Hardware Coordinator & Guru     HAROLD.H

       Tim Tobin           Lost Classics/Fonts             A2.TIM
 
     Quite possibly the biggest thing on the minds of the staffers in A2 
is the upcoming KansasFest.  What?  You thought Kfest was history since 
A2-Central ceased operations?  Think again, Chester.  Kfest is going to be 
a reality this summer, and it'll be better than ever!  For many years 
Resource Central, and then ICON, sponsored a popular festival for Apple II 
computer users called ICONference.  Last year the festival was expanded to 
include users of Macintosh computers.  Although RC/ICON went away, KFest 
will continue under new sponsorship!  This summer, in Kansas City, 
Missouri, you can once again:

  - meet friends old and new
  - learn about how to get the most out of your computer and peripherals
  - see demonstrations of new products
  - meet the celebrities of our little world 
  - experience the InterNet and all that it has to offer to us and our 
    computers
  - take advantage of special KFest '95 offers from Apple II and Macintosh 
    vendors
  - and, of course, stay up all night if you want to :)
 
There will be speakers and presentations on a wide variety of topics. 
Presentations scheduled (so far) include:
 
 * Joe Kohn - Shareware Solutions II
 * Erick Wagner - How to Control Real World Devices
 * Michael Lutynski - Animasia
 * Mike Westerfield - Quick Click Morph and HyperStuff
 * Tony Diaz - Building a case for the GS
 * Roger Wagner - HyperStudio
 * Greg Templeman - GSLib
 * Richard Bennett and J. Nathaniel Sloan - GS front end for GEnie
 * Doug Pendleton and Dave Ciotti - Solder, the Flux of the Matter
 * Ryan Suenaga - PDA's and PowerBooks - Portability for the Professional
 
     KFest '95 will again be held on the campus of Avila College in Kansas 
City, Missouri.  It will take place from July 27-29, 1995.  The cost will 
be only $200, which _includes_ use of a double room in the Avila College 
dorms _and_ meals!   (If you wish to stay at one of the many hotels or 
motels near the college then the cost is $150, but you would, of course, 
have to find and pay for your own room).
 
     Kfest this year is being sponsored by Parkhurst Micro Products, 
makers of the award-winning ANSITerm telecommunications software, as well 
as the soon to be released PMPFax.  You can send your registration form and 
fee to:

THE A2 LIBRARY   The following files are the "pick of the crop" for May, 
""""""""""""""   and can be found in the Apple II Roundtable library.  A 
"+" before the number indicates it can be used on an 8 bit Apple.

are relatively new to GEnie. Even experienced hands may find these useful 
as well.

IN CONCLUSION   Remember, the goal of the Planetary Apple User Group is to 
"""""""""""""   be _your_ primary Apple II resource!  If you have any 
suggestions, insights, or ways to help us help you...let us _know_!  Future 
plans include working with groups on the "outside" to create a stronger 
bond within the Apple II community.  Just E-mail C.ADAMS11 or A2.GENA, or 
post in Category 3, Topic 34 in the A2 bulletin board (m645;1).
