Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     You'd think this would be an easy editorial to write:  I don't drink, 
so I can't possibly be hung over.  However, thoughts of the year just past 
and possibilities for the future keep distracting me.

     If you hang out around GEnie's A2 RoundTable, you already know that 
programmer Bill Tudor offered a holiday special on his shareware:  pay just 
$10, and you're considered to be registered for a double handful of 
programs.  Sure, this sort of offer shows that GEnie is the place to be, 
but it also makes me excited about the potential of an online service.  
Shareware programmers can offer time-limited specials almost as soon as 
they think of it!  No lead-time, no delays here.

     What about the future?  Well, columnist Charlie Hartley tells me that 
GEnieLamp A2's immediate future includes a profile of yours truly.  Gulp.  
I'm a little uneasy about the whole concept of the media making the news.  
As Albert Brooks's character, AARON, gibes in the movie _Broadcast News_, 
"Yes, please; let's never forget--we're the real story, not them."  Far be 
it from _me_ to suggest that Charlie is scraping the bottom of the 
barrell.... <grin>  As you'll see next time folks, I haven't really done 
anything worth profiling....

     Okay, what about the REAL future?  Well, as of this writing, it seems 
that Spectrum v2.0 is getting ready for release, and there's some hope that 
we might see a new version of GraphicWriter III in 1995 too.  Here's hoping 
we'll also see the Second Sight and TurboRez video cards this year as well.

     Also, several products were released--and, as usual, announced--last 
month.  Not even counting the long-awaited AppleWorks 5!  You can read all 
about it in HEY MISTER POSTMAN.

     Apple Computer officially stopped supporting the Apple II in 1993, 
over a year ago.  1994 was NOT the year the Apple II died.  With 
third-party products -- hardware, no less! -- still in development, it 
doesn't look as though 1995 will be one long wake, either.

A TWO-BUTTON MOUSE   oh, btw, something a lot of people don't know...
""""""""""""""""""   
     anyone who has a ROM 03 GS has a two-button mouse ;) The "mouse keys" 
feature built into the ROM 03 supports both mouse buttons... "5" is the 
first button, with "0" and "." locking and unlocking it.  But "-" is the 
SECOND mouse button, with "=" and "/" locking and unlocking it! :)

     (This is documented on page 148 of the GS Hardware Ref, 2nd 
edition...  I found it accidently once and I think it's cool :)

APPLEWORKS ON UNIX?   I don't know whether someone needs this kinda 
"""""""""""""""""""   information, but anyway here it goes:

     Yesterday I transferred an AppleWorks 4.0 DB file to a Unix machine 
using the BlueDisk controller and a MS-DOS disk.  I printed the DB file to 
disk as ASCII file, copied it to a MS-DOS disk with the MS-DOS utilities, 
put the disk into the drive of the Unix system.  Using the command "dosdir 
a:" I got a listing of the files and using "doscp a:*.* /pathname/here" I 
copied the files from the disk to the location where I wanted them.  Worked 
like a charm.  I'm now trying to do something useful with these data on the 
Unix machine...

MACRO CHALLENGE
"""""""""""""""
     ()      Defenders of the faith! 
     ||      ======================= 
     () 
 [==={} ===]   A plea for rescue from an 
     ||       errant knight in distress! 
     ||  
     ||   Help me to vanquish the 
     ||   omnipresent and obnoxious foe! 
     ||      
     \/ 

     Ok, ok, now that I'm done with melodramatic introduction, let me 
explain exactly how I put my foot in my mouth, and what help I need to 
extract it. 

     On a local Apple-centric board bulletin board, where I normally post 
news that I find here on Genie, I was letting everyone know how wonderful 
Appleworks 5.0 was going to be, and how Apple II users could now have all 
the power that MAC and PC users have with such programs as Word, etc. 

     In fact, I claimed, Ultramacros provides even _More_ power  to the 
average user than the macro utility in Word (WordBasic).  (I firmly believe 
this to be true, by the way, based on things like GEM and other fancy 
macros I've seen.) 

     Well, wouldn't you know, someone called my bluff, and claimed that 
wordbasic was more powerful than Ultramacros, to which I naturally 
countered: "Ha! I can do anything in Ultramacros that you can do in 
wordbasic!"  

     He replied:

     >Simple challenge, write a macro that will provide
     >detailed system information about your computer and OS.
     >   Information should include Computer/CPU type,
     >available RAM, available harddisk space, total
     >system RAM....

     Now my problem is, while I'm pretty sure that UM can handle this, I'm 
not so sure _I_ can, hence the localized epidemic of hoof-in-mouth. 

     Here's what I've figured so far, for the items my opponent  
specified.  I'd appreciate any tidbits of advice on exact peek locations or 
calls that might be useful for the other stuff that I haven't figured out. 

     Available RAM:  x:<all msg "There are " + str$ peek #freemem + " 
kilobytes of free memory left for desktop operations. "! 

     Available hard disk space:  I think I have this one licked.  I just 
had the macro go back to the Main Menu; Other Activities; List the Files, 
and read the line about "/Hard2/  has 2314K of desktop memory available" 
into a variable.  Not elegant, but it satisfies the requirement.

     Here's where I'm having trouble:
     Computer/CPU type:
     y:<all x = peekword {something} >!  <== What address do I  need to 
tell me what type of Apple II I have? 

     Total system RAM: Same thought/solution as above.

     I figure there has got to be a way to do this with a couple of peeks. 
I would appreciate any tips;  Thanks!    :)

color and the high nibble the background color. Have fun!

NOW _THAT'S_ A NON-STANDARD ROM!   Does anyone recognize...? My brother 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   recently picked up a Woz Edition GS with

APPLEWORKS TO RICH TEXT FORMAT   The AppleWorks to RTF program is designed

their AppleWorks word processor files on the Mac/DOS platforms.

     The program is a Mac application which will convert files from a 3.5" 
ProDOS disk* to Microsoft's Rich Text Format or ASCII text.  With RTF 
formatting, your formatting is maintained (i.e. bold, underline,  
proportional, subscript, superscript, etc.)

     The program requires System 7 or later.

     We have added this topic in the Apple II area since AppleWorks users  
are here.  Since the program is designed to extend the life of AppleWorks 
in the home/educational market we felt it appropriate to support users 
here.

     To convert files from ProDOS disks you need to have the ProDOS file 
extension or System 7.5 on the Mac.  Otherwise, you need to use Apple File 
Exchange to put your files on a Mac disk.

The first group are those who have AppleWorks files and for whatever reason 
upgraded to a Mac platform and would like to use their files in the Mac 
word processors.  The second group includes those who have Apple IIs at 
home and Macs at work.  They can create documents at home in the best word 
processor ever written (AppleWorks) and then save  their formatting and use 
the files in programs like Microsoft Word or PageMaker.

     We chose the Microsoft Rich Text Format since it would allow us to 
save as much of the original AppleWorks format as possible.  RTF is also 
imported by almost every word processor on Mac, DOS, and Windows.

AppleWorks to RTF can convert files in batches so you can take a disk of 
AppleWorks files and convert them all in one fell swoop.  In time 
comparisons with ClarisWorks, and AppleWorks to RTF was always 10 to 20 
times faster for conversion.

     Requirements: The files to be converted must be on a mounted disk 
avail- able to a Mac.  This could be on a server, floopy disk, or hard 
drive. If you are using a Mac LC with the //e card, you can use the ProDOS 
file extension to mount ProDOS disks on the Mac or if you have System 7.5 
you can mount ProDOS disks by inserting them.  The third alternative is to 
use Apple File Exchange to move the files from ProDOS disks to a Mac disk.  
Once there, AppleWorks to RTF will read them.

SCSI-2 CD-ROM SCSI DRIVER   Sequential is pleased to announce the release 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   of a new SCSI-2 CDROM device driver for the 
Apple High Speed SCSI card.

     Recognizing that a large number of discQuest customers purchased 
SCSI-2 CDROM drives (such as Quality's Q-Drive CD) that don't fully work 
with the Apple SCSI card, we endeavored to produce a  device driver for 
these customers.

     The driver allows software to access the full range of SCSI-2 Audio 
Control commands, which means that software such as discQuest will be able 
to utilize the CD audio features of SCSI-2 drives.

     Included with the Device Driver is a Media Control Toolkit driver, 
which allows the user to play regular audio CD discs via a "control panel".

     The cost of the driver is a mere $24.95, and is available from  
Sequential Systems.

APPLE II RT STAFF CHANGEOVER   I'm pleased to announce a number of changes 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   in day-to-day management of the Apple II RTs 
here on GEnie.  Effective immediately, Susan MacGregor (A2.SUSAN) will 
become Chief Sysop of the A2 RT.  Please congratulate her.  Moving into 2nd 
in command in A2 would be our own Tom Zuchowski (T.ZUCHOWSKI).  I am 
further pleased to announce that Lunatic E'Sex will be taking over as 
Syndicomm's Chief of Apple II Operations on GEnie, with general  oversight 
of both A2 and A2Pro.  (In case there is any confusion, HangTime will 
remain as A2Pro Chief Sysop.)  Another change we might as well mention is 
that, given that Susan is no longer available as A2 RTC Manager, that spot 
will have to be filled.  I'm happy to say that our own Gena Saikin has 
agreed to step into that role.  All this will correspond with Gary Utter 
fading, with me, a bit more into the background, though we'll always still 
be here and watching over what happens.

NEW REAL-TIME CHAT SOFTWARE   There will be new RTC Software deployed 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   throughout GEnie on Monday 12/5. Here is a 
summery of the changes you'll see.  How RTC's work won't change much, but 
most RTC scripts will need to be updated.

o The city name has been removed from the system.  Only the state appears.

o Both the /SHOW and /WHO commands now additionally show the GE Mail 
  address.

o The user is prompted to enter a name (nickname) upon entry into the RTC.  
  The email address is no longer used as part of the "prepend string".  It 
  works very much like the chat system.

o The /STAtus command now shows the mail address and the nickname.

o Upon entry into the RTC a list of rooms, the number of users in the room 
  and the room name are displayed to the user.  This information is 
  displayed only for rooms which have at least one user in them or rooms 
  which have a "text delivery" active in them.

o The /USE command has been modified to display the name of the room as 
  well as the room number and user count.  /USE * shows ALL rooms.

o The /RAIse command may only be issued once until the meeting leader has 
  recognized the user.  If tried again the user will receive an informative 
  message giving the position of their hand in the "hand queue".

o The /XRAise command is used to "lower" the hand.

o There is a new /EMAIL command which works similar to the /JOB command. 
  This command causes the GE Mail address to be added to the message. The 
  /XEMAIL command will remove the GE Mail address.  The default is no email 
  address.

SPECTRUM TIDBITS   Arthur -- You could email your order and say "please
""""""""""""""""   backorder until SPv2.0 is shipping" so you can get the 
special price for v2.0 (which we hope to ship this month).

     We've made improvements to the VT100 display, but have mainly been 
focusing on Spectrum itself. Because the displays are separate entities, 
they can be updated separately and dropped into a special folder, so YES it 
is very possible that there will be a VT220 display available in the future 
(planning for Q1 1995, and it would probably be posted here on GEnie so it 
would be free (except for minimal download time).

component we can write that separate from Spectrum and post it online as

Message 113       Tue Dec 13, 1994
T.SMITH59 [Terrell]          at 22:48 EST

 
I posted the following at the office, just to make some people nervous.  :)

                       -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

                   Frequently asked questions about the
                       Intel Pentium chip problems.

1. I've heard that the Intel Pentium chip has a serious bug.

   Just because IBM is refusing shipment of the Pentium is no cause for 
   alarm.  Your computer will continue to work the same way it always has.

2. Can I still use my computer for everyday tasks?

   Yes!  As long as you use it for entertainment or games, there is nothing 
   to worry about.  The bug only affects math.

3. Can I trust my computer to do math calculations correctly?

   Yes!  The bug only affects higher math such as rocket science, 
   construction engineering, air traffic control, government accounting, 
   balancing a checkbook, or preparing income taxes.  As long as you avoid 
   such projects, you have nothing to worry about.

4. I've heard that this only affects numbers at the ninth decimal place and 
   beyond.

   Try this: use the windows calculator to divide 4,195,835 by 3,145,727. 
   The correct answer is 1.333820449+.  The Pentium shows the incorrect 
   answer of 1.333739068902.  The error is in the forth place.  This should 
   not be a problem for most users, unless you use the forth decimal place 
   for calculations, such as for interest rates.

5. What about other machines with an "Intel Inside"?  Are they affected as 
   well?

   No, this bug only affects Pentiums.  To prove it to yourself, go the 
   Windows calculator and enter -2.01, then add 2.0.  The answer, of 
   course, should be -.01.  Only if you get something else should you 
   worry.

                       -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     One guy at work tried the simple math problem above on a big 486 
system and got 0.00 for an answer.  "Hey!" he said, and tried it again.  
"Thank you," I said, "You just made my day."  As I walked away smiling, he 
came chasing after me. "Why does it do that?!" he wanted to know.  I 
smiled, "I have no idea.  I don't use an Intel machine.  I use one that 
works."  And with a big grin, returned to my desk, leaving this poor guy 
dancing around about his 486, because it can't do simple math.  :)

     They are smart people - smart enough to know when fun is being poked 
at them.  :)

     They already don't like the fact that I use an Apple at work - policy 
is "IBM compatible only."  This is to optimize resources and training.  I 
argued that I had my Apple already, and thus was able to "get it in," but 
was told, "We will not support it."  To which I gladly agreed.

     I was told that the Apple II could not "do anything," it was just for 
games. I was told the Apple would not hook up to the VAX main-frame.  (It 
is).  I was told that it would need to be connected at 9600 baud, and they 
didn't think it was able to do that - it's hooked to the VAX at 19,200). I 
was the first person in the building to have a scanner (a Quickie).  I was 
the first to use OCR.  (Hey, that can't be done!!!)  (The director of MIS 
went out and bought a flatbed scanner and OCR software after seeing what I 
was doing.)  I was the first to print PostScript files (after talking to 
them for years about getting a PS capable printer.)  (Apples can't do 
that!)  I was the first to print bar codes with addresses on letters to 
take advantage of cheap postal rates.

     I'm the one they come to to convert MS-DOS files to MAC, or MAC to 
MS-DOS (for outside graphics people).(No I don't convert them on my //e, I 
also have a MAC, which I almost never use.)

     They still don't like my "lowly //e" - but it is tolerated.  :)

what's available and waiting for you in the bulletin board area.

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Phil Shapiro
   [P.SHAPIRO1]



                >>> SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT ONLINE ROMANCE <<<
                """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Finding a lifelong partner has never been easy.  Most single persons 
just don't get to meet a lot of other folk in their day to day life.

     A lot of couples meet through social circles, or at work.  But even 
these circles remain rather small.  If you add up all the people in your 
social circles, and all the people you might encounter at work, the number 
rarely rises above 40 or 50.

     Choosing a life partner from a pool of 50 persons is indeed 
intimidating.  The chances are small of your connecting up with someone 
whose interests and values are closely similar to yours.

     How might online communications serve to increase the number of 
possible romantic encounters?  Let me count the ways.

Online Resumes   First is the use of "online resumes."  Various electronic 
""""""""""""""   bulletin boards and online services give members a place 
to say a few words about their background and interests.  (Important note:  
These "online resumes" bear little resemblance to the formal resumes people 
use when job hunting. "Online resumes" tend to be quite informal, 
unstructured -- almost playful.)

     Browsing through a collection of online resumes can provide for an 
interesting "people watching" activity.  The words people use to describe 
their interests speaks volumes about the person as an individual.

     Crafting an online resume can actually be a lot of fun.  If you take 
the time to embellish the resume in just the right way, you may very well 
connect up with others of similar ilk.

     The neat thing about most online resumes is that they're not limited 
in length.  People can use 50 words, 500 words, or 5000 words to write 
their own online resume.

Online Dialogues   The second facet of online courtship is the "online 
""""""""""""""""   dialogue."  The online dialogue usually gets rolling 
with one person innocuously sending a "hi there" message to someone they 
admire.  The person receiving the message then innocuously sends a short 
but friendly reply.  Soon a regular innocuous e-mail exchange evolves.  And 
before either person knows it, both persons get to know each other without 
any of the risks or embarrassments of going out on a date.

     And consider this.  Both parties in the above hypothetical could be 
actively involved online with a dozen other potential partners.  Compare 
this to the difficulty of juggling five or six dates in the real world.

     So online communications can both broaden the pool of persons who you 
might interact with in the first place, and then it can allow you to 
"dialogue" with two or three times the number of people you might be able 
to fit into your dating schedule.  Some of these "dialogues" will seem more 
self-sustaining than others.  Those that aren't as self-sustaining will 
naturally peter out.

Online References   Say two persons who met online individually came to the 
"""""""""""""""""   realization that they were meant for one another.  
Would it not be useful for each of them to communicate with long-time 
friends of each other?  Such communications could help reduce the number of 
unwelcome surprises.

     For instance, Elizabeth could ask one of Robert's long-time friends 
to tell a bit about Robert's past.  Robert's friends might reply with 
something along the lines of:  "I've known Robert for close to 15 years 
now.  Swell guy.  A real charmer.  In my view he would make for an 
excellent husband -- except for the fact that he's wanted for polygamy in 
seven states." [Or possibly "He'd make an excellent husband.  In fact, he's 
already done so.  Seven times.  Simultaneously!"--Ed.]

Creating More "Matches That Fit"   The concept of online courtships may 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   seem amusing and whimsical to some, but 
the hard truth is that divorce rates continue their upward rise.  If online 
communications can help foster more "matches that fit," then society as a 
whole benefits in immeasurably large ways.  After all, the union of two 
human beings is the fundamental unit of our society.

     When two human beings connect up to form a committed partnership, the 
union itself creates positive ripples throughout society.

     The next time your modem connects to a bulletin board or information 
service, take a moment to reflect upon the meaning of the word "CONNECT" 
that appears on your screen.  The word refers not only to the physical 
process of modems connecting with each other.  It refers to the meaningful 
human connections that are about to unfold.

Some Thoughts on The Apple II as an Equity Computer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Phil Shapiro
   [P.SHAPIRO1]



     A 1993 study found that Apple II computers comprised 41 percent of 
the 4.5 million computers in our nations schools. (Electronic Learning, 
9/94, p. 10.)  This works out to be 1,845,000 computers.

     (Picture them lined up side by side along a highway.  Assuming that 
each computer is about two feet wide, 1,845,000 computers lined up along 
the highway would stretch for 698 miles -- 184500 times 2 feet divided by 
5280 feet per mile.  That means you would have to drive for over 11 hours, 
at 60 miles per hour, to travel from one end of the Apple II's to the 
other.)

     As the more affluent schools in our nation decide to equip their 
computer labs with Macs and Power Macs, large numbers of Apple II computers 
will come available on the second-hand market.  Along with the computers 
themselves will come huge quantities of second-hand Apple II educational 
programs.  (Unless you have Apple IIe emulation cards in your Macs, the 
software is worth nothing without the computers.)

     This mass abandonment of Apple II's by affluent schools is actually a 
cloud with a silver lining.  The silver lining is that thousands upon 
thousands of Apple II's will soon become available to schools in lower 
income areas, to church-run afterschool enrichment programs, homeless 
shelters, adult literacy centers, children's hospitals, children's museums, 
public libraries, and ordinary working class families.  Hundreds of Apple 
II's may also head overseas to developing countries whose teachers have 
long dreamed of setting up a computer lab.

     The concept of computer equity was brought home to me recently when I 
received a phone call from a family in rural West Virginia.  This family 
needed help getting the best use of their Apple II+ computer.  I learned 
that they had bought this inexpensive computer to use with their three 
children.  A few minutes of my time was all that was needed to help send 
them in the right direction.

     It turns out that their Apple II+ had 48K of RAM, rather than 64K.  
So I sent them an extra 16K language card I had, giving them the chance to 
use a broader range of educational programs.  A second incident, just last 
week, reinforced the notion of the Apple II's emergence as an equity 
computer:  an Apple II enthusiast in the local user group mentioned to me 
that he bought an entire Apple IIe system for $25 at a garage sale.

     An exciting new era of educational computing is upon us.  Wozniak's 
original dream to create a computer that virtually anyone could afford is 
finally coming true.

     Persons knowledgeable about the Apple II are in a unique position to 
be of service.  They can help advise people on where to turn to buy 
software, parts, peripherals, and supplies for their Apple II.  They can 
help people learn where they might look to get broken Apple II's repaired.  
They can help people learn to trouble-shoot broken computers, and help to 
understand which of the programs that came with their computer can be put 
to good use.  Using the Internet, they can help match up those with 
computers they'd like to sell with organizations, schools, or families with 
computers they'd like to buy.

     What type of time commitment would be involved in providing such 
assistance?  Not much.  You might have to answer a few phone calls.  If the 
charitable organization, family, or school were in your general area, you 
might visit them once or twice in person.

     What are the rewards for getting involved with such volunteering?  
Helping the less fortunate can be "emotionally lucrative."  Similar to 
Peace Corps work, you walk away immeasurably richer when you give of 
yourself to others.

     The picture you might want to conjure up in your mind is an Apple II 
sitting on child's desk in a trailer park in South Carolina.  Or an Apple 
II providing a measure of intellectual stimulation in a battered women's 
shelter in Wisconsin.  Or an Apple II sitting in the center of a rural 
mountaintop school in Jamaica.  Or an Apple II set up for public access in 
the library in Jackson, Mississippi.

     All of these things can and will happen.  Those of use who care about 
equity issues can see to it that these computers get used in the best way 
possible.  Wozniak's dream, the "micro-millennium," is finally coming true.  
All the dream needs is a little nudging by you and me.

                   >>> WELCOME TO THE TREASURE HUNT <<<
                   """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     This month I want to take time out to highlight what I consider to be 
the best of all the files described in the 1994 Treasure Hunt columns.  
Selecting these was not easy, and I am certain that others would have made 
other choices, but nevertheless, here they are.  They are listed in the 
order in which they appeared in the various Treasure Hunt columns beginning 
with the first column in April 1994.

           NOWORRIES13.BXY     File #22323     (HyperCard Stack)
           '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This HyperCard stack was created by Brendan Bellina.  He describes it 
this way:

     "No Worries v1.3.0 is a HyperCard GS stack that allows the launching 
of GS/OS, ProDOS, Applesoft BASIC programs, as well as opening other 
stacks, New Desk Accessories, and Documents, all within an environment that 
is very similar in appearance to the Macintosh At Ease software.  Includes 
security to protect against unauthorized addition/deletion of applications 
buttons.  Earlier versions published in Script-Central.  This is the first 
freeware release."

     If you need security to prevent others from messing with the computer 
settings (school children messing with the control panels for example), 
this stack provides a straight forward way to do that.  It uses a single 
system password that restricts the user to running the programs that are 
already set up in the stack, unless he has the password.

     At the same time it gives you a point and click format for choosing 
programs to run.  Setting up the stack for these programs is easy.  For 
example, if you want to run HyperStudio from this stack, pull down the "No 
Worries" menu and select "set up mode."  Then pull it down again and select 
"Link to GS/OS Application."  From there you will select the location of 
the HyperStudio file from the standard dialogue menu.  Once you have it 
located, an icon will appear on the screen.  Drag the icon to where you 
want it.  It will now appear complete with the name of the program. 
Clicking on it will take you to HyperStudio.  Quitting HyperStudio will 
return you to this stack.

     It is also possible to link to ProDOS applications (system files), to 
BASIC programs (requires BASIC.SYSTEM), other stacks, documents (linked to 
GS/OS applications), and various menu commands.

     If you need security, and/or if you really like the look and feel of 
"At Ease," then this stack will be a good download for you.  If, like me, 
you don't need security, then you probably don't want it.

     If you decide to download this stack, be sure to become familiar with 
it before you apply the password protection.  Also, be sure to read all the 
good information provided in the help screens.  To get to them, select 
"help" from the "No Worries" menu.

     By the way, Brendan was the professor at a recent A2 University 
course on HyperCard GS over in the A2Pro Roundtable.  To learn more about 
the course, visit their library and search on "HyperCard."

                       Button School (by Bill Lynn)
                       ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Bill Lynn is a master at creating neat HyperStudio stacks.  This 
stack is an excellent tutorial on creating animated buttons for your 
stacks.

     Bill begins by explaining basic button drawing, and continues with 
five additional lessons that detail how to create a variety of button 
styles.  Included are momentary pushbuttons that appear to be pressed and 
then released, momentary flashing pushbuttons that do the same but with a 
change in color, latching pushbuttons and lighted latching pushbuttons that 
stay down until you click outside the button area, and finally lighted 
latching/reset pushbuttons that display a pattern of buttons.  In this last 
case, the button stayed depressed until another button in the array is 
pressed.

     This is file #17302, titled BUTN.SCHOOL.BXY.  It contains only 63,616 
bytes.  This is a must-have stack if you want to learn how to create your 
own buttons for your stacks.

                      Animation School (by Bill Lynn)
                      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Bill Lynn has also created a comprehensive tutorial on "cel" 
animation in this stack.  Learn how to create your own animations by 
following his examples.

     This is an updated version of the original stack first published on 
Stack-Central.  It takes advantage of the new features of HyperStudio 3.0 
and later versions.

     Bill first teaches you how to create a flower in bloom with expanding 
petals.  Next, he describes how to do a paddle ball in motion animation.  
He also teaches you how to create your own "dialog boxes" and how to use 
masks to create large scale animation.

     This is a $5 shareware product.  It is file #18907, titled 
ANIMSCH3.0.BXY, containing 367,360 bytes.  Expect it to take about 34 
minutes to download at 2400 baud.

        Pat Kern's Favorite Print Shop Graphics, Fonts, and Borders
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Here we will take a look at some of the ones that Pat calls her 
personal favorites.  All of these files are public domain.

     Not surprisingly, Pat is fond of the "Southwest" files created for 
the AzApple User Group (Phoenix, Arizona).  She was very much involved with 
this group until she returned to Chicago.

     The Southwest print shop uploads were the signature graphics 
collection of the AzApple User Group public domain library. The full list 
is given below.

File#  File name             Short Description

17103  STHWEST1.PS.BXY       Southwest Print Shop graphics.
17104  STHWEST2.PS.BXY       Southwest Print Shop graphics.
17105  STHWEST3.PS.BXY       Southwest Print Shop graphics.
17106  STHWEST4.PS.BXY       Southwest Print Shop fonts/brds.

17491  SWAZ.NPS.BXY          Southwest graphics,fonts,borders for 3.5.
17492  SWAZ.1.NPS.BXY        Southwest New Print Shop for 5.25.
17493  SWAZ.2.NPS.BXY        Southwest New Print Shop for 5.25.
17494  SWAZ.3.NPS.BXY        Southwest New Print Shop for 5.25.
17495  SWAZ.4.NPS.BXY        Southwest New Print Shop for 5.25

     Since these are so similar, we will concentrate on the original 
Classic Print Shop stuff. 

     STHWEST1.PS.BXY contains 62 Print Shop graphics that have a 
southwestern, cowboy, or wild west theme to them.  My personal favorites on 
this disk are Siesta (a Mexican in a large sombrero napping), Roadrunner, 
Wagon 01 (covered wagon), Stagecoach, and Campfire. There are also a number 
of horse graphics, cute Native American graphics, and cowboy graphics.

     STHWEST2.PS.BXY contains 60 Print Shop grahics that continue the 
southwestern theme. There are 12 different "Sun" graphics and 8 "Horse" 
graphics.  My favorites are Indian 06 which is almost a portrait of an 
Native American brave, and Indian 08 which portrays an attractive Native 
American woman.

     STHWEST3.PS.BXY contains 67 more Print Shop graphics.  If you are 
looking for Print Shop graphics of the states of the Southwest, get this 
one.  It includes a graphic of the entire region, as well as individual 
graphics of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and 
Utah. These are very well done. Probably my favorite graphic on the disk is 
"Gracias" which looks just like Teddy Roosevelt during his Rough Rider 
days.

     STHWEST4.PS.BXY contains 29 borders and 33 fonts files.  The border 
files are all in the Southwestern theme. My personal favorite is Longhorn. 
The fonts include the following regular fonts (uppercase, numbers, 
punctuation): Angeles, Austin, Berkeley, Catus, California, Carmel, 
Cupertino, Dallas, Hollywood, Hombre, Houston, Lamoni, San.Diego, 
Santamonic, Seattle, Sierra, Slim, Texas, Tombstone, Utah, and Vegas. There 
are 4 font sets that include lowercase letters, numbers and punctuation 
marks. They are LCDallas, LCMonica, LCSierra, and LCTexas. 

     The best fonts on the disk include both uppercase and lowercase 
letters along with a limited group of punctuation marks.  They include 
AAngles, ABerkeley, ACupertino, ADallas, AHombre, AMonica, APalo.Alto, and 
ASierra.

     There is also a text file on the disk titled INFO.FONTS that tells 
you how to access this last group of fonts.  Since it may be a bit 
difficult for some to access that file, it is reproduced below.

          These Print Shop compatible fonts allow the user to combine 
     Uppercase with Lowercase.  Letters from the keyboard produce 
     lowercase.  You will not be able to use numbers & most 
     punctuation, since those characters are used for the uppercase, 
     so if you want to include addresses, phone numbers, dates, 
     prices, etc. use another font.  Use the following substitutions 
     for uppercase letters:

     A  1         F  6          K  -         P  &         U  ;
     B  2         G  7          L  =         Q  *         V  :
     C  3         H  8          M  #         R  (         W  "
     D  4         I  9          N  $         S  )         X  <
     E  5         J  0          O  %         T  +         Y  >
                                                          Z  /

     Only certain punctuation can be used as follows:  .  ,  '  ?  !

          With most programs, the number or punctuation will appear 
     on the monitor.  It will look strange, but will print out OK.  
     Trust me.  With LLL program, WYSIWYG.

          You may want to print out the above substitutions and keep 
     it in the disk jacket for reference.  It will save you time.


     Pat has uploaded several files that help you to create attractive 
greeting cards as well as emboss a variety of things.  Here are some files 
you may want to download.

20818     EMBOSS.HINT.TXT    Hints for embossing


     PI.GREETING.BXY, which requires Publish It, was created by Vivian 
Lynes for AzApple User Group Journal.  It explains how to create a greeting 
card using the Publish It program.  Just load the document into Publish It 
and print it out to one page.  The upload also includes a greeting card 
template to use in creating your own cards.

     PI.EMBOSS.BXY, which also requires Publish It, is a tutorial by 
Vivian Lynes that tells how to emboss using computer printouts.  The layout 
was prepared by Pat Kern for AzApple Journal. To see this correctly, 
install the fonts Florence.12 and Florence.24 (included in upload) before 
printing.

     EMBOSS.HINT.TXT is a short text file giving some hints for embossing 
computer-generated greeting cards & even bank checks (for gift giving).  
Can be listed & captured in your copy buffer or downloaded as an ascii text 
file.

      TO.PERPCAL.BXY   File #22882    9472 bytes    AppleWorks Macros
      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
               Perpetual Calendar macros 1.3 [12 June 1994]
                  freeware -- copyright 1994 by Doug Cuff
  algorithm partly based on an Applesoft BASIC program by ANTHONY DEBOER

     Doug Cuff [EDITOR.A2] has produced a neat little AppleWorks macro 
package.  In his long description, Doug says that this is a compact, 
memory-only perpetual calendar for AppleWorks.  It contains TimeOut menu 
file for users and macro source code for programmers.  It requires the 
built-in UltraMacros player or UltraMacros 4.2 or later.

     The download includes 4 files. TO.CALENDAR.NOW is the Timeout file 
that you place in your Timeout folder. MACRO PERPCAL is the AppleWorks word 
processor file that contains the macros ready to compiled. NOTES contains 
Doug's directions about how to use these macros. VERSION HISTORY is just 
what is says.

     Once installed, it will appear on the Timeout menu as CALENDAR NOW. 
You may select it from anywhere within AppleWorks. When selected, it first 
displays the present month in a box in the middle of the screen. Near the 
bottom is a request to press a key.  When you press a key you are shown a 
menu of choices that include

          Choose calendar year/month     Solid Apple-C
          Today's monthly calendar       Solid Apple-T
          Launch default macros          Both Apples-L

     You may choose from this menu by highlighting your choice and then 
pressing return. The first choice allows you to input the year you want. 
Then it displays a list of months to choose from. The list also includes 
"whole year."  You are then shown the month/year that you selected. If you 
selected the whole year, you are shown a month at a time, beginning with 
January.

     The second choice displays the present month again. The third choice 
launches your default macros for you.

     Using the escape key makes things a bit different.  If you press the 
escape key while the calendar is on-screen, you will get a message at the 
bottom that says "Calendar stopped ... please press a key." Any key press 
at this point will take you to the menu. If you press escape at the menu, 
you will leave the menu but will not return to you default macros.  This 
means that the calendar is available to you with the Apple keypresses.  
However, your default macros are not available.  You can easily get the 
default macros back by pressing both Apple keys and the L key to launch 
them.

     Since our current calendar, the Gregorian, did not exist before circa 
1582, you can't use a year earlier than that.  However, Doug does let you 
go all the way to the year AD 9999. <grin>

     I highly recommend this little jewel!

     This is an enhanced version of InternaMaze which was first created by 
Dennis G. Ward and then converted to Applesoft by Bill Fortenberry and 
uploaded as file #1298 in 1987.  I have taken the liberty of making some 
modifications in it to make it more user-friendly.  This version adds the 
use of lowercase letters and the arrow keys to move though the maze. It 
also gives you a proper way to exit the program prematurely by pressing the 
escape key. For more information about it, see the April '94 A2 GEnie Lamp

      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Tom Zuchowski provides a variety of tips for newcomers to GEnie who 
want to upload files to the A2 library.  As Tom says, "Newcomers to A2's 
uploading process must go through a learning curve.  These tips will guide 
you past the most common errors made by newcomers who are uploading for the 
first time. If you follow them closely you can be confident that your 
uploads will be correct and easily handled by the A2 staff and those who 
will download it."

     Obviously, if you plan to do any up or downloading, you will need a 
copy of ShrinkIt.  If you do not have one, or if your copy is fairly old, 
you can get the latest versions from the library.  There is a version for 
those of you with Apple IIe (enhanced with 128K of memory) or the Apple 
IIc, as well as a version for the Apple IIgs.  First we will talk about the 
IIe version.


    SHRINKIT34.EXE (file #20074 - 41856 bytes) ShrinkIt for the IIe/IIc
    '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is ShrinkIt for the IIe & IIc, the standard archiver/de-archiver 
for the Apple IIe enhanced with 128K of memory, or the IIc, and ProDOS. 

     This version of ShrinkIt will unpack itself with a little help from 
you.  Read the directions below for details.

     Make sure to give it a file type of TXT when you download it, this is 
very important!  Also, it's important that you keep the file name as 
"SHRINKIT34.EXE".  Make sure that you have 82 free blocks on the same disk 
as SHRINKIT34.EXE.  Then run BASIC.SYSTEM and from the "]" prompt, type 
-SHRINKIT34.EXE  (that's a dash, then the name of the file).

     That will get you the working version of ShrinkIt for the IIe & IIc! 
It will fit on a 5.25 diskette.  The documentation is available in another 
file (see below).

                                 [*][*][*]


    SHK34.DOCS.BXY  (file #20145 - 18048 bytes)  ShrinkIt Documentation
    '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     In order to make the file SHRINKIT34.EXE unpackable to a single 5.25 
floppy disk, the documentation file was removed from it. The documentation 
merely details the history, and give other general info about the program 
which is not necessary to operate it. Should you feel the need for 
completeness, then this file is for you. The BXY version of Shrinkit 3.4 
already contains this file so a download is unnecessary.

                                 [*][*][*]


     If you have a GS, the ShrinkIt for you is GS-ShrinkIt v1.1 which is 
described below.


       GSHK.BSE V1.1  (file #19517 - 118272 bytes)  GS-ShrinkIt v1.1
       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is GS-ShrinkIt v1.1.  This is also a ShrinkIt self-extracting 
archive inside a Binary II wrapper.  This means that you'll have to remove 
the Binary II wrapper either when downloading using your communications 
program (ie, turn Binary II mode ON), or remove the Binary II wrapper with 
a separate program once you've downloaded this archive.  GSHK v1.1 is 
faster compressing, faster decompressing, can make self-extracting 
archives, and has been made easier to use.  A MUST-HAVE for anyone 
downloading files from A2 or A2Pro!

     Remember, you MUST download this with Binary II turned on, or use 
some other utility after the download to remove the Binary II wrapper.  
Then just run the program to have it extract itself.

     COGITO.BXY      File #23321      285696 bytes      GS PUZZLE GAME
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is Cogito, the latest FREEWARE release from Brutal Deluxe. This 
nifty puzzle game for the GS is loosely based on the Rubik's Cube. The 
object is to restore a shuffled puzzle to its original condition. It starts 
off fairly simple and gets progressively harder. You can play any of the 
100+ levels at any time, but of course you'll have more fun if you start at 
level 1 and work your way up. The game itself is in greyscale, but it's 
very well done and has some nice background music that you can turn on and 
off as you wish. Once the game starts, press any key on the keyboard to get 
to the "setup" screen. Be sure to read the READ.ME file first.  Included is 
Tool 220 which must be placed in the Tools folder located in the System 
folder of your boot disk.

     If you haven't discovered this game yet, rush over to the library and 
get it.  It is well worth the long download time.

   SHOWME1.1.1.BXY    File #23435    73984 bytes    GS GRAPHICS VIEWER +
   '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Dave Leffler has provided us with an exceptionally good NDA/Finder 
Extra to view IIgs and other graphics including MacPaint, GIF, 3200 color, 
and Print Shop IIgs... and now, animations.  Not only that but it also 
allows some simple changes in the graphics as well as the ability to save 
in several formats.  Best of all, the price is right -- FREE.  Dave 
releases this as JesusAware, the same as Freeware.

     The following comments are quoted from Dave's documentation file that 
is included with the download.

     "ShowMe! is a combination New Desk Accessory (NDA) and Finder 6.0 
Extension (FX) that will allow you to see an unobstructed full screen views 
of any type of IIGS Super HiRes Graphic, plus some other non-IIGS formats.  
You can also save the displayed graphic in a couple of different formats, 
and do some simple color conversions.

     "You may view:

  - Unpacked graphics (Screen) files
  - Eagle/Packbytes format packed graphics files
  - Apple Preferred Format packed graphics files
  - PaintWorks packed graphics files
  - PaintWorks Gold 640 mode packed graphics format
  - PrintShop GS Color Graphics
  - Unpacked 3200 Color pictures
  - Packed 3200 Color pictures, "3201"-APP and APF.
  - Graphics Interchange Format, GIF graphics versions 87a AND 89a
  - MacPaint graphics, Full or Half height

     "You may save graphics: (does not apply to 3200 color pictures)

  - Unpacked graphics (Screen) files
  - Apple Preferred Format packed graphics files, Full or Screen Size
  - Double Height Apple Preferred Format files, Full or Screen Size

     "You may convert: (does not apply to 3200 color pictures)

  - 320 mode pictures into 640 mode color pictures  
  - 320 mode pictures into 640 mode gray scale pictures
  - 320 mode to 640 mode
  - 640 mode to 320 mode
  - 640 mode to 320 mode with default palette
  - 320 mode to 640 mode with default palette

     "You may also:

  - Display more that one graphic at a time in a slide show fashion.
  - Use it as a graphics previewer before launching a graphics application.

     "You must have a IIGS running System software version 5.04 or later.  
Also a little extra memory might be nice for those large graphics files.  
Even though ShowMe! will work fine under 5.04, you'll have many more 
features when running it under the System 6.0 since it takes advantage of 
the new Finder features."

     Previous versions were called ShowPic NDA.  If you have a previous 
version, you know how good Dave's work is.  This one is the best yet.  Rush 
right over to the library and get it.  Read the documentation file to be 
sure you are setting it up correctly, and then enjoy the graphics!

       FINDFILE.BXY     File #10567    8820 bytes    File Finder NDA
       '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Steve Chick's Find File NDA, version 1.2, has some pretty nifty 
features.

     First of all, since it's a NDA, it can be accessed from within any 
desktop program that gives you access to the apple menu. Second, it 
searches for filenames in the background while you work.  It has a priority 
level option that let's you do high speed searches as well.

     As a test, I opened ShadowWrite, then selected Find File, put it to 
work hunting through my 240 meg hard drive, and then went back to 
ShadowWrite and began typing.  As I typed, I could hear the hard drive as 
Find File worked.  When it finished, it beeped and all I had to do was 
reselect it from the Apple menu to see what it had found.

     Find File is freeware.  It works with System 4.0 and above. For you 
programmer types, the source code is supposed to be available in A2Pro.

     PIXMIX.BXY    File #12726    99540 bytes    GS JIGSAW PUZZLE GAME
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                                  PIXMIX
              Copyright 1989 Doug Happel, All Rights Reserved
                                 Freeware

     PIXMIX is a jigsaw puzzle game for the Apple IIgs. It can read most 
kinds of IIgs graphic images from diskette, fracture them into from 6 to 80 
pieces, and let you reassemble them as a pleasurable exercise. In my 
opinion, this is one of the true gems of the GS world. Even though it was 
created about five years ago, under ProDOS 16, it works just fine using the 
latest GS System software.

     PIXMIX works with most image files of types $C0 and $C1. It cannot 
handle image files of partial screens (these wouldn't be of much use as a 
puzzle, anyway).

     You may wish to select "Help..." from the Apple menu after you've 
launched PIXMIX. This will allow you to select any menu item and see a 
description of its use.

     Start by selecting "New Image..." from the "Files" menu. This will 
bring up a dialogue box allowing you to choose the graphic image file you 
want to work with. After you have selected a file by "Open"-ing it, another 
dialogue box will appear asking you into how many rows and columns you'd 
like the image to be fractured. You must make a choice here (although you 
can always re-scramble the image later at a different level of complexity).

     There are two windows available for your use. The window called 
"Boxtop" is the unscrambled image-- use it as a model. The window called 
"Puzzle" is the scrambled image-- this is where you reconstruct the image. 
You can switch from viewing one window to the other via the "Options" menu.

     To re-assemble the image, click on a piece you'd like to move. Its 
colors will invert to indicate that it has been selected. Now click on 
another piece-- the two pieces will exchange places. This is known as 
"Single Swap" mode.

     Another mode called "Block Swap" will let you move a block of pieces 
at a time. This mode can be selected via the "Options" menu. To select the 
block you wish to move, depress the mouse button with the cursor in one of 
your block's corners. Drag the cursor to the diagonally opposite corner, 
and release the button. The selected rectangle will invert its colors. Now 
click the mouse button with the cursor in the upper-left corner of the 
destination block (of the same size). If the blocks do not overlap, they 
will swap positions. If the blocks overlap, and the destination is in the 
same row or column as the selected block, the latter will "slide" into its 
new location. Illegal moves will earn you a beep or an alert box.

     Hint: In "Block Swap" mode, after you've selected a block, you can 
press the mouse button with the cursor within your selection and drag it to 
its new location.

     Nestled within the "Puzzle" menu is a selection called "Choose 
Timer..." When you select this item, you will see a dialogue box which 
allows you to choose one of four timer options.

     PIXMIX is Freeware. Please refer to the "About PIXMIX" item of the 
Apple menu for restrictions regarding its distribution.

                  ~ GEnieLamp Profile:  Susan MacGregor ~

     This month we will profile the new Chief Sysop for the Apple II 
RoundTable.  Susan MacGregor [A2.SUSAN] began her duties in December, 
replacing Gary Utter.


GEnieLamp>   Susan, describe your new job here on GEnie.
'''''''''
Susan>   I recently took over as Chief Sysop here in A2.  That means I get
'''''    to watch over everything that we do here and make sure that things 
keep rolling.  For many things I simply make suggestions as needed on 
things and let the person who's in charge of that area make the decisions.

     One of the main things I need to watch for is where something 
happening in one area will effect another area.  We recently delayed 
releasing the new versions of GEM and CoPilot when we heard about the new 
RTC software that GEnie was about to deploy.  The revised scripts are 
mostly all done, and being tested now.


GEnieLamp>   What is the hardest part of your job?  Why?
'''''''''
Susan>   People problems.  There are so many different things that can come 
'''''    up, and each problem needs to be handled differently.


GEnieLamp>   What part of it gives you the most pleasure? Why?
'''''''''
Susan>   Fire fighting.  Sometimes strange things happen, and cause 
'''''    unexpected problems, and sometimes things get messed up.  It's 
important to fix certain types of problem very quickly.


GEnieLamp>   What other jobs have you held in the RT?
'''''''''
Susan>   I was the RTC Manager for two years.  We expanded our RTC coverage 
'''''    a lot, both here in A2, and in things we do in other RTs.


GEnieLamp>   How did you first get interested in the Apple II computer?
'''''''''
Susan>   I started playing Dungeon and Dragon's right after I graduated
'''''    from college.  That led me into other war games.  The main problem 
I had with war gaming was that the people I played them with kept moving 
away, and it was tough to find new people to play them with.  It had also 
been a problem finding times when we could both play.

     By the time my second war game opponent moved away, the same 
companies that sold war games were selling computer versions of their more 
popular games.  Since a computer wouldn't move away, and would always be 
available when I had time to play, it seemed like good thing to invest in.

     I could justify the expense if I also gave up playing "arcade games" 
at a quarter a game, and instead played them on my own computer.

     When I looked at which games I would want to play, and what computers 
they were available for, the Apple II was the big leader.  So that's what I 
got.


GEnieLamp>   Do you have any anecdotes you can share with us about your
'''''''''    first experiences with the Apple II?

Susan>   I bought my computer to play games on, but I knew I could and
'''''    would use it for other things.  Little had I imagined just how 
quickly those other things would grow.

     I started building a spreadsheet to track my household budget.  (I 
was getting ready to go to graduate school, and that meant I needed to keep 
closer tabs on how much we spent on what.)  My spreadsheed grew steadly as 
I kept expanding what all it could do.

     Then my (now ex-) husband got involved in a start up business, and 
needed to develop a business plan for it.  He knew how to use a different 
computer that used CP/M, so I taught him how to use mine, and we developed 
the business plan together in AppleWorks.

     We had to buy a RamWorks card in order to build ever bigger 
spreadsheets. Two weeks later we went back and upgraded the memory on the 
RamWorks card and bought a Transwarp card also.

     I still played games on it.


GEnieLamp>   Tell us a bit about your family.
'''''''''
Susan>   I have two children, Chris who's 14 and a sophomore in high
'''''    school, and Linda who's 11 and just started Jr High (6th grade).  
My father also lives with us, and of course we have a dog, Ebony.


GEnieLamp>   What do you consider your proudest accomplishment?
'''''''''
Susan>   Opening up and running my own business for several years.  Having 
'''''    to close it down was very disappointing, but I've never regretted 
doing it.  I set up one room in back where my kids would spend their time 
after school each day.  They had things to play with there, and even a VCR, 
but they also learned to help me with my business.  They would put labels 
on things (usually while watching TV), sweep up parts of the store, play in 
my packing beads, write up sales invoices, and I even taught them how to 
help test equipment and demonstrate software for clients.


GEnieLamp>   Who do you look up to as your mentors?
'''''''''
Susan>   When I was young I used to help my father out a lot.  We had moved 
'''''    into a small two-bedroom house, that grew into a six-bedroom house 
as our family kept growing.  I learned to do all types of things, and got 
used to knowing that I could learn to do anything.

     When I was in high school, my father told me that it didn't matter 
what I studied in college, because the main thing that I would learn in 
college was how to learn.  I can understand what he meant a lot more now 
than I could when he first told me that, and I'm still busy learning new 
things.


GEnieLamp>   It sounds like your father is a wise man, with good advice.
'''''''''    What sorts of things do you like to do for fun (i.e. 
             non-computer hobbies)?

Susan>   I've graduated up to Advanced Dungeons and Dragons II now, and I 
'''''    still play games on my computer.  I also spend a lot of time doing 
yard work when it's not winter.  We have 1/3 of an acre of land here with 
lots of trees and bushes.  I'm no longer a little league manager, but we 
may yet get back into that.


GEnieLamp>   How long have you been a member of GEnie?
'''''''''
Susan>   I got online on GEnie when I became an RTC Host here in A2.  That 
'''''    was in August of 1992.


GEnieLamp>   What do you see as the future for the Apple II and its owners?
'''''''''
Susan>   I think that Apple II's will continue to be used for a long time 
'''''    yet.  There are people who move onto something newer, either 
because they need something that their Apple II can't do, or because they 
just want the newer slicker things.  (The same people who likely buy a new 
car every couple of years.)

     The one problem that Apple II users face is the limited amount of new 
programs that are available to them.  Part of this is that there are 
already so many programs that have already been written for Apple II's, and 
don't need to be replaced.  But another part is that many programers perfer 
to play with the newer systems.  (They like to learn new things too; it's 
not just me.)


GEnieLamp>   What was the best advice given to you as you assume this new 
'''''''''    challenge?

Susan>   To remember that the staff in A2 is very competent and is already
'''''    a great team!

GEnieLamp>   Susan, thank you for a pleasant and informative interview. We 
'''''''''    wish you lots of success and personal enjoyment in your new
             job. :)

Susan>   You're welcome!  I want to invite all of your readers to visit the 
'''''    Apple II RoundTable often.  We have a great deal to offer you.

January 1995 Report
"""""""""""""""""""
by GEna Saikin
     [A2.GENA]



     PAUG -- Planetary Apple User's Group -- is an online user group that 
meets the third Sunday of every month in the Apple II RoundTable Conference 
area.  It was conceived over a year ago as a means for continued support of 
the Apple II computer, and to fill some of the gaps found by people trying 
to find local user groups.

THE MAIN EVENT   This month, PAUG featured Tony Morales, Pat Kern, and Clay 
""""""""""""""   Juniel as we talked about the Sights and Sounds of 
Christmas.

     Clay Juniel started us off talking about various programs he has 
authored, including GS Entertainment, which plays music and displays 
graphics.  GSE will play Synthlab, rSounds, Music Composer and many other 
formats.  His GS Entertainment program is file #23270 here in our library.

     Tony then told us a little about Sonobox, his New Desk Accessory 
(NDA) that plays MODs in the background.  MODs are a format that is able to 
be used on several different platforms, and began on the Amiga.  MODs can 
be obtained from various areas here on GEnie -- the MIDI RT, Atari RT, and 
the Amiga ST RT.  Tony's Sonobox program is file #23533.

     Pat Kern finished up by telling a little about the various graphics 
program she uses, including the New Print Shop, Publish It, Print Shop GS 
and Print Shop GS Companion, all of which she uses to make various cards, 
and other publishing tasks.  She also gave us a quick lesson in embossing.  
All of the graphic programs above mentioned are commercial, but the items 
she has created with them are in our library...too many to list here.  

     For a list of all graphics, sounds and so on of Christmas, download 
file #23736.  It's fairly current, can be "listed" (it's a text file) and 
will give you a list of most of our christmas graphics and sounds here.

WHAT'S NEW IN THE APPLE II WORLD?   Some new things are appearing on the 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   scene, and others are still in the 
cooker.  Fax software is still being pursued and created by several 
different authors, and will be out when it's finished.

     A new update to Spectrum is also being prepared for release.  Rumor 
has it that it's soon to be released!

     Appleworks 5, a great upgrade to the ever popular Appleworks 4 is 
released, and is now for sale.

WHAT'S NEW IN A2?   We have some new faces onstaff, and new promotions.  
"""""""""""""""""   Susan MacGregor (A2.SUSAN) has been appointed Head 
Sysop of A2, while Gina Saikin (A2.GENA) was appointed as RTC Manager.  
Lunatic (A2.LUNATIC) will be taking over as Chief of Operations for A2 and 
A2Pro.  

     New hosts who have joined us include Nelson Eisel, Paul Parkhurst and 
Greg (SNAKEBYTE).  Bear will be back in his "cave" on Saturday nights as 
well.

THE LIBRARY STACKS   The following files are the "pick of the crop" for 
""""""""""""""""""   December, and can be found in the Apple II RoundTable 
library.  A + before the number indicates it can be used on an 8 bit Apple.

IN CONCLUSION   Remember, PAUG is YOUR meeting!  If you have any 
"""""""""""""   suggestions, insights, or ways to help us help you...let us 
KNOW!  Future plans include working with groups on the "outside" to create 
a stronger bond within the Apple II community.  Just e-mail C.ADAMS11 or
