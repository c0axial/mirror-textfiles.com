                     >>> I COULD WRITE A SONNET... <<<
                     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Special message for those of you reading the April issue of GEnieLamp 
A2 on the first day it's available:  There aren't any April Fool jokes in 
this issue, so all the good news you're about to get is true.  (There's 
very little bad news this month!)  I've recently come to believe that if 
you can't perpetrate a April Fool joke before noon on April 1--when your 
victim knows he or she should be on his guard--then you haven't got any 
business pulling the gag at all.

     No, this is not because I got caught out last year. <grin>  In fact, 
last year, I was privileged to see what I consider to be very nearly the 
perfect April Fool joke.  The denizens of the Apple II Programming 
RoundTable, A2Pro, put their welcoming banner up backwards:

     You really had to see it scrolling at 2400 baud or slower to 
appreciate how startling it was.  The time from being startled to the 
sudden realization that I'd been had was mere seconds... and then I laughed 
out loud.

     I thought of stealing A2Pro's idea, and having this month's issue 
start like this:

                                |||||| |||||| ||  || |||||| ||||||

                                                !looF lirpA  :.S.P

     Naah!  I don't particularly like April Fool jokes, but I really don't 
like plagiarism. <grin>

                                 [*][*][*]


     I guess another reason I haven't inserted any April Fool jokes in 
this month's issue is that I already feel foolish enough.

     In this issue of GEnieLamp A2, I finally get to tie up the last loose 
end created by the closure of A2-Central.  It's like this:  In September 
1994, I asked Mike Westerfield of the Byte Works, Inc. for a review copy of 
Quick Click Calc.  He sent it, and I intended to review as soon as I had 
time to sit down and put it through its paces.  I really _hate_ software 
reviews that are based on first impressions, and so I waited until I really 
had time to thoroughly use Quick Click Calc.  The review was supposed to 
run in the March 1995 issue of A2-Central... and there was no March 1995 
issue of A2-Central.

     Another thing I really hate is not being able to follow through on my 
commitments... so the Quick Click Calc review appears in this issue of 
GEnieLamp A2.  I know it's not exactly what you bargained for, Mike, but 
it's the best I can do.  (GS+, Shareware Solutions II, Softdisk G-S and II 
Alive have already reviewed it.)

     Mike Westerfield has been very good to me.  I've owed him this review 
for months now.  Of course, I don't owe his program a _good_ review.  So 
did Quick Click Calc get a good review or not?  You'll just have to read 
this month's Softview A2 column and see.

     In the meantime, the Byte Works has announced its second entry in the 
Quick Click Calc series:  Quick Click Morph.  You'll read all about it this 
month.

APPLEWORKS 5, ULTRAMACROS AND APPLETALK   Don't give up on running AW5 and 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   macros with AppleTalk active. I 
do it all the time.

     The main trick seems to be launching AW5 from ProSel-16 rather than 
from Finder (although I can often run AW5/UM even after launching from 
Finder, but in that case Finder is launched from ProSel-16, which may 
account for that). 

     Then you need to know how to patch AW5 to allow macros with AppleTalk 
active. I'll be glad to give you that if you want to try it. Randy's Free 
Patcher has a patch that purportedly does that, but I couldn't get it to 
work, so I had to do it manually from Block Warden.

     Let me know if you want to pursue this.

<<<<<   In AW5, in APLWORKS.SYSTEM, change offset +148F from EE to 2C
"""""
     Longer answer (if not familiar with Block Warden or Zap): Run Block 
Warden or Zap, set prefix to your AppleWorks directory, press "F" to 
<F>ollow the file APLWORKS.SYSTEM, use up-arrow to move to byte $001400, 
press "E" to enter <E>dit mode, use down- and right-arrow cursor keys to 
move to byte $00148F, type "2C" to overwrite "EE", escape to "R/W mode" and 
press "W" to write the change to disk. Of course, you should only do this 
to a copy of AW5.

     Having made the change, try running AW5 from ProSel-16 with AppleTalk 
active and see what happens. If you still get crashes, suspect other 
interrupt-driven inits or DAs. If you can't get it to work, you can always 
reverse the process and change byte 148F back to EE.

KARL BUNKER'S SOURCE CODE   I received the following email from Karl Bunker 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   in reply to an inquiry I sent to him.

[begin]

Charles --

     Nice to hear a little blast from the past.  It figures that there 
would be some questions posted about my stuff on GEnie within weeks of me 
closing my account there.  But since I don't have an Apple II/IIgs any 
more, and since I've been forgetting everything I ever know about the 'II 
at an alarming rate, I probably wouldn't have been able to answer any 
questions anyway.

     Regarding my source code, I did release some of it for public use 
when I left the A2 field, and uploaded it to GEnie's A2Pro library.  I'm 
not sure exactly what I released, but I know it included the code to 
Quit.To, File-A-Trix and SF.Get.  I still have just about all my assembly 
source code from my Apple II days, so if anyone's interested in the source 
to some of my other programs, or if there's some problem with accessing the 
code I uploaded to GEnie previously, just let me know.  My assembly code is 
all in Lisa816 format, and Lisa816 saves its source in its own non-text 
format, so to be usable one would need a copy of Lisa816 to convert it to 
text.  (The code I previously uploaded to GEnie had been converted to text, 
but the code I have in my archives isn't converted.)  I also have my 
Lisa816 original disk, so if it's legal to do so, I could provide a copy of 
that too.  (I trashed or gave away all my other II/IIgs software long ago, 
but I loved that darn assembler so much I just had to hang onto it.)

     As to what I've been up to lately, well, I've been learning huge 
amounts about Mac programming and programming in general (I'm embarrassed 
to think about "real" programmers looking at my Apple II code from 
way-back-then; my apologies to anyone who takes on the job of figuring it 
out).  And naturally, I have vastly huger amounts still to learn.  I'm 
currently programming full time for the first time in my life, and my plan 
is to make a stab at earning a living by designing and writing games for 
the Mac.  I'm just finishing up a semi-major project; if you ever peruse 
Mac magazines, perhaps you'll be hearing about it in 6 months or so.

     Feel free to post this note on GEnie, if anyone's interested.

     We will be in touch with Karl about getting his source code and will 
keep everyone posted.

problem with the number of usable partitions under ProDos, and I don't 
beleive in using HFS partitions on a GS.  A 240, with a Syquest as your 
second drive, should give you all the capacity you'd ever need.  The LPS

that you could ever notice or measure the difference.)

and has plenty of capacity for GS backups.  (I.e. format the cart to 32 
megs and a remainder, back up each of your 32 meg partitions on the main 
drive to a Syquest cart using ProSel Volume Copy.  (Of course, you COULD 
buy a Syquest 270, and back everything up to ONE cart, but if that one cart 
died......)

     (Others may disagree, but you asked for opinions, and that's mine. :)

     6. 28,800 modem (v34), USR or Hayes preferred, many others 
acceptable...

     (Sayyyyy, did I just describe MY system?  Why, yes, I guess I did, 
except that my memory card is actually from CV Tech, and my hard drives are 
in TMS cases, but otherwise...)

     7. Second Sight video card from Sequential (as soon as it becomes 
available) running a 15" or better Sony or NEC SVGA monitor. 

     8. Buffered Grappler Plus running into a DeskJet 550C with either the 
Vitesse or Sevenhills drivers.

     9. Superdrive card and drive.  (I'd run that out of Slot 6 myself, 
and bag the 5.25 drives, then put a pair of 800K drives on the Smartport.)

     If you REALLY want to tweak it, get a keyboard from a Mac SE30 (same 
circuit board as the GS keyboard, in a better case) and make sure that you 
have an original "grey ball" style GS mouse, not one of those new "black 
ball" mice that shipped with the Rom 03.  (Or try to find a Rom 03 
Kensington Turbo mouse, if you like those things....)  (And get a "Y" 
connector for the ADB cables, so you don't have to plug the mouse into the 
keybaord, it lays out much nicer on your desk.:) 

     For a touch of the obscure, find one of Bob Consortis "On Board" 4 
meg memory cards.  I don't know if Bob has any left, but that thing is the 
BEST built memory card ever produced for the GS.  (So well built, in fact, 
that it cost Bob too much to produce it and he took a real bath on them.)

     (You could put more RAM in the machine with a "piggyback" memory 
card, and get a REALLY big hard drive, and a REALLY fast ZIP, but it would 
just be for bragging rights. :)  (If you're gonna do that, you'll want to 
put a 20" monitor on that Second Sight card. :)

     (Sayyy, this was fun, wasn't it? :)

FAXINATION v1.0.5 STOMPS SOME BUGS   A new version of FAXination is now 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   available on the Vitesse BBS. Go to 
the (X)transfers area, then select Area 3 and download from the only 
directory in the FAXination Updates area.

     The new version includes the NDA and the Print Driver. Unpack the 
archive and replace your old files with the new ones. This update addresses 
the following problems:

-  Garbled receives on LineLink modems.
-  Printing from AWGS and GraphicWriter III is much better now!
-  You may now Print AND View faxes in your fax logs!
-  When creating a fax document, FAXination now names the document for you 
   using the name from the title of your document window. 

     When logging on to the Vitesse BBS for the first time, try entering 
your Invoice Number from the invoice you received with your FAXination 
package. If you get a "Invalid Information Entered" response, I probably 
haven't been notified that your program was shipped. Just type "NEW" to 
apply for an account and you will be granted access within a few hours.

     While most people can get on the BBS in the first try, one or two 
have been bumped off due to line noise or something, which also locks up 
the BBS. If this happens to you, send a FEEDBACK at the logon prompt and 
tell me what you want to use for a handle and password, plus your invoice 
number, and I will set up a complete account for you. If you STILL can't 
get on, other arrangements will be made on a case by case basis.

<<<<<   Re: Garbled faxes (Other than LineLink
"""""
     I expect to get a LineLink 144e modem for testing in the next couple 
of days, and will make it work at that time. Sorry for the false optimism 
in the announcement for version 0.1.4, but I really thought I had something 
there. :(

     When set up to receive, whether manually or in Auto-receive mode, 
FAXination starts a RunQ task which triggers once per second and looks for 
a RING response from the modem. The RunQ task is not allowed to trigger 
again until it has finished, but the NDA, which uses the same Resource 
Manager files, could conceivably be causing some kind of a weird conflict, 
which might account for the fact that a few people are seeing crashes if 
they leave their Receive functions active for too long.

     When a fax is actually coming in, FAXination uses its own interrupt 
handler to place incoming characters in a buffer, and the main program 
copies the characters from the buffer to a chunk of memory large enough to 
contain the entire page. This copying is done between interrupts. The 
interrupt handler permits other interrupts to be processed by the regular 
system handlers when no incoming characters are detected, so it is possible 
that NDA's or CDEV's which use interrupts could take control long enough to 
cause characters to be lost.

     Anyone who is experiencing garbled faxes which contain recognizeable 
features should try disabling their other NDA's and any non-essential 
CDEV's or INIT's which might be using interrupts. Clocks and screen 
blankers come to mind as potential culprits. If your faxes contain nothing 
but staticky-looking lines and dots, then you probably have a different 
problem, and should report your modem type here or on the Vitesse BBS.

PHOENIX II--APPLEWORKS 5 ON THE MAC   > Is there anything like AppleWorks

                                      > the mac world?

     Well, this summer there will be AppleWorks 5 and UltraMacros IN the 
Mac world.  JEM Software will be shipping an emulator (codenamed Phoenix) 
which lets you run your actual AppleWorks 5 on any 68020 or better Mac, 
including a native PPC version for PowerMacs.  The emulator wp find/replace 
test mentioned in the Jan 1995 Naug Forum emulation article gave a time of 
613 seconds for ][ in a Mac on a 610; on the same machine, Phoenix 
currently takes 66 seconds, and on a PowerMac, only 15 seconds (compared to 
about 30 seconds for a IIgs).
                    (BRANDT, CAT17, TOP6, MSG:9/M645;1)

<<<<<    > I assume this is an unaccelerated GS
"""""
     Yes, that's the the stock IIgs at 3mhz.  However, a 7mhz IIgs takes 
about 15 seconds as well, so the PowerMac is comparable on that test.

     > Any idea about the price of Phoenix yet?

     Yes.  ][ in a Mac lists for $149.  We'll probably list around $99, 
and undoubtedly there will be an offer or two, such as to the NAUG 
membership.

     Keypad macros will work.
                   (BRANDT, CAT17, TOP20, MSG: /M645;1)

<<<<<   > Are ya saying I'll be able to use AW5 and AW files on the Mac,
"""""   > without any conversions? Can files be created on the Mac, and
        > used on the GS? :)

     Yes and yes.  You're not running software similar to AppleWorks, 
you're running actual AppleWorks.  We just provide the "engine", so you'll 
still need a copy of AppleWorks in order to work.  Since you're running 
AppleWorks, you're loading, working with, and saving regular old AppleWorks 
disks.  Under System 7.5, you can save directly onto ProDOS disks which can 
then be popped into your IIgs.  Better yet, all it takes is a connection 
between your IIgs and your Mac and you can use Personal AppleShare to run 
AppleWorks on both machines from the Mac hard drive.

     > Will all the functions of AW5 be usable?

     Not graphics stuff like Paint, Graph or DB Pix.  We're not sure 
exactly how printing will be handled yet.  We will support a quick copy 
to/from the AWP clipboard and the Mac system clipboard for data transfer to 
other Mac apps.

     WARNING: Although Phoenix runs on 68020 machines, the performance on 
a Mac II is pretty bad.  I wouldn't use it on a 68020 unless it was 
accelerated.  I haven't tried a 68030 yet, but my 68040LC does a great job, 
and Mark's PowerMac provides impressive performance.  I'm guessing/hoping 
that the 604-based PowerMacs will run most AppleWorks functions faster than 
a 12mhz IIgs.  The great thing is that AppleWorks can just surf the latest 
wave of Apple hardware, getting faster and faster as time goes by. :)
                   (BRANDT, CAT17, TOP20, MSG:9/M645;1)

<<<<<   I hope we can live up to your expectations.  We're working hard to
"""""   make the Phoenix project a viable Mac application, at least to 
former A2'ers. Yesterday we got externals working.  There are now 
UltraMacros commands which can call Mac external commands.  For example, we 
have one called PLAYSOUND.  A macro such as A:<all msg ' Please wait ' : 
.sound "Welcome" : goto sa-b>! will put up a message, speak a recorded 
greeting as .sound tells PLAYSOUND to use the sound "Welcome", and continue 
on with the macro.  Pretty slick!

     Another cool features is that your root directory can be specified as 
"/*/" and the Mac will use the current Phoenix folder.  This means that 
regardless of the hard drive's name, inits and TimeOut apps load up and the 
default data disk finds files in the Phoenix folder right after 
installation without having to reconfigure everything like on the A2.

     Yes, Mark is Mark Munz of Beagle Bros/JEM Software fame.  He's the 
programmer on Phoenix.  I'm the publisher, A2 tech advisor and co-designer. 
Between the two of us we've got it in pretty good shape by now.

SYSTEM 6.0.2 FOR THE IIGS   Olivier Zardini of Brutal Deluxe has asked me
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   to post the following message here on A2. 
Please note that his Internet e-mail address is at the end of his note, and 
for various reasons which I think should be fairly obvious given that legal 
copyrights are involved, I'd prefer if you contacted him directly rather 
than by posting a response here or by e-mailing me. I'm simply passing 
along Brutal Deluxe's message...

                        Hello,

        After 2 months of hard work, we are proud to announce that we have 
made the source code of the WHOLE Apple //gs 6.01 SYSTEM.

     Few bugs have been corrected, such as the Font Manager one. But many 
of them remain in the system. We have found many things like that

                        _TLStartUp
                        bcc *+3
                        brk $f0
                        .
                        .

     That would explain why the system crashes so often. So, there is a 
lot of work to do to clean the system up.

     The purpose of this message is to get from the users a list of the 
bugs. Apple Computer Inc should have such a list, could someone ask them 
for it ?

     A good thing will be to add to the next system (6.02 ??) the setup 
files we mainly use (Bill Tudor's extensions, PicViewer...).

     Our purpose is not to upload the whole sources code on FTP sites but 
to find people (or organization like Phoenix Project) who could help us in 
debugging some parts of the system. We are looking for experimented beta 
testers, because some parts like FST (Appleshare, msdos...) can't be tested 
on our configuration (We have no network at home).

     We perfectly know that the Apple //gs system is not a public domain 
software and the fact of releasing a new version is probably illegal. But, 
if we and you don't do it, who will do it ? Apple has decided to leave the 
Apple II community and will never change his mind. But, if someone at Apple 
Comp wants to help us, that will be a good thing.

     We are awaiting your comments. Your propositions &  help are welcome.

                Apple //gs System 6.02 infinitum    :-)

<<<<<   (Here's a follow up from Brutal Deluxe. I'm relieved after reading
"""""   this..JK)

                 Hello...

... and many thanks to everyone who posted us a message.

Let us explain few things. We think that our previous message was not quite 
understandable.

    - We don't want to be a substitute of Opple and replace them in 
      updating the system they have provided.

    - We DO KNOW that releasing a complete set of SystemDisk 6.0.2 is 
      illegal and we won't go that way.  Even though it has not been 
      clearly explained, our purpose is to make a special disk including 
      updated files.  A patch IS impossible in many cases.  (It is exactly 
      what we did with our french version of the system)

    - The _TLStartUp example was JUST an example :-)  It was given in order 
      to show you that some utilities are bugged.  The interesting part is 
      the BRK mnemonic.  Okay?

    - The aim is to have a 6.0.2 system which would be an update of 6.0.1 
      (update of 6.0) and NOT to had functionality to the system.

    - We don't really think that Opple will release an update to the system 
      even though some says the contrary.

    - We will be happy to have exchanges with other people who are working 
      in the same way (Quickdraw patch, Programmers on GEnie...).

The following is the software we had worked on:

    - Complete set of Control Devices (/CDEVs)

    - Complete set of Desk Accessories (/Desk.Accs)

    - Complete set of Drivers (/Drivers)

    - Complete set of File Translators (/FSTs)

    - Complete set of Init Files (/System.Setup)

    - Complete set of Tools (/Tools)

The next software is on a way to completion or need no updating:

    - GS/OS (That's but stupid you install it in bank $00, there is a loss 
      of about 8kb of direct page area)

    - Finder (The disassembling is ended, the Magic Dropping Routine 
      located and will soon be corrected)

    - ADU, Archiver, Installer, SynthLab, Teach We don't think these files 
      need to be updated (The Installer is really well programmed, and ADU 
      is a nightmare...)

So, for we can release such an update, we want you to send us:

    1/ The list of the bugs you have encountered:
          Which supposed file is corrupted and so on...
          (Hi Geoff: Can you send us your list please?)

    2/ The domain in which you can help us debugging:
          Hello, I have a BlueDisk, then you can test MsBeurk FST...

As far as FSTs are concerned:

    1/ Understanding the internal structure of an FST is not so hard

    2/ Writing a FST suppose to know other platforms' system files. We have 
       no documentation on Commodore Amiga files structure...

    3/ We will probably write a documentation of the FST structure.


                  Here we go...

     After a series of e-mails back and forth with Brutal Deluxe, and

Announcing Quick Click Morph   The Byte Works, long the dominant company 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   for Apple II development tools, announced 
their second productivity tool in a GEnie exclusive on March 19th. The new 
program puts the G for Graphics back in the Apple IIGS in a big way: Quick 
Click Morph brings Hollywood style special effects to the Apple II 
community!  You can create movies with morphs, tweens and fades.  Quick 
Click Morph also brings a new standard for movie color on the Apple IIGS, 
supporting several color palettes including 256 color movies!

     Quick Click Morph is expected to ship around the end of March, 1995.  
The Byte Works will announce the program again when it actually ships, but 
will accept orders now.  Naturally, pre-release orders will not be 
processed until the program actually ships.

Look What You Can Do   Morphs are those amazing movie clips you sometimes
''''''''''''''''''''   see on high budget films and commercials.  You start 
with two or more original pictures, identify a few similar points, like the 
eyes on a girl and a cat, and the program creates a smooth movie that 
changes one picture to another.  The middle frames, showing a mix of the 
two pictures, can be amusing, informative, or thought provoking.

     Morphs are great attention grabbers.  For example, think how 
effectively you could grab the attention of a 7th grade student with a 
HyperStudio evolution stack that opens with a morph that gradually changes 
a pre-human skull to a human skull.  Imagine their reaction to continental 
drift if you grab their attention with a morph that changes Pangaea, the 
original grouping of continents, smoothly into the current world map.

     Morphs are also a great way to make a statement.  Morphing your 
"favorite" politician into Mickey Mouse could release some tension, not to 
mention get your point across at a meeting.

     My favorite morphs are for entertainment.  A morph changing my 
daughter into her cat was an instant neighborhood hit.  (This morph is 
available in GEnie's A2 library.)  Mother-daughter morphs and 
mother-child-father morphs are a lot of fun, too.  Whatever your subjects, 
morphs are a great way to entertain!

Can I Share My Morphs?   Of course, once you create a morph, you'll want to 
''''''''''''''''''''''   send it to your friends.  Morphs created with 
Quick Click Morph can be played with any standard PaintWorks movie player.  
We even give you one with Quick Click Morph, and it's freeware, so you can 
send it to anyone you want at no charge.  Our movie player even lets you 
create a movie slide show that plays selected movies until you tell it to 
stop.

     And for those unfortunate friends who don't have an Apple IIGS, you 
can always hook a standard VCR recorder from your television set to the 
monitor output for your Apple IIGS and record all the morphs you want!

What can Quick Click Morph Do?   For those of you who are familiar with 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Morphing, and want to know the gritty 
details, here they are!  For those of you who have no idea what these 
details mean, don't worry--the manual teaches you how to create morphs with 
step-by-step examples that show you how to use the program, not just what 
the features are!

     Quick Click Morph starts with two or more pictures, which you can 
supply in a variety of formats.  These include Apple IIGS screen dumps, 
Apple Preferred pictures (including 3200 pictures stored in Apple Preferred 
format) and uncompressed RGB TIFF files.

     Once you assemble the original pictures for your morph, you have a 
variety of options for each sequence.  You control the number of frames, 
how fast the colors shift, the way the images change, and much more.

     Picking the control points to tell the program how to map one picture 
to another is a key feature of any Morph program, and Quick Click Morph 
gives you a lot of flexibility.  You can choose from control points or 
lines. Color coding helps you see which points correspond between your 
start and end frames.  You can look at the frames full size, or shrunk so 
the entire frame fits in the available space, and you can view one frame or 
the start-end frame pair.  A simple click of the mouse creates a control 
point, and moving one is as simple as dragging it with the mouse.

     You can pick from a variety of color palettes.  Grayscale movies are 
great for any application.  For geometric morphs, the standard 320 mode 
color palette is a fast and effective color choice.  HyperStudio likes to 
work in the standard 640 color palette, and Quick Click Morph is happy to 
oblige. You can also select a custom 16 color palette.  All of these 
choices lead to fast morphs which take as little as 30 seconds per frame on 
an unaccelerated Apple IIGS.  (The time goes up with the number of control 
points.  Typical morph times on an unaccelerated Apple IIGS are about 5 
minutes per frame.)

     If you'd like to invest a little more computer time on a morph, you 
can also pick from the dazzling 128 color and 256 color morphs!  These 
formats take full advantage of the Apple IIGS's multiple color palettes.  
And due to some behind the scenes tricks, these full-color movies can still 
be played with a standard PaintWorks movie player!

The Byte Works   We're the Byte Works, famous for our programming tools for 
''''''''''''''   the Apple II series of computers--and now for our 
productivity tools for the Apple IIGS, too!

     Founded in 1980, we have a long history of serving the Apple II 
community. We started with ORCA/M, a macro assembler that is one of two 
programs ever to earn a perfect rating from Peelings II magazine.  We went 
on to write APW, Apple Computer's standard programming environment for the 
Apple IIGS.  We've brought you dozens of other programs, too, like ORCA/C, 
the award winning C compiler; ORCA/Pascal, the only commercial object 
oriented language for the Apple II; and our Toolbox Programming courses, 
which have introduced thousands to the world of Apple IIGS toolbox 
programming.  And don't forget HyperLogo and 3D Logo, our fun, easy to use 
programming languages that can actually show 3D pictures on any color Apple 
IIGS!

     Look for more innovative, fun, useful programs for your Apple IIGS 
for us in the months to come.  We're one company with a long term 
commitment to our Apple IIGS customers!

Ordering   We accept Visa and MasterCard orders on-line or by phone, and

STATUS OF TURBOREZ GS   (Mar 7, 1995)  As of the above date, production of 
"""""""""""""""""""""   the TurboRez GS board has been suspended and will 
not be resumed.  It's been a long, difficult path over the years, with 
various versions of the product appearing periodically.  At this point, 
however, the project is being laid to rest and RezTek will not be 
developing any standalone video boards for the Apple II in the future.  
Despite getting about as close as we've ever been to completing the 
product, there's no arguing with the fact that the competing board from 
Sequential Systems is not only beating us out the door by 3-4 months but 
also has the clear advantage in the price category.  Rather than subject 
ourselves to an economically bruising battle and putting the Apple II 
marketplace thru a VHS/Beta type product war, we decided this was the best 
course of action.  This will insure a single, standard upgrade path.

     So, for those Apple IIe/IIGS users who are interested in enhancing 
the video output of their computers, we'd like to suggest and recommend the 
Second Sight video card from Sequential Systems (which should be shipping 
right about now).  Sequential is a company known for putting out solid, 
well-designed products in the past, and the Second Sight card looks to be 
no exception.  Here at RezTek, we're looking into the distinct possibility 
of supporting the Second Sight product sometime in the near future.  Stay 
tuned for more on that subject...

GOLDEN ORCHARD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS                MARCH 17, 1995 REVISION
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Will the CD be readable on a PC?   No.  The ISO 9660 file system 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   (needed for the CD to be PC readable) is 
just too restrictive and thus not very feasible for our needs.  Instead the 
CD has ProDOS and HFS partitions.


Will the CD be readable on a Mac?   Yes.  The CD has six HFS partitions 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   (this) was due to bugs in the HFS FST, 
but it also allowed us to fit a LOT more on the CD since it reduced HFS 
overhead considerably) and one ProDOS partition, all of which are capable 
of being mounted on a Mac.  However, you will need Mac CD drivers that will 
recognize multiple HFS partitions and ProDOS partitions.  The only driver 
we know of that will do this is FWB's CD-ROM Toolkit.  It will mount the 5 
HFS partitions, and if you have the ProDOS File System extension (part of 
the Apple IIe card software for the Mac) it will also mount the ProDOS 
partition as well.

     Almost all files should fit on an 800k disk so you could read them on 
a Mac with CD-ROM drive and transfer them to the GS manually.  800k disk 
images are one exception, but you can convert them into their original disk 
format on the Mac or the IIGS using included programs, so it shouldn't be a 
problem.

Will the CD be useful to an Apple IIe owner?   Somewhat.  The ProDOS 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   partition is around 18MB.  
It contains lots of AppleWorks files, ProDOS 8 utilities and programs, 
BASIC programs, and other items of interest to Apple IIe owners.  However 
the definite focus of this disc is the IIGS.

What is the current status of the project?  When will the CD be shipping?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   
We expect it to REALLY be shipping the first week of April (1995), if not 
sooner!  Right now the CD is being replicated by the CD manufacturing 
company.  We are presently taking preorders that will be shipped when we 
start shipping.

Will there be user group discounts?   If your user group would like to put 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   together a group order, please 
contact us (see below) for group discount information.

What about overseas orders?   We encourage overseas orders but regret that
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''   we cannot accept credit cards as a method of 
payment.  Overseas orders will be charged a $5 shipping and handling fee 
for air mail shipping.

Apple II RoundTables here on GEnie, is proud to announce....

     "GEnie for the IIgs," the Apple IIgs front end for GEnie, is now 
ready for beta testing!  That's right, we're now opening the door for YOU 
to access a brand-new way to use GEnie on your Apple IIgs!  If you would 
like to be involved in the beta-testing effort, please send GEnie mail to 
A2PRO.HELP, including the following information:

      Your full name
      An evening phone number
      A description of your Apple IIgs system.  You'll need:
          o System Software 6.0.1 (available in the A2 & A2Pro libraries)
          o An error-connecting modem (MNP4 or v.42, for example)
          o At least 1.25 megabytes of memory (more recommended)
          o Hard drive recommended

     Also, please include a short self-description.  In what other beta 
tests have you been involved?  Why you think you should be admitted to this 
beta test?  Describe your experience with GEnie and with the Apple IIgs 
desktop interface.  How long have you been telecommunicating?  etc.  :)

     The beta test will commence on or about March 12th.

     The GEnie for the Apple IIgs Project Manager stated "I believe we're 
on schedule for a June release, as I originally stated earlier this year.  
Of course, that will depend largely upon how well the beta process goes - 
if any major bugs are discovered, it may take longer to reach release, of 
course.  However, I do believe we'll be ready before Windows 95 will be."

     This topic will be closed.  Please make any replies or comments in 
topic 36 in this category (3).. and please use GEnie Mail to volunteer for 
the beta test.

SOFTDISK PERSONNEL CHANGES   About a week and a half ago, I resigned my 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   position at Softdisk, Inc. As such, I will no 
longer be in charge of, or officially associated with, the Softdisk G-S 
product.

     Unofficially, I will continue to work with Softdisk in supporting the 
GSLib programmers library and in submitting programs for publication on 
Softdisk.

"""""   unlike those who came (and left) before me, I leave Softdisk as an

     What happens at Softdisk is that people work very very hard with very 
few resources, and so we stretch ourselves thin.  We can only work so hard 
for so long.

     Now that I'll no longer be expected to write articles, fix up 
submissions, correspond/talk with submitters/subscribers, assemble issues, 
make templates, and write programs I'm not very interested in because of 
the demands of each issue, I hope to be able to actually produce more of my 
own actual programs.  And of course, I certainly hope Softdisk G-S is

wouldn't mind some extra income doing what I love).

     This company was founded on the Apple II line and remains steadfast

BUG REPORT FLUSHES OUT APPLEWORKS 5.1!   I have discovered a significant 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   bug in AWKS 5.0 ADB that has been 
repeated many times.  Do a record selection with two or more criteria, then 
insert a field at the top of the multiple-record layout screen.  Then start 
copying down the column using oa-'.  Hold down the keys and when the bottom 
of the column (the end of the selection) is reached, it starts scrolling 
the entire list of records WITHOUT the SELECTION even though it still is 
indicated at the top of the screen.  It occurs mostly when the selection is 
no longer valid due to the changes made to the category.  The result is 
destruction of data.  I've had this happed many times over the last several 
days working on a rather large project.  Has this condition always existed?

>> "LOL! I guess that's the price of more power (tm Tim Allen)."

     More power? I think NOT. :)

     Don't tell the folks in the Mac RT this (I am the Chief Sysop over 
there, after all), but I still do a good 90% of my work on the GS.

     The 10/64 GS is mucho faster than my Mac IIsi, and the maximum text 
file size I can load up is measured in megabytes (as opposed to 32K for 
SimpleText).

     I use the Mac for things the GS cannot do (because the software is 
not available) like complex graphic layout work, Internet connectivity, and 
accessing GUI based BBSs like First Class and NovaLink. The Mac also does a 
MUCH nicer job of printing. (Pointless and suchlike notwithstanding, the 
Mac simply does a superior job.)

     A PowerMac with the equivalent of CoPilot could probably persuade me 
to make the switch....

          >>> BUY A COMPUTER FOR THE FAMILY, NOT FOR THE KIDS <<<
          """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
            Copyright 1995 by Al Fasoldt.  All rights reserved.


     I've been asked many times to help others choose a new personal 
computer for their home.  Some of the readers who write or call are looking 
for their first home computer, and others are upgrading to a faster and 
fancier model.  Many add a qualification:  They'd like to buy the same type 
of computer their children are using in school.

     I can think of no worse reason to choose one computer over another.

     The computers used in typical American schools may very well be 
outdated.  Many schools can't even afford to buy the books they need and 
pay their teachers a proper wage, let alone purchase modern computers.  
Some are even still using old Apple II models, which aren't made any 
longer.  [!!!--Ed.]

     But this is, for me, a minor point.  What matters much more is the 
question of why families buy computers in the first place.

     A home computer is an appliance that can make life more interesting 
and can make daily chores easier.  It's a tool that can improve your 
writing skills and your financial abilities.  It's a gateway to adventure 
and an extension to the telephone that can connect you with a world you may 
never have explored before.

     This is something children need to realize as much as you do.  That's 
how they learn and grow.

     Before you start shopping for a computer, write down a list of 
everything you'd be using the computer for.  Will you use it for word 
processing?  Nearly all home computers are.  Will you use it to connect 
with online services?

     Do you want to take advantage of the educational and recreational 
aspects of the latest addition to home computing, CD-ROM?  More than half 
of all new personal computers come with CD-ROM devices built-in.

     Notice that none of these things (and there are dozens of other uses) 
is specifically oriented toward children.  In some ways, they are family 
activities.  Some of them, such as the incredibly easy way you can do your 
taxes on a computer, are strictly for adults.

     To your kids, of course, this is a children's world.  If you ask them 
what they want to do with a computer, you'll get a kids' answer.  Listen to 
them and take their desires into account.

     They may, for example, want to play the games that are available on 
CD-ROM.  Or they may want to log onto GEnie.  (And they'll probably do it 
before you do, since children aren't afraid to try something new.  The rest 
of us are usually stodgy and wary of everything newfangled.)

     Most important, keep in mind that children learn much faster than we 
adults do.

     "My kids would have to learn how to use a different kind of 
computer," one reader told me.  "That seems like too much to ask when they 
have everything else going on."

     Not at all.  I'd bet it wouldn't take a 9-year-old more than 10 
minutes to learn how to use a different computer.  I could be wrong, 
though; kids learn how to play new video games at the arcade in about three 
nanoseconds, and so they'd probably master your Mac or your Windows PC--or 
any kind of computer--faster than you can say, "Don't press that key!"

     Heck, let them press that key.  They'll be masters of the new machine 
in no time.

     And then they can teach you.

     On March 19, 1995, Mike Westerfield of the Byte Works, Inc. chose a 
GEnie Real-Time Conference--on the A2 RoundTable, natch!--as the place to 
announce his new program, Quick Click Morph!

     With the permission of the A2 RoundTable, GEnieLamp A2 presents a 
heavily edited transcript of that conference.  If you'd like to read the 
conference in all its glory as conducted by Cindy Adams, just move to the 
A2 Library (m645;3) and download file #24583, QCMRPHTRNCT.BXY.  To see the 
sample KarenCat morph referred to throughout the conference, download file

WESTERFIELD:  QC Morph is a GS implementation of what is becoming very 
              popular on some other computers, which is a personal-sized 
              (and priced) morph program that lets you take two or more 
              drawings of any kind and create a movie that smoothly changes 
              from one to another.  There are countless applications for  
              morph programs, from serious educational applications to just 
              plain silly, but my personal favorite is entertainment!  Some 
              of you may have seen the KarenCat morph... which shows my 
              daughter Karen morphed into one of our cats!

[See the QC Morph press release in HEY MISTER POSTMAN for more ideas.--Ed.]

QUESTION:  When will it be released, and how much is it?

WESTERFIELD:  QC Morph itself will be released in about 1.5 to 2.5 weeks 
              [March 29-April 5], depending on when the covers get back 
              from the printer.  The price is $60.

                         and Canada; a bit more to other places.)

QUESTION:  What formats are the movies saved in, other than C2?

WESTERFIELD:  QC Morph writes movies as PaintWorks animation files.

              It comes with a freeware movie player, so you don't even 
              have to download one to give the movies away. 

              The _input_ formats include screen files, Apple Preferred 
              images (including 3200 images in Apple Preferred format) and 
              uncompressed RGB TIFF files (since QC Morph can handle far 
              more colors than you can display on a screen). 

              The morphs can be creates as grayscale, or in color using a 
              variety of palettes, including: the default 320 palette, the 
              default 640 palette (think HyperStudio movies), a custom 16 
              color palette, 128 colors, or 256 colors.  All can be saved 
              as PaintWorks movies.

QUESTION:  With the KarenCat morph, I can tell that you carefully 
positioned the eyes, nose, and mouth so the morph was smooth.  Is this a 
feature of the program or do you need to carefully pay attention to such 
details?

WESTERFIELD:  It's something you do, but it's very easy.  You start by 
              putting in a few points by clicking the mouse at the proper 
              location.  For KarenCat I started with four points around 
              each eye and four more around the mouth.  You then flip to 
              the final frame, and drag the points to the corresponding 
              position there.  If you get mixed up, color coding helps you 
              keep the dots straight.  After playing with a one or two 
              frame morph to see where the problems are, you add  more 
              points (in that case, around the outside of the head/ears and 
              along the chin) and try again until the results are good.  
              Finally, you up the number of frames, start the morph, and go 
              do something else for a while.  When you come back--presto, a 
              movie!

QUESTION:  Your description of Karencat indicates that you used other 
programs to create that morph.  Do you need all that to create morphs?

WESTERFIELD:  No, you don't _need_ anything else to use QC Morph.  Just 
              some starting pictures.

QUESTION:  Will QC Morph support the Second Sight card?

WESTERFIELD:  I'm looking into the possibility of supporting it, but don't 
              have one of the cards yet.  I'd also like to see how many 
              people will buy it before making too  big of a commitment.  
              But Second Sight would work _very_ well with 12 bit color 
              morphs!  Put it at about 80% based on the info I've seen so 
              far.  (For me, 80% is pretty high.)

QUESTION:  How long would it take to create a 15 second morph at 30 
frames/second?

WESTERFIELD:  The time depends on what you are doing and how many frames 
              per second you ask for.  The baseline time is about 17 
              seconds for a grayscale fade between two frames.  The time 
              goes up roughly 8 seconds per control point, and you need 
              about 15 for a passable morph; more for a really good one.  
              KarenCat used about 15-20.  When you add color, things slow 
              down even more.  For a very complicated morph with color and 
              a lot of control points, you will probably need to let the 
              computer run overnight.  On the other hand, the same is true 
              of the Mac and PC--they're faster, but in a way the GS screen 
              makes up for it by requiring less resolution.  :)

              QC Morph is about as fast as the program I've tested on the 
              50 MHz 486 machine, but slower than my PowerMac.

QUESTION:  Is that on an unaccelerated GS?

WESTERFIELD:  I'm running an accelerated GS.  That's where they are about 
              the same, but keep in mind that there are a _lot_ of 
              variables there!

QUESTION:  What are the limits on control points?  How many?

WESTERFIELD:  There is no limit on the number of control points, other than 
              available memory and screen clutter.  You can also pick 
              between control _points_ like Morph on the Mac, or control 
              _lines_, which work much better on many kinds of pictures, 
              especially hand-drawn or line-art originals.

QUESTION:  What is the overall limiting factor on the length of a movie?  
RAM or drive space?

WESTERFIELD:  RAM space.

QUESTION:  How much memory do stored movies generally take up?

WESTERFIELD:  That depends on how complex they are.  KarenCat is about 
              average for a picture morph; it uses about 17K per frame.

QUESTION:  4 megs of ram is good for how much morphing?

WESTERFIELD:  There are some variables, but it would be pretty save to 
              assume you can get 35 frames, probably more.  If the morph is 
              smaller than 320x200--say like the KarenCat morph--that goes 
              up a lot.  For something like KarenCat, the number of frames 
              would be closer to 100.

QUESTION:  Is there any way to link morphs together into a "slide show" for 
use in visual presentations?  Specifically, can you link more than one 
movie together into a slide show.

WESTERFIELD:  As in creating movie slide shows?  You bet.  Morph itself 
              doesn't do it, but the movie player does.  Let me clarify... 
              Morph can take as many originals as you like.  It always 
              creates a single movie, though.  The movie player (freeware) 
              will play multiple movies in a slide show.

QUESTION:  Mike, can you have QC Morph do a transition from an initial pic 
to a second, then to a third?  Or chain two transitions?

WESTERFIELD:  You bet.  Use as many original frames as you like.  The only 
              practical limit on anything--number of frames, number of 
              morphed frames, number of control points--is RAM and time.

QUESTION:  If you morph between two pictures, then after the fact want to 
add a third, can you append, or must you regenerate the sequence?

WESTERFIELD:  You just append the new one.  QC Morph knows that the 
              original morph sequence is not dirty, and does not use time 
              to regenerate it unless you change something that would 
              affect that part of the movie.

QUESTION:  Is there a way to link the movies into Hyperstudio, to allow the 
interposition of still frames, etc..?

WESTERFIELD:  Sure.  Hyperstudio uses movies as animations.  You can play 
              anything you create that way.  HyperLogo can play movies 
              under script control from Hyperstudio, too.

QUESTION:  How does it handle "color-shifts" if a control point is a 
different color in one frame than it is in the next?

WESTERFIELD:  For 128 and 256 color movies, Morph works internally with 
              full 12 bit colors, computing the actual best fit color for 
              every pixel in the picture on the morph pass, followed by a 
              color fit algorithm much like the ones used by SuperConvert 
              to reduce the colors to the best ones for the GS screen.  
              That takes a lot of time, of course.  I'm still playing with 
              that part of the code, though, so I can't give you final 
              numbers.  Suffice it to say you won't generate a 50 frame 128 
              color morph and sit watching the screen while you wait for 
              the results.  :)

QUESTION:  How does it handle it if the two pictures have different color 
palettes?  Does it dynamically remap the color palettes in between frames, 
or does it try to get a best fit out of the two and just switch at some 
point?

WESTERFIELD:  For some applications (like HyperStudio) you'll use a fixed 
              palette, but for most movies you'll choose between grayscale 
              or a custom color palette of 16, 128 or 256 colors.

              For a 16 color palette, Morph uses the original picture's 
              colors exclusively.  It works best if the original picture 
              and destination picture use the same palette, of course.  For 
              128 colors, the program actually calculates 12 bit color 
              internally.  Then for each frame, it picks the best 128 
              colors for that picture, using 8 palettes.  This gives a 
              smooth color transition between any pair of pictures, and the 
              starting and ending pictures can have very different color 
              palettes.

              With 256 colors, you'll usually start with similar pictures. 
               This gives a full 16 palettes for each frame, and the colors 
              remain fixed over each morph sequence,but for similar colored 
              start and stop frames, the results are better than for 128 
              color morphs.

QUESTION:  As I understand now, QC Morph constructs a PaintWorks movie that 
can be run in many venues, right?

WESTERFIELD:  Yes.  You see, PaintWorks itself may not handle 256 colors, 
              but the movie format _can_!  It's just delta frames, and you 
              can slip color table and SCB changes into the middle of any 
              PaintWorks movie!

QUESTION:  Does QC Morph utilize Publish & Subscribe?  Can you make a graph 
morph into another graph, for instance, in a QCC worksheet?

WESTERFIELD:  QC Morph does not use publish and subscribe, due to my 
              reluctance to write code I cannot test and the fact that 
              subscribing to movies from a spreadsheet, or spreadsheets 
              from a movie, didn't make much sense.  :)  If I do a QC 
              Write, I will definitely support Publishing of movies from QC 
              Calc and Subscribing to them from QC Write.

QUESTION:  Mike, what do the QC Calc sales numbers look like?  I bet QC 
Morph surpasses those!

WESTERFIELD:  QC Calc was pretty disappointing.  I think QC Morph will do 
              better too, though--or I wouldn't have written it, frankly.

QUESTION:  Will there ever be a QC Write?  If not, what's next?

WESTERFIELD:  Whether or not there is a QC Write depends a great deal on 
              how well QC Morph sells.

              I'd also like to mention that we'll be offering a new 
              service with QC Morph.  We have not worked out all the 
              details yet (i.e. price), but we will offer scanning 
              services, taking your pictures and converting them to TIFF 
              files you can load with QC Morph.  And BTW, QC Morph can 
              color convert those TIFF files to a variety of GS color 
              formats for you, too.  So watch for that service after we 
              finish out time studies to make sure we charge enough to pay 
              for the labor.  :)

              Also, for the mathematically inclined, I'll mention that you 
              can use QC Morph as a special effects package.  You can 
              export the dots positions, paths, and fade percent to an 
              ASCII file, edit them, and reload them.  Normally that would  
              be pretty anal, but you can do things like create a series of 
              morph lines that flip one  picture into another using a 
              mathematical transition you create from, say, BASIC, then 
              load the transition and use it on any two frames.  In fact, 
              this is the basis for a HyperStudio special effects package 
              that will come out someday.

Introducing AppleWorks 5
""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Jay Curtis
  [J.CURTIS8]



                >>> APPLEWORKS 5 BRINGS HOME THE USERS <<<
                """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Thanks to AppleWorks 5, I'm an Apple II user reborn!

     Some years ago, the office where I work embraced the Macintosh.  
Despite this, I have continued to use a IIgs at home.  I was even able to 
persuade my boss that the LC-III computer he purchased for my use should 
have a IIe card.  In time, however, the advantages of Apple II computing 
became less obvious.  I started to save my money for an eventual Mac 
purchase.

     This past winter, I spent some of that Mac money for an AppleWorks 
5.0 upgrade.  I'm sure glad that I did.  For the time being, I've stopped 
saving for a Mac.  I'm now saving instead for an H-P Deskjet printer and 
other refinements for one of my IIgses.  AppleWorks 5.0 is simply the 
smartest software purchase I have ever made.

     What makes AW5 so great is the speed, the convenience, the astounding 
level of integration that programmers Randy Brandt and Dan Verkade have 
built into the three modules, and the ease with which you can link 
documents.  Other integrated software products such as Microsoft Works and 
ClarisWorks just don't have the level of integration, the relational 
capabilities, or the speed that AppleWorks 5.0 possesses.  (This is no 
April fool's joke; they really don't have them.)  AW5 is a mature program 
that almost certainly goes well beyond anything that Robert Lissner ever 
envisioned when he created the original AppleWorks. 

     AW5's performance comes at a cost, however.  Some users may need 
additional memory to run this powerhouse.  According to the AW5 delta 
manual, a "minimum" of 256K is required to run AppleWorks 5.0.(1)  However, 
256K should really be considered a BARE minimum for AW5.  With 256K of RAM, 
you will get a respectable 100K of space for your desktop files on a IIe, 
but none of the modules will load into memory.  With limited RAM, you will 
be slowed down markedly while program segments are being accessed from 
disk, and you will be hard pressed to make full use of all of AW5's 
integration capabilities.  Asking AW5 to run in 256K is analogous to asking 
Frank Shorter to run the Boston Marathon on crutches. 

     While AW5's predecessor, AppleWorks 4.x, would run on 128K machines, 
the desktop size was only 20K with such machines, and a minimum of 320K was 
necessary to load ANY of the three AppleWorks modules.  For these reasons, 
128K of RAM was never really a practical minimum for AppleWorks 4.x, any 
more than 256K is now for AppleWorks 5.0.  For this latest version of 
AppleWorks, the effort to make it run in 128K has been abandoned.

     To make AW5 really sing, you will want to load all three modules to 
memory, make your TimeOut applications memory resident, and load your 
standard and custom dictionaries to a RAM disk.  (If you're storing 
AppleWorks 5 on a hard drive connected to a RamFAST SCSI card, there's 
really no advantage to loading AppleWorks modules, TimeOut applications, or 
dictionaries to RAM.)  Set "remember loaded files" to "yes," and set your 
printer buffer option to "yes."  Some may wish to increase spreadsheet rows 
from 999 to 9999, and many others will also want to keep UltraMacros and 
Init Manager active.  Just how much memory do you need for all of this?  
Some users will be satisfied with 512K, but 1 megabyte or more will provide 
a great deal more security, especially for those who work with large files 
and who want to make the fullest use of AW5's integration capabilities.

     What else do you need?  AppleWorks 5.0 and "extras" come from Quality 
Computers on a pair of 3.5" disks, period.  The 5.25" disks disappeared 
with the last version (although, if you want to install AW5 to a hard drive 
and only have 5.25" floppy drives, you can get a set of 5.25" disks for 
that purpose).  Your Apple II will need one or two 3.5" drives, or a hard 
disk drive and one microfloppy.  The majority of those who will read this 
article, and who are also interested in AW5's advanced features, will 
already possess the necessary system requirements to run it. 

     Although a mouse is not required, AW5 has a fully configurable mouse 
interface, similar to the capabilities UltraMacros gave to AppleWorks 3.0.  
The mouse is great to have, especially if you are someone who is used to 
also working with GS or Mac desktop applications.  Additionally, a clock is 
a definite "must have" with AW5.  While a clock is not required, AW5 has a 
number of time-dependent features that offer great convenience, and you'll 
need a clock to access them.

     There may be a few folks (hopefully VERY few) who are still running 
AppleWorks on 128K Apple IIe systems or 256K IIgs systems.  To those 
people, I believe that it is reasonable to say that upgrading your system 
AND purchasing AppleWorks 5.0 will still be considerably cheaper than 
buying a new computer.  It will cost you under $500 (much less if you 
purchase used equipment) for the necessary upgrades to make AW5 basically 
BLOW THE DOORS off of most current 4MB Mac systems running ClarisWorks or 
Microsoft Works under System 7.  It's something to think about.

     AppleWorks 5.0 has a number of new features that make Quality 
Computer's $59.95 upgrade from AppleWorks 4.x extremely worthwhile.  Some 
of these features include an outliner and print previewer in the word 
processor, background text in single record layout in the database, and the 
ability to install cell memos or notes in the spreadsheet. Another really 
great, new feature is the ability to view database files in what is called 
"mixed mode," both single record layout AND multiple record layout, 
simultaneously. There's an "AfterWork" screen saver, alarm clock reminder 
function, "@today" function in the database, and there's also the ability 
to actually view pictures in the database. The new capability of AW5 to 
print odd or even pages will come in especially handy when you print 
document pages back-to-front with that new HP Deskjet that you're going to 
want.

     As mentioned previously, there are also several new features that 
mean speed--lots of speed.  For example, there is now a FULL Ultramacros 
package (which allows you to WRITE and compile, as well as RUN, these 
macros) and thereby customize those repetitive tasks that are unique to 
your computing habits.  There is an excellent desktop organizer that 
remembers the files you access and speedily returns them to the desktop 
after you leave and return to AppleWorks.  There are also "one touch" 
menus, a "memory manager" that allows you to easily set up and access a RAM 
disk on most Apple II systems, and there's a built-in printer buffer that 
gets you back to work much faster after you send documents to the printer.  
For me, all of this speed has been a welcome change from the lethargic 
Microsoft Works running on my 4MB Mac at the office.

     I should also mention that AppleWorks 5.0 comes from Quality with 
more goodies and enhancements than I have been able to explore in several 
weeks of part-time perusal.  There are tons of macros, Randy's Free 
Patcher, TimeOut Paint, the TimeOut Updater (to make those favorite TO 
utilities run under AW5), the TO Ultra Compiler, and Steven Beville's 
excellent "DB Link" Utility.  Next month, we'll turn our attention more to 
the AppleWorks 4.x engine that runs inside of AW5.  The features of 
AppleWorks 4.x, together with the new features of AppleWorks 5.0, make the 
$79.95 upgrade to AW5 from earlier versions undoubtedly the greatest 
software value that has ever been offered to Apple II users.

APPLEWORKS 5 ON THE MAC:  THE FUTURE OF APPLEWORKS?   For any Macintosh
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   users who happen to 
be reading this, the answer is "Yes."  AW5 runs nicely on LC-style MACs 
with the IIe card.  VERY nicely.  However, you should configure your system 
for 1MB of RAM in Apple II mode and install a minimum 10MB ProDOS HD 
partition on your Mac hard drive.  Set your display to "Monochrome" and 
your system speed to "Fast" for best performance. Mac users will find that 
there are a number of things that they can do with AppleWorks 5.0 that they 
simply cannot do with most Mac integrated software products, and most 
certainly NOT for the price of AW5. 

     The exciting news is that you will soon be able to run AppleWorks 5 
without a IIe card.  This new method will almost certainly outperform the 
IIe card!  During a recent interview with Randy Brandt, this writer was 
given an opportunity to SEE AppleWorks 5.0 running in emulation on Brandt's 
Centris 610.  The emulation has been code-named the "Phoenix II" by Randy 
Brandt and his collaborator, veteran AppleWorks programmer Mark Munz.  The 
emulation requires Macintosh System 7 and a 68020 Mac or newer.  Randy 
explained that I was only the third person besides himself and Mark to 
actually see the emulation.   He said that it was approximately the 
thirtieth revision of the "Phoenix II" since they had begun working on it.

     I asked Randy how he and Mark Munz had been able to license the Apple 
II ROMs for their emulation.  He grinned and explained that NO Apple II ROM 
code had been used to develop the emulator.  The emulator runs in a window 
on the Mac desktop and has been designed specifically for use with 
AppleWorks 5.0.  It translates 65c02 assembly code that AW5 is written in, 
and the ProDOS calls, directly to Mac code and System 7 calls, bypassing 
the need to emulate an Apple II ROM altogether.  The emulator takes up only 
120k of additional disk space and is placed in a folder on the Mac hard 
drive together with AW5.

     Because Phoenix II makes no attempt at full Apple II emulation, it is 
a much faster way of running AW5.  Additionally, running AW5 under Phoenix 
II is also considerably faster than running the program on an Apple IIe PDS 
card which, in effect, provides IIe performance.  One other advantage over 
the PDS card, according to Brandt, is that AW5's operation on the Mac 
desktop is virtually "seamless," just like any other Mac application.

     As promised, speed was indeed blindingly fast.  All of the AW5 
functions that Randy demonstrated on his Centris left my unaccelerated IIgs 
in the dust.  Randy launched AW5 from an icon on his Mac hard drive.  The 
program opened, displayed the familiar sequence of screens and arrived at 
the AppleWorks main menu in a fraction of the time it takes for my 
RamFAST-equipped IIgs to run through the same sequence from ProSEL.  Given 
that there are both native Mac AND Power Mac versions of the emulation, 
Randy said that AppleWorks' speed will only increase as more of the Mac 
operating system is converted to Power Mac code, and the Power Mac moves 
beyond the 601 RISC processor to the 604 and above.  He said confidently 
that the speed gains for AW5 running on a Power Mac will soon surpass even 
the fastest ACCELERATED IIgs or IIe.

     Like any other Mac program, the AW5 window can be moved around on the 
Mac desktop, and the Mac menu bar remains visible at all times.  AW5 can be 
left to run in the background while other Mac programs are accessed.  
Imagine... AppleWorks running in the background!

     With standard white fonts on a black background, its appearance on 
the Mac was virtually the same as it normally appears on an Apple II.  
However, users will be able to change the appearance of the emulation 
somewhat by changing the font types and by using the Mac's reverse, 
black-on-white screen.  UltraMacros, TimeOut and other modifications run 
the same under the Mac emulation as they do on any Apple II.  Users will be 
able to write and record their macros or add TimeOut features just as they 
always have done.

     The old 1MB memory barrier for running AppleWorks on the Apple IIe 
PDS card has been surpassed by Phoenix II.  Randy demonstrated how he could 
allocate up to 4MB of space to AppleWorks on his Centris, and he also 
demonstrated the "save snapshot" feature from the Mac menu bar.  If you 
don't like to go through the continual hassle of saving your files back to 
disk, shutting down, then rebooting and trying to remember which files you 
wanted to call up and where they were located, you will no longer have to 
bother with all of this.  You can "save a snapshot" of your session back to 
your Mac hard drive instead.  That means that you can instantly save all 36 
files from your 3 desktops, 1MB or more of stuff if that's what you've got, 
back to your hard drive.  You can do this in the middle of a spreadsheet 
recalculation or a database sort if you like.  Reboot your snapshot at some 
later time and you can come right back to where you were in your earlier 
AppleWorks session.

     When I shook hands with Randy at the end of the interview, my head 
was absolutely spinning.  I couldn't stop grinning from ear to ear even 
after I had left.  As Randy had said, AppleWorks running on a Mac is "not a 
novelty."  Mark Munz, Randy and the others have really done it; they've 
created a serious integrated software program that will now run on Mac 
systems, and it possesses features that make it a tough competitor.  Randy 
said that a PC version of the Phoenix II is also planned. 

     The native Mac and Power Mac versions will be supplied together for 
the same cost, and should be available by summer according to Brandt.  
Additionally, although no formal price has yet been set for AW5 bundled 
with the Phoenix II, Randy indicated that the emulator by itself will 
likely sell for a fraction of the price of a IIe PDS card.  It sounds 
strange to say, but unless Claris and Microsoft pay attention here, they 
could easily get blindsided in their integrated software business by none 
other than AppleWorks 5.0 and Phoenix II.  These days, it's a topsy-turvy 
world of emulation software and RISC-based computing where ANYTHING can 
happen and probably will.  More information from my interview with Randy 
Brandt about AW5 will be available in future installments.

(1) The AW5 delta manual says that, strictly speaking, AW5 "will load with 
only 192K of memory."  However, "little or no desktop memory" would be left 
over for documents with just 192K (p. 89).

EASTERCARDS.BXY   File #18300    14848 bytes    Publish It! Templates

     This requires Publish It!  It includes one Easter card and one Easter 
brunch invitation. It was designed by Vivian Lynes for AzApple User Group.  
The clipart was scanned by Pat Kern.  Load it into Publish It!  Install 
Kenilworth.12 font if you have it; otherwise Wilmette.12 or even Ravinia.18 
works nicely for the Easter card. The inside text for the Easter brunch is 
only a sample; rewrite it to suit your needs.


EAS.REC.TWO.BXY   File #20555    16896 bytes    Publish It! Templates

     This also requires Publish It!  Just unpack the file and load it into

been placed for you.  Several Easter recipes for two servings--meat, side 
dishes, breakfast, and beverages.  Also, a recipe to use chopped hard 
cooked eggs in Mexican style dish.  Even how to hard cook eggs.  Clipart & 
layout were done by Pat Kern.  Score another plus for Pat. :)

EASTER.EGGS.BXY   File #9231     12600 bytes    AppleWorks 3.0 data base

     Before we leave the subject of Easter altogether, let's talk about 
Easter eggs.  No, not the kind that the Easter bunny leaves, but the hidden 
messages and features that programmers build into their programs.  These 
goodies are hidden, and you have to hunt for them... unless someone has 
compiled a list Easter eggs, and someone has!  (NOTE:  The file is only 
partly concerned with Easter eggs.  It also explain how to makes copies of 
programs that are copy-protected, how to cheat at games, and hints.)  This 
file was last updated on December 14, 1989, but it contains a lot of 
goodies.  You'll be amazed just how easy it is to cheat at the original 
LodeRunner game... you'll think the programmer _wanted_ you to cheat!

                                 [*][*][*]

questions are welcome in Category 29, Topic 16 of the Apple II bulletin 
board.

CP.SPC.V255.BXY   File #24480    257792 bytes   CoPilot for Spectrum

CP.PT3.V255.BXY   File #24479    320896 bytes   CoPilot for ProTERM

CP.FIX.V255.BXY   File #24478    31616 bytes    CoPilot Update Fixes

     If you've downloaded CoPilot before, or the version you have is not 
v2.5.5, then you don't need this file!  This archive contains some minor 
fixes for the earlier releases of CoPilot v2.5.5.  If you were one of the 
approximately 230 people who downloaded these archives, these script 
replacements will make your CoPilot installation consistent with the full 
archives currently in the A2 Library.  If you have the ProTERM version and 
have fixed the GetBill problem, you DON'T need this.  Only downloaders of 
the now deleted earlier uploads need to download this archive.  The archive 
accommodates GEnie's new prompts in the BILLING area and provides fixes for 
TIC and Spectrum bugs that have shown up since the earlier offerings.

CP.REPLCMNT.BXY   File 24552     103168 bytes   Spectrum 2.0 Replacement

     These are not "official" scripts, but Ken Lucke's special scripts that 
allow CoPilot to take advantage of the features of Spectrum 2.0.  You MUST 
be using CoPilot v2.5.4 or later and Spectrum v2.0--these scripts will NOT 
work with earlier versions of EITHER program.  This is v1.1 of these 
scripts, some new features added since v1.0 as well as the bug fixes. 
Unpack using GSHK or Balloon to the folder that contains your GECoPilot 
program file, with overwrite mode turned on.  DO NOT mix these files with 
v1.0 of Ken Lucke's scripts.  Discussions of these scripts takes place in 
Category 29, Topic 24.

     Tom Zuchowski has produced a series of files to index the entire Apple 
II RoundTable library.  The files are available in two main versions, a 
simple ASCII text version, and a version requiring AppleWork 3.0.  Here is 
all you need to know to select the files that you need:

     It can be a very time-consuming chore to search the A2 Library for the 
neat files you want.  That's why we have assembled the A2 Library Indexes 
for you.  You can download the Index and peruse the files safely offline 
with the billing clock stopped!

     The A2 Library Index is available in several different configurations

     Quick Click Calc is a spreadsheet program for the Apple IIgs that 
uses the familiar desktop environment.  I can't tell you whether or not you 
need a spreadsheet program, but if you do, then you should seriously 
consider Quick Click Calc.  Spreadsheet programs are never glamorous, but 
Quick Click Calc has a solid and a comfortable feel.

     I can't compare Quick Click Calc with AppleWorks GS; I've never used 
the latter.  I'll do my best not to compare Quick Click Calc with the 
spreadsheet in AppleWorks classic, although that's the spreadsheet with 
which I'm most familiar.  Quick Click Calc shares a few minor concepts with 
Lotus 1-2-3, too, so anyone familiar with any spreadsheet program should 
feel at home.

     Quick Click Calc began life as part of the concerted effort to 
produce version 2.0 of AppleWorks GS.  Programmer Mike Westerfield 
obviously felt that even if AppleWorks GS wasn't to be revived, this new 
spreadsheet module should.  Between you and me, that was the right guess.

Re-introducing the Desktop   One of the great things about Quick Click Calc 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   is that it makes sensible use of the desktop.  
I happen to dislike both the graphic user interface and using a mouse, so 
it comes as a pleasant surprise to find that Quick Click Calc makes good 
use of both.  It's actually easier to use the mouse than the keyboard to 
select cells.  I'm used to the feeling that I'd rather use the keyboard 
instead, if only the programmer would let me.  I had none of that hemmed-in 
feeling with Quick Click Calc--it's the first program to make my heart go 
all GUI!

     One of the aspects that makes the desktop environment work is the 
fact that you can set the size of your spreadsheet.  The default size is ZZ 
columns (702) by 999 rows, but it can take quite a while to scroll down 999 
rows.  If you set the number of rows to 25 or 50, then scrolling to the 
bottom of a spreadsheet is fast and easy.  Another gem is the fact that you 
can select blocks of cells by clicking in the cell that forms one corner of 
the block, then move to the cell that forms the corner diagonally 
opposite... without having the drag your selection.  Dragging from one cell 
to another to select a block can take quite a long time.  So Quick Click 
Calc allows you to click in one corner, move to the other corner and simply 
press the Shift key before clicking on the opposite corner.  This 
demonstrates the difference between a program that's easy to program (easy 
on the programmer) and one that's easy to use (easy on the user)!

     Quick Click Calc endeavors to provide a certain amount of flexibility 
by being compatible with The Manager, a desktop-switching program that 
would allow you to have more than one program in memory, but its most 
important capacity for the sharing of data is its publish and subscribe 
capabilities.

Publish and Subscribe   Publish and subscribe has been described as a 
"""""""""""""""""""""   super-powerful version of copy and paste.  Publish 
and subscribe allows you to create little reminder files ("editions") that 
tell the computer to copy data from one file into others.  Not only does 
this relieve you from having to remember to copy new information each time 
it changes--not to mention to tedium of actually having to do it--but it 
can copy the data to more than one file at a time.

     Suppose, for example, that you keep track of your outstanding credit 
card charges in one file, your checkbook in another, and your general 
finances in a third file.  Publish and subscribe allows you to copy the 
totals of your credit card and your checkbook file into the general 
finances file.

     Using publish and subscribe also means you can eliminate distracting 
subtotal columns by publishing the information to a separate spreadsheet.  
You could use the data in general finances to publish a table of your 
monthly electricity bills.  Don't forget that you can publish to more than 
one spreadsheet at a time:  your checkbook balance is a figure that might 
be required by several spreadsheets, and publish and subscribe allows you 
to have an updated figure in all of them.

     The only problem with publish and subscribe that I can see is that 
doesn't have the immediacy of copy and paste.  It's not enough to change a 
file on the desktop; that won't affect the other files.  You'll have to 
save the files that "publish" data and reload those that "subscribe" to 
data, or use the built-in commands that force a spreadsheet to update 
manually.  This limitation seems to be linked to the very power of publish 
and subscriber.  You don't get immediacy, but this lack of immediacy means 
that you don't have to have a file on the desktop in order to use data in 
it.  Not a bad trade-off.


Three Types of Graphs   The graphing capacities of Quick Click Calc are 
"""""""""""""""""""""   quietly impressive.  It will produce pie charts, 
line charts, and bar charts.  It will even produce three-dimensional line 
and bar charts.

     The feature I appreciate most about the line chart option is that you 
can plot a curve fit, which allows you to see the general trend of a chart 
as opposed to the plotting of individual values.  The feature I like best 
about bar charts is that you can choose a conventional bar chart, or a 
stacked one.  This is useful for comparing elements of a trend to an 
overall trend.  For example, suppose that you are comparing--month by 
month--how many minutes you spend connected to GEnie, Delphi, and 
CompuServe.  In a conventional chart, you look at how the services compare 
to each other ("hey, I use GEnie twice as much as I do the other two put 
together").  In a stack bar chart, you can compare all the time you spent 
online that month on all three services ("uh-oh, I'm spending five hours a 
day tying up the phone line").

     Anything that helps you visualize a trend or correlation makes for a 
better spreadsheet, and Quick Click Calc's graphing capabilities do a good 
job here.  A nice extra is the ability to change the size of the graph by 
dragging the grow box.  You'd expect playing with the window size to change 
the size of the _window_ for the graph, but it doesn't.  It actually 
changes the size of the graph itself.  This means you can have teeny little 
graphs dotted around your desktop as you work, reminding you of the general 
trends.  You won't be able to read the labels, but what the heck.  You've 
got an overview.

More Features   Another feature of Quick Click Calc is the cell note.  This 
"""""""""""""   allows you to attach a comment to a cell, which might 
remind you of the source of a figure, or how it breaks down, or what other 
spreadsheets this cell affects.  (Although AppleWorks 5 does feature cell 
notes, Quick Click Calc doesn't know about it, so it doesn't import them.  
However, it's quite an easy matter to retrieve them.  AppleWorks 5 stores 
its cell notes as cells in the DR-DW range, and it's quite simple to copy 
them from those cells into a cell note.)

     Quick Click Calc allows you to choose the font, point size, style, 
and color for each cell individually.  All of this means that you can 
produce visually impressive printed versions of your spreadsheets.  Owners 
of AppleWorks classic will be particularly impressed at how much more 
attractive Quick Click Calc printouts are.  They're also likely to be 
easier to read!  Heck, they're even easier to read on the screen.

     Quick Click Calc's border feature helps here, too--on screen or on 
paper.  It allows you to draw separator lines on the top, on the bottom, to 
the left, or to the right of any cell.  Of course, you can have as many 
borders as you like--all four, a combination of three or two, just one, or 
none.

     Valuable options are not necessarily those you use every day.  Quick 
Click Calc offers you the chance to encrypt a file, so that it cannot be 
opened or viewed without a password.  I've used this feature on just two 
files--ones I rarely update--which means I don't use it a lot, but it sure 
is valuable when I do need it.  The encryption provided seems to be 
adequate to stop an honest man.  If all you're worried about is some nosy 
parker idly loading your spreadsheet files to find out how much you spend 
on ivory back-scratchers in a year, worry no more... Quick Click Calc's 
encryption will foil them.  If you have professional code-breakers on your 
block, then maybe Quick Click Calc won't protect you.  But presumably you 
have bigger worries if professional code-breakers have access to your 
computer.

     Another great feature is the transpose command, which takes a block 
and switches the rows and columns.  If your data looks like this (before):

     1    2    3         4    5
     6    7    8         9    10
     11   12   13        14   15

then you can use the transpose command to make it look like this in one 
easy step (after):

     1    6    11
     2    7    12
     3    8    13
     4    9    14
     5    10   15

This is particularly handy in conjunction with line and bar charts.  These 
charts assume that the points of data you want to plot are progress in 
rows---that is, if it's a monthly chart, that Jan, Feb, Mar, etc. appear 
down the top of the screen, and not along the left side.  If you've created 
a spreadsheet with the months listed on the side, the transpose command 
will save you a lot of trouble in creating a chart.

     Another little detail that you'll appreciate is that Quick Click Calc 
lets you type 11% exactly that way--it won't balk and complain when you 
type the % part.  Such little things can make a big difference.


A Few Quibbles   The major drawback to Quick Click Calc is that owners of 
""""""""""""""   unaccelerated IIgses might find the program a little slow.  
Filling down and filling right are particularly time-consuming.  True, some 
actions that seems to slow down the program are taking place in the 
background (a background that takes precedence until the user provides some 
input, but a background nonetheless).  However, this requires some getting 
used to.

     Another aspect that takes some getting used to is the way Quick Click 
Calc handles absolute cell references.  I know I promised not to be forever 
comparing Quick Click Calc to AppleWorks classic, but just this once, okay?  
When copying cells in AppleWorks, only after you have made the important 
decisions about what to copy and where to copy it are you forced to deal 
with the lower-priority issue of whether you want formula references copies 
as is, or relatively.  That is to say, if a cell contains a reference to 
A1.A3, do you want it to remain exactly the same when copied one column to 
the right?  Or do you want it updated so that the reference becomes B1.B3?  
Mike Westerfield has said he will consider adding a "hot key" to force 
absolute values at copying time in a future version.

     The manual is a little on the sparse side.  It begins with a few 
tutorials to get you used both to the use of a spreadsheet program and the 
special details of Quick Click Calc.  These specific examples are most 
welcome.  After that, the manual seems to be more of a quick reference 
guide.  It's perfectly adequate for those familiar with spreadsheets and 
the IIgs desktop interface, but other than that, it's just a sort of 
starting-place to explore Quick Click Calc.  Exploring the rest of Quick 
Click Calc seems to be an exercise left to the purchaser.

     One little bug I observed:  Sometimes, when you create split windows, 
you'll find that one window has a thumb of maximum size, which means it 
isn't possible to scroll in that window.  Not to worry, because you just 
have to move the split line slightly and all will be will.

     Little things that I wish Quick Click Calc would change:  I wish it 
was possible to configure the colors used to draw the charts.  When drawing 
a line chart, your first of four lines is drawn in red, followed by a 
yellow, blue, and green.  As editor of GEnieLamp A2, I tend to create line 
graphs that compare A2's popularity compared to the IBM and Mac versions of 
GEnieLamp, and I want red to stand for Apple II, blue for IBM, and pretty 
much any other color for other versions such as Mac.  This means I have to 
arrange the rows of data so that Apple II comes first, and IBM third.  
What's worse is that bar charts substitute the two middle colors, blue and 
yellow.

               Line      Bar
               ''''      '''
     Color 1   red       red
     Color 2   yellow    blue
     Color 3   blue      yellow
     Color 4   green     green

     You'll have to get used to things more commonly found in spreadsheets 
on other platforms, such as = to indicate the beginning of a formula (not 
+), $ to indicate that a cell reference is absolute, and a cell range 
expressed by A1:A3 instead of A1...A3 or A1.A3.

     A tip for those importing AppleWorks classic spreadsheets:  If you 
run into any difficulty, don't give up.  Reboot your IIgs--shift boot, if 
necessary--and try again.  I've had a few conversions fail on the first try 
but be successful if I start afresh.  Watch out, though, because Quick 
Click Calc will only transfer the values and formulae, and not the 
formatting information of a file.  For instance, if you have column widths 
customized, you'll have to recustomize them after you load your files into 
Quick Click Calc.

     All these drawbacks are quite minor, and I wouldn't be the least bit 
surprised if some were addressed in upcoming revisions.  Earlier version of 
Quick Click Calc had some trouble importing AppleWorks classic spreadsheet 
files; as of Quick Click Calc v1.2, the problems seem to be gone.  Also, 
v1.2 features more preferences, such as the ability to use European or 
American date formats, decimal formats and money formats.

Great Support   As with all Byte Works products, I found support to be 
"""""""""""""   outstanding, even for a small company... where humanity and 
reasonableness are more often found.  (I used electronic mail for my 
support, but I'm sure writing or phoning would result in equally close 
attention being paid.)  And let's face it, at $60, the price is sure right.

     As I said above, the Byte Works listens to customers' suggestions for 
improvements.  If enough people use Quick Click Calc to make it worthwhile, 
you can be sure Byte Works will add more custom options, such as letter 
grades (A-F) that don't correspond to the 4.0 grade-point system.  (The 
university I attended uses a 3.0 system, worse luck.)

     Byte Works _listens_ to their users.  What more do you want in the 
way of support?

More Quick Clicks...?   When you look at the cover of the Quick Click Calc 
"""""""""""""""""""""   manual, you can't help be struck by the fact that 
the Quick Click logo and the word Calc are separately entities.  The Byte 
Works obviously had expansion in mind--possibly a word processor called 
Quick Click Word or Quick Click Write.  Indeed, the second product in the 
line, Quick Click Morph, was announced in mid-March.

     At KansasFest 1994, Mike Westerfield said that Quick Click Calc grew 
out of his efforts to provide an spreadsheet module for Quality Computers' 
proposed release of AppleWorks GS 2.0.  I couldn't help but wonder if the 
QC had been transformed from Quality Computers to Quick Click when the 
AppleWorks GS 2.0 project foundered.  Mike Westerfield says not:  "There is 
no connection between Quick Click and Quality Computer other than an 
accidental correspondence of initials."  (But apparently I wasn't the only 
one to ask. :-)

     Sales of Quick Click Calc have not been good enough to warrant a 
Quick Click word processor.  Byte Works is trying again, though, with Quick 
Click Morph.  If sales of Morph are more impressive, or if sales of Quick 
Click Calc suddenly pick up, we may indeed see a word processor and 
possibly even a data base in the Quick Click series.  Since the Quick Click 
series is designed to use publish and subscribe wherever possible, this 
should mean that data from one module can easily be transported to another.

Final Word   In summary, Quick Click Calc is a good bet for anyone who 
""""""""""   needs to store or manipulate numeric data, but particularly 
good for those who want to produce sharp charts or attractive printouts.  
Buy it!
