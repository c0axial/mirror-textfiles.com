                      >>> THE SHAME OF SENTIMENT <<<
                      """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     As I write this, it's almost exactly halfway between the Canadian and 
American Thanksgiving Days.  Up north, we celebrated Thanksgiving about 
three weeks ago; readers in the States still have three weeks to go.

     This Thanksgiving, I'm thankful for a lot of things I took for 
granted five years ago.  I'm thankful that my wife and I have a clean, warm 
apartment to live in, and that we've never had to go a day without food.  
I'm thankful that my wife's sister and her husband has moved to within an 
hour's drive of us instead of three days'; it makes us feel a little less 
like strangers in a strange land.

     I'm also thankful for my GEnieLamp boss, John Peters.  His wise and 
kind words have helped me through many a tough time over the last year and 
a half.

     When I was at KansasFest this July, I met John and Mike "Cowboy" 
White for the first time.  Mike and John were pressed-ganged into giving 
Steve "Apple II History" Weyhrich and me a ride back from a party, and the 
talk turned to highway driving.

     "I like cruise control," Mike said, "but sometimes I feel a little 
silly with everybody else whooshing past me."

     "But they aren't," J. P. pointed out.  "You're just registering the 
people who are speeding.  You never get to see all the other people 
travelling at the same speed you are, obeying the speed limit.  They stay 
just as far ahead of you or behind you as you they ever were."

     Maybe it isn't pithy and maybe it isn't profound, but I appreciated 
the insight.  Have you ever been intimated by the illusion that you're in 
the minority if you toe the line?  I sure have.  When I was younger, I 
occasionally followed the crowd even though I knew it was wrong.

     I don't pirate software, but I've had gentle and otherwise 
intelligent people ask me to provide copies of programs I own legitimate 
copies of.  The implication is clear:  they consider that they would be 
gullible to follow a law that is almost impossible to enforce.

     My wife is taking her computer science degree at the local 
university, and just last week, a classmate who was proselytizing on behalf 
of a group offered to "tape off" one of their CDs so that she could truly 
appreciate their magnificence.  She declined politely.  When asked why, she 
pointed out that it was illegal.

     Recently, one of my oldest friends asked me to make a copy of a 
videotape he had purchased on my behalf many years before.  It wasn't easy 
to refuse an old friend, particularly one who had done me the favor of 
obtaining the video, but I did it, and explained why.

     Sometimes one gets met with a disbelieving stare.  Sometimes the 
response is a tolerant smile usually reserved for those who believe that 
the potatoes for the Sabbath meal must be peeled the night before, since 
it's sinful to work on the Sabbath; a sort of wordless "Oh really?  I don't 
believe in that myself, but of course this is a free country."

     When it seems that everybody is doing it, there is a pressure to 
conform, a concern about looking foolish in the eyes of your peers.  It's 
no easier for me than it is for anyone else to speak up and risk being seen 
as a holier-than-thou zealot or a hopeless naif.  It doesn't seem to be 
getting any easier, either; it's a struggle each time.  I do it, though; 
even though I am not bathed in a Disneyesque glow--akin to smugness--of 
knowing I've done the right thing.

     This year, I'm thankful that I finally got to go to KansasFest, and 
happy about the many online acquaintances that I finally got to meet--John 
Peters, Mike White, and Steve Weyhrich are just three of them.  I'm also 
thankful that I have a boss with a good deal of common sense (and a certain 
talent for Charades even after a long day).

     Actually, these days, I'm the servant of many masters, so I have a 
lot of bosses, and all of them are good folk... but let them get their own 
editorial, this one is for John.

publishers of AppleWorks.  He would like to point out that, the foregoing 
editorial notwithstanding, he does not owe his boss John Peters any money, 
nor is he trying to stave off his inevitable dismissal as editor of 
GEnieLamp A2, nor is there any truth to the rumor that he is in need of 
character witnesses in the patently ludicrous paternity suit that Bigfoot 
and Elvis have filed jointly.  He would also like to assure all his bosses 
that he will return to his serious and grumpy old self the minute 
Thanksgiving is over.]

TRUETYPE FROM MS-DOS   Assuming one can get them onto a GS compatable disk, 
""""""""""""""""""""   what has to be done to make MessyDos TrueType fonts

"""""   Macintosh. Then you have to spend a few hours getting things like 
style bits, font names, and font ID numbers right.  Then just put them on 
an HFS disk and pop it in a GS. :)
          (T.BUCHHEIM, CAT37, TOP4, MSG:386/M645;1)

>>>>>   It's not for the faint of heart...or those lacking in computers. 
"""""   You can make the conversion if you have an MS-DOS computer 
(possibly optional), a Macintosh, and your IIgs.

     1) Make sure the TT fonts on the MS-DOS disk are "NAME.TTF", and not 
"NAME.TT_".  The latter fonts have some compression that has to be de- 
compressed before they are usuable.  This would be the only situation where 
you would NEED an MS-DOS computer.  Just use the Utility included with the 
fonts to install them into Windows.  

     2) Transfer the MS.DOS "TTF" font files to a Macintosh using Apple 
File Exchange (AFE) on the Mac.

     3) Download the shareware program TT Converter from the Mac RT.  Run 
each TTF file through TT Converter, and it will make it usable by the Mac.  
Note that the filename given by TT Converter to some fonts with similar 
names may be close enough that you will get an error when trying to do it.  
(For example, Bozo Bold and Bozo Bold-Italic might both be given the name 
Bozo BO by TT Converter; attempting to convert the second one will cause an 
error and the program will quit).

     4) Put the converted files on an HFS 3.5 disk, and put it into the 
IIgs.

     5) Move the files from the HFS 3.5 disk to wherever you want them on 
the IIgs hard drive.

     6) Use the Pointless control panel to load each of the converted Mac 
fonts. Pointless will change them from typeless files ($00/0000) to proper 
TT fonts ($C8/0001).

     There's more if you want to be fancy, but that's the quick and dirty.

     I hope this is not a sigh of things to come.  (Typo intended)

     The heavy cover keeps it in one piece through the mail, thank you.  
Your printer, however, leaves something to be desired: pages 17-24 were 
partially uncut, but that's probably because it was stapled so crooked 
(pages 17-32 section).

     Still love the magazine - keep up _your_ good work, and talk to your

PATCH FOR APPLEWORKS GS DEFAULT FONT   from a few years back:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   

     1) Page Layout module:

     Look for block $49B, byte $9C (version 1.0v2: block $24F, byte $EC).  
You should find the following sequence there:

A9 03 00       LDA #3         (family #)
8D 73 1B       STA            store family
A9 00 00       LDA #0         (style word)
8D 75 1B       STA            store style
A9 0C 00       LDA #$C        (size word)
8D 77 1B       STA            store size
A9 19 99       LDA #$10       justification
8D 71 1B       STA            store justification
A9 01 00       LDA #1         (spacing)
8D 6F 1B       STA            store spacing

     2) Word processor:

     This patch is divided into two steps: a) block $609, by $93 (version 
1.0v2: block $4EE, byte $02)

A9 03 00       LDA #3         (family #)
87 0B          STA [$B]
A9 00 0C       LDA #$0C00     (size(high) and style(low) )
A0 02 00       LDY #2
97 0B          STA [$B],Y

     b) and again on block $64F, byte 141 (version 1.0v2: block $533, byte 
$18)

A9 03 00 87 08 A9 00 0C A0 02 00 97 07

     So what do you have to patch in here? These are the descriptions 
(we're looking at 1) for reference):

     - font family number ($03=Geneva, $14 would be Times)
     - style (0=plain, 1=bold, 2=italic, 4=underline, 8=outline, 
       $10=shadow, $40=superscript, $80=subscript)
     - size ($0C=12 point)
     - justification ($10=left, $20=center, $40=right, $80=full)
     - spacing (1=single, 2=double, 4=quadruple (right word??? :-)  )

VGC CHIP NUMBERS   Hot diggity!  I can answer a hardware question that 
""""""""""""""""   Harold can't! That's not apt to happen again this 
century ...which ends Dec. 31, 2000. :)

     When I was upgrading my IIgs's for computer camp, the Apple 
serviceman copied the pertinent page from Apple's manual (rev. May '91).  
According to this, the VGC is in location H2 on the motherboard, and...

     Defective VGC's are numbered 344S0046-1 or 344S0046-A (Vendor: AMI) 
and should be replaced.

     The following VGC versions are considered good and do not need to be 
replaced: 344S0046-2 or 344s0046-B (Vendor: AMI).

     Any of the following may be used as VGC replacements: 344S0046-2, -3, 
-4, - B, -C, or -D (Vendor: AMI); 344S0056-A or 3440056-1 (Vendor: IMP).

     I suspect Harold could have looked these up.  He just didn't have  
the numbers memorized (tch, tch! :)

I set up the examples from the DeskJet 500 Translation table in my Harmonie

WHY DOES TIC.KEY.Z HAVE A SHRINKIT ICON?   The problem is with your 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   SHRINKIT icons file. It has a 
"generic" icon in it that is supposed to show up for ZIP files, and it is 
hitting on the .Z

     You need to modify that Icon file, or delete it, or just ignore it. 
The ONLY problem that you will have here is if you try to launch that 
TIC.KEY.Z script from Finder, in which case, GSHK will be launched instead. 
Aside from that, the script will work just as it is supposed to regardless 
of the fact that it shows the wrong icon.

Run Apple software on your PC! SimSystem IIe emulates a 128K Apple IIe with

all Apple graphics modes, joystick, and sound! Runs Apple DOS, ProDOS, 
AppleWorks, games, utilities, even many protected programs! 65C02 monitor

PMPFAX SOFTWARE STILL IN PROGRESS   Well, the phone book routines are 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   finished :)  I'll be working on the 
send batches next.

     This is how it'll work:  You'll be able to set up multiple phone 
books. Each of these phone books can have a combination of book entries 
(which have the person's name, an organization, and their fax number) and 
groups. Groups are a collection of book entries and other groups.  When you 
send a fax, you'll be able to pick an entry or a group to send the fax to 
from any of the phone books you have configured.  Sending to groups will be 
handy when you have a particular fax job that you want to send to multiple 
people.

     The send batches will consist of a variety of different page types. 
You'll be able to include print pages (that is, pages that are  captured 
from any application that you can print from), an optional cover page 
(you'll be able to include various fax variables in them, including the 
name and organization, date and time, total pages, and a comment or memo 
field), pages from another saved send batch, pages from a received batch, 
or APF and PIC files.  Send batches will automatically be created from the 
Print dialog so it will be simple to just send a fax when you go to print.  
You'll have the option of sending immediately, scheduling a send, or just 
saving a send batch and sending at a future time.

     The package will also include an NDA that will have maintenance for 
the phone books, send and receive batches, and cover sheets.  The NDA will 
allow you to create your own send batches outside of an application print 
job, will let you view/print/export received faxes, and do other sundry 
functions.

     I am also thinking of releasing a developer's package that will allow 
fourth-party applications related to PMPFax.  Because of the modular way 
I'm creating the system, other applicaitons and NDAs will be able to access 
just about all of the features of PMPFax, including the phone books, the 
send and receive batches, cover sheets, and the view/print module.  Some 
examples of possible fourth-party apps would be advanced phone book 
maintenance, manipulation of send/receive batches, specialized printing or 
cataloging of faxes, etc.  The actual send/receive modules will also be 
available for use in this fashion.

     Is this something any of you developers out there would be interested 
in? If so, let me know.

favorite GEnie Software Library!  Effective October 3, 1994, you'll be able 
to access GEnie Services at 9600 bps for as little as $5.00 per hour.  This 
is a limited beta test, and will be opened to all users on October 10, 
1994.

     As a result of an arrangement with Sprint, GEnie will be offering 
9600 bps access from almost 300 SprintNet locations.  Best of all, this 
high-speed access will not be subject to high-priced surcharges.  The 
normal $2.00 per hour SprintNet surcharge will apply...even at 9600 bps!  
This open beta test is expected to run through the end of the year.

     To find the number of the SprintNet access number nearest you, simply 
type PHONES at any GEnie menu prompt (or use the "Move To Keyword" option 
in GEnie for Windows and type PHONES).  Remember, this rate applies only to 
9600 bps access via SprintNet.  So be sure to choose the access number 
showing "9600" in the "Baud Rate" column AND "SprintNet" in the "Network" 
column.

     From the "Fine Print" department, please note that the $2.00 per hour 
surcharge for SprintNet access is applicable even during your initial four 
hours of monthly usage.

     So, whether you're into downloading software, reading bulletin 
boards, or accessing databases, it's about to become cheaper to do it 
faster!  Join the beta test today, and get a headstart on the savings!

SYMBOLIX SPECIAL OFFER FOR SHAREWARE SOLUTIONS II SUBSCRIBERS   (Basle, 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Switzerland 
/San Rafael, California. October 26, 1994) The European offices of Bright 
Software has recently taken over the worldwide distribution of Symbolix, 
the most sophisticated math program ever written for the Apple IIGS.

     Bright Software would like to take this opportunity to also inform 
you that an amazing new 2 disk interactive demo of Symbolix is now 
available exclusively from the US-based offices of Shareware Solutions II.

     Symbolix is a full-featured GS/OS desktop application for complex 
numeric and symbolic math.  Written in fast assembly language, Symbolix 
calculates object-oriented 2-D and 3-D graphs with hidden surfaces.  It 
offers commands for symbolic derivatives of any complex expression and 
frees you from expanding, collecting, simplifying and rewriting real or 
complex expressions.  Symbolix fully supports The Manager and the Floating 
Point Engine, although it requires neither.

     Symbolix differentiates any mathematical expression in the twinkling 
of an eye.  It also supports nested line integrals with any number of 
independent variables.  Symbolix's unique 3-D module is the most impressive 
graphing tool ever seen on a IIGS.  You can rotate graphs, choose from 
among different color sets, and export them in various formats.  There is a 
complete online help system, and a complete collection of mathematical 
formulas and summary of all chemical elements.  Plus, there are Easter Eggs 
galore!

     Symbolix requires 2 megabytes of RAM, two 3.5" disk drives or a hard 
disk, and System 6.  It is now available only from Bright Software's 
European offices for $70 plus $5 for shipping and handling.  Bright 
Software can accept payment by EuroCheck and by check or money order in US 
currency.

     Bright Software is also pleased to announce that a special discounted 
offer for Symbolix is now available exclusively to subscribers of Shareware 
Solutions II.  Details may be found in Shareware Solutions II, Issue #7.

     The 2 disk interactive Symbolix demo is reminiscent of FTA demos, 
with stunning and informative animations and a toe-tapping musical 
soundtrack.  That demo is now available from Shareware Solutions II for 
only $5.  The Symbolix demo requires a hard disk drive, but the actual 
Symbolix program does not.

     To order the Symbolix demo, send checks/money orders, made payable to 
Joe Kohn, in US Funds only, to the Shareware Solutions II Worldwide 
Headquarters.

<<<<<   Just a note about the Bright Software/Shareware Solutions II Press
"""""   Release...

     Henrik Gudat and I had a slight disagreement over the wording of the 
press release.  I wanted to use the joint press release as a way to help 
promote Bright Software, and he wanted to use it as a way to help promote 
Shareware Solutions II.

     Since readers of Shareware Solutions II already know about both the 
special "Such A Deal" offer and the availability of the new 2 disk Symbolix 
demo, it just didn't seem necessary to me to include all that info.  Henrik 
disagreed.

     But, since Henrik isn't on GEnie and won't see these remarks, I'd 
like to point out the significance of first paragraph.  Namely, Bright 
Software no longer has a US distributor for Symbolix!  The European office 
of Bright Software is now handling all correspondance, tech support and 
sales for Symbolix.

     Although Bright Software is located in Basle, Switzerland, they do 
have a bank account set up so that they can accept checks in US currency. 
They also can accept EuroChecks.

     Please note that the other commercially available software titles

TURBO REZ GRAPHICS CARD DEAD?   Fortunately, you are incorrect.  The Turbo

publicize due to its new competitor (Second Sight); in fact, the new

directly.  All I can say is that the TurboRez has significant features 
which the Second Sight lacks.

     Animasia 3-D supported the second version of the TurboRez (seen at 
Apple Expo East '92), but does not (yet) do so for the third version.  The 
reasons are more related to a lack of time than anything else.  As for a 
release date, an ad was just placed in GS+ for their upcoming issue.  The 
ad states that A3D will be available beginning December 10th.

KOHN WON'T BUY BIG RED COMPUTER CLUB   Although I haven't yet received my

that there's a rumor printed in it that says something along the lines of 
SSII taking over BRCC.

     Let me just suggest that if there's something you want to purchase 
from Big Red Computer Club, you better purchase it soon.  There is 
absolutely no truth to the rumor.

     On the other hand, Shareware Solutions II and Big Red Computer Club 
_are_ teaming up once again.  In the next several weeks, all Scarlett

Message 330       Fri Oct 21, 1994
D.ROGERS2 [DAVE]             at 22:45 EDT
 
     Not to change the subject or anything, but I was just up in Joe 
Kohn's SSII CAT when I read his reply concerning a Honolulu user group and 
how they had 1000 people attending meetings at first, and they're down to 
10 now.

     Brought back memories.  I remember how excited I was when I found out 
there was such a thing as a user group.  I bought my ][+ back in Dec '81 
and went for months relying on Nibble, Creative Computing and Byte. Then I 
found out about the Tidewater Apple Worms (hated the name even then).  What 
a discovery!  There were easily over 100 people at those meetings.  We used 
to meet twice a month.  Once was a "meeting" where we actually conducted 
"business" and the other was an informal, officially unsanctioned gathering 
which was much more energetic though I'm sad to say the principle activity 
was copying software.

     But the excitement came from the fact that the whole idea of personal 
computing was in its infancy.  None of us knew what these machines were 
really capable of and how we could access it.  Every meeting brought new 
wonders to behold.  Broderbund actually sent a rep to demonstrate a 
prerelease version of Lode Runner and showed how they took the programmers 
original program and refined it into a finished product.

     It was heady stuff for a guy who had been raised on Robert Heinlein, 
Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke.  It was really weird meeting so many 
people you didn't know and having an instant rapport with them.  I haven't 
experienced anything remotely like it since.

     My wife was asking me yesterday (pleading, really) why I didn't get 
rid of this thing and get an MS-DOS machine "something that's compatible." 
I can't explain to her that this machine has the greatest compatibility of 
all, it's compatible with me.

     Although I'm much older and wiser in the ways of bits and bytes, I 
can instantly recall the wonder I felt when I turned on my ][+ for the 
first time.  I suppose the people who owned the first televisions or first  
radios and perhaps the first folks to master fire, felt much the same way.  
It is a rich experience.  I wonder if people who have come into computing 
in the last few years have felt any of that.  The kids who have grown up 
since 1981 certainly take it for granted, much as I did color TV.

     In the last years of my stay in Virginia TAW continued to shrink and 
become somewhat mired in endless bickering about this and that.  It was 
very sad for me.  Now I'm in Jax and I don't belong to a user  group 
anymore.  I visit here and I help out at my son's school and that's about 
the extent of my Apple activities outside my den.  But I'm sticking with 
the old hunk of silicon.  I tell my wife it's my sandbox.  All these things 
really are, after all, are boxes of sand.  We make of them what we will.  
Somehow I don't think the guy walking out of CompUSA with the latest Compaq 
or Power PC in his hands has any inkling of that.

     Sorry for the long post.  But something struck a chord and I just had 
to let it reverberate for a while.  Back to our regular programming...

                  >>> THE TEN LAWS OF CARTOON PHYSICS <<<
                  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Cartoon Law I.
''''''''''''''
     Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of 
        its situation.

          Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland. He 
            loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he chances 
            to look down.  At this point, the familiar principle of 32 feet 
            per second per second takes over.

Cartoon Law II.
'''''''''''''''
     Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter 
        intervenes suddenly.

          Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon 
            characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a 
            telephone pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward 
            motion absolutely.  Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden 
            termination of motion the stooge's surcease.

Cartoon Law III.
''''''''''''''''
     Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation 
        conforming to its perimeter.

          Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the 
            speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of 
            reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit 
            directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout- 
            perfect hole.  The threat of skunks or matrimony often 
            catalyzes this reaction.

Cartoon Law IV.
'''''''''''''''
     The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater 
        than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the 
        ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it 
        unbroken.

          Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture 
            it inevitably unsuccessful.

Cartoon Law V.
''''''''''''''
     All principles of gravity are negated by fear.

          Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to 
            propel them directly away from the earth's surface.  A spooky 
            noise or an adversary's signature sound will induce motion 
            upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or 
            the crest of a flagpole.  The feet of a character who is 
            running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch the 
            ground, especially when in flight.

Cartoon Law VI.
'''''''''''''''
     As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.

          This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a 
            character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of 
            altercation at several places simultaneously.  This effect is 
            common as well among bodies that are spinning or being 
            throttled.  A 'wacky' character has the option of 
            self-replication only at manic high speeds and may ricochet off 
            walls to achieve the velocity required.

Cartoon Law VII.
''''''''''''''''
     Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble 
        tunnel entrances; others cannot.

          This trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generation, but at 
            least it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a wall's 
            surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue him into 
            this theoretical space.  The painter is flattened against the 
            wall when he attempts to follow into the painting. This is 
            ultimately a problem of art, not of science.

Cartoon Law VIII.
'''''''''''''''''
     Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.

          Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional nine 
            lives might comfortably afford.  They can be decimated, 
            spliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled, 
            but they cannot be destroyed.  After a few moments of blinking 
            self pity, they reinflate, elongate, snap back, or solidify.

     Corollary: A cat will assume the shape of its container.

Cartoon Law IX.
'''''''''''''''
     For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance.

          This is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also applies 
            to the physical world at large.  For that reason, we need the 
            relief of watching it happen to a duck instead.

Cartoon Law X.
''''''''''''''
     Everything falls faster than an anvil.

          Examples too numerous to mention from the Roadrunner cartoons.

Thinking About Online Communications

   >>> SOME THOUGHTS ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ELECTRONIC MAIL <<<
   """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Last week a friend of mine sent me an E-mail message explaining the 
progress being made in her treatment for depression.  She is taking 
medication, which seems to help, and visits regularly with a therapist, 
which she also finds beneficial.  At the end of her message she inquired 
whether a mutual friend of ours could be reached online.

     As it happens, this mutual friend does have an electronic mail 
address, but he hardly ever uses it.  I explained to my first friend that 
despite my best efforts to wheedle and cajole him, our mutual friend seems 
reluctant to make use of online communications.  At the end of my message, 
I added, "Well, this just reinforces the age-old Confucian adage:  'You can 
lead a horse to a modem, but you can't make him dial.'"

     Apparently my silly little remark brought a brief chuckle to my 
friend.   Which got me thinking about the psychological effects that E-mail 
can have on the human mind.

     All communications has the power to lift the human spirit.  But even 
more so when the human spirit is flagging.  When you hear a friend has 
suffered an unexpected misfortune, your first inclination is to reach for 
the phone to offer soothing words of commiseration and reassurance.

     Human beings are intensely social creatures.  To a large extent we 
derive our emotional strength from our interactions with one another.  
Self-esteem is largely a by-product of how others have treated us.

     Thinking back to my friend undergoing treatment, it would be 
presumptuous of me to think that a single E-mail message could have a 
salutary effect on her depression.  Clinical depression is a disease with a 
profound impact on the human mind.  But if an E-mail message I sent 
brightened her day for a moment, that in itself is a positive result.

     I came to learn recently that my friend stays in touch via E-mail 
with several other of her friends and colleagues.  Who knows what the 
collective influence of ten, twenty, or thirty E-mail messages per day 
might have in her life?

     Imagine if you yourself were stuck in a hospital bed for two weeks.  
Your closest friend stops by with a laptop computer and arranges for an 
extra phone line to be installed in your room.  Within minutes you could be 
online savoring the waiting E-mail messages in your mailbox.

     And if the doctor ordered quiet bed rest, you could still have your 
E-mail read aloud to you -- with each message being whispered quietly into 
your ear.  Then you could quietly whisper a reply like:  "Tell Jackson that 
as soon as I'm able to get out of this bed I'm going to walk over to his 
desk and whack him over the head with a foam rubber baseball bat."

     It's the emotional warmth of these types of messages that can bolster 
one's spirits.

     Forget the flowers and the phone calls.  E-mail neither wilts nor 
wakes up a person who is napping.  And if you choose the right words, you 
can transmit almost any emotion from your heart to someone else's heart.

     And who knows what healing powers your messages might have.

                                  PIXMIX
              Copyright 1989 Doug Happel, All Rights Reserved
                                 Freeware

     PIXMIX is a jigsaw puzzle game for the Apple IIgs.  It can read most 
kinds of IIgs graphic imaged from diskette, fracture them into 6-80 pieces, 
and let you reassemble them as a pleasurable exercise.  In my opinion, this 
is one of the true gems of the GS world.  Even though it was created about 
five years ago, under ProDOS 16, it works just fine using the latest GS 
System software.

     PIXMIX works with most image files of types $C0 and $C1.  It cannot 
handle image files of partial screens (these wouldn't be of much use as a 
puzzle, anyway).

     You may wish to select "Help..." from the Apple menu after you've 
launched PIXMIX.  This will allow you to select any menu item and see a 
description of its use.

     Start by selecting "New Image..." from the "Files" menu.  This will 
bring up a dialogue box allowing you to choose the graphic image file you 
want to work with.  After you have selected a file by "Open"ing it, another 
dialogue box will appear asking you into how many rows and columns you'd 
like the image to be fractured.  You must make a choice here (although you 
can always rescramble the image later at a different level of complexity).

     There are two windows available for your use.  The window called 
"Boxtop" is the unscrambled image--use it as a model.  The window called 
"Puzzle" is the scrambled image--this is where you reconstruct the image.  
You can switch from viewing one window to the other via the "Options" menu.

     To reassemble the image, click on a piece you'd like to move.  Its 
colors will invert to indicate that it has been selected.  Now click on 
another piece--the two pieces will exchange places.  This is known as 
"Single Swap" mode.

     Another mode called "Block Swap" will let you move a block of pieces 
at a time.  This mode can be selected via the "Options" menu.  To select 
the block you wish to move, depress the mouse button with the cursor in one 
of your block's corners.  Drag the cursor to the diagonally opposite 
corner, and release the button.  The selected rectangle will invert its 
colors.  Now click the mouse button with the cursor in the upper-left 
corner of the destination block (of the same size).  If the blocks do not 
overlap, they will swap positions.  If the blocks overlap, and the 
destination is in the same row or column as the selected block, the latter 
will "slide" into its new location.  Illegal moves will exhibit a beep or 
an alert box.

     Hint:  In "Block Swap" mode, after you've selected a block, you can 
press the mouse button with the cursor within your selection and drag it to 
its new location.

     Nestled within the "Puzzle" menu is a selection called "Choose 
Timer..."  When you select this item, you will see a dialogue box which 
allows you to choose one of four timer options.

     PIXMIX is Freeware.  Please refer to the "About PIXMIX" item of the 
Apple menu for restrictions regarding its distribution.

     Benjamin Winnick has created a neat strategy game for the GS.  The 
rules are fairly simple; the objective is to form simple pattern by pushing 
gray blocks into the proper sequence.  As Ben says in his introduction, 
"There are no worlds on the verge of destruction or princesses in need of 
rescuing.  Just play the game and have fun."  The best way to describe this 
game to you is to quote Ben's instructions.

     "MOVING .. You are represented by a blue arrow.  If you are using the 
keyboard you can turn to face different directions by pressing the J and L 
keys.  To move forward you can press I, K, or the space bar, whichever you 
prefer.  If you are using the mouse, moving it left or right will rotate 
the arrow.  Pressing the mouse button moves forward.

     "The blocks for you to use come from a position in the upper-left 
corner of the playing area.  A few moments after pushing a block off this 
location, a new one will grow in to replace it.  You can push only one 
block at a time.  If there are two in front of you when you try to move, 
nothing will happen.

     "BAD GUYS .. Your opponents are red C-shaped monsters.  These 
monsters wander randomly around the playing area.  If one of them comes in 
contact with a block, it will eat the block.  When this happens, the 
monster will disappear, and two more will appear to take its place.  If too 
many blocks get eaten, the game ends.

     "DEFENSE .. To assist you, there are indestructible gold blocks in 
the lower-left corner.  These blocks can be moved the same way the gray 
blocks are moved, but cannot be eaten by the monsters.  In addition they 
take slightly longer to regrow.  You can use them to try to keep the 
monsters from reaching your gray blocks.

     "PLAYING .. The pattern you must form is displayed in the upper-right 
corner of the screen.  It starts out as a 3x3 grid, but it will get larger 
as you get to higher levels.  The number of monsters will also increase as 
you progress.  To complete a level you must correctly reproduce the pattern 
on the playing field.

     "The first few levels may seem easy, but don't let that fool you.  
Once the pattern size starts increasing, you'll have to do your best to 
survive.

     "SCORING .. The 'Level Score' shown on the right side of the screen 
is the number of points you will receive for completing the current level.  
When a monster eats a gray block, this number will decrease by one.  If it 
reaches zero, the game ends.

     "The 'Total Score' is the total number of points you have 
accumulated.  The top ten high scores are listed on the left side of the 
screen."

     A couple of things you should know:  Open-Apple-Q quits the game.  
Also, I think you will find that it is easier to use one hand on the 
keyboard, rotating the arrow with the J or L key, and the other hand on 
your mouse button, clicking to move the arrow forward.

     I didn't care for the fact that you could not save your level and 
return to it the next time.  Apparently, you begin as a rank amateur each 
time you run the game.  Other than that, it seems like a neat game.

     HANOI.GS.BXY  File #13587    16380 bytes    TOWER OF HANOI PUZZLE
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                             by David Hallwas
                                 Freeware

     David Hallwas created this Apple IIgs version of the classic Towers 
of Hanoi game.  For those of you who have never played this game, the 
object is to move seven rings from one peg to another.  The rings are in 
descending size with the smallest on top.  There are three pegs available 
and the trick is to move the top ring from a peg to another peg so that you 
can get to the next larger ring and move it.  You may not place a larger 
ring on top of a smaller ring.  It sounds simple, but it is not as easy as 
you might think.

     This version uses the SHR screen and allows the use of the mouse to 
move rings.  Other than that, there is really little difference between 
this version and earlier versions that I have seen for 8 bit Apples.

     Still it is a neat game, and since it is a fairly smaller download, I 
recommend that you get it and try it out.  Even the price is right!

     POWERPLAY.BXY     File #11573     51660 bytes    APPLE IIGS GAMES
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                             by Peter Brinkley
                               Public Domain

     This collection of four games for the Apple IIgs has been around for 
a while and a lot of people have already downloaded it.  If you are not one 
of them, you should take a look at it.

     The first game, called Four Play, is a "columns" type game where you 
manipulate falling squares to match all adjacent colors of their neighbors 
when they land.  This version allows you to control the speed at which the 
squares drop, so you can pick your own challenge level.

     The second game, called Tron, is a two player game where each player 
controls a 'light cycle' with the keyboard and attempts to box in the other 
player.  If a 'light cycle' can't move the game is over.

     PignBull, the third game, is a guessing game.  You have 16 chances to 
discover a four-digit number.  In each turn, you select four 1-digit 
numbers, none alike.  Then the game displays pig icons for each correct 
digit that is not in the correct location, or bull icons for each correct 
digit in the correct location.  The pig and bull icons are not displayed in 
the same order as the numbers.  For example if you select the numbers 1, 2, 
3, 4 and you are shown one pig icon and 1 bull icon, that means that one of 
your numbers is correct, but in the wrong location, and another one is both 
correct and in the correct location.

     The final game is called Gridlock.  Initially you will see four 
4-color icons in the game window.  The object of the game is to turn and 
rearrange them so that all of the adjacent sides match.  Once you succeed, 
the level of the games increases and more icons appear.

     So, you've just bought an Apple IIe or IIc from someone, and you'd 
like to try out a few games to see what it can do.  Let me recommend that 
you download these two collections of public domain games.

     In the first collection you will find games from Joe Kohn's 
selections of the "Best of Big Red".  This set is  "mind games"-puzzles and 
other mental exercises.  It includes:  ANAGRAM -- unscramble mixed-up 
words; CODEBREAKER -- Lo-res color logic game; FRUSTRATION -- Lo-res color 
logic game; GALLOWS -- slick version of Hangman; LOGIC -- an educational 
tutorial game of logic; MARQUEE -- a text logic game; and TAKE.OFF -- play 
against computer removing numbers from a list.

     The second collection of 6 "mind" games include two different flavors 
of "Mastermind", the old "Peg Jump" game done VERY nicely in hi-res, a 
utility to assist you in breaking cryptoquizzes, "Goal", and "Black Box".  
"Black Box" is a very nifty game in which you must deduce the positions of 
"atoms" based on the behavior of particle paths.

     Tom Zuchowski has kindly collected these games and uploaded them for 
your gaming pleasure.

     Last month we featured several of Bill Tudor's Apple IIgs utilities 
in this column.  On Friday, October 21, Bill was the guest speaker at a 
special Real-Time Conference where he discussed his programs.  This is an 
edited transcript of that conference

     If you missed the conference, you should download this transcript.  
Among other things discussed, Bill revealed the secret behind his program 
Minimizer which allows you to display a minimized icon for any zoomable 
window on the Finder screen.

     XManager is an Apple IIgs Finder Extension init file that allows you 
to manage all your other Finder Extensions.  You can check on the current 
memory usage of installed extensions, and you can install and remove them 
"on the fly" while the Finder is running.  The following information is 
taken from the documentation file included with the program.

     To install XManager, copy the file XManager to your System.Setup 
folder on the boot disk and reboot, or copy the file XManager to a folder 
named FinderExtras located in the System folder on the boot disk, then 
re-run the Finder.  XManager REQUIRES the program IR to install extensions.  
It requires System 6.0.1 or greater.

     After XManager is installed, run the Finder and choose the XManager 
menu item from under the Extras menu.  You will be presented with the 
XManager dialogue window.  This window contains two lists.  The list on the 
left shows all of your installed Finder Extensions, their current memory 
requirements, and the total memory used by all of them.  The list on the 
right displays all of your inactive (not loaded) Finder Extensions.

   Note:   | An "inactive" Finder Extension is a Finder Extension in
           | your FinderExtras folder that has been marked as inactive,
           | i.e., the inactive check box in the Finder's "Icon Info"
           | dialogue has been checked.  An inactive Finder Extension
           | remains on disk when the Finder is running and is not
           | loaded into memory.

     To install an inactive Finder Extension, select the file and click 
the "<<Install" button.  The file will move over to the "Installed" list.  
To remove an installed Finder Extension, select the file and click the 
"Remove>>" button.  The file will move over to the inactive list and be 
removed from memory.  This extension will not be loaded the next time you 
run the Finder as it will be marked "inactive".  To activate it again, 
either use XManager to activate it on the fly or un-check the inactive box 
in the Finder's "Icon Info" dialogue for the file.  Then it will become 
active the next time you use the Finder.

     When you are finished, click the "Done" button.

     Please note that after XManager installs a Finder Extension, you will 
not be able to remove that extension until you exit the XManager dialogue 
(click done).  This is because the extension must be given a chance to 
initialize itself before it can be removed again.  Finder Extensions 
installed by XManager are not "fully" installed until you click the "Done" 
button.

     If you make a mistake and install a Finder Extension that you want to 
remain inactive, just click the done button, then select "XManager..." from 
the "Extras" menu again and you will be able to remove it.

Important: | There are some Finder Extensions that cannot be removed
           | from memory.  These will appear in italics in the installed
           | list and you will not be able to select them.  An example
           | is XManager itself.  You cannot use XManager to remove
           | XManager as an extension cannot remove itself.

     Bill indicated in the RTC that there is a bug with this program that 
should be fixed in the next version.  Read the transcript mentioned above 
for details.

     TWO.DIAMOND.BXY   File #23507    5760 bytes   LORES GRAPHICS GAME
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     James Davis has created this graphics puzzle game.  The object of the 
puzzle is to exchange the colors in the two diamonds.  You can move into 
the empty square from an adjacent square or jump over a square of any color 
to the empty square.

     A selection is made with the game paddles, a joystick, the I, J, K, 
and M, or arrow keys.  Put the cursor on the square you want to move to the 
empty one and press a game paddle or joystick button, either apple key, or 
return.

     This program has the potential of being a neat game.  Unfortunately 
there are some problems.  The biggest problem lies in the fact that the 
program cannot be played on a monochrome monitor.  Mr. Davis made the 
mistake of using two low resolution colors that look exactly the same on 
the monochrome monitor, so it is impossible to know which color is which.

     Mr. Davis has been contacted about this problem by a staff member and 
his response was that the staff member could fix the problem if he wished.  
The indication seems to be that Mr. Davis does not plan to fix the program 
so that it will display properly on a monochrome monitor.

     Since this is a shareware program (he wants $10 for it) I cannot 
recommend that you download it.  It is being included in this month's 
column because I felt those who use monochrome monitors should be aware of 
its shortcomings.  Perhaps Mr. Davis will change his mind about fixing it.  
Until then, this is a program to avoid.


                                 [*][*][*]

     That's it for this month.  I hope you have found something here to 
whet your interest.  Drop me a line and let me know what you think of this 
column and offer any suggestions you might have about what should be in it.

     Until next time, happy downloading!

AppleDesign Powered Speakers II
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Udo Huth
   [U.HUTH]



     My latest purchase are these speakers, which are now located beside 
my Apple IIgs.  While I'm writing this, I'm listening to a CD with old-time 
rock'n'roll music--awesome.

     The speakers were about $110 here in Germany, but in my opinion they 
are worth every cent of that price.  Like everything else from Apple they 
are of outstanding quality.  For your money you get two speakers in 
platinum color (fits the IIgs extraordinarily well, as well in color as 
design), power supply, speaker-to-speaker cable, computer connection cable, 
CD stereo cable, and a manual with explanations in five languages.

     The power supply isn't a simple wall wart, it comes with about 6' of 
cord for connecting to 110V and with about 6' of cord for connection to the 
speakers.  The speaker for the left channel (main speaker) contains all the 
sockets for making the connections:  power, CD in, computer in, speaker 
out, headphones out.  A knob for adjusting the volume is also present.  The 
speaker for the right channel (satellite speaker) is fed power and sound by 
the speaker-to-speaker cable connected to it.

     The cable for connecting the IIgs to the speakers has 3.5-millimeter 
stereo plugs on both ends, the cable for connecting the CD-ROM has two 
cinch plugs on one end and an 3.5mm stereo plug on the other end.  (This 
may be different in the US.)  The cable for connecting the CD-ROM is 
designed to connect a CD-ROM by Apple in its external case, as this, too, 
has two cinch sockets for the sound output.

     If you've put your CD in another case, you have to connect the CD via 
the headphone socket to the speakers. For that you have to buy your own 
cable.

     The size of the speakers is about 4.1 by 6.7 by 4.7 inches (width x 
height x depth).  A good deal of the depth may be attributed to the rear 
stand, which adjusts the tilt of the speakers, too.  You shouldn't remove 
the rear stand, as this affects the quality of the sound adversely 
according to Apple.

     The quality of the sound is very good.  After adjusting the volume 
from the CD-ROM drive and selecting an appropriate volume for the IIgs via 
the Control Panel, I was all set.  Now both signals are almost identical in 
volume, although I chose the IIgs to be a bit fainter.  This way the 
messages of the IIgs are well to hear, but don't dominate the music.

     You select the basic level of the volume at the CD-ROM drive and the 
IIgs.  How loud you want to hear sound/music is ultimately selected with 
the volume control at the main speaker.  If you don't want to disturb 
anybody, you can attach a headphone system to the headphone jack of the 
main speaker.

     The Apple speakers provide a healthy bass.  I notice this now more 
now, as my previous speakers I connected by a self-made cord to IIgs and 
CD-ROM drive (with capacitors in it) lacked in the bass range.  The sounds 
of the IIgs contain lots of bass, I didn't know the standard "bonk" could 
be so deep.

     The manual describes connecting the speaker to a Macintosh and to a 
MS-DOS PC.  The IIgs isn't mentioned, but we're used to this from Apple by 
now, aren't we?

          Udo     - ... just a IIGS freak -

                            >>> WHO'S WHO? <<<
                            """"""""""""""""""
                     ~ GEnieLamp Profile:  Tony Ward ~

     This month we will profile the man who knows where all the files are 
hidden!  Tony Ward [A2.TONY] is the Chief Librarian for the Apple II 
RoundTable Library.  His job is to make sure that the files that are 
uploaded to the library are okay for the rest of us.


GEnieLamp>  How did you first get interested in the Apple II computer?
"""""""""

Tony>  In high school, I guess it was 1982 or so, we had a computer lab
""""   filled with various Apple II computers.  I don't know what made me 
decide to take the "Intro to computers" class, but I did.  Can you believe 
they actually taught Cobol on the Apple II?  By the time I graduated in 
1984, I was completely hooked.  My mom helped pay for my first Apple, a 
IIe.  It was stolen from my apartment at college a few years later and I 
used the insurance money to buy a IIgs.  I guess that was a blessing in 
disguise because I still have that same IIgs and I use it every day.


GEnieLamp>  Do you have any anecdotes you can share with us about your
"""""""""   first experiences with the Apple II?

Tony>  Hmmm....  Well, I can tell you that I often stayed late after school
""""   playing games in the computer lab.  As an "advanced" student I was 
allowed to play during class, but after school was when all the "computer 
geeks" got together to share solving techniques for classics like Wizardy, 
Ultima and Akalabeth.


GEnieLamp>  Describe your job here on GEnie.  You must be one of the
"""""""""   busiest people in the A2 RoundTable.

Tony>  Yeah, I guess I do spend quite a bit of time online.  Does that
""""   qualify for understatement of the year?  My "job" (I hesitate to 
call it that because I really enjoy doing it) is to download and check out 
all the files that get uploaded to the A2 Library.  I've often been asked, 
"Do you have to download every single file?"  The answer is yes, I really 
do download everything.  My hard drive is a mess, but I don't mind.


GEnieLamp>  Exactly how do you decide which files get put in the library
"""""""""   and which don't?

Tony>  We really don't do much "screening" here in A2, we'll release just
""""   about anything.  However, that hasn't stopped me from being tagged a 
"tyrant" by people who get rejection letters from me.  GEnie has a pretty 
strict policy concerning copyright infringements.  We have to watch out for 
files that might violate someone else's interests.  This policy hits 
especially hard when it comes to graphics and music.  For example, we can't 
accept a digitized picture of Mickey Mouse or a Van Halen song, things like 
that.


GEnieLamp>  What is the process that you go through to decide if a file is
"""""""""   acceptable for the library?  You've already mentioned copyright 
problems, what about viruses?  How do you check for them?

Tony>  You want all the gory details?  Okay. :)
""""
     I download the file without using Binary II so I can then use BLU 
(Binary Library Utility) to make sure the file has a Binary II wrapper with 
a proper filename (i.e. MYFILE.BXY should have a file named MYFILE.SHK 
inside.)  If it's a program, I run it through a virus checker (Salvation 
Exorciser) to make sure it doesn't have any viruses and it doesn't make any 
nasty system tool calls (erase, format, etc.)  If it passes these tests, I 
run the program to make sure it works.  I usually don't spend too much time 
with the program, I just want to make sure it actually runs.  To date, I 
have found only one file that contained a virus.  This file was never 
released to the public.

     If it's a picture, I look at it to make sure it's not a copyrighted 
picture.  I also look for nudity which would cause the file to be placed in 
our adult library.  If it's an unpacked text file, I make sure it was 
uploaded without Binary II so anyone can download it or view it online.


GEnieLamp>  Tony, would you explain to our readers who lack experience in
"""""""""   uploading how it is all done?

Tony>  Uploading a file is really quite simple.  You pack the file(s) with
""""   ShrinkIt first and call the archive something like MYFILE.SHK.  
MYFILE can be anything you want, but you need the .SHK suffix.  When you 
are ready to upload the file, make sure you turn on your telecom program's 
Binary II option.  This adds a "wrapper" to the file that preserves the 
important filetype info so when someone downloads it they get the correct 
type of file.  Tell GEnie that the filename is MYFILE.BXY (.BXY is the 
Binary II suffix.)

     If your telecom program doesn't have a Binary II option, you can tell 
ShrinkIt to add it for you when you create the archive.  When you type in
the name of the archive, MYFILE.SHK, just hit OA-Return instead of Return.

     It really doesn't matter which method you use, but pick one and stick 
with it.  And whatever you do, don't use both methods on the same file or 
you'll end up with a "double wrapped" file and you'll have to do it over 
again.  If you want more detailed information, check out this file in the 
A2 Library:

                           20171 UPLOAD.TIPS.BXY

     It's an excellent tutorial written by Tom Zuchowski on how to perform 
the perfect upload.


GEnieLamp>  How does the keyword search work?

Tony>  Searching the library is really quite simple, but I know many people
""""   are confused or intimidated by it.  I try to add enough keywords to 
each file so anyone can find it later on.  Let's say you're looking for an 
AppleWorks template to help with your taxes.  First, set the proper library 
(in this case, it's #46 -- AppleWorks Templates.)  Start the search 
(library menu item #3) and when you are asked for a keyword, try "tax" or 
"taxes" and you will get a list of all tax templates.  That's really all 
there is to it.

     If you are looking for a game called "pyramid" you don't want to 
search for keyword "games" because you'll get a few hundred files.  
Instead, search on "pyramid" and you'll narrow the search.  You can search 
without first setting a particular library, but be prepared for a long list 
of files.  If you would like more detailed information about keywords, 
check out this file:

                           23050 KEYWORDINFO.TXT

It contains a good explanation of how the GEnie library keywords work.


GEnieLamp>  In the year and a half that you have been the Chief Librarian,
"""""""""   what files have come across your screen that you think are 
truly outstanding?

Tony>  There have been many outstanding files uploaded to A2 since I've
""""   been here.  I hesitate to make a list because I don't want to leave 
anything out, but here are a few off the top of my head:

     CoPilot and GEM -- Incredibly useful programs for managing your 
online time.

     Cogito and Tinies -- Two very nice freeware games for the IIgs from 
the folks at Brutal Deluxe.

     The A2 Disk of the Month -- The best A2 has to offer, on a single 
disk, every month.  A great way for the occasional A2 browser to pick up 
the latest and greatest software with a single download.

     I make up a Dean's List every other week or so that contains the 
current "hot" files.  The list is displayed on the A2 banner so everyone 
can see what's new in the library.  Dean Esmay started the list when he was 
the Librarian and I've kept it going because I like it.


GEnieLamp>  Where do you see the future of telecommunications moving in the
"""""""""   next five to ten years?

Tony>  Internet.  Actually, something resembling the Internet but a whole
""""   lot bigger and better organized.  Everything will be interconnected.  
You'll be able to do just about everything with your TV's remote control:  
shop an online mall, buy groceries, send and receive mail, play games and 
of course watch television and movies.  Your telephone will also be 
connected to (or replaced by) your television.


GEnieLamp>  Tell us a bit about your family.
"""""""""

Tony>  I was born and raised in the northern suburbs of Chicago.  My
""""   parents got divorced when I was very young.  My mom is remarried and 
still lives in the Chicago area.  My dad lives in Texas and has been 
married (and divorced) twice.  My brother lives in Colorado with his 
girlfriend.  All four of my grandparents are still around, and I've got 
cousins scattered all over the country.


GEnieLamp>  What do you consider your proudest accomplishment?
"""""""""

Tony>  Getting my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  It took me 6
""""   years, but I did it and I'm very glad I did.


GEnieLamp>  Who do you look up to as your mentors?
"""""""""

Tony>  My dad and my grandfather.  How's that for a standard answer?  I
""""   really do look up to both of them and I'm trying to follow in their 
footsteps by choosing a career I enjoy and sticking with it.


GEnieLamp>  I'm curious about what your dad and grandfather do.  It sounds
"""""""""   like they found their niche.

Tony>  My dad is Plant Manager for a company in Texas that makes metal
""""   frames for computers and televisions.  They make other metal parts, 
but the frames are the big business.  Lots of PCs have frames that were 
made at my dad's plant.  I don't think I'm supposed to reveal the brand 
names, but they are biggies.

     My grandfather tried retirement a few years ago but he wound up 
driving my grandmother nuts because he can't stand not being active.  He 
went back to work as a consultant to help companies in trouble.  He 
basically goes in and completely takes over the day to day operations of 
the company until it's back on its feet.


GEnieLamp>  What sorts of things do you like to do for fun (i.e.
"""""""""   non-computer hobbies)?

Tony>  Football.  I spend every Saturday watching the college games and
""""   every Sunday watching the Pros.  I'm also a book freak.  I've got a 
pretty extensive collection of Stephen King novels and I'll read just about 
any science fiction, horror or spy story that catches my eye.


GEnieLamp>  Are computers a part of your daytime job?  Please tell us a
"""""""""   little about what you do between 9 and 5.

Tony>  Computers are my life.  I work on one all day and I come home to one
""""   every night.  I'm a programmer/analyst for a large insurance company 
here in the Chicago area.


GEnieLamp>  What exactly do you do?
"""""""""

Tony>  I do Cobol and Assembler programming on an IBM-370 mainframe.  Most
""""   of the time is spent on database retrieval and sorting programs to 
keep the phone operators happy.  They're always asking, "can you add this 
function?" and "I don't like the way the screen looks, how about doing it 
like this?"  We try to keep everybody happy.  Then management comes along 
and asks us to change it to make it work the way they want it to work.  
It's a vicious circle, but I really enjoy doing it.


GEnieLamp>  How long have you been a member of GEnie?
"""""""""

Tony>  I've had accounts on GEnie for about 5 years or so.  When I first
""""   signed up, I thought it was too confusing so I gave it up and tried 
America Online.  After about a year on AOL, I decided to try GEnie again 
and I've been here ever since.  GEnie was my first experience with a 
commercial online service and like many newcomers, I guess I was a bit 
overwhelmed.  I'm glad I decided to stick with it.  I've been an A2 Sysop 
since April 1993.


GEnieLamp>  What new services do you think GEnie should provide its
"""""""""   subscribers?

Tony>  The things most people want:  High speed access at a reasonable
""""   cost, full Internet access and a more robust transfer protocol than 
Xmodem CRC for uploading files.


GEnieLamp>  What one piece of advice would you pass along to a new Apple II
"""""""""   telecommunications enthusiast?

Tony>  If you aren't already on GEnie, do it now.  A2 and A2Pro are the
""""   absolute best sources of information and software for the Apple II.


GEnieLamp>  What do you see as the future for the Apple II and its owners?
"""""""""

Tony>  The Apple II has lived an amazingly long life.  The basic
""""   architecture of the computer is almost two decades old, yet 
thousands of people are still using the darned things.  I love mine and I 
wouldn't give it up for anything.  There are still quite a few companies 
supporting the Apple II (Byteworks, Seven Hills, Quality Computers, 
Vitesse, InTrec, Procyon, etc.) because there are still lots of people 
buying the products.

     Sure there are better computers on the market, and have been for 
quite some time, but the Apple II is still a great machine that performs 
most of the tasks people want in a home computer.


GEnieLamp>  Can you offer some advice about software and hardware that a
"""""""""   new Apple II user might want to invest in?  What do you have 
and use?

Tony>  It's hard to make a recommendation without knowing the user's needs.
""""   Many people get along just fine with a 128K Apple IIe.  Others like 
to cram as much hardware as possible into their IIgs.  I guess I'm 
somewhere in between.  I have a IIgs with a 4MB GS-RAM+ memory card, a 
125MB hard drive connected to an Apple High Speed SCSI card, an 8MHz ZipGS, 
an MDIdeas stereo/digitizer card connected to a pair of Labtec amplified 
speakers, an Imagewriter II and an Intel 14,400 baud external modem.  I 
have a System Saver to keep it all cool and an APC UPS back-up power supply 
to keep me sane (the power goes out from time to time around here).

The main thing is to buy only what you need and upgrade your system as your 
needs increase.  If you only want to run AppleWorks and a telecom program, 
go with an Apple IIe and a 1MB RAM card.  Add an accelerator if you feel 
the need for speed and unless you enjoy disk swapping, I strongly suggest a 
hard drive.  I know I couldn't live without mine.


GEnieLamp>  When you're not acting as Chief Librarian on GEnie, what else
"""""""""   do you do while you're here?  What do you enjoy most about 
being here?

Tony>  I spend quite a bit of time in the A2 RTC.  I enjoy helping the new
""""   folks and just shooting the breeze with the old timers.  I also play 
a few of the GEnie multi-player games.  I'm a regular player in Federation 
II (a space trading game, the object is to become Emperor and rule the 
galaxy) and Dragon's Gate (a role-playing Dungeons & Dragons type of game).


GEnieLamp>  Thank you, Tony, for an enjoyable interview.
"""""""""

Tony>  I've enjoyed it!  I think we have the best online Apple II library
""""   available, and I want to take this opportunity to encourage folks to 
continue to upload files to our library and to keep downloading them too.

/////////////////////////////////
Playing Tetris Can Help Soothe Asthma Attacks
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Phil Shapiro
   [P.SHAPIRO1]



     The Washington Post newspaper recently reported that playing Tetris 
can have a soothing effect on persons undergoing asthma attacks.  In a 
first-person, anecdotal article by Larry Fox, in the Fast Forward magazine 
section, the therapeutic uses of Tetris are vividly described.

     During one recent asthma attack the author casually started a game of 
Tetris on his Nintendo system.  After playing the game for about 30 minutes 
he found his breathing troubles to be noticeably diminished.

     Curious to see whether there might be some cause-effect relationship, 
Fox tried playing Tetris again during his next asthma attack.  In his own 
words:

     "Coincidence, I first thought.  But I put that conclusion to test a 
few weeks later, when another seizure left me gasping.  Again I turned to 
Tetris.  Once again the rhythm and colors worked their magic:  I could 
breathe!"

     Fox attributes the therapeutic effect of Tetris on the way the game 
mesmerizes players who are playing it.  Since the game so successfully 
engages the cognitive processes of the mind, the brain gets "distracted" 
from the asthma seizure that was otherwise occupying its attention.

     To find out more about how and why Tetris might help asthma 
sufferers, Fox talked with Dr. Joel Taubin, the Washington DC pulmonary 
specialist who treats him.  Taubin declared, "Sure, it can work.  Anything 
that can get your mind off breathing difficulties can help give you relief.  
I have recommended biofeedback to patients, told them to relax by going to 
a movie or resting in a dark room.  Anything that can change your focus 
away from breathing difficulties will help."

     If Tetris is so helpful, might other video arcade games have similar 
therapeutic value?  Fox feels that Tetris is unique in this respect.  Other 
games he has tried have had the opposite effect, "raising my blood pressure 
and wracking my nerves."

     The Larry Fox article is bound to create a re-surging interest in 
Tetris.  Apple II enthusiasts might be interested to know that there are 
more than a few public domain and shareware versions of Tetris in the GEnie 
Apple II Roundtable library.

     A brief search of the library turned up the following Tetris games 
available for downloading.  Following the list of Tetris games are 
descriptions of some Tetris variations, such as Columns and VIAD 
(Vocabulary in Any Direction).

     Given that Columns is an easier game than Tetris, with the same 
general game play, it might work even better as a therapeutic resource for 
asthma sufferers.  In my mind, Columns engages the mind in a most 
interesting way, while giving players a "fighting chance."  Luck operates 
more in players favor in Columns, making the game more fun than Tetris, in 
this player's mind.

     This Washington Post article about the therapeutic effects of Tetris 
has got me thinking about the general therapeutic effects that computers 
can have on the mind.  Could not computer use be therapeutic to someone who 
suffered a stroke, someone getting treatment for depression, someone whose 
memory isn't what it used to be?

     I would be interested in compiling a list of anecdotes about the 
therapeutic use of computers to share in a future issue of GEnieLamp.  
Kindly send any anecdotal stories to my address on GEnie: 
p.shapiro1@genie.geis.com.  (The more details, the better.)

     Incidentally, anyone interested in looking up the Washington Post 
article about Tetris and asthma might find a copy on microfiche at their 
local library.  The citation is:  Washington Post, 10/27/94, Fast Forward 
magazine section, page 36.  Article title: "Press Command-B to Breathe." 
Considering its interesting subject matter, the article is rather short: 
about seven paragraphs.

Description: This is the best tetris clone I have ever seen. It should work 
on any 128K Apple II.  You might even mistake it for the real thing.  I'm 
not kidding. Plays just like the real thing, has different music though.  
And new shapes. And rounds.  Joystick recommended.  Open-Apple-1 will give 
you the preview mode.  Apple buttons will show other screens. Escape 
pauses.  Archived with Shrinkit 3.0.2 in "disk" mode. You must unpack it to 
a TOTALLY BLANK 5.25 inch disk, then boot the disk (it doesn't work under 
ProDOS so you must boot it).  Note that this game does not work on some 
systems, apparently it doesn't like the Laser 128 for example.  Enjoy this 
great game.

November 1994 Report
""""""""""""""""""""
by GEna Saikin
     [A2.GENA]



     The Planetary Apple User's Group has now been active for over a year. 
 Our goals, when we started the group in the summer of 1993, was to create 
a stronger bond within the Apple II community, and to have a place for 
folks to go who don't have access to a local user group.

     We feel that we're well on the way to reachig these two goals.  In 
the future, our plans include developing a liasion between user groups in 
the "real world" and PAUG.  Last month we invited folks from "real world" 
user groups to come in and tell us a little about their groups, and it was 
a success!  We want to do more of this, since it's valuable to have user 
groups keep us informed on what they are doing, and bring new and fresh 
ideas to PAUG.  

     We had one report from Florida by Ev Carroll, on a group that has 
several different chapters scattered around the state.  We had two reports 
from Minnesota.   One user from Minneapolis made everyone very envious when 
he said that they have about 500 memebers.  Other members from around the 
country, and even one that recently moved from Guam, shared meeting ideas, 
library set ups, and BBS information.

     If you are a member of a users' group, or would like information 
about one, be sure to post questions and information the the A2 Bulletin 
Board Category 31.

WHAT'S NEW IN THE APPLE WORLD?   Many programs are in the "cooker" as they
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   say.  Paul Parkhurst of ANSITerm fame is 
working feverishly on his Fax software, as are others (Rich Wifall also has 
put his hands in the Fax pie.)

     ContactsGS is finally finished, and can be ordered from Shareware 
Solutions II.  Just email JOE.KOHN for details.  Note that subscribers to 
SSII have a special pricing structure!

MAIN EVENT   This month, we centered on the online navigators available to
""""""""""   Apple II users here on GEnie -- GEM and CoPilot.  With these 
tools, time online is dramatically diminished, allowing you to explore more 
areas of GEnie and not have to worry so much about the clock ticking.

     Both navigators will do pretty much the same thing -- that is, 
they'll gather your mail and messages, upload and download library files, 
and even fetch your bill (if you're courageous) automatically.  The time 
saving factor lies in the fact that you can reply to email and messages, 
request uploading and downloading of files and other functions all offline 
(without the clock ticking).

     Below is a short description of both programs.

GEM (GEnieMaster)   GEM will work on most Apple II systems, and requires at
'''''''''''''''''   bare minimum of 1 3.5" drive and 1 5.25" drive; or 2 
3.5" drives.  It does it's best work on a Hard Drive.  You'll need 
AppleWorks 3.0 or greater, and either ProTERM 3.0 or greater, Talk is 
Cheap, Point to Point or Spectrum (see documents for version numbers).  

     Setting up GEM is quite easy, and it has a delayed logon feature, 
which allows ou to set it for, say 4 a.m. (while you're sleeping).

CoPilot   CoPilot is GS specific, and needs only a communication program
'''''''   (ProTERM 3.0 or greater, Talk Is Cheap or Spectrum) to work.  
It's a desktop program, and is also quite powerful.
 
THE LIBRARY STACKS   Below is a list of this week's "Hot Files".  As you
""""""""""""""""""   can see, we had a great Halloween with the graphics 
that Pat Kern has so graciously put together for us!   There are also a 
couple great little games on this list as well.

WHAT'S NEW IN A2   The Apple II RoundTable is coming into the "final
""""""""""""""""   countdown" on gathering AOL refugees into the fold.  The 
last day that Apple II users can access AOL with their IIs was November 1.  
Let's give them a hearty and rousing welcome as they come stumbling and 
bewildered into our midst.  We could always paraphrase the statement on our 
Statue of Liberty -- "Give me your tired, your hungry and your poor, 
yearning to find a home" <grin>

     We have added several new staffmembers -- including Bill Moore, 
Charlie Hartley, and Chuck Stites as Real Time Conference hosts, and added 
more staff to other areas of the Apple II RT.

     We continue to have Real Time Conferences every night of the week, as 
well as most of the day Sunday, and now have them on Saturday afternoons as 
well.  However, popping into the RTC at almost ANY time is guaranteed to 
bring a bunch of folks out of the woodwork!

     Our next PAUG meeting will be on November 23rd, at 4 p.m. eastern 
time!
