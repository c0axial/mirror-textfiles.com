And with direct support by all themajor OS's (and even some that have small market shares), it is alreadyproven to be a winner.  And the real bonus is that IIgs emulators willeasily exceed 100MHz (if anybody has numbers running on the top of the lineprocessors, I would be interested to see them).  It is so nice to get thenext generation of computational power without losing the risk of backwardscompatibility.  It reminds me a lot of the situation when the IIgs wasreleased as a step above its 8-bit cousins.The price tag is already starting to drop which is making it a moreattractive option.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 2, Top 10, Msg 19)>>>>>"""""The AMD-64 processor looks to be a pretty nice processor.  You can get amotherboard for about $99, a processor starting near $125 (up to like $700if you dare).  So technically you could put together a system fairlycheaply.  I have an AMD Athlon system here that ran like a champ for a yearor so , but while upgrading the memory the other night it seems to havedied.It would be cool to say I have an 8 bit computer, a 16 bit computer, a 32bit computer and now a 64 bit computer:)  Of course I could do that with anApple G5 though.  To run either in 64 bit mode you'd have to go Linux fornow though.Dain(A2.DAIN, Cat 2, Top 10, Msg 20)[EOA][PLD]PATCH WRITTEN FOR THE LANceGS Driver""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I have written a patch for the LANceGS.Driver, the routing version.  Thearchive patchlance1.shk has been uploaded to the Syndicomm library.From the README, this is what it fixes:* Correct behavior for Link Layer restart.  Both the TCP/IP control paneland Spectrum support restart and without this update, a restart will causeconnections not to work.* Support for broken LanceGS cards "fixed" by LanceHack.  The most commonfailure of LanceGS cards is the EEPROM losing its data.  It will cost overUS$20 to have a card sent to Germany and back and any support charges.Just repair with LanceHack plus use of this driver (and running the setupsoftware to reset the configuration) will get you up and running* ARP requests are handled more intelligently, especially for fastersystems.* Only IP packets are passed to Marinetti.  Non-IP packets can causeMarinetti to hang.* Odd-sized ethernet frames now get sent.  An extra byte was being addedbefore.* No extra bytes are added to received IP frames when passed to Marinetti.* Corrected hanging bug on busy network segments such as cable modem orDSL.  Most LanceGS systems are connected to private networks so unless itis physically connected to the cable/DSL side, this isn't noticed.* Compatible with future ethernet emulation in KEGS.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 20, Top 13, Msg 83)>>>>>"""""I should probably add that the patch is not supported by SHH Systeme and isto be used at your own risk.  If you find any problems with the resultingLANceGS.Driver and can back up your claim with data from NiftyList, GSBug,etc. I'll help you the best I can.

You gave me the best beta testreport ever during the beta cycle of this driver.  Additionalacknowledgements goes to Ryan, Mark, Carl, and Dain who have differentsystems than I do who verified that the software worked as expected.I should probably add this driver still has the same problem as theoriginal where packets will still be sent even if ARP fails.  Unlike theoriginal, my driver will always send the packet to the broadcast MACaddress.  This is really a bad thing, but it almost guarantees that anetwork connection will work.  The fix is to track a lack of an ARP replyand not transmit packets to that IP address.Additional features that would be nice include:* ARP timeout (someone [not me] needs to create a utility to let the userspecify the ARP timeout and then the driver can read the value and use it)* change the "timing" loops to use the event manager to track cyclesinstead of a relying on the CPU speed (loops have to be given extra time torun on an accelerated system, resulting in potentially slower response timefor slower GS's or not enough time for hyper accelerated GS'S).(GEOFF, Cat 20, Top 13, Msg 86)>>>>>"""""I would also like to thank Geoff for his work on the patch for the LANceGSdriver (as well as all of his other work recently).RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 20, Top 13, Msg 87)>>>>>"""""No Kidding Geoff.

I thought I had found a problem with it which I laterlearned was my ignorance after reading appropriate section of the manual.I didn't like that the caret character is used for pointers in thevariables window (considering I was using C).  I was wondering what thegeneral consensus is if Prizm supported both the asterisk and the caret forpointers.  This would maximize compatibility between C and Pascaldevelopers.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 22, Top 28, Msg 18)>>>>>"""""I think that would be nice, if there were an option to choose whichnotation to use for pointers.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 22, Top 28, Msg 19)>>>>>"""""Choice is good.I use Prizm, although I rarely use the debugger.

Or maybe I'm just used to 1600x1200 resolutiondisplays for the last six years.  A interesting project for someone totackle would be to write an X client on the GS so windows are accessible onlarger displays.  This would require patches to the Window Maner, EventManager, Quickdraw, etc.  Because the graphic drawing is offloaded to theclient instead of being needed to be done by the GS, it could prove to be aworkable solution.  And with X servers available on virtually all modernOS's, there's an immediate base of compatibility for usefulness.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 22, Top 28, Msg 21)[EOA][EFD]EMULATOR ISSUE WITH REGARD TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I have been following Richard Bennett-Forrest's series of emulationarticles in Juiced.GS and have been enjoying the content.  As someone whohas added a feature or two into KEGS, it is refreshing to see the point ofview of another approach.  I am very curious to see where Richard is goingbased on his May 2004 article about emulator identification from the IIgsstand point.I have found that the suggested format of using $C04F ID Byte to beextremely limiting and poorly designed for any type of expansion.  Theversion number that it presents is in the form of X.Y.  KEGS is still inthe development stages and the version number hasn't even reached 1.0 yet.Its version number appears as .XY, or using  the $C04F notation, 0.X,losing the second version number digit.  Also, the version number formatbreaks once the major version exceeds 9 (or 15 if BCD is not assumed).  Themouse code changed from 0.85 to 0.86 in KEGS so an application may want totake advantage of the two different scenarios, but can't since the versionnumber returns $08 for both.And how should the emulator ID be defined?  Sweet 16 is Bernie ported to Beso it gets a different ID than Bernie.  KEGS has been ported to manydifferent platforms and comes in many flavors so should it get a differentID for each? KEGSwin, xKEGS, KEGSMac, CasaGS, KEGS32, ActiveGS, andKEGS-Xbox are several ports that have been made.  Something like xKEGS hasdifferent functions depending on which underlying OS it was built on, noteven mentioning that there are assembly versus C cores for specific systemstoo.  A single ID byte may not provide enough information.I await anxiously to see what Richard has come up with.  Hopefully, some ofthese areas of concern would be addressed.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 29, Top 6, Msg 12)>>>>>"""""Well, Sweet16 isn't actually Bernie ported to anything; it's based onBernie but has some key differences (such as the fact that on x86 it's atotally different, C-based, emulation core).  That's why it gets its ownID.  It might actually have made sense for it to report a different ID onPPC versus x86 for that reason.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 29, Top 6, Msg 13)[EOA][COS]Version 1.2 of the Contiki OS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Version 1.2 of the Contiki OS has been announced.  Some of the new featuresare:# Service layer providing dynamic loading and unloading of system services# Multi-threading library# Protothreads: extremely light-weight, stackless threads# Optional socket-like network API based on protothreads# Generic filesystem interface# Kernel rewritten with cleaner API# CTK terminal driver for providing text-based GUI over TelnetIt is amazing that it now has surpassed GS/OS in its capabilities.  Thelast feature mentioned sounds pretty neat since that is essentially VNCusing text (resulting in fast operation for slower computers).Has anybody looked at converting the released LanceGS 8-bit driver into alibrary for Contiki to give Apple II users the ability to take advantage ofits TCP/IP capabilities?Heck, a IIgs port would be neat to take advantage of a full color GUI.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 51, Top 63, Msg 1)>>>>>"""""Contiki's ETH64 ethernet driver uses the same chip as the LanceGS so mostof the work is already done to add LanceGS support for Contiki.

I realize that there are alot of variables with this (primarily the speed of the connection) andwould like some opinions as to how long this time out ought to be.  I'mthinking 10 seconds, but would value some input.Thanks.RyanChief Sysop(A2.RYAN, Cat 57, Top 31, Msg 43)>>>>>"""""Optimally, this should be a user preference with the default being fairlylarge such as 60 seconds.Users on a modem versus those on broadband have different speedexpectations.  Broadband has brought us closer to the "7 second maximum"immediate response time (as specified by the HCI research of BenShneiderman,  http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/ ).  Factors outside user controlis the speed of the mail server (is it busy processing spam) and speed ofthe connection to the server (is it on the other side of the country).So a modem user connecting to a busy server on the other side of thecountry over a slow connection can easily need 60 second timeouts.The POP protocol, especially if the server uses mail format instead ofmdir, may also take a while to generate the information before it will getsent.  Software such Eudora and Exchange have a 30-60 second time out and Ihave seen where the servers needs to process information longer than thattimeout.I hard-coded SIS to use a 30 second time out since that is a decent medianfor slower and faster access users.  Server time-outs are not a commonpreference item to be found in user-level applications.  I personally wouldlike a quicker time-out since it can be a PITA waiting 30 seconds for atime-out, but I kept the higher value since I wasn't the only user of SIS.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 57, Top 31, Msg 44)>>>>>"""""Thanks for your input, Geoff.I wasn't thinking I was actually going to release this little program sinceit was mostly to help me work out my POP3 logic, but I probably will.

It isSO convenient to be able to take a picture and immediately see the results;to be able to take many shots, and eliminate the bad ones; to be able toelectronically transmit my photos to others via the Internet or a CD. Butback before I had a digital camera, I had a standard film-based camera. Theparticular camera that gave me the best results for my photographicendeavors was my Minolta SLR (single-lens reflex) camera. It had automaticfilm advance, it would set the white balance by itself (which means I couldsuccessfully take photos in dim light), and detachable lenses that wouldlet me do long distance photography.     In order to know that the subject I was about to snap was in focus,the lens system would show a two half-circles. The upper one and the lowerone had to be in line with each other, going from            ____                  ____           /    \                /    \        __/______\              /______\       \      /                 \      /        \____/                   \____/          this         to         this.     The image goes from being disjointed to being lined up; when thathappens, the image is in focus.     This final (for now) edition of Illuminating The Lamp brings me backto "the present", so to speak. It was in June of 2002 that I re-connectedwith the Apple II community after an eight-year hiatus, since I left GEniearound 1994. For years, I had been bothering my Apple II author colleagueson the IIScribe mailing list when I had questions about the Apple II forthe purposes of updating or adding to my Apple II History. I had heard (orbeen told) about the benefits of a Syndicomm online membership, and decidedit was time to give it a try. I have not regretted that decision (andprobably the IIScribe people have felt the same way).     When I started looking at the GEnieLamp and Lamp newsletters fromstart to finish, my original purpose was to learn about what were, for me,the "silent years", in which I had very little information about what I hadmissed while I was away. As I read through them, I was re-acquainted withthe parts I remembered, from GenieLamp's origin in 1992 through 1995, andthen onward to the present. And the feeling I had as I approached 2002 waslike focusing the lens on my Minolta camera; the image was becoming moreclear and more "in line" with what I knew the present Apple II world to belike. An interesting feeling, to say the least.WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS     The response to the events of September 11, 2001 continued in 2002, asthe United States gathered a coalition and toppled the Taliban regime inAfghanistan, and continued its search for al Queda leader Osama bin Laden,finding evidence that he was indeed still alive. Focus now began to turn toIraq and Saddam Hussein, amid concerns that weapons of mass destructionwere being produced and hidden there. Within the United States, the energycompany Enron collapsed amid corporate scandal, and WorldCom, the world'ssecond largest long-distance telephone and data service company, filed forbankruptcy in June.     In May, after an eight-month battle, Hewlett-Packard bought CompaqComputer Corp., forming the largest information technology company in theworld. David Smith, creator of the Melissa virus (which caused millions ofdollars of damage to computer networks in 1999), was sentenced to 20 monthsin a federal prison and a $5,000 fine. Intel PC processors achieved speedsof 1.8 GHz, and hard drive capacity hit 60 gigabytes.     Apple CEO Steve Jobs continued to press for faster, more powerful, andmore stylish models of the Macintosh. The iMac transmogrified from acandy-colored and shaped desktop appliance to something that resembled thelamp that symbolized Steve Jobs' other company, Pixar Studios. The newflat-panel iMac, powered by a G4 processor, had a round base and an arm toadjust the flat screen to any desired position. The Power Mac G4 line alsogot a speed bump up to 1 GHz, some models with dual processors to furtherenhance speed. Mac OS X became yet another cat, with the release of"Jaguar", also known as 10.2. It included better graphics management("Quartz Extreme"), an e-mail client with an adaptive spam filter, theAddress Book, Rendezvous networking, iChat (an Apple rebranding of AOL'sInstant Messenger), and speed improvements throughout.THE LAMP! INFO      Controversy and drama was mostly absent from the Apple II world thisyear, now that the exodus from Delphi to Syndicomm had settled down to acomfortable routine. Editor Lyle Syverson began the first of his Tinkerer'sCorner series of articles on hardware projects. KansasFest promotions,Syndicomm postings, a little Delphi scattered in the mix, all togetherrounded out another fine year of reporting on the doings of the lastorganized Apple II community in the online world. And I began to make myown new contribution to the community, related to The Lamp; my own reviewsof the entire series prompted me to begin creating a comprehensive index tothe series of newsletters, with the first edition uploaded in July.DELPHI A2 FORUM     At the start of 2002, it was still possible to access Delphi in textmode via telnet. (However, the address that worked at that time is nolonger effective today). The files that made up the Delphi A2 library weremade available on Syndicomm.com.A2CENTRAL.COM / SYNDICOMM     In January, it was announced in The Lamp! that all of SyndicommOnline's forums had been converted to work with the new bulletin boardsoftware. The same month, new lower prices for Syndicomm were announced.The web side of the Syndicomm was enhanced with additional features,including a display of the count of how many members were in chat. Further,a web-based chat was introduced at that time. Cargotha, an online "MUD"(multi-user dungeon) was opened.     Ken Gagne introduced a new monthly electronic newsletter,Syndicommotion, which had the purpose of helping promote Syndicomm'svarious forums.     The Prolific Quill forum started a plan to have a collaborative storywritten online, about a person named "Douglas". A $20 gift certificate forthe Syndicomm online store was offered to those wishing to contribute tothe story. Unfortunately, to this day additional authors are still beingsought, in order to have the minimum number necessary to make it possiblefor this interesting concept of a group story to get started.     Some of the regulars in the Apple II forum revealed their trueidentities (the jobs they do in the "real" world) in the March issue. Somealso made their Apple II software wish lists (things they'd like to see getwritten).     Also in March, Syndicomm hosted a special online chat with veteranApple II programmer Dave Lyons, with a transcript later posted in thelibrary. Later in the year, another special chat was held featuring RichDreher, the creator of the CFFA Compact Flash reader for the Apple II.     Syndicomm began using an anti-spam filter on mail passing through itsserver in April. In July, the online store was updated to support overseasairmail, as well as payment by check or money order. Additional productswere added for sale at the store.     Eric Shepherd announced in October that Syndicomm would be relocatingto Maryville, Tennessee. As part of the preparations for this move, the newCargotha online RPG was temporarily taken offline. One enhancement that wasto be offered by the move was an upgrade to higher performance servers anda higher bandwidth connection.HARDWARE NEWS     Various topics were addressed in the A2 Forum this year:o Keyboards compatible with the Apple IIGSo Setting the ID on a SCSI hard driveo Refilling and/or disposing of used inkjet printer ink cartridgeso Apple IIe revision differenceso Current sources of No-Slot Clock-compatible hardwareo Keyboard cleaning after a spillo The story of the Mark Twain Apple IIGSo Use of an ImageWriter II on a PCo How to network an Apple IIGS to an iMac or PowerBook     The first mention of Rich Dreher's CFFA compact flash reader for theApple II appeared in the February issue.EMULATOR NEWS     The identity of the first Apple II emulator was debated in April. Useof Bernie ][ The Rescue to get a IIGS (emulated) onto the Internet wasdiscussed in July. A new version of KEGS for Windows (KEGS32) was mentionedin February. How to compile KEGS for Mac OS X was discussed in October.INTERNET NEWS     January saw discussion of how to post e-mail addresses on a web sitein such a way as to avoid making those addresses available to spammers.Other methods of dealing with spam were discussed in later issues.SOFTWARE NEWS:: COLLECTIONS ::     Howard Katz of The Lost Classics project was able to get permissionfrom Mike Harvey, former publisher of Nibble, to have all of Nibble'ssoftware disks released as freeware. A specific collection was notavailable, due to the need to collect working copies of the software.:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::     Platinum Paint was recovered as a Lost Classic release in January, aswas Beagle Bros GSFont Editor, and Quality Software's Bag Of Tricks 2.:: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::     Delphi's A2 Forum discussed:o connecting a PC to an Apple IIGS using Marinettio connecting an Apple IIe to the Internet via a Linux PCo suggestions for potential improvements to Marinetti (specifically makingan alternative TCP/IP stack)o turning on AppleTalk under Mac OS Xo how to make it possible to network a IIGS to a Mac under that newer OS     The A2 Forum on Syndicomm discussed:o various telecommunication software that they had used over the yearso methods of creation of PDF files from a word processing document (notApple II)     Ewen Wannop updated SOAR, his offline message reader for Syndicomm, tov1.0b9, and then soon after to v1.0b10.:: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::     Although not specifically a utility, discussion in April involved theproper way to move a text file from a Mac to an Apple II via a 3.5 disk,while avoiding creation of a resource fork (which 8-bit Apple II programscannot handle).     A test of the MUG! (MS-DOS utilities) NDA by Ryan Suenaga found that,running on Bernie ][ The Rescue, it was possible to read an MS-DOS volumeon a digital camera attached to a Mac via USB.     NiftyList was made available as freeware by Dave Lyons.:: GAMES ::     Jeff Fink continued his updates to Silvern Castle, with 7.4 beingreleased early in the year. Tips on use of the game also appeared in theMarch issue.     The March issue also included a post by Ken Gagne posted an addressfor an article describing the history of online gaming. Although the linklisted there is no longer correct, the article exists today at thisaddress:http://www.gatecentral.com/shared_docs/Timeline1.html     The author, Jessica Mulligan, uses another web site to write articlesgiving her viewpoint on gaming:http://www.skotos.net/articles/bth.htmlPUBLICATIONS     As mentioned above, Syndicommotion was started in January by KenGagne.     Juiced.GS got a face-lift on its web site early in 2002, and itcontinued its publication under new editor Ryan Suenaga. Some of theinfamous upside-down pages began to appear, related to the company withwhom Syndicomm had contracted to do the actual printing and mailing. Thefirst (and possibly last) Juiced.GS swimsuit issue appeared in the summer.A price increase was announced, to account for postage rate increases overthe previous three years.KANSASFEST     Registration forms became available in April's issue, a bit later thanusual. Ryan Suenaga's KFest FAQ, version 3.0, again appeared in April. Apre-KFest 2002 chat was held on Syndicomm on June 17.     Topics discussed at KansasFest this year included RichardBennet-Forrest and his announcement of Florence, a Java-based Apple IIGSemulator, and Jeff Blakeney and IN: The Mailbox, an e-mail client for theIIGS (which he thought would be ready by December). Howard Katz and SandraWarnken had a presentation about user groups, Bruce Baker gave a talk aboutgames published by Softdisk, Sarah Shepherd described Syndicomm's darksecrets.     KansasFest's keynote speaker for 2002 was Tony Diaz (in which heshowed clips of KFest past - all fourteen years that he has attended), andthe recipient of the annual roast was Ryan Suenaga.     The GShisen contest was again held, and was won by Geoff Weiss.     Back in June, I had made a post about my inquiries to the currentowners of Softdisk as to whether or not they would make back issues oftheir disk magazine available for download in their web site's store. Aconsequence of that conversation was getting Softdisk and Sheppy connected,which resulted in an announcement at KFest of Project Barney, a CDcompilation of Softdisk G-S, with a later CD to include the older Softdiskissues.     At the end of event, the dates for KFest 2003 were announced.WRITERS     Ryan Suenaga again wrote his Apple II Achievement awards column for2001, appearing in the January issue of The Lamp! The Best CommercialProduct was given to Juiced.GS' Friends II CD-ROM, with runner-up beinggiven to Ken Gagne's Esprit de Apple Corps CD-ROM collection of graphics,MOD music files, and games. Best Shareware Product went to Kim Howe'sTelnet NDA. Best Freeware Product went to SAFE (Spectrum Automated FileExchange) and Thomas Compter's IIGS translation of Hammurabi. Best WorldWide Web Site was given to A2Central.com, the Best Publication went toJuiced.GS, and the Outstanding Apple II Related Development was awarded toSyndicomm for its efforts to re-release products from EGO Systems,Parkhurst Micro Products, The Byte Works, APDA, and the continuation ofpublication for Juiced.GS magazine. The Outstanding Individual Achievementwas awarded to David Miller, the programming powerhouse behindSyndicomm.com, and to Max Jones, for turning over Juiced.GS to new handsrather than letting it die.MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES     Ken Gagne mentioned in January a web site on which MP3 sounds of anApple II disk drive had been stored.     The floating-point precision limits of Applesoft were reviewed, withdifferences noted between a calculator's solution to 9 to the 9th power andApplesoft's answer to the same math calculation.     In June, A2 Forum members described the ways in which they werecurrently using their Apple II computers.STATS     Here are statistics for the first eleven years of GEnieLamp and TheLamp!
