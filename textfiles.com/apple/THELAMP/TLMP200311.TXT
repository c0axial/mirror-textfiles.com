Larry wasconvinced that John Deere tractors and Chevrolet cars were superior toother makes... after all his father had chosen those brands... and he hadgreat respect for his father.  I was equally adamant that Farmall tractorsand Ford cars were superior.     If you have a strong opinion as to what computer you like or dislikeyou might want to consider a more tolerant point of view.  Learning to usethe other brand(s) gives you the opportunity to keep up with your email andother online activities while you are traveling by using borrowedcomputers... you know, uncle Harry's or your friend's computer... or thatcomputer in the motel lobby for the use of the guests. [EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[KGS]KIT GRAHAM AND SPECTRUM SCRIPTS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Wasn't there a Kit Graham who wrote scripts to make CoPilot work onCompuServe using Spectrum 2.0?(KGAGNE, Cat 2, Top 31, Msg 42)>>>>>"""""Yes indeed.

And yes, I evenlike watching Star Trek in its various incarnations as they have appearedon television. One episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation that I enjoyedinvolved Dr. Beverly Crusher faced with a mystery. The crew, the ship, eventhe universe itself seemed to be contracting around her. First she finds anold friend missing -- but no one even acknowledges that he ever came onboard. Then the population of the ship has decreased dramatically -- but noone else seems to find it unusual that a ship built to carry over 1,000 hasa crew of only a few hundred. As the problem accelerates, she ultimatelyfinds herself the only person left on board the ship, and the definition ofthe nature of the universe (as given by the ship's computer) is a spherenot much larger than the ship itself. She eventually deduces that it's herson Wesley's fault, and she is trapped in a static warp bubble that iscontracting slowly down to nothing. She must make a run from the bridge tothe place on the ship where it was originally created, to escape back tothe real world.This is much the situation facing our valiant crew aboard the USS Genieduring the year 1997. Not only was the Apple II universe continuing tocontract around them, as it had every year since Apple Computer pulled theplug on their foundation microprocessor, but their ship was becomingsteadily less populated. Their crew quarters were becoming smaller. Andyes, even their Ship's Computer was showing some signs of malfunctioning.To find out more about these and other mysteries, read on with me as welook at GenieLamp in the landmark year of 1997.BALL OF CONFUSION (THAT'S WHAT THE WORLD IS TODAY)In the world at large in 1997, the cult known as Heaven's Gate convincedits members to commit mass suicide, expecting aliens to take them out ofthis planet. Timothy McVeigh was sentenced to death for the Oklahoma Cityfederal building bombing. Convictions were also handed down for the bombingthat had previously occurred at the World Trade Center in New York. Themovie "Titanic" made its debut as the most expensive motion picture of alltime. A new British female author named J. K. Rowling had her first bookpublished in the U.K under the title, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher'sStone" (later changed slightly for the American market). Britain's PrincessDiana is killed in a car crash in Paris, and another beloved figure, MotherTeresa, died in Calcutta, India.The first DVD's (Digital Video Disc or Digital Versatile Disc, depending onyour interpretation) went on sale. Microsoft released Office 97, andannounced the next version of its operating system, Windows 98. They alsoreleased version 2 of Microsoft Windows CE (sometimes called "WINCE" by thepress, and designed as an operating system for non-Palm pen-basedcomputers). The speed of the Intel Pentium was bumped up to 233 MHz. Thefirst version of IEEE's 802.11 wireless networking standard was released inJune. America Online bought out CompuServe, but rather than merging withit, left it as an independent online computer service. And the Internetbookseller Amazon.com made shares of its stock available for publictrading.With Apple's purchase of the NeXTSTEP operating system from NeXT, intendedfor use as the basis for their next version of Mac OS, Steve Jobs alsoreturned to Apple in an advisory role. Although new CEO Gil Amelio did hisbest to cut expenses, by the middle of 1997 he had been removed from hismanagement position. It was at this point that Steve Jobs took on a moreactive role within the company. By September, his position was identifiedas "interim CEO". One of his first actions was to discontinue the Macintoshlicensing program that earlier CEO's had started. The rationale for thismove was that since hardware sales were the major income producer for thecompany, and since clone makers could produce and sell the computers for alower cost than could Apple, every sale of a Mac clone was draining moneyaway from Apple. It was in September that the license program wasterminated, and Apple acquired the assets of Power Computing, one of theclone manufacturers. By November, a new series of Macintosh computers basedon the G3 processor was announced, and was expected to have greater powerthan similarly configured Pentium-based computers. The Apple Store wasopened for sales directly from the Web, and an agreement with CompUSAresulted in plans for an "Apple Store within a store".Mac OS 8 was released in July, and in September Jobs shocked the Macintoshfaithful with his announcement of an alliance with rival Microsoft. Thisdeal involved agreements by Microsoft to buy $150 million worth of Applestock, and commitments to continue to produce Macintosh versions of itsOffice software. Apple in turn agreed to bundle the Mac version ofMicrosoft's Internet Explorer on its new computers, displacing NetscapeNavigator completely.GENIELAMP INFO1997 began with a new editor for GenieLamp. Ryan Suenaga took over thereigns of the newsletter from Doug Cuff, who had concluded his record runwith the December 1996 issue. The new masthead read like this: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////|| GenieLamp Apple II     ~ A T/TalkNET Publication ~      Vol.5, Issue 57||""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""||Publisher.................................................John F.

Starting in May and continuing for the rest ofthe year, he placed former editor Doug Cuff's name on the masthead withhis: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////|| GenieLamp Apple II     ~ A T/TalkNET Publication ~     Vol.6, Issue 63 ||""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""||""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""||Editor...................................................Ryan M. Suenaga||Editor Emeritus................................................Doug Cuff||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////||________________________________________________________________________|GEnieLamp A2Pro had gone out of production a full year earlier. Still,Richard Bennett had been saving pertinent postings from the A2ProRoundtable, and gave Suenaga a distillation of these messages for inclusionin GenieLamp A2. These messages ran over the next several issues.Though no longer in the editor's seat, Doug Cuff kept his hand in bycontributing the File Bandwagon column from March through September. Healso helped with creation of the HyperStudio and HyperCard versions ofGenieLamp during part of the year.With a recurrent struggle to release GenieLamp on its traditional first ofthe month, Suenaga made the decision in July to change the publication datefor the newsletter to the fifteenth of the month. This made it easier tofit it into his own busy schedule.Because of the significant decline in A2 Roundtable activity that occurredafter July (see below), Suenaga also had to come to a difficult decision,which he announced in his September editorial. He decided to terminateGenieLamp A2's run after the October 1997 issue. With sadness and regret,Suenaga created the last issue (Volume 6, Issue 68) of GenieLamp A2 inOctober 1997, but vowed to return soon with a new publication based fromDelphi.ROUNDTABLE NEWSBy late 1996 it was becoming obvious that the new owners of Genie were NOTdoing all they could to make it a successful online venture. In fact, everymove Yovelle had made since taking over the service seemed calculated todiscourage new users from signing up, and to annoy seasoned veterans enoughto make them decide to leave. In particular, the price increase they hadimplemented had made Genie THE most expensive online service available.Some members voiced the suspicion that Yovelle was actually trying to KILLOFF the service, likely having some other use in mind for Genie'smainframes.Because of these changes, the biggest problem facing the Apple II communityon Genie during 1997 was an accelerating decline in membership. Some movedover to CompuServe, and others migrated to Delphi (which still had atext-friendly interface).Even Gary Utter, long-time A2 leader and co-owner of Syndicomm (which ranthe Apple II Roundtables on Genie) was feeling the squeeze of A2'scontraction. Posts of his (from December) that appeared in the Januaryissue actually recommended to people that they look at Delphi as analternative to Genie. Delphi was continuing to upgrade its service, and hadestablished an Internet access pathway before Genie had done so. This was abold statement from one whose job it was purportedly to encourage use ofGenie; however, he was likely aware of activities behind the scenes thatwere not evident to the average user. In addition, Syndicomm wasdiversifying its influence by starting A2 and A2Pro forums on Delphi.Utter's reasoning was that if Genie WAS going down the tubes, Delphi was agood alternative. If Genie DID survive, Delphi would make a good additionalaccess point.In February's issue of GenieLamp, Utter's personal announcement of January1st was reprinted. This message indicated that he had finally given up hisGenie membership and was moving over to Delphi. The comments in thismessage are pertinent to the real feeling of community that had built upover the years, a community that was disintegrating right beforeeverybody's eyes: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||Category 2,  Topic 7                                                    ||Message 358  Wed Jan 01, 1997                                           ||H.MOST [Hindmost]  at 02:04 EST                                         ||                                                                        ||Well, gang, this is my last night on Genie.                             ||                                                                        ||After something more than 8 years, I'm leaving.                         ||                                                                        ||I was tempted to post this with my original DISPATCHER account (which   ||has had a name change to SOAPY.SUE and is being used by The Lovely      ||Susan).                                                                 ||                                                                        ||(Come to think of it, the ORIGINAL name on that account was G.UTTER.)   ||                                                                        ||I want to talk about all the good times I've had here, I want to        ||reminisce about so many of the friends I've made here (many of whom left||a long time ago), I want to say a LOT of things, but there doesn't seem ||to be much point.

Utter....................................utter@delphi.com       ||________________________________________________________________________|There were certainly differences of opinion on this matter. Tom Zuchowski,another of the A2 sysops, stated that although Delphi might represent theFUTURE for Apple II users, he maintained that their PRESENT was still onGenie. He was concerned that the fall of Genie would be guaranteed ifeveryone who still remained decided to abandon it for Delphi.The "mere months" that Utter predicted did not actually come to pass.However, declining numbers in various Roundtables did result in Genie'smanagement making the decree that lower traffic areas be removed. The A2sysops learned only shortly before it was to happen that the A2Pro RT hadbeen slated for termination by the last week in June. The sysops decisionwas to merge A2Pro with A2; and on a single day, June 26, 1997, they madethe transition. Aside from the confusion that occurred by moving all of theexisting content in A2Pro into A2 (there were also a large number of "new"messages that suddenly appeared) the merger was successful, and it savedthe content in A2Pro that had been collected over many years.To add to this ball of confusion and turmoil, Genie's management announcedin July that as of September 1, 1997, some major changes would be made tothe service. These changes in how the Roundtables worked and displayedtheir messages would result in causing ALL of the existing offline readersfor Genie to stop working. This would cause big problems for those whodepended on those offline readers to read and post messages. In regards toGenieLamp, this would also significantly affect the ability of GenieLampeditor Suenaga to obtain the postings that made up a significant portion ofeach issue of the newsletter. This announcement became just one more reasonto make the exodus from the A2 Roundtable to Delphi.By early September, the Delphi A2 Forum was swelling with refugees fromGenie. Back in July, Delphi had opened its forums to free access via theInternet and a web browser. August saw activity in the A2 Forum increasesignificantly. The primary drawback to using Delphi instead of Genie wasthe few number of files in the library on Delphi. However, the A2 sysopsfrom Genie had been for years keeping copies offline of all files uploaded.This safeguard measure would make it possible for most of the library to bereproduced elsewhere if and when it became necessary.HARDWARE NEWSBill Shuff had written an article for II Alive on how to create areplacement cable for the TransWarp GS accelerator. He was, however, upsetto see that the II Alive editor had seen fit to make changes to his articlethat made the instructions actually to be in error. Being true to thegiving spirit of most Apple II users, Shuff vowed to make cables for anyonewho was unsuccessful in making a cable based on the botched instructionsprinted in this article.A recurring theme in messages reproduced in GenieLamp (and The Lamp!) hasbeen distinguishing differences between Apple 3.5 drives, SuperDrives, andtheir respective controller cards. This was again discussed in February.EMULATOR NEWSGus, the Apple IIGS emulator for the PowerMac developed by some formerApple II programmers at Apple on their own time, was reported to perform atabout the same speed as an accelerated IIGS (when run on a PowerMac 6100 at60 MHz). In April, a statement was made which clarified that this projectwould NOT be an official Apple product. It made a brief appearance atApple's World Wide Developer's Conference in June (during a demonstrationof one of the versions of Apple's next operating system).In January, F.E. Systems' emulator "Fast Eddie" Beta 1 was available forpublic testing. By the April issue, the official name of the product wasreported to be "Bernie ][ The Rescue". In July, the team writing theemulator had successfully gotten it to print on the Macintosh on which itwas running.SOFTWARE NEWS:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::The Byte Works, long a supplier of computer languages for the Apple IIGS,came through again in 1997 with the March announcement of development ofGSoft BASIC. This comprehensive BASIC compiler was designed to be backwardcompatible with Applesoft BASIC (which had undergone almost NO changessince it first appeared on the original Apple II back in 1978), but tookadvantage of the extended memory and power of the Apple IIGS. It also wasan interpreted BASIC, as was Applesoft, but had significantly more power.It worked within the same ORCA shell environment as all other Byte Workslanguages, and could also create self-contained GS/OS applications out of aGSoft BASIC source file.Publish-It! also made a little bit of news in 1997. Hugh Hood had plans torelease some patches to the program that improved its function,particularly with laser printers. The delaying factor on release of thiswas a pending "important announcement" that prevented him from making thesepatches available. Unfortunately, the outcome of either this announcementor this patch did not ever appear in GenieLamp (or later in The Lamp!)Jawaid Bazyar and Procyon released GNO/ME 2.0.4 to freeware status(although the manuals still sold for $30).:: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::Back when Tom Weishaar was in charge of Syndicomm, Richard Bennett had beenapproached about writing a program for the Apple IIGS to manage access toGEnie. This was to be a more inclusive approach than GEM or CoPilot, whichrequired use of more than one program to manage messages (reading andreplying), and more like the all-inclusive programs that were available forother platforms. He got started on the project just after Syndicomm wastransferred to Gary Utter and Dean Esmay, but what often delayed theproject over the years was the continuing changes to the GEnie userinterface programming requirements (the API).The original code name for the program was "Jasmine". This name wasincluded in the online poll for a potential product name, and a majority ofthe A2 Roundtable members liked it also. An early version of the programwas demonstrated at KansasFest that same year.Beta testing for this program happened over an extended period of time.Dave Miller had been involved in the A2Pro Roundtable for quite a while,and as a sysop. One other position that he had during 1997 was as a betatesting coordinator for Jasmine. Miller made an announcement in Januarythat the final beta version of this program had been uploaded to the A2library. It was expected that with the decline in Genie, it was unlikelythat the program could ever get fully completed, so releasing it as anunsupported beta program would allow it to at least be used.Derek Taubert's GS/TCP continued to generate excitement about thepossibility of direct Internet connection. However, completion of thisproject was delayed, and without a functioning TCP/IP stack, Internetaccess for the IIGS seemed unobtainable.In spite of this apparent road block, Seven Hills Software announced inMarch a long-awaited product for the Apple IIGS: A real web browser.Spectrum Internet Suite (SIS) functioned much like the commercial NetscapeNavigator web browser available for the Macintosh and Windows platforms,with the exception of not displaying the GIF and JPEG graphics thosebrowsers were capable of. More amazing was the fact that it did this as aset of SCRIPTS and XCMDS for use with the Spectrum graphic terminalprogram. It did require a Unix shell account for actual Internet access,but had also been designed to work with Genie's Internet gateway. Theoriginal concept came about with an impromptu meeting at KansasFest 1996between Geoff Weiss, Ewen Wannop, Dave Hecker, and others. This firstversion of SIS made it possible to access the Internet WITHOUT the need forTCP/IP.Don Zahniser made his contribution to the Apple II community by releasingfor the IIGS an offline reader for Delphi access called OLRight! In thespirit of its predecessors GEM and CoPilot, this script set pulled togetherANSITerm, Hermes (Andre Horstmann's freeware text editor NDA), and InstantReplay (a freeware NDA macro environment written by Jason Simmons) to doits magic. Using the Genie Internet gateway, OLRight! could go to Delphi,get new messages, post replies, and log off. An account on Delphi was, ofcourse, a necessary requirement. OLRight! updates were delivered inJanuary, and by June version 2.2 was made available.Deciding that offline reading of Delphi should not be limited to ANSITerm,Ewen Wannop released Crock O' Gold, a set of scripts to use with Spectrum(which he had written for Seven Hills Software).Ryan Suenaga discussed ways of accessing e-mail via an ISP using a VT-100terminal program. Talk Is Cheap v4.02 from Don Elton was still available ina limited fashion with disks and manual. CoPilot for ANSITerm v2.5.6 wasuploaded in January.:: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::A few new products appeared in this category. Chris Vavruska releasedseveral Finder Extension utilities in 1997, including FinderFlipper,FinderRefresher, WorkSets, and CD Remember. Eric Shepherd released ShiftyList 2.0, a significant update to his previous Softdisk G-S utility.SlixSecurity was a security NDA for the IIGS released by Bret Victor. Itprevented access to the computer without a password. Seven Hills Softwarereleased an update to Hierarchic, bringing it to version 1.6.3.:: GAMES ::Defender Of The World, an unfinished game by David Ong Tat-Wee ofSingapore, was uploaded.Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS game, announced by Joe Kohn in 1996, was availablefor beta testing in January, and a demo was available for download soonafterwards.Eric Shepherd was spending what time he had available to finish upWolfenstein 3D and release it as a final product. However, since it hadbecome a freeware product, it had to take a back seat to other projectsthat would actually produce an income for him. Testing on the gamecontinued through 1997, but the finished version was not available duringthe year.HACKINGModifications to the function of ProDOS and GS/OS were common themes inthese days of no direct support from Apple Computer. Discussions includedhow to remap slot assignments in ProDOS 8 without moving peripheral cards(especially intended for use with a Laser 128EX and an expansion box).INTERNET NEWSDavid Kerwood opened "A2-Web" in the first part of 1997. Billing itself as"The Mother Of All Apple II Web Sites", it was hosted on the newwww.syndicomm.com web site. It included links to all Apple II-relatedcompanies on the Internet, as well as Apple II user groups and otherrelated information. Although it displayed just fine on the graphic webbrowsers that ran on Macintosh or Windows computers, it was also optimizedto display well on text-based web browsers (both SIS and Lynx). In fact, hehad included some special things for people coming to the site with the SISbrowser.PUBLICATIONSJuiced.GS began its second year with a cover story about Spectrum InternetSuite, and stayed on schedule for the remainder of the year. It continuedto receive enthusiastic comments from its readers in posts they made on theA2 Roundtable.The Apple Blossom was running a little behind in late 1996, but publisherSteve Cavanaugh had plans to resume a timelier schedule.Cavanaugh's Apple Blossom Publishing branched out with an additionalpublication during 1997. This new disk-based magazine was called HyperQuarterly. Designed to work with HyperCard IIGS, and edited by Hangtime andGareth Jones, it presented stacks and stack design information and tools,much as Script-Central did when Resource Central was in business. Its firstissue was shipped in June.The AppleWorks Gazette experienced problems with keeping up with theplanned publication schedule, but co-editor Howard Katz expressed hisintentions to get caught up. Chris Serreau, the other editor, was aCompuServe member and did not directly participate on Genie.Joe Kohn's Shareware Solutions II published a couple of issues during theyear, and one issue included an article on networking by Steve Disbrow(formerly of GS+ Magazine).Softdisk G-S ended its run as a disk magazine for the Apple IIGS, with itsfinal issue (#82) released in March 1997.II Alive was still in print, but was struggling to gather enough articlesto put out an issue. Even when there WERE enough articles to print, therewere problems (see the above note regarding Bill Shuff's article).COMPANIESTulin, distributor of Floptical drives and CD-ROM drives for the Apple IIcommunity for several years, went out of business in January 1997. One ofTulin's employees, Wing Cheung, acquired their remaining stock of drivesand Flopitcals, and was making them available for purchase, along with thesoftware drivers to use with these units.In the March issue, it was reported that Carl Kenepaske, owner of CalokeIndustries, had died suddenly. Caloke was a mail-order public-domainsoftware provider, and with the death of the owner of the company, so didhis company die.Steve Disbrow of EGO Systems had to announce the closure of his Apple IImail order business at the end of June, yet another casualty of theshrinking Apple II market. Joe Kohn of Shareware Solutions II arranged withhim to continue distribution of Addressed For Success and other EGOproducts.Shareware Solutions II also continued its function as a distributor ofsoftware, by offering an updated version of the Harmonie printer driver forthe IIGS. He also made available the entire run of Open-Apple, A2-Central,and A2-Central-On-Disk as a CD-ROM compilation. He also was a distributorfor Harmonie and for the software line from Kitchen Sink Software.KANSASFESTSponsored by InTrec Software, KansasFest 1997 was held July 30 throughAugust 3, again at Avila College in Kansas City, MO. Coordinated by the"Big Cheese", Cindy Adams, it included presentations by Joe Kohn, MaxJones, Geoff Weiss, Steve Cavanaugh, and Ryan Suenaga. Also, planned weredemonstrations from Apple Computer (who did not show up), Apple BlossomPublishing, SheppyWare, and F.E. Systems (featuring "Bernie ][ TheRescue").To the disappointment of the organizers of the event, attendance was lowerthan in previous years. David Kerwood gave the keynote address, and RichardBennett was roasted. Kerwood also kept his web site, "A2-Web", updatedregularly with news of the goings-on at the conference.The most significant product introduction at the conference was that madeby Richard Bennett. His Apple IIGS control panel, Marinetti, made TCP/IPcommunication possible, and Bennett generously made it available asfreeware.REVIEWSThere were a few products, some new and some old, that were reviewed during1997 in GenieLamp:o Quick Click Morph, by Doug Cuffo Focus Drive, by Ryan Suenagao Change-A-File, by Doug Cuffo Hyper Quarterly, by Ryan Suenagao Marinetti, by Ryan SuenagaWRITERSMax Jones (of Juiced.GS) contributed an article in the February issue ofGenieLamp, as well as a interview about SIS in a later issue.Peter Brickell's "Real World Apple" series reappeared in the April issue,with a description of how to build a temperature sensor that interfacedwith an Apple II, and later how to make use of the push button inputs andannunciators.Doug Cuff wrote about issues involved in getting permission to make use ofother people's graphic and audio content, and reprised his "AccidentalTourist At KansasFest" column, updated for 1997.INTERVIEWSo Bret Victor, by Max Joneso The Spectrum Internet Suite development team, by Max JonesMISCELLANEOUS FEATURESSuenaga did some research on his own to determine the truth about a rumorfloating around the Internet. It had been suggested somewhere thatWordPerfect for the Apple II had been released as freeware. When hecommunicated with someone at Corel, the company that at that time ownedWordPerfect, it was discovered that the rights to the Apple II version hadbeen sold years earlier, but no records had been kept as to whom it hadbeen sold.An Applesoft programming course was hosted in A2Pro, and the five lessonswere uploaded to the A2Pro Library in June.Joachim Nelson made a comment about software piracy, and how useful itwould be to have a serial number in ROM to use in identifying a paid ownerof a program. Although this practice has not been possible to implement onthe Apple II (since no new models have been manufactured), it HAS becomestandard practice to use a unique unlock code on modern software.STATSHere are statistics for the six years of GEnieLamp's run. The numbers referto the size of each issue in "K" (kilobytes):Year    Min     Max     Avg----    ----    ----    ----1992    116K    212K    156K1993     80K    256K    172K1994    124K    216K    165K1995     92K    176K    125K1996     80K    192K    116K1997     44K    124K     85KClearly, the decreased amount of available material and contributionsaffected the size of GenieLamp significantly during this, Ryan Suenaga'sfirst year as editor.BACK IN TIMESo far, we have covered the five years 1993 through 1997, the GEnieLampportion of the era of the Lamp publications. Next time we move into thesecond portion of this period, looking at the Apple II world through theeyes of the ascendancy of Delphi. Until then, stay clear of static warpbubbles and the shrinking worlds within them!Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.orgReferences for 1997 historical info:Apple Computer, Inc.: A Historyhttp://www.geocities.com/Athens/3682/applehistory.htmlApple History Timelinehttp://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/history.htmlThe Apple Museumhttp://applemuseum.bott.org/Computer History For 1990-2000http://www.computerhope.com/history/19902000.htmHistory of Computing Industrial Era 1994-2000http://www.thocp.netInformation Please: 1997http://infoplease.lycos.com/year/1997.htmlTimeline of the 90s, 1997http://www.inthe90s.com/generated/time1997.shtml[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][NSA]November 2003 Issue of Syndicommotion Available"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The November 2003 (Volume 2, Number 11) issue of Syndicommotion has beenemailed to subscribers.
