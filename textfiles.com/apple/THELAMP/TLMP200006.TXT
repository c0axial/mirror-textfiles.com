With Super Hi Res   graphics and a synthLAB-based musical soundtrack, Ultima I for the   IIGS was brought to market by Vitesse, and it received critical   acclaim from Apple IIGS game players.   Sadly, Ultima I was available for sale for only a short time, as   Vitesse is no longer in business. But, in order to assure that even   new IIGS owners could partake in the same joys as previous generations   of Apple II users, Bill Heineman and Joe Kohn have teamed up once   again, and the IIGS version of Ultima I is once again available.

Official word was thatthe Apple II series lacked the power to run Ultima VI (however we all knowbetter).

If I reset back to   gray (my choice), then reboot, it goes back to default blue.2) randomly sets the date and clock -- yesterday it was March 15, 1952;   today it's March 11, 1995. (I had corrected the date in between these   two to today, well - yesterday - but it reset the date again.)Both of these are control panel functions, so I'm wondering if they'reindicative of what? battery failure perhaps? Janet L.... - Fri 11 Aug 1995 9:26:14 am Message delivered by Spectrum 2.2 and rushed to you by Crock O' Gold 3.0!(TITANBASE, 31419, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""The Control Panel settings _should_ be retained after making changes,performing a warm boot (Control-Apple-Reset) and throughout your entiresession of using the computer. They should only be lost after powering downthe computer and starting it back up again. The battery is only put intooperation when main power is switched off--in fact this is why a IIgsthat's used regularly will have a longer battery life span than one thatfrequently sits dormant or put in storage.One of the IIgs's I recently bought came with a dead battery. The ControlPanel always returns to its default factory settings after I switch it off(that is all options are checked). The clock defaults to the year "04" if Iremember right (1904 or 2004, probably the former). If your clock isdisplaying random years it could just be the battery failing and not yetdrained completely, or the other possibility is some program is corruptingyour Control Panel settings.I've seen it happen before. Then there are programs that like to changeyour Control Panel settings behind your back, Accolade's Test Drive IIcomes to mind.To be sure it's your battery at fault, do the following:1) Turn on your IIgs; do not load any software from floppy or hardisk2) Enter the Control Panel3) Change the screen colors and adjust the clock correctly.4) Exit Control Panel (so settings are saved)5) Switch off main-power6) Let IIgs remain *off* for an hour or soSwitch it back on after letting it rest. Are your custom screen colorsdisplayed? Is the clock showing the right time and date? If not, yourbattery needs to be replaced. Otherwise you may to want try switching itoff and letting it rest overnight and see what happens.Battery replacement requires a 3.6v (1/2 sized AA) lithium battery. The ROM3 motherboard is a simple swap, while the ROM 00/01 board will requireclipping out the old battery and adding a new one with wire leads that wraparound the remaining "posts". Night Owl used to sell a kit replacementbattery, though not sure if they still do or even if they're still inbusiness.Mitchell Spector {<mailto:cw308@torfree.net> cw308@torfree.net}(SPECTOR1, 31425, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""I realize many factors, as Mitch suggests up-topic, affect battery life.But I was wondering, what is the average lifespan of a IIGS battery? Max Jones Juiced.GS http://www.wbwip.com/juiced.gs(JUICEDGS, 31430, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""I would think the "average" IIgs battery would last 6-8 years. Apple saidthe IIgs battery has a life expectancy of 10 years. There were a number ofreports of people saying they need to get a new battery within two years.My 1988 ROM 01 is still on the original battery (well beyond 10 years). Theclock runs a little fast, but it is keeping time. I expect to one day turnmy IIgs on and see that the battery died. I have been using Lithium for thelast eight years or so for BRAM recovery in case of a battery failure.Geoff(SISGEOFF, 31431, GO COM A2)<<<<<"""""My ROM1 battery is still going strong after 12 years, I've had it for about9 years and I doubt it was changed in the first 3. At one stage I hadn'tused the machine for about 4 years, while I ventured off track into theworld of PC's, the GS's battery was still OK after all that time.On the other hand I bought another ROM1 recently and it's battery was asdead as a doornail. From memory I was getting dates of 1952 on that machineevery time I switched it off then on. And a dead ROM3 I picked up recentlyhad a good battery, although a little harder to tell if it was ever changedbecause they are just socketed, like the Mac's.I would say 10 years give or take a couple would be average.One more point, I have yet to see a GS's battery eat it's mother, unlikemany 386 & 486 Pee Cee's.Mark.(LUKE65816, 31434, GO COM A2)[EOA][NFW]NINJAFORCE WEBSITE UPDATE"""""""""""""""""""""""""May 29, 2000Software Updates!Hot and fresh: Asimov, our famous disk image creation program, hasundergone a major overhaul and is now capable of handling all Apple II andIIGS image file formats.

I would like to begin to write a program for the IIGS, but needsome ideas on how to start (hence the chosen topic). I want to write awargame, similar to "Panzer General" in a desktop environment. I'm at a bitof a loss as to where to start graphically, though. I'm imagining ascrolling map, which of course would move under the current window, butshould I be drawing each individual hex as the window scrolls, (usingdrawing commands) or would I be better off loading a picture file, andre-drawing it, and then drawing my units on top of it?Any advice would be appreciated._________  | homas(TCOMPTER, 3044, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""Just to clarify the last message, the "model" for my game would besomething like "ForestFire," a game released on SoftDISK GS oh-so-manyyears ago.It seems to me, (who has only written a few game utilities, etc in thedesktop, or toolbox environment) the hardest part is the map -- scrollingit around, selecting units, moving units, etc.  The game mechanics seempretty straightforward.So can any of the experienced programmers out there give me a hint on howthey would approach the map problem? Is there a certain section of themanuals (I have most of them) or any of Mike Westerfield's courses (I havemost of them) that I could look in for ideas?Thanks again for any tips.__________  | homas(TCOMPTER, 3045, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""How fast do you want the scrolling to be? You can't do real-time x-yscrolling using the toolbox on a stock GS.I'm sure Nathan Mates has written a few messages on Delphi that mentionssome of the theory to best do scrolling (and computer gaming in general).I would look over those.I would think you just have square tiles for each object. Since you areworking on a hex grid, you would need two tile types for each graphic. Onetype would be where the hexagon is flat on top and the other is where thehexagon is pointy on top. This way, you can smoothly scroll sections of thewindow and only draw what needs to be drawn after a scroll. Without knowinganything else (size of spaces, the frequency of a graphic in a space,etc.), this is probably the best option.Geoff(SISGEOFF, 3046, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""> the hardest part is the map -- scrolling it around, selecting units...First thing I would try is to just draw everything and let QuickDraw clipit, then see if that is fast enough.Steve Reeves(REEVESST, 3047, GO COM A2P)<<<<<"""""Although, if you force scrolling to stay on a one-tile-size limit (ie, noscrolling parts of tiles into view), you can compute which tiles will bevisible in a given view quite easily, and only draw those each frame ofscrolling.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 3048, GO COM A2P)[EOA][PSP]PROGRAMMING THE SERIAL PORT"""""""""""""""""""""""""""What is the easiest way to input and output via the serial port fromORCA/M, ORCA/C or ORCA Basic?I have numerous external devices that I'd like to write programs for on myIIgs.

You'll be alittle more familiar with the programming style so it won't take as long tofigure out what the program is doing. :-)> I guess the question is whether the firmware can handle 9600 bps> communications, or should a program that goes directly to the serial> chip be written. I assume that's how the "big-boys" do it.I'm pretty sure the firmware routines can handle data at 19,200 bps butprobably not at a sustained rate. If you are just sending or receivingsmall bursts or a steady stream of data with an overall rate less than19,200 bps you would probably be okay.However, I do believe most serious communications software goes directly tothe hardware. If you aren't worried about distributing this program toothers then you might not have to worry about supporting other interfacesbesides the IIgs serial ports.Anyways, it sounds like you have some information and a direction so I'llleave you to it. Have fun. Jeff Blakeney Dean of the Apple II University in the A2Pro forum(JBLAKENEY, 3039, GO COM A2P)<<<<<"""""Re: Programming the Serial Port under GSOS and ORCA(I just typed in a long reply, but when I went to post it the net wasacting up and all was lost. This time I'm typing it off-line and trying cutand paste!)Over the weekend I got some time to do some reading and playing with ORCAand the serial port. There was some success but one problem remains.Perhaps someone could shed some light on the cause.Under GSOS the system creates generic drivers when regular drivers don'texist.  The generic drivers created for the two serial ports are .DEV2 and.DEV3 for the modem and printer ports respectively. In the past I've neverbeen able to do anything with these drivers. However, the other day I triedTYPIng a test file and using redirection to .DEV3 to see what happens underthe ORCA shell:TYPE filename > .DEV3...resulted in the printer (an old Imagewriter II) producing output. It wasall on one line, but after adding the proper serial port firmware command(Cntl-I LE, I believe) the printer responded correctly.With that success, I tried sending and receiving to a serial device usingthe modem port. The serial device I was using is a Motorola Oncore 12 GPSevaluation board. In NMEA mode it runs at 4800 bps and receives and sendstext strings terminated with a CR and LF. Once sent the proper command theboard will send out a line of about 63 - 67 text characters once persecond.I wrote a short program in ORCA/C that opens .DEV2 for writing, resets theserial port by sending Cntl-A R, and sends the proper command out theserial port. The second part of the program reopens .DEV2 for reading andreads and numbers 20 lines of data from the GPS, printing each line to thescreen.I ran the first part of the program and could see I was sending data to theGPS receiver, though it was not responding. Evidently ORCA/C converts thenewline character from a LF to a CR so two CRs were being sent. The GPSwon't respond until it receives the CRLF combination. After checking theORCA/C documentation I found that the port must be opened for "wb" writebinary, to preserve the newline (LF) character. When this was done I wasable to send commands to the GPS and it would respond properly!Next, I tried the second part of the program. On the first attempt itseemed to freeze the computer (I'm very impatient!) After checking myprogram and finding all in order I tried it again and waited. The GPS wascurrently to output once every 5 seconds. After about a minute and 20seconds the first fifteen lines showed up on the screen, all at once! Afteranother similar period of time the remaining 5 lines showed up and theprogram terminated normally. The data received was intact and looked good.I was getting input, but for some reason it was being buffered and notavailable to the program until approximately 1K of data was received. Myprogram reads the data using the fgets() function. I also tried the fgetc()function, collecting the characters into a string with the same results. Iturned off buffering in the control panel, and the only change was that Istarted to lose characters between the two blocks of input.Does anyone have any idea what is buffering the stream of data? Is it afunction of ORCA/C or the .DEV2 driver. Any suggestions would beappreciated. If I can get this figured out, the serial port should beusable for things like PIC programmers, GPS, etc. without having to write aserial driver.(more to come, I hope)Cheers, Bob(BOBAF6C, 3050, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""ORCA/C's stdio library routines use a 1024-byte buffer by default.
