Other than turning down the gain on the soundcard and in the Control Panel, how's the best way to reduce the sound ofhum?  In other words, how's the best way to shield the card from electronicnoise inside my Apple ][gs?Aluminum foil?  block of lead?  tachion particle field?There's no metal shield on the inside of the lid; would that influenceextraneous sounds coming from the speakers?FWIW, the sound card (slot 3) is separated from other cards by an emptyslot.  That's the greatest distance it can hope to achieve from othercards.I've got the Radio Shack amplified speakers, cat. number 40-1407 in case itmatters.

I will list general questionsthat will need answering if you wish to be a beta tester.  No beta testingexperience is necessary--just free time on your hands.Project Delta Phi will be Open Source software--this means that I will becollecting any money by users of this software.  This, in turn, means thatbeta testing is a volunteer effort--any expenses that are incurred can notbe reimbursed (i.e. Internet time, disks, etc.).As with any beta software, you may experience crashes, hangs, etc. undernormal everyday use.  You must be prepared to deal with such occurrences.Any individual involved with Project Delta Phi can not discuss to anyonethat they are involved with Project Delta Phi until the software isofficially announced.Beta testing qualification is based on the answers given to the followingquestion.  To make life easier, most answers can be given with one or twowords--offering more will not make any difference (besides more work foryou). If there is something more that I will need from any beta testingrequest, I will ask it in email.Do not post any beta testing requests.  All requests must be sent by emailto geoff@apple2.gs .  To ensure that I see the email in a timely manner,please make sure the subject includes "Project Delta Phi Beta TestRequest".  If you do not get a reply from me in one week, please do nothesitate to contact me at the same email address (geoff@apple2.gs) to querythe status of the request.  I will do my best if you meet thequalifications for beta testing Project Delta Phi.Beta Testers must have (or be able to do) the following:* A real working IIgs (an emulated GS is optional).* A modern computer running MacOS X or Windows 98 or higher.* A method to transfer files among the IIgs and the modern computer that is  known to work.* Ability to receive files via email and install such files on the real  IIgs.

In this article I would liketo look at the first year of publication of GEnieLamp A2, and at the sametime review the significant events in the Apple II world as they wererelated in the magazine.I also need to make a correction to one piece of information in that firstarticle. I had mentioned the unique position that GEnieLamp A2 and TheLamp! have as the only platform in the GEnieLamp series that is archived inits entirety and is available for download on the Internet. I credited RyanSuenaga for keeping the entire run available on a web site when the onlineservices (GEnie and Delphi) faded away. David Kerwood sent me an e-mail toreminded me that it was HIS A2-Web site that was originally the Internethost for the various editions of GEnieLamp (text, AppleWorks, HyperStudio,and HyperCard). David's site opened in April 1997 as a section on theoriginal Syndicomm.com web site, and continued to be a repository for theLamp publications until August 2001, when they were transferred over totheir current home at http://lamp.a2central.com/, where Ryan has currentlyarchived the collection. So, in addition to the others that I thanked forthe preservation of GEnieLamp A2 and A2Pro and The Lamp!, let me thankDavid Kerwood for the megabytes of storage that he allocated for them inthe past. (By the way, you can find A2-Web, "The Mother of All Apple II WebSites!" at its current home, http://www.wbwip.com/a2web/index.html).Now, let's light the Lamp and take a look at where we've been...YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFEIn the last article I discussed John Peters' efforts to create the firstGEnieLamp publication for the Atari ST Roundtable on GEnie, and how he wasasked to expand his efforts to involve additional platforms. The appearanceof GEnieLamp A2, GEnieLamp Mac, and GEnieLamp IBM on April 1, 1992 was thestart of this novel publishing effort. The "cover page" for that firstissue of GEnieLamp A2 (identified as "GEnie Lamp Apple ][") is reproducedbelow: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||     |||||| |||||| ||  || |||||| ||||||                                 ||     ||     ||     ||| ||   ||   ||                                     ||     || ||| ||||   ||||||   ||   ||||               Your                ||     ||  || ||     || |||   ||   ||                                     ||     |||||| |||||| ||  || |||||| ||||||             GEnie Lamp Apple ][ ||                                                                        ||     ||    |||||| ||    || ||||||                   RoundTable          ||     ||    ||  || |||  ||| ||  ||                                       ||     ||    |||||| |||||||| ||||||                   RESOURCE!           ||     ||    ||  || || || || ||                                           ||     ||||| ||  || ||    || ||                                           ||                                                                        ||                ~ APPLE RELEASES NEW SYSTEM SOFTWARE! ~                 ||                    ~ YOUR APPLE NEEDS A QUICKIE! ~                     ||                     ~ IIGS MULTITASKING?

In the case of the Apple II edition, A2 Roundtable member TomSchmitz was the selected connection. Schmitz, a resident of Hawaii,continued in that position for the first six issues, until the demands ofhis job made it necessary to relinquish that position to Darrel Raines.Raines had made several contributions to the newsletter, beginning with theAugust 1992 issue.As of the second issue, the masthead changed slightly to make Kent Fillmorethe publisher (recall that he was the computing roundtables manager who hadasked Peters to expand GEnieLamp beyond the Atari ST edition), and JohnPeters as Senior Editor. The name was also clarified to "GEnie Lamp A2", tobe more consistent with the name of the A2 Roundtable: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////|| GEnie Lamp A2    ~ A T/TalkNET OnLine Publication ~    Vol. 1, Issue 2 || """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ||   Publisher............................................Kent Fillmore   ||    Senior Editor........................................John Peters    ||     Co-Editor (A2).....................................Tom Schmitz     || GEnie Lamp ST ~ GEnie Lamp MAC ~  GEnie Lamp IBM ~ GEnie Lamp Apple ][ ||////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\||________________________________________________________________________|By the third issue, Tom Schmitz' title was elevated to that of Editor forthe A2 edition, and Phil Shapiro, who had contributed articles from thevery beginning, was listed as a Co-Editor. Also listed was an additionalGEnieLamp publication, "GEnie Lamp Elsewhere", which was designed torepresent news and activities on some of the less populated GEnie computingroundtables, "elsewhere" than Apple II, IBM, Macintosh, and Atari ST.With issue number 4 in July 1992, contributions from the A2Pro (Apple IIProgrammers) Roundtable were added, making the official title "GEnieLampA2/A2Pro". This combined A2 and A2Pro Roundtable coverage continued untilFebruary 1993, when the combined size of contributions from the twoRoundtables made it prudent to split off GEnieLamp A2Pro as a separatepublication.The "publisher" of GEnieLamp changed, as Kent Fillmore's name disappearedfrom the masthead, replaced by "GEnie Information Services". With theOctober 1992 issue, the space between "GEnie" and "Lamp" had been removed,and by the end of the year the GEnieLamp Elsewhere edition had disappeared,and GEnieLamp [PR] (which reproduced press releases from GEnie) andGEnieLamp MacPro had appeared on the masthead: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////|| GEnie Lamp A2/A2Pro ~ A T/TalkNET OnLine Publication ~  Vol.1, Issue 9 || """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ||  Publisher.................................GEnie Information Services  ||   Editor-In-Chief........................................John Peters   ||    Editor.............................................Darrel Raines    ||                                                                        ||   ~ GEnieLamp IBM ~ GEnieLamp [PR] ~ GEnieLamp TX2 ~ GEnieLamp ST ~    ||    ~ GEnieLamp MacPRO ~ GEnieLamp A2/A2Pro ~ GEnieLamp Macintosh ~     ||////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\||________________________________________________________________________|SHOW AND TELL: GENERAL CONTENT IN 1992John Peters designed the GEnieLamp series to have a pool of generalarticles that could be interesting for any of the represented platforms,and then have other platform-specific columns that would fill out theremainder of that newsletter. Also, an important part of each issue was thedistillation of postings from the Roundtable, which provided information,humor, or news. The template that he followed for most issues during thefirst year was to start with his editorial, include a note from TomSchmitz, then move on to top Apple II news, gleanings from postings on theA2 Roundtable, and finally various types of articles. Most of thesearticles were specific to the Apple II, but some were general enough toappeal to any computer user.In the first issue in April 1992, John started with his editorial, FROM MYDESKTOP, in which he described the expansion of the GEnieLamp conceptbeyond its beginnings in the Atari ST Roundtable, and welcomed the newplatforms, specifically Apple II, Macintosh, and IBM. He then moved on toreport on some Apple II-specific news, dealing with the latest release ofShrinkIT and GS-ShrinkIt, an announcement of the Apple II AchievementAwards, and a list of new uploads to the A2 library. His editorialconcluded by giving information about things going on elsewhere on GEnie,including upcoming events in the Desktop Publishing and the LaptopsRoundtables. The second part of FROM MY DESKTOP was a short introductionfrom Apple II editor Tom Schmitz, and it concluded with a message gleanedfrom the A2 RT bulletin board, in which Chief Sysop Chet Day announcing hisretirement from the Apple II Roundtables.Later issues of GEnieLamp A2 began with content that appeared to be generalenough to apply to all GEnieLamp editions. He introduced an additionalpublication, GEnieLamp Elsewhere, to give news about Roundtables other thanthe Atari ST, Apple II, Mac, and IBM). He also founded the GEnieLampRoundtable, an area on GEnie designed specifically for the GEnieLampnewsletters, and their writers and editors. To promote the newpublications, Peters even devised a "Computer Wars" contest to allowreaders to send in reasons why they thought THEIR computer was the best.Although the largest number of responses came from the Apple II readers,the winning computer was not an Apple II. In the September 1992 issue, thefirst place award went to a user whose essay described "the modem" as thebest computer (because it made any computer extensible to a largernetwork). Second place was awarded to the HP-15C Advanced ProgrammableScientific Calculator, and third place was the NeXT computer.During this first year of publication, Peters also introduced the DiskTopPublishing Association (later called the Desktop Publishing Association),to promote digital publications. He highlighted this further duringNovember 1992, which he and other DPA members designated as "ElectronicPublishing Month".To round out the newsletter and include some items that were fun, ASCII artmade its debut in the September 1992 issue, with Mike White (and otherartists) and CowTOONS, ASCII drawings of cows. Also introduced during thatfirst year were word find puzzles in the form of the "Search-Me!" column,which ran from July 1992 until late 1993.The HUMOR ONLINE column started with the first issue, and continued throughmost of the run of GEnieLamp A2. Titles of these stories included:Chocolate Layer Cake 1040; Shareware registration incentives that don'twork; Political Viruses; Fifty Ways To Hose Your Code (song parody); TheOyster; IBM's "Timeless" processor chip; Monty Python humor in the Amiga STRoundtable; the B*st*rd Operator From Hell; Apple vs IBM (pounding nailswith your head); and The Art of Flaming.APPLE II CONTENT IN 1992ROUNDTABLE NEWSWith the general success and acceptance of the GEnieLamp A2 newsletterduring its first few months, the July 1992 issue added news from the A2ProRoundtable. To promote participation in A2Pro, its Sysops used thisopportunity to announce a contest for creation of Finder Extensions for thenew System 6 software for the Apple IIGS. Later in the year they alsointroduced A2 University, a way to teach programming online.In the A2 RT, the departure of Chet Day (mentioned above) was followed bythe appointment of Dean Esmay as the new Chief Sysop. His new statusresulted in the privilege of being interviewed TWICE by GEnieLamp A2 during1992. One of the new efforts that was initiated by the A2 RT was theintroduction of the Lost Classics Project (which continues to this veryday, under different management). Headed by Tim Tobin, Lost Classics hadthe goal of preserving classic Apple II software, finished products and (ifpossible) source code. Its first major success was the release of AppleWriter 2.1 and GraFORTH from Paul Lutus.During the year, the 1991 GEnie Apple II User's Choice Awards and Apple IIAchievement Awards were announced.SOFTWARE NEWSOne of the important news stories reported during 1992 in GEnieLamp A2revolved around Apple's release of Apple IIGS System 6 and HyperCard IIGSv1.1, and prolific discussion of how to make use of its new features. Applealso gained points in the Apple II community with the announcement thatthey had agreed to license the Apple Programmers and Developers Association(APDA) catalog to Resource Central. In the midst of this good news fromApple was continued bad news in the form of rumors of Apple's impendingdiscontinuation of the Apple II lines of computers.Quality Computers gained status with its agreement to take over BeagleBros' Apple II products, allowing that company to concentrate in itsefforts to create Macintosh software.Joe Kohn began his long involvement with the A2 RT by announcing a contestto help finish the Free Tools Association (FTA) game "Bouncin' Ferno", andalso create levels for it. This contest would be held through inCidermagazine, in which his Shareware Solutions column ran each month.During this year there appeared some of the first efforts at creating anApple IIGS emulator (with a product under developed for 386/486 computers).Other new products introduced in GEnieLamp included the first release ofGNO/ME; Your Money Matters (financial software); CoPilot v2.0 (an offlinereader for GEnie); AppleNET 2.0 (BBS) and its associated ModemWorks 3.0package; and FantasyWorks (fantasy football league software).There was also a disappointing turn of events that occurred during theyear. Seven Hills Software dropped plans to publish a commercial version ofSoundSmith, a music design and playback program. This happened after atester broke his non-disclosure agreement and distributed a beta version toa friend, who then shared it with IIGS pirate community. As a result ofthis action the author, Huibert Aalbers, dropped completely out of theApple IIGS programming community.HARDWARE NEWSOn the hardware front, Western Design Center announced a new, faster 65816processor that would be capable of running at 14 MHz. Programmer "Burger"Bill Heineman's discussed his plans for Project Avatar, an effort to createan Apple IIGS compatible computer with off-the-shelf parts. This generateda lot of interest, but not much in terms of results.Several authors presented stories about hardware maintenance (Apple DMP andImageWriter I & II printer tuneup, and Disk II tuneup) and modifications(changing an HST-only modem to dual standard).KANSASFESTKansasFest (known also as the A2 Central Summer Conference) was, of course,a major focus of the late summer of 1992. Apple Computer announced thecoming of the MS-DOS FST and the System 6.0.1 update (described as "amaintenance release made necessary by the Apple II Ethernet Card"). BillHeineman's Avatar project was presented, and also released was Foundation,a complex resource editor for the Apple IIGS.REVIEWSProduct Reviews that appeared included the Quickie scanner and SupraFaxModem; Computer Keyboarding; Pointless; GSTape/HDTape; HyperStudio vsHyperCard IIGS; NoiseTracker, SoniqTracker, and MODzap; BBS software; thegames LetterSlide, Bouncin' Ferno, Eamon adventures, MineFields GS,and GEnie Online Chess; financial programs Your Money Matters and FinancialGeniuS; Big Text Machine; and review of the books "Modem USA" and "SharedMinds".INTERVIEWSApple II personalities who were interviewed during 1992 included Dean Esmay(twice), Karl Bunker, Matt Deatherage, Alan Bird, Gary Utter, Morgan Davis,and Randy Brandt.WRITERSMany different authors contributed to GEnieLamp in its first year. Theseincluded Larry Faust, Kent Fillmore, Udo Huth (of Germany), John Majka,Richard Vega, Roger Wagner, Steven Weyhrich (me), and Lorraine Wilson.  KenFranklin (of Milestone 2000 fame) had a one-time column called THE PROGRAMCLINIC in June 1992, to answer questions from readers (The concept waslater continued by members of the Apple II RT staff). Mike Westerfieldwrote about The Byte Works and what it had to offer the Apple II and IIGSprogrammer. Gary Utter commented about handling heat in your computer. AndPhil Shapiro started his long-running series discussing thoughts aboutvarious aspects of telecommunications.MISCELLANEOUS FEATURESA common feature of GEnieLamp was to list and sometimes review files thatwere uploaded to the GEnie A2 library. The first detailed listing of thistype was THE ONLINE LIBRARY, written by Richard Vega for the June 1992issue.Gleanings from posts on the Roundtable included fascinating stories aboutold mainframe computers; an attempt to organize Apple II users in theAlliance International, Inc (AII); the use of external power supplies forthe Apple IIGS; and Kent Fillmore's story and reminiscence aboutdiscontinuing his long-running Apple II BBS.Oh, and beginning with the June 1992 issue, GEnieLamp A2 reprinted thefirst chapter of my Apple II History (which ran continuously until July1994).PARTING WORDSThe Apple II world was still running strong and healthy during 1992. TheGEnie A2 and A2Pro Roundtables helped continue their promotion and supportof the platform, but the signs of strain were beginning to deepen. DespiteApple's still solid support of existing customers with the release of newsystem software and promises of other updates and hardware to come, thesigns of decline were still becoming apparent. The most painfulannouncement of all was to come in the last month of the year; however, itdid not get reported in GEnieLamp until the beginning of 1993, and so Iwill leave that for next time.Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.org[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[SSS]Syndicommotion Sent to Subscribers""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Syndicommotion Volume 2, Issue 3 (March 2003) has been sent to subscribers,and will be posted shortly to the web site.Not a subscriber?

Install the IIe card in the Mac.2. If you desire to have one or more ProDOS partitions on the Mac hard   drive:   a. Back up the data from the hard drive.   b. Prepare the hard drive using AppleHD SC Setup.  (There is a copy of      this software on the IIe Installer Disk).      1) Initialize the hard drive.      2) Partition the hard drive as desired.   c. Copy the Mac software and data back to the main HFS partition.3. Alternate plan... use an external hard drive with one or more ProDOS   partitions for your IIe software and data.4. Another Alternate plan... replace the hard drive on your Mac with a   drive having more capacity.   a. Install the 'new' hard drive in an external case, connect it to the      Mac, then prepare the drive as in 2. above.   b. Copy your Mac software and data to the 'new' drive.   c. Replace the internal drive on your Mac with the 'new' drive.5. Install the IIe software on the Mac HFS partition using the installer on   the IIe Installer Disk.6. Install the IIe software and data that you want to use on the ProDOS   partition(s).Using the 'IIe in a Mac'''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Open the Memory Control Panel on the Mac and turn 32-Bit Addressing off.2. Restart the Mac.3. Double click on the IIe Startup icon in the root directory of your Mac   startup drive.4.

Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 23, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 26 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.  However, entries may be described or discussed, includingscreen shots (where applicable), by the KFest committee for promotionalpurposes, or by legitimate Apple II community press.The following lists are not necessarily complete lists of everythingallowed; these are to be taken as "givens."  If it's not on the list,please ask for confirmation.Acceptable software:     System software     Development environment (no customizations)     GSBug     Nifty List     Marinetti     Exerciser     ORCA/Debugger, Splat!     DesignMaster, Foundation, Genesys, ResLin     Talking Tools     Spectrum, ProTERM, ANSITermAcceptable hardware:     Apple II computer, monitor, disk drives, hard drives     CD-ROM drive, tape drive     Hard disk controller card     Sound card (speakers/headphones/etc)     Accelerator card (any speed)     RAM cardAccepted reference material:     All official Apple reference materials (including     manuals, technical notes, and file type notes).     Reference manuals included with development tools     and software.     Commercially-available reference manuals.Any other hardware, software, or reference material needs the approval ofthe judges in advance.  When in doubt, ask the judges.This is the 'kfest' mailing list.
