There will be no hard rules and no winners will bedeclared... I'm more interested in getting people to do something otherthan talk about doing something.Here are the challenges:Creative Challenge==================Do something creative with a "retro" computer*. It can be anything:graphics, music, programming, hardware hacks... whatever floats your boat.Endurance Challenge===================(For hardcore retroputists only) See how long you can make exclusive use ofa "retro" computer. Just for personal use -- I don't expect anyone to lugan Apple III into the workplace. No complicated scoring, just see what youcan do... if you can't manage the whole month, shoot for a week.The challenge starts January 1st, 2007 and will run until the 31st. Anyonetaking up the challenge is welcomed to email me at bb065@chebucto.ns.ca,I'll keep up a running "progress report" and document all the entriesduring the first week of February.You can be involved in either challenge, or both. And please bear in mindthat it's not about WINNING, it's about PARTICIPATING.Simon WIlliams* For the sake of simplicity, a "retro" computer that is any computergenerally considered obsolete.

Typing it in works though.The telnet side will let you login as your user id number, alias or firstlast names then password.The HTTP side only accepts your alias and password.And when someone says A2Central web site... there are two "a2central"sites, the portal where the news is, and the BBS one. Being two completelydifferent sites, they have different passwords, and so I'm always wonderingwhich password someone reset, when they say they reset their a2central.compassword.  You either reset the portal password (where the news is) or thebbs (where we are now). Which one did you reset?I don't know anything about Thoth - never tried it. I authenticate usingThunderbird with zero problems. I'll look into Thoth though.(sfahey, a2c.community, Jan 01 2007)>>>>>""""">> After I set up my account back in November, the Web-side worked fine,but I was not able to log into the telnet side. <<No, you apparently had trouble with the verifier I had back then, which hassince been put out of my (our) collective misery.

I'd love to go back to the TonyWaccount once we figure out what's going on here.I don't think I have ever created an account on the news portal side.Everything I'm talking about here has to do with the Message Groups (BBS)account. I have never logged on via telnet, only via the web interface. Andwhen I say "copy and paste," what I mean is I typed out a random string ofletters and numbers in a word processor, copied it, and pasted it into thepassword fields when I changed the password. It just an easy way to makerandom passwords without worrying about typos.Anyway, the TonyW account worked fine on the web side while I was using thedefault password that you sent in email after I created the account. Iwanted to change that password, so I used the above copy and paste methodbut now I can no longer access the TonyW account (neither the old nor thenew password works.) That's why I'm using this (hopefully) temporary TonyW1account.Neither account works with Usenet. For this temporary account I'm using"TonyW1" as the name, and the default password that was sent to me inemail. Using Thoth I can see all the groups, I can see the message headers,but I cannot read the messages.Here are what should be the relevant entries from the Thoth log:M   01/01/2007 20:48:57  R 75.35.59.6 119 49235 200 A2Central.com News(Synchronet 3.13a-Win32 NNTP Service 1.91)M   01/01/2007 20:48:57  C 75.35.59.6 119 49235 authinfo user TonyW1M   01/01/2007 20:48:57  R 75.35.59.6 119 49235 381 More authenticationrequiredM   01/01/2007 20:48:57  C 75.35.59.6 119 49235 authinfo pass *******M   01/01/2007 20:48:57  R 75.35.59.6 119 49235 281 AuthenticationsuccessfulSo far so good.

Make sure you free thememory that you used for bufferRef after the TEGetText call.I think you will also prefer to have the dataFormat as unformatted text(%101) instead of LETextBox2 (%100).Your code will look like this (leaving the missing parts in quotes as anexercise to the reader): teTempHndl := "Allocate 4 bytes of memory" teTempPtr := "Dereference teTempHndl handle" lengthtTE := TEGetText($1D, teTempPtr, 0, 0, 0, @myTEHandle); teTextPtr := "dereference handle stored at teTempPtr" "save text at teTextPtr with length lengthtT" "free handle created by TEGetText" "free teTempHndl" You may find it easier to write the code where you pull the charcount fromteGetTextInfo, allocate your own handle for the text, and do lengthtTE :=TEGetText($D, myTextHandle, 0, 0, 0, @myTEHandle);There is less dereferencing and less memory allocating/freeing, reducingcode complexity.

If adirectory is highlighted, the entire contents will be sent or received, andany further subdirectories down the chain will also be sent or received.If you delete a directory from either the home or the away folder, anyenclosed hierarchical directories, and their contents will also be deleted.Optional AppleSingle encoding while uploading is now supported. Thispreserves file and auxtypes, dates, and resource forks.Optional automatic decoding of AppleSingle, BinSCII, Binary II, BinHEX 4.0,MacBinary, UUencode, and Base64 (MIME) files is now supported.Bug fixes in 2.1.2:The 'empty directory' problem is now fixed. All known hosts now respondcorrectly.A number of other bugs have been fixed, and some interface tweaks have beenmade.(Speccie, a2c.software, Dec 22 2006)[EOA][DBO]DiskMaker 8 Web Site Back Online""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""DiskMaker 8's web site is back online.

With that in place, any application on theemulated IIgs that knows about Marinetti, would be able to talk to theoutside world.I know Sheppy has thought about this, and has it on his 'wish list'. Weshall all have to be patient till he can find time to get round to it.It is one of the features I would love, as it would mean there would be noneed for me to transfer code to a real IIgs, and would speed up developmentfor me dramatically.As all my working Macs run OS 9.0 in Classic mode, and have no floppy diskdrives, or active serial ports, it was the need to transfer assembled filesfrom a Mac to a real IIgs, that was the spur for me to create SAFE2.However, a direct serial card equivalent for Sweet16, to allow access tothe dialup routines within OS X, would allow those who do not have a LAN orDSL, to also go online. In my book, that is not as important a function asMarinetti support.Ewen(Speccie, a2c.network_telecomm, Jan 12 2007)>>>>>"""""HI Ewen,If Eric was to implement the cs8900a interface in the emulator like I havein AppleWin then the existing LL driver already developed <grin> could beused as is ....

It would indeed save writing a new LinkLayer, but would add one more step to getting the data in and out.In any case, it should only be a matter of adapting existing code, such asthe Uthernet Link Layer, to address a virtual port, which then interfaceswith the Ethernet routines in OS X.As I have no experience of working with OS X at that level, I leave toSheppy's superior knowledge to decide how best it should be done...Ewen(Speccie, a2c.network_telecomm, Jan 12 2007)[EOA][SFA]65816 Assemblers?"""""""""""""""""How many native 816 assemblers are there?Offhand, I know of:Orca/APWMerlinLisa 816NinjaForce AssemblerQuickAsm (never released?)Micol Macro AssemblerAre there any others?

(There is one remix from Out Of This World though.  Iassume the music was in the IIgs version, I don't recall for sure).I converted the music from The Immortal to MIDI format, but it was so busyand the original samples might not have been tuned correctly, so it doesn'tsound too good.  I took a couple stabs at doing a remix of it, but I didn'tlike the way it turned out.I had better luck making midi files of the Pirates! music (here -http://ksherlock.com/pirates/).

Mind you, while there are no specific Apple II remixes to be foundon the OCR site, you _will_ find some familiar remixes here and there fromgames in common from other platforms, e.g.: Marble Madness, Rastan, GrandPrix Challenge, Test Drive II, Lemmings, Ancient Land of Y's, Skate or Die,Space Harrier, Paperboy to name some.Here's one example you might recognize:http://remix.kwed.org/?search_id=2198I converted the end theme from Karateka (8-bit Apple II) into a MIDI file,which sounded nice but I need to clean it up and do something with it. Alsowas toying with the idea of doing some remixes for Thexder on the IIgs(it'd be perfect for a techno remix!), Tass Times, Winter Games, and AlienMind. I was thinking of the Alien Mind theme of a few months back and did asort of music doddling/experimenting...sort of an idea for a possible remixI guess.
