Specifically,I was trying the file "gus.8.paug.bxy", and "rtc,orca2.bxy".Also, I remember the BQY suffix, but can't remember what program is neededto unpack it. ShrinkIt doesn't seem to recognize it (at least as a Shrunkfile).Thanks,Steven Weyhrich <IX0YE>--<Apple II Historyhttp://apple2history.org(A2HISTORY, Cat 2, Top 9, Msg 31)>>>>>"""""Using my Mac, I just verified that both of those files are fine. Idownloaded them via ftp with Transmit, moved them over to Bernie, andunpacked them with GSHK. I was also able to unpack them with Shrink II.Usually when people ask about corrupted files it turns out to be that theywere not getting an 8-bit ftp transfer.

A 56k modem will work in any country, andyou can take your PowerBook with you when you go.In the early days of 300 baud, for those that remember, there weredifferences in the tones used, but now they have been harmonized.Repeat dialing has to be controlled in the UK. You can dial the same numberagain at once, but thereafter, an increasing interval between dialing mustbe applied.As 240 volts power is used in most other countries, modems have to conformto strict safety regulations so they cannot send 240 volts down the phoneline.

This includes the JVM (JavaVirtual Machine) which runs the core language syntax (for/next loops,variable management etc.), plus a whole heap of Java code (libraries). Mostnew Java versions don't change the JVM, which means the core languagepretty much stays the same. What each version does add, is more and moreJava code that makes complex programming easier.This is a good thing, because it means the 10 lines of code you had towrite for the previous version, comes down to only a few lines of code inthe new version.Florence doesn't use anything complex within Java, just the basic languagesyntax and a few graphics routines. Again, because I haven't tuned it forperformance, it's very compatible across platforms and JRE versions,because it doesn't really use much outside the basic JVM.Therefore, if a device did come out that didn't support the full 1.3.1,then it would more than likely still work, and if not, shouldn't be toomuch of a change to get Florence to get it to work (i.e. I'd just have towrite those 10 lines instead of 1 :-).The only real concern I would have for small device is speed. As myupcoming Juiced.GS article explains (blatant plug!), it is slow on thefastest Macs, let alone on a handheld. But you can read up on that when themagazine comes out. :-)What I am really waiting for is the Java Games Platform, or whatever thelatest acronym is. This is supposed to be super fast, and tuned forgraphics performance. The reason Florence is so slow, is mainly because ofJava's graphics libraries. They're built to support multiple platforms, sothey're not entirely high performance technology!Regards, Richard(RICHARDB, Cat 29, Top 33, Msg 21)[EOA][FTA]FILE TYPE ASSIGNMENT - Adobe Acrobat DOCUMENT"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""For future reference:Major Category==============Filetype          Category--------          --------$54               Desktop PublishingSpecific Assignment===================Filetype          Auxiliary Type          Finder Name--------          --------------          -----------$54               $0080                   Adobe Acrobat documentRyan(A2.RYAN, Cat 60, Top 3, Msg 28)[EOA]------------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA]------------------------------------      DISTILLATIONS FROM DELPHI A2 |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[NAT]NEW TO THE Apple II - HAVE QUESTIONS""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hi,I am new to the Apple community. I am a classic computer and video gamecollector. Back in the early 80's I always wanted an Apple IIe. That wasthe first system I was taught on in Junior Highschool. I eventually got aCommodore 64 and never entered the world of the Apple II's. :( Today I justwon an Apple IIgs ROM03 system and I'm very anxious to start using it onceit arrives. I have some questions and hope some of you might be able toanswer them.1. I have many Apple II images on my PC network. I want to be able totransfer those images back to Apple IIgs floppies. I'm currently lookingfor the best way to accomplish this.I've read about the PC Transporter and the Bluedisk card, but recently Istumbled upon an item called a Super Disk. Can anyone out there tell me:1a. What do I need to run this Super Disk on a IIgs ROM 03 1 MEG RAM? Do Ineed some sort of add-on card and then a Super Disk? Is there any specialtype I need?1b.

Incidentally you should know there's not much Apple II activityremaining here on Delphi. You can find most of us either on Usenet'scomp.sys.apple2 newsgroup (free) or Syndicomm's A2Central forum (payservice). In the meantime, you can still find some help here, though youmay find it sparse.>> I am a classic computer and video game collector. <<I've mostly collected vintage Apple systems, though in the last few years Istarted collecting other computers and game consoles too (heh, as a matterof fact, just this afternoon I picked up a ColecoVision and Intellivisionby chance).>> Back in the early 80's I always wanted an Apple IIe. That was the firstsystem I was taught on in Junior Highschool. I eventually got a Commodore64 and never entered the world of the Apple II's. :( <<Funny, I had mostly the same start but with the opposite outcome. I endedup with an Apple II Plus just before junior high school and missed out onthe Commodore 64 (I don't _at all_ regret the path I took starting out withthe Apple II, but I recently sought out a working C64 and meaning toexplore what I missed out on).>> Today I just won an Apple IIgs ROM03 system and I'm very anxious tostart using it once it arrives. I have some questions and hope some of youmight be able to answer them. <<You should know while the IIgs is backwards compatible with the 8-bitApple II in emulation-mode (which works quite transparently as you'll soonsee) it has a native side that makes it very similar to the Amiga. Thatreminds me of another machine I'd like to go back and explore, I have someA500's and 2000's in various states sitting around here but missing a pieceor two to get them running. Anyhow, I'm seem to be digressing from yourquestions, so....>> A) What do I need to run this Super Disk on a IIgs ROM 03 1 MEG RAM? DoI need some sort of add-on card and then a Super Disk? Is there any specialtype I need? <<You must mean the "SuperDrive" option. It's merely an external 1.44MBfloppy drive setup that can handle both GCR (Apple) and MFM (DOS/Windows)formatted 3.5 diskettes.You can use an official Apple SuperDrive or some of the third partycompatibles out there (i.e. Applied Engineering, AMR). A popular option isto take the standard Apple 3.5 drive and swap the 800K mechanism with a1.44MB one pulled from an old Macintosh--it's a pretty trivial upgraderequiring only a screwdriver really. I have two "SuperDrives" which aremerely standard Apple 3.5 drives I self-upgraded.The catch is, yes, you'll need an add-on card so the IIgs can recognize itas a high-density drive and read/write IBM floppies. The card is called the"Apple II 3.5 Disk Controller Card". They're not very common but ShervesSystems was selling them not too long ago.>> B) I was a bit confused with the PC Transporter. I read briefly in onelocation that it put a full Apple IIe in your PC, but on another site itseems that the Transporter is for the IIs to run MFM Floppies.It's neither exactly. It's a 50-pin slot card that plugs into the Apple II(II Plus, IIe and IIgs) and hardware emulates an IBM XT class PC.Specifically a fast 8086-compatible (NEC V30) with 640K, CGA and supportfor PC-MFM drives--or even allow a standard Apple 800K drive to read/write720K MFM floppies in IBM mode if attached to the PC-Transporter. It'll alsowork with the SuperDrive if you have that special controller card, but atthat point you're better off using GS/OS's built-in MSDOS FST (File SystemTranslator; an FST lets the IIgs's OS see foreign formatted devices as ifthey were Apple formatted). >> Either way can anyone tell me the most efficient way to transfer theapple images from a PC back to a IIgs readable floppy? Also, I know aboutthe null modem cable concept, but that won't work as I don't have a PC inthe same room as my classic systems. <<I personally prefer the SuperDrive option. I just use my PIII to downloaddisk-images or files onto floppy, then pop the disk into my GS and it readsit just like that. It's a god-send considering I no longer have my IIgsconnected to the Internet.I had only used a null-modem hook up for transferring files larger than1.4M (it works nicely actually since the GS can handle 57.6K through theserial port) though these days I use an IOmega Zip disk (I have an externalZip on the GS, and an internal on a P133 in another room). Ethernet isanother option as of recently, but the card is rather expensive.Oh, if you have a Macintosh in your collection, you can use that as abridge between a IIgs and PC for floppy transfers (MSDOS->HFS->ProDOS).Older Macintosh machines can read 1.44MB MSDOS and write to 800K ProDOSdisks. They can also do AppleTalk networking with the IIgs (i.e.PC/Ethernet->Mac/Ethernet-Mac/AppleTalk->GS/AppleTalk)>> 2. SCSI Hard Drives. Is there any specific type of SCSI hard drives Ineed to get to install on my IIgs? <<No, most SCSI drives should work fine (I'd just recommend at least a 4500RPM drive).What you do need to seek out specifically is an Apple II SCSI-based slotcard. Apple made two (one DMA, one non-DMA) and even more popular is the"RamFAST SCSI" controller. Unfortunately these cards are in high demandamong users so it may be pricey to get a hold of one.>> Also, do I need special brackets to mount it inside the unit or doexternal SCSI Hard Drives only work with a IIgs? <<External SCSI drives have always been more common for the IIgs and whatyou'd be likely to use. There WERE internal drive setups though, in factthe IIgs sitting beside me has a 240MB drive mounted internally using aproduct called the Pegasus (another rarity). I've been meaning to replacethe mechanism with a 1.2GB since the older 240 drive seems to be failingand a bit small for my own needs.>> 2a. Is there a hard card that plugs into any of the IIgs slots? I hadan old hard card for my first PC and was curious to know if <<Yep. There are two IDE-based HardCards, one sold in the US (Alltech) andthe other sold in Europe (SHH Systemes). I believe the Alltech FocusHardCard is more affordable, have a look at: www.allelec.com>> there may be a SCSI hard card for the IIgs? <<No, but there was the RoadRunner card. It let you mount a 3.5 SCSI drive ona slot card that then connected to a standard SCSI controller (Apple orRamFAST) in an adjacent slot. It was the same concept as using an externalSCSI drive, except the drive drew its power from the GS's powersupply andlived inside the case. A sort of pseudo HardCard I suppose.>> 3. Is there a nice laser printer that anyone can recommend that willwork with the IIgs? <<Several work will work (a parallel card may be required if it doesn'tsupport serial) though you'd definitely want a software driver packagecalled "Harmonie". A couple of years back I successfully had the GSprinting off my brother's Hewlett Packard LaserJet 5L printer. The IIgsalso supports TrueType font technology with a package called "Pointless".I believe Shareware Solutions II carries both pieces of software.>> 4. Is there any preferable joystick to get to use with IIgs games? <<It's a matter of choice. My favorite is the CH Products Mach III joystick.I have several others (e.g. Epyx, Gravis, Apple) and I can't say I everliked those much. The official Apple-brand joystick is quite awful in manyrespects btw, avoid it if possible.Speaking of games, you may want to visit the Apple IIGS Gaming MemoryFairway (http://www.inwards.com/~fairway). As usual, I should state mydisclaimer that I feel the site is valuable as an Apple IIgs museum(memorabilia, screen shots, reviews, articles) rather than a softwarearchive site. I've spent a good number of hours just reading reviews andgetting nostalgic looking at scanned GS advertisements. :)If you're new to the IIgs and wondering what the machine was all about,I can't think of anything more perfect to read than Alex Lee's commentaryon the IIgs: http://www.inwards.com/~fairway/intro.htmlAnother two must-visit sites as far as the IIgs is concerned btw:www.a2central.comwww.ninjaforce.com>> Well, I guess that is all for now.

One way toget this software to your computer is to equip your IIgs with a CD ROMdrive.This project is made easier by the fact that there really is a lot ofstandardization of the necessary connections among the various SCSI drivesand the enclosures.  The power connectors and the SCSI cable connectors aredesigned so the can only be connected one way.What You Will Need''''''''''''''''''1. An enclosure (case).  The ideal one has a built in power supply andcooling fan.  The front of the CD ROM mechanism will need to be accessibleto the outside of the case.  Depending on the enclosure available, thismight require some ingenuity.  The old SyQuest 44 and 88 removable mediadrives are an excellent source of an enclosure for this project.  After theSyQuest mechanism has been removed the CD ROM mechanism can be neatlymounted flush with the front of the case.2. The CD ROM drive mechanism.  These can be found in some of the older,unwanted Mac computers.3. SCSI cables.  One to connect the SCSI card in your computer to theconnector on the enclosure.  Another one to connect the first case to thesecond case if you plan to have more than one drive connected at the sametime.4. A terminator might be necessary if there is no provision for terminationon the drive itself.5. A SCSI card.Where to Get What You Need''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Thrift stores.2.

Other World Computer <http://www.macsales.com/">9. Mac-Res-Q <http:/www.macresq.com> or call 1-888-447-3728Installing the Drive in the Enclosure''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Open the case.2. Disconnect and remove the old drive.  Make notes of connections for the   SCSI id control and the activity light.3. Mount the new drive securely within the case.4. Connect the power cable and the SCSI cable.  The connectors are built so   can they only be connected one way.5. Connect the SCSI id system if it will fit.  Otherwise set the SCSI id of   the drive using jumpers.  (See the section on SCSI id).6. Connect the activity light.  (The drive will work just fine even if you   can not make this connection).7. Close the case.Using the 'New' CD ROM Drive''''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Using your System 6.01 installation disks...    a. Install the CD ROM Driver.    b. Install the HFS FST.    c. Patch the HFS FST.   (Downloaded link:)       http://ground.ecn.uiowa.edu/apple2/apple16/System/FSTs/PATCHHFS.SHK2. Connect the drive to the SCSI card using the appropriate cable.3. Boot your IIgs... your CD ROM drive is ready to use.Rules For the SCSI Chain''''''''''''''''''''''''1. The chain must have term power.     a. The RamFast SCSI card can provide term power by setting a switch.     b. The Apple HS and Rev.C SCSI cards do not supply term power but can        be modified to do so.             To modify the Apple SCSI cards to provide term power see:                  http://ground.ecn.uiowa.edu/apple2/Docs/hispeed.gif                  http://ground.ecn.uiowa.edu/apple2/Docs/revc.gif     c. Some drives supply term power to the SCSI chain.2. Termination... The device (hard drive, CD ROM drive, etc.) at each end   of the chain must be terminated.     a. The RamFast and Apple HS SCSI cards are terminated.     b. The Apple Rev.C card is not terminated.  It can be terminated by        placing a 'pass through' terminator between the card and the first        SCSI device.     c. Some drives are terminated internally.  Some drives control        internal termination with a jumper.  Some drives have a switch        outside the case to turn termination on or off.  A drive that is        not terminated internally can be terminated externally by        installing a terminator on one of the SCSI connectors on the        outside of the case.3. NOTE... term power and termination are two different things.  Each must   be dealt with separately according to the appropriate rule.4. Each device in the chain must have a unique SCSI id.  SCSI id's range   from 0 through 7.     a. When using the Apple HS and Rev.C SCSI cards id 7 is reserved for        the use of the card.     b. The RamFast SCSI card operates without a SCSI id.5. Setting the SCSI id of a hard drive or CD ROM drive.     a. Most enclosures (cases) have a device outside the case to set the        SCSI id of the drive.  If you are installing a drive in a new or        used case you might or might not be able to properly connect the        drive to the external id switch.     b. If you can not properly connect the drive to this switch you can        control the SCSI id of the drive using jumpers.  You can often find        out how to do this for a given drive by visiting the web site of        the manufacturer of that drive.             See: "Controlling the SCSI ID of Hard Drive" in TLMP0201             At: http://lamp.a2central.com/Example SCSI Chain''''''''''''''''''Apple HS SCSI card    SCSI id=7   TerminatedSCSI cableCD ROM drive          SCSI id=0   Not terminatedSCSI cableHard drive            SCSI id=6External terminator               Terminates the hard drive[EOA]------------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------[NLE]NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA][LTE]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]------------------------------                       KFest 2002 |-----------------------------------[KFR]KFest REMINDER""""""""""""""There is a lot of kid in going to Kfest, no doubt.  I always bring projectsmost of which I don't get done.  I wish it had rained earlier in the week,so temperature would go down.  But not on Wednesday.  This was a warm year,not truly hot.  There was one year when leaving the window open was great!Not this year.I have not written my review of Kfest yet, the muse has not struck.  Cansomeone help me get started by reminding me of important facts?  I thinkthat might help me get of the dime.  Last year it just burning inside and Icould hardly keep it in.  This year the pictures were where most of myenergy went.  I still need to completely finish the spread, sadly.  I needto get a new ftp program I guess.  <<sigh>>Bruce(BBAKER, Cat 5, Top 5, Msg 9)>>>>>"""""Bruce,Will start you off by reminding you how wonderful it is that we can all gettogether and see each other every year at KFest:)  Everyone just assumesKFest will happen every year. That is not so. KFest happens because there'senough interest to make it happen and permit us to get together. In otherwords, KFest happens because of those who attend/support KFest. It's stillthe attendees that are responsible for KFest every year, although there areincredible contributions by many that can't attend but want to add whatthey can and be a part of the yearly gathering.Like always, there were significant highlights (at least for me) besidesseeing everyone able to attend.  Among them:1. Hmm. Number 1 again is the camaraderie and help from all who were able   to attend. We always have one very special group at KFest!2. Syndicomm support and the Softdisk announcement. Sheppy just seems to   have more energy than I'll ever be able to muster in support of KFest.3. A major highlight every year is the newbies and I wasn't disappointed to   see the "new members" who attended this year! I know better than to feel   they are newbies. They may be new to KFest but they've always been   experienced users who have added to everyone's enjoyment, and hopefully   will return in coming years to continue the sharing of information that   is such a big part of KFest.4. I'd like to mention Shawn Beattie once again. He's provided the   projector for years now and has only been to ONE KFest:(  Maybe you   could mention something in your review that would get him to attend next   year:)5. Ditto for Jerry Cline. Jerry couldn't make it this year and we missed   him. Although he couldn't attend, he's done outstanding work for KFest   again this year and was a tremendous help to all of us.6. Not sure how you can fit this in, but Sean is a new Dad and we learned   about that special event at KFest. Maybe you could handle that as I did   and note how happy we all were to welcome a new addition to our "KFest   Family":)  Somehow I think you understand what I mean and why that was   an important event for us.7. The BBQ! A thought that blossomed. Thanks to Ryan and Kirk, especially,   for making this happen, and happen so well! It's probably going become   a tradition at KFest after the wonderful experience we had this year.   Will be difficult to relate to anyone who hasn't attended KFest, but a   lot of the "allure" of KFest is hard to explain to anyone who hasn't   been there and experienced it in person;)Hope that gets you started:)  It's all "off the top of my head" and Ihaven't mentioned all the wonderful contributions made by each and everyattendee this year.Great KFest again; looking forward to next year,Steve(KFESTSTEVE, Cat 5, Top 5, Msg 11)[EOA][PFK]PICTURES FROM KFest 2002""""""""""""""""""""""""OK, the almost final online edition of my photos of kfest is ready.This is the final beta.  (Does that sound right?)www.hal-pc.org/~bbaker/kfest2002.htmlcaptions, where there are some, are embedded in the alt tag so if you holdthe mouse over the picture the caption should appear.This must be close to 100 pictures, I did not count.   Feel free to usethem with attribution.  Thanks.Breaking most cameramen's rule, my picture actually does appear a fewtimes.  Of course I got to pose for my pictures, most of the rest of youdidn't get that advantage. hehehe  But most of you look natural and that isnice, really.EnjoyBruce Baker(BBAKER, Cat 5, Top 5, Msg 16)[EOA][KFT]------------------------------                       KFest 2003 |-----------------------------------[PBT]KFest 2003 - PLAN TO BE THERE!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KansasFest 2003 is planned for July 22-27, 2003 at Avila University inKansas City, Missouri.(Entrance banner, Cat 5, Top 5)[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
