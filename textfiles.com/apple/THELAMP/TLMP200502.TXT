Mark Percival has written an easy-to-use BASICprogram that will change these digits from "19" to "20" for proper datedisplay.  Place the BASIC file EZUPDATER in the same subdirectory as theEASYDRIVE bin program and then run the BASIC file.  (You may want to savethe original file as ORIG.EASYDRIVE just in case.)  From that point on, thedate bar at the top of the menu will display the proper date.  Note thatthis patch is only good for this century, so if you're going to be usingyour Apple II and EasyDrive 95 years from now, a new patch program will benecessary.Please note that the EasyDrive software must be distributed in it'soriginal form, and the date code must be altered by the end-user.

I'vesuggested to the faculty that the teachers "switch" for a day - forexample, the math teacher teach physics, the physics teacher teachhumanities, etc.I would like to teach computer science, and draw on my Apple II backgroundto expose today's youth to that machine and its environment.  But how to doso?  The school has multiple PCs available, but I cannot legally copy myIIgs's ROM to each one to run emulators.  What Apple-related activity can Iintroduce to the kids using Windows machines?There is a Windows version of the text-based game "Adventure" available at<http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/e_downloads.html>, but that's not inthe school's spirit of barring game-playing on school computers.Thoughts?-Ken(KGAGNE, Cat 6, Top 7, Msg 1)>>>>>"""""Although I can't quote any resources for you to refer to, I've seen morethan one comment noting that the "adventure" game format has genuineeducational merit, particularly the earlier text-based versions.In the case of the original Colossal Cave adventure, I think you could makea strong case for presenting it in an educational setting. (Obviously thebig concern would be limiting the amount of time spent on the purelyentertainment side of it.)The program was ground breaking in many ways. It was huge! It had earlytext compression and interpreter-based design. It had one of the firstpublicly available "language parsers" (primitive and all as it was). Thetext was rich and complex, with roots in the Tolkien tradition. It requiredthe user to think laterally and make connections - which should be a"subject" taught in all schools!On the other hand, the Apple II implementation was just one of many, so I'mnot sure how well it fits with your plans there.Peter               peterw@syndicomm.comPalm OS Community Bulletin Board Manager(PETERW, Cat 6, Top 7, Msg 2)>>>>>"""""Peter,I think I'll need to think laterally myself in order to teach a class I'dlike to teach.

The way the school works, I gotto teach the computer science class four times throughout the day, and eachone went more smoothly.I started with some history of the software and hardware, listing how manykilobytes various media are (hard drives, DVDs, CDs, floppies), and showingthat VisiCalc was smaller than today's FoxTrot comic strip.  The studentslacked perspective on some matters; after I showed that VisiCalc was 22K, Iasked how much memory the computer it was for had.  16MB was a commonguess.  They were rather stunned that it was only 16K!"VisiCalc shipped for the Apple II, a machine created by what two people?"I asked.  The students responded quickly with "Steve Jobs", but had neverheard of the other guy, even after I gave his name.  I quickly incorporatedsome KFest pictures into the lesson after that. (They'd never heard ofVisiCalc either; several students guessed the first spreadsheet programever was Excel!)I then assigned this exercise:1. A standard checkbook ledger looks like this:Check #   Date  Description    Deposit    Payment       Balance---------------------------------------------------------------                                                         40,000250       1/31  WPI                        22,000       -22,000                tuition                                  18,000          2/01  deposit         1,984                     1,984                tax refund                               19,984Create a sample checkbook ledger with at least four expenses, two deposits,and one ATM withdrawal.As they progressed through the assignment, I also had them left justify theCheck column, apply a currency format to the Balance column, and lock thefirst row as a title.I predicted the trouble the students would have with the program - nomouse, no menu bars, etc.  One girl apparently confused the Blank and Clearcommands, and erased her entire spreadsheet (this, of course, being before"Undo" commands!).  But I hadn't anticipated the trouble they would havewith the mathematics.  Most of these students are too young to have theirown checkbooks, and a few needed some help to understand that Balance =Previous Balance + Deposit - Payment, and how to represent that using cellvalues.  I'd preceded the exercise with demonstrating that paperspreadsheets don't automatically recalculate their cells, which is why acomputer made things so much easier in 1979.  But some students manuallyentered all their numbers, which of course resulted in the spreadsheet notupdating when I tested it by changing the deposit and payment values.Other students created a balance column that acknowledged either a depositor a payment, depending on which one they'd entered; that failed when Ichanged the deposit to a payment. ("But you can't have both!" they'd say;"I don't care, and neither does the balance column.  It should be preparedfor anything you throw at it.")I expected the students to spend 30 minutes on the exercise before movingon to their homework, but many used all 45 minutes and even then someweren't finished.  (I also challenged the students to determine the quitcommand - no, not "Q", but "/SQY".  How obtuse! :)Some students didn't see any relevance to this exercise, and one girl who'shad a bad week (academically) was nearly in tears, saying "This is beyondme!"  But two students grasped this program very quickly, distinguishedbetween values and labels, and applied some very elegant equations andformula.  I'm not sure if these are kids who grew up with Lotus 1-2-3 ornot.   :)An interesting and surprising exercise.  I'm not sure if they learned moreabout the history of technology, how to use a spreadsheet, or basicmathematics and logical thinking.  I just hope they learned something.Thanks for the help and suggestions, everyone!

A word ofexplanation may be in order, for those that have not played the game:In Panzer General, and its sibling games, when you click on a unit on yourmap, all the hexes to which you can move (limited by movement points vs.terrain costs) are shaded. You then just click on the desired shaded hex,and the unit moves there.I'm trying to duplicate that point and click interface, but have a problemwith the algorithm for figuring out which hexes should be shaded.  Thecomplication is in the fact that different hexes have different movementcosts associated with them, so it's not as simple as just counting out Xhexes from the current one.I've found descriptions of algorithms for finding the shortest path fromone given point to another, and for figuring out how many movement pointsit would take to get there, but not one for figuring out how far you canget with a fixed number of movement points.The algorithm has to be doable in either Basic or C.   Can anyone give meany hints, or point me to a website that has such a description?Thanks._________  | homas(TCOMPTER, Cat 55, Top 2, Msg 1)>>>>>"""""If you're willing to forgo a number of color options, you could dosomething sneaky:Set your palette so that you have several color table entries that all looklike your background color.  Use each color in such a way that no two tilesthat share an edge have the same color.Then when there's a click, you can figure out the general area in which theclick occurred based on the cursor position and the radius of the tiles,then you can look at the pixel at the cursor position to tell which tilewas clicked.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 55,  Topic 2, Msg 2)>>>>>"""""I would go for a recursive approach.  Starting from your initial square(hex), recurse on all adjacent squares, decrementing the movement cost,until you can't move any more.  If it's a valid square, hilite it (or storeit in an array or whatever).eg psuedocode:CheckSquare(int x, int y, int movesLeft){  // verify valid coordinates.  if (x < 0 || x > MAX_X) return;  if (y < 0 || y > MAX_Y) return;  moveCost = .... // determine how many moves are required.  // hilite the square since we know it's valid.  HiliteHex(x,y);  movesLeft -= moveCost;  if (movesLeft <= 0) return; // can't move further  // now check all adjacent squares.  CheckSquare(x + 1, y, movesLeft);  CheckSquare(x + 1, y + 1, movesLeft);  CheckSquare(x + 1, y - 1, movesLeft);  CheckSquare(x - 1, y, movesLeft);  CheckSquare(x - 1, y + 1, movesLeft);  CheckSquare(x - 1, y - 1, movesLeft);  CheckSquare(x, y + 1, movesLeft);  CheckSquare(x, y - 1, movesLeft);}That's the general idea.  I'm assuming your lined up as such:* * ** o ** * *and can move from the center to any of the 8 surrounding squares.  Adjustthe recursion if not.Kelvin(KWS, Cat 55, Top 2, Msg 3)>>>>>"""""I really like Kevin's recursion suggestion since I wouldn't have thought ofthat (and it is very obvious that it will work).
