KansasFest 1999 is fastapproaching.  And this summer, like every other since 1995, I'll be there.     It didn't look like I'd make it to celebrate the Apple II's EndlessSummer of Love this year.  There was a plan for me to be over in SouthernCalifornia this year a few weeks after KFest and there was really no wayfor me to be at both.  I didn't have the vacation time and no way could Iafford it either.     Fortunately (and unfortunately, as well), things worked out (ordidn't).  I won't be in Southern Cal this year, but I will be in KansasCity.  I don't know many people who would prefer going to Kansas City inthe heat of July to Los Angeles.  But one thing's for sure.     It would have to be an Apple II kind of guy.     Here we come, Kansas City.                                [*] [*] [*]     Would You Care To Buy This Flower Department: One of the things Iwould like that I haven't had since we moved the show on over to Delphi hasbeen a steady stream of contributions from other writers.  I've talkedabout this before in this column.     That must've done some good.  This month we have contributions fromtwo writers.  The first is from Tee Cashmore, who joins us from Canada,where he shares with us a piece that was originally printed in a user grouppublication a few years ago--while some of the information is dated (forinstance, Applied Engineering was still in business then), it's stillvaluable for many of you out there.  In fact, these older articles are sovaluable that I'm starting a new semi-regular column, called "The Way WeWere", just to give them a special place.     The second is a writer well known around these parts.  Doug Cuff,formerly the editor of _GenieLamp A2_ as well as _A2-Central_ and _IIAlive_, joins us once again for his yearly update to his article taking youthrough preparations for the Apple II event of the year, KansasFest.     Speaking of, have you registered yet?     Not to take any focus off of what Tee and Doug have done this month.Thank you both.  For everything.                                [*] [*] [*]     Waited For Someone Faithful And True Department: Here's your monthlyBlatant Plug.

So, allyou really need to know in order to support spell checking directly in yoursoftware is, hopefully, included in the IPC call list info for NiftySpell.Of course, that info will make no sense at all to a non-programmer.So, if you're working on any GS/OS software, drop me an e-mail and I'llsend you the IPC call list.Joe Kohn(After typing this message in COG3, I hit the Queue button and a spellcheck was automagically performed.

You may have the "AE 3.5"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Drive for MacintoshComputers". I have one of these drives. If you still have the sticker onthe bottom it will have the above quoted name on it. This drive is a'clone' of the Apple FDHD external drive. It will not work as a 1.6MB driveand will only work as a 1.44MB drive if used on a Mac or on a IIgs/IIe witha SuperDrive Controller card.If in fact you have this drive and are hooking it up to the built-in IIgsdrive connector then you indeed would only get 800K (and 400K!?, I can'trecall seeing this option!) formatting options within the Finder.So, if your AE drive has lost its label, you could try hooking it up to aMac which has an external floppy connector and see if you can read/write1.44MB disks. This would help confirm that it is the 1.44MB drive and notthe 1.6MB drive.Paul.Paul Schultzschultp@delphi.comsent your way via Spectrum 2.2 and Crock O' Gold 3.0!                        (SCHULTP, 23072, GO COM A2)>>>>>   My AE drive says 'AE 3.5" Disk Drive High Density' on the bottom"""""   label.

However, you'll be happyto know I still have my IIGS set up and on my desk. I'll never get rid ofit!Anyway... I was just wondering what sort of interest people might have inme releasing ANSITerm and PMPFax for the GS again? Any thoughts? Yay? Nay?Is there still a market for fax and terminal software? I haven't doneanything with them for a long time, and I doubt I'd be able to update orenhance them, but if they're still of use to anyone, I wouldn't mindreleasing them again.Also, one thing I never got around to doing is releasing the Translatorspecs for PMPFax that allows you to create your own fax translators andadd-ins. They're basically a set of IPC calls (about 70 or so, if Iremember correctly) that you can use to communicate directly with PMPFax. Icould also release the actual source for the APF translator that I includedwith the program just to get programmers started. I have C header fileswith macro definitions for all of them that allow you to use these callsjust like C functions.Anyway, I'm just kicking the idea around.

It is to:UPGRADE THE PRODOS FILING SYSTEM BEYOND THE INHERENT 16 BIT RESTRICTIONS ONBLOCK SIZES.To do this, the first step MUST be somebody publishing a paper on how tophysically contain (assuming) 32 bit block numbers within the ProDOS filingsystem.

Is this really worth it when other filing systems alreadysupport 32 bit?Once a decision to proceed is made, and you have the changes required, onlyTHEN can you decide how to implement it, whether it be through a new FST,patches to the current FST or support in ProDOS 8.Until these initial steps are taken, the project cannot be taken seriously.(IMNSHO) ;-)Regards, Richard                      (RICHARD_B, 2606, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>> "UPGRADE THE PRODOS FILING SYSTEM BEYOND THE INHERENT 16 BIT"""""  RESTRICTIONS ON BLOCK SIZES."You can ask for this all you want, but I don't think it will never happen.In fact, I hope it never happens. The same is true for extending the lengthof file names or allowing other characters in file names. You really haveto recognize the inherent limits in the OS itself.The ProDOS file system only allows room for two bytes for block numbers.That limits you to 65536 blocks per file. Any attempt to increase thenumber of blocks would break every application ever written thatmanipulates the file system. That does NOT just mean disk optimizers, italso includes every 8 bit application and most 16 bit applications that canlist the files on the disk, including, but not limited to, Apple's ProDOSutilities, Mac OS, BASIC.System and ORCA/M.The same is true for extending the length of a file name.Many programs would work if you changed the characters allowed in a filename, especially programs written for Apple IIGS System 4 or later, butmany would break. Frankly, since there is an HFS FST, I'd recommend notallowing any file names with characters other than those allowed now. In myopinion, the benefit would be swamped by the confusion and the number ofprograms that would not handle the new characters.It is possible to extend the maximum length of files using ProDOS withoutchanging the number of blocks that can appear in a file. ProDOS and GS/OSboth flatly state that you can change the size of each block to somethingother than 512 bytes per block. Any correctly written program should allowfor this possibility and function correctly if you increase the block sizeto, say, 1K to support a 64M drive. This is the same method that HFS usedto support larger volumes. I also know that Apple experimented with changesto the block size and directory header at one point, making changes thatany correctly written program should support (i.e. one that followed all ofthe published rules). They never released the changes because so fewprograms--even their own--worked when the changes were installed. In fact,one of their engineers commented that ORCA/M was one of the very fewprograms that could still catalog a disk. :)Finally, keep in mind that very, very few programs can be changed at thispoint, even if you have an unlimited supply of competent programmer time,which you don't. A lot of the source code simply will not be available.For all of these reasons, I strongly believe that any attempt to mess withthe maximum size of a file, length of a file name, or the charactersallowed in a file name under ProDOS is a really, really bad idea.In my opinion, if, by some miracle, you get the source code to System 6.0.1released, a far better idea would be to concentrate solely on fixing bugs,especially in the ProDOS and HFS FSTs. Beyond that, making the PC DOS FSTread/write would be very useful.Mike Westerfield                      (BYTEWORKS, 2614, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Absolutely!

It's actually not (too!) hard to disassemble anFST. The problem is _understanding_ it, particularly given all theundocumented internal calls to the $01/FCxx entry points. Even with thepre-release documentation (which has many more calls than the finalmanuals), there are still many calls whose function is unknown. And thepurpose of many of the "pre-release" calls is not clear either, even ifthey do at least have a name.So it starts to look like it might be necessary to disassemble GS/OS properto find out what the calls do. And that's a task not to be undertakenlightly!Getting the source to GS/OS? Six months ago it would have been a laughablesuggestion. Today though, maybe there's a chink that we can exploit. Isuspect that at least part of the problem will be that nobody will want torelease the code while it's still in use by non-"hobbyists" (schools, etc).Especially since if the code is like any I've seen in many places, it willprobably consist mostly of well engineered bits, but with some absolute"hacks" that they hope will never see the light of day.

A "new" ProDOS FST has evenbigger problems, namely that it doesn't exist at all.

Every disadvantage cited for HFS would apply to the newProDOS FST, too.

I said that thisproject would not progress properly until its aims were clearly defined(which they have still yet to be).

If a team was put together to update ProDOS, then 90% of thetime would be spent arguing over who would do the disassembly of the FST.So why not just do that instead?On a final note, I want to say that I have no interest in updating ProDOS,and think the project will fail, and perhaps never even get off the ground.I was posting possible solutions to at least help out. That doesn't mean Inecessarily agreed with it though.However, I would have an interest in reading an HFS FST disassembly, justour of interest. :-)Hmmm...

A new ProDOS FST would have more things to do, so it toowould probably turn out slower.Using an accelerated IIgs, I never saw any real speed hit using HFS, expectperhaps when writing floppies. To a hard drive, it is only a little slower.The real problem with the HFS FST is that it does tend to build acollection of 'Missing file records' on an HFS volume. This does not seemto cause problems on the IIgs side, or the Mac side, and can easily befixed by running 'Disk First Aid' on the Mac. What we really need is apatch to the FST to resolve that, or a utility that can fix the threadsfrom the IIgs side. A utility to do some basic 'Disk First Aid' work fromthe IIgs side would probably be the easiest thing to write.I agree with Richard, if you change the ProDOS FST, it is no longer ProDOS,and almost every P8 program I have written, would probably no longer work.All those utilities such as ProSel would cease to be of use as well, so youwould be looking not only at writing a new FST, but a host of utilities togo with it!Let's be realistic here. Who would write any updated FST? I can't see anyof those capable of doing it thinking it is a good idea, and so offering towrite one.

Simply put, it is an "IBM" XT Turbo on acard that fits in an Apple ][+, //e, or IIgs slot and acts like an IBM with640K.  If you want to read genuine IBM disks (360K 5.25" or 720K 3.5", nothigh density) you will also need a "TransDrive", which has the space to adda 3.5" drive above the 5.25", or an Apple 3.5" drive, which can read bothIBM and Prodos formats.  You also get 768K of memory to use with_Appleworks_ and other ProDOS programs that use Apple's Memory ExpansionProtocol.  As with many peripherals, a hard drive helps a lot and itdoesn't matter if you can't partition the drive, as the system works undera ProDOS file anyway.  It also requires MS DOS 3.1 or higher-- MS DOS 5.0seems to work like a charm.  With a ][+ it requires an IBM style extendedkeyboard, also recommended for a //e, but a IIgs keyboard is fine.     One very interesting and useful piece of included software enables youto transfer files from MS DOS to ProDOS and vice versa, enabling one towork on _WordPerfect_ files on _Appleworks_ and then save them in a mannerthat can be read on an IBM at the office.  This system is somewhat easierthan _CrossWorks_, as you don't have to connect 2 machines to modems orcables to transpose data.     I recently had the frustrating experience of attempting to import adatabase file with 1300 records from one IBM program to another.  Afterspending 22 hours trying unsuccessfully to accomplish my goal, I enlistedthe efforts of Sam Latella to change the data to ProDOS and Terry Steeperto help me set up an _Appleworks GS_ database file.  Bingo!  The transferwas done and I have enhanced, sorted and manipulated the file in many ways,which my cohorts still have trouble doing on their IBM programs and theythink I did it with a Mac, the only Apple most people know exists.     It is a pity that Applied Engineering has not seen fit to upgrade thesystem to work with high density drives and be memory expandable, in factit appears that the PC Transporter is destined to be discontinued.  Pity!     Applied Engineering is currently selling the PC Transporter, kit,software and choice of drives for 33% less than normal retail prices!There are also a few used Transporters available for even less cost.  About9 London Apple Club members either still have, or did have PC Transporters,most so that they could work on IBM programs at home and take the resultsback to the office.  Two members went through University with the help of aPC Transporter, one in Engineering, one in Computer Science and while someIBM programs are not compatible, most work fine.    If you have to work with IBM files, but don't want to lose the userfriendliness of your Apple and haven't got the desktop space for 2machines, why not consider a PC Transporter?  It may just fit your needsfor a lot less cost than a new computer.[Tee's 1999 note: I have read about a number of Delphi members that stilluse their PC Transporters in 1999 and I wrote the above article in 1993.][EOA][KFE]------------------------------                    THINKING KFEST |-----------------------------------KansasFest 1999~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~by Douglas Cuff[doug@cuff.com]                   The Accidental Tourist at KansasFest                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Copyright 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 by Douglas Cuff.  All rights reserved.     The Accidental Tourist travel guides were described by Anne Tyler inher 1985 novel of the same name (later a movie starring William Hurt,Kathleen Turner, and Geena Davis).  The Accidental Tourist guides weredesigned for the business traveller whose reactions to travel were feelingsof anxiety and defenseless.  The guides were meant to soothe and comfortthe non-adventurous traveller.     If you've never been to KansasFest before, you should find that thisguide will do the same for you.  If you're an old hand at KansasFest, thisguide will provide you with some helpful reminders.     (If you've read this far with a growing sense of _deja vu_, that'sbecause this article originally appeared in _GenieLamp A2_ Vol. 5, Issue 52[July 1996], and was reprinted in _GenieLamp A2_ in 1997.  This is itssecond revision in _The Lamp!_)     One word of warning:  If there's a conflict between the advice youreceive from the Accidental Tourist and the instructions you're given fromthe information packet when you arrive at KansasFest--pay attention to theofficial info packet.  These folks know the score.     KansasFest began in 1989 as the A2-Central Developer Conference, anddidn't begin calling itself KansasFest until its third year, 1991.KansasFest takes place in Kansas City, Missouri.  (Not Kansas City, Kansas.The Kansas border is less than a mile away, if that comforts you any.)     This will be the eleventh annual KansasFest, and it's not just forprogrammers and developers any more.  If you've never been to KansasFestbefore, you don't know what you're missing!  It's a great chance to learnabout your Apple II, mingle with other users, and see what software otherpeople are working on.  This is the Apple II event of the year.  I can'tsay exactly how many people will there, but a safe estimate is 50-100attendees (counting those who stay off-campus).     What campus?  KansasFest takes place entirely at Avila College, in thesouthmost part of Kansas City.  Here's the address:          Avila College          11901 Wornall Road          Kansas City, Missouri  64145  U.S.A.          phone (816) 942-8400     Avila College is small--approximately 1500 students--which means youcan walk anywhere on campus in five minutes.  Use of a car is therefore asoptional as it's ever going to get, assuming you fly to Kansas.  The onetime you are going to be hollering for a vehicle is when you try to get toand from Kansas City International airport.  More on that shortly.     This year, KansasFest is scheduled for July 21-July 25, but dorm roomsare available for the nights of July 20-July 25.          PM   Tue July 20    early arrival               Wed July 21    registration and keynote address (evening)               Thu July 22    scheduled sessions               Fri July 23    scheduled sessions               Sat July 24    demos (morning); vendors' fair (afternoon)          AM   Sun July 25    farewell     Check-in time is 1-4 PM Wednesday.  Check-out time is 11 AM-1 PMSunday.     How much the conference costs depends on when you pay for it and whatkind of accommodation you require.  You can save a few bucks if you'rewilling to share a room--private rooms cost more.  (The prices went up by$50 on April 16.)  Arriving early costs a little more, naturally.          arrival:            Wed.      Tue.          private room        $325      $358          shared room         $275      $300          spouse rate         $225      $250          conference only     $225     It is possible to stay at a hotel for about the same price, butstaying on campus is still a better idea, since after-hours activities area big part of KansasFest.  If you've ever attended a conference held in onehotel but stayed in another hotel, you'll remember how much you'd wishedyou'd stayed "on site".     Also, the campus room rates include meals from Wednesday eveningdinner on July 21 through Sunday morning breakfast on July 25, with theexception of the Saturday evening meal.     One note on meals for all attendees:  For the first eight years ofKansasFest, free lunch at Avila's cafeteria used to be included for _all_KFesters, even those not staying on campus.  These days, those not stayingon campus must provide their own lunches.  Fortunately, being banished fromthe Avila cafeteria ought not make anyone weep.     Those staying on campus should also note that no meals are provided onTuesday or Wednesday (because both dates are before the official start)night nor on Saturday night (because that's the unofficially official nighton the town).  Keep in mind that you're on your own your last night there.You can get a breakfast on Sunday, though, if you're staying on campus.     You will be staying in Ridgway dormitory, which was built in 1963.For those of you who have never experienced dorm life or have forgottenwhat it was like, expect spartan surroundings.  Forget the idea of aprivate bathroom, but you'll be glad to know that the rooms areair-conditioned.BEFORE YOU GO   As with any trip, you need to arrange for several things:"""""""""""""     o  conference attendance;     o  accommodation (included in package);     o  meals (included in package);     o  transport to/from conference.     Those attending from outside the United States will also need:     o  passport/visa;     o  medical insurance;     o  US currency/traveller's checks.Conference Attendance   There are 80 spaces for on-campus attendees,'''''''''''''''''''''   and even if you register late, there may be roomfor off-campus conference attendees.  You may be able to register at Avilaon July 20/21.  Check first.     You can get more KansasFest information by checking out the KFest HomePage at http://www.kfest.org.

If youhave questions first, send e-mail to kfest-help@kfest.org.Accommodation   If you're staying at Avila College campus, chances are good'''''''''''''   that you're going to be sharing a room with one otherperson.  Space is limited, so you're unlikely to end up in a room byyourself unless you specifically request a private room (which costs more).The rooms are _not_ co-ed (aside from the occasional married couple), butthe dorms are.     There aren't any hotels within walking distance of Avila College, soplan on having transportation if you're staying off-campus.     Here are some hotels said to be near Avila College.  Please be warnedthat I haven't stayed at any of them, so I can't make recommendations.Approximate room rates are shown.          Fairfield Inn--Overland Park          4401 W. 107th, Overland Park, KS 66207          913-381-5700          $55-$75          (closest hotel to KansasFest in Kansas)          Courtyard by Marriott South          500 E. 105th St., Kansas City, MO  64131          816-941-3333          $99          (closest hotel to KansasFest in Missouri)          Candlewood Suites          11001 Oakmont, Overland Park, KS  66210          913-469-5557          $89-119          DoubleTree Hotel Kansas City Corporate Woods          10100 College Boulevard, Overland Park, KS 66210          800-222-TREE / 913-451-6100          $109-$159          Drury Inn--Overland Park          10951 Metcalf Avenue, Overland Park, KS  66210          913-345-1500          $72-91          Overland Park Marriott Hotel          10800 Metcalf Avenue, Overland Park, KS 66210          800-228-9290 / 913-451-8000          $129-$155          AmeriSuites          6801 W. 112th, Overland Park, KS 66211          800-833-1516 / 913-451-2553          $107-$127          Red Roof Inn--Overland Park          6800 W. 108th St., Overland Park, KS 66211          913-341-0100          $46-$76          Residence Inn by Marriott--Overland Park          6300 W. 110th Street, Overland Park, KS 66211          800-331-3131 / 913-491-3333          $109-$159          Sumner Suites          5001 W 110th Street, Overland Park, KS  66211          913-491-9002          $99          Wyndham Gardnen Hotel--Overland Park          7000 W 108th Street, Overland Park, KS  66211-1163          913-383-2550          $74-$109          Clubhouse Inn & Suites--Overland Park          10610 Marty Avenue, Overland Park, KS 66212          800-CLUBINN / 913-648-5555          $75-$95          Courtyard by Marriott          11301 Metcalf Avenue, Overland Park, KS 66212          913-339-9900          $124-$134          Embassy Suites Hotel--Overland Park          10601 Metcalf Avenue, Overland Park, KS 66212          800-362-2779 / 913-649-7060          $129-$159          (charges for local calls)          Hampton Inn--Overland Park          10591 Metcalf Frontage Road, Overland Park, KS 66212          800-HAMPTON / 913-341-1551          $84-$94          Homewood Suites          10556 Marty Avenue, Overland Park, KS 66212          913-341-5576          $119-$149Meals   If you're staying on Avila campus, meals are included in the'''''   package price (except Saturday evening).  If you aren't staying atAvila, you're completely on your own.     If you find the cafeteria food not to your liking--and manydon't--you'll be relieved to know that there's a supermarket about 25minutes' walk away.  Here's how to get there:     Start at Carondelet dorm.  Stand with your back to the dorm entrance,so that you can see the Marian Center if you look left.  Turn right fromCarondelet and walk down to the parking lot.  Turn left and walk out of theparking lot, down Sister Oliver Louise Drive.  This private road takes youto 118th Street.  Turn left and walk on 118th until you reach Wornall Road.Turn right on Wornall until you reach the intersection of Wornall andMinor.  Turn right onto Minor Drive.     Once on Minor, ten minutes' walk will bring you close to the end ofMinor, to the point where you can see a large parking lot.  Veer left andyou'll be at a small shopping mall that boasts a bank, a supermarket, and arestaurant.  (Note:  This trip can be made a few minutes shorter, but thesedirections are simpler, and can be easily adapted for use by motorists aswell as pedestrians.)     If you're not staying on Avila campus, you're probably sufficientlyadventurous to know how to find decent food in a strange city.  Be awarethat Saturday evening is when the group has a night out at a restaurant(often either KC Masterpiece or Jess & Jim's).  Let them know you want tobe part of the crowd that night!  And there may be other excursions onother nights... you'll hear about them if you keep your ears open.Transportation 101/A--Getting to Kansas   Many of you intend to fly to'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Kansas City.  The airport youwill be arriving at is Kansas City International (MCI).  The airport hasthree arc-shaped terminals.  If you're meeting someone there, be sure thateveryone intends to go to the same terminal, or that everyone is catchingthe (free) shuttle to the same car rental agency.     You can pick up a city map at one of the airport magazine stands.  TheGousha map has Avila College marked (grid location I-19).  If you have the(1998) AAA map, you'll find Avila College at grid location AX-24.  If youdon't have a map, better pay close attention:     If you drew a map of Kansas City on a 8x11 sheet of paper, the airportwould be in the upper left corner, to the northwest.  Avila College wouldbe near the bottom of the piece of paper, near the center.  Point taken?     The distance between Avila College and the international airport isnot small.  It's perhaps 45 miles by the recommended route (below), soallow an hour's travel time at a bare minimum.  What with collecting yourluggage and arranging/co-ordinating ground transportation, it's probablysafer to assume it will take you two hours to get from the airport toAvila, starting from the time the plane's landing gear touches the tarmacand stopping when you sling your suitcase onto the dorm bed.     If you need more information on the Kansas City International Airport,you can check out their World Wide Web page: http://www.kcairports.org.Transportation 101/B--Getting to Avila   Since the distance from the''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   airport to Avila College is 28miles as the crow flies, and about 45 miles by car, you don't even want tothink about taking a taxi.  You'd pay $35 minimum, possibly as much as $60.For a one-way trip.     If you book ahead, you can get one of the airport transportationservices to take you to Avila College at a more reasonable rate.  In thepast, I've recommended Quicksilver, but they seem to have disappeared twoyears back, in 1997. (Last year, some people within the United States wereable to get through to them, but not me.)  So this year I'm afraid your abit more on your own than I'd like to leave you.     Here are some numbers for limousine services.  I HAVEN'T TRIED ANY OFTHEM.  (You have no idea how much it hurts to have to say that.)  I don'tknow how much any of them charge--they may even be more expensive thantaxis.     Airport Transportation Cab Service 816-421-7000     Arya Airport Transportation        816-531-1001     KCI Shuttle                        816-243-5000     La Plant Airport Transporation     816-421-7611     Usually, you _must_ book these limo services in advance; theygenerally need at least one's day's notice.  IF YOU DON'T MAKE ARESERVATION, THEY CAN'T TAKE YOU.  Don't think you can call them once youarrive at the airport--you can't.     (If you want to research possible other numbers, try pointing your webbrowser to http://www.kcairports.org/kci/limos.htm but be warned that thispage is out of date, since it still lists Quicksilver.  You could also tryhttp://www.thetrip.com/ride/MCI/ but again be warned that I can't vouch foranything listed there.  Sorry, folks.)     If you don't want to rent a car, you could also take the AirportExpress van to the Overland Park Marriott hotel and take a cab from there.     (Those of you renting cars at the airport:  we'll discuss the routeshortly, in the ARRIVAL section.)PREPARING FOR THE TRIP   Get plenty of sleep before you go, because you're""""""""""""""""""""""   not likely to get much sleep at KansasFest.KansasFest days are 18 hours long, unless they're 20 or 24 hours long.There's too much going on to waste time in sleep!     On the same note, make sure you don't schedule anything important(like operating heavy machinery) for the day after KansasFest--Monday, July26.  You'll have had so little sleep that you won't feel your best.Packing--Computer Stuff   Lots of people bring computers.  If you're doing'''''''''''''''''''''''   this, make a backup of your hard drive and leavethe backup at home.  If you won't feel safe unless you take a backup withyou, make two backups.     If you're bringing a hard drive and you're travelling by plane, youmay want to consider packing the hard drive in your carry-on luggage.  Thatway, you can extract the hard drive from the luggage before it gets X-rayed(!).  Tell the attendant that what you are carrying in your hand is a harddrive for a computer, and that it might be damaged by the X-ray machine.Chances are they'll handle it differently.  If they tell you that no damagecould possibly be caused, don't believe them.  (You may have to obey them,but don't believe them.)  Try insisting--politely!--on special handlinganyway.  Incidentally, X-rays are not good for diskettes either.     Bring plenty of extension cords, power bars, and surge suppressors,plus a phone cord if you bring your modem, or a properly configuredEthernet cable if you'll be using a Macintosh or WinTel box.  (For Ethernetcable details, see Ryan Suenaga's KFest FAQ, available athttp://www.kfest.org/kfestfaq.html.)  Bring plenty of blank disks.  Bringanything you'd like to show off, either software or hardware.Packing--Other Stuff   A word about clothing:  KansasFest is "dress''''''''''''''''''''   casual", and Kansas City in July is hot and humid,so light clothing would be a good idea.  If you're bringing anything thatyou want to hang in the closet, bring your own hangers.     You should pack a bathrobe or something you don't mind walking thehalls in when you rise in the morning.  The dorms will be housing bothsexes, and there are no private bathrooms.     Towels are supplied, but you can pack an extra one if you feel soinclined.  Be sure to bring all the usual toiletries:  soap, shampoo,toothbrush, and all the etceteras.     There are modular phone jacks in all the dorm rooms, but phones arenot provided, so pack a phone, if only for local calls (which are free).If you know who your roommate is, you can assure her or him that you'rebringing the phone and save her or him the trouble.     If you're serious about making the morning sessions, an alarm clock isa good idea.  If you're _really_ serious about attending morning sessions,ear plugs--for the night before--couldn't hurt either. <grin>     Unless you're a private soul, some sort of sign for your door is agood idea, so that people can find you.  Many people take the trouble tomake these before they leave.     Don't forget your airline tickets and other travel documents, if any,but don't pack them in your checked luggage.  Also don't forget a quarter(and possibly a dime too) for a phone call.ARRIVING""""""""Getting from the Airport to Avila   If you've arranged with an'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   airport transportation service to pickyou up at the airport, as you leave the "gate", look for someone holding upa sign with your name on it.  (The sign will probably also have the name ofthe service written on it.)     Of course, these "airport limos" have been known to get busy atKansasFest time.  If no one is there looking for you, start by looking forthem.  Their people are usually easy to spot.  If there's no one from theairport transportation service in the terminal, don't panic.  Just callthem--it'll be a local call from the airport.  (You did remember the moneyfor a phone call, didn't you?)     Remember that you usally _cannot_ ride with an "airport limo" serviceunless you have made a reservation in advance.Driving from the Airport to Avila   If you're renting a car, start looking'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   for the desk of the rental agencyyou're dealing with.  (If you have to go to another terminal, remember thatthere are shuttle buses among the three terminals.)     Once you've got your car, exit through the airport's main gate(Cookingham Drive) onto Interstate 29 heading south.  At highway 152, exitwest.  Follow 152 west to I-435.  Take I-435 south and follow it arounduntil it reaches Wornall Road from the west.  Take the Wornall Road exit.Then turn in at Avila College (which is a left turn off Wornall if youapproach it from I-435).  Check our handy Avila map below for where topark.  The best place is probably the lot near the dormitories.After Hours Arrival   It's Wednesday night, and it's dark already.'''''''''''''''''''   The airport limo has just dropped you off... oryou've just parked the rental car.  You're tired after the long drive fromthe airport.  You've never been to Avila College before.  Now what do youdo?     Well, if you know beforehand that you're going to arrive after hours,you should contact Cindy Adams so that she can let the Avila staff knowabout late arrivals.  Suppose, however, that you've arrived late byaccident--your flights was delayed, or your car had a flat?  What do you donow?     It's easy.  The campus at Avila is small, and there are only threebuilding that KFesters need to explore:     I.  Whitfield Conference Center:  This is where most of the actualconference sessions take place.  It's sufficiently small that you'd have totry really hard to get lost here.  If you walk the path to Whitfield fromone of the other buildings listed below, go down the stairs as soon as youget inside the door.  If you enter Whitfield from the roadway, you're atthe main conference entrance, so don't worry.     II.  Marian Center:  This is where the cafeteria is.  Unless you'rebooked into a nearby hotel, this is where you come to eat.  This is alsowhere the celebrity roast is traditionally held.  Yes, you're allowed toattend the roast even if you're staying at a hotel.     III.  Ridgway Dormitory:  This is where you sleep, at least in theory.Even hotel-dwellers need to know about the dorms, since you'll spend a lotof your evenings hanging out here.     Look at the map of the campus below and get your bearings:                           AVILA COLLEGE CAMPUS              *                        ___________           *             *          ##########    |           |           *            *           ##########  ...           |            *           *            ##########  . |___________|             *          *                         .      .           ########***         *                 ______   .      .........   ########   *        *                 |      |  .           ___.____           *       *                  |      |  .          |        |           *      *                   |______|  .          | Marian |            *     *                              .          | center |             *    *       ______                  .          |________|              *****       |      |                 .              .                    *    *      |      |                 .              ..............        *     *     |      |                 .              .        ____._____  ##      *    |______| ................................       |          | ##       *            .         _____            .           |Carondelet| ##        *   ________.__      |     |           .           |   dorm   | ##  ___   *  |           |     |     |           .           |__________| ## |   |  * [| Whitfield |     |     |       ____._____                   ## |   | #*#[|  center   |     |_____|      |          |    ################ |   | #*# |___________|                  | Ridgway  |    ################ |___| #*#                                |   dorm   |    ################       #*#                                |__________|        *        *                               ... = pathway                               *** = roadway                               ### = parking                         [ = main entrance (Whitfield)     A good place to start may be Marian Center, since dinner and thekeynote address are taking place there on Wednesday night.  If it's lateWednesday night, forget about registering for the _conference_.  Check-inended at 4 PM.  Concentrate on registering for your _room_, so at leastyou'll have a place to sleep tonight.     If it's extremely late at night, the front doors of the dorms may beshut.  Look for a buzzer that will rouse a member of the staff.     The best thing to do is to read the instructions in your preliminaryinformation packet, but if they don't produce satisfactory results, wanderabout one or both of the dorms until you find someone who'll take pity onyour and let you collapse onto a bed.  You'll get a room assignment and aroom key.  (You may even get a sheet of paper that tells you who you'vebeen billeted with and how to register for the conference on the followingmorning.)  However, don't collapse the minute you see your room key.  Thelowest number it will have on it is 401.  That does _not_ mean you're onthe fourth floor.  (Particularly as Ridgway has only three floors.)  Ifyour room number begins with 4, it means you're on the first floor (or"ground floor" to most Europeans).  Similar deal for the second and thirdfloors.  If your room number doesn't begin with 4, 5, or 6, it means youaren't staying at Ridgway--you're probably staying at Carondelet.     If wandering around the dorms doesn't produce any results, try MarianCenter.  If you still can't find anyone, wander down toward Whitfield.     Arriving after hours means you get to check in to your room.  Youstill must register for the conference in the morning.  We'll cover that inthe "Business Hours Arrival" section.  For now, what about your room?Your Room   Rooms at the Avila College dorms each have two beds.  If your'''''''''   roommate is there, smile and introduce yourself.  If yourroommate isn't there, don't be alarmed.  Your roommate may not have arrivedyet, in which case you get to grab the best bed.  (I'm joking.  Neither bedwill be any less loathsome than the other.)  Probably your roommate hasalready arrived, grabbed the best bed, and is out visiting others.     Near the beds is a long institutional-looking unit with two closets,two sets of drawers, and assorted storage space.  The opposite side of thisunit is a desk long enough for two people to work at.  There's plenty ofroom for two computers on this desk, but there's just one outlet percomputer.  If you don't have a power bar or a Kensington System Saver or anAE Conserver, you're going to be limited to plugging in the computer andthe monitor--no hard drive, no modem, nothing else.  (Those of you withinternal hard drives can stop being smug right now.)     Near the desk are two outlets that seem to be phone jacks.  They_aren't_ phone jacks--they're Ethernet ports (RJ-45 connectors to a 10Base-T connection, for the technically-oriented).  The phone jack is on theother side of the room, by the beds.  If you didn't bring plenty of phoneextension cord, you'll have to set up your computer at the foot of yourbed.  (Don't laugh.  It's happened.)  Don't waste time looking for thephone; they aren't supplied, which is why you had to bring one in yoursuitcase.  To find out the phone number of your room (so that people cancall you), ask one of the Avila staff.  If you didn't bring a phone, youcan still use one of the pay phones in the hallways.     When dialing out from your dorm room, either with a phone or a modem,you'll need to prefix the number with a 9 to get an outside line.  Ifyou're using a modem, you may be able to use its "wait for dialtone"feature before you dial the number.  So the proper sequence would be:          ATDT9w4741778     If your modem doesn't support "wait for dialtone", try using a fewcommas (,) to create a pause:          ATDT9,,4725178     You may also need to set your software up so it waits about 45 secondsfor a connect instead of the standard 30 seconds, because it takes a bitlonger to get through to the number you're dialing.     (There's information about dialing Delphi later in this article.)     Of course, if you've brought a Macintosh or WinTel box, you may beable to use the Ethernet connection instead of the phone line.  There areseveral gotchas here.  Check out Ryan Suenaga's KFest FAQ (in last month'sissue) for more information.     The only real luxury that the rooms boast is air-conditioning.  Noprivate baths here, but you'll find bathrooms just down the corridor apiece.  The one I frequented had one bathtub, two showers, three toilets,four sinks (one with an attachment for washing hair), and assorted mirrors.Every floor also seems to have a TV lounge and a small kitchen.Business Hours Arrival   If you arrive at Avila between 9 AM and 5 PM''''''''''''''''''''''   (preferably between 1 PM and 4 PM Wednesday!), youcan register for the conference and your room (if applicable) at the sametime.  Check your pre-conference packet for information on where toregister.  It will be somewhere in one of the four buildings mentionedabove, of course.     One note of warning:  if you've been told to register somewhere--say,the cafeteria at Marian center--and no one has shown up fifteen minutesafter the listed start time, then by all means check the dorms andWhitfield center to see if registration has been moved there.  It'sunlikely you'll have to worry about something like this, but it doesn'thurt to be prepared.ONCE YOU'RE THERE"""""""""""""""""Curricular Events   Originally, KansasFest was a conference for Apple II'''''''''''''''''   developers--people who wanted to create software andhardware for others to use.  Nowadays it's for users, too.  Don't worrythat you don't belong there--you do and you're welcome, whether you've cometo party or come to learn.     The sessions--no one dignifies them with the name "seminars"--aremostly held at the Whitfield conference center.  The main conference roomis right inside the main doors (the doors closest to Wornall Road).  If youdon't know how to get to the session you want to attend, come here.  Itwill either be in this room or someone in this room will know where theright room is.     There's a social aspect to this part of the occasion as well.  You'llsee plenty of schmoozing in Whitfield lobby, right outside the mainconference room.  Expect cameras, both still and video, and demented peopleoperating them.  Cameras are used to record the presentations, or peoplemeeting, or the general craziness that's going on!     "Formal" sessions have been known to take place in the dorms as well._Informal_ sessions have definitely been known to take place in the dorms!     On the Saturday of KansasFest, there's a demonstration of new andupcoming products and a vendors' fair.  The fair is a chance to pick uphardware and software at special KFest prices, and to see and buy softwarenever before released.Semi-curricular Events   While not officially part of the proceedings, some''''''''''''''''''''''   products _may_ be released at KansasFest.  (Isometimes think Apple II programmers would never ever ship if it weren'tfor KansasFest and Christmas.)  This year, I haven't heard anyannouncements, so you'll have to attend to find out what's up-and-coming.     Even if nothing gets released, you're practically guaranteed someproduct previews.  At this point, in previous years, I've made a few wildguesses at what you might see.  Sadly, this year I've been so busy (workingfull-time at last) that I haven't been in a position to hear any rumors.Extra-curricular Events   It is perfectly possible to attend KansasFest,'''''''''''''''''''''''   attend the sessions 9-5, and go back home.  Butwhy would you want to?     One reason you might want to is that you're shy.  You're shy at anygathering, but you can't imagine conversing with Tony Ward, MikeWesterfield, Joe Kohn, Max Jones, Tony Diaz, Geoff Weiss, or Ewen Wannop!There's no reason to be shy.  Do what Dean Esmay did at his firstKansasFest:  walk around introducing yourself.  To everyone.  You'll meetlots of people just as awestruck as you are, and you can swap tips,stories, recommendations, and lies.  Don't be intimidated by meetingwell-known Apple II figures.  Heck, we're all "just folks".     Don't let yourself leave KansasFest without having mingled.  Wanderaround the dorms.  If there's one person sitting at a computer, just say"hi".  You're intelligent enough to know how to figure out if the person ishard at work or at home to callers.  If there are a bunch of people--whichis far more likely, particularly during the evening--you might be shy aboutjoining the group.  Don't be.  Just announce your presence ("Hi, everybody!Room for one more?").  You'll be surprised how welcome the group will makeyou feel.  Whatever the group is doing, it's probably in "kibitz mode", sojoin in!     What will the group be doing?  Hard to say.  They might be:     o  trying out software that hasn't been released yet;     o  trying to get a piece of software to crash;     o  trying to get it to stop crashing (i.e. debugging it);     o  sending a group message to Delphi or Genie;     o  playing a game;     o  fixing hardware;     o  reminiscing about previous KansasFests; or     o  telling stories about the heyday of the Apple II.     There's a chance that the group will be "multi-tasking"--that is,doing more than one of these things at the same time.     There are other extra-curricular events that have almost become KFesttraditions:  Nerf(TM) warfare and a game called Bite the Bag, whichinvolves a paper bag and a sense of balance.  But what about the "real"traditions?Tradition I:  Celebrity Roast   If the term "celebrity roast" is new to'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   you, rest assured that it's not dangerous,not even to the celebrity.  Open flame is not involved, exceptmetaphorically.  A roast is simply an event where members of a panel giveshort speeches which "honor" the celebrity guest by dishing outgood-natured insults and back-handed compliments:  "Ewen Wannop is atalented guy, but his opinion of himself can make it hard to reason withhim.  For instance, last night it took me six solid hours to persuade himto stop walking on the water."  (Except that most of the jokes will befunnier than that.)  Ideally, the person being "roasted" is the keynotespeaker from the previous KFest, but this isn't always possible.  Thisyear, the celebrity being roasted is Ewen Wannop, author of Spectrumtelecommunications software for the Apple IIgs.     This event is catered and held in the Avila cafeteria in the Mariancenter.  It's open to all KansasFest attendees, not just those staying oncampus.Tradition II:  Calling Delphi   The link between KansasFest and Delphi is a'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   relatively new one, but as people alwaysmanaged to find time to post early reports on Genie in years past, peoplealso will find time to do the same on Delphi--it's the service with thehottest connection to KansasFest.     Here are the SprintNet numbers, through which you can access bothGenie and Delphi:            300/ 1200       816-221-9900           2400             816-472-1430           9600/14400       816-421-5783     To sign on to Delphi using SprintNet:          1.  Dial the local SprintNet number.          2.  Wait to be connected.               o  If your modem is 300 or 1200 baud, press Return, then                  press D, then Return again.               o  If your modem is 2400 baud or faster, type @D, then press                  Return.          3.  When TERMINAL= appears, press Return.          4.  Wait for @ to appear, then type C DELPHI and press Return.     Don't worry about long-distance charges within the city.  The greatermetropolitan area of Kansas City is in two states with two area codes (816for Missouri and 913 for Kansas).  However, nearly all calls within theKansas City metropolitan area are local.     Remember that you need to prefix the number with a 9 (to get anoutside line) and either a "wait for dialtone" command (w) or "pause"command (,) before you dial the number.          ATDT9w472-5178 or ATDT9,,472-5178Tradition III:  Dining Out   It's traditional at KFest to take at least one""""""""""""""""""""""""""   meal at one of two restaurants (or both!)--KCMasterpiece and Jess & Jim's.     This is guaranteed to happen on Saturday night--it's scheduled; it'sin the programme.  But it may happen on other nights too.  If you hang outin the dorm rooms, you're bound to hear of groups heading off to "dineposh".  Ask to be counted in... and tell me what happens, all the gorydetails.  The thought of breaking bread with some of these people intriguesme.A TYPICAL DAY   A KansasFest day doesn't begin when you might it expect it"""""""""""""   to.  It begins right after supper.  The pressing questionof something to eat over with, you take the aperitif of your choice--Jolt!cola, Dr Pepper, or Mountain Dew--and wander around the dorms to see who'sdoing what.  Some people will be staying up until _very_ late.  The reasonfor this is that program bugs stay hidden until at least 2 AM, and thereally obscure ones wait until 5 AM.     When morning comes, you may or may not have gotten any sleep.  If youhave, chances are that you didn't get much of it.  The cafeteria staff stopserving breakfast at 8:30, but you may decide that sleep is more importantthan food.  In fact, you may decide that sleep is more important than beingat the first session.  Or the first two sessions.  Or world peace.     Eventually you get out of bed and dither over which of thesimultaneous sessions you want to attend.  You can bring paper or acomputer to take notes, if you wish--no one will laugh or point.  No onewill frown if you don't take notes, either.     All sessions will run over their allotted time.  This is an immutablerule.  The domino theory rapidly comes into play here, which wreaks merryhavoc with the schedule.     After the morning sessions, there's an hour to get some lunch at thecafeteria at Marian center.  No one takes attendance here, either.     During lunch, the stragglers begin to arrive, and afternoon sessionsmay be more generously attended and received, since pretty much everyone isnow awake and reasonably certain that life is worth living.  The afternoonsessions will officially end at 5:00 or 5:30, but they may last a whilelonger, since no one else is waiting to use the room.  It's possible to getso involved in the final session for the day that you miss the evening mealat the cafeteria.     Or perhaps you've decided to give the cafeteria a miss.  Someone mightbe headed to a restaurant for a meal--ask around.  After you've eaten,well... the cycle begins all over.LEAVING   Avila College hosts events other than KansasFest--in fact,"""""""   Avila's summers are tightly booked.  In previous years, bothRidgway and Carondelet dorms have been available to KFesters, but in recentyeas the organizing committee could only get one.  That should give yousome idea of how hectic things are.     Because Avila is playing host to others after KansasFest is over, besure to check out on time.  This year, you have the option of staying overon Saturday night and checking out on Sunday, but don't push it.  Check-outtime is 11 AM-1 PM Sunday.  Avila wants you out of there by 1 PM on Sundayat the _latest_!     Incidentally, if you're travelling with Quicksilver or another similaroutfit, don't forget that you must have booked your return trip to theairport at least 24 hours in advance.  Since most people leave at much thesame time, it may be possible to cadge a lift to the airport if you've madefriends with someone heading that way.     This is far from the end.  In fact, it's not even the beginning.  Ifyou've been reading this, it's undoubtedly to prepare for KansasFest, whichmeans it's all still to come!  So have a great time at KansasFest--and ifyou spot the man who began it all, Tom Weishaar (a/k/a "Uncle DOS"), givehim my warmest regards.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :  I have a rock garden.
