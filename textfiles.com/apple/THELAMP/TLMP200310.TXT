"Build it and They Will Come".     And, yes indeed, ghosts of great ball players of the past come out ofthe corn field and use the ball field.     Turning off the highway near Dyersville, Iowa, the narrow road led tothe movie set for Field of Dreams.  There it is... a Baseball field with acorn field right next to the outfield.     Sales are brisk at the two souvenir shops which raise the fundsnecessary to preserve and maintain the ball field.     Out on the field there are many individuals who do not know eachother, fulfilling their fantasy of being part of the movie... taking turnspitching, batting, running the bases, catching, fielding balls, etc.  Thereis this feeling of kinship among these people brought on by their commoninterest.                             Syndicomm Online                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Here is a Field of Dreams for you... and it is not a fantasy.Membership in Syndicomm Online includes bulletin boards, chat rooms, filelibrary, email address, personal web site, and Lynx browser.

In the interim, I've had two otherunfortunate events happen.     The screen on my Palm Tungsten C developed a crack, which rendered itunusable. Although Palm agreed to replace it for free, it appears thattheir supplies are short, just as Apple's supplies for PowerBook logicboards were short. The result was about three weeks without a tool that Iuse daily at work, let alone using it to work on the Lamp Index.     So THAT slowed me down. And just as I thought I was ready to get goingagain, I opened up the PowerBook, with its newly replaced innards, andfound a black screen. No picture. Not even a pulsing light when it was"sleeping". Interestingly, everything else was still working; I was able torestart and hear the usual tone. After it had completed the process I useda keyboard utility to start iTunes, and pressing the space bar started asong in the play list. I simply could not see what I was doing. A call toApple Technical Support could provide no other solution than to send itback in. There it is, even as I type these words on the Windows computer Ipreviously used at work. I'm trying not to complain to that computer abouthow it works differently; at the rate things are going, I don't need the"blue screen of death" coming up repeatedly, necessitating a reinstall ofWindows!(I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION     Well, enough whining. Let's get back to the Lamp, the reason thatwe've been having this little get together each month. In the last (real)installment of this column, we covered 1995 and the difficulties andchallenges that occurred during that year. Moving into 1996 finds ourintrepid band of Apple II enthusiasts dealing with damage to their home onGEnie, and the consequences of that damage.     Let's synchronize with the historical context: In 1996, the O.J.Simpson murder trial begins. Princess Diana and Prince Charles aredivorced. The school board of Oakland, California elects to recognize BlackEnglish, termed "Ebonics", as a separate language. British citizens arealarmed by the outbreak of "mad cow" disease.     Intel continues the processor arms race by releasing the 200 MHz P6(Pentium). IBM and Sears sell Prodigy to Internet Wireless, which thenre-launched it as an Internet-based service. CD-RW (read/write) technologybecomes available. In August, Microsoft introduces its Internet Explorerweb browser, challenging Netscape's Navigator browser. U.S. Roboticslaunches the Palm Pilot, its own version of a Personal Digital Assistant(PDA). MSNBC (sponsored by Microsoft and NBC) debuts on cable TV channels.     Following low Christmas sales that resulted in a loss of $61 million,Apple CEO Michael Spindler lost his position as Apple's third CEO, and wasreplaced by Gil Amelio. Amelio tried to help improve Apple's bottom line byreducing Macintosh motherboard designs to only two, and the hardwarearchitectures into a single system, as well as streamlining the corporatestructure. On April 1st, Apple celebrated its 20th birthday, and releasedthe 20th Anniversary Macintosh to commemorate the occasion. IBM releasesthe 603e and 604e PowerPC chips, first clocking at 166 MHz, and going up to200 MHz by mid year. At that time they also made the first announcement ofthe G3, the third generation PowerPC processor. Apple also continued toflounder with its efforts to update its Macintosh operating system, and theCopland Project was discontinued. During the year, much speculation wasmade about whether Apple would base it's next operating system on formerexecutive Jeane Louis-Gasse's BeOS, or exiled CEO Steve Job's NeXTStep. Thefinal decision was made at the end of the year with Apple's purchase ofNeXT, Inc. for $430 million. Amidst all of these struggles, the company'sstock price dropped to a 10-year low of $18 per share.GENIELAMP INFO     GEnieLamp A2 editor Doug Cuff began the year by giving his ownassessment of the ups and downs that occurred in 1995. He did a much betterjob summarizing what happened than I did; so much so that I'd like toreproduce it here: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||     In fact, we made out like bandits in 1995.  We got new hardware:   ||the SecondSight card and, along with the rest of the micro world,       ||IOmega ZIP drives.  We got new software: Quick Click Morph, TimeOut     ||Statistics, Convert 3200, Quick Click TIFF Reader, Deja II (AppleWorks  ||5.1 for the Mac), Opening Line, TouchTwo AppleWorks macros, Print 3200, ||and PMPFax, not to mention shareware/freeware efforts such as II Not    ||Disturb, Blockade (game from Brutal Deluxe), and Pix Whiz (New Print    ||Shop color pix editor).                                                 ||                                                                        ||     We also got significant updates and upgrades for some of our       ||software:  Spectrum v2.0, Balloon v2.0, AppleWorks v5.1, rSounder v3.0, ||AutoArk v1.1, TimeOut ShrinkIt v5, One Touch Commands 5, GEnie Master 5,||CoPilot for GEnie v2.5.5, The Tinies (with a new construction set), an  ||improved variable-time SHR screen saver, and a patch for the HFS FST.   ||                                                                        ||     Sure, it wasn't all good news.  There were some new products we    ||haven't gotten yet--the TurboRez card, Wolfenstein 3-D, SimCity, Tracer ||Sanction, Mind Shadow--and some updates that still haven't arrived:     ||GraphicWriter III v2.0, Kangaroo, TransProg III, SuperConvert, and a    ||decidedly unofficial System 6.0.2 from Brutal Deluxe.  We even suffered ||a few losses in 1995:  Your Money Matters and free Apple IIc            ||motherboard/ROM upgrades, to name just two.                             ||                                                                        ||     Our biggest losses in 1995 were our magazines and newsletters:     ||A2-Central, TimeOut-Central, Script-Central, Studio City, GS+ Magazine, ||Softdisk (but not Softdisk G-S), and AppleWorks Forum all ceased        ||publication. In March/April 1995, we were told that II Alive "is not    ||going quarterly any time soon". As of December, it seems that this is   ||exactly what's going to happen. There are about four more issues to     ||come, so II Alive will probably finish in late 1996 or early 1997.      ||                                                                        ||     So we lost ICON (International Computer Owners Network) and NAUG   ||(National AppleWorks Users Group)... Softdisk Publishing and EGO        ||Systems are still with us, not to mention Shareware Solutions II and    ||PAUG (Planetary Apple User Group). Two replacement newsletters have     ||come along: Apple Blossom by Steve Cavanaugh and II Something by Clark  ||Stiles, both of which are distributed freely.  Thanks to the efforts    ||of Joe Kohn and Will Nelken, Script-Central back issues and             ||TimeOut-Central back issues are again available.                        ||________________________________________________________________________|     In March, Cuff discussed the new change in ownership of GEnie, whichGeneral Electric had sold to Yovelle Renaissance Corp. The new name for theservice was "Genie", without the uppercase "E" that had always been used.The most obvious change that came about because of this sale was asubstantial increase in the cost of an account, from $8.95 per month to$18.95 per month. A new customer was treated to the bargain rate of $23.95per month. This change had resulted in the loss of many members, of the A2RT as well as from other RT's. This had a particular impact on Genie'sEuropean customers, whose rates became VERY high.      Cuff also had to rescind his previous offer to pay potential GenieLampwriters with credits for online time; the new management had also takenaway that privilege.     In March, GenieLamp A2 was also released as HyperCard and HyperCardand HyperStudio stacks, to a very favorable response. The HyperCard stack(and conversion stack) was written by Joshua Calvin. Although the HyperCardedition did not vary much from the text version, the HyperStudio versionadded a unique feature - a comic strip called "Hog Heaven".     April's editorial saw Cuff announcing an attempt by the new Geniemanagement to retain subscribers. "Genie Lite" offered five free hours ofe-mail use per month, but no free access to the Roundtables, and chargedonly $7.95 for month (compared to the much higher rate for the normal typeof access). However, Yovelle decided that this was not a financiallyattractive proposal, as many users flocked from the higher costsubscriptions to the Genie Lite version, and on May 9, 1996 this option waswithdrawn.     July's issue found GenieLamp A2 as the one remaining GenieLamppublication and that due to the dedication of Doug Cuff in taking the timeto write and edit nearly all of the material in each issue. During thatmonth, Genie management closed down the DigiPub Roundtable. This had been agathering place for writers of the various Genie publications, and withoutthat convenience GenieLamp A2 emerged from the fallout as the lastremaining Lamp digital publication. The strain of doing all of that workeach month, with the additional costs involved in connecting to Genie underits new rates, began to increase his difficulties in continuing in the job.     In October, Cuff discussed his efforts at preserving GEnieLamp A2 bymoving the issues from the DigiPub library before it closed down) anduploading them to the A2 library.     Finally, the GenieLamp A2 masthead exactly the same at the end ofCuff's run as editor as it was at the start of 1996: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////|| GenieLamp Apple II     ~ A T/TalkNET Publication ~      Vol.5, Issue 57||""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""||Publisher................................................John F.

Syndicomm owners Gary Utter and Dean Esmay began to make plans onwhat to do if Genie suddenly disappeared, and in May there appeared thevery first announcement of a new web site, "www.syndicomm.com".     Also related to the change from GEnie to Genie were some A2 RT memberswho said their good-byes, as they moved on to CompuServe or Delphi, wherethe online rates were more reasonable. In July, Delphi was for the firsttime mentioned as a potential alternative to Genie, as Ken Gagne pointedout that it was STILL a text-only service.HARDWARE NEWS     Early in the year, Mike Hackett was working on QuickDraw II supportfor the SecondSight VGA card, in order to make it possible to have the IIGSFinder display correctly on the card. He was somewhat limited by the amountof programming information that Sequential Systems was willing to release,and the apparent unwillingness of the company to do necessary firmwareupdates to improve performance.     Sequential Systems introduced a version of the RamFAST SCSI cardspecifically for use on the Apple IIe with ZipChip. However, it appearedfrom later posts that although it worked fine on a IIGS and on a IIeWITHOUT a ZipChip, it still didn't work reliably WITH a ZipChip.     Alltech released the Sirius 8 meg RAM board.     Mike Westerfield gave a little more information about the Mark Twain("ROM 04") IIGS prototype that had been discovered in Albuquerque. Later inthe year, Joe Kohn made available videotapes of his Gravenstein Apple UserGroup demo of the Mark Twain he had discovered.     Various RT members discussed ways to build a tower version of theApple IIGS (that is, putting the guts of the computer into a tower case),with proposals of various improvements to make it work better.     Resident solder slinger Harold Hislop offered technical informationabout how to repair AppleColor RGB monitors, and how to (temporarily) helpwith "sticktion" problems on aging Quantum hard drives.     Ken Gagne reported on the Tiger Learning Computer, an Apple-approvedApple IIe clone that was to be introduced at the Electronic EntertainmentExpo (E3) in Los Angeles. His brief description was to be followed by amore detailed article in Volume 2, Issue 2 of The Apple Blossom newsletter.     September's issue included information by Doug Pendleton about how tobuild a reliable faster Zip GS card. Also that month, Peter Brickell begana series in which he described ways in which to interface an Apple II with"real world" devices.SOFTWARE NEWS:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::     PMPFax was released late 1995. February discussions revolved aroundways in which to deal with some early bugs in the program.     Brutal Deluxe introduced Convert 3200, a graphics conversion utility.Sales for the product were handled by Shareware Solutions II. SSII also hadbeen granted permission to release disks from NAUG (the disbanded NationalAppleWorks User Group).     Apple II emulation software for the Macintosh began to appear during1996. Steve Cavanaugh commented on his experience with one program called"Squirt", and another called "IIe 1.0". More significantly, Andre Horstmannand Henrik Gudat made an announcement mid-year about an Apple IIGS emulatorthat they were working on. Their software had previously been releasedunder the name "Bright Software", but for this major project they hadchanged the name to "Fast Eddie Labs", since the code-name for the productwas "Fast Eddie". Fast Eddie would require a PowerMac, and although theywere initially asking for alpha testers to assist them, by the end of theyear the emulator was nearing the beta testing stage.     EGO Systems announced an update to Addressed For Success, a labelprinting database program, to v1.1. The company also began to carry theOffice Productivity Systems AppleWorks utilities, including TimeOutShrinkIt-Plus, Statistics, and Disk Tools. Steve Disbrow also began work ona RTF (Rich Text Format) translator for GraphicWriter III. Soon afterwards,an AppleWorks GS translator module was released for GW III.     Other software that became available during 1996 includedTimeOut.Statistics by Office Productivity Software; TouchTwo AppleWorksmacros by Marin MacroWorks; an update of Quick Click Calc to v1.3 by MikeWesterfield and The Byte Works; Music Composer 4.00 by Clayton Juniel; andGraphicWriter III v2.0 by Seven Hills Software.:: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::     Rumors began to appear about one or more programmers who were workingon attempts to design a graphic-based web browser for the Apple IIGS. Themain limitation then (as now) was the processing power needed to displayboth web page textual information AND the graphics for those pages in GIFor JPG format. Also limiting the development of such a product was the lackof basic utilities to directly connect a IIGS to the Internet. GNO/ME 2.0.6was planned to include TCP/IP access, and was expected to be a prerequisiteto IIGS web browsing.     In March, a post was reproduced in which Derek Taubert discussed hisefforts at creating what he called "GS/TCP", an Apple IIGS TCP/IP handler,which was intended to interface with GNO/ME 2.0.6. He had successfully beenable to connect to the Internet with this utility, and was makingimprovements to it, to the great excitement of many Apple II users onGenie. Max Jones of Juiced.GS visited Taubert in May, and also saw "GS Web"demonstrated, Taubert's efforts at a graphic web browser.  Jones planned anarticle all about GS/TCP in the Spring issue of Juiced.GS.:: SYSTEM SOFTWARE ::     Jawaid Bazyar & Dave Lyons released a significant patch for the HFSFST from System 6.0.1. A mysterious data-trashing bug had been plaguingthose trying to use large HFS volumes on the IIGS. The bug had caused adelay in the release of Jim Maricondo's Golden Orchard CD-ROM collection in1995. This single-byte fix resolved this major problem. Dave Lyons, who wasemployed at Apple, had searched out the problem on his own time, and sharedthe info with Jawaid Bazyar, who wrote the patch program to correct it.Although it was distributed as a Procyon product, it was made available asfreeware.     Later in the year, a different HFS problem was in discussion,regarding a problem that would occur if files dragged to an HFS volumeexceeded the available space on that volume. If this happened, a "diskfull" error occurred, and the folder into which the files were beingdragged was corrupted to the extent that it could not be deleted from theFinder.     Back in 1995, Brutal Deluxe had announced their efforts at creatingsource code for GS/OS System 6.0.1, with the goal of applying patches andbug fixes. This "System 6.0.2" was available on a trial basis to a limitedaudience; Joe Kohn was one who had a copy of it, installed on his MarkTwain IIGS. Brutal Deluxe, however, did not take sufficient care to haveextra copies of this effort; it was all lost when a hard drive crashed, andthey apparently felt the task was too much work to reproduce.:: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::     The hack to Print Shop IIGS sought by Joe Kohn that would allow betterprinting was again mentioned in July. The reason that the patch neverappeared was that the graphics in the program were hard-coded to 72 dotsper inch, and increasing the print quality simply was not possible.     A September article by Doug Cuff described how to start fresh with anApple IIGS system, and what programs and utilities to add to a newlycreated system disk to make it most workable and productive. This wasfollowed up in the following month by reader comments about other utilitiesthat they considered indispensable.:: GAMES ::     In January, Vitesse was still promising Wolfenstein 3D to be availablesoon. However, this promise was complicated by the need to get programminghelp from someone other than Bill Heineman (who had started but notcompleted the conversion), and by the demands of id Software for a newcontract. The gradual disappearance of Vitesse from the Apple II worldduring this year also contributed to the problem. The project eventuallyfell to Logicware programmers, specifically Eric Shepherd, and by late inthe year he had a package ready for beta testers.     Other games that appeared in this year were Operation Lambda by BretVictor, and LemminGS by Brutal Deluxe.PUBLICATIONS     Despite the losses of Apple II publications in 1995, other individualsstepped up and did their best to fill the gaps left behind. January saw theannouncement of three new publications: The AppleWorks Gazette, The AppleBlossom, and Juiced.GS.     Howard Katz and Chris Serreau created The AppleWorks Gazette. Releasedas a disk publication with articles and sample files, the first issue wasmailed out in January 1996, and was reviewed by Doug Cuff in the Februaryissue of GenieLamp A2. Their intent was to send out a new issue bi-monthly,but soon fell behind in this goal, distributing only three issues duringthe year.     Steve Cavanaugh had started The Apple Blossom as a freely downloadableproduct for its first four issues in 1995. With the start of 1996 hechanged it to a subscription-based print publication, to be released on abimonthly basis. During 1996 he kept this promise, and produced six issues.(Samples of articles from these issues and other issues are still availableat this web address:http://homepage.mac.com/appleblossom/tab/blossomonline.html) By the end ofthe year Cavanaugh had to abandon his Genie account, though he had plans tocontinue his newsletter.     Newspaper veteran Max Jones also joined the field of new Apple IIpublishers during 1996. Juiced.GS was started as a quarterly printedpublication dedicated to coverage of the Apple IIGS. Initial subscriptionswere priced at $14 per year, and the promised four issues were distributedduring the year.     Joe Kohn's Shareware Solutions II continued to publish. He was alsoable to make available for sale much of the inventory of the defunct BigRed Computer Club, as well as other products.     II Alive, the last remaining glossy print Apple II publication,announced that it was planning about five more issues, after the release ofthe Nov-Dec 1995 issue. The Spring 1996 issue arrived in early summer, andwas reported to be thinner than previous issues. Less money was spent on itthan previously, and after the first quarter of 1996 its former artdirector, Carl Sperber, was acting as editor, with articles being collectedby former reviews editor Jeff Hurlburt.     Another disk magazine, Dark Castle Magazine, was briefly mentioned inMarch, and then never again appeared in GenieLamp. (Being available only inDutch may have had something to do with this.)COMPANIES     Greg Templeman announced the addition of Michael Lutynski (ofAnimasia) to the Logicware programming team, which also included EricShepherd, James Smith, "Burger" Bill Heineman, and Steve Parsons.     ///SHH Systeme, makers of the TurboIDE and BlueDisk cards, was alsoaffected by the change in Genie rates. Being based in Munich, Germany madethem subject to the costs of European access, which had undergone aconsiderable increase. Consequently, they moved their online support to theInternet and to CompuServe.     During the latter half of the year, an increased numbers of postsappeared in the A2 Roundtable complaining about Sequential Systems, due toa lack of response to customer requests (or complaints) regarding theSecond Sight card.     EGO Systems and Steve Disbrow had to announce the cessation of itstoll-free order line and a reduction of hours, primarily because of hisreal employment interfering with what had been forced to become aside-business.KANSASFEST     Doug Cuff's article, "The Accidental Tourist At KansasFest", appearedin the July issue, providing the first official FAQ about the event.     Attendance at the event that year was over two hundred. Gary Uttergave a stirring and memorable keynote speech, and the subject of the annualroast was Joe Kohn. Roger Wagner (even though he was unable to attend) andMike Westerfield sponsored pizza. Attendees Carl Knoblock and "Big Cheese"Cindy Adams were among those whose posted comments about the event appearedin GenieLamp in the August issue.     Among the presenters were Andy Nicholas of Apple Computer, whodemonstrated "Gus", an Apple IIGS emulator for the Power Macintosh. EricShepherd announced the coming beta test of Wolfenstein 3D, and that thefinal product would be released as freeware, rather than as the commercialproduct that Vitesse had originally intended it to be.     Seven Hills Software announced the Spectrum 2.1 update, which wasavailable to ship by September.REVIEWS     Despite a dearth of contributing writers, there were quite a fewproduct reviews that appeared in GenieLamp A2 during the year:o Jay Curtis reviewed "Deja II", JEM Software's newly released AppleWorks5.0 emulator.o James Keim, Ed Lundberg, and Douglas Cuff all reviewed the teachingprogram "Where In Hell Is Carmen Santiago?", which had been designed toteach about Dante's "Inferno". This unusual method of having three peoplereview the same program resulted in a very interesting look at the productfrom more than a single point of view.o Charlie Hartley reviewed PostScript fonts available in the Apple IILibrary, along with an interview of Margot Taylor, who had uploaded many ofthe fonts.     Cuff was the source of most of the rest of the reviews that wereprinted:o The AppleWorks Gazette, issue #1o The Apple Blossomo Juiced.GSo "In The Breach Of Centuries" and "Sounds Of History" (HyperStudio stacks)o GraphicWriter III v2.0, (rewritten) by Richard Bennetto LoadPall XCMD for HyperCard IIGS by Steve Cavanaugho Convert 3200, from Brutal Deluxeo Beagle Basico Sorry (game)o Lordlings Of Yoreo Wolfenstein 3D     Cuff also started a new column in February, a Top Ten list of the mostpopular files in the GEnie A2 library. The list was based on the number ofdownloads of a file, after it had been in the library for about a month.Thus, the February list dealt with December's uploads, and so on. Beginningwith the March issue, he also began offering brief reviews of new uploadsto the A2 library.WRITERS     Phil Shapiro concluded his "Thinking About" series with a discussionof the use of mailing lists to share common interests, including nursinghomes in the national information infrastructure, and the convenience ofautomated e-mail responders.     In additional to his other responsibilities, Doug Cuff presented theDelta manual for the AppleWorks 5.1 update in the July issue.     David Marriott wrote about "The Disposable Computer", referring to thetendency for computers to be in need of replacement every several years.INTERVIEWS     Fewer of these appeared during 1996, but included the following:o Max Jones, of Juiced.GSo Steve Cavanaugh, of The Apple Blossomo Christian Serreau and Howard Katz, of The AppleWorks GazetteMISCELLANEOUS FEATURES     In April, a number of messages were reprinted about the use of AppleII's in businesses.     Editor Cuff wrote an interesting article in the August. "FileMechanic" took the approach of explaining how to modify an old BASICprogram in the A2 library so it was functional on the Apple IIGS and underProDOS, taking the reader step by step through the process.     Cuff also wrote in October about the Apple II BBS that he ran for fouryears in the 1980's. In November he presented his own history ofGenieLamp's first five years.     David Kerwood described his plans to create a web site that would be acentral repository of information about the Apple II and support for it.     Marc Wolfgram reported in December that former A2Pro sysop MarkCollins had passed away from a massive stroke. The two had collaborated onseveral Apple IIGS projects, including "Lithium Grease" (which could saveand restore IIGS battery RAM settings from a disk) and the GS/OS resourceeditor, "Foundation".HUMOR ONLINE     Ryan Suenaga listed his Top Ten things to do when GEnie was down. TimKellers gave his own top ten list of why to attend KansasFest.     In March, the "Apple II Brainwash Test" was printed. Gary Utter andMike Westerfield teamed up to create "You Know You've Been On Genie TooLong When..."     Several more song parodies that I wrote appeared during the year(which are now reproduced on the Apple II History website athttp://apple2history.org/parodies/parodies.html).     Jerry Cline pointed out a way of getting free 3.5 floppy disks simplyby NOT signing up for America Online (i.e., you continue to receive in themail those disks encouraging you to sign up).     Alan Meiss' "Some Famous Last Words" appeared in December (his humoris still available at this web site: http://www.aaaugh.com/meiss/humor.htmlSTATS     Here are statistics for the first five years of GEnieLamp. The numbersrefer to the size of each issue in "K" (kilobytes):Year    Min     Max     Avg----    ----    ----    ----1992    116K    212K    156K1993     80K    256K    172K1994    124K    216K    165K1995     92K    176K    125K1996     80K    192K    116K19TH NERVOUS BREAKDOWN     As I write these concluding words, my lovely PowerBook G4 remains inthe hands of the competent physicians at the Apple Service Center, awaitingits next logic board transplant. I'm quite hopeful that THIS time it willnot be rejected. In the meantime, I think I'm getting the hang of thishistorical writing stuff again, and so I'll do my best to get the nextchapter in the Lamp review ready for you. Even if I'm to do it with asecond-best choice.Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.orgReferences for 1996 historical info:Apple Computer, Inc.: A History     http://www.geocities.com/Athens/3682/applehistory.htmlApple History Timeline     http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/history.htmlThe Apple Museum     http://applemuseum.bott.org/Computer History For 1990-2000     http://www.computerhope.com/history/19902000.htmHistory of Computing Industrial Era 1994-2000     http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1996.htmInformation Please: 1996     http://infoplease.lycos.com/year/1996.htmlTimeline of the 90s, 1996     http://www.inthe90s.com/generated/time1996.shtml[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][SCO]SyndiChat 1.1"""""""""""""Announcing - SyndiChat 1.1What is it?SyndiChat is a RTC chat program for Syndicomm Syndicated Communities thatrequires a PC running Window 95 or better.Features- Selectable font size from 6 to 15 points. <-- NEW FEATURE- Simple installation and configuration.- Basic telnet client with separate chat window.- Resizable window with auto line length adjustment.- 30,000 character scrollback buffer.- Scrollback search.SyndiChat is freeware.Where do you get it?http://www.syndicomm.com/~mark/SyndiChat/Enjoy!(MARK, HelpDesk, Cat 3, Top 4, Msg 16)[EOA][AOS]Announcing the Opening of Showbits""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Announcing the opening of Showbits!
