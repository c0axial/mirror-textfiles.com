A great day for a drive in the country with lunch at a favoriterestaurant as a destination.     Highway 2 meanders south along the Rock River.  We stop every fewmiles at one of the turnoffs to get a close view of the river.  A climb tothe top of Castle Rock is especially inspiring.     Twenty some miles to the south we stop at Maxon's RiversideRestaurant.     John Maxon established Maxon's Manor in a beautiful old house fiftysome years ago.  The large enclosed porch, which faced the river, served asthe dinning room.  This afforded the diners a fabulous view.  Thecenterpiece of the view was a statue of Chief Blackhawk standing on a cliffHigh Above The Rock River.  By adding great food and great service to thisatmosphere, he established a large and loyal base of customers.     When Mr. Maxon reached retirement age he sold the restaurant.Business went well for the new owners.  Then one night tragedy struck...the house which provided the special atmosphere of the restaurant burned tothe ground.     Eventually another building was built.  It is a rustic building thatgoes well with the site.  The dinning room is built on two levels, oneabout four feet above the other.  The riverside wall is almost all glass.This takes full advantage of the same great view the original houseprovided.     Add great food and great service to the present building and you havea winning combination.                            Going Out to Dinner                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     KFesters go out to dinner a couple of times during KFest.  Dinner atthe K.C. Masterpiece is quite enjoyable.  They have an uncanny ability toprovide seating at this busy restaurant for all of us Apple II enthusiasts.Seating is at tables of four to six.  This provides a nice sized group ofpeople for you to become better acquainted with.  The food is great.  Yourglass of iced tea will never run dry.     Come join us at KFest this year.

It is better now since Geoff has releasedGW-FTP v1.1b4 and also upgrading Spectrum to v2.5.3 so that I can run SAFE.However after reading Ryan's article in Juiced.GS V8I4 about setting up aLocaltalk bridge on a Mac, I decided to try it out using a Macintosh7200/90 as a Localtalk Bridge and a Windows 2000 Advanced Server for a fileserver that I'm using for a course I'm taking.  Win2KAS has MacintoshFile/Print Services available so I though that would give me a nice centralplace to store files that would be accessible by my entire home network.Setting up File/Print services was easy enough on the Win2KAS box.  Theonly thing not obvious was how to set up a shareable folder for Appletalk.After poking around the help files, I found a CLI based utility called"Macfile" that was able to create a share for Appletalk.  Initially I waspretty disappointed that there wasn't a GUI interface but I think I found away to do that afterwards.The next step was setting up Localtalk Bridge on the Macintosh 7200/90.Re-reading Ryan's article made it real easy.  I was also able to test thatthe Mac could see and mount the Win2KAS volumes so I knew that was workingfine.The last step was setting up Appleshare on the Apple IIgs and it was herethat I started to run into problems.  On my ROM 3, setting slot 2 toLocaltalk, installing the Appleshare software from System 6.0.1 andconnecting the cable between the Mac and the IIgs was easy enough. Oncethat was done I was able to see the Mac with the IIgs's Chooser, but notthe Win2KAS box.  I thought this was strange since the Mac could see theWin2KAS box but for some reason wasn't passing that over the LocaltalkBridge.  I had the feeling that I might be cooked. :/Playing around with the Mac I found out that if I rebooted the Mac that theWin2KAS did show up in the IIgs's Chooser for a few seconds beforedisappearing.  If I was quick I could select it and attempt to log in.However doing this resulted in a "unknown login sequence" error from theIIgs.  This didn't look good so I decided to Google it and see if anyoneelse had similar problems.The best information I got was from Google's usenet archive.  What I foundout was that I actually had two problems not related to each other.1) The Win2KAS box not showing up in Chooser.2) The "unknown login sequence" error.The first item ended up pretty easily addressable.  The problem was thatLocaltalk Bridge, for whatever reason, didn't pass Win2KAS serversproperly.  The work around for this was to configure Win2KAS to enableAppletalk routing and set up an Appletalk zone.  Once I did this theWin2KAS server was able to be seen by the IIgs all the time.The second issue was a little more difficult to determine what to do.However after searching around I discovered that a lady named MarshaJackson had run into the same problem accessing her Linux box runningNetatalk.  What she did, to my amazement, was to disassemble System 6.0.1'sAppleshare CDEV and debug it.  She identified the problem, fixed the CDEVand posted it on her website.  I downloaded it and tried it out.  Bingo!After all of this I can now use Windows 2000 Advanced Server as a centralfile repository accessible by everything.  I'm so happy that I'm writing abig, long post to Syndicomm's BB for posterity.  :) Mark Percival - Apprentice Delivered by Spectrum v2.5.3 & SOAR v1.0b11 The Apple ][ Fanatic and Wednesday Night RTC Host "Midweek Madness!" from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM Pacific Time(MARK, Cat 10, Top 6, Msg 45)>>>>>"""""Very interesting Mark.  I've put on my list setting something like that up,I just have never had all the correct hardware pieces.Does using Appletalk add much in the way of overhead to a system?  Causemore crashes make things run more sluggishly etc?  I've used LocalTalkbefore, I just haven't used it much.Thanks,Dain(A2.DAIN, Cat 10, Top 6, Msg 46)>>>>>"""""Appletalk is an interrupt based process so it does require a little bit ofprocessing power when it is active.  Under normal accelerated GS use suchas the Finder, editing files, etc., there is no noticeable difference whenit is running compared to when it is not.It is most noticeable when running another highly intensive interrupt basedprocesses such as Marinetti.  TCP/IP will slow down significantly, butstill be usable.Running Appletalk software on the GS will not directly make it moreunstable to use.  If you are using buggy software that stomps on memorythat it shouldn't, then having Appletalk around is another potential areathat can get affected resulting in a system crash.Apple engineers were always running Appletalk so I would trust its overallstability.  And for a network architecture that was built into the GSalmost 18 years ago, it is cool to see that it not only works, but worksgreat.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 10, Top 6, Msg 47)[EOA][MWS]MANAGING WEB SITES""""""""""""""""""As determined uptopic, the web server I employ supports ASP, but not PHP.I asked someone to write me a routine in ASP.  He gave it to me inJavaScript.  Are there any advantages or disadvantages to this method?If I decided to use the JavaScript version, is there a way to include thedefinition routine in the header of all my HTML files, without manuallyinserting it into each one?

As Tony showed me in message 10 of this topic, I've used<!--#include virtual="filename.html"--> statements before, and waswondering if something similar could be done with JavaScript.  Ideally, I'dinclude the JavaScript file reference in a file already being included, butthe only such file in my HTML header is a .css file, which probably won'taccept JavaScript.To create the site.js file you suggested, Kelvin, I had to remove the firstand last lines of the JavaScript routine, which were<!--and// -->Now the script works - most of the time, in Safari.  It always works iniCab and MSIE.  Odd.I wonder if it is better to go with ASP.

Users with slow devices such as amodems, slower systems, etc. will see a decrement in page generation whenit has to retrieve separate pieces.  Web servers should be considered fastso they can do that processing much more quickly.As you noted already, the Javascript solution can be flaky--so if theinformation is important, you probably don't want to use the Javascriptmethod. You can probably find the ASP solution that you are looking for byusing google with a search of: "asp reference" "include file"Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 11, Top 29, Msg 90)[EOA][SCI]PORT THE SCI ENGINE TO THE IIgs?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I found an Open Source SCI engine at http://freesci.linuxgames.com/ .  Whatis SCI you ask?  It is the engine which the newer (1989 and later) SierraOnline adventure games used.  Word was that Sierra was working on an enginefor the IIgs at one time, but stopped development due to poor IIgs salesand that the IIgs hardware was not fast enough to run a common platformengine.Now that we have accelerators and emulators which speed up the IIgs,running the newer Sierra Online games should not be an issue.  Are thereany takers who would want to port the SCI engine to the IIgs?Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 14, Top 2, Msg 68)>>>>>"""""In the past, I have thought about attempting to port one of the SCI enginesto the IIgs, or one of the AGI engines (AGI was used for KQ 1-4, SQ,goldrush, and other sierra games that were available on the IIgs).I think they had 2 generations of SCI.

I am not talking about the huge toyluggers sold today, the ones that require you to use your whole arm tocontrol them.Rather, Ibm talking about the old ones that offered high precision becausethe stick was small enough to control with the thumb and forefinger. Theone you used playing Archon II, BoulderDash, and Stellar 7. The ones thathaven't been sold for about a decade. Those joysticks.So, where are they today? Wanting to get a brand new backup to my agingMach I (a 10-year old PC joystick converted to work on the Apple II), aswell as a similar style joystick for the PC, I had to search long and hard.It turns out, all the parts for these old-school joysticks are still made,and in fairly large quantities. Nowadays, they are just used for high-endmedical applications and to fly jet fighters. Imagine that! While kids areenjoying Combat Flight Simulator their toy "fighter sticks", many real jetfighters are using the same type of joystick many of us grew up with.(Personally, I prefer a yoke to a stick for PC flight sims, but that isanother topic).Here is the poop: you can build your own Mach II or Mach III replica forthe Apple II for about $140. The casing and assembly is still made, andavailable from CH Products. Together, they will cost you $127. Here is therecipe for a brand new Mach II:Ingredients:* 1 OEM component, part # C100B0J-CJ from CH Products.* 1 old serial cable with male (pins, not holes) connector.* Cord sheath OR hot glue gun.* Soldering iron w/ solder.* Volt Meter/Continuity tester.* Wire stripper, or sharp knife1. Order a C100B0J-CJ from CH Products. You can visit their OEM website,and click the "Traditional" link at the left. You should see somefamiliar-looking sticks. This model will give you the assembly and housingfor a Mach II.2. Get yourself an old serial cable with a male connector (meaning withpins, not holes). You may want to try to get a base sheath to protect therubber at the point it enters the joystick casing. Hot glue will work, butit can be messy. Apply the sheathing to the cord, leaving enough slack inthe wiring to get to the various connector points.3. This is the most effort-intensive step. You will need to strip andsolder the appropriate wires to the correct terminals. At this point, ithelps to have a reference Apple II joystick, as you can simply open it upand test continuity between the terminal pins that plug into the CPU andthe various connection points on the joystick potentiometers and buttons.Wiring diagrams are also available on the web.4. Put the housing back together. This should consist of tightening fourscrews.Voila! One brand new Apple II joystick, for years of enjoyment.As a variation, you should be able to build a Mach III replica exactly asabove, with one extra button to connect. You would need to decide whetherit is to be Button 0 or 1.If enough people were interested in this, we could order the CH Productsparts in bulk and reduce costs considerably&(GPH_II, Cat 17, Top 20, Msg 1)>>>>>"""""Looks pretty cool, but which stick did you put in the housing?Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 17, Top 20, Msg 2)>>>>>"""""I did this years ago, when it was much cheaper.

One of his most popular fictionseries told stories of a galactic empire in the far distant future, onewhose duration spanned many thousands of years. In a three-book setpublished in the early 1950's, "Foundation", "Foundation And Empire", and"Second Foundation", Asimov told of a time in which this empire was indecline, heading to an unstoppable regression into barbarism. Amathematician named Hari Seldon had devised the science of "psychohistory",a complex set of equations that helped him make this prediction of declineand fall. His equations furthermore forecast that it would take thirtyTHOUSAND years until things improved and a new galactic empire rose again.However, Seldon also found that by manipulating events in just a smallfashion here or there it was possible to alter this impending disaster,much as making a slight adjustment in steering a car on a highway couldminimize or avoid an accident. If he could arrange the right conditions, hefound that it would be possible for the interregnum between the first andsecond galactic empires to be reduced to a mere ONE thousand years. Heplanned for a small group of scientists to be placed on a resource-poorworld at the edge of the galaxy, isolated from most of the rest of theevents happening at the central galactic capital world. As this center ofpower for millions of worlds deteriorated and fell to nothing, hisFoundation would grow and flourish, the predetermined events pushing themalong to the desired future.     What I enjoyed about these stories was seeing how events wouldprogress for the small group of people Seldon had placed on Terminus, theplanet at the edge of the galaxy. Problems would arise, they would findtheir choices of action constricted to the point where only one possiblepath lay ahead of them, and that path pushed them along to the next step onthe road back to that new galactic empire. And after the crisis would pass,a holographic recording of Seldon himself, made before the Foundation wasestablished, would appear in the Time Vault he had placed on Terminus. Hisrecording would tell them about the events that had just happened, eventswhich he had already predicted many years earlier. It was satisfying seeinghow events didn't just "happen", but happened in a way that Seldon alreadyhad known and anticipated.     Although I do not have the use of Seldon's psychohistorical equationsto predict a FUTURE Apple II historical path, I do have the benefit ofreading the events of the PAST through the eyes of those who wrote aboutand recorded them in each issue of GEnieLamp A2 and The Lamp! And myreading tells me that there was just something about this year 2000 thatseemed to be a turning point. It was a transition from the state of beingmoved here or there by powers over which we had no control (Apple Computer,GEnie/Genie, America Online, CompuServe, or even Delphi) to a state oftaking control and determining the future ourselves. As with any event, ittook the actions of leaders who had a vision, but also the cooperation ofmany others to make the vision a reality. And the reality was of a placewhere the creative minds that still guarded the legacy of the Apple IIcould meet and share ideas to keep the platform alive and functioning.     But I am getting ahead of myself. As the new century opened on January1, 2000, and the world was relieved to learn that all civilization had notcome crashing down in flames due to the Y2K bug, the Apple II had continuedto chug merrily along. It was not directly affected by the calendar changeany more than it had been during the prior twenty-three years. Those whoused AppleWorks for their word processing, ProTERM for telecommunications,or Print Shop for greeting cards and posters barely noticed the newmillennium, at least as far as their computers were concerned.ROCKIN' PNEUMONIA AND THE BOOGIE WOOGIE FLU     World events that shaped the year 2000 included the crash of theConcorde jet near Paris in July, killing 113 passengers. Yugoslavianpresident Slobodon Milosevic was ousted from power by a national uprising.Terrorists attacked the U.S. naval destroyer Cole while it was in Yemen.The stock market, after the boom of the 1990's, began to turn around andstart a decline. The U.S. presidential election results were delayed forweeks, awaiting recounts done by hand in Dade County, Florida. EventuallyGeorge W. Bush was declared the winner, amid much controversy. AmericaOnline, riding high on the Internet boom, bought media giant Time-Warnerfor $165 billion, creating AOL Time-Warner.     In the computer world, Bill Gates turned over his title of CEO toMicrosoft president Steve Ballmer. Microsoft Windows 2000, a blend of theirnetwork and personal versions of the operating system, was released inFebruary. Bill Clinton made the first-ever webcast of a presidentialspeech. The first 1 GHz AMD and Intel Pentium processors began to appear onthe market. "Denial of service" attacks on major web sites begin to be aproblem.     Apple Computer's iCEO (interim CEO) Steve Jobs announces at theMacWorld Expo in January that he was taking on the job of CEO on apermanent basis. The "Pismo" PowerBook made its debut in 400 and 500 MHzversions, and was the first PowerBook to be released without a SCSI port.The Power Mac G4 Cube was released mid-year, and new dual processor PowerMacintosh G4 desktop units became available. The iMac colors were changedto ruby, indigo, sage and snow, at similar 400 to 500 MHz processor speeds.The long-promised next generation operating system, Mac OS X, appeared inSeptember in the form of a public beta.THE LAMP! INFO     The year started with a new editor, Lyle Syverson, as mentioned inthis article last time. Syverson was an Apple II veteran of over twelveyears. He got his start with the Apple II through his position as achemistry lab tech at Rock Valley College in the city of Rockford in northcentral Illinois. When he started there in 1987, one of hisresponsibilities was to manage an inventory of over seven hundredchemicals. This was done on an Apple IIe running AppleWorks 1.2. He likedusing the program so well that he eventually purchased a Laser 128 for hisown use at home.     To supplement his knowledge of his new computer, Syverson startedreading Apple II magazines. Their enthusiastic reports of the wonders ofthe online world prompted him to invest further in a 2400-baud modem, whichhe bought by mail order in 1993. It came "complete with cable andsoftware", but refused to work properly for him. He decided to purchaseTalk Is Cheap (TIC) by mail order, and was finally able to connect to alocal bulletin board system. That was enough to hook him, and after oneevening online, he sent in his shareware fee for TIC. He then tackled GEnieand learned of the significantly improved 4.0 version of TIC that was soonto be released. The author allowed him to apply the shareware fee to theupdated version.     GEnie was a fun experience for Syverson, further increasing hisknowledge of the Apple II. He found it great to be able to post a question,then log back in an hour later and already find two or three answers. Hefound it somewhat of a challenge to keep up with the volume of traffic onthe A2 Roundtable, and used to keep a pile of 5.25-inch disks on hand touse in saving the TIC message buffer when it got full.     At the time of the release of System 6.0.1 on GEnie, he was able toupgrade to an Apple IIGS. With some effort, he downloaded the six disks (at2400 baud, 75 minutes per disk image) one at a time to a RAM disk, which hethen unpacked to a 3.5-inch disk.     With the 1996 transition of GEnie to Genie, and its significant priceincreases, Syverson escaped to CompuServe's APPUSER forum, and was able tostay there until early 1999 when its text access was terminated. He thenmade the move to Delphi A2, where many Apple II faithful were migrating asthe shakeouts in the online world continued.     Though he had not previously had any experience with newsletters,Syverson had been a regular reader of GEnieLamp A2 and The Lamp! He hadnoticed Ryan Suenaga's request for an editor to take his place, and withhis impending retirement in the summer of 1999, he wrote and asked to beconsidered for the job. Ryan accepted his offer, and with the January 2000issue, the newsletter was Syverson's.     He started his first issue with the same editorial column title"Opening Pitch" that Suenaga had used during his run as editor. By thesecond issue, however, Syverson settled on a more personal title. At thetime, he was living in the Skyrise Apartments in Rockford, which waslocated on the west bank of the Rock River that ran through town. Thisinspired him to make his own editorial title, "High Above The Rock River".     The new Lamp masthead read as: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::||The Lamp!            An Onipa'a Software Production        Vol. 3, No. 1||::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::||Publisher................................Ryan M. Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.||Editor.....................................................Lyle Syverson||Internet Email, Publisher.........................thelamp@sheppyware.net||Internet Mail, Editor.................................lyle837@delphi.com||::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::||________________________________________________________________________|     By the end of the year, the only change of note in the masthead wasSyverson's address change to "lyle@FoxValley.net", apparently to reducedependence on Delphi for his e-mail.     Starting as new editor of The Lamp!, Syverson took the opportunity tomake some modifications to the format. Whereas Suenaga's layout had been aclose copy of the classic GEnieLamp A2 format, renaming the columns, butotherwise using them the same way, Syverson made some further adjustmentsto suit his own style. Instead of "A Funny Thing Happened", where themessages from Delphi were reprinted, he chose to call this section first"The Innings" (staying with the baseball motif), and then in his secondissue "A2 Distillations". Another change was a more frequent use of thethree-letter index symbols. Where previous editors used these only for aspecific article, and had only a single index code for ALL of the reprintedforum messages, Syverson made these codes more specific by assigning adifferent one to each individual topic, even in the A2 Distillationssection. The advantage of this was the ability to specifically find anarticle by its index code (when in the future an index might finally bemade).     In August it was announced that The Lamp! back issues now had anadditional home on a subdomain of the Sheppyware.net server.DELPHI A2 FORUM     Joe Kohn continued his weekly Monday Night Chat events, sadly reducedin size from the multi-system events of past years.     Delphi, the last of the old-style online services to still offertext-based access was making changes that it was hoping would help itsurvive in the Internet tidal wave that had swept away other services. Inthe new digital world where web access was THE way to do things online,Delphi had successfully been adding access to its forums via a web-basedinterface, attempting to modify itself to appeal to both the old and newonline computer user. The management was trying various ways to maintainincome, but was apparently finding it to be a struggle. They had a "PremiumPlan", but it was no longer available beginning in May. Technical glitcheswere also becoming more of a problem, with the service being unable toconsistently keep the text and web sides of the forums reliably in syncwith each other.     Finally, there was a good news/bad news announcement by Delphimanagement in August. The good news was that as of November 1, 2000 Delphiservices would no longer be billed. The bad news was that after that datetheir "legacy services" (which included text-based access) would continuebut would not be supported. For those who connected to Delphi by telnet,this meant that any day after the end of October the access to this latestA2 home could be threatened.GENIE INFO     After January 1, 2000 arrived, the old text-based Genie was completelygone, and the "new" Genie was running. This new service was completelyweb-based. It still offered some dial-in options (though not to the extentthat it had in the past), and that now at speeds up to 56K. According to ausenet post on alt.online-service.genie by Andy Finkenstadt (who had beenwith GEnie from the beginning), there were many problems with the newservice. Any e-mail from the old system was completely gone; the contenthad been ported "imperfectly and haphazardly" to www.genie.com, and eventhen did not completely function there. Users who DID go to the web sitedid not see any announcement of the end of the old service, and found thatsome of the links (such as the one for e-mail) did not even work.     Several people found themselves continuing to receive bills on theirbank statements for Genie Online, even though they were not using (andcould not use) the new service. One person who posted his story on theabove-mentioned usenet newsgroup tried calling the customer service number.He was told that an e-mail had been sent in April 1998 (!!) and on December27, 1999 telling about the changes in the service, and offered to get him ausername and password for the new service. He had previously tried to sendthem e-mail at the end of December asking about the changes; the customerservice representative told him that they would have to look for it beforeany of the new charges on his account could be refunded. Days passedwithout any contact from Genie about his question, and when he finally WASable to talk to them again, he was told that since his e-mail did notspecifically ask for cancellation of his account he would not be issued arefund. Although he finally DID cancel his membership, he was unable to geta refund on the charges that had been already been collected.A2CENTRAL.COM / SYNDICOMM     Syndicomm had originally been founded by Tom Weishaar to manage theApple II Roundtables on GEnie. Around 1992, when it began to branch out tosome of the non-Apple II online areas (the Macintosh and PowerPCRoundtables), Weishaar sold the operation to Dean Esmay and Gary Utter. Atits height, Syndicomm was responsible for the management of ten to twelveforums each on GEnie and Delphi, two on America Online, and had contractsto administrate online helpdesk services. Over the years, of course, theAOL and GEnie connection faltered and failed, and during 2000 Delphi waslooking shaky as well. By this time, Esmay had not been active in thebusiness for a while, and Utter was having health problems that limited hisinvolvement. He was looking for an opportunity to get out of directoperation of Syndicomm.     Delphi, which had been hailed as a safe haven from the long, slowdeath spiral of Genie, was itself showing disturbing signs of instability(as mentioned above). Its long-term plan was apparently to change from aservice that itself hosted specific, moderated forums to one that was moremember-based, where ANYBODY could start a forum if they wished. Moreimportantly, the end of support for text-based access on November 1, 2000had the potential to be a big problem for those Apple II users who stillneeded text access.     In June of 2000, Eric Shepherd had started his own Apple II-relatedweb site, www.A2Central.com. He had picked the name because of some othersites that he had seen on the Internet, such as MacCentral.com andBeOSCentral.com. It occurred to him that an A2Central.com web site wasneeded, and registered the domain as soon as he thought of it. It was notuntil later, when he was beta-testing the site that a comment came fromsomeone on Delphi that it might be confused with the newsletter"A2-Central" started years earlier by Tom Weishaar. Regardless, Sheppyliked the name and decided to keep it.     When Sheppy first started the A2Central.com web site, its purpose wasto be a collection of articles, reviews, press releases, suggestions andtidbits of use to Apple II users. Within a month of the launch of the site,he was envisioning a broader role for it, including the addition of amessage board, chat room, and an area for files accessible via FTP. Whileat KansasFest in July, Sheppy discussed the A2Central.com expansion inprivate with Gary Utter and Dave Miller. Utter enthusiastically supportedhis plans, and went so far as to ask Sheppy to take over Syndicomm. At thattime, however, he declined the offer.     After the event was over, and Sheppy was back home in California, heand Ryan Suenaga discussed Gary Utter's offer. As they considered thepossibilities, he decided that it made sense to accept it. However, herealized that in order to make it work as a business it would be necessaryto widen his vision beyond the Apple II. Out of this came the concept ofhosting a variety of forums dedicated to several different computerplatforms or topics -- in actuality, creating an online service thatemulated the best of GEnie and Delphi at their prime. Making this work as abusiness would require a good business name; "Syndicomm" worked well, andhad favorable recognition within the Apple II community. Additionally, itprovided the benefits of an experienced and dedicated volunteer staff.Sheppy contacted Utter and Esmay and began to negotiate the purchase ofSyndicomm. The deal was completed on November 1, 2000.     Sheppy chose a DSL connection to the Internet for A2Central.com andSyndicomm.com, as it was less expensive than a T1 type of connection, andcould have its bandwidth adjusted as the customer base changed. When hefirst started the A2Central.com web site in June, it ran on a BeBox Dual/66computer, using the BeOS R3 operating system, on his own personal DSLconnection. Within two weeks, the traffic had increased to the point wherethe hardware had to be upgraded to handle the load, so he changed to arefurbished Pentium 133, this time using Red Hat Linux 6.2 as its operatingsystem. Another older PC functioned as a firewall. With further growth ofthe system and his Syndicomm expansion plans beginning to take shape, hemoved the system to its own dedicated DSL connection by the fall of 2000.     The design of the A2Central.com web site had been done entirely bySheppy. In order to make an online service that would act like GEnie orDelphi a different approach was required . Dave Miller, using the Perllanguage and MySQL databases, designed a front end for the multi-forumSyndicomm.com site that would allow web access to forums, but would alsohave text-based telnet access to satisfy most Apple II users needs. In thefirst part of October, he designed chat rooms that worked like GEnie's"Real Time Conference" rooms. During the rest of October and into November,Miller worked on creating the bulletin boards (forums).     All of this was happening behind the scenes. A press release inDecember finally announced the sale of Syndicomm to Sheppy, and furtherstated that Dean Esmay and Gary Utter planned to continue to be involved inthe operations of the company under its new ownership. By December 8, 2000,the Syndicomm.com service was ready for an open beta test, which ranthrough the end of the month. The open-beta launch of the service wasaccompanied by "door prizes" for those who first entered some of the RealTime Conference rooms. After the start of the new year, membership would bepriced at $15 per month, which included 10 megabytes of personal disk spaceon the Syndicomm server.     A2Central.com continued to exist as the web-face of Syndicomm A2.During September, the cost of improvements to the web site was supplementedby income from an eBay auction of a never-used RamWorks III card. Sheppyalso got the site officially licensed by Apple for distribution of Apple IIsystem software, and was also authorized to make the software available inarchive formats useful to Apple II users (not just the Macintosh Disk Copyformat as it would be found on the Apple Computer FTP site). By November,the web site was offering Apple II system and starter kit disks, and had anonline store that worked through the Kagi ordering system. Items soldinitially were ComputerEyes GS video capture cards (still available todayin 2004!), and the A2-Central Font Collection.     As Syndicomm.com started operations, A2Central.com continued to existas what it was originally designed to be -- a web site with articles,reviews, etc., while the real interactive experience was on the Syndicommforums.HARDWARE NEWS     Most of the hardware news that appeared in The Lamp! during 2000involved re-education of new users about old hardware.o February saw discussion of available RGB monitors that could be used asreplacements for the Apple IIGS monitors if they went bad.o March posts reviewed RamFAST cards and ways to get them updated. Variouslarge-capacity floppy disk alternatives (floptical and magneto-opticaldrives) were also discussed, as was the Laser 128 and its various models.The care of cables for the ZipGSX was presented in the March issue. Alsofielded were questions about the PC Transporter.o April saw Tony Ward explaining distinctions between and uses of the AppleII Super Serial Card and the Turbo ASB baud rate generator. MitchellSpector described modifications that could be made to the Apple IIc.o In May, the hot topic of discussion was how to create a "SuperGS"computer, with the pros and cons debated back and forth.o June reviewed the Apple IIGS battery and its replacement.o August discussions involved the use of hard drives on an Apple II Plus,and available models of CD-ROM drives for the Apple IIGS. In addition, theNo Slot Clock resurfaced as a topic (as it had previously in The Lamp! in1998).o During September, Ryan Suenaga wrote an article that described the AppleIIc modem cable, and how to build one. The Forum discussed faster CD-ROMdrives.o October's big news was the release of more information about a new pieceof hardware. An Ethernet card for the Apple IIe and IIGS was released by///SHH Systeme, the creators of the BlueDisk and TurboIDE cards. ThisEthernet card, called "LANceGS", made it possible to connect an Apple IIeor IIGS to an Ethernet network. Full file-sharing in GS/OS was not possiblewith the card as was possible with an AppleTalk connection, since theoperating system had not been designed to support it. However, filetransfer could be done via FTP with terminal software, and connection tothe Internet was possible using Marinetti.o November's messages highlighted various models of sound cards for theApple IIGS.o And in December, Ryan Suenaga wrote a followup to his September articleabout modem cables. This time the topic featured the Apple IIe with a SuperSerial Card.EMULATOR NEWS     Sheppy updated the Sweet16 Apple IIGS emulator to v1.3, then quicklyto 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. Version 1.5 was released in May, and 1.5.1 bySeptember.      F.E. Systems updated their Macintosh-based IIGS emulator Bernie ][ TheRescue to v2.6. This version added "CataDog", a Finder-like disk-catalogingfeature that made it easier to browse ProDOS disks outside of the emulatedcomputer. This was soon followed by a 2.5.9 version, as it had beendiscovered that v2.6 was not compatible with some older versions of the Macoperating system (those prior to Mac OS 8.5). At KansasFest 2000 an upgradeto v3.0 of Bernie ][ The Rescue was announced.SOFTWARE NEWS:: COLLECTIONS ::     A common announcement to appear during 2000 was that of yet anothercollection on CD-ROM of Apple II software of one type or another. RyanSuenaga announced at KansasFest a collection called "Time In A Bottle", atwo-disc CD collection of Syndicomm's A2 and A2Pro libraries from thenow-defunct Genie. Juiced.GS got into the act with a CD-ROM called "TheCompleat Lamp!", which contained all issues of GEnieLamp A2, GEnieLampA2Pro and The Lamp! in every format in which they had ever been released.Joe Kohn announced a two-CD-ROM collection from France, "DeluxeWare" and"Le CD-ROM", both from Brutal Deluxe.     Mike Westerfield inquired as to whether or not there was sufficientinterest in a CD-ROM containing all of The Byte Works products. Havingreceived a positive response, he decided to move forward with the project.By December, "Opus ][" was ready to ship, containing every Apple II programever released by The Byte Works, including sixteen never-releasedapplications. The Lamp! that month included two long articles byWesterfield describing the collection.:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::     Gareth Jones put together an FAQ (which is still available) aboutWordPerfect IIe and IIGS athttp://www.intergate.ca/personal/gslj/wp.faq.html.     Howard Katz as Lost Classics Project coordinator was busy during 2000.He was able to announce the release of Will Nelken's Marin MacroWorksproducts, as well as TimeOut Graph and other TimeOut products and theBeagleWrite word processor. Uploaded in June was Beagle Graphics, and inAugust extra graphic patterns for Beagle Graphics, and DiversifiedAccountant Job Cost System. ZBASIC, an 8-bit BASIC compiler for the AppleII, was also made available through this project.     Geoff Weiss released another Spectrum script called SCAP ("SpectrumCreate A PDF"), which converted AppleWorks Classic, Teach, Text, or Sourcefiles into PDF format files.:: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::     Crock 'O Gold was updated to v3.3. Don Elton released the source codefor Talk Is Cheap on his FTP server; it was also posted on the Delphi A2library.     Kim Howe contributed a short article about Arachnid, his Apple IIGSweb browser, and had his first preview release up in May. By August,Preview 2 was available for download.     Spectrum was updated to v2.2, then to v2.3, and by November was up tov2.4 and was being sold through Shareware Solutions II. Ewen Wannop alsointroduced SAM (Spectrum Automated Mailer) in April. Requiring at leastv2.3 of Spectrum and v2.0 of Marinetti, it was an e-mail message managementprogram for the IIGS, using Internet protocols. Shareware Solutions II waschosen as the publisher of the program.     Richard Bennett announced that Marinetti was changing to open sourcestatus as of August 2000, and further development by any interested partieswas welcomed.:: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::     The Lost Classics Project was also busy in this category. Diversi-DOSby Bill Basham and ProntoDOS by Tom Weishaar was released into freewarestatus, thanks to the efforts of Gareth Jones and Howard Katz. Alsoreleased were Beagle Compiler and Program Writer, as well as System.II fromKitchen Sink Software.     Sheppy released ImageMaker 1.2, a bug fix revision, and then inSeptember released v2.0.     For those wishing to WRITE utility software routines, the tricks toreading multiple keys down on the Apple IIGS were explained by Sheppy inMarch. In August, one topic of discussion was the use of a Macintosh serverand booting an Apple IIGS from that Mac. A related recurring theme was filetransfer between Apple II and some other foreign computer. Accomplishingthis between a IIGS and an IBM PC was discussed in March.:: GAMES ::     Jeff Fink worked feverishly on his adventure game Silvern Castleduring 2000. He first updated it to version 3.0, with an Expanded Scenario,and then to v4.0 and v4.1 by May. In August, v5.0 of the game wasavailable, and some hints were posted as well. Along with some featureimprovements, this new update included a new expert-level scenario "TimeMaster" for registered owners. A revision to v5.1 and v5.2 followed soonafter, as did the announcement that Fink had decided to change the statusof the game to freeware, as he had received only a measly NINE sharewareregistrations since he had released the game in July 1999. He hoped thatmaking it a freeware product would increase the penetration of the game,and therefore the interest in it. Not willing yet to rest on his laurels,he released v6.0 by November. The changes in this revision were primarily arecoding to operate under MicroDot, which allowed the program to be morecompact and to fit more game into the same amount of space. By December heannounced yet another update, this time to v7.0.     Other game-related events included:o Kim Howe released his first Apple IIGS game, Shipwrecked, which operatedunder HyperCard IIGS.o Joe Kohn arranged for the re-release of Ultima I IIGS.o NinjaForce updated their web site, and made a version of Defender Of TheWorld in "2MG" format for use with emulators.o Tom Zuchowski released a CD filled with Eamon text adventure scenarios,suitable for use with an emulator or an Apple II with access to a CD-ROMdrive.o At KansasFest, Sheppy released Lemonade Stand GS, an updated version ofthe classic Applesoft game.o An update of GShisen to v1.2.1 was uploaded in September.o Ancient Art Of War At Sea, DuelTris and Xenocide were again madeavailable through the Lost Classics Project.INTERNET NEWS / NETWORKING     June discussions included ways to use a PC running Linux to act as aserver for an Apple IIGS, allowing an indirect connection to the Internetvia a DSL or cable modem. (The web site referenced, www.linuxrouter.org, isstill available, but no further development is being done with it).PUBLICATIONS     Juiced.GS continued its run, concluding its fourth year and startingits fifth. Each issue was described in a post on the Delphi forum thatoutlined its table of contents.KANSASFEST     Dubbed "Y][KFest", this 2000 edition of KFest was again held in lateJuly at Avila College in Kansas City, Kansas. As early as January, aregistration form for the event appeared in each issue of The Lamp!, upuntil the month before the event. Ryan Suenaga's "Y][KFest Compliant" KFestFAQ appeared in the March issue.     KFest this year featured a keynote address by Ryan Suenaga, and aroast of Eric Shepherd. Those events and the regular sessions wereavailable for the first time via web-cam. Sessions this year included"AppleWorks GS and MusicWriter" by Stan Marks; "ProTERM Mac Tips & Tricks"and "ProTERM Scripting" by Jerry Cline and Dave Miller; "DesktopPublishing" by Max Jones; "Lost Classics Update" by Howard Katz; and"Linux: The Apple II Cable Modem Adapter" by Ryan Suenaga and KirkMitchell.     The one HackFest entry mentioned in The Lamp! (and not until November)was from Ken Gagne. His program, Maxster, was a hoax made to look like aNapster client for the Apple IIGS.  It would APPEAR to search for,download, and play the first few seconds of MP3 audio files.  It wasuploaded in its 0.79 version during November.     Editor Lyle Syverson had an opportunity to attend the event this year,and he gave his comments on his first KansasFest in an article in theAugust issue.REVIEWS     Ryan Suenaga reviewed the book "APPLEDESIGN: The Work Of The AppleIndustrial Design Group" in the February issue. Lyle Syverson reviewed theTime In A Bottle CD set in September, and Mike Thomas did his own review ofit in November.WRITERS     Ryan Suenaga again wrote "The Lamp Salutes" in January, presenting theApple II Achievement Awards. Best Commercial Product was awarded to GSoftBASIC 1.2, with runner-up given to Spectrum Internet Suite 1.1. BestShareware Product was awarded to Silvern Castle and ImageMaker. BestFreeware Product was given to the reclassified Modem MGR telecommunicationsprogram. Best World Wide Web Site was awarded to the Apple II InformationResource by Tony Diaz, and to David Kerwood's A2-Web. The Best Publicationaward went to Juiced.GS, with honorable mention to Shareware Solutions II.Outstanding Apple II-Related Development went to Bernie ][ The Rescue andSweet16. Outstanding Individual Achievement went to Howard Katz.     Suenaga also appeared again in August with "The Publisher StrikesBack", an article that announced the outcome of his project of severalmonths of work, that being the production of the Time In A Bottle CD set.He also announced "A2 News And Notes", a short newsletter that he wouldwrite on a monthly basis to give headline-style updates of events in theApple II world.     Although it was not a major article, posts by Mark Percival (currenthost of the A2 "Midweek Madness" chat on Wednesday evenings) began toappear as quotes in The Lamp! during 2000. He joined in a spiriteddiscussion on the preservation of Apple II software.MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES     Editor Syverson wrote an article about his thoughts on a dreamcomputer, an Apple II that would allow multitasking.     A joint teleconference was held between the Aurora Area Apple Core ofAurora, Illinois, and the AppleByters of the Quad Cities of Illinois andIowa, over one hundred miles apart.     In August, it was announced that Glen Bredon had passed away. He wasthe prolific author of ProSel, the Merlin (and Big Mac) assembler, andnumerous other utilities for the Apple II and IIGS over the years. Asmentioned in the previous article in this series, the web site Bredon hadput up posting pictures taken with his digital camera is still working (seethe February 2004 "Illuminating The Lamp" article for details).STATS     Here are statistics for the first nine years of GEnieLamp and TheLamp! The numbers refer to the size of each issue in "K" (kilobytes):Year    Min     Max     Avg----    ----    ----    ----1992    116K    212K    156K1993     80K    256K    172K1994    124K    216K    165K1995     92K    176K    125K1996     80K    192K    116K1997     44K    124K     85K1998     68K    156K    102K1999     59K    120K     91K2000     47K     81K     60KYOU MAKE ME FEEL BRAND NEW     The Apple II world continued to contract during this year. However,despite the undeniable fact that the World Wide Web ruled the Internet atlarge, through Windows, Mac and Linux computers, there was still a ray ofhope.
