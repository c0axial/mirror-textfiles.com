Heopened it and a genie popped out, saying, "Thanks for freeing me--I nowgrant you a wish."  The guy said, "Well, I've always wanted to go toCalifornia, but I'm terrified of flying.  Could you build me a bridge?"     "Sorry, that's just too hard to do," the genie replied.  "Could youchoose something else?"     "Okay. . . I always wanted to understand women."     "How big did you want that bridge?"     It seems to me that when you're asked to do the impossible--somethingthat Apple II users ask of their machines, their community, and themselvesevery day--something just slightly less impossible seems routine.Unfortunately, the impossible this month was getting this issue out ontime.  What was just slightly less impossible was getting it out at all.  Apretty serious case of the flu and some pretty serious turbulence in myfamily and personal life have combined to make this issue a lot later thanI'd like.  I'd blame it on work if I could, but this time I can't.     In any case, in my penultimate issue as editor, I'd like to say thatI'm leaving you to a better schedule than I could provide.  My recenttardiness doesn't speak to how much I've enjoyed doing this, and how funit's all been.  Or how hard it's been to get it done.     Of course, I haven't had time to reflect enough on that.     I've been busy building a bridge.                                [*] [*] [*]     Toll Booth Department: there's no A2Pro section in this issue, as,interestingly, there wasn't a single post in Delphi's A2Pro Forum this pastmonth.     Additionally, we have two articles in this issue--one from one of ourregulars, Tee Cashmore, the other a combination of work by Howard Katz,Lyle Syverson, and myself.  This last article ought to be of particularinterest to those Delphi users using Sprintnet or Tymenet as their methodof access.     The big news this month is that the Delphi Online Service isdiscontinuing direct dialup access--that is, you will no longer be able toaccess Delphi by Sprintnet or Tymenet.  Before anyone starts off on an AOLrant, the reality is that Delphi -will- continue to be accessible by AppleII users--it'll just only be accessible via telnet.     For those of you still using Sprintnet or Tymenet access, please readthe article in this issue co-authored by Howard Katz, Lyle Syverson, andmyself.  It's specifically designed to assist those of you who will need totransition to some other type of access.     This is known as building another bridge.Ryanthelamp@sheppyware.netASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][OPN]------------------------------     A FUNNY THING HAPPENED. . . . |-----------------------------------Checking out A2 on Delphi"""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

It came and hisRamFAST would not work. He took the Buggie out and had Steve send another.It also would not allow him to boot.He asked me for help so I brought my Buggie power supply over and his IIgsbooted fine.I took both supplies home and tried them on my system. Neither would work.I then measured the 12 and 5 volt supplies (and if memory serves) one orboth of the 5V supplies was too hot. These measurements were taken whilethe power supply was connected to the IIgs.In conversation with Steve it turned out that (at that time at least) hedidn't have a RamFAST so he could not test his supplies to see if it wouldwork. It appears that the RamFAST is very critical of any deviations from5V. In addition, he didn't measure the voltage while the unit was pluggedinto a working //e or IIgs, which I think is crucial. (Where is Harold whenyou need him?)So, my bottom line in this is to ask if you have measured the four voltagesthat the unit produces?FWIW, there was a guy a couple of years ago on csa2 that got pretty hottowards Steve in an interminable thread about having such a high powereddevice connected to a unit that was designed for considerably less current.His point was that Steve should put four in-line fast blow fuses to protectthe Apple and any boards connected to it.

Then take deglosser or lacquer thinner and clean them off, dothat a couple times. They have loads of paper dust all imbedded in them andthey skid on the paper and "peel out" pushing a whole mess of paper in ornot picking up any.Do not ask me for more specific details on disassembling the printer, Ihave not done one in a while so I can not graphically describe it.

Recently, my ISP started a new""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   "service" that intrigued me so Icalled them and asked for more information. It seems that they now areoffering "nationwide" dialup service.Having been friends with the owner of my ISP for a couple of years now Iwas interested in knowing how they could do that. Seems that a lot of theindependent ISPs are starting to do a number pooling - call in, give yourfull email address, and the local provider will connect you thru to yourhome ISP. And from what I gathered, no additional charge is involved.Since my ISP is going to continue to offer shell accounts, this might be away for someone outside the chicagoland area to sign up for a shellaccount. (and if you use a PPP/SLIP connection, that's supposed to worktoo.)The one drawback to consider is if the local ISP you're connecting thrudecided to pull out of the cooperative setup, you'd lose your access to theaccount. (BTW--I just called them--no extra charge for connection thru thelocal number setup.)If anyone's interested, check out the homepage for Foxvalley Internet atwww.foxvalley.net and choose the link about nationwide service (someCanadian towns are listed too.) Their phone # is 847-742-4623. Not allareas or states are covered, but there's a growing list.

That access isprobably the most expensive (to Delphi and it's users) so, if the number ofusers was dropping, it made sense to drop it. With my IIgs, and Marinetti,I've been using TCP/IP to reach Delphi from my ISP for some time. Beforethat, I used my ISPs shell.For those who used the dialup due to not finding an ISP with a shell, andhaving older IIs that can't use Marinetti, this is a real hardship, unlessthey can afford to upgrade their hardware. IIgs computers aren't all thatexpensive anymore, unless you want an accelerator. Macs that can run Bernieat reasonable speed are getting more affordable, and those who went downthe Intel path can get Sweet 16, if they have hardware that can reasonablyrun BEOS.Unix shells are going to get harder to find, and direct text access isdoomed to cost considerations ending them. I know many would rather notmove on, but it has to happen sometime.  -- Carl Knoblock - Telephone Tech - Fri 15 Oct 99 10:33:14 pm cknoblo@novia.net - Via Spectrum v2.2 & Crock O' Gold v3.1 Y][Kfest, July 26-30, 2000 - 285 days till Y][Kfest Using Marinetti 2.0.1 - Thank you, Richard.                        (CKNOBLO, 26642, GO COM A2)>>>>>   We don't know the reason that Delphi is dropping dialups.

With the twolistserves that Lady Technophobe subscribes to bring in upward of 100messages a day, I was retrieving a lot of data at once. It was not unusualto lose whole blocks of data from the mail stream. I would sit therewatching it, and there was no visible 'gap' on this end. I finally decidedthat there must be some kind of glitch in how Delphi's mail works viatelnet, because I had no such trouble with Sprintnet. There was one otherwho was helping me test OLRight! at the time, and he had the same problem.At the time, I was using the command that basically spools all the mail tothe terminal window. I eventually gave up on it because of this problem. Inow retrieve each letter individually.It sounds as though you are having a similar problem. When Delphi's mailsystem sends out the mail (either using the EXTRACT command or in singleletters), it marks the message as 'read' when it starts to send it. Thereis no way that I know of to tell Delphi (in its textside mail) that you didnot get the whole letter, or that the mail that you receive was missingsomething (as evidenced by unrelated mail being concatenated in the same'letter').I used a two-fold solution to this problem in my ANSITerm scripts. First, Iretrieve the mail one letter at a time, just pressing ENTER betweenletters. I also close and re-open the download buffer between letters,because that writes the buffer to disk, and that way I have all previousletters if there is a 'stall' or other problem (I have a really bad phoneline). Second, when new mail is read, it goes from a NEW folder to the MAILfolder. Before reading the mail, I copy everything that is in the MAILfolder into a folder called ARCHIVE (deleted and re-created at eachsession). This way, when I log on, I have the new mail available, plus theprevious session's mail, plus the mail from the session before that. Idelete everything else each session.Don V.

Suenaga    [hkatz@delphi.com],[lyle837@delphi.com],[thelamp@sheppyware.net]                    Tymenet and Sprintnet Alternatives                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     It's official--the Delphi Online Service will stop supporting dialupaccess very soon.     This news was not welcomed by the Apple II community.  Although moreand more of the focus of telecommunications is being moved from traditionalonline services and electronic bulletin board systems (aka BBSs) to theInternet, many of the Apple II faithful continue to use and champion thetraditional dialup online service.     Unfortunately, that traditional online service is dying a relativelyquick death as the Internet assimilates old style telecommunications in afashion that even the Borg would envy.  The old per hour charge model ofthe traditional online service has given way to the flat rate model used bymodern Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and the standard ASCII access hasbeen largely replaced by a TCP/IP connect.  Just where does that leavethose of us who still champion the Apple II?     It leaves us with some very viable options.     Let's take a look at some ways you can continue accessing Delphi--andthe rest of the Internet--with your Apple II.  We'll take a look at optionsfor both 8 bit and 16 bit Apple IIs, including some at very low cost, andsome that many people may not have thought of.EIGHT BIT OPTIONS   In order to access Delphi without Sprintnet or Tymenet"""""""""""""""""   services with an 8 bit Apple II, you will most likelyneed some kind of text based dialup service.  Since there is no way to makea TCP/IP connection to the Internet using the 8 bit Apple II computers youwill need to find some type of service--either an ISP or one of the optionsbelow--that has dialup access and provides telnet software on that system.     You will also need communications program on your Apple II thatprovides VT100 emulation or higher.  _ProTERM_ can be purchased fromhttp://www.intrec.com/.  _Modem MGR_ and _Kermit_ can be downloaded fromthe A2 Database on Delphi.  _Talk is Cheap V4_ might be available on theused market. (Versions of _TIC_ earlier than V4 do not provide VT100emulation.)Low Cost Alternatives   include freenets, BBS's, libraries, colleges,"""""""""""""""""""""   universities, and employers.     To find these alternatives check the yellow pages, the local library,any local computer user groups, and local colleges/universities.  Askfriends and coworkers what they use for an ISP.  Ask your employer if theyprovide any ISP privileges.Freenets and Community Networks   The term freenet implies an ISP that can'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   be used free of charge.  Often theseorganizations offer certain services free but charge a modest fee for otherservices such as telnet.  Not all freenets offer telnet.     In addition to the suggestions above search the World Wide Web forfreenets.  Some freenets can be located at this URL...http://www.lights.com/freenet/.  Search for "freenet" using HotBot.(http://www.hotbot.com)BBS's   Some of the local BBS's offer telnet.  Costs to connect to BBS's'''''   vary widely.Libraries   vary widely as to any internet services they offer.  If you are'''''''''   lucky you might find one that allows you to dial in andprovides telnet service on its system.Colleges and Universities   sometimes provide dial in internet service.'''''''''''''''''''''''''   Sometimes you will be able to use their systembut will have to do so on campus.  You might have to be a student or on thestaff in order to use the system.Employers   sometimes will allow you to dial into their system from home.'''''''''   If  telnet software is included on that system you can probablyuse it with your Apple II.The Conventional ISP   Finding an Internet Service Provider is easy these""""""""""""""""""""   days, especially if you live in a metropolitan area.The phone book yellow pages usually has a comprehensive listing of them.Even in more rural areas, there should be some that are listed.  However,not all ISPs are created equal, and many of them will not be able tointerface with an Apple II computer.     For those with a GS, the _Marinetti_ option, described later in thisarticle, is available.  For 8 bit Apple II users, or those GS owners usingan 8 bit communications program such as _ProTERM_ or _Modem MGR_, you needto find an ISP that offers a shell account.  This section will deal withISPs where Marinetti is not being used.     ISPs tend to fall into 3 broad categories, based upon the operatingsystems they use.Windows and Windows NT Servers   Many ISPs are based on these Microsoft''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   products.  While the price per month foruse of these systems tends to be low, they're normally inaccessible to 8bit Apple II users, since they need access protocols (TCP/IP,PPP or SLIP)not available to the communications programs.Unix-based Servers   These come in a variety of "flavors" since there's''''''''''''''''''   several variations of Unix available.  If an ISP isrunning one of these, connecting usually isn't a problem, since the shellaccount you need to connect is built in.  (Caveat: some ISPs may have theshell system disabled, and you would need to get then to turn it on foryou.  It's also possible that you might have to dial a separate number toaccess the shell.Mixed Systems   Some ISPs will use different operating systems for'''''''''''''   different functions.  For example, you might find your ISPuses NT for internet access, but Unix for mail usage.     Mixed systems may or may not offer shell accounts.  They may offerthem at an additional charge, or if the Unix machine is dedicated to aspecific function, they may decline to allow you access to it for securityreasons.     If an ISP offers what they call a "Telnet-only shell", it's best toavoid them.  These are designed for Windows or Macs that would connect viaone of the above named protocols and then run a program to "telnet" back tothe shell system.  Since 8 bit Apple II programs don't incorporate thistelnet package, this option doesn't help out.     What's needed is a true dialup shell.  In most cases, you get theshell when you dial the ISP's telephone number, and connect to theirsystem.  You're greeted with the operating system information (usually) anda prompt for your username and then your password (always).  This issimilar to Delphi's asking dialup users to log on to the system.  Fromthere, you issue commands to use the system to navigate around the ISP--sayto get your mail, or to access the internet via lynx.  Delphi users wouldalso issue commands to telnet to Delphi's computers.  Shell accountsusually can be accessed in other ways too.  You may be able to telnet backto your shell account from another computer (say, at a cybercafe if you'reon the road) and work with it as if you had dialed directly in.     You may find a variant in the shell system.  Instead of a prompt whereyou issue the commands, some shell accounts are set up with a pre-definedmenu, limiting your command options.  This may be done for securityreasons, or an attempt to help users with the more commonly used functionsof the server.  Obviously, a command line prompt gives you greaterflexibility, but if your ISP only offers a menu-driven shell, and it hasthe commands you most likely would use, then it would be a workablealternative.  Many school or university based systems have decided to usemenus for the reasons noted above.     Finding out if the ISP you want to use has a shell account isn'talways easy, especially if they're not using a Unix-based system.  Ifcustomer service doesn't seem to know what a shell account is, ask forsomeone in the technical department.  Always make sure that the shell, ifit exists, can be accessed via direct dialup, and not via telnet only.     When choosing an ISP, look at your needs.  If you're going to travel alot, you might be interested in one of the "national" ISPs that offerdialup numbers throughout The U.S. and Canada.  If you tend to stick closeto home, numerous regional or local ISPs might work for you.  Many of thesesmaller ISPs can be accessed away from home too, either by the telnetmethod mentioned above, or via shared or pooled dial-in numbers:  manysmaller ISPs are allowing users from other ISPs to use their numbers toconnect you back to your "home" ISP. This gives you greater flexibility inyour connection methods, as well as greater accessibility for the ISP.     Charges for usage will also vary from ISP to ISP.  Some may offer aflat per-month usage rate.  This rate may vary depending on the accessspeed used, or may also be discounted if you pre-pay for service.  Youmight find some that are timed: x number of hours a month "free" for yourmonthly subscription, and then additional charges for any time used inexcess of the "free" hours.  There's also mail-only accounts for people whowant to just get email. These are cheaper still, but obviously won't getyou onto the Internet for other things.     If your look in the yellow pages has been fruitless, let your browserdo the walking at http://www.thelist.com/, a website dedicated to helpingfolks find ISPs in their area.  If you absolutely cannot find a shellaccount in your area, please check out Howard Katz's Delphi A2 Forummessage 26525, included in this issue.     Shell accounts are not as easy to find as they once were, since themajority of internet users are connecting via graphics-based browsers. Butshell systems do still exist, and once you find one and get comfortablewith using it, you'll probably find yourself online longer and more oftenthan you thought possible.Esoteric Connections   Many Apple II users today also have computers that""""""""""""""""""""   run other operating systems, such as Mac OS,Windows, or Unix variants such as Linux.  It is also now feasible to havehigh speed Internet access available 24 hours a day, seven days a week forsuch computers.  Cable modems and Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) have madethese things possible.     If you happen to use a Unix or Unix-like system (such as Linux orNetBSD) in addition to your Apple II, you may be in luck.  Provided thatyou are able to set up (1) a TCP/IP connection between your Unix box an theInternet and (2) a null modem connection between your II and your Unix boxthat allows you to use your Apple II as a smart terminal, you can use thisto connect to the Internet.  This is exactly the same as having a Unixshell account you dial into, except your connection is via a null modemcable rather than a phone line.     Linux is gaining tremendous popularity as a low cost powerhouse of anoperating system that runs on multiple hardware platforms.  From a brandnew Athlon or Power Mac G4 to an old 386, you can get Linux running forclose to nothing.  Simply connect your Apple II and your Linux box with anull modem cable and you're on your way to easy Internet access.     If you happen to have a Linux (or some other Unix variant) runningcomputer connected to the Internet--preferably with a permanent connection,but dial up would be fine too--you too could create your own shell accountthat your Apple II can access using a null modem connection.  This is notfor the faint of heart, but the details can be found in Devin Reade'sexcellent linux.gs.login file in the Delphi A2Pro Database.  This is asetup one of the authors has available at home, and it makes accessing the'Net with an Apple II as fast as currently possible.SIXTEEN BIT OPTIONS   If you're using an Apple IIgs, you can use all of the"""""""""""""""""""   options available to the 8 bit Apple II crowd as wellas true TCP/IP connectivity using the Marinetti package developed byAustralian programmer Richard Bennett. Marinetti will allow you to connectdirectly to the Internet to any host providing dial-in or null modem accessusing the Point-to-Point Protocol PPP) or the Serial Line InterfaceProtocol (SLIP)--it does not, however, support the CHAP sign on used bysome Internet Service Providers offering PPP accounts.     SLIP accounts are becoming as difficult to find as shell accounts.PPP accounts are more common; however, some users report problems gettingMarinetti to work with certain ISPs.  With the assistance of the Delphi A2Forum members, we have compiled the list below of known Marinetticompatible ISPs:ISP Name            ISP Webpage          A.C.

Forinstance, I can say with certainty that the last time I used aconcentric.net account with Marinetti in the 808 area code, it workedgreat.  I can't make the same statement for every concentric.net node outthere.     If you have a shell account (but no SLIP or PPP), you can also tryusing the SLIRP PPP/SLIP emulator to get Marinetti working.  SLIRP is aUNIX shell program that emulates a PPP or SLIP connection.  Seehttp://www.webcom.com/~llarrow/tiarefg.html for more details on SLIRP.     Finally, when the MacIP Link Layer module for Marinetti is releasedyou can use a Macintosh connected to the IIgs as a TCP/IP server withproper software.     In conclusion, even when Delphi drops its Sprintnet and Tymenet accessoptions, Apple II users will have many, many options to connect to Delphi.Apple II Forever![EOF][POP]------------------------------              PERSPECTIVE POSITIVE |-----------------------------------TEE'S POINT OF VIEW"""""""""""""""""""Written by Tee Cashmore   [teec@execulink.com]                              Where Are You?                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     We, the Apple II supporters, are everywhere!  Of course you knew thatdidn't you?     I started using an Apple ][+ in December 1983 and have run the gambitof IIe, IIc, Laser 128 EX, IIgs, Mac Plus, Mac SE/30, IIsi, IIci, to mypresent Quadra 700 with Power PC card.  On the way I became a dealer forApplied Engineering & Abracadata software and still service some schools,hospitals and small businesses, having accumulated a lot of hardware andsoftware for Apple IIs and older Macs on the way.     I was curious to know exactly where current Apple II users lived andhow they connect to the Web.  I know that many users didn't respond to myposting and some I cheated on by noting there whereabouts from Delphimessage postings, but in a short time I did get 49 responses, some verydetailed, some with very little information.     Out of the 49, the fact that 30 are from the USA is not surprising;actually I expected more; then 5 from Australia, 5 from Canada, 3 fromGermany, 1 from Austria and 1 from UK (no prizes for guessing who that is)and 5 didn't say for some strange reason.     Connections run from using Apple IIc, IIe, IIgs, Macs of varyingvintage and a few "Windoze", although most of those were at work and use aIIgs at home.  I found the software used very interesting, as it ran thewhole gambit from PPP through _Crock O' Gold_.     I have to admit to a lack of knowledge of most connective software forthe Apple II world and I pity any user who wants to know what to use,especially the novice user, as I find little information as to what doeswhat best, how to obtain it and how to use it.  As much of this informationis only available on Delphi and related sites, how does anyone find outabout what is available?  Might I suggest that one way would be to producea two sided printout sheet of basic software detail, contact all the AppleII User Groups using the old fashioned snail mail system, asking them todistribute same sheet to their membership lists.     Almost all the respondents to my survey had accounts of the Telnetvariety, but many had regular ISP accounts.  I also have to mention thatmany users are actually running _Bernie ][ The Rescue_ on their Macs,thereby emulating a IIgs.  This ingenious system is also a very unsung heroand I'd be willing to bet that very few Mac users are aware of thispossibility of getting the best of both worlds.  Perhaps contacting Macgroups as detailed above may be one way to let the word be known.     My conclusion is that there is still an untapped market for connectionsoftware, even more so now that Delphi is changing access possibilities,but the major problem is advertising, specifically how to reach the AppleII community.     Thanks to all the respondents to my Delphi survey.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :           Acid test?
