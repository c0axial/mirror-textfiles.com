If the Apple II was going to die, I was going to be there when ithappened.  Thankfully, it hasn't died since I've been going to KFest, whichreinforced my paranoia--or self-fulfilling prophecy.  If I kept going toAvila, the Apple II would never die.  So far, I've been correct.     But 1999 was supposed to be the year I couldn't make it.  Despite allmy planning and scheming and saving and working, there was just no way Icould be there.  I had a commitment to be elsewhere in August, and fundsand vacation time are limited resources.  I couldn't be everywhere I wantedto be or needed to be, and myself and my lady friend were booked to be inCalifornia just weeks after KansasFest was scheduled to happen.     The way things turned out--times change, people change, events change.No U.S.C. visit for me this year.  Or ever, I think.     In the end, though, some things stay the same.  There's me and myApple II.  And KansasFest in the heat of the July summer.     For those of you who won't be joining me at Avila's hallowed hallsthis year, remember--love the people in your life like there's no tomorrow,because when you come right down to it, there really isn't.                                [*] [*] [*]     Time Is On My Side Department: Last pre-KFest '99 Blatant Plug.KansasFest 1999 is on for July 21-25, 1999 (with special early arrivalevents on the 20th), in Kansas City, Missouri at Avila College.

The server dials out to my ISP through aUSR Sportster Voice 56K external modem and shares that connection betweenthese two machines and two others: a homebrew K6-200 parked under the TV(for DVD, CD, and MP3 playback, mainly) and a "stealth IIGS" (ROM 01motherboard in a IIe case). The three clones are on a Fast Ethernet LAN;the GS hooks into a serial port on the server, and it can connect eitherwith ProTERM or Marinetti (though ProTERM is the more useful of the twountil more software shows up that uses Marinetti).The complete rundown on the GS's config: 4.25 megs RAM, two 40-meg harddrives connected to a rev. C RamFAST (used to have a tape drive, too, butthat went south; will probably replace it with a Zip drive eventually),3.5" and two 5.25" (DuoDisk) floppy drives, NEC MultiSync 3D monitor(Second Sight not needed, just the "Mac adapter" provided with themonitor), SoundMeister sound card, Imagewriter printer. I also rescued aStyleWriter from the trash recently. It self-tested OK after I gave it athorough cleaning, a power supply, and a new ink cartridge.Off the network, I have a couple more Apples...a IIe that works and a II+that doesn't. I've also snagged a few other machines for the "antiquecomputer collection"...a Commodore VIC-20 (with tape drive), a Tandy ColorComputer 2 (with cartridge switch box and floppy controller, but no floppydrive), and an IBM PC/XT (with 640K RAM and 20-meg hard drive...thing's asslow as my IIe, maybe even slower in some respects...probably because ofthe original-equipment IBM CGA card still installed). -=IIGS=- Scott Alfter ( {<mailto:salfter@delphi.com> salfter@delphi.com}) {<http://people.delphi.com/salfter> http://people.delphi.com/salfter}                        (SALFTER, 23496, GO COM A2)CAN YOU BOOT OFF OF APPLETALK WITH THE MAC'S BUILT-IN SHARING?

Two paths that I have used:""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""1) Open the AppleWorks GS file with EGOed 2.0 and save as RTF, then move to   the PC (exercise left to student) and open with Word. The only problem   that I know of with this method is that you only get one 'ruler', which   is the first ruler that EGOed encounters in the AWGS file.2) Use the AWGS and RTF translators for GraphicWriter III. You can import   the AWGS file into GWIII and then export it using the RTF translator,   then move to the PC and open with Word. The main problem with this   approach is the 32k frame size in GWIII. I suppose you could break a   large AWGS file into segments, import it into multiple frames in GWIII,   and then export multiple RTF files from the individual frames, but that   could get a bit tedious. Worth it though, for 'valuable' documents.Don V.

In his absence, let me try toexplain...Contacts GS is a New Desk Accessory that was written by Burger BillHeineman as a name and address database. It includes a total of 10 fieldsfor such things as First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code,Area Codes, and Phone Number.When Bill created Contacts, he was well aware that the AppleWorks Classicdatabase was wonderful and popular, and so he programmed Contacts to savethe data files with "Tabs between fields, and carriage returns betweenrecords"...which of course is how AW Classic saves its data files. So, allit takes is a few keystrokes to "convert" an AppleWorks database into aContacts database, or vice versa.As easy and fast as it is to move data back and forth, when I took over aspublisher, I decided to take an extra step and commissioned Will Nelken tocreate a TimeOut application (TO.ContactsMover) that would make it eveneasier to move data back and forth. There are three versions of thatsupplied on the Contacts disk...for AW3, AW4, and AW5As I implied before, you don't have to keep name/address information inContacts. The program doesn't care, and neither do I ;-)But, you will be limited to only 10 fields, because that's all Contacts wasprogrammed to accommodate. And, if I remember correctly, each field can beup to 79 characters.In my case, when I first started to use Contacts, I already had anAppleWorks Classic SSII subscriber/customer database, and using the TOmodule, it couldn't have taken me more than a few minutes to convert thatto Contacts GS. Afterwards, I had the contents of my AW DB available fromthe Finder or any other GS program.Of course, it's not my actual AW DB that I'm looking at from the Finder;it's a Contacts GS database that was created from my AW DB.Contacts GS costs $20, and is available from: Joe Kohn Shareware Solutions II 166 Alpine St San Rafael, CA 94901Joe(This message was spell checked by NiftySpell GS before it was posted.)                       (JOE_KOHN, 23511, GO COM A2)DEALING WITH HTML ON AN APPLE II   Both SIS and Spectrum 2.2 will read an""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   HTML file, strip the tags, and displayit as the page is intended to look.

Yep! From memory the"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   name is ProCopy and Ithink the author is Hugh McKay (another Canadian!).Of course, I personally find it easier to read and write MS-DOS disksdirectly on the GS! ;-)--Peter Watson-- Write to MSDOS disks on the Apple IIgs?-- Impossible! ;-)                      (PETERWATSON, 23519, GO COM A2)MSDOS FST TRIVIA FROM THE MUG!STER   The problem is that MS-DOS stores the""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   volume  name in a fake file entry inthe root directory. The entry is marked with a special file attribute. WhenWindows 95 came along and wanted to create long filenames, they needed someway of marking directory entries as "special", but there were no spareattribute bits. The solution was to use an "impossible" combination ofattribute bits, one of which was the "volume label" bit. This is fine aslong as programs which check for the volume name check that the other bitsaren't on. The MSDOS FST (and for a long time, PC Exchange on the Mac!)don't check properly.So why does this cause problems? Well, if a disk hasn't been given a volumelabel (fairly common since they are totally optional in the MS-DOS world),and the root directory has a Win 95 long filename in it, then the MSDOS FSTtries to use the (hidden) long filename entry as a volume label. They areNOT similar! Usually it just ignores the disk. If you're unlucky, it'sreboot time. :-(While I'm all in favor of people using MUG!,:-)using it to give the disk a name won't help if there are already longfilenames in the root directory. The volume label entry doesn't have to beat the start of the directory, so the MS-DOS FST will still trip over thelong filename entry first.The best (and simplest) advice is that whenever you format an MS-DOS disk,always give it a volume label. The MSDOS FST still won't see the longfilenames, but it should see and work with the short filename for eachfile. (Of course, MUG! lets you see the long filenames too... ;-)--Peter Watson-- Write to MSDOS disks on the Apple IIgs?-- Impossible! ;-)                      (PETERWATSON, 23683, GO COM A2)HARDWARE HACKING WITH SHOEHORNS   A while back, I bought in on one of the"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   14-MHz 65816 bulk purchases, thinking itand a faster crystal would get my computer cruising in high style. I alsohad some SRAM sitting idle on a 486 motherboard that I figured I'd use toalso bring the cache up to 64K (it was originally 16K, and the originalspeed was 8 MHz).At first, it wasn't so simple. The computer would start up, but either it'dbomb out of Finder, not boot up all the way, or do other strange weirdness.This was with it running at 8 MHz, which should've been OK. With a chatsession open to Harold Hislop (the resident hardware guru) on the Win98box, we narrowed it down to bad cache. (The chips came off an Amptronmotherboard, which figures. :-| )I put an order in to Jameco for SRAM and some oscillators in variousspeeds. The parts got here (cost was less than $20) and I put them in. Nowit ran fine at 8 MHz, but it still glitched at 10 MHz. I added some bypassand filter capacitors to the ZipGS as had been suggested...still no joy.From what I had been told, the only likely cause left was that the powersupply wasn't strong enough. Mine is a "stealth GS," a ROM 01 motherboardin a IIe case, and I was still using the stock IIe power supply. Inaddition to the ZipGS, there's also a rev. C RamFAST, a SoundMeister, and a4-meg RAM-GS sucking down power.I decided to get creative. I could've bought a heavy-duty power supply for$70 or so...kinda spendy. I could've bought a Bugg-Power...but I haveenough boxes cluttering my desk already.I decided to do something similar to the Bugg-Power, but with the powersupply shoehorned inside the case. (Actually, a IIe case has considerablymore room inside than a IIGS case, which was useful.) I took the "guts" outof a 230W PS/2-type AT power supply (had one kicking around doing nothing,but a new one would've only cost $25 or so), changed the motherboard powerconnector from the usual pair of 6-pin connectors to something the GSmotherboard would take (two .156" Molex KK connectors, one 2-pin and one4-pin), and mounted it as far back in the case as it'd go with 3/8"threaded aluminum standoffs and 1/4" 6-32 screws. The supply had avoltage-select switch on it like all clone supplies do, but I don'tanticipate leaving the country anytime soon, so I just jumpered theappropriate connection to fix it at 120V. The power outlet and switch weremounted on a piece of metal cut from the power supply enclosure andattached to the back of the computer case with 1/2" 2-56 screws, which werecut as short as possible with a Dremel after installation. I had installeda 3" cooling fan several years ago, so I hooked it to the connectorprovided on the power supply for that purpose (it had previously tapped the+12 supply wire).I put it all back together, and the thing's so far been rock-solid at 12.5MHz! (I thought I had the 8- or 10-MHz oscillator (yes, I know they'remarked 4x faster), but it had gotten the oscillator for 12.5-MHzoperation.) The system booted into Finder without a hitch. I let it runBitBanger for a little bit, then switched to a Mandelbrot program which hasalso run flawlessly.There's even enough space left for a 3.5" hard drive to be installed, and Ileft a couple of disk-drive power cables attached to the supply for thatpurpose. I've made the appropriate modifications to my RamFAST (added a50-pin connector and put the onboard terminator packs in sockets so theycould be removed), but I seem to have misplaced the terminator packs for myhard drives. (No, the ones used by the RamFAST won't work...the RamFASTuses two 8-line packs, while the hard drives use three 6-line packs.) Anorder is in to DigiKey for those, and then I'll have a IIGS with aninternal hard drive that's not in an x86 clone case! (It still won't havean internal floppy drive, but the iMac doesn't have one either, and atleast the GS has a place to plug in a normal floppy drive. :-) )On an unrelated note, I found a StyleWriter in the trash can in the laundryroom a month or so ago. It looked kinda nasty and was missing the powersupply, but it cleaned up nicely enough and is only missing the wirepaper-support thingy at the back. With a new ink cartridge (Canon BC-02,which is the closest I found) and a heavy-duty 9V wall-wart, it printed itsself-test properly.

I'll leavethe detailed explanations up to Sir Ewen...What you need to do is first set up Marinetti. For Link Layer, use PPP.Enter the following IP addresses for Concentric: 206.173.119.72 and207.155.183.72 (for other folks using other ISPs, just substitute yourISPs' IP addresses).Also, on that first screen, enter your login name and password. ClickOptions, and on that screen, enter the phone number. You can probably alsoenter the same Init String as you do with Spectrum.One Marinetti is set up, it's probably best to test that it works. Click on"Show Messages" so that you get visual feedback, then click Connect ToNetwork. Assuming that works and you get connected...Run Spectrum 2.2. Under the Phone menu you'll see an item for Switch toTCP/IP. Then click on Services, and enter Delphi, make sure the Telnet boxis checked off, and enter the address of delphi.comThen run COG3. Under the Settings menu, you'll see Connect Method. Changethat to TCP/IP, and you should be all set up, unless I left out a step ;-) Joe Kohn http://www.crl.com/~joko                       (JOE_KOHN, 23773, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I think Joe has already given a good rough outline but I'll give"""""   you one as well just in case one of us misses something. By theway, my ISP is PPP only so I must use Marinetti v2.0 with Spectrum v2.2 andCrock O'Gold v3.1 to do my Delphi sessions everyday.The first thing you need to do is get the software installed and configuredand make sure it works. Installing is easy and straight forward so I'lljust assume that you have already installed all three of the programsabove.Marinetti=========To configure, open the Control Panel NDA and open the TCPIP CDEV. Click the"Setup connection..." button. In the dialog that appears, enter theusername and password for your ISP account and enter the DNS IP addressesthat your ISP gave you in the appropriate boxes. You can set the checkboxesas you desire. Select the Link Layer to use from the pop-up menu (you'llmost likely want to use PPP). Then click the "Configure..." button. On thissecond dialog, select the port and port speed you want to use with thepop-up menus, enter a modem initialization string (the same thing you usein Spectrum will probably be fine here) and enter the phone number of yourISP (if you have call waiting or need other special handling of dialing, besure to enter the extra "digits" ie. *70, turns off call waiting in myarea). Click the "Save" button then click the "OK" button to save yoursettings.Now that it is set up, you can try to connect to your ISP by clicking the"Connect to network" button. If you don't get any errors and your modemstays online, possibly with the occasional flash of the RD and TD lights,you should be set.Spectrum========Spectrum already comes with everything you should need to actually use aTCP/IP connection. If you want to test the connection you made above, startSpectrum and, depending on whether you've changed any settings or not, doone of the following:     1) If there is a menu in the menu bar titled "Phone" then use the        mouse to select that menu, drag down to the "Switch to TCP/IP"        menu item and release the mouse.     2) Select the "Services" menu item from the TCP/IP menu.     3) You can change the checkboxes at the bottom of this dialog if        you wish but they don't really need to be changed.  I usually        leave the Telnet check box checked and uncheck the Connect        Messages and Switch Messages check boxes.  (The Telnet        checkbox state is the one area I noticed where Joe's and my        description differ.)     4) Double click the Delphi entry in the list box.  If you aren't        connected to your ISP at this point (you didn't hang up after        the Marinetti set up did you? :) Spectrum will connect you        to your ISP and open a connection to Delphi.     5) If you get a "Username:" prompt and you can log in without any        problems, then everything is fine for working with COG v3.1.Crock O'Gold============Select the "Access Settings..." menu item from the Options/Settings menuand fill in the phone number (not used with a TCP/IP connection but itstill needs to be entered), Delphi username and Delphi password and theBilling charge (per minute; 0 is a valid entry) then click the "OK" button.Next select the "Connect Method..." menu item from the Options/Settingsmenu and select the "TCP/IP using Marinetti" radio button then click the"OK" button.NOTE: This is just what needs to be done to get COG to work with aMarinetti connection! You will still need to configure your Main andAlternate forums, session actions, transfer protocol and more.Summary=======This is probably a little more than a "rough outline" as you requested butonce I got started I couldn't stop myself. Besides, this will most likelybe useful to others not to mention that it almost guarantees inclusion inThe Lamp! :)As an added note, a telnet session to Delphi using Spectrum makes a niceway to participate in conferences (real time chats).

This way you willhave the minimum memory consumed by the system. Finally cut the size ofyour Capture and Scrollback buffers in Spectrum as low as you can.

There were a couple of things that I tried thathelped:1) Use the Marinetti CDev to establish a connection, then launch Spectrum,   and then try to connect to Delphi using the pre-configured Delphi telnet   option. This helped sometimes.2) Set up a 'service' for Delphi that uses the IP address rather than the   domain name.

Certain settings (and again I don'tfeel like looking it up :) will cause a failure with these cables.A PROPER hardware handshaking cable, as described in the Spectrum andProTerm manuals, will work very nicely with a Mac as well as with a IIgs.I can't understand why vendors bother to "cheat" on this stuff, as it seemsno more expensive to wire such a cable properly.

Only ANSITerm on theIIgs was written to be different which means it has a unique set of initstrings--these can not be used by any other IIgs/Mac comm program. ANSITermcan best be summed up as being non-standard.But, there are two different ways to wire a hardware handshaking cable forthe IIgs and Mac. Spectrum provides drivers for both type of cables. Thedefault Spectrum port driver uses the _standard_ Mac/IIgs hardwarehandshaking cable.

A NEW VERSION""""""""""""""""""""""" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ANSITerm Lovers - Announcement !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OLRight! version 4.0 has been uploaded to the A2 database.OLRight! is an off-line reader (OLR) executed entirely within ANSITerm,using ANSITerm's scripting language to automate on-line activities and togive you an off-line environment for reading messages and mail, and settingup what is to happen when you are online.Look for a summary of features in a follow-up message.Don V. Zahniser (IronTooth)Woofed to you by OLRight! scripts for ANSITerm via Bernie ][ the Rescue!                       (DZAHNISER, 23497, GO COM A2)<<<<<""""" **************************** OLRight! V4.0 ****************************9OLRight! is an Off-Line Reader (OLR) for Delphi, executed within ANSITerm,the Apple IIGS terminal software from Parkhurst Micro Products. OLRight!automates many of the functions that you would normally perform manually onthe 'text side' of Delphi, and provides you with an environment to set upautomated activities on Delphi and to read or otherwise manage the results. *** Delphi Access ***OLRight! supports connection to Delphi via SprintNet, direct dial toDelphi's Boston number, telnet from an ISP, or by any means through whichyou can create your own custom script. Setup of telnet access is donethrough a script-builder that supports multiple logins, multiple prompts,and several different ways of issuing the telnet commands.You can have two different access methods defined, and switch between themas the dial script begins. OLRight! will automatically redial up to 10times (or use a number you set) to accommodate busy signals or otherdial-up failures. *** User Interface ***OLRight! uses a menu bar with drop-down menus; each menu and menu commandis activated by a single keystroke. Most of ANSITerm's features andutilities are accessible through the menus, or directly by using theirANSITerm Command-keystrokes. Besides the regular menus, there is a special'apple' menu that lists any of your custom scripts, selectable by number,that you have put in a designated user directory.There are three reader utilities available within OLRight! - The mailreader, the forum message reader, and a generic text file reader that isused for reading log files, and various other data files produced duringthe on-line activities. You also have access to ANSITerm's editor and fileviewer through the menus.A Help menu, working through the text reader, gives you access to detaileddocumentation for OLRight! *** Mail ***OLRight! supports sending mail messages and text (or text-encoded) files toany mail address, or Binary files to Delphi addresses only. The mailroutines provide 'smart' addressing, automatically adding Delphi's customaddress formatting to Internet addresses. Multiple To: and CC: addressesare supported (up to 127 characters each). You also have auser-configurable 'address book' that can hold up to 32 names and emailaddresses.Your mail is received and split into an index and individual mail files.Internet address headers are stripped for reading convenience. You canbrowse through your mail using the index, picking notes at random, or youcan read messages sequentially without using the index. When you reply toor forward a mail message, the address(es) and subject of the message areextracted, plus you have all the features of the regular mail addressingroutines. You can include the text of the original message in your note,using the characters you define in ANSITerm's editor preferences forquoting the text.As you read your mail, you can print, archive and/or delete individualmessages. You can specify the file name for each archived note, or collectmessages by appending to an archive file. When you have deleted messages,you can refresh the index file whenever you like, or when you stop readingmail.OLRight! marks each newly received file as 'new'. When you start up themail reader, you can skip past the mail you have read, and go directly tothe new mail. The new mail flag is removed when you refresh your mail list. *** Forums ***OLRight! retrieves messages from each Delphi forum that you specify, andonce offline, splits the messages into an index file and individualmessages. You can browse through your messages randomly using the index, orread messages sequentially without using the index. Messages addresseddirectly to you are highlighted in both the index and the header of themessage itself. When you reply to a message, you can address it to theoriginator of that message, a different individual, or 'all'. You have theoption of including the text of the message in your reply, using thequoting characters you define in ANSITerm's editor preferences.You can print or archive individual forum messages, and address mail to theauthor of the message you are reading. Forum messages are managed bydeleting all messages currently in the reader. You can, however, keep largeblocks of messages in the reader. OLRight! uses a random-access filereading routine to access the messages, and your current message is markedwhen you reply, print, mail, or quit from the reader. The next time youstart the reader, you are automatically prompted whether to start at themarked note.OLRight! has powerful on-line search functions that let you find and readforum messages by date range, subject, author, addressee and message numberrange. You can also set your high message markers, read specific messagenumbers, or create a search using your own commands. You can retrieve alist of the topics for a forum. You can also set and clear (activate anddeactivate) topics within a forum, or filter out messages with specificsubject text. *** Conferences ***As you enter each Forum, OLRight! displays a list of users currently onlineand in conference. There is a brief pause before Forum activities resume,during which you can hit a key to immediately go to the conference area.You can visit conferences currently in session or start your own. You canset up a default nickname (by Forum) to be used while in conference, or seta nickname each time you join. Your conference sessions are saved to a logfile for later reading. *** Databases ***You can retrieve database topics, perform database searches to find filesthat you want to download, and download files from databases using anybinary file transfer protocol supported by ANSITerm. Binary II wrappers arestripped from files if you specify a compatible protocol.You can upload files to databases, using a different file transfer protocolthan that used for downloads, if you choose. OLRight! helps you to preparethe upload, prompting you for all essential information, and providing aline editor to prepare the description of the file.Database searches and sessions are received into a log for later reading. *** Online Functions ***You can interrupt your online session between Forums, go to the main menu,and restart Forum or mail activities thereafter. From the main menu, youhave access to an 'Online' menu, which gives you quick access to terminalmode for manual activities, and Delphi's Lynx, FTP, and Navigatorapplications. *** Customization and Flexibility ***OLRight! has the capability to alter what activities are to be performed.You can choose to transmit only, receive only, skip mail, select whichforums to visit (or not visit forums at all), and add/delete/edit pendingactivities from special setup menus.Don V.

After the initial shock, I wasfurther amazed by the ingenuity and detail of Carol Phillips' article onusing the _Appleworks_ database for her farm's accounting, which if nothingelse, gives credence to Terry Steeper's comment in the same issue, "If yourcomputer does everything that you need it to do, keep it."     There is a similar programme called _Alpha Check Plus_ by Actasoft,which is a "Personal and Small Business Accounting" software that also usesthe database of _Appleworks_ version 3.0, 2.1, or 2.0.  The programme isdesigned to take advantage of _Ultramacros 3.1_ or above, but can be usedwithout it--it is simply more convenient with _Ultramacros_.  You also havethe choice of single or double entry bookkeeping.  Cost of the programmewas US $39.95 last year.     There is an almost identical programme called _Simplified Accounting_,(There ain't no such aminal!!) {sic}, from the National Appleworks UsersGroup, which is even cheaper!     Not that I am decrying Carol's work.  I simply wanted members to knowthat there are accounting programmes for the IIe or IIgs that will allowyou to separate PST & GST, which most of the newer US programmes will notdo, such as _BusinessWorks_.  If PST & GST records are not required, thereare quite a few programmes available and many copies of older ones thatpreceded AccPac & other popular IBM stuff by many years.  _BPI_,_Accounting Plus_ and _Peachtree Back to Basics_ are but three that readilyspring to mind and are used by a number of my clients, even in 1993.  Mostare in DOS 3.3 and painfully slow by today's standards, but were the stateof the art in the early 1980s and used by all the BIG accounting firms.  Ieven have a few unopened copies of _BPI_, CP/M _BPI_, one of _Peachtree_and one version for the Apple III!  _DB Master_ also works and can be setup to handle PST & GST, but the programme is painfully slow in sorting andprinting.     Most of my small business clients only require a simple double entryledger system, for which the _Appleworks_ spreadsheet can be used, inconjunction with "@IF" statements.  I have designed a template, readilyavailable to anyone, that can be easily modified, but you need lots ofmemory if you have many monthly entries (500-700K for a year).  Anaccelerator is almost mandatory and a hard drive makes for a much easierlife too!     If you have a IIgs, the quality of choice gets a little better._Quicken_, _ShoeBox_, _Your Money Matters_, and _Managing Your Money_ aredesigned for the IIgs, all are competent in their own way, but have otheridiocyncrises.     When will someone design a SIMPLE software accounting system?  Itshould let me tell it to "pay Joe Blow $20 for software", then ask me "whataccount to pay from, and list the choices, ie: bank account, credit card,cash, etc., then give the option to post to "Capital Cost Allowance" andgive me a balance.  The problem is they are all designed by accountants toperpetuate a system that accountants designed to confuse their clients,thereby insuring that the accountants have future work!!  That's my theoryanyway.     I have some of the above items in stock, some are readily available,some I have to search for, but all are around somewhere.  Apple IIs Live OnForever!!!Tee Cashmore[Tee's 1999 note: Most of the above comments still apply today in 1999, theonly essential difference is that most of the software programmes are onlyavailable as used software.][EOA][S&M]------------------------------              SCRIPTING AND MACROS |-----------------------------------Getting Started With Marinetti~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~by Ryan M. Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.          [thelamp@sheppyware.net]                      Getting Started With Marinetti                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Scripting.  Macros.  Many users shudder at the thought.  Oh my, I haveto learn this?  This is like programming.     Calm down.  Relax.  It's good for you, really, and it won't hurthardly at all.  I promise.     Some of the most successful computer programs on any platform (infact, some computer operating systems themselves) include some method ofautomating repetitive tasks by allowing you to create "macroinstructions",or macros for short.  A macroinstruction is, well, a large instruction.It's large because it's made up of several instructions linked together.  A"script" is similar to a macro, but it's usually more involved; however,for the purposes of this series, when you see "macro", you can think"script", or if you see "script", you can think "macro", if it helps you.In many cases, a macro or script can be invoked with a single keystroke.     If you take a look at some of the tasks you do regularly, you may seesome real opportunities to save a little time and a few keystrokes withscripts (or macros).  For instance, every month when I work on editing anissue of _The Lamp!_, I face dozens of times I must convert a piece of textthat looks like this:24106 3-JUL 04:52  Vendors & Tech Support     Spectrum Support (Re: Msg 2252)     From: RSUENAGA     To: EWANNOPto something like this:                       (RSUENAGA, 24106, GO COM A2)     Now, I could do this all manually every time I come across it, butit's a lot easier to write a simple macro for Appleworks that does it forme by:     (1) Placing the cursor to the far left of the first line of the         snippet (the line beginning with the number);     (2) Moving the cursor down three spaces;     (3) Inserting an "Unjustified" print option;     (4) Moving the cursor up one line and to the far left;     (5) Deleting the characters from the start of the current line         through the eleventh character;     (6) Inserting a "(";     (7) Moving the cursor to the next space in the line;     (8) Deleting everything to the far right of the line;     (9) Moving the cursor up two lines and to the far left of the line;     (10) Copying the message number to the line we were just working on          at the far right end;     (11) Adding a comma, a space, and the text "GO COM A2)" to the end of          the line;     (12) Centering the line;     (13) Deleting the two lines above it.     Whew!  That's a ton of steps for formatting a line of text; still,it's a lot--and I mean _a lot_--more efficient to create a macro to do thisif you'll be doing this over and over and over again.  In fact, I did justthis to make editing this newsletter easier and more time efficient.     A specific example we'll take a look at with regards to the Apple IIgsis the _TCP/IP CDev_, the interface the user actually works with to helpconnect the Apple IIgs to the Internet.  If you have an Internet ServiceProvider which provides SLIP access, you will need to come up with a scriptfor _Marinetti_ to follow.     The first thing to do when writing a _Marinetti_ SLIP script is tomanually use your telecommunications program to do what you need to do tosign on and sign off of your ISP using SLIP and take note of thescrollback.  For instance, when I log into my local Linux connection andstart slirp, a SLIP emulator, the scrollback looks like this:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN SHOT]-------------------------------------------------Welcome to Linux 2.0.29linda login: rsuenagaPassword: passwordLast login: Wed Jul 14 20:09:42 on cua1.No mail.Help stamp out and abolish redundancy.linda:~$ slirpCopyright (c) 1995,1996 Danny Gasparovski and others.All rights reserved.This program is copyrighted, free software.Please read the file COPYRIGHT that came with the Slirppackage for the terms and conditions of the copyright.IP address of SLirp host: 127.0.0.1IP address of your DNS(s): 204.210.96.1, 204.210.96.2Your address is 10.0.2.15(or anything else you want)Type five zeroes (0) to exit.[autodetect SLIP/CSLIP, MTU 1500, MRU 1500, 115200 baud]SLiRP Ready ...[END OF SCREEN SHOT]-------------------------------------------------------     That is the entire sign on until the SLIP connection kicks in.  Todisconnect, we merely need to send five 0's at moderate speed to theconnection, bringing us back to the linda:~$ prompt.  We can then logoutand return to the initial sign in.     Knowing this, the next step is to set up _Marinetti_'s connection (viathe well-named "Setup connection..." button) in the _TCP/IP CDev_.  Hittingthis button then gives you a dialog box where you can insert at least fourbasic pieces of information we already have above: username, password, andprimary and secondary Domain Name Server IP addresses.Username:      rsuenagaPassword:      password (represented by diamonds in the CDev for privacy)Primary DNS:   204.210.96.1Secondary DNS: 204.210.96.2     I also know I need a SLIP connection, so I select the SLIP Link layer,then hit the configure button to set up my scripts.     Following this, let's break down what happens into what the IIgs needsto do and what the Linux box does.  The first thing to take care of insetting up my script is the speed of the serial connection.  This is takencare of with a very simple command:     speed 38400     All this command does is dictate what speed to run the serial port at.Since my connection is a hardwired serial cable from the Linux box to theIIgs running at 38400, this was something simple to setup.  If you areusing the more common modem connection, base your serial port rate on thespeed of your modem: for a 14,400 maximum speed modem, use a command of"speed 19200"; for a 33,600 maximum speed modem, use a command of "speed38400".     My next command is simply:     send cr     This command sends a carriage return to the serial port.  I do thisbecause if the text that's already sent through the serial port on myscreen is "login:", hitting a carriage return will result in another"login:" prompt.  This is the prompt I use to trigger the rest of thescript.     My next step gets into the actual logon.  If you are using a modem todial an Internet Service Provider, you probably want to next initializeyour modem, dial your ISP, and make sure it connects.  To do this you maywant to send commands like:     send ATZ cr     wait 500 OK     sent ATDT 5551212 cr     wait 500 CARRIER     The send commands simply send what immediately follows to the serialport (and connected modem).  The wait commands instruct the IIgs to waitfor a given string to be sent to it through the serial ports.  You canplace time limits on how long the IIgs will wait before generating anerror.  Given the command "wait 500 OK", the IIgs will wait 500 60th's of asecond--roughly 8 seconds--for the serial port to receive the string "OK".If the 8 seconds pass without an "OK", an error is generated.     In my case, since I have a hardwired serial connection, I'm simplywaiting for the "login:" prompt.  So my next command is:     wait 500 login:     Once I receive the "login:" prompt, it's time to send my username.Here I can either simply type:     send rsuenaga cror, if I want to take advantage of some of the variables the CDev supports,I can use:     send USERNAME$ crwhich will do the same thing, but it will use the Username I typed in theearlier CDev dialog.  To complete the sign on process, I use:     wait 500 word:     send PASSWORD$ crwhich waits for the "word:" part of the "Password:" prompt, and sends thevalue in the Password box.     I am next waiting for the string "linda:~$", after which I'll send myslirp command.  So as you may have guessed, the next strings are:     wait 500 ~$     send slirp cr     At this point, all that's required is to parse the IIgs's IP addressout of the information slirp sends and to end the script.  The line theIIgs is sent indicating its assigned IP address is:     Your address is 10.0.2.15so to get the IP parsed and usable by _Marinetti_, we then use thefollowing lines:     wait 500 'Your address is '     getip 300followed by:     end     So in all, the script looks like this:     speed 38400     send cr     wait 500 login:     send USERNAME$ cr     wait 500 word:     send PASSWORD$ cr     wait 500 ~$     send slirp cr     wait 500 'Your address is '     getip 300     end     Save, then exit.     Next we need to construct a disconnect script.  This is even easierthan the connect script.  Remembering that the slirp script terminates withfive zeroes, leaving the connection at the "linda:~$" prompt, I constructedthe following script to leave me back where I started:     delay 50     send 0     delay 10     send 0     delay 10     send 0     delay 10     send 0     delay 10     send 0     wait 500~$     send logout cr     end     The only new command here is "delay", and it simply lets you specifyan amount of time (in 60ths of a second, again) to delay before issuing thenext command.     That's all there is to it!  Now, my IIgs connects to and disconnectsfrom the Internet as fast as can be, all thanks to a couple of scripts.  Wewill continue to look at scripting various Apple II programs in comingmonths.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :  I'm not really lost, just locationally challenged.   :         :                                                       :         ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: LUMITECH ::::::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
