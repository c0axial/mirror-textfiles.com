Pressing OA and a number key (1-9) now goesthrough the list in large increments (OA-1 jumps to the beginning, OA-5jumps to the middle, etc). Depending on how many items the store has instock, this should get you close enough to the item you're looking for sothat only a few additional F)wd or B)kwd keypresses will be necessary.Thanks to Bruce Baker for suggesting this idea.- Activating a teleporter square is now more user friendly. It now clearsthe maze viewport, beeps, and displays "ZOOM!" immediately beforeteleporting the party.For more information regarding changes in the program, see theREAD.ME.FIRST file found in the archive.(TONYW1, 33373, GO COM A2)[EOA][JFR]JEFF FINK RELEASES HIS SOFTWARE AS FREEWARE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Due to low shareware payments I have decided to release all my software asfreeware.The announcement about Silvern Castle's freeware status can be foundelsewhere in this forum.My other title, Harvest Collection #1 consisting of 4 Applesoft games-ApplePoker, Demon Ball, Rice Farmer, and Asteroid Miner-is also now reclassifiedas freeware.

The first will havesoftware and manuals. The second will have source code for everything onthe first CD that didn't already include source code. Both CDs will be CD-Rwith printed  surfaces, shipped in jewel cases with an insert that pointsout how to get started.The source code CD will include a license limiting use to private changesunless written permission is obtained to distribute the changes. My intentis to try to allow people to modify and change for the GS, but retain theright to be compensated for any use off of the Apple IIGS.The CDs will be in Mac HFS format. I'm toying with the idea of a hybrid CD,but I don't know how well that would work.The source CD will contain both HFS files that are directly accessible anda disk image created with Disk Copy 6 that contains the same source code onone or more 32M ProDOS format volumes suitable for mounting with Gus orBernie.The software CD will contain all of the software in three formats:1. Disk Copy 6 images of the original distribution disks.2. An HFS partition with all of the software preinstalled. In theory, this   should work from an Apple IIGS.3. One or more 32M ProDOS format Disk Copy 6 images with the same software   preinstalled. These will be suitable for copying and mounting with Gus   or Bernie.The documentation will be included in three formats: Word, PDF and RTF. Ido not have, nor do I expect to write, any software that would allow thedocumentation to be read directly on an Apple IIGS, but if anyone hasaccess to such software and would grant me permission to include it, Iwould be happy to do so.I also intend to include several "bonus" selections. These are eitherunfinished programs or programs I never sold. All would come with source.Possibilities include:1. Small C, the only program that is out of print.2. A planet finder program that duplicates the Sky & Telescope centerfold.3. A draw program that was complete except for disk I/O, printing and   libraries.4. A Pilot interpreter.Finally, I'll include all of the beta updates that I've done that have notbeen released.Mike Westerfield(BYTEWORKS, 33478, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""I don't think the Byte Works CD will be full. :) If anyone would like topiggyback on the CD to get distribution, please get in touch.

I'd thought of bringing dancing girls to a Mondaynight chat, and passing out virtual glasses of champagne. I've been intouch with the Russian Space Agency to inquire about Mir displaying aflashing billboard from outer space. Heck; I even contacted the Gore/Bushcampaign offices to see if I could get one of them to make the announcementduring an upcoming Presidential debate.But, alas, the wind has been taken out of my sails. My bubble has beenburst. The high drama planned for an 'earth shaking announcement' has beensubverted.Gosh!

Since room on CD-ROM is almost unlimited, I presume we'lleven include disk images for the emulator users.Oh, and before I forget, I have yet another surprise. Shareware SolutionsII will also be distributing Spectrum Internet Suite (SIS)! So, we'llprobably have a CD with Spectrum, SAM and SIS! Hmmm...and maybe even abundle that includes NiftySpell, as that works with Spectrum just like itwas built-in.I just can't predict on what date all this will become available, but itshouldn't be too much longer.One last thing: WOW!

USING THE SPECTRUM - MARINETTI COMBO"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""This was posted on the KFest list by Howard:> Looks like I'm going to have to get Spectrum once Joe's finally set up> with it. The Marinetti Telnet program either freezes on me also, or> connects briefly and then drops me back to the mini-menu. I can connect> out to other sites, but for no more than maybe 15 minutes tops.The KFest list was not really the place for us to discuss these things, asa more suitable home is over here on Delphi. So I have taken Ryan's adviceand moved my answer over here...Once you have a TCP/IP connection made with Marinetti, you should not begetting freezes or drop outs, unless the host you are connecting to isflaky, the net is very busy and so timeouts are happening, or you have beenhit by a rare Marinetti bug.In my experience, the remaining small bugs in Marinetti seem to hit memoryuse more than anything else. If memory is tight, things can get worse. BothSpectrum and Marinetti like lots of memory. I would not recommend using thecombination in anything less than 4Mb. If you only have 4Mb of RAM, then donot set up a RAM disk. It just eats up too much memory.As many of the newer programs for the IIgs can use a lot of memory, it alsopays to reduce your Inits and CDevs to the basic minimum that you need. Itmay look nice having several rows of icons showing up at boot time, buteach icon is grabbing a slice of memory, and keeps it even if it is notbeing used. If any memory trashing then happens while Marinetti is running,this only makes things worse.So look carefully at all those Inits and CDevs. Ask yourself if you reallyuse them. If not, disable them and give the applications a chance to workproperly. Sheppy's Shifty List does a great job at taming those you don'tuse regularly. Ewen Wannop - Speccie Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.4 & Crock O' Gold 3.3 Bernie ][ the Rescue 2.5.1 woofing at 55Mhz on a G3/350 Home Pages: http://www.btinternet.com/~ewannop/(EWANNOP, 33644, GO COM A2)[EOA][JGS]OCTOBER 2000 Juiced.GS IS ON THE WAY""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""GreetinGS,The October 2000 issue of Juiced.GS (V5I3) went into the mail on Thursdayand Friday.

The two computers(IIgs and iMac) are connected via TCP/IP to a hub, and the IIgssuccessfully sends pings to the Mac via the IPTools program supplied. Myexperience, from a "user" standpoint, is that once I've made a successfulTCP/IP connection via EtherNet (regardless of platform), the two computersare "sharing", or "talking" as you call it above. The only reason I evenmentioned "AppleTalk" is because I can't seem to share with the Mac viathis configuration, so I thought perhaps "AppleTalk" needed to be turnedon.I'm not intending to imply that there was any mis-representation, so pleasedon't interpret my queries as that. My understanding, as a "user", must beflawed. I know that Marinetti is required on the IIgs side, and it isactive and being used successfully for testing. So, what "userapplications" can I use, both on the IIgs side =and= the Mac side, tofurther enhance the communication level above simple "pinging"?That, basically, is my question. Sorry if I introduced or implied anythingelse. I'm happy that I bought the card and know that it will serve thepurpose that I want it to, it's simply that I obviously don't understandwhat's needed from a "user" level to further implement the connection.Jeff CarrCruising the 'rainbow' path provided by:Spectrum v2.3 and Crock O' Gold v3.3(LUMITECH, 33256, GO COM A2)[EOA][NDL]NEW DRIVER FOR THE LANceGS CARD"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""To all, mostly..Got the newest driver for the LANceGS and have escaped my local network...Joy!I'm using IPNetRouter on a Mac to share my cable modem and now my GS isfree to roam the Internet like the Big Boys.

Apple released the MSDOS.FST back in 1993, well beforeWindows 95 and up, and thus doesn't understand how to deal very well withlong file names among other things.One "bug" is if you format a floppy disk *without* giving it a volumelabel, the MSDOS.FST won't attempt to mount the disk. Even if you attemptto correct this by later giving the disk a volume label once there filesare copied to it, it still won't mount.The solution is simple: Format (or quick format/erase) a floppy disk andgive it a volume label **BEFORE** you copy any files to it. Once you'vedone this, the disk will read fine on the Apple IIgs side.Peter Watson's "MUG!" NDA is unaffected by this incidentally, although Istill like being able to read MSDOS diskettes from the Finder desktop andany GS/OS applications (i.e. ShrinkIt-GS). It is still worthwhile getting ahold of MUG! since it allows you to write (albeit slowly) to MSDOS volumes,whereas Apple's FST is read-only.If you have a SuperDrive setup, MUG! (or Peter's shell based MS-DOSUtilities if you prefer a command line) is a must-have.Mitchell Spector {<mailto:spec@total.net> spec@total.net}(SPECTOR1, 33190, GO COM A2)<<<<<"""""Giving a volume label after formatting a MS-DOS disk DID work!

If you copy a file to disk which file nameexceeds DOS's 8.3 limit, GS/OS displays it much the way MS-DOS would. Forexample, "Wolfenstein3D.SHK" will be shortened and displayed as"Wolfen~1.SHK" and will _still_ be accessible from ShrinkIt-GS.

Is Tim Keller still around?The problems were:1) Problems with large text files, &2) Mysterious hangsWell, this info is vague, but I have seen hangs during the CLOSE command(which also sometimes trashes the file & directory to such a point that youhave to use ProSel-16's hidden sort-delete command to fix it).My exact problem: I have poked locations on page 3 that don't change duringa reboot and I narrowed down my mysterious hangs to the CLOSE command. Itdoes not consistently happen, but running the program under GS/OS system 6(ProDOS v2.0.3 & BI v1.5) it happens quite a bit. Booting directly intoProDOS helps a little.Also when the program hangs the GS control panel is locked out, reset won'treset, and only a open-apple-control-reset will recover. Rarely, the hangcauses file damage (see above).I've rewrote this section of code 3 times now without luck, but the programused to run flawlessly. So I went back to my archives and ran it for a fewweeks AND had no problem! Why? Well, the archive 3.5" disk which I wasbooting into had ProDOS v1.8 and Basic.System v1.5. So I started bootingdirectly into a ProDOS partition with ProDOS v1.8 and have had NO problems!At this point there is only one possibility that I can think of that mightcause these problems: there is only 2K of free memory in my program whenthe text file is opened (leaving less than 1K remaining).Any thoughts?Jeff Finkemail: {<mailto:finkjsc@yahoo.com> finkjsc@yahoo.com}(FINKSTERJ, 3205, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""I think I first brought this up to both Tim Kellers and Howard Katz over onGEnie shortly after I discovered BASIC SYSTEM 1.5.At the time I was involved with a company called Temporal Acuity Products(TAP), and had developed a hard drive version of their 50+ musicreading/training programs.

Tim, particularly, agreed that theremust be some bug in 1.5 ... because if I used the same version of ProDOS,but changed to BASIC 1.4.1 there never was a problem.We never did figure out was/is wrong with 1.5's code. <sigh>This is why I still use BASIC 1.4.1 ... even on my gs.ChuckCHunk_S --- Your A2 Forum Host (go com a2)  Delivered by OLRight!

First, some historyabout my equipment:I have a //e with a NSC as well as a Franklin 1200, both of which also havea Z80 computer.  They both have 2 disk drive boards and the Apple has an 8Mhz ZIP chip and an 128K expansion board while the Franklin has a SuperSerial Card (SSC) with a 300 baud modem.  Just 2 weeks ago I was given a 32Meg PC (ugh) with 56k modem but I still do and always will use my 6502s for99% of my work.  I have Turbo Pascal 3.0, Apple Pascal 1.2, Fortran, Mix C,GraForth, many Basics and many other languages that run on these 'olddilapidated' machines.  I got my //e 10 years ago because my Franklin 1000was killed by trying to get the ZIP Chip to work in it. Shortly aftergetting my //e, I saw a NSC at a local electronics store and bought it.  Istill have the original box it came in as well as the instructions andsoftware that came with it.  After I got the NSC, I wrote several utilitiesto display and change its DATA.  One of the latest things that I have doneis get the ProDOS version of ZBasic (vice the CPM version that  alreadyhad) and I have translated these programs to work under that language.A No Slot Clock (NSC) can easily get around the problem of no spare slotsand it provides an excellent clock source that gives more information thana time card does (this was the original question).  In the old //e's itgoes under the CD chip & the documentation has it as the CE (don't theymean CF?) ROM in the newer (it's the only PROM).NOTE:  You will NOT damage your computer if the NSC is in the wrong socketjust as long as you always get the pin orientation of the NSC and ICcorrect (and of course never break off any the pins).Under DOS 3.3, you must first BLOAD CLOCKREAD and do a CALL in order toread data from the NSC or BLOAD CLOCKWRITE and do a CALL in order to writedata to the NSC.  (I use a hello program that I call HELLO.TIME that clearsthe screen and prints out the current time/date and Day Of Week and thenwaits for a keypress before running what was my regular HELLO program).If you are in ProDOS and you just want the time (HH:MM) and date(MM/DD/YY), then you do NOT have to do anything special after you haveloaded (booted with) the altered ProDOS (eg. if you just want your CATalogto be date/time stamped when you do disk operations, like saves, etc. OR ifyou used a specialized BASIC like ZBASIC that has TIME and DATE functionsbuilt into them ).  If you want to get the seconds, hundredths of secondsand the Day Of Week or have these DATA or the time while using DOS 3.3,then you must BLOAD the CLOCKREAD program first and use a CALL statementwhenever you wanted the latest values.From the SetUp disk that comes with the clock, you must do the following:1) First run the INSTALL.BAS program.2) Highlight the SETCLOCK utility and run it to set the time, month, date,   hours and minutes. Select Install Patch to ProDOS System where you will   be asked to install a disk to update the ProDOS.. (If it does not   recognize the version of ProDOS, it will not update it and print out a   message saying so.)3) Then you must reboot your system with this disk in order to use the   clock.Always run the SETCLOCK utility from the utility at least ONCE afterinstalling the clock.This patches the ProDOS to read date and time from the NSC.  As far as Ican recall, this has always been then ONLY way to access the NSC.  I havenever seen or heard of a version for the NSC that was a *.SYSTEM program.However, I have entered and used a *.SYSTEM program that would load and runfirst and would allow you to set the time and date and would then run asecond *.SYSTEM file.  (This was actually a BASIC program that ran 1stafter loading BASIC.SYSTEM and gave you the option of setting any time ordate option and set a default value for changes that were not changed.This allowed you to have your files date/time stamped even though you didNOT have a timecard.  (from Nibble magazine, COMPUTE!, etc.) (does italready do so on a GS ?).Anyway, I could supply them the code to SET, read and write to the NSC(a copy of the 5.25 floppy that came with the NSC).I was never able to figure out how to switch between 12 / 24 hour format(it seems that 12 hour format is a setting of the HI bit (MSB) to 1 in the5th register).  A setting of the 5th bit (2 bits to the right of the MSB)of that register being the bit that indicates AM / PM hours with a 1indicating PM ( stating that bit 5 is the second 10 hour bit (20-23 hours).Dan Wallace   Dan_Wallace@Juno.com  or  wallacde@onizuka.af.mil[EOA][CAT]C FOR THE 8 BIT Apple II""""""""""""""""""""""""First quotes from the January, 1999 issue of The Lamp.--- start of quotes ---C FOR THE 8 BIT II?   You won't find any on disk. The only C-like compiler"""""""""""""""""""   ever created for 8-bit Apple II systems that I'maware of is HyperC, and as far as I know it can only be gotten bydownloading it.(I don't deny the possibility that other 8-bit C compilers have existed forthe II, but I don't know of any for sure :)Eric "Sheppy" ShepherdMacintosh & PowerPC Programmers Forum                       (SHEPPY, 2362, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Actually, there was a compiler called Aztec C from Manx Software"""""   years ago. I expect you'd have to find a used copy at this point.In general, though, the Apple IIc just doesn't have enough memory for a Ccompiler. As you start to use whatever you find, keep that basic fact inmind. If you're serious about C programming, you need a largermachine--like the Apple IIGS.Mike Westerfield                      (BYTEWORKS, 2363, GO COM A2PRO)--- end of quotes ---Now my comments:First, I have and use Apple Pascal 1.2 as well as what I originally had,Turbo Pascal 3.0.There was also the mention of  'Aztec C' for the Apple back in the 80's.However, I have a powerful C that was not mentioned.  It is called 'Mix C'and sold for only $30.  There was also a 'Small C' in the Public  Domainthat I have yet to figure out.The only trouble with Turbo Pascal and Mix C is the fact that you need aCPM board (with a Z80 chip) to order to run them on the Apple.  I hadpurchased an AE Z-80 board for my original Franklin Ace 1000 very early onin order to run Turbo Pascal.  I now have a Franklin Ace 1200 as well as anApple //e (with an 8 Mhz Zip chip), both of which have a Z80 board.This board makes the computer actually '2' computers in one.  It greatlyincreases the available software and greatly enhances the ability of theApple //.  Using the CPM board, I have the 'C', Pascal and Fortran as wellas several Basics (C, G, M, Z etc.) to use as languages in which to writeprograms in on a 'BASIC only' Apple //.What many people do not realize is that CPM, developed by DEC, is whatMSDOS/basic was developed from (on a PDP 1170, like the one I used almost20 years ago) in just a couple of days.  If you know CPM, then you know howto use MSDOS, something that most people cannot do today.  The 'Windows'operating system is just MSDOS with a GUI (graphical interface), one of theoldest of systems.Dan Wallace <Dan_Wallace@juno.com>Dan Wallace <wallacde@onizuka.af.mil>[EOA][LTE]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]KFest 2001""""""""""                                Plan Ahead                                ~~~~~~~~~~KFest 2001 is set for July 25-29 (early arrivals on July 24) at AvilaCollege.
