Here's a brief rundown ofwho did what:Bill Garber of Garberstreet Electronics distinguished himself by being thefirst entrant to complete his challenge. Bill's contribution to theretrocomputing world comes in the form of a slotless ROM switcher for theApple ][ and ][+. The ROM switcher can now be ordered from Bill's site.http://www.garberstreet.comDale Goodfellow (aka wgoodf) took a shot at creating a short "film" withhis Apple //c... Using images created in Dazzle Draw and music played onthe //c, Dale's production is definitely unique.http://80.192.34.202/Sample Files & Templates/rc07warmup.movMark Stock (aka mmphosis) endeavored to create a "one well written Apple IIprogram" and learned a bit about hacking along the way. Mark's hackeremblem program rocks, but his new-found hacker pride is the realaccomplishment.http://geocities.com/mmphosis/apple2/contest/2007/old-computer-challenge.htmlLorance Stinson stepped up to the plate with his Hermes BBS running on aMac IIci. Although not a very busy board, it provided a hangout for themore iron-willed of the challengers (mostly Dale and myself).telnet://lorance.no-ip.orgSimon Williams (aka Luddite) managed to cobble-together a bit of music onthe Apple ][+. It may well be the first time the Apple II has been used inDub.http://www.archive.org/details/Framebreaker-Serial_DubAs an additional project he also put together what is surely the"definitive" guide to authoring web content for the Contiki browser (on anApple II, of course).http://contiki.ld8.org/GUIDE/INDEX.HTMLBigD went back in time for a few weeks of hardcore 68K Mac action, and lefta well written and informative blog in his wake. BigD's conclusion that thechallenge wasn't so tough after all should serve as encouragement to thosewho are too timid to undertake such a test.http://www.dustinr.com/retrochallenge/In closing, I'd just like to thank all the contestants for theircontributions and I hope to see everyone back in the saddle for thisSummer's RetroChallenge!  I mentioned at the start that there were noprizes involved in the Old Computer Challenge, but I've decided that at thevery least everyone who completed their challenge will get an official OldComputer Challenge T-shirt featuring Mark Stock's lo-res hacker emblemdesign... now don't you wish you would have entered?/help._____.|[LD8]! ====== 8-BIT SOUND & FURY ======|  o. | APPLE ][ AUDIO & MUSIC RESOURCES!__!__! http://8bitsoundandfury.ld8.org/(Luddite, a2c.community, Feb 04 2007)[EOA][GCC]gcc Support for 65816?""""""""""""""""""""""A year or so ago there was some discussion about supporting the 65816processor with gcc for Apple II development.

But without a portable linker, there is no pointto make any changes to the rest of binutils (I don't think any changes areneeded in gcc itself--binutils is where the cpu/os-specific code goes).The ownership of the 65816/OMF in binutils means that every time a newversion of binutils is to be released, the 65816 and OMF code gets checkedto make sure that nothing broke.Geoff(geoff, a2c.a2pro_developers, Jan 23 2007)>>>>>""""">> gcc has had 65816 support for quite a while now--it doesn't look likethat the 65816 is being distributed in the latest binutils releases sincethere is no owner. <<The trick is finding someone who wants to take ownership of that.Sheppy(Sheppy, a2c.a2pro_developers, Jan 24 2007)>>>>>"""""a2retro wrote:>> I am aware ofORCA/CMPW IIgs ORCA/CMPW IIgs C<<MPW IIgs C is junk.

It's much more unix (BSD) likethan orca, has command line filename completion, and is much more pleasantthan orca's applesoft/vms/dos/cpm80 inspired syntax2) Use occ.  It's a front-end for orca/c (runs under orca and gnome) thatuses more standard commandline switches, and might be more graceful withlong lines.3) Gnome includes dmake, which is much nicer than trying to build your ownmakefile.For your custom makefile, ProDOS's limited last modified time resolution(1 minute is it?) might be causing you headaches.Kelvin.(kws, a2c.a2pro_developers, Jan 31 2007)>>>>>"""""I've never been able to get GNO/ME to run stably in an emulator.

Those invalid memoryaccess notices should give you an idea of how buggy Orca really is.  KEGSwill always be better than a real IIgs to identify bad memory access (ithelps a lot when you are debugging your own code--sucks a lot using someoneelses).  A real IIgs will gracefully use random values--making the problemmuch harder to track down.  Too bad there is no option other than Orca.This is part of the reason why I had started to advocate that GNU toolswould be a good option for IIgs development.  Orca can be dumped in favorof an environment which has a much higher active development community.  Ifsomebody wants to debug Orca/C, I have some source code on a 10-30 meg diskimage that I would love to see get compiled.  I looked at the Orca/C sourceand decided it wasn't worth my time to figure out (living in the world ofinstant gratification does that to you).Geoff(geoff, a2c.a2pro_developers, Feb 01 2007)>>>>>""""">> I've never been able to get GNO/ME to run stably in an emulator.
