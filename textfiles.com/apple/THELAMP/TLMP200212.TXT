The windslowly moves to the northwest... turning colder and colder... blowingharder and harder.  First a "wet" snow that sticks to everything.  Then a"dry" snow that stays airborne for a long time, blocking visibility.  Hugedrifts of snow form where the wind is slowed by trees or buildings.  Thestorm might last for two or three days.     The rules of survival in a blizzard were very simple... keep plenty offood and fuel on hand and stay home.  On the farm you also had to makecertain that the livestock were sheltered and had plenty of feed and water.     There was no concern that the power would be lost... there was noelectricity.  The fuel reserve was a huge pile of firewood on the porch.Much of the food reserve was found in the "cellar"... bins of home grownpotatoes, squash, and carrots... shelves filled with home grown, homecanned fruits, vegetables, and chicken.  Add the flour, sugar, salt,spices, and home rendered lard found in the kitchen and you could becertain of plenty to eat.     There was always a sense of relaxation during the storm... you had tosuspend many of your usual activities, including school.  Things were quietexcept for the erie howl of the fierce northwest wind.     One of the activities I enjoyed during these times was listening to myhome made crystal radio.  No batteries to run down.  The sound quality lefta lot to be desired.  It only brought in one station.  But there was thesatisfaction of using something I had built myself... the tinkerer'sinstinct was at work at an early age.                     The Tinkerer's Corner This Month                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     This month in the Tinkerer's Corner we create a "one disk" approach toinstalling the IIgs system software on a hard drive.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[MRP]MARKER POSTS""""""""""""Marker post...(LUMITECH, Cat 2, Top 7, Msg 149)>>>>>"""""Just curious, but what are these "Marker Posts" that I have seen on theboards every now and then?Thanks,Dain(A2.DAIN, Cat 2, Top 7, Msg 150)>>>>>"""""When a message is posted and then moved/deleted, a browse of the messageboards will reveal a topic with "1 new message" or so, but no actual newmessages will be displayed.That seems to be when a marker post shows up... though that answers onlythe when, not the why.-Ken(KGAGNE, Cat 2, Top 7, Msg 152)>>>>>"""""You are correct on the "when."

Partition the remainder   of the space with any preferred size of partitions.3. Copy all the files from the Install disk to the first partition.  Change   the name of this partition to Install.4.

Shut down the IIgs.Set the SCSI id number on your "removable media drive" to a number lowerthan your regular hard drive.
