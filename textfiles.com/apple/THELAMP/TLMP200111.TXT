The blue sky, and itsreflection in the water, provide an awe inspiring background for the whitebark of the birch trees.  On the other side of a group of leafless trees inthe distance we see a road that was hidden from view during the summer.  Afork in this road leads to another road that disappears behind a rise inthe land.     The path one's life takes is based on which forks in the road weretaken.  All of us have a common interest in our journey... the Apple IIcomputers.     There is a new group of people who are interested the Apple II.  Theyhave acquired an A2 at a garage sale... or had one given to them... etc.These people are eager to learn what these computers can do and where toget software.     To learn how you can help, see "Letters to the Editor" [ATP], Apple IIFOREVER PROJECTS [AFP], and Apple II DOCUMENTATION PROJECT [ADP] in thisissue.     A fork in the road has led many Apple II users to yet anotherexperience... K-Fest.  You have never been to K-Fest?  You really ought totry it.  Can't find the fork in the road leading to K-Fest?

That spells doom for the remaining gopher sitesthat are still up.  A quick check on gopher in the last year resulted inalot of dead links and nothing interesting to see.Gopher has served its purpose and was not as easily expandable as what theWeb has grown into.  It was nice in its time when there was no Web to lookfor information.The concept of its use was simple.  Everything was indexed-based.  Yourhome index had links to sub-indexes and/or files and through some path oflinks, a link to a master index by country, state, site.  Each item in anindex pointed to another index or to a file, ftp file or directory, telnetserver, or web page.  Files linked from an index followed a certain set oftypes as specified in the RFCs.  This was pretty much limited to text,"binary", sound, graphic, animation, and "unknown" files.By the way, there was also a Jughead.  Jughead was a serch tool for a setof servers (instead of all of them).  Jughead only worked if there was ajughead server set up on the gopher sites.  It is my understanding that itwas difficult to set up a jughead server and not well maintained.Also, for more information about Code Red and Nimda, take a look at theselinks:http://www.incidents.org/react/nimda.pdfhttp://www.incidents.org/react/code_redII.phpGeoff(GEOFF, Cat 11, Top 11, Msg 38)[EOA][FGV]THE FUTURE OF Apple II GIF VIEWING PROGRAMS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Does the Unisys patent spell the end for Apple II GIF viewing programs?Will anyone write a new or updated GIF viewer?Ryan(A2.RYAN, Cat 12, Top 3, Msg 6)>>>>>"""""The gif/lzw patent is #4,558,302 if anyone wants to check it out at the USpatent office homepage: uspto.gov.It was filed december 10, 1985, which means it expires December 10, 2005(20 years).

Packet times are mostly useless since the IIgs can't track time lessthan 1/60th of a second (and even that time scale is not guaranteed).Tracking sequence numbers would have meant I had to develop a queuingsystem which goes beyond a simple ping tool.

Keycommands display various display screens, and optionally enter Pixie ifnecessary, maintaining absolute system state due to interrupts beingdisabled. As more and more system functions required interrupt support, thesituations where you could use FREDA became less and less, and GSBugobtained a lot more features as Dave took over the project inside Apple.Anyway, FREDA still has it's specific uses, particularly on projects I tendto work on which seem to be more often system level functionality whereinterrupts are involved. The display is neat, because from memory it usesmultiple text colours using scan lines, which is fine because interruptsare disabled.Regards, Richard(RICHARDB, Cat 54, Top 43, Msg 4)[EOA][PDT]Pixie DEBUGGING TOOL FOR THE Apple IIgs"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Pixie is a debugging tool for the Apple IIgs, which never really took offin the U.S.Pixie took the tried and true route of looking like a disk zap utility(like Bag of Trix Zap or similar), which at the time was the preferred wayof looking at memory on most computing platforms. Unfortunately for Pixie,Dave Lyons' Nifty List gains a firm footing in the U.S. around the sametime, mostly due I suspect to his contacts with the developer community(this was before he joined Apple from memory). I don't like shell baseddebuggers, never have, never will, and I was amazed that many Apple IIgsdevelopers did.Pixie displayed $100 bytes of memory at a time, in hex and ASCII, with manyfunctions for navigation, searching and displaying memory. It could dumpall the toolbox and system memory structures which Nifty List eventuallysupported, but also included descriptions of each field, and the ability tofollow links between data structures, follow handles with a single keypress, following memory links, display memory handles, show loaded filestheir names and locations, jump up and down between memory allocations anda heap of other stuff I can't even remember.It supported editable data structure templates, so you could add your ownon top of all the toolbox and system ones, it supported it's own COP alaFREDA for interrupt sensitive environments, drop to monitor (while disabledif you wished), print a complete map of memory with legend for every handleand who owns it and their pathname. You can display all handles owned by anapp or some other userid, the list goes on...For me Nifty List involved too much typing. With Pixie, simple key pressesallowed you to bounce in display what you need and bounce back out. The COPsupport also allowed you to preempt the memory address to display, couplethis with appropriate assembly macros and the options are quite extensive.Then again, if you'd never used a disk editor or a memory zap utility onanother platform, you'd probably find Pixie difficult to use. For my likinghowever, it was a better metaphor for debugging memory than Nifty List.GSBug did stepping and tracing just fine, so it's the missing features thatprogrammers should have been looking at, and that's why it looked andbehaved the way it did.<takes a breath>Does that make sense? :-)Regards, Richard(RICHARDB, Cat 54, Top 43, Msg 5)>>>>>"""""Pixie sounds pretty cool.

I now try to stop by for a look every weekend butsometimes forget and go two weeks without stopping by.I try to keep up on what's going on in the Apple II area of syndicomm.combut I'm going to have to start from scratch once I get myself set up todeal with messages there easier. I'm also back to reading the apple2 usenetnewsgroups after not having read a single message there in three months orso.I would love to use my IIgs, which is set up beside my PC, every day butunfortunately I don't always get the chance. I still use my IIgs forprogramming, gaming and communications. I also use my IIgs for those raretimes when I actually have to print something as I own better wordprocessing and desktop publishing software for it than I have for my PC. :)I'm getting a rather large collection of stuff now and I really need toorganize all this stuff one of these days. That is something that I'mlooking forward to as I'm sure I'll come across some great stuff that I'veforgotten about.Jeff Blakeney(JBLAKENEY, 3530.7, Delphi A2 web side)[EOA]------------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------[ATP]Apple II DOCUMENTATION PROJECT""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Date: Mon, 29 Oct 2001 17:10:58 -0800From: Eric Shepherd <sheppy@syndicomm.com>To: lyle@syndicomm.comSubject: Letter to the editorHi, Lyle.
