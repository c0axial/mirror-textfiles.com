Excepting the esoteric and eccentric(including myself) who find ::ahem:: creative ways to use the Apple II forcommunications, the way to get online is to hook up a modem.  While a fewinternal modems for the Apple II exist (none sold new), it's generallyaccepted that an external modem is the way to go for Apple II use.  Manydifferent brands and models of external modems exist--we won't get intocomparing or recommending these (although if you must ask, my favorite isthe 3Com/USR Courier V.Everything).  What we will do, instead, is look atsome of the other issues around connecting a modem to an Apple II (in thisarticle, the Apple IIc), primarily addressing cables.     First off, let's remember something simple: the maximum speed of theserial port on the Apple IIc is 19200 baud.  There is, then, no need for amodem faster than 14400 baud--perhaps even slower, which we will addressshortly--for use with these computers.  Of course, if someone gives you a28800, 33600, or 57600 modem, don't look a gift horse in the mouth--justrealize that at most, your serial port will top out at 19200, so there isvery little extra speed to squeeze out of a faster modem.THE PINOUTS   The Apple IIc uses a DIN 5 connector on its serial ports."""""""""""   Therefore, any cable you attach to it must have a male DIN 5connector.     Each of the five pins on the Apple IIc serial port has a differentelectrical signal associated with it.  As per Apple Computer, Inc.'s TechInfo Library, the signals are as follows:1-----Data Terminal Ready (DTR)2-----Transmit Data (TXD)3-----Signal Ground (GND)4-----Receive Data (RXD)5-----Data Set Ready (DSR)     Looking at the female plug on the rear of the IIc, the pins are asfollows;(ASCII art follows, for the visually impaired)   ----v---- /          \/            \| 5         1 || o 4     2 o |\   o  3  o  /  \    o    /    --------(End ASCII art)     In a nutshell, pins two and four actually do the moving of data; pinthree provides ground, and pins one and five do "handshaking"--making surethat the computers are talking to each other properly and not missing any(or many) characters.  Handshaking is a way of saying, "Hey, you're going alittle too quickly for me--can you stop for a minute?"  Once the computerthat requested the slow down is ready again, it sends another signalsaying, "Okay, I'm ready now, go ahead."  There are many different ways todo handshaking, both in hardware and software.  At speeds exceeding 9600baud, hardware handshaking--which is faster--is the preferred method;however, due to the few signals available at its port for handshaking(there are several other handshaking signals available on both the AppleIIgs and Super Serial Card commonly used for telecommunications on theApple IIe), the Apple IIc does not appear to be able to reliablycommunicate at 19200.  It does work fine at 9600 baud.     Virtually every external modem on the market that does not have abuilt-in cable (and I'm not very fond of such modems, because I want tohave the option of testing and replacing the cable if I'm havingdifficulty) has a female DB 25 connector to attach a serial cable to.Therefore, the other end of your Apple IIc modem cable needs to have a maleDB 25 connector.     Like the IIc's DIN 5 port, the pins on the DB 25 have signalsassociated with them.  Since there are more pins on a DB 25 connector thana DIN 5 connector, there are, as you would expect, more signals.  While weare not going to detail every signal on the port, we will highlight some ofthe more important ones. 2-----Transmit Data (TXD) 3-----Receive Data (RXD) 4-----Ready To Send (RTS) 5-----Clear To Send (CTS) 6-----Data Set Ready (DTS) 7-----Signal Ground (GND) 8-----Data Carrier Detect (DCD)20-----Data Terminal Ready (DTR)     Looking at the female connector on the modem, the pins are as follows:(ASCII art follows, for the visually impaired) 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1 _______________________________________\ o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o / \ o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o /   ----------------------------------  25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14(End ASCII art)THE CONNECTIONS   So, to connect these two devices, computer serial port to"""""""""""""""   modem, a fairly simple cable is needed.  The three basicsignals--GND, TXD, and RXD--are where we start.     Since we are communicating with a modem device, we know all we have todo is match up the appropriate signals on the serial port--GND to GND, TXDto TXD, and RXD to RXD.  So, using a male DIN 5 plug and a male DB25connector, our cable starts very simply:Male DIN 5                      Male DB25  Signal    1                                       DTR    2<-----------------------------> 2      TXD    3<-----------------------------> 7      GND    4<-----------------------------> 3      RXD    5                                       DSR     That was simple.  Now that that's done, let's connect the other pinsfor handshaking.  While we could get into a largely technical discussionabout what all of these pins mean and the importance of connecting them,since this is really "The Least You Need To Know", let's just hook up whatwe need to hook up, like so:Male DIN 5                      Male DB25  Signal                    +--------------> 4      RTS    1<-----------------------------> 20     DTR    2<-----------------------------> 2      TXD    3<-----------------------------> 7      GND    4<-----------------------------> 3      RXD    5<-----------------------------> 6      DSR     In this example, pins four and twenty on the DB25 male are shortedtogether and connected to pin one on our DIN 5 connector.THE PARTS   You can obtain every single part (as well as tool) you need for"""""""""   this cable at Radio Shack or, usually more cheaply, at a localelectronics store.     The parts you need:     DB 25 male solder cup connector     DB 25 hood     DIN 5 male connector (usually comes with hood)     wire (I usually use Category 5 Ethernet cable, but that's just becauseI have lots of that lying around my computer dungeon)     The tools you need:     Soldering iron     Solder     ScrewdriversTHE END?   Hopefully not.  As we continue our look at "The Least You Need""""""""   To Know" we will continue to discuss different types of projectsyou can do to keep your Apple II alive.[EOA][FTE]------------------------------        "Time in a Bottle" Visited |-----------------------------------From The Editor"""""""""""""""by Lyle Syverson, Editor, _The Lamp!_ , <lyle@FoxValley.net>Time in a Bottle is an awesome collection of software for the Apple IIcomputers.

The one I especiallyliked was the AllFiles.SHK found on each of the two CD's.  When this fileis unshrunk you have a huge Appleworks Database which includes all thefiles available.  Use the search function to locate a file or group offiles to meet your needs.Once you have your computer equipped with a CD-ROM drive you will want tocheck on other CD's that are available for your Apple II.

Therefore, Silvern Castle will no longerhave a shareware status.However, to get a unique registration serial number and password to unlockall features of Silvern Castle, and to access the additional scenarios, Imust insist you request one by email. In this way, I can notify those whoregister with future update releases, and provide some limited support andhelp. By the way, I'll certainly accept the original $15 fee, or anydonation, from anyone who wishes to support my programming efforts.By requesting a >free< registration number, you will be sent instructionson how to get the talisman from Ragon's Lab (you cannot complete the firstscenario without it), and you will be able to access future scenarios(including the additional second and third ones that have already beenreleased). Also, by registering, the shareware patrols on the deeperlevels, as well as most of the annoying ambushes will no longer menace yourparty.I hope no one who paid the shareware fee is upset by this announcement. Ifit wasn't for your support I wouldn't have released the 7 updates and 2additional scenarios.What I wish to accomplish by changing Silvern Castle to freeware status isto increase the user base. If I don't get an additional viable support basewho appreciates my work, I will be left without any incentive to continuefurther releases.At this point, Silvern Castle rests in the hands of the A2 community.Please support those who continue to support the A2.II Infinitum,Jeff Fink {<mailto:finkjsc@yahoo.com> finkjsc@yahoo.com}(FINKSTERJ, 33028, GO COM A2)[EOA][FDM]FORWARDING DELPHI MAIL""""""""""""""""""""""> You can also forward your (Delphi) mail from here elsewhere...For those of us with short memory retention, would you explain how to setit up to forward?

Added support for batch mode, in which you can make lots of images   quickly from the same drive. After each image is made, the disk is   ejected and you're asked for another disk.2. Now uses the DiskCopy creator code for DiskCopy 4.2 and DiskCopy 6   images.3. Now supports 400 KB and 720 KB sizes for DiskCopy 4.2 images.4. Plays the Bad Disk sound if an I/O error occurs, and Task Completed when   imaging finishes (except in batch mode).5. Added the option to ignore bad blocks, and to add Universal Disk Image   files a list of the bad blocks.6. Also, AppleShare volumes are no longer listed in the disk picker, since   you can't make images of them anyway.ImageMaker is shareware and costs $5. You can get more information anddownload the software at<http://www.sheppyware.net/products/a2/imagemaker>.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 33107, GO COM A2)[EOA][GID]GShisen 1.2.1 IN DATABASE""""""""""""""""""""""""" Name: GSHISEN2K.BXY (Entertainment Software) Date: 9-SEP-2000 04:13   By: KWS Size: 34688GShisen 1.2.1 (aka 2000).

The name of the CD is DeluxeWare,named by and after its creators. So, their web site might be gone, butBrutal Deluxe's legacy will live on...on CD-ROM!Once available, a 2nd bonus CD - entitled "Le CD-ROM" - will be includedfree-of-charge. Created by Brutal Deluxe for the French Apple IIGS UserGroup, Le CD-ROM almost defies description. For the most part, it's reallyintended to be viewed on a Mac or PC, as it contains QuickTime movies thatare Apple II related.What's prevented me from making those 2 CDs available is that I feel it'sabsolutely necessary for me to catalog DeluxeWare. And, with 600 or moremegabytes of Apple II/IIGS software on it, that's time consuming.Once released, the cost will be $25 for the 2 CD package, and you'll beable to order it via credit card from the SSII Kagi site. I'll let you allknow when.And no, that's not the incredible earth-shaking announcement thatShareware Solutions II has planned for the near future ;-)Joe Kohnhttp://users.foxvalley.net/~joko(JOE_KOHN, 33054, GO COM A2)[EOA][ILP]IMPRESSIVE LIST OF PROGRAMS FOR USE WITH MARINETTI""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""What programs are there for TCP/IP and the IIGs?TCP/IP Stack:------------         Title: Marinetti       Version: v2.0.1        Author: Richard BennettAvailable from: Marinetti Web Page                http://www.apple2.org/marinetti/Web browsers:------------         Title: Arachnid preview release 2 by Kim Howe       Version: Preview release 2        Author: Kim HoweAvailable from: Kim Howe's Web Site                http://www.omninet.net.au/~khowe/arachnid/index.html         Title: Spectrum Internet Suite (aka SIS)       Version: v1.1 (v1.1.1 is in the works)        Author: Geoff WeissAvailable from: My eSource Web Site      http://www.myesource.com/sevenhills/applesoftware/sis/sis.htmE-mail:------         Title: Spectrum Automated Mailer (aka SAM)       Version: v1.2        Author: Ewen WannopAvailable from: Shareware Solutions II                http://users.foxvalley.net/~joko/sam.htmlFTP:---         Title: gwftp       Version: v1.1b2        Author: Geoff WeissAvailable from: Delphi's A2 Forum File Library                Shareware Solutions II                   http://www.foxvalley.net/~joko/                Juiced.GS                   http://www.wbwip.com/juiced.gs/Telnet:------         Title: Telnet       Version: v1.0        Author: Richard BennettAvailable from: Marinetti Home Page                http://www.apple2.org/marinetti/                   (included in the Marinetti archive)         Title: Spectrum       Version: v2.3 (v2.2 was the first Marinetti aware version)        Author: Ewen WannopAvailable from: My eSource Web Site      http://www.myesource.com/sevenhills/applesoftware/iigs/sp.htmInstant Chat:------------         Title: gsAIM (AOL Instant Messenger client)       Version: v1.1        Author: Eric "Sheppy" ShepherdAvailable from: Sheppyware Web Site                http://www.sheppyware.net/products/a2/gsaim/Utilities:---------         Title: finger, ping and whois       Version: I don't think they have versions        Author: Geoff WeissAvailable from: Included with gwftp and are shell based utilities                Delphi's A2 Forum Library                Shareware Solutions II                   http://www.foxvalley.net/~joko/                Juiced.GS                   http://www.wbwip.com/juiced.gs/         Title: TimeZone CDEV and Tool       Version: v1.0.3        Author: Geoff WeissAvailable from: Delphi's A2 Forum Library                Shareware Solutions II                   http://www.foxvalley.net/~joko/                Juiced.GS                   http://www.wbwip.com/juiced.gs/         Title: Hash Tool       Version: v1.0        Author: Geoff WeissAvailable from: Delphi's A2 Forum Library                Shareware Solutions II                   http://www.foxvalley.net/~joko/                Juiced.GS                   http://www.wbwip.com/juiced.gs/Did I miss anything? :-)There is also still more internet software in the works that haven't beenreleased yet. :-) Jeff Blakeney Dean of the Apple II University in the A2Pro forum(JBLAKENEY, 33126, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""> Title: TimeZone CDEV and Tool> Title: Hash ToolThese tools do not require Marinetti at all.

WOULD YOU BUY IT?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hi all,I was recently asked about the possibility of putting all of the ByteWorks' products onto a collection CD. I have my doubts about whether such athing would sell enough to make it worth doing, but I promised to check.What we're talking about would be a CD with all of the Byte Works programs,but not the APDA programs. A few Byte Works programs would not be includedbecause of contractual arrangements. This includes ORCA/Disassembler,Talking Tools, Ugly Duckling and Design Master. All of the other Byte Worksproducts could be on the CD, both the Apple II and Apple IIGS versions.This includes the ORCA programming languages, the Quick Click productivitysoftware and GSoft BASIC.For a complete list, see{<http://www.byteworks.org.> http://www.byteworks.org.}Most of our documentation was done in Microsoft Word, and could be suppliedin Word format on the CD. Some of the Apple II software was done with somereally old word processors, and I probably can't recover the text inmachine readable format without more work that I am likely to put into thisproject. There is one notable exception: Microsoft Word refuses to read theORCA/C 2.0 documentation. All I have is ASCII. It's possible, but a bit ofwork, to create PDF files.Considering the number of programs involved, the work is not unsubstantial,so I would have to expect a lot of response to justify that effort.I could make printed documentation available as well, but that would cost abit.It's also barely possibly I might collect all of the source and make thatavailable on a separate release. That would require a license, signed inadvance, limiting the orders to those sent by mail.With all of this in mind, if you are interested, please answer thesequestions:1. Is Mac OS HFS OK for the format, or would you need a dual-platform   (Mac/Windows) format?2. What is the best format for the documentation? The reasonably viable   choices are Word, PDF and ASCII.3. Would you want the CD to contain Apple II disk images or simply folders?   If the CD contains disk images, what program should be used? Think about   your answer to #1!4. Would it bother you that the CD was a CD-R and not a mass-produced CD?   (It would be in a nice jewel case with appropriate printed covers.)5. How much would you pay for this product?6. Would you me interested in source code? If so, how much additional would   you pay?Mike Westerfield(BYTEWORKS, 33157, GO COM A2)[EOA][FCD]A FASTER CD_ROM DRIVE FOR THE Apple II""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I'm feeling a need for a faster CD player but I'm not sure which drives arecompatible so I'm hoping that if someone's using a drive faster than a 4xwith a Ramfast SCSI card they would be kind enough to tell me which drivethey're using.Wayne(WAYNEJ, 32700, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""Wayne,I'm using a Toshiba 40x CDROM drive with my RamFAST.

I would say a 4X or 6Xdrive would be optimal, with a 2 or 3X still being quite respectable forthe GS's needs.My main concern when looking for a SCSI CD-ROM is whether it can read mostCDR's (some drives have trouble with certain colors) and if it can playaudio CD's.Mitchell Spector {<mailto:spec@total.net> spec@total.net}(SPECTOR1, 32910, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""> Yeahbut...at what point does the speed become irrelevant, since you're> constricted by the SCSI-1 interface and the processing power of the> machine?

But when the authors, software companies, and copies of somesoftware (NOTE: *some* software) is long gone, is it truly a crime to keepit, even though the copy that was received is exactly that, an illegalcopy?I am, and probably always will be, an average Apple II user. I use my copyof AppleWorks 2.0 on a 128k IIe and my IIgs for my personal journal, and towrite poetry and such. I play games like Master of the Lamps becausethey're the only games I really enjoy. I use my bound copy of an archive ofOpenApple and A2Central magazines when I'm stuck with a problem. And I knowenough Applesoft Basic to write whatever simple utility that I think Ineed.But, do I have to give all of this up? Do I have to throw away all of theVCR tapes I've made of movies and TV shows because they're copies and notbought from NBC or CBS or whoever? Do I throw away the audio tapes given tome by friends because I never bought the albums? Do I burn my A2Centralarchive book because I didn't even know about them when they existed? Do Ithrow away my Apple II equipment because I never bought anything from Appleitself in my life?Maybe I'm going to extremes, but as I said, I'm an average user who wouldlike to know what he can do to have his software, and eat it too (so tospeak).(I don't, just for reference, give out my software collection.

I believe that you AREgoing to extremes.Those who publicly and steadfastly oppose Apple II piracy, and are notafraid to speak out about it, are primarily targeting their outrage at afew online archive creators and maintainers whose standards for providingaccess to software titles are lax, if non-existent. They post titles on awhim without regard to the copyright holder's wishes, then claim it's up tothe copyright holder to object rather than their moral responsibility toask permission first. Twisted reasoning, to be sure.The pirates try to shift the argument away from their actions by allegingthat anti-piracy folks are attacking normal Apple II users. That's absurd,but in some cases the claim manages to divert attention from the real issueat hand.You can do your part to uphold reasonable standards of responsibility byacknowledging that online archive creators/maintainers must gain permissionto upload out-of-print commercial software titles before doing so.

My original thought was to usemultisessions as a way of partitioning a CD. I thought it would be a greatto have each of the 6.0.1 installation disks on a separate partition.Instead, since I could only read one session, I produced a few 800k CDsbefore I realized I could make single session partitioned CDs.Wayne(WAYNEJ, 32908, GO COM A2)[EOA][DVW]Delphi VIA WEB SIDE WITH Apple IIgs"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Question from the editor...Is there a way to access the Delphi web side using an Apple II computer?>>>>>"""""Yes.

It wasan historical/political article. If my memory serves me right, they got thecontext of the 2GS wrong. They were talking about graphical user interfaceson top of operating systems and said that the GEOS system came out for the2GS. My recollection is that GEOS was for the Apple IIe. Was there ever a2GS specific version?- James(JAMES3000, 3182, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""No, there was never a IIgs specific version of GEOS that I ever heard of.However, not only did that article use the wrong model name for theirexample (and even spelled that wrong, apparently) they also didn't get avery good example of a GUI on top of an operating system. I've been lead tobelieve that GEOS uses its own disk operating system that happens to have avery similar structure (almost exact but adding the ability to use spacesin file names) to ProDOS. So, from what I understand, GEOS is a completeoperating system on its own. Jeff Blakeney Dean of the Apple II University in the A2Pro forum(JBLAKENEY, 3185, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""The PC version of GEOS (although I think it went by a different name) was aGUI shell that sat on top of MS-DOS.GEOS on the Apple II sat on top of a heavily-hacked version of ProDOS.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 3187, GO COM A2P)[EOA]LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:"""""""""""""""""""""[LTE]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]KFest 2001""""""""""                                Plan Ahead                                ~~~~~~~~~~KFest 2001 is set for July 25-29 (early arrivals on July 24) at AvilaCollege.
