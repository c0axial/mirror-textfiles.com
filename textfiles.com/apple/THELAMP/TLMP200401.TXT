Brings to mind hot Summers some sixtyyears ago.     Now the hot weather was welcome on the farm... "good corn growingweather".  No electricity... no refrigerator.  The ice man stopped by everyother day.  He harvested ice from a nearby lake in the winter and sold icedoor to door for people's ice boxes.  A little boy could depend on a freechunk of ice to melt in his mouth... a real treat on a hot summer day.(That ice was really refreshing when you didn't stop to think that it wasfrom a lake!)     Since refrigeration was limited to an ice box, people were always onthe lookout for foods that didn't require refrigeration... canned meats forexample.  One of the products that we used was... uh... Spam.     We never had any idea that someday this product would lend its name tounwanted email.     Email has been a very useful means of communication.  But it hasbecome rather tedious to wade through all those unwanted messages and sortout those that you want.     Just think... you can send off for a device that will reduce thegasoline consumption of your automobile by 27% or more... and it is easy toinstall... just clamp it on the outside of the fuel line.  Duh.     As you can see in this issue, spam is a topic of conversation in theA2 Forum at Syndicomm Online.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TEP]TextEdit UPDATE (or) NEW WORD PROCESSOR"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""If TextEdit was to be updated, the two big things I can think of that wouldbe needed are multiple rulers and tables (where anything can go in a cell).And it would also be neat if a graphic bitmap could be inserted anywhere inthe text.

All of thatsaid. . .The modern email client on other platforms is a very complex thing; itinvolves an address book, an editor, a database to store messages in,searching and sorting utilities, file encoders and decoders. . . while SAMhas much of this built in, I'm wondering what folks think of the approachof using FExts and NDAs to handle some of the separate duties.

Like...resource rText(messagenumber) contains the body of the messageresource rSubjectText(messagenumber) contains the subject of the messageresource rFrom(messagenumber)resource rTo(messagenumber)resource rCc(messagenumber)And so forth.That would make it relatively easy to manage the mailbox using ResourceManager calls.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 11, Top 21, Msg 25)>>>>>"""""I don't like the resource method you are suggesting.  It breaks anycompatibility to access email messages from command line tools.I suggest instead to store messages using the standard mdir format (eachmessage is a separate file complete with all the headers as retrieved fromthe POP/IMAP/whatever server).  But, there should be an indexed databasewhich has stored the byte locations of key header lines and the start ofthe body (and I would recommend also tracking the start of the .sig usingthe format suggested by emacs--which coincidently SIS follows :).  It evenmakes sense to duplicate some of the key headers (From, To, CC, Subject,Date, etc.) to be also stored in the indexed database for quick sorting(otherwise you will have to open a lot of mail files to do any sorting orheader searching).  As far as I know, there are no database libraries forthe GS so that would require some work to implement.  I have no idea howhard it would be to port newdb.And since each message is stored in mdir format, one can use any number ofexisting tools to access the messages to do cool stuff (i.e. spam blocking,etc.).So Ryan, I'm not sure which aspect of mail reading you have troubledeciding how to implement.

But this really needsa fast processor, lots of RAM, etc. to take advantage of efficiently.I completely forgot about attachments until you brought it up Sheppy.I prefer having attachments as part of the message file just to keep thingsbetter organized.  It just seems cumbersome with some email programs whereto delete an email, you have to remove the "message part" and then gothrough and remove the "attachment part".Of course, you could have message where the MIME parts are like this:textfiletextfilefiletextAll of the text segments will need to be displayed in the body of themessage.  And since the attachments can be pretty long, one would need totrack the start and length of each MIME segment for quicker display andattachment handling.  That information can be stored in the index databaseas well.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 11, Top 21, Msg 29)>>>>>""""">> For me, it's more in the interface concept. <<Let's look at three different styles of how email clients handle thereading of messages.  There are a few more (and variations), but this willhelp you to get started to think about where to start.3-PANE APPROACHThis is considered the modern the interface for an email client.  The emailwindow is split into three areas: folder list, message, list, and message(or message preview).  Typically, the list of folders appear in the leftwindow pane, the list of messages in that folder (inbox, outbox,to-be-deleted, user-folders) appear in the top-right window pane, and themessage content in the bottom-right pane.Advantages: easy access to all the messages--content is available all inone window.Disadvantages: lots of scrolling since everything is all in the samescreen, requires lots of screen real estate which the GS does not have.Notes: works great if you have lots of folders, cumbersome if you have lotsof messages in a specific folder.This option is not basically optimal for the GS due to 640x200 resolution.You want the width of the screen just to view a message.2-PANE APPROACHBasically, you have some sort of menu to select which folder you want toaccess (menu bar, select via a dialog box, etc).  Once the folder isselected, you then display a window with two panes--the top has the list ofmessages and the bottom has the message content.Advantages: message content fills the width of the screen, folder contentis wider so more information can be displayed (from, subject, date, size,etc.).Disadvantages: Height of panes is very short--around 10-11 lines of text isvisible in each pane.  Requires several steps to switch to a differentfolder.This provides the most information based on the GS screen real estatespace.  But how often do you need to be viewing the list of messages in thefolder at the same time as viewing the message itself?TEXT-SCREEN APPROACHDepending on which font is used, you typically have less charactersavailable on the super hires screen than you do with the Apple II textscreen.   So it may be better to start thinking how text-screen emailprograms operate since they are designed to fit in a 80x24 character space.Two feature-rich programs are pine and elm.  Between these two, I am morefamiliar with pine.It might be better to take a look at something like pine and "Gui-ify" itsoperation for the GS.Since you are looking at making an NDA instead of a regular application,you could get away without having a menu bar and just have a bunch ofbuttons to navigate among the menus/screens.Emulating the pine or elm structure would allow a UNIX Apple II to easilyadapt to a GS email client.The NDA windows will have to be the size of the GS screen anyway--there isno point to make it any smaller--you have to assume after a bit of use,there will be lots of folders, lots of messages in a folder, and largemessages to be read.If you really want a more Apple GUI look and feel, then you will have tolook at really old versions of Pegasus, Eudora, etc.When the email app starts up, you display a window with a list of folders.The user then double clicks on the folder to bring up a new window with alist of messages.  The user then double clicks on the message to bring up anew window with the message content.  At this point, there are threewindows open--all the size of the screen.  Things get messy fast once youstart moving a window so you can see the one behind it and openingadditional windows.  Forcing everything into a single window using atext-like-email interface will prevent that from happening.There are ways to GUI-ify something like pine or elm to work within asingle pane and single window interface (menu bar with menus, etc.).  ButI'll let that be an exercise for the student.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 11, Top 21, Msg 30)>>>>>""""">> If you really want a more Apple GUI look and feel, then you will have tolook at really old versions of Pegasus, Eudora, etc. <<I've been kind of looking at those, as well as thinking that looking atother email clients for platforms with small screens (Palm, Newton, maybeeven something like the Danger Sidekick) might give some ideas.I'm wondering if a GS interface with tabs (pioneered by Geoff Weiss on theIIgs :) might be usable in this case.Ryan(A2.RYAN, Cat 11, Top 21, Msg 32)>>>>>"""""You're ignoring my personally favorite interface for email -- Themulti-window approach.  One window with a list of folders in one pane and alist of messages in another, and when you double-click a message, a newwindow opens with that message's content.I think this approach would work the best on the Apple IIgs screen.  Itoptimizes the use of the screen for each thing you're looking at.As for attachments, what about creating a structure like this:Mail/        Inbox/                Index           <-- index of messages                Message1        <-- text file                Message2        <-- text file                Message3/       <-- folder                        Body    <-- text file                        Attachment1                        Attachment2                Message4        <-- text fileAnd so forth.  This keeps messages and attachments together and you cankeep in your index whether or not the message is a text file or a folder,and that's also easy enough to determine when reindexing.This would be pretty fast, and it would be relatively efficient.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 11, Top 21, Msg 31)>>>>>""""">> I'm wondering if a GS interface with tabs (pioneered by Geoff Weiss onthe IIgs :) might be usable in this case. <<I'm not sure I see how tabs would work well for an email program.

For less savvy users, the"text-screen" approach will be less confusing to operate and hence, moreuseful.

A menu bar and atabbed interface takes the same number of lines so might as well usesomething that is already built in the IIgs toolbox.The only reason to not use a menu bar if you needed the screen real estate.That would then force a text-like interface operating much like pine orelm.I would argue that a menu bar is pretty much necessary.It should be noted how much vertical screen real estate is already used up(assuming the NDA is the size of the desktop):System Menu BarNDA Window EdgesNDA Window TitleNDA Menu BarThat gives you about 15 lines of Shaston text to work with.  If you decideto display emails using Courier, you are down to 12 lines of text.If you want more lines of text, you will have to seriously consider to makeyour email client an application instead of an NDA.  And you would only get1-2 more lines.The menu bar approach is more intuitive then a bunch of tabs.  The trickcomes down to what you use for the menus and menu items.  The approach Iwould take is look at the different versions of Eudora from 1.x to thelatest.  See what was added, removed, changed, etc.  Compare it to otheremail applications such as Netscape, Outlook Express, etc.  Make sure youlook at systems other than Macs too--looking at Palms and other PDAs isgood, but also other mainstream Operating Systems too (don't forget to lookat SAM too).  Compared to PDAs, you have a lot of horizontal space so makesure you take advantage of that (assuming 640 mode--you might not want tosupport 320 mode).But at this point, menu design is less important considering the list offeatures need to be decided on.  Modern-day email clients are much morefeature-full than older ones--all those features take time to implement.For example, right clicking on an email address may throw a pop-up menuwhere one of the options is to add that address to the address book.  Thatdoesn't have to be implemented when the user can easily copy the address,select a menu option to add an address, paste the address in a field andclick an add button.  This is much simpler development and you can consideradding user interface shortcuts in later releases.Trust me on this, you will have a difficult enough time parsing MIMEencoded messages that you don't want to get bogged down with too much userinterface implementation.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 11, Top 21, Msg 38)>> As for attachments, what about creating a structure like this <<Lets look at the operations needed to be written:- add message to folder- delete message to folder- move message to another folder- read message in folder- save attachmentWith my proposed solution, this is what has to be written (order ofoperations aren't necessarily correct here):- add message to folder.  - write message to disk.  - parse message for headers and MIME segments.  - add to index.  add headers and MIME segments to index.- delete message.  - delete file.  - remove item from index.- move message.  - write file to new folder.  - delete old file.  - delete old index entry.  - write new index entry (may need to parse message again if it wasn't    saved).- read message.  - read index entry.  - read file (may be multiple operations if multiple text segments exist).  - write to screen.- save attachment.  - pull start and length of attachment from index.  - read and write bytes.With your proposed suggestion:- add message.  - write message to disk (do you really want to assume there is enough    memory to download a large message.  Remember, this is a NDA and there    could be a memory-hog application running).  - parse message for headers and MIME segments.  - if multiple segments, rename file, create a directory.    - create new segments of the message and write those files.    - delete the original file.  - add to index.  add headers, MIME segments, MIME segment file names,    etc. to index.-move message  - you get the picture.- delete message.  - if a file, delete file, delete index entry.  - if a directory, delete files, delete directory, delete index entry.- read message.  - exercise left to the reader.  More steps needed.- save attachment  - read filename from index  - read and write bytes.I just see that your proposed solution is more complicated and longer towrite which results in more debugging time.I think using a standard format such as mdir would allow existingapplications to access the content of the email messages (as suggestedbefore, such as spam filtering).

Instead, I want to focus on the story of Wolfenstein3D, which has been mentioned several times in this series so far. Thistime, the information I can share is gathered from sources other than theLamp publications, so I will be indeed "illuminating" the Lamp. Previouslyyou have heard bits and pieces of the tale; but you've never heard theentire story before now. Consider it a sidebar off of the last column.     The story will be presented in four major parts. The first looks atCastle Wolfenstein, the game that inspired it all; the second deals withthe PC development of Wolf 3D on the PC; the third with the Apple IIGSdevelopment; and the fourth with comments about the game itself.THE SAGA BEGINS     The games you play when you first learn how to use a computer aresometimes the ones that stay with you the longest. They may have beensimplistic, stupid, or even annoying by your standards of today, but theywere special to YOU, because you spent hours and hours playing them andlearning about your computer, sometimes by hacking them. This is especiallythe case for those who were introduced to a computer while they were inschool, and "grew up" with it. And if you started with your Apple II in theearly 1980's, you had some great games on which to spend your time.     One of the pioneering Apple II companies that provided games for theplatform was MUSE Software. Founded in 1978 by Silas Warner and Ed Zaron,they got their start by selling software on cassette tape for the IntegerBASIC-only Apple II. As the technology advanced, they moved on todisk-based and assembly language programs. Several key events occurred inthe early 1980's that had an impact on what was to come later.     In the area of sound, two significant things happened. First, MUSEreleased a program called "The Voice", which allowed the recording andplayback of sound on an Apple II. It was very low quality, since thespeaker on the Apple II could produce 1-bit sound (clicked "on" or "off"),but the results were intelligible. At about the same time, the company hadbeen able to improve the production of their software cassettes by makinguse of Flight 3, a professional recording studio. This studio had developedtechniques of enhancing the audio signal for MUSE's data cassettes byrunning it through a graphic equalizer. This improved the tapes so muchthat MUSE advertised them as "Super-Load" cassettes.     Hi-resolution graphics had been part of games produced by MUSEsoftware from the very beginning. One of their non-entertainment productswas a word processing program called "Super-Text", which as a text-basedprogram was limited to the 40-column resolution inherent to the Apple IIand II Plus. As a possible enhancement, Warner had designed a hi-rescharacter generator to allow 70 columns of upper and lowercase text to bedisplayed on the graphics screen. Unfortunately, the hi-res screen took up8K of RAM, nearly one fourth of the available RAM on a disk-based Apple II,and so this plan was abandoned.     Finally, MUSE had worked on some new techniques to access data on anApple DOS disk more rapidly than was typically possible.     In early 1981, at the time these technologies had been completed andwere available at MUSE, Silas Warner visited his local 7-Eleven oneevening. There, he saw for the first time a new Williams Electronics arcadegame, "Robotron: 2084". This color game had the player running around atwo-dimensional field, shooting in any of eight directions at robots thatwere threatening the world's last family of humans. As he looked at theRobotron game,     "...[I] realized that this would do really nicely if     I built it with the hi-res character generator. But     it was such a cliche' ... just robots and science-fiction     gadgetry and all the trappings of that era. The whole     concept of the game was just a big cliche'. And I     wondered, 'what else could you do with it?' And then     I saw 'The Guns Of Navarone' and realized what you     COULD do with it."     The 1961 World War II movie, "The Guns Of Navarone" involved the useskill and cunning for an elite force to break INTO a heavily guarded Nazifortress; Warner's game would require use of strategy to break OUT of aheavily guarded Nazi prison. The player could shoot (in eight differentdirections) at Nazi soldiers, or hold a gun on them and interrogate them,or even go though the pockets of a dead soldier to look for loot. It wasnot necessarily the point of the game to shoot at everything that moved tosuccessfully complete it.     Warner put everything into the game. The hi-res character generatorwas used to manipulate the graphics; the new disk routines helped speed updisk access; and "The Voice" was used to make guards that actually spoke to(or yelled at) the player when spotted. To create the voices used in thegame, he went to the same recording studio that recorded their "Super Load"cassettes, and spent a morning saying phrases like "Achtung!" into amicrophone. Six months later, MUSE released Castle Wolfenstein.     The resulting game was unique in several ways. Softalk magazine made abrief first comment on the game in the September 1981 issue: "CastleWolfenstein from Muse (Baltimore, MD) combines an arcade-type game with amore complex adventure/fantasy game. Scenario puts the player in the roleof an Allied soldier as World War II rages across Europe. Player iscaptured but must find the Nazi war plans and escape from the castle. Soundeffects include guns firing and Nazis shouting -- in German." Their latermore comprehensive review was enthusiastic about the game, and it soonappeared at the top of the Softalk Top 5 Strategy list at the end of eachissue, right ahead of Warner's other popular game, Robot War. Their briefdescription of the game when the top software of 1981 was listed mentionedthat it was the first game to successfully fuse strategy, home-arcade, andfantasy. That description also mentioned that the room layout would changewith each new game. It was simply a great game idea that had not yet beentried, and it resulted in a best seller that MUSE later translated toseveral other platforms, including the Atari 800, Commodore 64, and the IBMPC.     As with many hit games (or books or movies), Castle Wolfensteinspawned a sequel. In 1984, MUSE released "Beyond Castle Wolfenstein", whichWarner helped design but did not directly write. The premise of this gamewas not significantly different from the first, although this time the goalwas to infiltrate Hitler's headquarters, plant a bomb, and then escapebefore it went off. More strategy and stealth was needed than in the firstgame; it was necessary to collect security passes and bribe guards toprogress through the game. Doing TOO much shooting would draw attention andincrease the odds that you would be caught and arrested. It was alsopossible to search a guard at gunpoint, rather than killing him. (Strategyfeatures like this have unfortunately NOT survived to the present day.)FAST FORWARD     MUSE Software did not survive past 1987, mainly due to managementproblems that resulted in the loss of the company's marketing department.As time passed, players moved on from the two Wolfenstein games and on tothe next big thing. Nevertheless, a good concept is always ripe for anothersequel, and this did eventually come about. When it did appear, theprogrammers again demonstrated break-through concepts.     John Romero got his start writing Apple II software, which hesubmitted to Nibble, inCider, and A+ Magazine. He badly wanted to work witha company in the computer industry, and eventually managed to get jobsfirst at Origin (the company that produced the Ultima series of games),then Inside-Out Software, and eventually at Softdisk. Although he did havesome submissions of games for the Apple II edition of Softdisk, he told theowner that he wanted to learn how to program for the IBM PC (since theApple II platform was dying out), and so worked on their disk magazine,"Big Blue Disk", and later helped start another disk publication, the"Gamer's Edge".     Working with Romero at Softdisk was John Carmack, who had likewisepreviously written programs for the Apple II before starting at Softdisk.Both were focused primarily on game playing and design. However, the workthey did for Gamer's Edge eventually began to feel restrictive. They wantedto create games for the PC that were more complex, games that had bettergraphics and sound. Unfortunately, it was necessary in writing for Gamer'sEdge to program for the lowest common denominator computer that mostsubscribers owned, which precluded writing games that made use of thelatest video and sound cards and computer power. Doing work on their ownterms began to be an attractive option.     Apogee was a small shareware software company that created games moreadvanced than those Romero and Carmack could do at Softdisk. They used aunique concept in selling their games, one in which the game was written asthree large parts or chapters. The first part was completely unlocked, notcrippled in any way, and was freely available for download from thethousands of computer BBS systems across the country (and the world). Toplay the second and third parts and complete the game required payment of ashareware fee. This method made it possible for potential customers to geta good feel for the game play and to spur the desire to buy the rest of thegame and finish it. (Like a good multi-part story, the end of one part ofthe game often involved a crisis that required the playing the next part toresolve.) The success of this method resulted in good sales for Apogee andgood royalties for its programmers.      Romero and Carmack, under the name of "id Software" (a company thatdidn't yet officially exist), sold a successful shareware game in 1990through Apogee called "Commander Keen: Invasion Of The Vorticons". Startingin 1991, they made the company name official, and continued to write gamesthat they sold through Apogee using its shareware model. For a while, theyhad to continue to help with Softdisk, while new programmers came up tospeed on taking over the Gamer's Edge (which Romero and Carmack hadstarted). They created several side-scrolling games, including DangerousDave (first on the Apple II and then later a conversion to the PC) forSoftdisk, and the Commander Keen series for Apogee.     With the help of Tom Hall and Adrian Carmack (no relation), who alsohad worked at Softdisk, Romero and Carmack began to work on an entirely newconcept. They had previously done games that involved moving through a 3Denvironment (Hovertank and Catacombs 3D), but they wanted a more excitinggame, one that involved using the 3D environment to shoot at enemies.Viewing the screen would be like looking through the eyes of the player;turning to the left or the right, or moving forwards or backwards wouldcause things to move in perspective as it would in real life. Additionally,the ability to move would also allow aiming at an enemy. After tossingaround various ideas, they decided to reach back to their Apple II rootsand do Silas Warner's Castle Wolfenstein in 3D. They conceived a game thathad the same premise as the original game, escaping from a Nazi stronghold.During the game, it was necessary to collect weapons and kill bad guys(Nazis), while trying to stay alive by finding food and ammunition. Becausetheir new game added a weapon at the bottom of the screen pointing forwardwith the movements of the player, id created the genre of the "first personshooter". (They had also considered adding features from the originalCastle Wolfenstein, such as opening chests and capturing guards, buteliminated them as it slowed down the pace of the game.)     The programmers contacted Silas Warner, and he did give permission touse the Wolfenstein concept in a game. id Software was ready to release"Wolfenstein 3D" in 1992, after six months of game development (oddly, thesame time as it took Warner to create the original game). As with most oftheir other games, it was written to run under MS-DOS on Intel-based PCs.Following their desire to make games that pushed the frontiers ofcomputing, Wolfenstein 3D was more hardware intensive than previous gamesthey had written. For best game play it required a fairly fast PC andcapable video card; in fact, it is likely that games like Wolfenstein 3Dand its successor, DOOM, were responsible for motivating PC users toupgrade their machines in order to get best game play.     The game was a very popular download, and quite profitable for id; atone point, it was bringing in $120,000 a month in shareware fees.Additionally, people learned how to hack into the game and create their ownlevels that could be used with the original game "engine", extending thegame play further and enhancing its popularity. Building on the firstperson shooter concept, Romero and his partners pushed it further withtheir next hit game. In DOOM, it was possible for rooms be nearly any shape(Wolf 3D required all rooms to be composed of right angle corners) andallowing multiple floors in a single level (although it was not possible tocross underneath or over an area). DOOM II added new weapons and theability to play competitively or cooperatively with other players on anetwork. They then used their growing expertise to write a new, morepowerful 3D game engine for "Quake", which increased the complexity of thevirtual world and of the game play, as well as improving network play.RETURN TO THE APPLE II     As with the original Castle Wolfenstein, the popularity of Wolfenstein3D and its descendants from id Software resulted in requests forconversions to enable the games to play on other platforms. Even consolegame manufacturers were interested in having it ported to their machines.In January 1994, a company called Imagineer released (under license) aversion of the game for the Super Nintendo (SNES). However, Nintendoinsisted on removal of the Nazi references, blood (which was changed tosweat), and rabid dogs (changed to rats). The 16-bit graphics available onthe SNES also decreased the quality of the appearance of the game. InAugust, a version for the Atari Jaguar was released, in which the graphicswere much improved. By October 1994, MacPlay released a conversion for theMacintosh. As versions of the game appeared on these other platforms, andthe knowledge that the SNES ran on the same 65816 processor as did theApple IIGS, it was speculated that a IIGS port was entirely possible. Bymid-to-late 1994, rumors were surfacing that this was actually going tohappen. The production of this IIGS version of Wolfenstein 3D did not comeeasily, however.     Vitesse, an Apple II software company that had produced severalutilities for the Apple IIGS, had also begun to publish games. In August1994, Vitesse released "Ultima I GS", a conversion and enhancement of theolder Apple II DOS 3.3 classic. They had announced and promised two othergames, "Mind Shadow" and "Tracer Sanction" for the IIGS for 1995 (but neveractually released them). But the one game that they hoped would be a hugeseller for them was a IIGS port of Wolfenstein 3D. To bring this about,Vitesse contacted id Software and asked them for a license to do a port ofthe game.     This part of the story gets somewhat complicated. Interplay hadhandled some of the Wolf 3D conversions for id Software, and assigned"Burger" Bill Heineman to do the Super Nintendo version of the game.Heineman actually used an Apple IIGS to do his SNES development, and so wassimultaneously doing work that would allow a IIGS port to be done in thefuture. Unfortunately, he and Interplay disagreed with this parallel work,and he was dismissed from the company. Heineman and Steve Parsons thenfounded a new company, Logicware, to do similar work.     At this point, Heineman's Logicware, Vitesse, and id together agreedto allow Logicware to work on a IIGS port of Wolf 3D, which Vitesse wouldmarket. However, the agreement apparently did not involve a significantmonetary compensation for Logicware up front, and after he had completedabout ninety percent of the game conversion, other better paying projectsbegan to demand his attention.     By this time, a post made by Lowell Erbe of Vitesse in December 1994had generated considerable excitement. He stated that an Apple IIGSconversion of the hit Wolfenstein 3D was soon to be released. He stated,"We're just wrapping up Wolfenstein 3D and should begin shipping within thenext two weeks." (This confident statement was likely made based on aprogress report from Heineman.) A pre-release price of $39.95 was offeredif ordered before January 1, 1995, with a price increase to $49.95 afterthat date. Vitesse was also at that time struggling to get a IIGS faxprogram, Faxination, completed and shipped, but that had been fallingbehind schedule and did not appear until March 1995, and that as aless-than-full release version (v0.1.5).     Scott Everts worked at Interplay, and had previously done the artworkfor the Macintosh version of Wolf 3D. He was a big fan of the Apple IIGS,and really wanted the company to do a IIGS version of the game. AfterHeineman began the IIGS version, Everts worked during his Christmas holidayin 1994, downsampling the Mac version's artwork from 128x128 pixels to64x64 pixels and 16 colors for the IIGS. He made a number of posts on GEnieabout the coming game; he confirmed in January that Bill Heineman was theprogrammer doing the conversion, and that this port of Wolfenstein 3D wasbased on the Macintosh "Third Encounter" version of the game. Because thegame play and graphic manipulation was highly processor-intensive, anaccelerator was STRONGLY recommended. He also promised that the IIGSversion would be true to the original PC game, and would not be like theSuper Nintendo "sanitized" version that had been so disappointing to fansof the game. It was to be as much like the original as was technicallypossible.     The various previous translations of the game that had appeared hadnot necessarily included the same levels as were in the original PC game.The Super Nintendo and Jaguar versions came with thirty levels that wereMODIFICATIONS of levels in the original game. The Macintosh version of thegame used these thirty modified levels, plus the original sixty PC levels.In fact, the Macintosh release of Wolfenstein 3D came in three differentflavors: One with three levels (the shareware trial), one with thirtylevels, and one with all ninety levels. It was planned that the Apple IIGSconversion of the game would include ALL of these levels, the sixty levelsof the original PC game (divided into six missions of ten levels each), andthe thirty modified levels that appeared in the Super Nintendo, Jaguar, andMacintosh shareware versions.     Customization of the game was, as mentioned above, a popular featurefor PC gamers. These level files (which contained the maps, items, andartwork for a series of levels) would have a quite different format on theIIGS than it had on the PC, and so it was not possible to play existingcustomized PC Wolf levels. However, Everts said that Heineman was includingin the IIGS version the ability to load new levels, if a programmer createdthem (although a level editor was not planned for the final release).     Soon after Everts made his post, Lowell Erbe of Vitesse again posted apromise that the game release was imminent: "We're working out some finaldetails and a few bugs." He could not promise a specific date it would beavailable, but hoped to begin shipment of it by February 1995.DELAYS, DELAYS     In February, posts began to appear indicating that there were problemswith the conversion process. It appeared that the sixty additional levelswere causing problems. There was also mention of a dispute of some sortregarding that contract for the game, a dispute that was contributing tothe delay. This problem was still ongoing in April. Heineman himself posteda message on GEnie in May to explain part of what was going on. He saidthat there was a disagreement between he and his former employer, problemsthat required involvement of lawyers and the need for him to at leasttemporarily stop working on Wolf 3D (it was indirectly involved in thislegal matter).     No further posts about this appeared on GEnie until August; Vitessethen claimed that they were still waiting for Heineman to fix bugs, andthis was holding up the game release. By September, Everts again cameonline stating that he had heard that if Heineman didn't get the gamecompleted by the end of the month, Vitesse planned to cancel the projectand refund those who had pre-paid for it. He also expressed frustrationabout having done work on the art of the game, and then to learn that itwould not be shipped. A later post by Everts in November reiterated thatstatement that Vitesse was NOT to blame for the cancellation of theproject, and "they have been doing everything possible to get Bill tofinish it."     Then in December 1995 it was announced that Vitesse was contactingcustomers who had earlier paid in advance for Wolfenstein 3D for the IIGS,asking if they were still interested in the game. A representative of thecompany had gone to far as to (again) predict a release date (unofficial),this time for late January 1996. However, after two days of making thesephone calls, Vitesse had to stop the process and rescind the predictedJanuary date. The reason given was that a different programmer had beencontacted to complete Wolf 3D, and that id Software now insisted on a newcontract.SHEPPY TAKES OVER     Eric Shepherd had a reputation as a talented programmer for the AppleIIGS, and had released a number of utilities, under his shareware name"SheppyWare" as well as with Softdisk G-S. He began to work with Logicwarein September of 1995, when rumors were still flying about whether or notthe IIGS conversion of Wolfenstein would ever be completed. At this timeHeineman had his hands full of projects that Logicware had been contractedto do, beside the IIGS Wolf 3D project. He was completing work ontranslation of Wolf 3D for the 3DO game console, and then had to move onimmediately to create a version of DOOM II, also for the 3DO.     Vitesse's contract with id Software had expired by this time.Logicware managed to get a new contract with id, but the new contract didnot allow them to sell the game, but rather stated that Logicware had tomake it available as freeware. The reason for this odd change was likelywhat happened in August, 1995. At that time, id Software uploaded toCompuServe the source code for Wolfenstein 3D (not including the graphicsor the code for the levels). It would not have then been appropriate toallow Logicware to make the game for sale.     Sheppy volunteered to take over the project near the end of 1995. Whathad already been completed was getting the 3D game engine functional, andit was thought that all that was necessary to complete it was to make thegame save function and the sound work. Since the game could not be sold andwould therefore not generate any revenue, it was moved to a low prioritylevel, and was worked on amidst as many as four other paying projects.     At the time Shepherd took on the Wolfenstein 3D project, he stated onGEnie, "Keep in mind that the last 10% of a program requires 90% of thework. Although Wolf 3D for the IIGS is nearly finished, the part that'sleft to do is the hardest part -- making sure it works flawlessly and asfast as possible.  That's my job here." He also asked to NOT be contactedwith e-mails asking about the game or about progress on it, as respondingto them would take away from time he could be working on programming.     Much of Sheppy's development work was done on a Macintosh running anApple IIGS emulator, first Gus and later Bernie ][ The Rescue. The primaryreason for doing the work had to do with the time needed to compile thesource code. On a 10 MHz accelerated IIGS, Wolf 3D took over 90 minutes tocompile; when running on the Gus emulator on a 120 MHz PowerPC 604 Mac, itwould compile in only 15 to 20 minutes. From the start of the 1996 untilspring, he worked (intermittently) on the sound and music drivers, fixedcosmetic bugs and speed problems, and optimized the code. In June hestarted adding the music to the game, and began to quietly seed betaversions of the game to select testers.FINE TUNING     The music presented a particular problem in making this conversion.The first music that they worked with was that used in the Macintoshversion of the game, translated into synthLAB format for the IIGS. However,Interplay (not id Software) held the copyrights for this particular music;and since Logicware did not have a license from Interplay for the music, itcould not be used. A further problem was that the music slowed down thegame play too much. As a result, Sheppy removed the music that playedduring the game, and then accepted an offer by Tony Gonzales to have newmusic created for the game introduction. (Gonzales had done music for othergames Heineman had written).     At this point the game was sufficiently functional to allow ademonstration to be given at KansasFest 1996. It was announced at thatconference that open beta testing would begin on Genie "in a few weeks",and that the final version of Wolf 3D would be released as freeware, whichhad not previously been publicly announced.     Beta testing of Wolfenstein 3D for the IIGS was announced duringSeptember 1996. An FAQ posted on the Logicware web site at that time statedthat a pause mode had been added, the sound effect player was beingreplaced by a more efficient one, music had been added, and new art workhad been added. Sheppy even went so far as to predict that it would beready for release by Christmas 1996. This testing progressed to the pointthat a more general beta release was announced for November.     By this time, however, Sheppy had realized that not only the music butalso the sound effects they were using in the game were owned by Interplay.These also could not be used. Furthermore, when he examined the sounds usedin the original PC version, he did not feel that their quality was verygood. Therefore, the sounds were completely removed from the demo before itwas released.     The general beta was released on November 17, 1996. This beta/demoversion included the first three levels of the game, did not include theability to save a game in progress, and of course did not have any soundeffects. As on the PC version, the game pushed the computer to its limits,and required an Apple IIGS with a hard drive having at least 2 MB of freespace, 4 MB of available RAM, as well as the strong recommendation for anaccelerator.     The December 1996 issue of GenieLamp A2 included a review by editorDoug Cuff of this beta version of the game. He awarded the game "fivelamps", the highest rating a reviewed product could be given. He pointedout that without an accelerator, significant slowdowns would occur; thiswas especially noticeable especially during combat, when shooting would bedelayed.     To solve the problem with the sounds, Sheppy accessed the Logicwarestock sound library, found some appropriate for the game, and installedthem. With that problem taken care of, it would seem that not much was leftto complete the game. But then more contributions appeared from a Europeansource.NINJAFORCE     When the first screen shots of Wolf 3D for the IIGS appeared on theInternet during 1996, members of a German Apple IIGS programming groupnamed Ninjaforce saw how the artwork had changed from the 256 colororiginals in the PC version of the game, to the 16 color versions thatcould be used on the IIGS. One of the Ninjaforce team, known as Clue, feltthat he could do better, and so contacted Bill Heineman to ask if he couldwork on that part of the project, work that he would do for free. By thetime he got an initial approval from Heineman, Sheppy had taken over, andClue had to repeat the process with him. This would be a problem becausethe original artist, Scott Everts, would likely not be happy about havinghis work replaced. Additionally, Sheppy knew that it would be a lot of workto make the changes.     Initially, Clue sent Sheppy new artwork for the menus in the game. Thequality of the work impressed him. Clue then asked permission to re-do thatartwork throughout the game. He sent some samples to try, and althoughSheppy was not enthusiastic about it initially, he found the improvement inthe appearance of the game to be amazing. After the decision was made tomake these changes, the promised release in December 1996 had to bedelayed.     For a game that was to be available in December, every month of delayseemed interminable. Clue would respond to Sheppy's pleas for final artworkthat, "It's not perfect yet!" Part of this delay had to do with the processof needing to pixel-edit nearly every graphic in the game, after making aconversion from the original PC art. Finally, by the spring of 1997, thislarge task was complete.     Another part of the game that Ninjaforce impacted was the spokenvoices and some of the sound effects in the game. Since the Ninjaforceprogrammers were from Germany, they were eminently suited to speak theGerman phrases that appeared in the game. In fact, some of the phrases inthe original PC version of the game didn't even make sense. In one place, aguard shouts, "Haben Sie Fhrerschein?" which means "Do you have drivinglicense?" One of Ninjaforce's members, Dreamer, asked his grandfather tospeak the phrases that were wanted for the game. These were recorded inApril 1997, and appeared in the final version. As a result, the IIGSversion of Wolf 3D is the only version in which AUTHENTIC German voices andpronunciations were used in the game.MORE DELAYS     So the new artwork was done, the sounds were fixed; why didn't thesummer of 1997 see the release of Wolf 3D? According to Sheppy, he andLogicware had "an artistic dispute on another project", and he was firedfrom the company. For several months, he did not do any work on Wolfenstein3D. By fall of 1997 he arranged with Heineman to resume work on it. At thispoint, Sheppy had moved several hundred miles away, and was working for Be,Inc.     As he resumed work on it, the major concern was performance. In anonline chat on Delphi, programmer Nathan Mates suggested a differenttechnique of graphic rendering; when Sheppy tried it, the speed increasewas dramatic. He also implemented additional features, such as thepreferences screen, and the Open-Apple-number key combinations to changethe screen size (helpful for those with slower processors that needed asmaller screen to update).     Further mention of the game in The Lamp! did not appear until January1998, when the final, true release date was announced: Valentine's Day,February 14, 1998. Then even at this late date, the game almost didn't makeit out the door. At 2:30 pm on February 13th, beta tester Tony Diaz found amajor bug that would cause the game to crash. Sheppy worked throughout therest of the day to find and fix the bug. He sent a release build of thegame to his testers at 10:00 pm, asking them about whether it should orshould not be released. He finally got approval from them all, got thefinal release packaged up, and uploaded it at 11:58 pm on February 13.THE FINAL PRODUCT     The result of all of the work and the delays was a much better gamethan would have appeared if it had followed the original timeline thatVitesse had wanted back in 1994 and 1995. Rather than simply being done tomake a profit, Sheppy and his team of beta testers worked on it as a laborof love, trying to create the very best game they could.     Earlier concerns about the game not working with an AppleDesignkeyboard on a IIGS turned out to be incorrect. The game had been so greatlyanticipated that even the Apple IIGS emulator Bernie ][ The Rescue wasmodified in such a way as to make it possible to play the game. Sheppysweetened the deal further by releasing a Wolfenstein 3D ScenarioConverter, making it possible to play custom levels that had been designedfor the Macintosh version of the game.     A feature that didn't appear in the original documentation file forthe game was the ability to capture a screen shot of the current gamescreen and save it in the Wolfenstein 3D game directory.     The original game by id Software included some special codes("cheats") that made it possible to get help if you were in trouble. Thisattribute was carried through even into the translations that were done forthe Super Nintendo, 3D0, and Jaguar, and of course for the Apple IIGSversion. These codes included some "Easter eggs" as well:SARAH          Get 100 health backIDDQD          Toggle "god" mode on and offBURGER         Set max ammo to 999 instead of 99, and gives 999 ammoWOWZERS        Get all weapons and max ammoLEDOUX         Get both keys and god modeSEGER          Gives you both keysMCCALL         Immediately jump to next levelAPPLEIIGS      Make secret doors visible on automap (shows player's head)SHEPPY         Get an extra lifeGETAJOB        Replaces certain Hitler portraits with Steve JobsBARBARIAN      Replaces certain Hitler portraits with Bill GatesHARDWIRED      Replaces certain walls with Tony DiazLIBRARIAN      Replaces certain walls with Tony WardMEIJERDUDE     Replaces certain walls with Dave MillerDONHO          Replaces certain walls with Ryan Suenaga(By the way, the appearance of the player in "god" mode is more cool on theIIGS than on the other platforms. On the IIGS he is wearing sunglasses; onother platforms, he has shining red eyes.)SQUASHING BUGS     A maintenance update to version 1.0.1 appeared shortly after Wolf 3D'soriginal release. In March 1998 a patch program was available to download,which fixed a crash occurring in certain low memory situations, andchanging the startup music to continue playing while a scenario was beingselected.In April, Wolfenstein 3D players began to mention that their systems werebecoming unstable after playing Wolfenstein 3D.  Sheppy eventually trackeddown the problem to a bug in the system software that is triggered onlywhen applications attempt to patch the system software following the rulesdocumented in Apple's Technical Notes.  Wolfenstein 3D uses a Toolbox patchto work around another system software bug.  Sheppy fixed this problem bychanging his code to not follow Apple's own rules, but use a differentpatching method that is more transparent to the operating system. Theversion 1.1 update that fixed this was released on May 1, 1998, andincluded a completely rewritten sound code section (which allowed moresounds to be played at once), increased keyboard configuration options.AFTERMATH     To say that Wolfenstein 3D for the Apple IIGS was "popular" would bean understatement. It even became an event at KansasFest 1998, with a"KFest Shootout" planned as a contest. In January 1999, Ryan Suenaga listedit as one of the two best freeware products of 1998, tying with KelvinSherlock's "GShisen".     The Wolfenstein 3D Scenario Converter, a casualty of falling sharewarepayments in the Apple IIGS community, was changed from a $5 fee to freewarein September 1999.     It is safe to say that the game as it was finally released was a farbetter conversion than would have appeared if it had stayed the commercialproduct that Vitesse had originally wanted it to be. Certainly, BillHeineman is an excellent programmer, and would have come up with a greatgame if he had been able to apply the time to it. However, when Sheppy tookover the project and continued to plug away at it even after there was nolonger any chance of financial compensation for all of his work, it becamea matter of making it PERFECT. Wolfenstein 3D on the IIGS is one of themost complex and demanding games that ever appeared for that computer, anda credit to the dedication to the platform demonstrated by Sheppy and hiscontributors.THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE IT     Next month we will return to the Lamp yearly review, as I have nofurther side stories that are just itchin' to be told. Until then, pull outyour copy of Wolf 3D and blast some bad guys!References:-----. "A Funny Thing Happened...." The Lamp!: Feb through Dec 1998.Beerman, Marcel 'Doc'.
