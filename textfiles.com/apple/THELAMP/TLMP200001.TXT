The timehas come for a new editor of _The Lamp!_.  Ryan has done a great job aseditor... It will be a challenge to follow in his footsteps.     One of the changes in my life this past year was retirement as ofJuly 1.  This freed up some time for new activities.  Serving as editor ofthis publication is one of those new ventures.     I went online with GEnie just before Talk is Cheap v4 was published.Much of what I know about the Apple II's was learned there.  I left whenthe price went through the roof and it became Genie.  I then joinedCompuserve and stayed until the forums no longer had text access.I joined Delphi soon after the new A2 area was formed.     I have a IIgs with a Focus 80 HD, ZipGS 9/64, 3 floppy drives, a 33.6modem, a DeskJet 420 printer, and an Imagewritter II printer.  I also haveanother working IIgs in the closet to serve as spare parts.                                [*] [*] [*]     Changes... 'Its Never Too Late to Learn'.  Let me share true storiesabout two of my neighbors.  Their names have been changed to protect theiridentity.     Tom bought himself a present for his 85th birthday... his firstcomputer!  Paid $900 for it.  He soon offered to sell it for $600.  Whenasked why he wanted to sell he said he could not figure out how to use it.What fun it was spending an evening with him showing him the basics.  He isnow wandering all over the WWW and exchanging email with his children.     Then there is Lucy.  She is 79 and indicated that she is interested inhaving a computer.  But she has very little extra money.  Perhaps we mightbe able to find an Apple II for her.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][OPN]------------------------------     A FUNNY THING HAPPENED. . . . |-----------------------------------Checking out A2 on Delphi"""""""""""""""""""""""""by Lyle Syverson  [lyle837@delphi.com][RST]RESTORING FROM PROSEL 8 TO A DIFFERENT SIZE DRIVE    Hello all!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I really need help. Someone reading this forum has the answer to myproblem. I know I'm not the only person ever to have a hard drive fail, soplease help me.I have an Apple //gs system with 120Meg HD and I have been using ProSel-8BACKUP to back up the HD to 800k floppies.A while ago, I had to send the HD in for repair. The shop replaced themechanism with a new one. Now, the ProSel-8 RESTORE program refuses torestore my HD from backup. It gives an error something like "Wrong VolumeSize".I had the original HD divided into 4 partitions, with 3 being equal sizedand one odd sized part to make up the fractional remainder of the physicalHD size.I conclude that the new HD mechanism is actually a couple MBytes (orfraction thereof) larger than the original mechanism. The solution shouldbe to make four partitions on the new HD exactly the same size as thepartitions from which the backup was made. Unfortunately, I have no way ofknowing the actual size (in K) of the partitions of my original HD.It seems that BACKUP must store VOLUME SIZE of the original volumesomewhere on the first disk of the backup set, for purposes of making thecomparison. I could use a block editor to read the original VOLUME SIZEfrom this disk, if only I knew where it was stored.I desperately need to get my Apple //gs back up and running. I think I'lldie if I loose all that data!I'll be checking back to this message area for responses periodically, butyou can reach me faster by email (address in signature)*** PLEASE HELP! ***+---------------------------------------------------+!

I suggest you call Glen Bredon, the programmer, and plead yourcase. Remember that he is a retired Math Professor and now lives in theCentral California Mountains and may be a little hard to reach.His phone number is 209-877-2993After you get back up and running, I suggest you upgrade to the IIgsversion of ProSel, ProSel-16, which has a better BACKUP and RESTOREprogram. Its in the Public Domain, but we both provide disks and manualsfor a small fee. Since you will be on his time, if you think this is a goodsuggestion, ask Glen for copies. We both provide the manual for $10 andpostage; a disk with the ProSel-16 on it is $10 from me, but I don't knowwhat he will ask. Its cheap at half the price because ProSel-16 was a $90utility set in its heyday.Good Luck; I know Glen can help. Now, to go read the other responses.Chuck NewbyCharlie's AppleSeeds(APPLESEEDS, 27672, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I already answered this by email about a week ago. The volume size"""""   of the existing volume is on block 2 at byte $29,2a. The volumesize when backed up is on the first backup disk on block 1 byte $40,41. Youmust take the latter and change the present size (block 2 byte $29,2a) tothe old size (but if the sizes are very different you may have torepartition to get them close or there could be problems). At this pointthe restore should be accepted, after which you should change the volumesize back to its former value (the value found after the HD was fixed).Then you should run Mr. Fixit on the volume to clean up a couple ofdetails. If this is too hard or confusing, you can call me and I will stepyou through it (559) 877-2993 (please no other calls).Incidently the backup in ProSel-16 does not have this problem, it cares notwhat the volume size is, only the old ProSel-8 backup is finicky this waybecause it is an image backup.(27674, BREDON, GO COM A2)[EOA][HCP]HANDYMAN'S CHIP PULLER      Since Duct tape doesn't work here, I use the""""""""""""""""""""""      Other handyman's friend, a paper clip.Straighten a sturdy one and bend it in the middle in a curve that leavesthe ends parallel and even, and a bit farther apart than the diagonal widthof the chip. Then bend the ends (just a millimeter because more won't fit)towards each other. Make sure the bends are at least 90 degrees, (a bitmore is desirable) and insert in the corners of the socket that have roomfor them. Press the sides of your puller together just enough to put yourhooks under the chip, and pull. Have someone watch where the chip goes, soyou can recover it. Or design something to catch it before it gets away,possibly using duct tape. Carl Knoblock - Telephone Tech - Sun 19 Dec 99 8:37:41 pm cknoblo@novia.net - Via Spectrum v2.2 & Crock O' Gold v3.2 Y][Kfest, July 26-30, 2000 - 220 days till Y][Kfest Using Marinetti 2.0.1 - Thank you, Richard.(CKNOBLO, 27885, GO COM A2)[EOA][PST]CHRISTMAS PRESENT      Just uploaded 4 virtual disk images to the Bernie ]["""""""""""""""""      the Rescue Web site (will take some time to appear).They are:1.

If you're already aregistered Sweet16 user, this is a free update.Before we get to the list of new features and bug fixes, here are thedownload links:PowerPC version: <ftp://ftp.sheppyware.net/pub/beos/Sweet16_ppc_1.3.zip>Intel version: <ftp://ftp.sheppyware.net/pub/beos/Sweet16_x86_1.3.zip>These require BeOS Release 4.5.2.OK, here are the interesting new features:o Added support for emulating the modem and printer ports using anyBeOS-supported serial hardware. In addition, you can configure Sweet16 toemulate serial connections using a TCP/IP network connection. This lets youtelnet to remote sites. Please read the documentation carefully, this is anexperimental feature and is a little tricky. No, this doesn't mean you cando Marinetti over Ethernet.o Added a new option to the Disks preference panel: "Really Eject PhysicalDisks". If this is enabled, ejecting a physical disk will cause the disk toactually eject, if it's a removable disk. This works for floppies on PowerMac systems, and for CD-ROMs on most systems.o Completely replaced the Mount Physical Disk window to be more friendlyand informational. Disks are listed by device name, file system, and volumename. Sweet16 identifies ProDOS drives or partitions and lists them assuch. You can also mount multiple disks at once, instead of just one at atime.o Added the ability to mount any partition from a multi-partition ormulti-session disk (including hard disks, Zip disks, and CD-ROMs). The onlyrestrictions are that partitions must be 4 GB or less, and that the diskwas formatted in either standard Intel format or in standard Apple format.Drives partitioned using a RamFAST card will not work; however, drivespartitioned using an Apple High-Speed SCSI card will.o Added the Video preference panel; currently, the only option is to syncto the monitor's real VBL signal in full-screen mode. This can make somegames run better; however, currently Sweet16 assumes that your monitordefaults to 60 Hz in full-screen mode (which is almost always true underBeOS).o Rewrote the video recording code to be more efficient. It's still veryslow, but it's getting better. It can use a lot of memory now though.o Added the Enhanced Stereo option; this provides better sound quality whenusing headphones.o Added options to the Joystick panel to let you reverse the X and/or Yaxes of the stick, in case you have a funny joystick.o The disk activity light now flashes red for writing, green for reading,in the Mounted Disks window.o Revamped user interface for creating new disk images.o BeOS MIME types are now added to disk images, and images are primarilyidentified by type; you no longer need to add extensions to filenames tolet Sweet16 know the file's type.o Added a 1.44 MB floppy disk image size to the Create Disk Image sizelist.o Added a Recent Disks submenu to the File menu, listing the 10most-recently used disk images. Selecting one will attempt to mount it.o Added the "Save Disk Batchfile" option to the Mounted Disks window'scontextual menu. This lets you save the currently- mounted disks into abatch file; you can then mount the same group of disks later by simplyopening the batch file. You can, optionally, attach your currentpreferences to the batch file -- if you do, your preferences will bechanged to match when you open the batch file.o Added the Switch ROM submenu; you can now switch between ROM 01 and ROM 3(if you have them both installed). Separate BRAM files are kept for eachROM version.o Added the ability to recognize disk image files on HFS disks using theMac OS file type information.o Added the new Eject All Disks option.o Added the Automatically Pause When Minimized option to me CPU preferencepanel. Due to a BeOS bug, however, the emulator doesn't automaticallyresume when no longer minimized.o All-new About box, including buttons to visit the Sweet16 web site,register Sweet16, and email for technical support.o Added the View Documentation option to the Help menu; this pulls up thedocumentation from your local Sweet16 directory.o Added the new "Show Speed" option to the Setup menu. This toggles on andoff the IIgs system speed display in the menu bar.o Minor optimizations to memory allocation and mapping.o New icon, featuring our beloved mascot, Ernie the parrot.And the fixed bugs:o Fixed a bug that caused the text screen border area not to erase whenswitching from SHR to text mode while in full-screen mode.o Fixed a bug that let you mount one too many SmartPort devices, therebycorrupting the device list.o Fixed a bug in the Mounted Disks window that caused items to get choppedoff at the bottom as you mounted more and more disks.o Cleaned up some thread synchronization issues to improve stability.o Fixed a bug that was making the preferences window behave oddly.o Fixed a bug that caused the CPU to hang if, on Intel systems, the CPUcycle counter wound up at exactly $FFFFFFFF cycles afterprocessing aninstruction.o Fixed a bug in computing the size of hard drive, raw, and DiskCopy 6image files.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 27832, GO COM A2)[EOA][BLE]BIRD LAYS ANOTHER EGG!

The mouse now works correctly in full-screen mode; no more getting lostat the edges of the screen. In addition, the mouse position is rememberedwhen you switch from full-screen to windowed mode and back.2. The disk status lights work more reliably.3. The control key is now used for mounting disks read-only, instead of theother way around.4. SCSI disks are no longer ejectable while in use by Sweet16.5. Fixed a bug that caused certain IIgs software (such as Arkanoid) tomercilessly crash Sweet16 under certain circumstances.6. Pausing Sweet16 actually now pauses the sound subsystem too.7. Fixed a bug that caused Sweet16 to crash if the 1-bit sound softswitchwas accessed twice in one CPU cycle.8. Minor improvements to performance in full-screen mode.9. The mouse is much more respononsive.10. Speed control now functions on PowerPC systems.11. Fixed a bug in low-resolution graphics mode.12. Rearranged the File menu; it was a mess.13. Mounting 140KB floppy disk images in DiskCopy 6 or raw format nowactually tells you that they're 140KB floppies instead of 800KB 3.5" disks.There is exactly one new feature in this version: if you want to mount lotsof 800 KB disk images, you can force them to mount on the SmartPort insteadof as IWM disks by holding down the option key while mounting them.Happy emulating!Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 28681, GO COM A2)[EOA][JCD]JUICED.GS JANUARY 2000 EDITION             Announcing ...""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""===== Juiced.GS, Volume 4, Issue 4 =====The January 2000 edition of Juiced.GS, the Apple II world's premierIIGS-specific magazine, was delivered to 232 subscribers in 44 states andnumerous points around the globe.Here's what you'll find in this issue:============FEATURESCover Story: AppleWorks, then and now -- A nostaligic review of the life ofa 'killer app' ...

It has beenpraised in the online newsletter The Lamp as well as in print in Juiced.GS.You can obtain a copy of this US $5.00 shareware utility at<http://www.sheppyware.net/products/a2/imagemaker/>. If you've already paidthe registration fee, this is a free upgrade. If you haven't registered theproduct, but would like to, you can do so online at<http://order.kagi.com/?QGC>.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 28287, GO COM A2)[EOA][BER]BERNIE 2.6 NOW AVAILABLE""""""""""""""""""""""""contact:F.E.Systems Emulation Technologies {<mailto:mailto:emutech@magnet.ch> mailto:emutech@magnet.ch} {<http://www.magnet.ch/emutech> http://www.magnet.ch/emutech} Apple IIGS Emulator Update Refines IntegrationBasel/Zug -- 1/13/00 -- F.E.Systems, maker of the leading Apple IIemulator, announced today the immediate availability of version 2.6 of itspowerful emulator Bernie ][ The Rescue.Bernie 2.6 adds CataDog(tm), a Finder-like disk cataloging feature forbrowsing ProDOS disks effortlessly and independently of the emulatedsoftware. Plus, browse disks by file type with CataDog's straightforwardfiltering option - catalogs have finally become a matter of just a fewmouse clicks.The Bernie update also improves on the previous version's Total Integrationfeature. Now firmly integrated into the Bernie user interface, the updateintroduces cross-platform aliases for creating Apple IIgs aliases in theMacintosh environment. Double-click an alias that takes you from zero toyour favorite GS/OS application within seconds!Version 2.6 also sports numerous changes in core routines for even bettercompatibility.Bernie ][ The Rescue is shareware. Licenses are priced at US$35 and can beobtained through Kagi Shareware (https://order.kagi.com/?XF). The update isfree to registered users of Bernie 2.0 or later. Low-priced upgrades forowners of earlier versions and educational licenses are available.Bernie ][ The Rescue is F.E.Systems' industrial-strength emulationsoftware.  Introduced in late 1996, Bernie has quickly become the AppleIIgs emulator of choice and is put to use in business and at home alike.Henrik Woof Gudatwoof woof(GUDATH, 28698, GO COM A2)[EOA][CHC]BERNIE ][ THE RESCUE... NOW A CHOICE OF DOWNLOADS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Dear Bernie user,We have just uploaded a "new" version of Bernie, version 2.5.9.We have gotten a couple of messages from our valued users that Bernie 2.6would not run with older system software. Version 2.6 is only compatiblewith MacOS 8.5 or later and does not work with any earlier release. We havetherefore worked intensively on an alternate release, Bernie 2.5.9, that isoffering backward compatibility down to System 7.6.1.Both versions have identical functionality. The only differences are veryminor cosmetic changes in CataDog and the lack of proportional scrollbars.Depending on your MacOS, please pick one of the below:MacOS 8.5 and later: use Bernie 2.6MacOS 8.1: download 2.5.9MacOS 8.0: download 2.5.9 and install Appearance ManagerSystem 7.6.1: download 2.5.9 and install Appearance ManagerThe download page has a link to the Appearance Manager package.We came to the conclusion that it would be best to drop compatibility witholder system software because this causes a lot of redundant code anddifficult testing. We would like to keep Bernie's code base as lean aspossible and are constantly rewriting core routines to optimize processesor integrate new MacOS technologies. It is our intention to offer you amodern product with an excellent user experience. We therefore felt anecessity to adapt Bernie to the new Appearance graphical user interface.Unfortunately, Apple got stuck with its Appearance support for older systemversions at some point which forced us to make a cut between MacOS 8.1 and8.5.  While Bernie 2.5.9 will address the compatibility issues, it is verylikely that this will be the last version supporting pre-MacOS 8.5 systems.We would also like to remind you that we are unable to support issues withsystems not supported by the official Bernie 2.6.We would like to thank Don Zahniser, Benoit Martin and Michael Hackett fortheir feedback and testing Bernie 2.5.9!Henrik Woof Gudatwoof woof(GUDATH, 28778, GO COM A2)[EOA][GVO]GREAT VACATION OPPORTUNITY... meet old friends... meet new A2 friends...""""""""""""""""""""""""" ______      _____(      )   (      )     ____________________________________________ |     |  /     /      (        ____________________________2000____) |     | /     /        |      | |     |/     /         |      |                         II Infinitum!! |           /          |      |______ |     |\     \         |      _______) __________    ________   ________ |     | \     \        |      |       (     _____)  (     ___) (__    __) |     |  \     \       |      |        |   |__       \    \       |   | |     |   \     \      |      |        |    __)       \    \      |   | |     |    \      \    |      |        |   |_____   ___\    \     |   |(______)    (________) (_______)       (__________) (_________)    |___|Help usher in the 21st century with the Apple II!! When: July 26-30, 2000 Where: Avila College, Kansas City, Missouri+++The most important Apple II event of the year, Y ][ KFest (KFest 2000), ison our calendar again, and it's never too early to make sure it has a placeon your calendar, too.Better yet, KFest is back with the same great prices as last year!Check out these rates, which include room and meals from Wednesday evening(dinner) on July 26, through Sunday morning (breakfast) on July 30.(Saturday evening dinner not included.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                [thelamp@sheppyware.net]                     MAY I HAVE THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE?                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      The year 1999 was both great and turbulent for the Apple II, as we sawmore great things for the Apple II along with some signs that the end maybe approaching.  But to celebrate all that was right about the II in 1999,the gang here at _The Lamp!_ consulted with some of our buddies in theApple II world and came up with our second annual list of the best of thebest--we highlight the best Apple II achievements of 1999.     Keep in mind that the ultimate decision on whom each award went to wasmade strictly by the staff here at _The Lamp!_, namely, me, your publisher.Any comments can be directed to thelamp@sheppyware.net.     BEST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT:   We have a repeat winner.  Still champion     """"""""""""""""""""""""   of the high-level language programmingworld, _GSoft BASIC 1.2_ from Byte Works gives the power of the Apple IIgsdesktop to the masses.  The other product given serious consideration was_Spectrum Internet Suite 1.1_, from noted Apple IIgs programmer Geoff Weissand MyEsource.     BEST SHAREWARE PRODUCT:   We look toward the future and toward the     """""""""""""""""""""""   past with this award.  We have a tie.  JeffFink's _Silvern Castle_ showed the world what Applesoft on the 8-bit AppleII can still do in this _Wizardry_-like adventure game.  On the other sideof the rainbow, noted Apple IIgs programmer Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd's_ImageMaker_ is a simple utility to make disk images out of Apple II disks.It's made transferring your existing hard drives over to emulators so easythat there's really no excuse now.     BEST FREEWARE PRODUCT:   While the pickings were slim for new     """"""""""""""""""""""   freeware this year, there was certainly ahuge amount of oldies made goodies again by reclassifying them as freeware.A slew of titles from _Kitchen Sink Software_ and _QLabs_ top the list.While there are many possibilities, _Modem MGR_, a ProDOS 8 basedtelecommunications program is the winner here, because finally there is aviable free alternative in Apple II communications software.     BEST WORLD WIDE WEB SITE:   Again, we have a tie.  Tony Diaz's     """""""""""""""""""""""""   http://www.apple2.org, the Apple IIInformation Resource, repeats this year, albeit tied with last year'srunner up,  David Kerwood's A2-Web at http://www.syndicomm.com/a2web.A2-Web has all the Apple II links you can hope for; apple2.org offers theGeek more technical information than you can shake a stick at, and photosof rare or non-existent Apple II products.     BEST PUBLICATION:   The adventure continues.  Indiana's Jones, also     """""""""""""""""   known as Max to his friends, entered a desktoppublishing contest sponsored by _Shareware Solutions II_ with a prototypenewsletter developed using _Appleworks GS_ called "Juiced.GS".  Half adecade later, _Juiced.GS_ is world famous for its beautiful layout, timelyproduction, and varied content.  Honorable mention to the Dean of Apple IIpublications, Joe Kohn's _Shareware Solutions II_.     OUTSTANDING APPLE II RELATED DEVELOPMENT:   Last year's runner up is     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   this year's winner.  Theefforts of Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd and  the gang at F.E. Systems are pavingthe way for the future of the Apple II.  _Bernie ][ The Rescue_ continuesto set the pace of Apple II emulation, and _Sweet16_ for BeOS gives evenPentium users an opportunity to emulate the best.  Emulated Apple IIs arekeeping development alive with their speedy compile times.     OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT:   Not everyone has the time or     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   inclination to program the AppleII.  Those of us who don't need to make our contributions in other ways.Howard Katz wrote articles back in the days of the National Appleworks UserGroup's _Appleworks Forum_, and followed that up by co-publishing _TheAppleworks Gazette_.  Currently, he spends his Apple II time contributingon Delphi's A2 Forum and tracking down software authors in the hopes ofgetting them to reclassify their no longer available software titles.  Thisyear alone a stash of _QLabs_ and _Kitchen Sink_ titles along with _ModemMGR_ and _Deja ][_.  Howard's work has been tireless and invaluable, not tomention remarkable.     Congratulations to all our winners!  Here's hoping that 2000--andY][KFEst--brings out the best in all of us again.[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
