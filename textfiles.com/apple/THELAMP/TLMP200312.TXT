This snow, the construction material for snowmen and otherstructures, would remain sticky for only a short time.  Recess and part ofthe dinner hour would provide blocks of time when this special snow couldbe used.  (Yes, the noon meal was called dinner).     The children had conspired for some time to come up with a plan tobuild a special snowman... " The Big One".  Broom handles, sticks, andlumps of coal had been set aside for use in adding arms, eyes, nose, mouth,buttons, and other features to this special man.     Then one morning the sky opened up and a thick blanket of sticky snowaccumulated on the ground.  Those dinners were almost swallowed whole asthe students rushed to face the challenge.  Teams went to work rollingballs of snow of various sizes.  One team built a ramp of snow... to beused to roll the second ball of snow into place and to serve as a platformfor lifting others into place.     Everyone was so engrossed with the construction process that theydidn't realize until they were called back to class that the play time hadbeen extended by almost an hour... the teacher noticed that a specialactivity was in progress... and called them in when "The Big One" wascomplete!                         Fulfilling the Challenge                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The children had given themselves a challenge... and succeeded infulfilling the challenge.     Over the years many people challenged themselves to be creative inextending the usefulness of the Apple II computers by creating software andhardware... often for profit... often for the satisfaction of fulfilling achallenge.     So use your imagination.  Come up with a project to expand yourexperience with your Apple II's.  Share with us what you have accomplished.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[NUL]NEW UPLOADS TO THE A2 LIBRARY"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""There is a new upload in the publications/genielamp_the.lamp directory:File: index031116.txtSize: 596726Date: Dec 7The LAMP INDEX file is a topical index of nearly every individual articlethat was posted in the digital magazines GEnieLamp A2 from April 1992through October 1997, GEnieLamp A2Pro February 1993 through January 1996,and The Lamp! from January 1998 through the present.Uploaded by the author, Steven Weyhrich.Tony Ward, A2 Librarian(A2.TONY, Cat 2, Top 37, Msg 23)>>>>>"""""Here are some more new uploads.

Life keeps me busy enough thata consistent picking-up and putting-away routine escapes me. But I have mylimits; every so often, the clutter reaches a critical mass and I HAVE todo something about it. And even then, getting it ALL put in its own placemay still be difficult.     The one measure that I have found will most consistently result in apristine clean room and living environment is to move the furniture intonew locations, which FORCES me to get all the clutter put away. The resultis a room that looks new, is neat, and again is comfortable.     In the same vein, 1998 was a re-organization year for the Lamppublications. Yes, I KNOW that GenieLamp is DIFFERENT from The Lamp!, butin my mind the similarities outweigh the differences. And the first year ofthe new version for the new A2 home on Delphi reminds me of my roomreorganization; it just cleaned up things that needed cleaning, rearrangedthe furniture a bit, and the end result was better than it had been before.In fact, if you'll look at the size statistics at the end of this article,the average size of each edition of The Lamp! during 1998 was a bit greaterthan the average for the final year of GenieLamp A2.     Now, tune your Wayback Machines to 1998 and join me... (and if youknow the source of that reference, I'll take the fifth caller and give youtickets to tonight's concert...)BABY COME BACK     The year 1998 saw President Clinton finally admit to his affair withMonica Lewinsky, after nearly a year of denying that it happened. TheUnited States House of Representatives impeached him because of perjury andobstruction of justice, but the effort did not get past the Senate. El Ninowas felt to be responsible for hurricanes Mitch and Georges (which causedsevere damage to the Florida coastline and to the Caribbean region), andalso a severe heat wave and tornadoes. Two students, aged 13 and 14, shotand killed five people at an Arkansas school. Baseball players Mark McGwireand Sammy Sosa both broke long-standing homerun records. And Viagra firstappeared on the market as a treatment for male impotence.     Byte Magazine ceased publication after 22 years, after having beenpurchased by CMP Media, which published a competing magazine. The auctionweb site "eBay" made its initial stock offering as a publicly tradedcompany. The United States Justice Department began proceedings againstMicrosoft, alleging antitrust violations. Designed to make illegal the actof breaking copyright protection on any product, the Digital MillenniumCopyright Act was signed into law. The web site "Google" started as a newsearch engine, using the theory that web pages with the most links fromother sites were the most important and should appear first in a list ofsearch results. Microsoft Windows 98 was finally released in June.     At Apple Computer, Steve Jobs announced in January a profit of $47million for the company, its first in several quarters. The followingmonth, Jobs terminated technologies at Apple that were felt to beunprofitable, including the Newton and eMate line of PDAs. The CompUSA"store within a store" concept was inaugurated in March. In May the companymade its first announcements of new designs for its consumer computers, andin August the first iMacs were ready for sale. These new Macs, based on theG3 PowerPC processor and designed to be Internet ready, became thesecond-best selling computer in the country by the end of the month. Itsnew translucent styling and shape was totally different from any othercomputer that had yet appeared, and ultimately destroyed the old "beigebox" mentality of computers that had typically been sold before that time.In fact, many unrelated products rode the wave of Apple's design concept,and translucent colored plastics were popular during the next severalyears. The Claris Corporation was reabsorbed into Apple, leaving only thedatabase FileMaker to fend for itself as a separate product in a separatecompany. To further the confusion Apple renamed ClarisWorks, the Macintoshmulti-function program, as AppleWorks, completely unrelated to the Apple IIversion released fifteen years earlier.THE LAMP! INFO     Editor Ryan Suenaga had promised a redesigned online newsletter totake the place of the late great GenieLamp A2. He had considered severalpossible names, including "Delphi Oracle" (which was already in use), butwith the help of Tim Kellers (of the IIScribe Forum), Cindy Adams(KansasFest "Big Cheese") and Max Jones (of Juiced.GS), he finally settledon "The Lamp!" This maintained a connection to the older GenieLamp name,but had the added advantage of not linking itself specifically to Delphi.(This was ultimately a Good Thing, as events later turned out).     The masthead on the new newsletter looked like this for its firstissue: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||    ____________________   ___                                   _      ||   |___   ______________| |   |                                 | |     ||       |  | _             |   |                                 | |     ||       |  || |            |   |                                 | |     ||       |  || |            |   |                                 | |     ||       |  || |            |   |   ____ _   _ _   _   ______     | |     ||       |  || |            |   |  / __ \ | | / \_/ \  | ___ \    | |     ||       |  || |__   ____   |   | / /  \  | |  /\ /\ \ | |  \ \   | |     ||       |  ||  _ \ |  _ \  |   | \ \__/  | | | |_|| | | |__/ /   | |     ||       |  || | | || |_||  |   |  \___/|_| |_|    |_| | ____/    |_|     ||       |  || | | || |__   |   |____________________  | |         _      ||       |__||_| |_|\____/  |________________________| | |        |_|     ||                                                     | |                ||        Lighting Your Apple II Path On Delphi        | |                ||                                                     |_|                ||                                                                        ||                    >>> WELCOME TO THE LAMP! <<<                        ||                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                       ||                    SIZZLING SHAREWARE: MUG! 1.01                       ||          WEB SLINGING 101: Delphi Forums and the Apple II              ||           AND THE BEST OF THE A2 AND A2PRO MESSAGE BOARDS              ||                                                                        || :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  || The Lamp!

He still had aplace for information gleaned from online postings, a place for productreviews, an editorial, and extra articles as they became available. It wasmostly a matter of finding new titles for the different parts. Using abaseball motif, the editorial "From My Desktop" became "Opening Pitch", the"Log Off" credits sections became "Extra Innings", and just to bedifferent, "Hey Mister Postman" became "A Funny Thing Happened". He alsomade some small changes in the layout and appearance of the table ofcontents, but did retain the bracketed three-letter indexing system thatPeters had originated (but which had not yet been put to use by anybody).     The unauthorized reproduction of Lamp articles continued to be aproblem. These articles still appeared in user group newsletters, sometimesbeing printed in such a way as to not even identify the author or source.This was as frustrating for Suenaga as it was for programmers whose workswere being pirated. He made it clear in the inaugural issue of The Lamp!that all material that appeared within each issue was copyrighted, and wasNOT to be reproduced elsewhere without written permission. He also statedthat it was not to be distributed outside of Delphi for thirty days afterits appearance in the IIScribe Forum. He made it clear that his goal wasnot to hoard the material to himself; it was not even to make a buck (TheLamp!, as GenieLamp before it did not cost anything to obtain and read).The issue was fairness to those doing the hard work of creating articles,and that they be properly cited as the source of an article when it DIDappear elsewhere.     February's editorial discussed Suenaga's visit to San Francisco, wherehe was able to participate in PizzaFest 1998, a gathering of current andformer Apple II programmers, and also a chance to see the MacWorld Expobeing held that year. Starting with the March issue, programminginformation was added to The Lamp! with the start of the A2_ProDUCTIVITYcolumn.FORUM NEWS     Although much Apple II online activity had transitioned from Genie toDelphi, Doug Cuff pointed out in the February issue that traffic onDelphi's A2 Forum and Genie's A2 Roundtable were actually quite similarduring the first two weeks of January (23.5K per day on Delphi, and 20K perday on Genie).     Web page access to Delphi content was available to those with webbrowsers, and the Delphi A2 page was updated regularly with features toattract potential participants. While easily viewable with graphicbrowsers, the page was also designed to have a Lynx-friendly appearance forthose using text-only web surfers.     Messages appeared early in the year expressing concern about whetheror not Delphi would continue to be a text-friendly service, in the face ofthe massive onslaught of the graphical Internet via the World Wide Web.Although Delphi had upgraded itself to put its Forum postings on the Web,the standard text access via telnet continued to be available, andreassurances were given that those running the service appeared to becommitted to maintain its legacy access.     CompuServe Apple II users faced a crisis late in the year. AmericaOnline had purchased CompuServe in February of 1998, as it was steadilylosing members either to America Online or to the Internet itself. AOLplanned to update CompuServe, rather than simply absorbing it into itself.The Lamp! in its December issue saw the announcement that CompuServe wasdiscontinuing its text-only access, and would soon require a computerrunning a special front-end program in order to get onto that service. Somediscussion ensued as to how to encourage those Apple II users to make thetransition over to Delphi, which would enable them to continue to use theirApple II computers for online activities. One solution that was discussedinvolved connecting to Delphi FROM CompuServe (using it simply as anInternet Service Provider); other solutions included identifying other ISPsthat were accessible by an Apple II.     A unique event began to be held during 1998. Shareware Solutions IIsponsored a special online chat on Monday nights. What made this chatdifferent from all other previous online chats was the fact that itconnected users from Delphi AND Genie (and eventually CompuServe). It wasdesigned to work in such a way that it seemed to be one single largesystem. Tony Diaz and Dave Miller put together the hardware and softwarethat made it happen. Utilizing some special scripts for use with ProTERMMac, a message center core directed traffic between various script modules,one for each online service to which it was connected. The message centerkept track of the last fifty lines of text submitted to it, and each scriptwould send out to its respective online service any messages that hadn'tyet appeared on that service. With this managing everything, a messagetyped by someone on Genie appeared also on Delphi and CompuServe. Thisunique trick created a connection between these diverse online providersthat had likely never been done before, and has never been done since.     Tony Diaz also stayed busy working with Tony Ward, who managed theDelphi A2 file library. During this year they announced some namingstandards for uploaded files, to keep compatibility with ProDOS file namingrules, and to simplify automation of file downloads for offline readersoftware such as OLRight! and Crock 'O Gold.     One goal Syndicomm also had was to transfer the large collection offiles from the Genie Apple II library archives over to the Delphi A2 Forumlibrary. Although the process was begun during this year, it was slow. Twothings contributed to this slowness; one was the TIME involved in uploadingas many as twelve thousand files via modem, and another involvedpermissions in some cases as to whether or not a file COULD be uploaded toDelphi (due to copyright questions, requests by the file uploaders thatthey be ONLY placed on Genie, etc.) Furthermore, it was not simply a matterof just uploading the files, but also creating the file descriptions,keywords, and so on.     A2 University began operations again, this time from its new home onDelphi, and kicked things off with a course about HyperCard IIGS, taught byGareth Jones and HangTime.HARDWARE NEWS     With the availability of larger and larger capacity hard drives,July's issue saw the appearance of yet another discussion on the A2 Forumsregarding how large a drive the RamFAST card could handle (starting withthe newly affordable 1 gigabyte drives). The RamFAST also generated somedigital ink with questions about how to upgrade from a Revision B card to aC or D card, and how to make hardware changes on it to improve performance.     For those who had lost the instructions for their Zip GS acceleratorcard, the meanings of the DIP switch settings were reproduced in theSeptember issue. Also posted were suggestions on getting a Mockingboardsound card to work on a IIGS.     The No Slot Clock again made some news during 1998. This clever devicewas first available in the late 1980's, and was designed to be installedbeneath a compatible ROM or RAM chip on the motherboard of an Apple II,IIe, or IIc. With appropriate software, it was possible to have date andtime stamping on files in ProDOS without the need to use up a valuableslot. Many people had never obtained this product when it was new, and somewho DID own it had found that the non-replaceable battery within it haddied. It was found that it could still be purchased from DallasSemiconductor under the name "SmartWatch", and software suitable for theApple was available to set and control the clock. (A PDF file displayingtechnical information about the NSC can currently be downloaded at:http://pdfserv.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/DS1216-DS1216D.pdf)     FaceLift, a development kit to support the SecondSight VGA card,showed up in beta form (v0.6b1) this year.EMULATOR NEWS     Clancy Paul Computers of Princeton, NJ announced its own Apple IIeemulator, "Et ][, PC?", to run on 386 and 486 based PC computers. Thiswould allow school districts who were purchasing less expensive PC's tostill make use of their library of Apple II software. Comments in theDelphi A2 Forum viewed this as yet another failure for Apple, who couldhave promoted an emulator of their own, Gus, to accomplish the same purposeon a Macintosh.     Although not specifically an emulator issue, comments were posted onhow to transfer files from an Apple II over to an IBM PC. Even for thosewho continued to use their Apple II computers, it was sometimes necessaryto move something from one computer to the other.     Bernie ][ The Rescue, though still not felt to be as fast as Gus,continued to make improvements, and had the advantage of active support anddevelopment (including changes to support Wolfenstein 3D). There wereongoing discussions regarding what minimum model of Macintosh (desktop andportable) was needed to run Bernie and get adequate performance.     F.E. Systems started an e-mail list for news about Bernie. Discussionduring the year included finding ways to get files from a IIGS over to aMac for use with Bernie. Henrik Gudat, one of F.E. Systems' programmers,also added his thoughts about the usefulness of a well performing emulator,as opposed to spending money on creating a new Apple IIGS from hardwareparts, or trying to upgrade the machine in other hardware hacking ways. Hestated that emulation, whether with Bernie or with Gus, was the onlycost-effective way to "push the Apple II platform ahead", with suggestionsthat adding features to the computer was much simpler with an emulator thanwith a physical computer. Although this was also a hotly debated topic (howdo you make use of an enhanced IIGS when there is no software that knowssuch a computer exists?), one enhancement that did eventually appear in theproduct was the ability to address more memory than was ever possible in areal IIGS. In the December issue, the pending release of v2.0 of Bernie wasannounced. Also in that issue was an article by editor Suenaga promotingthe use of Zip disk cartridges to transfer data from a IIGS to a Macrunning Bernie. Suenaga also wrote an article (more of an FAQ) about how tomake use of Bernie on a PowerBook, creating (in essence) the long-desiredportable Apple IIGS.     Adding to emulator choices, "Sweet 16" became available (in beta form)during 1998. This was an authorized port of Bernie ][ The Rescue designedto run under BeOS, on either Intel or PowerPC hardware. Although started byF.E. Systems, Eric Shepherd took the project forward and brought it tocompletion.SOFTWARE NEWS:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::     The Byte Works was finishing up work on GSoft BASIC, the GS/OS BASICinterpreter that had been announced the prior year, and in July put out acall for beta testers for the product. At KansasFest 1998 its final releasewas announced. Juiced.GS had plans for a series of columns to be written byEric Shepherd dealing with GSoft BASIC and its use. Some Delphi A2 Forummessages dealing with this BASIC appeared in the October issue.     Shareware Solutions II released Nifty Spell, a spell checker in an NDAfor the IIGS. The original product announcement was made at KansasFest (seebelow).:: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::     Spectrum Internet Suite (SIS) and Spectrum continued to brave the newfrontiers of the Internet for Apple IIGS users, and Sevens Hills Softwarecontinued to produce updates to the product as author Ewen Wannop made themavailable. Discussions in January included offering help in identifyingSIS-friendly ISPs. It was still necessary to have an ISP that provided"shell" access, as this was a requirement of the original version ofMarinetti.      Richard Bennett continued to work on improvements to Marinetti. InMarch he posted that he had successfully connected to the Internet usingPPP, rather than requiring a SLIP connection as was previously necessary.By KansasFest, he was ready to announce version 2.0 of this product. It.wasTCP/IP capable, and it was available for download by late September.Because of the improvements in Marinetti, Spectrum and SIS were alsoupdated.     Automated access to Delphi's Forums was still encouraged with offlinereaders. Ewen Wannop's Crock O' Gold 2.0 improved the function over COG1.x. By April, this had been updated to v2.3, and to v2.6 by November.     OLRight! 3.0 was released as a major revision, with many speedimprovements, and by mid-year was again updated to v3.1.     Jeff Blakeney began work on a POP3/SMTP e-mail client for the IIGS,which he planned to call "The Mailbox".:: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::     SheppyWare continued production of Apple IIGS utilities, with therelease of KeyNotifier 1.4. Sheppy also announced in September that all ofhis old Softdisk G-S software had been updated and released as freeware orshareware. WebWorks GS, an HTML editor, was announced at KansasFest andlater updated to version 1.1, and to v1.2 by the end of the year.ShiftyList 2.0.1 fixed some bugs in the original 2.0 release. ProBOOT wasupdated to v5.3, LotsaTools to v1.1.1, and Cleaner Clean Up to v1.0.6.     Twilight II, released back in 1993 by Jim Maricondo of DigisoftInnovations, was in the process of an update written by Nathan Mates. Hebegan to make mention of it in messages reproduced in the April issue ofThe Lamp!, and by May it was reported to be quite close to release.Furthermore, it had been decided to make the update available ascopyrighted freeware. All who commented on it were pleased with itsstability and features.     HardPressed, a disk compression utility written by Andy McFadden, wasreleased to freeware status in mid 1998. (Note: McFadden has a current website, http://www.fadden.com, with this and other software he has written.It also includes many interesting features, including an elaboratepractical joke played on an co-worker).     Babelfish, newly released by Seven Hills Software, allowed anapplication to export or import data to and from other programs, usingBabelfish as an intermediary (with the installation of appropriatetranslators). The September issue reprinted messages about difficulties ingetting it to work with older software.:: GAMES ::     Some programmers made comments about designing an 8-bit Apple IIversion of Snood (a Mac game) to run on the Apple II. However, nothingfurther developed on this, much to Big Cheese Cindy Adams' disappointment.     Wolfenstein 3D was finally released for the Apple IIGS on Valentine'sDay 1998, after (literally) years of development. Programmer Eric Shepherdregistered over two thousand downloads of the game during the first twoweeks that it was available, indicating the great anticipation for the gamethat Apple IIGS users had -- especially interesting when it is taken intoaccount that it required a IIGS with an accelerator in order for the gameto be even playable. It also required at least 4 MB of RAM and a hard disk.     With the popularity of Wolfenstein 3D, much discussion ensued on howbest to run the game, A hint was included in the April issue by DonZahniser describing how to start the game from the UtilityLaunch programselector. Also, a bug that would cause problems with memory and causerandom crashes or glitches in the display of graphics was corrected, andversion 1.1 of the game was released. Even the emulator Bernie ][ TheRescue was updated to be able to run Wolfenstein 3D.     Sheppy also wrote Wolfenstein 3D Scenario Converter, to allowcustom-made maps made for the game on the Macintosh to be useable on theIIGS. A later update fixed a bug that caused crashing on quit.     Another popular PC and Mac game, the original Sim City, waspotentially a candidate for porting to the IIGS. However, Maxis (who ownedthe rights to the game) wanted a very large sum of money for the rights torelease the game, so the conversion (which Bill Heineman had started) wascanceled immediately.     Shisen-sho is the name for a variation of the game MahJongg. KelvinSherlock released his version of this game for the Apple IIGS in September1998, and named it GShisen. It was immediately hailed as an addictive,well-done game, and has since been featured prominently at KansasFest.HACKING     In the July issue, A2 Forum denizens were trying to create thepenultimate list of System 6.0.1 patches, including those published bySoftdisk G-S and GS+ Magazine. There was some discussion (and disagreement)as to what constituted a patch (to correct a bug), and what was anenhancement (to add a feature that was never in the software).INTERNET NEWS     David Kerwood (who had started the "A2-Web!" web site) also created"The Apple II Web Ring", a list for Apple II-related web sites to use inlinking to each other. Suenaga started a web page that was included in theweb ring list (sub-hosted on the SheppyWare web site) on which he hadstarted putting back issues of The Lamp! By mid year, the A2 Web Ring hadgrown to twenty-six members.     In August, the Trenco FTP site came online as a file repository on theInternet for Apple II files. (Note that this is still available today, andcan be accessed via a web browser at http://www.gno.org/pub/apple2).     Tony Diaz expanded his Apple II Information Resource web site, withimages of many peripheral cards (both common and obscure) for the Apple IIand IIGS.PUBLICATIONS     Hyper Quarterly appeared again early in the year, shipping itsNovember 1997 issue. No further issues appeared during this year, as AppleBlossom Publishing had chose to discontinue The Apple Blossom newsletterdue to financial constraints. The AppleWorks Gazette did not publish anynew issues or get mentioned in The Lamp! this year.     Juiced.GS continued to be published regularly, and Shareware SolutionsII released Vol 3 Issue 6 and Vol 4 Issue 1 during 1998. With the help ofAlltech Electronics, Shareware Solutions II also awarded a randomly drawnsubscriber an 8 meg Sirius II RAM card.COMPANIES     Eric Shepherd's SheppyWare also began to make use of available onlinetechnology, and started an e-mail announcement list ("SheppyWare-Talk") tokeep interested customers notified of news and new releases. Sheppy hadalso created his own web site, providing Internet access and news about hissoftware creations. Originally "www.sheppyware.ml.org", he later got hisown domain name and re-launched the site this year as "www.sheppyware.net"(which is still active). During the year he reclassified some of hisproducts as freeware, due to decreased demand (and decreased willingness ofusers to pay shareware fees). To simplify shareware payments on productsthat still required them, he arranged for payment via Kagi (a servicestarted back in 1994 to make it easier for small software houses to receivecredit-card payments and online transactions). Because of the decline inApple II sales via shareware, Sheppy announced that he would be reducingthe number of Apple II titles that he would produce, due to the time hewould need to spend producing a livable income on Macintosh and BeOSdevelopment.     Shareware Solutions II continued to make shareware and oldercommercial Apple II products available for sale, as well as some productionof newsletters. Kohn arranged with Eric Shepherd to distribute hisSheppyWare programs and utilities through the SSII distribution network.     Scantron Quality Computers had not made any news in 1997 that appearedin GenieLamp, and their only appearance in 1998 in The Lamp! was for GinaSaikin (former GEnie RTC host and then an employee of Scantron) to producea list of Apple II software that they were selling out (not necessarily atbargain prices).     Seven Hills Software had a summer sale, as well as announcing upgradesto several of their products, including GraphicWriter III v2.1, SIS 1.1,Spectrum 2.2, Disk Access II v2.0, and Babelfish (see more discussion onthese below).KANSASFEST     KFest was planned again this year for the last week of July. By therelease of the April issue of The Lamp!, there were enough participants tobe able to hold the event for this year. InTrec Software sponsored theevent.     Several months prior to KFest 1998, Pat Kern released a product thatwas not a software package or a hardware add-on for the Apple II, but apicture album covering KansasFest 1995, 1996, and 1997, and was offeringthis for sale to previous conference-goers.     In anticipation of the event, Ryan Suenaga began a series called"Thinking KFest", and wrote on various topics pertinent to the event. Onesuch topic was how to put a IIGS motherboard, connectors and power supplywithin a space small enough to make it easier to travel to Kansas City fromhis home in Hawaii. Another had to do with handling the coordination of theevent with Internet e-mail, since it was not primarily a Genie-relatedevent any longer. He also discussed the efforts made to put informationabout KFest on the Internet, including a list of various web sites wherepictures and information about KFests in the past had been posted.     Doug Cuff's "Accidental Tourist At KansasFest" article was againupdated for this year's event. One of the modifications to the article wasto add information on how to access Delphi from Avila College (priorversions of this had only mentioned Genie).     One of the first announcements at the conference was the new KFest webpage, http://www.kfest.org. Mike Westerfield gave the keynote address, andthe annual roast, hosted by Joe Kohn, featured hardware expert Tony Diaz.     Richard Bennett announced Marinetti 2.0 (mentioned previously).Concurrent with this was Spectrum 2.2, which Ewen Wannop had updated to bemake use of the new features offered by Marinetti. Additionally, Spectrumcould also now open connections to several sites simultaneously. And, tomake the trio complete, Geoff Weiss announced an update to SpectrumInternet Suite (SIS) to take advantage of the other two product'senhancements. SIS was expected to be ready to release by late September.Weiss also demonstrated an FTP client that he was working on.     Product announcements also included: * Shareware Solutions II: Nifty Spell by Chris Vavruska, a universal spellchecker for the IIGS (this was available by October); and the TABBS CD-ROMcollection of the software libraries of three Apple II groups in GreatBritain.* Seven Hills Software: Babelfish, Spectrum 2.2 (released in October), SIS1.1, and Disk Access II v2.0 * SheppyWare: WebWorks GS, an HTML creation tool (also mentioned above)     Hackfest was held for the first year, a competition betweenprogrammers trying to create something useful within the short space oftime afforded by KFest. The winning entry was Michael Hackett's patch toWordWorks Pro, which eliminated the advertising window that came up eachtime the program was quit.     After the event, Suenaga wrote an article that detailed hisexperiences on the trip to, from, and during KanasFest.REVIEWSThe reviews that appeared in The Lamp! during its first year of publicationwere all written by the editor. Of these reviews, all but two dealt withsoftware, and only two software products were new (MUG! and Disk AccessII). The older products that were reviewed were, however, classics thatevery Apple II (especially IIGS) user should be aware of:o Apple II 3.5 SuperDrive controller cardo Focus Drive 520, from Alltech Electronicso File-A-Trix, by Karl Bunkero Disk Access II, by Steven Stephenson & Ewen Wannopo Hermes, by Andre Horstmanno Hierarchic 1.6.3, by Etienne Petitjean & Richard Bennetto Init Restarter 2.0.2, by Matt Deatherageo MUG! NDA v1.01, by Peter Watsono Quit-To, by Karl Bunkero Unzip IIe, by Russ WoodroofeWRITERS     Although he did not write this specifically for The Lamp!, Ken Gagneposted on Delphi an article he had written for his local newspaper,"KansasFest '98 and the Apple II", and this posting appeared in theSeptember issue of The Lamp!INTERVIEWS     No interviews appeared in The Lamp! during 1998.MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES     Suenaga wrote several columns entitled "Web Slinging 101" about use ofthe Internet from a text-based computer user's point of view. Topicsincluded the use of Lynx to access Delphi A2 and A2Pro, telnet to accessDelphi through a shell account, Apple II websites and also how to use theweb space made available with a Delphi account, and use of FTP to uploadfiles to Delphi.     Although this had once been managed by Apple Computer, theresponsibility for registration of Apple II ProDOS filetypes had forseveral years been handled by Resource Central, and then by Syndicomm. In1998 it was still possible to do this, now through the programmers runningDelphi A2Pro.STATS     Here are statistics for the first seven years of GEnieLamp and TheLamp! The numbers refer to the size of each issue in "K" (kilobytes):Year    Min     Max     Avg----    ----    ----    ----1992    116K    212K    156K1993     80K    256K    172K1994    124K    216K    165K1995     92K    176K    125K1996     80K    192K    116K1997     44K    124K     85K1998     68K    156K    102KTOO LATE TO TURN BACK NOW     Since we've gone this far, it would be unfair to leave the rest of thestory untold. So, join me here again next month as The Lamp! sails into itssecond year of publication, and the spector of global disaster from thedreaded Y2K bug rears its head. Are our heroes headed for that greatBatcave in the sky? In scant weeks, the answer will be yours!Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.orgReferences:Apple History Timelinehttp://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/history.htmlThe Apple Museumhttp://applemuseum.bott.org/Computer History For 1990-2000http://www.computerhope.com/history/19902000.htmHistory of Computing Industrial Era 1994-2000http://www.thocp.netInformation Please: 1998http://infoplease.lycos.com/year/1998.htmlPrima Games Interview with John Romerohttp://www.primagames.com/news/interview/921/Timeline of the 90s, 1998http://www.inthe90s.com/generated/time1998.shtmlWikipedia: The Free Encyclopediahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[SPS]Syndicomm Online PRICE SLASHED""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Effective January 1, we're making some changes to our pricing model.We're slashing the annual rate from $75/year to $35/year, and we'reeliminating the monthly and quarterly plans.You will receive your next bill at the appropriate time, and willautomatically be migrated to the new $35/year plan.We hope that the less-frequent billing will be more convenient, and we'resure you'll appreciate the reduced price!Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, HelpDesk, Cat 5, Top 5, Msg 18)[EOA][TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][SOU]Syndicomm Online UPGRADES"""""""""""""""""""""""""We're going to be working the next few weeks on some server upgrades thatshould provide some new features, but in the interim may result inoccasional outages.
