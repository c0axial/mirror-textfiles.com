This afternoonwill be a great time for a hike in the woods.     Fall has brought changes to the scenery on the road to PecatonicaRiver Forest Preserve.  The mature corn stalks and soy beans, awaitingharvest, have turned a deep brown.  The trees in the farmsteads display amultitude of colors.     The walk in the woods of the forest preserve allows close examinationof the individual leaves... the golds, reds, yellows, purples, and browns.The dry fallen leaves covering the trails are crunchy under foot... a veryspecial part of a Fall walk in the woods.                      Consistency in a Chicken Dinner                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Next we drive to a country Church just outside Durand.  TrinityLutheran Church is putting on their 82nd annual chicken dinner.  For $8 youget "cast iron skillet browned baked chicken", homemade noodles, mashedpotatoes, gravy, green beans, cole slaw, rolls, butter, and homemade pie.You don't go away hungry.     Is cast iron skillet browned baked chicken anything special?  Yes itis... the flavor is fabulous.  After all, they have had 82 years to perfecttheir technique.                 KansasFest 2007 - Changes and Consistency                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     There is consistency in KFest... held each Summer in Kansas City.There is a refreshing change for this coming KFest... the KeyNote Speakerhas already been chosen.

I use my Macintosh now for webaccess but use my IIgs for most of my email and for Syndicomm/A2.Centralaccess.  For the GS access, I call long distance to the home number for myISP, which is TTY telnet friendly.

What do you give the kids whenthey call, and what exactly does 'Trick and Treat' mean? <<It's supposed to be trick OR treat. If you don't give a treat, they play atrick on you. Traditionally it involved soap on windows, or fruit or eggsthrown. Most people give treats.In my youth, treats often were fruit, or homemade goodies. Thanks to nastypeople tampering with such treats, now we only give commercially wrappedtreats, such as candy or cookies.We used to buy bags of cheap candy, and hand out 2 or 3 per kid, but now webuy more expensive things like packets of cookies (2) and give one each.We have been getting a few more kids each year since we switched. Carl Knoblock - Retired - Sat  7 Oct 06  11:44:18 pm cknoblo@cox.net - Via Spectrum v2.5.3 & SOAR v1.0b10 KFest 2007, July 17-22, 2007 - 283 days till KFest On cable via LANceGS & Marinetti 2.0.1 - Thank you, Richard. A2 RTC Staff - Sunday Night House Party - cknoblo@gmail.com(CARLK, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 675)>>>>>"""""The kids in my village come around in packs of five or six, and that can beup to six groups over the night.

Dubbed "Lode RunnerDeluxe," the new version of the game is expected to launch on both Brew andJava platforms in the North American market during fall 2006."Lode Runner was one of the first games we launched on the NintendoEntertainment System." said John Greiner, President and CEO of HudsonEntertainment. "Since then, we have worked to bring out new versions onvarious platforms. For mobile, we wanted to come full circle, and a newversion of the game that harkened back to the original, but with all newgraphics that truly push the boundaries of what's possible in mobile gamingtoday."About The Lode Runner FranchiseOriginally created by Doug Smith, Lode Runner launched on the Apple 2 in1983. The game featured cleverly designed levels, and pick-up-and-playgameplay that quickly became a hit among gamers. Unlike other games, gamerscould not directly attack enemies in this game. Much of the gameplaymechanic is based around digging holes, either to dig for treasure, toescape an enemy, or to trap an enemy. This aspect was what truly separatedit from any other. Over the years, numerous versions of the game havelaunched on multiple platforms. Hudson Soft later developed the game forNES, which became the first million unit seller on that system, as well asLode Runner for the PS2, which featured 3D levels. Since then, HudsonEntertainment has launched Lode Runner on cellphones, and is now planningto update the game with Lode Runner Deluxe.Lode Runner Deluxe features:* All new art style with vibrant graphics and fluid animations - unlike anyLode Runner game in the past!* Classic Lode Runner gameplay - collect treasures on each map, as yououtwit enemies, and escape!* The game is planned to launch with up to 50 levels initially with newlevels available each month, eventually totaling over 100 levels!About Hudson Entertainment, Inc.Hudson Entertainment is the North American publishing arm of Hudson Soft,an international provider of games and entertainment content founded in1973.
