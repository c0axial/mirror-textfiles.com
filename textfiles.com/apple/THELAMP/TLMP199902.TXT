This month, it's stilltime to seize the day--this time by voting with our wallets for thecontinued development of Apple II products.     It's now been 22 years since the Apple II was first sprung on anunexpecting world--a virtual generation of computer users has been raisedon this most humble of platforms.  At every turn, you'll still find thosewho use the II (or used the II) in every aspect of life.  Today, theteenagers of yesteryear who hacked 8-bits in the Monitor of the Apple //eare system administrators at Internet Service Providers, and authors ofApple II software from the early 1980's are putting out packages for theMacintosh or Windows.  Those of us with an Apple II in our past find thatthe skills we learned back then have translated well in the information ageof today.     The future of the Apple II is now assured, thanks to the work of F.E.Systems.  _Bernie ][ The Rescue_ and _Sweet 16_ will run on the two majorhardware platforms available today, with abilities mostly equal to (andspeed far in excess of) even the most hot rodded Apple IIgs around.     So do we honor the Apple IIs of our past and ensure the Apple IIs ofour future--but what of the present?     We stand at a crossroads with the Apple II--again.     1998 could have been the year of the Apple II comeback--and in fact,we had enough new and exciting software (at least for the Apple IIgs) tomake it so.     But it wasn't.     Almost a year ago in this publication, I wrote these words:     "The hard questions beg to be asked: if 2,000 Apple IIgs users on the'Net can download the most highly anticipated game in recent memory, whydon't we have more subscribers to _Shareware Solutions II_ or _Juiced.GS_?Why is _The Apple Blossom_ ending its run?  Why are our shareware authorsstruggling to justify another Apple II project?  Sadly, while the Apple IIappears alive on the 'Net, its vital signs elsewhere appear weak.     "Still, two thousand downloads is an exciting number, and hopefullythose two thousand files translate into two thousand excited Apple II userswho will keep the faith well into the next century and do what they need todo to keep Apple II support alive.     "In the meantime, I'll continue to check for vital signs from time totime, and keep an eye out for other signs of Apple II Life on the 'Net."     Those other signs of Apple II life stayed weak.     Since the time I wrote those words, we've had a large influx of newand exciting products (introductions were centered largely aroundKansasFest)--from freeware and shareware to commercial software toreclassifications of classic favorites.  Yet almost a year later, the AppleII marketplace continues to struggle.     Those Apple II developers and publishers who continue to producesoftware and hardware do so mostly as a labor of love, but without enoughfinancial support to keep them in business, how long will that last?     Will we learn from the lessons that the last year has taught us?     There's still time to seize the day.  Make 1999 the year that 1998could have been--the year of the Apple II comeback.                                [*] [*] [*]     Guess I'll Pack My Bags And Run Away Department: Kevin Noonan, akaGSWOMBAT@delphi.com produced a fabulous little printed newsletter called_Apple II Update_, based in Australia.

It's already"""""""""""""""""""""   fixed. :) There will be a maintenance release (akaMS service pack :) this evening or tomorrow latest that will address theSpeedNanny bug as well as the earlier completed but unreleased Marinettifix. If you are subscribed to the Bernie news mailing (a very low trafficmailing list), you will learn about the maintenance release as soon as it'sout.(http://www.magnet.ch/emutech/Bernie/List)Woof, henrik                        (GUDATH, 19884, GO COM A2)MUSCLING UP WITH MARINETTI   Well, this might not help much but it never""""""""""""""""""""""""""   hurts to try.  Have you set the serial portspeed in Marinetti to 57600 bps?  This might be a little fast even for youraccelerated IIgs so dropping to a slower speed like 38400 or even 19200 bpsmight help and make sure that your modem is set to not connect at a speedfaster than the serial port speed.I don't think the serial port speed is really the problem but yourmentioning that your modem uses a Rockwell chipset might mean your modem isan RPI modem.  This type of modem expects the computer to handle datacompression and, more importantly, error correction.  If modems havedifficulty talking to each other they try to do error correction to makesure the data gets through.  If your modem is an RPI one, then your modem,connected to your IIgs, is incapable of doing the error correction and youwill most definitely get line noise and such when running at higher speeds.Now, I'm sure others will come along and mention that Marinetti does errorcorrection by virtue of the fact that TCP/IP is an error correctingtransfer protocol. However, if Marinetti or the machine it is connected tokeep getting errors, they have to request that the data get resent and theerrors can occur in this data again and so on.The faster your modem is set to go, the more errors you will usually runinto and the more time that will be wasted by Marinetti requesting packetsbe resent as well as resending packets.  This could end up causing yourDomain Name Server and connection requests to "time out".  This would alsoexplain why it works some times and doesn't others because the telephoneline conditions can be better some times than others which would mean lesserrors some times than others.I hope this helps.  Otherwise, I just spent a lot of time typing fornothing.  :-) Jeff Blakeney - Dean of the Apple II University in A2Pro       ** HyperCard IIgs Course now in session! **                       (JBLAKENEY, 19994, GO COM A2)THIS MONTH'S BLATANT HARDWARE PLUG   FWIW, Paul Lawson recently offered a""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   few 1/3 height IBM SCSI drives (modelDSAS-3720) for sale at an excellent price.  I ordered a couple and havebeen fooling with them for about three days now.These are very very very nice drives particularly for the price, speedy andspacious with built in active termination (if you want it).  Specs on thedrives are available at:http://www.storage.ibm.com/techsup/hddtech/dsas/dsasjum.htmAlthough you can probably figure everything out using Lynx or SIS, agraphical browser would be best to see the accompanying diagrams.To make a long story short, the question was posed to me:"Do these drives work with an Apple II?"With the standard qualifications, the answer is yes.What qualifications am I talking about?1) The drive does -not- supply terminator power, so you must have some   other SCSI device supply it.  If you have a RamFAST, set the jumper on   the Rev. D card or the DIP switch on the Rev. B/C cards to supply power;   if you have an Apple High Speed or Rev. C SCSI card, do the term power   modification; or use a drive on the chain that does supply terminator   power.2) If you use this drive with a RamFAST, you are limited to 12 partitions   on the drive.  As you can see, that's at most 11 ProDOS partitions, with   about 350 megs or so left over which can be made a single HFS partition   if you'd like.Aside from that, this drive is a great deal for Apple II users, as well asfor users of other platforms who can use a relatively small boot drive or adrive to master CDROMs with.  I think Paul will be getting more soonalthough maybe not at quite a good a price as last time.  Rest assured thateven at double, maybe even triple the price of his previous offer, theseare a total steal.(Unsolicited Blatant Plug, copyright 1999). - Ryan  --  rsuenaga@apple2.org  --  http://lamp.sheppyware.net Posted by ProTERM Mac and PTMM v2.5 - The integrated information solution                       (RSUENAGA, 18910, GO COM A2)ASCENDING ACCENTIT   This is a Temporary Initialization File that always""""""""""""""""""   checks the GS keyboard translation preference to makesure it is set to "Standard" at boot time and when changing applications.This has been a valuable system extension for me, because Spectrum doesadjust keyboard translation when online, and under certain rarecircumstances (like a system hang or crash) might leave your translationpreferences changed, thereby forcing you to manually go into the GeneralControl Panel and change it back from "None" to "Standard." Max Jones, Juiced.GS http://www.wbwip.com/juiced.gs Delivered by Spectrum 2.2 and Crock O' Gold 3.0b5 beta                       (JUICEDGS, 18984, GO COM A2)IRONTOOTH'S SPEAKERPHONE SCRIPT   Well, I was going to post this to the"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   database, but if you would like to tryit, and let me know if you have any problems...The following is an ANSITerm script for Rockwell-based modems withspeakerphone capability (look for a microphone and speaker jack on themodem).

There will be no interrupts generatedthat might interfere with the data, and even a stock unaccelerated IIgsshould connect cleanly at 57600 baud.Under GS/OS there can be a whole chain of things in the interrupt loop thateither grab system time, or just take too long to execute.

HP has recently released the DeskJet 420, a IIGScompatible color capable ink jet printer which costs $119 Retail.Now, for the bad news...The following DeskJet 700 series are not compatible with the IIGS: 710,712, 720 or 722.During the past few years, HP has offered several models of DeskJet thatcould not be used with the IIGS. Those printers (such as the short-lived DJ820CSe) had a silkscreen designation on the front of them that said: "ForWindows."The 700 series of IIGS incompatible printers no longer have the silkscreen"For Windows" designation. And, to make things even more confusing, the722c comes in two different boxes; the older box clearly states that theprinter is for use with Windows only, but the newer box doesn't.There _is_ information listed on the side of the boxes and in HP'sliterature which indicates which DeskJets will work on the IIGS, but onlyif you know exactly what you are looking for.ALL DeskJet printers which work on the IIGS have two things in common: theysupport HP's PCL Level 3 printer language, and they are compatible withMS-DOS. Since PCL is backwards compatible, PCL Level 4 and 5 printers canalso be used on a IIGS.It appears as if all other current models of DeskJet (aside from the 710,712, 720, 722) do support PCL3 and are MS-DOS compatible, and so they areIIGS compatible.So, if you are looking for a new DeskJet, you are going to have to look atthe box and/or at HP's literature. If the box says MS-DOS (or DOS 3.3 andlater) and PCL, then it'll work on the IIGS, with Harmonie. If it says onlyWindows, Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows NT, it will not work with aIIGS.Joe KohnPublisher of Harmonie(The GS/OS printer drivers which work with HP printers.)http://www.crl.com/~joko                       (JOE_KOHN, 19149, GO COM A2)<<<<<   Considering that the vast majority of DeskJets work great on the"""""   IIGS, it would be much more efficient to simply list the modelsthat do not work, as I already did with the 710, 712, 720 and 722. IOW,every DeskJet currently sold by HP, except for these four models, workgreat on a IIGS.To save Barry and any one else some time and effort, I already have theanswers I was looking for, and have posted the information.And, if all works out, I should soon have a list of ALL DeskJets which areincompatible with the Apple IIGS. There are only a couple, though. And, allthe others say on the front of the printer: "For Windows."But, in short, if it's designated as a For-Windows, Windows-Only, or as aWinPrinter, then it's just not going to work on a IIGS. Or a II, II+, IIe,IIc or IIc+. Or, on any of Tony Diaz's prototypes.Joe                       (JOE_KOHN, 19177, GO COM A2)<<<<<   In my quest to get answers, I visited three local stores yesterday"""""   that sell HP printers, and fortunately, managed to avoid talking toany salespeople. Since I knew exactly what I was looking for, I looked atall the printers, grabbed all the HP sales brochures I could find, andlooked at the actual boxes that the DJs come in.To that end, I can assure everyone that the current DeskJets that work withthe IIGS are noted on both the literature and the boxes as being MS-DOScompatible.Or, you could just say the heck with the reading of fine-print, and justbuy the DeskJet 420 for $119. When used on a IIGS, even the newest, top ofthe line DeskJet is only going to operate as a PCL Level 3 printer, whichis what the 420 is. Aside from print speed, there is nothing to be gainedby buying a more expensive DJ if all you have is a IIGS.Joe                       (JOE_KOHN, 19179, GO COM A2)<<<<<   Two other IIGS incompatible DeskJets are the 820C and 1000C series"""""   printers. Neither of these models are currently available; theyhave both been discontinued.In the case of the DJ 820Cse, I know for a fact that this one has the "ForWindows" designation silkscreened on the front. I have not seen the DJ1000c printer to know whether it carries that silkscreen designation.So to re-cap, the following won't work on the Apple II: DeskJets 710c,712c, 720c, 722c, 820c and 1000c.There may be just one or two others, but I need to do a little moreresearch before I can say for sure.Joe Kohn                       (JOE_KOHN, 19180, GO COM A2)THE FUTURE OF THE IIGS ONLINE   These days, I generally continue to use"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   ProTerm 3.1 for manual logins, and Spectrumfor its script-driven add-ons like SIS and COG.But yesterday, for the first time ever, I actually imagined that at somepoint in the future, I might be retiring ProTerm.I spent some time yesterday getting Spectrum v2.2 all set up, and finallygot around to installing and trying Sheppy's gsAIM (I'm JoeKohn99) andGeoff's ftp-client.

Anythingless than that will not necessarily work with any of my software.

(Withthe notable exception of Woofenstein 3D.) Of course, there will be sporadiclapses on our part, and if a developer depends on non-standard featuresthere's a chance it will be implemented.

For those who read Shareware Solutions II,the NiftySpell / GShisen graphic that appeared on the back cover of thelatest issue took more than 25 attempts before I deemed it "a keeper."Printing 3200 color graphics is, in a sense, a very special case because3200 color graphics aren't exactly standard.There is a freeware program available, written by my former associate JohnWrenholt, that is called Print3200. But, because Print3200 does not workwith GS/OS's Print Manager, it only prints to an ImageWriter II. But,surprisingly, it does do a real good job.DreamGraphix does work with the Print Manager, so you can print 3200 colorgraphics on a DJ if you own that program. But, the results you get willvary, and to be truthful, most of them will not look very good when printedout.OTOH, most 3200 color graphics really only contain 256 distinct colors. So,it's always possible to convert a 3200 mode graphic to 256 colors, and thenthat can be loaded into a IIGS paint program such as Platinum Paint, andthe results will be much more visually pleasing. I should add, in my humbleopinion.Since I'm the publisher of Harmonie, I'll answer your questions aboutpricing and ordering, but because I'm obviously biased, I should perhapslet users of the two sets of Printer Drivers answer your question aboutwhich is best or better.Joe Kohn                       (JOE_KOHN, 19347, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Both are acceptable, but Harmonie is superior.

MINUS ONE   A post on comp.sys.apple2""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   reminded me that the yearlook-up table in ProDOS 8 expires periodically. Specifically, the look-uptable in version 2.0.3 (the last version released by Apple) was only goodthrough 1998. 1999 is here, of course...I don't know if this subject hasbeen brought up on Delphi, but if you're using a clock card in a IIe, yourcomputer now thinks it's 1993 again!Here's some of the text from a message I posted to comp.sys.apple2 on thissubject:     ProDOS will need to be updated once every five or six years. Apple     released a version of ProDOS specifically to deal with this problem     happening once before, in 1992. I found a directory on my hard drive     that I'd forgotten about; it had a version "1.9A" of ProDOS that I had     hacked on New Year's '92 to get the clock to work right again (I was     running a BBS on my IIe at the time, so having the right date was     important). ProDOS 8 v2.0.1, which fixed the problem, was released on     4 Mar 92 (I don't recall if there was a v2.0 that was released     earlier).     Since ProDOS was designed with the Thunderclock (a clock card that     didn't keep track of the year at all) in mind, it used a look-up table     to determine the year. I haven't looked at the actual code, but I     imagine it uses the current Julian date mod 7 and the day of the week     to index into the table. I found the table in the then-current version     of ProDOS and changed it to cover a different range of years.     Here's something I came up with on my own to figure the current year     from the current month, date, and day of the week. First, convert the     month and date to a single number. Add the date to the appropriate     number from this table:     Jan=0 Jul=181     Feb=31 Aug=212     Mar=59 Sep=243     Apr=90 Oct=273     May=120 Nov=304     Jun=151 Dec=334     Divide this number by 7. Subtract from the remainder the day-of-week     number; the day-of-week number is a simple progression where Sunday is     0, Monday is 1, and so on up to 6 for Saturday. If the difference is     positive, it's your offset into the look-up table. If it's negative,     add 7 and use that as your offset into the look-up table. I'm guessing     that the Thunderclock driver inside ProDOS does something similar; I     crunched the numbers, and they agree with the tables I've found in     different ProDOS versions.     I diff'd my "v1.9A" and the actual v1.9, which I had backed up on     floppy. The year table was at offset 0x3276-0x327C in both files. v1.9     had a table to cover 1986 to 1991 (the decimal value of the last two     digits of a year is in each byte...the sequence from v1.8 is 0x5A     (90), 0x59 (89), 0x58 (88), 0x58 (88), 0x57 (87), 0x56 (86), 0x5B     (91). The revised table I put together covered 1992 to 1996: 0x60 0x5F     0x5E 0x5D 0x5C 0x5C 0x60. In v2.0.3 (the last version of ProDOS 8),     the table lives at offset 0xF76-0xF7C and covers 1993 to 1998. Leap     years appear twice in each table, which is why they're only good for     five or six years each instead of seven.     From this information, you can figure up revised tables for any range     of five or six years. For instance, here's a sequence that ought to be     good until 28 Feb 2004 (from 29 Feb 2004 to the end of that year, the     year would mistakenly be reported as 1999): 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x63 0x04     0x03 0x02.     In case someone hasn't already done this, here are some "cookbook"     instructions to patch ProDOS 8 v2.0.3 for years beginning with 1999.     Go to a BASIC.SYSTEM prompt and enter the following commands one at a     time (snip this out and put it in a script to EXEC if you want):     BLOAD PRODOS,TSYS,A$2000     POKE 12150,1     POKE 12151,0     POKE 12152,0     POKE 12153,99     POKE 12154,4     POKE 12155,3     POKE 12156,2     BSAVE PRODOS,TSYS,A$2000     You might want to make a backup copy of your ProDOS file before you do     this, of course.

Other than a problem that can be traced to a hardwareproblem.The original above 4MB problem stems from ROM 0. Put simply the Apple IIgswill DMA into the first 4MB of EXPANDED RAM. Meaning the first 4MB of RAMin the slot.If all these horror stories were true to what the were being told as, thenevery ROM 3 with a 4MB card would be crashing or whatever it is they do.If the RAM area being accessed is higher than the 4MB DMA range thecomputer simply does not DMA there.The original AE RAM cards hated DMA, remember, AE did not necessarily dothings the simple way. They would go out of the way to make sure theirsupplied software would not work with any other hardware. (Not such a badidea..) but when it gets to your hardware only working with your otherhardware it's time to stop that practice. :)I have never had to disable DMA simply because I have more than 4MB pluggedinto the memory slot. The original Sirius RAM (4+4 R8) has a problem withDMA and Transwarps that did not exist with the prototype cards. In tryingto eliminate jumpers completely and allow for any number of SIMMs, 1 to 8,not just the traditional steps of 1,2,4-8, I used a whole 'complicated'mess of boolean logic. Never again. :) It became evident that in somesystems that card was Plug 'n Pray (that the boolean) logic would work.The CV Tech method of DMA is what I call Force Feed DMA. It's called Hey!,here it comes and you better not miss! :)Now take a look at a Focus drive with 16 bit driver installed, damn neargives that RAMFast & DMA a run for it's money. In some cases Focusstatistics beat the RAMFast. This all depends on the drive attached to theFocus card, but even so, no controller cache, and it's pretty speedy. Thedown side, it's IDE, 1 drive, no chain, not easy to swap, but you simplytake the whole drive with you and pop it in a system where your going.Tony                        (T_DIAZ, 19952, GO COM A2)WHAT'S OLD IS NEW--HOW TO GET A NEW GENIE ACCOUNT   I have indeed been"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   investigating yourquestions and have trying to come up with an all-inclusive, accurate answerfor you.

Please note that the DeskJet 710, 712,   720, 722 820 and 1000 series are Windows-only printers and will not work   on the IIGS.   3) 24-pin dot-matrix printers and inkjets that emulate Epson LQ   printers, including models manufactured by Epson, NEC, Panasonic, and   many others.   Additionally, Harmonie also includes greatly improved GS/OS drivers   for the ImageWriter II and ImageWriter LQ dot-matrix printers, and for   Apple's original StyleWriter I printer.   Harmonie also provides driver support for several Parallel Interface   Cards including the Grappler Plus, ProGrappler, AE Parallel Pro, Epson   APL, FingerPrint G, II Print and the Marcey Parallel card. Harmonie   also includes a special serial Port Driver that enables printers that   have a serial interface to be used with Harmonie (Note: Most HP   printers manufactured in the last few years include only a Parallel   interface; some older DeskJets included only a serial interface.).   Harmonie works with all standard IIGS programs that use the IIGS Print   Manager, such as AppleWorks GS, Platinum Paint, HyperCard IIGS, and   Quick Click Calc; the most notable exception of programs that do not   work with the Harmonie drivers is The Print Shop GS. Aside from The   Print Shop GS, Harmonie should work just fine with all of your GS/OS   based software.   Harmonie allows you to take full advantage of high quality printers,   up to a certain point. On HP laser printers, Harmonie will output data   to the printed page at a maximum of 300 dots per inch resolution, even   on laser printers that are capable of printing at higher resolutions.   On DeskJet printers, Harmonie is limited to printing in color at 300   dots per inch, and at 600 x 300 dots per inch resolution in black and   white. Despite those limitations, tens of thousands of Apple IIGS   owners who purchased Vitesse's Harmonie are thrilled with the high   quality output that they can achieve at 300 dots per inch or at 600 x   300 dots per inch.   Harmonie is, in essence, an extension to the GS/OS Operating System.   Once the Harmonie drivers are installed and you've gotten used to   having a high quality ink jet or laser printer connected to your IIGS,   you'll soon come to think of Harmonie as such an integral component of   GS/OS that you'll be printing to those high quality printers with nary   a second thought and with all of the ease of use you now associate   with the ImageWriter. In other words, thanks to Harmonie, printing on   laser and ink jet printers is simply a matter of "plug and print."   Vitesse has been selling the Harmonie package of printer drivers for   $29.95, and Shareware Solutions II is very pleased to be able to lower   the price to $20, which includes postage to anywhere in the world.   Because Vitesse's activities in the Apple II world have been   decreasing for the past year or two, the v2.11 update was never really   promoted, and many current owners of Vitesse's Harmonie have   absolutely no idea that Harmonie had ever been updated to support 600   x 300 dpi printing. For that reason, Shareware Solutions II would like   to extend a low cost update offer to those of you who have older   versions of Vitesse's Harmonie. The cost of the update is $7, but in   order to qualify for that lower cost update, you must return your   original Harmonie disk for verification (it will be returned to you)   or submit a copy of your Vitesse receipt.   To order Harmonie, send checks or money orders to:                          Joe Kohn                          Shareware Solutions II                          166 Alpine St                          San Rafael, CA 94901                       (JOE_KOHN, 19186, GO COM A2)<<<<<   Q: What are some of the benefits of being a subscriber to Shareware"""""   Solutions II?A: The exclusive software available from Shareware Solutions II.

Those who have not seen the IIgs in operation on aPower Mac will be amazed at what this emulator accomplishes. It's almost asif the Bernie Boys =have= created an entire new platform because of the wayit brings our old programs to life.I have been using SIS in Bernie a lot in recent days, and the enhancedperformance of the web browser is incredible. The display is crisp and easyto read, and those scripts really rip at the higher processing speed.Likewise, COG's performance is greatly enhanced, if you can imagine that.COG already runs pretty fast on a power GS.I am seriously considering creating the next issue of Juiced.GS via Bernieand GW III 2.1, just to see how it goes.

If they have, gsAIM sends a message to the AIM server that says"my user is idle, tell their friends that they're idle." This causes theicon next to that user's name to change to a little clock on all the onlineAIM users that have you in their buddy lists.Another use would be this: you're an FTP program, running as an NDA. To benice to the user, your RunAction is scheduled to occur only 5 times persecond. But this limits your file transfer rate somewhat. You could watchIdleTime to see if the user has been idle for five minutes. Once theybecome idle, you change your RunAction time so it gets called 30 times persecond, so you can do your networking stuff more often.Or you could have a telnet NDA that automatically logs the user off ifthey've been idle for more than 30 minutes.These are just a few Internet-related examples. You could use it fornon-Internet type stuff. For instance, you write a file backup INIT or DA,and use IdleTime to watch for the user being idle for an hour, thenautomatically start a backup at that point.There are lots of uses for it. :)Eric "Sheppy" ShepherdMacintosh & PowerPC Programmers Forum                       (SHEPPY, 2431, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Think of it as providing the functionality of the Spectrum script"""""   command 'Set IdleTimer' at a system level, to any application thatrequires it ... Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Sun 24 Jan 1999 - 178 days till KFest '99 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.2 & Crock O' Gold 2.6 Bernie ][ the Rescue 2.0 woofing on a PowerMac 8200/120 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                       (EWANNOP, 2434, GO COM A2PRO)DOMODALWINDOW MAYHEM   I have code that started crashing under very""""""""""""""""""""   specific circumstances yesterday.

This wasan outline font (as opposed to bitmapped font) format which allowed smoothscaling of fonts no matter what size was requested.  While Apple itself didnot build this technology into the IIgs System Software, our friends atWestcode Software created the wondrous Control Panel _Pointless_ whichbrought TrueType fonts to the Apple IIgs.  Simply use _Pointless_ onTrueType fonts developed for the Macintosh and you suddenly have beautiful,smoothly rendered fonts on your IIgs.     Over time, however, more and more TrueType fonts have become availableon the Windows platform than have been on the Mac, and there was nostraight forward way of using these fonts on the IIgs.  While both theWindows and Mac fonts are TrueType, there are differences in how the datathat make up the fonts are stored, and _Pointless_ only knows how to dealwith the Macintosh version TrueType.  While there are several Macintoshproducts that can do the font conversion, for the Mac-less among us, whatto do, what to do?     Lysergic Software comes to the rescue with _FontPimp_, their IIgsTrueType font utility.  _FontPimp_ has several features, but it does onething very well--it converts fonts.  It will take a TrueType font ready forthe Windows platform and make it usable with a IIgs running _Pointless_.It opens the door for literally thousands of fonts that were previouslyunavailable on the IIgs to liven up those _AppleWorks GS_ and_GraphicWriter III_ documents.     To test _FontPimp_, I simply spent some time downloading some WindowsTrueType fonts from Delphi's IBM PC & Compatibles Forum Database.  Windowsfiles usually come packed as .zip archives, analogous to the Binary II andNuFX (.bxy) archives that Apple II software is seen in online.  To unzipthe files, I used the shareware _PMPUnZip_.  I then started up _FontPimp_and let it do its thing.     Of the six fonts I downloaded, _FontPimp_ was able to convert three ofthem.  While a 50% success rate is not impressive, this is far from ascientific study, and it's not uncommon to have problems using evenMacintosh TrueTypes on the IIgs.  While the TrueType standard is wellknown, many of the public domain or freeware fonts don't follow it asclosely as it could, resulting in some incompatibilities which show up whenyou try to convert fonts to different platforms.  Others have had moresuccess than I did using _FontPimp_ to convert the fonts, and what fontsdid convert correctly were absolutely stunning.     _FontPimp_ has a somewhat hidden feature as well--it allows you toconvert your IIgs fonts back into the Windows format.  You can do thisusing the Edit command in _FontPimp_'s File pulldown menu, then hitting the"Save TTF" button.  That way you can match up your fonts between your IIgsand, say, the Windows box at work.     There are several other features of _FontPimp_ for use with fonts,many related to such obscure things as a font's ID# and internal name.There is documentation included with _FontPimp_ that explains these optionsat some length.  You may well learn more than you ever wanted to do aboutfonts on the IIgs just by reading the documentation!     So, for those of you who've been looking at the fonts on your office'sWindows machine in envy, wait no longer--you finally have the tool you needin _FontPimp_.  And for those who haven't been suffering this way, you nowhave a whole new world of fonts to choose from.  Have fun with it.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :  WYTYSYDG: What you thought you saw, you didn't get.  :         :                                                       :         ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: LUMITECH ::::::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
