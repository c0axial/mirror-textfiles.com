In Northern Illinois we have a wildflower thatbegins to bloom in late Winter... so we literally have four seasons ofwildflowers.                               Skunk Cabbage                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The time has come for our annual observation of the Skunk Cabbage.  Anafternoon trip to Skare Park is in order.  A half mile hike from theparking lot leads us to a swampy area where abundant moisture and rich soilencourage an abundance of plant growth.     The Skunk Cabbage takes advantage of the fact that other plants havenot yet started growing.  A brown and purple structure, shaped somewhatlike a TePee, has emerged from the cold, wet earth.  Looking through atriangular shaped 'door', we see a bulb-like structure bearing a multitudeof tiny flowers... protected from the cold nights by the outside 'TePee'.     The strong, fetid odor of the plant has attracted flying insects...they are going in and out of the 'door'... visiting the flowers... andensuring pollination.     Before long the Skunk Cabbage will send up green leaves bearing someresemblance to cabbage.  The leaves will produce the food material to bestored in the roots that will insure the blooming cycle to be repeated nextyear.  Then other plants will take their turn in this swampy area, toweringabove the Skunk Cabbage.     You can learn about Skunk Cabbage by reading and study of pictures...but for the full experience you really need to see it yourself.                         The KansasFest Experience                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     You can read about KFest... even see pictures... but for the fullexperience you need to be there yourself.

You need to be able to setthe SCSI ID for the device.In terms of an adaptor, do you have space in your enclosure to add anadaptor?  You also have to make sure that the height of a new drive willfit inside your enclosure.Also, the RamFAST does not support SCSI arbitration (the RamFAST itselfdoes not have SCSI ID).  While apparently this is not an issue for manydrives, there are some which will not operate without it.  Drivemanufacturers assume the host supports arbitration, even if it doesn't everget used--you are not going to find any information if a drive requiresarbitration or not.The RamFAST should be considered a broken product due to the lack of thissupport (I have a RamFAST so I'm allowed to say that :).

Is thiscounter really valid?For the last couple of months I've been watching Silvern Castle v8.2 viewith Hypercard Disk 6 in the site statistics, and while it is heartening tobelieve over 500 people have downloaded my program, I found it hard tobelieve there is really a continuing demand for Hypercard Disk 6 (or SCv8.2for that matter), which really makes me question whether or not thedownload counter means anything.Any syndicomm gurus able to shed some light on the download counter.Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 2, Top 18, Msg 37)>>>>>"""""As far as I know, that counter is legitimate.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 2, Top 18, Msg 38)>>>>>"""""Perhaps google, yahoo, and other spiders are skewing the results?Kelvin(KWS, Cat 2, Top 18, Msg 39)>>>>>"""""That's possible; spiders could certainly do that.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 2, Top 18, Msg 40)[EOA][TDM]Testers Needed For DiskMaker 8""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Last June I decided to do an 8-bit version of Sheppy's DiskMaker program.Sheppy's DiskMaker is a GSOS application for making disks from disk imagesthat are widely available over the Internet.  It has an easy to useinterface that supports a wide variety of image formats.  My objective isto bring as many of DiskMaker's features over to the 8-bit world includingan optional mouse driven interface as DiskMaker 8.Since that time I've been working slowly but steadily releasing twodevelopers prototypes to Sheppy for his approval.  Now I'm at the pointwhere I have implemented most of the features and need a small group oftesters.If you would like to help me out, send an e-mail to mark@syndicomm.com andI'll send you DiskMaker 8 v1.0d3.  There are only two small features yet tobe implemented but otherwise is pretty much ready for beta.Known Bugs:- Selecting the "Open" button while sitting in an empty directory resultsin a long series of MLI error messages being displayed.
