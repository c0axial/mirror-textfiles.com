Using Slackware 7.1 with kernel2.2.19.I believe this is the version of KEGS that should be used with theKEGSethernetPatch.tar file available from A2Central.com. TheREADME.ethernet file doesn't mention the KEGS version. I have applied thepatches as indicated in the TAR file.But it doesn't seem to be working.I have run into the following problems and have some questions for someone(Geoff?) who maybe has this working.1. Has anyone besides Geoff got this working with KEGS?2. Is 0.86 the correct version of KEGS to use? What version of Linux wasused to create the KEGSethernet patches?3. What version of libpcap and libnet was used? I used version 1.1 oflibnet and version 0.8.3 of libpcap downloaded from the sites in theREADME.ethernet file.4. I had to also make the following modifications before it would compilecorrectly:a. sim65816.c has a call to "ethernet_update();", but that function isn'tdefined in ethernet.c. I changed it to "ethernet_transmit();". That makesme wonder if the patch tar file has the correct ethernet.c source.b. I had to add the following to the vars file in addition to thosementioned it the README.ethernet file because "pcap" was installed in/usr/local otherwise I got errors about pcap_if_t being undefined:OPTS = -DKEGS_LITTLE_ENDIAN -DETHERNET -D_THREAD_SAFE-I/usr/local/includeEXTRA_LIBS = -lXext -L/usr/local/lib -lpcap -L /usr/lib -lnet -pthreadAfter making the above changes, I was able to get KEGS to compile. I have aLanceGS in my regular GS, so I used the routing LANceGS.DRIVER from thedisk for the LanceGS and patched it with the LANCEPATCH1.SHK also availablefrom A2Central.com as described in the README.ethernet.KEGS runs everything else normally, but when I try to actually useMarinetti to telnet to something using the telnet application that camewith Marinetti 3.0b1.I configured the LANceGS Ethernet to have a Primary Domain Server of myLinux box, 192.168.1.3, on my local office network. And when I "connect tonetwork" from the TCP/IP Control Panel, it appears to connect OK, as I getno errors and then the "disconnect from network" button is active. But whenI try to telnet to syndicomm.com, it hangs KEGS. I tried using the IP of myrouter, 192.168.1.1, but when that is used "connect to network" fails.Just seeing if anyone else has used KEGS in this manner and if so what modsfrom Geoff's original documentation did you have to make?I also, tried making the modifications to the latest 0.91 version of KEGS,but the "add_irq" call now takes an argument of the type IRQ_PENDING_xxxxthat is for the handling IRQs in the scc.c logic, I haven't been able todecipher that logic yet, so i just commented out the "add_irq" call and itseems to do the same as for the 0.86 version -- everything but TCPIP works.I wonder if the IRQ logic is complete in ethernet.c as it calls "add_irq",but never calls "remove_irq".Thanks,Gene Linkoskiglinkoski @ tampabay.rr.com(GLEINNEK, Cat 29, Top 31, Msg 58)>>>>>"""""I downloaded the ethernet patches on a system which I have not built KEGSand can confirm that the instructions provided in the KEGSethernetPatch.tararchive do not work.

Compatibility With Modern Source Code"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Orca sucks.  I have found that the GS development tools are severelylacking compatibility with modern source code.  Looking at the amount ofwork to attempt to port something shows that it is more efficient to writenew code instead.  I once had spent several weeks trying to compilejavascript with Orca/C and just gave up since it became obvious that itwill never work.  With so much potential code that can be useful on theIIgs, there has to be way to get it to work.I recently discovered that the GNU development tools have some support forthe 65816 architecture.  This means a set of cross-development programminglanguages can be easily developed, and with a little effort, may be able toport itself directly to the GS.The steps to build a cross-development platform is to build binutils whichinclude the assembler, disassembler, linker, object tools, etc.  Then youcan build the programming language of your choice: i.e gcc, g++, etc.  Thecompiler converts the source into assembly, passes it to the assembler, andpasses it to the linker to generate an executable.Take a look at what has been done with support for the 68HC11, an 8-bitprocessor.  gcc now even generates code for this platform.I was wondering if there is anybody interested to help support the 65816 soit will actually be usable for IIgs applications?  The maintainers ofbinutils have stated that they will drop support for this chipset if nomaintainers come forward.The assembler, called gas (GNU Assembler), works.  There is no support forOMF, GS/OS's executable type.  There has never been an open source linkerfor the GS.  ld, the GNU linker, is already written and supports severallink formats.  It should not be that hard to add OMF support.  And finallygetting gcc support looks very easy.  The 68HC11 is very similar to the65816 from an op-code perspective.  One can base much from this existingcode.I'll accept the challenge for adding the 65816 support for gcc, but thiscan't be started until there is a working linker.Here are some of the tasks which would be needed to complete this:- OMF support in ld (linker)- static library support (unknown?  This may just work or may require alevel of  effort)- add the GS toolbox macros to gas (assembler) (a simple perl script couldbe written to convert an existing GS macro file to a format used by gas)- add the GS toolbox includes- port common libraries- add gcc support- add the GS toolbox macros to gcc (a simple perl script could be writtento  convert an existing GS macro file to a format used by gas)- probably more which I can't think of right now.It would be so cool to have an open source development platform for the GS.And by using the same tools as the rest of the open source community, thereis a zero learning curve.Send me an email or post here if you have interest in this development.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 58, Top 2, Msg 4)>>>>>"""""Geoff,Sounds great, but I'm not up to giving much but moral support.If there is a better development system, though, I can guarantee I'll useit.RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 58, Top 2, Msg 5)>>>>>"""""I'd love to see this happen, and would be willing to pitch in, but my timeis pretty constrained these days.

Make the assumption that the word size is 32-bits.This adds overhead to the code, but ensures greater compatibility.  Thecurrent code in binutils assumes the word size is 16-bits.  So a possiblesolution can be to add another a new parameter such as "word32bit" to forcean assumptions to use 2-bit words.  This would put the onus on the porteror developer to understand the different memory models.  It seems morestraightforward to force a 32-bit word assumption and just deal with theextra instructions that get generated.memory won't be an issue for most things.  The GS is a single-task computerso you aren't needing to run multiple things at the same time.  Apps thatrequire tons of memory will probably run too slowly to be useful anyway.As long as you don't actually use the stack to pass parameters--just apointer in  memory to where the parameters are stored, you save a lot ofpotential stack usage--three bytes for the return address and three bytesfor the pointer to the parameter block.  This does add overhead which don'toccur with other processors.Again, 64k function limit can be worked around as well.  Assume longaddressing and long jump (no branching) and functions can be as big as youwant.  Special care will be needed at bank crossing to add a jumpinstruction from one bank to the next.As I said before, you don't get efficient code, but with GS emulatorsrunning at 100+ MHz with 14 megs of RAM, there is a lot of potential to seenew software available for the GS that just wasn't capable before.  Theadded benefit is that some things will work on real hardware in areasonable manner as well.The 65816 was not designed to handle C development--it is very hideous whenattempting to design a C compiler for it--there are a lot of compromisesone has to make.  But 65816 assembly is a dying art so an alternative needsto be made available to ensure any future.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 58, Top 2, Msg 13)[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KF6]------------------------------                       KFest 2006 |-----------------------------------[KFS]KansasFest 2006"""""""""""""""is scheduled for July 18th-23rd, 2006Mark your calendar... start saving some money.  :)[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
