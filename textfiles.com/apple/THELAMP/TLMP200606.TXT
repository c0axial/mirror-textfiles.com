This was goingto be a great day for a day trip.  We were going to the White Pines DinnerTheater... the program was "Jukebox Memories, Songs of the 40's and 50's".Since this time period included courtship, marriage, and the birth of ason, this day promised to be bathed in nostalgia for my wife and I.     We left early to allow time to take a less traveled route along theEast bank of the Rock River.  The scenery was enhanced  by the white cottonclouds drifting slowly across the deep blue sky.     We arrived at White Pines State Park an hour early... allowing timefor a walk in the woods before the noon dinner.  The wildflowers wereglorious, especially the lavender blooming wild geraniums.     The buildings housing the restaurant, dinner theater, gift shop, andguest cabins were built by the Civilian Conservation Corp in the 30's.  Therustic log cabin style blends well with nature.     The buffet dinner was delicious.  The laid back atmosphere with guestsseated at tables of eight encouraged people to become acquainted with thestrangers seated at the same table.     The program lived up to our expectations.     The dessert, a delicious raspberry cobbler, was served during theintermission.                            Apple II Nostalgia                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Interested in a Rendezvous with Apple II Nostalgia?

The Scheduler makes sure the routine iscalled at a safe time to do whatever you might need to do.The Toolbox makes pretty extensive use of it.The problem is that only four tasks can be registered as pending at a time,and it's possible to try to add a task and not have enough room for it.That can be a big problem if some major situation needs to be scheduled tobe handled.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 56, Top 7, Msg 3)[EOA][A2C]The Guy With the Apple II Car"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Last night I went contra dancing, and a woman I'd seen at several suchevents introduced me to another dancer who went to the same college as me.My jaw hit the ground when he introduced himself by name: it was the guywith the Apple II car!!Finally, I meet the man I wrote about in Messages 122-125 uptopic as wellas in an issue of Juiced.GS last year.

Here, as usual, are the rules:KansasFest 2006HackFest Rules1. Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 19, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 23 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.  However, entries may be described or discussed, includingscreen shots (where applicable), by the KFest committee for promotionalpurposes, or by legitimate Apple II community press.The following lists are not necessarily complete lists of everythingallowed; these are to be taken as "givens."  If it's not on the list,please ask for confirmation.Acceptable software:     System software     Development environment (no customizations)     GSBug     Nifty List     Marinetti     Exerciser     ORCA/Debugger, Splat!     DesignMaster, Foundation, Genesys, ResLin     Talking Tools     Spectrum, ProTERM, ANSITermAcceptable hardware:     Apple II computer, monitor, disk drives, hard drives     CD-ROM drive, tape drive     Hard disk controller card     Sound card (speakers/headphones/etc)     Accelerator card (any speed)     RAM cardAccepted reference material:     All official Apple reference materials (including manuals, technical          notes, and file type notes).     Reference manuals included with development tools and software.     Commercially-available reference manuals.Any other hardware, software, or reference material needs the approval ofthe judges in advance.

Past guest speakers have included Apple II inventor  StephenWozniak and Syndicomm founder Gary Utter.    KansasFest, the only computer conference dedicated to the Apple  IIcomputer, returns this year to Rockhurst University in  Kansas City,Missouri.  Last year's convention saw the successful  launch of KansasFeston a campus that brought with it the  continuation of old traditions andthe launch of many new ones,  including the Discathalon, which are sure toreturn this year.   Shepherd kicks off the event with his keynote speech,followed by an  official reception.    The following days will consist of official events includinginformational sessions, the KFest Kookout, the HackFest programmingchallenge, and more.  Friday night will feature a catered dinner  duringwhich a retrospective of KansasFest pasts will be presented,  before theconvention officially concludes the following day with the  annual VendorFair, at which attendees buy, sell, and trade new and  used hardware andsoftware.  This year's vendors will be making  available the wares ofSyndicomm, The ByteWorks, Nibble Magazine, and  more.KansasFest 2006 is set for Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Missouri,from July 18th through July 23rd. Registration information is availableonline at <http://www.kfest.org> or by calling InTrec Software, KFest'sofficial sponsor, at (602) 992-1345. Registration payments are beingaccepted online via PayPal, providing attendees with the most paymentchoices and convenience possible.    KansasFest, the Apple II summer gathering also known as KFest,  wasoriginally hosted by Resource Central, has been brought to you by  theKFest Committee since 1995.  Each year is like no other.

Past sessions have included hardware and softwaredemonstrations, tutorials, integration of the Apple with other devices(Macs, scanners), Internet tips and tricks, or related subjects that wouldbe of interest to Apple II/Mac users.The attendees of KansasFest are the event's heart and soul.  Give ussomething worth rolling out of bed for each morning!with thanks,AndyJunior KFest Schedulemeisterawmolloy@landsnail.com[EOA][PSN]Presenters and Sessions Needed for KFest""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""From a2fan@hotmail.com Mon Jun  5 15:22:34 2006Date: Mon, 05 Jun 2006 15:18:55 -0500From: Sean Fahey <a2fan@hotmail.com>Reply-To: kfest@lists.gno.orgTo: kfest@lists.gno.orgSubject: [kfest] Sessions/Presenters NeededTime is ticking away and we are in need of presenters and sessions forKFest.NOW is YOUR OPPORTUNITY to dazzle your fellow KFest attendees with ademonstration of your technical acumen and geek prowess.
