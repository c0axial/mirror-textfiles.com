An important lesson for all of usto learn, whether we're proud or ashamed of our origins.  It can inspire usand uplift us, whether we accomplish what we can out of not wanting to goback or making the old folk back home proud.     I started online on Genie.     It was nearly two years ago that I gave up the fight myself.  GEniehad become Genie, the most expensive service of its kind in the world, andDelphi had become a viable alternative for Apple II support.  Genie was nolonger unchallenged as the home of the best online Apple II support in theuniverse.  More and more Genie users left--many for Delphi, some for theunknown.  It was time for a change.  _GenieLamp A2_ was no more, andshortly thereafter, _The Lamp!_ rose from its ashes, with its new home onDelphi.     Not all of our friends followed, however.  Our Apple II brothers andsisters on Genie were a hardy bunch, and many steadfastly dug in, refusingto leave Genie.     They may not have counted on Genie leaving them.     I write this on May 10, 1999.  It's been about three weeks since theA2 RoundTable on Genie became inaccessible to both the staff and members ofGenie.  Not only was Genie's A2 one of the most popular places for Apple IIsupport anywhere, it was also among the busiest of Genie's RoundTables.You would think that fixing a problem with your fattest cash cow would benumber one on their list of priorities.     If it is, they're sure not acting like it.     I'm not declaring Genie dead--in fact, it's survived a lot longer thanI ever expected it to.  But if Genie's A2 has been inaccessible this longwithout it being repaired, it may be the final blow.  At the very least,they're certainly in dire straits.     So I make the plea again, to our old friends on Genie: come home toDelphi.     It may not be where you're from, but it'll be where you're at.                                [*] [*] [*]     Excuse Me Department: What you'll read about as a major Delphi "burp"in this issue was a strange occurrence that resulted in several hundredduplicate messages in the A2 Forum (among others).  Things could've beenworse, I guess--we didn't see mass deletion of messages, for instance,which would've been a disaster.     What fell somewhere between a disaster and an annoyance was editingthe messages in the A2 Forum for use in this issue of _The Lamp!_.  Myapologies for the tardiness of this issue.                                [*] [*] [*]     There's A New Club In Town Department: KansasFest 1999 is on for July1999, on the campus of Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.

But it might   as well be:2) Only 12 Partitions per device. 12*32MB = 384MB in ProDOS Partitions.   One could use HFS, but when, not if, it crashes you'll wish you hadn't.   :)You can create up to 12 partitions per drive, and using the utilities,select and deselect them at boot time for a total of 12 active.You can not use more than 1 RAMFast per computer. The drivers do notsupport looking for an additional card, when they find one, that is thecard. This is both a driver and internal firmware limitation of theRAMFast.IE: You boot a RAMFast in slot 2, hold down the keypad zero to enter theutilities and it will find the card in slot 7. (Or the other way around, Iforget which direction it scans)These limitations are a result of shortcuts during development:"No one will have two of these... (probably thinking, they, and the harddisks are too expensive.. )""I don't want to write code to scroll the partition list in the utilities."(Which may have meant only supporting 14 devices at the time because theRAMFast physically mapped it's partitions to a slot prior to ProDOS 8 1.9and  support for more than just 2 or 4 hard disk partitions.Later version of ProDOS 8 phantom slotted starting at slot 1 and working upuntil either every slot/drive that was available was mapped or it ran outof partitions.In effect, Extended SmartPort operation like GS/OS supported was brought tothe ProDOS 8 environment. Physical slot assignments by the RAMFast was nolonger needed and if you are still using it you should actually turn it alloff. Unmap the partitions, leaving just Slot 7 D1 and D2 mapped. Orwhatever slot your RAMFast resides in. D2 is not even needed but it's nothurting anything.Tony                        (T_DIAZ, 21895, GO COM A2)>>>>>   It's easy to criticize now, but when a 1 gig drive cost over $2K,"""""   it was a hell of a lot more reasonable.

When this is suspectedit can often be dealt with by enclosing the supply in a piece of draftingmylar that has had aluminum foil glued to it's outer surface. Make thisinto a "tunnel" that wraps around the supply, but be CERTAIN that yourmodification still allows for proper airflow for cooling or the new supplyWILL FAIL QUICKLY-HaroldHdwrNut on EFNet and AIMPosted by ProTERM Mac MessengerThe most damaging phrase in the language is: "It's always been done thatway."                       (HAROLD_H, 22130, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Not necessarily 'cheap', but definitely under loaded. Think of it"""""   as those times when you go up (or down) stairs blindly, perhapsyour carrying something and you can't see down or whatever, and you get tothe top and your still going up but the steps are done. Your foot goes up,and then wham, onto the floor and you nearly fall over if you did it'right'.The power supply is designed for a PC, and in fact there are some that willNOT work unless attached to a motherboard. Others will, but since all thevoltages are not being used, they are 'climbing stairs' that are not there.Pushing a lawn mower as if it were going up a hill when in fact there isdown hill and no grass. Two hard disks are nothing, the P/S is expecting amotherboard filled with cards using 4 different voltages. The hard diskuses two of them. So unless you have a lot of hard disks, that power supplyis under loaded and could, not will, could die at a moments notice.Apple used two vendors for power supplies for the IIgs, Astec and Dynacomp.the Dynacomp, (Richardson, TX) supplies at first were failing due to underloading. A typical IIgs system had the 1MB RAM card and the floppy drive.So the power supply was not loaded enough. They had a rash of failures andfigured out it was underloading and had to replace them all.

The same as the"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   "sleep problem"that others have mentioned. Zip drives go into sleep mode when the disk hasnot been accessed for a certain amount of time (I think the default is 15minutes), causing the Zip disk to stop rotating. With an Apple SCSI card,this causes the volumes on a sleeping Zip to sometimes not be recognizedwhen you go to access the disk again, as the standard driver does not waitlong enough for the disk to spin back up. I'm not sure if the same thinghappens with a RamFast.I also find that when I don't have a disk in the Zip drive, Finder windowssometimes don't draw initially (though they update fine when I scroll) andvolume listings in Standard File dialogs rapidly refresh themselves, makingit difficult to select things. Not a big deal once you get used to it, butit scared me at first -- I thought something was really wrong with mymachine when all my Finder windows kept opening up blank!Others have mentioned that the Tulin floptical driver solves both theseproblems, and I've been meaning to get it for ages, but I haven't beenusing my real GS much lately, so it hasn't been a priority. Like I said, Ijust got used to the little quirks and tried to be careful about notletting the drive go to sleep. I haven't had any significant problems,though.-- Michael                          (SAR, 22670, GO COM A2)THIS PART DELPHI PLANNED   *** NOTICE ***""""""""""""""""""""""""Delphi will be down Easter Sunday beginning 08:00 EDT for about an hourwhile the Delphi clock is reset for Daylight Saving time.Don't forget to reset your own clocks if you live in a time zone thatswitches to Daylight Saving Time. :)ChuckCHunk_S --- Your A2 Forum HostDelivered by OLRight!

Goto the Chooser and select the printer. Then leave it alone. :)The Gatorbox CS is by far the best, (slim plastic tower, with a 'hole'under it between it and the base) this one is completely self sufficientand is compatible with every method and use of AppleTalk that I have everthrown at it. Works every time.There are other devices available such as AsanteTalk, Dayna Etherprint,Webster CC LT/Bridge and a few other less known such as FarallonEtherbridge.The IIgs can print with any of these devices, but will lock up ruthlesslywhen Appleshare is accessed. It will even lock the Mac up if you are doingjust the right thing. :)IIgs compatible choices, hardware wise are Farallon's EtherWave and theGatorbox CS, there are a few others but I can't think of the names right atthe moment. the Farallon EtherWave may exhibit a problem in that you willhave to cycle the power to the unit after a reboot. The EtherWave is for asingle computer solution, and each computer would require it's ownEtherWave. the Gatorbox and other likewise devices are for the entirenetwork. However an additional note on these devices, such as the DaynaEtherprint, they will only route up to 2 or three, depending on firmware,LocalTalk devices to an Ethernet network. You need to have the 'Plus' modelto get up to 8 devices on the LocalTalk side seeable by the Ethernet side.The Etherprint will seek out and zero in on a printer first if it isinstalled on the network with several other devices but the typicalinstallation is the Etherprint plugged into the hub and the printer pluggedinto it with nothing else on the LocalTalk side. This is the leastproblematic use. You can have up to 2 (or 3) IIgs, Mac Plus, SE, etccomputers w/o Ethernet on the LocalTalk side of these devices to access aprinter on the Ethernet side of the network, but the AppleShare servicesstill are a problem. I have been working with these on and off, but thelatter part of the beginning of the year was dedicated to a whole mess ofthings I just had to get done, and have not had much time to do anythingelse.I have about 10 different hardware bridges, FastPath 4 and 5, Dayna,Asante, Webster CC, Farallon, and a few others, everything does printers,one or two of them work with genuine AppleShare servers but not with System7 filesharing.The whole thing is Networking Voodoo at it's best. Closely related to 'SCSIVoodoo', but even worse. :)I hope to, by KFest, have a whole mess of this worked out and possibly do asession on this, but that wont be my main session, what that is, I don'tknow yet, last years was really well received and it was planned on a whim,a very last minute thing.

Article #30959, "Macintosh Floppy Drives: Creating AppleIIGS Start Up Floppy Disks Issue".This article discusses problems using DiskCopy on the Mac to createfloppies of the System 6.0.1 disk images. In particular, manual-insert Macfloppy drives are known to often produce unusable floppies. These drivesare the kind that don't grab the disk and suck it in when the disk ishalf-inserted. You can usually tell you have one of these drives: ifthere's an indentation into which your fingers can go to push the disk allthe way into the drive, it's probably manual insert. Likewise,manual-insert drives often have a flap to keep dust out of the drive.Apple recommends using an older Mac to create the disks (contact a localApple service provider for help finding one to use).If one isn't available, they suggest transferring the files to a IIgs overa network and using ShrinkIt 1.1 to make the disks. ShrinkIt 1.1 can befound at {<http://asu.info.apple.com> http://asu.info.apple.com.} The AppleIIgs disk images can be found at{<http://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n10078>http://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n10078.}Eric (Sheppy) Shepherd {<mailto:sheppy@sheppyware.net> sheppy@sheppyware.net} {<http://www.sheppyware.net> http://www.sheppyware.net}                        (SHEPPY, 22159, GO COM A2)>>>>>   It should be noted that 1.4 meg high density disks work fine"""""   between these manual insert drives and a IIgs with a high densitydrive.

Article #30959, "Macintosh"""""   Floppy Drives: Creating Apple IIGS Start Up Floppy Disks Issue".What's particularly amusing is that a lot of us have known about this forquite some time, and I never myself, inquired to Apple about it, figuringthey would just blow it off to user error.They addressed the issue, but it's not just an Apple II image problem, it's800K disk images in general.Up until the point of manual insert drives, Sony was the drive supplier forApple 3.5" drives. Budget stalemates and competition forced Apple to lookin other directions for drive sources. Since the dominant force is the PCmarket, all the drives in the marketplace are designed for MFM,(720K/1.44MB, 1/2MB 'unformatted'). These drives had to be modified tosupport Apple's own proprietary GCR format. 143K/400K/800K are all GCR. TheSony drives were designed with GCR in mind, the heads, mainly.If some of you may recall the "HFS Interchange Format" that was introducedaround System 7 Pro, System 7.1.2, just about the time the first PowerMac'sshipped. This was also about the same time as Apple was making a change touse other vendors drives. After no very long, HFS Interchange Format (a720K HFS volume) disappeared nearly as fast as it appeared. A systemrelease later, it was gone. To much, too fast, much more complicated thanthey envisioned to phase out the 800K, and GCR format all together.The drives just do not write GCR exactly the way the others do.Maybe it's all by the book, done per spec, but you know that, that doesn'tnecessarily mean it will work. Case in point, the BASIS 108, German AppleII+ clone was cloned by the book, it was 101% compatible. So much in thatthings did not work. The Franklin Ace 1000, the same way. The neat thingabout the Apple ][ design was that a lot of it was un-intentional,characteristics of using circuits in ways never thought of when they weredesigned. Double Hires is the best example, and most common. GCR isanother. Since only one vendor made the hardware it always worked.This problem (disks created by one not read by another) also existed in asmaller degree with the AppleDisk 3.5" and the UniDisk 3.5". That was moreof an interleave issue, and a ProDOS 'patience' thing. ProDOS would give upto easy, if the data it was 'waiting' for did not come in time.If you have a disk that does not read on the IIgs, format it first on theIIgs, write the disk image to the disk after the disk has been formattedonce.Or if you are moving files to a IIgs from a Mac, make your transit disk anHFS disk, again, format the disk on the IIgs if you have to.You should not write to ProDOS disks with a Mac, as *any* file will nowhave a resource fork, EVEN IF IT DID NOT WHILE IT WAS ON THE MAC VOLUME.Yes, you download a Shrinkit file on the Mac, unshrink it with Shrink II,then write the files to a ProDOS disk, they now have a resource fork. Ifthese were ProDOS 8 files, they are no longer usable. If they were GS/OSfiles, it's not as big of an issue, except that if the file did not have aresource fork to begin with, now it does and you just lessened the mobilityof that file because now it can not be copied with a ProDOS 8 utility. Notthat, that should be a big problem, those with more experience can and douse the P8 environment to move things around too, as they know what doesand does not have a resource fork.MacOS will NOT add resource forks to ProDOS files (non-resource forkedfiles) just at random, but only when it writes them to ProDOS disks. On MSDOS disks, the Mac writes the file and the resource goes in a folder called"RESOURCE.FRK" ..which means that the files do not get modified.Tony                        (T_DIAZ, 22676, GO COM A2)DELPHI DOT COMMANDS ON THE MESSAGE BOARDS   Uh - the so-called"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   'dot-commands' have been aroundfor a long, long time.If you start a line with a period, Delphi will try to interpret the firstcouple of characters as a dot-command.

The basictrick is to teach Macs to mount them (by letting them initialize the media)and have the II deal with it as the latter seems more flexible in terms ofpartitioning.For a yet unknown reason Ryan gave permission to repost that article on theWoof Woof Web, so in case the December issue of the Lamp is sitting on aZip you are unable to access, you'll find a copy in the dog's supportsection.Henrik Woof Gudat                        (GUDATH, 22270, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Actually, I was able to make a Zip with multiple ProDOS partitions"""""   that all mounted on the Mac.

This waswith an Apple HS SCSI card; I don't know if it would work the same with aRamFast.The trick, I found, was =not= to erase or format the partitions on the GS.Doing that first always resulted in a disk that was unreadable by the Mac.But for some reason, the volume copies worked. (You can safely trash allthe files after copying if you wanted a blank volume.) I think it had to dowith the type of the partition not being changed from HFS to ProDOS in thepartition map. I don't know if the disks are safe to use in this form, butit worked for transferring volumes over to make disk images for Bernie.

Quite frankly, we'relucky that ProDOS could be hacked to support lower case letters.Using a newly designed unix-ish filesystem would be much better (because ofthe simplicity and they're known to work). Adding a boot block is rathertrivial. The real problem is understanding the intricate details of how anFST works. Having a disassembly  of GS/OS and the ProDOS FST would help,but without insider knowledge from (ex)Apple employees, a new FST isprobably a pipe dream.                          (KWS, 22705, GO COM A2)>>>>>   This discussion is probably best moved to A2Pro, however....I'm"""""   never one to ignore a good topic. :-)Obviously there are some reasons for updating the ProDOS filing structureto support larger hard drives, but the project would have to be done forthe love of it, because I think most people would be using HFS, which isgood enough for most uses on an Apple IIgs.As for the actual implementation, reverse engineering the FST is not theway to go about it. The first step is sitting down in front of a hard copyof the ProDOS file structure, and designing on paper the new architecture.Once this is complete, you would move on to working out how to implementthe changes, whether that me by modifying the FST or whatever.Any project which starts by disassembling the FST is fooling itself intothinking it is redesigning ProDOS when in reality it is a project toreverse engineer the FSTs.

I'm making an""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   unusual specialoffer:RSA, the company that provides the standard security encryption protocolused most frequently on the Internet, is sponsoring a contest, known as theRC5 cracking contest, to test its protocol. This contest is participated inby downloading a piece of software that attempts to break the code.Participants download the software, install it, and run it. It receivesassignments from a central computer, and works on crunching that data. Whenit's done, it sends its results back to the central computer and obtainsanother block to work on.To make things more interesting, teams have been established to add to thefun and competitiveness. The team that cracks the code wins a cash prize,and the individual that cracks the code gets a $1000 cash prize. You canread specific information about this at {<http://www.distributed.net>http://www.distributed.net.} Teams are ranked against each other, and everynight you can see the latest rankings.I have my own team (Team SheppyWare), which has a few membersparticipating. You can see my team's current score at{<http://rc5stats.distributed.net /tmsummary.idc?TM=4034>http://rc5stats.distributed.net/tmsummary.idc?TM=4034.}We've done pretty well so far, advancing to about 785th place (out of some6,000 teams), but we've finally hit a brick wall. We don't have enoughparticipants to gain in the rankings. So that brings me to the specialoffer:Join my RC5 team, and you could win free SheppyWare for life ("SheppyWare"is defined as freeware or shareware products released by Eric Shepherd forany platform, and any commercial software released for the Apple II or IIgscomputer by Eric Shepherd; this does not imply that you'll receive refundsfor products already purchased (you won't), and I reserve the right tocancel the free software if I go bankrupt or something unpleasant likethat).The three participants in Team SheppyWare (not including members of my testteam, who aren't eligible) that have the highest number of contributedblocks when the contest ends (in other words, when it's announced by RSAthat the code has been broken) will receive the free SheppyWare for life.The steps involved in joining my team are:1. Go to {<http://rc5.distributed.net> http://rc5.distributed.net} and   download the client software for your computer. You'll need a PC, Mac,   or the like (there's no Apple II software).2. Install and configure the software. Be sure to set your email address.3. Run the software.4. Once you've submitted your first batch of blocks, you can join my team.   Go to the Team SheppyWare status link listed above   (http://rc5stats.distributed.net/tmsummary.idc?TM=4034) and then use the   "Participant Search" at the top of the page to find yourself; enter your   email address and click Search.

The hardwaresupport isn't there for double-buffering.As a result, you basically have to use other techniques for animating.These center around reducing the amount of information you actually change,changing it as fast as possible, and timing the changes with the verticalblanking interrupt to reduce or eliminate tearing.There are some pretty good FAQs floating around. If you're interested, someof the graphics folks can doubtless point you to them. My specialty wasn'tgraphics, though. :)Mike Westerfield                       (BYTEWORKS, 2566, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Well, the IIgs does have a double buffer of sorts.

Render the ceiling.4. Render the sprites.Then shadowing is turned on, and a PEI-slamming function (different onesdepending on the screen size setting) is used to copy the screen memoryonto itself. This makes the updated screen visible.Then the score panel is updated. Finally, shadowing is disabled again.This gets pretty good speed. The lowest levels of the rendering are alldone in assembly, but the preparatory work is in C.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                       (SHEPPY, 2578, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Actually, using the shadow register acts pretty much the same as"""""   using text screens or high-res screens pages 1 and 2.

DrawString uses"""""   Pascal strings which have a length byte followed by the text of thestring.Your example program would work if you change the DrawString macro to aDrawCString.If DrawString is going to be used, the string must be preceded by a lengthbyte so your program would look like this:      ph2 theNumber ; the number to convert      ph4 #theString ; where to store it      ph2 #5 ; length of the buffer ( 6 if signed)      ph2 #0 ; or 1 if it is a signed integer      _Int2Dec      ph4 #theString      _DrawString   ...   theString dc i1'4' ; use a 6 if signed      dc c'xxxxx' ; 6 xs if signedOf course, you could always leave in this line:      dc i1'0' ; NULL terminatedand then you would have you choice of using DrawString or DrawCStringwithout having to modify the theString. :)Oh and the program above could be simplified if using a later version ofOrca/M if you use the newer macro style:      ~Int2Dec theNumber,#theString,#5,#0 ; use #6,#0 if signed      ~DrawString #theString   ...   theString dc i1'4' ; use 6 if signed      dc c'xxxx'                          ; use 6 x's if signed Jeff Blakeney |      Dean of the Apple II University in A2Pro      | --------------+----------------------------------------------------+   sent via    |   HyperCard IIgs Course   |   GSoft BASIC Course   |   COG v3.0    |      now in session       |     now in session     |                      (JBLAKENEY, 2580, GO COM A2PRO)THE IIGS COMPILES SUPER NINTENDO?

The Apple II world has too few top-grade programmers left (I thinkthere are five, maybe seven serious expert-level programmers left) to pullthis off.I believe our efforts would best be spent organizing a letter-writingcampaign to ask Apple to either release the sources to Syndicomm, or makethe System 6.0.1 sources open source.I would participate in such an effort, and would gladly work on updatingthe system using those sources. I will not participate in an attempt toreverse-engineer the FST mechanism as I have enough frustration in my lifealready.---Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                       (SHEPPY, 2600, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   The reason why there is a limitation of 32 Mb is that only two"""""   bytes are allocated for most entries in the directory lists. Tochange this, would mean a restructuring of the entries for all directoryand file lists.This would make the drive structure dependent on a new FST. The drive wouldnot be readable from an Apple //e or a Mac for instance.We already have an HFS FST that handles larger drives, though it is not asefficient as it might be.I think that if any new FST is to be written, it would make more sense toconcentrate on building an HFS+ FST instead. That way you would still havea standard volume that could be interchanged with a Macintosh, but have allthe advantages of a modern disk structure with small block sizes. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Fri 30 Apr 1999 - 82 days till KFest '99 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.2 & Crock O' Gold 3.0 Bernie ][ the Rescue 2.0 woofing at 55Mhz on a G3/350 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                       (EWANNOP, 2601, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Personally, I think the ProDOS naming standard is more of a"""""   limitation than the 32MB partition size.

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.          [thelamp@sheppyware.net]                               The KFest FAQ                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The following article is set up in a form commonly seen on theInternet, called Frequently Asked Questions.  It is designed to answer someof the most common questions people have about KansasFest, the Apple IIevent of the year.  It is not designed to answer general questions aboutthe Apple II, although there may be some overlap.     Any questions about this article can be sent via email tothelamp@delphi.com.Q: What's a FAQ, and how is it pronounced?A: The letters "FAQ" stand for _F_requently _A_sked _Q_uestions.  When   people first hear of or learn of a subject, such as KansasFest, they   often have a number of questions which others before them did when they   also first learned of the same subject.  A FAQ is a document listing   both the questions and answers most frequently associated with new   users, to save themselves (and others trying to assist them) time and   frustration.   And by the way, it's pronounced "fack", nearly identical to "fact".Q: What is the purpose of this FAQ?A: This FAQ is set up to assist people interested in KansasFest, also known   as KFest.  Many Apple II enthusiasts are interested in attending or just   want some information about this event, so the most common questions are   answered here.Q: How can this FAQ be distributed?A: The content of this FAQ is copyright 1999 by Ryan M. Suenaga, the editor   and publisher of _The Lamp!_.  Distribution without the expressed   written consent of the copyright holder is prohibited.Q: What is KFest?A: KansasFest, abbreviated "KFest", is a computing conference held every   summer at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  Its original formal   name was "The Apple II Summer Conference" while its nickname was   "KansasFest", which was abbreviated to "KFest".Q: When was the first KFest held?A: The first KansasFest was held in 1989.  It was originally sponsored by   Resource-Central, the folks who brought you the wonderful _Open-Apple_   and _A2-Central_ (among several other Apple II) publications.  After   Resource-Central became ICON, The Apple II Summer Conference became   ICONference.  This lasted one summer until ICON shut down.  Two   different companies sponsored KFest before Intrec Software, publishers   of _ProTERM_, took over a few years back.  This July will welcome the   11th KFest.Q: When is KFest this year?A: KansasFest 1999 is July 21-25, 1999.  For the first time, KFesters are   being offered an extra night, July 20, at the Avila dorms if they want   to come into town a day early.Q: Where is KFest held?A: KFest is held at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  The address   and phone number are:          Avila College          11901 Wornall Road          Kansas City, Missouri  64145          United States of America          (816) 942-8400Q: If it's held in Missouri, why is it called KansasFest?A: I dunno.  If it makes you feel better, the Kansas border is very close   to Avila College.Q: Who comes to KFest?A: While KFest was originally devoted to programmers, nowadays all kinds of   folk from all over the world show up at Avila College.  Programmers,   users, newsletter publishers, and everyday folk show up from Europe,   Canada, Australia, and all over the United States to celebrate the Apple   II.Q: Who organizes KFest?A: Currently, KFest is organized by a committee headed by The Big Cheese,   Cindy Adams.  The scheduling is done by Steve "Godzilla" Gozdziewski.   There are several other folks on the committee as well: Jerry Cline, Max   Jones, and Stan Marks all pitch in.  In addition to those good folk on   the committee, David Kerwood handles the maintenance of the World Wide   Web site, Devin Reade maintains the email lists, and Eric "Sheppy"   Shepherd provides World Wide Web hosting services and organizes   HackFest, the programming contest.  KFest is sponsored by Intrec   Software.Q: How do I register for KFest?  How much does it cost?A: Depending on when you register, registration prices vary.  Please check   the KFest Home Page at http://www.kfest.org/ for the most current   information.Q: What kind of official activities go on at KFest?A: Officially, there is a keynote speech (this year given by Max Jones of   _Juiced.GS_), sessions on various computing topics, HackFest, a   celebrity roast (_Spectrum_ author Ewen Wannop being the victim of honor   this year), product demonstrations, and a vendor fair.Q: What kind of unofficial activities go on at KFest?A: Unofficially, there's been movie outings, pizza nights, Bite The Bag   contests, late night eating at Denny's, and huge groups of folks going   to steak dinners at K.C. Masterpiece and Jess and Jim's restaurants.Q: Has anyone attended every KFest?A: Two people have attended every KFest so far: Tony Diaz of Alltech   Electronics and Mike Westerfield of Byte Works.Q: I hear that the Avila College dorm is wired for ethernet.  Is there a   way I can access that while I'm there?A: Yes.  You can get the information in the following article:     While Apple Computer, Inc. never produced an Apple II that was trulyportable nor an ethernet solution for the masses (emulated IIs andprototypes notwithstanding), ethernet has become a popular networkingsolution for the computing world at large--so popular, in fact, thatethernet has even invaded that Apple II mecca known as Avila College.     In each dorm room in the halls of Avila are two outlets that seem tobe phone jacks.  These _aren't_ phone jacks.  They're ethernet ports--to beexact, they're RJ-45 connectors that are compatible with 10 Base-Tethernet.  The entire Avila dorm is connected to the Internet this way,making for high speed World Wide Web browsing, electronic mail, and ftpconnections for KansasFesters during their stay!     While those bringing their true blue Apple IIs will be needing to gothe tried and true modem route, those KFesters who bring ethernet-capablecomputers can make full use of these high speed connections.  Let's look atwhat hardware and software is needed to get this high speed resourceworking with your non-Apple II.THE HARDWARE   All Avila provides is the RJ-45 jack.  This looks like an""""""""""""   overgrown RJ-11 jack (the kind your telephone plugs into),and in fact, it's a close relative.  What you need to bring is a computerwith an appropriate 10 Base-T ethernet interface and a cable that ends in amale RJ-45 jack.  There are many, many of these cables on the market.  Ifyou are going to purchase one, be sure it's a straight-through class 5cable, not a crossover cable.  Additionally, due to the way the RJ-45 jackis mounted, you will need a cable ending with a RJ-45 male jack that is notmolded with a surrounding sheath, as the cable will not fit properly.  Youwant a cable end that looks like this:ASCII ART BEGINS      ___________     |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |  <--- Male RJ-45     |   |   |   |     |   |___| <-|------ Locking tab     |           |     |           |     |           |     |___________|       |       |       |       | <------ Cable       |       |as opposed to this:      ___________     |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |  <--- Male RJ-45     |   |   |   |     |   |___| <-|------ Locking tab     |           |     |           |    _|___________|_   |               |   |               |   |               |   |               | <-- Large, molded sheath   |               |   |               |   |_______________|       |       |       |       | <------ Cable       |       |ASCII ART ENDS     I had problems with this at KFest 1998.  If you need to get differentcables (or need other hardware in general) you can ask your fellowattendees if they have extras, or you can run over to the CompUSA in thearea to get what you need.     Once you have this equipment, simply plug in your RJ-45 cable into theprovided jack.  You do not need an ethernet hub unless you'll be runningmore than two devices in your room.THE SOFTWARE   The Avila ethernet server uses a protocol called Dynamic""""""""""""   Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP, for short.  Those ofyou who have set up TCP/IP connections with Windows or Macintosh computers(or, for that matter, the Apple IIgs) probably have some familiarity withinserting IP addresses, DNS addresses, and Gateway addresses.  The beautyof DHCP is that it sets up nearly everything you need dynamically, meaningthat the server assigns these addresses--all you need to do is set upTCP/IP on your computer and choose the DHCP protocol.  I am much morefamillar with the setup of DHCP for Macintosh computers than for Windowsmachines, and am taking the instructions from a reference.MAC   To set up a Macintosh running Open Transport networking for DHCP, all'''   that needs to be done is to switch the TCP/IP protocol to DHCPServer.  So:(1) Get into your TCP/IP Control Panel;(2) Select "Ethernet" (or "Built-in Ethernet" or "Alternate Ethernet" as    appropriate) in the "Connect via:" field;(3) Select "DHCP Server" in the "Configure" field;(4) Quit and save the changes.WINDOWS 95   To set up a Windows 95 machine for DHCP, there are several''''''''''   additional steps:(1) Get into your Network Control panel;(2) Add or select the appropriate ethernet interface;(3) Set the "Obtain an IP address automatically" control in the "IP    Address" tab of the TCP/IP Properties window;(4) Remove any existing setting for a Gateway address in the "Gateway" tab    of the TCP/IP Properties window;(5) Disable DNS in the "DNS Configuration" tab of the TCP/IP Properties    window;(6) Save the settings and reboot the computer.     Regardless of which platform you use, if you have software set up toshare your hard drive with other computers, you probably ought to disableit--unless you like everyone in the Avila ethernet having access to yourfiles.     At this point, you ought to be connected.  If you previously had anyproxy servers set up for use with your setup before Avila, disable them.You ought to have easy access for checking mail, browsing the Web, or usingfile transfer protocol--and very high speeds.  One last caveat:THE SMTP SERVER   As Spam on the Internet proliferates, it has become"""""""""""""""   accepted practice to close off an Internet ServiceProvider's mail sending server--usually using Simple Mail TransferProtocol, or smtp--to access from anyone who is not directly connected tothe ISP.  In other words, no one wants to be a relaying point for Spam.     Because of this, it's likely you will not be able to use the same smtpserver you use at home to send mail while at Avila.  We encountered thisproblem briefly last year and solved it by using the smtp.delphi.com smtpserver--however, in the last year, Delphi also closed its server to access.     It is hoped that there is a smtp.avila.edu or similar server that canbe used while at Avila, but this has not been researched yet.  See me whileyou're at KFest for the latest developments.     So, for those of you bringing ethernet-capable computers toKansasFest, you now have some idea on how to hook them up for high-speedInternet access.  On to the yellow brick road.     On to KansasFest.Q: How can I learn more about KFest?A: You can get more information on KansasFest by visiting the KansasFest   World Wide Web site at http://www.kfest.org/ or sending email to   kfest-help@kfest.org.  You could also subscribe to the KFest mailing   list by sending email to majordomo@kfest.org.  In the body of the email   include the text:          subscribe kfest   You will receive a confirmation email with instructions on finalizing   your subscription.Q: Should I go to KFest?A: Need you ask?  KFest is a must for the serious Apple II fanatic.  Do   yourself a favor--you're worth it.
