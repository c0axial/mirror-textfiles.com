I will split whatever net I get from this, withGlen, as usual.Charlie's AppleSeeds will not upload these programs to any online service.ANY uploads of ProSel or ProSel-16, to be properly uploaded as PublicDomain, should be the latest versions of the programs.

You think that the data will only be arriving at 300 baud...But that is not the case!If you have a computer to modem speed of 57600 baud, then the data willarrive at the computer at that speed, regardless of how fast it actuallyarrived at the modem. The result could be loss of data if the interruptsystem on your computer cannot keep up with that high baud rate.The golden rule is to set the computer to modem speed the same as thehighest you will be connecting at, or the next highest speed if that onedoes not exist in your comms program.This rule was fine until modems got up to 57600 baud. Now we must temperthat rule by also defining how efficient the interrupt chain is in yourparticular computer.At high baud rates, it is also vital that you have the correctly wiredHardware Handshake cable from your computer to the modem.If you have a //e, then I would guess that 38400 baud may be the fastestyou can manage, though you might be able to go faster. If you have a IIgs,and shift-boot into P8 to run ProTerm, then you should have no problem witheven a stock unaccelerated machine at 57600 baud.Running a desktop comms program like Spectrum, gives you a longer interruptchain, and so things will work slower. Even with a shift-boot, I wouldexpect an unnaccelerated machine to have problems with 38400 baud.Accelerate it, and 38400 baud will work well. Run a IIgs emulator such asBernie ][ the Rescue on a Macintosh of at least 100Mhz, and you will beable to go to the full 57600 baud.The collection of Inits and DAs you have can also have a bearing on allthis, and must be taken into consideration if you get any data loss orerrors. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Tue 1 Feb 2000 - 195 days till KFest '99 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.2 & Crock O' Gold 2.6 Bernie ][ the Rescue 2.0 woofing on a PowerMac 8200/120 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                        (EWANNOP, 20001, GO COM A2)NUFX AND BINARY II RULES FOR DELPHI UPLOADS AS PER CONAN   Actually, the""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   rules gosomething like this:1) All files must be packed with ShrinkIt and wrapped in Binary II,   except for platform-independent files such as GIF and JPEG, and   the rare Macintosh files which are Stuffed and MacBinaried.2) The ShrinkIt archive name must match the Binary II name. In other   words, NEATGAME.BXY had better have NEATGAME.SHK inside, and the   filetype on NEATGAME.SHK had better be correct ($E0/$8002.)3) No disk archives or self-extracting archives unless absolutely   necessary. The former is usually reserved for non-ProDOS disks and   disks that use Apple's Installer. The latter is not used at all   except for the ShrinkIt program itself (it's easier for newbies to   unpack it that way...usually.)That's pretty much it. Some people pack multiple file archives in their ownfolders, but that's certainly not a requirement. In fact, it takes a tinybit of unnecessary space that way. ShrinkIt has an option to create a newfolder to unpack files into, so that's not a problem anyway. If you open anarchive that's got 51 files not enclosed in a folder, make one yourself.It is customary, but not required, that the archive name in some wayresemble what's inside. For example, it's nice to put a game called "NeatGame" in an archive called NEATGAME.BXY instead of MISC.STUFF.BXY. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager - Tue Feb 09, 1999 4:33:58 am [Delivered with Spectrum v2.2 and Crock O' Gold] -- I am not a dictator.  It's just I have a grumpy face.                        (TONYW1, 20263, GO COM A2)<<<<<   Here's one reason for not putting multiple files inside a folder"""""   when you make the ShrinkIt archive. Let's say I download an upgradeof a program I already own. I want to have ShrinkIt overwrite the old filesas they are unpacked. If the files were archived inside a folder, then Ihave to make sure the folder name on my disk match the one the author usedwhen he made the archive. If they don't match, I have to unpack into aseparate folder, quit ShrinkIt, and copy the files to where they belong.Okay, that's probably an extreme example but I think it makes my point.As for shell unpacking, doesn't yankit have an option to list the contentsof an archive? I know it's an extra step, but it would solve the problem. - Tony                        (TONYW1, 20281, GO COM A2)CREATING USABLE GWIII IMAGES WITH A QUICKIE   If you have GWIII v2.0 or"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   above, try this:1) Install the Quickie NDA - and reboot your system.

We just never knew exactly when the changeswould take place. But just the other day, we were informed that the end wasnear.I was hoping that we'd be able to get in one final Monday nightmulti-system chat before the Appuse forum was no longer accessible to thosewith an Apple II, and to that end, I urged 100 Apple II users on CompuServeto show up tonight in order to "send a message" to the 'powers that be' atCompuServe.As it turns out, that last little bit of Apple II rabble rousing may havebeen fun, but when I tried logging onto Appuse this morning, I found outthat we won't be able to show the CompuServe big-wigs that we take our"Apple II Forever" slogan seriously. They went ahead and shut the Appuseforum.There is, however, a little justice in the world.The Apple II area on CompuServe now resides within the Mac Hardware forum,and as an early-riser, I was able to snag the first Apple II message onthat new area. Using my Apple II "PowerBot" peripheral, I made sure thatthe welcoming message stated the obvious..."Apple II Forever!"Oh well. It was fun while it lasted, but it looks like our multi-systemchat is now down to just Delphi and Genie.Joe Kohn                       (JOE_KOHN, 20016, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Hi all,"""""I wasn't sure where to put this; I hope it isn't too evil of me to start anew thread.  This news is a few days old but I didn't see it mentioned inthe message base here, so...As of Monday, the Apple II User Forum on CompuServe - GO APPUSER - is nolonger accessible via ASCII.  In fact, the forum itself no longer exists.All that remains is message Section 14/Apple II and file Library 16/AppleII in the Macintosh Hardware Forum, GO MACHW.A few years ago CompuServe started switching from the 36-bit computers usedto run ASCII forums as APPUSER, to new 32-bit systems running NISA (NewInformation System Architecture, I think).  Both systems could be accessedby a program that employed HMI (Human Micro Interface?), CompuServe'sproprietary data protocol; but in order to trim costs and also to make roomfor new WebView forums, the new machines no longer have ASCII support.Forums for which ASCII support was integral to their subject material, suchas APPUSER, have been maintained, but it is now reported that these forumsare not Y2K-compliant; and rather than upgrade them, all remaining ASCIIforums are now either being switched to NISA, or are being absorbed by NISAforums (as was the case with APPUSER).The chance of an HMI-capable program ever existing for the Apple II iszilch. CompuServe refuses to release the programming specs.Macintosh users can use MacCIM or MacNav - these are two of a handful ofMac HMI programs.Apple II users can still logon to CompuServe's ASCII side and accesswhatever is still available through that format: email, Executive NewsService, Grolier's Encyclopedia, etc.  CIS can also be used as an ISP withMarinetti.The updates to ShiftyList, WebWorks, and Bernie should be available inMACHW later this week.                       (KEN_GAGNE, 20081, GO COM A2)>>>>>   An interesting sidenote:  When I got the "your software isn't"""""   compatible with the forum" message on CIS Monday morning, I calledCIS to cancel my account.  I was informed by the nice lady I talked to thatsince I had been a CIS subscriber since 1986, they could offer me a specialstatus:  I no longer will have to pay a minimum monthly charge for having aCIS account. I can let this account sit dormant for years into the futurewith no problems, and should I decide to log on, I'll only be charged$1.95/hr. and I can upgrade my account status at any time.She then asked why I was going to cancel (I did take the new acct. status,BTW), and I told her that CIS was of little use to me with the Apple IIarea turned off.  Not ony was she unaware that there HAD been an Apple IIsection on the system she was a cust.ser rep for, it turns out that sheowns an Apple //e, and is interested in getting it back up and running andon the net.  I pointed her to the A2 Motherboard, and Delphi, and I thinkshe may join here.

I am also postingthe message here, in case anybody missed it on csa2.Last summer a question was posted about transferring the New Print Shopprogram from 5.25" discs onto a 3.5" disc. I have been experimenting withthis problem, and have successfully done such a transfer. Here is how I didit.First, format the 3.5" disc and name it NPS. Then, create 2 subdirectorieson the disc, whose names should be PS and PSL.DATA3. The PS subdirectorywill be for the program files, and the PSL.DATA3 subdirectory will be forthe graphics, fonts and borders. Now, set the prefix to PSL.DATA3, andcreate 4 new subdirectories under PSL.DATA3. These 4 new subdirectorieswill be named GRAPHICS, FONTS, BORDERS and USER.Now you need to copy the program files from the 5.25" discs onto the 3.5"disc. The program files are on the disc labelled PROGRAM DISC, and are onboth sides of the disc. Copy the files PRODOS and PS.SYSTEM onto the 3.5"disc under the root directory. Copy all the files from both sides of thedisc, with the exception of PRODOS, onto the 3.5" disc under thesubdirectory PS. There will be some duplicates of files on side A and sideB.Now you need to fix a few bytes in the PS.SYSTEM program. Since thisprogram was copied into 2 different places on the 3.5" disc, be sure to fixit in both places. It is easiest to do the fix using a block editor, suchas ZAP in ProSel. However, you could also BLOAD the program, POKE in thecorrect values, then BSAVE it back onto disc. Here are the bytes to befixed:$06 & 07 - change to $01$20 through 27 - change to $07 2F 4E 50 53 2F 50The first change tells New Print Shop that it does not have to ask you toflip the disc over for side A or side B to load program modules. The secondchange tells New Print Shop that program modules are in the subdirectory/NPS/PS.Now you have to put all the New Print Shop graphics, fonts and borders ontothe 3.5" disc. These will all go under the subdirectory DATA DISC 2. Copyall the files found in the GRAPHICS subdirectories of both sides of bothdiscs into the /NPS/PSL.DATA3/GRAPHICS subdirectory on the 3.5" disc.  Copyall the files from the FONTS directory on both sides of DATA DISC 1 intothe /NPS/PSL.DATA3/FONTS subdirectory. Copy all the files from the BORDERSsubdirectory on both sides of DATA DISC 1 into the /NPS/PSL.DATA3/BORDERSsubdirectory. The New Print Shop program has now been transferred from the5.25" disc to the 3.5" disc.Gerry Wright (the Applesoft-aholic)gerrywright@delphi.com                      (GERRYWRIGHT, 20338, GO COM A2)BALLOON BUG LOCATED IN NEW ENGLAND   I just found a serious bug in Balloon.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""When extracting a file that already exists in the destination, it will popup the usual "Rename/Skip/Overwrite" box.

There are a few comments worthmaking here.1. It is not so much the card that is the problem, but the GS/OS driversfor it. (Not too surprising when it can be fixed with new drivers!)2. In ProDOS 8, as far as I can tell there isn't a problem at all becausethe card is using the ROM drivers on the card itself. This is a very goodthing when I'm downloading files in ProTerm!3. Again as far as I can tell, the problem with the GS/OS driver is verysimple. The SCSI time-out value set by the driver (1/4 second?) is too low.(In fact, I've had cause to regret the low value on other occasions in thepast.) When the drive "wakes up", the first SCSI call has to wait while thedrive spins up, and the time-out value is exceeded. I had a brief look onetime but I never did find the location in the driver where the time-out isset.The really frustrating part is that a timeout error doesn't seem to behandled all that well by GS/OS. The system "sort-of" knows it got an error,but somehow "isn't sure", so that all sorts of weirdness can happen. Forexample, GS/OS may decide that the root directory has been damaged, when infact a reboot shows that nothing is wrong. OTOH, I *have* lost a rootdirectory on some occasions. :-(One rule of thumb I have is to eject and reinsert the disk if I have comeback from ProDOS 8, or if I think the disk has gone to sleep under GS/OS.The workarounds have pretty much become automatic for me, but I really mustget the Tulin drivers one day...--Peter Watson-- Write to MSDOS disks on the Apple IIgs?-- Impossible! ;-)                      (PETERWATSON, 20788, GO COM A2)THE VALUE OF SHAREWARE   This evening I had a really fun time with my""""""""""""""""""""""   9-year-old.

But that doesn't mean I have to like it.I recommend you read my reply to Udo, answering the question, "What waswrong with the AUGE CD anyway?"  The answer is: "Not much"... but it hadbeen my hope that a Genie-based CD would avoid the pitfalls of earlier CDs,rather than charging ahead and making them all over again.A collection, to my mind, is more than just a dump of everything one has onhand.  One has to keep in mind the cumulative effect--how will it look tothe new arrival who has never seen the collection before, and doesn'trealize it was accumulated over time?- Some may say that Genie is already mostly pre-vetted anyway. I agree, butwould like to see it quickly re-vetted if possible.- Some may say that they want all released versions--that they don't wantjust v1.0 and v3.1, they want all the versions in between as well.  Iagree; I just don't want two copies of v2.2.- Some may argue that they want it "warts and all".  I understand thatpoint of view too, but feel it could be balanced with "tidying" as opposedto "editing".My point was, and is, a good CD would be more than just a dump of all thefiles in the Genie library.

The files that appear in thatdirectory are a duplicate copy of one of the Pictures disks--GS.Pics.05(Disk 067).  Quality control would have prevented such an error.An inevitable problem with the CD is duplication: CDA.ADB on GS.CDAs.01 andGS.CDAs.02; PACMAN on GS.NDAs.03 and GS.NDAs.04; SPELLBINDER 1.00 onGS.Games.02 and GS.Games.16.

There's alsoquite a lot of duplication in the collections of sound files, and someduplication in the collections of picture files, but I can't quote youchapter and verse here.Of course, some of this is inevitable since the disks were compiled over along time.  And the CD has to be this way if it is to accurately representthe AUGE collection.  I understand that.  But it does point up the factthat the AUGE CD was an amateur effort.I don't want to do without amateur efforts--I'm very very pleased that AUGEmade copies of their collection for their members to buy, and then let therest of us buy too.  All I'm saying is that the AUGE CD can be frustratingto use sometimes, because it could have been an appreciably better CD if ithad been possible to eliminate the duplication.That wasn't possible in the case of the AUGE CD for historical reasons.Fair enough.  But let's learn from the mistakes of previous CDs, please,before another one is released? Doug C.                        (D_CUFF, 20671, GO COM A2)WHEN IS ANIMASIA 3D SHOWING UP ON DELPHI?   A3D will be uploaded to Delphi,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   eventually. It will also beavailable on Tony Diaz's apple2.org Web site in the near future.Two things are delaying this: 1) I have trouble uploading/downloading toDelphi. My 8-bit connection through Genie is very slow, and the A3D filesare very big (four of them at no less than 460K each).  2) I was intendingto wait until the manual/documentation files are also ready to go throughthe process. A3D isn't particularly useful, at least not for any projects,without the docs.That said, I promise to get the A3D archives uploaded here very soon. Theyare already available on Genie, and have been for several weeks. Myconnection there is faster and more reliable.I believe the manual archives will be reconstructed soon. An Apple IIcolleague of mine, Gareth Jones, has been working on alternative methodsfor presenting the manuals. (How does a collection of !Help! files sound?)But this is a big job, and takes some time.You will definitely have fun playing with this program. I hope to get sometime to learn more about it (and write an in-depth review) in a few months. Max Jones Juiced.GS http://www.wbwip.com/juiced.gs                       (JUICEDGS, 20430, GO COM A2)                              PUBLIC POSTINGS                              """""""""""""""KANSASFEST 1999--YOUR MOMENT OF TRUTH""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ______      _____(      )   (      )     ____________________________________________ |     |  /     /      (        _____________________________'99____) |     | /     /        |      | |     |/     /         |      |                         II Infinitum!! |           /          |      |______ |     |\     \         |      _______) __________    ________   ________ |     | \     \        |      |       (     _____)  (     ___) (__    __) |     |  \     \       |      |        |   |__       \    \       |   | |     |   \     \      |      |        |    __)       \    \      |   | |     |    \      \    |      |        |   |_____   ___\    \     |   |(______)    (________) (_______)       (__________) (_________)    |___|Experience The Magic!! When: July 21-25, 1999 Where: Avila College, Kansas City, Missouri+++KFest is back ... and it's never been more affordable!Check out these rates, which include room and meals from Wednesday evening(dinner) on July 21, through Sunday morning (breakfast) on July 25.(Saturday evening dinner not included.

Here are some highlights of the past year:-- Juiced.GS ... enlisted the able assistance of Apple II experts BretVictor and Dave Tribby to teach users more about making music on theirIIgses.-- ... introduced the Apple II community to the work of Louis Cornelio, aSan Diego educator who keeps the IIgs spirit alive in his high schoolclassroom, and maintains an impressive presence on the World Wide Web.-- ... attended Kfest '98 and was the fist printed publication to offer acomplete, firsthand report of news and dramatic product unveilings thatoccurred there.-- ... was the first to publish in-depth reviews of new products such asSuperConvert 4.0, NiftySpell, WebWorks GS, GraphicWriter III 2.1, DiskAccess II, and GSoft BASIC.-- ... launched a quarterly telecommunications column by Tony Ward to helpusers of all levels get more productivity and enjoyment from their onlinetime and effort.-- ... introduced an ongoing series of articles/tutorials by Eric Shepherdabout GSoft BASIC that serves the needs of both novice and advanced users.That series will continue well into 1999.-- ... in conjunction with Mike Westerfield and the Byte Works, placed acopy of "GSoft BASIC: The Free Version" into the hands of each and everysubscriber (275 of them), so they could follow along with Shepherd's GSoftarticles and learn more about this cool new programming language.-- ... played a key role in working with Michael Lutynski to reclassify thedynamic program Animasia 3-D as shareware and make it available to the IIgscommunity.-- ... continued to offer inexpensive disk compilations for special orderfrom readers so that everyone can have access to such fabulous new softwareas Babelfish, Wolfenstein 3D, GShisen, Animasia 3-D, Fontpimp, DesktopAlarm, Marinetti and Twilight II 2.0.Indeed, Juiced.GS had a great year. (See samples of last year's product onour Web site. The URL is listed below.) And in case you missed it, The Lamp(the cool digital newsletter centered on Delphi) named our magazine thebest Apple II publication of the year!We certainly appreciate such recognition, but don't expect us to rest onour laurels. We're hard at work to make sure 1999 will be just as good, oreven better!In 1999, you will read more from Eric Shepherd about GSoft BASIC; be wowedby a stunning hardware discovery from Geoff Weiss; and learn more about therich and colorful of history of AppleWorks Classic from Gareth Jones.What's more, Juiced.GS will strive in 1999 to become the ultimate authorityand news source on the rapidly expanding area of IIgs emulation. Look foran introductory article from Ryan Suenaga on the meteoric rise of the"Virtual GS" in the upcoming issue -- Volume 4, Issue 1 -- due out in midMarch.Juiced.GS will, of course, be in Kansas City for Kfest '99. And as newproducts and upgrades are released throughout the year, you can count on usbeing right there to report the news and present reviews.Renewals have been coming in since the final issue of 1998 was published,and we're getting a number of new subscribers as well. But if you haven'tyet renewed, or have been putting off subscribing, now is the time to moveahead and become part of the Juiced.GS gang.A 1999 subscription is $14 in the U.S., Canada and Mexico; $20 elsewhere inthe world.As a special promotion, new 1999 subscribers will get the final issue of1998 FREE.

You'll learn GSoft BASIC from the author of the mostwidely used programming tools on the Apple IIGS, then and now, MikeWesterfield.  He's also the author of the text for the course, a newself-paced tutorial book called Learn to Program in GSoft BASIC.The course is divided into fourteen lessons, which cover the entireAdvanced Placement Computer Science curriculum.  You'll learn the BASICprogramming language and the essential programming skills you need to writereal programs--skills like sorting, searching, managing stacks, andmanipulating trees.Each week we'll meet in the Delphi chat room to discuss any problems you'rehaving, expand on the materials in the book, and cover any questions youhave that the book doesn't deal with.  We'll cover one lesson a week, butyou're free to work ahead, and you can keep coming if you fall a bitbehind, too.Prerequisites: None.Workload:  Expect to spend 2 to 6 hours per week on the course,           depending on your background.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                [thelamp@sheppyware.net]    IMAGEMAKER MAKES SETTING UP BERNIE A BREEZE FOR CURRENT IIGS USERS    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     In the December issue of _The Lamp!_, we took a look at how to moveyour IIgs hard drives over to your Power Macintosh running a copy of_Bernie ][ The Rescue_ using Zip Drives or other removable large storagemedia.  Since then, one of the most prolific Apple II programmers of recenttimes, Eric Shepherd, aka Sheppy, has released a new program that makesthis older method obsolete and requires nothing in the way of additionalhardware.  His new program, _ImageMaker_, can take RAMdisks, floppy disks,or hard disks attached to your IIgs and turn them into usable images forBernie to bone up with.     _ImageMaker_ is a $5 IIgs shareware product.  With it, you can createtwo types of images: DiskCopy 4.2, which is a standard disk image intendedfor floppy diskettes on the Macintosh (these images are limited by theDiskCopy format to 800k and 1440k disks), and Universal Disk Image, whichis a disk image format that has become popular with Apple II emulators,including _Bernie_.  Neither of these formats are compressed, so you canfigure an image of an 800k diskette actually taking up a slight bit morespace than 800k, for instance.     The advantage of using DiskCopy images is that they can actually beread by your Macintosh as disks and written back to real disks.  The majordisadvantage would be that only 800k and 1440k sizes are officiallysupported.  While the Universal Disk Image format cannot be read by yourMac (or other computer) as if it were a real disk nor written back to areal disk, it can be used with several different emulators and can handleany size of disk, making it ideal for hard drives.     To use it most efficiently, you need to set up an AppleTalk networkbetween your IIgs and Power Mac.  There have been many other articleswritten about this subject so we will not cover it here.  Once your networkhas been set up and you have logged on with your IIgs to your Mac (makingsure you have sufficient hard disk space for disk images of your IIgsvolumes), simply start _ImageMaker_.  The interface is extremely simple tofollow: just choose which disk you wish to make an image of, which of thetwo formats you want the image to be in, then save it to your mounted MacAppleshare volume.  Once _ImageMaker_ is done doing its thing, you willhave a disk image (regardless of whether you choose DiskCopy or UniversalDisk Image format) that _Bernie_ will be able to mount through its "MountDisk" option.  _Much_ simpler than the Zip Drive method discussed inDecember!     So, for you die-hard Apple II fans who are putting _Bernie_ on yournew Power Macs, the $5 shareware fee is well worth it.  This is thesimplest method yet to get your Virtual II up and running.  Get_ImageMaker_ as soon as you possibly can!         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :  If this were an actual wisecrack, it would be funny. :         :                                                       :         ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: LUMITECH ::::::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
