Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                         SIMPLE, PRACTICAL, PROVEN                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Since our last talk, to the alternating cheers and jeers of themainstream computing crowd, Microsoft unleashed its _Windows 98_ operatingsystem on an expecting world.  "Windows 98 Party!" cried CompUSA andComputer City and other giant computing retailing chains, making anxiousbuyers late for work the next morning with their after-midnight madness.Not just on the island, but across the nation if not the world, the hypethat would be king of mainstream computing finally went on sale with allthe hoopla of a Broadway opening--in fact, even more hoopla than that.     I don't subscribe to the belief that any operating system (regardlessof origin) is evil.  It's just an alternative, and a new version bringswith it all the advances--real and less than--that we're used to with newtechnology in any field.  The mythical state of obsolesence is thedirection such an introduction is supposedly pushing us in.  But is it?     Alternatives to that which is old abound, regardless of what we'retalking about.  For daily transportation, I drive a truck that went out ofproduction eight years ago.  I heat up my lunch at work in a microwave ovenout of the early '80's, I wear a pair of shoes that I bought almost a yearago and can't find at the store anymore.  By modern definitions, all ofthese things are obsolete, yet the truck still runs, the oven still heats,and the shoes still pass dress code.  That hasn't changed.     If you look for a computing example, you need not look far, indeed.In fact, I have no need to even discuss my old Apple II's--just look at myMacintosh computers, both of which are no longer in production.  Yet thekeyboard still types, the hard drive still spins, and the screen stilllights up.  It still works.     As does the Apple II.     In my estimation, mainstream computer equipment is not unlikemainstream athletic equipment.  I went for a bicycle ride with a friend ofmine, new to cycling, who showed up with a 24 speed fully suspendedmountain bike to ride with me as I took my tourer, a vintage 1989 convertedBridgestone mountain bike, on one of the first mid-length rides of thesummer.  He certainly had nice new equipment, including a shiny new helmet,jersey, and shorts, along with his bike.  Unfortunately for him, he didn'tpick up any new speed along with his stuff, being just as fast as he wasthe month before.     Newer is nice, but is it better?     As long as there is a place for the new, there'll also be a place forthe not-so-new.  And that's where I'll be, Apple II in tow.                                [*] [*] [*]     And Charles Barkley Is Really 6'7" Department: I had announced thismonth's issue of _The Lamp!_ would be shorter than usual due to the factthat KansasFest 1998 is fast approaching and I have a lot to do to getready for my annual trip to Avila.  However, as this issue nearscompletion, I see that in terms of actual length, this file is longer thanever.  Don't give me the credit: give the credit to the A2 and A2Pro gangon Delphi, who have given the opportunity for me to carry their vitaldiscussions here in _The Lamp!_.     I'll be leaving for KFest within days.

It's dirt > cheap... > Anybody figured out how to get it to download using ProTerm?Let's analyse that: A really cheapo modem, what's wrong with ProTERM ?? :|The easiest way for major modem (and any appliance device) manufacturers todevelop sales in other markets, is to take the guts of their populardevice, inhibit the feature-functions slightly, change the package, andsell at a low-ball price under a pseudonym and psuedomodel. All they'vedone is to make the device less attractive, less usable, and low-costavailability. This allows them to manufacture the entire line, even thequality model at a much lower cost, and to also sell the quality product ata much higher profit, and the inhibited model at a cheap price that willmove large quantities. A similar strategy has always been common in theauto industry where there are many common parts for Cad, Pontiac, Chev suchas glass, trim, roller, hinge, closure parts, et al. Parts is parts! :)Large appliance/goods stores, Sears, Wards, etc., put a twist on thisstrategy. They do not sell the cheap model, but privately refer to these(inhibited) models as "bolt-downs" because they're the ones advertised butnever sold (they are in essence, bolted to the floor - thus the name). Theyare advertised cheap, the customer comes to buy one and the salesperson,under pressure of losing their job, makes sure the bolt-down, is =never=sold, but those with the bells and whistles (and profit margin) move out ofthe warehouse at a good clip. The lowly bolt-down, most probably the onlyone in stock, remains until it dies of obsolescence. However, largequantities of the "bolt-down" are moved through those schlocky horrid adson radio, TV and newspaper from stores that hawk the cheap stuff.I bought a brand name TV cheap, at a schlock store. Later to find that if Iwould have shopped, I could have had the same brand, different model at aslightly higher price, that model had features I would have enjoyed usingand would have paid the difference to get. I then came to realize what Ialready knew -- I had purchased a bolt-down -- some of us are slow learners:)Another lesson is later learned, what do I do if I have a problem or aquestion? The store I bought my TV from couldn't/wouldn't help, and laterclosed their doors. The credited stores (Sears, Wards etc) have excellentreturn, guarantee and repair facilities for their appliances but we arelucky to find anyone that will talk to us if we happen to buy the bolt-downfrom the price vendors.That being said: > Anybody figured out how to get it to download using ProTerm?Another Delphi user asked about this modem and ProTERM, and Greg Schaeferoffered this: ...tack on an E0 to the end of [the init string] (ProTERM requires thatmodem echo be disabled). ...boot directly into ProDOS8 to make sure thereis no GS/OS stuff running which might cause data loss [and try it again].Booting directly into ProDOS 8 apparently resolved the problem for her.Anything stealing clock cyles can play havoc with download protocol timing.Regards, AutoReply: Jerry Cline @ InTrec Software, Inc. - jerry@intrec.com ProTERM @ your service!

Customershave sent cables to us in their modes of frustration, and some have beenwired for who knows for what -- we have no clue?? In those cases, our modemcable easily resolved the problem.The common cable problem is when cable "looks" right, but is not checked.Until recently, there were many more printers than modems, and the chanceof getting a printer cable was high. Printers are terminal devices (thesignal stops there) and modems are not (they pass the signal through).Consequently, the send and receive pins are reversed on a printer cablebecause when the printer needs to communicate with the CPU, it sends asignal via the send pin to the receive pin on the CPU, and the CPU sends toits send pin which is received by the printer's receive pin.As it relates to Spectrum, I assume they still advocate the design from theProTERM manual that Greg Schaefer designed. I say this because severalyears ago, Seven Hills verbally requested permission to also advocate thatsame design, and we gave that permission. I think the person who called wasDave? I'm sure they would agree with what I stated above.One of the great attributes of the cable design we use is, it is completelyuniversal from 300 baud to whatever bps it is pressed it to meet.Regards, AutoReply: Jerry Cline @ InTrec Software, Inc. - jerry@intrec.com ProTERM @ your service!

B SCSI card. I currentlyhave it installed in a "spare" GS that I'm putting together. I hooked up alittle NCS SCSI drive that I have so I could check the card out, butinstead of booting up, it returns the "Unable to locate ProDOS" message.(The first partition on this drive =does= have a bootable system setup andboots just fine on my main GS, BTW.) I =believe= I had everythingconfigured correctly in the RamFast Utilities when I booted it up the firsttime, but now I can't seem to get back into the utility screen to check theconfiguration. :/My questions are:1) How do I get back to the Utilities screen to check the configuration? I   tried holding down the "8" key while booting (which works with my   RamFast rev. D card on my GS at school), but that doesn't work.2) Is there anything else that might cause that error message that I am   perhaps overlooking?This friend says that the RamFast worked fine the last time he used it, butthat was several years ago.Any ideas, suggestions, or random thoughts will be appreciated. :) Stan Marks stanmarks@delphi.com OR s.marks3@genie.com Delivered by Spectrum v2.5 and COG KFest '98 Bound!                       (STANMARKS, 13138, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I've always used numeric-keypad-0, and that's worked on my Rev C"""""   and Rev D (ROM versions 3.0something thru 3.01f). 8 is the key toProDOS-8 boot in an unmodified System 6.x.Nathan Mates                        (NMATES, 13139, GO COM A2)<<<<<   Uhm...heheh...I knew that! :}"""""Unfortunately, the 0 key doesn't seem to work, either Nathan, BUT...changing the RamFast to another slot screws up it's configuration and=forces= it to boot into the RamFast Utilities. <G>Ryan and Tony were "helping" me with this last night in the A2 conference,and that's how I discovered that I could force the RamFast into theUtilities screen, but when I finally did get there, it seems that there isNO TransWarp option, and there IS a "Slot Allocation Priority" setting,both of which Ryan thinks indicate an old set of ROM chips begging for anupgrade.Just to clarify the problem, I presently have the RamFast card installed inSlot 7 of a "spare" ROM 3 GS with a 4-meg memory card. (I also tried it ina ROM 01 with the same memory card and got the same results.) I have an NCSHD that is my secondary drive on my main GS and which is connected to anApple High Speed SCSI card. This drive has 2 partitions: NCS.1 (ProDOS, 32Mb) and NCS.2 (HFS, 129.5 Mb). The first partition has a full system 6.0.1installed and will boot up just fine on my main GS...the "fun" begins whenI hook it up to the RamFast on the other computer.When the drive is connected to the RamFast on the other machine, it appearsto operate normally but returns the "Unable to locate ProDOS" message...andyet, ProDOS IS there on the drive, and yes, the slot assignments arecorrectly set in the Control Panels (S7-Your Card). (Remember...I said itboots just fine on my main machine with the AHS card? :) Any attempts tobring up the RamFast Utilities from the ROMDisk (rebooting with the 0 key)to check the configuration is futile, but, again, I CAN force it by movingthe card to another slot. Even doing so and re-configuring the card (andreassigning the startup to S6-Your Card) yields the same error message.So...I then tried putting my Focus card in with the RamFast and booting with it.The Focus boots up just fine, the CVTECH.ROM shows up on the screen, andthe RamFast recognizes NCS.1 but NOT NCS.2! If I try to run the RamFastUtilities from either the ROMDisk or NCS.1, it asks me to "insert the diskNCS.2"! Pressing Return yields the same request, so I have to Escape to getout of the utilities. If I try to run the utilities from the Focus drive,the computer crashes, and I'm back to square one! :/So, after "sleeping on it", the following conclusions occur to me:1) The RamFast IS working, but maybe it doesn't recognize the ProDOS on the   NCS.1 partition OR the #2 HFS partition (yet it DOES recognize a 27 Mb   HFS partition on the Focus), which leads me to believe that...2) The RamFast ROMs need to be replaced with Rev.C ROMs.Does that sound reasonable/plausible/possible?Any other ideas or suggestions? Stan Marks stanmarks@delphi.com OR s.marks3@genie.com Delivered by Spectrum v2.1 and COG v2.5 KFest '98 Bound!                       (STANMARKS, 13159, GO COM A2)>>>>>   When you get into the utilities screen you should see, in the upper"""""   left quadrant of that screen, a few lines of text that give you,among other things, the ROM revision of the RF utilities.

B, Rev. C, and Rev. D (intentionally ignoring the special//e compatible Rev. D card which I've never seen, and the Rev. A whichnever made public distribution).The Rev. B and Rev. C cards are practically identical, and, in fact, arealmost indistinguishable unless the person trying to tell the differencereally knows what to look for.  In fact, they use =the same ROMs= (morelater on the significance of this, besides what is blatantly obvious).They are usable with the //e and IIgs, are large cards with dip switches,and can't easily be upgraded beyond 256k of cache (they can be upgraded,just not easily by mere mortals).The Rev. D card is a distinctly different beastie which is IIgs compatibleonly, eliminated the DIP switches in favor of a single jumper and theRamFAST util program, and only uses a single replacable ROM chip instead ofthe 2 that the Rev. B/C cards use.Now, old timers know that Sequential is not the originator of the RamFAST;it was born via CVTech, which sold the rights to it and the 8 meg IIgs cardthat Sequential currently sells to Sequential.  When Sequential took oversupport of the RamFAST, for some reason, it totally stopped supporting Rev.B cards, and really, they don't know anything whatsoever about it.However, as you see above, the Rev. C card, which it still supports, isfunctionally identical, so. . . simply order the Rev. C ROMs, and replacethe ROMs currently in the Rev. B with them.The older (I would guess pre-3.00 but I'm not 100% sure) versions of theRamFAST ROMs couldn't do anything with partitions larger than 32 megs(okay, maybe CD ROMs were a special case, but I didn't have a CD Rom drivein those days :), which is why the HFS partition that Stan is unable tomount is not recognized (really, those were pre System 6, pre-HFS.FST days,so greater than 32 meg partitions were not an issue).So, what you need to do is upgrade the ROMs in the Rev. B RamFAST by usingthe current 3.01f versions of the Rev. C ROMs.  Technically, this is notthe same as going to a Rev. C from a Rev. B; it's merely upgrading the ROM,not the card, and Sequential will get confused (as you can see) when yousay anything bout a Rev. B card.  Just tell them you want the Rev. C ROMs.And, if you're wondering how I know all of this, it's because I have a Rev.B RamFAST right here in the GS that's posting this message, with Rev. 3.01fROMs for the Rev. C RamFAST in them, and the thing works like an absolutechamp. :)> So...what - if anything - can I do with this thing?Well, you can give it to me. . . :)RyanKFest '98!Delivered by OLRight! scripts for ANSITerm                       (RSUENAGA, 13189, GO COM A2)<<<<<   In message 'RE: RamFast rev.B problem (Re: Msg 13186)' UTTER said:"""""> You need the current revision of U15 and U16, and you need to make sure> that your DRAM is up to snuff.

Should I order the EPROM chip, too?Okay; first, some clarification: both U15 and U16 are ROMs, PROMs, EPROMs(not EEPROMs, though, I don't think, although they certainly could be :)These acronyms, assuming everyone understands ROM is Read Only Memory,mean:PROM   = Programmable ROMEPROM  = Erasable Programmable ROMEEPROM = Electically Erasable Programmable ROMIn any case, the U15 is a 27C256 EPROM, and the U16 is a 2764A-2 EPROM.From what Florence said to you above, it clearly sounds to me like shestill thinks you have a Rev. D RamFAST.What you need to order, exactly, are the ROM upgrade chips (call them ROMs,PROMs, EPROMs, whatever :) for the Rev. C RamFAST, specifically the U15 andU16, which are the only ROM chips on the board.  I find it appalling, butnot surprising, that Sequential is having such a difficult time with this.If need be, I can see if I can find the receipt from the last time Iordered these things from them, but if they can't already tell exactly whatyou need from your description, I'll be stunned if the part number wouldhelp. . .RyanProud owner of RamFAST Rev.

You want the Apple II as itis.If it is because you cannot afford something better, and let's not pickbones here, the Mac and W95 *ARE* better in many ways, most significantlyspeed. You can argue the importance of proportional scroll bars and thesupposed elegance of GS/OS all you like, but these other machine do more,faster. If it because you can't afford anything better, then upgrading theApple II is not going to help, because you still wouldn't be able to affordit. And trust me, the costs WOULD be more expensive than a new Mac or PC.So seriously, I cannot see any reason to upgrade it. And if there was areason, there's always the emulator market. But then it gets down towhether an emulator is supposed to emulate the past as a way to preservewhat once was, or whether it is a way forward. Again, it may be better tojust buy a Mac or PC for the heavy duty work, and keep the II for fun.Regards, Richard                       (RICHARD_B, 13431, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I just wanted to comment on some of the ideas and comments in this"""""   thread.We are working our bottoms off to offer a reliable emulation software and,once we got there, upgrade path. The future of Apple II emulation and AppleIIgs emulation in particular is to combine Apple II functionality withfeatures offered by the hosting machine. This is IMO the onlycost-effective way to push the Apple II platform ahead. It doesn't involveasking anyone for permission, it doesn't stop anyone from implementing funfeatures, it costs you a measly $25, and it won't stop Apple II computingto change for the better. And if it were Gus that saved the emulationworld, that would free me from working on Bernie and I had a lot more sparetime. Fine with me! :)As Richard suggested, the fun starts when adding features that go beyond astock IIgs.woof,- henrik                        (GUDATH, 13494, GO COM A2)                              PUBLIC POSTINGS                              """""""""""""""JUST DAYS REMAINING!!!"""""""""""""""""""""" ______      _____(      )   (      )     ____________________________________________ |     |  /     /      (        _____________________________'98____) |     | /     /        |      | |     |/     /         |      |                         II Infinitum!! |           /          |      |______ |     |\     \         |      _______) __________    _________  ________ |     | \     \        |      |       (     _____)  (     ___) (__    __) |     |  \     \       |      |        |   |__       \    \       |   | |     |   \     \      |      |        |    __)       \    \      |   | |     |    \      \    |      |        |   |_____   ___\    \     |   |(______)    (________) (_______)       (__________) (_________)    |___|MORE NEWS ON KANSASFEST 1998!KansasFest 1998 will be held once again on the campus of Avila Collegein Kansas City, Missouri. It will take place from July 22 - July 26,1998.The cost of attending KFest '98 is only $365, which -includes- the useof a double room in the Avila College dorms -and- meals!  There are alsoa limited number of single rooms available for $465.  (If you wish tostay at one of the many hotels or motels near the college then the costis $265, but you would, of course, have to find and pay for your own roomand meals.)Confirmed speakers for this year include Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd(Wolfenstein 3D for the Apple IIgs), Nathan Mates (Twilight II 2.0),Tony Diaz (Alltech Electronics), Ewen Wannop (Spectrum), Geoff Weiss(Spectrum Internet Suite), Mike Westerfield (ByteWorks) and Joe Kohn(Shareware Solutions II).This year, we are running a number of contests, including the RogerWagner tie contest, a Door Sign contest, and, for all of you programmers,we are also planning our first Hack Contest!  Rules are still pending,but stay tuned for details.  It's -highly- suggested anyone interested inthese contests (and possible prizes) tune into the KFest InformationMailing List (see how to subscribe below).Check-in will be on Wednesday from 1-4 pm, and check-out from 11 am- 1 pm on Sunday. Computer sessions will be conducted on Thursday andFriday. A vendor fair and software and hardware demos are scheduledfor Saturday.To get KFest info by email, subscribe to the KansasFest InformationMailing List.  Send email to majordomo@trenco.gno.org.

Think you'repretty hot? Well, here's your chance to prove it!This year, I thought it would be an interesting "diversion" to have acontest featuring the latest and greatest game for the GS to come along inyears...the long-awaited, much-anticipated Wolfenstein 3D! If you wouldlike to find out just how good you are, here are the (tentative) rules:1. One or more accelerated GS's (mine will be available) will be set up   for players to use. (If someone would like to volunteer a Power Mac with   Bernie and Wolf 3D on it, that might be nice, also. :)  An "anonymous"   scenario of not more than 10 levels will be chosen for the contest.2. Players will proceed to play this scenario from scratch (basic   weapons/ammo configuration) and with NO CHEAT CODES! The game will open   with the default screen size (#4), but contestants may adjust the screen   size to suit individual preferences.3. Players may NOT save their games at each level! If you get "killed",   you must start that level over from scratch. (However, if it becomes   necessary for a player to interrupt the game, for some reason, it will   be permissable to save the game to resume at a later time.)4. When the game is completed (when the victory banner is displayed),   players will record their final scores on the provided scoresheet.5. The winner will be determined by the highest final score. In the event   of a tie, contestants will play a tie-breaker round of one level chosen   by a "referee".I think that this will give us a pretty level playing field for thecontest.

After carefully readingthe specifics, if youre interested, please contact Mike Westerfield bye-mail at MikeW50@AOL.COM, sending the completed form at the end of thisannouncement.The Program-----------The program is GSoft BASIC, an interpreted BASIC for the Apple IIGS. Itsupports many advanced features, a few not found in any other BASIC wereaware of on any platform. Some of the major features are:* Multiple number formats, including BYTE, INTEGER, LONG, SINGLE and  DOUBLE.* Program and variable size is limited only by available RAM.* Optional line numbers.* PRINT USING.* Modern structured statements, like IF-THEN-ELSE and WHILE-WEND.* Disk input and output commands.* Support for types, records and pointers.* True subroutines and functions, with passed parameters and local  variables.* Toolbox access, including good support for user tools.* Full screen editor.* Supports ORCA compatible debuggers.Beta Tester Background----------------------Beta testers must have the following minimum background and equipment:1. A familiarity with BASIC.2. An Apple IIGS with at least 1.125M of RAM and a hard drive.3. The ability to download binary attachments to e-mail sent over America   Online. (You dont need to be on AOL, but beta updates will be sent via   AOL.)4. A mailing address in the US or Canada.Other things that would be a plus are:1. Already familiar with ORCA languages.2. Experience at toolbox programming on the Apple IIGS.3. Experience with pointers and records in Pascal or C.4. A printer.What You Will Need to Do------------------------As a beta tester, you will be asked to:1. Read about 300 pages of documentation cover to cover in about 2 weeks,   making corrections and comments. The annotated pages must be returned to   the Byte Works.2. Try the program on your computer, running our test suite.3. Write at least one small program from scratch. We dont need the program,   we need your comments on GSoft BASIC as you write it.4. Send your comments and suggestions to us by e-mail.What You Will Get-----------------We hope you will beta test for the opportunity to shape this new program.In addition, anyone who sends back annotated documentation pages by mailand bug reports by e-mail will receive a commercial copy of GSoft BASICwhen it is released, as well as one additional Byte Works product of yourchoice with a GS-catalog number.We will also publicly acknowledge your contributions in the printedmanual--assuming, of course, that we get your comments by the deadline!Time Table----------8 June -- Beta testers will be selected on this date. An initial e-mailwill be made on this date, and the documentation will be sent by mail.22 June -- Annotated documentation must be mailed back to the Byte Works bythis date. We will supply a prepaid mailer.29 June -- Feature freeze. All comments and suggestions that requirechanges to documentation must be made by this date to stand any chance ofappearing in the initial release.22 July -- GSoft BASIC will be released at Kansas Fest 98.Nondisclosure-------------Beta testing is a privilege. It is for the benefit of the Byte Works, andlater, for the benefit of people who will use the program. All comments andopinions about the program must be kept private, shared only with the ByteWorks and the other beta testers, until the planned release date.Anyone who comments on this program publicly in any way, even to the extentof announcing they are a beta tester, before 22 July 1998 will beimmediately dropped from the beta test list. They will be asked to returnall materials concerning GSoft BASIC to the Byte Works, and will notreceive a free commercial copy of the program or an additional product.By applying as a beta tester, you are agreeing to abide by these terms.Beta Test Application---------------------PersonalName:Street Address:City:State:Zip Code:E-mail:Day Phone:Apple IIGS InformationROM number:RAM:Hard disk?Color monitor?Printer?

I'm not on a real tight time frame to finish this project, butI would like to start making some real progress on it. I imagine that,since I'm no programmer, this will seem a simple task to most here, butwould appreciate any help. I considered posting this in A2, but feel thatit belongs here. If someone disagrees, I'll be happy to move it to A2.The issue, in its' simpleist description, is creating a spreadsheet thatcalculates time worked, money earned for that time, etc. The interfaceneeds to be simple enough where any user, computer illiterate or not, cansimply enter the start time and end time of a shift in decimal form (i.e.8.2 starting time = 08:12 in real time).At work, I'm using MS Excel (since I don't have a choice), but for thepurpose here, any A2gs spreadsheet program will be fine.

This could be part of the 'Name' lookup table, but I         need it displayed in a separate column. This also determines the         'Base Rate of Pay', probably needed in a lookup table.Scheduled Shift Start = Scheduled Start Time for the named employee.                        Frequently, shifts change at the last moment, hence                        the requirement for 'Actual Shift Start'. The entry                        format needs to be in decimal form, i.e. "8.2"                        equals 08:12am, 23.0 = 11:00pm, etc.Scheduled Shift End = Same requirements as 'Scheduled Shift Start' above.Actual Shift Start = Same requirements as 'Scheduled Shift Start' above.Actual Shift End = Same requirements as 'Scheduled Shift Start' above.Straight Time (ST) = Total time between 'Shift Start' and 'Shift End' after                subtracting 'Lunch Time' (below) from the total. If there                are no entries in the 'Actual' fields, then the 'Scheduled'                fields are assumed. Also, if the total exceeds '8.0' hours,                the remainder needs to list in the 'OT' column. If the 'OT'                column exceeds '4.0' hours, the remainder needs to list in                the 'DT' column.Overtime (OT) = Any 'time' that exceeds 8.0 hours in the 'ST' column.           Again, if the 'OT' column exceeds 4.0 hours, the remainder           goes to the 'DT' column.Doubeltime (DT) = Any 'time' that exceeds 4.0 hours in the 'OT' column.Total Time (TT) = Totals of 'ST', 'OT', and 'DT', again, in decimal format.OT/DT Approved By: = Initials of a particular supervisor, provided by a                     'lookup' table.Shift Premium = If equal to '1', no premium if between the hours of 5.0 to                15.9. If equal to '2', a premium of $.25 is used between                the hours of 16.0 to 21.9. If equal to '3', a premium of                $.40 is used between the hours of 22.0 to 5.0. Again, if                'Actual Start Time' is empty, then 'Scheduled Start                Time' is assumed. These rates should probably go into a                lookup table also, as these rates change with each new                contract (about every 3 years).Lead = A $.75 premium/hour is paid for all hours listed in this column.       (A lookup table again?)General Foreman = A $1.15 premium/hour is paid for all hours listed in                  in this column. (A lookup table again?)High Pay = Think of this as 'danger' pay. A $2.40 premium/hour is paid for           all hours listed in this column. (A lookup table again?)Lunch Time = A column to notate how long the employee was on lunch, to be             deducted from the 'ST' column before listing.Penalty Time = If this entry is empty, no penalty time was permitted. If               this column has an entry, $20/hr added for each .5/hr               listed.Money Due for Penalty = Total of calculation from the 'Penalty Time'                        column. (A lookup table again?)Comments = Simply a field to enter explanation if any of the above does not           meet the criteria, i.e. if 'Scheduled Start Time' does not match           the 'Actual Start Time' (if an employee is 'late', 'sick',           went home early, etc.).This should easily get us started. ;-) Perhaps the way to approach this is'one-by-one'. The name and status columns =probably= require a large'lookup' table, so let's skip that for now. The area I've had the mostproblems with is letting the computer do the time calculations accurately.To explain, let me point out where I've stumbled in trying to make thiswork. One would initially think that a simple '=sum(End Time - Start Time)'would generate the proper entry in ST; in many cases it would, i.e. EndTime = 23.5 and Start Time = 15.0, then ST = 8.0 after subtracting .5 forlunch. However, if the employee's Start Time = 23.0 and their End Time =06.5, then a negative number is realized, leaving the =very= poor employeeowing money to the employer!So, if agreed, can we work on this problem first? I've =toyed= with using'ABS' in the spreadsheet to avoid the negative number, but I continue toget inconsistent totals. If I were using Basic, I'd write it like this...Let X = Start TimeLet Y = End TimeIf X>Y then ST=X-Y : ST=Y-XST=ST - Lunch TimeIf ST>8.0 then OT=ST-8.0 : ST=8.0 : If OT>4.0 then DT=OT-4.0 : OT=4.0TT=ST+OT+DTKeep in mind that the above calculation is based on 'Scheduled Start/EndTimes' =unless= 'Actual Start/End Times' are entered. If there are entriesin the 'Actual' columns, then the 'Scheduled' columns are ignored.Now, help me get that into a spreadsheet calculation and we'll move ontosome more interesting 'logic' fiascos!Jeff CarrCruising the 'rainbow' path provided by:Spectrum v2.1 and Crock O' Gold v2.5                        (LUMITECH, 1891, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Since you are using 24 hr. time, shouldn't be too hard."""""1.)

While the Apple IIadvocate in me screams out to tell you to do whatever you can to come,there will always be those who cannot make it.  If you fall into thiscategory, what's the next best thing?     The answer: KansasFest on the web!     There are several sites on the World Wide Web which promote or reviewor otherwise provide coverage of the Apple II event of the year.  If you'restuck at home in mid-July rather than sweating it out in Kansas City,perhaps viewing these sites will satisfy your Apple II urge for this year.     The Official KansasFest Web Page lives at:     http://www.primenet.com/~adams/kfest.html     You'll find all the basics of KFest information right here, from whereto sign up (and an online sign up form) to dates, locations, names, mailinglist info. . . you name it, it's right here.  David Kerwood, the prodigiousDiveMaster, is the webmaster for this site.     While it's well-known that KFest attendees tend to only use the word"sleep" followed by the words "what's that", many people don't realize thatin addition to having fun, real work is taking place.  The aforementionedDavid Kerwood spent much of his time at the last two KFests giving updatedreports to the world at large via the A2-Web page.  The URL for viewingthese is:     http://www.syndicomm.com/a2web/kfest.html     One of the real Kansans who finally made his way to KFest this pastyear was Kirk Mitchell, a member of the A2 Geek Gang.  Kirk had so much funat KFest '97 he took a bunch of pictures with his digital camera anduploaded them to his Web page, then got blatantly plugged in the majorApple II publications, so he spruced things up a little.  You can see hiswork at:     http://moscow2.pld.com/kfest97/     Geoff Weiss was relatively anonymous back at KFest '96, before hebecame relatively famous as the co-author of _Spectrum Internet Suite_, theseed of which was planted at Avila College.  Prior to _SIS_ making it outthe door, Geoff wrote a review of KansasFest '96 and posted it on his Webpage.  Check it out at:     http://www.gwlink.net/geoff/kf96.html     There are other KFest Web pages around the world, for sure, as well asreviews in the Apple II publications (including _GenieLamp A2_).  And thereis always fun mail on the KFest Mailing List, which we've discussed in thiscolumn in the past.  If you're looking for more KFest on the World WideWeb, I suggest you use the links from the pages above.  If you choose to,you can use an Internet search engine like snap.com; searching on the term"kansasfest" will net you much better results than searching on "kfest".     Finally, I'd like to remind you that the best virtual KFest is notvirtual at all--it's actually being at Avila to see hardware that was nevermade, programs that could never be done, and celebrate the computer thatstarted it all: the Apple II.  Join us while you still can.  Every KFestneeds to be treated like it's the last--celebrate the Apple II like there'sno tomorrow.  Apple II Forever!         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :         When in doubt, make it configurable.          :         :                                                       :         :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: GOLDFISCHE :::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
