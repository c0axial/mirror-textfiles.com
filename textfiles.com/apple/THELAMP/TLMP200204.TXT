It was built in 1927 as an "atmospheric" movietheater.  An elaborate organ console finished in a beautiful ivory colorcomes up out of the floor near the stage when the organ is needed.  Thewalls are decorated with detailed painting of molded plaster designs.Surrounding the balcony are the shapes and lights of a nighttime view of aPersian village.  The ceiling is made of dark blue velvet with a multitudeof small blinking lights (twinkling stars).  Projection of slowly movingclouds across the ceiling completes the illusion of being outdoors on adelightful evening.     This theater was owned by a series of theater companies over theyears.  It was donated to the city several years ago.  Slowly it wasfalling into a state of disrepair.  There were those who advocated tearingit down.  But there was this couple who had the vision and leadershipability to muster a campaign to raise the money needed to refurbish thisbeautiful theater.  Two years ago it reopened with great fanfare.  It nowserves as a place to present symphonies, rock concerts, broadway plays...even old silent movies accompanied by that great organ.                                Classic A2                                ~~~~~~~~~~     Over the years the message boards and file collections at GEnie A2 andA2 Pro, followed by Delphi A2 and A2 Pro, grew to great proportions throughthe contributions of many people.  Then there were those that kept thosecollections organized and archived.  Add the foresight of those whodownloaded these files and message archives in preparation for the day thatthey would no longer be available from GEnie or Delphi.     Hats off to Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd for his vision and leadership inacquiring and rebuilding Syndicomm Online.  A great place to chat, exchangemessages, and have access to those A2 files and message archives.                          K-Fest, Another Classic                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     KansasFest 2002 is scheduled for July 23 through 28.  The committeehas been working hard to provide another great K-Fest.  We would reallylike to see you there.

I suppose it should be moved toanother topic, but here goes.My testing shows that even if _both_ creator is changed to 'pdos' and filetype changed to 'TEXT' (or even $04 for ProDOS TXT type, please don't makeme figure the auxtype <g> ), a copy of a non-forked text file from the MacOS Finder to a ProDOS formatted diskette (or ProDOS formatted disk imagefor floppy-less newer Macs such as your Blue&White) results in the copiedfile now containing both a Data and Resource fork, with the Resource forksize being '0'.Please humor me and create a one line text file in ProTerm Mac. It will bea non-forked file. First save (from within ProTerm Mac) the file (TEST1) tothe Mac Desktop. Then save (from within ProTerm Mac) the same file (TEST2)to a ProDOS formatted floppy or floppy image.Now, quit ProTerm Mac and copy the file (using the Finder) on the MacDesktop (TEST1) to either your ProDOS formatted floppy or floppy image.Feel free to change the creator and file types before copying, but I'vefound it makes no difference.Now, launch Bernie and mount the floppy or floppy image. Then use yourchoice of programs, (mine is AppleWorks5.1) to load and/or examine thefiles. I think you'll notice that TEST1 (copied to ProDOS from the Finder)is forked, while TEST2 (copied to ProDOS from ProTerm) is not. If your copyof AppleWorks has the Timeout Accessory 'Datafile', it will list the sizesof the data and resource forks on forked files. Also, AppleWorks (as wellas other 8-bit programs) will not load TEST1, but work just fine withTEST2.I'm using Mac OS 8.6, but I don't believe things have changed for 9.x.Again, thanks for your indulgence. This problem is irritating and I'm stillscratching my head as to why it would exit at all.If after you've duplicated the above listed procedure you've found a methodthat overcomes the problem, please let me know.Hugh...(HUGHHOOD, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 298)>>>>>"""""Here are the results of my tests using a one line file saved and dragged indifferent combinations:Saving to the Mac desktop (zero resource fork by default) and dragging to aProDOS floppy, shows a resource fork on the IIgs. Dragging the same file toan HFS disk does not.Saving directly from ProTerm Mac to either a ProDOS floppy or an HFS disk,does not show a resource on the IIgs.I usually use HFS disks to save to as for my uses they are more flexiblethan ProDOS, and Bernie is quite happy with either type. In fact I usuallykeep a Mac RAM disk running for the easy transfer of files to and from thetwo environments.The answer therefore is to use an HFS floppy rather than a ProDOS floppy.There is another factor to consider. Files dragged over from the Macdesktop can sometimes end up with a filetype of $00 on the IIgs. I foundthis out quite early on, so in general, Spectrum will open a file of type$00 as if it were a text file, but other programs may refuse to see it. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Mon 25 Mar 2002 - 120 days till KFest '02 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum v2.5.2 & SOAR 1.0b5 Setup: Bernie ][ the Rescue 3.0 and a dual G4/800Mhz GeForce3 http://www.ewannop.btinternet.co.uk/(CONDUCTOR, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 299)>>>>>"""""I agree the whole forked file thing is a pita for 8-bit users.

This was a commercial product fromCOMPUTER:applications, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina.  I don't know muchabout the capabilities of this emulator but it was designed to run the B&WMacintosh Plus era machines.  This even predates the IIe Card for the MacLC which is kind of neat.  From what I've heard this emulator is slow witha number of bugs.As far as I can tell, ][ in a Mac and the IIe card were the only games intown on the Mac side until 1994.  Kevin Lund and Jim Nitchals released"Stop The Madness" as a public beta in February with the intent of creatinga commercial product.  STM was an Apple ][ plus emulator that ran on 68KMacintoshes. They opened cassandra.ucr.edu ftp site requesting softwareuploads to further beta testing.  As you can probably guess, this quicklygot out of hand as cassandra.ucr.edu quickly became one of the first warezsites for Apple II software.  In the end they closed the site and nevercompleted the project.  Rumors abound that Kevin was working on a PPCnative version of STM but that project never came to light.There were a few II+/IIe emulators that followed but were overshadowed bythe December 1996 open beta for "Fast Eddie", a full Apple IIGS emulator.As most of you know, this evolved into "Bernie ][ The Rescue" and emulationon the Macintosh has never been quite the same since.  Written by AndreHorstmann and Henrik Gudat, Bernie got so good, so quick that it put aplanned IIGS emulator, Gus, from Dave Lyons and Andy Nicholas (of AppleComputer) on the back burner.Mark Percival - Syndicomm.com Apple II RTC Host"Midweek Madness!" every Wednesday night.7:00 PM - 9:00 PM PDT(MARK, Cat 29, Top 3, Msg 7)[EOA][WGC]WRITING GS CODE"""""""""""""""Man, I wish I had time to code.

This allows you to filter your ownmail if you want to, but doesn't force our decisions about what messagesare spam on each of you.We are now doing lookups against the following DNSBL lists:DNSBL service:                   Inserted header name:inputs.orbz.org                  X-Spam-ORBZInputs:relays.visi.com                  X-Spam-RSL:dialups.relays.osirusoft.com     X-Spam-OsiruDUL:inputs.relays.osirusoft.com      X-Spam-OsiruInputs:bl.spamcop.net                   X-Spam-SpamCop:The header actually inserted into your email will look something like this:X-Spam-ORBZInputs: Blacklisted by inputs.orbz.org, seehttp://orbz.org/b.php?www.xxx.yyy.zzzwhere www.xxx.yyy.zzz will normally be the IP address of the server that'slisted, so you can look and see what info they have listed about it.If your email program supports filtering mail by the presence of headers inthe messages, you can then filter on the ones you wish to filter on.Before deciding whether or not to filter on a specific blackhole list, youshould probably investigate what types of things are blocked on each list.The best way to do this is by checking each of their websites:http://www.orbz.org/http://relays.osirusoft.com/http://www.spamcop.net/http://relays.visi.com/We may at some point be able to offer a way to filter it server-side basedon individual user preferences, but that's likely a ways off as it'llrequire a little programming on our part. :-)Since all we're doing at this point is adding headers to the email, and notactually rejecting anything, I have no problems with adding any other blocklists anyone knows of that they'd like us to add to it.

If your looking for something inexpensive though (i.e. free), thestandard Apple 1MB memory card will give you enough RAM to run 99.9% ofIIgs software out there. I'd recommend 2-4MB RAM however if your going toinstall GS/OS on a hard drive.To check your total amount of RAM (beside lifting the lid and peekinginside) access the Control Panel by pressing and holding Apple + Control +Esc. Select Control Panel, then select RAM Disk and look at the amountindicated next to 'Largest Selectable'.

I'm trying to track down why.Marinetti has multiple code segments. A jump table that Marinetti uses hasentries in it from multiple segments. One such jump table entry begins atthe first byte of a segment.What would you expect to see in the Jump Table for this entry?Orca Disassembler can be used to inspected the code segment that containsthe Jump Table. T other entries in the jump table are like this:ea 03 00 00 ac 03 00 0027 02 00 00 ...However, the entry for the start of segment contains FF FF FF 00When the Marinetti Init is loaded and the jump table entries are relocated,the start of segment entry is pointing at 05/965B.  However the actual codefor this entry is at 04/965B.  That is, the jump table entry is out by onebank.Perhaps this is a segment loader/relocation issue?I have spent a day trying to understand the OMF format and wondering how Ican trace the relocation dictionary as it does its stuff. The Relocationdictionary entry for this jump table entry is:F6 ;Compressed INTERSEG record03 ;# bytes to update00 ;# bits to shift addressD7 06 ;offset of update location in TCPIP segment ($6D7)03 ;segment to point to (DNR)FF FF ;offset into DNR segmentI've given up chasing this down. I worked around it by linking in somedummy code so that the entry point was no longer at the beginning of thesegment.I'm not sure why it works on some systems and not on others.Anybody have any ideas?Cheers,Andrew(ROUGHANA, 415.1, Delphi A2 Pro web side)>>>>>"""""While continuing development in completely unrelated areas, I stumbledacross Apple IIgs Technote #73 which has this to say:===Note: Because of the way the tool dispatcher transfers control to toolboxfunctions, a function's entry point must not be at the first byte of a bank($xx0000).
