Blatant Plug:this product will be available exclusively through _Juiced.GS_, as will newversions of _The Compleat Lamp!_.     In any case, as I recover from weeks travelling the North Americancontinent, meeting old friends and making new ones, and, oh yeah, fromKansasFest 2000, it's back to what's important: the Apple II and _TheLamp!_.  One of the highlights of my trip to Avila this summer was thechance to meet Lyle in person.  That reaffirmed what I already knew: I leftyou all in good hands.  We talked business, talked computers, but mostlyjust had fun.  Which is what the Apple II is all about these days.     Just like it was back in 1977.     In addition to those new products, I'm also going to start putting outa short monthly newsletter called _A2 News and Notes_.  Expect it aroundthe beginning of each month.  Unlike _The Lamp!_, reproduction permissionis quite liberal (well, maybe more like _The Lamp!_--I'll give Lyle theopportunity to fill you in) so you newsletter editors can stop looking fora few less news items each month.     Finally, concluding with our "What's old is new and what's new is old"theme, I'd like to let you all in on a secret: A2Central.com, one of thenewest World Wide Web sites for the Apple II, is going to be one of thehottest spots on the Internet in the coming months.  I plan to devote moreand more of our energies here at _The Lamp!_ toward making it a prime moverand shaker in the Apple II online community.     Remember: have fun.Ryanthelamp@sheppyware.net[EOF]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA]DISTILLATIONS from Delphi A2""""""""""""""""""""""""""""by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[NBG]NETBOOTING A IIgs"""""""""""""""""I have recently pulled my old Apple IIgs out of the closet and triedsetting it up.

My question is this: is there an alternative toAppleShare 3.0 which will allow me to boot a ROM 03 IIgs over a AppleTalk,or, if there is not, is there any way to acquire a copy of AppleShare 3.0?(NCHAIMOV, 31837, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""> is there an alternative to AppleShare 3.0 which will allow me to boot> a ROM 03 IIgs over a AppleTalk,Nope.> or, if there is not, is there any way to acquire a copy of AppleShare> 3.0?On the used market. Ryan M.

I thought ofa way to use a Mac hard disk. Details are currently vague, but it involvedusing the System 6.0.1 installer to create a boot 3.5" floppy that hadAppleTalk support.  I booted the floppy and connected to the Mac throughthe localtalk network.  I could then run programs on the Mac hard drive. Ihad to do very careful pruning, though to fit everything on, so I wanted togo one extra step: deleting the Finder from the boot disk and running aprogram launcher that was on the Mac.  Problems: the Finder won't workoutside of its usual location in the System Folder.  Wings works, but onlywith ProDOS volumes. (not ideal).  JumpStart, which I believe is nowfreeware, worked like a charm. I set that as my startup program and I hadthe poor man's AppleShare.As I say, this was some time ago and the details of what settings I used onthe Mac and GS are vague.  I hope that they give enough clues to let youfigure out the steps.  Take notes, and let me know how it works out :-)-Gareth(GARETH, 31902, GO COM A2)[EOA][SCH]SILVERN CASTLE HELP"""""""""""""""""""> ...where all can you get Silvern Castle?To the best of my knowledge, SC can be downloaded from Delphi and Trenco(www.gno.org).

It gives you options to undo some of the"complications"like using gold, silver, and copper coins (or just goldcoins), or using the encumbrance feature or not. I turned off coins butleft encumbrances. That's nice, I thing it doesn't detract from the game.But I still need to find a password for the moat area. I have gottenthrough the bubbles. I see no clues really, obvious or otherwise. This partof games I am a dunce at. I never even bothered to try Myst, though myfamily bought it.The game also seems speeded up. Is that true? I seems to run smoother andfaster. Otherwise I see no obvious differences.Is anyone else playing and has anyone gotten beyond the coded door?BTW: I used the upgrade found on the Juiced-GS disks.Bruce(BRB, 32473, GO COM A2)>>>>>""""">But I still need to find a password for the moat area.Sorry this took so long, I was away this past week...Hi Bruce!I would have e-mailed this to you, but perhaps others would also like thishelp getting past the new extended scenario stuff added in v3.0 and later.NOTE: This gives away vital clues!!! If you want to solve Silvern Castle onyour own STOP NOW!!!To solve the extended scenario so you can play the second scenario you mustget into the moat (note: you must teleport to any illegal location andyou'll be dropped in the moat-try 11 levels down).When you get past the bubbles you come up to a metal gate, if you haveregistered your copy you'll be able to get through into an underwatercavern.Note: If you have registered make sure your serial number shows up at thetitle page-if not reenter your registration password and serial number.Once in the underwater cavern it leads to a door with needs the new applekey to open. Note: To get the key, on level 10 behind the locked doorneeding the silver key (there's only one-it's the door that used to lead tothe back way to Drachma's Lab) you'll get the skeleton key from the MAChigh-priest. Use the skeleton key to open any of the doors on level 1-10that couldn't be opened before (hint: there's one just a little north ofthe MAC priest). Behind any skeleton key door will get you a li-powercrystal. Take the crystal to the head guru on level 1 and you'll get theapple key plus some hints about the moat.Back to the moat. Using the apple key you enter an airlock. To the north ofthe airlock is a door with an access device requiring a password. Note:There is a secret door-that does not show up using the light spell. Behindthe secret door(s) is part of the password. This should be enough clues toget past the access device.The stuff past the access device should be easier. Ultimately it leads toDrachma's Lab-be sure to do this to get hints on the second scenario. Also,remember secret doors don't show up in the moat and watch-out forteleporters (must should be visible as a white square in v5.0 andlater-before this they don't).What about that blue archway? Hint: Defeat Drachma.Hope this helps,Jeff Fink(ROFFERSD, 32531, GO COM A2)[EOA][SCU]SILVERN CASTLE v5.0 AVAILABLE IN DATA BASE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Name: SCUPD50.BXY (Entertainment Software) Date: 2-AUG-2000 23:45   By: HKATZ Size: 209536Silvern Castle, the popular role-playing game for 8-bit Apple II computersreleased only a year ago at KFest '99, has been updated to version 5.0!

I never thought about it. Do I have to enhancethe II+ in order to get Prodos working or would a little programmingenhancement in DOS 3.3 help seeing the Hard Disk ?Any help would be appreciated,Claudio(CRISTINZ, 31870, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""I'm running a hard drive on a II+. I'm using an Apple Rev C SCSI cardconnected to a 40mb hard drive. I use a program called Sneeze as a programlauncher. Pretty well all the programs on the hard drive are ProDOS 8programs.  The only enhancement you need for ProDOS is to have 64k ofmemory. With 64k and a 6502 you can use any version of ProDOS up to andincluding 1.9. If you replace the 6502 with a 65C02 or are using anaccelerator such as a ZipChip or TransWarp which include a 65C02 the youcan use the last version of ProDOS 2.0.3.  DOS 3.3 is basicallyincompatible with drives over 400k. Some DOS 3.3 stuff can be transferredover to ProDOS and some can't. I generally leave the DOS 3.3 stuff onfloppies and boot them if I want to run DOS 3.3 stuff. However a hard driveis so much faster and more convenient that it isn't long before you onlywant to run stuff off the hard driveWayne(WAYNEJ, 31883, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""> Is it possible to connect a Hard Disk to an Apple II+ ?Yep. You should just know that in terms of a SCSI setup, your options arelimited to the original Apple ("Revision C") SCSI card, or similar, such asthe older CMS SCSI card.If your going to use ProDOS (which isn't a bad idea considering DOS 3.3 islimited to 400K per partition and no subdirectories/folders) you'll need atleast 64K RAM installed--that is all the RAM sockets populated on the IIPlus board (48K total) in addition to a 16K Language card or better pluggedinto slot-0.There may be other hard drive setups available for the II Plus, though I'muncertain if things like the Focus HD or Vulcan are compatible (most peopleadding hard drives do so to an Enhanced IIe or better).Mitchell Spector {<mailto:cw308@torfree.net> cw308@torfree.net}(SPECTOR1, 31890, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""I once had a 40MB Applied Engineering IIe/II+ Vulcan hard drive that wouldwork with any IIe or a II+.

From my experience there are two major "what if"'sinvolved, their being: 1) Will the brand/model in question read all typesof CD-R's (there are many burnable CD's with a color coating the laser hastrouble seeing on some drives) and 2) Will you be able to play back audioCD's through the IIgs?Finding out #1 is mostly trial and error, although if your only going to bereading factory pressed (silver colored) CD's this isn't an issue. As for#2 if you have an Apple SCSI card you _will_ need an Apple brand CD-ROMdrive (i.e. CDSC, CDSC+, CD-150) for audio. The RamFAST has drivers forplaying audio CDs on Apple and non-Apple drives, but they can be ratherflaky. I was able to get a Chinon 1X to play audio with the RamFAST, but itfroze up control of the computer until I ejected the disc.> Also the Apple High Speed SCSI will work with CD-ROM's but is the> "HIGH SPEED" SCSI card the only one to use?I believe the Apple revision 'C' card will work, but you'd have to rebootwhenever changing discs (the card isn't very friendly with removabledevices if I recall correctly). The RamFAST will certainly work, but whenit comes to playing audio CDs things can get iffy. I've heard many reportsabout the NEC 2x working beautifully with audio discs though.I'm not sure if cards such as the CMS, Ohio Kache SCSI or Cirtech work well(if at all) with CD-ROMs and other removable devices. My guess is if theydo, it would be similar in function to the Apple Rev.C (I generally don'trecommend anything but the Apple or RamFAST when it comes to SCSI boards,although some people have gotten good use out of the others).Mitchell Spector {<mailto:cw308@torfree.net> cw308@torfree.net}(SPECTOR1, 32119, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""I'm using a Ramfast on both my IIgs & IIe with NEC CD-ROMs. I tried acouple of other brands (wish I could remember the names) and while both ofthem seemed to work fine as far as reading files and playing music the onething they wouldn't do was boot off any of the ProDOS CDs I'd burned.

Software is the *MOST*important of factors when considering a computer's strength, it is the lifeblood of that machine. Features and processing power don't mean a thing ifthere's no software to make that collection of chips do anything (manygreat computers fell wayside because they lacked software, the IIGSsuffered for this reason). One of the reasons the Apple II was, and alwayshas been, popular, is because of it's vast amount of software available.So where are we today? Are there ANY companies still printing copies ofthose tens of thousands of software packages? _No._ So we're left withcopies that haven't been sold yet. Are there any stores or vendors sellingthose out-of-print titles, the few that remain? _No._ Sure, thereadmittedly are a few seeded businesses here and there, but these sourcesare far and few between and depleting what stock they have left. Quiteoften these sources don't have what your looking for, which means you'llhave to find the titles used at garage sales, thrift shops or onlineauctions and sales. Quite often you'll turn up empty handed looking for aparticular title.Take AppleWorks, hands down one of the most popular Apple II softwarepackages, yet it's not available any longer--anywhere. The problem I see issomeone comes along and purchases a used Apple II, looks for particularsoftware, can't find it in stores, through vendors nor used through onlinesales either. That person is then forced to give up on the Apple II andmove on to another platform because they can't find software. It's likewe're saying "There's no more room for new users--the software you wantisn't available anymore and it's just too bad you'll need it to operate themachine." Sometimes people ask me where they can get games for their AppleIIe or IIgs. I direct them to Shareware Solutions II, which sells 3 or 4commercial games, but beyond that I have to them they'll have to look forused copies online. That's basically one step away from saying "Tough, youshould have bought games a decade ago, and if you can't find them now,that's not my problem. Now excuse me while I go play Zany Golf, Immortaland Task Force."I obviously do not endorse piracy, nor do I think copyrights are somethingthat become meaningless once a title goes out of print. I just think manyof us are looking at this as too black and white an issue. We're upholdingcopyright laws by saying you can't copy such and such a title that's nolonger printed-- which is fine, but at the same time we're shrugging ourshoulders and saying 10,000+ software titles are only available to those ofus who bought them and now the door is closed to anyone else. I sometimesquestion if we're doing the right thing. I mean without software, the AppleII is not much more than an interesting piece of history. An artifact, anicknack to store in the closet. I think it's still a useful computer anduse mine, I just wish others could too and enjoy the same software I had tochance to use.I'm glad there are people going to great pains to get much of the morepopulate software legally reclassified, though much of the software willremain in limbo, probably forever. Should we just say the hell with it andtell people copy whatever they want then? I don't think so, but I'm notsure this is doing much towards the continued use and popularity of theApple II. We're sort of damned we you do, and damned we don't.To get to the bottom line here, I'm worried that those titles willphysically disappear one day soon (disk media doesn't last forever, nordoes software people throw away) and one day we could find the Apple IIwith little or no software available to _anyone_. I like the fact Asimovwas making an effort to archive and preserve 8-bit Apple II programs(mostly games though) but I don't like the fact the archive is available toANY anonymous person in the world. I'd like to see clean preserved copiesof Apple II software stored safely somewhere on long-lasting media, just soit's there in the future and not gone forever because of disk rot. Itshould just be in the hands of someone official and trusted, not madeaccessible to every person in the world--that oversteps the lines ofpreservation to blatant piracy. Just thought I'd share my thoughts on this,I hope no one views this the wrong way...Mitchell Spector {<mailto:cw308@torfree.net> cw308@torfree.net}(SPECTOR1, 32258, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""Excellent post Mitch! I think you've really "hit the nail on the head" withregards to the problems faced by our favorite computer.

If someone were collecting allavailable software, verifying that the disk images were good, and puttingit on some permanent media to preserve it for the future, that would befine.The problem (I'm agreeing with Mitch, here) is when the files in thatarchive are made publicly available.Perhaps what the Apple II community needs is an archive site that accepts(and verifies) uploads, but ONLY permits downloads of stuff that has arelease from the copyright holder, and has that release included with thearchive.Gary R.

It's a straw man put up by thepirates to defend their actions.There are plenty of people who are working HARD, most of them on avolunteer basis, to keep Apple II software available to new users.The Treasure Chest Project and the Lost Classics Project have the specificgoal of obtaining copyright releases on commercial software, and they WORKat it. There are other people who work on the same goal as individuals,contributing when and where they can.Joe Kohn and a few others have gathered up lots of old stock and canlegitimately sell it (for next to nothing) without any copyright hassles.> "I think we should do everything we can to bring people into the fold."For many years there were people in Syndicomm who were charged withbuilding and distributing (to those who requested them) disks of basicApple II software, including freeware communications programs, wordprocessors, and, of course, operating system disks. It wasn't our goal tosupply them with all their software needs, just to give them enough to getstarted, and information on where to find more. ("teach a man to fish")> "I think too many people just give up without ever trying to contact the> copyright holders."I think too many people never try in the first place and simply go aheadand pirate stuff, and then spend all their time telling the world howwonderful they are for making it available.> "If we had a list, an organization, a Project, that would go a long way> both in actually getting software back into distribution legally..."As I have said a couple of times, we have at least TWO Projects aimed atgetting permissions (in writing, publishable) and making softwareavailable. The people involved in them could probably use more help.What _I_ am talking about is NOT a project to make software available.Rather, it is a project to PRESERVE software on (more or less) permanentmedia wo that when someone DOES get a permission, the software is notalready lost to bit rot.It would also serve to disarm the pirates who use "preservation" as anexcuse to steal.Gary R.

The "legacy services" including premium homepage services,text-based online service, and Delphi e-mail will be provided on anunsupported basis. If you're being billed monthly, your last bill will befor October. If you paid an annual fee you will receive a pro-rated credit.We're making these changes in order to focus our development and marketingefforts on Delphi's free web-based forum services.  With over 2.5 millionmembers, Delphi.com is now one of the top 150 sites on the web and growingrapidly.The legacy services may remain accessible, however, there will be notechnical support. You should make arrangements as soon as possible get analternative provider -- some options are described at the end of thismessage.  Q & A -(Q) Why is Delphi making these changes?(A) For the past three years, Delphi has focused on building the best forumservices for people with a standard web browser and internet connection.The site has grown to more than 2.5 million members and 80,000 activeforums. In order to maintain our leadership in this market, we must focusour efforts on our strengths. The text-based services, e-mail services andpremium homepage services are all based on a technical platform that cannotbe maintained on a cost-effective basis. (Q) What exactly are "Text Online Services", "Premium Homepages" and"Delphi E-mail"?(A) Depending on what type of account you opened and when, you may not evenbe familiar with all of these terms. The Text Online Service was offered asDelphi's primary service through the late 80s and early 90s. Prior to nowwe've chosen to maintain this service and construct a "bridge" between theold text interface and the newer web-based forums.  This has becomeimpractical and too costly to support. The Premium Homepages were initiallyoffered in 1997 and 1998 and included special authoring tools andadditional storage for building homepages for a fee.  Delphi E-mail is anyaccount that uses xyz@delphi.com as an e-mail address (e-mail wasoriginally provided in conjunction with Homepages and textonline services). (Q) What does "unsupported" mean?(A) We hope that it means that these services will continue to beaccessible for many months without any fees. If there aren't technicalproblems, then you will be able to use them for free. You won't be able toget technical support either by e-mail or phone so everything will beentirely on an "as available" basis. If something breaks, we may commit theresources to fix it or we may not. It will depend on the time, cost, andlevel of use. (Q) I use the text-based games such as TQ and Scramble on the web. Willthese be discontinued?(A) Since these games are based on the old platform they are prone totechnical problems. Our hope is to continue providing the games, but itwill depend on the technical support costs.  Recommendation for alternative services: E-Mail services: If you use Delphi.com for e-mail (your address issomething@delphi.com), you should immediately set up an e-mail account withany Internet Service Provider or one of the free web-based providers suchas Hotmail (http://www.hotmail.com), Yahoo mail (http://mail.yahoo.com).There is a list of over 5000 Internet Service Providers athttp://www.isps.com. Once you have a new account set up, notify all of yourexisting contacts of your new address. You can arrange for your Delphi.come-mail to be forwarded to your new account by sending a request toservice@delphi.com. Homepage services: you can set up free personal homepages at hundreds ofsites on the web. Some of the most popular include http://www.tripod.com,http://www.homestead.com, http://www.geocities.com,http://www.fortunecity.com, and http://www.xoom.com.We appreciate your support of Delphi over the years and look forward toyour continued participation in Delphi's free forum services athttp://www.delphi.com. Best regards, Rusty WilliamsPresidentDelphi.com Incorporated>>>>> then some comments <<<<<""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Jeff (and everyone)>>"However, if we don't find a new home before the text side stops>> working..."Y'all will remember that Syndicomm was ready when GEnie was dying.

These serviceswill be provided at a small monthly fee (fee to be determined).Other services will likely be added in the future; however, the immediategoal is to prepare A2Central.com to take over Delphi's place in the AppleII community if and when it becomes inaccessible to text-based Apple IIusers.At this time, we have no more specific information available.

Additionally, my test set up here is not currently adequate enoughfor testing a Marinetti production environment.The intention is to release parts of the source for developers to work on,and to feed that back into the next/current Marinetti product. If thisprocess works well, then more source will be released, until the entirecode is freely available. I also see this as an interesting test of opensourcing an Apple II product, which, if works, could be adapted to othercurrently idle Apple II products.There are a number of developers already involved in this project, and theyare currently helping me to develop a plan for release and maintenance ofthe code.Want to help?The Marinetti Open Source Project has a home page (with very little on itat this stage) at: http://www.apple2.org/mospThis announcement was originally posted in Delphi's A2Pro forum.

(Either letter or Email.)5) Prepare the files for upload, including a freeware notice.6) Decide where to upload.  Avoid sites with a questionable reputation.7) Publicize the upload.Individuals can help with any of the steps.  Efforts need to becoordinated.
