A heavy blanket of snow was on the ground... snowsticking to each branch and twig of every tree and shrub.  The total snowaccumulation of eight inches would insure enough snow for the 19th annualSnow Sculpting Contest.     Snow is packed into a wooden form 6 feet by 6 feet by 10 feet tall.The form is lifted from the block of tightly packed snow with a crane andused again and again until a block of snow has been created for each teamthat has registered to compete.     Each team of two to four members has come up with a plan... a drawingand/or a model of the sculpture they hope to create.  On Wednesday, January19 they start their work.  Judging takes place on Saturday... they areunder the gun to finish by then.  The public is invited to view the teamswhile they work... and especially to view the finished sculptures onSunday.     So people are willing to accept the challenge of creating a sculpturefrom a block of snow in three days... knowing that as soon as warm weathersets in their work will be gone... all they will have left are somephotographs and their memory of the event.                            Apple II Challenges                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     After all these years, people are still willing to accept thechallenge of coaxing more from the Apple II computers.  People have createdand are still creating emulators.  People are working on various methods ofgetting the Apple II's online.  Software is being written.  Hardware isunder development.  Quite a legacy![EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[WOC]WHO OWNS THIS CAR?""""""""""""""""""Guys... you will NEVER believe what I found parked a block down from myapartment - I barely could myself:http://www.syndicomm.com/~kgagne/parked/This picture was taken in Worcester, Massachusetts, the morning of Friday,December 10th.Anyone have any idea whose this is??-Ken(KGAGNE, Cat 2, Top 6, Msg 122)>>>>>"""""I can't think of any Apple II users I know in Maine, but that's just offthe top of my head.RyanChief Sysop and Head Elf(A2.RYAN, Cat 2, Top 6, Msg 123)>>>>>"""""I was going to leave a handwritten note with my email address on the car'swindshield, but instead I typed it in Appleworks Classic and printed ascreen shot.

I've been doing anunusual amount of gs programming lately and have some ideas (like a controlpanel to convert filetype/auxtypes to mime strings, mime strings tofiletype/auxtypes, maybe sniff out a suggested filetype/mime string basedon the extension, etc.) that might be useful to discuss.Kelvin(KWS, Cat 50, Top 5, Msg 29)>>>>>"""""I had toyed with a concept similar to that several years ago.  I prettymuch gave up on it since I didn't want to develop the database needed totrack everything I wanted.  And I have since wanted to make the projectbigger than originally expected.I see a need for a generic file type converter.  MIME to GS file type willonly get you so far.  The official list of MIME types have a just a handfulof file types that correspond to a GS file type.  This means that many GSfile types would need to be made into MIME Types too--who wants to gothrough the leg work to make that happen (seehttp://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/mediatypes.pl )?To make it more functional for the GS, the file name extension would beneeded as well to convert between MIME type and GS file type.  Again, thereisn't a one-to-one correlation among these.  For example, looking at a MIMEType entry:MIME Type    extension   GS file type    GS aux typetext/html    .htm        TXT             (not used)             .html             .shtmlBut, if you were to look at a GS file type entry for TXT files, the properextension is .txt (or .text) and the MIME Type is text/plain.It would be important to know if a filetype is "binary" or "text",especially useful for FTP file transfers.  gwftp cheats by having aninternal list--it would be nice if there was something available that wasuser accessible.But something like image/png would have a .png extension, but no equivalentGS file type.  Does this mean the internet-standard file types would needto be created for the GS?  Or use the file type of "unknown" and hope thatusers look at the file extension to know what the file type really is?There is no easy solution, but would make for an easier solution forauthors of internet software to share one common database when moving filesacross mechanisms which all associate file types by different means.I think you can see that this is a topic which I would be interested todiscuss.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 50, Top 5, Msg 31)>>>>>"""""OK, Friday Nights appeared to be the choice of most participants.
