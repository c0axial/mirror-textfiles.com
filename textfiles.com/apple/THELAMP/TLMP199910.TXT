I'll get a chance tocompare Bryan's museum to the Apple II Museum when I run up to San Diegoand hang out with Tony Diaz pre-KFest in July, but for a few hours on a hotSunday in October, I was where I had rarely been anywhere but online inmany years.     I was home.     Thanks to Bryan for putting this on, and for standing by what the restof us believed.     When we said Apple II Forever, we really meant it.                                [*] [*] [*]     I Went Home Department: I announced last month that the December issueof _The Lamp!_ would be the last under my editorship.     Coincidently, in this issue we have the first published Apple IIarticle by Lyle Syverson.     Or maybe it's not much of a coincidence.

Actually, you have a choice of an NDA or a standalone application.Both are here in the A2 database. As I recall, the most recent version ofSpectrum will also handle MIME.With StolenBase (which I generally use, since ANSITerm is my preferredApple II communications program), it is generally sufficient to save theletter containing the text under its own file name. StolenBase can usuallydetect the MIME headers and decode the file. Sometimes, with multiple MIMEenclosures in a file, it may be necessary to edit the mail message toeliminate extraneous stuff before StolenBase can work. Not really difficultto do.MIME files are encoded so that 8-bit data can be sent across systems thatonly support 7-bit data structures. The contents of the encoded file may ormay not be usable on an Apple ][GS. Although there are more options, theseare what I generally use when presented with the contents of a MIME file:Graphics - SuperConvert - can handle GIF or JPEG graphics. For a quick-anddirty look at GIF files, ShowMe! can show some GIF files as well.Text - Generally, MIME-encoded text files are from word processingprograms, sent that way to preserve style information. Unless you get aword processing file that has the text in blocks that you can read (offsetaway from style information), you are pretty much out of luck. The onlyexception would be Rich Text Format (RTF) files. EgoEd 2.0 NDA can do apretty respectable conversion of RTF files, within the limitations of theTeach file format. If the file is not larger than 32K, the RTF translatorfor GraphicWriter III does a bit better job. Early Word 6.0 files wereactually RTF format, so you may get lucky if your correspondent is notusing the most recent version of Word.Don V.

It therefore ignores any text ormessage that precedes those markers...If you are using COG 3.x, and reading mail, then you simply click on the'tick' button to automagically decode an attached file.

Mypoint is that it WAS CIS policy to delete files in the libraries, and itwas a policy that they took seriously.As I recall, some of the MAUG librarians made a point of downloading olderfiles on a regular basis, just to keep the "fresh" for management and bots.Gary R.

Both Bernie and Ernie have takengreat pains to 'emulate' a real IIgs. That means that 'new features' willnot be, and should never be added to the IIgs side, so it changes whatappears as a 'real' IIgs to software.It would be OK to add slot emulation, so 'plug'-in' software could emulateplug in cards, such as the Second Sight card, but it would certainly not beappropriate to build in such emulation directly. The IIgs never had such anscreen emulation, so why should an emulator?As a programmer, I expect a standard IIgs environment when my programs run,not some other computer that might crash my software... Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Wed 1 Sep 1999 - 329 days till Y2KFest Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.2 & Crock O' Gold 3.2 Bernie ][ the Rescue 2.0 woofing at 55Mhz on a G3/350 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                        (EWANNOP, 25499, GO COM A2)NON-UNITED STATES APPLE II USERS   Well.... during my IIGS time I've also""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   bought almost any piece of softwarewhich was developed and sold.

My original plan had"""""""""   been to ship a more comprehensive 1.2 in October, but thisversion fixes a bug that's very annoying and I felt it was worth puttingout an update sooner to get it into users' hands as quickly as possible.Here's what's new:Bugs fixed:1. Fixed a bug in the speed control code that would cause emulation to   randomly pause from time to time.2. Fixed a bug in the ADB code that caused the keyboard to get stuck   repeating.3. Fixed a bug in the ADB code that caused garbage characters to be   returned.Improvements:1. Minor optimizations to the ADB subsystem.2. Added a "Mount as read-only" checkbox to the Mount Disk Image file   panel.3. The Create disk image menu now provides an option to create 100 MB   images.4. You can now select multiple disks to unmount in the Mount Disk Image   file panel.New Features:1. Floppy disks are now pre-cached gradually in the background after you   mount them. This uses a background thread to slowly read in the disk   into the cache so that future reads will be faster; this happens without   any noticeable loss of IIgs CPU performance.2. You can now record movies of Sweet16's video window. Audio isn't   supported yet, and only the large video mode can be recorded. This   requires a lot of processing power and disk speed though, or the entire   system slows down. (16-bit, 640x400 video is very   computationally-intensive to record). You can create movies using any   BeOS supported file format and codec (including QuickTime and AVI,   Indeo, Photo-JPEG, etc).3. Holding down the command (Alt) key when launching Sweet16 starts the   emulator paused. This gives you time to swap out disk images before the   IIgs boots.4. Added the new Disks window. This window shows you the disks you have   mounted, whether or not they're currently running, and how big they are.   You can also eject and mount disks using this window.---Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                        (SHEPPY, 25512, GO COM A2)BERNIE BUMPED TO 2.5   FREE YOUR DATA - BERNIE TOTAL INTEGRATION MAKES ITS""""""""""""""""""""   DEBUTBasel/Switzerland -- 9/21/99 -- F.E.Systems introduced today a major updateto Bernie ][ The Rescue, the emulator that pioneered Apple IIgs emulation.Version 2.5 brings tight integration with MacOS by offering file drag&dropand copy&paste across platforms, among other new features and internalchanges.With "Bernie Total Integration" users can now drag & drop files betweenMacOS and GS/OS with simple mouse clicks.

(Re: Msg 26109)     From: T_DIAZ       To: SPECTOR1 (NR)If you only knew how many vendors were committed to the new Apple II. Ifyou think of the amount of software titles that were never finished in thelater 80's and early 90s (Well, 89-91 actually), I call that the secondwave of ditching.There was a royally F**KED time at Apple they actually, less than 2 yearsafter introduction of the Apple IIgs just like that, dropped a bomb on themarketing of the entire platform and refused to spend any more money on it.They told vendors "No. Do not do that, program it for the Mac ...", etc.Well, guess what. The amount of negative feedback and revolt that the userswho had paid on average of $2,000 for these systems was not something theycould ignore. .. So while vendors decided to 'go where the money was',after a second revival of sorts they ditched again after a dismal showing.Liken that to the Perot presidential campaign. I'm in, I'm out, I'm in, I'mout Well, 19% was a strong showing, but not enough of those that werealienated by the indecision of the past.Yes, the IIgs was 'overhyped', but so is nearly every single product atintroduction. There are a few differences here though:The Amiga has most of it's OS features released with it, the Apple IIgs was2 years behind the OS. I still do believe that we would have never seensystem 6 if Apple had gotten away with it's master plan of ditching aftertwo years.Two years after the Amiga, Commodore was going gung ho still with it, andwhile the C=64 users may have felt they were getting the shaft like the A2users did to the Mac, Commodore was not crapping on them at the same time,like Apple was doing. Some of you may say, "Fine.. look where that gotCommodore", yeah, look where it got Apple too. They were both headed downthe same road. Fortunately for us Apple took the other fork in the road anddid something about it. As for the Amiga, I know several hardcore Amigausers that used it in business. They all switched to Mac because Lightwavewas ported to the Mac.If the Apple IIgs was released with GS/OS instead of that hacked shelladded to a ProDOS 8 core we may be in a different position now. Butanyway..We are the lone holdouts, the Apple II has given me many things, half aremonetary, the rest are the relationships and community. While one hasdwindled the other can last forever.So here we are, and I'll see you next summer in Kansas City!..and KFest is not about making a killing in the bank. One can dreamthough. :)Tony[EOA][A2P]------------------------------                   A2Pro_DUCTIVITY |-----------------------------------Checking out A2PRO on Delphi""""""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

I found thesection in the Orca/C manual how to call the C function so I'm set withthat.The problem is during the linking. I'm getting Unresolved reference Labelerrors for each C function that the assembly code is referencing. I amguessing that I have no idea how to tell the assembly code the labels areto be found in the C code.I have the assembly routines in one file, lets call it prog.asm. I have theC functions in another file, lets call it funcs.cc.What I did was this:assemble prog.asmcompile funcs.cclink prog funcs keep=progI was hoping the linking would magically figure out the labels, but thatdidn't work. I'm not finding anything in the manuals that is helping me.Geoff                      (SISGEOFF, 2746, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Keep in mind that this is a great way to crash the computer if you"""""   forget to initialize the C environment. The C libraries, and insome cases even the code generated by the compiler, depend on an orderlyinitialization of certain registers, global variables, and tools. If youdon't do that and use a function or instruction that depends oninitialization, you're asking for trouble.The easiest way to set things up is to start the program from C, then callyour main assembly language routine from main(). You can find specificstartup information for roll-your-own startups in the C release notes.Mike Westerfield                      (BYTEWORKS, 2749, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Just a wild guess here, since I'm at work and can't look it up, but"""""   do you have the case directive on in ORCA/M?

Hewlett Packard DeskJet 400 for $88.  I hadpromised myself that if the price of the HP DeskJets went below $100 Iwould get one for my Apple IIgs.  It was time to make good on that promise.FINDING A BARGAIN ON A NEW DESKJET PRINTER   Watch the ads for your local''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Wal-Mart, computer stores, andoffice supply stores.  If an ad sounds good check it out promptly.  Iwaited ten days to get to Wal-Mart and ended up buying a HP Deskjet 420Cfor $98 rather than the 400 for $89.     Also stop in regularly at these stores and check out their printerdisplays.  Recently the local OfficeMax was offering the same HP 420C witha $20 mail in coupon for a net price of $79 after rebate.  They had notadvertised this bargain.     Which Deskjet should you get?  In general if the specs say it willwork with _MS DOS_ it will work with the Apple II.  Avoid printers that arefor use with _Windows_ only.  Some of the local stores are currentlyoffering a $30 mail in rebate coupon for the HP Deskjet 612C for $129... anet price of $99.  The 612C has both color and black ink cartridges inplace at the same time.     The Deskjet 420C has a track record with the Apple II.  It isinexpensive, small, light weight, quiet, and works well with Appleworks andthe 16 bit programs on the IIgs.  Keep in mind that the 420C can only haveone ink cartridge installed at a time.  If you are switching from black andwhite to color or back you will have to change ink cartridges.THE MYSTIQUE OF THE APOLLO PRINTER   The Apollo 1200 printer, and the''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   "Barbie Printer" (as in Barbie Dolls)are reported to be the same printer as the HP Deskjet 420C.  The shape ofthe exterior case of the Apollo and the 420C are definitely not the same.The Apollo uses exactly the same HP ink cartridges as the 420C.     Hewlett Packard denies any connection with Apollo printers.  Followingthe news link on the Apollo web site (http://www.myapollo.com/) indicatesthat Apollo is a subsidiary of HP!     If you visit the Apollo web site you can print out coupons for mail inrebates of $30 on the Apollo 1200 and the Barbie printer, so you shouldcheck prices on these printers.     Locating a place to buy either one of these printers might be anothermatter.  I stopped at my local Best Buy to ask about these printers. I wastold that these printers were carried only for a short time as a specialpromotion... Best Buy is no longer selling them.  The people at OfficeDepot (the only other local store to advertise the Apollo printer)indicated that they were instructed to return all 25 of the Apollos to themanufacturer because of software problems.WHAT ELSE WILL YOU NEED FOR YOUR NEW DESKJET?   You will need a parallel'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   card.  This is usuallyinstalled in slot 1 but could be installed in one of the other slots.Alltech Electronics (http://www.allelec.com/) lists the Grappler Plus cardfor $29.  This card includes a cable that connects directly to the Deskjetprinters.  I was able to purchase a new Grappler Plus from an individualfor $10 including shipping.  Also watch the used market.     If you will be using the Deskjet with the 16 bit programs on the IIgsyou will need special software drivers.     I use _Harmonie_.  _Harmonie_ is available from Shareware Solutions II(http://www.crl.com/~joko/) for $20 including shipping.     _Independence_ is available from MyEsource(http://www.myesource.com/sevenhills/) for $20 plus shipping.(Editor's Note: see the February 1999 issue of _The Lamp!_ for a discussion of the merits of these two fine products)     With the IIgs you would also you would be well advised to use_Pointless_ so that you can use TrueType fonts.  _Pointless_ is availablefrom Shareware Solutions II (http://www.crl.com/~joko/) for $20 includingshipping.     The _Harmonie_ DeskJet560C driver works great with the 420C and theblack ink cartridge.  To use the color cartridge you will need to use theDeskJet500C driver.     _Appleworks_ 4.3 and 5.1 include two drivers for the HP Deskjet 500.With the Grappler Plus and the Deskjet 420C "add" these printers then:   1. Install black ink cartridge in Deskjet.   2. Change "Needs line feed after each Return" to yes.   3. Change Interface Cards to "Control-I 0N" (that is zero N).     Then there are _The New Print Shop_, _Print Shop GS_, and _Print ShopCompanion GS_.  No drivers for the HP 420C... And only a very slim hopethat there ever will be.  So I also left the Imagewriter II hooked up tothe IIgs.CONCLUSION   I would highly recommend the HP Deskjet 420C printer for use''''''''''   with the Apple II.  Considering the volatile prices of theDeskjets you should also consider other printers such as the HP 612C andthe Apollo / Barbie printers when making your purchase.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :    The world is coming to an end.
