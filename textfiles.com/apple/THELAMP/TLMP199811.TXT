This didn'tstrike me as unusual, although to a lot of other people it was--you see, hewas forty, and this was the first time he married.  I silently wondered ifthey'd have preferred him being divorced twice instead.  In any case,myself and my lady friend missed the ceremony--we didn't know where thechurch was, and by the time we found it, it was 4:20 p.m.  The wedding hadstarted twenty minutes earlier, and ended, apparently, twenty secondsearlier.  We looked at each other, shrugged our shoulders as one, andheaded on over to get some coffee at one of my favorite taverns before wegot to the reception and had a bunch of fun in honor of Jeff's and Jo'smarriage.  It was a good end to a day that was marred only by one tardinessthat didn't stop us from celebrating our friends' new commitment, and maythat commitment, and the love behind it, last forever.     Forever, it seems, means that it's never too late--never too late tostart again or continue on, never too late to try something new or comeback to something forgotten.  Forever means it's never too late to reachfor new heights or sit back and think what a great ride it's been--and howgreat it'll be.     Forever means that you'll always have one more chance.  And thatthere's no reason to ever give up.     And on a clear day, you can still see it.                                [*] [*] [*]     Vacation All I Ever Wanted Department: This issue of _The Lamp!_ willprobably be uploaded to Delphi from an unusual location--the CaliforniaHotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Yes, I'm on vacation again, my third mainlandtrip of the year (two too many for someone who only visited the mainlandtwice in something like 28 years), this time at Comdex by accident and at_another_ wedding of an old friend's by purpose.  While up there I alsoplan to run over and hang out a bit with Alltech Electronics' own TonyDiaz, the Master of the Apple II Dremel.     I leave for Vegas in less than 24 hours.

You said you havean optical drive or something like that. Boot your Mac from a optical diskwith a fresh, FWB CD-ROM Toolkit enhanced system and give it a try.- check your hard disk for soft errors. Disk First Aid is your friend here.If you do not check for errors regularly, reinstall the system after 4months or so. Today's software, notably internet software, is so lousy itsends your hard disk to Heaven sooner or later. By reinstalling your systemsporadically, you're on the safe side. Microsoft and Netscape take careyour hard disk will not last forever.System freezers like the one you described are often caused by corruptedfiles (or disk catalogs).- if the problems develop, be sure to disable all third-party extensionsexcept for the HDT CD-ROM driver.Again, I wouldn't expect a simple answer like "delete file xy". There's aflaw somewhere buried in your system - reinstalling the system takes 2hours maximum, trying to locate the problem may take an eternity.- henrik                        (GUDATH, 16690, GO COM A2)>>>>>   You also of course have to tell CD-ROM Toolkit that you want to"""""   mount ProDOS volumes.

Ifyou can find or make the mechanical parts, measuring wind direction andspeed should be relatively easy. Rainfall should be fairly easy,too--Vernier has some kits that could do it by weight, or you could createan optical or electronic device fairly easily. While this would be a fairlyhefty project, it shouldn't be too expensive--and when you consider that adecent weather station for the Mac or Windows platform runs about $2000,putting one together for your Apple II sounds pretty attractive.I've built a lot of Vernier kits and used their project books.

Each packet has address labels for whereit has to go, and sender labels of where it has come from.The receiver then checks that all the right packets have arrived, andrequests those that are missing. Much like a windowed Kermit file transfer.Marinetti talks TCP/IP, as does a Macintosh or a PC with Internet access.So TCP/IP is used as the link between applications and the Internet.But you need a connection into the Internet before you can use TCP/IP.If you are on a LAN (Local Area Network), in a large business or educationestablishment, you may well have routers that link your LAN (probablyEthernet) directly into the Internet.In those cases, all you will need is TCP/IP (Marinetti) with a directconnection.But if you are not on a LAN, the only way for you to get onto the Internetis to let someone else make this link for you. They then become what iscalled an ISP, or Internet Service Provider.You must connect to the ISP using a modem.But the ISP uses a protocol all of its own to link the TCP/IP at yourcomputer into the TCP/IP on the Internet.The most common one is PPP (Point to Point Protocol). A less common one,but a simpler one, is SLIP (Serial Link Internet Protocol).Because SLIP is simpler, Richard was able to get it working first forMarinetti 1.0. But because it is less common, he also now supports PPP inMarinetti 2.0. You will want to use PPP wherever possible.Most ISPs will expect you to sign in with a username and password so theycan verify that you have an account with them. This is usually done beforeyou invoke PPP or SLIP. You need to use a scripted method of connectionwith Marinetti to do this. SLIP is always handled this way, and you woulduse the scripted PPP option for a PPP connection.More commonly now, ISPs will also support PAP authentification protocolwith PPP. This is much easier to set up, as all you need to enter inMarinetti is your user name and password. It is also quicker to verify youraccount.Some newer ISPs require a more secure method of authentification calledCHAP. This is currently not supported in Marinetti 2.0, so you will not beable to use those ISPs with Marinetti 2.0. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Fri 9 Oct 1998 - 285 till KFest '99 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum & Crock O' Gold 2.5 Bernie ][ the Rescue 1.3 woofing on a PowerMac 8200/120 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                        (EWANNOP, 16738, GO COM A2)ZIP GSX AND THE SELF TEST   The ZipGS will more often than not cause"""""""""""""""""""""""""   various self test failures, even if it did notin the past, disabling it does not rule it out.

The project thatI've settled on is an appointment calendar, a type of program sometimescalled a "Personal Information Manager" or "PIM" in the Mac and Windowsworlds.     Each step in making this stack will be discussed in a written lesson.You will learn why the stack is being designed the way it is, andalternatives to each choice. The final stage of the course is to alter thestack to meet your own needs better. Your choices will be made on your ownneeds, but I'll help out with any programming difficulties that you runinto in this stage.BEFORE YOU START     There are three prerequisites to following this course.1. You must have a system that can run HCGS.     HCGS needs a IIgs system with:     a. 2 MB or more of RAM     b. A 3.5" disk drive     c. A hard drive     If you don't have these three requirements, then you may want to getthem. Not only HCGS, but almost all major IIgs programs need them. Think ofthis course as a spur to do something that you should do for other reasons.2. You must have HCGS     If you can run HCGS, then you may need to obtain a copy. It is nolonger sold by Apple, but all six 3.5" disks can be downloaded for freefrom Apple or from Delphi's file library. The web address to get it fromApple is:     http://swupdates.info.apple.com/cgi.bin/lister.pl?Apple.Supp     ort.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/Apple_II/HyperCard_IIGS_1 .1     [Dean's NOTE:  The above URL did not work for me but the      following one did:      ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Soft      ware_Updates/US/Apple_II/HyperCard_IIGS_1.1/     ]If this looks too complicated to type, there is a link to this site onSteve Cavanaugh's Apple Blossom web site at     http://people.delphi.com/appleblossom     [Dean's NOTE:  The URL on this page may not work either.]     Getting HCGS from the web has one disadvantage.

You must be sufficiently familiar with HCGS to follow the instructions.     This course, as mentioned, depends on the student knowing a littleabout HCGS: what a stack is and what a field or button or script is. Thatknowledge can be obtained from several sources, and doesn't take long topick up. Try these sources:   The HCGS Tour: the first thing to try after installing HCGS is to launchit, then click (once) on the button for Tour. This will familiarize youwith the HCGS tools and terminology.   The HCGS Help stacks: Click on the "Help" button after launching HCGS,or choose "Help" from the "Go" menu, to find an on-line equivalent to areference book on HyperCard. If you don't have real reference books, relyon these stacks heavily.   The Official Manuals: I recommend these highly. The first manual,Getting Started with HyperCard IIgs, covers the most basic aspects ofcreating and modifying stacks in a tutorial fashion. The HyperTalkBeginner's Guide is quite elementary (as the title indicates), but holdsthe hands of the nervous pretty well. Even if you decide not to get thosemanuals, I strongly recommend that every participant have a copy of theHyperCard IIgs Reference_. Its 389 pages cover every aspect of HCGS (exceptscripting).   Gareth Jones' HyperCard articles: If you don't have the HCGS manuals,but want to get started, I've written a series of articles on HCGS. Oneprovides an overview of the program. Two discuss creating a simple wordprocessing stack that can load and save text files. Creating that stack isgood preparation for this course, though not so good as the "Birds" stackin the manuals. Steve Cavanaugh has these articles up at:     http://people.delphi.com/appleblossom/hq/     [Dean's NOTE:  Add "articles/hcgsarticles.html" to the end of the      URL above to go directly to Gareth's HCGS articles.]   They may also be available now in the Delphi file library.   Last, but not least important, HangTime is available every Tuesday nightto answer questions about HyperCard in A2Pro's "HyperBar & Grill Real TimeConference." To get there once you've telnetted in, type "go com a2proconference". If you are visiting via the web and have a Java-enabledbrowser you can go to     http://www.delphi.com/a2proand follow the links to the "Chat Rooms".     [Dean's NOTE:  Or you can go to the following URL which will tell      you what chat(s) are currently taking place in the A2Pro      conference area:      http://www.delphi.com//dir-app/chat/forumchat.asp?sigdir=a2pro     ]THE PLAN     This course is a series of written lessons plus support stacks showingthe progress of the project from lesson to lesson. The lessons, as Icurrently conceive them, will be:0. Lesson 0, this one, which gets the student ready for the course,discusses the stack in general terms, and tells everyone how to get set upfor...1. Lesson 1, sets up the backgrounds used in the stack. Homework,personalizing the artwork for the backgrounds.2. Lesson 2, The script to automatically move from card 1 to card 2 afterlaunching the stack. Visual effects, and how to choose them. Homework:experiment with visual effects and choose ones for this stack.3. Lesson 3, card fields and buttons vs. background fields and buttons.Create card fields and buttons on the Menu card. Create some backgroundfields and buttons on the Date background. Homework: add some made-upappointments for various days, enough to give a good workout for lesson 5.4. Lesson 4, sorting a stack and creating a clickable menu. In this case,the Menu card will get a menu of dates, in their proper order, and clickingon a date in the field will take you to a card with appointments for thatdate. This will be your first field script.5. Lesson 5, simplifying data entry. In this lesson, you set up a dataentry system that involves a specialized card.6. Lesson 6, XCMDs, XFCNs, and creating popup lists. You will create popuplists to ease the job of entering the Year, Month, and Day for each Datecard. In the process, you will become familiar with the Scripters' Toolsstack.7. Showing and hiding information. Shared and unshared text. By using abackground field which does NOT share text, you can enter and show moreinformation than is shown on the screen. Fields used for informationstorage but not information display can be hidden.8. Creating a calendar. An on-screen calendar is a perfect addition to anappointment manager, but involves a bit of programming. I think that we canmanage to put this classy feature in.9. Finishing up. I'm sure that many little tweaks and features will havebeen put off until the end, and here they are! The topic of sounds willprobably go here.10. Personal project. This can either be extra features in your appointmentcalendar or a completely new HCGS stack that you've thought of. I'll beavailable, as will my helpers, to discuss individual problems inprogramming and design. Submission of the personal project will result inthe right to run my official "Certificate of Completion" stack. :-)     I reserve the right to modify this outline as the course progresses.My ideas may clarify, or students' comments may require a change or two.SOME COMMENTS ABOUT DESIGNING STACKS     Most books on programming recommend a strategy called "top-downprogramming." For example, in the entertaining book ELEMENTARY PASCAL (byHenry Ledgard and Andrew Singer), Sherlock Holmes opines:          In my engagements as a criminal investigator I have always     been careful to arrange all clues systematically and devise a     complete hypothesis to a case before taking a single step out of     my rooms in pursuit of a solution. The principle applies equally     well to the use of the Analytical Engine [computer]. No matter     how simple the task, it is necessary at the outset to formulate a     clear and complete statement of the problem at hand, as well as a     basic plan for solving it. The programmer should prepare sample     input and output formats and design a general algorithm before     writing any programme.In other words, as I understand it, the top-down approach designs theprogram before writing it. An excellent plan.     HCGS differs from other languages, however, because you don't have todesign with pencil and paper first -- you can work just as well using thepencil, field, and button tools on the computer screen. When the design isgood enough, half the work is done.     A second aspect of HCGS is that a small, working program can be partof an object, such as a button or field, and will move with it when it iscut and pasted. So, let's say that you've decided to add a "Home" button toyour stack. You can Copy a button from another stack, paste it into yourown, and (more than likely) it will work perfectly. This can make a simplestack more like assembling the parts of an Erector Set than sitting down towrite a program.     Finally, my experience has been that a small, working stack can gainfeatures over time as they occur to you. I will use this fact in the lessonto introduce quick-and-dirty solutions to a problem in one lesson, butreplace them with something more elaborate later.HOMEWORK     The homework for this week is simple. Get and install a copy ofHyperCard and familiarize yourself with its tools. In the next lesson,we will start building a stack.                       (JBLAKENEY, 16544, GO COM A2)<<<<<   Sorry for taking so long to get this posted.

WELL, ALMOST   Dear Bernie users,""""""""""""""""""""""""""""We regret of having to inform you that the much anticipated Bernie ][ TheRescue 2.0 might not be ready by end of October. This delay has been causedby increased support activities which always have top priority and hecticbusiness with our other jobs.Sweet16 for BeOS is also affected by this delay. A release date will befixed at a later time.Version 2.0 has been on the workbench since June, and all major featuresare done. Still, we've been planning more than this, and we do not want torelease anything but the real thing.We understand that many of you are waiting for version 2.0. For thisreason, we will make available a prerelease of version 2.0 by end ofOctober. We will ensure the prerelease is a worthy successor to yourcurrent Bernie. Final version 2.0 will be introduced shortly after that,the delay is rather insignificant.We will soon let you know what new features are on the horizon, and whatelse is waiting for you.

Just interested...Actually, I'm not.The problem is that the BASIC program is never really loaded by the loaderor started by GS/OS, since it's an interpreted file. Because of that, theStartupTools call looks for the interpreted program's resources in the lastknow program--GSoft BASIC itself. You _could_ actually make this work byattaching the resources for your interpreted program to the GSoft.Sys16file, but the technical term for asking someone to do that is, "Ick!"So I have to fool GS/OS and the Loader into thinking that my interpretedprogram, which they did not see loaded or started in the normal way, isactually a full-fledged application. The tools don't give me a way of doingthat, short of loading an application and starting it with GS/OS. Thatmeans I need to assign it its own user ID (no big deal). But it also meansI need to patch the MMStartUp call to _report_ that user ID. That's thefirst patch. Then I have to convince GS/OS the current "application" is myinterpreted program. Patching GetName is the GS/OS patch. Next, I have toconvince the Loader of the same thing. That means patching LGetPathname andLGetPathname2.Just for grins, I also patched all startup and shutdown calls. Why? SoGSoft BASIC knows when you start a tool, and can shut it down if yourprogram aborts. The only safe alternative is to force you to reboot thecomputer, which would be OK, but cleanly shutting things down and lettingyou fix the error without rebooting seemed like a nice touch.Mike Westerfield                      (BYTEWORKS, 2210, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Sheppy was right, to a point. My MMStartup call was too"""""   heavy-handed. I fixed that, and the Control Panel no longercrashes.It doesn't work, but at least it doesn't crash anymore.So _a_ problem still exists. Does anyone have any thoughts about this?Otherwise, it looks like I'm about to violate the old Apple licensingagreement one more time by taking my disassembler to their code. :)Mike Westerfield                      (BYTEWORKS, 2211, GO COM A2PRO)HYPERCARD GS COURSE TIDBITS   If you want to download the lessons from the"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   text side of Delphi, then you go to the A2ProForum's A2 University Database.  You do this by typing:     go com a2p dat a2Then do a "read" command to list all the files available in the A2University Database.  Once you get to the file you want (the first lessonof the HyperCard IIgs Course is called LESSON01.BXY) use the "down" commandand then tell Delphi what transfer protocol you want to use. ZModem isusually the best but if it gives you lots of errors, try using Kermitinstead if your communications program supports it.If you want to download the lessons through the web then point your webbrowser to:     http://www.delphi.com/a2proand click the "A2 University" link.  On the A2 University page click the"A2 University Download" link and then you can select either LESSON01.BXY,if you don't have problems downloading ShrinkIt archives with your webbrowser, or select LESSON01.BSQ if you do.  The .BSQ archive is just aShrinkIt archive encoded as a BINscii text file.  You can decode theBINscii file back into a ShrinkIt file by using the BinHQX XCMD inSpectrum, GScii+ NDA, BSC-It (a ProDOS 8 program) or BINSCII (also a ProDOS8 program).In any case you end up with a ShrinkIt archive that you can unpack withGSHK (the IIgs version of ShrinkIt) or Balloon.  Keep in mind that theProDOS 8 version of ShrinkIt will most likely not work to unpack thelessons because some are bound to contain files with resource forks.Hopefully I've covered all the bases with this post but if not, just hollerand we'll try to get you pointed in the right direction. Jeff Blakeney - Dean of the Apple II University in A2Pro ** HyperCard IIgs Course now in session in A2Pro **                      (JBLAKENEY, 2270, GO COM A2PRO)<<<<<   Please note that there is a small mistake in the lesson 2 archive"""""   that I uploaded to the database.

(I have one idea for a C course instructorright now but I also know he is quite busy with other things so I won'tbother him :-)Right now, the only other A2U course I have on the back burners is a GSoftBASIC course which should be starting in the new year. Jeff Blakeney - Dean of the Apple II University in A2Pro ** HyperCard IIgs Course now in session in A2Pro! **                      (JBLAKENEY, 2260, GO COM A2PRO)[EOA][HWH]------------------------------              HARDWORKING HARDWARE |-----------------------------------FOCUS DRIVE 520"""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

There's likely no one with an Apple II who has tried itwith a hard drive only to happily go back to life without one.  Thestandard hard drive for the Apple II series, like the Macintosh, hastraditionally been hard drives of the Small Computer Systems Interface(SCSI, pronounced, "scuzzy") type.  Unfortunately, adding SCSI drives tothe Apple II has never been as simple as it could be.  First, a SCSI cardmust be added, then a drive must be placed in an appropriate housing, andthere are the issues of cabling, SCSI ID numbers, termination, terminatorpower, and others to deal with.  Isn't there an easier way?     Certainly.  Alltech Electronics, the one stop Apple II hardware shop,has a clear winner in its hard drive on a card, the Focus Drive.  I ordereda 520 megabyte drive for use in a ROM_3 Apple IIgs.  This drive is basedaround a 2.5 inch IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) hard drive, originallydesigned for use in notebook style computers, adapted for use with theApple //e and IIgs.  All you have to do is drop it in a slot (other thanslot 3 and the dedicated memory expansion slots), set the Control Panel ona IIgs appropriately, and off you go.     The Focus Drive includes software for testing, formatting, andpartitioning the drive using the Apple IIgs's famillar interface.Unfortunately, it does not include the same software for use with a //e.     While the Focus Drive does not use direct memory access (DMA) totransfer data to the memory of the Apple IIgs, it is still very fast--itappears to be as fast as a RamFAST and SCSI drive in normal use, which isvery fast indeed.  In fact, not using DMA can be an advantage if yoursystem uses a non-DMA compatible accelerator or memory card.     What more can be said?  The Focus Drive is fast, simple to install,simple to use, and affordable.  It also comes from one of the most ardentsupporters of the Apple II out there.  Alltech Electronics has a realwinner in its Focus Drive.[EOA][FRE]------------------------------                FREEWARE FAVORITES |-----------------------------------QUIT-TO"""""""by Ryan M.

Instead of listing separate menu items,a hierarchical menu allows you to list category items in the menu, and whenyou place your pointer on the category item, another menu appears to letyou select the actual menu item.  For instance, _Transprog III_ allows youto quit the current application and shut down, "cold" restart, or "warm"restart the IIgs.  Instead of listing these three items separately in itspull down menu, only the "Quit Application" item is listed, and when thecursor is placed on this item while holding the mouse button down, thethree options mentioned above emerge from a second pull down menu, offsetto one side.  This saves space on your IIgs desktop and better organizesmenu items.  Hierarchical menus are required by a number of current AppleIIgs programs, including _WebWorks GS_, _Super Menu Pack_, _Spectrum_, and_Transprog III_.     There have been several changes in this version of _Hierarchic_.First, it's become a Control Panel, meaning it needs to be placed in theCDev folder in the System folder in your boot drive to be active (note:while it is possible to have _Hierarchic_ loaded "on the fly" by programsthat need it such as _Spectrum_ very few programs offer this capability andit is not the preferred method to activate _Hierarchic_.)  If you have anearlier version of the _Hierarchic_ init in your System.Setup folder,either delete or deactivate it.     Secondly, as a Control Panel, the two settings for _Hierarchic_ ("Dragdelay" and "Initial delay") are accessed through the New Desk AccessoryControl Panel in the Apple menu that is in the upper left corner of mostIIgs programs.     As installed, _Hierarchic_ works rather transparently.  It really doesnothing until a program that needs it calls forth its magic.  Usinghierarchical menus adds a whole new dimension to your Apple II computingexperience.
