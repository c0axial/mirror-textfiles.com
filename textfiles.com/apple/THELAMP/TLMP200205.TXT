I was hoping that someone elsewould have this problem and report it so that I wouldn't have to, but ...I am using SOAR on a real GS.  It has worked fine for several months.During that time it collected topics the first time I logged in in a monthjust as it is supposed to do.  This month though was different.  I didn'tnotice it at first as I wasn't looking at the screen, but just thought thatthe Mac and Syndicomm forums didn't have any posters.  Then one night I waswatching and something strange appeared.  It was collecting the topics andit wasn't the first time in April that I had been on.  Then it quit.I tried it again and kept close watch and discovered that it was trying tocollect topics, and failing (the error posted was "Capture failed") andthen quitting without going on to the next forum.  I deactivated A2, wentonline and had the same problem with Syndicomm.  I deactivated that forumand went online and got the Mac forum and again it quit after trying andfailing to get the topics.Since no one has posted about this problem, I can only assume that mymachine is at fault.  What should I look at first?  Incidentally, whenI first went to write this message, I couldn't get a listing of topics (orcategories).  I could get a listing of forums. :)  I seem to have plenty ofspace on my HD and the messages do come through fine.So, is there any way I can disable the topic collection if I can't figureout why my computer is not saving them? David R. Pierce Delivered by Spectrum v2.5.2 & SOAR v1.0b8(DAVIDP, Cat 10, Top 59, Msg 235)>>>>>"""""There is indeed a problem...Back last November, the way that the Categories and Topics were reportedchanged with extra CRs being introduced. I reported the problem, and it wasdown on the list of things to fix at the Syndicomm end. However till it gotfixed, I turned off the auto collection of Topics on my working version ofSOAR. Red faced, I can now report that I forgot to check that it had beenfixed, and forgot to turn the collection on again on my machine...I think a tweak may be needed to the collection routines as SOAR failed tosee the prompt it was expecting when I checked it out just now. I will lookat this and see what needs doing to the script set. It will probably meanan update will need to be posted on my web site.In the meantime, delete any 'reset' files from the 'SOAR:Configs:Topics'folder, and put back a copy of the 'cats' and 'dat' files for all theForums you use.I will report back when I have it fixed. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Wed 17 Apr 2002 - 97 days till KFest '02 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum v2.5.2 & SOAR 1.0b5 Setup: Bernie ][ the Rescue 3.0 and a dual G4/800Mhz GeForce3 http://www.ewannop.btinternet.co.uk/(CONDUCTOR, Cat 10, Top 59, Msg 236)>>>>>"""""Okay, I'll see what I can do.

The data line for the Topics is broken when it exceeds a certainlength.As SOAR relies on single line entries for the Topic data, this is a realproblem. I shall report it to Dave and see if we can get a fix.I found a second problem when I tried to retrieve all the Topic lists forthe A2 Forum. After about twenty or so Topic lists, Syndicomm outputstopped, and SOAR timed out. Whether this is a Syndicomm issue, or aMarinetti issue, I don't know.Meanwhile, copy the lists from SOAR archive into the Topics folder and usethose. These will at least get you by in the Forums that I have preparedwith SOAR. For other Forums, put in dummy files, and make sure you haveunchecked the box that automatically builds the files.If you follow the format of the files SOAR provides, you can manually buildyour own for any other Forums you visit. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Thu 18 Apr 2002 - 96 days till KFest '02 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum v2.5.2 & SOAR 1.0b5 Setup: Bernie ][ the Rescue 3.0 and a dual G4/800Mhz GeForce3 http://www.ewannop.btinternet.co.uk/(CONDUCTOR, Cat 10, Top 59, Msg 238)>>>>>"""""David,I have not forgotten your report about the Topic/Category building in SOAR.The original problem is that Syndicomm is adding spurious CRs when a Topicline exceeds 80 characters. This has been reported to Dave, and I await aresponse from him.However, I am being plagued with problems that are stopping me creating analternate solution to building the lists.SOAR currently retrieves the Topic lists separately for each category, thistakes time, but has been foolproof. I have tried using the alternate 'IND'command, but I cannot get a complete list returned, as the data flow stopspart way through. This is probably a Marinetti issue, as it seems fineusing a Telnet application on the Mac.For some reason we cannot fathom, Syndicomm will not let me Telnet in toit, or accept sent mail, if I use my main BTInternet ISP in the UK. AsBTInternet is probably the largest ISP in the UK, this is a real problemfor me and others. I can use an alternate ISP, but instead of free calls,this means a cost of 10 cents a call. This obviously limits my testingsomewhat...As soon as I can get a solution and make fixes to SOAR, I will report back. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Wed 24 Apr 2002 - 90 days till KFest '02 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum v2.5.2 & SOAR 1.0b5 Setup: Bernie ][ the Rescue 3.0 and a dual G4/800Mhz GeForce3 http://www.ewannop.btinternet.co.uk/(CONDUCTOR, Cat 10, Top 59, Msg 239)[EOA][NTC]NET TIME CONTROL PANEL (CDev) v1.0.1""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Wow, I didn't know I had my own topic...If anyone is interested, I've made the latest version (v1.0.1) of myfreeware Net Time control panel (CDev) available from my web page.http://www.weygants.net/~apulver/apple2.htmlThe Net Time control panel allows you to synchronize your IIgs clock withan RFC-868 compliant time server, and requires Richard Bennett's Marinetti2.0.1 and Geoff Weiss' Time Tool Set.I finally had time to get v1.0.1 archived and put on my web page lastnight.

When I had it together I found it wouldn't power up butopening it up and changing the fuse fixed that thankfully. Then to mydismay it would only print blank pages though instead of buying a new inkcartridge, I discovered blowing forcefully into the air-hole unclogged theexisting one.It's a nice little printer and prints well enough with the right kind ofpaper (i.e. not the inexpensive fan-fold sheets left over from mydotmatrix... the ink bleeds on that) though I remember there were issueswith the System 6.0.1 Stylewriter driver. By the looks of things, graphicimages seem to be the weak point of that driver.I remember Harmonie contained a enhanced StyleWriter driver but couldn'tfind anything on my versions 2.1 or 2.11 disks from Vitesse.  I vaguelyremember a "2.11b" release from SSII, could that have contained it?Incidentally, has anyone here tried the StyleWriter on a Windows-based PC?It's supposed to be a repackaged Canon BJ-10 bubblejet but using thatdriver with a null-modem hook up didn't get a response from the printer.

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.[editor@juiced.gs]                         The KFest FAQ Version 3.0                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The following article is set up in a form commonly seen on theInternet, called Frequently Asked Questions.  It is designed to answer someof the most common questions people have about KansasFest, the Apple IIevent of the year.  It is not designed to answer general questions aboutthe Apple II, although there may be some overlap.     Any questions about this article can be sent via email tothelamp@sheppyware.netQ: What's a FAQ, and how is it pronounced?A: The letters "FAQ" stand for _F_requently _A_sked _Q_uestions.  Whenpeople first hear of or learn of a subject, such as KansasFest, they oftenhave a number of questions which others before them did when they alsofirst learned of the same subject.  A FAQ is a document listing both thequestions and answers most frequently associated with new users, to savethemselves (and others trying to assist them) time and frustration.And by the way, it's pronounced "fack", nearly identical to "fact".Q: What is the purpose of this FAQ?A: This FAQ is set up to assist people interested in KansasFest, also knownas KFest.  Many Apple II enthusiasts are interested in attending or justwant some information about this event, so the most common questions areanswered here.Q: How can this FAQ be distributed?A: The content of this FAQ is copyright 1999-2002 by Ryan M. Suenaga, thepublisher of _The Lamp!_.  Distribution without the expressed writtenconsent of the copyright holder is prohibited.Q: What is KFest?A: KansasFest, abbreviated "KFest", is a computing conference held everysummer at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  Its original formal namewas "The Apple II Summer Conference" while its nickname was "KansasFest",which was abbreviated to "KFest".Q: When was the first KFest held?A: The first KansasFest was held in 1989.  It was originally sponsored byResource-Central, the folks who brought you the wonderful _Open-Apple_ and_A2-Central_ (among several other Apple II) publications.  AfterResource-Central became ICON, The Apple II Summer Conference becameICONference.  This lasted one summer until ICON shut down.  Two differentcompanies sponsored KFest before Intrec Software, publishers of _ProTERM_,took over a few years back.  This July will welcome the 14th KFest.Q: When is KFest this year?A: KansasFest 2002 runs from Tuesday through Sunday, July 23-28, 2002. Thevery popular early arrival day is now officially rolled into KansasFestproper.  Meals, however, will not be served at Avila until Wednesdaydinner.Q: Where is KFest held?A: KFest is held at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  The addressand phone number are:     Avila College     11901 Wornall Road     Kansas City, Missouri  64145     United States of America     (816) 942-8400Q: If it's held in Missouri, why is it called KansasFest?A: I dunno.  If it makes you feel better, the Kansas border is very closeto Avila College.Q: Who comes to KFest?A: While KFest was originally devoted to programmers, nowadays all kinds offolk from all over the world show up at Avila College.  Programmers, users,newsletter publishers, and everyday folk show up from Europe, Canada,Australia, and all over the United States to celebrate the Apple II.Q: Who organizes KFest?A: Currently, KFest is organized by a committee headed by The Grand Gouda,Steve "Godzilla" Gozdziewski, who has taken over from The Big Cheese, CindyAdams.  Cindy remains on the committee.  The scheduling is done by TonyDiaz, of Alltech Electronics fame.  There are several other folks on thecommittee as well: Jerry Cline, Allen Moore, and Max Jones all pitch in.In addition to those good folk on the committee, David Kerwood handles themaintenance of the World Wide Web site, Devin Reade maintains the emaillists, and Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd provides World Wide Web hosting servicesand organizes HackFest, the programming contest.  KFest is sponsored byIntrec Software.Q: How do I register for KFest?  How much does it cost?A: Depending on when you register, registration prices vary.  If youregister early, you'll get a better deal. Please check the KFest Home Pageat http://www.kfest.org/ for the most current information.Q: Which airport do I fly into and how do I get from there to Avila?A: The major airport nearly everyone flies into is Kansas CityInternational, which goes by the code letters MCI (not KCI, which will getyou to Indonesia).  There's a couple of small commuter airports which arecloser, but unless you're Tony Diaz, you're not likely to use these.Even though MCI is the "closest" major airport, it's still most of anhour's drive from there to Avila, so walking is out of the question and cabfare would be substantial.  Your best bet would be to try and catch a ridewith another KFester who'll be flying in or passing by around the same timeyou'll be arriving.  Carl Knoblock unofficially organizes rides to and fromthe airport.  The best way to get in on the ride planning is to join theKFest email list (information on subscribing is elsewhere in thisdocument).Q: What kind of official activities go on at KFest?A: Officially, there is a keynote speech (this year given by Tony Diaz ofComputer Circulation Center), sessions on various computing topics,HackFest, a celebrity roast (Apple II writer, editor, publisher, sysop,Ryan Suenaga, is the victim of honor this year), product demonstrations,and a vendor fair.Q: What kind of unofficial activities go on at KFest?A: Unofficially, there's been movie outings, pizza nights, Bite The Bagcontests, late night eating at Denny's, runs out to Krispy Kreme, and hugegroups of folks going to eat huge pieces of beef at K.C. Masterpiece andJess and Jim's restaurants.Q: Has anyone attended every KFest?A: One person: Tony Diaz of Alltech Electronics.Q: I hear that the Avila College dorm is wired for Ethernet.  Is there away I can access that while I'm there?A: Yes.  In each dorm room in the halls of Avila are two outlets that seemto be phone jacks.  These _aren't_ phone jacks.  They're Ethernet ports--tobe exact, they're RJ-45 connectors that are compatible with 10 Base-TEthernet.  The entire Avila dorm is connected to the Internet this way,making for high speed World Wide Web browsing, electronic mail, and ftpconnections for KansasFesters during their stay!Those bringing their true blue Apple IIs will be needing to go the triedand true modem route aside from LANceGS owners--and even they will needassistance in the form of a router, as the LANceGS does not currentlysupport the required DHCP standard used on Avila's campus--but thoseKFesters who bring Ethernet-capable computers of other platforms can makefull use of these high speed connections.  Let's look at what hardware andsoftware is needed to get this high speed resource working with yournon-Apple II.THE HARDWARE   All Avila provides is the RJ-45 jack.  This looks like an""""""""""""   overgrown RJ-11 jack (the kind your telephone plugs into),and in fact, it's a close relative.  What you need to bring is a computerwith an appropriate 10 Base-T Ethernet interface and a cable that ends in amale RJ-45 jack.  There are many, many of these cables on the market.  Ifyou are going to purchase one, be sure it's a straight-through class 5cable, not a crossover cable.  Additionally, due to the way the RJ-45 jackis mounted, you will need a cable ending with a RJ-45 male jack that is notmolded with a surrounding sheath, as the cable will not fit properly.  Youwant a cable end that looks like this:ASCII ART BEGINS      ___________     |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |  <--- Male RJ-45     |   |   |   |     |   |___| <-|------ Locking tab     |           |     |           |     |           |     |___________|       |       |       |       | <------ Cable       |       |as opposed to this:      ___________     |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |  <--- Male RJ-45     |   |   |   |     |   |___| <-|------ Locking tab     |           |     |           |    _|___________|_   |               |   |               |   |               |   |               | <-- Large, molded sheath   |               |   |               |   |_______________|       |       |       |       | <------ Cable       |       |ASCII ART ENDS     I had problems with this at KFest 1998.  If you need to get differentcables (or need other hardware in general) you can ask your fellowattendees if they have extras, or you can run over to the CompUSA in thearea to get what you need.  If someone brings an Ethernet hub, perhaps youcan plug into that instead of into the jack provided by Avila.     Once you have this equipment, simply plug in your RJ-45 cable into theprovided jack.  You do not need an Ethernet hub unless you'll be runningmore than two devices in your room.THE SOFTWARE   The Avila Ethernet server uses a protocol called""""""""""""   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP, for short.Those of you who have set up TCP/IP connections with Windows or Macintoshcomputers (or, for that matter, the Apple IIgs) probably have somefamiliarity with inserting IP addresses, DNS addresses, and Gatewayaddresses.  The beauty of DHCP is that it sets up nearly everything youneed dynamically, meaning that the server assigns these addresses--all youneed to do is set up TCP/IP on your computer and choose the DHCP protocol.I am much more familiar with the setup of DHCP for Macintosh computers thanfor Windows machines, and am taking the Windows instructions from areference.MAC OS 9   To set up a Macintosh running Open Transport''''''''   networking for DHCP, all that needs to be done is to switch theTCP/IP protocol to DHCP Server.  So:(1) Get into your TCP/IP Control Panel;(2) Select "Ethernet" (or "Built-in Ethernet" or "Alternate    Ethernet" as appropriate) in the "Connect via:" field;(3) Select "DHCP Server" in the "Configure" field;(4) Quit and save the changes.MAC OS X   To set up a Macintosh running Mac OS X for DHCP, all''''''''   that needs to be done is to switch the TCP/IP protocol to UsingDHCP.  So:(1) Get into your Network Preferences in System Preferences;(2) Use the "Show" option to select the appropriate Ethernet    port;(3) Use the "Configure" option" to select "Using DHCP";(4) Hit the "Apply Now" button.WINDOWS 95   To set up a Windows 95 machine for DHCP, there are''''''''''   several additional steps:(1) Get into your Network Control panel;(2) Add or select the appropriate Ethernet interface;(3) Set the "Obtain an IP address automatically" control in the    "IP Address" tab of the TCP/IP Properties window;(4) Remove any existing setting for a Gateway address in the    "Gateway" tab of the TCP/IP Properties window;(5) Disable DNS in the "DNS Configuration" tab of the TCP/IP    Properties window;(6) Save the settings and reboot the computer.     Regardless of which platform you use, if you have software set up toshare your hard drive with other computers, you probably ought to disableit--unless you like everyone in the Avila Ethernet having access to yourfiles.     At this point, you ought to be connected.  If you previously had anyproxy servers set up for use with your setup before Avila, disable them.You ought to have easy access for checking mail, browsing the Web, or usingfile transfer protocol--and very high speeds.  One last caveat:THE SMTP SERVER   As Spam on the Internet proliferates, it has become"""""""""""""""   accepted practice to close off an Internet ServiceProvider's mail sending server--usually using Simple Mail TransferProtocol, or smtp--to access from anyone who is not directly connected tothe ISP.  In other words, no one wants to be a relaying point for Spam.     Because of this, it's likely you will not be able to use the same smtpserver you use at home to send mail while at Avila.  There is, however, amail.avila.edu smtp server that can be used while at Avila.  That ought tokeep your email flowing freely.Q: I hear that there's wireless Internet access in the Avila dorm.  How doI get hooked up?A: Ah, the infamous wireless.  Several KFesters have set up Apple AirportBase Stations and other equivalents.  Please see one of them (Sean Fahey,Eric Shepherd, and Ryan Suenaga are likely candidates) if you'd like to geton the wireless 'Net.Q: How can I learn more about KFest?A: You can get more information on KansasFest by visiting the KansasFestWorld Wide Web site at http://www.kfest.org/ or sending email tokfest-help@kfest.org.  You could also subscribe to the KFest mailing listby sending email to majordomo@kfest.org.  In the body of the email includethe text:     subscribe kfestYou will receive a confirmation email with instructions on finalizing yoursubscription.Q: Should I go to KFest?A: Need you ask?  KFest is a must for the serious Apple II fanatic.  Doyourself a favor--you're worth it.  Show up at KFest 2002--a KFestpalindrome![EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
