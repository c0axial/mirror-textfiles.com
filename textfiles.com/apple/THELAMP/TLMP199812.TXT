Between three of the teams in the islands (University ofHawai'i, Brigham Young University Hawai'i, and Hawai'i Pacific University),it's a virtual certainty at least one of them will win a nationalchampionship and all will be ranked in their respective national top tens.So it was no surprise this year when the women of HPU won the NCAA DivisionII championship, yet it seemed a disappointment when the Rainbow Wahinewere eliminated in a NCAA Division I Regional Final--meaning they were onlyone of the top eight teams in the nation.     It seems ironic--people are disappointed when you're only numbereight.     The Rainbow football team ended this season without a win and with aneighteen game losing streak.  If somehow they became number eight in thenation next year, the whole town would be ecstatic, not disappointed.     Perhaps it's another case of not realizing what you have, and beingspoiled by having been the best--is it really true that nothing else comesclose?  Not eight years ago, the Rainbow Football team ended the seasonnumber 20 in the nation, and we were still disappointed then.  We'd be morethan happy now.     Those of us who still compute with an Apple II at this late date canbe disappointed over what we don't have--we don't have a head-to-headcompetitor with _Netscape Navigator_ or _Microsoft Internet Explorer_.  Wedon't have a national magazine that is sold on newsstands or a hugemultimillion member user base.     Or we can appreciate what we do have.  We have dedicated developerswho give every second of time they can spare to squeeze even more out of acomputer the general public has long abandoned.  We have publications whichcut the fat and give the leanest news the Apple II community has to offer.And of course, we have Delphi, which serves as the glue for the electronicscrapbooks we each have a page in.     More than twenty years after the birth of the Apple II, we're nolonger spoiled by perfection.     But considering all we have, I'm more than happy.                                [*] [*] [*]     Hey Mr. Postman Department: For some unknown reason, the account atDelphi which is dedicated to email for _The Lamp!_, thelamp@delphi.com, isnot working.

However,since I'm not always in the mood for scripting, I took a few days away fromthat project to work on this one--the December 1998 issue of _The Lamp!_.     This marks the conclusion of the first volume of what has become ofThe Publication Formerly Known As _GenieLamp A2_, and I'm more than happywith what we've produced.  I'm planning on continuing to edit thisnewsletter through 1999, although I'd certainly like to start grooming asuccessor so I can go to work on even more of my other Apple II projects.Yes, that's a hint--applications are welcome, via email tothelamp@sheppyware.net.     Happy Holidays all.

These are not partof this issue. The incompatibilities are with the Focus 20 that has theKittyhawk drive installed. There are two types of these, those bought along time ago and those bought not as long ago. There was a period of onlyusing the large (standard 2.5" drives) That separates the two types. Ifyour drive has the Focus driver installed (blinking square in upper rightcorner during drive access) it is compatible. ALL of the early ones and afew of the later drives are not compatible. Mostly, when able, theincompatible drives were sold for the //e in the later set. The way to tellif you have a newer or older one is by way of the drive connection to thecard. On the original series the drives are attached and you can see pinsat a 45 degree angle, on the newer ones the drive is attached to aconnector on the card that is at a 45 degree angle.You can upgrade the drive size on an older card by simply replacing thedrive and adding the metal mounting rails. On the newer 20 Meg drive youcan not (well, you could) just attach the drive to the card. (As the drivewould then block all slots because it is at a right angle to the card).That is why the Focus Zero (Controller and mounting rails) is the same costas a 20MB drive.The 20MB drive does not contain the rails and will not accept a standarddrive without blocking all the slots. (Which will work for those withcompletely stock systems. No Zip, no TWGS, no nothing. :(If you want to try the driver with a drive type, although, chances are ifyou got the drive without it, it's not compatible. (Unless its in a //e,you don't know) install the driver (from the 3.5" floppy or web site) intothe system folder and reboot. IF your drive starts clicking halfway throughthe boot stage. Get a System Disk 5 or 6 startup disk and from the Finder,remove the driver from the system folder.Tip for upgrading/changing drive types:The Focus controller as is supports up to 2GB, 40 Partitions. Whenpartitioning the new drive at the point you are prompted to type the wordFORMAT, hit Open-Apple RETURN instead. (Like formatting a floppy fromFinder). It will skip the long and un-needed low level format. Unless theIDE drive your using was having bad block problems in it's prior use (andyou shouldn't be using that thing anyway) you do not need to low levelformat the drive.Tony                        (T_DIAZ, 17949, GO COM A2)EPSON STYLUS VS. HP DESKJET FOR THE IIGS   I've received a couple of""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   reports from folks who havesuccessfully used an Epson Stylus with a IIGS. The two things they had incommon were:They were using one of Harmonie's Epson LQ drivers.They connected the Stylus to a parallel interface card.The results were the same:They were NOT able to print in color from GS/OS.They were able to print in color from Print Shop GS.So, perhaps the best term to use when it comes to describing how the Stylusand IIGS interact is "limited compatibility."I don't know what the pricing is like these days outside the San FranciscoBay Area, but quite a few large chain stores near me (Good Guys, OfficeDepot) are blowing out the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 400 for, are you sittingdown, $89.As wonderful as those Epson Stylus printers are when used on otherplatforms, it's the DeskJet IMHO that offers the most IIGS compatibility.And, 89 bucks is just unbelievably great pricing.Joe Kohn                       (JOE_KOHN, 17909, GO COM A2)THE DEAN'S OPINION ON APPLE2.ORG   That is such a fun web page.

Unless they want to be online for anexcessive amount of time, a Compuserve account may also prove cheaper permonth than a standard ISP.In Compuserve they also have an ISP that can be connected to from anywherein the world. They just need to find one of the thousands of localCompuserve access nodes in the local telephone directory.But, to use this method of access to the Net, they will need a IIgs,Marinetti 2.0, and for reasonable Telnet connections, a copy of Spectrum2.2.To access more than Telnet, they will also need FTP clients, mail clients,etc.. These are still in the process of being developed, and are promisedfairly soon.To access the Web, they will need SIS 1.1 under Spectrum 2.2, which Geoffestimates is at least two months away.For an Apple II user, or to access Lynx, they will need a new ISP thatsupports a Unix style shell interface. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Sat 21 Nov 1998 - 242 days till KFest '99 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.2 & Crock O' Gold 2.6 Bernie ][ the Rescue 1.3 woofing on a PowerMac 8200/120 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                        (EWANNOP, 17699, GO COM A2)<<<<<   Ewen - As I said over on CompuServe, I'm a guest there, so I can't"""""   openly promote another system over there without running afoul oftheir rules, but...For those who own only an Apple II, CompuServe will not be, IMHO, a verygood alternative as an ISP after the switch-over.

If they Telnet from Compuserve to Delphiusing the direct dial-up link, Compuserve only allows 7-bit Telnetconnections. That would be fine for Lynx, and some of the other things, butwould not allow any X/Y/Zmodem transfers.If you however make a PPP connection using Marinetti, then there is noproblem.

If it doesn't work the first time, it isworth trying 2 or 3 times just to be sure.You can bend the pins inward or outward, and if you have to do it multipletimes, try both.NOTE!!!!! Those pins are cheap and fragile. Exercise EXTREME CARE (butdon't hesitate to bend them, because if this doesn't work the card isbasically a paperweight anyway :).Gary R. Utter                         (UTTER, 17501, GO COM A2)TONY ON APPLE BRANDED 3.5 DRIVE MECHANISMS   There are two main types of""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Apple 3.5" Drive assemblies.There are actually 5 different variations, but two that matter which Irefer to as 'Red' label and 'Black' label.The difference is in the logic board, in this image is the Red Label drive:http://www.apple2.org/images/DiskDrives&Related/PreLironCloseup.JPEGLooking at the area to the lower right side of the DRIVE, not the cardunder it, notice the solid area in the middle and connecting the pins inthe middle of that 16 pin IC.  O O O-O O O O O      |  \--------\      | SOLID AREA|  Text Diagram      |  /--------/  O O O-O O O O OThe Black Label drive does not have this area filled in, but rather thereare two traces running through there. That is the easiest thing to spotwhen just looking at the drive. The next thing is on the side of the driveis a serial number label, see http://www.apple2.org/35Drv/35Drv8.html foran example. The color of the *NUMBERS* is the drive type.  = Red Label DriveBlack Numbers = Black Label DriveBlue Numbers  = Blue Label Drive.  Blue?!?! Ok, another type. Blue is a1.44 (FDHD) Drive. You can also tell a HD drive by the front, switches arethree mini white or blue shafts, two on one side, one on the other. (WriteProtect, disk inserted and HD or DD)The Nitty Gritty of all this is that over all, only drives of a certaincolor work in certain places. With reference to the Apple II, the onlyconcern is the UniDisk 3.5. It requires a Black Label drive.For completeness, I'll list it all here.Red Label Drive                 Black Label Drive---------------                 -----------------AppleDisk 3.5 (Platinum)        UniDisk 3.5Apple IIc Plus                  Mac 512KeMac SE / Mac II                 Mac PlusMac Plus ** You may find a Red Label drive in a Mac Plus, if so, you will also findwith it a ribbon cable with a YELLOW stripe instead of the RED for pin 1. Ayellow cable is required to use a Red Label drive in a Mac Plus or 512Ke.(Or 128/512 using the 800K As MFS only) The biggest difference in these twodrive types is the eject/disk inserted detection. If you assemble a driveand you have the eject motor constantly going then you have the wrong drivetype installed.Now, for a twist, this is not always the case, some times you will find aBlack Label drive working where it should not be, two reasons, the boardcould have been changed. Properly identify the drive by the bottom instead)or the board has been modified. (You will see several components sleeved inclear plastic, soldered to various points on the logic board.)The Daisy Chain board in a UniDisk is for a UniDisk only, likewise, theboard in the AppleDisk 3.5 and SuperDrive (FDHD) is for those drives only.For the AppleDisk (800K) and SuperDrive (FDHD) the daisy chain board is thesame. You can make a 1.44 from your 800K drive by swapping the driveassembly. The UniDisk daisy chain board is incapable of 1.44. (MFM). TheFDHD Drive Assembly will also work where an 800K drive (Red Label) waswithout any changes, but only as 800K unless controller hardware is presentto support it.

Software that writes directly to entry points in the slotfirmware will break. (I suspect this is how most people found out about theself-test in the card. If you call C50A in a standard GS, you've called thestandard SmartPort i/o entry point for the 3.5" disk firmware. On the FDHDcard, this is the self-test address! Software that follows the rules fordetermining entry points will work, though.)Another limitation (feature, bug, whatever) is related to formatting disksthat have been previously formatted with the "alternate" format, eg.low-level formatting an 800K GCR disk as 720K MFM, or vice-versa. Theformat works, but the drive/card gets very confused afterwards, andbasically becomes unusable until you reboot. It's been a while, but thesymptom is an error like "no disk in drive" or something equally sillyevery time you try to do anything with it. There isn't a problem with 1440Kdisks because they are always MFM format.Hmm, what else? Diversi-Cache no longer provides any benefit if slot 5 is aFDHD card. OTOH, it doesn't break either.BTW: Anyone *NOT* using Diversi-Cache on a GS with the standard 3.5" drivesis crazy!

Themost exciting new features are the new Window menu, support for opening andprinting files from the Finder, and the SIS Tags submenu, providing evengreater support for special SIS features.WebWorks GS 1.2 will be available beginning Thursday, November 5, 1998. Anupdater will be available on my web site and on Delphi, and future disksshipped by Shareware Solutions II will contain version 1.2.If you don't already have WebWorks GS, be sure to visit<http://www.sheppyware.net/software/webworks_gs> for more information aboutthis product, or visit <http://orders.kagi.com?QGC> to place your ordertoday -- online orders are processed by Kagi, and a secure server isavailable! If you'd rather pay by check (or you want to use a credit cardbut trust the postal service more than you trust the Internet), let me knowand I'll email you a Teach containing a form you can fill out and send toKagi with your check.The complete revision notes for the new version of WebWorks GS follow.New Features1. The link dialog boxes now support the HTML TARGET attribute. This letsyou specify a target frame or window for the link.2. Added a new menu option: Edit:Set Editor Font. This lets you choose whatfont you want to use in WebWorks GS editor windows. By default, this isMonaco 9, but you can now change it to anything you want. All windows usethe same setting, and when you change it, all windows are automaticallyreformatted into the new font, style, and size. This preference is saved todisk.3. WebWorks GS now accepts the Open and Print MessageCenter messages. Thismeans you can double-click an HTML file in the Finder (assuming youinstalled the WebWrks.Icons file into the Icons directory), and WebWorks GSwill launch and open the file. This only works for one file; you can'tselect a batch of files and have them all open.4. Added the SIS Tags submenu. This submenu, located in the Layout menu,lets you insert special Spectrum Internet Suite tags. These are:Smiley Face: Displays a smiley faceSad Face: Displays a sad faceSIS-Enhanced: Labels the document as SIS enhancedInsert Sound: Inserts a SIS sound tagInsert Speech: Inserts a SIS speech tagThe Insert Sound option brings up a dialog box that lets you enter the nameof the sound effect to play. This sound will only play if a sound by thesame name is located in the users *:System:Sounds folder, and if the useris using SIS; otherwise, nothing will happen.Insert Speech lets you insert a tag that will speak some text. Choosing theoption brings up a dialog box that lets you enter the text to speak. Thetext will only be spoken if the user is using SIS and has the Byte WorksTalking Tools installed.5. Added a Window menu. This lists all open windows, and lets you switchamong them easily.Bug Fixes1. The Find and Replace window now keeps the contents of the Find andReplace edit fields across uses, so you can repeat searches easily.2. The cursor changes to an arrow while using Find and Replace, instead ofremaining a watch cursor.3. The AppleWorks Special Codes preferences are now saved properly; therewere problems with this in the past.5. The AppleWorks Special Codes dialog no longer automatically convertsstrings into HTML entities; this lets you use HTML in special codes.6. You can use the RETURN key as an equivalent for the OK button in theSpecial Codes dialog box.7. TextEdit fields, including the editor windows, are now much smarterabout selecting text. Smart cut & paste is no longer used (this wasinserting unwanted spaces into the HTML). In addition, the quote ("), comma(,), greater than (>), and less than (<) characters are now treated as wordbreaks, which really makes editing a lot easier.8. Fixed a typo in a warning alert.9. Fixed bugs in low-memory error handling code, and in the code that keepstrack of what untitled window numbers have been used.10. The AppleWorks Special Codes dialog no longer shows garbage forunassigned codes.11. The Find Again button in the Find window actually works.--Eric "Sheppy" Shepherdhttp://www.sheppyware.netCreating software for everyone!                        (SHEPPY, 17271, GO COM A2)<<<<<   WebWorks GS 1.2 is now shipping!"""""Current WebWorks GS owners may download the update at<ftp://ftp.sheppyware.net/pub/apple_iigs/WWGS12Upd.shk>.If you'd like to buy WebWorks GS, visit <http://order.kagi.com/?QGC> toorder online via credit card, or send a $20 check to Joe Kohn of SharewareSolutions II at:Joe Kohn166 Alpine St.San Rafael, CA 94901-1008USAIf you'd like to pay by credit card, but fear the Internet, you maydownload an order form you can print out and send by postal mail at<ftp://ftp.sheppyware.net/pub/apple_iigs/RegForm.shk>.

Thefunctionality of the BatchXFer XCMD is now included within Spectrum 2.2,and the ResEdit XCMD is replaced by the WorkBench XCMD, which includes allthe same functionality plus a whole lot more. Tool calls, GS/OS calls etc.This would not be a problem, but COG 2.5 requires the BatchXFer XCMD torun. In the 2.6 docs it mentions that you can continue to use 2.5 if youare not going to use TCP/IP.So if you wish to continue to use COG 2.5, you will need to keep back acopy of the BatchXFer XCMD, and place it in the Add.Ons:XCMDs folder afterinstallation so that it will still work.The same goes for any script sets that require ResEdit. The only one I canthink of offhand is SIS. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Wed 18 Nov 1998 - 245 till KFest '99 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.2 & Crock O' Gold 2.6 Bernie ][ the Rescue 1.3 woofing on a PowerMac 8200/120 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                        (EWANNOP, 17620, GO COM A2)                             BEST OF THE BEST                             """"""""""""""""17899 26-NOV 22:41 General Chatter     System Configuration     From: JBLAKENEY    To: ALLWell, I just have to let everyone know about my new Apple IIgsconfiguration.  I finally received the second half of a shipment of AppleII stuff and finally have a nice system.  :-)NOTE:  This was posted to comp.sys.apple2 a couple days ago but I've made acouple minor corrections since then.My old configuration first just so you know how big a leap I've taken:     Apple IIgs ROM 01     5.25 MB of RAM  (CVTech w/4 MB and Apple 1 MB)     Stock speed (no accelerator)     Slot 1: Printer Port connected to ImageWriter II           : Grappler+ connected to a Panasonic KX-P2123 (when I'm not             using it on my 486)     Slot 2: Modem Port connected to either a 14.4kbps or a 33.6kbps             modem (depending on whether I feel like swapping cables)           : Empty     Slot 3: Built-in Text Display           : Video Overlay Card     Slot 4: Mouse Port           : Empty     Slot 5: Smart Port with one Apple 3.5 Drive attached           : Empty     Slot 6: Disk Port           : Apple Disk ][ controller with one Disk ][ drive attached     Slot 7: Your Card           : AMR SCSI controller with an AMR 60 MB hard drive attachedNote that the AMR hard drive isn't a whole lot faster than a 3.5" floppydrive.  Also, the reason I was using a Disk ][ controller card was so thatI could turn 5.25" drives on and off using the Control Panel.  When I setslot 6 to Disk Port I didn't have access to the 5.25" drive and when I setit to Your Card I did.I am now running:     Apple IIgs ROM 01     8.25 MB of RAM  (CVTech w/4 MB and a Sequential RAM=GS 4 MB)     ZipGSX v1.02 running at 8 Mhz with 16 kb cache     Slot 1: Printer Port connected to ImageWriter II           : Grappler+ connected to a Panasonic KX-P2123 (when I'm not             using it on my 486)     Slot 2: Modem Port connected to a 33.6kbps modem (I put away the             14.4kbps modem and share the 33.6 kbps with my 486)           : Empty     Slot 3: Built-in Text Display           : ZipGS accelerator (I plan to move this to slot 4 so I can             put my Video Overlay Card in this slot but I need to make             or buy a slightly longer cable first)     Slot 4: Mouse Port           : Empty     Slot 5: Smart Port with two Apple 3.5 Drives attached           : Empty     Slot 6: Disk Port with an Apple 5.25 Drive and a second 5.25" of             one kind or another (I have several) daisy chained to it           : Empty     Slot 7: Your Card           : RamFAST rev D SCSI card (I don't know how much cache)             with a Quantum ProDrive 1225S 1 GB hard drive and a TMS             Pro T155 155 MB tape backup attachedThe 5.25" drive setup has now been reversed.  When slot 6 is set to DiskPort I have access to the 5.25" drives but when it is set to Your Card, Idon't.I've also been lent (with option to buy) an Epson Stylus Color 400 printerbut it doesn't work with the Epson printer but I'm not going to bother youwith that problem right now.  :-)Now my machine is just SO MUCH FASTER!  It now takes about 30 seconds frompower on to being able to use the Finder even with all my add-ons (Finder455k, System 552k, Desk accessories 306k and Setup files 358k according tothe "About This Apple IIgs" window).I was never very fond of Heirarchical menus on my unaccelerated machine butnow the menus get drawn so quickly and the heirarchical sub-menus open andclose so quickly that I don't even notice that they are different fromstandard menus.Wolfenstein 3D runs much better and I finally got to see MegaDemo. GShisenis much nicer to play as it will automatically tell me when there are nomore moves instead of me having to manually ask it to check for remainingmoves.  I was really impressed with how fast ShrinkItGS unpacks files nowand makes me wonder just how fast it would be if I have a math coprocessor.Having 9 32 MB ProDOS and 1 880 MB HFS partition is wonderful.  I finallyhave enough room to sort through the 200-300 archive disks that I haveaccumulated over the years.Anyways, as you can probably tell I'm ecstatic and am enjoying myself to noend.  I'll have to look at upgrading the ZipGS to even faster speeds comethe new year. Jeff Blakeney - Dean of the Apple II University in A2Pro       ** HyperCard IIgs Course now in session! **[EOA][A2P]------------------------------                   A2Pro_DUCTIVITY |-----------------------------------Checking out A2PRO on Delphi""""""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

ORCA/C's startup code for SANE assumes the direct page area has been setup by ORCA/C, including some variables it uses to determine the start andend of this area.

For the specific case of SANE, you might want to juststart it using the tool locator.I really should look at the NDA startup code sometime. You're positive I'mnot already starting SANE, right? I don't think I did, but it's been a_long_ time since I've really looked at that code.Mike Westerfield                       (BYTEWORKS, 2341, GO COM A2)<<<<<   I honestly don't know, Mike.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                [thelamp@sheppyware.net]                USING REMOVABLE HARD DISKS TO SET UP BERNIE                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     As more and more Apple IIgs users also become PowerMacintosh users anddiscover the revolutionary Apple IIgs emulator known as _Bernie ][ TheRescue_, the need to be able to exchange data between the two platformsbecomes more and more apparent.  In this article, we examine how to usesome popular hardware and software--the RamFAST, Iomega Zip Drive, and theMacintosh programs _Hard Disk Toolkit_, _Disk Copy_ and _SCSI Probe_--tomove your IIgs hard drive partitions over to your Mac so Bernie can bark.This article assumes understanding of the concept of disk images,particularly _Disk Copy_ images.  Please consult the documentation for_Disk Copy_ if you need a primer on disk images.     The relevant hardware this method was tested on is as follows:     On the Apple II side of things:     ROM_3 Apple IIgs, 5 mb of RAM, 9/32 ZipGSX accelerator, Revision BRamFAST, 170 mb hard drive, and Iomega Zip Drive.     On the Macintosh side of things:     PowerBook 1400cs, 44 mb of RAM, 750 mb hard drive, and Iomega ZipDrive.     NOTE: These methods have not been tried with other hardware orsoftware, including the popular Apple brand SCSI cards.     The first thing to do is find out how large your hard drive partitionson the IIgs are.  You can get a rough idea by using the command-I keystrokein the IIgs Finder, but the best way is to enter the RamFAST UTIlities (aka_RAMFAST.SYSTEM_), hit command-U to enter the SCSI Utilities, and selectwhich drive you are interested in (if you have more than one drive).  YourSCSI drive's partitions will be listed for you with the volume size next toit.  If you created partitions of the maximum size allowed by the RamFASTfor a ProDOS partition, they will be listed as having a volume size of32768k, if not the partitions will be of varied (smaller) sizes.  You'llwant to jot these numbers down.     Next, using the Mac, fire up _Hard Disk Toolkit_ (or some otherutility which allows you to format and partition a Zip Disk).  You'll wantto partition the Zip Disk to have partition sizes exactly the same as theRamFAST partitions, meaning if your RamFAST partitions are 32768k, you wantthe Zip Disk partitioned by the Mac to also have a partition size of32768k.  It is now time to move this Zip Disk over to your IIgs.     Given that you are in the IIgs Finder, simply unmount (drag to theTrash) the Zip Disk from your Mac and insert the Zip Disk into the ZipDrive attached to your IIgs and RamFAST.  It is likely you will see analert box with an error message similar to the following:"Using the installed FIle System Translators, GS/OS does not recognize thisdisk (in device .CVTECH.S7.G).  Do you want to intialize it?"giving you a choice of initializing or ejecting the disk.     Don't panic.  Simply hit return (you will probably need to do ittwice) to eject the offending partitions.  What is happening here is theRamFAST is detecting a partition that the Mac needs to mount the Zip Diskon its desktop.  You do _not_ want to initialize the partition.     You will end up with the partitions you sized (to 32768K or other sizeof your choice) being mounted on your IIgs desktop.  If you have sized yourZip Disk partitions to be exactly the same size as your IIgs hard drivepartitions, you can now simply do volume copies of your IIgs hard drivepartitions to your Zip Disk partitions (if not, you will have to do theslower file copy).     Following the completion of the copy, drag the Zip Disk partitions tothe IIgs Finder's Trash, eject the disk, then insert it into the Mac's ZipDrive.  You may need to use _SCSI Probe_ or an equivalent to mount theProDOS partitions (Note: you _must_ have _PC Exchange_, _File Exchange_, orsome other program installed on your Mac that will allow mounting ProDOSdisks, and be aware that you must have File Sharing on your Mac turned offto mount ProDOS disks in Mac OS 8 and later).  You can now use _Disk Copy_to make disk image files out of your partitions, and mount them directlywhen using _Bernie_.     You now have the knowledge necessary to transfer all of your RamFAST'shard drive partitions over to your Mac while running _Bernie_.  With alittle ingenuity, I'm sure you can figure out how to use the methodsdetailed in this article to also transfer your data back the other way.  Wewill continue to look at how you can bridge the gap between your real andvirtual Apple II in future issues.[EOA][SUS]------------------------------                 SUDDENLY SOFTWARE |-----------------------------------Disk Access II v2.0 by Seven Hills Solution Specialists Corp."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

In a nutshell, _Disk Access II_ is a New DeskAccessory that allows you to perform all manner of disk and filemaintenance.  In fact, it is so comprehensive it is nearlyfeature-for-feature identical with the IIgs Finder, and in some ways packsfar more power than Finder ever could.     When invoked (either by the pull down Apple menu or a user definedkeystroke), _Disk Access II_ presents a famillar interface, complete withseveral pull down menus of its own.  At the same time, it lists active diskdevices on your IIgs system.  From this point the user can either performdisk level maintenance (such as renaming, copying, or erasing entirevolumes) or click on the any of the listed devices to open it and display alist of its contents, which will be presented similarly to a Finder windowlisting a disk's contents.  Users can do basic file maintenance here byusing _Disk Access II_ to rename, copy, delete, get information about,verify, move, or duplicate files, or create a new folder.  In addition, youcan change any filetype's info or use a powerful find file function thatallows you to search not only on a file's name, but also its filetype,auxtype, created date, modification date, size, existence (ornon-existence) of a resource fork, or its locked, hidden, or inactivestatus--or any combination of the above.     If you work often with a few directories, you can add a shortcut underthe Paths menu to access it instantly.  You can use the Window menu to viewthe contents of files (a great utility for a quick and clean peek into afile's format) or you can create a new window to type yourself a quick notein and then save it as a text file.  It's not as powerful as say _Hermes_or _EgoEd_ but it certainly can be convenient.  Several windows can be openat any one time and you can choose between them using the Window menu.     Like many new programs, _Disk Access II_ comes with documentation ondisk only, in this case in the form of the !Help! NDA, which is freewarefrom Seven Hills.  You can print these out if you'd like, and I suggestreading them thoroughly as this is a program with a lot of sophistication.Familiarity with the documentation will be essential to get the most out of_Disk Access II_.     In short, Seven Hills has a real winner in the form of _Disk AccessII_.  It packs plenty of power (including one of the most powerful findfile functions available for the IIgs) in an attractive package at a lowprice, and those who have avoided one of my personal favorites,_File-A-Trix_, due to the text interface, will likely take instantly to theattractive desktop interface of _Disk Access II_.  Thank you to our friendEwen Wannop for finishing up the program and to Seven Hills for keeping thepromise Apple Computer, Inc. didn't.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :       If we all share our ignorance,                  :         :                      soon we'll have none left.       :         :                                                       :         ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: GSWOMBAT ::::::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
