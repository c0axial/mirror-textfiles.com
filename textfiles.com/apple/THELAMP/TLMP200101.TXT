Then suddenly, the silence was broken bythe siren of a speeding ambulance... lights flashing, rushing to thenearest hospital.  Someone had the need to use the services of the team ofemergency workers already in place... emergency dispatcher, paramedics,doctors, nurses, lab techs, etc.     On December 23 the text side of the Delphi A2 forum slipped into acoma.  We had been warned that after November 1 there would be no morerepairs to the text side of Delphi... no emergency workers in place.     The translator that moves messages from the web side to the text sidewas broken.  (Messages posted on the text side must be moved to the webside and then back to the text side before they are seen on the text side.)After more than a week the text side came to life again.  Then severalbursts of working - not working.  As of this writing the text side is notworking.The Lamp! Threatened~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The Lamp!, as we know it, is threatened by the failure of the textside of Delphi.  The model used to produce The Lamp! is based on gettingthe messages from Delphi A2 and A2P on to the hard drive of the editor'sApple II for selection and editing.  A simple script for a com programquickly and efficiently captures those messages to a file when accessedfrom the text side.  Capturing those same messages from the web side is aslow, tedious process.     There is an alternative.  The Bulletin Board on A2Central.com is upand running and doing quite well.  The messages can be quickly captured toa file.  It looks like the time has come to switch to this source ofApple II discussions as the basis for producing The Lamp!  :)[EOA][TLS]------------------------------                  THE LAMP SALUTES |-----------------------------------APPLE II ACHIEVEMENT, 2000""""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M. Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                [thelamp@sheppyware.net]                     MAY I HAVE THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE?                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     2000 was another great year for the Apple II, and to celebrate it, thegang here at _The Lamp!_ consulted with some of our buddies in the Apple IIworld and came up with a list of the best that the Apple II world had tooffer this past year.  We highlight the best of Apple II achievement in2000.     Keep in mind that the ultimate decision on whom each award went to wasmade strictly by the staff here at _The Lamp!_, namely, me, your publisher.Any comments can be directed to thelamp@sheppyware.net.     BEST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT:   A bunch of contenders, but there's only     """"""""""""""""""""""""   one champion.  Mike Westerfield of ByteWorks got out his CDR burner and heated up the best commercial product ofthe Apple II year (and it wasn't even released at KansasFest).  _Opus ][_,his two CD collection of programs and source, including every single ByteWorks product ever produced, is a must have for programmers and would-beprogrammers alike.  For the rest of the field, the _Totally Sheppyware_book/CD set, the _Time in a Bottle_ CD set, the Juiced.GS _Friends ForLife_ CD, the _A2ROMulan_ CD, and the _LANceGS_ ethernet card were theother major contenders.     BEST SHAREWARE PRODUCT:   An old favorite renewed takes away this     """""""""""""""""""""""   year's shareware award.  Eric "Sheppy"Shepherd's _Lemonade Stand GS_, an updated for the Apple IIgs version ofthe classic educational game that was originally available on cassette tapetakes its place alongside its classic brother.  Using the sound and graphiccapabilities of the Apple IIgs, _Lemonade Stand GS_ will bring a smile tothe face of any long time Apple II user.  Runner up this year came from theShepherd household as well--Sarah Shepherd's initial SarahSoft program, _GSROM Grabber_, a program to help emulator users easily obtain a copy oftheir Apple IIgs ROM image, made its debut at KFest 2000.  Seems theSheppys are trying to corner the Apple II shareware market.     BEST FREEWARE PRODUCT:   One of last year's shareware winners is this     """"""""""""""""""""""   year's freeware winner, but the clear winnersare players of this remarkable 8-bit game.  Jeff Fink's _Silvern Castle_,reclassified this year as freeware, continues to dazzle Apple II gameplayers the world over--and Jeff himself continues to dazzle the Apple IIworld by adding feature after feature.  Every time you think he's gone asfar as he can, he proves you wrong.  Thanks, Jeff.  On the other side ofthe world, Kim Howe's _Arachnid_ World Wide Web browser, still in previewrelease form, is showing great promise for Apple II users the world over.     BEST PUBLICATION:   That Jones boy.  For the third straight year, Max     """""""""""""""""   Jones' _Juiced.GS_ continues to wow _The Lamp!'s_publication staff (Max himself suggested _A2 News and Notes_ as thepublication of the year, leading some to question his sanity).  No matterhow crazy he is, as long as he's crazy about the Apple IIgs, the rest of uswill continue to go crazy over his excellent magazine.  Articlescontributed by well known Apple II fanatics such as Tony Diaz and GeoffWeiss add spice to the cider.  We'll keep taking a serving of _Juiced.GS_here.     OUTSTANDING APPLE II RELATED DEVELOPMENT:   They said it couldn't be     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   done, but it's been done.///SHH Systeme's Joachim Lange has delivered what Apple promised and didn'tdeliver--an Apple II ethernet card.  The _LANceGS_ has made its way by thedozen into the United States from Germany, and it's already changed the wayApple II users think about networking.  Thanks for keeping the promise thatApple didn't, Joachim.     OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT:   He programs, he Webmasters, he     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   runs a business, he gets othersto do what no one thought could be done.  Master Apple II programmer Eric"Sheppy" Shepherd is once again at the forefront of the Apple II community.In between his real job, programming, writing articles for _Juiced.GS_, andoverseeing several World Wide Web sites, he found time to spearhead theeffort to start up an online service run by Apple II users for Apple IIusers--A2Central.com.  And he's only just begun.     Congratulations to all our winners!  Here's hoping that 2001 bringsout the best in all of us again.[EOA][POP]------------------------------              PERSPECTIVE POSITIVE |-----------------------------------AN A2CENTRAL.COM PRIMER"""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M. Suenaga, M.S.W, L.S.W.        [rsuenaga@sheppyware.net]     AN ONLINE SERVICE CREATED BY APPLE II PEOPLE FOR APPLE II PEOPLE     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A BRIEF HISTORY   Before Delphi was Genie, and before Genie was GEnie and"""""""""""""""   before GEnie was Compuserve.  Those were the days whenthe Apple II community was large and the future was bright and unlimited.Those were also the days when online services charged by the hour and itwasn't unheard of for users to spend hundreds of dollars a month on onlineservices.     But times change and so does the nature of telecommunications.  Directdialup has been surpassed by TCP/IP implementations and the per hourcharges have given way to flat rate.  Neither Genie nor Compuserve offertext access anymore, and Delphi, while continuing to provide text access tothose who already have it, makes no promises about repairing it when itbreaks--and it has broken frequently in recent months.  And while thenature of telecommunications has changed, the Apple II hasn't changed instep.  TCP/IP exists for the IIgs at least, but there is no doubt--theApple II handles text much better than it does the current flood ofgraphically based content available on the Internet.     While Delphi attempts to keep up with the Joneses by putting itsresources towards its World Wide Web-based services, Apple II users onDelphi reliant on the text interface face two cold, hard facts: first, thatno Apple II online discussion area that has become generally accessible tothe Apple II user has survived for long--or at all--and second, that whilethe textside on Delphi still exists, no one knows how much longer it willcontinue.  A tenuous future, indeed.FOR US, BY US   Eric Shepherd, the well-known Apple II programmer known as"""""""""""""   Sheppy, read the handwriting on the wall some months ago.He registered the domain name "A2Central.com" and started up an Apple IInews site on the World Wide Web.  The Apple II community raved at the newsite's content, and in the back of the minds of many was what the potentialof such a site could be.     Delphi made its announcement not much later--that its text interfacewould no longer be supported.  A death watch was started, and many wonderedwhere the Apple II faithful would go when it finally met its maker.Instead of wondering, Sheppy took action, recruiting the help of myself,Syndicomm principle Gary Utter, A2Pro veteran Dave Miller, UNIX fanaticDevin Reade, and a bunch of others to begin work on a new online serviceunder the A2Central.com banner.  The alliance was announced at KansasFest2000, with work already underway as A2Central.com sponsored a World WideWebcast of the Apple II event of the year.     The implication of A2Central.com is simple, but also wondrous--it's anonline service designed by Apple II users, created for Apple II users,maintained by Apple II users, and with the interest of the Apple II user atheart.  No longer would we be the victim of corporations chasing the masseswe no longer have at our disposal--finally, the Apple II community wouldhave its own home.     The doors opened in early December.  A2Central.com would take theApple II community by storm.WHERE WE ARE   At this point, A2Central.com's online service has a Real""""""""""""   Time Conference area and a Bulletin Board.  In the immediatefuture is electronic mail, followed shortly thereafter by a file library.Access is currently via telnet--text only, a boon for those of us using theApple II to surf the 'Net.  All the services will be available by the textinterface--and there will also be POP email access, ftp access, and awebside message board.  These are all coming in the near future.     The virtual community has always been an important part of the AppleII world, and in this wired day and age, it's more important than ever.You may not have another user down the block you can turn to, but it's aseasy as ever to find one to help down the road.

Run the SC.READER program under Basic.System (i.e. exit  Silvern) to view them. In addition, you can view all doc files.* The saved game format is no longer compatible with earlier versions,  because of this you must disband your party before installing SCv6.0.* The unique monster generator has been removed. * For those of you with  the Second Sight card, pressing CTRL-Z after exiting the GS control panel  will now quickly restore the graphics screen because Second Sight  incorrectly restores the wrong hi-res page switch.* Speed-up maze plotting slightly.* Text Mode maze support is back.* Depending on level, monsters now have a higher chance to hit 2x per  attack.* Updated a few monsters to add some missing special abilities.* Using non-scroll LIGHT devices (i.e. torch or lanterns) in combat now are  interpreted as thrown flaming missile weapons, doing up to 12hp of damage  to one monster.New stuff* SC now runs under MicroDot, the command shell interface replacement for  Basic.System. MicroDot frees up over 7.5k of memory, so be prepared for  some cool features in future updates to take advantage of this.* Added 13 new items!* Added one new device effect! * Some monsters now have normal weapon  immunity, requiring magic weapons, spells, or devices to hit. You'll get  the "No effect" message if your weapon isn't high enough in enchantment.(TONYW1, 34448, GO COM A2)[EOA][JFF]JEFF FINK ENTERTAINMENT FREEWARE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Name: JFFREEWRE.BXY (Entertainment Software) Date: 16-DEC-2000 01:55   By: HKATZ Size: 344320This archive contains 10 freeware programs written by Jeff Fink, the authorof Silvern Castle.

I recently moved and now have room to setup my GS and remind myself why it is still my favorite. :)Everything was going great until I swapped out the ADB cable for one thatwas in better shape, while the machine was on. Now, I've done this azillion times in the past and it never did anything. But now all of thesudden I have no keyboard or mouse, even after restoring the originalcable. (This is the standard GS keyboard and mouse btw) I tried hooking upanother keyboard mouse (apple extended) which I know is working, and hadthe same problem. Still dead. So now I'm scared something happened to thecontroller on the motherboard.Also, if it helps troubleshoot, the 3 lights on the extended keyboard blinknormally when the machine is powered up. But after that I can't triggeranything (caps lock, etc.) One time after I let it sit for about 3 minutesat the finder, the caps lock light suddenly came on by itself. (almost likeit buffered the keypress)Oh yeah - the machine isn't frozen either. Screensavers still kick on and Ican mount floppies, etc.Has anybody seen anything like this before? Thanks for any advice. I'mgoing to continue to look for replacement parts to test with.- Matt Portune(MPORTUNE, 34507, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""I have, and it was a blown ADB chip.

It was only a year it was absent from my desk,but I certainly missed it nonetheless).It's quite possible the ADB micro-controller got fried, though beforegiving up I'd suggest pulling every card and connector from the machine,removing the motherboard from the case and rest it on an anti-static bag(in case something is being shorted) and it power it up with nothingconnected _except_: A known working keyboard and ADB cable, powersupply anda video device. Also, try clearing the BRAM memory by removing the batteryfor a couple of minutes and reinserting it (you had a ROM 3 board, right?).I've seen all sorts odd things happen from corrupted BRAM memory, once myZipGS was stuck in disabled mode until I cleared it.If after all that it's still not responding to the keyboard, I guess you'llhave to replace the mainboard. Fear not though, ROM 3 motherboards arequite cheap on the used market, sometimes even free. I'm actually planningto swap ROM 3 boards on my main IIgs system to try and solve some stabilityproblems with my 15/64 ZipGS.Good luck!Mitchell Spectormailto: <spec@total.net>(SPECTOR1, 34520, GO COM A2)[EOA][SCS]APPLE SCSI CARD SWITCHES""""""""""""""""""""""""This Apple SCSI card (820-0153-A 1990) has four dip switches.  What is thepurpose of these switches?>>>>>"""""That would be the Apple High-Speed SCSI card. The four DIP switches areused for setting DMA and changing the SCSI-ID address for the card itself(not external devices on the chain).Here are the actual settings:SW1 = open=DMA _off_, closed=DMA _on_SW2 = SCSI adrs bit 2, open=0, closed=2^2 (4) MSBSW3 = SCSI adrs bit 1, open=0, closed=2^1 (2)SW4 = SCSI adrs bit 0, open=0, closed=2^0 (1) LSBThe default is all four switches in the closed position (either all up, orall down. Unfortunately I can't recall exactly which since I don't have myHS SCSI card in front of me to tell you whether 'closed' is up or down. Itis marked on the card however).That is: DMA enabled and SCSI-ID #7. That should be fine in most cases,except when a non-DMA card is present in the system (DMA is automaticallydisabled if more than 4MB is present in the expansion slot, unlike theRamFAST SCSI which can DMA with up to 8MB present).Mitchell Spectormailto: <spec@total.net>(SPECTOR1, 34784, GO COM A2)[EOA][MDP]MESSAGE FROM DELPHI PRESIDENT"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The following was posted by Delphi President Rusty Williams elsewhere onDelphi.===snip===From: Rusty Williams (RUSTY) 11:56 amTo: ALL 1 of 1550.1As all of you know, the market for web-based advertising and investorsentiment towards consumer web services have both taken a significantdownturn in recent months. Delphi.com has been in a better position thanother services because we've benefited from the collective support andcontributions that our members make to the service. In effect, Delphi is acooperative -- a true community of people who are inclined to help eachother. Even with this advantage, we' ve reached a point where more costcutting is required.This week we had to take the additional step of eliminating some of thesupport positions within our staff. We've have a close-knit team dedicatedto making Delphi a valuable service for everyone. To eliminate somepositions was especially painful because everyone on our staff isenthusiastic about Delphi's value and potential for growth. So on a veryhuman level these changes have been quite difficult.There have been rumors in recent weeks about Delphi shutting down. Whilethis was discussed as all options were on the table, it was never seriouslyconsidered. It's extremely expensive to provide all of the systems andinfrastructure required to support a site the size of Delphi. However, weall have confidence that the pendulum that swung so fast from "irrationalexuberance" to "irrational pessimism" will eventually swing back to a morerational valuation of services such as Delphi. We decided that we should doour best to preserve the value of the friendships and communities onDelphi.com while minimizing our costs.Where will you notice these changes? We'll be experimenting with variousways to automate or outsource functions such as service support, promotionsapprovals and forum indexing. As a general rule, we're hoping to automateservices and functions that can run reasonably well in a self-regulatingenvironment. We simply can't afford to provide a lot of support or specialconsideration to forums or end-users who have high maintenancerequirements. If it costs us a lot to support from a staffing perspective,we need to find new ways to reduce the costs.For example, a specific change that we're making is the way we handle thepublic index. Instead of reviewing and approving index submissions on adaily basis, we'll review submissions for the most active forums once amonth. This isn't great for news for new and less active forums - many ofwhich will never make it to the public index - but it will be much moreefficient for our support staff.I hope it's clear that we're committed to making Delphi a success. By"hunkering down" during this time period we expect that Delphi willcontinue to be the best place on the web to build an interactive forum.And because Delphi is hosted by Prospero along with hundreds of othercorporate clients, Delphi will benefit from upgrades and new features asthey are requested by this broader group of users. We'll need yourpatience, assistance, and willingness to try new approaches. In return,we'll do our best to maintain Delphi.com as a free service with as manyfeatures as possible.Thanks for your understanding and support.Best regards,Rusty WilliamsDelphi.com===snip===CHunk_S --- Your A2 Forum Host -- (chunk.s@foxvalley.net)(CHUNK_S, 34894, GO COM A2)[EOA]------------------------------------     DISTILLATIONS FROM DELPHI A2P |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[SXC]SPECTRUM XCMDS""""""""""""""Is there any way to get the Lister XCMD in Spectrum to deal with a listthat has spaces in each line?

In each folder there is a 'Read.Me.First' file. Those files willgive you full instructions on how to update Spectrum 2.4 to 2.5.1, and howto install the SOAR reader.Spectrum 2.5.1 is required by SOAR. This release of an updater is a publicBeta test of Spectrum 2.5.1 for owners of Spectrum 2.4 only. If there areno reported problems, then Spectrum 2.5.1 or later will be available in thenormal way from Shareware Solutions in due course. Please immediatelyreport anything you find in 2.5.1 that does not work as expected to<speccie@mac.com> or <conductor@a2people.com>.May I stress that this is the first release of SOAR, and although it hasbeen extensively tested, it is still at beta level v1.0b1. SOAR is a livingentity, and it will be upgraded on a regular basis as new features areactivated by me and new options in A2Central become live.I will especially be interested in comments, bug reports and wish listsfrom you for SOAR, and I will issue updates of the core scripts as and whenthese are needed.So don't delay, SOAR away... Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Wed 17 Jan 2001 - 189 days till KFest '01 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum v2.5.1 & SOAR 1.0b1 Setup: Bernie ][ the Rescue 3.0 and a Blue & White G3/350 http://www.ewannop.btinternet.co.uk/(CONDUCTOR, CAT2,  TOP3, MSG:12/A2Central.com)[EOA]------------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------[NLE]NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA][LTE]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]KFest 2001""""""""""                                Plan Ahead                                ~~~~~~~~~~KFest 2001 is set for July 25-29 (early arrivals on July 24) at AvilaCollege.
