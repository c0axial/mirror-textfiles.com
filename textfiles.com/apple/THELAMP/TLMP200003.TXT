It kind offilled this brief gap between the high-density floppy disk (1.4 MB) and theZip disk and its brethren. The floptical disk holds 20 MB of data.A floptical drive can read and write floptical disks, 1.4 MB floppy disks,and 720 KB floppy disks.This is its big advantage on the IIgs -- a SCSI device that lets you usehigh-density floppies on your IIgs.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 29547, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""Wasn't the floptical the one that used a laser to write the info onto themedia? Sort of an early precursor to today's CD-R, except it could use, asSheppy noted, the "standard" 3.5" disks.later...........Howard(HKATZ, 29553, GO COM A2)<<<<<"""""Actually no. The floptical used a light beam to position the disk heads, byshining the beam onto the ring at the center of the disk. The ring wasdesigned to reflect the beam in such a way as to tell the drive where onthe disk the drive's read/write head is positioned. This way, the drive canread and write with such accuracy in positioning of the bits that more datacould be packed onto the disk.Standard drives work by basically guessing where to start reading, andreading until they find the desired data, and they write by reading untilthey see data indicating the start of the track or sector they want towrite to, then blasting away, hoping they don't miss.Classic drives waste a lot of disk space in "slop" space -- areas filledwith patterns of data used to identify the position of the read/write headon the disk, and to allow some flexibility. If the drive writes a littlelate, it simply causes that sector of data to wander a little on the disk.This doesn't happen with flopticals, so there doesn't need to be much (orany) slop space; the entire disk is used for actual data. And because thehead can be moved with more precision, more tracks and sectors can becrammed onto each disk.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 29563, GO COM A2)[EOA][MOD]MAGNETO-OPTICAL DRIVES""""""""""""""""""""""I have a couple Magneto-optical drives that use a 600ish meg cartridge.I believe they use a laser to cause a phase change within the media beforethe data is magnetically written. I could be wrong on this.They are SCSI, and the do work on a Mac.Paul(PAULFXL, 29575, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""They come in different sizes both physically and how much data you canstore on them. There is a 3.5" version that holds 128 MB per cartridge and5.25" drives that can hold 650 MB or 1.3 GB depending on the drive.  Thereare probably other sizes as well.The disk material of a magneto-optical drive is indeed magnetic but thepolarity of the magnetic field cannot be change unless the disk material isheated to around 200 degrees fahrenheit. This is where the laser, thus theoptical part of the name, comes in. The laser heats the disk surface and amagnet held near the surface of the disk causes the magnetic polarity ofthat spot on the disk to reverse.Because these drives work this way, they cannot be erased by putting amagnet on them. The data can't be changed without heating the disk up.I've been wanting a magneto-optical drive since I first read about themaround ten years ago. Do you happen to have any cartridges for thosedrives? I'd be happy to take one (or possibly even both) if I can afford topay for them.

The new connector may not match the holes, you pulling thecable out of the holes you stretched it and otherwise torqued it all up.Those headers are usually meant to go on once. (IDC = InsulationDisplacement Connector) You need to make a whole new one for absolute pieceof mind. Other wise you will be blaming possible crashing on something elseand it's really a bad cable. Likewise the shorter that cable is the betteroff you are.I'll say it now, DO NOT MESS WITH THE SOCKET ON THE MOTHERBOARD UNLESS ITIS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. That means that you plug that ZipGS cable back inwhen you are 100% sure it is going to work - You may wreck the socket andor weaken it to where this also causes system reliability problems. Thereare A LOT of factors in messing with accelerators. Be aware. Do it once, doit right or do not mess with it at all. But removing and installing thatDIP header in that socket is NOT a good thing to do. I make it sound likeit will die after a couple insertions - It might or it might last but thelonger but I'll say this much, the socket was designed for a DIP IC, notthose headers, which push straight down and after a long time only theheader will end up only what will work, an not the IC anymore and you willthink that the motherboard got killed and throw up your hands. This is thedeath of many systems and it's only the socket.Enough of that, I'm not trying to scare anyone off, just stress the fact ofthe matter at hand, that the cable is a very important link. Obviously. ;-)To make a new cable you need a 40 pin IDC DIP header and for simplematters, get an IDE cable for a PC. Then you have two ends. Use the endthat has the cable going in the same direction and orientation as the Zipcable. Trim it at 2 inches and then slide the new header over the end andproceed to crimp it down. This is done best with a vise and small piece ofwood or metal in the area between the pins. If you do not know how to crimpribbon cables (read: have little to no experience with it using the pliersmethod) then you will most likely ruin the cable and header if you do notuse the vise method.As far as overall system/accelerator reliability goes, here are some areasthat make a BIG impression on the situation:The Power Supply Connector - A 'buggie' P/S is not needed, the problem isnot that you do not have enough power, the problem is the connector isgoing bad.  (If you notice slight intensity changes in your backgroundswhen drives are accessed this is your problem. Remove the connector andclean the pins so they are more silver than gray again, bend them slightlytoward the power supply and put the connector back, take a papermate pencap or pen and shove it between the connector and power supply to stressthe connector against the pins. The pen works because you can put the otherend of the pen between the wires and power supply where they come out ontop, this will lock it in there and keep it from moving, and it's just theright length.The CPU socket - If you've ruined it or it's very easy to take the CPU out(You can lift it out with just a little finger pressure) then you need toreplace it, (note, get someone good at soldering), the ideal replacement isa gold plated machine pin socket, or at least a machine pin socket. Youwill NEVER have a CPU socket problem again.The Accelerator Cable - Long may be convenient, but not better. If yourgoing to play with oscillators than you want the cable to be shorter forbetter results. With a ROM 01, slot 4 is a good choice but requires alonger cable.  Slot 3 is a great choice otherwise if you have a tightsystem. 99% of the times I put them in slot 3, even with every slot filled.You plan your 'attack' with things like this in mind:The Quickie card works in any slot regardless of control panel setting.The VOC works in any slot in a ROM 3, only slot 3 on ROM 1. Get the wiremod if needed to use the VOC in another slot on a ROM 1.  ProTERM andSpectrum both use the modem port regardless of control panel setting sothat means slot 2 is automatically a 'free' slot. Harmonie Printer Driversuse the card in a slot regardless of control panel settings. If you do notprint from ProDOS 8 you can put the printer card in slot 4 or 5, somethingthat is otherwise 'lost' due to a port in the back.  Or in slot 2 if youuse Spectrum or ProTERM to dial out since they will go directly to thehardware.  The Vision Plus card with Allison ROM works in any slotregardless of Control Panel setting.Get the idea? I don't see a need for a longer cable that is a contributingfactor in system instability when you can plan the card strategy a littlefurther and eliminate the need for the accelerator being further away.It's got to be plugged in somewhere .. .. or does it? :)  That is a topicfor the advanced, you can run the ZipGS not in a slot at all but in thatcase it's best to at least hook the +5 and GND lines to something but notnecessary if you are not playing the clock game with it.Now I have a system running at 16.5MHz, it runs very well, gives noproblems at all .. this is not the norm for everyone. This is the MarkTwain system with a very well prepared Transwarp GS in it. Those detailsare covered on my web page in somewhat detail - I won't go over it here.This is already long enough. :) What I am getting at is I recommend 10MHzas a good place to go. 12MHz for a ROM 3 in good working order, 10MHz for aROM 01 system.These are the points where your extended long term reliability is utmostguaranteed with the other factors I mentioned taken into consideration.I also recommend only 32K cache on a ZipGS over 11 MHz as well, I recommendusing the original 8K cache board modified to 32K cache instead of thenewer cache card with 32K on it. The mod is a bit interesting but the yieldis much better in my opinion.See the web pages at http://www.apple2.gs for more details.Perhaps I could do an accelerator session at KFest -- It would need to be alittle longer than the typical session.Tonyhttp://www.apple2.gs <-- What?

It's also not for the feint-of-heart.Here's a quick overview of what you need to do. You'll have to writeassembly code; there's no way to read multiple keys at once from anythingbut assembly code.1. I suggest setting up an array of boolean variables. Each one will   indicate whether or not the corresponding key is currently pressed. This   array will be using the ADB keycode, not the ASCII code, for the   character. There should be 128 entries.2. To begin monitoring the keyboard, perform these steps:   a. Disable keyboard autopolling. This is done by calling SendInfo. The      ADB command is command 1 (setModes), and there's one data byte which      should be 1 (disable autopoll). This gives you the ability to      interfere in the keyboard polling process, instead of just being an      idle observer. Yum.   b. Set up an SRQ polling routine. Call SRQPoll, passing in a pointer to      your completion routine (we'll talk about this in a minute). The      keyboard is always device number 2.   c. Because you're taking over the job of handling the keyboard (you      lucky guy), you have additional responsibilities. Because the control      panel will re-enable autopolling, you need to be able to turn it back      off again. So call GetVector on toBRamSetupVector to get a pointer to      the BRAM update vector. Save this pointer, you'll need it.   d. Call SetVector on toBRamSetupVector. Your replacement vector needs      to be a function that reenables autopolling, just like you did in      step a.   e. If the main program is in C, you might put in code to call the C      atexit() function, passing in a pointer to your function that      disables your keyboard capture code. This will cause your hooks to be      removed safely if your program exits unexpectedly.3. The function to shut down your keyboard polling should restore the   original toBRamSetupVector, call SendInfo to reenable autopolling   (command clearModes, data byte 1) and call SRQRemove to remove your   polling procedure. Be sure to call this function before your application   quits or the system will crash.4. Your SRQ completion routine will be called whenever a key is pressed or   released.   a. There is a long pointer on the stack that points to the data received      from the keyboard.   b. The first byte in the returned data is the number of bytes received.      If it's zero, don't do anything, just return.   c. AND the received data with $7F7F. If the result is $7F7F, this is a      special command (such as the reset key) and will require special      processing. See below for details on how to handle this.   d. Otherwise, the data bytes are ADB keycodes. The high bit of each byte      indicates whether the key was pressed or released. Update your key      status array.   e. You also need to interpret each key and pass it along if necessary.      If the keycode is $E0 or greater, it's a prefix code and should be      ignored. If it's between $36 and $3B, inclusive, it should be sent.      Likewise, if it's a keyboard modifier key that's not already held      down, the keycode should be sent (you'll need to check the keyboard      modifiers register to see if the key is already down).   f. If the key needs to be passed along, call SendInfo. The command is      keyCode, the data should be the keycode (including the high bit      press/release flag).5. If the reset key was pressed (see above for how to detect this), you   need to dispatch the reset command correctly.   a. You should only dispatch when the reset key is released, so if the      high bit of the reset keycode is set, don't reset.   b. If the high bit is clear, you need to look at the keyboard modifiers      register to see what type of reset to issue. If the control key isn't      down, the reset key should be ignored.   c. If the control key is down, you need to actually perform a reset.      This is done by calling SendInfo with the command resetSys. There are      no data bytes.That should do the trick. The code isn't actually all that hard to write.The ADB Tool Set chapter of TBR1 has some errors, so be sure to look at theappropriate technical notes and the Hardware Reference chapter on the AppleDesktop Bus. Wherever my dissertation above deviates from thedocumentation, my dissertation is probably more accurate, since this isbased on actual code (code I can't share, but code nonetheless).Hope this helps. Good luck. There's a reason why only one IIgs programreleased to date actually recognizes multiple keys at once -- it's not easyto do.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 2905, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""To clear up an apparent contradiction...I say the code isn't hard to write, but I also say reading multiple keysisn't easy to do.

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.          [thelamp@sheppyware.net]                         The KFest FAQ Version 2.0                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The following article is set up in a form commonly seen on theInternet, called Frequently Asked Questions.  It is designed to answer someof the most common questions people have about KansasFest, the Apple IIevent of the year.  It is not designed to answer general questions aboutthe Apple II, although there may be some overlap.     Any questions about this article can be sent via email tothelamp@sheppyware.netQ: What's a FAQ, and how is it pronounced?A: The letters "FAQ" stand for _F_requently _A_sked _Q_uestions.  When   people first hear of or learn of a subject, such as KansasFest, they   often have a number of questions which others before them did when they   also first learned of the same subject.  A FAQ is a document listing   both the questions and answers most frequently associated with new   users, to save themselves (and others trying to assist them) time and   frustration.   And by the way, it's pronounced "fack", nearly identical to "fact".Q: What is the purpose of this FAQ?A: This FAQ is set up to assist people interested in KansasFest, also known   as KFest.  Many Apple II enthusiasts are interested in attending or just   want some information about this event, so the most common questions are   answered here.Q: How can this FAQ be distributed?A: The content of this FAQ is copyright 1999-2000 by Ryan M. Suenaga, the   publisher of _The Lamp!_.  Distribution without the expressed written   consent of the copyright holder is prohibited.Q: What is KFest?A: KansasFest, abbreviated "KFest", is a computing conference held every   summer at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  Its original formal   name was "The Apple II Summer Conference" while its nickname was   "KansasFest", which was abbreviated to "KFest".Q: When was the first KFest held?A: The first KansasFest was held in 1989.  It was originally sponsored by   Resource-Central, the folks who brought you the wonderful _Open-Apple_   and _A2-Central_ (among several other Apple II) publications.  After   Resource-Central became ICON, The Apple II Summer Conference became   ICONference.  This lasted one summer until ICON shut down.  Two   different companies sponsored KFest before Intrec Software, publishers   of _ProTERM_, took over a few years back.  This July will welcome the   12th KFest.Q: When is KFest this year?A: KansasFest 2000 runs from Wednesday through Sunday, July 26-30, 2000.   For the second year, KFesters are being offered an extra night, Tuesday,   July 25, at the Avila dorms if they want to come into town a day   early--and it seems most everyone does.Q: Where is KFest held?A: KFest is held at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  The address   and phone number are:          Avila College          11901 Wornall Road          Kansas City, Missouri  64145          United States of America          (816) 942-8400Q: If it's held in Missouri, why is it called KansasFest?A: I dunno.  If it makes you feel better, the Kansas border is very close   to Avila College.Q: Who comes to KFest?A: While KFest was originally devoted to programmers, nowadays all kinds of   folk from all over the world show up at Avila College.  Programmers,   users, newsletter publishers, and everyday folk show up from Europe,   Canada, Australia, and all over the United States to celebrate the   Apple II.Q: Who organizes KFest?A: Currently, KFest is organized by a committee headed by The Big Cheese,   Cindy Adams.  The scheduling is done by Steve "Godzilla" Gozdziewski.   There are several other folks on the committee as well: Jerry Cline,   Allen Moore, Max Jones, and Stan Marks all pitch in.  In addition to   those good folk on the committee, David Kerwood handles the maintenance   of the World Wide Web site, Devin Reade maintains the email lists, and   Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd provides World Wide Web hosting services and   organizes HackFest, the programming contest.  KFest is sponsored by   Intrec Software.Q: How do I register for KFest?  How much does it cost?A: Depending on when you register, registration prices vary.  If you   register early, you'll get a better deal; if you register early -and-   you're a repeat KFester (meaning you've been to KFest within the last   couple of years), you'll get an even better deal (but at the time of   this writing, that deadline has passed). Please check the KFest Home   Page at http://www.kfest.org/ for the most current information.Q: What kind of official activities go on at KFest?A: Officially, there is a keynote speech (this year given by Ryan Suenaga,   publisher of _The Lamp!_--hey, that's me!), sessions on various   computing topics, HackFest, a celebrity roast (Apple IIgs programming   prodigy Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd being the victim of honor this year),   product demonstrations, and a vendor fair.Q: What kind of unofficial activities go on at KFest?A: Unofficially, there's been movie outings, pizza nights, Bite The Bag   contests, late night eating at Denny's, and huge groups of folks going   to eat huge pieces of beef at K.C. Masterpiece and Jess and Jim's   restaurants.Q: Has anyone attended every KFest?A: One person: Tony Diaz of Alltech Electronics.  Mike Westerfield missed   his first KFest in 1999; let's hope he gets back on the beam in 2000.Q: I hear that the Avila College dorm is wired for ethernet.  Is there a   way I can access that while I'm there?A: Yes.  In each dorm room in the halls of Avila are two outlets that seem   to be phone jacks.  These _aren't_ phone jacks.  They're ethernet   ports--to be exact, they're RJ-45 connectors that are compatible with 10   Base-T ethernet.  The entire Avila dorm is connected to the Internet   this way, making for high speed World Wide Web browsing, electronic   mail, and ftp connections for KansasFesters during their stay!   While those bringing their true blue Apple IIs will be needing to go the   tried and true modem route, those KFesters who bring ethernet-capable   computers can make full use of these high speed connections.  Let's look   at what hardware and software is needed to get this high speed resource   working with your non-Apple II.THE HARDWARE   All Avila provides is the RJ-45 jack.  This looks like an""""""""""""   overgrown RJ-11 jack (the kind your telephone plugs into),and in fact, it's a close relative.  What you need to bring is a computerwith an appropriate 10 Base-T ethernet interface and a cable that ends in amale RJ-45 jack.  There are many, many of these cables on the market.  Ifyou are going to purchase one, be sure it's a straight-through class 5cable, not a crossover cable.  Additionally, due to the way the RJ-45 jackis mounted, you will need a cable ending with a RJ-45 male jack that is notmolded with a surrounding sheath, as the cable will not fit properly.  Youwant a cable end that looks like this:ASCII ART BEGINS      ___________     |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |  <--- Male RJ-45     |   |   |   |     |   |___| <-|------ Locking tab     |           |     |           |     |           |     |___________|       |       |       |       | <------ Cable       |       |as opposed to this:      ___________     |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |  <--- Male RJ-45     |   |   |   |     |   |___| <-|------ Locking tab     |           |     |           |    _|___________|_   |               |   |               |   |               |   |               | <-- Large, molded sheath   |               |   |               |   |_______________|       |       |       |       | <------ Cable       |       |ASCII ART ENDS     I had problems with this at KFest 1998.  If you need to get differentcables (or need other hardware in general) you can ask your fellowattendees if they have extras, or you can run over to the CompUSA in thearea to get what you need.  If someone brings an Ethernet hub, perhaps youcan plug into that instead of into the jack provided by Avila.     Once you have this equipment, simply plug in your RJ-45 cable into theprovided jack.  You do not need an ethernet hub unless you'll be runningmore than two devices in your room.THE SOFTWARE   The Avila ethernet server uses a protocol called Dynamic""""""""""""   Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP, for short.  Thoseof you who have set up TCP/IP connections with Windows or Macintoshcomputers (or, for that matter, the Apple IIgs) probably have somefamiliarity with inserting IP addresses, DNS addresses, and Gatewayaddresses.  The beauty of DHCP is that it sets up nearly everything youneed dynamically, meaning that the server assigns these addresses--all youneed to do is set up TCP/IP on your computer and choose the DHCP protocol.I am much more familiar with the setup of DHCP for Macintosh computers thanfor Windows machines, and am taking the Windows instructions from areference.MAC   To set up a Macintosh running Open Transport networking for DHCP,'''   all that needs to be done is to switch the TCP/IP protocol to DHCPServer.  So:(1) Get into your TCP/IP Control Panel;(2) Select "Ethernet" (or "Built-in Ethernet" or "Alternate Ethernet" as    appropriate) in the "Connect via:" field;(3) Select "DHCP Server" in the "Configure" field;(4) Quit and save the changes.WINDOWS 95   To set up a Windows 95 machine for DHCP, there are several''''''''''   additional steps:(1) Get into your Network Control panel;(2) Add or select the appropriate ethernet interface;(3) Set the "Obtain an IP address automatically" control in the "IP    Address" tab of the TCP/IP Properties window;(4) Remove any existing setting for a Gateway address in the "Gateway"    tab of the TCP/IP Properties window;(5) Disable DNS in the "DNS Configuration" tab of the TCP/IP Properties    window;(6) Save the settings and reboot the computer.     Regardless of which platform you use, if you have software set up toshare your hard drive with other computers, you probably ought to disableit--unless you like everyone in the Avila ethernet having access to yourfiles.     At this point, you ought to be connected.  If you previously had anyproxy servers set up for use with your setup before Avila, disable them.You ought to have easy access for checking mail, browsing the Web, or usingfile transfer protocol--and very high speeds.  One last caveat:THE SMTP SERVER   As Spam on the Internet proliferates, it has become"""""""""""""""   accepted practice to close off an Internet ServiceProvider's mail sending server--usually using Simple Mail TransferProtocol, or smtp--to access from anyone who is not directly connected tothe ISP.  In other words, no one wants to be a relaying point for Spam.     Because of this, it's likely you will not be able to use the same smtpserver you use at home to send mail while at Avila.  We encountered thisproblem briefly last year and solved it by using the smtp.delphi.com smtpserver--however, in the last year, Delphi also closed its server to access.     It is believed that there is a mail.avila.edu smtp server that can beused while at Avila, but I have not fully researched this yet.  See mewhile you're at KFest for the latest developments.Q: How can I learn more about KFest?A: You can get more information on KansasFest by visiting the KansasFest   World Wide Web site at http://www.kfest.org/ or sending email to   kfest-help@kfest.org.  You could also subscribe to the KFest mailing   list by sending email to majordomo@kfest.org.  In the body of the email   include the text:          subscribe kfestYou will receive a confirmation email with instructions on finalizing yoursubscription.Q: Should I go to KFest?A: Need you ask?  KFest is a must for the serious Apple II fanatic.  Do   yourself a favor--you're worth it.

I had just finished working my way through MikeWesterfield's excellent "Toolbox Programming in C" course and I was playingwith a few ideas about something to write. It seemed to me that if youcould create web sites on the GS, you should be able to view them as well,so I started playing with a bit of code.     I downloaded the HTML specs from the net and picked out a handful oftags and wrote a basic parser, which surprised me by not working too bad.I could open and view some very basic pages. Then I thought that sinceMarinetti was available why not try to have it download some pages? So withthe help and advice of the people on the Marinetti list I put together abasic http transport and successfully got some pages to load up and displayfrom the net.     About this time there was some discussion on Delphi about GraphicalWeb Browsers for the GS. Since I'd really enjoyed what I had already done,I decided it would be interesting to develop it into a full package, andultimately even have as much graphics support as possible.     Sheppy said the reason to develop a program for the GS is becauseyou're enjoying it, and I am. Currently I have a web page up with ascreenshot of the current version. I'm working on the user interface at themoment, and once I get it so it's usable I plan to release a previewversion, hopefully in the next few weeks. It wont be very useful at thatstage...  it has a long way to go yet, but people should be able to get anidea of the user interface and see their GS download a couple of simplepages.     After the user interface is done, the next stage is to redo the httptransport. At present once you enter a URL the program takes over and won'tlet you do anything until the page is downloaded and rendered. You can'teven cancel it. I really want to be able to download one page while viewinganother, and have it responsive to the user, so this will need almost acomplete rewrite. Once that is done I'll get down to the serious businessof supporting as much as possible of the HTML standards, then onto thegraphics.The Arachnid web page is at<http://www.omninet.net.au/~khowe/arachnid/index.html>[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
