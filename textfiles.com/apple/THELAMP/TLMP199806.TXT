There's quite a few of us whodrop in on our patients in the maternity ward (both the mothers andbabies)--obstetricians, gynecologists, nurses, pediatricians, socialworkers (of course), more nurses, and the vital statistician.     Who's the "Vital Statistician"?  It's the person who takes care of"vital statistics", the numbers and records the state keeps on such thingsas deaths--and births.  At our hospital, it's a wonderful woman namedDiana, who usually greets me in the morning by saying, "Hi, Ryan," andwithout pause, the next word out of her mouth is invariably a number--todayit was "nineteen."     Nineteen wasn't the number of new babies we had come into the worldovernight, nor it the number of times a first time mother changed her mindabout her baby's first name.  It was the days left until her vacationstarted.  You see, every morning, like clockwork, Diana would go into heroffice, sit at her desk, and draw a diagonal line through another box onher calendar, crossing off yet another 24 hour period until she boarded aplane to take her far away from her daily duties.     The morning of this writing, I started my own countdown aswell--fifty.  Fifty days until I started my vacation, first heading over tothe Bay Area again for an impromptu PizzaFest, followed by my first everrouting through Denver to make it to KansasFest 1998.     There's as many stories titled, "How I got to KFest" as there areKFest attendees every year, but they all have the same ending: I got there,I met people different from me, but just like me, and I had the most fun Ican remember--which is what KansasFest is all about.     Since the Apple II Community is indeed a community, like any other, weneed a City Hall and an annual Town Meeting.  That City Hall is located atAvila College in Kansas City, Missouri, and its Town Meeting starts thisyear on July 22nd.  It's where the last survivors of the first generationof computer activists can come together to celebrate the first family ofcomputing: the Apple II.     And when I get back from my trip across the sea and get back to workon a Tuesday morning, I'll see Diana, and after greeting her, the firstthing out of my mouth will be a number--probably around 350.                                [*] [*] [*]     Oops, There It Is Department: I noticed an error with regards to the_BernieBook FAQ_.

Also, it would help having a copy of NVRAM settings since they areprogrammable (if you write &C1&D0 into the NVRAM, it doesn't need to beadded to the INIT string--when I used a LineLink 14.4, I had set the NVRAMso I didn't need an INIT string :).Geoff                       (SISGEOFF, 12208, GO COM A2)MORE ROM_3 VS. ROM_01   On a ROM 3 the ADB mouse calls go directly to the"""""""""""""""""""""   hardware, on a ROM 01 they go through slot 4.System software will work on a ROM 3 with the slot set to Your Card, butnot a ROM 01.When I get to play slot roulette with people on the phone the first thing Iask is "What ROM do you have?", If you have a ROM 3 you get one more slotthat can be declared "Your Card".Cards that need no slot I/O space (Vision Plus Enhanced, Quickie, etc.) donot present a problem for most people. I frequently get calls of, "All myslots are full", and I can usually find one or two free ones for them withjust one swap.Both Spectrum and ProTERM do not care what the slot setting for slot 2reads. If your using Harmonie, it's drivers go directly to the card/portand do not care what the slot setting for 1 is. That's two "selectable"slots. Accelerator in Slot 3, takes care of that. If you need Slot three ina ROM 01 for the Second Sight or Video Overlay, put the Zip/TWGS in Slot 4since you can't use Slot 4 for anything in a ROM 01.A lot of people tell me, "But.. I've got a 5.25" drive". Yes? ..and if youcan tell me when the last time you used it was.."  To which the replyusually is something along the lines of "Um, well, 3 months ago."Ok, so, put the PC Transporter, or that other SCSI card in slot 6, set itto Your Card, you will probably use that other hardware more. If you needto get access to a 5.25" disk, swap the slot setting, reboot, move thefiles, and set it back. If you need to use the 5.25" drive to run theprogram it's a pretty good chance that the hardware in slot 6 will not beusable from that software anyway so your loss is nothing.What are the differences between a ROM 01 and 3?1 more Meg of RAM and "One More Slot".  :)Dunno what the original post topic was, but I figured I'd mention thisstuff in case someone out there didn't know it. :)Tony                        (T_DIAZ, 12400, GO COM A2)HIGH ASCII ON THE IIGS?

However, on a few 8Mb cards (Alltech's Sirius for one) it will detectreal errors properly (But it CAN also spit out some invalid errors evenwith Alltech's board)Bottom line:BitBanger should be used on 8Mb capable cards ONLY at the users own solerisk.

Lady Technophobe followed protocol,shut down the system and turned off the external hard drive enclosure.However, she didn't notice that the modem was not plugged into the AEConserver and was still on.We had a lightning strike nearby _just_ as the phone rang!  I was in bed atthe time, and when I got up to call the cable company about no service, Ifound that the phone didn't work either.  I started going around checkingthe various devices, and finally thought to unplug the modem from the walljack.  Voila!  Phone service restored!  I took a closer look at the modem,(power switch on, no lights) and noticed that the grill openings over thespeaker looked a little black.  I opened it up, and the case was full ofcarbon.  Among other things, the internal wires connecting the wall jacksocket to the circuit board were blown apart - It appears that some of themetal spattered into the laminations of the transformer almost half andinch away.  The case of a disc capacitor or MOV right next to the socket ispartially melted. It looks as though several of the surface-mountcomponents are either half- or completely blown off the board.I dug out an older modem, connected it up, but couldn't get a dial out.  Ipulled the cable to the wall and looked at it.  It is semi-transparent. Atvarious places along its 6-foot length, the wire(s) inside are blackened,and the end that was plugged into the wall jack has the insulation blownout on one side.At least the Sportster understood my priorities and sacrificed itself forthe greater good... - Don (IronTooth)Delivered by my ANSITerm off-line reader scripts...                         They're OLRight!                       (DZAHNISER, 12949, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I don't know about USR products, but this problem is generally a"""""   caused by a fuseable link, a small package.

There may well be afusible link that was supposed to protect the modem (in fact I think foundone next to where the wall wart connects in), but the zap came in thru thephone wire, not the power side.  I just took another look, and found thefollowing: o Right next to the socket for the phone jack connection, one of thesurface-mount components is blown half-off the board.  It is 'saluting' at90 degrees from its normal position.  It is still soldered to the pad - thepad got blown off the board. The component next to it is blown half away. o Following the circuit board trace from where the phone jack was supposedto connect (the wire from the socket to the board is blown away), is a padwhere _something_ vaporized away.  Since this is on the reverse side andright next to where the above component is blown off, I suspect that thiswas a plated-through hole.  There is vapor-deposited metal on the caseunderneath this spot. o At the same spot, the bottom of the board has delaminated and bubbled.There's another spot about a half-inch away that is similarly degraded.Several of the solder pads on the bottom of the board with traces leadingto these areas are also delaminated. Inside these bubbles are pockets ofblack gunk. o Next to the speaker, almost an inch and a half from the above sites, iswhere another component is completely missing (well, not entirely - some ofthe metal is vapor-deposited onto the case above where it departed). Sinceit is labelled as 'L13', I would guess it had been an inductor. o Nearby there is an IC (can't read the numbers, even after rubbing offthe carbon deposits) that appears to have spat metal from where the leadscome out of the body of the encapsulating material.  Some of the metal ison the laminations of the transformer (opposite corner to what I mentionedin a previous note).Uhhh...

It will take place from July 22 - July 26, 1998.The cost of attending KFest '98 is only $365, which -includes- the use of adouble room in the Avila College dorms -and- meals!  There are also alimited number of single rooms available for $465.  (If you wish to stay atone of the many hotels or motels near the college then the cost is $265,but you would, of course, have to find and pay for your own room andmeals.)Tentative speakers for this year include Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd(Wolfenstein 3D for the Apple IIgs), Nathan Mates (Twilight II 2.0), TonyDiaz (Alltech Electronics), Ewen Wannop (Spectrum), Geoff Weiss (SpectrumInternet Suite), and Joe Kohn (Shareware Solutions II).This year, we are running a number of contests, including the Roger Wagnertie contest, a Door Sign contest, and, for all of you programmers, we arealso planning our first Hack Contest!  Rules are still pending, but staytuned for details.Check-in will be on Wednesday from 1-4 pm, and check-out from 11 am - 1 pmon Sunday. Computer sessions will be conducted on Thursday and Friday. Avendor fair and software and hardware demos are scheduled for Saturday.To get KFest info by email, subscribe to the KansasFest Information MailingList.  Send email to majordomo@trenco.gno.org.

To me that means doingthe conversions from mnemonics to hex yourself using a chart and enteringthe hex values of the program.If I were doing assembly for the 8 bits, I'd use an assembler. Your Orca/M8 bit assembler would be a good choice, if you still sell it. There is alsoMerlin, the Ninja Force Assembler, the assembler from Nibble magazine andthe monitor mini-assembler.Way back before the enhanced IIe, I even started to write my own assemblerin Applesoft. It actually worked, I just never added the ability to dolabels, equates and stuff. It worked pretty much like the mini-assembler.Jeff Blakeneygetting nostalgic yet again                       (JBLAKENEY, 1707, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I said what thought I meant to say, but I understand where the"""""   confusion comes from. :) To me, what you describe is machinelanguage programming. I always got a chuckle out of the back of games,proudly proclaiming that they were written in machine language--highlydoubtful!I said hand-coded assembly as opposed to, say, machine generatedassembly--a possibility with some of the Apple II compilers, includingAztec C and our Small C. I was thinking about them, which is why I made adistinction I would not normally have made.As a bit of history, part of the very first version of ORCA/M was writtenin machine code. The assembler I used couldn't assemble the first versionof ORCA/M in one piece. It ended up being 3 pieces. Two were assembled bythe assembler at different RAM locations (it couldn't do them both atonce), and one small piece was literally machine language, entered by hand(the assembler couldn't assemble anything outside the RAM used by the twochunks already created). The pieces were put together into the final binaryfile; I forget what I used to do that. From that first version on, ORCA/Mwas written in ORCA/M. :)That first version ran under DOS 3.2. It was never released.Mike Westerfield                       (BYTEWORKS, 1708, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Actually Jeff, back in the dim dark days of the late 70s early 80s,"""""   it was fairly common to write code by entering hex codes into themonitor. I know of folks out here who wrote games (hires animation etc.)that way.There was a time when I knew most of the codes off the top of my head, asI'm sure many of the folks in A2PRO used to as well. Most of the '816 onesfollow the same patterns, so its fairly easy to remember a large chunk,probably 40-50 for me at the moment,  which is way down... Oh well...Regards, Richard                       (RICHARD_B, 1709, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Yeah. This is what I did with the very first assembly program I"""""   wrote. To figure the hex codes needed, I disassembled Applesoftlooking for the instruction value. Soon after, I got an assembler and abook to properly learn assembly.Geoff                        (SISGEOFF, 1713, GO COM A2)>>>>>>   ORCA/C and Integer Basic were written in ORCA/Pascal, but what was""""""   ORCA/Pascal *originally* written in?ORCA/Pascal started life as the P4 compiler, a freeware compiler originallywritten by Niklaus Wirth, et. al. He's the guy who designed the language.I typed the P4 compiler in from a book on an IBM PC, compiling it withMicrosoft Pascal. This is back in the days when the 8086 was the top of theline CPU for DOS, and Windows hadn't even been thought about. This compilergenerated a binary file consisting of p-code; I wrote a p-code interpreterin 8086 assembly. Eventually I got things debugged well enough for thecompiler to compile itself. I then moved the binary p-code file for thecompiler and the source to an Apple //e and wrote a new p-code interpreterfor the 6502.After a _lot_ of work, pretty much a complete rewrite, I converted thiscompiler from rather humble beginnings (4000 lines, nothing like ISOstandard Pascal) to something that would handle ISO Pascal (10,000+ lines).By that time, the Apple IIGS was available and it was running under APW. Asthe last kinks were worked out in the ISO standard, I implemented the firstnative code generator.It took a lot of refining, and some parts of the file I/O system andscanner were rewritten in assembly, but this is what eventually becameORCA/Pascal 1.0.Mike Westerfield                       (BYTEWORKS, 1734, GO COM A2)APPLEWORKS FILE FORMATS?

The Accidental Tourist guides weredesigned for the business traveller whose reactions to travel were feelingsof anxiety and defenseless.  The guides were meant to soothe and comfortthe non-adventurous traveller.     If you've never been to KansasFest before, you should find that thisguide will do the same for you.  If you're an old hand at KansasFest, thisguide will provide you with some helpful reminders.

These folks know the score.     KansasFest began in 1989 as the A2-Central Developer Conference, anddidn't begin calling itself KansasFest until its third year, 1991.KansasFest takes place in Kansas City, Missouri.  (Not Kansas City, Kansas.The Kansas border is less than a mile away, if that comforts you any.)     This will be the tenth annual KansasFest, and it's not just forprogrammers and developers any more.

It's a great chance to learnabout your Apple II, mingle with other users, and see what software otherpeople are working on.  This is the Apple II event of the year.  I can'tsay exactly how many people will there, but a safe estimate is 50-100attendees (counting those who stay off-campus).     What campus?  KansasFest takes place entirely at Avila College, in thesouthmost part of Kansas City.  Here's the address:          Avila College          11901 Wornall Road          Kansas City, Missouri  64145  U.S.A.          phone (816) 942-8400     Avila College is small--approximately 1500 students--which means youcan walk anywhere on campus in five minutes.  Use of a car is therefore asoptional as it's ever going to get, assuming you fly to Kansas.  The onetime you are going to be hollering for a vehicle is when you try to get toand from Kansas City International airport.  More on that shortly.     This year, KansasFest is scheduled for July 23-July 26, but dorm roomsare available for the nights of July 22-July 25.          PM   Wed July 22    arrival               Thu July 23    scheduled sessions               Fri July 24    scheduled sessions               Sat July 25    demos (morning); vendors' fair (afternoon)          AM   Sun July 26    farewell     Check-in time is 1-4 PM Wednesday.  Check-out time is 11 AM-1 PMSunday.     How much the conference costs depends on when you pay for it and whatkind of accommodation you require.  You can save a few bucks if you'rewilling to share a room--private rooms cost more.  (The prices went up by$100 on April 16.)          private room        $465          shared room         $365          conference only     $315     Even if you can find a room in Kansas City for $12.50 a night ($37.50a night private), staying on campus is still a better idea, sinceafter-hours activities are a big part of KansasFest.     Some notes on meals: free lunch at Avila's cafeteria used to beincluded for _all_ KFesters, even those not staying on campus.  This year,like last year, those not staying on campus must provide their own lunches.Fortunately, being banished from the Avila cafeteria ought not make anyoneweep.     Also, those staying on campus should note that no evening meal isprovided on Wednesday night nor on Saturday night.  The lack of a Wednesdaymeal isn't significant--that's still before the kick-off, so to speak.  Butkeep in mind that you're on your own your last night there.  (You can get abreakfast on Sunday, though, if you're staying on campus.)  Traditionally,large groups of KFesters gather at K.C. Masterpiece on Wednesday night andJess & Jim's Steakhouse on Saturday night to satisfy their appetites.     You will be staying in Ridgway dormitory, which was built in 1963.For those of you who have never experienced dorm life or have forgottenwhat it was like, expect spartan surroundings.  Forget the idea of aprivate bathroom, but you'll be glad to know that the rooms areair-conditioned.BEFORE YOU GO   As with any trip, you need to arrange for several things:"""""""""""""     o  conference attendance;     o  accommodation (included in package);     o  meals (included in package);     o  transport to/from conference.     Those attending from outside the United States will also need:     o  passport/visa;     o  medical insurance;     o  US currency/traveller's checks.Conference Attendance   There are 80 spaces for on-campus attendees, and'''''''''''''''''''''   the last day pre-registration is available is July11.  Even if you register late, there may be room for off-campus conferenceattendees, so you may be able to register at Avila on July 22/23.     You can get more KansasFest information by checking out the KFest HomePage at http://www.primenet.com/~adams/kfest.html.

Space is limited to 80 beds this year, so you're unlikely to endup in a room by yourself unless you specifically request a private room(which costs more).  The rooms are _not_ co-ed (aside from the occasionalmarried couple), but the dorms are.     There aren't any hotels within walking distance of Avila College, soplan on having transportation if you're staying off-campus.     Here are some hotels said to be near Avila College.  Please be warnedthat I haven't stayed at any of them, so I can't make recommendations.Most have approximate room rates shown; some do not.  In one case, I wasnot able to find updated figures for this year or for 1997--this one ismarked *(1996 rate)*.  Its rates are almost certainly $5-$30 higher thisyear.          Fairfield Inn - Overland Park          4401 W. 107th, Overland Park, KS 66207          913-381-5700          $64          (closest hotel to KansasFest)          DoubleTree Hotel Kansas City Corporate Woods          10100 College Boulevard, Overland Park, KS 66210          800-222-TREE / 913-451-6100          $139-$159          Overland Park Marriott          10800 Metcalf, Overland Park, KS 66210          800-228-9290 / 913-451-8000          $72-$159          AmeriSuites          6801 W. 112th, Overland Park, KS 66211          800-833-1516 / 913-451-2553          $94-$107          Red Roof Inn - Overland Park          6800 W. 108th St., Overland Park, KS 66211          913-341-0100          $43-50 *(1996 rate)*          Residence Inn by Marriott - Overland Park          6300 W. 110th Street, Overland Park, KS 66211          800-331-3131 / 913-491-3333          $79-$119          Clubhouse Inn Overland Park          10610 Marty, Overland Park, KS 66212          800-CLUBINN / 913-648-5555          $75-$95          Courtyard by Marriott          11301 Metcalf, Overland Park, KS 66212          913-339-9900          $114-$124          Embassy Suites Overland Park          10601 Metcalf, Overland Park, KS 66212          800-362-2779 / 913-649-7060          $109-$159          (charges for local calls)          Hampton Inn - Overland Park          10591 Metcalf Frontage Road, Overland Park, KS 66212          800-HAMPTON / 913-341-1551          $72-$82          Holiday Inn Express - Overland Park          7200 W. 107th St, Overland Park, KS 66212          800-HOLIDAY / 913-648-7858          $74-$82          Courtyard by Marriott South          500 E. 105th St., Kansas City, MO  64131          816-941-3333          $99Meals   If you're staying on Avila campus, breakfast and the evening meal'''''   are included in the package price.  If you aren't staying at Avila,you're completely on your own.     If you find the cafeteria food not to your liking--and manydon't--you'll be relieved to know that there's a supermarket about 25minutes' walk away.  Here's how to get there:     Start at Carondelet dorm.  Stand with your back to the dorm entrance,so that you can see the Marian Center if you look left.  Turn right fromCarondelet and walk down to the parking lot.  Turn left and walk out of theparking lot, down Sister Oliver Louise Drive.  This private road takes youto 118th Street.  Turn left and walk on 118th until you reach Wornall Road.Turn right on Wornall until you reach the intersection of Wornall andMinor.  Turn right onto Minor Drive.     Once on Minor, ten minutes' walk will bring you close to the end ofMinor, to the point where you can see a large parking lot.  Veer left andyou'll be at a small shopping mall that boasts a bank, a supermarket, and arestaurant.  (Note:  This trip can be made a few minutes shorter, but thesedirections are simpler, and can be easily adapted for use by motorists aswell as pedestrians.)     If you're not staying on Avila campus, you're probably sufficientlyadventurous to know how to find decent food in a strange city.  Be awarethat small groups tend to sneak off-campus to a restaurant (often either KCMasterpiece or Jess & Jim's) for at least one evening meal during theconference.  Let them know you want to be part of the excursion!Transportation 101/A--Getting to Kansas   Many of you intend to fly to'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Kansas City.  The airport youwill be arriving at is Kansas City International (MCI).  The airport hasthree arc-shaped terminals.  If you're meeting someone there, be sure thateveryone intends to go to the same terminal, or that everyone is catchingthe (free) shuttle to the same car rental agency.     You can pick up a city map at one of the airport magazine stands.  TheGousha map has Avila College marked (grid location I-19).  If you don'thave a map, better pay close attention:     If you drew a map of Kansas City on a 8x11 sheet of paper, the airportwould be in the upper left corner, to the northwest.  Avila College wouldbe near the bottom of the piece of paper, near the center.  Point taken?     The distance between Avila College and the international airport isnot small.  It's perhaps 45 miles by the recommended route (below), soallow an hour's travel time at a bare minimum.  What with collecting yourluggage and arranging/co-ordinating transport, it's probably safer toassume it will take you two hours to get from the airport to Avila,starting from the time the plane's landing gear touches the tarmac andstopping when you sling your suitcase onto the dorm bed.     If you need more information on the Kansas City International Airport,you can check out their World Wide Web page: http://www.kcairports.org.Transportation 101/B--Getting to Avila   Since the distance from the''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   airport to Avila College is 28miles as the crow flies, and about 45 miles by car, you don't even want tothink about taking a taxi.  You'd pay $33 minimum, possibly as much as $60.For a one-way trip.     If you book ahead, you can get one of the airport transportationservices to take you to Avila College at a more reasonable rate.  In thepast, I've recommended Quicksilver, but they seem to have eitherdisappeared or changed their phone number since 1997.  Some people withinthe United States have been able to get through to them, but not me.  Sothis year I'm afraid your a bit more on your own than I'd like to leaveyou.     Here are some 800 numbers for limousine services.  I HAVEN'T TRIED ANYOF THEM.  (You have no idea how much it hurts to have to say that.)  Idon't know how much any of them charge--they may even be more expensivethan taxis.     A Elegant Int'l Limo     1-800-940-6482     BLS Limousine Service    1-800-843-5752     Dav El Limousines        1-800-922-0343     Diamond                  1-800-618-8630If you want to try Quicksilver, despite my being unable to reach them attheir old number, here it is:     Quicksilver              1-816-262-0905     Usually, you _must_ book these limo services in advance; theygenerally need at least one's day's notice.  IF YOU DON'T MAKE ARESERVATION, THEY CAN'T TAKE YOU.  Don't think you can call them once youarrive at the airport--you can't.     (If you want to research possible other numbers, try pointing your webbrowser to http://www.kcairports.org/kci/limos.htm but be warned that thispage is probably out of date, since it lists the old number forQuicksilver.  You could also try http://www.thetrip.com/ride/MCI/ but againbe warned that I can't vouch for anything listed there.  Sorry, folks.)     If you don't want to rent a car, you could also take the AirportExpress van to the Overland Park Marriott hotel and take a cab from there.     (Those of you renting cars at the airport:  we'll discuss the routeshortly, in the ARRIVAL section.)PREPARING FOR THE TRIP   Get plenty of sleep before you go, because you're""""""""""""""""""""""   not likely to get much sleep at KansasFest.KansasFest days are 18 hours long, unless they're 20 or 24 hours long.There's too much going on to waste time in sleep!     On the same note, make sure you don't schedule anything important(like operating heavy machinery) for the day after KansasFest--Monday, July27.  You'll have had so little sleep that you won't feel your best.Packing--Computer Stuff   Lots of people brings computers.  If you're doing'''''''''''''''''''''''   this, make a backup of your hard drive and leavethe backup at home.  If you won't feel safe unless you take a backup withyou, make two backups.     If you're bringing a hard drive and you're travelling by plane, youmay want to consider packing the hard drive in your carry-on luggage.  Thatway, you can extract the hard drive from the luggage before it gets X-rayed(!).  Tell the attendant that what you are carrying in your hand is a harddrive for a computer, and that it might be damaged by the X-ray machine.Chances are they'll handle it differently.  If they tell you that no damagecould possibly be caused, don't believe them.  (You may have to obey them,but don't believe them.)  Try insisting--politely!--on special handlinganyway.  Incidentally, X-rays are not good for diskettes either.     Bring plenty of extension cords, power bars, and surge suppressors,plus phone cord if you bring your modem.  Bring plenty of blank disks.Bring anything you'd like to show off, either software or hardware.Packing--Other Stuff   A word about clothing:  KansasFest is "dress''''''''''''''''''''   casual", and Kansas City in July is hot and humid,so light clothing would be a good idea.  If you're bringing anything thatyou want to hang in the closet, bring your own hangers.     You should pack a bathrobe or something you don't mind walking thehalls in when you rise in the morning.  The dorms will be housing bothsexes, and there are no private bathrooms.     Towels are supplied, but you can pack an extra one if you feel soinclined.  Be sure to bring all the usual toiletries:  soap, shampoo,toothbrush, and all the etceteras.     There are modular phone jacks in all the dorm rooms, but phones arenot provided, so pack a phone, if only for local calls (which are free).If you know who your roommate is, you can assure her or him that you'rebringing the phone and save her or him the trouble.     If you're serious about making the morning sessions, an alarm clock isa good idea.  If you're _really_ serious about attending morning sessions,ear plugs--for the night before--couldn't hurt either. <grin>     Unless you're a private soul, some sort of sign for your door is agood idea, so that people can find you.  Many people take the trouble tomake these before they leave.  In fact, rumor has it that there could be a"door sign contest" this year!     Don't forget your airline tickets and other travel documents, if any,but don't pack them in your checked luggage.  Also don't forget a quarterfor a phone call.ARRIVING""""""""Getting from the Airport to Avila   If you've arranged with an'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   airport transportation service to pickyou up at the airport, as you leave the "gate", look for someone holding upa sign with your name on it.  (The sign will probably also have the name ofthe service written on it.)     Of course, these "airport limos" have been known to get busy atKansasFest time.  If no one is there looking for you, start by looking forthem.  Their people are usually easy to spot.  If there's no one from theairport transportation service in the terminal, don't panic.  Just callthem--it'll be a local call from the airport.  (You did remember a quarterfor a phone call, didn't you?)     Remember that you usually _cannot_ ride with an "airport limo" serviceunless you have made a reservation in advance.Driving from the Airport to Avila   If you're renting a car, start looking'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   for the desk of the rental agencyyou're dealing with.  (If you have to go to another terminal, Remember thatthere are shuttle buses among the three terminals.)     Once you've got your car, exit through the airport's main gate(Cookingham Drive) onto Interstate 29 heading south.  At highway 152, exitwest.  Follow 152 west to I-435.  Take I-435 south and follow it arounduntil it reaches Wornall Road from the west.  Take the Wornall Road exit.Then turn in at Avila College (which is a left turn off Wornall if youapproach it from I-435).  Check our handy Avila map below for where topark.  The best place is probably the lot near the dormitories.After Hours Arrival   It's Wednesday night, and it's dark already.'''''''''''''''''''   Quicksilver has just dropped you off... or you'vejust parked the rental car.  You're tired after the long drive from theairport.  You've never been to Avila College before.  Now what do you do?     Well, if you know beforehand that you're going to arrive after hours,you should contact Cindy Adams so that she can let the Avila staff knowabout late arrivals.  Suppose, however, that you've arrived late byaccident--your flights was delayed, or your car had a flat?  What do you donow?     It's easy.  The campus at Avila is small, and there are only threebuilding that KFesters need to explore:     I.  Whitfield Conference Center:  This is where most of the actualconference sessions take place.  It's sufficiently small that you'd have totry really hard to get lost here.  If you walk the path to Whitfield fromone of the other buildings listed below, go down the stairs as soon as youget inside the door.  If you enter Whitfield from the roadway, you're atthe main conference entrance, so don't worry.     II.  Marian Center:  This is where the cafeteria is.  Unless you'rebooked into a nearby hotel, this is where you come to eat.  This is alsowhere the celebrity roast is traditionally held.  Yes, you're allowed toattend the roast even if you're staying at a hotel.     III.  Ridgway Dormitory:  This is where you sleep, at least in theory.Even hotel-dwellers need to know about the dorms, since you'll spend a lotof your evenings hanging out here.     Look at the map of the campus below and get your bearings:                           AVILA COLLEGE CAMPUS              *                        ___________           *             *          ##########    |           |           *            *           ##########  ...           |            *           *            ##########  . |___________|             *          *                         .      .           ########***         *                 ______   .      .........   ########   *        *                 |      |  .           ___.____           *       *                  |      |  .          |        |           *      *                   |______|  .          | Marian |            *     *                              .          | center |             *    *       ______                  .          |________|              *****       |      |                 .              .                    *    *      |      |                 .              ..............        *     *     |      |                 .              .        ____._____  ##      *    |______| ................................       |          | ##       *            .         _____            .           |Carondelet| ##        *   ________.__      |     |           .           |   dorm   | ##  ___   *  |           |     |     |           .           |__________| ## |   |  * [| Whitfield |     |     |       ____._____                   ## |   | #*#[|  center   |     |_____|      |          |    ################ |   | #*# |___________|                  | Ridgway  |    ################ |___| #*#                                |   dorm   |    ################       #*#                                |__________|        *        *                               ... = pathway                               *** = roadway                               ### = parking                         [ = main entrance (Whitfield)     If it's late Wednesday night, forget about registering for the_conference_.  Check-in ended at 4 PM.  Concentrate on registering for your_room_, so at least you'll have a place to sleep tonight.     If it's extremely late at night, the front doors of the dorms may beshut.  Look for a buzzer that will rouse a member of the staff.     The best thing to do is to read the instructions in your preliminaryinformation packet, but if they don't produce satisfactory results, wanderabout one or both of the dorms until you find someone who'll take pity onyour and let you collapse onto a bed.  You'll get a room assignment and aroom key.  (You may even get a sheet of paper that tells you who you'vebeen billeted with and how to register for the conference on the followingmorning.)  However, don't collapse the minute you see your room key.  Thelowest number it will have on it is 401.  That does _not_ mean you're onthe fourth floor.  (Particularly as Ridgway has only three floors.)  Ifyour room number begins with 4, it means you're on the first floor (or"ground floor" to most Europeans).  Similar deal for the second and thirdfloors.  If your room number doesn't begin with 4, 5, or 6, it means youaren't staying at Ridgway.     If wandering around the dorms doesn't produce any results, try MarianCenter.  If you still can't find anyone, wander down toward Whitfield.     Arriving after hours means you get to check in to your room.  Youstill must register for the conference in the morning.  We'll cover that inthe "Business Hours Arrival" section.  For now, what about your room?Your Room   Rooms at the Avila College dorms each have two beds.  If your'''''''''   roommate is there, smile and introduce yourself.  If yourroommate isn't there, don't be alarmed.  Your roommate may not have arrivedyet, in which case you get to grab the best bed.  (I'm joking.  Neither bedwill be any less loathsome than the other.)  Probably your roommate hasalready arrived, grabbed the best bed, and is out visiting others.     Near the beds is a long institutional-looking unit with two closets,two sets of drawers, and assorted storage space.  The opposite side of thisunit is a desk long enough for two people to work at.  There's plenty ofroom for two computers on this desk, but there's just one outlet percomputer.  If you don't have a power bar or a Kensington System Saver or anAE Conserver, you're going to be limited to plugging in the computer andthe monitor--no hard drive, no modem, nothing else.  (Those of you withinternal hard drives can stop being smug right now.)     Near the desk are two outlets that seem to be phone jacks.  They_aren't_ phone jacks--they're Ethernet ports.  The phone jack is on theother side of the room, by the beds.  If you didn't bring plenty of phoneextension cord, you'll have to set up your computer at the foot of yourbed.  (Don't laugh.  It's happened.)  Don't waste time looking for thephone; they aren't supplied, which is why you had to bring one in yoursuitcase.  To find out the phone number of your room (so that people cancall you), ask one of the Avila staff.  If you didn't bring a phone, youcan still use one of the pay phones in the hallways.     When dialing out from your dorm room, either with a phone or a modem,you'll need to prefix the number with a 9 to get an outside line.  Ifyou're using a modem, you may be able to use its "wait for dialtone"feature before you dial the number.  So the proper sequence would be:          ATDT9w4741778     If your modem doesn't support "wait for dialtone", try using a fewcommas (,) to create a pause:          ATDT9,,4725178     You may also need to set your software up so it waits about 45 secondsfor a connect instead of the standard 30 seconds, because it takes a bitlonger to get through to the number you're dialing.     (There's information about dialing Delphi later in this article.)     The only real luxury that the rooms boast is air-conditioning.  Noprivate baths here, but you'll find bathrooms just down the corridor apiece.  The one I frequented had one bathtub, two showers, three toilets,four sinks (one with an attachment for washing hair), and assorted mirrors.Every floor also seems to have a TV lounge and a small kitchen.Business Hours Arrival   If you arrive at Avila between 9 AM and 5 PM''''''''''''''''''''''   (preferably between 1 PM and 4 PM Wednesday!), youcan register for the conference and your room (if applicable) at the sametime.  Check your pre-conference packet for information on where toregister.  It will be somewhere in one of the four buildings mentionedabove, of course.     One note of warning:  if you've been told to register somewhere--say,the cafeteria at Marian center--and no one has shown up fifteen minutesafter the listed start time, then by all means check the dorms andWhitfield center to see if registration has been moved there.  It'sunlikely you'll have to worry about something like this, but it doesn'thurt to be prepared.ONCE YOU'RE THERE"""""""""""""""""Curricular Events   Originally, KansasFest was a conference for Apple II'''''''''''''''''   developers--people who wanted to create software andhardware for others to use.  Nowadays it's for users, too.  Don't worrythat you don't belong there--you do and you're welcome, whether you've cometo party or come to learn.     The sessions--no one dignifies them with the name "seminars"--aremostly held at the Whitfield conference center.  The main conference roomis right inside the main doors (the doors closest to Wornall Road).  If youdon't know how to get to the session you want to attend, come here.  Itwill either be in this room or someone in this room will know where theright room is.     There's a social aspect to this part of the occasion as well.  You'llsee plenty of schmoozing in Whitfield lobby, right outside the mainconference room.  Expect cameras, both still and video, and demented peopleoperating them.  Cameras are used to record the presentations, or peoplemeeting, or the general craziness that's going on!     "Formal" sessions have been known to take place in the dorms as well._Informal_ sessions have definitely been known to take place in the dorms!     On the Saturday of KansasFest, there's a demonstration of new andupcoming products and a vendors' fair.  The fair is a chance to pick uphardware and software at special KFest prices, and to see and buy softwarenever before released.Semi-curricular Events   While not officially part of the proceedings, some''''''''''''''''''''''   products _may_ be released at KansasFest.  (Isometimes think Apple II programmers would never ever ship if it weren'tfor KansasFest and Christmas.)  This year, there still haven't been anyannouncements, so you'll have to attend to find out what's up-and-coming.     Even if nothing gets released, you're practically guaranteed someproduct previews.  Here are my wild guesses at what _might_ be shown thisyear:     o  Several people who do not want to be named are rumored to be        working on Ethernet cards for the Apple II.  Perhaps we'll be able        to stop drooling over Tony Diaz's Apple-prototype Ethernet Cards        and actually get a chance to buy some this year.     o  Richard Bennett hasn't yet delivered his updated version of        Marinetti with PPP for the Apple IIgs--he might just unveil it at        KansasFest.     o  Mike Westerfield has been working on a programming language for the        Apple IIGS tentatively called GSoft BASIC.  Mike Westerfield has        also been working on a spelling-checker, though it's been a long        time since anyone bugged him about it.     o  Geoff Weiss has been working on a File Transfer Protocol (ftp)        client for Marinetti using IIgs users.     Who knows what else?  _I_ sure don't!Extra-curricular Events   It is perfectly possible to attend KansasFest,'''''''''''''''''''''''   attend the sessions 9-5, and go back home.  Butwhy would you want to?     One reason you might want to is that you're shy.  You're shy at anygathering, but you can't imagine conversing with Tony Ward, Joe Kohn, MaxJones, Tony Diaz, Geoff Weiss, or Ewen Wannop!  There's no reason to beshy.  Do what Dean Esmay did at his first KansasFest:  walk aroundintroducing yourself.  To everyone.  You'll meet lots of people just asawestruck as you are, and you can swap tips, stories, recommendations, andlies.  Don't be intimidated by meeting well-known Apple II figures.  Heck,we're all "just folks".     Don't let yourself leave KansasFest without having mingled.  Wanderaround the dorms.  If there's one person sitting at a computer, just say"hi".  You're intelligent enough to know how to figure out if the person ishard at work or at home to callers.  If there are a bunch of people--whichis far more likely, particularly during the evening--you might be shy aboutjoining the group.  Don't be.  Just announce your presence ("Hi, everybody!Room for one more?").  You'll be surprised how welcome the group will makeyou feel.  Whatever the group is doing, it's probably in "kibitz mode", sojoin in!     What will the group be doing?  Hard to say.  They might be:     o  trying out software that hasn't been released yet;     o  trying to get a piece of software to crash;     o  trying to get it to stop crashing (i.e. debugging it);     o  sending a group message to Delphi or Genie;     o  playing a game;     o  fixing hardware;     o  reminiscing about previous KansasFests; or     o  telling stories about the heyday of the Apple II.     There's a chance that the group will be "multi-tasking"--that is,doing more than one of these things at the same time.     There are other extra-curricular events that have almost become KFesttraditions:  Nerf(TM) warfare and a game called Bite the Bag, whichinvolves a paper bag and a sense of balance.  But what about the "real"traditions?Tradition I:  Celebrity Roast   If the term "celebrity roast" is new to'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   you, rest assured that it's not dangerous,not even to the celebrity.  Open flame is not involved, exceptmetaphorically.  A roast is simply an event where members of a panel giveshort speeches which "honor" the celebrity guest by dishing outgood-natured insults and back-handed compliments:  "A lot of people don'tknow that Tony Diaz has a poor sense of timing.  He counts two months asthe amount of time between issues of _Shareware Solutions II_."  (Exceptthat most of the jokes will be funnier than that.)  Ideally, the personbeing "roasted" is the keynote speaker from the previous KFest, but thisisn't always possible.  This year, the celebrity being roasted is indeedTony Diaz of Alltech Electronics in Southern California, known for having ahuge collection of exotic Apple II hardware and software and a love forflying and old cars.     This event is catered and held in the Avila cafeteria in the Mariancenter.  It's open to all KansasFest attendees, not just those staying oncampus.Tradition II:  Calling Delphi   The link between KansasFest and Delphi is a'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   relatively new one, but as people alwaysmanaged to find time to post early reports on Genie in years past, peoplealso will find time to do th same on Delphi.  CompuServe andcomp.sys.apple2 often get the news early, too.  But Delphi is the servicewith the hottest connection to KansasFest.     Here are the SprintNet numbers, through which you can access bothGenie and Delphi:            300/ 1200       816-221-9900           2400             816-472-1430           9600/14400       816-421-5783     To sign on to Delphi using SprintNet:          1.  Dial the local SprintNet number.          2.  Wait to be connected.               o  If your modem is 300 or 1200 baud, press Return, then                  press D, then Return again.               o  If your modem is 2400 baud or faster, type @D, then press                  Return.          3.  When TERMINAL= appears, press Return.          4.  Wait for @ to appear, then type C DELPHI and press Return.     Don't worry about long-distance charges within the city.  The greatermetropolitan area of Kansas City is in two states with two area codes (816for Missouri and 913 for Kansas).  However, nearly all calls within theKansas City metropolitan area are local.     Remember that you need to prefix the number with a 9 (to get anoutside line) and either a "wait for dialtone" command (w) or "pause"command (,) before you dial the number.          ATDT9w472-5178 or ATDT9,,472-5178Tradition III:  Dining Out   It's traditional at KFest to take at least one""""""""""""""""""""""""""   meal at one of two restaurants (or both!)--KCMasterpiece and Jess & Jim's.     If you hang out in the dorm rooms, you're bound to hear of groupsheading off to "dine posh".  Ask to be counted in... and tell me whathappens, all the gory details.  The thought of breaking bread with some ofthese people intrigues me.A TYPICAL DAY   A KansasFest day doesn't begin when you might it expect it"""""""""""""   to.  It begins right after supper.  The pressing questionof something to eat over with, you take the aperitif of your choice--Jolt!cola, Dr Pepper, or Mountain Dew--and wander around the dorms to see who'sdoing what.  Some people will be staying up until _very_ late.  The reasonfor this is that program bugs stay hidden until at least 2 AM, and thereally obscure ones wait until 5 AM.     When morning comes, you may or may not have gotten any sleep.  If youhave, chances are that you didn't get much of it.  The cafeteria staff stopserving breakfast at 8:30, but you may decide that sleep is more importantthan food.  In fact, you may decide that sleep is more important than beingat the first session.  Or the first two sessions.  Or world peace.     Eventually you get out of bed and dither over which of thesimultaneous sessions you want to attend.  You can bring paper or acomputer to take notes, if you wish--no one will laugh or point.  No onewill frown if you don't take notes, either.     All sessions will run over their allotted time.  This is an immutablerule.  The domino theory rapidly comes into play here, which wreaks merryhavoc with the schedule.     After the morning sessions, there's an hour to get some lunch at thecafeteria at Marian center.  No one takes attendance here, either.     During lunch, the stragglers begin to arrive, and afternoon sessionsmay be more generously attended and received, since pretty much everyone isnow awake and reasonably certain that life is worth living.  The afternoonsessions will officially end at 5:00 or 5:30, but they may last a whilelonger, since no one else is waiting to use the room.  It's possible to getso involved in the final session for the day that you miss the evening mealat the cafeteria.     Or perhaps you've decided to give the cafeteria a miss.  Someone mightbe headed to a restaurant for a meal--ask around.  After you've eaten,well... the cycle begins all over.LEAVING   Avila College hosts events other than KansasFest--in fact,"""""""   Avila's summers are tightly booked.  In previous years, bothRidgway and Carondelet dorms have been available to KFesters, but in recentyeas the organizing committee could only get one.  That should give yousome idea of how hectic things are.     Because Avila is playing host to others after KansasFest is over, besure to check out on time.  This year, you have the option of staying overon Saturday night and checking out on Sunday, but don't push it.  Check-outtime is 11 AM-1 PM Sunday.  Avila wants you out of there by 1 PM on Sundayat the _latest_!     Incidentally, if you're travelling with Quicksilver, don't forget thatyou must have booked your return trip to the airport at least 24 hours inadvance.  Since most people leave at much the same time, it may be possibleto cadge a lift to the airport if you've made friends with someone headingthat way.     This is far from the end.  In fact, it's not even the beginning.  Ifyou've been reading this, it's undoubtedly to prepare for KansasFest, whichmeans it's all still to come!  So have a great time at KansasFest--and ifyou spot the man who began it all, Tom Weishaar (a/k/a "Uncle DOS"), givehim my warmest regards.[EOA][FRE]------------------------------                FREEWARE FAVORITES |-----------------------------------IR 2.0.2""""""""by Ryan M.

The shoulder strap on yourcarry-on bag, for instance.  In the world of computers, it's that extramemory and hard drive in your Apple II.  And in the world of the Apple IIgsSystem Software, it's Init Restarter, aka IR.     IR (say "ear") is a Permanent Initialization File (a PIF) that goesinto the System.Setup folder in the System Folder of your bootup drive.  Itadds a very simple capability, which is mostly used in Finder: the abilityto start inactive Desk Accessories, Drivers, Inits, and Finder Extensionsthat aren't active at the time the system is booted.  The capabilities ofIR can be extended to other GS/OS desktop programs when used in combinationwith IRNDA.     IR has a preference menu in the Extras pull down menu in Finder, whichallows you tell it whether or not to install NDAs instantly and open themif possible; install FExts permanently; give other applications first shotat files that are double clicked; tell the user about problems itencounters trying to start up an extension; and how to handle starting afile that's already started.     When trying to eliminate extension conflicts (likely a famillaractivity for the telecomm addicts among you), IR is a Godsend.  UsingShiftyList 2, I have a number of different sets of extensions I can chooseto load at boot time.  If I want to absolutely eliminate all possibilitiesof conflicts but give myself the ability to add things on as I go, I simplychoose the one that only contains IR.     There is one definite quirk with unshrinking the IR archive.  Thefolders included in the archive have some non-ProDOS legal names(apparently, the original lived on an HFS formatted disk).  When youunshrink this archive, if you unshrink it to a ProDOS disk, you'll need toedit the pathnames to something ProDOS-legal--a minor inconvenience.     If you only have one extension in your IIgs System Folder, this is theone you need.  And to top it off, it's free.  Thanks, Matt and Apple.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :         Forget the Joneses...
