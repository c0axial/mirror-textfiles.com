Edwards started out as another U-pick apple orchard.  Over theyears features have been added to be appealing to the whole family...making it a destination for a day trip.     You can still pick your own apples.  You can also pick your ownpumpkins.     The barn has become a store.  Here you can select from a half dozenvarieties of apples.  Items for sale include apple cider, apple ciderdonuts, apple butter, jams, jellies, honey, baking mixes, soup mixes,candles, and candy.  (The Cashew Crunch is so delicious that you might eatall of it before you get back home).     The store includes a lunch area... pulled pork bar-b-q sandwiches, hotdogs, apple cider donuts, hot cider, cold cider, milk and coffee.  Thetables are old wire reels, the stools are old milk cans.     Then there are the features designed to appeal to the children.  Walkup to the yellow line near the farmhouse and visit with Rusty, the GoldenRetriever.  Feed the goats.  (A quarter will get you a handful of goat feedfrom the vending machines).  Visit with Hiss and Miss, a pair of outspokengeese.     Go for a ride in a horse drawn wagon.  In addition to the usual swingsand slides the playground includes several old tractors... climb up on theseat and pretend to drive.     When you get home... enjoy your Apples.                          The Apple II Computers                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     At home and away... enjoy your Apples.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[MHC]Mike Harvey in Syndicomm Chat"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The Apple II forum on Syndicomm Online will be hosting Mike Harvey, thefounder and editor of Nibble magazine, in its chat room on Monday, October24, at 6:00 PM Pacific Daylight Time.Please don't forget the news that Mike's just completed the scanning of the-entire- Nibble library of Apple II magazines and books either; checktoday's lead story at http://www.a2central.com/ for more!RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 2, Top 1, Msg 22)>>>>>"""""And as a reminder to our regulars, 6:00 pm PDT is an hour earlier than ourregularly scheduled mayhem...

The first day ofthe show just ended and everyone treked out to a local restaurant--musthave been 50 of us. Hans and Jeri are here, which is cool to see them.Among those I sat across the dinner table were Jason Scott, the director ofBBS: The Documentary (www.bbsdocumentary.com) and this guy who was a bigplayer in the ascii art scene. It was fascinating listening to them. Thesessions so far have been a treat. One was a preview of a new documentarycalled "The Future of Pinball" which had some superb visuals and acompelling story about the fall of pinball giant Williams. The other wasthe 30th anniversary reunion of the Homebrew Computer Club, which was wheremany of the early computer companies grew out of (including Apple). Woz wasthere along with another early Apple employee Alan Baum. Everyone toldgreat stories and the place was standing room only. Even had a big birthdaycake. Oh yeah, how could I forget, I got to play the original SpaceWar on aPDP-1, doesn't get much better than this :) All this fun and there is stillanother full day.-----The second day was just as good, with the highlight being an evening trekdeep into the Santa Cruz hills to visit Bruce Damar's Digibarn, which isliterally a computer museum inside a barn, complete with two large pigs! Hegave about 10 of us (including John Draper aka Captain Crunch of blue boxand Easy Writer fame--an early Apple II word processor) a tour. Lots ofunique Mac and Apple II items including a Lisa and Apple IIc prototype.I forgot to mention but on Saturday Bruce presented Woz with what I thinkwas the original Wonderbook, which was a bunch of the original notes anddocs on the Apple II (pre-Redbook). Woz said he had been wondering for 30years where it went(http://www.digibarn.com/collections/books/woz-wonderbook/index.html).On the Homebrew Computer Club panel from Saturday, Lee Felsenstein saidthat Woz was probably the greatest hacker to have come out of Homebrew. Iconsider that high praise, because Lee chaired the Homebrew meetings,helped start the Community Memory project and was involved with designingseveral computers such as the Osborne I and Sol.Today is Monday and I am off to visit Apple's HQ, the Weird Stuff Warehouseand then off to Boulder Creek and Big Basin Redwoods State Park.(KGAGNE, Cat 5, Top 15, Msg 9)[EOA][SAN]Spam Assassin 3.1.0"""""""""""""""""""Spam Assassin 3.1.0 was released a month ago and I set it up on a few of mymail systems.

To draw the shape is easy too, just load the fileto a buffer than copy each line to the hires screen-you can't just bload itto the screen due to the memory originization of the hires screen.I had about 245 bytes free for ML code, and it took most of that code forthe draw routine, although more than half of it is Y-table lookup tables.The hard part was locating the buffer, since most of the graphics blocksare about 700-1250 bytes long, and I only have less than 3000 of freememory-I can't reserve a fixed buffer since the free space is all locatedin the variable space, not to mention I need headroom to avoid too manygarbage collection slowdowns (even though I'm using a fast garbagecollector).So I came up with a dynamic buffer using an array.  I have routines alreadyin place to delete arrays, so I simply dimension an integer array of theright size, then bload the graphic into that memory space, then using MLuse that as the buffer to copy to the hires screen, and at the end deletethe array.  I use this technique already to load the maze maps.Since creating say an array that's 1250 bytes long with only 3000 freebytes takes AppleSoft a noticeable delay, and because most shapes are muchsmaller than this, I also came up with a way to only dimension the array tothe size needed by changing the auxtype of each file when it's originallysaved to the length of the file, and with MicroDot it's easy to load afile's auxtype, so I can dimension the array to the exact size needed.I also grabbed all the graphics I need-they all came from a GIF file Ifound that contained images of all the Wizardry images, plus some othersources.Converting GIFs to standard A2 hires images was easy too with IIGIF byJason Harper, a P8 program which was much faster & easier to use than theGS program SuperConvert.(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 185)>>>>>"""""Hi, Jeff --I dropped you an email on the subject of pixel art.

MSYS and Mingw go pretty muchhand-in-hand.  MSYS is a minimal UNIX-like shell and Mingw is a specialversion of the gcc compiler which has the headers and libraries to compileWindows API software.Part of the make process for KEGS is processing some files with PERL.  Ialso wanted more UNIX compatible utilities to perform every day tasks, suchas the use of a decent pager called more.  This is where Cygwin came in.The user's PATH environment variable within MSYS had to include thedirectory where Cygwin stored its files.By using this bastardized setup, KEGS' Windows vars file had to becustomized--it'll be obvious based on the error that shows up if you don'tmake any changes.If there is an attempt to compile in the KEGS' ethernet emulation which Iwrote, you will also need Microsoft's C compiler to compile the necessarylibraries.  Make sure you copy the libraries and header files to a locationwhich Mingw is looking for them.  I have left this step to the Apple IIuser community to work out since I have no interest of a Windows port ofKEGS at this time.  I will appreciate any feedback of any problems with theKEGS code to ensure the greatest cross-platform compatibility.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 29, Top 41, Msg 41)>>>>>"""""I should add that it looks like mingw may now be included with cygwin sothe MSYS and separate mingw may no longer be necessary.
