When I wroteup a review on Asimov, one thing I discovered is the program is verysensitive to bad media or corrupted/damaged volumes. I'm not quite surewhat that error is referring to exactly though, I'd have to look it up torefresh my memory. <<To nitpick it sounds like a ProDOS error code.A program like Asimov would have three parts.1) Read a volume block by block.2) Process that data in this case format it to .2mg format.3) Write the data.Part 1 would likely be ProDOS READ_BLOCK call which doesn't use filereference numbers.Part 2 probably just straight memory manipulation and no ProDOS callinvolved.Part 3 would need to use calls like OPEN (which assigns the referencenumber), READ, WRITE, CLOSE which all require that reference number tofunction. Here is where the error is likely coming from.So it looks like that under certain circumstances that a call to a READ,WRITE or CLOSE is happening either before the OPEN is executed or thereference number assigned by the OPEN is being corrupted. This could be dueto either a bug in Asimov or another process (bad CDA, NDA?) chewing upAsimov's memory space.Mark PercivalSyndicomm.com Apple II Forum RTC Host"Midweek Madness" every Wednesday night!7:00 pm - 9:00 pm Pacific Time(PERCIM, 3539.55, Delphi A2 web side)[EOA][TTC]-------------------------------             THE TINKERER'S CORNER |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>                           Persistence Pays Off                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     It was my weekly visit to the local Salvation Army "As Is" store...all sales are final here... no returns of merchandise that doesn't work.     It was a sorry looking sight.
