Today we will get a view From Down On The Rock Riverwhile we take a luncheon cruise on the "Queen".     Here comes the van from 'Erv's Quick Buy Pie Shell' delivering the boxlunches.  Time to board the boat.     Ah... roast beef sandwich, potato salad, chips, brownie, and a choiceof soda.  It is a delightful day... sunny with a gentle breeze.     The tour guide points out the landmarks and history of this section ofthe river.  A factory building remodeled into a beautiful office building.A marina in a building that once housed a small brewery.  Steps leadingfrom the shoreline to a picnic area... originally led to a resort.  Ahousing development built in an area that once was home to an amusementpark.  And classic homes that have withstood the test of time.     Notice a recurring theme here... buildings that have been renovatedfor a new use... and land that has been redeveloped for a new use.                 The Apple II's, The Tinkerer's Computers                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     If you buy a new computer today it might become 'obsolete' before youcan get it home.  Yet there are those who just won't give up their AppleII's.  And some who find an Apple II of some sort at a garage sale orthrift store and say to them self, "This is neat... I wonder what I can dowith this."     This month in The Tinkerer's Corner we deal with upgrading your SCSIhard drive to one with a greater capacity.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA]---------------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[NFT]NEW FILE - tool128 v1.01""""""""""""""""""""""""There is a new file in the system_software/misc_16-bit/tools directory:File: tool128v101.bxySize: 46848Date: Aug 3Here is a description from the author, Geoff Weiss, taken from his messagein Category 20, Topic 13:As announced at KFest, An updated version of the Hash Tool Set is nowavailable.

Thiscan be done quite economically due to the fact that there are SCSI drivesout there that have too little capacity for the newer computers but arevery adequate for the Apple II's.This project is made easier by the fact that there really is a lot ofstandardization of the necessary connections among the various SCSI drivesand the enclosures.  The power connectors and the SCSI cable connectors aredesigned so the can only be connected one way.What You Will Need''''''''''''''''''1. An enclosure (case).  The ideal one has a built in power supply andcooling fan.  Many of the older cases were built to hold a 5 1/4" drive.These will also serve just fine for a 3 1/2" drive.2. The SCSI hard drive.  Look for an Apple brand (manufactured by severalcompanies).  This way your "new" drive will have an Apple rom on board.This will make it much easier to set up the drive for the Apple II.  A 250to 500 MB drive should serve quite well.  Even an 80 MB might be a realupgrade from what you have.3. SCSI cables.  One to connect the SCSI card in your computer to theconnector on the enclosure.  Another one to connect the first case to thesecond case if you plan to have more than one drive connected at the sametime.4. A terminator might be necessary if there is no provision for terminationon the drive itself.5. A SCSI card.  If you are upgrading to a higher capacity drive youalready have one.Where to Get What You Need''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Thrift stores.2. Garage sales.3. Usenet... comp.sys.apple2.marketplace4. A2 on Syndicomm5. LEM-Swap list <http://lowendmac.com/lists/swap.html>6. Alltech Electronics <http://www.allelec.com/indexa2.html">8. Other World Computer <http://www.macsales.com/">9. Mac-Res-Q <http:/www.macresq.com> or call 1-888-447-3728Installing the Drive in the Enclosure''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Open the case.2. Disconnect and remove the old drive.  Make notes of connections for the   SCSI id control and the activity light.3. Mount the new drive securely within the case.  (Drill new holes if   necessary).4. Connect the power cable and the SCSI cable.  The connectors are built so   they only be connected one way.5. Connect the SCSI id system if it will fit.  Otherwise set the SCSI id of   the drive using jumpers.  (See the section on SCSI id).6. Connect the activity light.  (The drive will work just fine even if you   can not make this connection).7. Close the case.Using the 'New' Hard Drive''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Connect the drive to the SCSI card using the appropriate cable.2. Partition the hard drive and format each partition.     a. ProDOS partitions have a maximum size of 32mb.     b. HFS partitions can be larger.     c. The 8 bit Apple II's must use ProDOS partitions.     d. The GSOS can use both ProDOS and HFS partitions.3. Install the operating system on the first partition.     a. ProDOS 8 for the 8 bit Apple II's.     b. System 6.01 for the IIgs.4. Copy your files to the 'new' drive/install additional software.Rules For the SCSI Chain''''''''''''''''''''''''1. The chain must have term power.     a. The RamFast SCSI card can provide term power by setting a switch.     b. The Apple HS and Rev.C SCSI cards do not supply term power but can        be modified to do so.             To modify the Apple SCSI cards to provide term power see:                  http://ground.ecn.uiowa.edu/apple2/Docs/hispeed.gif                  http://ground.ecn.uiowa.edu/apple2/Docs/revc.gif     c. Some drives supply term power to the SCSI chain.2. Termination... The device (hard drive, CD ROM drive, etc.) at each end   of the chain must be terminated.     a. The RamFast and Apple HS SCSI cards are terminated.     b. The Apple Rev.C card is not terminated.  It can be terminated by        placing a 'pass through' terminator between the card and the first        SCSI device.     c. Some drives are terminated internally.  Some drives control        internal termination with a jumper.  Some drives have a switch        outside the case to turn termination on or off.  A drive that is        not terminated internally can be terminated externally by        installing a terminator on one of the SCSI connectors on the        outside of the case.3. NOTE... term power and termination are two different things.  Each must   be dealt with separately according to the appropriate rule.4. Each device in the chain must have a unique SCSI id.  SCSI id's range   from 0 through 7.     a. When using the Apple HS and Rev.C SCSI cards id 7 is reserved for        the use of the card.     b. The RamFast SCSI card operates without a SCSI id.5. Setting the SCSI id of a hard drive or CD ROM drive.     a. Most enclosures (cases) have a device outside the case to set the        SCSI id of the drive.  If you are installing a drive in a new or        used case you might or might not be able to properly connect the        drive to the external id switch.     b. If you can not properly connect the drive to this switch you can        control the SCSI id of the drive using jumpers.  You can often find        out how to do this for a given drive by visiting the web site of        the manufacturer of that drive.             See: "Controlling the SCSI ID of Hard Drive" in TLMP0201             At: http://lamp.a2central.com/Example SCSI Chain''''''''''''''''''Apple HS SCSI card    SCSI id=7   TerminatedSCSI cableCD ROM drive          SCSI id=0   Not terminatedSCSI cableHard drive            SCSI id=6External terminator               Terminates the hard drive[EOA]------------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------[LET]LETTER TO THE EDITOR""""""""""""""""""""Dear Lamp Editor,Thank you for continuing to produce such a fine newsletter for the Apple IIcommunity.

Talking to a few people at KFest this year the consensus isthat Sheppy running Syndicomm is a blessing and a curse.

Why did he do the latter, you ask? Because he has written anApple IIgs emulator in Java that has the debugging capabilities that hewants so that it will be easier for him to test Marinetti and any othercode he wants to work on.
