This building, withits distinctive shape, originally housed one of the Rockford newspapers andan apartment occupied by the owner and publisher of the paper.  Theapartment, located in the upper floors, has a beautiful, unobstructed viewof the city.  One of the features of the apartment is an interior fireescape... a slide within a metal tube... to deliver people using it to theoutside at ground level.     Through a series of mergers the News Tower is now owned by theRockford Register Star.  As the newspaper grew over the years, a series ofadditions were made to the building to house the expanding operations.Recently another building was added... to house their new press... so tallthat the building is as tall as a five story building... even though it hasonly one floor.     The newspaper is very proud of their new equipment... they offered atour of their operations.  As we toured the various departments...classified ad sales, commercial ad sales, promotion, layout, delivery,online production, printing plate prep... we noticed that every desk had acomputer monitor and a keyboard.  Input to the newspaper by some 350employees was via their computer network.  The only employees that didn'tuse the network were the drivers of the delivery trucks... and their dailyinstructions were via a computer printout.     The new press was the star of the show.  The computer monitor in thecontrol room could display any one full page of the paper being printed.Adjustments could be made on the run to the intensity of black and coloredinks.  A storage room to the side housed the four ink tanks, one black andthree colors.     So you could think of the newspaper production as being as anelaborate computer driving an elaborate printer.     So take pride in your Apple II computer(s) and the place they had inthe evolution of the computers in use today.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson  email:lutefisk837 at sbcglobal dot net[SSR]Sweet16 1.6.1 Released""""""""""""""""""""""I've released Sweet16 1.6.1, which addresses a couple of minor bugs(although not the ones that I get the most email about, which are going totake more work to fix).For details or to download it, visit:http://www.sheppyware.net/software-mac/sweet16/index.htmlEric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 29, Top 39, Msg 5)[EOA][SNS]What's Your Social Networking Site?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Back in Message 494 uptopic, I mentioned the Friendster online networkingservice.

Initially, A2Central.com will continueto be running on Syndicomm's system, but it will likely be relocated atsome point in the future to complete the separation.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd, the owner of Syndicomm, indicated his enthusiasmfor the transfer.  "Syndicomm's role in the Apple II world has grown somuch since I first founded A2Central.com in the summer of 2000 that I justdon't have time to keep up with everything anymore.  It was time to givesomething up, and A2Central.com is the easiest thing to separate from thewhole.  I'm thrilled that someone with Sean's enthusiasm, integrity, andpassion for the Apple II is taking the reins.""I've always wanted to run an Apple II portal," Fahey said when asked whyhe was taking over A2Central.com.  "When Sheppy indicated that he waslooking for someone to take A2Central.com forward, I jumped at the chance.I'm excited for the opportunity to find new and engaging ways to improvethe services offered by A2Central.com, too."This ownership change for A2Central.com does not affect the SyndicommOnline online service or the Syndicomm online store and other products.PRESS CONTACTSEric Shepherd - sheppy@syndicomm.comSean Fahey - sfahey@a2central.comEric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 2, Top 2, Msg 8)[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, lutefisk837 at sbcglobal dot netThe Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KF6]------------------------------                       KFest 2006 |-----------------------------------[CAK]Comments About KFest 2006"""""""""""""""""""""""""Another KFest and a record number of attendees placed their life in myhands as I drove through the streets of Kansas City (and that isn'tcounting those who don't ride in my car ;).  And for the first time, I hadto turn down a passenger who specifically wanted to ride in theGeoffmobile.  Due to the highly popular Geoff-drive-fest, I'll be putting apassenger sign-up list on my door next year to ensure that those who wantto experience it will experience it.  And to my shock, even Sheppywillingly got into my car.  I'm sensing partial forgiveness for POTA.Perhaps even this much -> <- :)KFest was a blast--I'm so glad that I went.  And I was considering notgoing, after ten consecutive years.  All of the new faces brought a freshperspective to what Apple II computing has come to.  And it came to myattention that there is still an active Apple II base at least in thethousands (I had thought the number was much smaller than that).Hackfest projects show some originality.  The difficulty of the task thatMargaret tackled really impressed me.  I wish her the best of luck as shecontinues her development (if you get stuck coding, there will be plenty ofhelp in your favorite programmer's forums).And special thanks to Jeri who offered a very interesting suggestion of aprogram which has never been attempted before on a IIgs.  Not that everyproblem  was resolved which might still make it impractical, but new ideasgot generated for what an accelerated IIgs might be able to do with moderndata formats.I learned that there was a strong correlation between Dr. Who and Apple II.Dr-Who-Fest lasted 1.5 hours this year.  This should be continued and maybeeven extended next year.   There was a comment that thinking of new tieideas for the formal dinner was getting harder and harder.  Perhapssomething in Dr. Who can be an inspiration--even hanging a dalek aroundyour neck shows some thought was put into it.The trip home was happily uneventful.  Time to catch up on sleep.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 5, Top 8, Msg 24)>>>>>"""""It was good to see you again Geoff.
