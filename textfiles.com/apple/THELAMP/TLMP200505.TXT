Email isused to distribute minutes of meetings to board members.     Their own Web Site provides an efficient tool to provide informationabout the organization.

Also, Ithink I had a similar problem to you with the "Mass Format" utility I wrotein Applesoft.Here are some notes taken from the "readme" for my MUG! NDA (MS-DOSUtilities for those that don't know it).****************Apple's 3.5" Disk Controller seems to have a problem when it does alow-level format on a double-density MFM disk (ie. 720K). The formatprocess actually completes, and the system doesn't crash, but you can nolonger access *any* 3.5" disks! You must eject the disk and do a'three-finger-salute' reboot (a normal shutdown does not seem to beenough), after which you can finish the original operation. For example,'Diskcopy' will format the target disk if it is unformatted or the wrongsize (eg. 800K). After the format, the program fails as described above,but after rebooting the copy proceeds as the disk is now formatted.'Format' similarly fails after the low-level format, but after rebootingyou can use the 'Quick format' option to write the empty directory, etc.Note that this format problem can be seen with other programs, not justMUG!The problem *DOES NOT* occur with 1.44Mb (high-density) disks - this is notreally surprising as they are already MFM-formatted for both Apple andMSDOS use. Note that 'Diskcopy' will copy 720K disks just fine if thetarget disk has previously been formatted for 720K.****************Not a lot of help, I know.
