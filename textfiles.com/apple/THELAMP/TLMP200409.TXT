Almost hidden among the changing leaves are thepower and telephone lines.  Cell phone towers sprout from hills.  Thisleads to contemplation of the evolution of electronic communication duringone's lifetime.     Back on the farm there were the poles carrying the two copper wires ofthe telephone system.  The wooden box mounted on the kitchen wall was ownedby the phone company and serviced by them if needed.  Two bells mounted atthe top on the outside, a crank on the outside on the right, a hinged arm12" in length allowed the mouthpiece to be adjusted for height, thereceiver hanging on a hook on the left side.  And a knife switch on thewall above the box to disconnect the phone during thunder storms.     It was a party line.  The number of parties varied... at one timethere were 27 parties on the one line.  Calling someone on the same lineinvolved using the crank to generate the power to ring the bells on allthose phones on the line... each party having a different combination oflong and short rings.     Calling someone on another line in the same exchange involved callingthe operator with one long ring and asking for the party by name.  Same forcalling someone long distance in another exchange.     It was easy to listen in on someone else's conversation so it happenedoften.  While you were talking to someone the signal would slowly becomestronger as the snoopers decided the conversation was not interesting andwould hang up.     For a fee the phone company would have the operator give a "generalring" (a really long ring) calling all phones on all lines of the exchangeand reading an advertisement.     The operators got to learn a lot about people in the community... whowas calling who... what they were talking about... etc.     By today's standards it was rather crude... but it was possible totalk to your friends and relatives without traveling to their home... orderfuel delivery to the farm... check on grain prices before hauling yourgrain to the elevator for marketing... check to see if a certain spare partwas available for your machinery, etc.     As time went on there were the dial phones... the party lines whereyou heard only your own ring... the private lines... the touch tonephones... own your own phones... multiple lines... direct dialing... faxmachines... modems... faster and faster modems... wireless (cell) phones.     And now DSL... and competition from the TV cable systems... to movedata faster and faster...     Broadband in the home must be getting quite popular... the localSalvation Army "As Is" store has 56K modems for $1... I picked up a spareand it works![EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TNU]TWO NEW UPLOADS IN A2 LIBRARY"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""There are two new uploads in thea2/system_software/misc_16-bit/desk_accessories/nda directory:File: myipnda1b2.bxySize: 6656Date: Aug 22MyIPNDA 1.0b2 is the latest version of my simple New Desk Accessory forreporting the IP address of the Apple IIgs it runs on.

It might be better to think morealong the lines of Claris Emailer Lite 1.0. :)Then there is just the issue of a big project.  It's much more likely smallprojects will get done than big ones, because of the time and size of suchprojects, and then there's the psychological factor--there's a certainreward psychologically of getting something finished and out the door.Like many other things in life, a completed program is likely to result inmore completed programs, and it can be contagious, which is only good forthe Apple II community :)In any case, I think that the idea of a bunch of small programs workingtogether is a great one.

Run tcpdump while the GS is communicating withyour server and you can see what it is sending/receiving.  This makestroubleshooting much easier.  qpopper should be pretty trivial to set up onthe UNIX side.Second, you need to determine which area of the code is hanging.  Assumingmemory is in a state where it is not trashed or to a point where it isslightly trashed, the two areas where the problem is the while loop _or_the TCPIPReadTCP.  Unless you add some debugging code, you will need to useGSBug to figure that out.  If memory is getting very trashed,TCPIPStatusTCP could fail and you have bigger problems since all it does itcopy values of a few socket variables.  Again, GSBug or adding debug codewill help.It also isn't a good idea to just toss any data from the receive queue ifthe rrMoreFlag is set.  If _TaskMaster is being called by any app, thenTCPIPPoll can get called automagically and you could purge data that youare expecting.

For that I must apologize. The problem was simply too muchto do and not enough time to do it (again).HELP!     World events at the start of 2001 were, as usual, unsettled. Theresult of the U.S. Presidential election was finally decided amid muchcontroversy in favor of George W. Bush, and he was inaugurated in January2001. Race car driver Dale Earnhardt was killed at a race in the Daytona500 when his car struck a wall at 180 mph in the final lap. California'senergy situation worsened, and with record shortages of electricity,rolling blackouts occurred over the state. Oklahoma City bomber TimothyMcVeigh was executed on June 11th. And on Tuesday, September 11, the UnitedStates sustained a major terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in NewYork and on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The uncertainty of the sourceand extent of the attacks led the government to take the unprecedentedaction of grounding ALL air traffic in the country until the causes couldbe clearly determined. A part of the aftermath to the devastating attackincluded a major drop in the stock market, although this had improved bythe end of the year. Anthrax-tainted mail was discovered at major mediaoutlets and government offices, which further disrupted the economy. Whileinvestigators sought clues to the source, the offices of the postal systemhad to cleaned of any remaining particles of the infectious agent. TheTaliban-controlled government in Afghanistan came under direct attack [by]of a coalition of nations led by the United States, in an effort to captureOsama bin Laden, the suspected organizer of the September 11th attacks.     Microsoft announced on January 1, 2001 that Windows 95 had beenreclassified as a legacy product, and would no longer be sold or shipped.The company also introduced its own entry in the console gaming market, theXBox, which was the first gaming system to contain a hard drive. ByOctober, Microsoft also updated its Windows operating system with theintroduction of Microsoft Windows XP. In April, Dell became the largest PCmaker in the U.S. USB 2.0 was introduced as a higher-speed upgrade to theoriginal Universal Serial Bus interface. CPU's running at 1.4 Gigahertzbegan to become available. Excite@Home.com went into bankruptcy, as thedot-com bust further expanded.     At Apple, new models of the Power Mac G4 were released, with processorspeeds going beyond 500 MHz for the first time, with the support of a 133MHz system bus. Later in the year, the speed increased to 667 and 733 MHz.The higher end Power Mac G4 also included the SuperDrive, this time thename indicating the ability to read and write CD-ROM and DVD formats. Thetitanium PowerBook G4 also was introduced, starting at speeds of 400 and500 MHz. Updated consumer desktop Macs were the Flower Power and BlueDalmation iMacs, at speeds from 400 to 600 MHz. Beginning in March, Applebegan to ship Mac OS X 10.0, and version 10.1 appeared in September.Finally, new iBooks were released, receiving a speed increase to 500 and667 MHz. The form of the computer was also changed, from the originalcolored clam-shell appearance to a more standard-sized white form.THE LAMP! INFO     The year 2001 began with a near-emergency involving the production ofThe Lamp! itself. Just as Delphi had promised (threatened? warned?) duringlate 2000, the text-based part of the service began to experience failureswithin six weeks of the November 1st date that maintenance on that part ofDelphi was due to be discontinued. Editor Lyle Syverson used this as anopportunity to promote the new bulletin board system available in theSyndicomm.com service. By February, he found it necessary to depend on thepostings in the Apple II forum on Syndicomm.com for much of his material,as the message traffic on Delphi had declined considerably since thefailure of the text side of Delphi.DELPHI A2 FORUM     This malfunction of Delphi's text side, which had long been accessiblevia telnet, occurred during late December 2000. The Delphi systemprogrammers were focused almost exclusively on the web-based messageboards, which had been set up to take a message posted on the text side,move it to the web side, and then back to the text side again for display.The function of this failed, came back and worked inconsistently, and thenby mid-January 2001 was not functioning at all.     As the Internet boom of the late 1990's began to wind down, serviceswhose business model was based on advertising traffic began to see thatthis revenue model was not working very well. Many services that had beenhoping to make a killing in the online world were instead findingTHEMSELVES being killed. As Delphi was increasingly feeling the squeeze,its president, Rusty Williams, posted a message in January announcing theneed to reduce some support positions on its staff. During 2000, Delphi andanother Internet service called "Well Engaged" (which originated yearsearlier as "The Well") had combined forces to form Propsero Technologies, abusiness dedicated to managing message boards and chat services. Williams'letter went on to discuss ways in which services would be automated inorder to make do without as much staff. The consequences of this, as wellas the inconsistent functioning of the text access to the service, caused asignificant decline in activities in the Delphi A2 Forum.     Making official what was obvious to those trying to use the service,Delphi announced on February 22 that the text and web forum access would nolonger be connected (that is, a message posted on one side would no longerappear on the other side).  Finally, text subscribers were told in ane-mail on March 12 that as of May 1, 2001, all text-based services would becompletely discontinued. This included e-mail accounts, text messages, andtext-based chat. Because of this, and the significantly decreasedparticipation in the Monday (or Thursday) Night Chats, Joe Kohn decided todiscontinue his sponsoring of those special nights on Delphi. Archives ofmany of the bulletin board messages on Delphi A2 that were posted whileSyndicomm had managed the forum were made available on A2Central.com.A2CENTRAL.COM / SYNDICOMM     A2Central.com added e-mail service for its members in early January2001. It was made to work with any POP3-compatible e-mail program forreading mail, and required the use of the mail menu at the site in order tosend mail. Addresses were <username@a2people.com>.     In February, Syndicomm began the testing of enhanced account servicesfor A2Central.com. These enhanced accounts included 10 megabytes of storagespace, accessible via FTP, which could be used for storing anything,including a personal web site. At a rate of $15 per month, or $35 perquarter, some might have considered it too expensive; however, if youcompared this to the costs of subscribing to GEnie or Delphi or CompuServein their prime ($6-$9/hour), this was quite reasonable. One advantage ofthe enhanced service was the offering (in April) to these subscribers of anSSL-capable version of Lynx (a text-based web browser). By August, theenhanced service was expanded to be available to ALL subscribers, withoutany additional cost.     Members of the A2Central.com service were encouraged to write articlesfor the web site's news and reviews section, and a month of free servicewas offered to stimulate interest.     Starting in April it was also announced that Dave Miller had begunworking as Syndicomm's first full time employee, continuing the programmingwork necessary to build the service up into more than just a text-basedApple II community. Specifically, he was focused on fully upgrading theinterface and the coordination between the telnet and web-based sides ofthe service. He also upgraded the forum bulletin board software to givemuch faster results when scanning.     As part of the conversion of the forum and other parts of the serviceto Syndicomm.com, e-mail addresses were changed from<username@a2people.com> to <username@syndicomm.com>. Furthermore, personalweb space was now accessible at <http://www.syndicomm.com/~username>.Payment of the subscription to Syndicomm was also now possible via creditcards.     Around the time Miller began to work further on the system,instructions were posted instructing users to start accessing Syndicomm bytelnet to "syndicomm.com" instead of to "a2central.com" as it hadoriginally been designed. The reason for this was the beginning ofdifferentiation of the service into more forums than just the pioneeringApple II forum. Other new forums that opened during 2001 included the PalmOS forum (which started in May), and the Gamebits forum (hosted by KenGagne) and the Singles Forum (which opened during the summer). After theSeptember 11th attacks, a WTC forum was opened to discuss the events andtheir aftermath.     In July, the new Syndicomm online store opened. To enhance its productofferings, Sheppy negotiated arrangements to distribute Balloon, AutoArk,Shrink II, the line of Parkhurst Micro Products, and all of The Byte Worksand APDA products.HARDWARE NEWS     During 2001, the theme of many postings in the A2 forum focused onhelp with old hardware. These discussions included:o ADB device hot-swapping problemso Apple II Video Overlay Card and its pinouts for cable connectiono Apple IIe to IIGS upgrades and how to perform themo Apple IIe and IIGS favorite RAM cardso Apple IIGS accelerators and how they work(ed)o Apple IIGS recommended upgradeso Apple SCSI card DIP switch settingso DSL vs Cable modemso Dvorak keyboard modification instructions for the Apple IIe (thanks toChuck Stiles)o LocalTalk connections between a Mac and a IIGSo Monitors used on Apple II computers in the past, including the use of aCommodore 1040 monitor on the IIGSo MS-DOS disk formatting for optimum use with the MUG! utilityEMULATOR NEWS     F.E. Systems' Bernie ][ The Rescue 3.0 Preview, announced atKansasFest 2000, was released in January. It had improved full-screen mode,improvement in sound, and various speed improvements.     Charlie Danemark released FishWings in April. It was a freeware diskimage management tool for Windows. An update in May added limited DOS 3.3support.     "KEGS" (Ken's Emulated GS) had been mentioned only briefly in TheLamp! before this month. In 1999, the contents of a future Juiced.GS issueindicated that it was to be discussed in that issue, but thus far it hadnot appeared to any extent in The Lamp!. KEGS was designed for X-Windows(Unix) and KEGS32 was a port designed to run under Windows. In April,Thomas Compter released DiskChanger, a disk-mounting utility to simplifymanagement of disk images used with KEGS32.SOFTWARE NEWS:: COLLECTIONS ::     During March, collections of Apple II software on various FTP siteswere discussed. Also, Thomas Compter listed in the April issue the variouspieces of software he has written for the Apple II+, IIGS, Windows, and theWeb.     Juiced.GS publisher Max Jones prepared to release a Friends For LifeVolume 2 CD. Eric Shepherd released The Totally Sheppyware CD in May, andJoe Kohn released the A2-Central-On-Disk collection on 3.5 disks in July.     Howard Katz announced new additions to the Lost Classics Project inJuly, not only software (Beneath Apple Manor, Babble, and Linker) but alsobooks (Beneath Apple DOS, and Bag Of Tricks).:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::     Along with the various discussions of hardware that appeared during2001, software also received some attention. In April, favorite wordprocessors were debated and compared, ranging from Apple Writer (DOS 3.3version), Magic Window, Letter Perfect, SuperText, and Word Handler, toAppleWorks and AppleWorks GS, to EgoEd, ShadowWrite, and Hermes.     Geoff Weiss updated SCAP (Spectrum Create A PDF) to v1.1.1.     Lucas Scharenbroich released a beta of his project, GTE (Generic TileEngine), which helped in production of graphic tiles consistent with gamesused on various console games (i.e., Nintendo). (The current version ofthis product cam be found at http://iigs.dreamhost.com/gte/gte.html):: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::     Since A2Central.com was beginning to become a gathering place for theApple II faithful, a new offline reader was needed to help automate itsuse. One that was announced in January was written by Ewen Wannop andreleased as an open beta. SOAR was a collection of scripts made to workwith Spectrum 2.5.1 or greater, Marinetti 2.0 or 2.1, and an internetprovider with TCP/IP access. It was updated several times during the year.     Not to be outdone, ProTERM 3.1 also got into the act with a freescript for offline reading of A2Central.com written by Ryan Suenaga.Furthermore, Sheppy issued a programming challenge to anyone who couldproduce ports of CoPilot (for ProTERM 3, Spectrum, Talk Is Cheap, orANSITerm) or GEM (GEnieMaster) to work with A2Central.com. Since thestructure of the new service was quite similar to GEnie in its prime, thiswas certainly possible. A reward of $25 off of KansasFest registration wasoffered.     Wannop also released another Spectrum-scripted product in June. SAFE(Spectrum Automated File Exchange) v1.0 was a freeware FTP client for theApple IIGS. Kim Howe released his Telnet NDA for the Apple IIGS in April,and in May, Ninjaforce released Samurai, an Classic Desk Accessory-basedIRC client for the Apple IIGS.     IPNetRouter for the Mac was discussed in February as a way to allow aIIGS equipped with a LANceGS card to share an Internet connection with aMacintosh.     Kim Howe's Arachnid web browser for the Apple IIGS was updated toPreview 3. (It is still available today athttp://www.a2central.com/~kimhowe/arachnid.html, rather than at the linkmentioned in the Lamp article from 2001.) :: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::     February's issue of The Lamp! included a discussion of variousavailable IIGS programming languages and their advantages or disadvantages.In March, one topic of discussion was methods of translating (porting)programs from one language to another.     It was suggested in April that a "net install" version of System 6.0.1for the Apple IIGS made, one that had the full set of disks combined intoone large file. This would simplify the installation for those who wereinstalling it on an emulator. (Whether or not anything came of thissuggestion has never been revealed in The Lamp!):: GAMES ::     Jeff Fink continued to be busy during 2001 revising Silvern Castle. Anupdate to version 6.0 was released in December 2000, and by mid-January2001 he had produced version 7.0. It was re-written to run completely underMicroDot BASIC. Further updates to the game come out during the year, up toversion 7.3. Fink also uploaded several other games and utilities that hehad written, all as freeware.     Sheppy's Lemonade Stand GS was updated to v1.0.2 to correct a bug, andThomas Compter released his Apple IIGS game "Hammurabi", in both text andIIGS desktop versions.PUBLICATIONS     Juiced.GS continued to publish, concluding its fifth year and startingits sixth year. A surprise was announced at KansasFest: Max Jones, who hadbeen editor and publisher of the magazine since its start, was turning overthe magazine to Ryan Suenaga as editor, and Syndicomm as publisher.     A web site was discovered for The Apple Blossom, which had been out ofprint since 1998. (This site, www.appleblossom.net still works today.)     Syndicomm announced in May that it would be able to distribute pastissues GS+ magazines and copies of EGO software, having been grantedpermission by Ross Falconer.KANSASFEST     Registration for KFest 2001 opened in March. As in recent years, itwas sponsored by InTrec Software, Inc. The KFest FAQ, written by RyanSuenaga, was updated to version 3.0 and appeared in the May issue. Also inthat issue were recollections of fond memories of KFest events by pastattendees.     Webcasting of the event was again planned for this year. Sheppyannounced that he was going to use Sorenson Broadcaster this year tosimplify the production of the webcasts. He also planned to design thesetup to not overload the Avila network with webcasting as happened in2000.     KansasFest's keynote speaker for 2001 was Eric Shepherd, and therecipient of the annual roast was Juiced.GS publisher Max Jones. Thesessions presented at the conference ranged from the technical (the LANceGScard, by Geoff Weiss, and ways of getting the Internet to a IIGS, by RyanSuenaga), to games (Silvern Castle Exposed, by Bruce Baker), to thehistorical (Tony Diaz's tour of his Apple2.org site). Margaret Anderson wonfirst place in HackFest, and Joe Kohn won the GShisen tournament. The "BiteThe Bag" contest was again held, won this year by Geoff Weiss.WRITERS     For the third year in a row, Ryan Suenaga presented the Apple IIAchievement Awards in the January issue. The Best Commercial Product awardwas given to The Byte Works' Opus ][ CD collection. The Best SharewareProduct was Lemonade Stand GS, by Eric Shepherd, with Sarah Shepherd's GSROM Grabber given runner-up status. The award for Best Freeware Product wasgiven to Jeff Fink's Silvern Castle, which had changed status fromshareware to freeware during 2000. The honor for Best Publication againwent to Max Jones' Juiced.GS. The outstanding Apple II-Related Developmentwas given to //SHH Systeme's LANceGS Ethernet card. Finally, the award forOutstanding Individual Achievement went to Eric Shepherd for his manycontributions to the Apple II community both in 2000 and in past years.     Another major article by Suenaga in January was one describing the newSyndicomm.com online service (called initially by the same name as the website, A2Central.com).MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES     Sheppy announced plans to update and reproduce the Apple II TechnicalNotes, which had not been touched for quite a while. He asked for help increating these updates.     The merits of the use of PayPal for sales of items on eBay wasdiscussed in March. Ways to become a programmer were also debated thatmonth. Memories of the introduction of the Apple IIGS were related in theJuly issue. In November, the Apple II Documentation Project was announced.STATS     Here are statistics for the first ten years of GEnieLamp and The Lamp!The numbers refer to the size of each issue in "K" (kilobytes):Year    Min     Max     Avg----    ----    ----    ----1992    116K    212K    156K1993     80K    256K    172K1994    124K    216K    165K1995     92K    176K    125K1996     80K    192K    116K1997     44K    124K     85K1998     68K    156K    102K1999     59K    120K     91K2000     47K     81K     60K2001     47K     96K     71KMAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR     I have decided to do one additional ITL column during 2004, to coverthe events of the year 2002 for The Lamp! After that, ITL will re-emergesome time during 2005, and deal with 2003 and 2004. Although life hassignificantly slowed down, it is still a bit hairy at times, and to keep MEfrom being too spaced out on my own magical tour will require some moretime to work on other projects I've had to set aside for quite a while.Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.orgReferences:"About Prospero"http://www.prosperotechnologies.com/about.htmComputer History For The Year 2001http://www.computerhope.com/history/2001.htm"Delphi, Well Engaged To Form Propsero 01/25/00", Newbytes(link no longer available)The History Of Computing Projecthttp://www.thocp.netThe History Of The World Timelinehttp://www.historychannel.com/timeline/index.jsp?year=2001Macintosh History: 2001http://www.lowendmac.com/history/2001.shtml[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][SSA]September 2004 Issue of Syndicommotion Available""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The September 2004 (Volume 3, Number 9) issue of Syndicommotion has beenemailed to subscribers.
