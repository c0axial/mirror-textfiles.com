It may makesense if someone likes to build hardware and money and time is not anissue. It does make sense if the involved minds simply like to talk abouttheir dream machines.

Thehacker spirit is pretty much slain by emulation.Yes, there's advantages to emulation, of that I have no doubt -- but youcan write your grandma an email, or you can write her a hand-writtenletter. Which is more real? Which is more authentic? Do you see what I'mgetting at here? Abandoning the architecture is the white flag. If weemulate the IIGs on a PC, that loses the distinction of buying an apple inthe first place; if we emulate it on a Mac, that says to Apple that thepassage of years somehow rights the wrong of leaving the II users to die onthe battlefield.

That would not be the 'real thing' any longer, and sowould not be a IIgs.I own three 'real' IIgs, but they are put away in the cupboard and onlybrought out if and when I need them. 99% of the work and enjoyment I getfrom a IIgs is by means of an emulator. An emulator that looks and feels asclose to a IIgs as the Swiss dog handlers can make it, but has a superfastaccelerator built in which helps dramatically speed up the work I do on it.All the proposals to enhance Bernie, revolve round trying to make it nearerand nearer to the 'real thing', and more closely integrate it with its hostenvironment, just as 'add on' cards do to a real IIgs.It is clear to me that there are two camps here, both considering thefuture of the IIgs:Firstly, the camp that only wants to 'play' with hardware. For themrebuilding the real thing, albeit as a new and different machine, isimportant. That direction could never be more than a pipe dream in myopinion, as costs in the end will force it to be unrealistic. Look how longit took, and how much it cost, for Apple to develop new IIgs motherboards.Second, is the camp of people who actually do things on their IIgs, ratherthan only play with hardware. For them an emulator is acceptable, as longas it is as close to the real thing as possible. Their pipe dream alreadyexists on several platforms, and is being improved all the time. The costof an emulator is entirely realistic.I am firmly in the second camp, and if I am to invest in new hardware,would rather take the much cheaper option of upgrading to a G4 or G5,rather than purchasing the proposed more expensive and untried 'son ofIIgs' motherboard. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Fri 21 Apr 2000 - 96 days till Y2KFest Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.3 & Crock O' Gold 3.3 Bernie ][ the Rescue 2.5.1 woofing at 55Mhz on a G3/350 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/(EWANNOP, 30642, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""Hello Tarage,Your mission is noble. Yet you're missing some facts about the feasibilityof your undertaking. You can dream about the most fantastic machine, butthat doesn't bring the Apple II platform any further. If I had the choicebetween an intellectually stimulating and a real, usable contribution, I'dpick the second one any minute.Emulation is about the most efficient way of keeping a platform alive.There are hundreds of people becoming involved with their favorite Apple IIsoftware _today_ thanks to emulation. Here's a statement I received lastMonday:"I love playing all my old games again!"You call this surrender?Prove me wrong and make a SuperGS. We've gone the software route, and therewas an army of specialists involved: Richard, Ewen, Eric, Tony, Joe, Ryan,David Empson, Neil Parker, Andy Stadler, Greg Schaefer, some guys fromApple, among many, many others. Only with their help and a lot, lot, lot offree time on their and our hand the emulator has become something thatdoesn't suck way too much. I'm leaving it up to you to estimate the scopeof your SuperGS project.Prove me wrong. I honestly wish you good luck.Henrik Woof Gudatwoof woof(GUDATH, 30646, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""As a //e "holdover" I don't even use a GS on a regular basis, but I'vealready decided that if I should ever be able to afford it, I want to get aMac G4 Powerbook--not to use as a mac so much, but to run Bernie, andfinally have a true portable AppleWorks. :)Making ne hardware is a good idea, but if most if not all of what I'd wanta "new" GS to do is built into the Mac and used by Bernie, that makesBernie a "true" GS as far as my use of it goes.Later............Howard(HKATZ, 30658, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""I can certainly understand the point about emulators losing something, thatkind of magic the real hardware possesses.I can think of a recent example from just last week in fact. Although ittook some time and tinkering, I finally managed to get a CD-ROM drive"talking" with the IIgs and RamFAST. I'm sure it would be much simpler andless hassle if I installed a copy of Bernie on a PowerMac and used theCD-ROM drive already built-in on that system, but seeing the softwareemulated IIGS-Finder mount CD's, using _modern_ Macintosh hardware, is allrather dull and ho-hum. I use CD's on my PC as casually as I would a floppydrive on an Apple II and don't think twice about it, but there is just thissense of excitement seeing and *knowing* my 14 year computer is readingcompact discs and playing audio CD's all by itself.Another bit of fun I wouldn't have had with an emulator: I also just tookapart my external SCSI drive, squeezed the mechanism inside a Pegasus case(again more tinkering since it didn't quite fit). Then I wanted to see whenthe drive accessed, so spliced some wires, found a LED and figured out away to position it (took several tries) so it causes the GS's green powerLED to flicker orange whenever the drive accesses. When I finally puteverything together, it was neat seeing an Apple IIGS box boot into theFinder with no boxes or cables attached to it. Not to mention seeing thepower light flash whenever the HD was accessed.All simple things, but fun, cool and something to admire. Again, Berniewould have an internal hardrive and CD-ROM, but you just take these thingsfor granted on a modern computer. The challenge is missing.It's kind of like riding on a modern train, traveling on the same tracksand route as a train that used to operate there 125 years ago. It would dothe same job, be much more comfortable and efficient, but would completelylose the feel people got riding on the 125 year old steam engine withantique cars. The experience just cannot be emulated with modern technology-- the physical or emotional feeling. By the same token, you'd just takefor granted the modern train is going to do its job without fail, but theold steam train is something to sort of marvel at for what it'saccomplishing.

You can download it at<http://www.sheppyware.net/products/beos/sweet16/>. This version adds anumber of new features and fixes several bugs, including several thatresult in vastly improved IIgs compatibility.Sweet16 1.5 requires BeOS 5 (either Personal Edition or Pro Edition).New features in Sweet16 1.5:1. You can enable up to 14 MB of memory -- 6 MB more than the maximum   possible on a real Apple IIgs.2. The extended keyboard keys now work (function keys, Home, End, PgUp,   PgDn, etc).3. Supports all keyboard layouts (except Danish, French-Canadian, and   Dvorak -- these aren't well-documented in the IIgs reference manuals).4. The character set ROM is now complete for all languages.5. The Apple IIgs system volume control now works.6. Double-clicking disk images will now launch Sweet16 and mount the image.7. If you launch Sweet16 from a Terminal window, information about your   system will be dumped. This information can be helpful to me in figuring   out any problems you might have.8. Ejecting 5.25" floppy images now plays a unique sound effect.9. Preferences are now kept in a Sweet16 subdirectory in the BeOS settings   directory, to keep things tidy.10. You can use the Option-F1 through Option-F12 keys to temporarily change    your system speed.11. You can now have up to 12 SmartPort devices mounted at once.12. Merged the Video and Sound panels in the preferences window.Bugs fixed in Sweet16 1.5:. Fixed the SmartPort disk formatter to do high-level formats on hard disk  partitions. This prevents you from accidentally toasting the entire drive  instead of just the partition you want to format.. Fixed a number of sound performance problems, including problems with the  speed being off slightly.. Fixed a bug in the MVN and MVP instructions that would do nothing if a  program tried to use them to copy exactly 64 KB of memory.. Fixed two related bugs that caused Sweet16 to crash in a very rare  circumstance in the sta [d],y and lda [d],y instructions. In particular,  clicking Photonix's about button would crash Sweet16.. The clock now takes into account your time zone, thereby reporting thecorrect time.. Modifier keys are no longer polled while the Sweet16 video window isn't  in the foreground.. Fixed a bug in the sta al,x instruction that was crashing Sweet16  (in particular, the Apple IIgs Dealer Demo would crash).. Fixed a general bug in the emulation core that made a number of  instructions malfunction.. Fixed a bug in direct indexed addressing modes that was crashing  HyperCard IIgs, among possible others.. The keyboard is more reliable.. The Recent Disks list is now in most-recent-first order.. The Mount Physical Disks window has been revamped to be easier to use.. The low-level mouse works correctly now.. The speed indicator now refreshes properly when you resize the video  window.. You can no longer mount physical floppy disks more than once.. Fixed a memory leak when mounting image batch files.. Small performance improvement when refreshing the screen.. Fixed a thread synchronization problem that had a slight chance of  crashing Sweet16 when ejecting floppies.. Fixed some speed control problems.. Text screen capture works much better.. The ZipGS Emulation checkbox in the CPU preference panel is now only  enabled if speed control is on.. The Sweet16 application's file type is now correct on x86 systems;  it used to be wrong (thank goodness BeOS is forgiving!).. Fixed some labels in the preferences window that were getting truncated  on some systems. Also changed the way the tabs are arranged to save space  for more tabs later.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 30862, GO COM A2)[EOA][CDR]CD-ROM FOR RAMFAST""""""""""""""""""Well, as luck would have it my Chinon CD-ROM drive (the one I managed toget working on my IIgs) died.

It will speed up your Applesoft programs as muchas 200% by turning them into machine language. It doesn't work for everyprogram, however, due to memory constraints and other technical factors.Please note that ProDOS has been removed from this archive due to spacelimitations: This archive will unshrink as individual files to a 5.25" diskif the user wishes to use one.Now released as Freeware by the Copyright Holder, Alan Bird, via The LostClassics Project.

Changes aremade to the program much like editing a text file with a word processor.Program Writer allows you to quickly scroll to the location in your programyou want to edit. You can also use a mouse for faster cursor control.With Program Writer you can insert, delete, find and replace, renumber,copy and paste, delete lines, add new lines with automatic line numbering,insert control characters, split a line in two, list all the variables inthe program, convert to upper/lower case or copy between programs.The editor is a memory-resident program, hidden from your own BASICprograms. It is always available for use once it has been installed.Because the other program relocates itself, it should be compatible withmost other machine language utilities you may be using already.Now released as Freeware by the author, Alan Bird via the Lost ClassicsProject.
