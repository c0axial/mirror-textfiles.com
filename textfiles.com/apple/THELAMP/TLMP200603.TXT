It depends.  Ifyou want the fastest you will have to buy a new computer regularly so as tokeep up.  On the other hand, if your older computer provides you with asatisfying experience, it is "fast enough".     My first encounter with an Apple II computer was in 1985... anenhanced IIe with a 1MB memory card running AppleWorks 1.3.  A spreadsheetwas used to manage the inventory and ordering some seven hundred chemicalsused in teaching chemistry in the local junior college.  It took a longtime to build the spreadsheet.  Auto calculation had to be turned off... itwould take far too long to recalculate after each entry.  When all theentries were in place you commanded it to calculate and left it alone whileyou worked on something else.  When you came back you had a neat list ofchemicals with the quantity that needed to be ordered for the followingyear.  Plugging along at 1MHz, it was "fast enough"... it saved a lot oftime that would have been required to do the job with a calculator.     So take time to enjoy your Apple II's... even though they are slow bytoday's standards.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[MMN]Any Specific Meaning in A2 Model Numbers?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hello,A question: A writer to me from the History site asked if there is anyspecific meaning to the "model" numbers assigned to the Apple II series.For example, does "A2S4000" mean anything that would identify info aboutthe particular Apple II it was associated with?Thanks!Steven Weyhrich <IX0YE>--<Apple II Historyhttp://apple2history.org(A2HISTORY, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 608)>>>>>"""""Well, the model numbers obviously each describe a specific model ofmachine, but there's no hidden code in the number if that's what they'rewondering.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 609)>>>>>"""""To add to what Sheppy said, a -serial- number (not a part number) mayinclude information such as the date a part was made and a certain facilityit was made at, but that's not really applicable in this case.RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 611)[EOA][WTS]The Woz 6502 T-shirt""""""""""""""""""""If any of you have paid attention to the PodBrix web site, you know thatthe site owner likes to make unique Lego people, which he somehowcustomizes.

It originally was released in the earlier 1990's.For those who don't know, it's a program that converts DOS 3.3 files or5.25" disks to run under any ProDOS-formated media. Basically, the diskimages it creates are nothing more than standard .po (ProDOS) ordered diskimages used by most emulators.Or you can download any .dsk disk image on your PC, use an emulator orCiderPress to transfer the contents to a .po disk image that you transferto your Apple II. Then you just need to adjust the filetype for use underDOS 3.3 Launcher (filetype $F1).From the docs:>>Any disk that uses a standard RWTS (Read/Write Track/Sector) routine can becopied in this manner. This includes not only DOS 3.3 disks, but also manyold games which use a standard RWTS, but are not actually DOS 3.3. They canthen be launched by DOS 3.3 Launcher, which "boots" the large file directlyfrom your hard disk.To run a program, one option is to start DOS 3.3 Launcher from a programselector, but running a program from the IIgs System Finder is much easiersince you simply double click on them, which launches them via ProDOS 8.<<Anyway, I've been using v1.1 of DOS 3.3 Launcher for a long time to run DOS3.3 games from my hard drive directly from the GS Finder. When you doneplaying, you use the control panel Quit DOS 3.3 Launcher option to returnback to the Finder.DOS 3.3 Launcher v1.1 can create disk images of single-load binary files,single or doubled-sided 5.25" disks. And it works great.The latest version is v2.2 and allows to convert multiple disk image (3+)games. However, I cannot get v2.2, or v2.0 to work. Anyone use it?-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 7, Top 21, Msg 10)>>>>>"""""OK, I solved my problems with DOS Launcher v2.2!Apparently later versions of DOS Launcher were made compatible with 8-bitApple IIs, whereas version 1.1 only worked on the Apple IIgs using themessage center.Because of this I think, according to the docs "DOS 3.3 Launcher uses theProDOS firmware entry point at $CN00 + ($CNFF), so it will only work withup to two hard disk partitions per slot" so that ProDOS 8, the P8 DOS 3.3Launcher program, and the DOS 3.3 image files must only be located on thefirst 2 hard drive partitions of any slot.I must admit it took some researching of some older posts on csa2 toconfirm this before I realized this was the problem. But, now it works!Previously, ProDOS 8 was on my 1st hard drive partition (i.e. P8 from theGS System folder), the DOS 3.3 Launcher program on my 2nd partition, andthe image files on my 3rd partition. Moving the image files to the 2ndpartition solved it!-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 7, Top 21, Msg 11)>>>>>"""""Another thing to be aware of while using later versions of DOS 3.3 Launcheris it makes any changes to the disk image directly to the image file,whereas earlier versions only made those changes in memory.While that isn't a problem in of itself, the file must be non-sparse, whichthe DOS 3.3 Launcher copy program does when it creates the image file, butif you later use the Finder or most copy problems to move such files, theywill be made non-sparse again. In that case, use the program's MakeNon-Sparse option.This is only a problem with disk images that do disk writes of course. Ifthe image file is locked, or is non-sparse, DOS 3.3 Launcher makes itwrite-protected, so games that require writing to the disk will crash orstop with an error.-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 7, Top 21, Msg 12)[EOA][AWT]Anniversary of Wolfenstein 3D"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Happy eight-years-and-one-week anniversary to Wolfenstein 3D!(KGAGNE, Cat 14, Top 5, Msg 23)[EOA][IRA]Interfacing the Roomba Vacuum Cleaner to an Apple II""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Make magazine currently blogs about interfacing a Roomba vacuum cleaner toa computer via a serial cable or a Bluetooth interface adapted via serial.This brings forth a few possibilities for an Apple II:Interfacing the Roomba via serial to an Apple II (using Spectrum scripts tocontrol the vacuum?)orCreating a somewhat limited Bluetooth via serial interface for an Apple II.RyanChief Sysop and head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 17, Top 34, Msg 16)[EOA][SSB]Sweet16 for BeOS""""""""""""""""I spent an hour or so on Sweet16 for Mac OS X tonight, and now I have itpretty much fully usable.

I was able to successfully link (and run) an orca/cversion of "hello world".  Just doing that requires something like 2 dozenfunctions from 2 libraries be linked in.Currently, the biggest missing functionality is:- expressload- dynamic segments/jump tables- more robust error handlingI've been looking into runtime library support as well.  Orca/Linkerdoesn't support them, but apple's linker does (sort of).runtime libraries (rtl) are basically fully compiled and linked code, butthey also have a map of symbol names and the segment/offset where they arestored.  If your program calls a rtl function, it's treated via a jumptable, like dynamic segments.  For most purposes, it's probably better touse a tool rather than a rtl, but they might be better for some purposes.Kelvin.(KWS, Cat 58, Top 2, Msg 24)>>>>>"""""Well, I'm inclined to say that runtime library support is pretty lowpriority.
