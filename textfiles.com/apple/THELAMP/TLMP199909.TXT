It's fun and it's challenging, but it's also noteasy.     The problem is "not easy" is quickly becoming "not possible".  Werecently found out at the hospital at which I work that we were going froma Monday to Friday schedule to a rotational seven day a week coverageschedule.  Theoretically, that means that once every thirteen or so weeks Ineed to work on weekends.  In reality, I've just finished my second weekendof duty in the last three weeks, and I have another coming up in about fourweeks.     In my personal life, this mostly means I miss my Saturday basketballgame and the occasional weekend movie.  In my virtual online life, it meansnot as much time for Spectrum scripting, Delphi chat, and this month, notenough time to finish up _The Lamp!_.     I'm not Doug Cuff or Max Jones, but I'm not happy about being latewith an issue, but this one is late--way late--and this will happen moreand more as long as I keep this job.  Add to that the other things I wantto do--both in computing and out of computing--and it becomes clearer to methat this publication has outgrown me.     The December 1999 issue of _The Lamp!_ will be the last under myeditorship.  I say this with regret, because I have fun doing it, but Ialso know that this will let my baby grow in ways I've never imagined.  Andit will let me do things that I've never been able to do before.     Time for me to fly.  For both of our sakes.                                [*] [*] [*]     I've Got To Set Myself Free Department: Last month featured the firstKFest 2000 Blatant Plug.

Put a couple of drops of lighter fluid""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   (Zippo or Ronsonol) on the label, rubit around with your finger so the label is covered evenly, and let it soakfor a while.This will loosen the adhesive and let you peel the label right off.Slick/glossy labels don't soak up well and tend to peel in layers, leavinga whole bunch of stickum behind. Labels that use water based adhesives donot respond to lighter fluid but will loosen up nicely with glass cleaner.Some labels peel quite nicely without any "assistance" except a fingernail.I've "delabeled" many many hundreds of used disks. It's a real pain in thebutt. After a while you learn to tell by feel (and a little "picking")which labels will peel well and which will not. The best thing to do withthe ones that won't peel well is to simply cover the old label with a blanknew one.Gary R.

Just ason a stock IIgs, telecom applications, and other applications, can use theserial ports to communicate. If you have Marinetti installed, Marinettiaware applications can use it to make TCP/IP connections through the serialports.As gsAIM uses TCP/IP, it requires Marinetti to be installed.Spectrum 2.2 can also optionally use TCP/IP instead of the serial ports, soit also requires Marinetti to be installed if you wish to use the optionalTCP/IP connections.SIS only requires Spectrum. So you can think of it as not directly beingTCP/IP aware, so it does not specifically require Marinetti to operate. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Thu 26 Aug 1999 - 335 days till Y2KFest Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.2 & Crock O' Gold 3.2 Bernie ][ the Rescue 2.0 woofing at 55Mhz on a G3/350 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                        (EWANNOP, 25318, GO COM A2)NON-MAC EMULATION COMES ON THE SCENE   I don't really see a PC/Mac problem""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   here. After all we're interested inApple IIs. That is all that counts and nothing else. It doesn't depend whatother systems you are using.It is correct that PCs and maybe Macs have been flamed here before, howeverI don't think by regulars so this should be dealt with in a professionalmanner as background noise.IMHO it is the most unimportant thing in a public discussion what platformyou're using at home and to try to persuade others of its benefits. I dochoose my computers out of personal preference, and others do so as welland might end up with something different. So what! I'm not getting paid by<insert company name> for doing platform promo. (Sheppy's mileage may vary*grin*) As long as you don't take my <insert model> away, I'm happy.I'm convinced Delphi A2 regulars have the potential of getting alongwithout platform wars. And, nobody should feel offended when a discussionfocuses on a different CPU. There are other threads that are more on topicand I care even less about. And my last point in a drivel that got too longis: when you're missing a discussion about, let's say, emulation on a PC,then it's simply because nobody started such a thread. Be part of thesolution.Henrik Woof Gudat                        (GUDATH, 24701, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I'm very open that I use my PC as my main machine at home.

Buy a faster PC and get faster IIgs. TheseDual 450's are quickly dropping in price... And with >20 gig drivesstarting to cost less than $500, you can have a whole heck of a lot of IIgshard drive images (and be able to back up an entire hard drive image injust seconds!!).I don't have the hardware to do a presentation for Kfest, but I cancertainly answer any questions about KEGS--it basically runs like any otherIIgs emulator.Geoff                       (SISGEOFF, 24842, GO COM A2)MORE MARINETTI   I have 2 ISPs.""""""""""""""On one, when I connect with Marinetti, there are problems with the nameserver. I never have come up with a satisfactory fix for that, although ithelps to log in with Marinetti and then launch Spectrum, rather than tryingto launch Spectrum and then use the Spectrum menu commands. It must be atiming issue, because this is the same ISP that gives me similar problemswith my Mac. It works better for me, regardless of what the cause is, tolog in with FreePPP on the Mac with my setup requiring me to enter thepassword each time.My second ISP, which I use for my OLRight! activities, has never given me asuccessful PPP login with Marinetti. SLIP works beautifully, however.Again, try to get some Trumpet Winsock scripts from your ISP, and translatethem to a Marinetti script. It just may work.My login problems with ISP #1 may be nothing more than a bad phone line. Iam too far out in the country, and my phone wiring may be partially fried.I have had lightning destroy two modems in the past year (components blownoff the boards, conductors melted, metal vaporized and replated onto theinside of the case). One of my Round Tuits is to replace the interior phonewire in the house.Bottom line - you are not alone, but keep plugging!Don V.

I don't"""""   know where that came from.The PPP module which comes with Marinetti does not support CHAP, which isan automated logon protocol. Most ISPs should provide the PAP protocolhowever, which Marinetti's PPP module does support.Also, some ISPs use a form of PPP which requires compression. The MarinettiPPP module does not support compression. However, it is the ISPs who are toblame, because the PPP standard says that all implementations MUST providecompression as optional, not mandatory.A solution to both of these problems is to get an ISP who uses stableprotocols, or use scripted SLIP.Marinetti itself will work with any ISP which a link layer module canconnect to.As for your DNS problem, it looks like you've had various DNS numbers givento you over the years. You should go back to the Mac and provide the sameDNS number for every dialog which asks for it.In Marinetti, you use this same number for the primary DNS. You may leavethe secondary field blank if you like, Marinetti just uses this if theprimary fails for some reason.Regards, Richard                       (RICHARD_B, 24706, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I was able to do some testing at KFest with DNS and Spectrum, and"""""   my conclusion is that there may be a bug in Spectrum in regards toDNS.

I've also received the correct DNSnumbers and am using them in FreePPP, having also set up Marinetticorrectly.However, I'm having trouble getting online. Setting the connection type toPPP results in the modem talking for a few seconds while "negotiating PPPoptions" and then disconnecting. I figure PPP Scripted is the way to go butI don't know how to use IP and SETIP... I've never seen an IP numberdisplayed in the input buffer when manually connecting.Also, I noticed that after Marinetti's attempt to get online, the Spectruminput buffer is never displayed. I've correctly initialized my modem butwherever I dial, nothing is displayed in the online display. Not modemcommands, connect messages, input... I think this may be related to mytrouble getting Marinetti to WAIT for incoming data.Finally, where can I find the Marinetti FAQ?Thanks,-Ken                       (KEN_GAGNE, 24964, GO COM A2)>>>>>   If you have Spectrum 2.2 set to TCP/IP mode, Spectrum will only"""""   display data that is correctly received and passed throughMarinetti.

The reason is that some strong supporters have certain messagesin their signatures that are triggering an Easter Egg and Bernie startsbarking.While it was intended as a fun feature, it can impact reliability of aserial connection on slower Macs.I have uploaded a special, debarked version for the Delphi audience to: {<http://www.magnet.ch/emutech/dogdebarked.sit.hqx>http://www.magnet.ch/emutech/dogdebarked.sit.hqx}The archive only includes the application - it does not come with anyauxiliary files. The Easter Egg will return in the next release with somemodifications. :-)Happy surfing,Henrik Woof Gudatwoof woof                        (GUDATH, 25146, GO COM A2)>>>>>   The symptom that I saw running ANSITerm is that Bernie would bark"""""   while text was being received through the serial port. It seemed asthough every time Bernie barked, I lost a block of text. I can now run a9600 baud modem-to-remote connection, as long as the Serial port-to-modemconnection is run as fast as possible (57600 baud). The 9600 baud rate ishigher than Henrik expected I should be able to achieve with my system :^)I would like to publicly thank Henrik for the great customer support!Some issues running ANSITerm under Bernie, that to me are probably notBernie's fault:1) On my system, ANSITerm does _NOT_ like running with Virtual Memory   active. I get frequent crashes of ANSITerm (not Bernie) when trying to   save a file from the editor, especially during a script. The visual   symptom is that the screen is trashed just before ANSITerm would have   displayed a dialog (the 'save' dialog that displays the file name, I   think). The situation is vastly improved (although not entirely solved)   by using RamDoubler 8 instead of Virtual Memory (or running without any   memory extending program active).2) ANSITerm _seems_ to run better for me using a ROM 01 image rather than   one for a ROM 3. YMMV3) ANSITerm _seems_ to run better for me by booting directly into Prodos-8   rather than launching ANSITerm from GSOS. YMMV4) This is a Mac issue, not a Bernie issue: I have been unable to get   Carrier Detect to work either from the internal modem on my PowerBook or   an external modem/cable that I use with my 'real' GS. This creates a   potential problem with modem initialization if you (like me) have   ANSITerm set to NOT initialize the modem on startup if Carrier is   detected. I sometimes like to drop out of ANSITerm to do something else   while online, and then restart ANSITerm and continue my online session.5) It appears from the Bernie docs that DTR must be set to 'ignore' for   hardware handshaking to work. This will disable ANSITerm's 'hangup'   command, either from Command-H or in scripts. The alternative is to   issue the '+++' command followed by 'ATH'. I haven't tested this; I have   simply adjusted by behaviors and scripts to accommodate 'DTR Ignore'.All that said, it appears to me that ANSITerm is somehow affected by whatelse is going on in the system other than Bernie, and this specifically canaffect the file save function. While there may be something that could bedone within Bernie to help, the problems I have been experiencing can beminimized by adjusting my system configuration. It may, of course, also bea bug within ANSITerm...I am still learning how to use my Mac (a PowerBook 1400) so there may besomething I am missing in all this. Suggestions welcome.Don V.

I was looking out the window for a real dog the first few times I heard it though. :)"Apparently the PowerBook 1400 that I have is right on the hairy edge fortrying to run communications with Bernie. I could run 2400 baud, but anyattempt to reduce the connection speed with my modem (I didn't have amanual, just the few commands listed in the 'help' screen) to a speedbetween 2400 and 9600 required me to also reduce the serial port-to-modemspeed. I'm still a bit dim-witted about exactly what is happening betweenthe communications port, Bernie, and the modem. However, the key on a slowmachine like mine seems to me to be to 'pull' data from Bernie faster thanthe modem is feeding data to Bernie. When I simply reduced the serial portspeed to get a lower modem-to-remote speed, it didn't really accomplishmuch. Running a marginal setup, the barking seemed to divert Bernie fromthe task at hand just enough to cause data loss. Also, I wonder if the'debarked' Bernie is just a tad more efficient because it has one lessprocess running (detecting the 'woof').At about the same time that Henrik so kindly provided a 'debarked' Bernie,I also figured out that my modem has a Rockwell chipset. I was thereforeable to use the reasonably good manual from another modem (RIP - Hit bylightning) to initialize the modem to make a connection only between 300baud and 9600 baud, while running the port speed at 57600. This incombination with the 'debarking' gives me no data loss at 9600 baud.Don V.

Itdoesn't directly have anything to do with carrier detect. I haven'texperimented with it, but I would guess that this approach might not besuitable for use with Bernie, which is why the &D0 setting seems to workbetter."What I do know is that ANSITerm doesn't properly handle carrier detect on Bernie, nor will it recognize or initialize my modem, while Spectrum does. I can dial manually (via ATD commands) but I can't use the dial list.

What is probably happening is thatyou have it set to 'Don't Initialize', which means that when you havecarrier all the time in Bernie, the modem never gets initialized. 'Promptfirst' allows you to start up with carrier and decide whether to initializethe modem, and also to use the dial menu with carrier detected. It evenworks when starting up with a script.Don V.

However, the challenge is to make your way without all thesehelps. <grin>The game offers you up to 10 levels of difficulty.It is available here in the database under the name maze.bxy or on my website at http://www.iglou.com/qwerty/kb/dlfiles.html#18.Try it, you might be surprised at how addicting it can become.Charlie Hartley                       (CKHARTLEY, 24756, GO COM A2)HOW DO I GET A LASERWRITER TO PRINT THE TEST PAGE (OR NOT)   I believe this""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   is thepostscript code that will turn the test page *on*-- cut here --% After this file is sent, the start page will be printed every time% the printer is turned on or reset.%% Wrap function with startjob to make the change persistent.systemdict/languagelevel known{languagelevel 2 eq{true (0) startjob dup not{/exitserver errordict/invalidaccess getexec}if}{false}ifelse}{false}ifelsenot {quit} ifmark{  2 dict begin    /Password (0) def    /DoStartPage true def  currentdict end setsystemparams} stopped cleartomarkfalse (0) startjob pop-- cut here --Send using LaserBeam on the GS, or copy it to the serial port from a PC.The easy way is to use the Apple Laserwriter Utility on a Macintosh, whichhas a menu item that will enable/disable the start page.To turn the startup page *off* again, change the /DoStartPage to false.Shawn                       (STBEATTIE, 24806, GO COM A2)HOW DO I GET SILVERN CASTLE USING GWFTP?

Mapped out most of level 1 the first night.Second night I realized I'd need a thief to open the chests, so now I'mworking with 4 dwarf fighters, 1 elf cleric, and 1 hobbit thief. For thenext two nights I mapped out levels 1-3 with this group.Now I've got level 5-6 characters and I can survive levels 1-3 with notrouble, unless I get ambushed by a large group containing spell casterswho can put me to sleep. Ouch, that can get ugly. I think it's time tocreate a mage now so I can optimize my group. I prefer 3 fighters, 1 thief,1 mage, 1 cleric.

Here'sa complete list:o Added CPU Core panel to preferences. This contains the Memory settings,  now as a slider control that lets you choose any size from 1 to 8 MB, on  1 MB boundaries -- take control of your memory!o The sound amplitude scaling (volume decreasing as more oscillators are in  use) is less severe now, so that music doesn't play back at volumes too  low to hear.o Added a Sound panel to the preferences. This contains an option to play  all sounds as mono (through both speakers instead of assuming apps are  playing sound in stereo), and to turn off the amplitude scaling  completely.o Added some additional error handling to physical disk management code.o When you pause the emulator, the video display is dimmed.o The Joystick preference panel has been cleaned up to look better.o Improved and tightened up code for future development work.o Added speed control. You can now specify, from 1 to 14 MHz, the speed of  "Fast" speed. You can also disable speed control to let the emulator run  all-out (this is the default).o Sweet16 now emulates the ZipGS accelerator, so you can have finer control  over the speed when speed control is on. This is optional; you can  disable the Zip support.o Added caching of physical floppy disks (1.4 MB and smaller). Reads are  always cached; writes are cached if you enable the write cache in the  Disk preference panel. Write caching causes disk writes to be queued up  and handled in a background thread. I love multithreaded operating  systems!o Sweet16 now correctly senses the write-protect state of physical disks.o The IIgs mouse is more responsive now.o You can now format physical disks in Sweet16, using IIgs software.o Fixed the hires graphics mode on x86 systems.You can find the complete Sweet16 manual online at{<http://www.sheppyware.net/software/sweet16_be/manual/>http://www.sheppyware.net/software/sweet16_be/manual/} and you can downloadthe software at {<http://www.sheppyware.net/software/sweet16_be/>http://www.sheppyware.net/software/sweet16_be/.} Current Sweet16 usersdon't need to pay to upgrade to version 1.1.Enjoy!---Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                        (SHEPPY, 25074, GO COM A2)>>>>>   FWIW, _Ernie_ under BeOS is faster than _Bernie_ under MacOS on the"""""   same Mac.

I found thesection in the Orca/C manual how to call the C function so I'm set withthat.The problem is during the linking. I'm getting Unresolved reference Labelerrors for each C function that the assembly code is referencing. I amguessing that I have no idea how to tell the assembly code the labels areto be found in the C code.I have the assembly routines in one file, lets call it prog.asm. I have theC functions in another file, lets call it funcs.cc.What I did was this:assemble prog.asmcompile funcs.cclink prog funcs keep=progI was hoping the linking would magically figure out the labels, but thatdidn't work. I'm not finding anything in the manuals that is helping me.Geoff                      (SISGEOFF, 2746, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Keep in mind that this is a great way to crash the computer if you"""""   forget to initialize the C environment. The C libraries, and insome cases even the code generated by the compiler, depend on an orderlyinitialization of certain registers, global variables, and tools. If youdon't do that and use a function or instruction that depends oninitialization, you're asking for trouble.The easiest way to set things up is to start the program from C, then callyour main assembly language routine from main(). You can find specificstartup information for roll-your-own startups in the C release notes.Mike Westerfield                      (BYTEWORKS, 2749, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Just a wild guess here, since I'm at work and can't look it up, but"""""   do you have the case directive on in ORCA/M?

Add "CASE ON" to your assembly source"""""   at the top of the file; ORCA/M normally assembles with all labelsconverted to upper-case, but ORCA/C is case-sensitive, so you need to turnon case-sensitive assembling so the labels match.---Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                       (SHEPPY, 2748, GO COM A2PRO)WHAT HAPPENS WITH DESIGNMASTER?

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.          [thelamp@sheppyware.net]                         Basic Spectrum Scripting                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Welcome back to Scripting & Macros.  Our lesson for today will dealwith one of the most plain-English scripting languages there is--thescripting language included in the wonderful _Spectrum_ telecommunicationsprogram.     _Spectrum_'s scripting language is exceptionally powerful--forinstance, both _Crock O' Gold_ and _Spectrum Internet Suite 1.0_ arecompletely written in the _Spectrum_ scripting language.  At the same time,the language is so easy to use that anyone can write a _Spectrum_ script.     Reviewing our previous _S&M_ article, let's take a look at writing ascript to do a simple job: log you onto Delphi.     Whether you telnet into Delphi or connect via Sprintnet or Tymenet,you can use at least part of this scripting exercise for your ownscript--and you can always use the knowledge you gain for all kinds ofother things.     You can use any text editor (including the built-in one in _Spectrum_)to write your script.  I prefer to use _Hermes_ by Bright Software, nowknown as F.E. Systems, who have a Macintosh program we've noted herebefore.     Let's take a look at what Delphi looks like when we first connect toit:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN SHOT]-------------------------------------------------Username:[END OF SCREEN SHOT]-------------------------------------------------------     So, the first thing we need to do is wait for the characters making up"Username:" (or, more efficiently, something shorter, like "name:") show upon the screen.  We do this in Spectrum with one of its most basic commands:"WaitFor String".     _Spectrum_ author Ewen Wannop is proud of the fact that the _Spectrum_scripting language very closely resembles English.  Looking at the "WaitForString" command, the "WaitFor" part is self-explanatory.  "String"represents a "string" of text characters.  So, we're waiting for a "string"of text--in this case, the string are the characters "name:"  So the firstcommand we want to give in our script is:WaitFor String "name:"     After our script detects the characters name:, we need for it to sendour username to Delphi.  For this we use the "Transmit" command.  In thiscase, we simply transmit our username, followed by a return.  A return inthe _Spectrum_ scripting language, like many others, is a control-Mcharacter, designated by "^M".  So our script now looks like this:WaitFor String "name:"Transmit "username^M"     If we were to run this script on connecting to Delphi, this is what wewould get:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN SHOT]-------------------------------------------------Username: usernamePassword:[END OF SCREEN SHOT]-------------------------------------------------------     So we next need to add a line to our script to wait for the string"Password:" or, for short, "word:".  Our script now looks like this:WaitFor String "name:"Transmit "username^M"WaitFor String "word:"     After we get the "word:" string, we then want to send our password.So, using the "Transmit" command again, we add in a line to transmit ourpassword.  Our script now looks like this:WaitFor String "name:"Transmit "username^M"WaitFor String "word:"Transmit "password^M"     If we want to end our script here, we can add a command to stop thescript (this command is not necessary, although it is good form).  Ourfinalized script looks like this:WaitFor String "name:"Transmit "username^M"WaitFor String "word:"Transmit "password^M"Stop Script     Save this script.  If you run this script once you are connected toDelphi (and unless you use _Spectrum_'s ability to you may have to bereally fast since the "Username:" prompt comes up quickly), you will beautomatically logged in.  No more typing in usernames and passwords!     This just barely scratches the surface of what is possible with_Spectrum_, but it ought to be more than enough to get you going.  We willlook more in depth at the possibilities of scripting languages when wepublish our next installment.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :           Acid test?
