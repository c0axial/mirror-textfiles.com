Thoughts turn to times past From Down on the Farm...                From Down on the Farm - The Threshing Ring                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The huge cylinders of the kerosene engine of the tractor barkloudly... transferring its mighty power to the threshing machine... two menare pitching bundles of grain precisely on to the conveyor... the knivescutting the twine on each bundle as it enters the machine... the cylinderthreshing the kernels of grain from the heads of the grain bundles... theshaking racks separating the kernels from the straw... the kernels of grainmoving to a wagon... the straw blower creating a giant stack of straw.     A dozen or so farmers have banded together to form a "threshing ring".All of them cooperate to harvest their wheat, oats, barley and flax.  Thereis plenty of work for all.     Men are loading bundles on horse drawn hay racks to take the place ofthe men pitching bundles into the threshing machine when their wagons areempty.  A young boy levels the grain in the wagon receiving the kernels ofgrain.  The machine must be adjusted.  The straw blower adjusted.  Thetractor refueled.  The kernels of grain hauled to the granary... the graintransferred to the storage bins.     Then at 12 noon this all comes to a stop as everyone heads to the farmhouse for dinner.  The women and girls have been busy preparing hugequantities of food to feed those hungry, hard working men.  Roast beef,roast pork, or fried chicken.  Piles of mashed potatoes.  Hugh bowls ofgravy.  Fresh baked bread with home made butter.  Peas, corn, pickles.Large pieces of pie.     The threshing ring was more than a means of harvesting grain... it wasa social function for all the farm families involved.

In the recent MacAddict article, DSL beat cable hands down, butthat was a particularly bad cable company. I think as DSL matures, it'sadvantages will grow, but for now, it's showing growing pains. It seems theonly reliable providers are the old local phone companies, and they don'talways offer it. Distance limitations are a serious drawback, until waysare found to extend the loop.Cable is more available, and if managed well, is an excellent alternative.It's generally, but not always, cheaper than DSL and if loops are lightlyloaded, faster than the slowest DSL, and almost as fast as the next DSLlevel, which is fast becoming the basic DSL.

Now being re-introduced in thecontext of full-featured Apple IIGS emulators and high-performance PowerMacintosh portables, GS+ Magazine will reacquaint former IIGSenthusiasts/developers with the wonder and power of programming in theirown computing environment. More importantly, new Apple IIGS users will beintroduced to a suite of useful and fun applications and utilities, as wellas a very capable and friendly computing platform.The re-release of the entire GS+ collection will include a limited numberof authentic original hard-copy back issues as well as a new and innovativedistribution model. Through special arrangement with EGO Systems (theoriginal publisher), the new distributions will be complete, in theoriginal layout, with the original software.Syndicomm, a leader in the Apple II community, has devoted the time andtalent necessary to provide developers and enthusiasts alike with a uniqueforum to share knowledge and resources. It is a place where legendary IIGSprogrammers may influence and interact with ongoing IIGS developmentefforts."I am extremely pleased that Syndicomm has received exclusive rights todistribute GS+ magazine and that this publication will continue to beassociated with such dedicated members of the IIGS community," said Mr.Falconer. "I am confident in the high quality and professionalism whichSyndicomm lends to its efforts, and that new developers and enthusiastsalike will find the entire GS+ compilation to be entertaining, informative,and collectible."Mr. Shepherd added, "Syndicomm is thrilled to be bringing these mostsought-after products back to the Apple II community after several years'absence.

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.[thelamp@sheppyware.net]                         The KFest FAQ Version 3.0                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The following article is set up in a form commonly seen on theInternet, called Frequently Asked Questions.  It is designed to answer someof the most common questions people have about KansasFest, the Apple IIevent of the year.  It is not designed to answer general questions aboutthe Apple II, although there may be some overlap.     Any questions about this article can be sent via email tothelamp@sheppyware.netQ: What's a FAQ, and how is it pronounced?A: The letters "FAQ" stand for _F_requently _A_sked _Q_uestions.  Whenpeople first hear of or learn of a subject, such as KansasFest, they oftenhave a number of questions which others before them did when they alsofirst learned of the same subject.  A FAQ is a document listing both thequestions and answers most frequently associated with new users, to savethemselves (and others trying to assist them) time and frustration.And by the way, it's pronounced "fack", nearly identical to "fact".Q: What is the purpose of this FAQ?A: This FAQ is set up to assist people interested in KansasFest, also knownas KFest.  Many Apple II enthusiasts are interested in attending or justwant some information about this event, so the most common questions areanswered here.Q: How can this FAQ be distributed?A: The content of this FAQ is copyright 1999-2001 by Ryan M. Suenaga, thepublisher of _The Lamp!_.  Distribution without the expressed writtenconsent of the copyright holder is prohibited.Q: What is KFest?A: KansasFest, abbreviated "KFest", is a computing conference held everysummer at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  Its original formal namewas "The Apple II Summer Conference" while its nickname was "KansasFest",which was abbreviated to "KFest".Q: When was the first KFest held?A: The first KansasFest was held in 1989.  It was originally sponsored byResource-Central, the folks who brought you the wonderful _Open-Apple_ and_A2-Central_ (among several other Apple II) publications.  AfterResource-Central became ICON, The Apple II Summer Conference becameICONference.  This lasted one summer until ICON shut down.  Two differentcompanies sponsored KFest before Intrec Software, publishers of _ProTERM_,took over a few years back.  This July will welcome the lucky 13th KFest.Q: When is KFest this year?A: KansasFest 2001 runs from Wednesday through Sunday, July 25-29, 2001.For the second year, KFesters are being offered an extra night, Tuesday,July 24, at the Avila dorms if they want to come into town a day early--andit seems most everyone does.Q: Where is KFest held?A: KFest is held at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  The addressand phone number are:     Avila College     11901 Wornall Road     Kansas City, Missouri  64145     United States of America     (816) 942-8400Q: If it's held in Missouri, why is it called KansasFest?A: I dunno.  If it makes you feel better, the Kansas border is very closeto Avila College.Q: Who comes to KFest?A: While KFest was originally devoted to programmers, nowadays all kinds offolk from all over the world show up at Avila College.  Programmers, users,newsletter publishers, and everyday folk show up from Europe, Canada,Australia, and all over the United States to celebrate the Apple II.Q: Who organizes KFest?A: Currently, KFest is organized by a committee headed by The Grand Gouda,Steve "Godzilla" Gozdziewski, who has taken over from The Big Cheese, CindyAdams.  Cindy remains on the committee.  The scheduling is done by StanMarks.  There are several other folks on the committee as well: JerryCline, Allen Moore, and Max Jones all pitch in.  In addition to those goodfolk on the committee, David Kerwood handles the maintenance of the WorldWide Web site, Devin Reade maintains the email lists, and Eric "Sheppy"Shepherd provides World Wide Web hosting services and organizes HackFest,the programming contest.  KFest is sponsored by Intrec Software.Q: How do I register for KFest?  How much does it cost?A: Depending on when you register, registration prices vary.  If youregister early, you'll get a better deal; if you register early -and-you're a repeat KFester (meaning you've been to KFest within the lastcouple of years), you'll get an even better deal (but at the time of thiswriting, that deadline has passed). Please check the KFest Home Page athttp://www.kfest.org/ for the most current information.Q: Which airport do I fly into and how do I get from there to Avila?A: The major airport nearly everyone flies into is Kansas CityInternational, which goes by the code letters MCI (not KCI, which will getyou to Indonesia).  There's a couple of small commuter airports which arecloser, but unless you're Tony Diaz, you're not likely to use these.Even though MCI is the "closest" major airport, it's still most of anhour's drive from there to Avila, so walking is out of the question and cabfare would be substantial.  Your best bet would be to try and catch a ridewith another KFester who'll be flying in or passing by around the same timeyou'll be arriving.  Carl Knoblock unofficially organizes rides to and fromthe airport.  The best way to get in on the ride planning is to join theKFest email list (information on subscribing is elsewhere in thisdocument).Q: What kind of official activities go on at KFest?A: Officially, there is a keynote speech (this year given by Syndicommowner and prolific Apple II programmer Eric Shepherd), sessions on variouscomputing topics, HackFest, a celebrity roast (_Juiced.GS_ publisher MaxJones is the victim of honor this year), product demonstrations, and avendor fair.Q: What kind of unofficial activities go on at KFest?A: Unofficially, there's been movie outings, pizza nights, Bite The Bagcontests, late night eating at Denny's, and huge groups of folks going toeat huge pieces of beef at K.C. Masterpiece and Jess and Jim's restaurants.Q: Has anyone attended every KFest?A: One person: Tony Diaz of Alltech Electronics.Q: I hear that the Avila College dorm is wired for Ethernet.  Is there away I can access that while I'm there?A: Yes.  In each dorm room in the halls of Avila are two outlets that seemto be phone jacks.  These _aren't_ phone jacks.  They're Ethernet ports--tobe exact, they're RJ-45 connectors that are compatible with 10 Base-TEthernet.  The entire Avila dorm is connected to the Internet this way,making for high speed World Wide Web browsing, electronic mail, and ftpconnections for KansasFesters during their stay!Those bringing their true blue Apple IIs will be needing to go the triedand true modem route aside from LANceGS owners--and even they will needassistance in the form of a router, as the LANceGS does not currentlysupport the required DHCP standard used on Avila's campus--but thoseKFesters who bring Ethernet-capable computers of other platforms can makefull use of these high speed connections.  Let's look at what hardware andsoftware is needed to get this high speed resource working with yournon-Apple II.THE HARDWARE   All Avila provides is the RJ-45 jack.  This looks like an""""""""""""   overgrown RJ-11 jack (the kind your telephone plugs into),and in fact, it's a close relative.  What you need to bring is a computerwith an appropriate 10 Base-T Ethernet interface and a cable that ends in amale RJ-45 jack.  There are many, many of these cables on the market.  Ifyou are going to purchase one, be sure it's a straight-through class 5cable, not a crossover cable.  Additionally, due to the way the RJ-45 jackis mounted, you will need a cable ending with a RJ-45 male jack that is notmolded with a surrounding sheath, as the cable will not fit properly.  Youwant a cable end that looks like this:ASCII ART BEGINS      ___________     |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |  <--- Male RJ-45     |   |   |   |     |   |___| <-|------ Locking tab     |           |     |           |     |           |     |___________|       |       |       |       | <------ Cable       |       |as opposed to this:      ___________     |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |  <--- Male RJ-45     |   |   |   |     |   |___| <-|------ Locking tab     |           |     |           |    _|___________|_   |               |   |               |   |               |   |               | <-- Large, molded sheath   |               |   |               |   |_______________|       |       |       |       | <------ Cable       |       |ASCII ART ENDS     I had problems with this at KFest 1998.  If you need to get differentcables (or need other hardware in general) you can ask your fellowattendees if they have extras, or you can run over to the CompUSA in thearea to get what you need.  If someone brings an Ethernet hub, perhaps youcan plug into that instead of into the jack provided by Avila.     Once you have this equipment, simply plug in your RJ-45 cable into theprovided jack.  You do not need an Ethernet hub unless you'll be runningmore than two devices in your room.THE SOFTWARE   The Avila Ethernet server uses a protocol called Dynamic""""""""""""   Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP, for short.  Those ofyou who have set up TCP/IP connections with Windows or Macintosh computers(or, for that matter, the Apple IIgs) probably have some familiarity withinserting IP addresses, DNS addresses, and Gateway addresses.  The beautyof DHCP is that it sets up nearly everything you need dynamically, meaningthat the server assigns these addresses--all you need to do is set upTCP/IP on your computer and choose the DHCP protocol. I am much morefamiliar with the setup of DHCP for Macintosh computers than for Windowsmachines, and am taking the Windows instructions from a reference.MAC   To set up a Macintosh running Open Transport networking for DHCP,'''   all that needs to be done is to switch the TCP/IP protocol to DHCPServer.  So:(1) Get into your TCP/IP Control Panel;(2) Select "Ethernet" (or "Built-in Ethernet" or "Alternate Ethernet" as    appropriate) in the "Connect via:" field;(3) Select "DHCP Server" in the "Configure" field;(4) Quit and save the changes.WINDOWS 95   To set up a Windows 95 machine for DHCP, there are several''''''''''   additional steps:(1) Get into your Network Control panel;(2) Add or select the appropriate Ethernet interface;(3) Set the "Obtain an IP address automatically" control in the "IP    Address" tab of the TCP/IP Properties window;(4) Remove any existing setting for a Gateway address in the "Gateway" tab    of the TCP/IP Properties window;(5) Disable DNS in the "DNS Configuration" tab of the TCP/IP Properties    window;(6) Save the settings and reboot the computer.     Regardless of which platform you use, if you have software set up toshare your hard drive with other computers, you probably ought to disableit--unless you like everyone in the Avila Ethernet having access to yourfiles.     At this point, you ought to be connected.  If you previously had anyproxy servers set up for use with your setup before Avila, disable them.You ought to have easy access for checking mail, browsing the Web, or usingfile transfer protocol--and very high speeds.  One last caveat:THE SMTP SERVER   As Spam on the Internet proliferates, it has become"""""""""""""""   accepted practice to close off an Internet ServiceProvider's mail sending server--usually using Simple Mail TransferProtocol, or smtp--to access from anyone who is not directly connected tothe ISP.  In other words, no one wants to be a relaying point for Spam.     Because of this, it's likely you will not be able to use the same smtpserver you use at home to send mail while at Avila.  There is, however, amail.avila.edu smtp server that can be used while at Avila.  That ought tokeep your email flowing freely.Q: How can I learn more about KFest?A: You can get more information on KansasFest by visiting the KansasFestWorld Wide Web site at http://www.kfest.org/ or sending email tokfest-help@kfest.org.  You could also subscribe to the KFest mailing listby sending email to majordomo@kfest.org.

Ok, everyone mightknow that already BUT there is another thing you should also consider ifyou haven't yet registered.Avila College has only guaranteed us a fixed number of rooms and most havebeen taken already. In the past Avila has been able to give us a few morerooms but that might not be the case this year. It's their call and if theyhave other groups on campus at the same time we may not be able to getadditional rooms:(After all you've already planned don't miss out on KFest 2001 because youregistered too late!(KFESTSTEVE, Cat 5, Top 3, Msg 84)[EOA][KFM]K-Fest MEMORIES"""""""""""""""I've had chiggers every year I've been to KFest. I know to stay off thegrass, but I can't stay away from that swing. :)Cindy(CINDYADAMS, Cat 5, Top 10, Msg 5)>>>>>"""""One of my favorite KFest memories is the last KFest Burger Bill attended,with Weird Al music blaring and a few of us singing along at the tops ofour lungs.  '96, I think it was.Eric 'Sheppy' ShepherdOwnerSyndicommBuilding communities bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 5, Top 10, Msg 6)>>>>>"""""Funny moment from KFest 2000: waking up at 6 am to use the bathroom,opening the door, and having about 200 5.25 inch floppy disks comecascading down at my feet.Well, after I made it to the bathroom, slept another hour, ate what passedfor breakfast, and got some caffeine, it was funny :-)RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 5, Top 10, Msg 7)>>>>>"""""I enjoyed making s'mores on the gas grills. It was a little unconventional,but I couldn't figure out where else we could have a campfire.It all started in the RTC on GEnie when we were trying to explain toRichard Bennett about s'mores. He figured out marshmallows and Hersheybars, but graham crackers were something we couldn't quite explain. Thedifferences between cookies, crackers, biscuits, and digestives got lost inthe "English translation".Richard was the KFest roastee that year. So after he was done beingroasted, we all went out onto the patio and roasted marshmallows and hads'mores. I hope everyone else enjoyed this "campfire" treat as much as Idid.Cindy(CINDYADAMS, Cat 5, Top 10, Msg 13)>>>>>"""""One of my favorite KFest moments was in 1996, my first KFest, when GregTempleman tried to explain the algorithm theory he was applying to a newpiece of movie software he was attempting to write. ... at 3 o'clock in themorning.  Heck, I wouldn't have been able to understand what he was sayingeven if I had been wide awake. :-)MaxP.S. There have been so many great KFest moments for me, I could compile alist that would last for days. I'll spare you all those details, except tomention that one of them includes an episode when Howard Katz and Iunwisely let Ryan Suenaga drive to the airport. :-0!!!!(JUICEDGS, Cat 5, Top 10, Msg 11)>>>>>"""""Max, if you remember, Ryan ended up NOT driving to the airport.  I thinkthat's the proper way of phrasing that little incident.

Getting lost in downtown KC, searchingfrantically for the outer interstate loop, then, just when it seemed wewould actually find our destination, Ryan, while cruising in heavy trafficat 70 mph, saying, matter-of-factly, "hmmmmm, my eyes are watering, I can'tsee!!"Seems as though Ryan was having an allergic reaction to mainland airpollutants. He managed to pull off to the side of the interstate and swapvehicle positions with Howard. It was an interesting ride. :-)MaxP.S. We found the airport, picked up Greg Templeman, and got back to KCMasterpiece, where I then met a series of Apple folks I had been readingabout for years: Sheppy, Burger Bill, Michael Lutynski, James Smith, TimKellers, etc. I was star-struck!!(JUICEDGS, Cat 5, Top 10, Msg 15)>>>>>"""""Another thing I enjoyed about my KFest experience: one evening a bunch ofus were taking the night air (and adult beverages) out in front of the dormwhen some rambunctious students broke a window right in front of us.
