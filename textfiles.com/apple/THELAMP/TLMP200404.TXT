It is geared, rather, toward the computer'srole in individual learning.  It is not of the pedagogical kind of learningfostered by its ability to connect to the Internet or run math drills thatI speak.  It is of the computer as the object of learning, as itself averitable fountain of knowledge.  We begin with the authors inspiration forthis topic of the computer as an object of learning, examine problems withmodern operating systems in an educational light, and conclude with avision and a hope for the future.MY FIRST COMPUTERIn April, 1983, my parents bought an Apple IIe system for $2,300.  I didn'tthink much of it at the time, being embroiled in music.  The oohs and ahssubsided, and by May, I was the only one using this esoteric contraption.My cousins came to Houston to spend that summer with us.  The computerbecame a big hit with them.  One cousin and I teamed up on Bolo, with ustaking turns having one man the gun and the other drive, humming the themeto Star Wars during the more intense moments while flying through the mazebeing chased by angry enemies.  The oldest girl preferred more intellectualpursuits and enjoyed spending time on Zork.  I was always attracted to thegraphical programs, however, and wanted to make my own early on.One day in June, after some rough play with the kids outside, I came in towork through the Applesoft Basic manual my dad and I had begun to study.  Ityped in one of the commands, GR, and the screen did something funny.After some more reading, I had a colored brick on the screen!  That was anextremely exciting moment for me.  Later, I ebulliently one-upped thatachievement and had a hires dot, and then a line.  Little did I know at thetime that my passion for programming, the fire ignited that hot Houstonsummer, would be burning yet 21 years hence.  I became obsessed with thatmachine and its inner workings to the point my mother had to hide the cordto force me to go outside and play.  In fact, I managed to make a career ofprogramming (and later with much study and hard work, software engineering)without ever taking a single formal course in Computer Science thanks inlarge part to the open architecture and approachability of the Apple II.The open architecture of the II invited discovery and encouraged learningat an impressionable age...  a trait conspicuously absent from todaysplatforms.  More properly, I owe any skill I may have acquired, myinterests, and my career to the man and men behind the Apple II, andespecially to my parents, who bought their product.Fast forward 21 years: where do we stand today?  Are systems still as openand approachable?BOOT TIMESAs a lead-in to the topic of the computer's role as an object of education,I'd like to make a few observations about the change in boot times asmicrocomputers have evolved.  My Apple IIe boots a typical DOS 3.3  5.25"floppy in approximately 10-15 seconds.  The Apple IIGS, after a brief delayon power-up, boots a modest GSOS from hard disk in about 12 seconds.  AWindows 95 machine running a Pentium II@266MHz drops the user in thedesktop after a 50 second wait.  Finally, my AMD Athlon XP1800 with stripedRAID-0 hard drives requires a whopping two minutes(!).                                              Approx.                             Speed   Bus    Processing   Machine/OS        CPU     (MHz)  (bits)    Factor       Drive      Time-----------------   -----    -----  ------  ----------  -----------  -----Apple IIe/DOS 3.3   65C02      1       8        1X      5.25 Floppy  00:15*Apple IIGS/GSOS     65816     7.5    8/16      12X       Hard Disk   00:12Pentium II Win95    K6-II     266     32      1500X      Hard Disk   00:50AMD Athlon Win2K     K7      1533     32     8000+X      RAID-0 HD   01:55                                                                  *(varies)Anyone old enough to remember Highlights Magazine inevitably recalls the"What's wrong?" pictures.  Can you spot a problem with the picture above?Do you see the abnormality: the faster machines become, the longer theytake to boot (and perform other things, but here we focus on boot times).The first and most obvious answer is that the operating systems have grownmore complex over time.  Precisely.  And it is my contention we've reacheda point of critical mass beyond which this attribute becomes a deficitrather than an asset.  Think about it:  Can modern operating systems, nay,must modern operating systems require 67,000 times the boot time processingof the humble Apple DOS 3.3?  A far more practical question is this:  Doyou, the user, get 67,000 times the value over your Apple II?  100 times?Even 10 times (be honest, now)?  Whence arises this odd, inverserelationship between processing power and boot times?  While a simple,monolithic blanket answer will not suffice, we'll explore a few morenuanced ones here.DELINEATION OF PROBLEMS WITH MODERN OS'S AS PERTAINS TO DISCOVERY,LEARNING, AND EXPLORATION The following is by no means an exhaustive compilation of the problems thatplague modern computers, software, or users.  It is merely intended to givethe reader a flavor for attributes that serve as both weaknesses andimpediments to learning from the computer.  The real irony: Most of theattributes listed are almost universally considered strengths of sounddesign in both hardware and software.AbstractionFirst, it would not be unreasonable to surmise the highprocessing-to-valuable-output ratio of modern machines has something to dowith layer piled upon layer of software abstraction to the hardware, withmore attention often paid to theory than to pragmatic engineeringsolutions.  Evidence for this deduction can be found, for example, in thewide array of graphics and sound cards available for the PC, to say nothingof the many motherboards and other low-level hardware devices.  This bringsus to our second problem: modularity.Modularitymodularity is usually spoken of in favorable terms in most pursuits, andespecially in computing disciplines.  Indeed, ask any maintenanceprogrammer and you'll find it can be a valuable trait to have in largesoftware systems.  However: _the need to support the many differentpossible types of hardware implicit in a modular architecture hasnecessitated an almost crippling level of abstraction and contingency codein the operating systems of today!_  Have you ever heard of (so-called)plug-and-play?  One concomitant of this complexity, when combined withautomated frameworks like plug-and-play intended to make the user's lifeeasier, is the unintentional installation of sometimes many drivers ofvarious flavors for the either the same or a different device.  Forexample:  Billy goes over to Joe's house to play Quake.  He brings hisjoystick along.  When he leaves, Joe has a new driver installed that hewill almost never use (except when Billy comes over).  Worse, he may evenhave a deadweight background process hanging around at all times, eating upRAM and CPU cycles.  Multiply cases like this, add in the enormous volumeof programmatic trash from Web installations, shake for one minute and stirtwice and you have a first-class mess on your hands.Viewed in a purely hardware context, modular systems have the communalproperty of each part being replaceable by a similar part with the sameinputs and outputs but with internal variations.  Such systems have theeconomic advantage of fostering competition among hardware vendors whilemaintaining the same software operation for a given type of unit regardlessof variant.  Overdone, however, modularity leads to brittleness: to make achange to an interface to, say, a graphical device (VGA card in PCparlance) means a host of changes to the interface abstraction's internalsare necessary to satisfy all the underlying hardware units.  Thus, you havethe highly-piled layering mentioned in Abstraction above and you end upwith an enormous amount of processing needed to perform a very simple task,for example, plotting a dot to a screen - something a nine-year-old wouldalmost certainly find hopeless without the aid of a special, and expensive,software development package.  You are talking about writing a certain byteto a certain memory location: WHY SHOULD THAT COST 10s OR 100s OR DOLLARS?Worse yet, having such a package impedes our 9-year-olds learning by hidingfrom him the details - which concept, by the way, is very highly regardedin the software world as a property of modularity.  Do you want your kidremaining ignorant in the name of sound object-oriented or modular theory?No!  There will be a time to learn about that.  However, childhood  whencreativity, enthusiasm, and the spirit of exploration is at an all timehigh - is NOT that time.  Childhood is NOT the time to squash creativity inthe name of favor-of-the-week theories.Today's machines are not only inefficient, but discourage learning anddiscovery.  Some children  and adults - may not be satisfied with just theInternet.  Some children may want to know a little about the machine_enabling them to connect_ to the Internet.  And that is no longerpossible.Modularity's opposite is organicity.  The adjective organic refers to theliving and implies the inseparability of parts from the whole.  In contrastto modularity, organicity emphasizes wholeness and interconnectivitybetween individual components, or organs.  The whole is the sum of theparts, as one's arm is a part of the body and may not be switched andswapped at will.  Each organic element has a very special design, relatedto its role in the interconnected whole.  It is possible to think of anorganic system as a single large module, with each part knowing about theothers, instead of a collection thereof.  While organic systems may not bepicked apart piece by piece without disabling the function of the whole,they do have the advantage of each part being able to make safe assumptionsabout the others.  In a computing context, this means an altogetherelimination of the need for complex and expensive abstraction layers,enabling software to go directly to the hardware. The Apple II is anexcellent example of an organic system:  The graphics were tied, forexample, to the memory refresh and saved cost on the original design.Unfortunately, this also proved a weakness as technology advanced, butcertainly not an insurmountable one.  It allowed for the very openness onthe hardware level that set this legendary machine apart from all othermicrocomputers built before or since, to this day.SecurityThe realities of the connectivity afforded by the Internet in conjunctionwith human nature necessitate the ability to secure one's privateinformation from prying eyes.  It is not, however, of this type ofpeer-to-peer security that we speak.Code-level security, in the form of page faulting and exception handlingproducing the inability to look at arbitrary memory, has weakened users'ability to learn about the computer, to debug programs (virtually unheardof anymore, as we seem to insist on keeping users "in the dark"), or learnhow things work.  Insofar as most machines store their data on a singlecentralized repository medium in the form of a hard drive, this is somewhatjustified, but not completely - there are other ways besides this toprotect persistent data.Some vendors simply want to keep their code private.  But this, too, in anage when open source solutions are gaining in popularity, rings hollow.Moreover, if a dishonest (and competent) someone is determined to stealcode and is willing to expend the effort necessary to disassemble andinterpret it, this person will eventually achieve his or her goal.System-level security is appropriate in some settings - banks, for example,don't want tellers snooping customer ATM PIN numbers.  It is notappropriate, however, in our context, in which we are evaluating thecomputer as a learning tool.  That system must be kept as open as possible,and invite prying eyes - not to pry account numbers, but knowledge thatwill help them learn and grow and inspire them to become something otherthan video-game addicted mind-numbed couch potatoes.  The Apple II doesprecisely that: Call -151.QualityThe final problem with today's machines is quality.  Herein lies a paradoxwith cost - one of the modern PCs greatest strengths.  However, withsubstandard hardware being produced in mass levels by underpaid laborers,poor quality has irked almost every user of a modern computer system atsome point.To its credit, one thing of which Apple, at least historically, may not beaccused is producing shoddy-quality products.  The author uses his AppleIIGS daily and even still fires up the now 21-year-old Apple IIe onoccasion.  The only current problem is with the latter - an op-ampcomplicity in joystick reads sits in a loose socket that will eventuallyneed to be desoldered and replaced.  The only other problems he has had iswhen a 74F323 chip on the Disk II controller burned up 14 years ago, andwhen a transistor array DIP in one of his Disk IIs went out, disabling thedrive's write capability - which happened twice.  That is about it - reallynot bad for 21 years of sometimes extremely heavy use.We could continue and discuss scope - trying to please everyone - and manyother causes of the apparent sloth of machines running with incrediblememory capacity processing capability, and throughput, to say nothing ofcovering post-boot activities, but the point has been well established.Other Peeves with MacWinUxWhen the user says jump, you (the computer) don't say, just a minute, I'min the middle of something.   You don't even say, How high?.  You jump...NOW!  Such was the Apple IIs Reset response.  Of course, without thecomplexity of a huge and monolithic OS, its quite possible many of thecases wherein you would NEED to forcibly hard-reset the machine would beeliminated.  Likewise, when the user types three dots, you (the machine)don't automatically convert them to another character: A) what purpose doesthis serve?  B) If the user wants a specific character, she will specifysuch.  When the user says to save a plain-jane document in its original,plain-jane format, you (the OS) save it.  You DO NOT say, Are you sure?You might lose italics! You might lose formatting!  A _good_ machinebehaves as a servant, faithfully obeying its masters commands.  It is not aperson.  It is a machine, a servant to the human operator.  It may even bea friend, but it is a servant nonetheless.  The master will learn withoutthe servant talking back, second-guessing, or otherwise interpreting themasters commands other than literally.Beyond justified complaining about the latest and greatest, let us lookforward to an ideal machine, one conducive to learning and built with theintelligence of the user assumed.LOOKING FORWARDWhat would the next Apple II be like?  Asked more boldly, what _will_ itlook like?  What follows is the author's own speculation and represents notmerely advancement in the computer world, but a Copernican shift, along-awaited convergence of the best of the latest technology withold-world craftsmanship.First, barring a miracle it won't bear the name "Apple".  Second, it willnot look like anything on the market today.  For now, we call it theHypothetical Learning Computer, or HLC.On the outside, it will probably appear similar to a typical tower PC.  Itwill have a high-quality VGA monitor, and perhaps even a radically newinput device  at least, new to the typical consumer.When you turn it on, it will beep at you, and you might see a familiarsight - a flashing white box cursor at the bottom of a screen.  (You willnot see a bunch of unsolicited counters or offers to press this key or thatto "enter BIOS settings"[whatever those are, </sarcasm>].)  Filling the80x48 character text screen, arranged in a grid, are simple menu items.Each menu item represents a program.You "click" on one using the input device, and your web browser pops upinstantly.  You want to hear, say, the Seattle at Oakland game, so you pokeon over to the baseball site, start the stream, and hit a quick keysequence to take you back to the start menu.  What you've really just doneis rebooted, but it occurred instantaneously - seamlessly - and did notstop your stream.  You've told the machine to do in hardware what massive,bloated Orwellian operating systems currently do in software.It is now time to get some work done.  With the ball game on in thebackground, you navigate to your development environment, or businesstools, or whatever suits your particular vocation, and jump right in.  Nodelays, no second guessing, no hourglasses, and no Are you sure? dialogues.No danger of crashing the hard disk either, as each context is managed atthe hardware level.You hear an important play - Brett Boone just hit a triple with two men out- and want to increase the volume.  You bring up the control panel with thefamiliar Control-Alt-Delete key combo.  Instead of clearing the screen, theoptions show up in text with a transparent background, leaving your programvisible behind, but dimmed.A famous 1956 study by George A. Miller (Harvard University), firstpublished in Psychology Review, found that, generally speaking, people canfocus on a maximum of seven things at once.  Thus, a particular systemneedn't offer the ability to hold over 1000 simultaneous process instances- only seven.  Moreover, if each process has its own context space (memory,hard drive), it should be able to implement its tasks in its own mannerbest suited to its applications.  For example, while a web browser might beconsidered one "thing" to the user, it may front seven or eight or fifteentasks internally to send and receive data, update animated graphics on thepage, and update the streaming sound for the ball game via a plug-in.  Thepoint is, each user-level program (e.g., the web browser, not the tasksthat comprise it) could run on its own processor, even sharing memory(possibly) with three or seven other processors, and all sharing resourcessuch as the display and sound.  One program would have the focus, thoughothers may be shown "behind" it, perhaps through translucent windows.Admittedly, this approach is a deviation from the Apple II's creator'soriginal genius of moving most functionality into software.  However, 2004does not hold nearly the cost restrictions on hardware resources as thosepresent in 1977.  Thus, it may not be very costly after all, and it helpsmaintain the openness of the system by keeping software complexity incheck.The overriding concerns are in fact twofold: keep it open, as has been thefocus of this article on the value of computers in learning, and keep itsimple.  This latter point avoids the bloat and sloth we've all come toexperience as part of the warp and woof of modern computing.Now, as far as making the Hypothetical Learning Computer the logical, ifnot familial, heir of the Apple II, what can and can't its creators do?65C02/65C816 emulation:65C02/65C816 emulation would definitely loom large as an integral part ofthe HLC, and in hardware emulation.  While the main processors would likelybe a RISC variant or FPGAs, a 65C02 or two would be very nice to havearound the house and would enable users to run a good deal of existingApple II software.  This latter ability is a key ingredient to HLCssuccess, and _may_ antecede reclamation of the classroom  by a computerbuilt (fittingly) with learning and education at front-center.Original Bank 0 Emulation:Again, this would be necessary to execute existing software, and should notpresent any legal hurdles.  It could be extended to provide support forcutting edge graphics capabilities, and sound comparable to the IIGS, butmodernized to CD-quality levels while maintaining a large number of voices.Original Apple II ROMS:This is a no-no, and violates Apple's legal copyrights.  Legal precedent inApple vs. Franklin established this.  However, Laser produced similar ROMsfrom scratch, which ROMs worked with most software; they withstood asimilar legal challenge.Original Apple II font:This may be the one area where interaction with Apple, Inc. becomesnecessary.  HLCs creators view it as the spiritual, if not ontological,heir of the Apple II, and wish to retain every aspect of the flavor andfeel of that timeless and legendary computer.Apple IIGS emulation:While the Apple IIGS was and is a splendid machine, it represented, in theauthor's opinion, a step in the wrong direction by introducing thebeginnings of a large, monolithic operating system.  Development on likesystems on other platforms has led to the very issues decried previously inthis article, namely: bloat, inapproachability, and inefficiency.Moreover, the IIGS is heavily dependent upon its ROMs, whose size exceedsthat of the Apple Iie's many times over.  Any effort to clean room engineerthem could present a toilsome nightmare.  This effort is better spentelsewhere.  Remember: you don't need a complex operating system to get thebenefits afforded thereby.  There are other ways to achieve multitaskingcapability _and_ responsiveness.Lots and Lots of RAM:Engineers should have little trouble allowing for expansion to 1-2GB of RAMon board should the owner desire it.  However, due to the simplicity of thesystem and the lack of a memory-eating sow with twelve piglets suckingresources, huge gobs of RAM may not be necessary for even the most stunningand processor-intensive games.Emulation of other systems:We've been seeing Apple IIs on PCs and Macs for years now.  The task ofemulation of foreign systems should fall to software.  The huge amounts ofhard drive space necessary for, say, a major PC operating system that willremain nameless, would be cordoned off (read: quarantined!) from the restof the programs on the system, and thus not a danger.  Again, this isenforced at a very low firmware or even hardware level.Fault Tolerance:This one may shock you.  One of the keys to a successful hard disk-enabledopen system is protecting the data from unintentional destruction.  Dualdrives with a rollback feature would be part of the standard setup, andreads could even be optimized for greater speed under this arrangement.This is absolutely necessary to bring the same openness and flexibility ofthe original Apple II (and its derivative) to a hard-drive-based system inthe Twenty-First Century.Ethernet and other hardware peripherals:Software is written to support networking or not, depending on itsfunction.  The hardware would include standard PCI slots for inexpensive PChardware, but would need to be programmed.  Fundamental hardware  definedas hardware directly targeted to _one_ of the five human senses  would bebuilt in, and considerably endowed with formidable technology of the age.This would include the sound (auditory sense), graphics (visual sense), andkeyboard (kinesthetic sense).Display/Sound:Insofar as seeing and hearing are fundamental to the human experience, HLCsvideo and audio capabilities will be fixed in the system and part of theHLC organic whole.  This approach brings low-level access to truly awesomegraphical and audio hardware to the masses, and it eliminates vendorconfusion over which peripherals to support:  There is one video mode, andone sound card.  Also, it encourages developers to refocus energy otherwisewasted on supporting a wide variety of hardware.  It lets them tap into thehardware "goodies", the more specialized functions of the hardware thatmight not be available on all units of a wide variety of display adapters.TARGET MARKETAnyone who loves computing but hates the hassle is a potential customer forthe Hypothetical Learning Computer.  Young boys are candidates who aspireto be to video game development what Isaac Asimov was to science fiction.Young ladies wanting to get ahead in school would find their computingneeds met.  Moms who want to organize their recipes, calendars, and cruisethe web without learning a massively complicated operating system wouldfind the HLC attractive as a family computer.  Dads updating their familiesmonthly budget and then learning BASIC with their sons and daughtersappreciate the HLCs simplicity and transparency.  And long-time Apple IIveterans and former users the world over are of course warmly invited topartake of something they've not experienced since 1989: A new, highlyadvanced and innovative model of the machine they grew to know, enjoy, andlearn from.The HLC is just that.  It is not intended for business or commerce, but forthe purpose of restoring to the home user the joy of computing.WHEN WILL THE HLC BECOME A REALITY?It would take one person years in engineering effort and patience to buildsuch a machine.  Details would need to be worked out, debated, andanalyzed.  It would require a modest investment in equipment and software(running, no doubt, on a bloated, crash-prone machine) but there's no goodreason why it could not one day come to fruition provided its creatorsfollow the all pertinent legalities.  Needless to say, positiveparticipation from Apple would be extremely well received, but, just asDetroit Tiger fans should not expect a World Series Championship in 2004,one had best not expect such positive participation from the Originators.Jeri Ellsworth offers a unique inspiration, as through her and her team theCommodore 64 is reborn.  The spirit of innovation and creativity, inspiredin many cases during a childhood influenced by such machines, dies hard.The author realizes others with a similar dream for the Apple II have comeand gone.  Let the reader rest assured that _this_ dream will only die whenthe author of this article dies, and hopefully (by that time) the dreamwill have long since materialized and inspired millions who will becarrying the personal computing torch for future generations.-GHAnyone interested in the contents of this article, or in participating inthe HLC project, should contact hedger@sbcglobal.net.[ITL]------------------------      ILLUMINATING THE LAMP |-----------------------------An overview of GEnieLamp A2 and The Lamp!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~By Steven WeyhrichThe series ILLUMINATING THE LAMP will continue next month.[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][ASU]Announcement System Updated"""""""""""""""""""""""""""We've got a new login announcement system in place, which will make iteasier for us to keep you informed.
