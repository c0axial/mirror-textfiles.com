Not a sexy supermodel, but an honest-to-God computer virusthat came via infected email and spread like wildfire through themainstream computing world.  Windows machines were left temporarilyuseless, and some Macs were affected as well.     Those of us with an Apple II were left unharmed.     Life on the trailing edge of technology has all kinds ofadvantages--you get to know things well.  There's a certain comfort tostill using an Apple II over 20 years later--like putting on a shoe thatyou've used for years, or wearing a glove that fits you just right.     Sometimes, there's just something right with the way we live: on theedge.                                [*] [*] [*]     Pleased To Meet You Department: Although I would like otherwise, _TheLamp!_ has not had a lot of guest writers.  I realize part of the problemis that as a free publication it's just not possible to budget in any sortof payment for writers.  Back in the _GEnieLamp A2_ days, "payment" forwriters was in terms of "free hours" for GEnie subscribers.  But with freeand flat rate accounts the norm, even that is not much of an incentive.     Fortunately, the lack of payment hasn't stopped one of our loyalDelphi faithful.  Tee Cashmore, a longtime Apple II devotee who is one ofthe regulars in the A2 Forum on Delphi, has volunteered to educate us onthe use of assisted devices with the disabled population.  It's importantwe remember that one of the strengths of the personal computer is that ithas leveled the playing ground for many people, including those withdisabilities.     Thanks, Tee, for reminding us.                                [*] [*] [*]     Dance The Night Away Department: If I actually manage to get thisissue out on time, it'll be just hours before the KansasFest 1999 earlybird registration discount offer ends.

We were""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   working at HP's Palo Alto research lab on away to interface HP's newest programmable hand-held calculators to theirmainframe attached line printers, you know, the big beasties with the printtrains and the 16 inch wide ribbons with the rollers on either end.We had completed the hardware part of the interface, i.e. the "black box"that contained the circuit boards and the IC's and semiconductors et al.and the power convertor and cables with the maxi-to-micro connectors, butwe were having difficulties with the "firmware". You see, the hand-heldcalculators functioned in "reverse-Polish-notation" and the printers used aproprietary version of "binary-coded-decimal-interchange-code". I know, Iknow, you're thinking "why not just implement Kluge's theorem with theextensions worked out by Richter and Thrush?" but don't forget this was1974 (and it seems so easy now!)By chance, when my colleague was in the head reading "Particle Physics andMicrowave Oven Technology Today", he stumbled upon a paper written by alittle known computer science professor at Harvard University named RandallGormly.It seems Professor Gormly had worked out about 69% of what we neededalready. For those of you who are old enough to remember, Randall Gormlyhad devised, between 1966 and 1971, the "Gormly Method" of implementingalgorithms into computer programs. Programs developed using the "GormlyMethod" shared three characteristics, namely: 1.) they were extraordinarilyminuscule in memory, which was important back then because the largestmainframe computers only had 256k. 2.) They were exceedingly efficient. 3.)They were 100% bug free.  In fact, in 13 years of teaching at Harvard, onlyone pair of students completed his course with a buggy program. C & Dgrade-level students were writing 100% bug free programs with his method,which was the greatest testimony he could earn.Anyway, to make a long story short, we convinced our project manager tofinagle a couple of plane tickets to Massachusetts so we could work withProfessor Gormly and hopefully overcome the challenges we faced,software-wise, and get this printer project off our to-do list beforeChristmas.When we arrived at Harvard University, we, of course, went directly toProfessor Gormly's office, since it was his office hour between classes.When we maneuvered our way into the building and finally found his office,the door was slightly ajar and a mildly heated discussion was progressingbetween Professor Gormly and two of his students. We decided to waitoutside in the hall until the students left.Unfortunately, we could hear what was transpiring inside the office anyway."Look, Mr. Allen, you failed this project for two reasons. Number one, youwere supposed to do your work by yourself, not collaborate with anotherstudent...""But professor, project management is an essential skill in the real worldwork place..""But, Mr. Allen, this is not the real world, this is college. However, thisbrings us to point two as to why you're being flunked, your program has"bugs" in it.""Sure it has some minor glitches, but the program is ESSENTIALLY CORRECT!It only crashes sometimes. MOST OF THE TIME it completes successfully, andwhen it does complete, the results are as EXPECTED!""Please lower your voice, Mr. Gates. "Essentially Correct" and "Most of theTime" are not good enough, it shows a real lack of forethought and planningand a poor implementation, neither of which will ever fly, in college norin the 'real world'""Ha! That just shows you what you know, Gormly. If we had used your methodit would have taken us five times as long to write the program, and oursgets the same results as yours, except when it crashes.""Mr. Gates, what will the user do when your program crashes? What resultswill he use then?""Big f__king deal. If the computer crashes you just reboot it and then whenyou run the program again you'll get the results because, like I saidbefore, the program is ESSENTIALLY correct.""Mr Gates, I cannot believe what you are saying. ABSOLUTELY NO ONE inbusiness, industry, science, or academia would EVER use a program thatcrashes, even if it is only one out of seven times it is used. If you triedto market a program like that, you would not be in business for long. Infact, I will make a prediction. IF You Write Programs That Crash For AnyReason You Will Fail. I PREDICT THAT 25 YEARS FROM NOW, IN 1999, THATPROGRAMS USING THE GORMLY METHOD WILL BE IN USE WORLD WIDE AND THE GORMLY'SWILL BE THE FIRST FAMILY OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. BILL GATES AND PAUL ALLENWILL BE PENNILESS PAUPERS SELLING PENCILS DOOR-TO-DOOR, OR HOMELESSDERELICTS BEGGING ON THE STREET. Mark my words, you two, you are destinedto become complete failures if you don't program correctly, starting today.Now get out of my office and don't come back until you have redone yourassignment, by yourselves, and without bugs."At this point the two students stormed out of the office, the little pimplyfaced kid muttering something about "I was going to quit computer studiestomorrow and switch to something more profitable, like ceramic engineering,but I'm going to show this b*st*rd!!!!" and the bigger one tagging alongbehind saying something like "Calm down Bill, and I'll help you. I saw anad for some kind of home-computer gizmo, maybe we can write a basicinterpreter for it, or something like that."Of course, when we went into Randall Gormly's office he was still upset andwasn't in a frame of mind to see us just now. He asked us to come backlater, perhaps tomorrow. Besides, he had an appointment with his publisherto print the definitive study on computer science, a series of books on theGormly Method.Unfortunately, later that night, Professor Gormly was busted in a motelroom with two nude under-aged female students and a kilo of marijuana,apparently partial payment by his publisher for his manuscripts. Thepublisher apparently swiped the papers and burned them so as not to beimplicated, and Professor Gormly had his pencil neck broken by two thugssharing his cell. Apparently computer geeks were looked down upon by theunder classes back in 1974. Consequently, we were not able to finish ourprinter project and the "Gormly Method" was never published. They had totake a previously rejected manuscript by some dork named Donald Knuth.And people say the sixties was a strange time.                       (HABANERO, 21516, GO COM A2)FIRST LOOK AT A NEW 'NET SEARCH ENGINE   At the latest Monday night chat,""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   one of the many off-topic sidediscussions led me indirectly this morning to a new search engine thatlooks really promising.

Basically one click down away from the platen for each additionalpaper thickness. Usually for single sheet thickness printing you would haveit raised up, as close to the platen as it will go.You can also adjust the height of the print head slightly with respect tothe platen by turning the red adjusting ring on the small vertical cylinderjust to the right of the ribbon. Push down gently turn and release. This isto compensate for the four color ribbons that have the color bands shiftedup or down slightly. Which causes the top or bottom of the line beingprinted to have a different color than the rest of the line.The ImageWriter II has several test modes. And they are easy to check.Unplug the printer's serial cable while doing this testing. Plug it back inwhen your done. Naturally for safety's sake, you don't make or break anyconnection to your computer system while it or the printer is turned on.You can run the printer's built in self test if you hold down the FormFeedbutton while you turn the printer on. (Press and hold FormFeed, power onthe printer, wait for it to finish moving the carriage then release theFormFeed button.) This will also read out the ROM revision number, the DIPswitch settings, which option card is installed, and how much memory ithas. Turn off the printer to stop the test.Holding down the LineFeed button while you turn the printer on will causethe carriage assembly to move back and forth without printing and withoutany line feeds. Test can be stopped by pressing the LineFeed button. Andcan be restarted by pressing the Select button. Turn off the printer tostop the test.You can run the printer's built in Loopback test (designed to test the I/Ocircuits) if you hold down the PrintQuality button while you turn theprinter on. This will also read out the ROM revision number, the DIP switchsettings, which option card is installed, and how much memory it has. Thenit will start printing the test pattern. If a problem is found then themessage LOOPBACK TEST FAILS will be printed. For this test to work you needan adapter plug that fits into the serial port socket that has pins 1&2 andpins 3&5 connected together. Turn off the printer to stop the test.You can put the printer in hex dump mode by holding down the Select buttonwhile turning it on. Then print a test document on continuous feed paper.You should be able to decipher the codes sent to the printer to see what'sgoing on. Control codes and character codes will all be out put as hexnumbers. Go get an ASCII chart that has the hex numbers listed to interpretthe codes. This is a great diagnostic aid to see what your program issending to the printer.--- snip ---Bartism: I will not drive the principal's car.       _ _      /:\:\     /`./`/ \_\_\:/./__ (")})})})})}--  ^ <<<<~~~~   Honeybee                     (APISMELIFERA, 20882, GO COM A2)>>>>>   There is a small lever on the right hand (looking from the front)"""""   end of the printer slide bar which is meant to adjust formulti-part forms.

From Basic, you would do an "INITHELLO[,S6][,D1]" to initialize a disk in the default drive or the drivespecified by the optional S(lot) and D(rive) parameters.

(It didn't have to be "HELLO" but that was theexample given, and most people just went along.) There were utilities toinitialize "data" disks, which contained no DOS, and freed up two of thethree DOS tracks. These utilities usually put a small program on the firsttrack to put a message on the screen if you tried to boot from a data disk.Converting a data disk to a boot disk required you do a complete reformat.With ProDOS, you need a utility program to initialize a disk, and bydefault, it is a data disk. You can turn it into a boot disk by putting acopy of the "PRODOS" file on the disk. ProDOS will automatically look for aSystem file to run, and this will usually be "BASIC.SYSTEM" which providesthe BASIC disk commands and interface to BASIC.On a GSOS boot disk, the PRODOS file is a program to start the GSOS bootprocess, and the Real PRODOS is hidden in the System folder and named P8.  -- Carl Knoblock - Telephone Tech - Fri  5 Mar 99  10:18:14 pm cknoblo@novia.net - Via Spectrum v2.2 & Crock O' Gold v2.6 Using Marinetti 2.0 - Transmit timing off. KansasFest 11, July 21-25, 1999 - 138 days till KFest                        (CKNOBLO, 21056, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I'd like to add one small clarification to that.

The resource error was actually due to the updated XCMDsnot being copied over.So for those few who downloaded the 8th March version of COG3, you need tocheck these actions:1. If you choose to update from COG2, drag a copy of the Taglines file in   the 'Contributed:Jeff.Carr' folder to the 'COG2:Configs' folder of your   existing COG before you install.2. If you choose to use your existing phone number, it must have no spaces   in it. Just edit any spaces to hyphens.3. After you have installed COG3, but before you run it, copy the XCMDs you   will find in the 'Add.Ons:XCMDs' folder of the archive into the   'Add.Ons:XCMDs' folder of your working Spectrum 2.2.All should be well after you have done that... Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Tue 9 Mar 1999 - 134 days till KFest '99 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum 2.2 & Crock O' Gold 3.0 Bernie ][ the Rescue 2.0 woofing at 55Mhz on a G3/350 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                        (EWANNOP, 21204, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I don't know what I did wrong, but something bit me big time with"""""   the update to 3.0.It started when I couldn't download the file from Compuserve.  Actually, Icould download it using the Mac, but I couldn't figure out how to get theGS to convert it to a .bxy file so that I could expand it.  I thensuccessfully transferred the file to Delphi, but couldn't download it frommy workspace (the transfers were all aborted by Delphi) using either Zmodemor Xmodem and Spectrum.I eventually retrieved the file from the library using Kermit (over one anda half hours, yechh!).  This was of course recognized as a bxy file andunshrunk readily.  I then could not get the installer to run (applicationnot recognized was the error message I think), so I ran the script fromwithin Spectrum.  Everything appeared to go fine, so I attempted to run COGand got a "resource could not be load/unloaded" error message.  Rebootingand trying again got the same message.  Running Start.cog from withinSpectrum gave the same error.I am using Spectrum 2.2, but from within Bernie, so I may not have all thefiles that I need to successfully run this update, especially as I notedthat the scripts appear to be compiled.Does anyone have any suggestions about what I might be missing, or mighthave done wrong? David R.

You only need todo this once, and it to work for you every time after that.But running the Installer from Spectrum is just fine. But you then got aresource error. This sounds to me like the bug that hit the first versionof COG3 that I put on my web pages. That version should not have made it toDelphi. The correct version of COG3 is dated 10th March. The bug caused theInstaller to not copy the updated XCMDs over to your working Spectrum 2.2'Add.Ons:XCMDs' folder.

The Hardware.You need two localtalk network connectors and a cable to connect them. Theconnectors have a short wire hanging out that plugs into any serial port onyour GS or Mac; you need one for each. They come in two flavors calledLocalTalk and PhoneNet. These work the same. The difference is thatLocalTalk connectors use a shielded coaxial cable, so they may work alittle better in an electrically noisy environment. PhoneNet uses standardphone connectors, so it's cheap. You can get either one from just about anyMacintosh supplier.2. The Mac.Turn on file sharing. Under System 8.5 you use the File Sharing ControlPanel to do this. Enable sharing for the drives of folders that you want tobe able to access from the Apple IIGS. From System 8.5, you do this fromthe Sharing... submenu of the GetInfo menu item in the Finder's File menu.In System 7.5, I think there is a menu item right in the file menu, but Idon't remember the exact name.3. The GS.Turn on AppleTalk using the AppleTalk control panel. You'll see your Maclisted by name; once you select it, you will see the hard drives that areshared listed. You can sign on to any or all of them.There are several steps involved in setting up the software, but the menusI mentioned bring up dialogs that step you through it fairly well.Once everything is set up, the Mac drives appear on your GS desktop as ifthey were local disks, except the icon is a bit different. You can readfiles, write files, delete files... anything you want to do that you gaveyourself permission to do when you set up sharing on the Macintosh.Mike Westerfield                       (BYTEWORKS, 21347, GO COM A2)SO WHICH //E IS WHICH?

Utter                         (UTTER, 21755, GO COM A2)SCSI ID JUMPER BASICS   The jumpers for SCSI drives ID selection are"""""""""""""""""""""   virtually always a set of three jumpers which incombination can yield any ID number 0 thru 7. So, the first jumperrepresents the 'value' = 1, the second the 'value' = 2, and the third the'value' = 4. Get some jumper blocks and experiment with your row ofjumpers. Then, go into your RamFast utilities (if you have a RamFast :) andsee what ID number the drive has.The easiest method is to use a single jumper block and try one of thepositions on the end of your row of jumpers. If you get a valid SCSI IDvalue you know which end of the row handles the SCSI IDs. The adjacent twopositions will handle the other 'values'. If you get an ID of zero (or yourdrive behaves oddly), you have jumpered the positions not responsible forSCSI ID selection, so go to the other end of the row of jumpers and youshould be set!Remember, having no jumpers across the SCSI ID positions will give you anID of zero. If you don't have any other devices with this ID you could justgo ahead and format your drive and use it 'as is'. However, if you want tohave other devices on your SCSI chain it is probably worthwhile to do thedetective work and determine the SCSI ID positions.Finally, your drive manufacturer may have the tech specs for your drive ontheir web site. Check this first, it may save you the trouble altogether!Good luck,Paul.schultp@delphi.com                        (SCHULTP, 21808, GO COM A2)                                RUMOR MILL                                """"""""""GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS FROM WDC   NEWS FLASH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I just talked to Western Design about ordering the 65816-14's.

I'm also thinkingthat the time has come for there to be a CD-ROM collection that wouldinclude "ready to run" software that isn't compressed with ShrinkIt.As it is, I've been distributing freeware, shareware and public domainApple II software for 12 years now, through the Source, and Big RedComputer Club, and through Shareware Solutions II, and as you can imagine,I've acquired quite a collection of Apple II disks over the years.I don't yet know that I have a grand total of 650 megs of unique software,but it's quite possible that I do have nearly that much that has not beenmade available before on CD-ROM.I have a little problem though, so I thought I'd mention it here...I do not currently own the hardware that I would need in order to organizethe software, nor do I have a CD-R. So, I would need to purchase two piecesof hardware for this project: - I would need to have a SCSI hard drive with a capacity of 700 megs (giveor take), and since the actual burning of the CD-R would take place on a 33Mhz 68030 Mac, that drive would need to be AV rated. It would need to befully assembled, in a case with a power supply. As envisioned, the harddrive would be formatted on the Mac, but all the organization and filecopying would take place on the IIGS...so the drive would have to work with(and have drivers available for) the Mac and it would have to work with anApple High Speed SCSI Card. - I would also need a SCSI CD-R that burns CDs at 2X, and that would workon, and have software for, the 33 Mhz 68030.If you or anyone you know has, or will have in the future, such equipmentfor sale, at a reasonable and affordable price, please get in touch withme. Thanks!Again, this is just an idea I am toying with.Since I'm currently distributing the other CD-ROM collections, I think Ihave a general idea about potential sales, and because of thoseprojections, the cost of the hardware will really be the prime determinantas to whether this CD-ROM fantasy becomes a reality. Joe Kohn http://www.crl.com/~joko                       (JOE_KOHN, 20978, GO COM A2)BASIC INSTINCTS   What you want is something like Windows' MS-DOS prompt"""""""""""""""   that can be either windowed or full-screen, right?

All you need is an AOL account or a free AIM account,System 6.0.1, and Marinetti 2.0 (with a working connection to an ISP, ofcourse).This new version of gsAIM fixes a couple of bugs (so more people should beable to get connected) and supports "warnings." If someone sends you aninappropriate message, you can now "warn" them. If they get warned too manytimes, their account is closed. This innovative feature of AOL InstantMessenger is one of the nicest things about it; it helps keep the wilderelement of the Web off your desktop by giving you the power to respond whensomeone is out of line. Of course, you can be warned, too, and gsAIM 1.1will tell you if it happens.(This is of course a standard AIM feature; gsAIM just did not previouslyprovide access to it).You can try a limited version of gsAIM -- without support for saving buddylists or your preferences -- by visiting<http://www.sheppyware.net/software/gsAIM/>.After you've tried it, just fill out the included registration form andmail it in, or visit my online ordering page at<http://order.kagi.com/?QGC> to pay the fee by credit card online.Note to users that have already registered the software: your currentregistration code is still valid, just replace the gsAIM NDA with the onefrom this package.If you have questions about gsAIM, don't hesitate to email me:sheppy@sheppyware.net.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                        (SHEPPY, 20937, GO COM A2)IMAGEMAKER DEBUTS   Create Disk Image Files on the Apple IIgs!"""""""""""""""""The latest SheppyWare creation, ImageMaker 1.0, lets you create DiskCopy4.2 and Universal Disk Image (also known as 2IMG or 2MG) files right onyour Apple IIgs.

I have formats for several, but not all thedata files for New Print Shop and Print Shop GS. I will shortly be figuringout some of the ones I don't have, so I will send them to you as I getthem. If you wish, I can also send you information on the person I talkedto at Broderbund about releasing the file formats.Since Broderbund considers the file formats to be proprietary, there aresome restrictions we must reserve. I only got permission from them torelease data formats for the Apple II version of New Print Shop and PrintShop GS, so we cannot release data files for any other version of PrintShop under this agreement. Also, the agreement only covers the data files,not any source code or disassembly of the programs themselves. They can bereleased as part of a collection of File Type Notes (say, in the Genie orDelphi library), but I do not believe that I or anybody else has permissionto post them separately as messages on the Genie or Delphi forums, or oncsa2. I also believe that neither I nor anyone else has permission topublish them separately in a magazine or newsletter. If you are becoming anofficial distributor of File Type Notes, then you will be able to put themon your web page as part of the File Type Notes. Others are not allowed topost them separately on their web pages. I was given permission toprivately distribute the information to individuals via something likeE-mail, but I believe that others who wish to have that permission musttalk to Broderbund themselves.It may be wise to put a disclaimer explaining these restrictions where theformats distributed. That way, if someone redistributes the information ina way that annoys Broderbund, we can claim that we warned them of therestrictions and they misbehaved on their own. I don't expect Broderbund toreally care about this, but you never know.

Because I was lategetting to the chat, I used a capture of the chat that Sheppy was kindenough to provide to me.  The only editing I did was to remove some privatemessages that had been sent to Sheppy (don't worry Shep, there was nothingincriminating :-) as well as the responses from a few commands that Sheppy,as the moderator of the chat, saw.Also, I moved a few lines around so that people's "thoughts" didn't getbroken up by other people's messages.  This happened quite a bit to MikeWesterfield as he was trying to get lots of information across.  I simplytook these separate lines and made sure that they were contiguous in thetranscript so that it is easier to follow what someone is saying.Now to the future.  In the current transcript, each line can be up to 80characters long and ends in a carriage return so if someone typed somethingthat took two or three lines to display, it takes two or three lines in thetranscript as well.  Unfortunately, using a IIgs text viewer using certainfonts, some of those single lines get word wrapped and this ends up makingthe file look awful.  Kind of like this:     .Mike> Hi guys. Sorry I'm so late, but my access seems slow. I     actually started     10 minutes ago. :)This can be fixed if I make what each person says into a paragraph.  Wouldthis be something that people would fine useful?Also along these lines, sometimes people type more than 255 characterswhich ends up causing the last part of what they typed to appear as if itwas a second this that the person typed.  Kind of like this:   .Jeff> All through my schooling I was constantly correcting my     computer programming teachers. From high school through college.     I learned to program by reading a text on Waterloo Structured     BASIC before there was even a high sc   .Jeff> hool course I could take. :)This can be fixed by just deleting the second instance of the name andappending the extra text to the previous text.  This would work well inconjunction with the paragraph fix above and would have the added benefitof grouping the large sections of Mike's messages (at one point there isten messages in a row from him) into nice easy to read paragraphs withMike's name at the beginning once and not appearing multiple times.  :-)Let me know what you think and also let me know of anything else that couldbe done to improve the transcripts.By the way, I'll do my best to make sure these transcripts are available byThursday of each week from now on. Jeff Blakeney |      Dean of the Apple II University in A2Pro      | --------------+----------------------------------------------------+   sent via    |   HyperCard IIgs Course   |   GSoft BASIC Course   |   COG v3.0    |      now in session       |     now in session     |                      (JBLAKENEY, 2545, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Just a reminder and to make sure that everyone has the correct"""""   information about the GSoft BASIC course as some of you may havecome across some conflicting information.

Everyone here with a computer uses one,probably a mouse or track ball.  If you're lucky and rich enough, maybe youhave a newer laptop, in which case you probably use the built in figurepad.  Accountants like separate numeric keypads.     This may not seem like a topic for everyone, but wait until you getolder and your fine motor skills start to wane, or perhaps, God forbid, youget into an accident and find that you can no longer control your righthand; same in reverse for lefties.  My clients tend to have somewhat severedeficiencies, such as Cerebral Palsy, head injuries of various types anddegrees, Muscular Dystrophy, Post Polio Syndrome and Parkinson's, to namethe more common ones.     Cerebral Palsy users mostly have to have a special keyboard, such as a"Bliss" board. The keyboard is about 3-4 times as large, the keys are quitelarge and can be programmed to input words and commands, rather thanletters.  Severe cases may have to have headbands that control input onto aspecial screen by means of a tough probe, if they are lucky enough to stillhave control of their head movements.     In head injury cases we tend to try to use regular keyboards, but thesoftware is specially designed to reteach the brain to learn commands, sothe software becomes the assisted device.  Some have to use the devices Ihave already mentioned.     Muscular Dystrophy patients generally use similar devices to theCerebral Palsy ones, but the degree of the disease affects everyonedifferently, so it all depends on what skills they have left, or skillsthat can be relearned.     Some Post Polio cases have recently found an increasing problem.  Manypeople who had Polio years ago, often as children, are suddenly findingthat the disease has returned after years of having no symptoms.  One of myclients in his late seventies has great difficulty controlling his fingermovements.  Every time I see him there are many empty folders on thedesktop, simply because a finger hit the wrong key by mistake.  He hasfound that his PowerBook's pad is a godsend, as he can control his fingerif he puts pressure on it, but he can't control the pressure on a mouse andtherefore the pad became an assisted device!     Many people with Parkinson's may find that the pad is their salvationtoo.     Personally, I use a "Little Mouse" and have found it a useful devicefor many of my clients, especially those with limited arm movement, orArthritis, as the pad is much smaller and the pointer is controlled by alaser beam.  The mouse rides very smoothly on a metallic pad and I canreach from one side of the screen to the other in about 7-10 cm (3-4inches).  I don't have a disability that I know of, but I really like my"Little" mouse.     Talking computers and computers that answer to spoken commands arealso examples of assisted devices and have been around since the early80's.     You may be interested in the history of all of these devices,including the numeric keypad.  Back in the days of Apple II's, theadvantage was that the 7 slots allowed for numerous cards to controldevices and many different aids were produced, mostly by 3rd partymanufacturers, to work on an Apple //e, and later a IIgs's.  There arethousands, if not millions of Apple II's still in use in American schoolsand hospitals, nobody seems to know how many in Canada, but it is certainlyin the thousands.  An Assisted Device Card to control special keyboardsstill retails for $750, the Bliss board for another $750.  AppliedEngineering of Texas made an excellent speech card, which is still in usein many therapy areas and I installed one 3 years ago in a IIgs at ahospital speech therapy clinic in Sarnia.     This is just a quick overview of computer assisted devices, but ifyou use an Apple II, 10-1 you are using one.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :       Double your drive space!
