Unseasonably warm weather, with abundant rainrather than snow, has resulted in the ground being carpeted in a rich greencolor.     We have a clear view of the "mile markers" along the sides of thehighway in the distance... a reminder of the milestones of many years ago.     Syndicomm Online reached a milestone this month.  The service wentonline December 8, 2000 with an open beta test period.  The growth ofservice and the evolution of the software to provide this service has beenvery impressive.     Other milestones were reached this month.  This is the forty eighthissue of The Lamp!... a full four years of publication.

A seed from the previous yearhad fallen into the crack and sprouted.  This plant, small in stature, wassoon displaying brilliant yellow blooms... radiating a beautiful greetingto all who passed.     The gardener has removed all the plants from the flower bed so as toclean it up for the following season... but overlooked the little viola.The unusually warm, moist season has favored this tiny plant... itcontinues to bloom to this day.     So if you think you have it tough and have no time to help others whohave an interest in Apple II computers, consider the tiny viola growing inthat crack in the sidewalk.     You might consider helping with the Apple II Documentation Project orthe Welcome Wagon Project.

It started when my GS would just out ofthe blue freeze.  By that I mean that nothing would work, not the mouse,not the keyboard (except usually for the three finger reset).  This neverseemed to happen when the computer was in use, but when it was justsitting, usually with the monitor off.This last time I had to turn the computer off, and when I turned it back onI got a message about my Ram Disk was too big.  I do not have a ram disk.Turning it off and back on usually got me the same error message, as didthe warm boot, but occasionally I would get a 308 error (or maybe -308?)I took out the ram card (just purchased about a month ago) but there was nodifference.  I then removed the ethernet card, the RamFast card, andfinally the ZipGS card (putting back the original cpu chip). At this point,with all of these cards out but with the ram card in, it almost booted froma floppy.  Almost, but not quite.I put everything back in and was getting it ready to take to my local Applestore tomorrow.  I turned it on and I am writing this message on it. :)Now, I'm sure that somebody will say that the contacts on one of the cardswas corroded or that one of the cards was not completely in the slot, but Ihad taken each card out separately and re-seated it previously in mytrials.So, I would appreciate any guesses as to how long I will be able to keepthis machine running, and any guesses as to which of the four cards was themost likely villain. David R.

TheDisk ][ analog card layout was completely thrown out and started again tosave just one more hole in the PCB.On the PCB a hole where a trace goes from the front to the back side of theboard is known as a VIA, the best design with reference to usingthrough-hole components (DIP chips, resistors, caps like what the ][+ and//e are made of as opposed to the surface-mount stuff like the IIgs) is towork the layout to make the most use of the component holes as VIAs insteadof having to drill more holes in the board. Back then each hole was another10 cents in manufacturing costs. Considering the first 200 Apple II's weremade and paid for before they were sold, every penny counted and thatphilosophy stayed with Apple for many years after.The RAMFast Rev C and Rev D are good examples of through-hole compared tosurface mount. The RAMFast Rev D also has a bit of this same "Woz" approachto limiting VIAs and board area. The address lines on the EPROM have beenre-ordered as so no traces have to cross each other to get to the ROM whereas the Rev C is not. The Rev C card is huge and has lots of room to runstuff all over where as the Rev D was a challenge to cram as much aspossible. The smaller the PCB the more you can make on a standard piece ofstock - the less you waste. If you design your PCB to use every inch of thepanel you pay less in that you are paying for the full panel anyway so youmight as well use it. That combined with the fewer holes you have drilledin it mean fewer incidents of possibly non-plated VIAs and through-holesmeaning a failed board. This is an example of what I mean. ___________________A1       ___________________A6/ __________________A2      / __________________A1|/ _________________A3      |/ _________________A7||/ ________________A4      ||/ ________________A5|||/ _______________A5      |||/ _______________A4||||/ ______________A6      ||||/ ______________A8|||||/ _____________A7      |||||/ _____________A3||||||/ ____________A8      ||||||/ ____________A2|||||||/                   |||||||/||||||||                  ||||||||||||||||   Rev C          ||||||||  Rev Do|||||||  Standard        o||||||| Non-standard o||||||   Layout          o||||||  Layout  o|||||                    o|||||   o||||                     o||||    o|||                      o|||     o||                       o||      o|                        o|       o                         oThat is why you can not switch the ROMs between RAMFast versions. One wasoptimized for PCB layout  and the other is not. The SIMMs on the Sirius RAMcard are the same way. In the two banks each 4 are not wired 1 to 1, 2 to2, etc either. Storage is storage, as long as the data is where it wasplaced it will work. As long as that ROM image for the Rev D card isorganized in the order so that when the ROM is read it gets loaded in theproper order everything is fine. That meant an extra step when writing theROM code for the RAMFast. Run the assembler, save the BIN image and thenrun a program on it that acts much the opposite of a drive optimizerprogram. Take every 8th byte and swap with every 5th byte, then take every2nd byte and swap with every 7th byte. In more graphical terms, taking thecolumns of the Supreme Court and removing them and putting them back in adifferent order. A specified order.

I was thinking along the lines of a GSDOC (i.e. the same maintype as AWGS) with a unique aux type.  HTML is really nothing more than atext file with special tags which display formatting in a Browser.  And tosupport greater compatibility with existing text editors for 8-bit AppleIIs and the GS, it was decided that HTML files are just TXT files.  SIStries to be smart and determine if something is HTML by looking at thefilename (i.e. .HTML extension) and by checking the file content for HTMLcode.  Since only a handful of checks are made (for speed reasons), it canmis-identify HTML files.  A unique file type is the only safeguard, if onechanges all their TXT files into another file type and text editors getupdated to store as that format (there are those who write HTML fileswithout using a HTML editor).PDF is also just a TXT file with special information to display a formattedpage in PDF viewers.  PDF files should be transferred as text to and froma GS.  Communication programs such as Spectrum do not handle "special" textfiles as text--anything that isn't TXT is assume to be some sort of binaryfile.  Even GWFTP will download a pdf file and save it as a TXT file.It would be nice to have unique filetype for these special text files, buthow much support will software get to take advantage of them?  Willdevelopers update old programs (Proterm, text editors, etc.)?  Does theApple II user base really care (has anybody opened a non-HTML file into SISand had it displayed as HTML due to the poor checking...also PDF has aunique identifier in the first couple of characters in the file so a TXTfile type is perfectly acceptable so a PDF viewer doesn't need a specialfile type to distinguish between PDF and regular TXT).Going forward, I don't see the continual use of TXT file type as a problem-- beyond the feature to open a file from the Finder.  I'm sure Apple IIgsusers will not mind running a program to open a PDF file (if such a programever is written).Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 60, Top 3, Msg 12)>>>>>"""""Well...
