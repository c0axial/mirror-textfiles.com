The skyline of the city was visible only as ablack silhouette against a cloudy, dark gray sky.     Some sixteen hours earlier, at 4:15 AM, a violent thunderstorm hadhit.  The meteorologists called the storm a microburst.  A layer of coldair suddenly falling through a layer of hot air near the ground...producing very strong wind.  The storm only lasted fifteen minutes.  Thewind had toppled thousands of trees and torn branches from thousands more.The trees and branches had taken down power lines in hundreds of places.     The power company repair crews, with the help of repair crews borrowedfrom other utility companies, worked sixteen hour days for the next fivedays in order to restore power to all.     During this time we were reminded how dependent on electricity we havebecome.  Gasoline could not be pumped.  Stores built without windows couldnot do business.  Refrigerators and freezers were worthless.  Restaurantsremained closed.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars of food spoiled.  And noemail or visits to Syndicomm via the Apple II!     A battery powered radio proved its value to keep up with messages fromthe mayor, the police, the power company...     The local ice company did booming business.  One of the hardwarestores sold portable power supplies as fast as they received them.     So don't take your Apple II (or your other computers) for granted.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[MTB]MARINETTI 3.0beta"""""""""""""""""I've been happily installing Marinetti 3.0beta on several of the other GS'sI have at home and at school.Using the MacIP link layer, and IPNR as the server, I've had 100% success(on 4 GS's) getting excellent connections going.

And yet, despite the two months of silence,I STILL don't have the promised continuation of my year-by-year review ofthe Lamp publications. Since my last edition in the June issue, life hasbeen rather busy, and has dealt some turns that were not entirely expected.     I am not one to believe in coincidence or happenstance; my faith inthe Lord tells me that although I do not usually learn the REASONS forevents in life, I can trust that those events occur by His guidance. So, inthe space of the three months since I last was able to submit an article, Ihave experienced the loss of my mother to cancer; my board recertificationexam in Family Practice (I've learned that I got a passing score); anenjoyable week at KansasFest 2003 (my second attendance, the first being in1994); an interesting repair experience with my PowerBook G4; thesubsequent reconstruction of lost data from that repair; and finallyrecovery of data from my Palm Tungsten C device. In the midst of it all wasa VERY busy time seeing patients in my practice (which I share with twentyother physicians, most of whom work at four other locations here in Omaha),and dealing with the trials and joys of getting my two children back inschool again, in 8th and 9th grades respectively. And did I forget tomention that I am the webmaster for two dog clubs with which my lovely wifeis involved?     All of this adds up to a busy time, which did not allow me sufficienttime to do the month-by-month review of GEnieLamp A2 for the year 1996.     Rather than leave our esteemed editor with yet another issuecontaining no contributed information, I decided to just chat with youabout what happened to me. In the process, I will give some tips on whatyou should and should NOT do with your Macintosh should it requireservicing, and a quick tip on the care and feeding of a Palm OS device. Andalthough not all of you may have a Macintosh or a Palm, the concepts stillapply.POWERBOOK LIMBO---------------     I want to first describe what happened to my primary computer, andwhat YOU can do to prevent the same from happening to you.     Last September I was finally able to join the rest of my family in thewireless realm, and purchased a Macintosh PowerBook G4 for myself. One byone, first my wife, and then each of my two children (as they enteredjunior high school) had a laptop computer (the rugged iBook series),connected to the Internet with an Airport card to our base station. It leftME with a quite adequate iMac on my desk, down in the basement, where theprinter and other digital hub equipment was hardwired in. But this alsomeant that I was becoming more and more left out. The others could sit inthe same room and socialize while they were using their computers; I wasfeeling left out. Well, not any longer! My savings for myself finally couldbe used to rejoin the crowd.     The PowerBook G4 has been a GREAT little machine, with plenty ofhorsepower for the purposes for which I use a computer. And Mac OS X hasbeen quite fun for me; I am learning that using the Unix command line inthe Terminal is a fun throw-back to my Apple II days, with the addition ofthere being almost always something new to do and learn (the Mac OS X Hintssite, http://www.macosxhints.com, is a great place to pick up ways to usethe terminal do things underneath the GUI shell all Macs have used from thebeginning.)     But (there had to be a "but", didn't there?), I found a "little"problem when I tried to boot up in Mac OS 9 in early August. An errormessage popped up stating that there was some problem with the internalcache. I ran the hardware diagnostic CD that accompanied the computer, andit also indicated there was an error. (Interestingly, Mac OS X didn't seembothered by it, and did not flag any error on bootup). A call to Apple techsupport confirmed that there was a problem, and we started the process ofgetting this fixed. "Whew!", I thought to myself. "I'm glad I discoveredthis BEFORE the one year warranty on parts and labor expired. Maybe I'dbetter invest in that AppleCare extended warranty after all." I had alsothought this might be a good idea when I found how expensive some of therepair parts for a PowerBook can be, especially the LCD screen.     Now, I've had other small problems pop up on our laptops since we'veowned them, and am very familiar with the process. Apple sends out a box,which I then use to ship back the computer being fixed. Typically, thistakes only a day or two, and it again appears on my doorstep. Also, thoughI've backed up the ENTIRE hard drive for the iBooks, my PowerBook harddrive is 40 gigabytes in size, and I have only a 30 gigabyte Firewire driveto use for backup. They have NEVER lost any data from the computers we'vesent back (Apple offers a data-backup service, which I've always declined).I reasoned that this was simply a logic board swap, and so they won't haveto mess with the hard drive. I backed up my Documents folder, as well as mySites folder (where I keep the web sites that I maintain, including myApple II History site and the two dog club sites, as well as all of myHistory research files, pictures, etc.) I also backed up my~/Users/steve/Library folder (as it holds all my e-mail and variouspreferences for programs I've installed), the directory where I keepinstall files I've downloaded that are not on CD, my Music, Pictures, andMovie folders. This was, I believed, everything that I could not reproduceeasily if indeed something DID happen to the hard drive (which it was notlikely to do, right?) And off goes my PowerBook, to get fixed.     It was three days, and it had not yet shown up from Airborne Express.I looked at the web site where I can track a repair. No computer mentionedthere. I called the AppleCare support line. Yes, they've received thecomputer, but they do not have that logic board in stock, and it will be acouple more days. So, just to keep them on their toes, I called back eachday after that, and was finding it more and more worrisome as the timelengthened to a full week, then ten days. Now they are saying that they arenot able to get the 800 MHz logic boards at this time, and what they willdo (when they arrive from wherever it is that they are manufactured) is tobump the speed up to the 867 MHz logic board. Oh, well that is just finewith me, although a 67 MHz increase will likely not be noticeable.     Finally, though, I got the bombshell. They expect to have thereplacement logic boards in stock within two to three days, but when theyopened up my computer they found a brown substance on the board and severalother parts inside. I was puzzled about this at first, but their conclusionwas that something had been spilled on the computer, and this had leakeddown into the insides. Now, I don't know if they could PROVE that this wasthe reason for this cache error message, but the result was this was nolonger an under-warranty repair. Instead, it was estimated to run about onethird of the cost of the computer when I purchased it to replace the mainlogic board, the CD-RW drive, the modem, and anything else that had thisbrown substance on it. I reluctantly gave them permission to do the repair.     After I thought it over, I did remember spilling a little of a dietcola onto the keyboard almost a year ago, when it was just new. Thecomputer shut down at the time it happened, but when it dried off it workedjust fine. I had completely forgotten about the incident, and had takenprecautions to prevent it from happening again. Did the residue from thisspill eventually cause the cache error to occur? I'll never know forcertain, but it DID have the unexpected side effect of voiding some of mywarranty just as surely as if I had tried to repair it myself.     I thought it over further, and later in the day called back and askedthem to go ahead and do the hard drive backup, just in case they decidedthat they had to replace the hard drive also. And two days later, Ireceived a box from Apple containing my repaired PowerBook. I removed it,and started it up.     Greeting me was the generic just-installed Mac OS X 10.2 screen, witha user of "Apple", instead of "Steve". I got this funny feeling in mystomach and looked at the hard drive. Yep, mostly empty and definitely NOTthe way it was sent to them. I called back again (by now had the numbermemorized), and was told that by the time they got my call asking for thedata backup to be done, the hard drive had already been replace or wiped orsomething. In any case, my stuff was all gone.     Thank God for what I had backed up, right? Well, this was almostcorrect. Unfortunately, I had NOT backed up my Applications folder, whichwas quite large. This folder contained all of my Bernie ][ The Rescue diskimages, and other emulators and their files. This was a semi-major bummer;much of those Bernie files were not necessarily irreplaceable, but it maybe time-consuming to recreate things the way I like them.     And, most annoying of all, I found that the macros that I had writtenand/or recorded with Microsoft Office X:mac were not kept in the documentsfolder, but right there in the Applications folder! Now I THINK I had knownthis at some time in the past, but didn't think of it when I created mybackup before shipping off the PowerBook. So, I have an OLD copy of macros,but will have to recreate most of the rest of them. And some of the newestones are gone completely, but thanks to Syndicomm.com, the suggestions onhow to create the macros are still there in the bulletin board (in the Macsection).     Anyway, two weeks without a computer at all, and then another week ormore to reload, re-register, and recreate the hard drive the way I wantedit to be did occupy a lot of what little time I had available. Thus, noarticle.POWERBOOK AFTERMATH-------------------     So, the first lesson I'd like you to take away from this incident isBACK UP whatever you think is going to be hard or impossible to reproduce.     The second lesson is to go through the software you use regularly, andmake sure that the good stuff that you have customized is actually IN whatyou backed up.     The third lesson is to avoid pouring drinks (diet or otherwise) intoyour computer. They may cause problems, even on a delayed basis.PALMISTRY---------     And just to be complete in today's care and feeding of magical deviceslesson, I learned (re-learned?) something about the Palm devices that Ionce knew but had forgotten. This all-but-indispensable device holds allkinds of useful information for me, including some old stuff back from myNewton and Handspring Visor Deluxe days.     Well, the other evening, I was looking back over my old notes in theMemo application, when I came across some of the old shortcut-dot commands.These are special commands that do things that are not accessible to theuninitiated, and are potentially harmful if you don't know what you aredoing. You make the shortcut symbol, followed by a period, and then anumber. "4" displays the user name and unique ID; "6" displays the ROMversion; and so on. I must have accidentally entered the "5" shortcut,which erases the user configuration and hotsync log. In any case, one of myPalm applications was suddenly asking for the registration code again, andhad nothing listed for a user ID (name). Grrrr.     Of course, I am away from my PowerBook, so I can't just fix it byre-synchronizing right now. I didn't want to restore from the backup on mySecureDigital card, since I'd done some work since I last backed up earlierin the day (actually, I had done work on the article that I had WANTED tosubmit this month!). Somehow, however, the synchronization process when Idid do it later did NOT resolve things; it was still not functioningproperly.     Okay, so I'll go ahead and restore from my backup on the card, andthen try to synch. Well, that worked for the dates and to-do list, but thenext day I looked for one of my memos, and found ALL of them gone. Goodgrief, I've been doing this Palm stuff for nearly four years now, and havenever had this much problem with it.     So are ALL of my memos gone?? A quick look at the Palm User Data fileon my PowerBook showed all of the memos were still there. Synch again... noluck. The memos show up on the Palm Desktop program as they should, butwill not appear on the Palm unit itself. I finally discovered that all ofthe memos on the desktop computer had been put in the "None" folder, ratherthan what it was supposed to be. So, I went through and fixed over 400memos by putting them each in the correct folder, and THEN they wouldsynchronize as they were supposed to do.     Fourth lesson: Don't mess with the dot shortcuts on your Palm unlessyou specifically KNOW what you are doing. Duh.BUT WHAT ABOUT THE APPLE II??-----------------------------     I do have about one third of the 1996 article's data compiled. If lifedoes not hand me any other unusual experiences, I will be able to get backto the original reason for this series.Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.org[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][EMH]"X-MailScanner" IN EMAIL HEADER"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Quick announcement:At some point during the current ongoing rash of Windows virii, someoneapparently decided to circulate a rumor that "X-MailScanner" appearing inemail headers is a good sign that a message contains a virus.

Greg - was that your idea?Sunday noon: This time we made it and found some gifts for my kids and forToni's family... (and cheap HotDogs). We had quite some fun because it wasa nicely designed shop. And it was crowded. That's very different than inGermany. Although there is a strong demand from industry, church andgovernment still succeed in keeping Sundays quieter than the other days bynot allowing shops to open (except gas stations, restaurants, cinemas andsome others). This sunday, America changed my mind. I am one of thosepeople who criticize the law that limits the opening time in Germany.I will be fighting to keep Sunday quiet in the future.The second thing I learned at Cabela's was, that it's not good to be a fishin the US. You will see why, when you see the picture.We went to the airport to check in our luggage (and get our "A"-groupboarding ticket from Southwest). There was plenty of time so we did notreturn the car right away. We finally found a WalMart and worked our waythrough our wish list.We returned the car after that and went through the security check wherethey turned Toni almost upside down. This starts a small "side" story:   I was told, that Americans are "politically correct" and that this could   be interpreted as "a touch can have the same consequences as rape" (or   is that only prejudice?). So how does a security officer look through   Toni's clothes while being politically correct? He had to explain every   move like "I am now having to touch the side of your trousers with the   back of my left hand", which I had to translate to Toni because he   couldn't imagine what the officer was worried about. (The officer was   just waiting for an "OK"). This situation seemed to me to be somehow   absurd. The place where I would have imagined such a dialog taking place   would be in a closed, medical examination room, where drug couriers who   swallowed the forbidden stuff, having been caught, are being examined   very "closely". But what I saw was right beside the X-ray machine in the   midst of LOTS of people at the airport... and except for his shoes, Toni   didn't have to take off any of his clothes. I explained to the officer   that we were from Germany and that it is not usual over there to be put   in jail for a wrong word or touch.End of "side story".As some of you also experienced we became victims of the bad weather over.... (put some major cities here) which delayed our machine. The firstdelay was the missing plane (45 minutes). I talked to a young lady at theSouthwest counter who really had panic in her eyes watching the queue ofnervous people getting longer and longer. I told her that I could seeproblems with our connecting flight to Europe (we had a tight time table)but she said she couldn't do much about it, we should ask a taxi driver inChicago to drive a bit faster to get to the plane. That's a typicalSouthwest Airlines answer, isn't it?NIGHT IN CHICAGOSunday evening:After the plane finally arrived, the same woman had to make anannouncement: The crew for the flight was delayed even more, and they willtry to find another crew, which will take another hour. I returned to thecounter where the lady was even closer to collapse... but her colleague wasVERY helpful. He rebooked our flight to Europe to the next day and gave ushotel and food vouchers. That was something that I would have expected whenflying an expensive airline, not an economy flight. These people were VERYhelpful. Fly Southwest! (At least I will sometimes)So we spent an unexpected night in Chicago. I had to return to my office onTuesday, which at that point had become impossible. I wanted to send aneMail to my company and the hotel manager offered the use of a WIndows PCwith internet access which they provide for company meetings etc. free ofcharge. The dial-up internet connection didn't work and I was told thatthis is due to the weather. (I think it was more likely due to thecombination of Dell, AOL and Microsoft XP). Could someone please tell theAvila people that I enjoyed their rooms very much, not really because ofthe bed, but because of the easy and FAST AND WORKING internet access.In our hotel I decided to use a public phone to call my mother and ask herto send the mail. In German we call this a "Medienbruch" which means "breakin media".While making the phone call I learned that one can no longer use coins (Ihad lots of quarters) to make international calls. The second thing Ilearned was that they do not accept VISA cards issued by non-US banks. Itwas hard to find that out because the voice-computer interrupted typing ofmy CC number with an inappropriate message like "you typed too fast" orsomething like that.Finally I managed to get my messages through and Toni suggested having abeer somewhere outside (around midnight). The temperature was very pleasantand the thunderstorms were gone so we took a walk and returned safe. Thatwas a night in Chicago, a town that didn't meet my expectations at all in apositive way!Monday:The next morning we woke up late so we had to hurry to leave the room intime.Our airline, SAS, was great and we got our tickets very fast and withoutany problems. The external 143 K 5,25" disk drive made the security peopleunpack and repack my suitcase but this was the only problem we had. Lastyear a friend told me that United Airlines messed up everyone's timing withtheir disorganized and exaggerated security. The Chicago airport was stillnot "user friendly" because it took too long to get to the gates.We were flying home, changed planes again in Sweden and returned toFrankfurt. We took a Taxi to get to Toni's car which he had parked in asmall town close to the airport. Remember what I wrote about Chicago: Noproblems, no soliciting, no unfriendly people, even no graffiti on thewalls or the trains.What happened to our parked car near Frankfurt? Two of our tires weredamaged! Of course we had one spare tire, but that was only half of thesolution. Beside being very tired (Toni can't sleep on airplanes) we becamevery angry because we lost some more time. Maybe this corrects your pictureof a peaceful and crime free Germany... like the recent trip corrected mypicture of Chicago.Another thing I learned at KFest beside the computer stuff was that everyone of you I met at KFest was not what we call a "typical American" overhere: Knowing all US presidents but knowing nothing about foreigncountries. Jim especially impressed me by knowing much more about Europeanhistory then I ever knew. Although I got the impression that some of youdon't like the political talks with him, I felt very comfortable (while notsharing his opinion in all subjects or being equally interested inhistorical issues because I always preferred being creative with computersor music). But now you see why I am so close to Jim: I write even longerthan he talks ;-)Thank you all for making this trip such a positive experience and excuse myerrors!Pictures and videoclips are almost finished and I will let you know whereto find them.I promise that no mail in the next 12 months will be as long as any of thelast 4.Feel free to contact me if I can be of help planning a trip to Europe.MarcusM.Staender, from Unna, Germany   eMail-Address      M.Staender @ t-online.de(KFest Mailing List)[EOA][KFF]------------------------------                       KFest 2004 |-----------------------------------[KF4]KansasFest 2004"""""""""""""""KansasFest 2004 is planned for July 20-25, 2004 at Avila University inKansas City, Missouri.(Heading: Cat 5, Top 22)[EOA][VKF]WATCH FOR MORE INFORMATION AT THE KFest HOME PAGE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KFest Home Pagehttp://www.kfest.org/[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
