Just two blocks long and one blockwide, this area was deeded to the city many years ago by the Beattiesisters to be used as a park.  Lets walk over and look around.     This is a very special time of the year.  The warm sunshine has teamedup with the chilled, dry breeze to dry the fallen leaves until they arecrisp.  The leaves crunch as you walk on them, sending a feeling throughyour body as if you were chewing a crisp lettuce salad.     Stately oak trees provide shade and a home for many squirrels inBeattie Park.  Over in one corner, near the river, a modest gazebo providesa vantage point for a fabulous view of the river.     The feature of this park are the four Indian Mounds built sometimebetween 500 BC and 1500 AD.  One of the mounds is in the shape of a turtle.Two others are conical in shape and one is linear in shape.     Here we have permanent evidence of the use of this land many yearsago.  But the exact reason(s) for the building these mounds is lost intime.                     History of the Apple II Computers                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     It is easy to think back in time to the various things you enjoyeddoing with the Apple II... and to overlook the desirability of creating arecord of how the hardware and software evolved over the years.     Fortunately someone has been working to record the history of theApple II's.

I needed to post and this is where I landedthough it's not where I intended to go.The problem is this: Under GSOS 6, I use AppleWorks GS with Pointless,Grappler + and Harmonie drivers to print documents to hp deskjet 640c.I've used this particular computer, a ROM 3 for at least 6 years. It's had3 RAM cards of 1, 8 and 4 meg RAM.  I've had 3 different hard drives. Thecurrent is a Focus that refuses to work in slot 7 but does fine in slot 6(this card showed the same characteristics in 2 other computers). This cpudidn't have a Transwarp for three years and now it does. TW's been upgradedto a 12.5 mhz. I've used 2 different HP deskjet printers. Printing has beenfairly trouble free with a few glitches.Now when I attempt to print a word processing document it tells me that theselect switch is off.  Nothing else happens.  I can hit open apple (.) andit goes back to the document and the program works okay. It's not freezing,just wont print. I also tested with Hermes and get the same message:  "TheSelect Switch is off"I transferred the hp to another computer and it prints the document fromAWGS ok so it seems the select switch is not on the hp.

I changed them to be identicaland that didn't make a difference.  One doesn't work and one does with thesame switch settings.I never touched the dip switches and I can't remember what I did under thehood that made the difference.I had this problem once before.  (I guess I still do on another ROM3 witha ZIPGSX.)  I had intended this to be the backup for the first system.  Ithas the same SCSI and grappler.  When I tested it for printing I got themessage - select switch not on.  I put in all the guts from the workingcomputer, the one I'm having problems with now - the grappler with cable,the hard drive and same printer got the same message- select switch off.I assumed at that time the select switch had to do with the ZiPGSX v 1.2.I got the thing without the software so I didn't have a way to go furtherinto checking slots setting.Where the heck is the select switch?Sandy(PHOENIX, Cat 2, Top 38, Msg 5)>>>>>"""""I'm wondering if the "select switch" isn't talking about what we used tocall "online" in printers.

I don'tappreciate how anti-Mac many PC users are, and don't feel the opposite isany better.The next meeting I went to was when they said they'd be demoing OS X (thiswas a few years ago), but it was instead a demonstration of OS X developertools, which interested me not at all.

It runs in three different speeds1mhz, 2.5(or so mhz) and full out.  Full out it runs at about 30mhz or so.It tends to run much better in full screen mode.  The best part about thisversion, is that you can run it in OS X, without any X Windows installed.It seems to only support 2MG files right now, so for me it is far fromprime time.  It does run an FTA demo (if you are into that sort of thing,I am not), and I got it to run Dungeon Master without much problem.  InDungeon Master, it wouldn't allow me to reorder my party, though.  That isdone with mouse click and drag, but none of the mouse options I triedseemed to let that work.  I haven't managed to boot to anything System 6,because all of my images for that are in Disk Copy format.It's always nice to see some progress on these emulators.  I hope whoeveris messing with this, will get a better image loading interface and somesupport for different disk image formats.I found the link at http://www.emulation.net   Which I believe is ran bysome guy who now works for Blizzard (of Warcraft, Star Craft fame).Dain Neater(A2.DAIN, Cat 29, Top 40, Msg 21)>>>>>"""""KEGS for OS X also has an interesting alternative type control panel (likethe one invoked by pressing control apple escape) that I think you activatewith control shift escape.

They can still be purchased from Alltech Electronics<http://www.allelec.com/indexa2.html">You can also buy the Focus card without a hard drive installed.  Or youmight want to install a higher capacity drive on one of the cards youalready own.Many people are upgrading their laptop computers by replacing the harddrive with one of higher capacity.  These "smaller" drives are on the usedmarket and are available for use on the Apple II's.What You Will Need''''''''''''''''''1. A Focus card.2. A 2.5 inch IDE hard drive mechanism.3. The Focus Utilities.  Most likely furnished with your Focus card.  Can   be downloaded from:   Alltech Electronics <http://www.allelec.com/indexa2.html">Where to Get What You Need''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Alltech Electronics <http://www.allelec.com/indexa2.html">2. LEM-Swap list <http://lowendmac.com/lists/swap.html>3. PC Liquidator  <http://www.pcliquidator.com/>4. Usenet... comp.sys.apple2.marketplace5. A2 on Syndicomm6. Thrift stores.7. Garage sales.Installing the Drive on the Focus Card''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Remove the card from the computer.2. Remove the four screws holding the hard drive in place.3. Carefully remove the drive from the card.4. Insert the new drive into the card, being careful not to bend any of the   connecting pins.  It will be obvious which way to turn the drive.5. Replace the four screws securing the drive to the card.6. Install the Focus card in the computer.7. Run the utilities.     a. Quite likely the utilities will insist that the new drive be low        level formated.     b. The utilities will suggest as many equal sized partitions, 32mb or        smaller, as will fit on the drive.  You might want to override the        suggestion.Example... when I installed a 750mb drive recently, the utilities suggested24 partitions.  A rather unwieldy number of icons on the IIgs desktop.Instead I created six 32mb ProDOS partitions and one large HFS partition.By having the same size partitions on all my drives, such as 32mb, I can doa volume to volume copy on the IIgs when backing up the data from one driveto another.Using the 'New' Drive'''''''''''''''''''''Install your software on the "new" drive and enjoy.[EOA]------------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------[SCD]SOFTWARE ON CDROM FOR THE Apple II""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Lyle,Great job detailing how to connect a SCSI CD-ROM to an Apple II.
