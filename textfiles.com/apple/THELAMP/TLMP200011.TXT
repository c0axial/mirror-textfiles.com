It and I am in no way related to thedistributors. Any opinions herein are entirely my own and shall not reflectupon any other person or association. This text is (C) copyright03-SEP-2000 Mike Thomas aka Phoenyx.

An Apple II CD collection }==--When I first saw the message concerning the soon to be released CD set, Iwas very excited. Having missed out on most of the online activity in theApple II world, I knew I had lost the chance at a plethora of interestingand useful information. I immediately went to the online order site andpurchased a set, in spite of the fact that I could put the $50 to betteruse. I waited in anticipation as the weekend dragged by, looking forward tothis treasure trove of unknown information. Finally, it arrived in the mailon Tuesday morning. After all the wait and eager anticipation, was Idisappointed?Actually, I was, just a bit at first. When I inserted the first CD andbrowsed the first few directories I noticed that many of the files weremessage groups. Having missed out on these early unions of Apple II users,I had no idea what to expect in this area. Many of them were simple 'Hi,how are you' sort of messages with very little useful content. I was alsodisappointed a bit later on when I discovered some of the files weredamaged and could not be opened. On top of that, some of the files werealso duplicated elsewhere in the collection. Considering the cost and howmuch $50 dollars means to my family, you should be able to understand mydisappointment.Considering the size of this collection and the time frame it covered, someduplication should be expected I guess. However, I also expected theeditors to put some effort in eliminating or at least reducing thisduplication and corrupted files. At least in a few of the more obviouscases.Not one to be daunted, I continued to peruse the files and even stopping awhile to read some of the more interesting messages. My disappointmentbegan to disappear when I started coming across messages which fit my owninterests, primarily programming, hardware info and utilities.I decided to stop reading for a while and check out some more of the CD'scontents before I got too engrossed in the messages. I hadn't even realizedhow much time had elapsed just in reading them, but it turns out I hadspent a couple of hours and still had many more to go. The wealth ofinformation in this set is beginning to become apparent. I began to feelmore at ease and decided to finish my initial, superficial investigationbefore passing judgment.Well, let me just say this. My initial reaction to the set was definitelyway off base. Even now, I am finding programs and info which are worth morethan the cost of the CD's. The combined worth is rather difficult tocalculate since each user must decide which of these files are useful tothem. For myself, I have already found things that I would have loved touse way back when. I have always been a bit disappointed at being unable toparticipate in the early A2 online groups. I now have some idea of thethings I missed out on. Sure, I managed to get by back then, since I had noknowledge of what was going on. Living in the boonies helped to shield mefrom being disappointed by not seeing what I was missing. I guess thatsometimes ignorance really is bliss.The set is nicely arranged in the order I assume the Genie system used. Itis fairly easy to find your way around, even for folks like me who havenever seen the original storage system. I would like to mention, I am setup with Balloon which is a big asset when browsing through archive setslike this. It would certainly be much more difficult if I had to open everyfile with GS Shrinkit. I managed to get lucky and found the Balloonarchiver on a diskazine in a collection of disks I picked up somewhere. Idon't know where it is available on the net, or even if it  is legallyavailable at all. Also, my Focus drive has been very helpful.  I hadalready partitioned it to just a few P8 partitions and one large  HFS onewhich I am using to unpack files for inspection. If you don't have thesecapabilities, don't be too disappointed just use whatever means you can toaccess those babies. Of course, it could be in the CD set and I haven't runacross it yet.At this point I am still perusing the file libraries on the second disk andenjoying every moment. I have not had a chance to return to the messageareas yet. In fact, I haven't gone back and checked many of the otherdirectories of the first CD. Yes, I'm sure there will be more of thosesimplistic messages. Having been a sysop of my own BBS, I know this isnormal for almost any group of people with little in common except thetopic of whatever message base they happen to be in. At this point I willnot be disappointed no matter what I find. The software on the second CDhas more than made up for the cost, even for a poor old country bumpkin'like myself.So guys and gals, do yourself a favor and point your browser the URL in theoriginal message and get your own. Even those with out a CD on their AppleII can still benefit as long as they have some method of reading a CD inHFS format. AFAIK, this is no problem for Linux or Beos users and I haveheard of a utility for Windows users also. Of course all you Mac owners areprobably smiling about now since you know you will have no trouble at allreading the CD's. That's ok, I'm doing just fine on my GS and I can stilluse my Linux box if necessary. Plus, I figure it might be one more reasonfor those Windows users to jump on the Linux or Beos band wagon. Who knows,all some of them need is just a little push.For those who missed the original message, here's the order URL again.http://order.kagi.com/?2ZMBTW, thanks guys. This has been one of the most useful things I havepurchased for my II's in a long time.Thank you for your time and interest. I hope it was helpfulor at least interesting.Phoenyx,Apple2 user since March 1984Links to Phoenyx's pages:preferred..... http://zip.to/Phoenyx_A2alternate..... http://www.tinyangeldesigns.com/Apple2[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA]------------------------------------      DISTILLATIONS FROM DELPHI A2 |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[SDA]STARTER DISKS AVAILABLE FROM A2Central.com""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""A2Central.com now shipping Apple II system and starter kit disks.A2Central.com is pleased to announce that effective immediately, we're ableto ship Apple II system software disks for US $2.00 per disk.

Through the use of Spectrum's External Commands andpowerful Scripting language, Spectrum add-on programs have been createdthat allow users to automate online sessions to Delphi with COG (Crock O'Gold), surf the world wide web with SIS (Spectrum Internet Suite), or sendand receive e-mail via SMTP and POP3 mail servers with SAM (SpectrumAutomated Mailer).Spectrum is the only program for the Apple IIGS that has been updated toprovide support for Internet access via TCP/IP, thereby freeing Spectrumusers from having to use an increasingly more difficult-to-find unix shellaccount!The latest version of Spectrum - v2.4 - requires System 6.0.1. Highlyrecommended are a hard disk drive and 4 megabytes of RAM.Some of Spectrum 2.4's advanced features include:     * Improved script execution speed.     * Optimize scripts by compiling them.     * Spectrum 2.4 and the XCMDs are Y2K compliant.     * Optional Serial or TCP/IP environment.     * Fully Integrated support for Marinetti 2.0.     * Integrated multi-socket Telnet function.     * Up to 32 simultaneous open TCP/IP connections.     * View HTML files directly from within Spectrum.     * Enhanced !Help!

It was my intent to gauge how many A2er's are  playing Silvern, as this remains the only incentive I have left to  develop A2 software <sigh>.

Run the SC.READER program under Basic.System (i.e. exit  Silvern) to view them. In addition, you can view all doc files.- The saved game format is no longer compatible with earlier versions,  because of this you must disband your party before installing SCv6.0.- The unique monster generator has been removed.- For those of you with the Second Sight card, pressing CTRL-Z after  exiting the GS control panel will now quickly restore the graphics screen  because Second Sight incorrectly restores the wrong hi-res page switch.- Speed-up maze plotting slightly.- Text Mode maze support is back.- Depending on level, monsters now have a higher chance to hit 2x per  attack.- Updated a few monsters to add some missing special abilities.- Using non-scroll LIGHT devices (i.e. torch or lanterns) in combat now are  interpreted as thrown flaming missile weapons, doing up to 12hp of damage  to one monster.New stuff:- SC now runs under MicroDot, the command shell interface replacement for  Basic.System.

This prevents discovering new item  attributes too easily!o Resize Roster/Update Datafiles now shows processing status.o The selection of weapons available to the monsters has been increased to  ALL possible types (except special weapons like dragon slayers) because  now I have enough free memory. Also, now there is a "preference" for  certain weapons by monster class (i.e. no more mighty fighters with  enchanted clubs!).o After using the combat weapon equip option, your original weapon is now  automatically equipped when combat is over (unless the new weapon is  cursed!).New Stuff:o Added 36 total new items! Some can be found in limited stock at the  store.o Added 3 total new device affects!o New Camp Inspect option: Equip W)eapon only.
