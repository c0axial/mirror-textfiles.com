Do they have one or more purposes? What are they?A serial card gives your Apple II a serial port, which is usually used forconnecting a modem or printer. This isn't really needed on a IIgs since ithas two built-in serial ports, but it comes in really handy on the otherApple II models.> 2. Are there more than one kind of Super Serial Card?Apple's Super Serial Card was the most popular. Going by memory, I thinkApplied Engineering had the Serial Pro. There were probably more, but Ican't think of them now.> 3. Is the Turbo ASB baud rate generator for the Super Serial Card part>    of the Super Serial Card or some kind of additional plug on card?It's a piggyback "daughterboard" that connects to the Super Serial Card.It takes the place of the 6551 chip, which is socketed on the Apple SuperSerial Card so it's very easy to install. The down side is that it sticksout a bit and blocks the adjacent slot.> 4. What exactly does the Turbo ASB baud rate generator do?It increases the serial card's baud rate to a theoretical maximum of230,400 bps. In practice, you'll find that 115,200 bps is about as fast asyou can go, and even that will require an accelerated (at least 8MHz) IIgs.Honestly, I'd say it's more of a "geek toy" that most people don't need.Most of the time I'm perfectly happy with the built-in 57600 bps IIgsserial port. Only when I'm downloading some insanely large amount of highlycompressible data (ie. text) do I use it at full speed. But I must say it'sfun to see download speeds in excess of 8000 cps on my IIgs. :) ------------------------------------------------------------------ Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager - Fri Mar 17, 2000 12:21:01 am [Delivered with Spectrum v2.3 and Crock O' Gold v3.3](TONYW1, 30173, GO COM A2)[EOA][SCG]SILVERN CASTLE, role-playing game"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Has anyone attempted the new "Expanded Scenario" included with SCv3.0?

SAM will then read any waiting mail frommultiple POP3 mail servers for all of your online e-mail accounts. Onceoffline, SAM lets you read and reply to your new e-mail, and if NiftySpellinstalled, SAM will even spell check your e-mail messages. SAM has theability to decode attached mail files, and it will even display HTML codethat is sent through e-mail.Additionally, SAM lets you file mail you want to keep in multiple personalmailboxes, and to optionally attach multiple files to any outgoingmessages. Housekeeping features let you manage your archives, and apowerful search engine lets you search through these saved files.SAM requires Spectrum 2.3 or later, Marinetti 2.0 or later, and to use SAMto send and receive Internet e-mail, you must have an account with anInternet Service Provider with which Marinetti can connect (SLIP or PPP).(Note: An updater program is included with SAM which will update Spectrum2.2 to 2.3)SAM was written by Ewen Wannop, the author of Spectrum and Crock O'Gold,and it is available exclusively through Shareware Solutions II for $15.To purchase SAM by credit card over the Internet, visit Shareware SolutionsII's online store at: http://order.kagi.com/?zs3To purchase SAM by mail, send a check or money order in US Funds for $15to:Joe KohnShareware Solutions II166 Alpine StSan Rafael, CA 94901For information about purchasing Spectrum or updating to Spectrum v2.2,visit:http://www.myesource.com/sevenhills/applesoftware/iigs/sp.htm(JOE_KOHN, 30523, GO COM A2)[EOA][JGS]JUICED.GS DELAYED TO INCLUDE SCOOP!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hey gang,A funny thing happened last week on the way to the printer with a new issueof Juiced.GS.

How do I store the pathname "/H2/PROGRAMS/" so that Ican return to where I have my programs.Yes, I can write the program pathname into the actual lines of BASIC, butthen if I change my program location to something else, like"/H2/NEW.PROGRAMS/" I'd have to go into all of the programs and change thelines of programming. That isn't efficient.Should I write a text file on the disc which would contain the pathname ??But where would it be written -- in what pathname ?Or, is there a way to POKE the pathname into some memory location, and thenchange the HI or LO MEM locations so that the pathname is protected frombeing overwritten or erased by other programs being written but still ableto be retrieved by PEEK commands ??If this is the way to go how would I do this ??ThanksStan Sztaba(SSZTABA, 2951, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""This is off the top of my head, but couldn't you write a text file thatsays something like:print chr$(4);"prefix /hard1/subdir1/" and have your other program EXECthat text file?Alternatively, if you have a number of variables that you want saved, whynot use a STORE command to save them all, then a RESTORE command to, um,restore them?-Gareth(GARETH, 2956, GO COM A2P)<<<<<"""""You could just use the PREFIX command in your BASIC code directly.

There are a few ways you can handle this.First, you could reserve an area of memory among your programs in which youstuff the old prefix, like:10 REM Save prefix20 PRINT CHR$(4);"PREFIX"30 INPUT PFX$40 L = LEN(PFX$)50 POKE 768,L60 FOR I=1 TO L70 POKE 768+I,ASC(MID$(PFX$,I,1))80 NEXT IThen you can restore the prefix from the subprogram using:10 REM Restore prefix20 PFX$=""30 L = PEEK(768)40 FOR I=1 TO L50 PFX$=PFX$+CHR$(PEEK(768+I))60 NEXT I70 PRINT CHR$(4);"PREFIX ";PFX$As long as the subprogram doesn't use the memory in page $300, this willwork fine.The other option is to create a temporary file containing the prefixstring.Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net(SHEPPY, 2970, GO COM A2P)<<<<<"""""> All variables are cleared with the RUN of a new program.If you use CHAIN instead, variables won't clear and the values are usedbetween programs.Geoff(SISGEOFF, 2972, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""In message 'How save pathnames ??' SSZTABA said:> For a long time I've been wondering how to go about saving somewhere in> memory the pathname of my programs, so that I can come back and access> the programs as needed, while still retaining the same prefix which> points to the specific data files.Here is my take on the situation. You seem to have a number of programsthat call each other in a certain directory and they access data in anotherdirectory and you want to be able to access the data and still be able tojump around between programs.It seems to me the easiest way to do this is to not change the prefix atall. If all your programs that will call each other will always be in thesame directory and you don't change the prefix, then you can just do aPRINT CHR$(4);"RUN PROGRAM2" which will run PROGRAM2 from the currentprefix setting. To access your data, don't change the prefix. Instead use acommand like PRINT CHR$(4);"OPEN";DP$;"DATA1" where DP$ is the prefix ofyour data directory (ie. /HD/DATA/). If you are using variables for thedata file's name you could just add the prefix of the data directory to thebeginning of that variable. Instead of DF$="DATA1" you could do aDF$=DP$+"DATA1" and use the command PRINT CHR$(4);"OPEN";DF$ to open it.If you need to remember the data directory between programs you could justwrite it to a text file and read it in at the beginning of each program.PRINT CHR$(4);"OPEN DATADIR":PRINT CHR$(4);"WRITE DATADIR":PRINT DP$:PRINTCHR$(4);"CLOSE DATADIR" to create the file and PRINT CHR$(4);"OPENDATADIR":PRINT CHR$(4);"READ DATADIR":INPUT DP$:PRINT CHR$(4);"CLOSEDATADIR" to get the directory data.However, there are better ways to have multiple programs interact with eachother.First, as has been mentioned, there is the STORE and RESTORE commands.Instead of just doing a PRINT CHR$(4);"RUN PROGRAM2" do a PRINTCHR$(4);"STORE VARS" command first and then do a PRINT CHR$(4);"RESTOREVARS" at the beginning of PROGRAM2 to get those variables back. This wayyou can transfer the value of DP$ as well as any other variables that youmight need.Another way to do this sort of thing is with the CHAIN command. Instead ofusing RUN to start the next program, use PRINT CHR$(4);"CHAIN PROGRAM2".This will run PROGRAM2 but leaves all the variables that were set in thefirst program in memory so PROGRAM2 can access them. However, there havebeen a number of bugs with the CHAIN command in the past and I'm notentirely sure they've all been fixed. Someone else would have to comment onthat.By the way, if you do want to know the directory that the current programwas started from, you can use the method already posted. PRINTCHR$(4);"PREFIX":INPUT PF$ If you need to pass this directory on to thesecond program (because it is in another directory or something) you havethe three choices I gave you above to pass the information. However, havingprogram segments in multiple directories isn't considered good programmingpractice. :-) Jeff Blakeney Dean of the Apple II University in the A2Pro forum(JBLAKENEY, 2973, GO COM A2P)[EOA][TEL]------------------------------- Apple II USER GROUPS TELECONFERENCE|------------------------------------By Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>     Two Apple II user groups held a joint meeting on Thursday, April 13,2000.  This happened even though the two groups were more than a hundredmiles apart during the meeting.     The Aurora Area Apple Core of Aurora, Illinois, USA moved theirmeeting to Kinkos in the neighboring town of Naperville to take advantageof the Kinkos Video Conferencing facility.  At the same time theAppleByters of the Quad Cities in Illinois/Iowa, USA met at the VideoConferencing facility at Augustana College in Rock Island.  (One of theQuad Cities.)     Conversation included talk of Kfest, software used, user grouplibraries, and suggestions for a joint meeting sometime in the future withboth groups at the same location about half way between the home bases.[EOA][NFE]-------------------------------OFF LINE READERS... NOT FOR EVERYONE|------------------------------------By Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>     The Laser 128 with 384K of RAM and one 5.25 disk drive was my firstonline computer.  People were using OLRs (Off Line Readers) on GEnie.There was no extra disk space or RAM for me to use an OLR.     So I developed some bare-bones scripts and learned my way aroundGEnie.  TIC (Talk is Cheap) would stop and save the buffer to disk when thebuffer was full.  There was room on that 140K disk for a 40K buffer save inaddition to the software necessary to run TIC!     Then while the buffer was filling for the second time I would take outthat disk and substitute an empty disk named TIC... room enough on that onefor three buffer saves!     Then offline to read all that, write replies, etc.  So I got in thehabit of wondering around GEnie that way and liked it.  I have used thesame approach to getting around Delphi.     I think of using an OLR as being like a bus trip.  You get there andget the job done using someone elses guidance.  Using bare-bones scriptslets you change your mind as to where you are going and when.  More like anautomobile trip with you in the driver's seat.     I was able to get an accelerator for my IIgs because I was using thosescripts.  I had set in motion the script to visit seven Delphi forums,collecting new messages at each stop.  When the display stopped for amoment in the A2 forum I noticed that someone had posted a message offeringa ZipGS for sale.  I aborted the script and wrote up an email response tothat message and mailed it while I was still online.  I finally was thefirst in line to accept an offer of an accelerator for sale!     So there you have it... Some people thrive on the use of an OLR.Others, like myself, like to get around by ourself.[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
