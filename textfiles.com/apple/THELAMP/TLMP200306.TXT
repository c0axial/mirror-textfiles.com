A stone path winds through plantings of many species offlowering plants... a succession of beautiful color from early Springthough late Fall.     A bench beneath a stately shade tree invites one to rest awhile.  Thesmall table with seating for two inspires planning a picnic for you and afriend.     This small park was developed and is maintained by volunteers from aneighborhood improvement association.  A fine example of what can beaccomplished by dedicated volunteers.     The casual observer could easily overlook the work of volunteers inmaking KFest happen.     Over sixty people have registered for KFest 2003.  You, too, can takeadvantage of efforts of the volunteers who are making KFest happen.

If you try this you will notice that everything is totallysuspended.  Upon releasing the reset key a seven cycle wait happens duringwhich time the processor initializes itself and retrieves the reset addresscontained at $FFFC & $FFFD.Everything above is specific to the 6500 series of microprocessors and notApple II itself.  The same happens in any machine (Commodore 64, etc) usingthis series of processor.From here the processor basically does a JMP ($FFFC) and this is where theApple II specific part takes over.  In an Apple ][ plus or IIe (what Ihappen to have handy to check) $FFFC and $FFFD contains "62 FA" so the 6502in effect does a JMP $FA62.  Here the following happens within theautostart ROM:- flips the soft switches which control video to display page 1 text  mode with low resolution off.- Opens the text window to its full (24x40) size and places the output  cursor to the bottom of the screen.- sets video to normal mode.- sets COUT and KEYIN to use the internal keyboard and video display.- flips annunciators 0 and 1 ON and annunciators 2 and 3 OFF on the  Game I/O connector.- clears the keyboard strobe.- turns off any I/O Expansion ROM.- sounds a "beep!"Following this sequence it checks for a valid Soft Entry Vector located at$3F2-$3F3.  If invalid it assumes a cold restart is required which involvesclearing the screen and putting "APPLE ][" or "Apple //e" at the top of thescreen and then scan the slots for a valid boot device. If the Soft EntryVector is valid then a JMP ($3F2) is executed. Normally this vectorcontains the warm start address for either Applesoft,  DOS or ProDOS.The Soft Entry Vector is the earliest point where I can interrupt the resetcycle and return control to my program.  This sequence also shows me that Ihave to keep all of the above in mind when doing so since (mostparticularly my video) settings have changed and almost for certain myregisters and stack pointers are trashed.REFERENCES:===========- SY6500/MCS6500 Microprocessor Family Programming Manual   August 1976 MOS Technology, Inc.- Apple II Reference Manual   1979 Apple Computer, Inc. Mark Percival - Apprentice Delivered by Spectrum v2.5.1 & SOAR v1.0b10 The Apple ][ Fanatic and Wednesday Night RTC Host "Midweek Madness!" from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM Pacific Time(MARK, Cat 51, Top 3, Msg 5)>>>>>"""""Historically the idea was always that you could *trap* the reset key, notsuppress it. So typically the reset key would cause the program to restart(in some cases literally!) at a known "checkpoint" such as the main menu inan application, or the beginning of the current level in a game.The usual idea is that trapping the reset key is a part of the copyprotection process. If it isn't needed for copy protection, then you couldargue that by definition the reset key should be allowed to "reset" - inother words to recover when something goes wrong.

Humor is good medicine, if you don't mind that old phrasebeing repeated once again. I'd sooner tell a funny story, or relate aclever parody, than to get sober and serious and have to deliver bad news.Yet, as I tried to come up with some upbeat introduction to this edition ofmy review of the Lamp publications, I just could not find the right tone tomake it sound positive. Several great events happened for the Apple II in1994, the year that we covered last time. But as I reviewed the monthlyissues for 1995, it just seemed that there were fewer things that happenedthat were favorable for the A2 world.Part of this was the realignment of the producers of Apple II hardware andsoftware, as the available customer base continued to contract, whichcaused a reduction of those producers, and continued the cycle.Perhaps some of the sobering events in the outside world were reflectingonto the decreased energy in the A2 RoundTable. The federal building inOklahoma City was destroyed by a powerful car bomb in April. The provinceof Quebec defeated a referendum on independence from Canada by only a verynarrow margin. The deadly Ebola virus hit the country of Zaire in Africa.Sun Microsystems introduced Java, with microprocessor-independent "applets"in May. Internet mania continued to build, as a small bookseller namedAmazon.com opened business in July. Netscape announced its initial publicoffering (IPO), which doubled in value during its first day on the stockmarket. Microsoft "Bob" was released as a more user-friendly interface forMicrosoft Windows 3.1. Microsoft Windows 95 also became available, and soldover one million copies during its first four days on the market. And as ifthey weren't busy enough, Microsoft formed an alliance with NBC, creatingthe cable news channel MSNBC.Over at Apple Computer, the PowerPC 603e was released, with a 100 MHzspeed. Power Computing released the first Mac clones, with militantadvertising campaigns promising to help "kick Intel's ass". Few othercompanies were licensed to produce Macintosh clones, leading many toquestion Apple's commitment to allow other companies to make Macs.GENIELAMP INFOEditor Doug Cuff continued to produce a quality issue of GEnieLamp A2 eachmonth, but his scope became more constricted by the declining number ofcontributing writers. The September issue saw Charlie Hartley's final"Treasure Hunt" column; Cuff ultimately added this to his own list ofthings to do and continued it his own. Also, Susie Oviatt's final "ASCIIArt" picture appeared that same month.In addition to his usual responsibilities of collecting interestingpostings from the A2 RoundTable and doing the final assembly of thenewsletter, Cuff also found it necessary to contribute more or his ownarticles for the newsletter. These included an introduction to using theInternet from GEnie, Lynx and VT100-compatible telecommunication programs,and software reviews. He did the "Treasure Hunt" column in June and thenfor the final three months of the year, and wrote the last "PAUGNewsletter" for the year.General Electric Information Services (GEIS), the organization that ownedthe computers on which the GEnie service ran, made a worrisome announcementat the end of the year. Their press release stated that they were lookingfor a buyer for GEnie, but among A2 denizens it was not as yet clearwhether this would be a good or bad thing in the long run.ROUNDTABLE NEWSSusan MacGregor became the Chief Sysop for the A2 RoundTable, with TomZuchowski as her assistant. Lunatic E'Sex became Chief of Apple IIOperations on GEnie over both the A2 and A2Pro RT's. Hangtime remained theA2Pro Chief Sysop. Gina Saikin became the A2 RTC manager.Richard Bennett of Australia was progressing in his development of an AppleIIGS front-end program for GEnie. Bennett had been mentioned in GEnieLampA2 in the past for his freeware Finder Extension, "Scarabaeidae", as the A2Special Projects coordinator, and for his giving a talk at KansasFest in1993. The June issue of GEnieLamp published the results of a poll forpossible names for the new program. The top choice was "Jasmine GS". Theproduct was ready for an initial preview by KansasFest in July, which waspresented by Bennett and Nate Sloan.HARDWARE NEWSSome Apple IIGS ROM 03 discoveries were posted in the A2 RT, and reproducedin GEnieLamp. The January issue mentioned that the keyboard "mouse key"feature in the ROM 03 supported use of a two-button mouse. Also, an A2 RTmember named Fred Starkey had found a IIGS with some non-standard ROM chipsin it, and which displayed "Turbo->28" at the top of the screen instead of"Apple IIgs" when booting. Sheppy recognized it as a prototype ROM 03 IIGS.The Second Sight VGA card and TurboRez cards continued development, vyingfor position in the market for alternatives to Apple IIGS RGB monitors. ByJune, the Second Sight card was finally getting to the hands of end users,who were in general quite happy with the result. Several software companiescommitted to working on making their products compatible with the new card.Also discussed were issues of compatibility with certain original graphicsmodes on the IIGS.Iomega's Zip 100 drive with the RamFAST SCSI controller was evaluated andresults posted in the May issue. In September, though not a formal review,Tony Morales posted comparisons between the Zip 100 with the new SyQuestEZ135 cartridge drive.SOFTWARE NEWSSales of Apple II software continued to soften during 1995, with some newproducts but few major innovations making an appearance. As before, we'lllook at them by category.:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::The AppleWorks 5.0 upgrade was released in December 1994, with an update to5.1 in April to correct some major bugs in the database module. AuthorRandy Brandt made several posts about various bugs that were identified andhow to correct them. Kitchen Sink Software released a Macintosh program"AppleWorks to Rich Text Format (RTF)", which made it easier to translateAppleWorks word processing files to use on that platform. Brandt also madecreated some excitement with announcement of a project code-named PhoenixII, which was an AppleWorks-only emulator for the Macintosh. This productwas released later in the year, with the name "Deja II".Emulator interest extended to Tony Morales, who planned a PowerPC-basedIIGS emulator, which was code-named "Hindenburg".Will Nelken of Marin Macroworks announced HotKeys I (later calledTouchTwo), a TimeOut and macro add-on for AppleWorks 5.0 and 5.1. OfficeProductivity Software also promised updates to their TimeOut Statistics andTimeOut ShrinkIt Plus programs.The Byte Works updated Quick Click Calc to v1.2, and also released theQuick Click Morph, the second in the Quick Click series. Animasia 3-D, ananimation program written by Michael Lutynski, finally began to ship.Your Money Matters author Steve Peterson decided to NOT release a newversion of the program, but rather to discontinue further development onit. He did choose to release it to the Lost Classics Project, so it wouldnot disappear forever.Seven Hills Software gave out a little more info about the coming update toGraphicWriter III, announcing support for XCMDs to extend its usefulness,similar to the way in which Spectrum could be extended. By the end of theyear, it was ready to ship. They also released SuperConvert 4.0, an updateto Jason Harper's classic IIGS graphic conversion utility.:: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::Seven Hills also kept Ewen Wannop busy, with a version 2.0 update toSpectrum in January 1995. This was also made available in some specialbundles involving Balloon (an NDA that unpacks ShrinkIt archives) from EGOSystems, as well as Talking Tools from The Byte Works. Also, several newXCMD extensions were released to use with that program.FAXination, Vitesse's fax software for the IIGS was shipped in mid-January,though there were some early problems with bugs that had to be sorted out.Vitesse also claimed to still be close to finishing the IIGS port ofWolfenstein 3D (see below).Just to keep some competition in the market, Parkhurst Micro Productscontinued work on PMPFax, which was ready for beta testing in July, andbegan to ship in December.InTrec began shipment of its new ProTerm Mac product in March.Derek Taubert began to make news with his work on a TCP stack to use on theIIGS, which would make it possible to use new methods of connection to theInternet at large, without the need of using a gateway such as the one thatGEnie was beginning to implement. (If you recall, I made an analogypreviously in this column about online services being like cities. Therewere no roads to connect these cities to each other at all, but some dirtpaths had been created to start making such connections possible. Taubert'sTCP stack would be akin to digging a hole under the city wall, and beingable to hitch a ride on the highway outside of that wall, regardless ofwhether or not the city was ready to allow such traffic.) By August, GS-TCPwas supposed to be progressing from beta versions, but little more washeard about it for the rest of the year.:: SYSTEM SOFTWARE ::Brutal Deluxe programmer Olivier Zardini announced his work on a 6.0.2version of GS/OS, based on his disassembly of it. He had planned to haveBrutal Deluxe work on correcting bugs, and possibly enhancing it in somesmall ways. This effort was not well received, however, by some experiencedprogrammers in the U.S. who stated that they didn't feel that Brutal Deluxehad the skills necessary to patch and update System 6.0.1 to anything else.:: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::Sheppy announced continued work on his version 2.0 update to Shifty List.EGO Systems introduced the ICE icon editor. Peter Watson was beginning workon a GUI version of his MSDOS Utilities. Bret Victor made his debut in theApple IIGS world with the release of Opening Line, his GS/OS boot-up splashscreen enhancer. AutoArk, a disk compression utility, was updated to v1.1by EGO Systems.Greg Templeman released II Not Disturb. This utility kept other processeson the computer from interrupting data transmission at higher baud rates.:: GAMES ::Vitesse made a December 1994 announcement (which appeared in the January1995 issue): "We're just wrapping up Wolfenstein 3D and should beginshipping within the next two weeks." They were a bit too optimistic aboutthis schedule, however, and delays began to crop up. The programmer (BillHeineman) found himself being unable to allocate sufficient time to boththis game and another project; later there were some contractual problemswith the holders of the copyright.  Furthermore, some problem developedbetween Heineman and Vitesse, which made it impossible for him to continueto work on the project. By August, Vitesse was still hoping it would becompleted "soon", but it was not to be. However, late in the year Vitessestated that they had been unable to get Heineman to complete his work onthe game, and that they would have to cancel the project. This greatlydisappointed many who had eagerly anticipated it and those (like ScottEverts, who did the artwork) who helped with the work on it. (Ultimately,the game did not see final completion until 1998, and then after completionby a different programmer than Heineman, and as a freeware product insteadof the $39.95 price that Vitesse had originally.)Somewhat fitting into the game category was the Megademo by Germany'sNinjaforce. This demo required an accelerated IIGS, but there were problemswith it for users of some 3.5 inch drives.Charlie Hartley featured some of the best Eamon adventures in the Mayissue, along with an interview of Eamon-man Tom Zuchowski.PUBLICATIONSMuch of the discouraging news that came out during 1995 was in the loss ofsome long-running Apple II publications. It began in March with theannouncement of the final collapse of Resource Central and ICON, and thediscontinuation of A2-Central, which was by this time a disk-onlypublication. Doug Cuff had also been editor of that publication, and gaveit a fitting obituary in his GEnieLamp A2 editorial that month. TomWeishaar also posted his own thoughts about the end of his publishingefforts.TimeOut Central, also gone with the loss of Resource Central, wasre-released in the form of back issues through the help of former editorWill Nelken.The AppleWorks Forum ceased publication in November, as NAUG (NationalAppleWorks User Group) shut down. Their back issues and disks wereultimately made available through Shareware Solutions II.Adding to the bad news was the final issue of GS+ Magazine in August.Editor Steve Disbrow's final editorial was reproduced in the Septemberissue of GEnieLamp A2. Although the magazine was going to stop, Disbrowstated that he wanted to keep the EGO Systems programming business goingfor as long as was possible.Softdisk Publications notified its subscribers that Softdisk, theiroriginal disk publication, would stop publication with issue #166. SoftdiskG-S was to continue publication until further notice.II Alive announced that there would be six more issues of the magazineuntil they stopped publication. Jerry Kindall, who had been involved withthe magazine from the start, also announced that he was no longer going tobe working with Quality Computers. He made it clear that there was noanimosity between himself and Quality in making this decision. Doug Cuffbriefly was managing editor of the magazine (for just two issues). Theyalso changed their publishing schedule to quarterly.On the other hand, Joe Kohn's Shareware Solutions II proudly passed the1,000 subscriber mark, and was being distributed to all 50 states in theU.S. In July, Kohn announced that Cynthia Fields' "A+ Home Organizer" wouldbe available exclusively through SSII. Kohn also announced plans todistribute back issues of Script-Central, the HyperCard-basedmagazine-on-disk formerly sold through Resource Central. SSII also extendedits activities to the sales of some of the Big Red Computer Club'smerchandise, Convert 3200. In addition, Steve Disbrow agreed to contributearticles to SSII.PowerGS Diskazine by Auri Rahimzadeh announced an interview with SteveWozniak in issue #5. Auri also had the opportunity to work for Wozniakduring the summer, helping create web pages for Woz's web server.COMPANIESThe Big Red Computer Club decided to stay open during at least part of1995, while owner John Wrenholdt was making changes to allow him to marketsoftware for the Macintosh.Office Productivity Software cut back on most of its Apple II business,again due to insufficient sales to justify full activity in making updatesthat were compatible with AppleWorks 5.0.DigiSoft finally began to sell its Golden Orchard CD of Apple II software.Quality Computers, also hit by the decline in sales of Apple II products,posted in July some responses to comments made about their efforts to moveinto other platforms. They were accused of phasing out the Apple II inorder to make money on something else. Quality's response was that theywere adding other products in order to survive as a company and be ABLE tocontinue to support the Apple II as it had been doing. The post alsoacknowledged the difficulty they had in handling II Alive's subscriptionbase, when their primary business was a mail order catalog. Then in theAugust issue it was announced that Quality Computers had been sold toScantron Corporation, and renamed to Scantron Quality Computers.Softdisk Publishing, possibly as the result of the closing down of Softdiskmagazine, lost the services of Greg Templeman, as he left to work withLogicware, a game publishing company.The Byte Works had a house-cleaning sale to get rid of old printed manualsfor their products.As mentioned above, The National AppleWorks User Group closed operations inNovember 1995.KANSASFESTWith the downfall of Resource Central/ICON, the continuation of the annualA2-Central Summer Conference (which ICON had sponsored) was in question.But enthusiasts of the event decided that they would do whatever wasnecessary to make it happen. These dedicated people, including AuriRahimzadeh, Cindy Adams, Gina Saikin, and Mark Kline started the effort.Paul Parkhurst of Parkhurst Micro Systems sponsored it, and the eventdeveloped a life of its own. By May 1995, it was official that the eventwould be held. In June, editor Doug Cuff posted info about the newlyestablished KFest Internet mailing list, and how to access it from GEnie.The planned festivities included a roast of Steve Dizbrow of GS+ Magazine,and a keynote address by Roger Wagner. During the event, Mike Westerfielddemonstrated Quick Click Morph, Joe Kohn had a "fireside chat", discussinghis involvement with the Apple II business, and "Internet: The Good, TheBad, and The Ugly". Ryan Suenaga (attending for the first time) presentedsessions about PDA's and PowerBooks. Dave Ciotti and Doug Pendletondiscussed soldering techniques for electronics. Roger Wagner hosted theannual "Bite The Bag" competition and provided a late night pizza and sodafestival.Even Apple Computer attended the event, and introduced some of the newMacintosh computers that would be released in the fall.REVIEWSAs mentioned above, Doug Cuff wrote a review of Quick Click Calc 1.2, aswell as gave an overview and review of Apple II terminal programs thatsupport VT100 display mode. He also reviewed the new Vitesse product,FAXination. Also appearing in GEnieLamp during the year was Bill Quinn'sreview of the Zip 100 drive.WRITERSCharlie Hartley continued presenting his Treasure Hunt column up throughSeptember, presenting the best of the files in the GEnie A2 library, fromanimation files for the IIGS through SoundSmith music.Gina Saikin irregularly contributed the PAUG (Planetary Apple User Group)newsletter column during the year. In March, Dave Johnson did the writingfor the newsletter, and David Kerwood took up the task in June, September,and October. Ray Pasold took up the task in November, and finally Doug Cuffdid the newsletter in December.Phil Shapiro continued his "Thinking About Online Communications" serieswith columns about online romance; e-mail communication between students,teachers, and parents; the concept of "notching" (one e-mail or forummessage building on another, and branching out into other directions);online friendships; and personal web pages. He also began to look for apublisher for a collection of twenty of his columns.Jay Curtis wrote several articles about AppleWorks 5 and the comingMac-based AppleWorks emulator. Kevin Noonan wrote about the Apple II inAustralia in the May issue.As part of remembering the ninth anniversary of the release of the AppleIIGS, Ryan Suenaga and others helped promote a campaign to remind Appleabout the many Apple II users who still existed, despite their non-statuswith the company. They did this by sending in their "Tell Apple"registration cards, but telling about the IIGS. Most of the replies peoplegot back appeared to be form letters.Our favorite telephone tech and prolific A2 RoundTable / Delphi A2 Forum /Syndicomm A2Central poster, Carl Knoblock, made his first appearance inGEnieLamp during 1995 with a comment about a memory leak associated withBalloon, and about KansasFest.INTERVIEWSFewer of these appeared during 1995, but included the following:o Susan MacGregor, new Chief Sysop of the A2 RTo Doug Cuff, by Charlie Hartleyo Tom Zuchowski, by Charlie Hartleyo John Van Dam (Froggie), by Charlie HartleyMISCELLANEOUS FEATURESGary Utter and Michael (Animasia) wrote a list in the November issue ofways in which GS/OS was still better than the Mac OS.HUMOR ONLINEThe Pentium math error problem continued to be a source of merriment.Terrell Smith poked more fun at it in the form of a "FAQ" about it for hisoffice mates who had PC's.Doug Cuff and I had a written two Apple II Top Ten Lists: "Reasons TheApple IIe is Better Than The IIGS" and "Reasons the Apple II Plus is BetterThan The IIe or IIGS". This had appeared in one of the last issues ofA2-Central. Microsoft, often a focus of humorous posts in the A2 RT, had two featuresappear. Andrew Burke poked fun at Microsoft's "Bob" software with a storyabout Microsoft "Joe-Bob" software for those of the redneck persuasion."Litigation '95" was announced, a new program from Microsoft to aid peopleor companies who wanted to sue Microsoft. It included Litigation Builder,Suit Wizards, and more.Other humor stories included a poem about computers in the style of Dr.Suess; a list of Top Ten Computer light bulb jokes; a registration card fora McDonnell-Douglas aircraft missile system ("please check a box indicatingwhere this product will be used"); Murphy's laws for computer; and aDecember poem by Marty Knight, "A Visit From Saint Woz" (parodying theclassic "Visit From Saint Nicholas").Humor also appeared in posts to the A2 RoundTable. In July, Greg Templemanrelated a story about a disk duplicator, which ejected a disk so brisklythat it flew over, hit the switch on the power strip, and shut itself off.STATSHere are statistics for the first four years of GEnieLamp.

This is especially true if you are using anaccelerator.As a temporary expedient you might try operating it with the cover off.A somewhat neater trick with the IIgs is to lay the power supply on thedesk back of the computer, feed the lead through the back, and connect itto the IIgs.Operating the computer this way moves the heat produced by the power supplyoutside the case.In the future we will discuss other methods of keeping the Apple II cool.[EOA]YOU ARE INVITED"""""""""""""""You are invited to submit your favorite Tinkerer's Project for the Apple IIcomputers.Send your write up or idea to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------LETTER TO THE EDITOR""""""""""""""""""""Fri, 16 May 2003From: Donald LeeTo: Lyle Syverson, Editor, The Lamp!Subject: Apple II HistoryGood Evening,Well, I guess I'll just add a letter to the editor for "The Lamp!"It's great you guys are reviewing the history of the Apple II and GenieLampespecially the past year of 1994.1994 (and later in 1995) was the year that I realized my Apple IIe was morethan just a regular home computer.  The classes I took at my junior college(basic word processing, spreadsheet, database) showed me what a PC coulddo.  But I had Appleworks and discovered what I learned in my class couldtranslate.  In fact, if someone still has their issues of II Alive, I notedthat in a letter to the editor.Despite the fact that Apple II's were formally discontinued, in 1994, myten year old Apple IIe was definitely still alive and in use.Perhaps I should save this for your next issue, but in 1995, after I hadtransferred to a 4 year university, I discovered the wonders of theInternet (email, browsing, newsgroups).  Sometime after that (late 1995 orearly 1996) I purchased a modem for my Apple IIe and began my journeyonline.And what a journey it has been.  Though my IIe finally died on me a fewyears ago (it still works, but the video can't be seen) and I don't useApple II programs anymore, I have toyed with the idea of picking up a usedIIe or IIGS to mess with some of the old games I still have at home.THe Apple IIe was one of the big blessings in my life and I feel I am allthe better for it!Donald=====Donald C.

When was the last time KFest attendees actually needed threefloors.  The first year I was at KFest was in 1996--I think I remember thesoccer kids were on 4 and KFest attendees were on 5 and 6.  Were there anyKFest attendees also on 4?  Or was I just confusing 1997 with 1996?Nevertheless, it is incredible to see the surge of attendance this year.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 5, Top 5, Msg 58)>>>>>""""">> When was the last time KFest attendees actually needed three floors. <<Not sure but 3 floors were probably required in '95 (80 attendees) or '96(73 attendees). Don't remember how Avila sandwiched us in those years - butcould look it up:)What matters is the surge and interest THIS year. Incredibly exceptionalpeople were attracted to the Apple II. They represent a very specialcommunity and preserving this unique "mindset" is probably one of the mostimportant aspects of KFest.I don't think I care too much about which computer you are now using (withperhaps a few exceptions), it's the special person that you are byattending that's most important!Steve(KFESTSTEVE, Cat 5, Top 5, Msg 62)>>>>>"""""According to my room list from '95, we only had 2 floors.
