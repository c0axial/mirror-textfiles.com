Within the first two weeks ofits release, its author, Eric Shepherd, registered in excess of _twothousand_ downloads from his World Wide Web page.  This doesn't include anydownloads from Genie, Delphi, or anywhere else, nor does it count copiesthat have been or will be distributed by user groups or other Apple IIvendors.  Not only is this an unbelievable number for an Apple II programin this day and age, it's an astounding number for any computer platformfor such a short period of time.     It was exciting for me to be part of Sheppy's beta team as Wolfapproached completion, and absolutely thrilling to see the download countrise and rise and rise.     At the same time, the Apple II community was showing less vigorelsewhere.  Renewals to the few remaining Apple II publications have lookeddown so far this year, and one, _The Apple Blossom_ (to which I regularlycontribute) has decided this volume will be its last.  All around, it seemsshareware fees to our loyal programmers are down, and the spirit ofcommunity seems to be lacking.     The hard questions beg to be asked: if 2,000 Apple IIgs users on the'Net can download the most highly anticipated game in recent memory, whydon't we have more subscribers to _Shareware Solutions II_ or _Juiced.GS_?Why is _The Apple Blossom_ ending its run?  Why are our shareware authorsstruggling to justify another Apple II project?  Sadly, while the Apple IIappears alive on the 'Net, its vital signs elsewhere appear weak.     Still, two thousand downloads is an exciting number, and hopefullythose two thousand files translate into two thousand excited Apple II userswho will keep the faith well into the next century and do what they need todo to keep Apple II support alive.     In the meantime, I'll continue to check for vital signs from time totime, and keep an eye out for other signs of Apple II Life on the 'Net.                                [*] [*] [*]     While Wolf was unquestionably the Apple II story of the month inFebruary, it was far from the only story.  The prodigious Apple IIWebmeister, David Kerwood, has initiated _The Apple II WebRing_, whichyou'll learn more about in this month's _A FUNNY THING HAPPENED_ column.What might be exciting for you is that _The Lamp!_ is now part of thatWebRing.     If you're on another site on the WebRing, it'll likely be easy for youto access back issues of _The Lamp!_  If you prefer to do that the oldfashioned way, remember that our URL is:     http://www.sheppyware.ml.org/~rsuenaga     I am doing what I can to keep this site updated, but remember that itis a lower priority project for me.  Easiest way to access any of theissues of _The Lamp!_ is simply to go to the _IIScribe_ Forum on Delphi (GOCUS 11) and download issues from the Database there.                                [*] [*] [*]     This month, I'll close with my usual Blatant Plug:     KansasFest 1998 registration is going on as I write this.

I need to use the World Wide Web tofind myself a plane ticket to Kansas City in July.     Who said there's no Apple II Life on the 'Net?Ryanthelamp@delphi.comASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][POS]------------------------------                      GOING POSTAL |-----------------------------------Letters To The Editor"""""""""""""""""""""Tonight at 7:19PM, Wednesday the 4th of March 1998, I logged on to Delphiusing PPP (PAP was also negotiated for logon). Today U.S. time it goes intotesting with my beta folks, and should be ready by the end of March.Last week I completely rewrote the not yet tested PPP module which Istarted late last year, as the old implementation wasn't flexible enoughfor added network protocols like PAP and CHAP for example.So, tonight was the first time an Apple IIGS has done PPP without requiringGNO (I believe Derek had PPP working, but I have no proof).Regards, Richardrichard_b@delphi.com          Yowza!--RMS[EOA][OPN]------------------------------     A FUNNY THING HAPPENED. . . . |-----------------------------------Checking out A2 on Delphi"""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

I had no idea howSyndicomm managed to pull that one off, so when I went to KansasFest '97, Ihad one burning question that I was determined to have answered: How?As evidenced by the last two Monday nights, it's obvious that I got theanswer to my question. At 10 PM EST, Apple II users on both Genie andDelphi entered their respective chat rooms, and were able to type to eachother, back and forth, holding aq conversation - in real time - despite thefact that they were logged on to entirely different online networks.My thanks go out to Dave Miller and Tony Diaz for making it possible, andof course to Syndicomm for allowing it to happen.As the official sponsor and host of these dual systems chats, I've reallyenjoyed myself so far. And, just as I imagined, the atmosphere has beenquite freewheeling.Since these chats will be on-going, taking place every Monday night (withvery few exceptions), I was just wanting to toss out for discussion whetherwe should perhaps structure the chats a little.What I'm thinking is that I have a lot of resources and contacts within theApple II world, and I'd like to perhaps use some of those to enhance thechats and to, perhaps, arrange for guests that you usually won't findhanging out in the chat areas.I have nothing definite to suggest at this point, but, maybe you do.Is there anything in particular folks would like to see happen at the SSIIchats, or do you prefer the 'anything goes' atmosphere?Joe Kohn                     (JOE_KOHN, 10179, GO COM A2 FOR)THE MOTHER OF MAC/GS HARDWARE LISTS?

With both of them, the actual speed you seethings happen depends on many factors. If you have hard disk caching activeon your Mac, the second time you run, things will speed up dramatically.As an indication of speed, a shift-boot of GUS takes about three seconds toget to the desktop on my Mac.

Thegrayscale display is actually more readable than the color screens of therest of the 5300 series, primarily because it is a lot brighter than thecolor ones, even the active matrix displays.Another low-end powerbook that could run BTTR would be the 500 series, Ibelieve, and then only if they had the PowerPC upgrade installed.

The Apple II WebRing is now in place, and theRing has been officially recognized by www.webring.org as a legitimate webring!Joining the ring is as easy as filling out a simple form and dropping insome code that I've made available on the WebRing page, at this url:    http://www.syndicomm.com/a2web/a2webring.htmlWhat is a WebRing, you ask? The Apple II WebRing provides a higher level oforganization to the multitude of Apple II sites on the World Wide Web, alevel above what is offered on A2-Web. The Apple II WebRing is a way togroup together these sites with similar content by linking them together ina circle, or ring.How does it work?The idea is that once you are at one site in the Apple II WebRing, you canclick on a "Next" or "Previous" link to go to adjacent sites in the ringand--if you do it long enough--end up where you started. Right now theApple II WebRing is just getting started, so there aren't that many siteson the ring. Yet. That will change as time goes on and the word gets out.If you have a web page that you think belongs in the Apple II WebRing, thenyour task is relatively easy. All you have to do is insert an HTML codesnippet on your page, and fill out a simple form. There is no othermaintenance required on your part. When you join the Apple II WebRing, theHTML code on your homepage never changes. Links point to a special CGIscript at WebRing.org that will send people to the next (or previous) sitein the ring. Because the central ring database is located in one location,sites can be added and removed quickly and easily, and because the WebRingCGI allows you go continue past sites that are unreachable, you will alwaysbe able to continue around the loop.The Apple II WebRing will do quite a few tricks, actually. People cantravel a ring in either direction, either jumping to (or skipping) the nextsite or previous site, list the next five sites in the ring or jump to arandom site in the ring. One of the most powerful capabilities the Apple IIWebRing gives the user is the ability to instantly get a list of all pagesin the loop. In other words, giving the user a one-stop-shop to find everyApple II page that has joined the Apple II WebRing.Welcome to the Ring! {<http://www.syndicomm.com/a2web/> }David K.                     (DKERWOOD, 10264, GO COM A2 FOR)<<<<<   The Mother of All Apple II WebRings now has ten sites in the ring!"""""   Here they are:A2-WebA2-Web is the self-proclaimed Mother of all Apple II web sites, with linksto Apple II support on the web worldwide!Marinetti Home PageTCP/IP for the Apple IIgs.Charles Hartley's Apple II Software Download PageThis site contains downloadable Apple II software and related materials.The AppleWorks GazetteThe AppleWorks Gazette is here to help the promise once made by AppleComputer Corp., but since forgotten by them: Apple ][ forever!The Apple II Programmers Forum on DelphiThe A2 Pro Forum on Delphi is the center of the Apple II ProgrammersUniverse.The Rhode Island Apple Group Home PageThe Rhode Island Apple Group (RIAG) is the Ocean State's premier supportorganization for users of ALL Apple and Apple OS computers.The A2 Forum on DelphiThe A2 Forum on Delphi is the center of the Apple II User Community OnlineUniverse.Trenco Apple II FTP ArchiveThis is an ftp server for Apple II programs, data, and information.The GNO ConsortiumHost site for GNO documentation, the GNO FAQ, and other GNO-relateddocumentation.

After reading thatSteve Cavanaugh planned to produce only two more issues, I got more than alittle depressed and decided to turn my computer off and get some fresh airinstead.Fortunately for me, attending an astronomy lecture given by a NASAscientist always perks me up, so that's what I did instead of printing outthe names of potential winners.That said...I just explained to Shiva that the entire Apple II world waswaiting for the results of the random drawing, and she won't let you down.So, I _will_ post the name of the winner on Thursday.As far as TAB, I was caught completely off-guard by the announcement. Itruly believed that the companies still involved with producing Apple IIproducts were, by this point, "in for the long haul."In his announcement, Steve said that the future of HyperQuarterly was notyet decided, but that he would fulfill his obligations to mail out the tworemaining issues of HQ's Volume 1 to all subscribers. So, I'd like to takethis opportunity to encourage all of you with an interest in HyperCard tosubscribe to HQ.If you are hesitant, Steve does have an offer to send you one issue (Idon't remember the price offhand) as a Preview, of sorts. If you like it,then you can get the other issues.I'll be honest with you...I think HyperQuarterly is wonderful, and I'veenjoyed the first two issues and I'd really like to see it published foryears to come. In order for that to happen, it's apparent that Steve needssome encouragement. And, as 'they' say, "money talks."Please think about signing up for HyperQuarterly. If you like HyperCard,you won't be sorry, as HQ is a wonderfully creative publication that'llmake you even happier that you use a IIGS.Support those who support the Apple II. Joe Kohn, Shareware Solutions II http://www.crl.com/~joko[EOA][A2P]------------------------------                   A2_ProDUCTIVITY |-----------------------------------Checking out A2PRO on Delphi""""""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

Or perhaps of more commercial interest, an 8-bit version ofORCA/C to run on 65c02s?  I'm thinking about the embedded systems market.Devin                    (GLYNREADE, 1384, GO COM A2PRO FOR)>>>>>   If you mean cross compilers, I've already done one.

It could be done under contract for less,but who has that kind of money and needs this kind of product?)As far as a 65c02 version, it's not likely. Creating compiled code for thec02 is just a nightmare; it doesn't have enough RAM to run the typicalcompiled program. And the cost of development for a decent system would beastronomical compared to the cost of porting ORCA/C to the Windowsplatform, so the expected return would have to be higher, too.Mike Westerfield                    (BYTEWORKS, 1393, GO COM A2PRO FOR)WHAT A2PRO WANTS AT KFEST   Reading and taking notes at a frantic pace!"""""""""""""""""""""""""   However, a little late letting everyone knowI'm taking this all in:(  Somewhere "upstream" - msg 1337 to be specific,I've already nabbed Ewen and designated him as the "First Confirmed [KFest'98] Presenter"!Nathan, Geoff, and Mike are "on the list" and we'll try to work out somefantastic sessions for this year's 'Fest. What would help best iseveryone's input on what they'd really like to see this year. Mike hasalready mentioned a HyperLogo session - if there is enough interest.Tom C. has the right approach! Last year and this year he was the FIRST tomention what he'd like to see. (Thanks Tom - that's the input we want!).While we can't guarantee any specific session right now there are stillmany talented, knowledgeable programmers that can take on any suggestion wecan put forth! At the bare minimum, posting your interests here will helpyou inform the programmers that attend.Although I've probably missed something, there is one more thing for now.This is more of a KFest thing than a BASIC Programming thing. So...shouldn't we move this to the "Programmers' Lounge" under the "KansasFest1997" area (rep 7)?

Put that in conjunction with the significance of the tenthK'Fest, and perhaps we have a trend to 'Get back to Basics'. Punintended...From the very start of Spectrum scripting, we tried to keep in mind thatanyone could write their own scripts. Just as in my early days of using a][, everyone wrote their own Basic programs. There has been a lack ofgeneral involvement in such things in recent years, yet the tools have gotmore powerful.GSBasic will be the ultimate on simple programming of the IIgs, and if wecan get people to do it themselves, we should have a rash of newapplications! In a similar way, we have seen SIS and COG written forSpectrum, but those were done by programmers whose time can also be spentat assemblers. We should see things like this from the fingers of ordinaryusers...So to sum up what I am saying is that I think K'Fest 98 is a chance to getpeople back to doing things for themselves. It may be the only way they cankeep their IIgs and //es working in the new communications age we findourselves! Ewen Wannop - Speccie Message delivered by Crock O' Gold 2.1 and Marinetti TCP/IP! http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                     (EWANNOP, 1387, GO COM A2PRO FOR)>>>>>   Here is my 2 cents on the subject of K Fest 98"""""1.

I suppose you could convert all the images down to what the GScan display, but that brings up point two...If you have ever viewed GIFs on the GS you know how long it takes todisplay them. JPEGs are even worse. Combine this image conversion with theHTML processing and the GS, even accelerated, is simply out of its league.Point one can be solved by using the Second Sight card, but that wouldseverely limit the market and it would still be slow.I would guess that the average web page with limited graphics would take atleast 5 minutes to render on an accelerated GS. Add some bigger pictures,especially JPEGs, and you could go have dinner and see a movie while the GSis chugging away. And those graphic-intensive pages with dozens of largeJPEGs might take overnight. That's simply not acceptable. ----------------------------------------------------- Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager [Delivered with Spectrum 2.1 and Crock O' Gold 2.1b19] -- Old age and treachery will overcome youth and skill.                     (TONYW1, 1400, GO COM A2PRO FOR)>>>>>   I would also add color depth as a stumbling block for displaying"""""   graphics "as it was meant to look" on a stock GS. a 16 color fixed640 mode dithered super-hires graphics just can't produce graphics exactlyas what the original look like. Take a look at Super Convert 4.0 and ittakes forever for the graphic conversion to take place.As Tony mentioned, the second sight video card will be the only option toprovide the fastest possible decompression of images with the best possibledisplay. If I recall correctly, a 640x400 JPEG can be uncompressed asquickly as 40 seconds on an accelerated GS as viewed on a Second Sight card(with highly optimized decompression routines). This doesn't consider thepage layout work needed to put the graphics in the appropriate location forthe web page. Also, considering there are no X or Quickdraw tools for theSecond Sight, you will have to write your own font, window, cursor,drawing, etc. routines.IMO, since SIS is available, it is not worth reinventing the wheel forfeatures which would take several years to implement. If you are reallyinterested in writing a graphics Browser, take a look at the source codefor Mosaic 2.x which is freely available and see what it would take to portto the IIgs. I would also suggest looking at the source for Lynx toimplement features which never made it to Mosaic such as Cookies, extendedNetscape extensions to tags, and HTTP 1.1 compliancies.Geoff                    (SISGEOFF, 1401, GO COM A2PRO FOR)>>>>>   I admit that I've never written the code to convert GIF or JPEG"""""   images on the GS, but I have written a fair amount ofcode--including code to convert TIFF on the GS. I tend to bite (byte?) offmore than I should at times, too, but I personally think it is realistic todownload and display _reasonable_ resolution on the Apple IIGS in realtime.Let me define reasonable.I don't mean downloading huge, beautiful 24 bit images, converting them todithered 256 (or even 16) color images, and displaying the full-sizeresult. What would seem reasonable to me is downloading the originalimages, scaling them quickly to something that would fit on an Apple IIGSscreen, and displaying them in grayscale. The actual full-resolution imagescould be saved to disk for later processing.Yes, it's limited. Yes, it would be slow for some sites--but so is my200MHz 604e.As for background processing, I have to disagree flatly with a couple ofcomments I've seen here. I don't claim it's easy, nor always useful, but itcould be useful in a significant number of cases.First, while any GS browser will spend tons more time processinginformation for display compared to download time than a fast Mac, with myISP, I can promise it will have dead time. Maybe that isn't true in yourarea, but it sure is here. That dead time can be used to process displayimages. Should it be? That's a design decision for the person doing theprogramming.Second, I contribute a lot of dead time, too. When I'm flipping from pageto page, no browser keeps up with me. But right at this moment almost anybrowser could keep up. Computers still process information faster than Itype (or read). :)Like most of you, I know it's flat out impossible to display the typicalwide, colorful, graphical web page on a stock Apple IIGS. It's unreasonableto display color at all, and the color wouldn't look good anyway. But Ireally don't see why a grayscale browser with scaled pictures isn'tpossible.Whether that would be a significant enough improvement compared to the workinvolved is, of course, another issue.Mike Westerfield                    (BYTEWORKS, 1416, GO COM A2PRO FOR)>>>>>   There are plenty of things that can be done on the GS *other* than"""""   cloning the latest hot program for other platform XYZ. [There's alot of games 5-10 years old that are perfectly doable] While it'soccasionally good to go attempt something that's never been done before,it's also much better to have a clue and a plan. And when the "plan"includes a fair amount of buzzwords and not enough facts, then you get realsuspicious.   It'd be much better for everyone if *specific* questions were asked(such as "how do I handle extended keyboard "How does the bank 01 screenwork, and why bother?" "What's a handle and a refnum?"). Those can beanswered with specific, concrete answers, and show that the person askingis actually implementing things, rather than just randomly daydreaming.   Daydreams are nice, but you gotta turn those into code eventually ifyou're going to do more than produce vaporware. So daydream, but then turnit into real code (and questions) before saying what's doable.Nathan Mates                     (NMATES, 1421, GO COM A2PRO FOR)>>>>>   Nathan says it all."""""In my opinion, there are only three people on the IIGS who were able tomake a browser that handles GIF pictures.Maybe I am wrong, but it seems to me that now we have TCP/IP but noprograms using it.

First off, it's primarily in bankE1 (more on that later), starting at $2000. You have 200 rows at 160 bytesper row, filling memory until $9D00. [Rows are in linear order, unlike theHires screen] $9D00-$9DC8 are the 'SCBs', scanline control bytes. Thosecontrol what mode each line is in. Bit 7 ($80) controls mode: 1 is 640mode, 0 320 mode. Bit 6 is interrupts (1=on), 5 is fillmode (1=on),4=reserved (off), and 0-3 are the palette #.   From $9E00 to $9FFF are 16 palettes of 16 words each. Palette 0 is at$9E00, palette 1 is at $9E20, etc. Offset +0 in the palette is color 0 forthat, in $0rgb format. [65816 byte order will flip bits around in memory soit'll look backwards-- 9E00: 48 0E is red=14, g=4, b=8. However, if usingwords in assembler or C, go with the $0rgb format]   I've got the above in slightly more detail athttp://www.visi.com/~nathan/a2/gff/shires.txt if you want to print it out.   Once you've got an idea of how things act, you need to program things toact that way. First, unless you're doing some kind of a NDA or purely in awindow code (can be a lotta headaches, and kinda not recommended foranything wanting fast action), your graphics code should probably be purelyin assembly. Sorry, but C is just too slow for most of this kind of things.On the other hand, you can use C (or Pascal, I guess) to tweak youralgorithm,  and recode to asm once you're sure that you're going to usethat. [Being bullheaded and/or damn sure of myself, I always start in asm:]   One of the first things I'd recommend doing in any language is togenerate a lookup table of where each row starts on screen. [Multiplyingrow # *160 is going to be too slow. Generate an array of word offsets inyour code (such as $2000, $20A0, ...), probably during the startup code.]Use that table to get the starting location of a shape on screen, and whengoing up or down 1 row, add 160 ($A0) to the base location.   Next, be prepared for a lot of headaches figuring out where everythingis onscreen. Because the GS is 4 bits (1 nibble) per pixel, there's a 2:1relationship between pixels and bytes. (And 4:1 on pixels:words). Unlessyou want to do a lot of slow shifting or doubled data, you're going to wantto do all drawing at the byte level. If that's done, keep everything inbyte offsets internally, or you'll run into a LOT of oddball bugs. [Beenthere, done that, pulled the hair out over]   And after at least 40 lines of introductory stuff, how to actually drawstuff against backgrounds. There are 2 main approaches on this-- first isto have your draw code save off the background, and restore it on erasing,and the other is to have the background redrawable in sections to forciblyerase the shapes off. Both have some merits, and I'm going to leave it upto you which to do.   If the shape is rectangular and opaque agains the background, a straightcopycan be quickly coded. Here's a quick example (not the most efficient,but fairly straightforward) of a blitter in orca/m syntax:Blitter start* On entry, Y=address of shape in current bank, X=# bytes per row to copy* A=# rows high to copy, and 1,s is screen address to copy to. Stack* cleaned up before exit. sta OnRow stx NumBytes txa  ;calculate offset from end of shape to start of next on screen eor #-1 inc a clc adc #160 ;We just calculated 160-A without having to use any temp varbs sta RowDelta+1 lda 1,s ; address on screen taxDrawRow anop lda NumBytes sta CurBytes shortmCopyIt lda |0,y ;get byte from shape sta >$e10000,x iny inx dec CurBytes bpl CopyIt longm txa ;Adjust screen location to be one row down from start clcRowDelta adc #0  ;selfmodded from amove tax dec OnRow bpl DrawRow pla ;clean up stack before exiting plx pha rtsCurBytes ds 2NumBytes ds 2OnRow ds 2 end   Although the above code should work (coded off the top of my head, GSnot handy to check), it's not the most efficient. Copying words at a timewould be more efficient, as well as partially unrolling the loop if theshape width is fixed in advance. Further, this code assumes the shapedefinition in memory is pointed to by the Y-reg and in the current bank(B-reg tricks would break the local varbs), and the shape def does notcross banks. If you've got a relatively small number of shapes, thoselimitations may be fine for you.   The more serious limitations of the above code are (1) that it doesn'tallow unerasing things (you could modify it to copy memory off to a backupof the screen first, then a restore function to copy back), and (2) itdoesn't allow any 'transparent' areas of the shape. If your background wasa solid color, that'd be easy to account for, but that's not what you stateabove.   Transparency is handled fairly easily with the concept of a 'mask', orwhich bits are on. Say for example you want the screen word to end up like'x67x' where x is the original nibbles (pixels). What you need to do isread the screen word, AND it with $F00F, and then OR it with $0670 beforewriting it to screen memory. That'll preserve the end nibbles, but stuffnew values into the middle two. That doubles the amount of memory eachshape takes up, but it'll work fine. [Tip: if you store the mask rightafter the shape and pass in the byte size of the shape, you could modifythe CopyIt loop above to look something like this:CopyIt lda >$e10000,x and |$80,y ; self-modded in to be the constant offset to mask from shape ora |$00,y sta >$e10000  [Where the above example shows the shape definition of 128 bytes long]   The above examples assume the SHR screen in bank E1. You're supposed touse a few Apple calls to figure out where the screen is, but that's prettydarn unlikely to change anytime soon. For slightly faster animation withless flicker, there's the concept of the SHR 'shadow' screen for fun stuff,but that's for another a2p posting. [Bad storm of packet lossage and don'twanna lose this post]   This'll eventually go up on my web site, and might be the basis of akfest talk if demanded.

First, some more animation theory/ tips:(1) The way to get speed is to draw as little as possible. No matter whatother optimizations you make to the code, that's probably the hands downbest method. Basically, if it didn't move, don't touch it onscreen.(2) For whatever you do draw (whole screen, 16x16 chunks, etc), it can bemuch faster to handle redraws by redrawing everything from the backgroundup than having your shape code first back up the background and redraw itlater. (That's 1 write vs 2). Of course, that should be combined with #1 toredraw as little as possible most of the time. [Don't redraw the whole 32Kbackground if you've got a simple 8x8 sprite in the middle animated :]   And finally, for the advanced animation theory, look into compiledsprites. For the penalty of taking up a lot more ram and disk space, theycan be faster. A program like Mr.Sprite can automate the compilation, oryou write your own tools to turn pictures into code. [Turkeyshoot used17-color (one for transparent) .BMPs saved from Photoshop on my pentium athome, and a program I wrote in C to convert those pictures into code] Moveasm src to GS, compile and link.   The best way to get animation and graphics sped up is to use the 01'shadow' screen. First, a bit of theory as to why it's useful: The E1 bankof memory is *slow*. All accesses to it go at 1Mhz, vs the 2.5Mhz you canget to regular RAM. In the same memory region ($2000.A000), the GS can'shadow' writes made to bank 01 to the same location in E1. That's at 1Mhz.But, if you read from bank 01, you get the 2.5Mhz speed.   The 01 screen can also be used as a buffer to build up a frame (to avoidflickering/problems if multiple layers of sprites are being drawn), andthen pushed to the E1 displayed screen. This is done by turning theshadowing off (read $00c035, or it with $30, write to 00c035), and thenaccessing the 01 screen. [Make sure that memory block is allocated and thesystem is set to use it in the first place--look in Toolbox Ref #3,Quickdraw chapter for one set of flags to use to do it correctly]   When your frame has been built in the 01 buffer, turn shadowing back on(00c035 and with $E7, write back to c035), and then simply read and writeeach byte in the 01 screen to itself. MVN works ok for this kind of trick,but can definitely be improved on, with the most esoteric of animationtricks. [You certainly DON'T have to do these things unless you really aregoing for maximal performance. If you code your things right, you canupgrade certain parts of the graphics engine one part at a time nicely, andnot break too much]   For this final bit of graphics-type code, you have to do the previousstuff, *plus* note that thanks to a holdover from the //e, the stack anddirect page in asm (ONLY asm works here. Don't even think of doing thiswith C) can be moved to bank 01. And that's where you get to do all yourgraphics drawing and pushing to bank E1. But, first, a small reminder thatmany forget:   TURN OFF INTERRUPTS BEFORE MOVING THE STACK TO BANK 01!   All interrupt code assumes that the stack/dp are in bank 00, andinterrupts push lotsa stuff on the stack-- you don't want that on yourscreen displays. A simple 'php/sei' before such code, and a 'plp'afterwards. Background music players, etc do NOT like having interrupts offfor too long, so you'll either want to do smaller operations withinterrupts off (push no more than about 8 pages at a time), or reenableinterrupts occasionally.   You should be able to figure out how dp/stack can be used to draw items,but 'pei slamming' is the most effective use of it no matter what thedrawing method is. [I use this method in my Toast Twilight II module,Turkeyshoot, and Sheppy incorporated some of the theory of this intoWolfGS's screen updates] PEI is used to push a value off the direct pageonto the stack-- and if you set things up right, you're pushing the valuesinto the right place. An outline of it follows:PeiThru32K start* This pushes thru the whole (32K) screen from bank 01 to E1.* Make sure shadowing is on when this is called! tsc sta EntryStack tdc sta EntryDP ;these'll get munged, gotta store them safely sei  ;shoulda used php/sei above the entrystack, oops shortm sta >$00c005 ; bank 01 stack & dp write sta >$00c003 ; bank 01 stack & dp read longm ldy #$2000 ;start on this pageDoAPage tya tcd ;DP is here clc adc #$FF ;put stack to top of page, as it works from top to bottom tcs inc a tay ; save adding $100 later pei $FE ;push DP:FE, FF pei $FC pei $FA* You get the picture, I'm not typing in too much here. pei $06 pei $04 pei $02 pei $00 cpy #$A000 ;off bottom of screen? bge AllDone brl DoAPageAllDone shortm sta >$00c004 sta >$00c002 ;bank 00 DP & stack read & write longm lda EntryStack tcs lda EntryDP tcd cli ; Or plp if done right as above rtsEntryStack ds 2EntryDP ds 2 end   According to the guys with bus analyzers at Apple, inserting a NOP afterevery 13th PEI speeds up things by allowing the 1Mhz and 2.5Mhz busses alittle bit to get back into sync or somesuch. [Doing that and extending thepei's above is left as an exercise for the reader]   Thus concludes today's lesson. The floor is now open to questions...   [And all of the above is pretty much off the top of my head without aneditor to go back and fix things, so hopefully I haven't made too manymessups]Nathan                     (NMATES, 1446, GO COM A2PRO FOR)NEWLY DISCOVERED GS/OS BUG HITS WOLF. . .

[I break *everything*... both a curse and a blessing]   First, a bit of background on this bug-- sheppy decided to patch out_Refreshdesktop (part of windowmgr) for wolfy, and did so with the form ings technote #101 (http://www.visi.com/~nathan/a2/tn/  if interested) a_SetTSPtr with a properly generated table. But, with the _Shutdowntoolscall later, the tool loader sees a new TSPtr from the 'default' and decidesto dump the toolset from memory. Given that the default is now pointing atunallocated memory, you can see why crashes can quickly follow.   Although technote #101 does not say anything about what apps should dobefore exiting, because the tool locator only dumps things if the currentTSPtr is not the default, I made up a GUPP beta which patches wolfy 1.0 tograb the WindowMgr's tsptr before it was patched, and then restore it justbefore the ShutDownTools. Result: everything works.   I don't like the tool locator blindly shutting down stuff in memory (andmay patch that to be more sane soon), but this can be fixed easily at theapp level by that same procedure I listed above. [GUPP can be shift-bootedout, but app-level fixes can't]   So, is there anyone else doing such a _SetTSPtr anywhere in their app'scode (inits going thru SetDefaultTSPtr are immune), and seeing similarproblems?

Once active, _Hermes_ acts just likeany other graphically based text editor--you can resize the window or moveit on your screen; highlight text to add or remove styles; show or hide the"ruler" which shows you tabs, margins, text justification, and gives youshortcuts to set fonts, styles, sizes, and colors of text; find andreplace; or just type away.     _Hermes_ sets itself apart from other text editors with its powerfulfile handling features.  For instance, not only can you open text, Teach,source, and Appleworks Word Processor files, you can set _Hermes_ to savefiles as text, Teach, or source, and even set _Hermes_ up so that it willautomatically open these files when they are double clicked in the Finder._Hermes_ can also be set to show you "invisible" files when you're lookingthrough a hard drive directory, and not only open any file as text(invaluable when you're looking at the inside of a data file for certainkey information--often referred to as "snooping"), but give you a choice ofopening a forked file's resource or data fork.  _Hermes_ can have eightseparate documents open at one time (provided you have enough memory to doso) and cut and paste using the standard Apple IIgs system clipboard, soyou can cut and paste between documents.  In addition, it has two featuresthat I wish were standard in _Appleworks_--the ability to append a newlyopened file to a currently opened one is one.  The other is the ability tohandle word processing documents with an unlimited number of lines up tothe limits of memory (Even on an 8 megabyte Apple IIgs, text files withmany lines--defined as many carriage returns--often cannot be opened inAppleworks 5.1).  This may not be an issue for many users, but it is forme--particularly when editing the large text file of Delphi A2 Forummessages I collect at the end of each month for use in _The Lamp!_.     Of course, _Hermes_ is fast in terms of scrolling speed (and, you canset a preference in _Hermes_ to let it know just how fast you want it toscroll) and has excellent find/replace features.  In fact, its find/replacewindow lets you replace all instances of a text string and copy from thesystem clipboard into the "Search for" and "Replace with" windows--perfectfor getting rid of all of those linefeed characters in an MSDOS text file.     If _Hermes_ has a shortcoming, it's that it spoils you--you begin toexpect too much from it.  Because it is based on the standard IIgs TextEdittool, it is prey to the shortcomings of that tool, including its known (andunknown) bugs as well as its single set of margins and justification perdocument.  However, you can, of course, easily save your text into a textor Teach file and import it into a word processing or page layout programand add your fancy formatting there.     I've always believed that the most perfect tools for writing are theones that get in your way the least, and _Hermes_ is one of those tools.Simple yet powerful, elegant yet distinguished, _Hermes_ can be the AppleIIgs writer's best friend.[EOA][WEB]------------------------------                  WEB SLINGING 101 |-----------------------------------Apple II Web Sites~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~by Ryan M. Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                         WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     If you've successfully started cruising the Internet with a World WideWeb broswer, from the unassuming _Lynx_ or the _Spectrum Internet Suite_(SIS) to the sophisticated _Netscape Communicator_ or _Microsoft InternetExplorer_, or any in between, you may be wondering where the hot spots arefor the Apple II family computers.  We're here to tell you just where tofind them.     First, a caveat: the Web is in a constant state of flux, and addressescan change from day to day.  An address you see here (remember the term"URL" from Volume 1, Issue 1 of _The Lamp!_) that's valid today may not bevalid tomorrow.  Web Page maintainers may move not just from InternetService Provider to Internet Service provider, but also from state to stateor country to country, and many ISP's are only available in certain areas.Still, we'll try to give you a start on some of the most fascinating sitesaccessible to the Apple II user.     Some all purpose sites:     http://www.apple.com     Apple Computer, Inc., the parent of the Apple II family of computers,has long operated its own Web site.  Of course, the vast majority of thecontent there is focussed on its other computers, but it still has valuableinformation and software for the Apple II enthusiast, including all of themost recent versions of the Apple II System Software, including Apple IIgsSystem Software 6.0.1 and HyperCard GS 1.1.  Sadly, its Web site could bebetter set up for those of us using the Web browsers available on the AppleII.     http://www.apple2.org     Operated by Tony Diaz of Alltech Electronics, one of the Apple II'schief hardware honchos, apple2.org is a relatively new site that featuresinformation and pictures that cannot be found elsewhere.  Tony's slant onsuch things as the never-released Apple II Ethernet Card, complete withdiagrams, is here, as well as pictures (many in .JPG format, whichunfortunately is not particularly Apple II friendly) of rare pieces ofhardware.  If you want to learn what it takes to rebuild your Apple II inan alternative case such as a tower or an old portable, this is the sitefor you.     http://www.syndicomm.com/a2web     The Mother Of All Apple II Web Sites, A2-Web is maintained by theDivemaster, David Kerwood, who has assembled a plethora of Apple IIoriented Web sites.  A2-Web maintains one of the most extensive collectionsof links in the world, including links to Apple II newsletter publishers,user home pages, software repositories, online services, software houses. .. you name it, A2-Web has it.  Moreover, David has made extensive effortsto assure that A2-Web is compatible with any and all World Wide Webbrowsers, including and especially Lynx and SIS.  A2-Web is hosted on theSyndicomm server, which is the base of World Wide Web operations for thecompany that operates the A2 areas on Delphi and Genie.     http://www.visi.com/~nathan/a2     This site is maintained by Delphi regular Nathan Mates, and hislisting of Apple II resources is one of the most complete in the Apple IIworld.  You can also find the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for theUsenet newsgroup known as comp.sys.apple2 here.  There is an immense amountof information located there, including answers to some of the most basicquestions the new or inexperienced Apple II user will have.  From thehistory of the Apple II to general information about what an Apple II cando to where to find Apple II software and pinouts of various Apple IIhardware connectors, everything is here.  Also on this site is recent AppleII news and more links to other Apple II sites.     Some Apple II newsletter publishers:     http://www.crl.com/~joko     _Shareware Solutions II_ is the dean of Apple II newsletters, anabsolute "Must-Have" item for the serious Apple II user.  Joe Kohn hoststhis page which contains a SSII mini-index and the closest thing to acomplete catalog that the SSII product line has.  This is a 100% Lynxfriendly web site that must be checked out by anyone serious about theirApple II.     http://users.ids.net/~kerwood/juiced.gs/home.html     Here we find the World Wide Web page for the exciting Apple IIgsspecific newsletter, _Juiced.GS_.  Published by Max Jones with the websitehosted by the prolific David Kerwood, this quarterly publication is knownfor its beautiful layout and high quality journalism.     http://people.delphi.com/appleblossom     This is the new location of Apple Blossom Publishing's web page.Formerly on aol.com, Steve Cavanaugh has moved the pages to Delphi.  Eventhough Steve's decided to end the run of _The Apple Blossom_,_HyperQuarterly_ could go on for some time, and you'll be able to find someback issues of _TAB_ here, as well as some sample articles and a realbonus: a listing of Apple II vendors.     http://people.delphi.com/rsuenaga     -and-     http://www.sheppyware.ml.org/~rsuenaga     are the homepages for _GenieLamp A2_ and _The Lamp!_ respectively. Youwill find as complete an archive of both publications as possible here. Ihost these sites, so I don't think I can be very objective in their review.I'd just suggest checking them out.     In our next installment, we'll keep looking for new places to check onthe World Wide Web for signs of Apple II life.  See you next month.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :     Succumb to natural tendencies.
