Called The Grove, these trees and shrubs brokethe prevailing Northwest wind... making it easier to heat the house.     The house was heated with a pot bellied stove using wood from thegrove as fuel... a truly sustainable fuel source some sixty years ago.  (Itis said that wood is the fuel that warms you twice... once when youcut/split it and again when you burn it.)     The grove also provided a place for the children to play... and plentyof squirrels and rabbits for the dog to chase.                           Computers and Energy                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Certainly the thousands of computers as a total consume greatquantities of energy.

Here is a copy of the message posted tothe newsgroup.I'm pleased to announce that after 8 years of on-again, off-again effort,v1.0 alpha of the Generic Tile Engine (GTE) library has been released.  Itis currently available in source code form at   http://iigs.dreamhost.com/gte/gte.htmlI plan to provide emulator-friendly downloads with the beta release.Currently the documentation is incomplete and I would like to write anin-depth tutorial as well. If anyone has an interest in creating atile-based GS-only game, I invite you to give this library a try.Also, I welcome feedback on the documentation as well as the code asprovided.  This is an alpha release, which means I consider itfeature-complete, but there are undoubtedly many bugs remaining. I willexpand the online documentation as time permits and questions are raised.Hopefully, by releasing things in an unfinished state, this will pressureme into continuing to support this project. :)Here is a partial list of the features supported by GTE in its currentstate:  * Tiles of size 4x4, 8x8, or 16x16  * Up to full-screen (320x200) playing fields  * 8-way scrolling  * Independent Foreground and Background tile layers (for parallax    effects)  * Fringe tile layer  * Mask tile layer for per-pixel masking of sprites, e.g. put sprites    behind fences  * Up to 32 dynamic tiles on screen  * Up to 32 sprites on-screen  * Up to 256 tiles on-screen per layer  * Support for Windows BMP files  * Compiled sprites with support for horizontal and vertical mirroring  * Use of Object Attribute Memory (similar to the NES) for controlling    sprites  * Logical palette binding  * Interrupt-friendly.  Interrupts are never disabled for more than a few    hundred microseconds.I am especially interested in hearing about any additional features peoplewould like. I plan to add a high-level sprite and animation manager to theengine, but I'm sure there are other obvious items to add.I look forward to everyone's feedback.-Lucas(LSCHAREN, Cat 14, Top 2, Msg 88)[EOA][DMR]DiskMaker 8 Version 1.1 Released""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I have updated DiskMaker 8 disk image utility, which now offers faster5.25" disk formatting, the ability to boot from your newly-created diskwhen it's finished writing, and support for DOS 3.3 volume numbers.

Someone quipped one day that I didn'thave enough familiarity with Spectrum to actually do that. So...........(I always did love a challenge)In actuality, the newer version was a team effort. Gary, Paul Pirosko and Ideveloped the "Delphi Messenger" to read, and write.  Gary wrote the buttonscripts, writing scripts and graphic overlays, while I made them compatibleto Delphi and my own program, fine-tuning them with my original scripts.Paul Pirosko proofread the scripts, and shortened some of them to keep theprogram simple. Ewen gave me a few scripts that helped shortened theprocess, but at the time was doing another project so Paul, Gary and Istuck with it.After the program was up and working (it did everything and did it right)Ewan asked me to send him the scripts, as he was at that time finished withhis other work, and he'd see about incorporating newer scripts into it.When the original COG came out, we tore it apart to discover that over 80%of the scripts were ours (Paul {who said 90%+}, Gary's and my own) and Ewanhad added a picture in the front and renamed our program (COG), giving usvery little credit.  As a matter of fact, I used our original scripts to dothe same thing for Compuserve until they too stopped supporting the ApPLEII's and Amigas.  I still have my APPLE IIGS's but have moved into otherfields. Paul has a web-designing business and I helped for a time, learningCold Fusion and Microsoft FrontPage.  Now, I build computers... both mykids are grown and the few times I did come back to the Apple II areas, Ifelt the reception was a bit cool....... so I moved on.  I am not angryabout COG, as I do recognize Ewan as a superior Speccie writer, however theReader/Writer for Delphi was my idea, and on my Apple II's I still usedDelphi Messenger (as did Paul) until we packed them up and put them instorage.Good Luck to all........REF - FROM THE NOVEMBER 2003 ISSUE OF _The Lamp!_ .......~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[KGS]KIT GRAHAM AND SPECTRUM SCRIPTS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Wasn't there a Kit Graham who wrote scripts to make CoPilot work onCompuServe using Spectrum 2.0?(KGAGNE, Cat 2, Top 31, Msg 42)>>>>>"""""Yes indeed. Kermit Graham did work on those scripts, and I remember at thetime helping him with the scripts. If I remember correctly, I eventuallyevolved the scripts into COG for Delphi, which then evolved into SOAR forSyndicomm.
