The IIgscan be booted from the Mac hard drive... we will save that for a futureissue, restricting the discussion in this issue to the transfer of files.Why you might want to network these two computers:''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''Networking these two computers allows the transfer of files back and forthbetween the computers.  This can be especially helpful if you have not beenable to locate a SCSI card for your IIgs... your IIgs can access SCSIdevices installed in or attached to your Mac.  (Hard drive, CD-ROM drive,removable media drive, etc).With networking you could:1. Back up your IIgs hard drive to a hard drive on the Mac.2. Store files on the Mac.3. Access Apple II CD-ROMs.4. If you can not locate a shell account or find an ISP that will connect   via Marinetti, you can access the net with the Mac and transfer files to   the GS.What You Will Need''''''''''''''''''1. A IIgs running System 6.01.2. A serial printer cable.3. A Mac running System 7, 8, or 9.  You might be able to use System 10.Note... if you do not own a Mac, an older Mac suitable for this use can beacquired for a very modest investment.Where to Get What You Need''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Thrift stores.2. Garage sales.3. Usenet... comp.sys.apple2.marketplace4. A2 on Syndicomm5. LEM-Swap list <http://lowendmac.com/lists/swap.html>6. Alltech Electronics <http://www.allelec.com/indexa2.html">8. Other World Computer <http://www.macsales.com/">9. Mac-Res-Q <http:/www.macresq.com> or call 1-888-447-3728Getting the IIgs Ready''''''''''''''''''''''1. Using your System 6.01 disks install 'Network:AppleShare'2. Set the slots:     a. ROM 1 - Set slot 7 to AppleTalk and slot 1 or 2 to Your Card     b. ROM 3 - Set slot 1 or 2 to AppleTalkGetting the Mac Ready'''''''''''''''''''''Note... this is based on a LC III running System 7.5.5.1. Under the Users & Groups control panel     a. Set up a user id for yourself2. Under the Sharing Setup control panel     a. Enter Owner Name, password to be used, and Name of Macintosh.     b. Turn on file sharing.     3. Setup which users have access to what.3. Under AppleTalk control panel     a. Indicate Printer Port or Modem Port.     b. Make AppleTalk active.Connect the two Computers'''''''''''''''''''''''''Using a serial printer cable, connect the printer port or modem port of theIIgs with the printer or modem port of the Mac.  (Using the ports selectedwhen setting up your IIgs and Mac.)Using AppleTalk'''''''''''''''1. Boot both the IIgs and the Mac.2. Open the AppleTalk control panel on the IIgs.3. Select a listed file server and click OK.4. Enter name and password, then click OK.5. Select the Mac volumes you want to use and click OK.6. Close the AppleShare control panel.There on the IIgs desktop is an icon for each Mac volume you selected.  Youcan now copy files to/from the Mac, load files from the Mac into IIgsapplications, save files from IIgs applications to the Mac, delete files onthe Mac from the IIgs, etc.[EOA]------------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------[NLE]NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA][LTE]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]------------------------------                       KFest 2003 |-----------------------------------[PBT]KFest 2003 - PLAN TO BE THERE!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KansasFest 2003 is planned for July 22-27, 2003 at Avila University inKansas City, Missouri.(Entrance banner, Cat 5, Top 5)[EOA][VKF]FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THE KFest HOME PAGE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KFest Home Pagehttp://www.kfest.org/[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
