Andthe Apple II faithful couldn't be happier.     For the eleventh straight year, the steadfast supporters of thecomputer that started it all gathered to celebrate at Avila College in theheat of the Kansas City summer.  KansasFest 1999 is over and I'm as tiredas I've been since, well, KansasFest 1998.  At the same time, I'mrefreshed, excited, and ecstatic.     KansasFest 1997 was revolutionary, with the introduction of_Marinetti_ taking the Apple II places it had never been before; KansasFest1998 was evolutionary, with more new and updated products than you couldshake a stick at.  KansasFest 1999, on the other hand, could best bedescribed as contemplative.  Yes, there were new products announced, butnot like the blockbuster year of 1998.  Yes, there were new discoveries,but not like the phenomenon that is known as _Marinetti_.     KansasFest 1999 was a place to make new friendships and renew oldones; a time to celebrate and meditate.  Another chance to stay up allnight and recharge for another year.     And a chance to go back to a time when everything was new.                                [*] [*] [*]     We'll Never Have To Say Goodbye Again Department: Last month we sawthe final pre-KFest '99 Blatant Plug.

When I conducted my research on""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   the Apollo printer, it reallystruck me that something was odd. Not with the printer, but with thecompanies involved.It just didn't make any sense to me why Hewlett-Packard was going so out ofits way to distance itself from one of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Or,why it was so hard to pry, from an Apollo rep, the connection betweenApollo and HP.But, thanks to Lyle Syverson's eagle eye, it now all makes perfect sense.Well, sort of. In a very strange and bizarre sort of way ;-)Lyle sent me two newspaper clipping. One was a news item:Color Printer Joins Barbie Line"Mattel and Apollo are targeting young girls with a Barbie ink jet printer. The printer, which has glitter-pink accents and can be decorated with decals, uses Hewlett-Packard inkjet cartridges and includes the Barbie Magic Hair Styler CD-ROM. Expected to sell for $79, the printer initially will be sold at Best Buy."The second clipping was a color ad from Best Buy.After a rebate, the DeskJet 420c, whoops, I mean the Apollo 1200, whoops, Imean the shocking-pink Barbie Doll printer costs $59.Without a doubt, it's the ugliest looking printer I've ever seen. It'spink, and it has decals of a Barbie Doll all over it. It's so hideouslyugly that the tears of laughter were rolling down my face just by lookingat the ad.It's so absurd, I think I want to purchase one to use on my IIGS ;-)That said, I just don't think I can bring myself to add the Barbie printerto the list of printers supported by Harmonie.

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.  --  rsuenaga@apple2.org Editor and Publisher, _The Lamp!_, published monthly on Delphi Posted by PTMM v2.5 - The integrated information solution                       (RSUENAGA, 24143, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Sorry this took so long. Greg Schaefer has been on a project and"""""   just got to this. I hope it is still of some interest and help.From the diagram, I have a little trouble understanding the connections oncable number 2 (are //gs DTR, DSR and linux DCD, DSR, DTR all tiedtogether?). In any case, though the poster categorizes number 1 as simpler,it is indeed the correct one. With respect to high speed communications,the issue is the /gs DTR/CTS pin. The //gs provides only a single non-dataoutput pin. It can be used either as CTS or as DTR, but not as both. Inhigh-speed communications, CTS is a much more important function than DTR.It allows the software to temporarily stop the flow of incoming data fromthe external device. DTR on the other hand is just used to terminateconnections.In the first cable, //gs DTR/CTS is connected to the CTS pin on the linuxbox. This gives ProTERM the ability to temporarily throttle incoming datawhen it needs to. In the second cable, the //gs DTR/CTS is connected to thelinux DTR pin and ProTERM has no ability to slow down the linux box when itsends data too quickly. That is why there is more data loss with the secondcable than the first. If you use the first cable as a reasonable bps rate(19200-38400) you should encounter little if any data loss. At 57600, thedata comes in so quickly, ProTERM is sometimes unable to change CTS fastenough to ovoid overflow.Greg Schaefer @ InTrec Software, Inc. [Delivered by ProTERM Mac Messenger]via Jerry Cline                        (INTREC, 24330, GO COM A2)>>>>>   This may be splitting hairs, but in my understanding, ANSITerm was"""""   designed to emulate a PC/ANSI telecom program. It is thereforelogical to me that ANSITerm uses settings that are more PC standard thanMac standard. In other words - If your modem has stored settings for PC andfor Mac, the PC settings are more likely to match ANSITerm's needs.FWIW - the major difference between the settings required by ANSITerm andthose required by Spectrum and some other programs is that ANSITerm issuesits hangup command by dropping DTR, whereas Spectrum forces the modem incommand mode, and hangs up via the 'ATH' command. Both are standard, andboth are correct - but they require different settings for how DTR ishandled. "But, there are two different ways to wire a hardware handshaking cable  for the IIgs and Mac."Well, more than two - The typical hardware handshake cable works throughthe DSR line on the GS Port, and will either have the carrier detect linefrom the modem connected to the GPI/DCD pin on the GS modem port, or not.Lady Technophobe's GS is currently using a cable that handshakes throughthe GPI/DCD pin and uses the DSR pin for carrier detect. The nice thingabout this cable is that it works not only with the ANSITerm driverprovided for it, but it also works quite nicely with programs that use themodem port firmware - e.g. Snowterm. It also works quite nicely withMarinetti.I'm still trying to figure out the best compromise for running Bernie viathe PC Card modem in my PowerBook. It doesn't appear to support CarrierDetect at all - not even in the couple of Mac programs that I have triedthat support CD...Don V.

There are one or two known problems that I'mactively engaged in tracking down and hope to have fixed this week.It's true that the Intel version of Sweet16 is comparatively slow. MyPentium II 333 MHz system emulates about a 6.5 MHz IIgs, which isn't awfulbut is nothing like the 50 or 60 MHz you'd get on a comparable-speedMacintosh running the PPC version of Sweet16.I'm actively looking for a good Intel assembly language programmer to writethe x86 assembly core for Sweet16. If you know someone who might be able todo this, please let me know!---Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                        (SHEPPY, 24248, GO COM A2)<<<<<   A few things:"""""1. Sweet16 for BeOS Intel will become faster over time. There are   optimizations ongoing, and eventually we will find someone to do the   assembly code for it.2. Sweet16 for BeOS Intel is still much faster than XGS is, by a   substantial factor.3. As for the whole Windows thing -- developing a Windows version wouldn't   be sinful; it's just that BeOS is a better place for emulation. The   PowerPC processor is designed with emulation in mind, which gives it an   inherent advantage -- there will never be an x86 Apple II emulator that   can compete with a comparably well-written emulator on an equivalent   PowerPC chip; the architecture of x86 processors isn't up to the   challenge.The Windows operating system adds another layer of slowness to things; it'snot a well-designed system internally and isn't very efficient. BeOS, onthe other hand, performs quite spectacularly (with very low latencies onaudio and video presentation, a fraction that of either Mac OS or Windows),and is easily and inexpensively scaled onto multiprocessor systems.You can buy a dual-processor Pentium II system for under $2000 andsubstantially improve Sweet16's performance. You can't do that underWindows.The point is that BeOS just makes more sense as an OS for emulation thanWindows does. The goal of Sweet16 is to create emulation that's compatibleand fast, and to do that on Intel processors, in my opinion, Windows isn'ta reasonable way to go. BeOS isn't expensive, it installs easily andcleanly, and can sit next to Windows on the same hard disk.A 200 MHz Pentium II can run Sweet16 at around 3 or 4 MHz, roughly. That'sfaster than the 1.5 to 2 MHz or so I get running XGS on my 200 MHz PentiumII at work.Also note that XGS development has apparently stalled, and hasn't as far asI can tell been updated in over a year. Sweet16 development isaccelerating; my goal is to meet or exceed Bernie's features within a year.Much to Henrik's chagrin. :)---Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                        (SHEPPY, 24267, GO COM A2)<<<<<   By the way, Sweet16 1.0 is now available for download -- you can"""""   read the manual online (and download the PPC and Intel versions) at{<http://www.sheppyware.net/software/sweet16_be/>http://www.sheppyware.net/software/sweet16_be/}Enjoy!Sheppy---Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                        (SHEPPY, 24522, GO COM A2)MY ESOURCE REWARDS TARDINESS   I forgot to mention: Seven Hills is having a""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   sale on IIGS software through the end ofJuly.

I'vebeen playing it a bit and it seems like a great game - definitelycommercial quality (I've paid for games just like it) - and so am startingthis thread. First message here I'd like to post some excerpts from thedocs:-----SILVERN CASTLE: The Lost Crystal OrbProgram Author - Jeff FinkVersion 1.0 - July, 1999Shareware fees: $15Jeff Fink432 Eureka St., Apt. 210Ripon, WI 54971What is it?'''''''''''Silvern Castle is a fantasy role-playing game. You will be able to createup to 20 characters and take 6 of them on an adventure into the unknowndepths of a multi-level 3-D maze. It won't be easy. Traps of all kindsabound, as well as hundreds of monsters. Will you be able to fulfill yourquest and retrieve the lost Crystal Orb from the evil Wizard Drachma?Version 1.0'''''''''''Silvern Castle was developed after the authors of Wizardry bragged that itwas "...a game that simply could not have been written in BASIC."^1 SilvernCastle was purchased by Softdisk in 1988, but was never published. Afterthe demise of Softdisk, I requested and obtained written acknowledgementthat the rights to Silvern Castle shall revert back to me. Although I havegreatly modified and improved upon the original Silvern Castle, it hasuntil now never been seen, hence the version 1 moniker (although since1988, it's probably up to version 20!). So, here for the greater Apple IIcommunity for the very first time is version 1.0 of Silvern Castle, acomplete fantasy role-playing game written in Applesoft BASIC!^1 Wizardry: Proving Grounds Manual, pg 1.Introduction to Silvern Castle''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''Welcome to a new computer role-playing experience.

Demihumans get much higherstats than humans, but require twice the experience to advance each of thefirst four levels. It just gets worse after that. Try a mixed party. I'musing one with a demihuman fighter and mage, and a human fighter, mage,cleric, and thief. Don't take my word for it, though. I've tried humanparties, demihuman parties, and mixed parties, and had them allslaughtered. (if you see priestesses or pixies - RUN! or fall back to yourlast save)- Like I said, this game is tough. :) The only way I can see surviving:cheat. Create five dummy characters (fastest way is human male fighters ofstrength 14; I named them A-E) and create a party of those five and one ofyour real characters. Send the keeper to Quillion's Trading Post to Buy,and Pool your gold. Then delete the five fake characters, and repeat. Aftera few minutes of this, you should have enough gold to outfit all yourcharacters with decent weaponry & armour.- Mages and clerics are useless without spells.

Today, after waiting morethan a year since its announcement, Castlewood Systems tries to one up--orrather, 22 up--the original Zip Drive with its Orb Drive.  There areseveral incarnations of the Orb; the one we're looking at is a $199removable hard drive that attaches to a SCSI chain and provides 2.2_gigabytes_ of very fast, very inexpensive storage with the convenience ofa floppy disk.     The Orb Drive comes with Macintosh software on a CD ROM, an owner'sguide, one 2.2 gig cartridge (cartridges are available for $30 each), apower supply ("wall wart" style), and a DB 25 to HDB 50 SCSI cable.  Thedrive itself is black in color, compact (listed in the specifications asbeing 6.5 x 1.5 x 5.25 inches) and light (1.19 pounds)--it looks like aportable CD player.     The Orb Drive has many features we've come to expect in SCSI removablehard drives.  It has an eject button, two scsi ports, built-in termination,an LED to indicate power and disk activity, and a SCSI ID selection switch.In many ways, it is similar to the Zip Drive, although it improves on it inseveral areas.  Like the Zip Drive, the Orb Drive has an eject button andtwo SCSI ports but does not have an on/off switch.  Unlike the Zip, theSCSI ports are the HDB 50 type, not widely used in the Apple II world.Also, unlike the Zip Drive, there is a disk eject hole through which youcan stick a paper clip in an emergency, and you can choose from more thantwo SCSI IDs (although the IDs are still limited to numbers 0, 4, 5, and6).  Like the Zip, the Orb has built-in termination; unlike the Zip, thetermination is automatic and active, meaning if the drive senses it is thelast thing in the chain, it will turn termination on, and if it senses itis not the last thing in the chain, it will turn termination off.  Also,like the Zip, when you insert a disk cartridge, the disk partitions appearon your desktop within seconds, and when you drag the disk partitions tothe trash under Finder, the cartridge ejects itself from the drive.  Likethe Zip, there is one LED which indicates power and disk activity.  Andalso like the Zip, if the drive is not used for a time, it goes into apower conserving "sleep" mode.     When attached to an Apple Rev. C SCSI Card in a IIgs, the Orb Driveworks like a huge hard drive.  The Orb I have even provides term power tothe SCSI chain.  Using the drive required one condition be met: the drivemust have its power applied and the LED must be a solid green (instead ofthe blinking red) before the power switch on the IIgs is turned on._Chinook SCSI Utilities_ did not recognize the drive, but Apple's _AdvancedDisk Utilities_ did, and partitioned the cartridge readily.  After that,the Orb acted just like, well, a 2.2 gig hard drive.  It's more space thanyou will probably ever need with an Apple II.     Unfortunately, I could not get the RamFAST SCSI Card to recognize theOrb, which is disappointing.  I do not have an Apple High Speed SCSI cardavailable to test the drive with, however, I would guess it would actsimilarly to with the Rev. C SCSI Card, just a bit faster if DMA is on.     I would suspect (but have not experienced yet) that the Orb Drive's"sleep" mode may have similar problems to what Zip Drive owners haveexperienced with the Apple SCSI Cards.  These were addressed by using theTulin SCSI drivers in combination with the Apple SCSI Cards.     If you are an Apple Rev. C SCSI Card user (or an Apple High Speed SCSICard user who likes to experiment), I would highly recommend the Orb Driveif you're in the market for a new hard drive.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                           KFEST XI: THE REUNION                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Once a year, the Apple II faithful return from all corners of theglobe to their Mecca.  A small college in Kansas City, Missouri, less thana mile from the Kansas border.  They return to see old friends and make newones; to honor the past and plan the future; and to stay up all night andhave fun all day.  They came, once again, for KansasFest.     KFest 1999 was like every other KFest, yet unlike every other KFest.Like KFests past, we saw new products and made new discoveries.  UnlikeKFests past, we finally saw the transition of the Apple II--from thevenerable Apple IIgs to the world of emulation.     So for those of you who weren't able to make it in person, here is ourlook at the virtual KFest 1999:DAY -4   Like I did in 1998, I decided to fly into California instead of""""""   straight to Kansas City so I could visit with some friends and getsome shopping done before KFest.  I'd again be staying with the Sheppys,aka Eric and Sarah Shepherd.  I got home, finished packing, and waitedimpatiently for my sister to get home so she could drop me off at theairport.     I travelled a little lighter this year than usual.  For the first timesince my first KFest, no Apple II--at least not a physical one.  My virtualApple II, in the form of the renown emulator _Bernie ][ The Rescue_, waspacked away on my PowerBook.  I checked into the airport with two bags, abackpack, and a small box; all of my Apple II hopes and dreams packed awayin my heart.  I was leaving home, but going home.     Here we come, Avila.DAY -3   I'm not sure when Day -4 ended and Day -3 began, but it was""""""   somewhere over the middle of the Pacific Ocean with a change intime zones on a five and a half hour flight.  I tried to get as much sleepas I could on the plane, knowing that I probably wouldn't get much sleep atthe Sheppys and I'd get almost none at KFest.  When I got off the plane,Sheppy was waiting for me.  It was before 6 a.m.--again.  Somehow, I neverend up at the airport at a reasonable hour in San Francisco.  We talked abit about KFests past and KFest future--there were no blockbusterannouncements coming this year, at least none we knew about.Announcements, yes; blockbusters, no.  Still, we looked forward to seeingold friends and making new ones in the heat of the Kansas City summer.     We stopped for breakfast at an IHOP (International House Of Pancakes,for the uninitiated--although I've never been sure what's so internationalabout pancakes, especially the ones they serve there) on the way to the newHouse Of Sheppy in Tracy, CA.  Eric and Sarah had moved here recently andthe home turned out to be an absolutely lovely place.     I spent a lot of the day trying to relax.  I was exhausted from thetravel and the weeks leading up to it.  Working two jobs and putting out myApple II writing had begun to take a toll--as much as I don't like to admitit, I needed a vacation, badly.  I was only too happy to be away fromresponsibility.     It was also a great day to go to Fry's Electronics.  Fry's is a largeregional electronics shop that has some great prices (and probably just asmany that aren't as great).  I walked around for awhile, picking up a fewcables and odds and ends that I couldn't get nearly as cheaply at home,then stumbled on something I've been looking for for over a year: aCastlewood Systems Orb Drive external SCSI version (see the reviewelsewhere in this issue).  I approached the register where I'd end upspending about $300 and was greeted by the cashier asking,     "Are you Hawaiian?"     Maybe the shorts gave me away.DAY -2:   Day -2 was almost my ideal vacation day.  I did nothing other"""""""   than sleep, fool around online, and burn a few CD ROMs.  Iconsidered doing a little packing (as my stuff was overflowing in theSheppys' guest room) but that seemed too close to work to seriouslyconsider.  Sheppy was busy working on _Sweet16_, the IIgs emulator for the_BeOS_, and showing off the Weird Al Yankovic DVD he had picked up atFry's.  We also considered the post-KFest PizzaFest that the Sheppys werehosting at their house--SheppyFest, where some KFesters and some missingfriends would be hanging out in about a week.  Sent some email to myfriends at work.  "Miss you, wish you were here, glad you are not."  Ha ha.This vacation stuff is great!DAY -1   Day -1 was the real pre-KFest training.  Unlike the Sheppys, I'd""""""   be leaving for KFest to arrive on Day 0.  In fact, I'd be leavingso early that we decided to just stay up all night and drop me off at theairport about 4 am.  Well, I wasn't planning much sleep anyway, right?     No sleep is better when you're KFest bound.DAY 0   It's hard to figure out just when Day 0 began.  If tomorrow doesn't"""""   come until you fall asleep, I guess it came when I was in the planefrom San Francisco to Denver, but before the plane from Denver to K.C.  Iwas tired enough to sleep, although not well, on both flights.     When I got off the plane and into the terminal of MCI, famillar afterfive years, I was fortunate to quickly get my luggage.  I headed for therestroom, and who should appear but my ride to Avila, the KFest TaxiDispatcher, Carl Knoblock.  It was great to see a familiar face.  I washome again.     Carl had his wife's car--his van had picked an unfortunate time tobreak down.  Fortunately, I travelled light, and so did he--instead ofbringing his IIgs, as he had every year in the past, his computingequipment consisted of his new PowerBook G3, in a theme that would repeatitself over and over this KFest.  We had another person to pick up--PatKern, who was flying in this year, instead of coming by land as she had inthe past.  Between Pat, Carl, and I, we ended up having just enough luggageto pack Carl's wife's car, no more, no less.  At least we did once we couldfind his car again.  We ran to Wal-Mart before getting to Avila to pick upa few essentials (including a Diet Coke at McDonald's), and after about anhour of driving, we reached Avila.  Home again.     We checked in and got our keys, committed the numerical code forRidgway access to memory (or something), and started to settle in.  Weweren't the first arrivals--those seemed to be the land travelling trio ofGina Saikin, Dave Miller, and Jeff Blakeney, who showed up at around 6 inthe morning in a van with a sign indicating they were KFest bound in a rearwindow.  Some people just can't wait to get KFesting.     I arrived earlier than my roommate, Kirk Mitchell, a Kansan who had todrive across the state to get to KFest, so I grabbed "the good bed."  Afterfive KFests, I still don't know what "the good bed" means.  I was in themidst of setting up when my roommate showed up.  We spent the dayexchanging insults (my initial opening being, "Do you need help moving yourstuff in?  If you do, you better find someone who cares.") and setting upPower Macs--his beige G3 minitower, and my Duo 2300c.     Friends were already there and arriving by the bucketful--Russ Almanand Mike Wallace of Apple II license plate fame, senior KFester EphraimWall and Joyce Sullivan from Oklahoma, Ray Merlin and Erick Wagner fromTexas, the Binary Bus with Da Bears (Dave and Ahren Ciotti) and HonoraryBear Ewen Wannop, newsletter publishers Max Jones and Joe Kohn, newbiesLuke Weerts and Richard Hansen, and of course, The Big Cheese herself,Cindy Adams.  KFest was happening.  It was like Christmas.     Aside from the usual cruising of the halls to see who was there andmake fun of Max Jones' recycled door sign, the rest of the night was spenthanging out and having dinner over at K.C. Masterpiece restaurant.  Ifnothing else, the food was definitely an upgrade from the Avila cafeteria.DAY 1:   Since this year's KFest had early arrivals on Tuesday, Wednesday""""""   was a less hectic day than in KFests past.  More KFesters arrivedon Wednesday as well, including _Spectrum Internet Suite_ author GeoffWeiss and InTrec Software's Jerry Cline.  It was so much less hectic, infact, I even got up early enough to do a little shopping.  One of the nicethings about KFest is that things are near enough that if you forgetsomething (in our case, a long telephone cord), it's easy enough to run outand get.  There's Radio Shack, Wal-Mart, CompUSA, and Best Buy all closeenough to get stuff, and if you're not into Avila cuisine, there'srestaurants close enough to get prepared food as well.  I usually just gofor a few boxes of cookies and a few 12 packs of soda.     The first official KFest event was dinner, which was predictablyAvila-like.  Following that we were addressed by KFest organizer CindyAdams, aka The Big Cheese, then we were onto the big show, the keynoteaddress given by my Friend For Life Max Jones, publisher of _Juiced.GS_.Max honored several KFest attendees who came from long distances away andannounced that _Juiced.GS_ will continue to be published in 2000.  He alsoannounced the first new product of KFest 1999, unfortunately one that wasnot yet ready for release--the _Juiced.GS_ CD, appropriately titled"Friends For Life".  Following the address, _Juiced.GS_ sponsored areception in the Avila dorm (contrary to rumors, you did not need to have a_Juiced.GS_ tattoo in order to get the first drink free).     After a long, long night, sleep finally showed up at 3 a.m. or so.DAY 2   Day 2 began with a trip to the cafeteria for KFest breakfast."""""   I don't think I ever made a KFest breakfast in the first threeyears I attended, but over the last two, I've made quite a few.  Exactlywhy I've attended those, I'm not sure, but I have and I'll continue to.  Imean, cereal, milk, and Diet Pepsi are pretty much the same no matter whereyou are, and the company at KFest's better than the company at Pete'sPancakes.     Although that was how Day 2 began for me, Day 2 for KFest really beganwith the opening of HackFest at 7 a.m.  Organized by Sheppy, HackFest, inits second year, is a KFest programming contest.  Come up with somethingnew Apple II, work on it during HackFest, and maybe win a prize.  Therewere cash prizes, software, and books available for the participants.Anyone could enter, and anyone could win.     Day 2, like the other days coming, presented a KFest tradition and aKFest rarity.  The tradition as expected was dealing with toughchoices--for instance, do you see Sheppy's "ToolBox Programming in _GSoftBASIC_" or Joe Kohn's storytelling?  The rarity was that since there werefewer sessions than usual, there were fewer times when we needed to choose.     I started my KFest sessions by seeing Ewen Wannop explain the anatomyof _Crock O' Gold_, the sophisticated set of _Spectrum_ scripts that makeup the powerful Delphi offline reader.  Ewen showed how nearly anythingcould be done with scripts--evidence that _Spectrum_ could do everything.Evidence that would be important later.     Following Ewen, Sheppy presented some perspective and history onthings he's programmed as well as his style.  Sheppy discussed some of hishistory of programming with the Apple IIgs and went over the development ofthe brilliant _Shifty List_ program, and how he thought it was, at best, aneat hack.  _Shifty List_ has gone onto be an award-winning utility.Sheppy's use of _Shifty List_ as an example allowed him to discuss some ofthe relationship between beta testers and programmers and how testers canhave influence on what the final product looks like.     After a mostly forgettable lunch, "Hot Pepper" Dave Carey showed usall how to use the venerable _Print Shop GS_ and _Print Shop Companion_ todo things that most of us couldn't even imagine doing.  Dave's KFest doorwas filled with posters created with these well-used programs, and Dave iswell known for his unmatched prowess in creating beautiful art work.  Daveshowed how even the rank novice can create something beautiful.  After thiscame a true Geek's session.  Australian Richard Bennett, possibly bestknown as author of _Marinetti_, showed off how to use the long time yetmysterious programmer's debugging tool _GSBug_.  Very few people, includingthe programmers attending, knew how to use _GSBug_ the way Richard does.Richard gave a rundown of functions and commands as well as real-worldexamples of how to use _GSBug_ to best effect.     Here, Tony Diaz of Alltech Electronics showed off his new product--aCDROM collection called _A2-ROMulan_, including some rare things not seenin years.  The CD would be available for sale for the first time at thevendor fair on Saturday.     Later that night was dinner and a ride out to Sean Fahey's place.Sean is an avid Apple II user and collector who often gets calls frompeople who are ready to dispose of some Apple iI equipment.  Sean opened uphis garage to let us in and we saw what must have been more than a hundredApple II's of every vintage, as well as associated equipment.  Sean wasmostly wanting to simply clear space out in the garage so he could fit hisnew car in, and was not asking for money, but would take donations to giveto the women's shelter his wife volunteers at.  Sean's act of kindness andgoodwill is exactly what KFest is about.     Late night KFest activities included the usual--movies, hanging out,checking out other people's computers.  For the first time, it appearedthat virtual Apple II's have eclipsed physical ones at KFest--I countedmore Power Macs running _Bernie_ than I did Apple IIgs boxes.DAY 3:   I was still able to wake up early enough for KFest breakfast.""""""   That wouldn't last, of course, but the fact that I could still doit on a Friday was nothing short of amazing.  For my efforts I won a betwith Max Jones--his roommate was now enslaved to me.  I think Ewen was lessthan amused with the news.     Apple Computer's Craig Foos came to show us some new software,including QuickTime 4 and some video editing software, followed by StanMarks discussing the _AppleWorks GS_ database and Gina Saikin givingtechnical tips.  Stan impressed the Avila crowd with his mastery of thedatabase module, which led The Big Cheese herself to challenge the KFestcrowd to come up with their own topic to present at KFest 2000.  It seemsStan only decided to do his session after a lot of badgering by Mrs. Adams,as he didn't think he had a lot to offer to the KFest crowd.  It turns out,of course, he did.     Following lunch we saw a difficult choice: Joe Kohn's storytelling orSheppy's ToolBox programming in _GSoft BASIC_.  I split time between thetwo, hearing some of Joe's early years with BIg Red Computer Club and TheSource, and seeing how easy it was to create an authentic SYS16 programwith _GSoft BASIC_.  That session has sold me on the power that MikeWesterfield put into the hands of the people last year.  This was followedby a session on user groups and Sheppy presenting the _BeOS_.  As a _Be_user, I stayed and watched jaws drop as they oohed and aahed over themultimedia operating system.  Sheppy also showed off two _BeOS_ programs byKelvin Sherlock which were ported over from the IIgs--_BeShisen_ and _BeFlameStation_.  Way to go Kelvin!     The KFest banquet was held next, with the presentation ofawards--winners this year included Giselle Schnaubelt, Dave and AhrenCiotti, Ken Gagne, and others.  Congratulations to all our KFest contestwinners.     Before the big reason we were at the banquet came to pass, The BigCheese announced that yes, there would be a KFest 2000!  Ewen Wannop willbe working on the new logo design once he returns to England and recoversfrom the main event, which came next.     As the victim of honor, Ewen Wannop endured slings from Joe Kohn, MaxJones, Geoff Weiss, Richard Bennett, and myself.  From sheep jokes to pagethree girls to jabs about England's police system ("Stop!  Stop!  Or I'llyell 'Stop!' again!") to knightings, Ewen was thoroughly roasted.  He evenhad a song about _Spectrum_ sung to him and faced the dual questions ofwhat parts of _Spectrum_ he actually wrote and what can anyone else writewhen _Spectrum_ already does everything.  Ewen took it all in fun anddished it out in return, and got a standing ovation for his part.     The rest of Friday night was spent talking shop and hanging out.Sleep was mostly unknown, but the extra day at KFest was having an effect.The length of KFest would be about perfect--one more day and people wouldbe falling asleep during meals, not just during sessions.DAY 4   Saturday morning saw new product demonstrations and the"""""   announcement of HackFest winners.  Starting with fifth place, theHackFest winners were:     Cindy Adams (using a _Spectrum_ script) to prove she could;     Jeff Blakeney (using _GSoft BASIC) creating a Binary II wrapperstripper;     Richard Bennett (using, of course, assembly) making an iMac mouseemulator for the IIgs;     Shawn Beattie (using _GSoft BASIC_) with his Y][KFest countdown;     and Ken Gagne (using a _Spectrum_ script) for a database inspired byMax Jones.     It didn't hurt that Max was one of the judges, I guess.     The products shown off included the shareware products _SilvernCastle_, an 8-bit game written in Applesoft BASIC by Jeff Fink and_SpeedReadPlus_, an upgrade of a IIgs program by Terry Morris, both shownby Max Jones; _Sweet16 1.0_, the IIgs emulator for the _BeOS_ originally byF.E. Systems and now maintained by Eric Shepherd; the official _Bernie ][the Rescue Starter Kit_ by Ewen Wannop (distributed by Shareware SolutionsII) and the _Marinetti MacIP Link Layer Module_ from Richard Bennett.  Thiswas followed by the vendor fair, where the hardcore Apple II fanatics couldget hardware and software at bargain prices.     That night was the informal jaunt out.  I went to Jess & Jim's with abunch of KFesters and had more meat than I've had since last KFest.  KFestwas ending again, sadly, but there was one more KFest miracle this year.As we left Jess & Jim's, we spotted a personalized license plate fromMissouri.  The word on it?     BERNIEDAY 5:   Time to go.  Again.  For a few days in the heat of the July""""""   summer, my heart is nowhere else.  I gathered up my things andcaught a ride with The Big Cheese herself; we got some lunch and someshopping done, then got to the airport.  I ran into Steve Gozdziewski bysurprise there; his flight had been delayed home.     I could stay up all night and day thinking of folks to thank, but Iguess the ultimate thanks is to everyone.     Let's do it again next year.     Make time stand still.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :   What can you do at 3 AM?
