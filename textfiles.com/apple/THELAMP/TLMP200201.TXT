Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                [rsuenaga@a2central.com]                     MAY I HAVE THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE?                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     2001 was a great year for the Apple II, and to celebrate it, the ganghere at _The Lamp!_ consulted with some of our buddies in the Apple IIworld and came up with a list of the best that the Apple II world had tooffer in 2001.  We again highlight the best of Apple II achievement.     Keep in mind that the ultimate decision on whom each award went to wasmade strictly by the staff here at _The Lamp!_, namely, me, your editor andpublisher.  Any comments can be directed to rsuenaga@a2central.com.     BEST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT:   There were just a few contenders, but the     """"""""""""""""""""""""   winners this year are a couple of greatApple II CD ROM compilations.  _Juiced.GS_ followed up its stunning_Friends for Life_ CD ROM with _Friends II_, making its debut at KansasFest2001.  A few seats down from Max Jones of _Juiced.GS_ was Ken Gagne of_Gamebits_ with the multimedia file collection called _Espirit de AppleCorps_, a collection of sound and graphic files as well as the an AppleIIgs port of a classic game program we'll talk about in a bit.     BEST SHAREWARE PRODUCT:   The Man Down Under, Australia's Kim Howe,     """""""""""""""""""""""   has been one of the most prolific Apple IIprogrammers of recent years.  His _Telnet NDA_ New Desk Accessory makesopening telnet connections a breeze, and has become one of the best ways tochat on Syndicomm.com.  Kim got my shareware fee, as well as some others.     BEST FREEWARE PRODUCT:   We have a tie, but the clear winner in all     """"""""""""""""""""""   of this are Apple IIgs users.  _Spectrum_author Ewen Wannop added one more script based program to his long listwith _Spectrum Automated File Exchange_, aka _SAFE_.  _SAFE_ brings agraphical user interface to Apple IIgs File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for thefirst time ever.  Our second winner is an Apple IIgs version of the classicgame _Hammurabi_, the first publicly released Apple IIgs program ofaspiring programmer Thomas Compter, offering hours of fun for everyone.     BEST WORLD WIDE WEB SITE:  A2Central.com.  'Nuff said.     """"""""""""""""""""""""     BEST PUBLICATION:   Juiced.GS.  'Nuff said again.     """""""""""""""""     OUTSTANDING APPLE II RELATED DEVELOPMENT:   While some may feel that     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   it's the Apple II versionof the Borg, Syndicomm rescued several Apple II products from extinction orat least copyright limbo.  Eric Shepherd spent the early part of the summerburning up the email circuit and when KansasFest 2001 was said and done,products from EGO Systems, Parkhurst Micro Products, Ross Falconer, ByteWorks, APDA, and _Juiced.GS_ were all under (or soon to be) the Syndicommlogo.  Hope that logo's printed broadly, because the Apple II world is nowlargely on Syndicomm's shoulders.     OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT:   Once again, we have a tie.  The     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Man behind the development ofSyndicomm.com, David Miller, has put in countless hours to get thefledgling online service running like a champ, providing the Apple IIcommunity a permanent online home.  And in Indiana, Max Jones not only putout the best Apple II publication of recent vintage, when he decided hecouldn't do it anymore, he made sure that it found a home rather than rodeoff into the sunset.  Thanks, Dave and Max.     Congratulations to all our winners!  Here's hoping that 1999 bringsout the best in all of us again.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA]---------------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TAL]TRANSLATING EMAIL IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I recently received an email in French.

I wrote a Marinetti script that will send a RING tothe PC over a null-modem cable, wait for an AT command back from the PC andthen send an OK (this needs to be done several times as the PC sends modeminit strings and such before answering a call) and when the scripts gets anATA from the PC it sends back a CONNECT message and the script ends. Atthis point, the IIgs is expecting to start negotiating PPP options but thePC pretty much immediately starts trying to hang up the "modem".I'm not 100% sure that the Dial-Up Server is doing full dial up support forPPP. I think it is using its own proprietary system so only other Windowsusers can actually dial into your machine.If I could get this working, Windows 98 also comes with an Internet Sharingutility that I could use to let my null-modem connected IIgs surf the netthrough my DSL connection. Mind you, I could stop worrying about all ofthis if I got myself a router and set up an old machine as a unix machineto null-modem connect my IIgs to or better yet, just bought myself aLANceGS card and plugged my IIgs directly into the router. :-)Jeff BlakeneyDean of the Apple II University in the A2Pro Forum(JBLAKENEY, 3122.23, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>"""""Hi Jeff,Thanks for documenting what you have tried to get working.A null modem connection through dial up server seems a little round-a-bout,however good thinking!I've been thinking about the Direct Cable Connection service which doessupport null modem cables. I don't know what protocol it is using andhaven't been able to find out yet. Does anyone know about this?While there are other hardware options, I'd like to get a direct connectionto a PC working so network connections can be shared with a IIgs withouthaving to purchase a LanceGS or other network infrastructure.Cheers,Andrew(ROUGHANA, 3122.24, Delphi A2 web side)[EOA][ADA]ACCESSING DELPHI WITH YOUR Apple II"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""If your Apple II has access to telnet, but not Lynx, you can telnet to:sailor.lib.md.us (login as 'guest')and use Lynx on that site to access Delphi.To access Delphi go to:http://forums.delphiforums.com/my-forumsYou can set up a Delphi account from that page.
