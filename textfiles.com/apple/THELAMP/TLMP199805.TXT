In this way, Apple IIenthusiasts from all over the globe gather to make our computer a betterplatform, and our computing world a better place.  On any given day from myoffice or my home or even the public library a mile from my house, I havevirtual conversations and mail with Apple II enthusiasts in Canada,Australia, Germany, Switzerland, San Francisco, Arizona, New York, NewJersey, Nebraska, Chicago, Michigan, Texas, Kansas, San Diego, Los Angeles,and nearly everywhere in between.  The common experience of the Apple IIforges the ties between us and the fabric of the Internet--and, of course,the Delphi Online Service--serves to strengthen those bonds, and thevariety of our different real-world experiences gives us more to share withthose we meet.     While there may be fewer Apple II users than ever, the minimizing ofthe physical limitations between the remaining enthusiasts around the worldhas created a virtual team where the greatest Apple II minds can worktogether to continue to do what couldn't be done.     Two examples of the ongoing work that shows the continuing wonder ofthe Apple II were brought to us on May 1st--yes, normally we here at _TheLamp!_ don't cover stories that stretch into the month the issue isactually published, but like the Apple II itself, we try to beflexible--from two totally different areas of the world: Fremont,California, where Eric Shepherd, also known as Sheppy, released an updatedversion of _Wolfenstein 3D for the Apple IIgs_, and Switzerland, where F.E.Systems (_The Programmers Formerly Known As Bright Software_) released anew version of _Bernie ][ The Rescue_ (_The IIgs Emulator For ThePowerMacintosh Formerly Known As Fast Eddie_)--yet, one didn't existtotally separately from the other.  In fact, much of _Wolf_ was coded under_Bernie_ (and before he was eaten by some dog while skiing in the SwissAlps, our old friend _Gus_).  And when _Wolf_ was ready to start howling atthe Apple IIgs community, _Bernie_ changed his woof a bit so that ourMacintosh friends wouldn't be left out.     To take our global team theme even farther, consider that _Wolf_originally started its transition onto the Apple IIgs with Burger BillHeineman, in Southern California, and made its way into the hands ofSheppy, in Northern California--assistance with beta testing, art, and justabout everything else came from Apple II users in Europe, New England,Michigan, and Wisconsin, among other venues.  _Bernie_ has lived all of hislife in the Swiss Alps, but there are Bernie sightings in Australia, RhodeIsland, California, Michigan, Arizona, and Europe, at least.     Even those of us who live in the middle of the Pacific Ocean canappreciate such global teamwork.  It really is a Dream Team--Dream Team ][.                                [*] [*] [*]     Before I forget, here's your Blatant Plug for this issue: KansasFest1998, the Apple II event of the year, is on for July 22-26 at Avila Collegein Kansas City, Missouri.

It's not simply afew ROM chips that are swapped, it's the whole motherboard. Apart from theobvious ROM version difference, there's more RAM on board-- 1.125MB vs256K. There's also a few minor things like slightly better sound out of the3, but GS/OS makes the ROM 3 virtually identical to the ROM 01 to all wellwritten programs. [And the poorly written ones tend to be older demos thatwant the 00/01 only-- the ROM 01 is probably the most compatible machineout there]   As the main difference between the ROM 01 and 3 is amount of RAM, youcan add RAM to either to pull them both up to the max of 8.125MB. The 1MBon the ROM 3 won't cut it when running System 6-- 2MB total is almost aminimum. I feel that you're really going to want to add 2-4MB to any GS,and so if given the choice between an 01 and 3, unless the 3 was the sameprice or less (doubtful), I'd go with the 01. You get a much better bangfor the buck by spending $ on RAM, HD, or an accelerator versus paying morefor a ROM 3 cpu.Nathan Mates                        (NMATES, 11402, GO COM A2)>>>>>   As Nathan points out, there are considerable hardware differences"""""   between a ROM_01 and ROM_03.

Make note of the    battery's PLUS/MINUS directions (the black "+" end toward the    backplane). 5- Take the battery with you to the store, purchase the same battery, and    give them the old one to dispose of.

With sprites, you have a background and a foreground.Parts of the Ninjaforce MEGADEMO were done like this: Background picture inbank $00, Foreground picture in bank $01. So when a sprite is moved, setthe appropriate bits so that you READ from bank $00, and WRITE (withshadowing) to bank $01. This, however, only works when you have ONE spriteonly. About using the dp/stack: Basically, I'm using the dp because it'seasier to handle than the stack. The named caching could be done with x andy registers, plus you have the stz dp command as well, which is (believeme) quite handy. But, since you have much more flexible access, you don'tneed caching if the program that generates the sprite always sorts thecode. This can even be optimized for sprites that are shifted one byte.Stack blasters would need to lda dp, and #, ora #, then pha, where directpage blaster just does a lda dp, sta dp+1.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                             YOU'VE GOT MAIL!!                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     For ten summers now, the Apple II faithful have gathered in July at asmall college in Kansas City, Missouri.  The Apple II event of the year,KansasFest 1998, runs July 22-26, 1998, on the campus of Avila College.From the far corners of the earth as well as downtown Kansas City, Apple IIfanatics gather to celebrate the computer that started it all.     Planning such a trip can be as simple as getting in the car anddriving a few blocks for someone like Allen Moore; something morechallenging like getting in the car and driving a few hours--or more--forMax Jones or Ray Merlin; planning a cross-country flight, like Tony Diaz;or coming from across the ocean, like myself or Richard Bennett or EwenWannop.  Indeed, there are at least as many stories that could be titled,"How I got to KFest" every year as KFest attendees.     How, then, do between 50 and 100 Apple II fanatics from around theworld tie together the loose ends of their arrivals and departures in theLand of Ahhs?     In years prior to 1997, the center of the online Apple II Universe wasthe Genie (previously known as GEnie) online service, and the KFestfaithful would read and post messages coordinating every detail; from thebare essentials--who was arriving at Kansas City International Airport whenand by which airline, who was renting a car, and who needed a ride--to themerely important, such as a headcount for the pre- and post-KFest dinnersat local restaurants and requests for KFest sessions--to theextracurricular, such as who was hoping to room with whom and who wasbringing what equipment--to the absolutely esoteric, like what a turnpikeis and how many beers it takes to get Conan in a Librarial mood.  But as weall know, things have changed, and while we have moved many of the Apple IIfaithful from Genie to Delphi, some of our buddies haven't made the moveyet, or have decided to hang their online hat elsewhere.  What, then, isthe lowest common denominator to coordinate the KFesters this year?     The answer was simple: electronic mail.     Anyone with electronic mail (email, for short, of course) access hasthe ability to get and give the latest information on KFest.  Sponsored byDevin Reade's trenco.gno.org Internet server, the KFest Mailing List is anautomated mailing list that serves anyone who cares to sign up for it.  Theadvantage of this list is that it doesn't require the participants to haveaccess to the same online service or even the World Wide Web--anyone withaccess to Internet email can be a part of it.  It doesn't matter if you'reon America Online, Genie, Delphi, Compuserve, Primenet, Juno, Concentric,Netcom, Kestrok, or anywhere else.  In fact, I even receive KFest email atmy office.     For those of you who haven't been on a mailing list before, onceyou've signed up, you will send messages to and receive messages from justone email address--in this case, kfest@trenco.gno.org.  However, anymessage sent to the list will magically be sent to everyone else on thelist.  You can subscribe (or unsubscribe) from the list at any time, andyou don't have to be KFest bound to be part of it.     To sign up for the KFest Mailing List, send email to:     majordomo@trenco.gno.org     and in the BODY of the message (not the subject), place the followingtext:                subscribe kfest     In a few minutes you will be sent a confirmation message via email.In order to complete the signup process, respond to this confirmationfollowing the instructions given.  You will then be sent a welcome message,including instructions on how to send mail to the list.     Already in the KFest Mailing List we have discussed the traditional(and potential non-traditional) pre- and post-KFest eating spots, theKansas City International Airport's site on the World Wide Web, KFestsessions, KFesters volunteering help to other KFesters on a variety ofApple II subjects, and much much more.     If you have other informational needs regarding KFest, you may want tocheck out the KFest Web Page, at:     http://www.primenet.com/~adams/kfest.html     If you have a question that would be better sent to the KFestcommittee rather than the mailing list, you can address that to:     kfest-info@trenco.gno.org     Finally, thanks to Tony Diaz of Alltech Electronics, if rememberingtrenco.gno.org is too tough, you can also send mail to the KFest MailingList at:     kfest@apple2.org     KFest mail will brighten up even the most dreary Apple II electronicmail box.

Sooner or later, you'll encounter a file that youjust have to have, perfect for you in every way--except it has a ".ZIP"suffix on it.  Boom!  You've hit the MSDOS wall--the Zip format is theirpacking standard, just as the NuFX format (the one used by _Shrinkit_ and_GS Shrinkit_) is ours.  What to do, what to do--especially if you have a//e or //c?     While the well-known Apple IIgs solution to dealing with .zip files isthe shareware _PMP Unzip_, there is also a less-well-known 8-bit IIsolution, at an even better price: the $10 shareware _Unzip IIe_.     Borrowing heavily from the _Shrinkit_ interface, _Unzip IIe_ doesprimarily one thing, and does it well--it unzips .zip archives.  Like mostProDOS 8 programs, it's fast and efficient, and its interface ought to bevery familiar for 8 bit Apple II users.     _Unzip IIe_ will handle a variety of .zip archives without a hitch--infact, I didn't come across a single .zip archive it failed to handle.  Oneomission is the self-extracting (.exe) archives--no known Apple II programwill currently these in one step, although there is a two-step solution wemay look at next month.  _Unzip IIe_ also doesn't -create- .zip archives,but then again, it doesn't claim to.     In summary, _Unzip IIe_ is a simple, fast, and needed product.  Ameager $10 is a more than fair price to pay for a program that can quicklybecome invaluable.  For any 8-bit Apple II fanatic, _Unzip IIe_ is amust-have utility.[EOA][TVT]------------------------------                    THE VIRTUAL ][ |-----------------------------------The BernieBook--Macintosh Portables Go To The Dogs~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~by Ryan M. Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                  POWERBOOKS AND BERNIE ][ THE RESCUE FAQ                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The following article is set up in a form commonly seen on theInternet, called Frequently Asked Questions.  It is designed to answer someof the most common questions people have about using the Apple IIgsemulator _Bernie ][ The Rescue_ with an Apple Macintosh PowerBook.  It isnot designed to answer general questions about _Bernie_ or generalquestions about _PowerBooks_, although obviously there will be someoverlap.     Any questions about this article can be sent via email tothelamp@delphi.com.The HousekeepingQ: What's a FAQ, and how is it pronounced?A: The letters "FAQ" stand for _F_requently _A_sked _Q_uestions.  When   people first hear of or learn of a subject, such as the program _Bernie   ][ The Rescue_, they often have a number of questions which others   before them did when they also first learned of the same subject.  A FAQ   is a document listing both the questions and answers most frequently   associated with new users, to save themselves (and others trying to   assist them) time and frustration.   And by the way, it's pronounced "fack", nearly identical to "fact".Q: What is the purpose of this FAQ?A: This FAQ is set up to assist people interested in using the Apple IIgs   emulator _Bernie ][ The Rescue_ with an Apple Macintosh PowerBook.  Many   Apple II enthusiasts also have Macintosh computers or are considering   the purchase of a Macintosh, and many of those Macs are PowerBooks.   This document may assist those people with their general questions.  It   is as complete as possible given the recent release of an updated   version of _Bernie_ (May 1, 1998).Q: How can this FAQ be distributed?A: The content of this FAQ is copyright 1998 by Ryan M. Suenaga, the editor   and publisher of _The Lamp!_.  Distribution without the expressed   written consent of the copyright holder is prohibited.Q: Who do we have to thank for this FAQ?A: Special thanks to Henrik Gudat, Andre Horstmann, Urs Hochstrasser, and   the rest of the gang at F.E. Systems, formerly known as Bright Software,   for bringing _Bernie_ to the masses.  Additional thanks to some of the   Bernie Boys on Delphi, including Eric Shepherd, Dave Miller, and Kirk   Mitchell, for helping out with some questions I wasn't able to handle   myself.The ProgramQ: What is _Bernie ][ The Rescue_?A: _Bernie ][ The Rescue_, _Bernie_ for short, is an Apple IIgs emulation   program for the PowerMacintosh series of computers produced by F.E.   Systems in Switzerland.Q: What is emulation?A: Emulation means something acting like something else.  In regards to   computing, it usually means a computer acting like another computer,   through special hardware, software, or both.   While emulation has become popular in recent times, there is a long   history of emulation among personal computers.  Many years ago, the   _Trackstar_ board allowed Intel based MSDOS computers to emulate an   8-bit Apple II, for instance, and the Apple /// included Apple ][+ (and,   later, through the addition of a peripheral card, Apple //e) emulation.   The Macintosh has had hardware-based solutions for emulating Apple IIs   (the Macintosh LC //e card) and Intel based computers (the "DOS Cards"   offered first for the Centris 610, among many other Macintosh models) as   well as software-only solutions (_RealPC_, _Virtual PC_, and   _SoftWindows_) for years.  In fact, one of the more popular emulators in   the computing world is likely on your desktop: the Apple IIgs emulates   the 8-bit Apple IIs.   For more information on different emulators for the Macintosh, see   http://www.emulation.net.  For an excellent but somewhat dated article   on one microprocessor chip emulating another, leading to the development   of the Apple IIgs, see Tom Weishaar's excellent "A 65802/65816 pre-boot"   in the August 1986 (not 1996) issue of _Open-Apple_.Q: How can I get a copy of _Bernie_?A: If you have access to the World Wide Web, you can get a copy of the   current version of _Bernie_ (1.3 as of this writing) at the following   URL:   http://www.magnet.ch/emutech/Download/Parts/bernieconsumer.html   If you can successfully download from Delphi, _Bernie_ is available in   the database there as well.   If you do not have access to the Web, you can receive a copy of _Bernie_   on a floppy disk from Shareware Solutions II.  Their contact information   is:   Shareware Solutions II   166 Alpine Street   San Rafael, CA  94901-1008   USA   joko@crl.com   http://www.crl.com/~joko   You will also need to provide a copy of your real IIgs's ROM image.   More on this later.   _Bernie ][ The Rescue_ is a $25 (U.S. dollars) shareware program that   requires registration to make full use of it.  Details are included with   the program archive.Q: What are the minimum requirements for running _Bernie_?A: The minimum requirements for _Bernie_ are any PowerPC based Macintosh   and four megabytes of free RAM.  Realistically, PowerPC based Macs need   an absolute minimum of 16 megs of "real" (as opposed to "virtual") RAM   anyway, although some came with less.   _Bernie_ runs fastest when your Mac is set to display 256 colors, but it   will run regardless of this setting.Q: You mean this doesn't run on an Apple II?A: It doesn't run on an Apple II; it makes an Apple II run on your   PowerMac.Q: Where do I get the ROM?A: The only legal place to get a copy of the IIgs ROM image required for   using _Bernie_ is from an Apple IIgs.  There are instructions for   creating a ROM image in the official _Bernie_ documentation.   A ROM from either a ROM_01 or ROM_03 IIgs may be used.Q: Will it run on anything but a PowerBook?A: _Bernie_ will run on any Macintosh with a PowerPC processor, including   desktop Macs and Mac OS clones.  Additionally, there is another version   of _Bernie_ that will run under the _BeOS_ operating system for the   Macintosh and BeBox.  At this time, it will not run under the _BeOS_ for   Intel systems.Q: What's with the name?A: The original name for this program was _Fast Eddie_; however, a software   company that had a different product with a similar name contacted the   authors of _Eddie_, and _Eddie's_ handlers agreed to change his name.   After thinking it over for awhile, they decided on the name _Bernie ][   The Rescue_.Q: Okay, who's Bernie?A: The only Bernies I know are the dead guy in the _Weekend at Bernie's_   movies and the slugger for the Yankees.  I'm pretty sure they aren't the   ones the program is named after.Q: Well, then, who was Eddie?A: I know lots of Eddies, from my cousin Eddie to Eddie Van Halen, my   favorite being the famous surfer Eddie Aikau, a crew member of the canoe   Hokuleia who gave his life trying to find help when it started taking on   water during one of its early voyages from Hawai'i to Tahiti.  If you   ever come to Hawai'i, and see bunches of bumper stickers with the phrase   "Eddie Would Go" on them, it's in reference to huge surf that scares off   most waveriders, but into which Eddie Aikau would go.   But I don't think the program was named after him either.   Rumor has it that the Eddie _Fast Eddie_ was named after is Formula-1   driver Eddie Irvine.  This Eddie did so much crashing during early   stages of races in 1996 that the gang over in Switzerland felt a real   brotherhood with him.  Or at least that's the way the story goes.Q: Okay, if you won't tell me who Bernie is, then at least tell   me what's with all the dog jokes?A: Since _Bernie_ is housed in Switzerland, the F.E. Systems gang wanted to   show everyone their national pride.  A large St. Bernard is one of the   most recognizable symbols of that country, as they are famous for rescue   missions while patrolling the Swiss Alps.  _Bernie_ is named after those   St. Bernards.Q: Why didn't you tell me _Bernie_ was named after that?A: You only asked who Bernie was, not who _Bernie_ was named after.The PowerBooksQ: What is a "PowerBook"?A: A PowerBook is Apple Computer, Inc.'s Macintosh version of a "notebook"   or "laptop" computer, a portable computer that is designed to be taken   just about anywhere and run off of rechargable batteries.  There are   many different models of PowerBooks, including those with 68000, 68030,   68LC040, and PowerPC 603e, 603ev, and 750/740 ("G3") processors.Q: Are there any non-Apple-branded Mac OS compatible notebook computers?A: There was a computer known as an "Outbound" that functioned as a   68000-series Macintosh, but they've been out of production for some   time, at least in part due to copyright issues centering around the   Macintosh ROMs.   None of the recent Mac OS clone vendors was allowed to produce a   notebook-style computer, so there are no Radius, SuperMac,   PowerComputing, MacTell, UMAX, Motorola, or other clone vendor   notebooks.Q: Which PowerBooks can run _Bernie_?A: There are only a few PowerBooks which meet _Bernie_'s requirements   straight out of the box:   PowerBook 5300 series;   PowerBook 1400 series;   PowerBook 2400 series;   PowerBook 3400 series;   PowerBook G3 series;   and PowerBook Duo 2300 series.   Additionally, there are a few PowerBooks which can be upgraded to a   PowerPC processor, after which they'll be compatible with Bernie:   PowerBook 190 series;   PowerBook 500 series;   and PowerBook Duo 200 series   We say "series" because you may see several things appended to a   particular PowerBook's model number--for instance, a PowerBook 1400   series computer may specifically be called a "PowerBook 1400cs/166"   indicates a PowerBook 1400 with a color passive matrix screen and a 166   mhz processor.  A "PowerBook 2400c/180" indicates a PowerBook 2400 with   a color active matrix screen and a 166 mhz processor.   In the case of the PowerBook 500 and Duo 200 series, you will also see   some different numbers in the middle of the PowerBook's model   number--you will see a "PowerBook 520" or a "PowerBook Duo 230", for   instance.   With the exception of a few 5300's and upgraded 190's, 500's, and Duo   200's, every _Bernie_ capable PowerBook has a color screen built-in.   For what it's worth, there is no actual "PowerBook 500" or "PowerBook   Duo 200".Q: What's the difference between a "PowerBook" and a "PowerBook Duo"?A: Many PowerBook enthusiasts like to divide the various PowerBook models   along two lines: "All-in-ones" and "Duos".  Unfortunately, there are   actually three lines: "All-in-ones", "Almost-All-in-ones", and "Duos"   All-in-one PowerBooks make up the vast majority of all PowerBooks ever   made.  These PowerBooks have 3.5 inch floppy drives built-in (or as a   removable option), internal 2.5 inch hard disk drives, internal modem   capability (including on some models PC Card, aka "PCMCIA", modems), and   on the rear of the PowerBook, a series of "ports"--connectors similar to   what you see on the back of an Apple IIgs--for such things as serial   ports (including Localtalk connections), microphones, ADB devices,   Ethernet, and SCSI.   PowerBook Duos are Apple's version of the "sub-notebook".  These   computers do not include a built-in floppy drive, and the only   recognizable connectors on the back of the Duos are for power, one   serial port, and, if installed, a modem.  There is, however, a large,   thin, edgecard-style connector on the back of the Duo.  This is an   integral component in expanding the Duo.  The Duo can be connected to a   "dock" using this connector, which can have many of the ports that the   all-in-one PowerBooks have (if not more), as well as the missing floppy   drive.  Several docks have been manufactured by Apple Computer, Inc., as   well as others.  While many potential Duo users are scared off by the   lack of a floppy drive built into the Duo--and I was once one of them--I   have found the need for a floppy to be much less than anticipated, and   the lighter weight and small size are always blessings.   Unfortunately, neither the Duo nor any of the docks are in production   any longer.   Almost all-in-one PowerBooks are fairly rare--there are only two,   really: the PowerBook 100 and the PowerBook 2400 series.  These   PowerBooks are like the Duo in that they are smaller than the   all-in-ones and have no internal floppy drive but instead of requiring a   dock, all of the ports are already present on the rear of the PowerBook,   like the all-in-ones--including the port for the floppy drive.Q: I have a PowerBook XXX.  Can my PowerBook be upgraded to run Bernie?A: With the exceptions listed above--PowerBook 500 series, 190 series, and   Duo 200 series--none of the PowerBooks can be upgraded to PowerPC   processors, meaning no _Bernie_.Q: I have a PowerPC-upgradable PowerBook.  Where can I find the upgrade?A: Depends on which upgrade you're looking for.   There were several versions of the PowerPC upgrade for the PowerBook 500   series.  Apple Computer, Inc. made one, and Newer Technology licensed   the Apple technology and created higher performance ones.  While the   Apple one does not appear to be made any longer and cannot be easily   found, the Newer Technology models are relatively easy to find, but they   aren't inexpensive.   The Duo 200 series is upgradable with a motherboard swap, manufactured   by Apple but apparently no longer available, which makes whatever Duo   model you have functionally identical to a Duo 2300c, excepting the   built-in screen.  The Duo 2300c motherboard has connectors for both IDE   and SCSI drives built-in, so you can use your old SCSI 2.5 inch drive or   a new IDE 2.5 inch drive, depending on your needs (the cable for the IDE   drive does not come with the 2300c motherboard, and it may be difficult   to find).   Similarly, the PowerBook 190 is upgradable with a motherboard swap to   PowerBook 5300 performance.  I have never seen one of these upgrades   available.Q: What "catches" are there when buying a PowerBook for use with Bernie?A: Unless the prices are incredibly attractive and you have a source of an   upgrade lined up, it's probably more sensible to buy a PowerBook already   suited for Bernie than an upgradable one.  The cost and scarcity of the   upgrades tend to make them less appealing.   Additionally, the non-2300 model Duos and 500s have 2.5 inch SCSI drives   installed.  These are no longer made new (although you can find new   "SCSI" 2.5 inch drives, they are usually quite expensive converted IDE   drives) and fairly difficult to come by, especially in reasonable sizes   for today's Macs.  While the Duo motherboard swap gives an upgraded Duo   the capability of using IDE drives, it lacks the necessary cable to   attach such a drive.Q: Where else can I get PowerBook information?A: There's lots of PowerBook information available on the World Wide Web.   For starters you can try:   http://www.ogrady.com   http://powerbook.apple.com   http://www.powerbook1.comExpansionQ: How can I expand my PowerBook?A: The PowerBook is a closer relative in form factor to the //c than the   IIgs--like both the //c and IIgs it has "ports"--connectors on the rear   of the computer that allow you to connect to external devices.  Common   ports on the back of the PowerBook are a power port, serial port, SCSI   port, ADB port, microphone port, and speaker port.   Some PowerBooks also have internal modems, some of the PC Card   style--roughly the size of a credit card but about 1/8th of an inch   thick--and some uniquely designed for a PowerBook.  There are also   Ethernet ports, video ports, and removable storage (floppy drive, Zip   Drive, Magneto Optical drive, hard drive, CD ROM).   Unlike the IIgs, PowerBooks don't have "slots", with one   exception--Duos, when docked in certain models of dock, have access to   NuBus slots.  However, some PowerBooks can use the PC Cards (formerly   known as PCMCIA) that are prevalent with Intel-style notebook computers,   to add such things as modems, memory, hard drive storage, and Ethernet   capability.   Aside from Duos in certain docks, none of the Bernie-capable PowerBooks   have two serial ports.  They all have one--the "Printer/Modem Port",   meaning you cannot use two external modems with Bernie.  However, under   Bernie, you can choose your internal modem as an equivalent to the IIgs   modem port.  More on this later.   You can add RAM and larger hard drives to PowerBooks as well.  You must   remember that when you do this, you usually will need to replace your   existing memory card or hard drive with another, leaving you with the   older components as spares.Using Modems and PrintersQ: Is the serial support ever going to be finished?A: Yes.Q: When?A: When it's ready.Q: When do we get to see what's done so far?A: Whenever you register _Bernie 1.3_.  This is the first version of Bernie   to support serial ports through the CerealPuffs(tm) emulation and the   InkDirect printing.  Once you've registered _Bernie_, you can set the   IIgs Printer Port and the IIgs Modem Port through the Edit Preferences   menu.  This also requires the Macintosh Appearance Manager be installed.   You can choose any Macintosh serial port or device recognized as such   (primarily the serial ports on the back of the Mac and/or an internal   modem) for use with this emulation.   While there is a way to go before calling this emulation "perfect", it   is a remarkable accomplishment.  It has appeared to work better so far   with faster Macs and PC Card modems.More AssistanceQ: How can I get help with something not covered here?A: For further assistance with _Bernie ][ The Rescue_, you can check out   the Delphi A2 Forum, as well as the Delphi A2 Conference, where you may   often run into GUDATH, aka Henrik Gudat, one of Bernie's handlers.
