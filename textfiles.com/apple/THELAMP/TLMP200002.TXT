HGR graphics now work right on Intel systems.2. Low-level mouse emulation is in place, which means most 8-bit   applications with mouse support now work right. There are a handful of   exceptions.3. Switching to full-screen mode now hides the mouse.4. Fixed a minor glitch where the speed display might show a negative   number for a moment when you first start up.5. Fixed a couple of rare crashes. So rare that nobody ever reported them,   except for a couple of really crafty testers.6. The Mount Physical Disks window's list items are taller, so the icons   aren't squished flat anymore.There are just a couple of minor new features:1. Added 20 MHz and 40 MHz speed options to the speed control slider in the   preferences. Obviously if your computer isn't fast enough to emulate   these speeds, it's not going to help you much.2. Added 0.25 and 0.5 MHz speed options too. Why you'd want them, I don't   know.

Inotherwords you can use your IIgs to create homemade subtitles on a foreignfilm, add letter titles and animated graphics, make "stainglass" ortransparent logos (such as most TV stations now use in the corner) or justhave fun doddling on the faces of characters on TV. :) I believe you'drequire two VCRs to make a recording any of your video mixing however.The other use is to bring an NTSC video signal onto your AppleColor RGBmonitor, either by itself or underlapping a IIgs application (i.e. watch TVwhile using ProTERM 3.1 on the same screen, or just turn your RGB screeninto a dedicated game console display). The input video image *cannot* beput in a sizeable window, it's just full screen or nothing.Yet another use of the card is to output _true_ and clean NTSC video fromyour IIgs. That is Super-Hi-Res graphics output to a TV set or VCR will nothave fringing and a rainbow affect. Everything will look crisp and clearwith correct colors, unlike the built-in composite-out port in back of theIIgs. The card is worthwhile for this feature alone IMO.Still another use is viewing interlaced graphics. SuperConvert, and Ibelieve at least one slide show demo out there, will let you look at320x400 and 640x400 images on the AppleColor RGB (interlaced mode doesindeed pull off these higher resolutions, but at a cost of flickering quitea bit). Incidentally, there's a IIgs Video Graphics Controller chip (VGC)on every Video Overlay Card, which means you could in theory write softwarethat lets you view 4,096 color Super-Hi-Res graphics on an Apple IIe.Unfortunately very little software, if any at all, was ever written to takeadvantage of the VOC, much like the Second Sight. I still have one slotfree in my ROM 3 system, and it's reserved for a VOC if I can ever findone. :)Mitchell Spector {<mailto:cw308@torfree.net> cw308@torfree.net}(28953, SPECTOR1, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""28963 23-JAN 03:16 General Chatter     Video Overlay Card (Re: Msg 28946)     From: JBLAKENEY    To: WILLIEYEO (NR)In message 'Video Overlay Card' WILLIEYEO said:> What can one do with an Apple II Video Overlay Card ?You can use the Card to Overlay computer images onto Video. :-)I've used mine to do titling of home videos and have always wanted to useit to add some cheesy animated effects to some of my home made movies.You can also use it to watch TV or videos on your IIgs' RGB monitor whichgives you a really nice picture. You can even overlay your desktop on thatvideo and continue to use your IIgs while the video plays behind your work.Also, using SuperConvert, you can view images in 640x400 interlaced modewhich is kind of nice at times. There is an archive floating around of ademo called VOC.400 that has an Applesoft program with an assembly routinethat displays a slide show of 640x400 images using the VOC. I have thearchive here if anyone would like me to upload it to Delphi and it isn'talready here.I also came up with a method that would allow you to view 640x200 with 16colours or 320x200 with 256 colours but it would require tweaking the cardto adjust the "focus" of the resulting image as well as software that Ihaven't written yet.If FaceLift were to ever be released, I'd be tempted to write a driver toallow you to run your desktop in 640x400 mode because, interlace flickeraside, being able to do that from time to time can definitely be an asset. Jeff Blakeney Dean of the Apple II University in the A2Pro forum[EOA][RST]RYAN SUENAGA PLANS WORLD TOUR!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hi, I normally don't post from webside, but I'm kinda stuck :) In any case,I will be doing a rather long trip pre and post KFest this year (withMacWorld and KFest stuck in the middle of it), and if any Apple II usergroups are meeting and would welcome me as a guest (I would be willing tospeak if that's a requirement :) I'd like to know about it.

Simply because JPEGView takes only a few moments to view the image,while JepGS can take several minutes or as much as an hour or more (evenwith a 15 MHz accelerator). I personally find viewing JPEG on a IIgsunbareable and unacceptable.

The connection is kept open for a short while toensure any packets sent by you or the machine you are connected to have achance to get through.In the scripts I whipped together ages ago as a way to test my POP3 logic,I used a Set TCPClosedResponse command and watched for that text whiledoing my POP3 stuff and if I received it, then I do my Close TCPSocketcommand. This results in a delay between receiving my last e-mail and thescript actually ending but it has a couple of benefits. It means that whenthe script ends, the socket will be closed and it also gives you a way tobe able to detect and clean up stuff if the socket is closed by the serverprematurely. Jeff Blakeney Dean of the Apple II University in the A2Pro forum(2868, JBLAKENEY, GO COM A2P)>>>>>"""""Be aware that if you close a socket before all the data has arrived, youmight run into problems.Spectrum allocates a 4K buffer for data that it requests in a TCPIPReadTCPcommand. If a socket closes before all the data has arrived, Marinetti willincorrectly send everything it has back, and not just the amount requested.If the amount of data waiting is greater than 4K, this will overwrite theend of the allocated buffer and cause Spectrum to crash.This is a bug in Marinetti, as Spectrum is following the rules correctly.Richard knows about this bug, and should be issuing an update to Marinettiat some time in the future.Whether this is a real problem or not depends on what you are doing whenyou close the socket. Probably most things you do will be OK. However I canrepeat the bug at will by accessing a web page that is greater than 4K.When reading web pages, the socket is not closed by you, but by the hostsending the page. The close notification is 'pushed', and so Marinettireturns more than it was asked for on the next read, and crashesSpectrum...As to the TCPOnline variable.

Suenaga, M.S.W, L.S.W.         [thelamp@sheppyware.net]        APPLEDESIGN: The Work of the Apple Industrial Design Group        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                    by Paul Kunkel                    Photos by Rick English                    287 pages                    Published by Graphis Inc., New York, New York     Whether you're a fan of Apple Computer, Inc. now, then, or just a fanof the Apple II, you'll enjoy at least parts of this book, which couldpossibly be titled _The History of Apple Computers In Pictures_.  Thatwouldn't be 100% accurate, as the history here is more in the work of oneparticular group at Apple rather than the entire company--the groupresponsible for the designs of their computers and peripherals.     Also note I said "Apple Computers" and not "Apple Computer, Inc."  Thebeauty of this book is not so much in the descriptions of what happened inthe company (although the timeline is well-done, humorous, and insightful)as much as it is in the beautiful photographs that fill a large section ofthe book.  In it you will see photos of computers that were and never were.There are concept designs which never saw the light of day as well asprototype designs that came to be some of the most influential machines ofour time.     Of particular interest to Apple II fans will be a number of differentmock-ups of the Apple //c (how different our lives could have been if theyhad indeed produced it with an integrated LCD screen!), the Apple IIgskeyboard (known in this book as the "Universe"), and a multitude of designsleading to the original release of the Apple IIgs in 1986.     Most intriguing for the Apple II fan is a feature on a projectreferred to as "Contessa", which is touted as a follow up to the AppleIIgs.  While it appears much the same as the Mark Twain Apple IIgs machinesthat have been sighted in recent years, the dates for Contessa and Twaindon't match up.  Additionally, the front of the case is emblazoned "AppleIIsi".     While _AppleDesign_ does not fall into the category of Apple II"must-reads", it certainly provides a fascinating viewpoint into what was,what became, and what could have been for the Apple II.  If you are aMacintosh fan, there are many other reasons to buy the book.  One way oranother, it's definitely worth at least a more-than-passing glance in thebookstore.[EOA][DRM]------------------------------                         DREAMWARE |-----------------------------------The Apple IIgsX2""""""""""""""""by Lyle Syverson   [lyle837@delphi.com]First, let's define Dreamware:     Dreamware is a combination of computer software and hardware that onedreams would be nice to have and might even be possible to produce.  Thespecifications might change many times before it becomes a reality.     Extra IIgs CPUs can be acquired for a very reasonable price.     So come on this imaginary tour with me.  Notice that there are twocases, one on top of the other.  One each of monitor, keyboard, and mouse.The power supply sits on the bottom shelf and supplies power to both units.The disk drives are tucked into the cases.  Both units have an accelerator.     The hard drive in unit 1 is regularly backed up to the hard drive inunit 2 and vice versa.     Multitasking with the IIgs!  In the lower left corner of the monitorscreen are two virtual lights and a radio button.  A mouse click on theradio button switches the monitor display and the keyboard/mouse to theother unit.     Brousing the WWW... convert a graphic on one unit while reading texton the other.     Music while word processing.     Print a large project while moving on to the next project.     Chat online while downloading files.     A printer "translator".  Send a print job from Print Shop GS from oneunit to the other.  The second unit receives instructions to print to anImagewriter II, translates it to instructions for a HP DeskJet, and sendsit to the printer.     Well, you get the idea.  The next project after the IIgsX2 ?  Howabout the IIgsX4 ?[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
