It lets you lock your computer so nobody can use it without knowinga password you specify.  While locked, the CDA menu is disabled, and thescreen is black, except for the window asking for the password.  Eachfailed attempt to access your computer causes a counter to increase, so youcan see when you return to your desk if anyone tried to get into your AppleIIgs.  Note that the Apple II is an open system and there are ways aroundthis, such as rebooting the system, but it will keep casual looky-loos out.Uploaded by the author, Eric Shepherd.Tony Ward, A2 Librarian(A2.TONY, Cat 2, Top 37, Msg 21)[EOA][TPA]THE PROTECTOR IS NOW AVAILABLE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The Protector is now available!

I have been anApple II user since 1979.  Today I am an Apple II collector with a dozenmachines in my personal collection.  I am also a staff member of SyndicommOnline and host a weekly chat (RTC or Real Time Conference) in the A2 Forumevery Wednesday from 7:00pm to 9:00 pm Pacific time.  However this grouppurchase I am organizing is not affiliated with Syndicomm Online as I amdoing it on my own.Q: What is in this for you?A: I have been a supporter of the Apple II for a long time and typically dosmall requests for free (making disk images mostly).  When I heard that NoSlot Clock's were still available for purchase I ordered one.  Once I foundout how easy they were to install and setup I decided to organize a grouppurchase.  If I am able to put together a minimum order of 25 units I amwilling to go ahead with the purchase.  I am doing this at cost + 10% ofthe unit cost per chip.  With this 10% I hope to earn enough to take mywife and child out to dinner.  I am not normally in the Apple II hardwarebusiness.Q: Are the batteries fresh? Hasn't it been a long time since NSC's (No SlotClocks) were manufactured?A: NSC's were originally sold for the Apple II by Systems ManufacturingTechnologies of San Marcos, California starting in the late 1980's.  It ismy understanding that all they did was resell Dallas SemiconductorSmartwatch chips.  Dallas Semiconductor still manufactures them as they arestill used in a variety of components.Q: Will these clocks work on Dos 3.3, CP/M and Pascal?A: I am able to provide the proper patches for ProDOS only.  I am unawareof patches for other OS's.  However I am including the source code for theProDOS patch so you may be able to devise your own.Q: Which models of Apple II will they work in?A: They will work in any Apple II with a 28-pin ROM socket.  The Apple IIe,Apple IIc and Apple IIc+ all have such ROM sockets for their system ROM's(CD ROM, EF ROM or CF ROM) on the motherboard.  The Apple II / II + lacks a28-pin ROM socket on the motherboard but I've been told they will workunder a 28-pin ROM socket on a peripheral card.Q: Will this work properly in an accelerated Apple II such as a IIc plus?A: Yes, it works fine.  I tested this myself on my Apple IIc plus and theonly thing I found was the utility that sets the clock failed to detect thepresence of the chip if running at 4MHz speed.  Rebooting at 1Mhz speed(holding down the 'esc' key on bootup) allowed it to detect the chip andproperly set the time.  The patched ProDOS *does* read the time properly ateither 1MHz or 4MHz speed.  So outside of the occasion when you need to setthe time there are no issues that I found.Q: What is the cost?A: Price is dependent upon quantity I am able to purchase.  Here is theinfo I have at this time from Dallas Semiconductor (In US$):Quantity    1-24: $27.21Quantity   25-99: $21.47Quantity 100-999: $17.68Quantity   1000+: $14.51These prices include Canadian GST (7%) and a 10% markup.  Sometimes GSTisn't charged so if that happens I will pass on the saving to you.Shipping is extra but shouldn't be much since they are pretty light.  Youpay whatever it costs me to ship it to you.  I do not make any money onshipping.  Of course the more you buy the less the per unit shipping costwill be.Q: Will you ship International (outside Canada and USA)?A: Yes but shipping cost will be adjusted accordingly.Q: Where is the software available?A: I will provide all the software you need to patch ProDOS and set theclock via e-mail (free) or diskette (cost of diskette).Q: How do I put my name on the list?A: Send an e-mail letting me know how many you would like.  I will send youan e-mail confirming that you are on the list.  My e-mail address is(decode spam block) "mark at syndicomm dot com".  If you don't receive aconfirming e-mail within a couple of days, resend.Q: When will you place the order?A: My thinking is that a minimum order of 25 would give us a decent pricebreak and worth doing.  I would really like to be able to order 100minimum.  I don't think 1000 is realistic.  Once I have everybody I thinkis interested I'll make a "last call", provide specific shipping cost andask for money.  Once all the money is collected I'll place the order.Dallas Semiconductor says they have the chips in stock and estimate 4business days for me to receive them.  I will then notify you when Ireceive them and again when I ship your order.Q: Your e-mail address has you with Syndicomm Online.  Is this group buyaffiliated with Syndicomm Online?A: No.  I am on staff with Syndicomm Online but they have no connectionwith this group purchase.  The success or failure of this purchase istotally my responsibility.(MARK, Cat 17, Top 6, Msg 26)[EOA][SGD]SuperDrive CONNECTED TO IIgs DISK PORT""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""A fair while back I converted most of my 3.5" drives to SuperDrives but Ileft a few in case I should someday run across a program that wasincompatible.

I now use an external 20x burner, and an 8x and 16xinternal burner, all of which are slow by today's standards. It is too soonto say whether any of the disks from those burners have failed over time.For CD-Rs only, it seems to make no difference as to what speed a disk israted at, it burns quite happily at the 20x maximum I can manage. In factas faster burners have appeared, I have seen old packages of CD-R disks onsale have labels stuck on them to say they are now rated at a higher speed!>> know that (in my limited experience) burn speeds do affect the chancesof getting a clean burn initially <<A burner should be increasing the power of the laser when it burns at afaster speed, so this should not be a factor. What can be more important isthat the older burners, which are not burn-proof rated, require data to befed to it in a constant stream. If your computer is also old and slow, thenit might not be doing this cleanly. USB burners should be avoided like theplague.

And since most people will have moved on to a differentstorage medium by then (DVD, and/or whatever is coming beyond that),there's no problem. Think about how much of your important data is sittingon media that is older than 10 years. If it's a lot, you're flirting withdisaster anyway.Almost (if not all) CD-R/RW media comes from Japan and Taiwan. The Japanesediscs are generally regarded as superior because of their higher level ofquality control. Look on the outer label, usually near the UPC code, tofind out where a package was made.But the material is really what determines the longevity. Many of thecheapie brands use Cyanine dye on a silver reflective background. To my eyeit just looks silver, with no tinting. It may also be used on a goldbackground, which would make it appear bright green. I use these all thetime, but I'm not sure I'd trust them as a permanent backup solution. Thisis the kind that is more susceptible to sunlight damage.If you want to buy the best, look for Phthalocyanine dye. It's got adarker, dull green tint if the disc has a silver background, oryellowish/green on a gold background. Silver is the most common, but themore expensive gold will not oxidize and thus will last longer, probably100 years or more if kept safe. By the way, it doesn't seem to matter whatcolor is on the top of the disc. And just because the top looks golddoesn't mean the underside reflective layer is gold. Flip it over and looknear the outer or inner rim.Burn speed may affect a disc's initial quality (ie. sometimes you might geta "bad burn" that creates a useless coaster), but longevity should not beaffected once the disc is successfully burned. I have read that thePhthalocyanine dye is less tolerant of high speed burns, but I have notfound that to be the case in my personal use.But does all that really matter? Discs are so cheap now (I usually buywhatever 50-pack spindle Best Buy has on sale w/rebate for $2.99) that youcan afford to burn two copies of your important data: One for general use,and one to keep safe as a backup.

The prototype of the hardware isready.  People are working on the software.  In fact the card, calledAnyCard, also includes hardware for a VGA monitor connection, an IDEconnection, and a connection for a CompactFlash.  Many hours writingsoftware lie ahead to get it all going.[EOA][CKR]CINDY'S KFest 2003 REPORT"""""""""""""""""""""""""KFest 2003 reportOver the years it's become somewhat of a tradition for me to write a reportwhile I was waiting for my flight home. This year, I made a mad dash to getan earlier flight than I had planned, so I'm writing this on the plane. Itwas a BIG rush, but I got up at 6:45, and made it to the airport in time toreturn the rental car and make a 9:30 flight!Tuesday - July 22KFest begins with the arrival of a lot of long time friends, and quite afew new ones. I think there were 17 newbies this year. The main group wentto Sweet Tomatoes for dinner, but a renegade group went to Stephenson'sApple Orchard. I can only report on the Stephenson's group, and I know weall had a wonderful time and enjoyed the food and beverages!Woz arrives!! Things were kind of quiet, so I was wandering around thesecond floor looking for new people. I walked by a room and saw a man Ididn't know standing by the window. I said hi and introduced myself. Whenhe turned around, I was shocked to see that it was Woz, and in my mosteloquent voice I said, "Wow, I know who you are!" Good grief. I welcomedhim to KFest and we talked a few minutes. He had not expected to be in adorm, and asked if I could find Howard to see about getting him to a hotel.I asked if he'd like me to go find Howard, or if he'd like to walk aroundwith me. He opted for the latter.We went upstairs and found a group of people watching the DVD of his speechfrom the '80's. He got a kick out of that and watched for a few minutes. Itwas fun watching the KFesters as they realized who he was. Then we wentinto the hall and Tony Diaz started showing him some of the hardwarecollection. It didn't take very long for a crowd to gather.Wednesday - July 23Woz makes the Keynote Address. It took some creative planning, but theschedule for today was changed and the Keynote was before the Kookout. Woztalked about his early life and how it had been influenced by variouspeople and books. He spent over two hours enthralling everyone inattendance. He then opened it up for questions.I hate to admit it, but I ducked out to spend the day with a long timefriend, so I missed the Kookout and autograph session.Thursday - July 24KFest sessions begin! Tony Diaz had a arranged a day full of sessions forthe programers and normal users alike.As usual, the evening was full of visiting with friends, making new ones,and learning all about computers!Friday - July 25More sessions and The Roast of Geoff Weiss, and what a roast! Ken Gagne hasbecome a great MC, and helped to organize a fantastically funny roast. Mostof the presenters had spent HOURS working on their very high techpresentations. (myself excluded) Max jones, Richard Forest-Bennett, RyanSueanage, Eric Shepherd, and myself had the pleasure of roasting Geoff.I hope he will forgive us!The late night activities included some sitting in the floor, a trip to seea movie (not Planet of the Apes), and what I heard was an expedition toIHOP about 3:00 am.Saturday - July 26Another day of presentations, contests, and spending money at the VendorFair, followed by the annual trek to KC Masterpiece. The winners of theGShisen contest, HackFest, and CansasFest were announced, and some greatprices were awarded. After seeing the Palm that Steve G won in GShisen,I think I'd better practice for next year!I want to say a big thanks to everyone that helped to make this the bestKFest in quite a while.Now it's time to start planning and looking forward to KFest 2004. Thedates were announced as July 20-25, 2004. One other little announcement wasmade that I'm returning to my former job as The Big Cheese.A big thanks to The Grand Gouda for giving me a few years vacation andletting me just enjoy KFest!I hope that we can keep the excitement going and have another wonderfulKFest in 2004.CindyThe Big Cheese(CINDYADAMS, Cat 5, Top 5, Msg 97)[EOA][EKF]ENJOYED KansasFest""""""""""""""""""I really enjoyed myself at KansasFest 2003.  There were so many neat newpeople there and a lot of people that I've not seen in a few years.  TheWoz Keynote was a real treat.  I learned lots of new tricks and enjoyedevery session I had the pleasure of attending.The Syndicomm PizzaFest rocked (Special thanks to Eric and Sarah).The contest prizes were really great.  (I was really hoping to win the ZipGS, what a great prize...thanks Lyle).Thanks to the presenters, the planners and the attendees.
