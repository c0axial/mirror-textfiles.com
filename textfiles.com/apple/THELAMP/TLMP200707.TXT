Many incidents are seconds in length, and mostly unnoticedbut others have lasted as long as 10 or 15 minutes.AT&T has been on site twice. Because this is an intermittent problem,they've had difficulty finding the problem and want to blame whatever iscausing the service disruption on premise wiring.However, I'm confident the premise wiring is fine. I've been able todemonstrate to the technician that static occurs at nearly predictableintervals (the static causes the modem to lose signal sync) and that it wason their circuit coming into my building.I asked to be switched to a new pair, and after searching, the techniciancouldn't locate a clean pair because all the other circuits in the area hadstatic, ground faults or other issues. It's likely everyone in my area ishaving the same trouble but doesn't realized it.A construction crew has been dispatched to find or build a clean circuitfor A2Central. I don't know how long it will take, but I was told it couldbegin as early as Friday. When I've been notified of completion, then wewill begin stress testing. Unfortunately, during stress testing, all ofA2C's services will be unavailable.I'll try to keep everyone informed but often these things happen on shortnotice. If you're keen to get the latest info, you'll probably find itfaster on our irc server where several people are monitoring and loggingA2C's service disruptions. You can join us at: irc.a2central.com in channel#a2c.chat.Thanks - and sorry for the inconvenience.Sean FaheySysOp(sfahey, a2c,system_announcements, Jun 22 2007)>>>>>"""""I've been monitoring our circuit for additional outages (and giving theweather a chance to prove it had something to do with it) and so far, weappear to be back to normal. SBC rebuilt the circuit from the CO to mysubdivision and that appears to have corrected the problem.Now, Mr. Murphy will appear in the form of a total outage or hard drivecrash.<waiting expectantly for the next disaster>(sfahey, a2c,system_announcements, Jul 09 2007)[EOA][AKE]AII Keyboard Encoder""""""""""""""""""""Anyone need or have extra an Apple II keyboard encoder MM7540AAEOne of these parts blew on one of my old Apple II keyboards.  After quite anumber of inquiry's I found a source for replacement parts, but the cost ishigh $33(each, quantity 12) and there is an minimum order of $200.00 ineffect.  Anyone have a need for these and interested in sharing with thecost.If you have extra encoder of this type, let me know if you are willing topart with it.If I decide to order them on my own, I will offer extras for resale on mywebsite, at some additional cost. If you go in with me now, I will sharecost with no markup.Regards,Mike Willegalwww.willegal.net(mwillega, a2c.general_chat, Jun 29 2007)[EOA][WIP]Woz Interview on Portal Site""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Ken Gagne posted an article linking to an interview with Woz. In thatpiece, Woz talks about how he coded the Apple II back in the day, and howhe'd like to publish the code and schematics along with explanations of histhinking at the time.Personally, I'd like to see him do just that. I'd also like it if he'd takeit a step further and get the Apple II platform "open sourced" if you will,or at least help us get it legally established that it's OK to clone theApple II like it's OK to clone the Apple 1.Ideas?(sfahey, a2c.general_chat, Jul 10 2007)[EOA][NAE]Nice alphaSyntauri on eBay""""""""""""""""""""""""""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300125604256If only I lived in LA... and had the reserve amount... and could play thekeyboard worth a damn...<sigh>(sfahey, a2c.music_multimedia, Jun 29 2007)[EOA][AST]Apple IIe as a Serial Terminal for a Linux Box""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""This kind of thing is probably simple and old hat to many of you but Ifigured I'd post it in case it is of interest.  I recently acquired anApple IIe and by design of the room it sits next to my main desktop machine- the one I'm typing this on.Some of you on IRC might remember a dude (that would be me) dropping by toask about null modem connections and term programs necessary to make theIIe useful as a Linux terminal.Well after a little poking around, I got it working.  While this procedureis probably obvious to most hobbyists who have had to move data around,this is likely to be of use to Linux users who might have an old Applesitting in the closet:http://www.dataswamp.net/apple2eserialterm/There are some photographs / screenshots near the bottom of the page.This is a "short-cut" to making an Apple useful; not as cool, obviously, asconnecting to the net natively via Contiki, but better than gathering dust!Can anyone recommend a term program for the IIe that deals with high ASCIIcharacters?  As you can see in my how-to, I'm using Modem MGR which does agood job of VT220 emulation, but prints ASCII for lines and corners inthings like menu configuration.Thanks.   -Quag7(Quag7, a2c.network_telecomm, Jul 07 2007)>>>>>I do not think that you are asking the right question since there is noconcept of "high ASCII" text on the Apple II.  I am assuming you are usingVT102 terminal emulation (based on the screen shots).  Look at the VT102User Guide at http://216.92.110.6/docs/vt100-tm/ek-vt100-tm-002.pdf andnote the contents of the 304th page (page A-12) and pages 6-10 to 6-12 ingeneral.The IIe text character set doesn't support all the VT102 special graphiccharacters.  I recall Proterm for the Apple II did a good job supporting asmany as possible.  Proterm is still commercial software the last I heardand more information can be found on Intrec's Web site (you can atleast geta phone number or email address).Geoff(geoff, a2c.network_telecomm, Jul 08 2007)>>>>>"""""I can't think of anything 8-bit that would work. If you were using a GS,you would have the option of using Spectrum or AnsiTerm.Sorry.(sfahey, a2c.network_telecomm, Jul 08 2007)>>>>>""""">> Proterm is still commercial software the last I heard and moreinformation can be found on Intrec's Web site... <<It's $19.95 iirc, which isn't bad price wise.  Still, despite it's superiorterm emulations, it doesn't do ANSI like PC people like to see it. ANSI wasnever an "Apple II thing", and back in the day, kind of sneered at.I still get some attitude from a few people about the A2C BBS using ANSI.<shrugs>(sfahey, a2c.network_telecomm, Jul 08 2007)>>>>>"""""Well thanks for your replies.

On the update disks are also some programs providedby David as well as technical documentation for the shell.The 2.x version includes David's version of Blankenship BASIC. There isalso a stand-alone version but I have not located this. David mentioned italong with other software which he would release. Interestingly, he wrote aprogram named AmperDOS which is the same name as the software I released in1999. My AmperDOS is available on various file sites. Unfortunately,David's isn't. Should someone have a copy of these or other software byDavid Sugar please contact me.I am still looking for a copy of the manual. At this point I have thepossibility of one if the owner is able to have it scanned. We shall see.I would like to thank David Sugar for re-releasing this software.

This is a BASIC.SYSTEM replacement environmentwhich saves memory for program use. This software eventually grew into theSystem II environment which is also freeware. Contact was also made withJerry Kindall the program's author. Jerry claims no copyright ownership toMicrodot as he was simply under contract to Kitchen Sink.Command.com by David Sugar. This is a ProDOS 8 shell and environment with alarge number of commands and batch files available. There is also a goodlyamount of technical info and other associated softwares on the extra betadisks. Sadly, the source code and original documentation was lost in aflood (along with many other items) or this package would have includedthis too.

Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 18, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 21 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple 1 (orclone) or Apple II model present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system add ons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.  However, entries may be described or discussed, includingscreen shots (where applicable), by the KFest committee for promotionalpurposes, or by legitimate Apple II community press.The following lists are not necessarily complete lists of everythingallowed; these are to be taken as "givens."  If it's not on the list,please ask for confirmation.Acceptable software:     System software     Development environment (no customizations)     GSBug     Nifty List     Marinetti     Exerciser     ORCA/Debugger, Splat!     DesignMaster, Foundation, Genesys, ResLin     Talking Tools     Spectrum, ProTERM, ANSITermAcceptable hardware:     Apple II computer, monitor, disk drives, hard drives     Apple 1 computer or clone     CD-ROM drive, tape drive     Hard disk controller card     Sound card (speakers/headphones/etc)     Accelerator card (any speed)     RAM cardAccepted reference material:     All official Apple reference materials (including manuals, technical     notes, and file type notes).     Reference manuals included with development tools and software.     Commercially-available reference manuals.Any other hardware, software, or reference material needs the approval ofthe judges in advance.
