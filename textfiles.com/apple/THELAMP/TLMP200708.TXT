These people traveled from one part of the country to another bycatching rides in open railroad box cars... not very elegant... but veryinexpensive.     They would drop by the farm individually and ask for a meal,permission to stay overnight in the hay mow, old clothes, old shoes and soon.  They would offer to do some work to pay for their request.  There werealways various tasks waiting to be done on the farm so we could set them upsplitting wood, pulling weeds, removing manure from the hog house, etc.     They had a series of symbols they would carve on a tree or fence postindicating a farm that had good meals, a dog to watch out for, reasonableor unreasonable requests for work, etc.     Every so often one would balk at the suggested work and head down theroad.  A quick call to the next farm indicated a Hobo was on the way, whathe asked for, and the work he refused... if he was hungry enough by thetime he reached the next farm he might accept the same terms he had justrefused.     These people would be out of touch with family for months at a time.Quite a contrast to those who have to be in constant contact with othersvia cell phones or instant messaging.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAA]-------------------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 Bulletin Board at A2Central.com  |------------------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson  email: lutefisk at grex.cyberspace dot org[IRC]//c IDE/ram card?"""""""""""""""""Hello all,I read over on the other side of a2central that someone was working on aram and IDE card for the //c and //c+.

Themusic is sequenced from sets of 16 samples which are mixed two at a time"on the fly". At some point in the project I got a bit loopy and decidednot to compose music in any traditional manner, but rather to use arbitrarysections of data as the score. This came about after I was viewing audiosample data in the monitor and noticed the byte sequences of the waveformscontained regular patterns with small variations which I thought wouldtranslate well into music.

The label fell off long ago). It seems to be a ][+clone. I say this because it has upper and lowercase characters in ROM.  Ithad a Videx 80 column clone, a Microsoft Z80 softcard, an Epson APLparallel card, a RAM expansion by Australian Video Productions, and a greatfloppy controller card that supported and auto detected both numbers ofdisk sectors.  Unfortunately a dodgy power supply ravaged it.  When somecards arrive in the mail I'm going to restart its repair/restoration. Ilove its gargantuan case!  It's just begging for extra hardware.(Tristan, a2c.apple_clones, Jul 23 2007)[EOA][SPC]-------------------------------                           SPECIAL |------------------------------------[RFE]Why a IIgs Really Flies with an Ethernet Card"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I have heard of all kinds of ways people have managed to get their IIgsconnected to the outside world, but if you have an Ethernet LAN, then a NATrouter will allow you to share as many computers as you like on that LAN,and a IIgs really flies with an Ethernet card such as the Uthernet card. Ifanyone wants them, I can explain the technical reasons why this is so.(Ewen Wannop, KFest-Talk mailing list)>>>>>"""""(Yes, please do.)>>>>>"""""OK, here goes...With the traditional interfaces to the IIgs, based on the serial port, youare at the mercy of the Interrupt system when capturing incoming data. Itis up to the efficiency of the software routines of an application tohandle and store that data, so there is no corruption of the data flow. Ifthe incoming data cannot be handled as it arrives, it will be lost forever.Depending on the speed of your IIgs, which in turn depends on the speed ofany accelerator you may have installed, you may well get data loss orcorruption at speeds in excess of 9600 baud. Each persons experience willbe slightly different.I can only speak for the Uthernet card and the Marinetti interface, but theway this works is quite different, as the card has its own onboard databuffer, and does not use the interrupt system of the IIgs at all. Marinettiis polled frequently by the calling application, and will retrieve anywaiting data from the card storing it in its own buffer. The applicationthen calls Marinetti for data whenever it is expecting it, and as Marinettihandles the integrity of packets of data, only clean data will be returnedto the calling application, with bad packets being re-requestedautomatically. This saves on application code, as the application does nothave to check the data integrity itself.The process of retrieving incoming data with an Ethernet card is more orless a lossless system, and on my own 12.49Mhz IIgs, when transferringfiles with FTP from a computer on the LAN, I am receiving data at the fullspeed of the 10-Base Ethernet connection.As others will attest, an Uthernet card and Marinetti, transforms a IIgsinto a very fast machine indeed. For instance, I can't remember the exacttime it took, but using SNAP, I was able to retrieve, process and store,the list of 106,000 news groups from Giganews in under 7 minutes. Theresulting text file is 2.3Mb in size. File transfers with FTP go evenfaster.Cheers - Ewen(Ewen Wannop, KFest-Talk mailing list, Jul 17 2007)[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------The Apple II and Time"""""""""""""""""""""I liked your mini-editorial piece in a recent "The Lamp!" issue about usingthe II in a time-related way.

But every year I read all the plans and wish I could wina lottery so I could attend, and then I read people's reports and look atthe online snapshots, and I remember back to the fun and camaraderie andlack of sleep, and in some small way I feel like I share the experienceagain.Today that vicarious KFest experience came a little closer and a littleless "imaginary" when a postcard from Kansas City arrived in the mail. Myfirst thought was that it was from Ken Gagne (who I keep in contact with)as it is the sort of thing I could picture him doing. Then I read thegreetings from many of the other attendees at KFest as well, and I canhonestly say I was touched. Heck, "blown away" might be a betterdescription!I'd just like to say "Thank you!" to the people who took the time to signthe card. It would have taken seconds of your time, but it's created amemory for me that will last much, much longer!The Apple II was and is a special computer partly because of the peoplethat were attracted to it, and who stayed. I've seen another example ofthose people today.Apple II Forever!Peter Watson-- Write to MS-DOS disks on the Apple IIgs?-- Impossible!  ;-)(peterw, a2c.general_chat, Jul 25 2007)[EOA][K71]KFest 07 Day 1 by Kirk Mitchell"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hey, all...Your intrepid reporter here with yet another running commentary on thecurrent KFest.I'll try not to talk about food so much this year.  B-{)I left the small town of Moscow, KS to drive to KFest and 7 hours later,pulled into the parking lot of XL, the dorm we're at.  I really need totake more pit stops on trips like this.  I'm old enough that my joint'slock up.  Duh!Registration was fast, and I had lots of help from folks already here tohelp me unload my treasures.  Ryan Suenaga needed my GS for his session, soit got out of the house for the first time in a few years.Got here around 2:00 pm, and by 3:00 pm, a bunch of us decided to go outfor lunch.  Geoff Weiss suggested Sonic.  I'm never going to listen toGeoff's suggestions again.  Waiting for food in a hot car is just no fun.That and they shorted us an order of fries. The B@stards..Shortly afterwards, more folks started arriving, and we met folks wehaven't seen in 5-12 years, like Max Jones, Cindy Adam, and Tim Kellers...Also, KFest newbies, Jamie, Anthony, and Henry.  All much younger lookingthan I'd anticipated.  Sweet!  The Apple II kept alive by the youngergeneration.  B-{)Dinner time finally came around, and we raced to Sweet Tomatoes, a soup andsalad joint that's become a tradition. I won.  I don't think the otherswere aware that we were racing, or that'd the excuse they're using.   I ateplenty of rabbit food, but made sure to finish off with lots of soft serveice cream on hot fudge brownies.  My Dr. would be so proud.  B-{)Oh.  Food.  Sorry.  Sheesh, I'm obsessed!After Dinner, Ryan and I drove to Costco to buy supplies for the KookOuttomorrow.  It's a lot for 40+ folks.  Since I have to bake outside grillingthis stuff, I made sure to get a case of my favorite barley beverage.  B-{)You can't buy small quantities of anything at Costco though, so we had tosearch for a Price Choppers to get the rest of the stuff we needed.Sheesh...  I live in the boonies.  I have to drive 35 miles to get to aWalMart...  One way.  Seems like you have to do the same in a big city, butyou have to do it at 35 mph, and mess with stoplights.  We got everything,and.... had absolutely no help hauling it to our room.  I'm a bit miffed atthat.Now we have folks settling into their rooms, playing a Wii on the bigscreen TV in the lobby, coding, visiting, and generally introducingthemselves to each other.  Matt Jenkins was in here earlier, and we had anice relaxed conversation about Australia, and IT, and a range of otherstuff.  Meeting new cool people is what this is all about.  B-{)I brought an external USB Hard drive with all 11 seasons of MST3K to sharewith Ken and any other Misties here.  Since it takes 3 hours to copy over,it could keep him busy.  B-{)Oh, it took a while before Rockhurst IT got their act together, andactivated the account we were to use.  They gave us the username andpassword, but the service wasn't activated.  We've working on gettingcertain ports opened now.I'm going to do a walkabout to see if anything else is happening...Talked to Andrew Roughan a bit...  The lobby full of folks playing WiiBowling...  Or just sitting there with laptops on laps engrossed in geekystuff.  This is truly a summer camp for geeks.  B-{)I got a few folks to sample my homemade wine, but they must be frightenedof Jesuits, since this is supposed to be a dry school.  I haven't seensecurity yet, and I'm discrete.  B-{)I'm sure more will happen, but I'm off to visit some more.  I hope otherparticipants feel free to add to the thread with their takes on whathappens here.   We have a lot of new folks, and their viewpoints can alwaysopen fossilized eyes.

Same fare as last year.Nothing much happened until I started the charcoal at 11:15 AM to start theKFest Kookout.  The Rockhurst staff had even brought the grill over to thedorm, and set up tables and chairs, but most folks decided to eat with airconditioning.Everything went well, and I only suffered a few 1st degree burns, and theloss of some hair on my fingers.  B-{)  No one has reported to the nursefor food poisoning either, so it was a success!Dave Szetela gave a great Keynote address where he regaled us with hisApple II experiences, including stories from inside Apple Inc.  Also hisexperienced while with Nibble and many other stories that are familiar toanyone else who's ever fallen in love with the Apple II.  Good times!Ed Eastman gave a session on Soldering 101, but I was already nursing minorburns and didn't want to press my luck.  B-{)Instead, Ryan Suenaga, my roomie, needed a ride to Radio Shack, so off wewent.  The first one we went to didn't have his item in stock, so theycalled another store that did have it, so off we went to explore NorthKansas City.I hadn't been to that area, so it was an adventure.  The prostitutesweren't that bad looking, and the gang colors appeared to be mostly yellow,but we were on a mission and didn't stop until we'd got his frigging mixer.Only took us an hour and a half.  B-{PWe got back with 15 mins to spare for dinner.  Food was good, but I'llspare you the menu.After dinner, Ken Gagne showed some of the "BBS: The Documentary".  I'dalready seen this so I didn't go to it, but I do recommend this to anyonewho remembers the squawk of a modem, and the thrill of accessing your firstBBS.Instead, I hung out in a2central's chat room, where you'll find manycurrent KFesters saying absolutely nothing because they're busy runningaround.  Still, you can also find them chatting away during sessions, sincenearly everyone is taking advantage of the college wifi, and chatting withsomeone across the room from them, or even across the table.  B-{)If you're using Firefox or a Mozilla browser, get Chatzilla.  Then byclicking on:irc://a2central.com/a2c.chatyou can join us vicariously while things are happening.  You'll probablyend up bored though, because we're running around though.  B-{)The last activity of the evening was the pizza party put on by thepublishers of Juiced.GS.  Thanks, Sheppy!Wandering around the rooms lets you discover really neat things, too.Across the hall in James Littlejohn and Matt Jenkin's room, Jamie Steffinswas demonstrating a VGA converter that does a great job of upscaling a GS'svideo signal to VGA!  Sorta steep at $300 though.The Wii continues to impress the geeks here, tying up the bigscreen TV mostof the time, so there's been no movies shown, or karaoke sung...  B-{(Oh... Carrington Vanston finally puttered into town on his Vespa, but a bitlate for Kookout.  Fun guy!Well, that's it for the official day.  I'll wait before posting this, atleast until it's a bit later.  Google Groups appears to be having problems.I posted yesterdays report from there, and it never showed on Google, butdid on other news servers.  I'll paste this on to yesterdays news to see ifboth show up on Google.Still going strong, but I'm posting it anyway....Kirk(Kirk Mitchell, comp.sys.apple2, July 18 2007)[EOA][K7B]KFest 07 Day 2 by Bruce Baker"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Kfest is official this afternoon with the Keynote Address given by DavidSzetela of Nibble Magazine fame.We have quite a few people who have not been here in a while.  It is greatto see them back.Perhaps the most startling thing so far, and it is not much, is thatsomeone (please identify yourself) is driving a full size school busrepainted in an old dark green color.  Some have called it olive drab.  Insome places the paint has come off giving it a camouflage feel.The bus made it easy to move people to Sweet Tomatoes last night for theunofficial kick off of Kfest 2007.Lots of other have different impressions I'm sure.A few extras took the time to drive this year brings more gear.  Tony Diazdrove from somewhere in sunny California. Eric and Sarah Shepherd came fromthe other direction (Kentucky?).  We have drivers from Ohio, Chicago area,and my wife and I from Houston.  This is why Kansas was picked in the firstplace, it is so centrally located.The game boxes have been used quite a bit on the big screen TV in thecentral room.  I'm seen an xbox and a wii.

Still got up at 7:30 am though.Breakfast menu hasn't changed, but I doubled up on coffee.First session was Andrew Roughan's on the Marinetti Open Source Project.Andrew picked up the pieces when Richard abandoned efforts on bug huntingand documentation corrections.  He deserved, and got a big hand.  Whichinterrupted my fervent meditation of the insides of my eyelids.  Damn neargot whiplash!  B-{)Austin Phelps (famous for being the only person struck by a flung floppydisk during KFest 2005's Diskcathalon competition) gave a session onMedical Images and OsiriX.  I wish I could tell you what it was about.  Iwent back to my room to rest my eyes.Tony Diaz presented a CBC documentary on Spam.  I missed that too.  I'mpretty much an expert on Spam, after recieving hundreds of gigabytes of theinedible stuff.Lunch was good.  I didn't miss that, and it shows.  B--{)Eric Shepherd did several nifty sessions on ORCA.  Big hint, use ORCA on afast emulator to speed development.  Word is that the folks in the back ofthe room were so overwhelmed that they passed out.  B-{)Ryan Suenaga gathered guests Carrington Vanston and Andrew Malloy for alive session of A2 Unplugged - LIVE.  It was quite humorous as these guyscrossed wits and set off sparks.  You'll have an opportunity to hear megiving a big "WhooHoo!" during the audience introduction.  B-{)Michael Mahon gave a technical and interesting session on "Real Sound for 8bit Apple II's".  Much of it went over my head, but I stayed awake...focused the entire time!  It was great seeing what he could make an old //edo soundwise! ...err.... hearing.Dinner was fine.Our last session of the day was from Rob Walsh, KC native and podcaster forPodCast411 and Today in iPhone.  He focused on the strengths and weaknessof this interesting device, and pointed us to places where we could go tohack the things.  B-{)Shortly after that, we made a run to the Apple Store where I enriched thestockholders of Apple Inc.  Most of the other folks were just Looky Loo's.Finally, Ryan and I went in search of the great steaming Krispy Kreme donutin an attempt to bring home dozens of the rascals to KFest participants.Alas, Ryan had spent valuable time yapping with others and by the time wegot there, only the maddening odor of the damn things lingered in theparking lot of the closed store.  Yet another hour and a half wasteddriving the streets of KC.  I'm a country boy, and driving in a "big city"is beginning to wear on me.  Still, I do what I can to contribute.  So Ishould shut up and think happy thoughts.  B-{) ....  still, we came backwithout donuts.   sniff..Wii is still big..  The crowds waiting their turns are engrossed.And laughter is wafting down the hall, calling to me.  Gotta check thisout.  B-{)Wish you were here!(Kirk Mitchell, comp.sys.apple2, July 20 2007)[EOA][K74]KFest 07 Day 4 by Kirk Mitchell"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Day 4,Well, I got involved on the Wii last night and didn't tear myself awayuntil 5 AM.  My roomie failed to wake me until it was 9 AM and too late forbreakfast.  The rat.  B-{)First session was Michael Mahon's NadaNet session, where he gave a detailedtechnical presentation on networking and how he built his NadaNet fromscratch.  It was very interesting, and the demonstration was intriguing.And I didn't fall asleep!  His AppleCrate is something to see as well!Bruce Baker gave the next session where he chose a number of games from theSoftdisk 8 bit collection (a real gold mine of neat programs...  Hundredsof them!).  I bought the collection last KFest but haven't really sortedthrough the 166 disk issues to find the real gems myself.  Bruce found someneat ones.Tony Diaz was supposed to give a session, but I don't know what happened toit.Lunch was especially fine since I'd missed breakfast.  B-{)Ed Eastman had another soldering session which I missed.Geoff Weiss's session was System 6.0.1 for Dummies, and he went through theSystem Folder describing what almost each file did.Tim Kellers gave a session on an Introduction to FreeBSD, which forms thebase of Mac OS X.  Interesting, but the Center was having network problems.We had the fancy dinner next, then proceeded to reroast past roastees andwatch slide shows.  Lots of humor.  B-{)  Contest winners collected theirbooty and a good time was had by all.A small group took of this evening to a Celtic Folk music concert, anothergroup headed out for the movies, Ryan and I finally got the Krispy Kremesback to the dorm and almost lost limbs as we were rushed by human donutpiranhas...  B-{)So, it's been a slow night.  There have been quite a few new faces ona2central's chat.  I hope they haven't been terribly disappointed by theconversations.  When everyone gets back from movies and concert, we'llprobably get back to ignoring the chat.  B-{)The night's still young, although I don't think I'll be staying up so latethis time.I'll be finishing up my report tomorrow when KFest 2007 comes to a happyconclusion.Kirk(Kirk Mitchell, comp.sys.apple2, July 21 2007)[EOA][K75]KFest 07 Day 5 by Kirk Mitchell"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Day 5,I got to bed at a decent hour last night.  Of course, the half dozen folkswho went to Denny's didn't bet back until around 4 AM.  I'd already beenasleep for an hour.  B-{)Got up at 7:30 am, and made it to breakfast and coffee.  Lots of coffee.  Ihelped Ryan haul my GS to the Student Center where he prepared for hissession "Suck Free Zone".  If a GS programmer doesn't have a program forKFest, tradition is that he/she sucks.  Ryan didn't suck.  His programallowed you to send SMS text messages to cell phones.  Interesting!Andrew Roughan did a quick demo of his HackFest program.  He'd finally gotit working last night.  Ryan and I thought he was moving in with us becausehe wouldn't leave off debugging his work on my GS.  B-{)  It's calledShareClip and allows you to share or receive the contents of the GS'sclipboard with Macs, Windows, or other GS's which are also running aprogram called ShareClip.  That would be useful during my chat sessions ona2central.com, since it's difficult to get folks posting long URL's to takethem to tinyurl.com first, since I chat on my GS, but surf on a G5 and hateto have to retype those URL's on the G5 to see the sites.Carrington Vanston gave an interesting session on recording audio forpodcasting or other purposes.  Ryan should take a hint, but he says hisstandards aren't that high.  B-{)Next came lunch, followed shortly by another A2unplugged LIVE session.  Youshould find that distributed pretty shortly.  I whoohooed again, but I'mgetting weaker as KFest finishes up...  B-{(HackFest awards were given, and Michael Mahon walked away with an Apple//c+ in an Apple carrying case for his program demonstrating a bouncingball travelling between two computers running NadaNet.  Nifty!We moved back to the dorm to have the swap meet/vendor fair, and I droppeda few more bills on Apple II stuff.Then it was off to KC Masterpiece for some excellent BBQ.  I'm glad Idecided to get the half slab of ribs rather than the full one.  I'm stillstuffed!Back at the dorm, we held the finals of the GShisen contest, where GeoffWeiss claimed the prize.  $50 off of anything in Syndicomm's library ofgoods.The Wii got packed away, so now folks are playing other board games andcards...  How refreshing!As for me, I'll be up a little longer, but since I have a long drivetomorrow, I won't be staying up too late.  It'll be breakfast tomorrow,then packing to leave yet another great KFest!  It was great meeting oldfriends and new faces of folks who share an interest in the Apple II!Hope to see you here in 2008!Kirk(Kirk Mitchell, comp.sys.apple2, July 21 2007)[EOA][K76]KFest 07 Day 6 by Kirk Mitchell"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Day 6,Usually I stop reporting on Saturday.  But even Sunday was exceptional.I went to bed at 1 am, to be fresh for the drive home.  Up at 7:30 toshower and shave (the wife doesn't like me scruffy....  She may not like meunscruffy too, but she hides that well.  B-{)  )I stoked up on coffee none the less, and loaded the van all jittery andsweaty.  phew..Michael Mahon asked for a ride to Wichita earlier on the kfest mailinglist, but I wasn't planning to go that route.  Until my wife called andsaid I may have to pick up my bother-in-law there on the way back.  Iremembered Michael, and brought him on board.  Of course, my BIL wouldchange plans afterwards, but he did me a favor.  B-{)That three hour drive was one of the quickest I've ever experienced, wechatted so much, and I was totally engrossed the entire time... (when Iwasn't checking the map to make sure I wasn't effing up...).  At KFest,you'll meet folks way smarter than you, but they'll be kind and good folks.Generous with their knowledge, and the stuff they bring to the vendor fairbut don't want to take back too.  You may pay a bunch to get here, but thegiveaway treasures earned through contests or chance are worth taking home.Unless you wouldn't like an Apple //c+...  I scored one last year.  Michaelgot one this year.  Lots of //e's changed hands.. Monitors.  Software...I'm not religious, but I can see why some folks value a Hajj.  Get at leastone KFest under your belt, and you'll be a better person, and you'll makesome damned fine friends, and your acne will finally clear.  B-{)Kirk(Kirk Mitchell, comp.sys.apple2, July 23, 2007)[EOA][GSH]GShisen Final Rounds""""""""""""""""""""Geoff Weiss set the world on fire in the championship round of the GShisenContest with a blistering time of 2:53 to claim the 2007 title. He neededthat kind of performance to defeat Margaret Anderson, who also turned in animpressive time of 3:26. (The GShisen game number played in thechampionship round was 9197.)Geoff's victory earned him a $50 product discount on any title in theSyndicomm software arsenal. The second-place prize for Margaret was a 2008subscription to Juiced.GS.Earlier in the day, Margaret had won the second round of the contest,followed by Geoff. Placing third in the second round was Sarah Shepherd,followed by Bruce Baker and Carl Knoblock (a former champion).Congrats to the winners and all the participants in this year's contest.-- Max(Max Jones, KFest Mailing List, July 21, 2007)[EOA][RTG]Return of the Geoff-i"""""""""""""""""""""I got home safely after KansasFest.  Dain was really worried that he wasgoing to make a wrong turn and end up in Kansas before getting me to theairport.  I told him that the only way I was to end up in Kansas is if theplane I was one would fly over that state.  And sure enough, the plane tookoff over Kansas before turning southeast.Geoff(geoff, a2c.general_chat, Jul 22 2007)[EOA][KF8]------------------------------                       KFest 2008 |-----------------------------------[KFE]KansasFest 2008"""""""""""""""KansasFest 2008 is scheduled for July 22 through 27, 2008.This will be the 20th anniversary KFest.Go to <http://www.kfest.org> regularly to watch for details as theydevelop.[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
