Hormel, producer of Spam, has its corporateheadquarters in Austin.  And... Austin is also where The Spam Museum islocated.The Spam Museum is located at 1937 Spam Boulevard.  (Spam was firstproduced in 1937.)  Web site: www.spam.com...  Phone: 800-LUV-SPAM...The name Spam stands for Spiced Ham.Spam played a big roll in feeding the troops in WWII.The Wall of Spam contains 3500 cans... enough to feed you almost 10 yearsat one can per day.Push a button at the Monty Python exhibit for some fun.Listen to some dandy jingles from old radio ads.Take the Spam Quiz to see how much you know about the product.Take a look at the giant 3D map to see the many countries where Spam isdistributed.We will save the rest of the exhibits for you to see when you have anopportunity to visit for yourself.  It is a fun place.Not everyone will be able to visit this museum... if you find yourselftraveling in southern Minnesota, be sure to stop for a visit... I highlyrecommend it.                              KansasFest 2005                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Not everyone will be able to go to KFest this year... be sure to go if youcan...

These are reasons for my long silenceon a2central.com.  Everybody wants something, but as I get older I amrealizing the need to take the bull by the horns and take charge of my ownlife.  It's time to make something happen.I am posting this set of proposed specs here because the Apple II hasinspired the machine in question.  This provides an opportunity for us allto describe what we would like to see in a new home computer suitable forcasual use and for children.  Jeri Ellsworth has provided enormouscontemporary inspiration as well, with her C-One project and its follow-up,the Commodore Direct-To-TV.  This is not a new Apple II (i.e. no AppleROMs).  This is not a competitor to the PC or Mac.  What it is is a newhome computer.You can offer your suggestions.  What do you or don't you like aboutpresent day solutions?  You can also laugh at me - I don't mind.  Thisdream has been with me for 13 years, and it's time to move it forward.Somehow, someday, it will become a reality, and nothing will stop me frompressing forward (the real specs do differ somewhat from what is shownhere).The vision is largely laid out in the appleii_future.rtf document.-----------------------------------------------Proposed Specifications for Cerberus21 June 2005Cerberus, in Greek mythology, is a three-headed dog that guards the gatesof Hades. The computer system, whose working name shall be Cerberus, isbuilt around the philosophy of the open, distributed system: many low-cost,low power, small-footprint computing units (CUbs) can achieve respectableperformance and at the same time give developers complete control of eachunit.  This includes its RAM and DMA. All access to user input, disk,video, audio, FireWire, USB, and LAN I/O is managed by a central trafficcop controller, responsible for dividing up system resources and allocatedand de-allocating them for the appropriate CU.Cerberus fills a longstanding void in the home market and will return tothe user the experience of simple, elegant, brass tacks operation thatgives him or her the proper sense of complete control over the system,whether as a casual user or programmer.Target Market~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Web-connected home users dissatisfied with current solutions.- Children, for home, educational, and entertainment use.- Low-power applications.- Hobbyists.Primary Objectives of Cerberus~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Open architecture b complete access to the hardware from within each CUfacilitates and encourages learning by immersive experience.- Programmability. A built-in high-level programming language along withthe ability to look at and program the machine directly at the machine-codelevel.- Ability to run popular web-enabled applications, including browsers ande-mail clients.- Respectable performance, capable of playing MPEG-4 video and performing3-D operations in games.- Very short load times.- Low power consumption.- Loose coupling between CUbs.- Enough processing power in each CU to run a simple multitasking OS, sucha simple Linux variant.- Compatibility with another platform, which will supply an existingsoftware base.- Ability to use low-cost, existing PC peripheral devices, such as harddrives, CD-ROMbs, input devices, and SVGA displays.Secondary Objective of Cerberus~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- A simple yet effective mechanism for licensing software at the hardwarelevel. This may or may not involve Internet connectivity.What Cerberus is not~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- A direct competitor to the PC or Macintosh". Cerberus is not intended tocompete head-to-head with machines designed around conventionalmethodologies (single, fast, power-inefficient CPU running on a monolithicoperation), or to run software designed for such systems.- A secure business solution. Security in the context of Cerberus isconfined to the web-enabled software which requires it. Security, in fact,conflicts with the open system objective.Proposed Specifications~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~_Computing Units_- Western Design Center 65C816 clocked at 14-20Mhz (TBD).- Well-established, widely documented and proven architecture.- Thousands of existing programs available.- Easy to program.- Powerful addressing modes, suitable for modern software.- Low power... no fan required.- Low cost.- SIMM slot capable of holding up to 1GB of RAM.- Macro-bank selector b memory is divided into 16MB chunks, with smallareas reserved for hardware soft switches.- Fast twos complement 32x32 multiply/divide unit w/MAC, FPGAimplementation. This facilitates the horsepower demands of modernapplications.- Ability to optionally shadow up to 4MB video RAM in main memory.- Ability to shadow shared RAM.- Legacy mode maps well-known existing memory configuration to Bank 0000,with clean-room engineered emulation ROMs.- Optional Floating Point Unit (FPU)._Motherboard_- Four (4) CUbs stock, expandable to eight.- On-board video enforces a single standard within Cerberus.- 128MB video DRAM.- High-performance, high-quality SVGA.- Decoupling from CUbs by central traffic management logic device enableseach CU to write directly to its own optionally shadowed Video RAM withoutworrying about timing issues.- Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) (Vendor yet to be determined).- Capable of direct-port writes, or overlay.- High-speed 32-bit DMA@70-100Mhz- DMA will have multiple counters, to enable iterative swaths of copying,such as a rectangular area of the screen, or irregular shapes, in a singleoperation.- Indirect mode, for copying from the address-of or address-to.- Both target and source may be selected- Another CUbs RAM- Video RAM- Audio RAM- Disk Cache.- Pipeline-able b queuing for multiple requests from multiple CUbs.- 1 MB shared RAM.- On-board digital oscillator chip (DOC), 64-128 polyphonic voicesallocate-able by CU.- 16MB audio DRAM.- 65C816 to manage sound RAM, play music, and manage DOC.- On-board LAN connector.- PCI expansion slots.(GPH_II, Cat 17, Top 34, Msg 9)>>>>>"""""Greg,I haven't read the RTF yet (I have a few days off trying to recover from a10 day work stretch, so I'll try to read it), but good luck.

And even if you get valid MAC address into which youassign to your network interface, it will only be valid for a short periodtimes (usually counted in hours), that it will be an ongoing challenge tokeep getting a new address and reassign your hardware.  IMO, it isn't worththe constant hassle.  Solution: put the computer away for a week andsight-see KC.  I hear there's a great amusement park in the area :) (thereare ferris wheels for those who don't 300 feet plunges in an open-carroller coaster :)I have to thank you (for the repost) and Sean for making what informationis known about Rockhurst available.  Also kudos to Carl for taking care ofa2taxi once again!Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg 59)>>>>>"""""I probably should have consulted Google before posting (praise the almightyand blessed Google).  The answer is found athttp://www.rockhurst.edu/services/computer/wireless/guest.asp .Guests can use the wireless network using the "pay as you go" method; $30for the week if the prices have not changed.  It uses a system like Verneirto track authentication (as suspected).Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg 60)[EOA][EII]WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN ARRIVING AT Rockhurst - II""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""More info from the kfest list, this time from Tony:--- Original Message ---Sean did some recon and if this were AOL you'd hear "You've gotPictures!"... Take a look at the gallery on kfest.org for some insight onRockhurst.Our accommodations have been changed on campus to Corcoran Residence Hallinstead of McGee due to threats from the air conditioning system in McGeehall. They did not wish to have it go ka-put on us during our stay, andcalled to inform us ahead of time. It already happened once this Summer.Sean has some details on parking and loading / unloading into the dorms.We will be on the first floor of Corcoran Hall, the common area is centralto the building entrance and there are east and west halls. The building isgrain elevator layout. I'll be working out some more details this weekend,we will either have everyone on one side with the quiet seekers toward thevery end or use both sides of the hall depending on numbers.The cafeteria is on the other side of the fieldhouse, toward the west, fromCorcoran and for vehicle parking we have a choice of 52nd street, streetside parking or controlled access and park in the townhome residencesparking lots to the east of Corcoran.Rockhurst Road is 52nd Street with a name change while passing the campus.Tuesday night will most likely be an evening out to Sweet Tomatoes, we'reworking on that this week.Our schedule will be starting with breakfast on Wed. at Rockhurst, and wewill have the KFest Kookout for Lunch and then Dinner again at Rockhurst.Welcome to KFest! Let's have a great time!Thank you all for your support.Tony(KGAGNE, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg 61)>>>>>"""""Move-in and parking info, courtesy Sean:--- Original Message ---We'll refer to the map at:http://www.rockhurst.edu/admission/topnav/VR/map.aspAs Tony mentioned, we are relocated to the Corcoran Residence Hall. It's along building running east to west parallel with Rockhurst Road/52ndStreet.  The first thing everyone should know is that Rockhurst Road/52ndis a ONE WAY street going west. Anyone who wants to park on the streetimmediately in front of the dorm will find this very convenient, and youcan park on both sides of the street. Lots of shade out front. We may alsohave some parking in the gated area between the Corcoran and TownhouseVillage area, but that hasn't been guaranteed yet (btw, no shade). If weget parking in the gated area, right off, I can tell you - you don't wantto unload from that location. Lots of steps.We're staying on the first floor of Corcoran, which is good because thisbuilding doesn't have an elevator. Loading/unloading won't be a big problemthough. You can't see it on the map, but there is a service drive betweenthe Corcoran dorm and the Mason-Halpin Fieldhouse. It's roughly rightacross from Virginia Street, if you check the map. One or two vehicles canfit in their at a time, and from there it's a short walk all the way onflat sidewalk to the rear entry of the dorm, which also happens to be onthe level we're staying on. If you don't have a lot to carry, there arealso steps at the ,front of the building facing the street, but the servicedrive is very convenient. The gate is supposed to be open the entire timewe're at Rockhurst. You should be able to unload, back out and takeVirginia around the block to get back to the front of the dorm and park onthe street.This is the pic of the sidewalk that runs behind the Corcoran dorm. In thedistance, you can see the red truck. That is the service drive fromRockhurst/52nd. The "bridge" on the right is the rear entry into the dormso as you can see, it's a short trip.http://www.kfest.org/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=Rockhusrt-University&id=View_of_dorm_back_door_areaThis pic is taken from the "bridge", but you can see the red pickup still -just to give you an idea of how far the service drive is from the backdoor.http://www.kfest.org/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=Rockhusrt-University&id=View_from_back_of_dorms_a_1The walk from the Corcoran dorm to the Rockhurst cafeteria is at least2x-2.5x the distance as it was from Ridgeway to Avila's cafeteria. A nicewalk to build the appetite or walk off the indigestion - we'll have to see.http://www.kfest.org/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=Rockhusrt-University&id=Zoom_past_field_house_to_2nAnother pic from the "bridge", this is the path you take to head off towardthe cafeteria. Note the picnic tables and likely location of the Kookout.If you're driving and have the space, you might consider bringing your ownfolding chairs so we have plenty of seating.http://www.kfest.org/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=Rockhusrt-University&id=Dorm_back_door_smoking_areaI didn't get to take pics of the front (52nd st side) of the dorm becausethey were testing fire alarms and we couldn't use the front doors.If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask.(KGAGNE, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg 62)[EOA][RST]Celebrity Roast"""""""""""""""I am pleased to announce this year's roast panel will consist, in noparticular order, of the following roasters:Geoff WeissJeri EllsworthEric ShepherdRyan SuenagaThough 75% of these individuals have themselves been roasted in the past,only 25% of them were roasted by me, which means not only that I have notincurred their wrath to warrant a particularly painful roast, but that Iwon't have to recycle much material when forming my rebuttal. :)Note: The M.C. has yet to be decided, but I thought I'd get thisinformation out for now.-Ken(Ken Gagne, KFest Mailing List, Jun 22, 2005)[EOA][KFS]KFest sessions - the list - update 2""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""A few new additions and corrections to report.
