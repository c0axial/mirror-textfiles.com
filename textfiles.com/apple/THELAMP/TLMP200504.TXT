Then, a separate ARP layer would be needed (possibly implementedby an INIT using IPC for communication with the network and device driverlayers).  A new Marinetti link layer would be needed to work with thisparadigm.Then an application such as arp could be written for the GS to doadd/modify/view/delete entries in the ARP table.  That would help withknowing what is happening with ARP.In terms of the SMSC 91c96 diagnostic, see the chipset manual to identifyall the different operation modes it supports and how to set/unset theoptions.  The hypothetical device driver mentioned above could be set up toprovide the ethernet chip configuration details, and even change them asneeded.I would think the GS/OS Device Driver manual would provide suggestions howto follow Apple's guidelines.By having all of this available, it should be easy to implement support foradditional Apple II ethernet cards (anybody remember the EthernetTwodesigned by Babar de Saint Cyr back in 1999?).Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 27, Top 2, Msg 77)>>>>>"""""Yes, and there are periodically other cards that people hack together.Wish I had the time to work on this, although since I can't really speak 16bit assembly, I'm not much of a driver author candidate.RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 27, Top 2, Msg 78)>>>>>"""""If one was to rely on wholly on IPC instead of the GS/OS driver interface,there would be no reason to write drivers only in Assembly.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 27, Top 2, Msg 79)>>>>>"""""IPC would slow things down, possibly noticeably.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 27, Top 2, Msg 80)>>>>>"""""Is there any other abstraction model which would be any more efficient?Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 27, Top 2, Msg 81)[EOA][EOC]Emulate an Apple IIgs and 149+ Other Computers""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Has anybody tried out the IIgs emulator engine in MESS?

Likewise, part ofyour check would be for the . and the 250, and branch accordingly.Pseudo-code might look like this:  (no cracks from the peanut gallery aboutpascal BEING pseudo-code. ;)String inLine = readln(from inputstream);  { grab a line }String startOfLine = Left(inLine, 4) ;     { take the first 4 chars }Integer defCode = VAL(startOfLine) ;   attempt to make a numberif NOT ERROR thenbegin(TCOMPTER, Cat 55, Top 5, Msg 7)>>>>>"""""continued from previous message...begin   Select Case StartOfLine       case "250 "            Set flag to jump out of line-reading loop       case ".

It seems to me that lots of the programs I'm working on orcontemplating working on will need lots of text parsing.  I've found thatactually getting data into or out of Marinetti is not all that tough (sinceI've done it a bunch of times now); it's more the text parsing that's anissue.RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 55, Top 5, Msg 15)[EOA][LJW]LATEST ON JIM WARD""""""""""""""""""Jim Ward, an Apple employee in the late Eighties and early Nineties who wasinvolved with the launch of the Power Macintosh and PowerBook lines, is now(as of May 4th, 2004) the president of LucasArts, and president ofmarketing and distribution for LucasFilm.

Having just gotten off the phone with thosefriendly bureaucrats from the US Patent and Trade Office, the patentexpired June 2002.  Patents issued back in 1985 had a strict 17-yearlifespan from the filing date.  Dramatic changes were made in subsequentyears in the duration of patents and the many exceptions/extensions offeredto patent holders--the pharmaceutical companies were rather successful inthis area.     Nonetheless, it might be good to inform your readers and others whomight have inadvertently paid Unisys royalties after June, 2002 to gettheir money back.  As a software developer, if you had packaged productsfrom the pre-06/2002 timeframe that have been sitting on shelves and wereactually purchased after this date, in theory, you could get that royaltymoney back, too.  It's time that we all fight back and no longer live underUnisys's shadow on this issue. FYI,Michael[EOA]The Editor Responds"""""""""""""""""""Actually, we quoted a discussion on the Unisys patent... we didn'tnecessarily agree that June 2003 was or was not the expiration date for thepatent.
