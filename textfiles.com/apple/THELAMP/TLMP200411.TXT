With aforecast for a high of 60 on this sunny day with a gentle breeze, it willbe a good day for a walk through a nearby neighborhood with lots of largetrees... it will be a Crunchy Leaves Day.                                 The Walk                                 ~~~~~~~~     Some places leaves are on the sidewalk... the crunch of leaves underfoot is very special.  And look... a mother and father and their threeyoung children have taken time out from raking leaves... they have createda huge pile of those dry, crispy leaves... and the children are takingturns Jumping Into The Pile Of Leaves... oh, the crunching sound as theyland... the smile on their face as the peek out from that pile of leaves.     Those who have never jumped into a pile of crunchy leaves will notunderstand what is so special about it.  But we all have times, places, andexperiences that are special to us... such as working with the Apple IIcomputers.     Further along in the walk we encounter a gentleman planting Springflowering bulbs.  It is always wonderful to see the blooming crocuses,tulips and daffodils early in the Spring after the bleak landscape ofWinter.  This is one of those cases where planning ahead and taking actionpays off in the future.                                KansasFest                                ~~~~~~~~~~     Planning ahead and taking action can pay off next Summer when it istime for KFest.  Mark you calendar, ask for time off from work, and save upsome money.     You might also want to begin planning a presentation for KFest 2005.Most likely you have something you especially like to do with the Applecomputers... tell us about it at KFest.     See the KFest section of this issue for more details.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[NUL]NEW UPLOADS TO THE A2 LIBRARY"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""There is a new upload in thesystem_software/misc_16-bit/desk_accessories/nda directory:File: MailChec1b1.BXYSize: 14720Date: Oct 7MailChecker.NDA is another New Desk Accessory from Ryan Suenaga.

Icurrently use softcomca.com (aka myhosting.com), which offers 100 MB ofstorage, 5 GB of bandwidth, and 20 email addresses for $10/month, which isa great deal - but their tech support is laughable.  Their "help" isusually undetailed and/or incorrect, and I'm tired of dealing with people(I wonder if this job has been outsourced?) who don't know their CAT5 fromtheir elbow.-Ken(KGAGNE, Cat 11, Top 29, Msg 92)>>>>>"""""I've been using LunarPages.com for a web site for our dog training club.For $7.95 per month, you get:PHP, JSP*, ASP*, & PERL1000 Megabytes Storage40 Gigabytes Data TransferPriority Toll-free Telephone SupportFTP AccessFantastico Script LibraryMicrosoft Front Page (not sure what use this is, but they have it)When I first signed up two years ago, it was 500 GB they provided for thisprice, and the size has just gone up since then, with additional featuresadded now and then, including the increased capacity. They have telephonetech support that usually helps quite a bit.The $7.95 per month, if paid as 1 year at a time, has no set up charge.

That means, for example,instead of telling people to go to gamebits.net and click on thePlayStation link, or giving them gamebits.net/psx as a URL, I can send themto psx.gamebits.net.

For example, you may want innovation.org.nz to point tobusiness.org.nz/innovation/. Addon domains must be registered domain namesthat you own and configured to point to your web site's servers."So, if you registered "www.gagne.com", you could configure it to point to"www.gamebits.com/gagne".Regarding parked domains:"You can set up a domain name that you own to point to another domain name.This is known as "parking" a domain."Example: You own the business.co.nz and innovation.co.nz domain names. Youalready have a web site for business.co.nz, but you do not want to create anew web site for innovation.co.nz at the moment. By parkinginnovation.co.nz on top of business.co.nz, all URLs for innovation.co.nzwill automatically go to business.co.nz instead."On the other hand, a Subdomain is just another way of accessing part ofyour web site. You could have "gagne.gamebits.com", which would be its ownfolder within the public_html folder for your site. This is just analternate way of subdividing the contents of your site, if you wish. Youcould just as easily do "www.gamebits.com/gagne" if you wanted. Note thatthis does not require registering another domain name with any DNS service(thus costs nothing extra).By the way, mailing lists ARE possible with LunarPages, with no extra cost.This is also accessible from the Control Panel. Steven Weyhrich <IX0YE>--<Apple II Historyhttp://apple2history.org(A2HISTORY, Cat 11, Top 29, Msg 1010[EOA][ITL]------------------------      ILLUMINATING THE LAMP |-----------------------------An overview of GEnieLamp A2 and The Lamp!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To be Continued"""""""""""""""Note from October 2004 issue:      I'll say goodbye for now, but I'm not fading away as I did in 1995.I'll return some time next year to do another couple of Illuminating TheLamp columns for 2003 and 2004.Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.org[EOA][HCG]------------------------          HCGS ANNOUNCEMENT |-----------------------------HyperCard GS Version of _The Lamp!_ Available"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""This issue of _The Lamp!_ is available in a version for HCGS.(HyperCard IIgs)Look for it in the HyperCard_IIgs directory.If you would like future issues of _The Lamp!_ available in the HCGSversion please email me at:Lyle Syverson <lyle@FoxValley.net>[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][NSA]November 2004 Issue of Syndicommotion Available"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The November 2004 (Volume 3, Number 11) issue of Syndicommotion has beenemailed to subscribers.
