I didn't even realize sending in theregistration meant you would get a certificate, a novelty really, but itkinda sucks that I never got them.In 1989 I started on a road that eventually lead to the contents ofapple2.org. It's hard to say what the first prototype machine I got was, Ithink it's a tie between Cortland and Sara.Of course I had pack ratted lots and lots of stuff from then, peoplethought I was nuts. ;-) Now look.. Sometimes I think it's nuts too.But .. The Apple ][ is still the computer that started it all as far as Iam concerned. It may not have been the first. But neither was the Model-T.Thank goodness the Apple ][ was at least available in another color besidesblack. .. though black also was soon to come.>> 15 years later, there is -no- computer that I've ever wanted more thanan Apple IIgs. <<I'll add to that.15 years later, there is -no- computer that I've ever seen spark creativitylike the Apple ][. .. and that I've ever wanted more.There was lots of skepticism on the Apple IIgs locally, the Amiga and Ataripeople made fun of it. Too little, too late. Why, etc. In some ways Ithought of it as an Apple //e with the best graphics and sound cardintegrated.The most amazing thing about the Apple IIgs was that even though Apple wentout of their way after that 3rd quarter of 1988 by telling developers *not*to develop titles for both, stick to the Mac and in extreme cases using DTSas leverage to persuade developers dump Apple II projects. That all thisfooling around and it was still 5 more years before lack of demand killedthe assembly line.The last two high profile projects were the Mark Twain (aka ROM 4) and theApple II Ethernet card.The Apple II Ethernet card actually held up the release of System Disk6.0.1 by several months and when the ethernet card had gone golden theproject was killed and System Disk 6.0.1 was stripped on the surface of anymention. The installer scripts were purged and the Network Control Panelwas reverted to the System Disk 6.0 version that only shows the boot OSselection and not the network method. All of the internal support is stillin System Disk 6.0.1A tidbit: The error message - "The Selected AppleTalk Connection can not befound.." The key word is "Selected" - Wouldn't you think "The AppleTalkconnection .." would be sufficient?Well, this was because it was either EtherTalk or LocalTalk as per a bit inBRAM. If you have ever had that message and you can NOT get rid of it ..It's because a bit in BRAM is set and you do not have the PROPER NetworkControl Panel (CDEV) to deselect it, since that was removed from SystemDisk 6.0.1.Tonyhttp://www.apple2.org(A2.TONYD, Cat 2, Top 15, Msg 12)[EOA][OOT]ONE SPACE AFTER PERIODS, OR TWO?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""One space after periods, or two?(KGAGNE, Cat 2, Top 34, Msg 31)>>>>>"""""My own personal rule about spaces after periods:Fonts such as Courier or other monospaced:  2 periodsFonts such as Times or other proportional:  1 periodThis personal rule is not blessed by any authority I know about, and Isometimes ignore it, especially when in a hurry or have a "Senior Moment."Ray(RMERLIN, Cat 2, Top 34, Msg 32)>>>>>"""""Two spaces after a period that ends a sentence.

D with 1 meg of cache, and it's prettydarn fast. <<I'd definitely go with a replacement SCSI drive. To say they're inexpensivethese days (those 1 GB and below) is putting it lightly, people oftensimply give them away now. That's especially true of the drive sizes thatare best suited for the IIgs--generally 200-500 MB.  If you do pay, itwon't be more than $5-$10.You'll find nothing faster than a RamFAST and a decent speed SCSI hardisk.>> Has anybody used both a RamFAST and a focus HD? Can you comment on thespeed difference? <<I don't own a Focus to compare, though I've heard under certaincircumstances they're comparable to the RamFAST (of course I heard the sameof the Apple High-Speed SCSI before I actually acquired one heh).One thing you should keep in mind is the Focus does *not* support DMA. It'salso going to draw extra power and take up an extra slot, unless you removeyour RamFAST but then you'd also lose your CD-ROM drive.  You'd also begiving up several features of the RamFAST, such as it's ability to bootfrom any partition, disabling partitions, ProDOS remapping to any slot youwish (unless the Focus offers some of these features, does it?).>> Also, with the HD being internal with a Focuscard, how hot do they get?I have my ZIP card pretty stable right now and I'm concerned aboutintroducing more heat. <<Since they're designed to run inside notebook cases (a small, tight spacewith no air circulation) I can't imagine it getting more than warm.Just some thoughts though, I'll let someone who owns both a Focus andRamFAST comment on it.Mitchell Spectora_specto@alcor.concordia.ca(SPECTOR1, 3492.2, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>""""">> One thing you should keep in mind is the Focus does *not* support DMA <<That did it for me right there. I'll hang onto the RamFAST.Since it's getting really hard to find low-capacity drives anymore (and Ijust don't like used drives) how does the RamFAST react to larger drives? Iknow about the ProDOS & GS/OS limitations, but what about the card itself?- Matt(MPORTUNE, 3492.3, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>""""">> Since it's getting really hard to find low-capacity drives anymore andI just don't like used drives) how does the RamFAST react to larger drives?I know about the ProDOS & GS/OS limitations, but what about the carditself? <<I've always heard 1GB and larger drives are problematic on the RamFAST.Tony Diaz told me drives over a certain number of total cylinders aren'tRamFAST-friendly either--I can't remember the exact number he gave but I doknow my old Quantum 730 Lightning far exceeded what he quoted me so I'm notsure what to think.I've successfully used an IBM 1.2GB hardrive on the RamFAST (again, a largenumber of cylinders) and the only catch is when attempting to verify the~800MB HFS partition with the Finder, it always causes a hang part waythrough (not with the ProDOS partitions though).Quantum Fireball series drive outright will *not* work, at all. The RamFASTlacks SCSI arbitration phase support (which these drives require) becauseas a host device, it doesn't supply itself with a SCSI ID. That trickallows the RamFAST to support 8 SCSI devices on the chain (instead of 7)but at a cost of compatibility. I suppose at the time, back in 1989-90, itwasn't much of an issue to consider.When looking for a new drive, I'd recommend 240MB and up, 4500 RPMs and12-14ms minimum. Watch out for older Seagate drives btw, they're reallynoisy while the platter is spinning (my Quantum 240MB is super-quietthough, at least this particular one). I have a box of Seagate SCSI driveswhich I'm not using because of their noise level--too bad because there's a420MB one in there that's perfect for the GS.Mitchell Spectora_specto@alcor.concordia.ca(SPECTOR1, 3492.4, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>"""""Ah ha. Searching Goggle/Dejanews I found this quote from Jawaid Bazyar backin 1995 concerning the RamFAST..."The RamFAST works with darn near anything, I've found. However, attemptingto use space above the 1GB mark on a single drive will cause a RamFAST tocrash. I.E., as long as none of your partitions are past the 1GB mark on aparticular single device, you're fine."That might explain why my system always hangs while verifying that 800MBHFS partition (part of it must extend over the 1 GB mark, while the ProDOSpartitions are well under). The question is, is it safe to use that smallerhalf of the drive? I can tell you I did some extensive copying and sortingof a 32MB ProDOS partition on that drive and had no problems.Mitchell Spectora_specto@alcor.concordia.ca(SPECTOR1, 3492.5, Delphi A2 web side)[EOA][POB]PICTURE IN BACKGROUND ON IIgs"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""OK, there is a way to put a gif picture in the background of a //gs.

You couldconvert a GIF image into 640/Super-Hi-Res and then save it as a specialINIT. By dropping this INIT into your /System/System.Setup folder it wouldload that converted GIF as your desktop.

Lots of donated computers and equipment in a somewhatdisorganized fashion.  Explore and find some of those little gems you havebeen looking for.     Sheppy's Keynote Address that evening was a call to action.  We brainstormed for ideas of things that needed to be done to keep the Apple II aviable platform as we move into the future.
