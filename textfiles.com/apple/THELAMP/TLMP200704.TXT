Five more days and I had all six disks.     Now, using Marinetti, SAFE2, an ethernet card, and a broadbandconnection the IIgs can download files in much less time.  The stepsinvolved in bringing this about have truly been An Amazing Journey.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAA]-------------------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 Bulletin Board at A2Central.com  |------------------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson  email: lutefisk at grex.cyberspace dot org[JGS]Juiced.GS V12I1"""""""""""""""Juiced.GS Volume 12, Issue 1 (March 2007) has been sent to the publisher.Featured in this issue are:Mike Maginnis' review of Ninjaforce's Samurai IRC client; a look at thedevelopment of DiskMaker 8 by its author, Mark Percival; an NDA programmingtutorial by Kelvin Sherlock; Andy Molloy's retrospective on the Apple II's1977 unveiling; and an interview with 1 MHz's Carrington Vanston, by theperson who knows him best.Watch for an update on A2Central.com's resource portal once the issue isshipping, and keep and eye on the publication's official Web site,<http://www.juiced.gs/>, for issue previews and related content and links.Ken GagneEditor-in-ChiefJuiced.GS(kgagne, a2c.general_chat, Mar 22 2007)[EOA][GCC]gcc Support for 65816"""""""""""""""""""""geoff wrote:>> gcc has had 65816 support for quite a while now--it doesn't look likethat the 65816 is being distributed in the latest binutils releases sincethere is no owner.

The best way to do that is to access the sessionproposal form at:http://www.kfest.org/sessions/index.phpYou may also email sessions@kfest.org.And, to make it even sweeter, if you do a session, WE'LL PAY YOU COLD HARDCASH! That's right, this year we are rewarding those who conduct sessionswith a $15 or $25 on-site rebate. Wow!
