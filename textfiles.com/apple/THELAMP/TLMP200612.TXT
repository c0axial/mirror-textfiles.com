Other games contained simple text parsers with anon-interactive graphical component; a game where you're drawn into atelevision and must navigate various "channels' before defeating the UglyHorrible Fiend (UHF) was such.At Wikipedia, <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disk_magazines> liststhis magazine as "Microzine (Apple II, c. 1983; geared to pre-teens)".Does anyone else have any experience with Microzine?

Therevised III had it's RAM on a raised memory daughterboard (what hementioned having in his set up) which for the most part, avoided theoverheating issue and the need for the infamous lift and drop. Mind you,when my III was acting flaky I gave that a try just for the heck of it...:)Best to use one of the disk-based memory diagnostic tools I mentioned.-Mitch(Mitchell Spector, a2c.apple_3, Dec 12 2006)[EOA][A3P]AIII problem?"""""""""""""I have an Apple III that boots an Apple II emulator perfectly. But when Iboot in to SOS, it locks up on the startup screen. I have software that Ihave bought and have downloaded SOS.dsk's off the web with an AIIe, neithersets work. Ideas? Suggestions?(James Littlejohn, a2c.apple_3, Dec 13 2006)[EOA][WCY]What Clone Did You Have?""""""""""""""""""""""""I thought it would be interesting to share what clones we've had over theyears, to see what the most unusual one might be.Our first computer in my family when I was a kid was a Datamini I, an AppleII/IIe clone with integrated Z-80 card and language card, lower-casesupport, function keys (press Control+<key> to generate BASIC keywords),and built-in numeric keypad.  We had two Datamini drives that lookedexactly like Disk ][ drives, a clone of a Saturn 128K memory card, a clonedVidex 80-column card, and of course, a cloned Disk ][ card.It worked great.  I still have it.  No idea if it still works, though.(Sheppy, a2c.apple_clones, Dec 01 2006)>>>>>"""""I never did have a clone, though I certainly saw plenty of them. I did buynon-Apple floppy drives, though. I had Disk ][ clone that failed by havingthe speed control go bad. I have 2 AE HD 3.5 inch drives. I saw a demo ofthe Basis computer once, where the disk controller card was installedbackwards. You can't do that in a real Apple, but in the Basis, there wasenough room behind the motherboard to allow it. Blew the board, of course.(CarlK, a2c.apple_clones, Dec 01 2006)>>>>>"""""I was given a Golden ][ clone.  It is basically a 48K Apple ][ plus with alower-case chip.  I played with it a little when I received it but it hasbeen in storage for the last 10 years.  In my collection it is the onlyclone machine I have.-- Mark(Mark Percival, a2c.apple_clones, Dec 04 2006)>>>>>"""""My very first computer was an Apple clone, it was called the "Golden II".It was essentially an Apple II Plus clone with several enhanced featuresbuilt-in (making it loosely comparable to the IIe in some ways; I believe Ihad the final version of the Golden). Built-in it had 64K RAM, a lowercasedisplay with caps-lock key that doubled as a function-key for text macros(of popular DOS and  Applesoft commands), an auto repeating keyboard and anumeric keypad.  I still remember when booting up the splash screen wouldsay "GOLDEN64" at the top (instead of "Apple ]["), which prevented ProDOSfrom working without a patch, but otherwise it was identical to an AppleII.I had a pair of Asuka Newtech 5.25 drives. These were slim-line drives, sowhen stacked on top of each other they were still a lower profile than asingle Disk II drive! They were also virtually silent when loading, justthis faint humming sound. They attached to a clone of the Disk IIcontroller. I had a clone 80 columns card, and a clone Z80 card, plus aWizard IPI parallel card. For a display I had both a green Zenithmonochrome screen *and* a Zenith color screen, which at the time made methe envy of all my friends. I also had a Roland DG-1011 printer and a funnylittle joystick (metal box with tiny thumb stick and two small buttons. Ithink it said "Computer Compatible Joystick" from what I recall). I stillhave it today, minus the green monitor. It served me up until late 1987,around the time I got my IIgs.Another interested clone I happen to have I picked up about a decadeago...it's a "Fugu Elite-5". It looks _nothing_ like a standard Apple II,more like a desktop PC/XT, complete with detachable keyboard. Themotherboard only has 5 slots, has a built-in Z80 CPU (runs CP/M softwareout of the box!), the main ROM firmware on a slot card, it has a male DE-9port connector (not sure if it's for a joystick or something else) and evena place for mounting internal 5.25 floppy drives. I was planning on gettingrid of it a few years ago but now it seems kind of unique and worth hangingonto I suppose.-Mitch(Mitchell Spector, a2c.apple_clones, Dec 05 2006)>>>>>"""""My first purchased computer was a Franklin Ace 100 or something like that.It was really a pretty nice machine, with lower case and the addition of aColor kit that added Color to it's normal B/W.  Odd feature that.I played a lot of Castle Wolfenstein on that machine.(Kirk Mitchell, a2c.apple_clones, Dec 05 2006)>>>>>"""""My Datamini I says "COMPUTER" at the top when you turn it on.  Genericism.:)(Sheppy, a2c.apple_clones, Dec 06 2006)>>>>>"""""My first computer was the Laser 128.  Ah... exploring GEnie A2 with a 2400baud modem.
