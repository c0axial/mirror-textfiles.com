Compter""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Well, I'd almost forgotten about this.  I've been meaning to upload thishere for a while, but there's been a problem with my account that hasthankfully been resolved, and Hammurabi for the Apple IIGS should soon beavailable here.Anyone who wishes to is welcome to upload this to any of the reputableApple II archives, as long as you don't change or delete any of the files,etc.Below is the readme file included in the archive.************************************************************Program Name: HammurabiAuthor: Thomas A. CompterVersion: 1.0.1************************************************************This project came about from the combination of two goals that I had.First, I wanted to learn how to write a desktop application program for theApple IIGS, and wanted a very simple project to start with. Secondly, Iwanted to experiment with portability of modular programming.This is a rendition of an old text based Apple ][ Integer Basic game of thesame name, wherein you take the role of the King of a city-state andallocate resources within the city in order to increase the wealth andwell-being of the city.   I sort of think of it as the original Sim-City.Please don't expect anything nearly as cool as that, though.  Remember,this is my first attempt at a GS/OS desktop program, and I purposely wantedto tackle a SMALL project for my first one.  You should keep that in mindas you judge the quality.******  For Programmers  ******The core of the program has been written in what I hope is completelyportable,  pure ANSI C.   In other words, this code should compile and runcorrectly on any ANSI C compliant compiler.  Furthermore, although C is notin itself object-oriented, I have attempted here to write the code in anobject-oriented fashion.  The files ham.h and ham.c try to mimic the senseof a "class," in that all the code that affects the hamtype structure isperformed in ham.c. The goal was to minimize the effort needed to port theprogram to a GUI system by creating a pair of files (ham.h and ham.c) whichcould be included with any main program and still work perfectly.  Sincethis is C, and not C++, there is nothing to force the programmer to respectthe "wall", but if (s)he does, then the ham.x files should behave as aclass.  Source code is included in the archive.*****  For Everyone Else  *****There are two versions of the program, both are S16 executables. Hammurabiis the Desktop version, while HamText is the text-based version (the onethat should compile under any C compiler).Installation is accomplished by copying the files to a folder of yourchoosing.   Or you can run it off a floppy or floppy disk image, if you'rerunning an emulator.   If you like using aliases, by all means makeyourself one!  :-)************************************************************Instructions for the Desktop Version************************************************************I really hope that game play for the desktop version is self-explanatory.but just in case, here goes:You are in charge of allocating resources for your City-State.  You can buyand sell land, and choose to feed your people more or less.   Heed thewarnings you are given when the game begins!The goal of the game is to maximize the amount of land that your city ownsand utilizes, while keeping the populous fed.  Remember that it takespeople to farm the land!To accomplish any of the allocating, simply click on the appropriatebuttons.

A pointer is very much like anarrow that points at a memory location.  It's a number that specificallyindicates the address in memory of a particular piece of data -- very muchlike an address, like 500 North Main Street, refers to a particular pieceof land.  Where a pointer in a computer indicates the address of, say, avariable containing the number 50, a home address indicates the address of,say, Bob Smith.Why are pointers important?  For several reasons.  Here are a few examples:1. At the lowest level, some important information in your computer'smemory is kept at a fixed memory location, which you must address using apointer.  For example, the low-level keyboard input register is at theaddress $E0C000.  So if you need to read the keyboard at the low level fromC, you might do something similar to:     char *keyboard = 0xE0C000;     char thekey = *keyboard;We'll get into the oddities of this syntax later on in this and/or otherposts.2. If you're going to pass a structure from one function to another in C,it's far more efficient and practical, in most cases, to pass a pointer toit instead of the entire structure itself.  This way, instead of dumping acopy of the entire structure through from one function to another, only thefour-byte pointer to the structure has to be passed around.3. The Toolbox uses pointers.  A lot.Now that we have some idea what pointers are and why they're important,let's take a look at how they work in C.A pointer, in C, is a particular type of variable, which is defined byindicating the type of variable that will be pointed to, and using theasterisk "*" before the name of the variable, as follows:char *letterPointer;int *intPointer;WindowPtr *myWindowPtr;The first is a pointer to a character.  Through a quirk of how C works, apointer to a character is the same thing as a string.  They'reinterchangeable, with some caveats; we'll look at strings in C in a minute.The second is a pointer to an integer.  Integers on the IIgs are 2 bytes.The third is a pointer to a window record structure.  You might pass thisinto Toolbox functions such as ShowWindow or HideWindow, or even SetPort.Creating a pointer variable, such as intPointer above, does *not* create amemory location to actually store the value pointed to by the pointer.  Itcreates a variable into which the address of a value can be stored.  Sonever, ever, do this:int *intPointer;    /* create an integer pointer */*intPointer = 0;    /* store 0 at the address pointed to */The value of intPointer -- the address of the integer variable -- is neverset here.  You're trashing memory when you stuff 0 into a random memorylocation.  Instead, be sure to do something more like this:int myInteger;      /* create an integer variable */int *intPointer;    /* create an integer pointer */intPounter = &myInteger; /* make intPointer point to myInteger */*intPointer = 0;    /* store 0 at the address pointed to */This is safe.  Clearly this is a simple example that doesn't make muchsense, but in a context of really making use of the pointer, it can be veryhandy.Let's look closer at the syntax.The ampersand "&" translates into English as "the address of".  So"&myInteger" is "the address of myInteger".The asterisk "*" unfortunately has two meanings (and therein begins theconfusion).  When declaring a variable, like this:int *intPointer;It means "this variable is actually a pointer".  In this case, a pointer toan integer.When accessing a variable, like this:int j = *intPointer;It means "the value pointed to by".  In this case, it means "the valuepointed to by the intPointer pointer".OK, what's with strings?A string in C is defined using a character pointer, like this:char *mystring = "This is a string";This creates a pointer to a character, called mystring, which points to thestring "This is a string".  This is the first of C's annoying specialcases.Let's compare:int *intPointer = 0;char *mystring = "This is a string";The first of these creates a pointer to an integer, intPointer, and sets itup to point to the address $000000.The second creates a pointer to a string, mystring, but also tells the Ccompiler to insert the string "This is a string" into your program code andset up mystring to point to it.  This isn't very consistent at all.Strings in C are basically an array of characters with the last characterin the array being the byte value 0 (also called the null character).We'll look at the relationship between arrays and pointers in a futurepost, perhaps.We'll continue this look at pointers in C soon.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 52, Top 13, Msg 1)[EOA][GSR]GETTING STARTED WITH REZ""""""""""""""""""""""""What's the best way to get started with Rez?
