I wasn't burnt out at work, but I was set onhigh and ready to boil over, for sure.  So, I used a combination ofexcuses: reasonable airfare prices, wanting to see my good friends theSheppys (aka Sarah and Eric Shepherd), and MacWorld Expo in San Franciscoto get myself on a plane from the islands to the bay area on a Monday nightin early January and into the San Francisco International Airport so Icould have some fun and get myself to cool down enough to be ready to goback to the islands called Paradise and my personal adventure called work.     I'd been to computer trade shows before, at home, and KansasFest, ofcourse, but never something as huge or as hyped as MacWorld Expo.  Boothafter booth after booth of software and hardware--and much of the hardwarewas Apple II savvy as well--the latest and greatest in technology.  Fun itwas, yes indeed.     Even more fun was to see some of our old Apple II friends there.Besides myself and the Sheppys, Westcode Software--publisher of_Pointless_, among other Apple II titles--was there, with erstwhile BeagleBrother Rob Renstrom showing off their latest Mac software, and we ran intoBurger Bill Heineman, the legendary Apple II programmer, as well.     But the most fun I had in the bay area wasn't at MacWorld; it was onFriday night at Midwinter PizzaFest 1998.     There I didn't see bunches of booths or the latest and greatest incomputing technology; I didn't get free buttons or free bags or enter acontest to win a zillion dollars.  What I did see were four friends ofmine--Eric and Sarah Shepherd, Paul Parkhurst, and Joe Kohn--who knew meprimarily through the Apple II, and some warm pizza for a cool night.     We laughed and talked and reminisced and planned for the future, andafter the pizza and soda was gone we kept talking on for hours and hoursuntil it was past midnight.     I guess it just goes to show that sometimes it's not the latest andgreatest that makes a difference--it's the old reliable, what you've beendoing for years and years and years.     Times are different and things have changed from the world of 1986.As far as Apple Computer, Inc. is concerned, for instance, it's a MacWorldnow.     But for those of us who were raised on an Apple II, that doesn'tmatter.  Indeed, it is we who Think Different.  And Feel Different.     Even in a MacWorld, I still have an Apple II Heart.                                [*] [*] [*]     First month's response to _The Lamp!_ has been overwhelminglypositive, if underwhelmingly low in volume, which makes me wonder ifperhaps I haven't made it clear how to get in touch with us.     To reach _The Lamp!_ by Internet email, simply send email to:     thelamp@delphi.com     and it will automagically be forwarded to me.

If that speed is not available, then use the next higherspeed. Never go higher than that, as you will only give yourself trouble!The reason... Incoming data will stream in so fast that the interruptsystem may have problems dealing with it. This will be true, even if youhave actually made a connection at 2400 baud, as the data will arrive inbursts at the computer-modem speed not the modem-host speed.Now all this was OK when we only had 28.8K modems to consider. On anaccelerated IIgs, a computer-modem speed of 38400 baud worked fine. Nowthat we have 56K modems, you may find that a computer-modem speed of 57600baud is way over the edge. Whether it will work cleanly, without droppedcharacters, will depend on what you Inits have loaded on your IIgs, whatspeed your accelerator is running at, what comms program you are using,whether AppleTalk is active or not, etc. etc. Ewen Wannop - Speccie Message delivered by Crock O' Gold 2.0 and Marinetti TCP/IP! http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                      (EWANNOP, 8960, GO COM A2 FOR)APPLEWORKS, RAMFAST, AND PRODOS 8   Ramfast users Beware! :)"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I had a problem using Appleworks 5.1 from finder in my system until Idisabled Ram5 volume.

If you have ShrinkIt add the Binary II for you, the filenameswill match. If you have your telecom program add it, just make sure youtype in the exact same name you used when you created the archive withShrinkIt, but use the .BXY suffix instead of .SHK.It may seem a bit nit picky, but by sticking to a standard format we reducethe chances of problems. - Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager                       (TONYW1, 8956, GO COM A2 FOR)SCREEN SHOTS, IIGS STYLE   While we're on Screen Shots etc........""""""""""""""""""""""""I had a Great little CDA that saved a SHR screen to a Dir you had to inputat the time of the save and it was great.

It has been ordered, and once itarrives, it may take me a little while to figure out exactly how to set itup and use it.So, it seems to me that we may as well get started here on Delphi, and thenonce the computer hardware has arrived, we will have the dual systemDelphi/Genie chats on each successive Monday night.Unless some earth shaking Apple II development happens in the next 10 days,that first chat should be very informal.

You are armed with a"""""   swivel cannon in the centre of the screen that fires 'Snoods'. Youhave seven different types that appear more or less at random on yourcannon.

You can bounce of the sidewalls to help your aim.However every time you fire, a thermometer rises a notch. If the levelreaches the top, the whole screen shifts down one layer, and if any of theSnoods touch the bottom, you die. However if any unsupported Snoods fallaway with others you have hit, the thermometer drops down a notch or two.The strategy is therefore to clear the screen without the thermometergetting to the top so you die.There are five levels of play from Easy to Evil, each with its own screen.There is also a Puzzle game that has 50 individual levels.It is the best Brick-out game I have ever seen.

While they did not inventit, they were the first to use it in a mainstream computer, the Macintosh.And of course, after its debut on the Mac, it was only a matter of timeuntil it showed up on the Apple II.  The Apple II's first 3.5 inch floppydisk drive incarnation, the UniDisk 3.5, was designed for use with theApple //e and the Apple //c.  It, like the Macintosh, offered storage of800K on a single Double Sided Double Density (DSDD) floppy diskette.  Withthe introduction of the Apple IIgs came the Apple 3.5 Drive, compatiblewith the media and formatting of the earlier UniDisk 3.5, but faster andcompatible with both the IIgs and Macintosh.     Of course, Apple's competitors in the Intel world didn't stand still,and they had 3.5 inch floppy disk drives of their own, using a differentscheme for storing data on their diskettes.  Instead of Apple's Group CodeRecording (GCR) format, they used the Modified Frequency Modulation (MFM)format, and their drives stored either 720k on those same DSDD floppies, ortwice as much (1.44 megabytes) on Double Sided High Density (DSHD)floppies.     Realizing that easy exchange of data was critical to their continuedsuccess, Apple Computer, Inc. introduced what they called the "SuperDrive"or "FDHD" (say "fudd-hudd") floppy drive, which could handle the 800K GCRformat as well as the 720K and 1.44 meg MFM format for their Macintosh lineof computers.  With appropriate software, these could handle reading andwriting MSDOS formatted disks as well as the Macintosh's nativeHierarchical File System (HFS) disks.     Very late in the lifespan of the Apple II (at least as far as AppleComputer, Inc. was concerned), the Apple II faithful were presented withone of the last peripherals Apple Computer, Inc. would make for the AppleII--called "The Apple II 3.5 Drive Controller Card", just as itspredecessor was, this card was actually the "SuperDrive Card."  When pairedwith a SuperDrive floppy drive, it acted exactly like the old Apple 3.5Drive--except it added the ability to use those 3.5 inch MFM formattedfloppies!  However, very few of these appeared to make it out of Apple'sfactories into the hands of the public, and the SuperDrive Card seemeddestined to be one of those rare pieces of Apple II hardware that many hadheard of, few had seen, and virtually no one owned.     But as it has so many times before, fate smiled upon the Apple II.Somehow, somewhere, Shreve Systems has acquired a number of the SuperDriveCards and is selling them for $59 apiece!  When they were thought rare,they often fetched over $100 per card.  Given this opportunity, I orderedtwo for my own use, and to share with you here.     The SuperDrive Card comes in typical Apple late-model packaging--browncardboard with black lettering.  It came with a rather sparse manual, adisk of utilities, and the card itself.  To install it in my Apple IIgs, Isimply turned off power to the computer, found an appropriate free slot(any but slot three should work), inserted the card, attached the header tothe IIgs's case, plugged in my SuperDrive equivalent drive (an AppliedEngineering High Density Drive), switched the setting in the Control Panelfor slot six to "Your Card", and booted up.     In operation, it appeared nothing had changed, except that I could nowuse MFM formatted floppies in my 3.5 disk drive!  With a fresh batch ofDSHD disks and System 6.0.1 installed with the HFS and MSDOS File SystemTranslators (FST's) and _MUG!_ (see Volume 1, Number 1's _MUG!_ review)active, I quickly experimented with a number of diskettes, easily reading,writing, and formatting Macintosh and IBM formatted diskettes, as well as1.44 megabyte ProDOS diskettes.  Everything I could throw at it worked likea champ!  My Apple IIgs was able to read files from and copy files onto aMSDOS formatted disk that I formatted with the 486 I have next to it--theMSDOS "dir" command also showed the files fine and dandy.  Same went forreading and writing a Macintosh diskette--not a problem.  Formatting HFSand ProDOS diskettes was a breeze, and formatting or writing to MSDOSdiskettes was almost as easy with the _MUG!_ package.  In the best Apple IItradition, the SuperDrive Card worked its magic without fanfare--it simplyworked.     The biggest problem that users may face with the SuperDrive Card isfinding a drive to use it with.  I happened to have picked up an AppliedEngineering floppy drive that was SuperDrive compatible a few months beforeat a user group swap meet--these are out of production, as are theApple-branded SuperDrives.  It's quite possible to take an Apple SuperDrivemechanism and put it into the typical IIgs's 3.5 Drive enclosure withrelative ease, but this may be cost prohibitive.  Power users who have longhad all of their slots filled may have a difficult time finding a free slotto place the card into.  There have also been reports of difficulty dealingwith 720K diskettes with this combination--I had no problems with these,and I come across these diskettes so infrequently now this may not be muchof a concern.  And the combined price of a SuperDrive and SuperDrive Cardmay be prohibitive compared to the alternative methods to achievecompatibility with MFM diskettes--the BlueDisk Card and generic Intel-style3.5 inch floppy drive from //SHH Systeme in Germany or the Floptical Drivesformerly marketed by Tulin Technology.  The SuperDrive Card will certainlydrive conventional Apple 3.5 Drives that use 800K GCR formatted diskettes,but it is only at its best with a true SuperDrive.     Still, the SuperDrive Card is a real find.  In typical Apple II style,it does its job with function and little fanfare--it plain works, and workswell.  If you need to use 3.5 inch diskettes from MSDOS or Windowsmachines, and you have or can easily locate an appropriate 3.5 inch diskdrive mechanism, the SuperDrive Card may well be the answer you have beenwaiting for.  Thank you, Shreve Systems.[EOA][WEB]------------------------------                  WEB SLINGING 101 |-----------------------------------Variations On A Theme~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~by Ryan M. Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                    Telnet And The Delphi Content Plan                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     One of the most useful things you can do with an Internet account isto telnet.  Telnet allows you to communicate with a remote host just as ifyou were directly linked to them.  Several online services, includingDelphi, permit telnet access.  In fact, Delphi's Content Plan allowsunlimited access to Delphi via telnet for $35 a year.  If you combine thatwith an account on an Internet Service Provider that allows unlimitedaccess, you have a very economical way to get onto Delphi.     Once you have your Content account set up with Delphi, you can attemptto telnet into Delphi many ways.  If you have a standard shell account onan Internet Service Provider, you can easily use the telnet command to getonto Delphi.  Here's an example.     From the main prompt of an Internet Service Provider, which lookslike:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------[rsuenaga@butch rsuenaga]$[END OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------------     I then enter the telnet command by typing in:telnet delphi.com     and press return.  I then get the following:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------Trying 199.93.4.67...Connected to delphi.comEscape character is ^].Username:[END OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------------     Let's take a look at this.  Notice that the first thing it says is:Trying 199.93.4.67...     The numbers 199.93.4.67 are an Internet Protocol Address, commonlyreferred to as an IP Address.  Every Internet site has this numeric IPAddress.  If you'd like, you can telnet using this address rather than thealphanumeric domain name (delphi.com).  Those of you who use _Marinetti_ onthe IIgs are surely familiar with this.  Simply substitute one for theother.  In this case, instead of typing:telnet delphi.com     you can type:telnet 199.93.4.67     and get the same results.     At this point, to log onto Delphi, simply enter your username, as inthe following example:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------Trying 199.93.4.67...Connected to delphi.comEscape character is ^].Username: RSUENAGA[END OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------------     and press return.  You will then get thePassword:     prompt.  To compete the sign in, type in your password and pressreturn.[BEGINNING OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------Trying 199.93.4.67...Connected to delphi.comEscape character is ^].Username: RSUENAGAPassword: samplepassword[END OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------------     and then you will get the initial Delphi logon screen:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------Hello RSUENAGAWelcome to DELPHICopyright (c) 1995,1996,1997,1998Delphi Internet ServicesLogon at   : 10-JAN-1998 17:56:02Last Logon : 10-JAN-1998 16:37:55There were no tortoises in the US Postal Service's annual race for "MostPopular Stamp," so the Hare won this year.

That is likely due to not all ISP's supporting Telnet equally.Many times, they only support 7-bit telnet, which is not capable ofhandling these types of protocols.  If you are having downloading problems,here are some things to try.     Instead of simply typing:telnet delphi.com     you can try one of the following variations:telnet -8 -E delphi.com     -or-telnet -8 -E -L delphi.com     -or-telnet delphi.com,T     If those don't work for you, try just entering:telnet     then pressing return.  You will likely get a prompt that looks likethis:telnet>     at this prompt, try enteringtoggle binary     and pressing return.  Hopefully it will say:Negotiating binary mode with remote host.     and give you another telnet> prompt.  There you can enter:open delphi.com     and hit return again.  Then you can log in as above.     If none of these allow you to do file transfers, you may be stuckusing the Kermit protocol to transfer files.  Several Apple II telecommprograms support Kermit (the latest versions of _ANSITerm_, _Spectrum_, and_ProTERM_ all support Kermit).  While it is a slow protocol in practice, itis very reliable, and will let you transfer files where you otherwise wouldnot be able to.     There are several other options for telnetting into Delphi.  If youhave _Marinetti_ up and running, you can telnet in with the simple _Telnet_application Richard Bennett includes with Marinetti or with _Spectrum 2.1_and the _TopCat_ XCMD.  If you access under TCP/IP with another computer,you can use a telnet client--such as _ProTERM Mac_ on the Macintosh.  Oryou can try to use your World Wide Web browser to telnet.  If you enter:telnet://delphi.comwith, for instance, _Microsoft Internet Explorer_ or _Netscape Navigator_it will try to pull up a "helper application" to telnet to Delphi.Unfortunately, the _Spectrum Internet Suite_ does not support thistelnet:// tag, but _Lynx_ does.  Not all ISP's installations of _Lynx_ willsupport it, of course, but many do.  One of the more interesting uses ofthis for me is when I visit the local public libraries, which allow accessto _Lynx_ via their online catalogs.  If I feel like taking a break fromreading, I simply go to the card catalog and check my email or chat withfriends!     This small primer will assist you in getting going with telnetting toDelphi on your Apple II or other computer.  We will continue to look atdifferent ways to use the Internet to get the most out of your Apple IIcomputer.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :       I tried OS/2 once, but I didn't inhale.         :         :                                                       :         ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: TONYW1 ::::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
