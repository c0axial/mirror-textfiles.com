(Notice the similarity to the name of a world famousmonster.)     There is an early morning chill in the air as we precede north alongthe east bank of the river.  The gusty wind causes us to shift our balancefrom time to time.  No boats on the choppy water this morning.  Here andthere are leaves beginning to turn from green to the seasonal reds andyellows of Fall.     Notice the Rock Men to our left... sturdy "Guardians of the RockRiver"... built of rocks and standing about fifteen feet high... keepingwatch 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Gives us a feeling of security aswe search out this monster.     About a mile further north there is this section of the trail withlots of trees blocking the view of the river.  Come, let us move to theriver bank where the line of trees is broken.  There it is!  Rocky the RockNess Monster!  Long green neck arching out the water... that eye starringat us... those green scallops sticking out of the water along its back!     But look close... the body of this creature looks very much like alog.  Someone with a sense of humor has created this monster and anchoredit in this location.  There still remains a mystery.  No one seems to knowwho built this animal and placed it there!                              Another Legend                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     K-Fest has become a legend.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                 [a2.ryan@a2central.com]                               BUSY SIGNALS                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~     As usual, change is taking place in the Apple II world.  Among thebombshells dropped at KansasFest 2001 was that Juiced.GS, the Apple IIworld's premiere printed publication, would be published by Syndicomm, thecompany that brings you Syndicomm.com, A2Central.com, and a bunch of AppleII products, beginning in 2002.  The winds of change are also sweepingacross the Juiced.GS lineup as founder, editor, and publisher Max Jonestakes a well deserved break and slides into the role of associate editor incharge of page layout.  While Max takes a break, I get to add one moretitle onto my resume: editor of Juiced.GS.     Why is this important to readers of The Lamp?  Simple.  One of theother lines on my resume says I'm the publisher of this fine periodical.     Let's just say that things in The Lamp!'s virtual cubicle of Apple IIpublications will stay the same, as long as Lyle Syverson is willing tohave things stay the same.  After all, his tenure as editor here is thirdand counting behind the Ironman of Apple II editing, Doug Cuff, and yourstruly.  I certainly hope he's willing to surpass me, at least, if not Dougas well.  Acting as publisher gets me out of the month to month tasks,aside from updating the archives and being Lyle's main cheerleader ("Giveme an L. . . "), so I expect lots of nothing to change here.     What could change (emphasis on the second word in the sentence) is theother Apple II electronic newsletter I edit and publish, Apple II News andNotes, affectionately known as A2NandN (Note to the uninvolved: one guyediting and/or publishing three Apple II publications isn't a good idea).It's possible A2NandN will be basically wrapped into what is currentlycalled "DumplinGS" in Juiced.GS.  It's also possible it'll pretty muchcompletely go away.     On the other hand, one well-known writer in the Apple II community hasexpressed an interest in editing A2NandN.  This sounds great, but I think Imight want him to do more writing for Juiced.GS instead.  I haven't yetdecided.  If anyone out there in virtual Apple II land who doesn't alreadyhave their hands full with a few other projects has any interest in editingA2NandN, please email me at rsuenaga@apple2.org.     Until then, I'll keep my nose buried in my virtual magazines, and keepadding lines to my resume.Ryana2.ryan@a2central.com[EOA][FTE]From The Editor"""""""""""""""by Lyle Syversonlyle@FoxValley.net     Well, Ryan, things are going well with The Lamp!

Internet connectionspeeds are very fast (1-1.5 mbps) on my Win98 machine which is alsoconnected to the hub.  However my SOAR passes seem to be quite slow.  I seeno difference from when I was using my previous dial-up ISP and a USR 14.4modem using Marinetti (scripted PPP).  And, by the way, scripted PPP wasslower than when I used to connect via dial-up shell account.I was looking forward to the improved speed the cable modem would make onmy IIGS connection, but there is no apparent speed improvement (over my14.4 modem). How can the connection on my Win98 machine be so fast and theconnection on my IIGS (through the same cable modem) be so slow?I can connect to A2Central on my Win98 machine (using HyperTerminal PrivateEdition v6.3) and the speed is significantly faster than my IIGSconnection.  I double-checked my IIGS connection speed by manuallyconnecting to A2Central using both Spectrum and also the Telnet app thatcomes with Marinetti.Do others also get slow TCP/IP connections on their IIGS?  Is this aMarinetti problem?  A LanceGS problem?
