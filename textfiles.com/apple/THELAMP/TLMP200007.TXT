I haven't done much HTML, but I want torevamp my web site this summer, and that means converting 150 text files toHTML. All of those files are reviews of different video games, and eachstart with a header similar to this one:Title : PERFECT DARKPlatform : Nintendo 64Publisher : NintendoESRB Rating: MatureRating : 9.8Review by : Ken GagneNow, how can I make that look best in HTML? I considered having the colonscontinue to line up, and a friend told me there's one of two ways to dothat: use <PRE> tags, which we both agree are ugly; or use tables, which Iwant to avoid, since they don't translate well to text-based browsers.Now, regardless of whether or not the colons line up, I mean, what looksgood?  Just header <Hx> tags? <EM>? <STRONG>? What do you think?Thanks,-Ken(KEN_GAGNE, 31782, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""Tables work fine in text based browsers as long as you do it like this:<table><tr><td> row 1 column 1 </td><td> row 1 column 2 </td></tr><tr><td> row 2 column 1 </td><td> row 2 column 2 </td></tr><!-- etc... --></table>This kind of table structure works for Lynx and SIS and comes out verynicely for Netscape users as well (well, it will slow down Netscape's pagegeneration since it has to calculate the table size after the whole pagecomes in, but enough people have fast enough PCs/Macs where this isn't aissue). You'll probably also want to limit the size of the table to a fewhundred pixels so those of us who use Netscape in 1280x1024 mode won't havereally stretched out tables with a lot of empty space in them.Geoff(SISGEOFF, 31796, GO COM A2)<<<<<"""""Geoff,Thanks for the suggestion.

I am aware of one current problem in the TCPcode, which affects incoming data not all being received, but this is notmemory related.As for the current status of Marinetti, as I've stated on the public recordprevious, I no longer have a stable IIgs to use. Everything IIgs, I do withBernie.Now, in Australia, we pay for every phone call we make, and cable is stilloutside the budgets of home users (users outside the U.S. pay and subsidizeALL Internet connections going into and out of the U.S., and serviceproviders lump that cost onto the cost of our connections. You're basicallygetting a free ride, paid for by the rest of us. :-)So, I'm not willing to test and debug Marinetti using PPP or SLIP, becauseof the costs, and the time it takes to make a connection. I will use MacIP,which works fine on the IIgs, but not on Bernie, because it doesn't supportAppleTalk.\When an emulator becomes available that supports AppleTalk, or provides afacility for Marinetti to be permanently connected to a network, then Iwill upgrade Marinetti.If you call this "not planning to work on it anymore", then that's youranalysis of the situation. I still intend to work on the code if I'm ableto find a satisfactory networking solution.Regards, Richard(RICHARD_B, 31652, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""> "(users outside the U.S. pay and subsidize ALL Internet connections going> into and out of the U.S., and service providers lump that cost onto the> cost of our connections.

The US doesn't have to pay these costs since they aremainly selling the "service" to Australia. So for America to access aserver in Australia, we don't pay for the connection. Australia is footingthe entire bill for them to access to the Internet and for others to accessthem. This is what Richard refers to the "free ride."As an employee of the Internet business for most of the last five years.this is a standard business model. I have a 24x7 server at my home. I payfor a dedicated line to this box. This gives me access to the outsideworld, but I also pay for the outside world to access my system (for thepublicly available services--i.e. web site). Is this fair? As far as thebusiness model goes, it has worked so far.The way I see it, if an Australia company comes along and lays underwatercables to Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas, then they can charge forthis access and make the money that they are spending. Does an Australiancompany have the capital to do this? Can they be priced competitively? Canthey offer the same kind of services by the current companies in themarket?There is a lot of "public money" that the US spends to further Internetdevelopment. This public money comes from not just the government, butquite a bit from stocks and bonds as well. Can Australia spend what the USspends (stocks, company research and development, government, bank loans,etc.) to be an Internet economic power?I don't know enough about Australia to answer any of these kinds ofquestions I brought up.If somebody creates the next "Netscape," the entire business model canradically change.

It might SEEM easy to get cable or DSL service in theUS, but it really isn't.In those (relatively few) markets where cable modems are being tested, it'scake. Outside those markets, it's simply impossible. You have to be wiredfor cable, and it has to be the RIGHT cable company.My father in law can have cable anytime he wants it. The cost to install itwill be $7800, because the nearest pole with cable on it is nearly 10 milesaway. But if he DOES get cable, he can't get a cable modem, because hiscable system doesn't have it.He can't get DSL either, because he is on a party line (if you are notfamiliar with the term, he shares his phone line with several neighbors).He CAN get private phone service for only about a $1200 installationcharge, but his phone company doesn't offer DSL either....He lives less than 10 miles from a city of 30-40K people, with twouniversities, several major highways and an Interstate.Now I'm not saying that your phone companies aren't screwing you, becausethey are.

Heh..Frustrating? You bet. It's even as bad here in some ways. What Gary saidwould seem to be overall the case but in some places it's not. You havebonehead TelCo execs in their cushy board rooms 'wondering' why ISDN wasnot selling. They just don't get it. It was like they never wanted to sellit in the first place. Japan has ISDN on pay phones (a different standard)and they nickel and byte you to death on it here.Cable (when the infrastructure is working correctly and properlyadministered) as with the case of any providers network is far moreadvanced than the TelCo's xDSL on in some cases 50+ year old copperinfrastructure. the TelCo has to resort to misleading and outright lies inadvertising and claiming things that I have never had happen in the 2+years of using cable service. I got on this system the 1st day it wasoffered in the area. Since then I have probably had a collective 2 hours ofdown time. Sure, there were a few quarks but never bandwidth crunch. Itwould go against them luring all the customers to sign up and watch theservice degrade. I can't say the same about xDSL, Bell be Damned, theymanaged to screw up a perfectly working line at least twice a month inthree locations I have service at. Where as the cable service, I've seen it*noticeably* improve. From backbone based servers, downloads tend to flowat least 40K/sec, a high peak that I get daily would be 225K/sec and asmuch as 450K/sec is not uncommon. When the system first started here Icould barely max anything above 100K/sec or so.Prices for cable service in the US are between $35 and $49/mo n averageincluding equipment. That same service for a business is $250 to $600/modepending on how many IP#'s ('seats') you get. xDSL is worse. In areaswhere cable service is available your insane if you get DSL. It's anaverage of $10 higher a month at least.This is all new to the US too from a lot of viewpoints. The infrastructurecosts were paid for by us in much the same ways as overseas users arepaying for it except that a lot of that already happened years and yearsago.
