As the winterof 1999 settled in, thousands of Crows established their roosting area inthose oaks.     At dusk each evening flocks upon flocks of those big black birds wouldarrive... circling overhead... squawking loudly... then landing on thebranches of the trees.     At dawn each morning they would take flight, circle overhead, squawkloudly, and scatter in every direction to participate in their dailyfeeding.  Those Crows had settled into a rut.     Then at midnight on December 31, suddenly an intense display offireworks was set off (to celebrate the arrival on the "new millennium").The sky was brightly lit... the silence of the night shattered by explodingshells.     The Crows were in the air!  Circling!  Confused!  Shouting at eachother!  Eventually they settled down for the night on the surface of thefrozen river and never returned to those trees.  The Crows had beenfrightened out of their rut.     Life is like that.  We get settled into a rut.  Then for one reason oranother we have to start doing things in a different way.     The volume of posts in the A2 and A2P forums on Delphi has fallen offsince the text side has alternated between working and not working.  Sooneror later the text side will cease to work at all.     This issue of The Lamp! contains material from the Bulletin Board onA2Central.com in addition to posts from Delphi A2 and A2P.  When the textside of Delphi no longer works, The Lamp! will continue to inform andentertain the Apple II enthusiast.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA]------------------------------------  DISTILLATIONS FROM A2Central.com |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[CGM]CONNECT IIgs WITH LANceGS TO TCP/IP CONNECTED MAC?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""If my Ethernet-capable Mac has made a TCP/IP connection to the Internet viadial-up modem (serial port), can my LANceGS-equipped IIgs piggyback thatconnection?  What software or hardware would be necessary?Thanks,-Ken(KGAGNE, Cat 10, Top 5, Msg 1)>>>>>"""""Yes, you can do that.  You need an ethernet crossover cable to connect theIIgs and Mac together.Then you need to go to http://www.sustworks.com and download IPNetRouter,which is an IP masquerading package for the Macintosh.  Install that on theMac and configure it, and you should be good to go.It's not insanely easy to configure, but there is an example setup on theirweb site for your situation that will do the trick.Sheppy(SYNDICOMM, Cat 10, Top 5, Msg 2)>>>>>"""""Yep.  Alternatively you could use a hub (or probably a switch, I haven'ttried that since I don't have one here) in place of the crossover cable,which is more expensive but probably a better way to do things in the longterm.IPNR is probably the best one to use, indeed.  Since you're a student, Ken,you'd be eligible for a 50% discount.  I don't think you have any 68K Macsaround, but if you did and wanted to use IPNR on them for a dedicatedrouter, it would only cost you the price of the Mac (free in some cases, Ijust got a LC 475 with ethernet card for like $10 the other week) and $25for 68k IPNR at the educational rate.I got it set up mostly by luck :)  Personally, I found it easier to set upa dual ethernet Linux box without X for routing, but I think that's more areflection on my being less of a Linux fraud than I make myself out to be.Ryan(A2.RYAN, Cat 10, Top 5, Msg 3)>>>>>"""""Ryan & Sheppy,Thanks for the pointer to sustworks.com.

Effective March 1, members can opt for anEnhanced account, which for US $15 per month or $35 per three-month quarterprovides support for a personal web site of up to 10 MB.  Additionalcapacity is available for a small additional charge.Members' web sites will have the URL http://www.a2people.com/~username, andcan be uploaded and managed using any standard FTP client, or FTP-capableweb site editor.New A2Central.com members may simply select the Enhanced account optionwhen signing up for A2Central.com service at http://www.a2central.com/join.If you're a current A2Central.com member and would like to upgrade youraccount to an Enhanced Account, the following upgrade pricing applies:If your account is a quarterly account paid in January, you can upgrade toan Enhanced account for the month of March for $5.  You will be billed forthe $5 during our March billing cycle.If your account is a quarterly account paid in February, you can upgrade toan Enhanced account for the months of March and April for $10.  You will bebilled for the $10 during our March billing cycle.If you pay monthly, your March bill will be $5 more than your Februarybill, for a total of $15.If you would like to upgrade your account to Enhanced service, or havequestions about our pricing, please email billing@a2central.com.  You don'thave to wait until March 1 to request an upgrade (in fact, it will simplifythe process if you do it before the March billing cycle, which should bethe last week of February).Syndicomm looks forward to continuing to serve A2Central.com members.(Syndicomm and A2Central.com are trademarks of Eric Shepherd.

I'd love tobe able to write a real Apple II program someday (not that Maxster isn'treal, but...).I strongly dislike C/C++/Java; they made for a miserable two years majoringin computer science.

If you understandC, then that is the one to go for as you can port useful routines.The exception to that rule of course is if you need to write code that runsas fast as possible, in which case Assembler wins hands down.Within Assembler you have two main choices, ORCA/APW and Merlin 16. Merlinwins in the compiling speed stakes, but I find it clumsy to use comparedwith ORCA. You cannot compile and link as easily in Merlin as in ORCA.Spectrum scripting may be slow to execute, but I do find it very quick anddirect to work with.

If you were producing items fordistribution, it would limit you to Spectrum users, but I don't thinkthat's a huge deal (couple of commercial products--SIS and SAM--already dothis, as does COG and shortly, SOAR).GSoft BASIC is pretty amazing in what it can do as well.  I think MikeWesterfield is a pretty big Pascal proponent, and ORCA/Pascal is supposedto be a very nice version.There's also HyperTalk within HyperCard GS, which I've never gotten thehang of.With the coming of Opus ][, you can get the ORCA stuff for very reasonableprices now, Spectrum is very affordable, and HyperCard GS is availablefree, so pricing isn't a huge issue :)OTOH, you'll need the references, which actually you ought to be able tofind, but having them shipped to you can be kinda costly.Ryan(A2.RYAN, Cat 50, Top 6, Msg 4)>>>>>"""""Buying Opus ][ would be the way to go.

This should work.2. Making the static text control redraw when the user makes changes in the   Choose Font dialog.  Do you want this to happen in real time as they   make the changes, or after the box is closed?  If the former, that will   be quite tricky and probably will require a Toolbox patch.

At the start of the next round, a message will  indicate how many monsters have joined the fight.* Availability of enchanted equipment reduced for balance. Chests may  contain more lesser enchanted stuff.* Only NPCs and humanoid monsters now equipped with weapons and armour.  But now each individual NPC/humanoid can have its own  stuff instead  of the same equipment per group.(TONYW1, 34922, GO COM A2)[EOA][WTG]WHERE TO GET SILVERN CASTLE v7.0""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""To all Silvern Castle fans, the latest update-v7.0-is now available fordownload!If you're new to Silvern Castle, be sure to download v1.0 also.

This was done for a few reasons:- We found the GS/OS HFS FST to be very buggy in dealing with large(several hundred megabyte) volumes. Either it would corrupt them, or simplyrefuse to open certain files, returning garbage if you tried to read themon a GS.- In using several HFS partitions we also worked around the extremeoverhead HFS imposes on large volumes. We actually freed up 50-100megabytes of space by using five HFS partitions instead of one!- We wanted to be able to take advantage of the more lenient filenameconventions imposed by HFS so we could add version numbers and otherinformation to the names of directories, making the CD easier to navigate.- By using HFS volumes for most of the CD, Golden Orchard is readable onMacs. This means if you have access to a Mac with a CD-ROM drive, you cancopy Apple II files off the CD onto floppies and use them with your GS.This also means Golden Orchard can be shared over an AppleShare networkusing the Personal File Sharing feature of MacOS 7.x- 8.x.Other NotesSystem 6.0.1 is installed on the ProDOS partition, making it bootable. Thisis just for convenience and emergencies. We don't recommend you boot fromit under normal circumstances since it is a lot faster to boot off a harddisk.We tried to place most files useful to Apple IIe owners on the ProDOSpartition of the CD, the only partition which can be read on an Apple IIe.Using Golden Orchard on a MacAll six partitions of Golden Orchard should easily be usable on an AppleIIGS. On a Macintosh however, there are a few hitches. Apple's standardMacintosh CD-ROM drivers only support one HFS volume per CD-ROM. As suchyou will need third party drivers that support more than one HFS volume.We recommend FWB's CD-ROM Toolkit (http://www.fwb.com/ for moreinformation). CD-ROM Toolkit also has the benefit of being able to mountthe ProDOS partition on the Mac as well, so long as you have the Mac ProDOSFile System Extension in your Extensions folder. (This extension is part ofthe Mac Apple IIe card software which can be found in the Apple Softwarefolder on Golden Orchard.)Mounting SpeedBesides needing FWB's CD-ROM Toolkit to access all of the partitions on aMac, there is one other disadvantage to Golden Orchard's six partitions:mounting speed. This appears to be a disadvantage on the Mac as well as theGS. The problem is that it can sometimes take up to 10 seconds to mount allthe partitions of the CD-ROM when it is first recognized by the computer.In this time it might appear like your computer has hung, but it hasn't;just be patient.RamFast NotesLastly, if you are a RamFast owner, and you insert a multi-partition CD-ROMinto your drive after booting, only the first 2 partitions will beaccessible. This is not a bug in Golden Orchard, it is due to the design ofthe RamFast. Luckily, a fix is simple: run a ProDOS 8 program (such as theRamFast setup program, or BASIC, or AppleWorks, etc.) and then quit back tothe Finder. This will cause the RamFast's driver to be re-initialized(during the switch from ProDOS 8 back to GS/OS), and it will then mount allthe partitions of Golden Orchard (until the next reboot.) Alternatively, ifyou boot with Golden Orchard in your CD-ROM drive, the RamFast will alsorecognize all partitions right from the start (but you might have to gointo the RamFast configure screen to tell it to boot off your hard drive,not the CD-ROM, and to make sure all the CD's partitions are active.)If the RamFast doesn't appear to be recognizing Golden Orchard, or crasheswhen you try to boot with Golden Orchard in your CD drive, try going intothe RamFast setup program (hold down zero before the RApple IIgsS ROMscreen) and making sure that all the Golden Orchard partitions are active,and that a partition has been selected to boot from. Joe Kohn.... - Sat 20 Jan 2001 10:05:57 am Message delivered by Spectrum 2.5.1 and rushed to you by Crock O' Gold 3.3! http://users.foxvalley.net/~joko(JOE_KOHN, 35007, GO COM A2)[EOA][GFP]IIgs FREE PROGRAMS""""""""""""""""""Well, here's my first mention of my "IIgs Free Programs" web page athttp://modena.intergate.ca/personal/gslj/iigsfreeware.htmlYou may also be able to help by reporting any errors or omissions to me.I want this page to be the first place to send a GS newbie or returnee.The games section is pretty good, I think.-Gareth(GARETH, 35015, GO COM A2)[EOA][DKE]DVORAK KEYBOARD ON THE IIe""""""""""""""""""""""""""I was idly browsing some ftp sites the other night and ran across thismessage that I had posted on AOL many years ago.

He had a severebirth defect. He was born without any fingers on his left hand. Surgery wasperformed and single joints were transplanted from his left foot to create"finger-stubs". He now has a semi-usable left hand. For his birthday, priorto enrolling in my school, his parents had purchased a IIgs for him. Atthat point he was using the Christopher Columbus method of typing("Discover and Land on it").I had begun using Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing for my 5th and 6th graders --as an alternative to my favorite program (Typing Made Easy). The Apple IIversion teaches, not only standard QWERTY, but Dvorak board. For those notfamiliar with Dvorak, it is an arrangement of the keyboard whereby all ofthe vowels are on the home-row (AOEUI), keyed with the left hand, while theright hand keys the most commonly used consonants (DHTNS).From just the home-row, one can type almost 70% of the English language. Upreaches are less prone to mistakes, therefore the top row consists of thenext most common characters and letters, while the bottom row has the leastused characters and letters.I had done some experimenting with the Dvorak layout and found it to beintriguing. But when I discovered that this student was not onlyhandicapped (in the above mentioned way), and really showed an aptitude forusing the computer, I decided to try the Dvorak system on him. After all,all of the vowels are executed with the left hand, and the balance ofcharacters/letters for that hand are used less frequently than is theright.He took to it like a fish to water. (By the way, the IIgs keyboard caneasily be changed through the control panel -- Dvorak = American SimplifiedKeyboard.) At last speed check, he was typing (with 0% errors) around 70words per minute.I own a couple of IIc's and a IIe. I spend most of my time on the "e".I really wanted to have Dvorak available for my "e". In the back of the"Mavis" booklet there are a number of manufacturers listed who sellhardware to convert the IIe. I called all of them. They were either nolonger in business, or no longer making the hardware.I had read in "Apple Thesaurus" by Aaron Filler (Datamost, 1984) that theDvorak keyboard was available -- built in, like the IIc (and IIc+) -- butthat was all that was mentioned. After spending considerable time reviewingreduced schematics of both the "e" and "c" in "Apple Thesaurus",I discovered that the keyboard switch on the "c" merely broke a connectionfrom the keyboard ROM chip -- part 342-0132-D.THE MODIFICATIONI removed the chip and gently bent one of the legs out and slightly up(away from the motherboard). Then I inserted a piece of insulated wire,that I had stripped approx 3/16" of the insulation from, into the base forthe chip. The location is the sixth hole up from the bottom -- as you lookat the motherboard from the keyboard side:--- ASCII ART BEGINS ---                         ___                      |o| |o|                      |o| |o|                      |o| |o|                      |o| |o|                      |o| |o|                      |o| |o|                  ----|o| |o|                      |o| |o|                      |o| |o|                      |o| |o|                      |o| |o|                      |o|_^_|o|--- ASCII ART ENDS ---The other end of this wire is attached to one side of a 3-pole micro toggleswitch (from Radio Shack -- approx $2.00).The other outside tap has a wire from it to the lower left hand corner ofthe mother board where there are three small rectangular silvered contactpoints. (There is also a fourth point, but it is roughly square.) The wirefrom the toggle is soldered to the middle of the three rectangular contactpoints.Now you can attach a third wire to the center tap of the toggle switch.This wire is attached, either by carefully soldering -- use a heat shieldof some sort so as not to damage the ROM chip -- or buy a small slide onconnecter and solder the wire to the connecter. If the latter, then slidethe connector carefully onto the leg of the chip you previously gently bentoutward.Presto! By flipping the toggle switch one way you have standard (QWERTY)and the other way you have Dvorak. And you can switch back and forth in"mid-stream".If you have never done any soldering, may I suggest you go the latterroute. It is very easy to damage an IC chip with heat.Good luck, and ENJOY. Get a copy of Mavis, leave your switch in thestandard position. Configure Mavis for Dvorak and learn how to use thisold/new keyboard. When you feel ready, use Appleworks (or your otherwordprocessor) and flip the switch for Dvorak.In no time at all, you should easily increase your touch-typing skills(especially if you already now real touch-typing) by at least 100% orgreater.If you are a user of a BBS the length of time online costs $$$. The fasteryou can type, the less time online -- or at least less time responding in aReal-Time Conference.     Feel free to e-mail any comments to me.                 Chuck Stites                 ChuckS 1073 (AOL)                 C.Stites (GEnie)===snip===ChuckCHunk_S --- Your A2 Forum Host -- (chunk.s@foxvalley.net)  Delivered by OLRight!

I noticed that Chinook Utilities gives you an almost unlimited choiceof interleaving options starting from 1:1 up. I thought it'd be wise tomake that decision now, rather than wait until it's full. Is there somekind of test/benchmark that can be done ?Mark(LUKE65816, 35187, GO COM A2)>>>>>"""""There is no formal test that I have ever seen. What I used to do in the olddays was to partition the drive and put a fairly large file on onepartition.I would then copy the file from one partition to the other while timing theoperation. I timed the amount of time it took to read the file and theamount of time it took to write it back to the other partition. For MYpurposes, the best interleave was the one that gave the shortest overalltime to complete the entire operation while reading and writing tookapproximately the same time.You need a single large file to do this properly, but it only needs to belarge enough so that you are able to time it with reasonable accuracy.Gary R.
