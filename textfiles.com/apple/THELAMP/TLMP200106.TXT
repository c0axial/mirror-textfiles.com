I'vebeen a using a real Apple IIgs's for over 14 years now, and I can tell you,this comes extremely close to the real thing! I tried out several games,including: Xenocide, Rastan, The Immortal, Zany Golf, Alien Mind...they alllook, play and sound SO much like the originals it's almost erie!The feeling is almost indescribable playing Rastan, Xenocide or Alien Mindon my television set (through TV-output) using my PC gamepad.And it even runs European demos: Things from the FTA, ACS and Ninjaforcerun virtually flawless! I wonder if Bernie and Sweet 16 come this close...:)Again, I'm just blown away! Finally, respectable Apple IIGS emulation hascome to the PC!Mitchell Spectora_specto@alcor.concordia.ca(SPECTOR1, 3453.1, Delphi A2 web side)[EOA][FAG]FEELINGS ON THE APPLE IIgs""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hmm..My personal feelings on the IIGS or any other Apple vintage computer...I feel they are slowly dying as the days go by. I just started collectingand using an Apple IIGS, which I bought a 8 months ago, although it isalmost fully loaded it is still missing a few items I'd like to have forit.. Example, Accelerator card. It is very discouraging to have mosteverything for it, then be stuck with needing items that are HARD to find.Example: SuperDrive card. Not being able to find items for the IIGS willdiscourage many a new comer.You can not rely on "auction" sites either any more. eBay's listing ofApple IIGS items have dropped drastically, having only about 45 itemslisted now, with most being the system itself. I have not seen anaccelerator card in over 4 months and no SCSI card in over 3 weeks.  Thenyou take your chances when you do bid on items. Games for the Apple IIGScan go as up to at least $36.00 which is about $10.00 short on buying a"NEW" computer game for an IBM or iMac. So the demand for some of the gamesare "STRONG" and can get highly priced.Thrift shops are another possibility, but the one we have here, does nothave much and what they had last week is gone. So I'm sure it varies foreach location.Finding help for the Apple II line is semi easy. When I first was thinkingof getting a IIGS, I did a search on infoseek.com (now go.com) and foundDelphi. I joined and went into the chat room and met many Apple users,(Sheppy, Kim, Loren, TonyD) Remember all those stupid first timer questionsI had? But I was talked into getting one. But now with the CHAT gone, andsometimes unanswered questions here at Delphi, I have to wonder if many ofthe "old" users are still using theirs. There are a few other places to getthe online help, but I prefer "LIVE" chats to where you can mostly getquestion answered right away and I have had several within the last week,(Thanks Mitch!).Finding NEW hardware or software, well.. you can most likely forget thatand it's really sad, especially when some schools are just now retiringtheir IIGS. We can thank KIM for his latest additions, which I thoughtYAHTZEE was great! On the hardware side, I have found nothing new. Oh howit would be great to make a SCSI and accelerator card think of the "HIGH"demand they are in now and what you could charge (although I hope it wouldbe reasonable). Items like that "WERE" selling on eBay as high as $250.00.The last SCSI (Apple high speed) only went for $112.00, so it makes mewonder if the demand now is ending for the IIGS and it's items?I hate to see the vintage Apple's go, especially the IIGS. I still enjoythe gaming on it but I have totaled everything that I bought and I couldhave walked out with a new iMac at least if not a PowerMac.Enough of my long windedness.LONG LIVE THE APPLE IIGS!Steve(APPLEIIGSFAN, 982.147, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>""""">> But now with the CHAT gone, and sometimes unanswered questions here atDelphi, I have to wonder if many of the "old" users are still using theirs.There are a few other places to get the online help, but I prefer "LIVE"chats to where you can mostly get question answered right away and I havehad several within the last week, (Thanks Mitch!). <<There's still activity in the Apple II community, though most people havemoved to A2Central for live-chats and message posting. Others can be foundlurking around comp.sys.apple2 on Usenet.IRC chat is a very real possibility, especially since Ninjaforce releasedan IRC-client that works on a _real_ IIgs using Marinetti. The only catchis no one seems to ever be around the #appleIIgs channel on EFnet.>> On the hardware side, I have found nothing new. <<If you want to talk new hardware, there's the LANceGS Ethernet card.
