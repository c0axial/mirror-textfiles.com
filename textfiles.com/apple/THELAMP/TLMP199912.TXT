This issue'seditorial isn't about the Apple II.  It's about me, and why it's time forme to move on from being your editor every month.     It's been a long time since I've had a chance to rest.  Typically theonly rest I really get during a year is my annual trip to KansasFest--yes,you can rest by not sleeping for a week--and the occasional extendedweekend trip to another island I take maybe three times every two years.Social workers are not known for making it to retirement age without somesignificant case of burnout, so every five months I make sure I do what Ineed to do to take care of myself.     Everything in life was pretty settled for awhile too.  I had myfull-time job, my part-time job, my newsletter, my hobbies--I wasn't shorton time, but I wasn't filled with excess either.  I had a balance.  Justenough of each.     But balance doesn't last forever.  You add one more thing on one side,and you're bound to tip over.  And that's what's happened to me.     I have many other things in my multiple lives that I want to do beforeI'm done, and in order to get to the things that could make me great, Ihave to give up some of the things that just make me good.  And in thiscase, that's this newsletter.     But this isn't just a case of what's best for me.  If it was, I'd havebeen able to give it up a long time ago.  This is also what's best for you.The past two months I haven't been able to live up to my own loosestandards about what a "timely" publication should be, and that's just notacceptable.  You deserve better.     So with a tear and a sigh, I turn over my virtual reigns to Lyle.     Here's to a better tomorrow for all of us.                                [*] [*] [*]     Mahalo Means Thank You Department: it's no small task to say how muchI appreciate what everyone has done for me, and it's not easy to thankthose of you who mean so much to me, but I'll try anyway.     Doug Cuff, Joe Kohn, Eric and Sarah Shepherd, Cindy Adams, Max Jones,Gary and Sue Utter, Steve Gozdziewski, Loren Damewood, Henrik Gudat, TonyWard, Tony Diaz, Harold Hislop, Kirk Mitchell (my KFest roommate for therest of the duration, I think), and anyone else I may have missed in myApple II world--you have meant so much to me, I don't know what else to saybut thanks.  For everything.     To my family who's put up with my obsession for 17 years now and whostarted me down this road with the Apple ][+, words can't express how muchyou mean to me.  Without you, I would be far from the man I am today.     And to all of you for reading: let's take the II into Y2K with style.                                [*] [*] [*]     Aloha Means Goodbye Department: In this life I've enjoyed as youreditor, I've seen things and gone places that I never imagined I'd be ableto before.  I've met the faithful at Avila and seen that which never was.I've had more fun than I can imagine and seen things I never thought I'dsee, made friends from all over the world, and done what I'd only dreamedwas possible.     This is not to say I won't be here.  I plan to still do the publishingside of things, and write the occasional column, both for _The Lamp!_ andfor _Juiced.GS_.  I also have a few other projects which you all might beinterested in (and unfortunately, I can't really talk about right now).And I'll still be hanging out in Delphi A2 Conference during my free time.A lot.     In the meantime, remember to love the people in your life like there'sno tomorrow.  Because when you come right down to it. . .     There's not.Ryanthelamp@sheppyware.netASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][OPN]------------------------------     A FUNNY THING HAPPENED. . . . |-----------------------------------Checking out A2 on Delphi"""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

ROM 01 motherboards make much more challengingenvironmentsI haven't had much luck at all with ROM 01's at all with over than 10MHz orso. Try some other SRAMs if you can get at them easily. Old 486 and earlyPentium motherboards are a good source for SRAM (62256, 8x32).Tony                        (T_DIAZ, 27345, GO COM A2)AND THE IIGS CHECKERBOARD PATTERN MEANS WHAT?   The main processor has a"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   problem. It could be bad,or it could just be dirt or corrosion in the socket, or it could be (if theprevious owner had an accelerator card) that the processor chip has beeninserted backwards.As you look at the motherboard from the front, the processor is a prettylarge chip, near the midline of the board horizontally, and halfway betweenthe midline and the bottom vertically. It should be labeled "65816".Note that this chip (like most of the others on the board) has a littlenotch on one end. That notch should be oriented towards the front of thecase. If it's not, you've found your problem right there.If it is, and you feel competent to do this, you can pry that chip up a bitand push it down tight again. Be VERY careful with it, and don't take itout all the way, just loosen it and retighten it. If there is corrosion inthe socket, that will usually take care of it.Do NOT have the machine turned on when you do this. :) It is good, however,to have it plugged in, and to touch the case of the power supply before youstart, just to get rid of static....If the chip is properly oriented, and tightening it doesn't help, thenyou'll likely need to replace it.(Hmmmm, you would get the same symptom if there was an accelerator cardinstalled in the machine and it had a bad connection. If you DO have anaccelerator, the procedure becomes more complicated, come back and let usknow if that is the case.)Gary R. Utter                         (UTTER, 27363, GO COM A2)>>>>>   It is not the socket soldered to the board, it's the pins in the"""""   socket.Those CPU sockets are of the cheapest variety obtainable. The leadsinternally start like this:(Crude drawing time, this is a side view of a pin inserted in the socket)CPU LEAD   |   | ^   |/ |   / |       |     PCBWhen the CPU lead is inserted it asserts pressure on the socket contactwhich pushes that diagonal part toward the bottom so they are in parallelwith the socket lead pushing up against the inserted CPU lead. After it'sbeen in there a while and removed, that socket lead does not spring back,but as long as only a DIP package CPU with *FLAT* leads is placed in thereit will line up and work.When you place a ribbon cable DIP header in there with thicker leads, bethey flat or semi rounded, they are much longer, much, MUCH stronger andthey push down further in the CPU socket, and they make contact but whenthe CPU is placed back in the socket this is what happens:CPU LEAD   |   | ^   | | |     | |        |     PCBBecause the heftier Zip/TWGS connector forced it's way into that thing andpushed it further toward the outer edge of the CPU socket (inside). When aCPU is not put back, it's leads end up hitting further down on what is leftof the angled part that is now almost straight down and will bend it justthat much further. It may work still. However, the next time it's removedand replaced (the CPU chip) it pushes those cheap pins just that little bitmore where several are not making good contact anymore and your IIgsmotherboard does nothing more than play a stale game of chess when it isturned on.I have had this happen to brand new motherboards right out of the box in asfew as three swaps. I've had others last for two years or more gettingswapped out often. It's russian roulette.If your computer does the same thing with or without the CPU chip in thesocket and you have been playing with Zip/TWGS cards then this is yourproblem. Even if your Zip GS seems to be working but is a bit flaky attimes. The socket is many many times the thing that is causing it.I change the sockets with machine pin sockets and the problem goes away.Tony                        (T_DIAZ, 27474, GO COM A2)BUT IF YOUR MODEM DOESN'T INITIALIZE, HOW DO YOU GET THERE?   I ran across"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   a site with anice collection of modem init strings since this is something thatfrequently comes up. The site is {<http://www.modemhelp.com/>http://www.modemhelp.com/}The only thing is be careful since most of the init strings are for PCusers. Any time an &D2 is used in the init string, it should be changed to&D0 (ampersand dee zero). This is specifically for Spectrum, Proterm, andMacintosh users. ANSITerm does some wacky stuff so I'm not sure whatchanges are needed for init strings to make them work.Geoff                       (SISGEOFF, 27400, GO COM A2)HOW DO I UPDATE ANIMASIA TO 1.1B1?

For floating-point itfalls further behind, even when you are looking at a processor that doesn'thave built-in floating-point, because it only has 16 bit registers and nobarrel rolls to emulate floating-point using software. It also doesfloating-point calculations in-SANE, which slows things down even farther.Frankly, though, I don't think this is an issue. I disagree with the peoplethat think a web browser would be too slow on an Apple IIGS. On a fastcomputer, most of the time is spent waiting on the modem. The Apple IIGScould spend that time doing something useful, so it would seem much fasterthan the processor speed would lead you to expect. I think a graphical webbrowser that supported 16 gray scales and horizontal screen scrolling (orperhaps a zoom feature) would be quite possible on the Apple IIGS.

MAYBE NOT   "Beginning this evening, the maximum"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""    speed download limitation has beeneffectively eliminated by setting it to 53Kbps."I'm not sure what that means, but it almost certainly won't bring telnettransfers up to the speed of ftp. All else being equal, a protocol transfer(ie. Zmodem) via telnet will always be slower, usually much slower, thaneither an ftp transfer or a protocol transfer via serial (dialup)connection.If some sort of speed bottleneck on Delphi's end has been fixed, then theremight be an overall improvement in download speeds that would affect telnetmore than dialups. Since all dialups to Delphi are 28.8Kbps or slower (Ithink), increasing the top speed on Delphi's end to 53Kbps won't help atall (assuming the original speed setting was not lower than 28.8Kbps.) Butif you connect to your ISP at anything higher than whatever Delphi's speedwas set to before (again I'm guessing 28.8Kbps) and telnet to Delphi, thenthe added speed will help a bit. But you'll still probably get a fasterdownload on a 28.8Kbps serial connection than on a 53Kbps telnetconnection. And ftp would beat them both. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager - Fri Nov 05, 1999 2:27:25 am [Delivered with Spectrum v2.2 and Crock O' Gold v3.2a] -- Give me chastity and continence, but not just now.                        (TONYW1, 27164, GO COM A2)THE II TAKES ITS PLACE   And the Apple II is number 5 on The Dismal""""""""""""""""""""""   Scientist's Top 25 Economic Events of the 20thCentury list: {<http://www.dismal.com/top25/t25_apple2.stm>http://www.dismal.com/top25/t25_apple2.stm}--Steve Reeves                       (REEVESST, 27199, GO COM A2)WAS THERE A GSHISEN COMPETITION AT KFEST 99?   No, it never happened. Stan""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Marks and I had a friendlycompetition in his room one evening, and it was lots of fun. (Well, it wasfor me, anyway. Don't know if Stan was that amused since I kicked his butta couple of times. :-)!!!!! )It's clear to me that a GShisen tournament would be easy to pull off atKFest, and I plan to do that next summer. I'll even arrange some neatprizes for the winners.Here's how I think it would work ......-- Choose a few GShisen game numbers that are fairly easy to solve in quickfashion. (I've been collecting some game numbers that I think would be goodcandidates for a competition.) Everyone would play the same game number onthe same computer. (Of course, the players would not know what game numberthey are playing until =after= they play. The contest managers wouldcontrol the environment.)-- Have several rounds of competition, perhaps three. Everyone competes inthe preliminary round, and the players with the top ten times advance tothe semi-final round. The players with the top five times then advance tothe championship round.-- In the championship round, the players with the top three times are thewinners, with the most valuable prizes going to best times. The winnerwould be crowned GShisen king, and forevermore be smothered with adulationand held in awe wherever he or she goes.How does that sound? Any suggestions for setting things up better?I think this sounds like fun.

One sticky point is"""""   would you want to download all graphics before this point ordownload graphics slowly during this time. I don't believe Marinetti hasany kind of auto tuning. What happens is Marinetti will download and buffergraphics as fast as it can (making mouse movement and scrolling verysluggish since all the interrupt time is being used by Marinetti). Theapplication then reads the TCP/IP data when it gets a chance into theapplication's work space. Then the application does it's stuff likedecoding the picture data and store the uncompressed picture into a picturebuffer and draw it on screen if that portion is visible.IMO, until Marinetti supports auto-tuning (retrieving network data only asfast the application can read it), one would be very disappointed with theresults of this. You might get decent performance if using an emulated GSrunning at 50 mHz.

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W. -- rsuenaga@apple2.org Editor and Publisher, _The Lamp!_, published monthly on Delphi Posted by PTMM v2.5 - The integrated information solution                      (RSUENAGA, 2784, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   "Question 1: How do I know if a message has been previously read or"""""    not?"There isn't supposed to be an easy way. A POP3 client is supposed to RETRthe messages and then DELE them. All messages on a POP3 server would thenbe new messages. In Delphi's case, after you close your connection, theserver will delete any messages you've RETR'd, even if you don't DELE them.You could use the RSET command after you've finished retrieving messages tomake sure they stay on the server, but Delphi probably deletes mail after acertain number of days (30? 60?) anyway.So, considering all this, there are two ways to leave messages on theserver and be able to tell what has been read.Method 1. Use the LAST command.LAST tells you the highest message number that was read. From RFC 1460:   The POP3 server issues a positive response with a line   containing the highest message number which accessed.   Zero is returned in case no message in the maildrop has   been accessed during previous transactions. A client   may thereafter infer that messages, if any, numbered   greater than the response to the LAST command are   messages not yet accessed by the client.That was easy. What's the catch? There's two. One, Delphi will delete anyretrieved messages, so the LAST command will always return 0. If you useRSET to keep the mail, you reset the message read counter, and LAST willagain return 0. Other POP3 servers may not automatically delete readmessages (my ISP's server doesn't), so you may have better luck. Whichbrings us to the second catch. The POP3 RFCs have been revised a few times,and the LAST command no longer exists. So, some servers have itimplemented, while others don't. If it's there, great, if not, it isn'tsupposed to be. My ISP's POP3 server implements it, while yours may not. Ifit does work, it makes it easy for the client, since the read status ismaintained by the server.Method 2. The "proper" way: the UIDL command.UIDL returns a unique id for the message number specified, or for allmessages if no number was specified. Keep track of these UIDLs in a file,and compare them every time you check for new messages. If a UIDL in yourfile matches a UIDL for a message on the server, you've already read it. Abit more work for you, but it can be done.Okay, so there's a catch here, too. The UIDL command is an optional commandas specified in the RFC, so once again, your POP3 server may or may notimplement it. On the bright side, most servers have it, so it's your bestbet.My recommendation: If possible, don't keep messages on the POP3 server, andyou won't have to worry about it."Question 2: How can I get the length of any individual message on the server?"Try the LIST command. Without a message number, it will give this type ofresult:LIST+OK 2 messages1 18402 1950If you specify a message number, it will give you the message size:LIST 1+OK 1 1840Hope this helps.Later,- Aaron                       (APULVER, 2785, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Delphi doesn't delete messages if you don't use the DELE command."""""   However, Delphi does move them out of the NEWMAIL folder, sothey're no longer retrievable via POP3. If you do use the DELE command, themessage gets nuked. If you don't use it, then it's taking up space in yourworkspace on Delphi.I would not survive if my mail servers didn't support UIDL (all of mine do- I have my Delphi mail forwarded elsewhere for that reason). The mainreason I use it is that I check my mail from a variety of places (fromwork, from a laptop while on the road, etc), but I want a complete databaseof my mail on my desktop machine at home. So the desktop machine deleteseverything when it downloads the mail, all of the others are set up toleave it on the server.Dave Miller                      (JUSTDAVE, 2791, GO COM A2PRO)<<<<<   So I guess that given these issues, I guess here are the"""""   possibilities:(1) have the email program delete the mail immediately after it picks it    up;(2) have the email program use UIDL to determine what's been read and    what hasn't, knowing that it may not work in some cases;(3) have the email program always RSET after it's done.(3) is totally impractical.

ORCA/C does allow //comments, for example, even though no ANSI C compliant compiler is allowedto do so. In all cases like this one, ORCA/C provides pragmas that allowyou to enable and disable the options. With all of them turned off, thecompiler is fully compliant.As a point of fact, ORCA/C is actually _more_ picky about the ANSI Cstandard than most of the supposedly compliant compilers from the bigcompanies. One of the members of the ANSI C standards committee used tobeat on me when I strayed, and he also used ORCA/C to find faultyalmost-compliant programs because ORCA/C would not allow many of thenon-ANSI C "features", like // comments, that other compilers did allow,even though they were not supposed to. :)Mike Westerfield                      (BYTEWORKS, 2798, GO COM A2PRO)<<<<<   In defense of "//" comments (and thank you again for adding support"""""   for those, BTW :), most compilers that I use these days have anoption for whether or not to allow them.I'd gotten so used to them, using CodeWarrior and other compilers onvarious platforms, that not having them in ORCA/C had become a huge pain inthe neck -- especially after writing code for hours and hours thenrealizing all my comments were incompatible. :)---Eric (Sheppy) Shepherdsheppy@sheppyware.nethttp://www.sheppyware.net                       (SHEPPY, 2801, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   In further defense of "//" comments, BCPL and B (precursors to C)"""""   used "//" comments (or so I've been told).The chances for a IIgs C++ compiler are pretty slim, but Orca/Pascalsupports Object Pascal, which has classes (objects) and inheritance.Kelvin                         (KWS, 2802, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   "Barring a bug here and there, and there are no real show-stoppers"""""    I know of, the ORCA/C compiler is fully ANSI C compliant.

I've often thought that insome ways it seemed a strange omission. As you mentioned, omitting widecharacter support I can understand.

Even the venerable IIgs, born in 1986, qualifies asa computer relic.  Still, here we are--using TrueType fonts, printing onlaser and inkjet printers, doing optical character recognition, surfing theInternet, exploring the wonders of TCP/IP, or just keeping out Christmascard lists and checking account statements up to date.     While there are fewer Apple II supporters than ever, we're certainlynowhere near being out of ideas on how to use them, or ways to have funwith them.  There are things that the Apple II can't do, that sentence hasto be ended optimistically, as always, with the word "yet."     And the Apple II lives on--even with virtually no new hardware andsoftware produced for it, it continues on.  I use mine daily as docountless others.  And I use mine virtually, through emulation--the Apple][ of tomorrow--using both _Bernie_ and _Ernie_.     With one eye toward the past, and the other toward the future, we haveto say that disaster or not, the Apple ][, just as it's been in the 70's,80's, and 90's, will still be here in the 00's, however you pronounce it.               :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::               :                                                    :               :      No one watches until you make a mistake.      :               :                                                    :               :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: LUMITECH ::::::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
