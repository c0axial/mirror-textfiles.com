"Call ahead and come for a visit in mid May to see theIris".  Since this nursery is only 93 miles from my home, this was a veryappealing offer.  It is OK to read descriptions of flowers in a catalog...even better to look at the pictures... but it is really great to be able tolook at the blossoming plants when making decisions as to what you want tobuy.     The Dowis Ranch is a mother - son operation... she propagates Iris forsale... he propagates day lilies for sale... both master gardeners who havecarried their gardening to a higher level by producing plants for sale bymail.     I arrived about ten minutes early.  The mobile home near the parkinglot had a sign on the door... "Protected by a Pit Bull... Nuff Said".  Idecided to wait in the car.  In a few minutes Eric showed up and struck upa conversation, indicating that his mother was on her way.  Janell arrivedright on schedule.     She showed me the various varieties of Iris with enthusiasm.  She knewwhat she was doing by offering the tour... the beautiful blossoms sold meon buying.     Back home, referring to my notes, I mailed an order for fifteenvarieties of Iris.  In about ten days I received a letter ofconfirmation...  the individual plants to fill my order were tagged with myname... to be dug and mailed in early July.  A very special touch.                  Carrying the Apple II to a Higher Level                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Some people carry their enthusiasm for the Apple II computers to ahigher level by developing hardware or software... we see an example ofeach by the announcement just a few days ago of a new ethernet card and theporting of Contiki to the Apple II.

You might think the IIgs wouldbe well represented, with the demo scene and noisetracker/soundsmithprograms, but it's hard to find a game on there that was even ported to thegs.Anyhow, that reminded me that Pirates! has some nice piano/harpsichordymusic, so I thought I should try ripping it out.First, I tried disassembling the game files to see if I could find wherethe music was stored and in what format.  I was unsuccessful, so I triedstepping through it with the kegs debugger and watching what was happening.Yet still it eluded me.Next, I tried recording the output to an mp3 to examine it with pitchrecognition software.  However, the loud volume meant the sound was clippedand distorted.  Even worse, the bassline (stereo right) had nasty artifactsand the notes were almost unrecognizable.Finally, I tweaked kegs to print out the cycle count, oscillator #, andfrequency whenever the frequency was changed.  By comparing the frequenciesto each other, and then comparing them to known notes in the music (fromthe previous attempt), I was able to determine the correct pitches played.(A3 = 220hz, A4=440hz, etc.).  Of course, that was simplified by the factthat only one sample was used throughout the song.  More complex musicwould be more complicated.Anyhow, I now have the note changes and start times.  I've fooled with iton a piano and it sounds correct.  With a little work in noisetracker (onetrack for each oscillator) I should have it all worked out.Kelvin(KWS, Cat 12, Top 11, Msg 15)>>>>>"""""I like OCRremix.org. It's a neat site.

This is now fixed.o Fixed bug that caused monsters to strike first or second character inmarching order much more frequently for parties with less than 6characters.o Screen now cleared properly after key breaks.o Fixed error #22-798 if you tried to dispel without a holy symbol.o SILVERN.SYSTEM now only installs Diversi-Cache on ROM1 Apple IIgssystems.o Ever notice once in a while during combat nothing seems to happen-likeeveryone parried?  I've narrowed it down to the sort routine; which isactually MacroSoft code.  I believe the problem is with the MacroSoftrun-time code when it transfers AppleSoft variables.  In an attempt to fix,I have changed the algorithm slightly so fewer variables are passed.  Sofar I have not seen this bug again.  However, I can now detect when thisbug occurs; if it happens you will get Err#123 (this is not a fatalerror-only a bug report; please report if you see it).o Fixed problem with breathe shield spell that caused the duration to beless effective if the monster's breathed more than once per round.  Stuff Changed in v8.3:  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~o Update datafiles now shows version updating from.o Loot gold no longer given in exact multiples of the number of partymembers, now the remainder is shown and given to the first person in themarching order (who should ideally have the highest encumbrance rating).o Loot gold display now shows more details, showing the total amount, totalcoin count, per share total, per share coin count, remainder total, andremainder coin count.o Items that affect age are now more powerful.o Loot formula changed; animal and other low-intelligent monster types nolonger carry treasure, except maybe for lair stashes, and no longer havelair chests.  Other monster types, like spirits, only have treasure intheir lairs.o Silence spell now has additional effect:  Stops monsters from calling forhelp!o Advancing or called monsters are now displayed without an interveningscreen clear per group.o Higher chance for random encounters to be "organized" (i.e. roaminghumanoids tend to be patrol or raiding parties-possibly with "pets" orcaptives, undead tend to stick with other undead, rats normally don'twander around with snakes, etc.)  Note:  Rare possibility now exists forlevel 2 monsters to now appear on level 1! (especially if more than 2groups)o Poison minimum damage is now zero instead of 1hp.o The dispel formula has been changed slightly; previously if you could"smoke" one undead you could destroy the entire group; now there is achance a dispel attempt per group will only destroy some, the remainderbeing turned, or possibly even escaping being turned completely.o Druids get dispel bonus if they have better than average piety.o Dispelling has been made more difficult for undead lair lords and lieges;their followers (or pawns) are also slightly more difficult to dispel.o Dispelling on the third-scenario Abyss level is now twice as difficult.o Vampires are now twice as difficult to dispel (v8.1 only made themtougher to kill)o Chance for enchanted weapons and armour in chests changed to allowminimum +1 for most items on deeper levels, up to +5.  Note:  Finding highvalue enchanted items is still very rare!  (i.e. Even on level 10, thechance of finding +5 items is only 1%)o The combat parry view monster equipment feature has been removed.o The Red Dragon Inn has been renovated!  New accommodations and rates!Also, the inn no longer shows the time since the last disband in years(only days and months).  New Stuff in v8.3:  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~o Chance to meet Castle Guards in maze.  Pay tribute demanded or else!o Chance some NPC parties will offer to withdraw upon payment of bribe.o Added new grim difficulty mode impediments:  Monsters can have up totwice the hit points normally, and can strike all party members equally.o Some normally fighter-class humanoid lair leaders may be shamans, priestsor mages.o Pressing <SPC> while viewing a character in Camp will show a second pageof commands not previously displayed.  Pressing an illegal key will alsobring up this new list.  Press <SPC> again to toggle the command list.  Oneother previously unlisted command, CTRL-D)iscard, is now shown with themain command list if the character being viewed can be discarded.o The previously unlisted command B)ack is now displayed as a combat option(only if there's room on the screen).o If the real-time combat status update preference is on, it now alsoupdates the monster count status box immediately when any monster statuschanges (i.e. killed, dispelled, stoned, fled, etc).o The number of monsters that wake-up after each round of combat is nowdisplayed.o New feature:  Proving Grounds!  Located in the Blue Knight Tavern, youcan now study and train to improve your character's abilities.  Somewhatsimilar to a character editor, this feature allows you to modify skillpoints using a point buy/sell system.(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 149)>>>>>"""""I should have mentioned that I have released Silvern Castle v8.3 to thelibrary wizards at Syndicomm, so it should be available shortly.-Jeff Fink(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 151)>>>>>"""""Wow.Way to go, Jeff.RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 150)[EOA][TUC]THE Uthernet CARD - ETHERNET FOR THE Apple II"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""There is an A2Central.com news item on the new Uthernet card, anotherEthernet card for the Apple II which is available domestically (well, ifyou live in the US :) and for a bit less than the LANceGS card.

Thequestion remains, can GSoft handle recursion.... <sound of light-bulbpopping on> or can I write a recursive routine in Orca C that I can callfrom GSoft?_________  | homas(TCOMPTER, Cat 22, Top 10, Msg 13)>>>>>"""""Ok, I answered my first question with a quick check of the GSoft Manual(Thanks, Mike, for putting them in Word format).My second question remains, however -- Can a routine be written in Orca Cthat can be called by GSoft?

A longtime supporter of both the computer and the community,Merlin will be sharing with his audience some reflections of his yearswatching the Apple II community evolve.

"You give an old guy the floor andanything can happen!"The following days will consist of official events including informationalsessions, the KFest Kookout, the HackFest programming challenge, and more.Before the convention concludes with the annual Vendor Fair, Friday nightwill witness the tradition of the Celebrity Roast, with this year's guestof dishonor Juiced.GS associate editor Ken Gagne."It'll be interesting to be on the other side of the flamethrower, for achange," said Gagne, who has emceed the Celebrity Roast for the past fouryears.

This would be an all-day affair--an entire day of KFest wouldhave to be skipped to participate.Due to possible rain storms, a date to attend may not be determined untilthe last minute.If lines are an issue, the best day to visit the park would be on aWednesday or a Thursday.  Even Friday would be better than Saturday.  Thespecial group pricing is only available on Saturday (we are traveling homeon Sunday), this is a nice discount price which includes meal.  The parkdoes stay open an additional two hours on Saturday.I am curious who is still interested in going, and if you have a preferenceto go during a certain day and wouldn't unless it occurred on a specificday.This message can be reposted to the KFest mailing list and replies can besent to my email (easily found using google).Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg 42)>>>>>"""""Geoff,I would like to visit an amusement park with everyone, but am not sure Iwant to miss a day of KFest to do it.
