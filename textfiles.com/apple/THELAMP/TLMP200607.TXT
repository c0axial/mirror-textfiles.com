Get cash from bank ATM. 6. Buy supplies at the local store via credit card. 7. Fill car with gasoline at pump with credit card. 8. Check for highway conditions online. 9.

This is currently in Beta, but a copy can be obtained onrequest. Check <www.a2retrosystems.com/Marinetti.htm> for details.So assuming you have managed to procure one of the elusive Uthernet cards<www.a2retrosystems.com/order.htm>, and you have got Marinetti and the LinkLayer installed, then you need to do no more. As you will know, Spectrumsupports Marinetti directly, so anything that Marinetti can handle,Spectrum can too.The Uthernet card runs at 10Base-T, which is quite fast enough for most DSLconnections. You may of course need to add a hub or switch into your LAN,if you do not have a spare socket to connect the card to.It is a joy to be able to use the IIgs without a slow and expensive (for usoutside the US) dialup modem! Ewen Wannop - Speccie Delivered from a IIgs using Uthernet by Spectrum v2.5.3 & SOAR 1.0b11 Setup: IIgs running at 12.45Mhz   LAN: 2Mb ADSL http://homepage.mac.com/speccie(CONDUCTOR, Cat 11, Top 35, Msg 5)>>>>>""""">> I think this means that Ewen got DHCP working at the Link Layer level <<I did indeed, and it was fairly simple to do.

I am not posting the thesis online, as it is a portfolio of mywriting, both published and unpublished, including the most recent issue ofJuiced.GS in its entirety.  However, I want to post the table of contentsand acknowledgements here, as the entire project was strongly influenced bythe members and publications of the Apple II community.The six chapters, or categories, of my portfolio were:Video Games: From Pong to PublicationNewspaper Reporting: Just the Facts, Ma'amWriting and Editing on Computers: Apples to OrangesAcademics: Writer, Tutor, Editor, SpyFrom Page to Stage: Acting Like a WriterCreative Writing: That's My Story and I'm Sticking To ItThese people were acknowledged in the opening pages of my project.

Everyone will be gladyou did.Thank you for your consideration!(Sean Fahey, KFest Mailing List)[EOA][RDS]Requested Sessions""""""""""""""""""Ok, time for a new thread on...

Here, as usual, are the rules:KansasFest 2006HackFest Rules1. Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 19, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 23 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.  However, entries may be described or discussed, includingscreen shots (where applicable), by the KFest committee for promotionalpurposes, or by legitimate Apple II community press.The following lists are not necessarily complete lists of everythingallowed; these are to be taken as "givens."  If it's not on the list,please ask for confirmation.Acceptable software:     System software     Development environment (no customizations)     GSBug     Nifty List     Marinetti     Exerciser     ORCA/Debugger, Splat!     DesignMaster, Foundation, Genesys, ResLin     Talking Tools     Spectrum, ProTERM, ANSITermAcceptable hardware:     Apple II computer, monitor, disk drives, hard drives     CD-ROM drive, tape drive     Hard disk controller card     Sound card (speakers/headphones/etc)     Accelerator card (any speed)     RAM cardAccepted reference material:     All official Apple reference materials (including manuals, technical          notes, and file type notes).     Reference manuals included with development tools and software.     Commercially-available reference manuals.Any other hardware, software, or reference material needs the approval ofthe judges in advance.  When in doubt, ask the judges.Eric ShepherdOwnerSyndicommhttp://www.syndicomm.com[EOA][NVF]Syndicomm Selling Nibble Products at Vendor Fair""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""From sheppy@syndicomm.com Wed May 24 10:39:12 2006Date: Wed, 24 May 2006 11:36:12 -0400From: Eric Shepherd <sheppy@syndicomm.com>Reply-To: kfest@lists.gno.orgTo: kfest@lists.gno.orgSubject: [kfest] Vendor fairSyndicomm will be selling Nibble products on behalf of Mike Harvey at thevendor fair this year!

Past guest speakers have included Apple II inventor  StephenWozniak and Syndicomm founder Gary Utter.    KansasFest, the only computer conference dedicated to the Apple  IIcomputer, returns this year to Rockhurst University in  Kansas City,Missouri.  Last year's convention saw the successful  launch of KansasFeston a campus that brought with it the  continuation of old traditions andthe launch of many new ones,  including the Discathalon, which are sure toreturn this year.   Shepherd kicks off the event with his keynote speech,followed by an  official reception.    The following days will consist of official events includinginformational sessions, the KFest Kookout, the HackFest programmingchallenge, and more.  Friday night will feature a catered dinner  duringwhich a retrospective of KansasFest pasts will be presented,  before theconvention officially concludes the following day with the  annual VendorFair, at which attendees buy, sell, and trade new and  used hardware andsoftware.  This year's vendors will be making  available the wares ofSyndicomm, The ByteWorks, Nibble Magazine, and  more.KansasFest 2006 is set for Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Missouri,from July 18th through July 23rd. Registration information is availableonline at <http://www.kfest.org> or by calling InTrec Software, KFest'sofficial sponsor, at (602) 992-1345.
