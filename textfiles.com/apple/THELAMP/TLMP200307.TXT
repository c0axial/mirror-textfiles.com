A row of parking spaces occupies the space in front of theunassuming brick building.     Inside, homemade counters and shelves display the store's claim tofame... high quality fresh produce.  A wide variety of fruits andvegetables are available, both organically grown and regular.  Today'sselection includes purple potatoes and fava beans.     The steady stream of customers coming and going attest to thepopularity of the store.  They arrive by auto, bicycle, local bus and onfoot.  One woman refers to her recipe for gourmet vegetable soup and asksfor help to locate the 17 different herbs and vegetables needed.A teenager buys a single banana for a snack before going back to hisskateboard.     The checkout system is also homemade.  Place your selections on one offour checkout counters.  The clerk places the first kind of produce on afree standing electronic balance, then enters the price per pound on thecalculator connected to the balance.  Hitting ENTER records the weight,price per pound, and total for that item.  After repeating the procedurefor each kind of fruit and vegetable you are buying, hitting TOTALcalculates the sales tax, calculates the total, prints a tape of thetransaction, and unlocks the cash drawer.     Yes, the 320 Store is truly unique.                              KFest is Unique                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Those who have been to KFest in the past will tell you that it is aunique experience.  Sharing, learning, building, trading, competing,visiting... with others who have known the Apple II experience.     There is still time for you to be a part of KFest 2003.  See the KFestsection of this issue for registration information.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[NUL]NEW UPLOAD IN A2 LIBRARY""""""""""""""""""""""""There is a new upload in the education/word.games.and.reading directory:File: type.away.bxySize: 5632Date: Jun 17Type.Away is a simple typing program for pre-school kids who aren't quiteready for Charlie Hartley's Typing Tutor.

You need to experiment with your scanner software ANDwith powerpoint, if that's the target platform, to be sure that Powerpointisn't re-scaling your pictures.  Powerpoint allows you to create slideshows'targeted' for different screen resolutions, and if the show plays on adifferent resolution, it will automatically re-scale, but the resultsaren't always nice.  I think the ideal solution is to figure out whatresolution to scan at that will bring the pictures in at the right size forthe presentation without having to do any scaling.  Taking some time at thefront end to figure that out will save you a LOT of time later.One other thing about Powerpoint.  If I were to do it over again, I woulddefinitely leave the pictures external to the presentation (IOW, 'LINK'them in).  If you have too many pictures imported, it's too easy for thewhole presentation to be corrupted.If you don't want comments or transitions in the show, GraphicConverteralso has a slide show feature._________  | homas(TCOMPTER, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 400)>>>>>"""""Thanks, all.

Installation of an Apple IIe card.  (See The Tinkerer's Corner in the   March 2003 issue of The Lamp!)2. Replacement of the LC68040 processor with a full 68040 chip.3. Installation of a 32MB ram stick.  (Built in 4MB + 32 = 36MB total ram)4. Replacement of the original hard drive with a 500MB drive.Being one of the "pizza box" Macs, the CPU and keyboard fit into mysuitcase with my clothes.The Mac 12" RGB monitor, modem, mouse, and cables fit neatly in a cardboardfile storage box purchased from an office supply store.  (12" wide x 15.5"long x 10" high)A canvas bag with carrying straps was constructed to snugly fit thecardboard box, holding it on end while it is carried.So two hands can carry my clothes, personal items, and the computer all inone trip from the car to the room.So there you have an Apple IIe plus a Mac Quadra 605 that can be luggedalong when traveling.[EOA]YOU ARE INVITED"""""""""""""""You are invited to submit your favorite Tinkerer's Project for the Apple IIcomputers.Send your write up or idea to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]------------------------------                       KFest 2003 |-----------------------------------[PBT]KFest 2003 - PLAN TO BE THERE!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KansasFest 2003 is planned for July 22-27, 2003 at Avila University inKansas City, Missouri.(Entrance banner, Cat 5, Top 5)[EOA][KRF]KFest REGISTRATION FORM"""""""""""""""""""""""The KFest registration form with instructions in PDF format can bedownloaded here:http://lamp.a2central.com/klo/registration_forms/KFestRegForm2003g.pdfIf you can not access PDF documents with your computer contact Jerry Clineat Intrec Software and request a form by mail.

Suenaga[EOA][ATP]ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE COME TO KFEST - A PINCH OF SALT"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""By some people's accounts, I'm still a KFest puppy. I can't remember ifthis is 3.5 or 4.5 - .5 being when I was a guest interloper at some of theevening events my first year. I've been a regular full timer ever since.Thanks to Jerry Cline, I've met and have kept meeting some of the mostinteresting people every year in July during KFest (and now you know who toblame).  ;)One personal observation that I would like to share is the occasional soapopera that is KFest. Every year, people of all types come together for acommon interest - the Apple II. Most of these people have strong opinionsabout the II community, but not everyone agrees on the methods, goings-onetc. It's political, it's real and it's likely to occasionally rub somepeople the wrong way. Every year, there's been a meltdown somewhere -someone got offended, frustrated, jilted, left out, interrupted,patronized... =) (not on purpose that I know of) but it's understandablethat these things happen when a serious, passionate bunch of people gettogether in close proximity for 6 days, eating weird food and engaging insleep-deprivation. Honestly, we could televise our own reality TV show orhuman lab experiment. The good news is that before it's all over, prettymuch anyone and everyone who got miffed has found a way to make up and letit go. I find it all very interesting, because the closet sociologist in mebelieves this parallels most extended families and tribes. As communitiesgo, KFesters tend to be real top-shelf people. And besides all that, KFestis just plain fun, chock full of chewy gooey geeky goodness.So, take it all with a grain of salt. It's still too early for anyone to begetting miffed. Gotta wait until at least day 4.(Sean Fahey, KFest Mailing List, 3 Jul 2003)[EOA][PET]Peikop Endropov AIRPORT TAXI SERVICE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Peikop Endropov Airport Taxi ServiceThe list of people needing rides to and from the airport isn't very long.Is everyone else driving to KFest, renting a car, or just like paying hugetaxi charges? :)Maybe you just haven't made your reservations yet.Be sure to let me know, either here, the KFest mailing list, or directemail if you want a ride. Carl Knoblock - Telephone Tech - Sat  28 Jun 03  10:36:09 pm cknoblo@cox.com - Via Spectrum v2.5.2 & SOAR v1.0b10 KFest 2003, July 22-27, 2003 - 24 days till KFest On cable via LANceGS & Marinetti 2.0.1 - Thank you, Richard. A2 RTC Staff - Sunday Night House Party - carlk@syndicomm.com(CARLK, Cat 5, Top 5, Msg 69)[EOA][DOP]SYNDICOMM WILL BE SELLING DOZENS OF PRODUCTS AT KFEST"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Well, I'm in full swing cranking out dozens of products to be ready to sellstuff at KFest.

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.[editor@juiced.gs]                         The KFest FAQ Version 4.1.2                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The following article is set up in a form commonly seen on theInternet, called Frequently Asked Questions.  It is designed to answer someof the most common questions people have about KansasFest, the Apple IIevent of the year.  It is not designed to answer general questions aboutthe Apple II, although there may be some overlap.     Any questions about this article can be sent via email toeditor@juiced.gs.Q: What's a FAQ, and how is it pronounced?A: The letters "FAQ" stand for _F_requently _A_sked _Q_uestions.  Whenpeople first hear of or learn of a subject, such as KansasFest, they oftenhave a number of questions which others before them had when they alsofirst learned of the same subject.  A FAQ is a document listing both thequestions and answers most frequently associated with new users, to savethemselves (and others trying to assist them) time and frustration.And by the way, it's pronounced "fack", nearly identical to "fact".Q: What is the purpose of this FAQ?A: This FAQ is set up to assist people interested in KansasFest, also knownas KFest.  Many Apple II enthusiasts are interested in attending or justwant some information about this event, so the most common questions areanswered here.Q: How can this FAQ be distributed?A: The content of this FAQ is copyright 1999-2003 by Ryan M. Suenaga.Distribute freely, provided the content is unchanged.Q: What is KFest?A: KansasFest, abbreviated "KFest", is a computing conference held everysummer at Avila College (now Avila University) in Kansas City, Missouri.Its original formal name was "The Apple II Summer Conference" while itsnickname was "KansasFest", which was abbreviated to "KFest".  Today, theconference's official name is "KansasFest".Q: When was the first KFest held?A: The first KansasFest was held in 1989.  It was originally sponsored byResource-Central, the folks who brought you the wonderful _Open-Apple_ and_A2-Central_ (among several other Apple II) publications.  AfterResource-Central became ICON, The Apple II Summer Conference becameICONference.  This lasted one summer until ICON shut down.  Two differentcompanies sponsored KFest before Intrec Software, publishers of _ProTERM_,took over a few years back.  This July will welcome the 15th KFest.Q: When is KFest this year?A: KansasFest 2003 runs from Tuesday through Sunday, July 22-27, 2003. Thevery popular early arrival day is now officially rolled into KansasFestproper.  Meals, however, will not be served at Avila until Wednesdaydinner.Q: Where is KFest held?A: KFest is held at Avila University in Kansas City, Missouri.  The addressand phone number are:     Avila University     11901 Wornall Road     Kansas City, Missouri  64145     United States of America     (816) 942-8400Q: If it's held in Missouri, why is it called KansasFest?A: I dunno.  It does take place in Kansas City, and if it makes you feelbetter, the Kansas border is very close to Avila University.Q: Who comes to KFest?A: While KFest was originally devoted to programmers, nowadays all kinds offolk from all over the world show up at Avila University.  Programmers,users,  newsletter publishers, and everyday folk show up from Europe,Canada, Australia, and all over the United States to celebrate the AppleII.Q: Who organizes KFest?A: Currently, KFest is organized by a committee headed by The Grand Gouda,Steve "Godzilla" Gozdziewski, who has taken over from The Big Cheese, CindyAdams.  Cindy remains on the committee.  The scheduling is done by TonyDiaz, of Alltech Electronics fame.  Tony also handles the maintenance ofthe World Wide Web site, Devin Reade maintains the email lists, and Eric"Sheppy" Shepherd provides World Wide Web hosting services and organizesHackFest, the programming contest.  KFest is sponsored by Jerry Cline ofIntrec Software.Q: How do I register for KFest?  How much does it cost?A: Depending on when you register, registration prices vary.  If youregister early, you'll get a better deal. Please check the KFest Home Pageathttp://www.kfest.org/for the most current information.  You can download the registration formin PDF format fromhttp://www.kfest.org/KFest2003Reg.pdfIf you cannot download the form or print a PDF file, please contact JerryCline at Intrec Software (contact information is elsewhere in this file)and he will send you a form by fax or postal mail.Q: How do I reach Intrec/Jerry?Jerry ClineInTrec Software, Inc.3035 E Topaz CirclePhoenix, AZ 85028-4423Voc:602/992-1345Fax:602/992-0232kfest@intrec.comQ: Which airport do I fly into and how do I get from there to Avila?A: The major airport nearly everyone flies into is Kansas CityInternational, which goes by the code letters MCI (not KCI, which will getyou to Indonesia).  There's a couple of small commuter airports which arecloser, but unless you're Tony Diaz (who flies his own plane), you're notlikely to use these.Even though MCI is the "closest" major airport, it's still most of anhour's drive from there to Avila, so walking is out of the question and cabfare would be substantial.  Your best bet would be to try and catch a ridewith another KFester who'll be flying in or passing by around the same timeyou'll be arriving.  Carl Knoblock unofficially organizes rides to and fromthe airport.  The best way to get in on the ride planning is to join theKFest email list (information on subscribing is elsewhere in thisdocument).Q: What kind of official activities go on at KFest?A: Officially, there is a keynote speech, sessions on various computingtopics, HackFest, a celebrity roast, product demonstrations, and a vendorfair.Q: Who is this year's roastee?A: Just announced by KFest Roast MC Ken Gagne: Geoff Weiss, author ofSpectrum Internet Suite and many other Apple IIgs programs, will be theguest of honor at this year's roast.Q: What if I want to host a session?A: Email sessions@apple2.org with your ideas for a session.  Sessions caninclude new ways to use programs, new programs, networking, or just aboutanything you can imagine.  Everyone has something they can teach.Q: What kind of unofficial activities go on at KFest?A: Unofficially, there's been movie outings, pizza nights, Bite The Bagcontests, late night eating at Denny's, runs out to Krispy Kreme, FloppyDisk Ninja, Apple II Jeopardy, and huge groups of folks going to eat hugepieces of beef at K.C. Masterpiece and Jess and Jim's restaurants.  Andthere's a new contest this year called "CansasFest", a homemade 802.11bantenna contest.Q: Has anyone attended every KFest?A: One person: Tony Diaz of Computer Circulation Center (formerly known asAlltech Electronics).Q: I hear that the Avila University dorm is wired for Ethernet.  Is there away I can access that while I'm there?A: Yes.  In each dorm room in the halls of Avila are two outlets that seemto be phone jacks.  These _aren't_ phone jacks.  They're Ethernet ports--tobe exact, they're RJ-45 connectors that are compatible with 10 Base-TEthernet.  The entire Avila dorm is connected to the Internet this way,making for high speed World Wide Web browsing, electronic mail, and ftpconnections for KansasFesters during their stay!    The Avila Ethernet uses a protocol called Dynamic Host ConfigurationProtocol, or DHCP, for short. Those of you who have set up TCP/IPconnections with Windows or Macintosh computers (or, for that matter, theApple IIgs) probably have some familiarity with inserting IP addresses, DNSaddresses, and Gateway addresses.  The beauty of DHCP is that it sets upnearly everything you need dynamically, meaning that the server assignsthese addresses--all you need to do is set up TCP/IP on your computer andchoose the DHCP protocol.     Regardless of which platform you use, if you have software set up toshare your hard drive with other computers, you probably ought to disableit--unless you like everyone in the Avila Ethernet having access to yourfiles.     At this point, you ought to be connected.  If you previously had anyproxy servers set up for use with your setup before Avila, disable them.You ought to have easy access for checking mail, browsing the Web, or usingfile transfer protocol--and very high speeds.  One last caveat:    As Spam on the Internet proliferates, it has become accepted practiceto close off an Internet Service Provider's mail sending server--usuallyusing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or smtp--to access from anyone who isnot directly connected to the ISP.  In other words, no one wants to be arelaying point for Spam.     Because of this, it's likely you will not be able to use the same smtpserver you use at home to send mail while at Avila.  There is, however, amail.avila.edu smtp server that can be used while at Avila.  That ought tokeep your email flowing freely.Q: I hear that there's wireless Internet access in the Avila dorm.  How doI get hooked up?A: Ah, the infamous wireless.  Several KFesters have set up Apple AirportBase Stations and other equivalents.  Please see one of them (Sean Fahey,Dain  Neater, Eric Shepherd, and Ryan Suenaga are likely candidates) ifyou'd like to get on the wireless 'Net.Q: How can I learn more about KFest?A: You can get more information on KansasFest by visiting the KansasFestWorld Wide Web site at http://www.kfest.org/ or sending email tokfest-help@kfest.org.  You could also subscribe to the KFest mailing listby sending email to majordomo@kfest.org.  In the body of the email includethe text:     subscribe kfestYou will receive a confirmation email with instructions on finalizing yoursubscription.Q: Should I go to KFest?A: Need you ask?  KFest is a must for the serious Apple II fanatic.  Doyourself a favor--you're worth it.  Show up at KFest 2003, the summer campfor Apple Geeks.[EOA][ACR]NEW UNOFFICIAL 802.11B ANTENNA CONTEST RULES""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Antenna specifications1. Antennas can be any shape or design.2. Antennas cannot be powered by battery or power outlet.  They must bepassive.  The only electrical or electronic connection they can have is tothe router used for testing.3. At the time of testing, the top of all antennas must be no more than sixfeet off of the ground.4. All antennas must have a readily accessible female N connector fortesting purposes.Materials1. Non-exhaustive list of materials:    Food containers (such as a Pringle's can)    Wire    Washers    Bolts    N connector    Can lid    Nuts    Aluminum foil2. The only material used in the construction of your antenna allowed to bebrought to KansasFest at the time of your arrival is one female Nconnector.3. All other materials used in the construction of your antennas must beobtained while the entrant is attending KansasFest through "legal" means.Theft is disallowed; "dumpster diving" is generally permitted, buttrespassing to do so is not.4. Purchased materials exceeding the N connector cannot exceed $20 totalcost; all receipts must be kept and presented at the time of judging.5. Any non-purchased material must include written documentation as to itsorigins, such as, "This length of wire given to me by Kirk Mitchell inexchange for a Budweiser on Tuesday, July 23, 2003 at 9 am."Tools and supplies1. Non-exhaustive list of tools:    Soldering iron    Knife    Awl    Drill    Hacksaw    Tubing cutter    Screwdriver    Pliers2. Tools may not be part of the actual antenna!3.

Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 23, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 26 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8.
