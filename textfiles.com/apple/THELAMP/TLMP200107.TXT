When I had my first IIeback in 80's I remember thinking how cool this was and how much I could dowith it.  Then my friend's parents picked up an Apple IIgs and I had aserious case of the "monitor /// green with envy" syndrome.   Were theApple II users back then skeptical of the IIgs when it first came out, orwas it considered an exciting development?  I remember reading a review ortwo on the machine, referring to it as "too little, too late", and"underpowered".Was this how it was viewed in the II user community at first?  My friendand I were the only die hard II users that we knew at the time.Just curious.:) Dain Neater(A2.DAIN, Cat 2, Top 15, Msg 2)>>>>>"""""Not for me.

They alsodisplayed a graphic image of a bowl of fruit and vegetables which also blewme away.So, did I think it was a worthwhile upgrade?

But that's when Idiscovered the IIGS. A teacher at the local school knew what I was lookingfor, and recommended that I check out the IIGS in her classroom.From my perspective, the IIGS gave me the best of all worlds. I liked theGUI interface over that of the PC-DOS machines or the IIe, and I loved thecolor and larger screen display over that of the Mac.I gave up a little power and flexibility (in the Mac) in order to have whatappeared to me to be the coolest machines I'd ever seen.Heh ...

The alternative at the time wasstill a compact, black and white mac.  I wanted the color, so I got the GSinstead of the mac.  Ironically, the other factor in the decision was thatI wanted a computer that I could still program, and I knew that programmingthe Mac at the time would take resources (financial and mental) that Ididn't have at the time.I went off and bought every book about programming the IIGS I could find.I cracked them open, began to read about pointers and stacks and JMPs andJSRs and event loops and starting up tools and hexadecimal notation andfast /slow memory and zero pages and...  ...and my eyes glazed over, andthose books looked just GRAND on my bookshelf for many a year.Sadly, it's only now, 13 years later, that I've had the nerve to open thosebooks, and discover that after a degree and a few years' experience in thefield, those books aren't quite as arcane as they once seemed.   It's stilla difficult (for me), but not insurmountable task to write a IIGS program.Even more ironically, with the advent of RealBasic, it's now easier toprogram the Mac than it is to program the IIGS.

The hardest part was deciding the best andmost efficient way to make the contents of all those disks available. Afterall, there is a total of 66 disks in the A2-Central-On-Disk collection, andall of them are filled with software. If the contents were described withinthe Shareware Solutions II newsletter, it would take two or three entireissues to do so.Instead of writing about it here, it's been decided that the very bestapproach would be to have the actual editor of A2-Central-On-Disk tell youhimself about each issue and each disk.On every issue of A2-Central-On-Disk, there was an introductory text filethat describes the contents of that issue.

All rights reserved.     KansasFest is the Apple II event of the year.  Every summer, Apple IIusers, aficionados, and programmers gather in Kansas City, Missouri tocelebrate the Apple II computer.  This year's event will be the thirteenthannual KansasFest.     The Accidental Tourist travel guides were described by Anne Tyler inher 1985 novel of the same name (later a movie starring William Hurt,Kathleen Turner, and Geena Davis).  The Accidental Tourist guides weredesigned for the business traveler for whom the mere thought of travelproduces feelings of anxiety and defenseless.  The guides were meant tosoothe and comfort the non-adventurous traveler.  If you've never be en toKansasFest before, this guide will do the same for you.  If you're an oldhand at KansasFest, this guide will provide you with some helpfulreminders.     One word of warning:  If there's a conflict between the advice youreceive from the Accidental Tourist and the instructions you're given fromthe information packet when you arrive at KansasFest--pay attention to theofficial info packet.  These folks know the score.     (If you've read this far with a growing sense of _deja vu, that'sbecause this article originally appeared in _GenieLamp A2_ Vol. 5, Issue 52[July 1996], and has been reprinted in _GenieLamp A2_ or _The Lamp!_ everyyear since, the year 2000 excepted.)     KansasFest began in 1989 as the A2-Central Developer Conference, anddidn't begin calling itself KansasFest until its third year, 1991.  KFestis not just for programmers and developers any more.  If you've never beento KansasFest before, you don't know what you're missing!  It's a greatchance to learn about your Apple II, mingle with other users, and see whatsoftware other people are working on.     I can't say exactly how many people will there, but a safe estimateis 50-80 attendees (counting those who stay off-campus).  What campus?KansasFest takes place entirely at Avila College, in the southernmost partof Kansas City.     Avila College is small--approximately 1500 students--which means youcan walk anywhere on campus in five minutes.  Use of a car is therefore asoptional as it's ever going to get, assuming you fly to Kansas.  (The onetime you are going to be hollering for a vehicle is when you try to get toand from Kansas City International airport.  More on that shortly.)  Here'sthe college address:          Avila College          11901 Wornall Road          Kansas City, Missouri 64145          U.S.A.          phone (816) 942-8400     Notice that KansasFest takes place in Kansas City, Missouri and notKansas City, Kansas.  The Kansas state border is less than a mile away, ifthat comforts you any.     This year, KansasFest is scheduled for July 25-July 29, but dormrooms are available for the nights of July 24-July 28.          PM   Tue July 24    early arrival               Wed July 25    registration and keynote address (evening)               Thu July 26    scheduled sessions               Fri July 27    scheduled sessions               Sat July 28    demos (morning); vendors' fair (afternoon)          AM   Sun July 29    farewell     Check-in time is 1-4 PM Wednesday.  Checkout time is 11 AM-1 PMSunday.  How much the conference costs depends on when you pay for it andwhat kind of accommodation you require.  You can save a few bucks if you'rewilling to share a room--private rooms cost more.  (The prices went up by$50 on May 1, 2001.)  Arriving a day early costs a little more, naturally.          arrival:            Wed.      Tue.          private room        $325      $358          shared room         $275      $300          spouse rate         $225      $250          conference only     $225     It is possible to stay at a hotel for about the same price, butstaying on campus is still a better idea, since after-hours activities area big part of KansasFest.  If you've ever attended a conference held in onehotel but stayed in another hotel, you'll remember how much you'd wishedyou'd stayed "on site".     Also, the campus room rates include meals from Wednesday eveningdinner on July 25 through Sunday morning breakfast on July 29, with theexception of the Saturday evening meal.     One note on meals for all attendees:  For the first eight years ofKansasFest, free lunch at Avila's cafeteria used to be included for _all_KFesters, even those not staying on campus.  These days, those not stayingon campus must provide their own lunches.  Fortunately, being banished fromthe Avila cafeteria ought not make anyone weep.     Those staying on campus should also note that no meals are providedon Tuesday or Wednesday (because both dates are before the official start)nor on Saturday night (because that's the unofficially official night onthe town).  Keep in mind that you're on your own your last night there.You can get a breakfast on Sunday, though, if you're staying on campus.     You will be staying in either Ridgway or Carondelet dormitory, bothof which were built in 1963.  For those of you who have never experienceddorm life or have forgotten what it was like, expect spartan surroundings.Forget the idea of a private bathroom, but you'll be glad to know that therooms are air-conditioned.BEFORE YOU GO   As with any conference trip, you need to arrange for"""""""""""""   several things:     o  conference attendance;     o  accommodation (included in package);     o  meals (included in package);     o  transport to/from conference.     Those attending from outside the United States will also need:     o  passport/visa;     o  medical insurance;     o  US currency/traveler's checks.Conference Attendance   There are 50 or so spaces for on-campus attendees,'''''''''''''''''''''   and even if you register late, there may be roomfor off-campus conference attendees.  You may be able to register at Avilaon July 25.  Check first.     You can get more KansasFest information by checking out the KFestHome Page at http://www.kfest.org.

Space is limited, so you're unlikely to end up in a room byyourself unless you specifically request a private room (which costs more).The rooms are _not_ co-ed (aside from the occasional married couple), butthe dorms are.     Here are some hotels relatively near Avila College.  Please be warnedthat I haven't stayed at any of them, so I can't make recommendations.Approximate room rates are shown.  NOTE:  There aren't any hotels withinwalking distance of Avila College, so plan on having transportation ifyou're staying off-campus.     First, the two closest hotels:          Fairfield Inn--Overland Park          4401 W. 107th, Shawnee, KS, 66207-4002          1-800-228-2800 / 913-381-5700          $64+          (closest hotel to KansasFest in Kansas)          Courtyard by Marriott--Kansas City (South)          500 E. 105th Street, Kansas City, MO 64131-4308          1-800-321-2211 / 816-941-3333          $72-$109          (closest hotel to KansasFest in Missouri)     Now, some nearby hotels in alphabetical order:          AmeriSuites Overland Park          5001 West 110th Street, Overland Park, KS 66211          1-800-833-1516 / 913-491-9002          $89-$115          AmeriSuites--Overland Park          6801 West 112th Street, Overland Park, KS 66211-1577          1-800-833-1516 / 913-451-2553          $99-$115          Chase Suite Hotel Overland Park          6300 West 110th Street, Overland Park, KS 66211-1527          913-491-3333          $89          Courtyard Overland Park--Metcalf          11301 Metcalf Avenue, Overland Park, KS  66210          1-800-321-2211 / 913-339-9900          $119+          Courtyard Overland Park Convention Center          11001 Woodson Street, Overland Park, KS  66211          1-800-321-2211 / 913-317-8500          $119+          Courtyard Kansas City South          500 East 105th Street, Kansas City, MO 64131          1-800-321-2211 / 816-941-3333          (room rate unknown)          Days Inn Kansas City South          11801 Blue Ridge Boulevard, Kansas City, MO 64134-3720          816-765-1888          $43-$50          Doubletree Hotels Overland Park--Corporate Woods          10100 College Boulevard, Overland Park, KS 66210-1416          913-451-6100          $109-$129          Drury Inn & Suites--Overland Park          10951 Metcalf Avenue, Overland Park, KS 66210          913-345-1500          $80-$110          Embassy Suites Hotels          10601 Metcalf Road (at I-435), Overland Park, KS  66212          1-800-362-2779 / 913-649-7060          $129-$169          (may charge for local calls)           Hampton Inn          10591 Metcalf Frontage Road, Overland Park, KS 66212          1-800-426-7866 / 913-341-1551          $74-$82          Holiday Inn Kansas City South          5701 Longview Road, Kansas City, MO 64137-2728          816-765-4100          $80-$95          Holiday Inn          10920 Nall Avenue, Overland Park, KS  66211          913-312-0900          (room rate unknown)          Holiday Inn Express          7200 West 107th Terrace, Overland Park, KS  66212          913-648-7858          (room rate unknown)          Homewood Suites by Hilton          10556 Marty Avenue, Overland Park, KS  66212          1-800-225-5466 / 913-341-5576          $116-$129          Overland Park Marriott          10800 Metcalf Avenue, Overland Park, KS  66210          1-800-228-9230 / 913-451-8000          $139+          Red Roof Inn--Kansas City Overland Park          6800 West 108th Street, Overland Park, KS  66211          913-341-0100          $63-$91          Residence Inn Overland Park          12010 Blue Valley Parkway, Overland Park, KS 66213          1-800-331-3131 / 913-491-4444          $159          SpringHill Suites Kansas--Overland Park          12000 Blue Valley Parkway, Overland Park, KS  66213          1-888-287-9400 / 913-491-0010          $104Meals   If you're staying on Avila campus, meals are included in the'''''   package price (except Saturday evening).  If you aren't staying atAvila, you're completely on your own.     If you find the cafeteria food not to your liking--and manydon't--you'll be relieved to know that there's a supermarket about 25minutes' walk away.  Here's how to get there:     Start at Carondelet dorm.  Stand with your back to the dorm entrance,so that you can see the Marian Center if you look left.  Turn right fromCarondelet and walk down to the parking lot.  Turn left and walk out of theparking lot, down Sister Oliver Louise Drive.  This private road takes youto 118th Street.  Turn left and walk on 118th until you reach Wornall Road.Turn right on Wornall until you reach the intersection of Wornall andMinor.  Turn right onto Minor Drive.     Once on Minor, ten minutes' walk will bring you to an intersectionfrom which you can see a large parking lot.  Veer left and you'll be at asmall shopping mall that boasts a bank, a supermarket, and a restaurant.(NOTE:  This trip can be made a few minutes shorter, but these directionsare simpler, and can be easily adapted for use by motorists as well aspedestrians.)     If you're not staying on Avila campus, you're probably sufficientlyadventurous to know how to find decent food in a strange city.  Be awarethat Saturday evening is when the group has a night out at a restaurant(often either KC Masterpiece or Jess & Jim's).  Let them know you want tobe part of the crowd that night!  And there may be other excursions onother nights... you'll hear about them if you keep your ears open.Transportation 101/A--Getting to Kansas   Many of you intend to fly to'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Kansas City.  The airport youwill be arriving at is Kansas City International (MCI).  The airport hasthree arc-shaped terminals.  If you're meeting someone there, be sure thateveryone intends to go to the same terminal, or that everyone is catchingthe (free) shuttle to the same car rental agency.     You can pick up a city map at one of the airport magazine stands.The Gousha map has Avila College marked (grid location I-19).  If you havethe (1998) AAA map, you'll find Avila College at grid location AX-24.  Ifyou don't have a map, better pay close attention:     If you drew a map of Kansas City on a sheet of paper (8.5x11 or A4size), the airport would be in the upper left corner, to the northwest.Avila College would be near the bottom of the piece of paper, near thecenter.  Point taken?     (There is also a map at http://www.kcairports.com/citymap.htm.  Itshows Wornall Road, the road that Avila College is on.  Look just below thered square labeled "The Plaza".  However, that's just part of Wornall, andis _not_ where Avila College is; that's nearer the bottom of the map,beneath the southernmost part of I-435.)     The distance between Avila College and the international airport isnot small.  It's perhaps 45 miles by the recommended route (below), soallow an hour's travel time at a bare minimum. What with collecting yourluggage and arranging/co-ordinating ground transportation, it's probablysafer to assume it will take you two hours to get from the airport toAvila, starting from the time the plane's landing gear touches the tarmacand stopping when you sling your suitcase onto the dorm bed.     Be aware that the airport is undergoing construction this year.  Ifyou're an old hand, you should know that the airline may not land at thesame terminal you're used to.     If you need more information on the Kansas City InternationalAirport, you can check out their World Wide Web page,http://www.kcairports.org.Transportation 101/B--Getting to Avila   Since the distance from the''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   airport to Avila College is 28miles as the crow flies, and about 45 miles by car, you don't even want tothink about taking a taxi.  For a one-way trip, you'd pay $35 minimum,possibly as much as $70.     If you book ahead, you can get Quicksilver to take you to AvilaCollege at a more reasonable rate:          $29 for 1 person          $37 for 2 people ($18.50 per person)          $45 for 3 people ($15.00 per person)          $53 for 4 people ($13.25 per person)     These rates are one-way.  For convenience's sake, you can also book areturn trip at the same time you arrange for Quicksilver to pick you up atthe airport.     You _must_  book Quicksilver in advance.  They generally need atleast one's day's notice, so call them at 1-800-888-8294 or 913-262-0905.IF YOU DON'T MAKE A RESERVATION, THEY CAN'T TAKE YOU.  Don't think you cancall them once you arrive at the airport--you can't.     If you want to research other similar shuttle services, try pointingyour web browser to http://www.kcairports.com/kci/shuttle.htm.     If you don't want to rent a car, you could also take the AirportExpress van to the Overland Park Marriott hotel and take a cab from there.(Those of you renting cars at the airport: we'll discuss the route shortly,in the ARRIVAL section.)PREPARING FOR THE TRIP   Get plenty of sleep before you go, because you're""""""""""""""""""""""   not likely to get much sleep at KansasFest.KansasFest days are 18 hours long, unless they're 20 or 24 hours long.There's too much going on to waste time in sleep!     On the same note, make sure you don't schedule anything important(like operating heavy machinery) for the day after KansasFest--Monday, July30.  You'll have had so little sleep that you won't feel your best.Packing--Computer Stuff   Lots of people bring computers.  If you're doing'''''''''''''''''''''''   this, make a backup of your hard drive and leavethe backup at home.  If you won't feel safe unless you take a backup withyou, make two backups.     If you're bringing a hard drive and you're travelling by plane, youmay want to consider packing the hard drive in your carry-on luggage.  Thatway, you can extract the hard drive from the luggage before it gets X-rayed(!).  Tell the attendant that what you are carrying in your hand is a harddrive for a computer, and the X-ray machine might damage it.  Chances arethey'll handle it differently.  If they tell you that no damage couldpossibly be caused, don't believe them.  (You may have to obey them, butdon't believe them.)  Try insisting--politely!--on special handling anyway.Incidentally, X-rays are not good for diskettes either.     Bring extension cords, power bars, and surge suppressors, plus aphone cord if you bring your modem, or a properly configured Ethernet cableif you'll be using a Macintosh or WinTel box, or have a LANceGS card and aseparate router.  (For Ethernet cable details, see Ryan Suenaga's KFestFAQ, available at http://www.kfest.org/kfestfaq.html.)  Bring plenty ofblank disks.  Bring anything you'd like to show off, either software orhardware.Packing--Other Stuff   A word about clothing:  KansasFest is "dress''''''''''''''''''''   casual", and Kansas City in July is hot and humid,so light clothing would be a good idea.  If you're bringing anything thatyou want to hang in the closet, bring your own hangers.     You should pack a bathrobe or something you don't mind walking thehalls in when you rise in the morning.  The dorms will be housing bothsexes, and there are no private bathrooms.     Towels are supplied, but you can pack an extra one if you feel soinclined.  Be sure to bring all the usual toiletries:  soap, shampoo,toothbrush, and all the etceteras.     There are modular phone jacks in all the dorm rooms, but phones arenot provided, so pack a phone, if only for local calls (which are free).If you know who your roommate is, you can assure her or him that you'rebringing the phone and save her or him the trouble.     If you're serious about making the morning sessions, an alarm clockis a good idea.  If you're _really_ serious about attending morningsessions, ear plugs--for the night before--couldn't hurt either. <grin>     Unless you're a private soul, some sort of sign for your door is agood idea, so that people can find you.  Many people take the trouble tomake their signs before they leave home.     Don't forget your airline tickets and other travel documents, if any,but don't pack them in your checked luggage.  Also don't forget a quarterand a dime for a phone call.ARRIVING   As long as you arrive during normal check-in hours, 1-4 PM""""""""   Wednesday, you shouldn't experience any problems.  But what ifyou know you won't arrive then?  What if you've never been to Kansas Citybefore?  What if you've never left your home town before?  Read on, andwe'll deal with several what-ifs.Getting from the Airport to Avila   If you've arranged with an airport'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   transportation service (likeQuicksilver) to pick you up at the airport, as you leave the "gate", lookfor someone holding up a sign with your name on it.  (The sign willprobably also have the name of the service written on it.)     Of course, these airport shuttles have been known to get busy atKansasFest time.  If no one is there looking for you, start looking forthem.  Their people are usually easy to spot.  If there's no one from theairport transportation service in the terminal, don't panic.  Just callthem--it'll be a local call from the airport.  (You did remember the coinsfor a phone call, didn't you?)     Remember that you usually _cannot_ ride with an airport shuttleservice unless you have made a reservation in advance.Driving from the Airport to Avila   If you're renting a car, look for the'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   desk of the rental agency you'redealing with.  (If you have to go to another terminal, remember that thereare free shuttle buses among the three terminals.)     Once you've got your car, exit through the airport's main gate(Cookingham Drive) onto Interstate 29 heading south. At highway 152, exitwest.  Follow 152 west to I-435.  Take I-435 south and follow it arounduntil it reaches Wornall Road from the west.  Take the Wornall Road exit.Then turn in at Avila College (which is a left turn off Wornall if youapproach it from I-435).  Check our handy Avila map below for where topark.  The best place is probably the lot near the dormitories.After Hours Arrival   It's Wednesday night, and it's dark already.  The'''''''''''''''''''   airport limo has just dropped you off... or you'vejust parked the rental car.  You're tired after the long drive from theairport.  You've never been to Avila College before.  Now what do you do?     Well, if you know beforehand that you're going to arrive after hours,you should contact KFest organizer Steve Gozdziewski so that he can let theAvila staff know about late arrivals.  Suppose, however, that you'vearrived late by accident--your flight was delayed, or your car had a flat?What do you do now?     It's easy.  The campus at Avila is small, and there are only a fewbuildings that KFesters need to explore:     I and II. either Ridgway or Carondelet dormitory:  This is where yousleep, at least in theory.  Even hotel-dwellers need to know about thedorms, since sessions are held in the lounges in the dorms.  And anyway,most people spend a lot of evenings hanging out here.     III. Marian Center:  This is where the cafeteria is.  Unless you'rebooked into a nearby hotel, this is where you come to eat.  This is alsowhere the keynote address is traditionally held.  Yes, you're allowed toattend the keynote address even if you're staying at a hotel.     IV. Whitfield Conference Center:  This building won't be used forKansasFest this year, just in case the vendor fair or some other event isrelocated here at the last minute.  (Whitfield has been used in past yearsfor various events.)  The building is sufficiently small that you'd have totry really hard to get lost here.  If you walk the path to Whitfield fromone of the other buildings listed below, go down the stairs as soon as youget inside the door.

If it's late Wednesday night,forget about registering for the _conference_.  Check-in ended at 4 PM.Concentrate on registering for your _room_, so at least you'll have a placeto sleep tonight.     If it's extremely late at night, the front doors of the dorms may beshut.  Look for a buzzer that will rouse a member of the staff.     The best thing to do is to read the instructions in your preliminaryinformation packet.  If those instructions don't produce satisfactoryresults, wander about one or both of the dorms until you find someonewho'll take pity on you.  You'll get a room assignment and a room key.(You may even get a sheet of paper that tells you who you've been billetedwith and how to register for the conference on the following morning.)     Do not panic when you see your room key.  If you're staying inRidgway, the lowest number it will have on it is 401.  That does _not_ meanyou're on the fourth floor.  (Particularly as Ridgway has only threefloors.)  If your room number begins with 4, it means you're on the firstfloor (or "ground floor" to most Europeans).  Similar deal for the secondand third floors.  If your room number doesn't begin with 4, 5, or 6, itmeans you aren't staying at Ridgway--you're probably staying at Carondelet.     If wandering around the dorms doesn't produce any results, try MarianCenter.  If you still can't find anyone, wander down toward Whitfield.     Arriving after hours means you get to check in to your room.  Youstill must register for the conference in the morning.  We'll cover that inthe "Business Hours Arrival" section.  For now, what about your room?Your Room   Rooms at the Avila College dorms each have two beds.  If your'''''''''   roommate is there, smile and introduce yourself.  If yourroommate isn't there, don't be alarmed.  Your roommate may not have arrivedyet, in which case you get to grab the best bed.  (I'm joking.  Neither bedwill be any less loathsome than the other.)  Probably your roommate hasalready arrived, grabbed the best bed, and is out visiting others.     Near the beds is a long institutional-looking unit with two closets,two sets of drawers, and assorted storage space.  The opposite side of thisunit is a desk long enough for two people to work at.  There's plenty ofroom for two computers on this desk, but there's just one outlet percomputer.  If you don't have a power bar or a Kensington System Saver or anAE Conserver, you're going to be limited to plugging in the computer andthe monitor--no hard drive, no modem, nothing else.  (Those of you withinternal hard drives can stop being smug right now.)     Near the desk are two outlets that seem to be phone jacks.  They_aren't_ phone jacks--they're Ethernet ports (RJ-45 connectors to a 10Base-T connection, for the technically-oriented).  The phone jack is on theother side of the room, by the beds.  If you didn't bring plenty of phoneextension cord, you'll have to set up your computer at the foot of yourbed.  (Don't laugh.  It's happened.)  Don't waste time looking for thephone; they aren't supplied, which is why you had to bring one in yoursuitcase.  To find out the phone number of your room (so that people cancall you), ask one of the Avila staff.  If you didn't bring a phone, youcan still use one of the pay phones in the hallways.     When dialing out from your dorm room, either with a phone or a modem,you'll need to prefix the number with a 9 to get an outside line.  Ifyou're using a modem, you may be able to use its "wait for dialtone"feature before you dial the number.  So the proper sequence would be:          ATDT9w5550012     If your modem doesn't support "wait for dialtone", try using a fewcommas (,) to create a pause:          ATDT9,,5550012     You may also need to set your software up so it waits about 45seconds for a connect instead of the standard 30 seconds, because it takesa bit longer to get through to the number you're dialing.     Of course, if you've brought a Macintosh or WinTel box, or you have aLANceGS card and have brought a separate router, you may be able to use theEthernet connection instead of the phone line.  There are several gotchashere.  Check out Ryan Suenaga's KFest FAQ for more information.     The only real luxury in these rooms is air-conditioning.  No privatebaths here, but you'll find bathrooms just down the corridor a piece.  Theone I frequented had one bathtub, two showers, three toilets, four sinks(one with an attachment for washing hair), and assorted mirrors.  Everyfloor also seems to have a TV lounge and a small kitchen.Business Hours Arrival   If you arrive at Avila between 9 AM and 5 PM''''''''''''''''''''''   (preferably between 1 PM and 4 PM Wednesday!), youcan register for the conference and your room (if applicable) at the sametime.  Check your pre-conference packet for information on where toregister.  It will be somewhere in one of the four buildings mentionedabove, of course--probably one of the dorms.     One note of warning:  if you've been told to register somewhere--say,Ridgway dorm--and no one has shown up fifteen minutes after the listedstart time, then by all means check Carondelet dorm, Marian Center, andWhitfield Center to see if registration has been moved there.  It'sunlikely you'll have to worry about something like this, but it doesn'thurt to be prepared.ONCE YOU'RE THERE   KansasFest is not difficult to figure out.  Still, here"""""""""""""""""   are a few tips to help you get the most out of theexperience.Curricular Events   Originally, KansasFest was a conference for Apple II'''''''''''''''''   developers--people who wanted to create software andhardware for others to use.  Nowadays it's for users, too.  Don't worrythat you don't belong there--you do and you're welcome, whether you've cometo party or come to learn.     The sessions--no one dignifies them with the name "seminars"--aremostly in the lounge areas of the dormitories.  Wandering around is a goodskill to develop.     On Saturday, there's a demonstration of new and upcoming products anda vendors' fair.  The fair is a chance to pick up products at special KFestprices, and to see and buy software never before released.Semi-curricular Events   While not officially part of the proceedings, some''''''''''''''''''''''   products _may_ be released at KansasFest.  (Isometimes think Apple II programmers would never ever ship if it weren'tfor KansasFest and Christmas.)  This year, I haven't heard anyannouncements, so you'll have to attend to find out what's up-and-coming.     Even if nothing gets released, you're practically guaranteed someproduct previews.  At this point, in previous years, I've made a few wildguesses at what you might see.  Sadly, this year I've been so busy that Ihaven't been in a position to hear any rumors.     A great programming event again this year is HackFest, which begins 7AM Wednesday and closes to entries 7 AM Saturday.  Syndicomm sponsors thisevent to produce software for the Apple II community.Extra-curricular Events   It is perfectly possible to attend KansasFest,'''''''''''''''''''''''   attend the sessions 9-5, and go back home.  Butwhy would you want to?     One reason you might want to is that you're shy.  You're shy at anygathering, but you can't imagine conversing with Eric Shepherd, GeoffWeiss, Joe Kohn, Max Jones, or Ryan Suenaga!  There's no reason to be shy.Do what Dean Esmay did at his first KansasFest:  walk around introducingyourself.  To everyone.  You'll meet lots of people just as awestruck asyou are, and you can swap tips, stories, recommendations, and lies.  Don'tbe intimidated by meeting well-known Apple II figures.  Heck, we're all"just folks".     Don't let yourself leave KansasFest without having mingled.  Wanderaround the dorms.  If there's one person sitting at a computer, just say"hi".  You're intelligent enough to know how to figure out if the person ishard at work or at home to callers.  If there are several people--which isfar more likely, particularly during the evening--you might be shy aboutjoining the group.  Don't be.  Just announce your presence ("Hi, everybody!Room for one more?").  You'll be surprised how welcome the group will makeyou feel.  Whatever the group is doing, it's probably in "kibitz mode", sojoin in!  What will the group be doing?  Hard to say.  They might be:     o  trying out software that hasn't been released yet;     o  trying to get a piece of software to crash;     o  trying to get it to stop crashing (i.e. debugging it);     o  sending a group message to A2Central.com;     o  playing a game;     o  fixing hardware;     o  reminiscing about previous KansasFests; or     o  telling stories about the heyday of the Apple II.     There's a chance that the group will be "multi-tasking"--that is,doing more than one of these things at the same time.     There are other extra-curricular events that have almost become KFesttraditions:  Nerf(TM) warfare and a game called Bite the Bag, whichinvolves a paper bag and a sense of balance.  But what about the "real"traditions?Tradition I: Celebrity Roast   If the term "celebrity roast" is new to you,''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   rest assured that it's not dangerous, noteven to the celebrity.  Open flame is not involved, except metaphorically.A roast is simply an event where members of a panel give short speecheswhich "honor" the celebrity guest by dishing out good-natured insults andback-handed compliments:  "Max Jones refuses to admit that the Apple II isdead.  That's an admirable quality, but it's possible to take it too far.Max also refuses to admit that his ancestors are dead, and he props them upat the dinner table every night.  The conversation is deadly enough, butthe smell is unbearable."  (Except that most of the jokes will be funnierthan that.)  Ideally, the person being "roasted" is the keynote speakerfrom the previous KFest, but this isn't always possible.     This year, the celebrity being roasted is Max Jones, editor of_Juiced.GS_.  The celebrity roast is open to all KansasFest attendees, notjust those staying on campus.     There's a new tradition tied to this tradition:  the celebrity getsto pick the restaurant for the Saturday night dinner.  See Tradition III.Tradition II: Online Reports   The link between KansasFest and one online''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   message board or another goes back a longway.  The tradition may have begun with CompuServe, but it quickly became afixture on Genie for many years.  When the Genie A2 area folded, thereports moved to Delphi.  Now that Delphi's Apple II area is a ghost town,A2Central.com is place to read early reports.Tradition III: Dining Out   It's traditional at KFest to take at least one'''''''''''''''''''''''''   meal at one of two restaurants (or both!)--KCMasterpiece and Jess & Jim's.     This is guaranteed to happen on Saturday night--it's scheduled; it'sin the program.  But it may happen on other nights too.  If you hang out inthe dorm rooms, you're bound to hear of groups heading off to dine.  Ask tobe counted in... and tell me what happens, all the gory details.  Thethought of breaking bread with some of these people intrigues me.A TYPICAL DAY   A KansasFest day doesn't begin when you might it expect it"""""""""""""   to.  It begins right after supper.  The pressing questionof something to eat dealt with, you take the aperitif of your choice--Jolt!cola, Dr Pepper, or Mountain Dew--and wander around the dorms to see who'sdoing what.  Some people will be staying up until _very_ late.  The reasonfor this is that program bugs stay hidden until at least 2 AM, and thereally obscure ones wait until 5 AM.  HackFest participants will attest tothe truth of this.     When morning comes, you may or may not have gotten any sleep.  If youhave, chances are that you didn't get much of it.  The cafeteria staff stopserving breakfast at 8:30, but you may decide that sleep is more importantthan food.  In fact, you may decide that sleep is more important than beingat the first session.  Or the first two sessions.  Or world peace.     Eventually you get out of bed and dither over which of thesimultaneous sessions you want to attend.  You can bring paper or acomputer to take notes, if you wish--no one will laugh or point.  No onewill frown if you don't take notes, either.     All sessions will run over their allotted time.  This is an immutablerule.  The domino theory rapidly comes into play here, which wreaks merryhavoc with the schedule.     After the morning sessions, there's an hour to get some lunch at thecafeteria at Marian Center.  No one takes attendance here, either.     During lunch, the stragglers begin to arrive, and afternoon sessionsmay be more generously attended and received, since pretty much everyone isnow awake and reasonably certain that life is worth living.  The afternoonsessions will officially end at 5:00 or 5:30, but they may last a whilelonger, since no one else is waiting to use the room.  It's possible to getso involved in the final session for the day that you miss the evening mealat the cafeteria.     Or perhaps you've decided to give the cafeteria a miss.  Someonemight be headed to a restaurant for a meal--ask around.  After you'veeaten, well... the cycle begins all over.LEAVING   Avila College hosts events other than KansasFest--in fact,"""""""   Avila's summers are tightly booked.  In previous years, bothRidgway and Carondelet dorms have been available to KFesters, but in recentyeas the organizing committee could only get one.  That should give yousome idea of how hectic things are.     Because Avila is playing host to others after KansasFest is over, besure to check out on time.  This year, you have the option of staying overon Saturday night and checking out on Sunday, but don't push it.  Check-outtime is 11 AM-1 PM Sunday.  Avila wants you out of there by 1 PM on Sundayat the _latest_!     Incidentally, if you're travelling with a limousine service, don'tforget that you must have booked your return trip to the airport at least24 hours in advance.  Since most people leave at much the same time, it maybe possible to cadge a lift to the airport if you've made friends withsomeone heading that way.     This is far from the end.  In fact, it's not even the beginning.  Ifyou've been reading this, it's undoubtedly to prepare for KansasFest, whichmeans it's all still to come!  So have a great time at KansasFest.  And ifyou spot Uncle DOS there, give him my warmest regards.WEB SITES   Here are a few web sites that you may find useful:"""""""""          o  KansasFest, http://www.kfest.org          o  InTrec, http://www.intrec.com          o  A2Central.com: http://www.a2central.com          o  Avila College: http://www.avila.edu          o  Kansas City Airports System: http://www.kcairports.com[EOA][KFR]K FEST REGISTRATION INFORMATION"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KFest 2001 Registration Info... meet old A2 friends... meet new friends...""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Help usher in the new millennium with the Apple II!!When: July 25-29, 2001Where: Avila College, Kansas City, MissouriThe most important Apple II event of the year, KFest 2001, is on ourcalendar again, and it's never too early to make sure it has a place onyour calendar, too.Better yet, KFest is back with the same great prices as last year!Check these rates, which include room and meals from Wednesday evening(dinner) on July 25, through Sunday morning (breakfast) on July 29.(Saturday evening dinner not included.

I'm thinking of bringing 10 each,with perhaps 20 of the IIGS Photo CD-ROM, and perhaps 25 sets of _____.I also plan to bring 3.5" versions of Spectrum, Spectrum Internet Suite,Spectrum Automated Mailer, NiftySpell, Ultima I, Harmonie, Pointless andContacts.If there anything outside of that list that a Kfester might be interestedin getting from me at Kfest, please let me know.The sooner the better, I might add, because I'll be leaving here a good 10to 14 days before the start of Kfest. Joe Kohn Delivered by Spectrum v2.5.2 & SOAR http://users.foxvalley.net/~joko(JOKO, Cat 26, Top 2, Msg 93)[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
