I'm toolazy to use ftp (that requires logging in, typing lots of file names,probably hanging, etc).  I'd rather have something where i can enter thefiles on the gno/orca commandline and be done with it. I'm not worriedabout security since it won't be accessible outside my intranet, andeverything will be copied to/from a dedicated account.So far, tftp and rcp seem to be the best solutions.  tftp is udp-based, sothe client has to do extra housekeeping to verify the packets wereacknowledged (stuff that marinetti does automatically for tcp).  rcp isn'tformally documented anywhere (the uncommented source code is thedocumentation).I'm leaning towards rcp, but before I get started, I was wondering if therewere any other standard protocols that would satisfy my requirements?Thanks,Kelvin(KWS, Cat 57, Top 49, Msg 5)>>>>>"""""I have mixed feelings about rcp.  It would be one of the easier programs toport and was also one of the programs that would have come with thevaporware GS/TCP.On the other hand, there is just about zero demand for its existence due tothe higher awareness of computer security in society today.If you want to write something which can be useful for others too, thereare three options that I can immediately think of:* scp* samba* netatalkscp would need an openssl library for the GS and research would be neededon how CPU intensive it would actually be.samba would also provide support for Windows file sharing.  This is themost versatile since there is an open source option for all modernnon-Windows platforms.netatalk on both the GS and BSD sides would guarantee applesharelogin/access compatibility (the GS uses older protocols which modernsystems no longer support).

I still have the box and the game in thehouse, though I haven't played it in ages.  Archon, for me at least, wasone of the best games I ever played, though it is vastly unappreciated.As an FYI, I did found via Google that there was a MS-DOS version of Archonthat supposedly supported modem play.  I am curious about when Ken wasasking about modem play for the A2 version because as others pointed out,modem's (and modem games) were not in high use in the early 80's.Oh well, good memories all the way around.Keep Up the Good Work!Don=====Donald C.

The rules are the same as always, but follow:KansasFest 2004HackFest Rules1. Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 21, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 24 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.  However, entries may be described or discussed, includingscreen shots (where applicable), by the KFest committee for promotionalpurposes, or by legitimate Apple II community press.The following lists are not necessarily complete lists of everythingallowed; these are to be taken as "givens."  If it's not on the list,please ask for confirmation.Acceptable software:     System software     Development environment (no customizations)     GSBug     Nifty List     Marinetti     Exerciser     ORCA/Debugger, Splat!     DesignMaster, Foundation, Genesys, ResLin     Talking Tools     Spectrum, ProTERM, ANSITermAcceptable hardware:     Apple II computer, monitor, disk drives, hard drives     CD-ROM drive, tape drive     Hard disk controller card     Sound card (speakers/headphones/etc)     Accelerator card (any speed)     RAM cardAccepted reference material:     All official Apple reference materials (including     manuals, technical notes, and file type notes).     Reference manuals included with development tools     and software.     Commercially-available reference manuals.Any other hardware, software, or reference material needs the approvalof the judges in advance.  When in doubt, ask the judges.(Eric Shepherd, Owner, Syndicomm: http://www.syndicomm.com)(Via KFest Mailing List)[EOA][CNT]Cheesey Announcement""""""""""""""""""""I'm very happy to announce that Tony Diaz will be taking over the BigCheese duties for KFest.
