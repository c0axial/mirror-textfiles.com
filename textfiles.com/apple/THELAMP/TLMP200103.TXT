Instinctwas telling them it was time to get ready for the nesting season.  Thisreminded me of an experience many years ago Back On The Farm.     During the summer, at age 5, my pet gosling, Herman, had grown to bean adult goose under my care.     I told my father that I wanted to raise geese.  He said, "Hmm... weare going to have to get a _male_ goose".  Herman was going to be a mother!     The next Spring we bought a gander from one of the neighbors.  I wastold that in order to raise more geese I should take the eggs from thegeese until we had enough to fit under one of the "setting" chicken hens.Herman would then keep producing eggs until she had enough for her toincubate.  I would have twice as many geese.     Each morning I was to feed the geese, then remove the egg from theirnest while they were eating.  Each day one of the geese would notice andgrab my seat with its bill, slapping me with its wings.  I would run asfast as I could, being careful not to break the egg.  At some point, whenthe goose decided I was far enough away from the nest, it would let go.     So raising geese was not exactly what I expected.  Many things we doin life are that way.     Serving as editor of _The Lamp!_ has been a lot of fun.  But it hasnot always been like I expected.     So go ahead and try something new.  There may be surprises along theway.  You just might find something that you really enjoy.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA]------------------------------------  DISTILLATIONS FROM A2Central.com |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[RFW]REWARDS FOR WRITING ARTICLES FOR A2Central.com WEB SITE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""In an effort to encourage more Apple II users to contribute articles to ourweb site, A2Central.com will now begin offering free months of service inexchange for articles we deem to be of good quality that exceed 1,500words.

High school had keyboarding as one class,applications (word processing, spreadsheet, and database) as another.I was bored in applications and took the final after two weeks.  Got a 97%,but since I hadn't actually taken the course, I received no credit.  Noneof these classes were inspiring.I've had an Apple II as long as I can remember.  BASIC was very easy tolearn, and a necessity when I decided to run a BBS using Warp Six, whichwas in BASIC.  I learned from looking at the code, talking to other sysops(Scott Johnson), and reading books.  Oh, and making mistakes. :)I had a blast for years.  That and video games (I was [am!] a Nintendo nut)are what prompted me to apply to WPI and major in computer science.  Butwhen modern computers and languages didn't offer the same fun factor myIIgs did, I switched majors.Of course, that's just me.  There are obviously many more people who foundin the computer science dept. what I found on my Apple II.I recently tried to convince the head of the CS dept. of this in an attemptto get school credit for "Learn to Program Your IIgs in GSoft BASIC".  Nodice.-Ken(KGAGNE, Cat 2, Top 33, Msg 3)>>>>>"""""I'll agree with Sheppy.  A CS program at a college is about computerSCIENCE.  Theory, logic, Push-down automata, regular expressions,context-free grammars and all that good stuff.  Analyze the best, average,and worst (Theta, Big-O, Omega) cases for algorithms I-IV. Etc, etc. etc.Proficiency in PROGRAMMING comes from practice.  I personally like theSCIENCE part.  The theory.  And _that_ is where college/graduate schoolcome in for me.  There are stories abounding about programmers who, say,learned the pitfalls and quirks of the WIN32 API.  They've said themselvesthat while their coding methodology when south, their careers wereenormously successful.  So computer SCIENCE skills were laid aside in favorof PROGRAMMING skill. (from a Dr. Dobbs article)There are no real great people in the computer industry which do not possesboth PROGRAMMING and SCIENCE skills.  A quick example: Michael Abrash &John Carmak.  These guys are great PROGRAMMERS and they've got the SCIENCEside figured out pretty well, too.-Lucas(LSCHAREN, Cat 2, Top 33, Msg 4)>>>>>"""""> I've often wondered what makes a good programmer, one who is both skilled> and happy in the work.I don't know that I can lay claim to being a good, or skilled programmer,but I do like doing it...> At what age does the obsession with computers tend to take hold?For me it was as soon as I was exposed to them. I think it would have been1974 in my first year of high school, lining up to buy Miniwaft cards.(Miniwaft ran under Fortran, and used cards that you punched out with anunbent paper clip. The cards were taken away once a week to a Universityand the printouts brought back.)Everyone had to buy the cards, but others would buy 1 pack at a time, andI'd buy 20...A year later our school (a very progressive one at the time) got a dumbterminal, connected via modem to a Dec PDP 10 at the university. At thetime this machine could support a total of 50 users, supplying the needs ofthe entire university and any external modem users throughout the wholestate.Don't think I ever saw more than 35 users online at once though :)A teacher introduced us to the computer and to BASIC. Wow, you didn't haveto wait a week and look at the printouts, stuff happened on a screen! I washooked, but surprisingly there were really only three of us out of the 1500students at the High School who were constantly in that little room downthe end of the upper veranda.Creativity is a good thing to have as a programmer. You have to be able toget the idea of what you want to create, if you are going to make anythingspecial. I'm glad to hear others state that doing study wasn't what it wasall about, since I missed out on that. :) I do think I miss out sometimesby not having studied some of the classic algorithms.

For people that I know are online (A2Central.com membershipfees, auction payments) I use PayPal.  For product sales, I use Kagi.> In a nutshell, which do you prefer? And, which one has the lowest fee?Both have their advantages, as I said above.  PayPal does not collect feesfrom you at all, unless you have a business account (which is required ifyou process more than a certain number of dollars in payments per month).Syndicomm has a business account, which costs us 25 cents plus 1.9% pertransaction, or something like that.  Much cheaper than Kagi, but as I saidbefore, there are some limitations as well, which is why we still use both.IMHO, Joe, Kagi is probably best for you just because you do take ordersfrom people that aren't online (although they have no way to do so that Iknow of, since you don't have any printed ads distributed anywhere).Since I have ads in most Juiced.GS issues, I get some snail mail ordersfrom people sent to Kagi, so that works real well for me.Sheppy(SYNDICOMM, Cat 3, Top 2, Msg 4)>>>>>"""""For the casual buy/sell person, the personal version of PayPal absolutelymakes sense.

As soon asI received notification from PayPal I send the item.  Cuts the wait timefor the customer up to in half.For Joe, you have some small ticket items that aren't worth putting up onKagi.  PayPal is ideal for these situations.  Say I notice that SSII sellsDragon Wars and Neuromancer for $15 (such a deal!).  For me (in Canada) toremember to go to the bank and get a US money order is a pain.  WithPayPal, on an impulse, I can send you my $15 from my credit card and youcan ship it immediately.

This last bit of info makes thiscommand very powerful when used with boolean expressions.For example, you can simulate a simple IF/THEN/ELSE statement:ON X=10 GOTO 100: home: print a$This reads like this:IF X=10 then GOTO 100ELSE  HOME  PRINT A$Any boolean expression will work; even string expressions:ON A$="H" GOTO 100I most use ON GOTO/GOSUB to pack line numbers to save space and time.  Eachline number takes 5 bytes of overheard (actually saves only 4 bytes if youcould the ":" needed to separate the numbers), and each line saved executesGOTO's faster.Example:10 if x=2 then 10020 if x=10 then 20030 homeWould look like this: (saves 8 bytes)10 ON X=2 GOTO 10: ON X=10 GOTO 200: HOMEMany would consider the above line harder to read, but in a large problemwhere every bytes counts, you can often saved hundreds of bytes with thistechnique; Silvern Castle uses this trick extensively.One more example:10 if flag then gosub 100: rem assume flag is either 0 or 120 homeRewritten:10 ON FLAG GOSUB 100: HOMEJeff Fink(FINKSTERJ, Cat 51, Top 15, Msg 14)[EOA][TLL]THE LISP LANGUAGE"""""""""""""""""LISP is an excellent object-oriented language.

As wenotified you last year, these services have been unsupported since November1, and billing for premium services was discontinued.As of May 1, Delphi email will be inaccessible, and email forwarding willno longer function. Also, those Web forums that have opted to revert to thelegacy chat service will need to use the newer version of Delphi.com chat.The new chat system does not support live games, and some of thefunctionality of the legacy chat system has not yet been developed for thenewer version of chat.We hope that this notice and the one we sent you last fall will give youenough time to make alternate arrangements.Q & A -(Q) Why is Delphi making these changes?(A) The text-based services, legacy chat and email services are all basedon a technical platform that cannot be maintained on a cost-effectivebasis.(Q) How do I know if my email account is affected?(A) If your email address ends in "@delphi.com" you will need to makealternate arrangements. Most Internet service providers supply emailaccounts. There are also several free web-based email providers such asHotmail (http://www.hotmail.com), Yahoo (http://mail.yahoo.com). You shouldnotify anyone who sends you email of your new address as soon as possible.(Q) I've already set up forwarding for my Delphi email account. Isn't thatsufficient?(A) No. The systems that are being retired include the forwardingfunctionality, so mail sent to your "@delphi.com" address will bounce backto the sender after May 1.(Q) I use the text-based games such as TQ and Scramble on the Web, willthese be discontinued?(A) Since these live games are based on the old platform, they will bediscontinued.(Q) I run a forum on the Delphi.com Web site and I still use the old chatsystem. What do I have to do?(A) You can change your chat selection to the new chat system from yourforum control center at any time. If you do not do so by May 1, we willtake care of it for you.(Q) I participate in role playing games that rely on certain functions ofthe legacy chat system like the "/act" and "/roll" commands. Will these beavailable in the new chat system?(A) We may be adding those features to the new chat system, but it is notlikely that those functions will be available in new chat before the oldchat system is retired on May 1.We have established a mutual assistance Forum on Delphi Text Side.
