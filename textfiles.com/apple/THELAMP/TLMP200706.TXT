This allows a time stampon saved files... a record of which of two or more apparently identicalfiles is the most recent version... a way to time stamp outgoing email withthe time it was sent.     Keeping track of time has been a challenge to mankind for a long time.There have been sundials and a multitude of clocks.  One of the more recentinnovations for consumer clocks is the "radio controlled" clock.  They setthemselves to the correct time by referring to radio station WWVB (FortCollins, Colorado) which refers to the NIST Atomic Clock in Boulder,Colorado.     Wouldn't it be nifty if someone were to build a clock for the Apple IIcomputers using the same technology?

Since the changeover to me(Sean Fahey), nothing has been done with it until now.Effective today and for as long as I operate A2Central, I'm pledging ALLnet income collected through our Cafepress store to charity. For now, thatcharity will be St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis TN, USA.All patients accepted for treatment at St. Jude are treated without regardto the family's ability to pay, and is frequently the last hope forchildren fighting cancer and other catastrophic diseases.We hope you'll consider purchasing our fashionable Apple II geek-wares, andhelp support this worthy cause.http://www.cafepress.com/a2centralWe're also looking for interesting new graphics and slogans worthy of theApple II and A2Central to broaden our Cafepress offerings. Do you haveoriginal artwork or a slogan that you'd like to donate to A2Central'scharity projects?  Send your material to sfahey@a2central.com. Thank youvery much.(sfahey, a2c.portal_news, May 16 2007)[EOA][PFE]Postcards With Four Edges"""""""""""""""""""""""""Imagine my surprise today when I opened the mailbox to see a postcard withmy picture on it on the top of the pile of mail.  My first thought I was avictim of a kidnapping and I quickly turned the card over to look for thereward (if I show up, I could say "I found myself" and one wouldn't have tobelieve in any of those nonsensical things called religion).  But no, itwas just a KFest advertisement.  It would have been pretty funny if theadvertising would have stated on the front: Missing Person Alert.
