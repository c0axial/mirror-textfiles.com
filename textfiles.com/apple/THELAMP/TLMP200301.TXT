Right on time, the Grande Barton Theater Organ begins playing asthe console begins rising to its place at the right, front corner of thestage.  The organist, dressed in a bright red coat and a master at histrade, commands the great instrument with enthusiasm... his hands dancingin quick succession across the keys, adjusting the stops on the go... hisfeet moving from pedal to pedal to sound the low notes.     Consider what this old organ has in common with the Apple II... bothare well built classics that still do their job.  Both are enthusiasticallyoperated by people who enjoy them for what they can do and how they do it.     All too soon, to the strains of Auld Lang Syne, the console of theorgan slowly sinks into its cubical below the stage.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[ATF]Apple II Forever SONG"""""""""""""""""""""Check out this link:http://techupdate.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t481-s2127406,00.htmlYou can read the words, and if you download the MP3, listen to the "AppleII Forever" song!

I would very much like to convert eachpartition to a .2MG file and transfer it over to another machine -- be itPC or Mac for emulation purposes (there is only a PC at my house andI don't own a PowerBook, so PC would be better for the transfer).How can I convert the ProDOS partitions into 2MGs, and how do I get themoff relatively quickly?Also, is it possible to build a .2MG out of the HFS partition? Has anyoneelse done this?And finally, I would LOVE to make .2MGs of my floppies (games inparticular). How would I do this -- and can I make 2MGs from copy-protectedgames?Thank you so much in advance. I'm so happy to see that people still areusing their IIs.Colin(TOKYOCOLIN, 3618.1, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>"""""I've done exactly what you're looking to do and have a perfect backup (in'2MG' format) on my PC's hardrive. I use it with KEGS32 to have a virtualcopy of my Apple IIgs on my Pentium III.What you'll need is the following:1) A large HFS partition (with +32MB free)2) A copy of Asimov v2.03) A copy of Spectrum4) Mac serial cable5) PC serial cable6) Null-modem adapter7) HyperTerminal (or similar) on the PC sideFirst you want to use Asimov to make '2MG' images out of each of your 32MBProDOS partitions. The actual image files will be 32768K (32 megabytes)which are too large for ProDOS to store, so this is where the HFS partitioncomes in handy. Write them to the HFS partition, one at a time if your HFSpartition is small (hopefully you have at least 32MB or more free; if not,clean up some space). Next you need to move the files off the GS and ontoyour PC. Link up a null-modem connection between the two serial ports oneach machine--you can set up each side to 57600 bps, or try 19200 if yourGS isn't accelerated.You need Spectrum (a GS/OS terminal program) to read and send the files offthe HFS partition. On the PC side you can use HyperTerminal which isincluded with Windows to receive. Even at 57600 bps this will be EXTREMELYSLOW, so you'll probably want to do the transfer(s) over night. If you havea Zip drive and SCSI on each machine, you could skip the serial porttransfer, I'm sure there's a PC utility for reading HFS (I could use thatmyself).Asimov you can download from www.ninjaforce.comSpectrum I _think_ Joe Kohn is or was carrying. I'm not even sure at thispoint, there is probably less than 0.01% Apple II software still on thecommercial market at this point.If you have GSTape and access to a SCSI tape drive, you can backup yourhardisk partitions too. I've done this myself since I was given a free 2GB,4GB and 250MB tape drives. It was a LOT more difficult tracking down GSTapethough. It's great, between the 2MG images (which I plan to burn to CD soonso my IIgs has offline copies it can access directly) and the tape backup,I don't even worry about my hardisk anymore. And yes...it actually wasfailing at one point. :)Mitchell Spector(SPECTOR1, 3618.4, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>"""""Mitchell,Thanks a lot!

For  something  like  that, you'd probably have tofigure  out  how to crack the copy protection first, and make a usablebackup  that  could  then be converted.

This requirement is easy to fulfill... simplyturn on the power to your HD and wait a few seconds or so before turning onthe power to the computer.But it would be nice if you could throw the switch on the power bar to theon position and go get the newspaper while your Apple II boots up byitself.What You Will Need''''''''''''''''''1. Apple II with hard drive.2. 5.25" floppy drive.  (Could be done with a 3.5" floppy drive.)Where to Get What You Need''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Thrift stores.2. Garage sales.3. Usenet... comp.sys.apple2.marketplace4. A2 on Syndicomm5. LEM-Swap list <http://lowendmac.com/lists/swap.html>6. Alltech Electronics <http://www.allelec.com/indexa2.html">8. Other World Computer <http://www.macsales.com/">9. A2Central.com (System disks, if needed)Procedure'''''''''1. Prepare the startup disk.    a. Format a floppy disk.  (ProDOS)    b. Copy ProDOS to the disk.  (If copying from System 6.0.1 on the IIgs       copy the file P8 and rename the file ProDOS.)    c. Copy BASIC.System to the floppy.    d. Boot the disk (runs BASIC) and write this BASIC program:        1) At 1st BASIC prompt type   NEW        2) At 2nd BASIC prompt type   10: PR#X           (where X is the number of the slot where you HD is located)        3) At 3rd BASIC prompt type   SAVE STARTUP        4) Quit BASIC2. Keep the prepared floppy in the appropriate drive and set up your   computer to boot from that drive.3. Leave power switches of your Apple II and hard drive in the on position   and plug them into a power bar.When you turn on the power bar the floppy will boot and automatically run aprogram called STARTUP which will in turn boot your hard drive.  Your HDwill have spun up by the time it is called on to boot.This setup does have a disadvantage you might consider... if you need towarm boot your computer there will be a short delay... the floppy will bootand in turn the HD will boot.[EOA]YOU ARE INVITED"""""""""""""""You are invited to submit your favorite Tinkerer's Project for the Apple IIcomputers.Send your write up or idea to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]------------------------------                       KFest 2003 |-----------------------------------[PBT]KFest 2003 - PLAN TO BE THERE!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KansasFest 2003 is planned for July 22-27, 2003 at Avila University inKansas City, Missouri.(Entrance banner, Cat 5, Top 5)[EOA][VKF]FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THE KFest HOME PAGE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KFest Home Pagehttp://www.kfest.org/[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
