Some people will go out of their way to avoid paying thesmall fee for using the toll bridge.                             A New Fairy Tale                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Once upon a time there was a land called Information.  This land wason an island.  Access was by way of a toll bridge.     After paying the modest toll you could talk to the other visitors.You could post questions and comments in the forum.  You could bring homewith you chunks of wisdom others had left.  And people were happy withtheir visits to this land called Information.     Then one day the people who lived in Information announced that theywere building another bridge... using this bridge would be free!  Thosecoming by way of the toll bridge would have a few more privileges... butusing this new bridge would be _free_.     There were many curves and intersections on this new bridge.  Therewere signs and billboards on the left, on the right, and overhead.  Some ofthe signs had flashing lights.  There were even great signs that hung overthe road like a curtain... you had to locate and push a button on thosecurtain signs to get them out of your way!     There were people who still preferred to come by way of the tollbridge.  Traffic moved quickly.  They could take care of their business andgo home.     Then one day the people who ran this land called Information announcedthat no new customers would be allowed on the toll bridge.     Then tolls would no longer be collected... but no more money would bespent maintaining that bridge.     Then... you can no longer talk to the people while on Information ifthey came by way of the free bridge.     Then a date was announced when the old bridge would be closedcompletely.                                A New Land                                ~~~~~~~~~~     Syndicomm.com provides "a new land" where people can talk and exchangeinformation.

(double density)I've always been of the belief that while they *appear* to formatsuccessfully and store data just fine initially, that data *will* degradequickly over time leaving them unsafe for permanent storage.Recently, I find myself beginning to question that. Last night I dug up acouple of HD disks I formatted as 800K years ago and they not only containall the data and read fine still, doing a surface and file by fileverification report they're 100% intact. And I created these disks over_7 years_ ago!Is the magnetic coating on the surface of HD disks truly any different fromDD disks?As it stands I have several hundred 1.44MB floppies on hand, but only adozen or os blank 800/720K disks. I'm tempted to use them at this point,but wondering what other people's experiences have been...Mitchell Spectora_specto@alcor.concordia.ca(SPECTOR1, 3414.1, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>"""""I think your luck with using HD floppies as 800k will depend a lot on yourparticular floppy drive and the brand or batch of floppies. Years ago Iused them on my own system and had pretty good luck. Then I became our UserGroups IIgs PD software librarian. (that is Public Domain, not PiratedDisk:-) When people wanted a copy of something they would bring their owndisk, often a HD one and we would make a copy on whichever IIgs was handy.I noticed that almost all the disks that became unreadable later were HDand disks copied on some machines seemed to have a much higher failure ratethan others. Also some batches of HD disks were much worse than others.Overall the failure rate wasn't all that high but would be a cause forconcern if the data was particularly valuable. We did have one spectacularand amusing failure though. One fellow stated that HD and DD disks were thesame except for the hole and copied a dozen disks from our library. Nextday he phoned me and said they all died within 24 hours and he only managedto copy half or them before they became unreadable. Of course that isn't atypical situation. I generally suggest formatting only DD disks as 800k ifat all possible. However if you are stuck you use what you have available.In which case if the data is important make a couple or more copies.Wayne(WAYNEJ, 3414.3, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>"""""I'm converted.Prior to purchasing some DD floppies from Howard, I had asked the samequestion here, but not before trying some brand-new HD disks first. I triedthem on various Apple 3.5 drives that I had, but the outcome was thatreliability was poor. Some disks failed straight away, others lasted 1night, some have lasted months, and some have not failed yet (and may not).The HD disks I used were all the same cheap un-branded type, possibly notthat good anyway, but they do work on the Mac as HD quite OK.Bottom line is, if you have a backup on CD or other medium then it doesn'tmatter what your using, HD or DD. But I would use DD for data I've createdand HD for application disks (if I didn't have any DD's left).Mark(LUKE65816, 3414.5, Delphi A2 web side)[EOA][PRD]PRESERVING REMAINS OF DELPHI A2 FORUM"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""With the text-side all but gone (just a little over a month remains beforeit ceases to exist) and activity on the webside having dropped to near-zeroactivity as of late, it's become apparent Delphi's A2 Forum is now on itsdeath bed.That has me wondering, has, or is anyone planning to, archive and preservethe A2 message forums here on Delphi?
