You donot need to change the slot to 'Your Card' to use it as a stereo card.  Ifyou want to use the recording capability, you must set the slot to 'YourCard' while recording.>> It has a plug that I suppose goes to the connector to the right of thesound chip, but the plug seems to have two rows of 7  connections, whilethe connector on the MB has only one row of 7 pins. <<You connect one of the double row of seven to the single row of seven onthe MB.  It should be possible to do this only with one of the rows and notthe other, due to the connector configuration.  The extra row of sevenshould end up hanging out on the power supply side of the MB connector.>> Also, there is another cable with a set of 3 jacks on it. I would assumethat two of the jacks are for up to 4 speakers, but I cant be sure.. whatwould the 3rd jack be for? <<Good guess, but not quite correct.  The three jacks should be two closetogether and one farther apart from them.  The one by itself is for amicrophone or line level input.  The one of the pair that is farthest fromthe input jack is the high level output jack, for connecting directly tospeakers.  The middle jack is the line level output jack for connecting toother external equipment, such as powered speakers or a stereo system.>> is there any software or drivers for it I should try to find? <<There are an Init and a CDEV, which allow you to control the volume andselect between microphone and line level input.

These   reproductions will be offered in PDF format on CD-ROM in the coming   months as reproduction is completed.   Nibble magazine was one of the most successful programming magazines for   the Apple II. Its clear concise program listings that were carried in   each issue taught many programmers of the era new and better ways to   accomplish programming tasks through its innovative programs and   programming tips.   The magazines will be offered in a complete set of CDs containing all 12   years of the magazine and the books will also be offered on individual   CDs for each book that is reproduced.   A.P.P.L.E. is producing this collection in conjunction with Mike Harvey   in order to further its goal of preserving materials from the Apple   computing world of the 1970s through 1990s.   Mike Harvey was the founder and publisher of Nibble Magazine from 1980   through 1992.  In 1980, he wrote the first 4 issues of the magazine   himself in order to get it started. At its peak, Nibble had a monthly   circulation of nearly 100,000.   The CDs will be made available to the general public later this spring   exclusively through the A.P.P.L.E. online product catalog at   http://www.callapple.org/cat.   About A.P.P.L.E.   A.P.P.L.E. is an all-volunteer users group that supports members in the   Apple II, Macintosh and iMac communities.

An informal   A.P.P.L.E. group also existed between 1990 and 2001. A.P.P.L.E. was once   again established as an online users group in 2002.

He's also going to be including,where we can find them for him, the monthly disks for the issues that hadthem, in .DSK format.

Living here in the corn and soybean fields, we don't see too manyinternet devices.  In fact, I've seen none since that fine KFestpresentation.I know I asked this question at KFest 02, but would appreciate an update.What has happened to internet devices?  In particular, I'm interested inthe internet radio thing which was pretty cool as stations from all overthe world could be heard with an internet connection.A few years ago, while working in Omaha, I enjoyed listening to radiostations in Australia using a silly WinDoze box.  One of the DJs inMelbourne rang me one morning; I was interviewed for about ten minutes.I'm sure you all caught that highlight of internet radio history...What has happened to internet radio?  Is it still going strong or has thefad waned?  At the University I had software installed on a Mac which wouldselect all streaming radio stations and display them by category, nation,etc.  That was way cool.What internet devices are still available for sale, or will I need to lookon eBay for such an item?  Will these still work with the current state ofthe internet?  Are there more or fewer streaming radio broadcasts now dueto intellectual property restrictions?  How, exactly, does one protectone's intellectual property once it's on the internet?FWIW, our own Nebraska Public Radio Network, is streaming on the web.  Lookfor/listen to this outstanding site athttp://net.unl.eduFinally, as I can view full screen video output running Allison software orlisten to "streaming audio" using OverSampler software on an Apple ][gs,how difficult would it be to create an Apple ][gs internet radio device?I hope it will be a part of Spectrum soon...Thanks in advance for your comments regarding internet devices.Greg(GREGN, Cat 2, Top 31, Msg 34)>>>>>"""""It is still going strong, and can be heard on any computer capable ofrunning QuickTime Player, Windows Media Player or Real Audio player.

It is also certainly not fast enough to allow internet radiothrough interpreted scripts in Spectrum.Of course I would love for someone to prove me wrong and release a playerfor the IIgs.

Please invite your educator friends tocheck out the website and become involved.http://reach.ucf.edu/~cpaw        CPAW ... provides opportunities for people in        educational and community institutions to share        their experiences, ideas and knowledge in a variety        of collaborative learning environments to enhance        global understanding...As an Apple ][ user, I was asked to become involved with CPAW back in 1988.My wife and I coordinated the Video Letters Project, in which our juniorhigh school aged students wrote and produced videos for their counterpartsin Australia and New Zealand.  We spent three months touring there,visiting 29 schools in 59 days, on sabbatical from our local schooldistrict.   My wife and I presented the Video Letters Project at the 1989CPAW Conference in Portland.During the following year, I assembled the Video Letters Project LessonPlans, handouts, introductory letters and dozens of screen shots from thevideotapes, sent them off to Ed Floden in Illinois who organized all of thefiles and folders onto a ProDOS CD-ROM called Generous Efforts of Many.This was in early 1990.In July of 1990, the GEM CD-ROM caused quite a stir among those who saw mypresentation at the CPAW conference in Cairns, Qld, Australia.  Thanks tothe local Apple dealer, I was able to use an Apple ][gs with a CD-ROM driveto demonstrate parts of GEM (including Video Letters Project) to theassembled crowd.After that, more than a few people became excited about getting their Applecomputers into educational projects for students.  While there were 41individual contributors to GEM; few of us remain active in the Apple ][community.  Today, only a handful of CPAW executives use Apple computers:that would be me.You, too, can still achieve great things in education with your Apple ][computer.

"Why", many of you may bethinking, shaking your collective heads, "would anyone in his right mindspend the time necessary to create an index that virtually NO ONE will everwant to use???" Darn good question, that. To give an answer, let me takeyou back to those golden days, the days when the Apple II was still goingstrong, both GEnie and America Online were king in the world of onlineApple II activity, and an Atari fan named John Peters decided to start apublishing innovation. But just before that, let me give you somebackground that explains my decision to create a Lamp index, which itselfultimately led to this writing).IF YOU LEAVE ME NOWSome of you may know that it has been quite a while since I have hadanything to write for submission to this publication, and that only in itsprevious incarnation, as GEnieLamp. From 1992 through 1994, my Apple IIHistory (minus the Appendices) was serialized in GEnieLamp, as it was inmany user group newsletters at the time ran. After Doug Cuff began aseditor, I also contributed for approximately one year a series of articlesfor the Beginner's Corner column, called "Polishing Green Apples". When thefinal edition of that column and of the Apple II History reprint ran, I wasgetting burnt out on writing about the Apple II, and decided to take abreak from it. Not only had I been writing those articles for GEnieLamp,but also I had been contributing news from a summarization of online postsfrom GEnie. This collection was similar to the old "Hey Mister Postman" and"A Funny Thing Happened" columns from the Lamp publications, and the workthat Lyle does today in producing The Lamp! I had done this news work forseveral years, first for my local user group newsletter, and later as acontribution to the final issues of A2-Central (on disk).Also at this time I was in the process of getting up to speed in the brandnew world of the Personal Digital Assistant or PDA (a phrase coined byApple Computer CEO John Sculley), specifically with my Newton MessagePad110. The one problem with that device, as with many advances in the worldof computers in the early 1990's onward, was a LACK of Apple IIconnectivity for anything beyond simple text file transfer. My regular useof this Newton, then, required use of our family Macintosh LC III. That,plus a nearly catastrophic loss of a great deal of my Apple II files withthe crash of my 240 meg IIGS hard drive (and a backup that only partly wasintact) took the wind out of my Apple II enthusiasm for several years. As aresult, I faded away from the Apple II world for quite a while, leaving itto whatever fate had in store for it.WORKING MY WAY BACK TO YOUThe presence of the Apple II History on the new World Wide Web, from 1994onward, kept me peripherally involved in it. I would occasionally get thee-mail question from someone, or have an error pointed out that needed tobe corrected. And with time I gradually regained the interest in making theHistory accurate again; some of it had become outdated with the passage oftime, and that just became a bother that I could no longer accept. Irejoined the band again in June of last year with my participation in theA2Central.com (Syndicomm) forums, themselves an accurate re-creation ofGEnie in its heyday. I realized that I needed to learn details about whathappened in the Apple II world between 1994 and 2002 in order to 1) lookless stupid, and 2) find out about the final fates of GEnie, II Alivemagazine, Softdisk G-S, and others in the time I had been away. What couldI read to learn about these events in sufficient detail to allow me toupdate the Apple II History correctly? Why, those archives of GEnieLamp A2,GenieLamp A2, and The Lamp!, so carefully preserved over the years.I'VE BEEN SEARCHING SO LONGAnd so, I began to read those newsletters closely enough so that I wouldnot only learn exactly what happened, but also be able to communicate it tothose who may have forgotten, or (like me) never experienced the details ofthe past eight years. Doing this review by creating an index along the waywould allow me to pay close attention and to not skip over important parts.It would also help me to find specific bits of information regarding datesand people and programs and companies, details that was just crying out fororganization. And now that brings me back to the purpose of what I amwriting here, and to let you know just what a treasure these newsletterstruly are.In the November 1996 issue of GEnieLamp, editor Doug Cuff wrote "GEnieLampHistory: Where We've Been". I don't intend to simply copy his work here,but to expand on it, and bring the story forward to the present, as well ascomment on the Lamp series as a whole.ONLY THE BEGINNINGIn 1990, John Peters, an Atari ST user living in Denver, Colorado, startedan online magazine called TeleTalk Online. It was targeted towards BBSSysops and the members of their boards. He uploaded that first issue to acouple of BBS's that were local to him, and from there it went nationwide,migrating from BBS to BBS. After three issues, Peters found that he wasreceiving e-mail about TeleTalk Online from all over the country. He signedup with PC Pursuit (a GTE service started in 1985 that offered unlimitednon-primetime connections to online databases, bulletin boards, regionalnetworks, and personal computers in the several large metropolitan areas)which then made it possible for him to access BBS's located in manydifferent parts of the United States. With this ability of personally"delivering" his digital magazine, its rapid growth continued.With the experience gained from this foray into digital publishing, Peterswrote the Chief Sysop for the GEnie's Atari Roundtables, asking if therewas any interest in a TeleTalk-type of magazine. CompuServe already had amagazine called "ST Report", and GEnie was interested in something tocompete with it. As a result, GEnieLamp ST, the first GEnieLamppublication, started in June 1990. It became a popular download amongst themembers of that Roundtable, and as time passed, it caught the eye of KentFillmore, who was a program manager for GEnie. Fillmore asked Peters if hewould be interested in expanding the GEnieLamp concept to some otherplatforms. Peters accepted the challenge, sought and found assistants fromselected Roundtables to act as co-editors, and on April 1, 1992 threeadditional GEnieLamp magazines appeared, for the Macintosh, IBM, and AppleII platforms.COME AND GET ITOver the next several years, additional editions of the GEnieLamp magazinesappeared, and then gradually faded away. Interestingly, the Apple IIedition did NOT fade away, and even gained in strength. In Doug Cuff's 1996article about the history of GEnieLamp A2, he summarized the start and enddates for the various GEnieLamp publications.

Aug 1994GEnieLamp MacPRO      Dec 1992     Feb 1993The only corrections that I needed to make were for the start dates for theA2, IBM, and Mac editions, and the end date for the A2 version (which hadnot yet happened at the time Doug's article appeared). Doug's original listidentified the start dates for the flagship GEnieLamp publications as Feb1992; unless this referred to some test or beta editions of the GEnieLampmagazine that appeared two months before the official start, I believethose dates should be Apr 1992, since the April 1992 issue of GEnieLamp A2identifies itself as Volume 1, Issue 1.I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG, LONG TIMEWell, it probably won't be THAT long, but beginning with the nextinstallment of this article, I plan to give a year by year BRIEF (I hope)summarization of the stories covered by the Lamp publications during theircombined run of over ten years.To conclude this introductory article, let me comment on the GEnieLamp A2 /The Lamp! phenomenon. I'm not sure exactly what it is about Apple II users,hanging on to this classic platform as long as they have, but it is totheir credit that they have also worked so hard to preserve these classicpublications. I've done an online search of the Web using Google, and asidefrom a site that has many different types of newsletters, and which has thefirst issue of GEnieLamp IBM, it would appear the that only survivingGEnieLamp publications that can be found intact on the Web are the A2 andA2Pro editions! A preliminary search of GoogleGroups (which has newsgrouparchives dating back many years) also finds many hits for GEnieLamp A2, andthe MENTION of the IBM, Atari ST, and PowerPC editions, but no currentlyactive links for downloading any of them. Apparently no one else has thusfar felt that the other GEnieLamps were worth the effort to preserve forposterity (although undoubtedly they do exist somewhere). For this we haveto thank Ryan Suenaga for making sure there was a central, consistentlyavailable web site to post them. More importantly than that, we haveeditors Doug Cuff and Ryan and now Lyle Syverson to thank for theirtireless efforts in continuing to produce the Lamp publications long afterthere was any kind of monetary compensation offered to do so. They chose todo it out of loyalty to the readers, and love for the Apple II computeritself. For this, I for one tip my hat and offer my sincere thanks to theselong-suffering editors, as well as the many contributors over the yearsthat have made the Lamp publications a treasury of both useful informationand interesting trivia.FEELING STRONGER EVERY DAYI know that there are other periodicals that appeared and (most)disappeared during the years that the Lamps have been in production, andthey also contain unique and useful information (GS+ Magazine, Juiced.GS,and a number of smaller, less widely distributed newsletters). But the Lampshines above them in ease of use and accessibility (after all, can you readNibble, inCider, or Shareware Solutions II on your computer, or on yourPDA??), much like the Apple II can exceed any GUI computer in speed (if notfeatures) when it comes to raw text processing. It spans the end of the erain which Apple Computer made some efforts (however reluctantly) to continuesupporting and enhancing the platform, up through the present where we haveto support ourselves entirely.The persistence of the Lamps parallels the persistence of the Apple IIitself. In spite of Apple Computer's decision to move on to bigger andbetter things, we the users are stubbornly going to MAKE "Apple II Forever"happen, come what may.NEXT TIME: A review of GEnieLamp's birth and infancy.

While verysimilar in terms of look-and-feel to the old design, the new siteadds easy access to the Apple II forum on Syndicomm Online, and isdesigned to be easier to navigate, as well as easier forA2Central.com staff to update and maintain."The old site was, frankly, a pain in the neck to keep up-to-date,"said Eric Shepherd, editor of A2Central.com.  "It got to the pointwhere it was so much work just to add a single new story that wedreaded new Apple II news."  Shepherd added with a smile, "And that'sjust not right."There remains work to be done on the new site.  All previous contentis still available although some graphics are missing.  The entiresite will be transitioned to the new design over the coming weeks.A2Central.com is the web site for the Apple II forum on the SyndicommOnline service, with free news, reviews, and feature articles.A2Central.com also provides access to the Apple II developertechnical support services provided by Syndicomm on Apple's behalf.A2Central.com is operated by Syndicomm.ABOUT SYNDICOMMSyndicomm provides Syndicomm Online, a new online service for thebest of us.  Syndicomm Online is available using both the World WideWeb and telnet software.  In addition, Syndicomm publishes anddistributes software for classic computers and publishes Juiced.GS,the only remaining print magazine for Apple II computer users andenthusiasts.

Backing up your data is more convenient.  You are more likely to keep upwith your backups if it is more convenient to do so.2. Accidently delete a file you intended to keep?  You have another copy onyour backup hard drive.3. Your primary hard drive suddenly quit working?  Boot from your backuphard drive and you are still in business.  (Be sure to replace your brokendown drive promptly so you will still have a backup.)What You Will Need''''''''''''''''''1. Your Apple II with the original hard drive.2.

Prepare the 'new' hard drive, partitioning to the same size partitionsas the old drive.  Refer to The Tinkerer's Corner in previous issues of_The Lamp!_ for information on setting up hard drives. (Aug 2000 for SCSIdrives / Oct 2002 for Focus drives). If setting up two hard drives at thesame time, consider standardizing ProDOS partitions at 32MB.2. Connect the 'new' drive to the computer.   a. Two drives from one SCSI card.  The drive with the higher SCSI id is      the one that will be booted.  Change the id of one or both of the      drives to boot from the other drive.   b. Two Focus drives.  Use the control panel to control which of the two      drives will boot.   c. SCSI drive with an Apple SCSI card and a Focus drive works well.  Use      the control panel to control which of the two drives will boot.   d. SCSI drive with a RamFast SCSI card and Focus drive might work.  Some      people have had problems with this setup.3. Boot up your IIgs and drag the icon of the first partition on yourprimary drive over the first icon of the backup drive.  Give the Finderpermission to complete the operation.  Repeat for each partition on yourprimary drive.4. Back up your data often to keep your backup current.[EOA]YOU ARE INVITED"""""""""""""""You are invited to submit your favorite Tinkerer's Project for the Apple IIcomputers.Send your write up or idea to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]------------------------------                       KFest 2003 |-----------------------------------[PBT]KFest 2003 - PLAN TO BE THERE!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KansasFest 2003 is planned for July 22-27, 2003 at Avila University inKansas City, Missouri.(Entrance banner, Cat 5, Top 5)[EOA][KFS]THE Kfest SPIRIT - WHAT WILL YOU BRING?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Any interest? Yeah a LOT!Most important interest would be having you there:) It's been my personalconcern to have everyone who has ever owned an Apple II attend KFest ATLEAST ONCE - and for good reasons.1. There's NO WAY to really explain the special event that we have in KFest   to anyone who hasn't been there at least once. (We DO try, every year,   but it's something you have to experience to fully appreciate).2. EVERY first-time attendee has always added something to KFest by   attending! It's impossible for any one person to know everything about   and do everything that can be done Apple IIs. We all enjoy seeing what   others have done with their computers.3. Most first-time attendees continue to attend KFest when circumstances   allow and continue sharing, learning, and making KFest the special   gathering it is! It really IS the people who attend that make KFest.   (Again, YOU have to be there in person to experience this).What you are planning to bring and do at KFest is very exciting andinteresting to many of us.  Can't promise you'll walk away with all yourequested but there's a good chance you'll walk away with most of it - andI think a whole LOT more;)TIP: Make it to KFest this year; get PLENTY of sleep beforehand; don't beshy - that would waste valuable time:)Look forward to seeing you this year!Steve(Steve, Kfest Mailing List)[EOA][KHR]Kfest 2003 HackFest Rules"""""""""""""""""""""""""It's that time again!KansasFest 2003HackFest Rules1. Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 23, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 26 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.  However, entries may be described or discussed, includingscreen shots (where applicable), by the KFest committee for promotionalpurposes, or by legitimate Apple II community press.The following lists are not necessarily complete lists of everythingallowed; these are to be taken as "givens."  If it's not on the list,please ask for confirmation.Acceptable software:     System software     Development environment (no customizations)     GSBug     Nifty List     Marinetti     Exerciser     ORCA/Debugger, Splat!     DesignMaster, Foundation, Genesys, ResLin     Talking Tools     Spectrum, ProTERM, ANSITermAcceptable hardware:     Apple II computer, monitor, disk drives, hard drives     CD-ROM drive, tape drive     Hard disk controller card     Sound card (speakers/headphones/etc)     Accelerator card (any speed)     RAM cardAccepted reference material:     All official Apple reference materials (including     manuals, technical notes, and file type notes).     Reference manuals included with development tools     and software.     Commercially-available reference manuals.Any other hardware, software, or reference material needs the approval ofthe judges in advance.
