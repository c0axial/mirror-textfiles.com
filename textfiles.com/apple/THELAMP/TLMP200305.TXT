This new feature simply allowsyou toredo the combat choice for the previous character (instead of using<ESC> which redoes all characters).o New unlisted camp command: M)inimum Weapon Damage.  This command allowsyou to determine the minimum damage your character can inflict, dependingon the weapon selected and your character's strength and class.o New unlisted camp command: Equivalent H)uman Age.  Allows demihuman(non-human only) characters to determine how old they are in "human" years.o New preferences: Changeable sound parameters (including muting sound).Tony Ward, A2 Librarian(A2.TONY, Cat 2, Top 37, Msg 13)[EOA][SFA]SAFE v1.4 AVAILABLE"""""""""""""""""""I have posted SAFE 1.4 to my web site.This update addresses two bugs that arose.

I had mentioned in the "Interviews" sectionabout the staff of Kitchen Sink Software. Unfortunately, I identified oneof the company members as "Guy Bush"; his name actually is Eric Bush.The other very significant omission was neglecting to mention the officialdiscontinuation of the Apple IIe in November 1993. I likely missed that fortwo reasons: First, I was late getting the article submitted to the editor,and probably rushed through my review of the December 1993 issue. Second,that issue of GEnieLamp was released on the first of the month, just a fewdays after Apple released the price list that excluded the IIe, and sothere was only a brief mention of it in the "Hey Mister Postman" column.With those corrections out of the way, let's get on with the story.So far, we have covered the origins of this digital publishing phenomenonand its first two years of existence. During 1993, Apple II users on GEniecontinued to deal with the official discontinuation of the Apple IIGS, butstill enjoyed continued availability of the Platinum Apple IIe. However,this consolation was tempered by the knowledge that the life of the IIe onApple's assembly lines also had to be limited. The enjoyment of the newenergy given to AppleWorks with its 4.0 update by Quality Computers andRandy Brandt was tempered by the announcement that the era of Apple IIproduction had officially ended.And on that note, let us boldly go forward into 1994.First, let's bring the year into focus. Soap operas spilled into real lifein 1994. Ice skater Nancy Kerrigan sustained an attack by the boyfriend ofopponent Tonya Harding prior to the Winter Olympics. President Clintonbegan to get into trouble with the launch of an investigation into hisinvolvement in the Whitewater scandal. Accusations were made towards NorthKorea regarding its work on a nuclear weapons program (sounds familiar,doesn't it?). Accusations also were directed towards former pro footballplayer OJ Simpson in regards to the murder of his wife. A strike called bymajor league baseball players over a contract disagreement led to thecancellation of the 1994 World Series.In the realm of computers, the new frontier of the World Wide Web waspicking up steam, with Web traffic passing Gopher traffic for the firsttime. The Netscape Corporation was formed and released the first beta ofits commercial Navigator web browser. Web pioneer Yahoo began operation ofas a list of web sites (the name stood for "Yet Another HierarchicalOfficious Oracle"). Microsoft Windows was updated to version 3.11, but thecompany also moved forward with its next operating system revision,releasing the beta for Windows 4.0, code-named "Chicago" (later to be named"Windows 95"). Intel's new Pentium processor was found to have a bug in itsfloating point operations, leading to much merriment in the Apple world.Apple Computer decided to get in on the online service explosion, launchingits own eWorld service in June. The company released its firstPowerPC-based Macintosh computers, the PowerMac 6100, 7100, and 8100models, and also began to license other companies to producePowerMac-compatible computers in an effort to compete against Intel'slarger market. Finally, Apple made its first attempt at modernizing itsoperating system with the announcement of "Copland".To review events in the Apple II segment of the computing universe, surgeforward with me into GEnieLamp A2's reports for 1994, where AppleWorksoccupied much of our attention, both for good and for bad.TIME IS ON OUR SIDEThe GEnieLamp A2 Masthead in the January issue reflected the large numberof digital publications that T/TalkNET was helping manage, as well as theinclusion of the non-paper version of A2-Central that Doug Cuff was at thattime editing, in addition to GEnieLamp A2. _________________________________________________________________________|                                                                         ||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////||  GEnieLamp Apple II ~ A T/TalkNET OnLine Publication ~  Vol.2, Issue 22 ||  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ||  Editor....................................................Douglas Cuff ||   Publisher.............................................John F.

Each issue beganwith his editorial, often telling a story of some personal experience andthen fitting that story to an aspect of the current Apple II scene. In somecases, he would relate a technical bit of information that helped GEnie A2members do more with their computers or get online more easily. He alsobegan the tradition of Lamp editors in doing some promotion for the annualJuly KansasFest conference (called "ICONference" in 1994). He also finallyhad the opportunity to attend the event this year, thanks in part tosponsorship offered by Resource Central for its newsletter editors andmajor contributors.The editorial in the June issue ("In Which We Consider Serpents' Teeth")addressed the touchy problem of copyright infringement. The conflictbetween the rights of authors and programmers and those of consumers hadbeen a long-running one, going back to the early 1980's when copyprotection of software began to appear as a defense against widespreadduplication of disks. In the case of this editorial, the topic did notinvolve improper copying of SOFTWARE, but rather from copying andreproduction of WORDS. Although GEnieLamp did not prohibit freedistribution of the publication as a whole in its digital form, it didspecify how individual articles should be reproduced elsewhere, and whatcitation should appear with that article. Cuff had found that there weresome Apple II user group newsletters across the country that did not seemto feel obliged to adhere to these reference rules. This might havehappened simply because some newsletter editors did not understand theimportance of properly giving credit for the work of others, or it may havebeen a time and space-saving measure. But it was a problem; not only wouldsome newsletters fail to refer to GEnieLamp as the source of the article,but they might even leave out the name of the author or a portion of thearticle itself! In a way, this was analogous to the situation that highschool and college teachers experience when students turn in a paper thatwas copied almost word-for-word from a previously published source, tryingto call it their own. Cuff felt (rightly so) that it was perfectlyreasonable, especially for a FREE newsletter, to ask that the copyrightrules be followed.This problem continued to nag at GEnieLamp and The Lamp! over the years.(Personal note: When I was writing the GEnie News Digest in the early1990's, I personally discovered the problem caused by improper articlereproduction. I always PRESUMED that my articles were reproduced just as Ihad written them. On one occasion, however, I was made aware that HenrikGudat of Bright Software was upset about an article of mine that he hadbeen made aware of. This news article, complete with a quote by Gudat I hadfound on GEnie regarding a program he had written, had been incorrectlyreproduced in the newsletter. The condensation of the article had made itlook as if I were trying to make it appear that I had written the author'swords myself. Naturally, he was upset about this, and posted somethingrather derogatory towards me in an Internet newsgroup. When it was broughtto my attention, I reviewed the article and felt that I had properly citedhim as the source of the statements made. I e-mailed him, apologized forthe way in which it had appeared, and showed him how the article wasSUPPOSED to have appeared. When he saw that it was not ME but thenewsletter who was at fault, he also graciously apologized for the flame,and was kind enough to send to me a free copy of his program Symbolix tomake up for it! What I learned from this was to ASK FOR PERMISSION fromanyone whose words I specifically quoted. This way I could make sure theperson in question knew he or she was BEING quoted, and gave them theopportunity to correct any mistakes in their words.)As editor, Cuff also felt obligated to address concerns raised by peoplewho used hardware to have GEnieLamp read aloud to them by their computer(primarily for those visually impaired readers). The problem that he becameaware of had to do with ASCII art that often appeared in GEnieLamp. Therandom characters that made up an art picture made drove these peoplecrazy, as they didn't know if the software was crashing, or if the text wasgarbled. To help with this problem, Cuff added the phrases "ASCII ARTBEGINS" and "ASCII ART ENDS", to signal that a lot of audible "garbage" wascoming.ROUNDTABLE NEWSOffline readers have always made it easier to keep track of reading andreplying to messages on a text-based system like GEnie (or CompuServe orDelphi). On GEnie, GEM and CoPilot continued to be in use, working with theterminal programs Talk Is Cheap, Spectrum, and ProTERM and using AppleWorkswith UltraMacros to process the messages.  Efforts to update themcontinued. GEM was no longer a shareware product, having been acquired byGEnie A2, but programmers contributed time to it to provide maintenanceupdates. This was done to accommodate the new AppleWorks 4.0, as well as tokeep up with changes that had been made in the GEnie bulletin boardsoftware. Another program, PowerGuide, was announced in July as astand-alone product with which to navigate GEnie.With the start of October, competitor America Online announced that it wasdiscontinuing support for text-based computers such as the Apple II. Thisdecision was made because of changes being made in the software to accessAOL, for enhancement of the services offered. Macintosh and Windows userswould have their software updated, but AOL felt it could not justify makingthe updates available for the relatively fewer number of Apple IIsubscribers it still had.This change was scheduled to take effect on October 31, 1994. Althoughthere were yet no announced plans to close down the Apple II forums, itwould now require a Macintosh or PC to be able to ACCESS those forums.Although AOL offered Apple II users free hours to entice them to changeover to using a Macintosh or PC, many who owned Apple II's wanted nothingmore to do with that service. For these disenfranchised users, GEnie A2sysops stepped forward and began to market their service to thosesoon-to-be-orphaned AOL members, and worked at finding ways to make the A2RoundTable an attractive alternative.In November, GEnie announced reduced online costs for those accessing theservice using a 9600 baud modem. Prior to that time, access at 9600 baudwas possible, but there were fewer access phone numbers for that service,and those doing so were charged a higher per-hour rate. Even with thisreduction in rates, for many people using a modem faster than 2400 baud wasjust not cost effective.SIDE BAR: ONLINE SERVICES AND THE INTERNETBy 1994, the increasing availability of graphic browsers (Mosaic and thenew Netscape Navigator) to access the "World Wide Web" were causing theInternet to capture a higher amount of nationwide attention and interest.To maintain its market share, GEnie continued to update its system, and waspromising "full Internet access" by the end of the year. To explain thesignificance of the Internet phenomenon on events that happened beginningin 1994 and afterwards, I need to interrupt this story for a moment to givesome background about online services like GEnie, and their relation to theInternet.When the microcomputer became available in the mid 1970's, one of the firstpieces of hardware that was designed to attach to it was a way to allow onecomputer to connect with another. Initially, this served the purpose ofhelping transfer programs between the machines, but with time expanded farbeyond that. Serial and parallel cards allowed computers in the samevicinity to connect; modems connected to those cards (or modems on cards)made it possible to dial up and access other computers located far away.Aside from teletype connections to mainframe systems, some early computerusers set up their computer as destination for OTHER computers to call upand post messages or share files. These early bulletin board systems(BBS's) were popular and proliferated greatly in the 1980's and early1990's. However, to call a SINGLE phone number and interact with MANY othercomputer users required a subscription to a larger computer network. TheSource and CompuServe began in 1979, joined by Delphi in 1982, GEnie in1985, and America Online (in its early forms) in 1988. Aside from AmericaOnline, these were command-line, text-based systems whose functioninitially was little different with a personal computer than it was with anolder printing teletype. They were run on mainframe computers that wereused for business purposes during the day, and then sold their unusedafter-hours capacity to consumers to use as a gigantic bulletin boardsystem. They all provided messaging, file transfer, and chat services, andthe various services competed with each other based primarily on theirvariety of additional content (games, access to news feeds, etc.) and onprice.These networks were all self-contained, and isolated from each other. Justas it was generally not possible to send an e-mail message to someone whowas on Bob's BBS if you only called The Pirate's Den BBS, it was not asupported feature to send mail to someone on GEnie if you were onCompuServe. There was no availability of inter-network communication usingthe consumer software on these mainframes. Part of this limitation had todo with variations of mainframe hardware being used. These (usually) OLDsystems were designed without concern about making a connection to othercomputers. In addition, each system had its own quirks about how to make aconnection with an outside computer. GEnie was unique in requiring an older"half-duplex" setting, where other systems typically used "full-duplex".There were also variations in "stop bits" and "parity bits" required tosend and receive accurately.On the other hand, the "Internet", a network of networks, had been inexistence since the early 1970's. Over time, various protocols had beendeveloped into standards that allowed diverse systems to successfullycommunicate with each other. Being designed originally as a means for themilitary to communicate in case of a national emergency with failure of thenormal telephone or radio system, this maze of interconnected networks hadbuilt-in redundancies to guarantee effective transmission of messages anddata. Many tools to manage these interconnected networks were designed andmodified by university computer centers. The Internet was designed to grow,mature, and adapt to changing technologies; the proprietary commercialonline services were designed to just keep functioning. Enhancements infunction depended heavily on whether those were needed by the business thatused the mainframe in the daytime, or if it would attract additionalsubscribers to the service.The sheer vastness of the Internet gave it resources that no single onlineservice could possibly hope to match. Graduates of "connected" universitiesthat had been accustomed to accessing that massive database often feltconstricted by the relatively locked-in nature of a consumer onlineservice. As growth continued in the size and number of computer networksthat were part of the Internet, the commercial online services began torealize that they could not expect to continue to grow in the way they haddone previously. All feared that a competing service would open up accessto the Internet at large in such a way that would make it attractive forusers to SWITCH to that service. Consequently, by the early 1990's most ofthese services were looking for ways to adapt their old hardware, software,and networks in such a way as to be able to fit into the Internet.To further explain the march towards the Internet of today, consider theanalogy of cities. The traditional online service would be like a large,isolated city with its own mail system, government, entertainment venues,and storage facilities. Cities like these were completely self-contained,having no access at all to other similar nearby cities. Each city mighthave gasoline power engines, but one city may only offer diesel fuel,another 95-octane gasoline, and yet another kerosene. If a road were builtto connect with another city, it would require changes in either thehardware (engines) or software (fuel) to allow those vehicles to operatewhen away from "home". Furthermore, a risk of developing this openness totravel raised the possibility that people might actually MOVE to that othercity and STAY there. However, these cities (online services) HAD to makethe change; people were hiking by foot to the other cities anyway, luredthere by promises of a better land. The individual cities each decided thatit was better to aid and streamline the process of inter-city travel, whilecontinuing to build up the services WITHIN the home city as much aspossible, to make it more attractive to stay than to move on.Accordingly, GEnie was doing its best during 1994 to build a better highwayto the Internet than the two-lane cart path that they had first designed.The engineers doing the construction did not yet know if it would preventor slow emigration from GEnie to other "cities". Unlike America Online,which had chosen to specifically exile certain types of citizens from itsborders (those who lived in smaller neighborhoods in the older part oftown, some of whom had helped to FOUND the town years earlier), GEnie wasdoing its best to keep its borders open for all citizens. Whose plans wouldwork best in the end? No one yet really knew.Now, back into the lamp to look at what appeared in GEnieLamp magazineduring 1994.HARDWARE NEWSI mentioned early in this article that I had missed giving the news aboutthe discontinuation of the Apple IIe that happened in late 1993, as therewas only scant mention of it in the December issue. Actually, in a furtherreview of the early issues of GEnieLamp A2 in 1994, there was very littlediscussion of it AT ALL in the RoundTable messages that were reprinted.Compared to the larger discussion that appeared a year earlier, when theIIGS was taken off the product catalog, this seems like a quiet response.What were the reasons for these differences? It is possible that editorDoug Cuff was so upset about it that he just could not bring himself toacknowledge the event. However, since he included later in the Januaryissue a long dissertation that I myself wrote about it (see below) this isunlikely. What is probably the correct explanation is that most members ofthe A2 Roundtable who still were using the Apple IIe just didn't care anylonger about what Apple chose to do. Apple's decisions had become anon-issue with anyone. They all expected the IIe to be dropped; it was justa matter of time. And so they continued to do what they had been doing inthe years Apple IIGS was introduced in 1986; use the computer, and shareamongst themselves information to support it.Drowning out the non-event of the loss of the IIe were other discussionsabout Apple's hardware. Perhaps Apple's management didn't support theplatform with new revisions of it, but they did do a fairly good job ofsupporting those existing owners. It was mentioned by one member that hewas still able to get his ROM 00 Apple IIGS computer upgraded to a ROM 01by his Apple dealer. Another member even found that he was still able toupdate his early model Apple IIc to be able to use a UniDisk 3.5 (althoughit took a little coaxing of the Apple telephone technical support person tofind that the program was still in effect).Applied Engineering, long a provider of accelerators, RAM cards, and otherhardware items for the Apple II and IIGS platforms, was another casualty ofthe waning of Apple II sales. It officially closed down in March 1994,causing mixed feelings in the community. The company had irritated someApple II aficionados by beginning to branch out into hardware products forthe Macintosh platform (supposedly by financially supporting this effortthrough the sales of their Apple II products, much as Apple Computer hadkept the Macintosh alive in its early years through sales of the Apple II).Printer upgrades also occupied bandwidth on the A2 RoundTable. Theydiscussed the difference between the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet and DeskWriterinkjet printers, for the sake of those who were interested in moving beyondtheir older, noisy dot matrix printers.Although it was currently the favored son in the Apple II world, QualityComputers cautioned the enthusiasm worked up by the rumor mills. JerryKindall stated for the company that it had NO intentions to try andpurchase the Apple II line from Apple Computer.Mysterious posts appeared in January about a coming product from ///SHHSysteme, a German company that produced Apple II hardware. This card,eventually identified as the BlueDisk card, made it possible to useinexpensive standard PC floppy disk drives on an Apple IIGS or IIe. Thecard became available in a beta form in February, with later posting oftiming information that compared performance between ProDOS, HFS, andMS-DOS formatted disks.The Turbo ASB chip was advertised to help in overcoming speed problems inthe venerable Super Serial Card. This replacement chip made it possible forserial communication to go from the current maximum of 19.2 kbps to as highas 230.4 kbps (if the computer in which it was installed was fast enough toallow it to keep up in regards to disk activity, screen drawing, etc).Chuck Newby of Charlie's Appleseeds continued to supply hard drives to theApple II community. During 1994 he introduced the Roadrunner 40 andAppleLeaf drives, sold usually with the CMS SCSI card and a "light" versionof ProSel to help with drive management.Vitesse updated the Quickie hand scanner to include a color adapter, whichthey called the Quickie-C. A later software update to version 3.2 allowedbetter quality scans to be created and modified.In the later part of the year, Sequential Systems announced the SecondSight VGA card for the IIGS. This product allowed use of the more commonlyavailable (and higher resolution) VGA monitors, instead of the traditionalIIGS RGB monitor. A competing product, the TurboRez card, was also still indevelopment, but was going through its third redesign, having first beenannounced at Apple Expo East in 1992.Roundtable members also contributed their knowledge about hardwareproblems. Gary Utter explained how to repair certain problems with theApple IIGS RGB monitor, and how to replace the fan in a Kensington SystemSaver. Harold Hislop provided much education and service for many types ofhardware problems.SOFTWARE NEWSConsidering the lack of new hardware from Apple for the platform, there wasstill quite a bit of activity in regards to the software scene during 1994.Because there is so much to say, I'll divide this up in to sections.:: APPLEWORKS GS ::After the success of the updated AppleWorks 4.0, Apple IIGS users eagerlyawaited a revision and upgrade to this GUI productivity product. InFebruary, Quality Computers put out press releases that still promisedAppleWorks GS 2.0 was going to be released in the spring of 1994. However,they had previously promised a bug-fix upgrade from the old v1.1 to a newv1.2 by the end of 1993, and this had yet to materialize. By July, thecompany shocked the GEnie A2 community by announcing that the project hadbeen cancelled.This generated much discussion and complaints on the A2 RoundTable. Aftermany years of neglect by Apple, they had finally found a company theythought would SAVE them from using buggy, outdated software. There was noresponse by Quality for several days, but finally Jerry Kindall posted apublic apology and explanation for their decision.The reason given for the project cancellation was the poor state in whichthe AppleWorks GS source code had been "preserved". The original version ofAppleWorks GS released by Claris had appeared before the GS/OS operatingsystem was available, back in the days of ProDOS 16 (the "bridge" operatingsystem between the older 8-bit ProDOS and the a comprehensive 16-bitoperating system). As a result, AppleWorks GS didn't follow many of therules that GS/OS enforced in both its System 5 and System 6 releases.According to Gary Utter (from the July 1994 issue of GEnieLamp):   ____________________________________________________________________  |                                                                    |  | That code is such a mess that even patching it to provide GS/OS    |  | compatibility took Claris many months, and making it "compatible"  |  | with [System] v5.x took (as I recall) over a year. AWGS v1.0 will  |  | will not even run under System 6, and just barely runs under v5.x. |  |____________________________________________________________________|Jerry Kindall's detailed message, reproduced in that same July issue, isfascinating as to the insight it gives to the story of the product:   _____________________________________________________________________  |                                                                     |  | When we took over AppleWorks and AppleWorks GS, we assumed that     |  | updating AppleWorks GS was going to be a fairly straightforward     |  | task. Unfortunately, we were wrong.  The source code for AWGS is 7  |  | megabytes in size.  Those who have seen it have called it the most  |  | poorly organized and documented source code they've ever laid eyes  |  | on.  Claris was unable to provide us with any form of documentation |  | for the source code, nor were they able to provide us with their    |  | official bug list.                                                  |  |                                                                     |  | The source code was designed to build under an old version of MPW   |  | (Macintosh Programmer's Workshop).  I have it on good authority     |  | that even the old MPW wasn't actually capable of compiling the      |  | source code as it was provided to us; it seems likely that it was   |  | compiled in pieces and then patched together by hand.  We did not   |  | receive any documentation on this process -- in fact, there         |  | probably never was any.                                             |  |                                                                     |  | To give you an idea of how bad the AWGS source was, consider that   |  | it took Jim Merritt [the coordinator of development of the IIGS     |  | System 5 Finder], who we originally contracted to lead the          |  | project, four months just to get the source code Claris sent us to  |  | produce an executable version of AppleWorks GS 1.1.  Even then, the |  | program was not 100% byte-for-byte identical with the shipping      |  | version because of the hand-patching which was used in the original |  | version...                                                          |  |                                                                     |  | ...the source code simply was not arranged in any coherent fashion. |  | I've been told that there are sections of the AppleWorks GS source  |  | code which exist mainly because nobody knows exactly what they do   |  | -- Claris was afraid that removing them would cause the program to  |  | stop working!                                                       |  |_____________________________________________________________________|Other posts associated with this announcement in the July issue includefurther intriguing information about the history of the original product,which Claris had purchased under the name "GSWorks" from StyleWorks.Many of the other programmers Quality had contacted to look at the projecthad said that it would be less expensive to completely re-write the programthan to fix what they had and make it executable (and workable!). At alater date, one programmer was quoted as saying that he HAD been able toget it to compile and execute, and that he thought the project was possibleto accomplish. However, Quality Computers apparently felt that the time andmoney that would have to be put into the project would be far in excess ofany income they would derive in sales of it. Needless to say, there wassignificant disappointment about the project's cancellation.:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::Quality Computers was busy keeping up with its new position as publisher ofAppleWorks. They had to correct a mistaken mailing of AppleWorks 4.01update disks sent to registered customers, having found that some of themhad not been duplicated properly. Meanwhile, author Randy Brandt issued yetanother update, this time to version 4.02, fixing more bugs that had beenidentified since the original 4.0 release. An AppleWorks 4.0 screen savermodule called "AfterWork" was also released during the early part of theyear.In June, an update to AppleWorks 4.1 was announced, although Quality laterchanged the version number to 4.3, trying to avoid confusion amongstcustomers between this version and the previously released 4.01 and 4.02updates. And just to keep things interesting, Brandt announced mid-yearthat sales of AppleWorks 4.0 had been sufficient to justify a further majorupdate to the program. AppleWorks 5.0, code named "Narnia", included manyenhancements, including a built-in UltraMacros playback function. Brandtdid say that an AppleWorks 6.0 for the Apple II series would never bepossible, as there simply was not enough space left in main memory to addany other features. For the 5.0 revision he found it necessary to reducethe number of letters in some menus, just to squeeze out a few moreavailable bytes of space for code.The Byte Works, supplier of programming tools for the Apple II and IIGS,announced a non-programming product. This IIGS program was a spreadsheet,called Quick Click Calc, and could be considered what the spreadsheetmodule in an updated AppleWorks GS could have been. Westerfield alsodesigned a feature that had been appearing in Macintosh programs, called"publish and subscribe", which allowed one spreadsheet to update info onanother spreadsheet. Westerfield asked for input from users as to whatother type of productivity software they would like to be next in the"Quick Click" series (although he stated that he was really not interestedin producing a database or word processing product).HyperCard IIGS, which had been released by Apple in the same status asApple II system software (free when distributed by Apple II user groups)suffered a blow. It was discovered mid-year that the 2,000 remaining copiesof the Script Language Guide printed by Addison-Wesley had all been"recycled", leaving no further new copies of it available anywhere.Also:Seven Hills Software announced plans to update GraphicWriter III, its wordprocessing application for the IIGS, to version 1.2.Procyon's discQuest software was updated to v1.2, which allowed betteraudio support, as well as the display of color images.Rick Adams updated his shareware program Financial GeniuS to version 2.0.Steve Peterson's Your Money Matters financial software was in beta testingfor a new version.Charles Hartley updated Computer Keyboarding to v5.1.2.Larry McEwen uploaded a six-disk HyperStudio stack called "Much Ado AboutShakespeare", and asked for a shareware fee of $25, which accepted asdonations to the Immune Deficiency Foundation (treatment of the disease"primary immune deficiency", the disease the "bubble boy" had).:: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::With the success of AppleWorks, there were other places where Quality founditself under strain. One other project that they had been working on forquite a while had to be cancelled. Q-Fax GS was a program to allow sendingand receiving faxes on the Apple IIGS. Unfortunately, the author had notyet been able to complete it, and over a year following its firstannouncement by Quality, they decided to cancel their contract to sell it.However, programmers outside of Quality were reporting progress on faxsoftware. Paul Parkhurst, the author of ANSITerm, announced work on PMPFaxwas beginning. Another programmer, Richard Wifall, began work onFAXplosion. But it was Vitesse who was actually first to release theirproduct, FAXination, near the end of the year.Seven Hills Software shipped Spectrum 1.0, a GS/OS telecommunicationsprogram written by Ewen Wannop of Great Britain. On one occasion soon afterits release, Ken Lucke posted his concern about a possible virus when hesuddenly found on his screen a British flag with a trumpet sound. He wasreassured that this was not a strange virus, but rather an easter egg thathad been inserted into the program.Gary Hayman released the Magic News Group Reader, as a set ofAppleWorks/TimeOut extensions to handle reading and managing Internet newsgroups on the Apple II.A2 RoundTable members raised concerns when it was learned that inTrec wasplanning to release a Mac and possible a PC version of its popular ProTERMsoftware. The company was accused of "pulling a Beagle" (referring toBeagle Bros switch to Mac software, and their subsequent disappearance as acompany). Jerry Cline responded to this by reaffirming their plans tocontinue with support of the Apple II versions of the product. (Since then,the company has not released any further upgrades to the product, but ithas continued to sell and supported it, and for years has been a loyalsponsor of KansasFest).:: SYSTEM SOFTWARE ::One important problem that began to appear was one involving the HFS FST(file system translator) that allowed IIGS users to read and writeMacintosh-formatted disks. The bug that seemed to intermittently appearwould destroy the directory structure of the HFS disk, making this methodunattractive for more than just a simple file transfer between computers.This problem plagued Jim Maricondo of DigiSoft Innovations. As the CD-ROMdrive made further penetration into the Apple IIGS community, it wasbecoming feasible to use the CD, with its massive 650 megabytes of storagespace, as a way to distribute Apple II-specific programs and files. Thismade it much easier to acquire a massive collection of files that wouldotherwise take a very long time (even at 14.4K baud) to download. AsMaricondo began to work on the project, he had to map out how the filesshould be stored on the disk. Since the ProDOS file system could not managemore than 32 megs per disk volume, it would make sense to partition the CDinto a couple of "smaller" 32 meg ProDOS volumes, and then partition therest of it as a single large Mac-HFS volume. However, the recurrent problemwith scrambled disk directories bogged down the project, making itnecessary instead to use multiple smaller HFS partitions. A new Apple II emulator for the Mac was announced, "STM" (or "Stop TheMadness") by Jim Nitchals. The author was also planning to release thisproduct on a CD that contained old software for the Apple II for which hehad gotten permission from the original authors. (A later mention in TheLamp in 2002 stated that the project had never come to completion).Not to be outdone, Udo Huth of Germany announced a CD-ROM full of AppleIIGS and Mac software collected in Europe.:: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::The increasing rate of purchase of inkjet printers (commonly the HP DeskJet500 or similar) caused frustration to users of Print Shop. Since theprogram was no longer being supported or updated by Broderbund, people weresearching for a way in which they could print their creations on these nicenew printers. To help with this, Joe Kohn spearheaded an effort to look fora programmer who would be interested in making a utility or driver or patchthat would help Print Shop and these printers function together. Thiseffort actually included a reward, with contributions being made bySoftdisk and others. Bill Heineman was identified as a candidate toaccomplish this, but it turned out to be a far more expensive propositionthan Kohn had originally hoped for.Kitchen Sink Software released System II, a graphic desktop interface for8-bit Apple II computers, allowing a simple way of launching programs andreturning to the menu after quitting the program. (This may seem like nobig deal today, but remember that in most cases, DOS 3.3 and ProDOSoperated as a command-line oriented system, which was difficult for aninexperienced user to manage.)The Foundation resource editor from Lunar Productions was released asfreeware.Andy McFadden, author of the disk files compression utility Hardpressed,had to release an update to fix a potentially dangerous bug that undercertain circumstances would trash archived files and make themunrecoverable.Peter Watson updated his MS-DOS utilities (to allow access to MS-DOS diskson compatible hardware) to version 2.1.Multi GS 2.0, another "switcher" type of utility for GS/OS System 6, wasreleased, and was contrasted with The Manager 1.0 (released the previousyear).Tulin's driver for NEC CD-ROM drives was released.:: GAMES ::iD Software was a PC game company derived from an older shareware groupnamed Apogee Software. It included the talents of some former Apple IIprogrammers that had at one time worked for Softdisk G-S. They had writtenmany successful side-scrolling shareware games for the IBM PC. These gamesoften were divided up into three large segments, the first available as afree download, and the other parts available once the shareware fee hadbeen paid. They had come up with a totally new type of game that represented the nextlevel of sophistication, and used an old Apple II game "Castle Wolfenstein"as inspiration for the story behind the game. Released as "Wolfenstein 3D",it used the same escape-from-the-Nazis scenario as the original game, butallowed the player to experience the game from the point of view of themain character, in what would come to be called a "first person shooter".While playing, it appeared that you were actually moving through rooms,opening doors, and fighting bad guys around every corner. The game was sucha success on the PC that a version was created for the Super Nintendo.The interesting thing about the Super Nintendo version of Wolfenstein 3Dwas that it was actually developed on an Apple IIGS. This was possiblebecause the Super Nintendo ran on the same 65816 processor that powered theApple IIGS. When this was discovered, people were encouraged to send mailto id Software and ask that a version be released for the IIGS. And by theend of 1994, Vitesse advertised in their catalog an Apple IIGS version ofWolfenstein 3D, with a special price if ordered before the end of the year.Vitesse was already involved with another game for the IIGS. That game wasa re-release of Ultima I, a classic Apple II game originally published byOrigin. Vitesse was able to license the game from Electronic Arts, who nowowned Origin. To make it better than a simple re-release, Vitesse addedenhanced music, sound, and graphics.Brutal Deluxe, a IIGS software company from Europe, paid a visit to JoeKohn in the summer, and brought him some samples of their work, including abeta for their game, Opale.PUBLICATIONSII Alive was fighting for its survival during 1994. Quality Computers wasfinding the many different things it was trying to do to be a stretch forthe company. Originally a software and hardware catalog company (andsupplier of these especially to education), it had expanded to softwaredevelopment and sales (AppleWorks and AppleWorks GS) and larger scalepublishing (moving from Enhance, a newsletter for education, to II Alive, aglossy magazine, trying to fill the gap left as inCider/A+ dropped out ofthe market). Even with the enthusiastic Apple II crowd on GEnie and otheronline services, the number of subscriptions was not as great as it neededto be. Quality was finding it more difficult than had been anticipated tomanage a paid subscription list (it was more involved than mailing outcatalogs). In the middle of 1994, Quality announced that the decision hadbeen made to publish only six more bimonthly issues of II Alive before theywould discontinue publication. Jerry Kindall continued in his position aseditor.Resource Central announced Doug Cuff's appointment as editor of A2-Central.John Peters, who had started the GEnieLamp publications, had been editingA2-Central for a few issues; he was making the change to concentrate onSolid Windows and Config.sys, Resource Central's publications for PC users.Auri Rahimzadeh and Ben Johnson began work on a new hypermedia publicationcalled PongLife, which later evolved into PowerGS.Joe Kohn of Shareware Solutions II announced the inclusion of articles byCynthia Field (who had also been a writer for inCider/A+).EGO Systems, publisher of GS+ Magazine, announced a move to Chattanooga,Tennessee, as well as their purchase of AutoArk from Econ Technologies.An announcement of "The ?Bad Apple Newsletter" was made in October.However, it was never mentioned in GEnieLamp again.COMPANIESThe Big Red Computer Club, based in Norfolk, Nebraska, was a combinationcompany and club, selling products as well as publishing a newsletter,called "Scarlett". In the middle of 1994, it was announced that the club(often referred to as "BRCC") was planning to close by the end of the year.John Wrenholt, the club's founder, had worked hard to bring new softwareand preserved software to the Apple II community. Unfortunately, the returnin sales for all of his effort was simply not sufficient to support thebusiness that he had built up.Joe Kohn's Shareware Solutions II was expanding from a publication to alsobeing a distribution source for certain shareware products. During thisyear, SSII began as publisher for Contacts GS, a IIGS desk accessory todisplay address information. He had previously had connections with Big RedComputer Club, but stated clearly that he did not have plans to take overWrenholt's business.Resource Central, the print publishing and mail order arm of ICON, closedits doors at the end of September, continuing publication of its disk-basedpublications.ECON Technologies exited the Apple II business, focusing instead oncreating Macintosh software.Broderbund discontinued work on Apple II products, including Print Shop.KANSASFESTThis year the A2 Central Summer Conference was called "ICONference", fromResource Central parent company name, ICON ("International Computer Owner'sNetwork"). Randy Brandt, project manager for AppleWorks 4.0, was selectedas the keynote speaker. Speakers included Bill Mensch of Western DesignCenter, Joe Kohn, Bill Heineman, Roger Wagner, Joe Wankerl, and others.There was a presentation by Apple about the new Macintosh System 7.5, andeven a preview from Microsoft of the coming update to its Windows operatingsystem (see introduction at the start of this article). Both the Apple andMicrosoft representatives were given some harassment by those attendingtheir talks, primarily about features in their respective new operatingsystems that had been present on the Apple IIGS for several years. Also,some creative hackers changed the startup picture on one of Apple'sMacintosh computers to say, "Welcome to the Apple IIGS" with the IIInfinitum logo (see later in this article), instead of the usual Macstartup screen.REVIEWSDarrel Raines, former GEnieLamp A2 editor, continued to contribute toGEnieLamp by reviewing WestCode Software's TypeSet, a TrueType fontmanagement utility. He also reviewed the games Xenocide, Bard's Tale, andChessMaster 2100. He also reviewed his vacation WITHOUT a computer oronline access.A different type of review appeared in the April issue. Charlie Hartley,author of Computer Keyboarding, began a column called "The Treasure Hunt",in which he reviewed OLD software, programs that were in the GEnie A2library, but which had often been overlooked (easy to do in a librarycontaining over 20,000 files). Some of them he even discussed how to update(if a very old program) to work with one of the more modern Apple II's thathad not been in existence when the program had originally been written.Jay Curtis conducted a combination interview and program review withprogrammer Jawaid Bazyar of Procyon, and his product discQuest.An older review of VCR Companion by Jim Wellman was reprinted (it hadoriginally been posted on APPLESIG on The SOURCE)."Much Ado About Shakespeare" (mentioned above) was reviewed by CharlieHartley in his Treasure Hunt column.Udo Huth reviewed the hardware products, specifically the BlueDiskcontroller and MS-DOS utilities. He also reviewed the AppleDesign PoweredSpeakers and their use on the IIGS. The designers of the not-yet-releasedTurboRez card reviewed their card and compared it with the Second Sight VGAcard.Phil Shapiro reviewed the books "Doing Business On The Internet" (by MaryCronin) and "The Internet Business Guide" (by Rosalind Resnick and DaveTaylor).WRITERSKen Gagne, a frequent contributor to GEnie (and later on Delphi andA2Central.com) made his first appearance in GEnieLamp A2 with a post aboutidentifying an Easter Egg in the Quickie v3.1 scanner software.My own contributions to GEnieLamp included the continuing Apple II Historyreprinting, from Part 19 to the end. The "Polishing Green Apples" serieswent through a description of the built-in ROM control panel features ofthe Apple IIGS, as well as going into ways of managing large storagedevices. Both of these series concluded with the July issue. I also wasmotivated to create a eulogy to the lately departed Apple IIe. Thisappeared in the January issue in the form of a song parody called "Apple IIPie" (from "American Pie"). Another song parody of mine, "InternetFileman", appeared in June. And not only did I contribute in a literarysense, but I also had a long post about conversion of TrueType fonts fromMS-DOS to the IIGS that appeared in the November issue.Phil Shapiro's REFLECTIONS series dealt with telecom training centers,anticipation of shared long distance minutes (which he envisioned as beingsplit between the caller and the receiver, rather than between differentusers on the same cellular phone account). He outlined a possible futuree-mail technical support service. He suggested that e-mail could decreasethe load on the U.S. postal service (although we have seen that it hadincreased the load of junk mail that we receive via e-mail). He discussedonline literary collaborations; this has actually occurred with Apple IIpublications at least since the days of the II Scribe forum on Delphi,where various authors would confer about articles that they had written,offering suggestions or pointing out errors. (This exists today in anInternet mailing list of the same name.)"E.SHEPHERD (aka Sheppy)", a student at the University of California, SantaBarbara, made his debut in GEnieLamp A2 in March, commenting on games forthe IIGS (a possible Sim City port, and Eamon adventures). Most of hislater posts appeared under his POWERPC.PRO name (he was chief sysop in thePowerPC RoundTable). He also was hard at work on his many IIGS sharewareand freeware projects, distributed under the Sheppyware name.Tony Diaz also had a first appearance in GEnieLamp. He was mentionedindirectly first, having been seen at an auction ("...the guy sittingtowards the back of the room? Kind of ethnic looking and sort of nervous...He told me he had 800 IIGSs in a warehouse back home..."). In May's issuehe announced information about Alltech Electronics, as well as their plansto take over production of the SoundMeister stereo/digitizer card for theIIGS from ECON Technologies. In August he gave more background informationabout the never-completed SoundMeister Pro card. By the end of the year thecard was finally ready to ship, including ECON's Digital Session softwarefor it.INTERVIEWSo Randy Brandt, about the new AppleWorks 4.0 and other products from JEMSoftware, interviewed by Tara Dillingero HangTime (editor of Script-Central)o Eric Shepherd, by Charlie Hartley, (quoted as saying, "Today's networkswill look puny and toylike compared to the networks at the beginning of thenext millennium. The Internet is big and growing fast, but we haven't yetreached the point where being online is _necessary_.  In five years we'llbe there...")o Pat Kern (prolific computer graphic art collector and producer), byCharlie Hartleyo Tony Ward (GEnie A2 chief librarian), by Charlie HartleyMISCELLANEOUS FEATURESThe World Wide User Group (GEnie A2's virtual Apple II user group) metregularly in the RTC (real time conference) chat room. Some of their editedRTC transcripts appeared in GEnieLamp A2. They also began to have a monthlycolumn by Gina Saikin that acted much as a user group newsletter, reportingon news and products for Apple II computers. Early in 1994 the group's namewas changed to "Planetary Apple League" (or "PAL" for short), and inSeptember it was changed again, this time to "Planetary Apple User's Group"(PAUG).Jay Curtis wrote a series of articles about Apple II hybrids, referring toa computer that can act as a foreign computer (such as the PC Transporterallowing an Apple II to also work as an MS-DOS computer). He also addressedissues involved in how to read and write MS-DOS disks on an Apple II, theuse of the Apple IIe card on a Macintosh Lc, and discussed early Apple IIemulation software.Syndicomm, Inc. was a company that Tom Weishaar and Kent Fillmore hadformed to manage the Apple II, Macintosh and PowerPC RoundTables on GEnie.It was designed to be separate from Resource Central. In early 1994,however, Weishaar and Fillmore decided that they did not want to continueto be responsible for operating the company, and elected to sell it to DeanEsmay, the chief sysop of the Apple II and PowerPC RoundTables.The April issue reproduced "The Apple II Led The Way", a post from an AOLuser (his true name unknown), who took a wistful look at many of the firststhat the Apple II pioneered.A regular addition to GEnieLamp A2 was the inclusion of ASCII art by SusieOviatt. Most of these were amazing pictures done entirely with charactersthat could be typed at the keyboard.GS Resources promoted their "II Infinitum!" T-shirts. (See the main page ofmy Apple II History site at http://apple2history.org for a button thatnicely shows the logo). They also included a text version of the IIInfinitum logo: ___________________________________________________|                                                   ||              ________________________             ||             |                        |            ||             |____      ____      ____|            ||        ********* |    |    |    | *********       ||     *************|    |    |  ****************    ||   *****        **|    |    ********        *****  ||  ****            |    |******** |            **** ||  ****            |    ******    |            **** ||  ****            | ********|    |            **** ||   *****        ********    |    |**        *****  ||     ***************   |    |    |*************    ||        *********_|    |____|    |_*********       ||             |                        |            ||             |________________________|            ||                                                   ||___________________________________________________|(Gotta love ASCII art, eh?)Phil Shapiro featured the disabled user in an article in October, where hediscussed Autism and the Apple II. He also addressed a different medicalproblem in another article, which reviewed the possible benefits of playingTetris for those suffering from acute attacks of asthma.HUMOR ONLINEA funny series of posts appeared in the A2 RT that expanded on the concept"If Operating Systems Ran Airlines" (which appeared in the February issue).(By the way, if anyone still has a transcript of the variations thatappeared for Apple DOS, ProDOS, GS/OS, etc, I would LOVE a copy; mine waslost years ago in a poof of bits on a damaged hard drive...). Other topicsincluded Politically Correct Computer Terminology, children's kitchenterms, and the ten laws of cartoon physics.Dean Esmay related a story about a disk that Syndicomm received from AppleComputer to use as a master to duplicate in distributing DOS 3.3 on GENieA2 (which was designated as a user group, and so had authorization todistribute it). This System Master disk from Apple, which included all ofthe official labels and envelopes as if it had been shipped with a newApple II, did NOT, however, contain the DOS 3.3 software. Instead, it was aCOPY of Locksmith, a classic program from the early 1980's for breakingcopy protection. So, not only did someone at Apple accidentally (?) copyLocksmith onto a DOS 3.3 System Master disk, but they put a CRACKED COPY ofLocksmith on the disk.STATSHere I have calculated for you some statistics for you about the firstthree years of GEnieLamp. The numbers refer to the size of each issue in"K" (kilobytes):Year    Min     Max     Avg----    ----    ----    ----1992    116K    212K    156K1993     80K    256K    172K     (the 80K issue here was the 2nd May 93 issue)1994    124K    216K    165KI'VE HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFEAs with the prior year, 1994 included many positive and some negativeevents in the Apple II world. Despite Apple's non-involvement with theApple II, we managed to continue to do what we had done for years: Takecare of ourselves. The GEnieLamp newsletter itself had matured under theconsistent editorship of Doug Cuff, as well as the talented authors thathelped him by contributing articles. Would 1995 be a better year? Join menext time for answers to this and other questions in our ongoing review ofGEnieLamp.Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.orgReferences for 1994 historical info:Apple Computer, Inc.: A History     http://www.geocities.com/Athens/3682/applehistory.htmlApple History Timeline     http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/history.htmlComputer History For 1990-2000     http://www.computerhope.com/history/19902000.htmHistory Of Hypertext Timeline     http://www.robotwisdom.com/web/timeline.htmlTimeline of the 90s, 1994     http://www.inthe90s.com/generated/time1994.shtml[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][TTC]-------------------------------             THE TINKERER'S CORNER |------------------------------------By Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>Constructing Your Own Printer Cable~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This project was inspired by a find in the local As-Is store... a wellcared for HP DeskJet 500C printer for $5.  It came with the user manual,the power supply, the software for PC DOS/Windows, and a parallel cable toconnect to the IBM/clone.The HP DeskJet 500C has both a parallel port and a serial port.  This opensup the possibility of keeping it connected to two computers and printingfrom either one at a time.Finding a cable to connect the IIgs printer port to the serial port of theprinter was proving difficult so I decided I could make my own.A Google search found the specifications for the necessary cable athttp://ground.ecn.uiowa.edu/apple2/MiscInfo/Cables/gsser.pinoutsThe same file can be found cached on Google athttp://www.google.com/search?q=cache:Y7a7yTwLPFgC:ground.ecn.uiowa.edu/apple2/MiscInfo/Cables/gsser.pinouts+imagewriter+cable+pinouts&hl=en&ie=UTF-8Material Used'''''''''''''1. Spare serial printer cable, Mini-Din-8 connector on both ends.2. (Radio Shack) DB-25 connector, male, designed for your own wiringproject.Procedure'''''''''1. Cut one end off the spare serial printer cable.2. Strip end of each wire in cable.3. Using continuity tester identify which pin each wire is connected to.4. Make the necessary connections to the DB-25 connector.5. Double check all connections.6. Finnish assembly of the DB-25 connector.7. Connect IIgs to the printer and test.The project was a success.

Roger Wagner is mentioned askeynote speaker but no mention of a roast.Here is my list of keynotes and roast victims:Year     Keynote           Roast==== ================  ================1989       ?                ?1990       ?                ?1991 Roger Wagner           ?1992 Tim Swihart **    Roger Wagner1993 Mike Westerfield  Tom Weishaar1994 Randy Brandt      Mike Westerfield1995 Roger Wagner      Steve Disbrow1996 Gary Utter        Joe Kohn1997 Dave Kerwood      Richard Bennett1998 Mike Westerfield  Tony Diaz1999 Max Jones         Ewen Wannop2000 Ryan Suenaga      Eric Shepherd2001 Eric Shepherd     Max Jones2002 Tony Diaz         Ryan Suenaga2003 Steve Wozniak     Geoff Weiss** In 1992 I'm not sure if Tom Weishaar or Tim Swihart is considered to bekeynote.

A truly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.Ryan Suenaga uses the years of experience he's had with the IIgs anddesktop publishing to discuss fonts on the Apple IIgs and to go into depthon publishing the last survivor of paper Apple II publications, Juiced.GS.Eric Shepherd shows aspiring Apple II programmers how to use the MPWprogramming environment on the Macintosh to program the IIgs.  Get tipsfrom the accomplished master programmerHoward Katz still uses an Apple IIe and is darned proud of it.  Join Howardas he shows how to use a UNIX "shell" account to cruise the InternetIIe-style.Eric Shepherd's "other" session shows you how to program for the PalmOS,and illustrates the surprising and sometimes striking similarities betweenthe leading PDA platform and the good old Apple II.Ryan Suenaga shows his mastery of the top dog in the Apple II emulationworld by showing newcomers how to set up Bernie ][ the Rescue, thevenerable Apple IIgs emulator for the classic Mac OS.Currently, Tony Diaz, Geoff Weiss, and Jay Edwards have "mystery" sessions.Will they reveal the mysteries before KansasFest?

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.[editor@juiced.gs]                         The KFest FAQ Version 4.0                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The following article is set up in a form commonly seen on theInternet, called Frequently Asked Questions.  It is designed to answer someof the most common questions people have about KansasFest, the Apple IIevent of the year.  It is not designed to answer general questions aboutthe Apple II, although there may be some overlap.     Any questions about this article can be sent via email toeditor@juiced.gs.Q: What's a FAQ, and how is it pronounced?A: The letters "FAQ" stand for _F_requently _A_sked _Q_uestions.  Whenpeople first hear of or learn of a subject, such as KansasFest, they oftenhave a number of questions which others before them had when they alsofirst learned of the same subject.  A FAQ is a document listing both thequestions and answers most frequently associated with new users, to savethemselves (and others trying to assist them) time and frustration.And by the way, it's pronounced "fack", nearly identical to "fact".Q: What is the purpose of this FAQ?A: This FAQ is set up to assist people interested in KansasFest, also knownas KFest.  Many Apple II enthusiasts are interested in attending or justwant some information about this event, so the most common questions areanswered here.Q: How can this FAQ be distributed?A: The content of this FAQ is copyright 1999-2003 by Ryan M. Suenaga.Distribute freely, provided the content is unchanged.Q: What is KFest?A: KansasFest, abbreviated "KFest", is a computing conference held everysummer at Avila College (now Avila University) in Kansas City, Missouri.Its original formal name was "The Apple II Summer Conference" while itsnickname was "KansasFest", which was abbreviated to "KFest".  Today, theconference's official name is "KansasFest".Q: When was the first KFest held?A: The first KansasFest was held in 1989.  It was originally sponsored byResource-Central, the folks who brought you the wonderful _Open-Apple_ and_A2-Central_ (among several other Apple II) publications.  AfterResource-Central became ICON, The Apple II Summer Conference becameICONference.  This lasted one summer until ICON shut down.  Two differentcompanies sponsored KFest before Intrec Software, publishers of _ProTERM_,took over a few years back.  This July will welcome the 15th KFest.Q: When is KFest this year?A: KansasFest 2003 runs from Tuesday through Sunday, July 22-27, 2003. Thevery popular early arrival day is now officially rolled into KansasFestproper.  Meals, however, will not be served at Avila until Wednesdaydinner.Q: Where is KFest held?A: KFest is held at Avila University in Kansas City, Missouri.  The addressand phone number are:     Avila University     11901 Wornall Road     Kansas City, Missouri  64145     United States of America     (816) 942-8400Q: If it's held in Missouri, why is it called KansasFest?A: I dunno.  It does take place in Kansas City, and if it makes you feelbetter, the Kansas border is very close to Avila University.Q: Who comes to KFest?A: While KFest was originally devoted to programmers, nowadays all kinds offolk from all over the world show up at Avila University.  Programmers,users, newsletter publishers, and everyday folk show up from Europe,Canada, Australia, and all over the United States to celebrate theApple II.Q: Who organizes KFest?A: Currently, KFest is organized by a committee headed by The Grand Gouda,Steve "Godzilla" Gozdziewski, who has taken over from The Big Cheese, CindyAdams.  Cindy remains on the committee.  The scheduling is done by TonyDiaz, of Alltech Electronics fame.  Tony also handles the maintenance ofthe World Wide Web site, Devin Reade maintains the email lists, and Eric"Sheppy" Shepherd provides World Wide Web hosting services and organizesHackFest, the programming contest.  KFest is sponsored by Jerry Cline ofIntrec Software.Q: How do I register for KFest?  How much does it cost?A: Depending on when you register, registration prices vary.  If youregister early, you'll get a better deal. Please check the KFest Home Pageathttp://www.kfest.org/for the most current information.  You can download the registration formin PDF format fromhttp://www.kfest.org/KFest2003Reg.pdfIf you cannot download the form or print a PDF file, please contact JerryCline at Intrec Software (contact information is elsewhere in this file)and he will send you a form by fax or postal mail.Q: How do I reach Intrec/Jerry?Jerry ClineInTrec Software, Inc.3035 E Topaz CirclePhoenix, AZ 85028-4423Voc:602/992-1345Fax:602/992-0232kfest@intrec.comQ: Which airport do I fly into and how do I get from there to Avila?A: The major airport nearly everyone flies into is Kansas CityInternational, which goes by the code letters MCI (not KCI, which will getyou to Indonesia).  There's a couple of small commuter airports which arecloser, but unless you're Tony Diaz (who flies his own plane), you're notlikely to use these.Even though MCI is the "closest" major airport, it's still most of anhour's drive from there to Avila, so walking is out of the question and cabfare would be substantial.  Your best bet would be to try and catch a ridewith another KFester who'll be flying in or passing by around the same timeyou'll be arriving.  Carl Knoblock unofficially organizes rides to and fromthe airport.  The best way to get in on the ride planning is to join theKFest email list (information on subscribing is elsewhere in thisdocument).Q: What kind of official activities go on at KFest?A: Officially, there is a keynote speech, sessions on various computingtopics, HackFest, a celebrity roast, product demonstrations, and a vendorfair.Q: Who is this year's roastee?A: Just announced by KFest Roast MC Ken Gagne: Geoff Weiss, author ofSpectrum Internet Suite and many other Apple IIgs programs, will be theguest of honor at this year's roast.Q: What if I want to host a session?A: Email sessions@apple2.org with your ideas for a session.  Sessions caninclude new ways to use programs, new programs, networking, or just aboutanything you can imagine.  Everyone has something they can teach.Q: What kind of unofficial activities go on at KFest?A: Unofficially, there's been movie outings, pizza nights, Bite The Bagcontests, late night eating at Denny's, runs out to Krispy Kreme, FloppyDisk Ninja, Apple II Jeopardy, and huge groups of folks going to eat hugepieces of beef at K.C. Masterpiece and Jess and Jim's restaurants.  Andthere's a new contest this year called "CansasFest", a homemade 802.11bantenna contest.Q: Has anyone attended every KFest?A: One person: Tony Diaz of Computer Circulation Center (formerly known asAlltech Electronics).Q: I hear that the Avila University dorm is wired for Ethernet.  Is there away I can access that while I'm there?A: Yes.  In each dorm room in the halls of Avila are two outlets that seemto be phone jacks.  These _aren't_ phone jacks.  They're Ethernet ports--tobe exact, they're RJ-45 connectors that are compatible with 10 Base-TEthernet.  The entire Avila dorm is connected to the Internet this way,making for high speed World Wide Web browsing, electronic mail, and ftpconnections for KansasFesters during their stay!    The Avila Ethernet uses a protocol called Dynamic Host ConfigurationProtocol, or DHCP, for short. Those of you who have set up TCP/IPconnections with Windows or Macintosh computers (or, for that matter, theApple IIgs) probably have some familiarity with inserting IP addresses, DNSaddresses, and Gateway addresses.  The beauty of DHCP is that it sets upnearly everything you need dynamically, meaning that the server assignsthese addresses--all you need to do is set up TCP/IP on your computer andchoose the DHCP protocol.     Regardless of which platform you use, if you have software set up toshare your hard drive with other computers, you probably ought to disableit--unless you like everyone in the Avila Ethernet having access to yourfiles.     At this point, you ought to be connected.  If you previously had anyproxy servers set up for use with your setup before Avila, disable them.You ought to have easy access for checking mail, browsing the Web, or usingfile transfer protocol--and very high speeds.  One last caveat:    As Spam on the Internet proliferates, it has become accepted practiceto close off an Internet Service Provider's mail sending server--usuallyusing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or smtp--to access from anyone who isnot directly connected to the ISP.  In other words, no one wants to be arelaying point for Spam.     Because of this, it's likely you will not be able to use the same smtpserver you use at home to send mail while at Avila.  There is, however, amail.avila.edu smtp server that can be used while at Avila.  That ought tokeep your email flowing freely.Q: I hear that there's wireless Internet access in the Avila dorm.  How doI get hooked up?A: Ah, the infamous wireless.  Several KFesters have set up Apple AirportBase Stations and other equivalents.  Please see one of them (Sean Fahey,Dain Neater, Eric Shepherd, and Ryan Suenaga are likely candidates) ifyou'd like to get on the wireless 'Net.Q: How can I learn more about KFest?A: You can get more information on KansasFest by visiting the KansasFestWorld Wide Web site at http://www.kfest.org/ or sending email tokfest-help@kfest.org.  You could also subscribe to the KFest mailing listby sending email to majordomo@kfest.org.  In the body of the email includethe text:     subscribe kfestYou will receive a confirmation email with instructions on finalizing yoursubscription.Q: Should I go to KFest?A: Need you ask?  KFest is a must for the serious Apple II fanatic.  Doyourself a favor--you're worth it.  Show up at KFest 2003, the summer campfor Apple Geeks.[EOA][VKF]FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THE KFest HOME PAGE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KFest Home Pagehttp://www.kfest.org/[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
