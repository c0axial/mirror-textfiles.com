Aftermonths of planning and hard work, KansasFest 10 is over, I'm exhausted, butI haven't had so much fun since, well, KansasFest 9.     Last year's KansasFest was revolutionary; 1998's was evolutionary.The debut of _Marinetti_ in 1997 took the Apple II places it never wentbefore--in 1998, instead of a breathtaking leap, we took lots of littlehops, and maybe got even farther than we did the year before.  _Marinetti2.0_, _Spectrum 2.2_, and _Spectrum Internet Suite 1.1_ repave the road tothe Internet their previous versions laid down.  _GSoft BASIC_ gives oldApplesoft programmers the tool they've waited their entire IIgs lives for._WebWorks GS_ and _NiftySpell_ give the IIgs user the kind of productsthey've needed to turn to other platforms to use.  And _Casper_, evenunfinished, proves again we have yet to reach the limits of what the AppleII can do.     There's not a lot left on my Apple II wish list (Tony, if you'rereading this: "ETHERNET!"), thanks to KFest '98, although my personal wishlist currently includes sleep, also thanks to KFest '98.                                [*] [*] [*]     And Now A Word From Our Sponsor Department: I talk about KansasFestalmost every month, but I promise that the Worldwide Headquarters of theKFest Blatant Plug Office will close down until December after this month'sissue.  However, before we close shop for 1998, we need to let you know:KansasFest 1999 is being planned for July 21-25, 1999, back at the campusof Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  Start planning now.     KansasFest also has a new home on the World Wide Web(http://www.kfest.org) and the KansasFest Mailing List previously mentionedin this publication will continue operating all year round.     I promise, you won't hear any more about KansasFest untilJanuary--unless you ask for it.Ryanthelamp@delphi.comASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][OPN]------------------------------     A FUNNY THING HAPPENED. . . . |-----------------------------------Checking out A2 on Delphi"""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

What makes the Monday night chat sospecial is that it takes place simultaneously on CompuServe, Delphi andGenie.The three system Apple II chat is probably the _only_ regularly scheduledmulti-system chat on the planet.As host of that chat, I was just thinking that all interested Apple IIusers will probably want to attend the chat that'll take place on Monday,July 27th, as that chat will occur just one day after KansasFest ends.As it is, there are a number of new Apple II products that are expected tobe demoed and/or released at KansasFest, but due to non-disclosureagreements, no one is yet talking about anything. By July 27th, thosenon-disclosure agreements will have lapsed, and so that Monday night chatshould be filled with talk of all the new software that is expected to bedemoed and/or released at Kfest '98.Although attending that chat won't quite be the same as attending Kfest'98, it'll be your chance to find out all about the latest and greatest!Mark your calendar now: Monday.

Thisis a complete TCP/IP implementation, not requiring an ISP with a shellaccount, or anything else unusual or hard to find.There are those who may not recognize what an accomplishment this reallyis. We all owe Richard a big vote of thanks for, first of all, doing the(almost) impossible, secondly for doing it as a labor of love in what bitof spare time he has available.Which is not to say that Ewen Wannop's contribution of Spectrum 2.2 isinsignificant. Without it, the new Marinetti is of limited utility. ButSpectrum 2.2 is fully Marinetti 2.0 aware. You can now open multiplesockets to multiple service locations at one time. You can do a whole lotmore than that, of course, but this capability of dealing with sockets atall is the foundation on which everything else rests. (Frankly, I'msurprised that Ewen only assigned a fractional upgrade number. I would havesaid v2.3 as an absolute minimum, and this new capability is SO significantthat I would have had to be persuaded not to call it v3.0.And, the icing on the cake is the latest version of Spectrum InternetSuite. Geoff Weiss demonstrated that (sorry Geoff, I don't recall theversion #) pretty extensively, and it too is awesome.Now I confess that I do most of my Internet browsing on the Mac, but thatstuff that I do on a daily basis is pretty much all text based. If Iunderstood everything in these three demos correctly, but upgrading my GSwith these latest enhancements, I am going to be able to save 30-60 minutesa day be reading my regular sites with the GS instead of the Mac.I'm REALLY looking forward to this. (All three of these products should beready for release in, approximately, September.)There was also talk of several other Internet utilities, and demos of mostof them. Unfortunately, it was dark, and I was sleepy, and I can't quiteremember who to credit for what, so I'll let someone else speak up with thenames and details.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Speaking of being tired, I overslept this morning, and missed JoeKohn's presentation, but Shareware Solutions has a MAJOR new utility forall us GS users, a "universal" spell check that works within any desktopapplication, if I heard it right. (I was stumbling out of the shower whenGreg Nelson came 'round telling me about it. Needless to say, he thought itwas very impressive.)Hey JOE, tell the rest of the world about your new goodie, eh?? :)Gary R.

We had a great turnout (more than lastyear by 10 percent), and some of the Apple II world's most active andproductive developers were on hand. What they showed us was nothing lessthan astounding.We now have several new programs, updates of old programs, and even moreprograms in the works. And they say this is a dead platform. :-)I'll post more of my impressions and observations when I get some rest andclear my head. But I wanted to let everyone know that, from my perspective,Kfest '98 was a fantastic show.Now, before I fall asleep at the keyboard, I'm going to check out thefollowing items I obtained Kfest '98: WebWorks GS (NEW!) Disk Access II (UPGRADE) GSoft BASIC (NEW) The TABBS Library Archive (NEW CD-ROM compilation from Ewen Wannop andavailable to the world from Joe Kohn's SSII) ShoeBox (A program from Seven Hills I just around to purchasing)Of course, before long, I hope you'll all join me in upgrading your systemswith: Marinetti 2.0 Spectrum 2.2 SIS 1.1 GraphicWriter III 2.1And I haven't even mentioned Nifty Spell, the universal spell checker forthe IIGS that was demoed at Kfest and will soon be available from SSII.That program is sure to generate a lot of interest. It's something we'veneeded for a long time.Man, this was an active Kfest for new stuff!!!Before I sign off for now, I want to thank Cindy Adams for managing anotherterrific event, and Steve Gozdziewski for putting together a greatschedule.

I don't know if I'll be able to keep my eyes open longenough to finish writing this message, but maybe I can type in my sleep...KFest '98 was a blast, as usual, but for some reason this year seemed likeeven more fun than the previous KFests I have attended. Maybe it wasbecause I finally got to meet Ewen Wannop (I roomed with him, in fact), ormaybe it was that little jaunt to the Italian restaurant with a few peoplewho wanted to try something other than Jess and Jim's for dinner (I'llleave the details of the car chases and the search for ice cream foranother time.) Perhaps it was playing Snood on Cindy's PowerBook. Orwatching Paul climb the walls (I think it was Paul...it's all a blur.)Yeah, all of the above.Wednesday. Gina and I drove down from Chicago. Hot, hot, hot. No airconditioning in the car so we drove under cover of night. We arrived in KCway too early so we camped out at Hardee's until noon. At registration Ireceived my annual hug from Cindy (the =real= highlight of KFest) and thenwent to the dorm to unpack. I got there before Ewen, my aforementionedroommate, so I grabbed the good bed and began unpacking my computer so Icould hog the whole desk. As people began trickling in, I gave up on thecomputer and started roaming the halls.It's hard to put into words the feelings I get each year at KFest. Isuppose it's similar to what you'd feel at a family reunion. After fourKFests I've begun to get downright chummy with some of these people who Ionly meet once a year. Anyway, Wednesday afternoon was spent reacquaintingmyself with old friends and meeting new ones. Wednesday afternoon shouldhave been spent sleeping but, yeah right.Wednesday night is the traditional trip to KC Masterpiece for dinner. Ithink the best way to enjoy this is to take pot luck on who you sit with.When a new table is announced (they don't take reservations so it takesquite a while to seat 40-50 people) just walk up there with whoever happensto be standing next to you (or sitting, if you're enjoying a cold drink atthe bar.) This is embarassing, but I just realized I can't remembereveryone at my table. Beat me over the head if I'm wrong, but I think itwas Sheppy, Ephraim Wall and Stan Marks. It was late and I was tired. Ithink I'm still digesting all that beef, btw.Wednesday night is usually a great time to wander around and talk toeveryone, but after the long drive I just collapsed at about 11:30.More later... ----------------------------------------------------- Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager [Delivered with Spectrum 2.1 and Crock O' Gold 2.5] -- "I do not fear computers.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Therewere three mid-morning sessions to choose from. Since I had overslept Idecided to attend Geoff Weiss' UNIX Shell Programming, mainly because itwas physically the closest to my room <g>. I would have liked to attendEwen Wannop's Spectrum Scripting session, but, well, ahem, maybe next year.Besides, I already mentioned that Ewen was my roommate so I saw enough ofhim anyway. :)Lunch was mostly digestable.

Updates of all three of these integratedprograms will be available later in the year.After supper (again, the less said the better), it was on to Mike's GSoftBASIC session.

One of theHackFest competitors later in the evening used it!Speaking of HackFest, it began shortly after supper. I think there werefour brave entrants in this programming marathon. If I'm not mistaken, eachof the four was using a different language: GSoft BASIC, C, Pascal andAssembly (or was that raw machine code, Geoff? <g>.) On Saturday it wasannounced that Michael Hackett had won. More on that later.One thing missing this year was Bite the Bag, possibly because it usuallyoccurs Thursday night at the same time as this year's HackFest. Oh well,maybe it will return next year.I spent the rest of Thursday night roaming the halls, going room to roomseeing what everyone was up to. I think this was when I got my first tasteof the game Snood on Cindy's Powerbook. This is certainly one of the mostmaddeningly addictive games I have ever played. I can only hope someonewill take up the challenge of creating a GS (or even 8-bit) version.At some point during the evening, Ewen found me in the hall and started toapologize for reformatting my hard drive. You see, he didn't bring acomputer so we shared mine. As he was booting my machine, he saw a messageon the screen about the hard drive being formatted. What he didn't know wasthat I have Bret Victor's Opening Line installed, which brings up a randompicture at every boot. This time happened to be the faux "hard driveformat" picture. A good chuckle was had by all, and hopefully no damage wasdone to Ewen's heart.Sleep finally overtook me around 3:30 am. ----------------------------------------------------- Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager [Delivered with Spectrum 2.1 and Crock O' Gold 2.5] -- Vice Versa:  Mafia controlled poetry...                        (TONYW1, 14554, GO COM A2)CAN ANYONE TELL ME JUST WHAT A BABELFISH IS?

Utter                         (UTTER, 13739, GO COM A2)MORE ON DELPHI DATABASE FILENAMES   Here's a (much) more in-depth"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   explanation of the "period" problem.Files have three names: Group name, download name, and internal name. Thegroup name is what you see when you look at a list of files. On Delphi,groups can contain multiple files so we need a separate download name foreach file within a group. Here in the A2 Forum, the download name willalways be the same as the group name because we don't allow more than onefile per group. Either of these two file names can have as many periods asyou want.The trouble comes with the internal name. This is the actual VMS filenamethat Delphi uses to store the file on disk. It's invisible to most peoplebecause it's not important unless you're a staff member. If you're curious,here's what one looks like: 03$SHAKE$SZILLA.1XBXYLook familiar? It's your recent upload. Delphi produces a unique filenameby combining the topic number, uploader, and filename. As you can see, hereis where we have that dreaded "X" instead of a period. There's nothing wecan do to change it. It's similar to the way ProDOS won't allow certaincharacters in its filenames.Are you still with me? Good. :)Now, if you have your telecom program strip the Binary II when you downloadfiles, you won't have to worry about that "X" because inside the Binary II(no matter how the BXY filename has been mangled by Delphi) is the originalShrinkIt (SHK) archive which will still have all the proper periods. Thetrouble comes when you don't strip off the Binary II during the download,either because you can't (ie. using an older telecom program or a Mac orPC) or because you just don't want to. You'll end up with a file namedSZILLA.1XBXY which will probably be treated as a binary (or text) file byyour telecom program. It won't have the proper filetype and that "X" willcause ShrinkIt to ignore the file in it's file dialogs (you have to "showall files" to see it.)So the "download name" is something of a misnomer. The actual name thatgets passed to your telecom program during a download is the internal name(just the filename part, not the topic or uploader.)Whew! That's a rather long-winded way to say: It's a VMS file namingproblem that can affect some downloaders. ----------------------------------------------------- Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager [Delivered with Spectrum 2.1 and Crock O' Gold 2.5] --                        (TONYW1, 14388, GO COM A2)DEALING WITH DELPHI'S POP MAIL   Let me try to explain the Delphi/POP mail""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   thing a little better. I only keep twofolders for my Delphi mail. By default new mail goes into NEWMAIL, andafter I read it it goes into MAIL. When I do all my mail reading fromDelphi's MAIL page, I get notified when I logon of any new mail (NEWMAILfolder) and each letter moves automatically to MAIL after I read it. Soafter reading my new mail, the NEWMAIL folder is empty and the MAIL foldercontains mail that I have already read (it gets deleted automatically aftera certain period of time.)Now, a different situation arises if I read my mail via POP3. New lettersstill go into the NEWMAIL folder, but they stay there after I have readthem via pop.delphi.com. They do not get automatically moved to MAIL. Butthey also do not appear "new" to Delphi because I don't get the "You have Xnew letters" message at logon. It seems that reading mail via POP3 somehowresets the new flag, but doesn't move the letters from NEWMAIL to MAIL.Am I making sense here?If I actually delete a letter, either from the Delphi MAIL page or fromPOP3, the letter does vanish from both sides. ----------------------------------------------------- Tony Ward, A2 Database Manager [Delivered with Spectrum 2.1 and Crock O' Gold 2.5] -- You made my day, now you have to lie in it.                        (TONYW1, 13745, GO COM A2)>>>>>   The POP3 protocol was intended for simple maildrops.

What I don't understand is how Delphi can somehow markmail in the NEWMAIL folder as having been read via POP3 but it can't thenmove that mail to the already-read MAIL folder. This is apparentlysomething that can only be done from the Delphi mail page.Let me phrase it another way. After I read mail via POP3 the mail is stillsitting in the NEWMAIL folder on Delphi, yet Delphi somehow knows that Ihave already read it. Why then can't Delphi automatically move the mailfrom NEWMAIL to MAIL? When I read a letter in NEWMAIL from Delphi's mailpage, the letter automatically gets moved to MAIL. Why isn't this done whenreading via POP3?This isn't a big deal.

(Which is what Delphi is using, btw.)  However, maybe I cananswer your question anyway. :)The NEWMAIL folder is where VMS puts the mail by default.  The mail programitself is responsible for moving the mail to MAIL after you read it.  Ofcourse, the POP3 server doesn't do this, so your read messages stay wherethey are.  Could the POP3 server have been written so that mail would getmoved?  I suppose, but with the X-Windows VMS mail program at least, youcan change the folder that read messages get moved to.

I use Pegasus Mail on my Win95machine and the e-mail client I am writing for the IIgs will also supportmultiple folders at some point.It all boils down to the fact that a POP3 server doesn't know anythingabout your folder for READ mail and as the other mail program you usewasn't the one to read the mail, it will not move it for you either.Jeff Blakeney                       (JBLAKENEY, 13780, GO COM A2)>>>>>   A little theory on how POP3 servers work: When the POP3 server"""""   reads your incoming mail box (username and password is accepted forauthentication), it scans the headers to figure where each message startsand stops.

The POP3 client reads header information of each message and looksfor the "Status: " header to determine if a message is read or not. If thisheader field is marked with a "R", then the message has been read beforeand the POP3 client will not retrieve the message. Otherwise, the POP3client retrieves the message and the POP3 server then automatically updatesthe Status: header with a "R" to mean it has now been read. The POP3 clientthen optionally sends a command to the server to delete the message toreduce disk space on the server. As soon as the POP3 connection is closed,the changes to the messages (deletes, read status, etc) are written back tothe incoming mailbox file.

Under _MS-DOS_, the PCT (can you say 'pretty neat trick'?) uses anyexternal Apple 3.5 drive connected to it as a 720K MFM drive, capable ofreading and writing (but not formatting, at least not well) 720K MFM MS-DOSdiskettes.

You need NOT be concerned with this if you use the_external_ Apple 3.5 drive.Remember, however, that you will still have to boot ProDOS from anotherdevice, such as your hard drive, or perhaps a 5.25" drive or ROMDisk, sincethe PCT has no boot ROM.I still marvel at how cool the PCT was/is.

I know that AWGS doesn't use TextEdit soI was wondering if this may be another quirk in TextEdit?)In summary,Appleworks 5.1  --- printing normalAppleworks GS   --- printing normal (one attempt)EgoEd or Teach  --- printing normal for page 1, abnormal beyond page 1.Any help would be appreciated!Paul.Paul Schultzschultp@delphi.comsent your way via Spectrum 2.1 and Crock O' Gold 2.5                        (SCHULTP, 14070, GO COM A2)>>>>>   You obviously knew what was causing the "tiny font" problem on your"""""   DJ500.

It's a great choice for anyone who knows Applesoft butwants to go beyond its limits, as well as any programmer who wants a fast,easy to use language for creating text, graphics or desktop applications onthe Apple IIGS.Here's a few early comments from some Apple II luminaries who have usedGSoft BASIC:------------GSoft BASIC feels like home to anyone who knows Applesoft, but its also anescalator that carries you up past anything that BASIC could do on a GSbefore.

For all orders received before August 31st,1998, you get GSoft BASIC for just $50, a $10 savings from the retail priceof just $60. Include $5 for shipping in the U.S. and Canada; contact thepublisher for shipping rates to other countries.Incidentally, our shipping rate of $5 is per order, not per product.

You can choose between anextended Applesoft-like environment that will feel comfortable to anyApplesoft programmer, but that includes extensions like RENUMBER and a fullscreen editor; or a version that runs from any ORCA compatible shell. (TheORCA shell is not included.) Either way, you can turn finished programsinto applications that launch from the Finder using a simple utility thatadds a run-time module to your BASIC program.GSoft BASIC has all of the extensions you'd expect from a modern BASIC,like optional line numbers, PRINT USING, LINE INPUT (no comma problems!),structured statements and true subroutines and functions. It can use all ofyour available memory, so you can write huge programs that use lots ofvariable space. Strings can be up to 32767 characters long, doubleprecision floating-point is available, and GSoft uses integer math forspeed, supporting both short and long integers.Unlike any other Apple IIGS BASIC, GSoft BASIC truly supports toolboxprogramming. Toolbox programming requires the use of pointers and records,something other BASICs don't have. GSoft BASIC has both.While GSoft BASIC is an interpreter, and doesn't link directly withcompiled and assembled programs, it still supports many of the popular ORCAprogramming tools. The Applesoft-like shell that comes with GSoft BASIC canuse any ORCA compatible editor; you get a version of GSoft BASIC that willwork from any ORCA compatible shell; GSoft BASIC works with ORCA/Debuggerand Splat!, as well as any other ORCA compatible debugger; and GSoft BASICsupports user tools for adding subroutines written in other languages.There are even samples of user tools written in assembly language.So whether you are an experienced programmer looking for an environment forquick prototyping or a BASIC programmer from way back who wants a familiarlanguage with all of the features you need to take advantage of the AppleIIGS, GSoft BASIC is a program you'll want to have for your Apple IIGS.Here are just some of the major features you'll find in GSoft BASIC:Language Features* Full access to the Apple IIGS Tools.* Write desktop programs, text programs or graphics programs that useQuickDraw without using the entire toolbox.* Define and access your own libraries using User Tools.* No fixed limit on program or variable space.* Optional line numbers.* Modern control statements, including:IF-THEN-ELSEDO-LOOPWHILE-WENDSELECT CASE* PRINT USING* LINE INPUT (For reading text with imbedded commas.)* Named subroutines and functions with passed parameters and localvariables.* Disk I/O commands.* Data types include SINGLE, INTEGER, LONG, DOUBLE, BYTE and STRING.Strings can be up to 32767 characters.* Create types with names for easier to read programs.* Supports records and pointers.* Dynamic memory commands, including ALLOCATE, DISPOSE and SIZEOF.* Loads Applesoft programs.

So, if you wanted, you could have one dictionary that includedonly words related to your occupation, and another one for computer terms.You can swap which custom dictionary you wanted to use, on the fly.Then again, user dictionaries will most probably always be much smallerthan the main dictionary, so even if you had just one custom dictionarywith a few thousand words, it's only going to take a few seconds to loadthat dictionary to memory.So yes, of course, Nifty Spell has user/custom dictionaries.Joe Kohn                       (JOE_KOHN, 14511, GO COM A2)<<<<<   If You Can Use A Mouse, You Can Spell Correctly!"""""Shareware Solutions II, in association with Chris Vavruska, is pleased toannounce NiftySpell, the first and only Universal Spell Checker for theApple IIGS computer.NiftySpell is a flexible and easy to use New Desk Accessory (NDA) thatautomatically loads whenever your system starts up. Once installed,NiftySpell adds a new menu item to the Apple Pull Down menu, and it can beaccessed from any standard Apple IIGS program that supports New DeskAccessories. With NiftySpell installed, you can spell check documents rightfrom your Finder Desktop or from within such diverse programs as Teach,Hermes, Freecell or HyperStudio.In addition to the NDA, there is also a special Spectrum XCMD included thatseamlessly integrates NiftySpell into the Spectrum telecommunicationsprogram, making it very convenient to spell check your outgoing e-mail andforum messages while using Spectrum or Crock O' Gold!With NiftySpell, you'll never again be embarrassed by sending out importantdocuments with spelling or typographical errors, and you'll always lookyour best in print when the words you use to convey your thoughts arespelled correctly.Before NiftySpell, only those who used expensive word processing or desktoppublishing software packages like AppleWorks, AppleWorks GS orGraphicWriter III could spell check their work. Now anyone has theconvenience of a spell checker within easy reach. If you can use a mouse,you can spell correctly!NiftySpell requires an Apple IIGS, System 6.0.1, and a hard disk drive.

Immediately after Sheppy's demo, Shareware Solutions II started toship WebWorks, and judging by the reaction of the Kfest audience, it lookslike Sheppy has another smash hit on his hands. SSII sold out all copies ofWebWorks GS that I brought to Kfest!WebWorks GS is available now, from Shareware Solutions II, for $20.WebWorks can import AppleWorks Classic documents, and can convert AW'sformatting commands into HTML formatting tags. If the AW word processingfile contains, for example, a 'centering' command, then WebWorks GS willrecreate the document using html's centering tag. It can import text andTeach as well.Once a document is loaded into WebWorks, all further manipulation and htmlgeneration can be accomplished using user friendly pull down menus and popup menus.Add colored text with your mouse.

But when he is back, he'll no doubt spend some time here answeringGSoft BASIC questions and letting everyone know how they can get it, etc.The beta test, which I observed as a lurker, was incredible to watch, andcontained some distinguished programmers, including Charlie Hartley, Eric(Sheppy) Shepherd, Jeff Blakeney, Richard Cain, Gareth Jones, and others.I am pleased to announce that Sheppy and I have reached an agreementwhereby he will write a series of articles about GSoft BASIC to bepublished in upcoming issues of Juiced.GS. The series will start with anintroductory piece in the next issue, due out in early September, and willcontinue for as long as we have GSoft related topics to explore and expoundupon.Sheppy is already experienced in GSoft BASIC and will be an excellentresource for those who want to try their hand at programming in a simpleyet powerful language, or those who have already dabbled some inprogramming and want to expand their skills.My appreciation goes out in advance to Sheppy for agreeing to join thegrowing team of Juiced.GS contributors. He is a welcome addition and willhelp the world's premier GS-specific magazine continue to fulfill itsmission to the Apple II world in 1999 and beyond. Max Jones, Juiced.GS http://www.wbwip.com/juiced.gs Delivered by Spectrum 2.1 and Crock O' Gold 2.5                       (JUICEDGS, 14572, GO COM A2)OLRIGHT! 3.1 RELEASED"""""""""""""""""""""                                OLRight!OLRight v3.1 has been uploaded to the Telecommunications topic of the A2Database.  Although intended as primarily a bugfix version, significantimprovements and changes have been made.I'd like to express my grateful appreciation to Ulrich Hausmann for thetime he took to notify me in detail of each problem that he encounteredwith installation and use of v3.0 of OLRight! - and the feature requeststhat he made. Thanks, Ulrich!Bug fixes include: - Kermit and Ymodem Batch now work for uploads. - Quit routines are more robust. - Login/Quit (online session followed by quit to launcher) now works. - Forum messages are now read in thread order. - In Setup/Forum <P>refs, choosing 'C' no longer aborts the script. - Retrieving DB topic lists now works as intended. - A bug in the use of the arrow keys to move between menus was fixed. - Mail is retrieved one letter at a time, to solve problems in retrieving   mail with EXTRACT /ALL TT - blocks of mail were disappearing into the   void.  I think this was a Delphi problem, but... - Added a work-around to nasty behavior by ANSITerm in the event of a   failed download while stripping Binary II.New Features and Improvements: - A completely rewritten Activities function, which lists the Forums youhave defined, and lets you choose which one to change or add to/remove fromthe active list.  From the resulting dialog, you can see exactly what isscheduled to be done for that Forum the next time you log on, add newactivities, delete existing activities, or edit certain items.  Forexample, from this panel you can add a new Forum message, edit the Forummessages that you have created, or delete the outgoing Forum messages.  Formail, you have the ability to postpone (and re-queue) sending letters youhave created, as well as deleting specific letters. - Any menu selection which requires a topic name will list the topics forthe Forum or DB, if you have retrieved the applicable list of topics. Topiclists for A2 are included in the setup. - OLRight! now comes with several Forums pre-configured. - The Setup/Forum <P>refs menu selection now displays which data files youhave already existing in your setup, and whether you have chosen toretrieve them. - The documentation for OLRight! functionality has all been moved to theHelp menu.  The OLRight.Dox file deals with installing, setting up, andlaunching OLRight! and lists some requirements, potential problems and bugsrelating to ANSITerm usage. - OLRight! now checks for messages as it starts up, and will process themautomatically.  This allows for cases where the user might drop out ofOLRight! and log off manually after receiving messages.  A companionaddition is a selection from the Online menu to split messages regardlessof your online status. - OLRight! now checks your online status when it starts up, and gives youthe option (if you are online) of going to the main menu, terminal mode,logging off, or going to Conference.  Companion changes in the quitroutines check for online status, ask for verification, and save yourconfiguration when you exit while online.  These changes allow you to dropcompletely out of OLRight! and ANSITerm while online, and resume where youleft off when you re-launch ANSITerm via the OLRight! startup script. - If OLRight! finds messages to split, it displays the contents of the logof the last online session.  This log contains entries for each onlineactivity that was performed, and (where practical) whether they weresuccessful and/or what kind of errors occurred.  In addition, it shows youhow many mail messages were waiting, and how many were actually split aftergoing offline.  It also shows you how many messages were retrieved fromeach Forum.  This function replaces the old log, which was continuouslyadded-to until deleted by the user.  It is now, like the banner log,replaced with each session. - Print routines for Mail and Forum messages have been replaced by a muchfaster routine, and this same routine has been added to the generic filereader, which means you can print help files, banner logs, session logs,conference logs, database logs, etc. - The Forum reader now has the capability to sent a mail message to theauthor of a Forum message. - The Mail reader now will start up at the message that you were readingwhen you finish and save a reply. - Mail and Forum messages now save address/header information in aseparate temporary file, rather than at the beginning of the body of thenote.  This prevents the user from making accidental changes to informationthat must have specific formatting to work in the scripts. Note thatchanges can be made to this information through the Setup/<A>ctivities menu(see above). - Added support under the Online menu for access to Delphi's FTP client. - Numerous cosmetic changes and script optimizations.Read Message 9192 for more information about OLRight! features, and replyto message 3077 if you want more information or would like to comment. - Don (IronTooth)Delivered by my ANSITerm off-line reader scripts...                         They're OLRight!                       (DZAHNISER, 13957, GO COM A2)                             BEST OF THE BEST                             """"""""""""""""14518 26-JUL 23:09 The Apple II Legacy     RE: KFest '98 (Re: Msg 3681)     From: CINDYADAMS   To: ALLOnce again, only a short year later, I'm sitting in the terminal at KCIwaiting for my flight back to real life, so it's time for me to type myreport of KFest.

In the meantime, I cangive you my take on your question (all theory, no practice - I have beenreading up on the ensoniq for later use myself):1.) There are apparently 2 ways to access the ensoniq: through the hardwareitself, or through toolbox calls. Apple strongly recommends using toolboxcalls.2.) If you want to access the hardware, be aware that the ensoniq and it's64k of DOC RAM (DOC = Digital Oscillator Chip) are not accessed directly,but through the registers of the SOUND GLU (GLU = General Logic Unit),which serves as an interface between the cpu, the DOC and the DOC RAM.3.) The Sound GLU has 4 registers:     a.) Sound Control register (address $C03C) which controls whether thecpu is accessing the internal registers of the DOC or the DOC RAM. It alsocontrols the Address Pointer registers AUTO INCREMENT.It is an 8 bit register:bit 7 = DOC busy flag  (1 = DOC busy, loop until clear)bit 6 = DOC or DOC RAM access flag (1 = DOC RAM, 0 = DOC)bit 5 = Address auto increment (1 = auto incrementing enabled)bit 4 = reserved, do not usebits 3-0 = Volume control ($0 is low, $F is high volume)     b.) Data register (address $C03D) which you use to load values intothe DOC registers (yes, the DOC has it's own set of registers) and to placevalues into the DOC RAM, depending on bit 6 above. Also an 8 bit register.     c.) Address Pointer registers (addresses $C03E for the low byte, $C03Ffor the high byte) two 8 bit registers that combine to make a 16 bitaddress to access the 64k of DOC RAM (when bit 6 above is 1) or one 8 bitregister when accessing the DOC (when bit 6 above is 0), $C03F beingignored when accessing the DOC. Additionally, if auto incrementing isenabled (bit 5 above is 1) for DOC RAM access, the registers contain theaddress of the NEXT byte of DOC RAM.4.) I'm not even going to get into the DOC, oscillators, generators, wavetables etc. etc. etc. because I've rambled enough about something I haven'tactually used myself ;o)My point being:1.) The easiest way to access the sound is through toolbox calls, soassembly language will be better than basic (although I've seen anannouncement from BYTE WORKS about a GS specific basic that will allowaccess to the toolbox here on Delphi)2.) You will NEED the toolbox reference books to use the toolbox callseffectively3.) If you want to access the hardware and bypass the tool calls, you willNEED the IIGS hardware reference manual.4.) Yes you can load more than one sound (create a wavetable) from disk andhave your program play them.5.) Left and right will require additional hardware i.e. a stereo card.good skill (luck is not for programmers ;o), when I read the books myselfit doesn't look at all impossible, but I wouldn't even try it without thereference manuals.HABANERO(all theory, no practice. anyone feel free to correct the above, ifnecessary ;o)                        (HABANERO, 1935, GO COM A2)>>>>>   It is possible to play sounds from within an Applesoft BASIC"""""   program but it would be a lot of work to figure it all out anddescribe it to you.You need to load the sound into memory somewhere and under BASIC.System,you don't have a lot of memory to play with.  However, you could alwaysload it in smaller chunks and either move it into the DOC RAM or intomemory above bank $01 but the latter requires Memory Manager calls as wellto be sure you don't overwrite anything in case BASIC.System was launchedfrom GS/OS.Once that is done then you can call FFStartSound to play the sound andreturn to the BASIC program.  However, if you do this then you also need toset up an interrupt routine that will accept the interrupt that getsgenerated when the sound is finished.  You might be able to disable allinterrupt generation from the Ensoniq, I can't remember off the top of myhead right now, and that would also solve that little problem.  But withoutthe interrupt, you can't keep track of how many sounds are currentlyplaying which can become a problem if you try to play more than 15 soundsat the same time.  Not likely from a BASIC program but possible.So my best advice to you would be to buy GSoft BASIC from the ByteWorks.This is a GS/OS based BASIC that is quite compatible with Applesoft so youcan convert your existing program to GSoft easily and then start adding allthe Toolbox calls that you want.  It would be easier to write your programand it would run under GS/OS like all good IIgs specific programs should.:) Jeff Blakeney - Dean of A2U in A2Pro on Delphi sent via COG v2.5, Spectrum v2.1 and a Linux box to here.                       (JBLAKENEY, 1940, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Here in the A2Pro library you should be able to find my AmperSound"""""   package; this is a batch of very simple & commands for doing verysimple sound on the IIgs, directly talking to the DOC.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                          KFEST X: THE GATHERING                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     I often use the term, "The Apple II Community," meaning the people whostill use and believe in the grand old girl after all these years, but fora lot of us, it's more like a family.  Just like family in different placesacross the globe, we keep in touch on a frequent basis with real andvirtual cards and letters, the occasional phone call, and once a year, theannual family reunion, known by several other names: The Apple II SummerConference, KansasFest, or, simply, KFest.     KFest 1998 was both like and unlike any other.  Just as we have inyears past, we stayed up all night and had fun all day.  We made newfriends and caught up with old ones.  We celebrated the past and plannedthe future.  And we left knowing once again, we'd be back.     If we didn't have enough to celebrate, KansasFest 1998 marked the 10thgathering of the Apple II faithful at Avila College in Kansas City,Missouri, and more than 20 years of Apple II computing.  Those two factsalone would be cause for celebration, but our devoted developers gave useven more reasons to smile.     KansasFest isn't the center of the Apple II calendar; it's more likeChristmas.  And just as the toy makers bring out their newest, hottestproducts just in time for the holiday season, the Apple II developersbrought to KansasFest a whole stockingload of new stuff for the Apple IIfaithful to drool over.     So, for those of you who weren't able for some reason to make it toApple II heaven this summer, here's a diary of my KFest travels:DAY -4   Instead of heading over to the Land of Ahhs straight from the""""""   islands on a Tuesday night and ending up exhausted in Kansas Cityon a Wednesday morning, I decided to add a day onto each end of my timeaway from the office and make a side trip over to the bay area ofCalifornia before and after KFest, to hang out with the Sheppys, aka EricShepherd and his wife Sarah.  Sheppy would be at KFest rooming with me, andI've stayed over with the two of them before, so it seemed like it would bea great way to rest up before KFest and have fun along the Yellow BrickRoad to Avila.     I got home late from the office on a Friday (not unusual) andfortunately had packed all of my things the night before with help from mymom (more on this later).  It was such a busy day at work the only thing Icould do as far as getting ready for KFest went was signing up for a newInternet account with Concentric.  I did this for three reasons: one, theywere a national provider with dialup access in Fremont (where Sheppy livedand I'd be staying for a few days) as well as Honolulu and Kansas City;two, my account at Kestrok, where I've based my Internet access for a fewyears, was destined to expire, and I'd decided to explore other directions;and three, they had a thirty day free trial.     I took a quick shower, packed my things into my sister's car, andbefore you know it, I was over at Honolulu International Airport with twobags, a box, and all of my Apple II dreams of KFest, wandering over to theUnited Airlines counter to check in.  I had to tell a little white liebefore getting on the plane, when the United clerk asked if my bags hadbeen with me since I packed them, but it was a little one, no harm done.     I'm not sure when Day -4 ended and Day -3 began; whenever it did, Iwas over the ocean on a flight into San Francisco International Airport.My PowerBook 1400, which I usually play with on airplanes, had a flakeymemory card which rendered it useless, so I spent the hours on the planereading a copy of _Sports Illustrated_ and thinking how unhappy Sheppywould be when he picked me up, since both times I've stayed with them, I'vecome in at some ungodly early hour (pre-6 a.m. California time) whichdefinitely didn't thrill him.DAY -3:   My first real, solid memories of Day -3 were when the plane"""""""   arrived at San Francisco International Airport and I lumbereddown the ramp to see Sheppy ready to pick me up.  We waited a few minutesfor my luggage to catch up and we were on our way.  Small talk in the carcentered around the flight and KFest upcoming--specifically about twoprojects Sheppy and I were working on together, one known as "AWP", whichwould be released at KFest as the Shareware Solutions II/Sheppyware productknown as _WebWorks GS_, which he programmed and I was on the beta team for;the other known as "Project KFO", which would also be unleashed on anunexpecting Apple II world at KansasFest.  Project KFO turned out to be thedebut of the KansasFest World Wide Website at http://www.kfest.org.  I haddiscussed doing it with Sheppy and David Kerwood, who was the Webmeister ofthe existing KFest Website, and we had made arrangements to host it onSheppy's server and have it ready for the world on the flip of a virtualswitch.     After arriving at the Sheppy's, a nap was in order.  It was a hot, hotday, and we spent virtually all of it indoors, other than grabbing theoccasional bite to eat.  Sheppy spent a lot of time printing out the_WebWorks GS_ manual (not so much working on it as printing it; for somereason, the printing was incredibly slow), and I marvelled at his cablemodem set up.  I also spent some time setting up the IIgs I had broughtwith me and manipulating my 1400 memory card to make it at least throughthe trip.  I also sent some email to three of our bay area Apple IIfriends, Greg Templeman (formerly of _SoftDisk GS_), Paul Parkhurst(_PMPFax_ and _ANSITerm_), and Joe Kohn (_Shareware Solutions II_) toremind them we had arranged to meet for a pre-KFest PizzaFest on Sundaynight.  I also checked my shopping list--I wanted to stop at Fry'sElectronics while I was in Fremont, and a friend at work had asked me toget some shaving cream from Victoria's Secret for her (don't even ask).  Iadded another thing to my list: I had left what I call "slippers" and therest of the United States apparently calls "flip flops" at home somewhere,and the thought of having to wear shoes while I was on vacation wasappalling--almost as bad as shaving while on vacation.     I also reclaimed a deodorant stick I had inadverdantly left at theSheppy's when I was there in January.     Sheppy had the manual about finished.  We spent a lot of time inDelphi A2 Conference that night (and the whole trip), speculating about thefun to be had in a matter of days.     We were a little worried about the inaugural HackFest, the all nightprogramming contest.  Only one person had expressed firm interest inentering.  Sheppy and Steve Gozdziewski had spent a lot of time working outthe HackFest details, and we were hoping things would improve.  We wouldnot be disappointed.DAY -2:   Day -2 was the day we went shopping.  I found my slippers while"""""""   Sheppy ran over to Kinko's to get things ready for his KFestsession and get the proofs for the _WebWorks GS_ manual done.  It wasn't ashot as the previous day, which was nice, but it was more than what I wasused to, so the mall's air conditioning was a welcome relief.  I got theshaving cream, and we made our way over to Fry's too, where I picked up anEthernet hub and some cables for my computing network at home, and I spentsome time hoping that somehow, someway, Apple II Ethernet for the rest ofus would come to pass at KFest.  It wasn't to be, sadly, but I still hope.     Later that night, Sarah, Sheppy, and I went over to meet Paul, Joe,and Greg for some pizza, and to talk about old times.  Greg and Paulweren't able to make KFest this year, but maybe again someday, maybe again.Joe brought his usual hype with him, and Sheppy gave him the original diskand manual for _WebWorks GS_.  We all had stories of KFests past and otherApple II lore to share, and we talked until well past midnight.  Joebrought over a couple of technical references to donate for HackFestprizes.     We were ready.DAY -1:   Monday was an uneventful day.  People were excited, though, both"""""""   in person and online.  Most of those coming from overseas werealready on the continent; for instance, Ewen Wannop had come over fromEngland and was hanging out over at Geoff Weiss's place, and RichardBennett had stayed a few days in San Diego with Tony Diaz but the two ofthem, along with Jack Kells, were already en route to K.C.     The Big Cheese herself, Cindy Adams, was already in the K.C. areastaying with friends.  The people who were driving had already left, or atleast started to pack, and those who were flying were packing as well.     In addition to those who had already registered, we found out thatAndrew Roughan of Australia, who usually shows up every other year, wascoming this year even though he came last, and Jeff Carr and Gary and SueUtter were last minute additions as well.     KFest last year, as fun as it was, was the smallest ever, which wasdefinitely a downer.  KFest this year was already bigger than last, and wehoped it would get even bigger.  We suspected there would be a whole bunchof new product announcements throughout as well.     Things were looking up.     I packed most of the things I had brought over to the Sheppy's for thevoyage to Avila.  Left some clothes behind so I could pack Joe's donatedHackFest prizes.  My bag must've weighed 50 pounds, and that didn't includethe box holding my GS RGB monitor.  I hoped I wouldn't be charged forexcessive baggage weight.Day 0:   Being part of the planning committee for the second year in a row,""""""   I decided it'd be wise to go into Kansas City a day early, so Ihad Sheppy drop me off at San Jose International Airport early Tuesdaymorning (he usually only despises me for a day or so).  I was second inline to someone working for a courier service to check in, and luckily,they didn't charge me for the weight of my bags.     As I noted previously, my PowerBook memory card was acting strangely,and it picked the time I was in the airport to die again.  If you haven'theard, it's standard procedure for airport security to stop anyone carryinga laptop computer onto a plane and ask them to start it up, just to makesure it's not a bomb or something, apparently.  With the memory card inthis shape, the PowerBook wouldn't start up!  So I went through the airporthoping that no one would stop me when I tried to get to the boarding area,and incredibly, no one did.  KFest Kharma was already with me.     After a brief stop in Denver, I ended up over in a familiarplace--Kansas City International Airport--with a familiar face--SteveGozdziewski--ready to pick me up.  He had arrived a few hours before I did,so he had picked up his rental car.  We got out onto the road to get overto the Fairfield Inn we'd be spending the night at, and check out Avila tosee if there was anything we could do to get ready.     Along the way, we also went ahead and picked up beverages for theHackFest, for as long as those guys would be coding, they'd need to havesomething to drink.  I didn't count how many cases there were, but therewere at least ten, and we were on the third floor of the hotel, so wemust've made four or five trips.  After that, there was no way I was goingto drag my fifty pound bag and GS RGB monitor upstairs for the night, so Ijust grabbed a change of clothes and my PowerBook from the car and lefteverything else in to bake in the K.C. sun.  There would be repercussionslater.     We found out later Cindy was staying in the same hotel we were.  StanMarks, also on the committee, was supposed to be at FairField too, butended up at Holiday Inn instead.  We checked in online, read the day'smail, and chatted a bit with Carl Knoblock, who had become the defacto ridearranger.  KFest eve was here.  In about 8 hours, we'd be in Apple IIheaven.DAY 1:   The day started by running down to the lobby of Fairfield to join""""""   up with The Big Cheese herself, Cindy Adams, to grab a few bitesto eat before we headed over to Avila.  We also had a few errands to run inthe meantime, like going over to OfficeMax to make some copies and get afew more nametag holders if we had more unknowns show up than we thought wewould.     The Avila Campus was famillar as you'd think it would be after fourtrips.  As happens every year, a few people showed up even before we did.They were so eager to begin KFesting they couldn't wait to check in!     I spent some time unloading the car and unpacking my gear.  Aftergetting all of the HackFest stuff out, I got my things out, only to be metwith. . . shaving cream?     Every year before I leave on vacation, my mother helps me pack mystuff, and every year, for some unknown reason, she packs shaving cream inmy bag.  I've never shaved on vacation before in my life, so I really don'tknow what it's for.  Only this year, the Kansas City heat that radiated inthe trunk of the rental car that I left the bag in overnight was apparentlyenough to have the shaving cream can explode.  It got into my clothes, mypapers, and my IIgs keyboard.  Sarah has nothing on me now--she had salsa,but I have shaving cream!     As the day progressed, I met up with old friends and got acquaintedwith new ones.  From first time KFesters like nineteen year old Ken Gagneto old buddies like Richard Bennett and Max Jones and the eternal Apple IIteenager, 84 year old Ephraim Wall, I was happy to be there.  I was homeagain.     The day was spent greeting newcomers, helping people into the dorm,and thinking about the dinner to come at K.C. Masterpiece.  Erick Wagner, alongtime KFest veteran, offered to drive me to lunch, and I was thrilled toaccept.     When I returned, my roommate Sheppy hadn't yet arrived, but a packageI was waiting for had.  Howard Katz, unable to make KFest this year, sentover a package for me to present to The Big Cheese herself.  The suspenseends at the roast.     In any case, my roomie still hadn't arrived.  He was to be on his waywith Joe Kohn via Carl.  This was the first year we had an actual mailinglist going for the general public covering issues of KFest, and it wasthere that all of the ride coordination was done.  It was a monstrous job,but Carl took care of it with great efficiency, and got Sheppy and Joe overin lots of time to sign in.  I tried to figure out which was "the good bed"(they were both equally dorm-quality) and proceeded to work on setting upmy IIgs, getting the shaving cream out of my clothes, and getting myPowerBook hooked up to the dorm's Ethernet (a total walk in the park,really), all of which were done before dinnertime.  In the meantime, Ispent a lot of time talking up the HackFest, trying to get participants.We had some great prizes: The ByteWorks offered the product of the winner'schoice and _Juiced.GS_ was giving $50 cash to the winner of the HackFest,and Joe Kohn donated some prizes as well as Dean Nichols.  In fact, I spentso much time talking about HackFest and trying to get people to enter Ithought it was about to be renamed HypeFest.  But it was dinner time, so Icaught a ride with Uncle Duck, aka Dave Johnson, with Ken Gagne in tow, andoff we went to K.C. Masterpiece.     Now, Honolulu's a tourist town, so I can pick out touristy places amile away, and make no mistakes about it, K.C.M. is a touristy place.  Thatdoesn't mean it's not a pretty decent eating place too.  Going to K.C.M.with such a large group guarantees you won't be sitting with everyone, sojust sit with whomever.  I had a very mixed bag this year: MargaretAnderson, Glen Gunselman, and Ewen Wannop.  Ewen was good enough to informus of the latest happennings with Mad Cow Disease on that side of the pond.Just what I want to hear with my prime rib. . .     After dinner and a detour to CompUSA and Best Buy, where Dave stockedup on coffee supplies and removable hard drives, we returned to the dormsof Avila to make small talk and catch up with all of the gang we didn't sitat dinner with.  Talking, wandering, and laughing, and just like always,the next thing you know, it's 3 a.m.  It was time to catch the rare momentsof sleep associated with Avila.DAY 2:   Since my body was better adjusted to mainland time than it's ever""""""   been, I decided I'd try to make Avila breakfasts for the firsttime ever.  Avila isn't exactly revered for its food (sorry Richard), butcereal and milk is usually cereal and milk, although eggs and bacon aren'talways eggs and bacon.  I swear though: if Avila really needs one thing,it's a sushi bar.     The first official activity of KFest was Mike Westerfield's keynoteaddress, but before that, we had a series of announcements, including mine.I carefully unwrapped the banner I had prepared over at Sheppy's andunwrapped it to show everyone what I had to announce:     http://www.kfest.org     To the applause of the KansasFest faithful, the kfest.org domain wasreality.     Going back to Mike Westerfield: as one of the remaining Apple IIgsdevelopers, Mike has been with the Apple II through good times and bad, andhe gave us a tour through the history of both the Apple II and personalcomputing through his own experiences of programming, which was never whathe set out to do in the first place, and the adventures of softwarepublishing, which was also never what he set out to do in the first place.A variation on a story many of us had heard over and over again--AppleComputer, Inc., had spoken to Mike very concerned about a program he haddone early in the lifespan of the IIgs: a program "switcher", what wasknown back then as a precursor to what MacHeads called "MultiFinder".Their concern?  "You're not supposed to be able to do that on an Apple II."     While there were both great times and not so great times, Mike and hiscompany, The ByteWorks, have persevered all the way through.  And aftermore than a year in development, Mike proudly released _GSoft BASIC_, thelong awaited Apple IIgs-specific compiled BASIC programming language thatwould-be-programmers have waited their entire Apple IIgs lives for, to wildapplause and a waiting line of customers.     The rest of the day presented tough choices.  Do you learn about UNIXwith Geoff Weiss or do you figure out the first steps in scripting_Spectrum_ from Ewen Wannop?  Do you see the hot new stuff coming fromSeven Hills Software or do you see how Dave Carey creates those incredible_PrintShop GS_ signs?  Tough choices all around.  I managed to see Ewen'sdiscussion of the extensive _Spectrum_ scripting language, then SevenHills' Three Stooges of Software, aka Richard Bennett, Ewen Wannop, andGeoff Weiss gave a preview of what was new for the IIgs faithful.     For starters, there's a new version of _Disk Access II_, 2.0.  Thislittle New Desk Accessory brings nearly all of the functionality of theFinder to any GS desktop program, so you can manipulate files and disksfrom virtually any IIgs program.  Ewen did the last bit of cleaning up ofthe program and, best of all, it's available immediately.     Richard showed off _Marinetti 2.0_, which was a whole lot more thanmost of us were expecting (1.1 was what we had in mind).  In addition tothe ability to use SLIP and PPP, the new version features a modular designwhich will allow "dropping in" modules to allow compatibility with otherprotocols (such as AppleTalk), and support for Domain Name Resolution (DNS)which will allow you to telnet to delphi.com, for instance, rather than199.93.4.65.  Talk about making life simpler!  _Marinetti 2.0_'s not quiteready for prime time, but soon. . . just wait.     Not to be outdone, Ewen showed off a new version of his incredibleApple IIgs-specific telecommunications program, _Spectrum_.  Not yet sureif it would be _Spectrum 2.2_ or _Spectrum 3.0_ (or, as was joked,_Spectrum 98_), it includes full support for TCP/IP through the _Marinetti_Control Panel.  It will also include more scripting commands than thealready loaded _Spectrum 2.0_.     Finally, Geoff showed off _Spectrum Internet Suite 1.1_, his upgradeto the only Apple IIgs-specific World Wide Web browser.  This upgrade gives_SIS_ the ability to use Delphi as a host in addition to most UNIX basedInternet Service Providers and Genie.  It also supports cookies andimproves on its email and bookmark support, among other things.     In the "Yet-to-be-finished" department, Geoff gave us a glimpse at hisUNIX-like File Transfer Protocol (ftp) client program, and Richard gave usa quick look at "Casper", an in-progress Apple IIgs World Wide Web server.Yes, that's right.  An Apple IIgs World Wide Web server.     As we headed off to dinner in the Avila Cafeteria, we digested thatonce again, we had been shown the impossible: the Apple II could do what noone ever thought could be done.     Following dinner, it was off to see a solo session: Mike Westerfieldon _GSoft BASIC_, where he showed off the fantastic features of thisexciting new language.  However, the time I could spend there was short: weneeded to get ready for HackFest.  We were without the tables the Avilastaff had promised us, so we improvised, adapted, and overcame: we neededtables, we got tables.  The Marine Corps has nothing on a dedicatedKFester.  And after talking up HackFest, we got what we wanted: morecontestants.  Four brave Apple II souls decided to try their hand atprogramming in the all-night affair, and as they hacked away, the rest ofus watched in awe, wandered the halls, and met up with old friends and new.Sleep came early, for KFest, anyway: 2 a.m.DAY 3:   Why yes, Virginia, there is a KFest breakfast.  For the second day""""""   in a row, I made it over to the cafeteria.  Of course, KFestbreakfast isn't anything to write home about, other than to intrigue EwenWannop, who apparently hadn't seen blue breakfast food before.  Fruit Loopscan be the most amazing thing to the uninitiated.     I split time between two early sessions, where I heard Apple Computer,Inc.'s Kurt Ackman discussing the coming iMac, and Joe Kohn discuss thecoming Apple IIgs spellchecker, _NiftySpell_.  Chris Vavruska, a buddingIIgs programmer, has done a great job with this little wonder which willgive Apple IIgs writers the kind of power they've not had before with suchstandby text editors as _EgoEd_, _Wordworks Pro_, or _Hermes_.     A little later, Richard Bennett and Geoff Weiss were at it again, thistime discussing programming for the upcoming _Marinetti 2.0_.  Richardplans to have programming documentation ready to go when the new version isreleased.  On the whole, it appears that _Marinetti_-friendly applicationswill be easy to write, and based on what was released for the original 1.0version, tight, fast, and highly functional applications will be the norm.Unfortunately, applications which work with 1.0 will have to be modified towork with version 2.0, but the changes ought to be easily made.     Following another less than memorable Avila meal, Tony Diaz gave awhiz bang session on disassembling and servicing Apple 3.5 Drives, thecommon floppy drive attached to the Apple IIgs.  Complete with visual aids,Tony is making the information on servicing available at the home of theApple II images, http://www.apple2.org.  There is probably no greaterauthority on rebuilding Apple II disk drives than Tony Diaz, who can do onein his sleep by now.     The last sessions I attended for the day were a quick look at SevenHills Software's new _BabelFish_, _Disk Access II_, and _GraphicWriter III_versions hosted by Ewen and Richard, followed by Sheppy showing off the_BeOS_.  While not Apple II oriented (other than a quick showing of_Be_rnie, the _BeOS_ version of _Bernie ][ The Rescue_), the Be session wasindeed a wower, showing off the many multimedia capabilities of the upstartoperating system.     Finally, it was time for the KFest Banquet.  This year we ran severalcontests in collaboration with KFest, including the DoorSignFest andTieFest.  Winners of these were KFest newcomer "Hot Pepper" Dave Carey, themaster of _Print Shop GS_, and Kansas City's own Allen Moore.  Followingthose announcements came the HackFest winners, which you can look up inother sections of this issue.  After the downing of the Friday night dinnerand before the roast actually began came a couple of mini-traditions,interrupted by a gift presentation: the first tradition being the annualpresentation of the birthday card to the Big Cheese, Cindy Adams, byveteran KFester Erick Wagner, and the second tradition being theannouncement that a KansasFest 1999 is being planned for Avila College inKansas City, Missouri from July 21-25.  The gift presentation was HowardKatz's gift of big cheese to the Big Cheese: a pair of cheesey earrings shecould wear with her Cheesehead hat.     The victim of honor for this year's roast was none other than TonyDiaz, Alltech Electronics' (and Termites'?) Disciple of Dremel.  Roastersincluded Sheppy (who quoted Tony as saying, "I have to take out my vacuumand download these websites from my ceiling."), Richard Bennett (who riskedlife and limb by participating, as Tony was his lift home) assisted byfellow Aussie Andrew Roughan, Paul Zaleski (ask him about the "RISK Mac"and golf balls), and led by Joe Kohn (who never met an Apple II he didn'tlike).     The group split up for the night, some heading over to a movie, someparticipating in an impromptu late night talent show, some trying to grab 3am food at Denny's (and failing miserably), and some just cruising thehalls.DAY 4:   The second to last breakfast at KFest was followed promptly by""""""   some great demos.  Martin Landhange, a first time KFester fromEurope, showed us how to take best advantage of SSII's and Brutal Deluxe's_Convert 3200_ graphics conversion program.  Martin was followed by a quickshowing by Tony Diaz, who showed off a new Second Sight friendly version of_Cogito_, this one in mind boggling color, followed by a new, 1.0 releaseof _Digital Session_, the announcement that only a few _SoundMeister_ cardsremained at Alltech and once they were gone, there would be no more, andfinally, the confirmed reclassification of a few old programs, including_Super TaxMan_, the _Pac Man_ clone from the early 1980's, to freewarestatus.     Following Tony, Sheppy and Joe Kohn combined to show off the new_WebWorks GS_ HTML editor.  (Wow, is there enough new stuff at this KFest?)Sheppy also presented the _Wolfenstein 3D Beta Tester Awards_, for those ofus who had gone through the intense last few weeks of beta testing for themost eagerly anticipated Apple IIgs game in history.  The history behindthese awards is too long to go into here--use your imagination:     Dan Krass: The Web Banner Plaque of Honor     David Miller: The ProTERM Mac Can Do It Citation     Ken Gagne: The "Hey, It Crashes Bernie" Certificate     Kirk Mitchell: The "Boy, Is This Fast on My G3" Award     Ryan Suenaga: The Floppy Disk Loaner Citation of Valor     Tony Diaz: The Last-Minute Crisis Award of Merit     Tony Ward: The Custom Scenario Proponent Citation     After the demos, we had lunch, then the vendor fair, where Apple IIvendors did brisk business and we all got to hang out for a few moreprecious hours.  I spent a lot of time representing F.E. Systems andselling some _Bernie ][ The Rescue_ registrations in between talking withMax Jones as he welcomed one friend for life after another.  That night weheaded out to Jess and Jim's for a huge steak dinner.  Then it was time tostart saying goodbye as people started heading for home.  KFest was endingtoo soon, but there were still a few hours.DAY 5:   Checkout.  Avila's no palace, but for a few days each summer, it's""""""   the only place in the world I want to be.  I handed my keys overreluctantly, not knowing when I'll return, but even without the keys, mymind holds the memories that can't be taken.     After watching some, uh, unique games in the dorm, and saying ourgoodbyes, Steve, Loren, and I ran for lunch at ChiChi's and made a stop atComputer City.  When Steve dropped me at my airline terminal, I checked in,looked for a quiet spot, since it was several hours before my flight wouldleave, then whipped out my PowerBook, praying the memory card wasn't doneyet.  It wasn't.  I then started to type:     "This editorial is being composed as I sit in the terminal of KansasCity International Airport. . .
