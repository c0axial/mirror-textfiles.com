Since Silvern requires a 3.5" disk image at a minimum, Idon't know how anybody could play it with AppleWin.  Now AppleWin v1.12.6.0allows hard drive images, so you could fake it using an 800K disk image asyour hard drive image, but this is very difficult to figure out for mostpeople.Other emulators like KEGS support 800K disk images directly, but even so,you still need to supply PRODOS to get a bootable image, and if you want toupgrade and keep your current characters as opposed to just getting a newinstallation, you need GShrinkit or the classic version as well (or insteadyou could use the finder or another copy program to transfer yourcharacters).However, I prefer to use larger hard drive images because newer featureslike the instant automap coming out with the v8.4 update will require moreroom to store all 3 scenario's worth of automap pictures.So let me know if you need an 800K disk image for KEGS, or a hard driveimage for AppleWin v1.12.6.0 or KEGS (either 1.5MB, or any size youspecify).-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 161)>>>>>"""""Btw, what is the status of distributing these programs?PRODOSBASIC.SYSTEMSHRINKIT (the 8-bit version)(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 162)>>>>>""""">> PRODOS>> BASIC.SYSTEM>> SHRINKIT (the 8-bit version)I don't think there are any issues with the first two; ShrinkIt, too,should be okay, as a freeware title.Jeff, if you'd like to make disk images available for download, let meknow, and we can arrange for them to be posted on A2Central.com.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 163)>>>>>"""""Sheppy has posted a 1.5MB hard drive image of Silvern Castle that is usableby KEGS, AppleWin, and probably most other emulators over on A2Central.com.Hopefully everyone who's asked for a disk image usable with their emulatorin the past find it useful.I tested it with KEGS v0.91 and AppleWin v1.12.6.0, if your emulator isn'tlisted, let me know if there is any problems and what disk image yourequire.I will make future Silvern Castle updates available as shrinkit archives asbefore as well as these hard drive images.-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 164)[EOA][CSC]COMMENTS ON Silvern Castle v8.3"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hey Jeff.  I'm going through 8.3I haven't used this since about 7.4.My guys are getting killed and I don't have the money to resurrect them.Am I forgetting?  It seems there is little money i this game.  I recallgetting more loot in the field.I turned off copper and silver coins, this seems too much detail.  So whenI get loot on level one I get listed all these coins often adding up to agp, but then I'm told the coins are worthless.  If the coins are worthless,then don't list them.  I do not want to know what I threw away.  I recentlygot coins that added up to over 5 gp but again my party threw them allaway.  It would seem you can't have it both ways, either I get 5 gp orthings should not be listed at all.Even with copper and silver turned off you know their presence.  I guess Icould fool with them but them you need the dpockets spell to help withencumbrance.  It may be fun to program but I'd rather just know it's tooheavy or not.  It's too much detail.(BBAKER, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 156)>>>>>"""""Well, I said all the negative stuff.   But for the positive, I love thisgame on a simulator.  I got the speed working now so the maps just zipsopen when I need it.  The game moves pretty fast even at regular Apple 2espeed.BTW: If you can search for secret doors in this game I've forgotten how.Thanks Jeff for helping me get this simulation on the applewin going andfor providing the 8.3 in a hard drive image.(BBAKER, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 157)>>>>>"""""Hi Bruce!I like the detail when getting loot, but I see your point.  What I shoulddo in the next release is when you set the preference for loot to berestricted to gold pieces only, it should display a simple message withoutthe detail.If you don't like encumbrance, turn the feature off in the preferences.To search for secret doors the hard way, walk into a wall; if there's asecret door, you'll go through.  The easy way is to cast magical light.I find compared to the original release that the first few levels now areway too easy-looks like you been relying too much on your super charactersbefore now!BTW, have you had any luck getting your super characters back in the game?-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 158)>>>>>"""""Hi Jeff,Well, I'll use the super characters on my Apple II on the emulator I've gotcharacters named after Kfest conferees.  heheFor now it's been interesting to use normal guys.Right now I've got a group of mostly level four guys on level two.  I'm notsure its too easy.But I'm still griping about the money routine.  It has serious problem,IMO.  I just beat a big group and had 32 gp of coin but each guy got 3 gpmaybe.  The extra just gets cut.  If I use gp only I should get the whole32.  This is truly weird.I guess you have spent a lot of time on the other way to play.  But if weget a choice the gp only needs some attention.Now to change my job description (from fighter to fighter) we have to paymoney.  That's new isn't it.  But I'm bummed that the only way to get moneyis to sell stuff and that is pretty slow.  I have trouble buying spells, Ican't afford to resurrect my dead guys.BTW I have two guys described as "out".  I thought I carried them back tothe inn.  Well, I know I did.Enough for now.Bruce(BBAKER, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 159)>>>>>"""""Well maybe the whole loot display needs a little more explanation.Right now, the loot display always shows the total loot found, includingall gold, silver, and copper pieces.  When you set the preference torestrict loot to gp, only the gp is taken by your party.  The sp & cp isleft behind.  This could be why you see you found the sum of 32gp, but onlygot 3gp per character-if you look closely you probably found only 18individual gp total, the rest of the sum was probably sp & cp.If you think you should get all of the loot in gp, that would be a bit outof line IMO.  Don't expect low-level monsters to carry much gp.Now I recommend with low-level parties that you turn off the restrict lootto gp preference, and also turn off the encumbrance preference if you like.The restrict gp preference is really only for parties on the higher mazelevels anyway to automatically skip picking up the cp & sp.The next release will at least skip showing all sp & cp when the restrictloot preference is set to gp to avoid this misunderstanding.The best way to acquire loot is in lair chests.  Don't expect to get richknocking off wandering groups of orcs & zombies!To change class has always cost money, the only thing different is now youget to keep all your spells (even if you change from mage to cleric orfighter, although you have to wait until level 20-25 to cast spells as afighter).The only way to get characters to show as OUT is if you assembled a partyfor the first time, or after disbanding previously, and you exit SilvernCastle without saving the game.  Characters who are OUT can be recovered atthe guild.The only thing to say about whether Silvern Castle is too easy or too harddepends on who's playing.  One person who contacted me recently thinks thegame is extremely easy!  You say it's too hard.  Now compared to v1.0 thegame is much easier.  I think you got so used to your super charactersbowling over any opposition you forgot to play defensively with weakercharacters! :)My advice is not to attempt level 2 until all your characters are over20hp, or at least the front 3 can protect the back 3.BTW, did you discover the Proving Grounds in the Tavern?  This allows youto swap ability skills or for hit points.  You might want to try it.Hope this helps,Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 160)>>>>>"""""THis is great making a ready to use SC for emulators.  I am loving mine.Jeff, I did have to remember for a while but no the fighting is not toohard.  It may be too easy.  I've been saving a lot but have not had toreboot in a while.  I am currently running a group that is mostly up toeight on level five.  I run into a lot of level three and four guys, evenlevel 2 guys.  I figured I'd find mostly level five guys.But lairs are still disappointing.  I am now running with small coins w/oencumbrances.  Lairs might give 35 gp (the equivalent).  I ran into onelair, spiders I think, that had no chest at all.I just don't remember the loot being this paltry.  Was it really?  I thinkone thing that I remember you said you changed was that the probability ofgetting great loot is now much less.  Tell me about it.  Even on level fiveI'm getting mostly leather, sm shields, and torches.  Where are the greatartifacts that I cannot identify until my cleric is level 15 or so?  So farI've seen nothing over +1 and precious few of those.That's what seems drastically different: the loot.  How long has it beenlike this? I guess with at least four guys equipped with something socolossal that they never have to attack twice I didn't not notice thechange.Bruce(BBAKER, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 165)>>>>>""""">> I just don't remember the loot being this paltry.  Was it really? <<Well the original v1.0 release would give out enchanted stuff fairlyliberally, sometimes up to +32.  Even gold was doled out like there was notomorrow.

Then use CiderPress to add these shrinkit filesto the hard drive image.  Even though CiderPress can open shrinkit filesdirectly, I still find it easier to use GShrinkit directly from theemulated GS to unpack.Of course, to get GShrinkit and GS/OS initially required me to make an 800Kdisk image of the System 6.0.1 boot disk.  Then I used CiderPress to unpackGShrinkit to one of the hard drive images.  Once I can boot GS/OS, I canthen use GShrinkit to unpack my full GS/OS system folder.  At that point Ican boot my hard drive image with my full GS/OS system instead of thelimited 800K GS/OS boot disk.It took about 2-3 days to transfer everything (about 100MB) worthtransferring.  I didn't see much need to copy some programs like AppleWorksGS which are very buggy.  I mean the only reason I use APW GS is to getnice 2-3 columns printouts of text files.

For one, SC messagedelays are coded with assembly using a scalable delay loop around thefirmware WAIT routine; in KEGS the delay time seems to always run at 1Mhzwhereas in AppleWin it runs at the fastest speed; this has forced me toincrease the highest delay value to 65,500 just to keep messages fromscrolling by too fast.Since AppleWin and KEGS both use the same disk images I use the same harddrive images with both.
