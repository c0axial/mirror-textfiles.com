That brings to mind thedog we had back on the farm.     A farm is a great place for a dog... plenty of room to run... lots ofthings for a dog to do.  No need to keep it on a leash or in a pen.  And awell trained dog is a great asset to have around the farm.     Duties of our dog included... get the cows from the pasture at milkingtime... carry messages to and from the fields... announce visitors arrivingat the farmstead... let strangers know that any foul play at the farm wouldhave consequences... entertain the children with standard tricks such as'roll over' and 'beg'.     There was also time for the dog to indulge himself with his ownactivities.  Chasing rabbits.  Chasing cars and trucks down the road.                       The Well Trained Apple II Dog                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     In Apple II land we have a well trained dog called Bernie ][ TheRescue.

It canwork with any remote computer running VNC server software, which isavailable for a wide variety of popular platforms, including Mac OS X, MacOS 9, Microsoft Windows, and *nix systems using the X Window System.Uploaded by the author, Stephen Heumann.Tony Ward, A2 Librarian(2.TONY,Cat 2, Top 37, Msg 33)[EOA][VNC]VIRTUAL NETWORK COMPUTING ON THE Apple II"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I downloaded VNCview.GS and I have to say that I am really impressed by it.I installed a VNC server on a Windows machine and was able to connect to itfrom VNCview.GS with no problems.I have put up a screen shot of Internet Explorer running:     http://www.syndicomm.com/~geoff/vncgsscreen.gifThis was within minutes after connecting for the first time--I was usingthe GS 320x200 resolution.Here is another screen shot of VNCview.GS running KEGS on the windows box:     http://www.syndicomm.com/~geoff/vncgsscreen2.gifSetting up a VNC server was easy--I adjusted the configuration as neededand activated it.  And on the VNCview.GS side, after making sure I typed inthe correct password, I was able to control my Windows box.  For softwarethat is labeled alpha, I found it to work correctly with the first attemptof use.  It properly downsized the 1600x1200x24bit desktop into 2bit/4bitnative GS resolution modes.I have often heard remarks such as "I wonder what it would be like to runNetscape on an Apple IIgs".  Well, with VNCview.GS, this is now apossibility.Kudos to Stephen Heumann for adding a new remote connectivity option notavailable before on an Apple II.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 11, Top 37, Msg 1)>>>>>"""""I haven't tried it yet, but you can bet I'm going to.

A nifty piece of programming.Thanks for this software!!Dain Neater(A2.DAIN, Cat 11, Top 37, Msg 3)>>>>>"""""I haven't seen it crash on me at all.  I can get it to hang on a regularbasis.  It just means different area of memory is getting corrupted whichgenerates different results.It will hang if I switch resolution or color depth if connected to the VNCserver.  Good advice is to close your connection to the VNC server beforemaking such changes.Any other time is not 100% reproducible. My system isn't the best fortesting.  I have made changes to the LanceGS link layer driver that I useand I haven't fully tested it to determine that the driver is manipulatingmemory correctly.  I also had packet sniffing disabled so I don't know whatthe server or client was doing right before or during the hangs.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 11, Top 37, Msg 4)>>>>>"""""This is amazing.

I've posted a slightlyupdated version of it at:http://www.syndicomm.com/~s.heumann/VNCviewGSa2.bxyThe major new feature in version 1.0a2 is the Hextile encoding.  This is analternative way of sending pixel data that may be faster than Raw encoding(which was always used in 1.0a1) in some circumstances, although itprobably won't be faster if you have a high-bandwidth connection.  Thisversion also fixes a bug potentially causing the second and subsequentconnections not to work properly and includes an enhancement that shouldmake the display update faster when scrolling rapidly between differentportions of the server's screen.As for those of you experiencing problems, please post here or email (tothe address in the README) a detailed description of the problem and how toreproduce it so that I can attempt to address it.Stephen Heumann(S.HEUMANN, Cat 11, Top 37, Msg 6)>>>>>"""""Could someone explain what VNC is?-Ken(KGAGNE, Cat 11, Top 37, Msg 7)>>>>>"""""There's a pretty nice introduction here:https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN/Resources/KnowledgeBase/Docs/20030911152834Think PC Anywhere, think Apple Remote Access.RyanChief Sysop(A2.RYAN, Cat 11, Top 37, Msg 8)>>>>>"""""I installed a VNC server on my iMac, and was able to type into ProTERM Macfrom my GS keyboard, and even control Firefox with it.

We watched the descent of The Mamba, a 205foot tall roller coaster.  It looked like so much fun!  The Mamba hasappeared on a list of the top ten steel roller coasters in the US.Dave Miller expressed interest in visiting the park so I was wondering ifthere are others who would like to do an all day visit during KFest 2005?Wednesday or Thursday would be the best days to attend to avoid the weekendcrowd.  I realize that the older crowd or those of certain body types maynot be as interested in attending.Retail price for the 2004 season is $37 for the land park and $25 for thewater park.  Discounts can be gotten to lower the price to $24 for the landpark and $20 for the water park.  Expect a slightly higher price for the2005 season.  When budgeting for an amusement park, don't forget aboutcosts for food, drinks, and parking.  Park hours are from 10:00 a.m. to10:00 p.m. so I figure we would leave Avila around 9:30 a.m. and spend allday at the park.Take a look at http://www.worlsoffun.com/ to see what is offered.I know it is early to commit to attend KFest 2005, but I would like to seewho else would be interested in visiting this park.  I have no problemsorganizing this event.  Since it is impossible to predict the weather thisfar in advance, plans may need to be canceled due to rain--one has to beflexible.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg1)>>>>>"""""I would much prefer to organize a foursome to Minor Street Gold Course.Bruce(BBAKER, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg 2)>>>>>"""""Bruce,No reason both can't happen.-Ken(KGAGNE, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg 3)>>>>>"""""World's of Fun used to be a staple of our Summer Vacations.

If there is interest in a linksouting, there needs to be somebody to run with the idea and gage interest.Like my amusement park idea, I don't see this as something done by theKFest committee so it would have to be done by a KFest attendee.An amusement park outing might be able to get the KFest teen-agers tobecome more social with some of the other folks, assuming money is not aproblem.Hanging out at Walmart at midnight is fun with the right crowd, but thereare other things that can be done too.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 5, Top 7, Msg 5)>>>>>"""""I would be much more interested in Worlds of Fun than golfing.
