Elvis was coming to the Community Room HighAbove The Rock River next month.  Anticipation was in the air.  Theexcitement grew day by day.     The evening was a huge success.  For two hours we were taken back intime by an Elvis fan who lived his passion for remembering Elvis.     Anticipation is in the air for KFest 2003.  The excitement isbuilding.

(DOS version) to write documents.  Thereasoning consisted of: less confusing for the staff to know multipleapplications, all of the text/data files are loadable from one commonprogram, and enforcing a standard.  I had to write a number of reports withLotus 1.2.3 and got pretty good with it as a word processor.On the other hand, If you wanted dynamic results based on a user input, theSpreadsheet module would be the appropriate tool for the job.

So a mage changing to a cleric could also cast all the clericspells known at that point (with current level restrictions), but couldonly add mage spells while a mage.Changing to a fighter, or other non-natural caster with previous spellswould also retain spells.  You would just be unable to cast or add anyspells until your reached the level needed, as before.  For fighters thatwould be level 30, so multiclass fighter/mage would probably not be a goodgoal, although you would retain your spells so if change back to a mage orany other class.What do you think about this?-Jeff Fink(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 118)>>>>>"""""Well, as someone who learned the hard way big time about losing spells, Ithink it is better the old way.

Is there one thatstands out from the pack?  I've tried a few versions a while back, but theyall required that you hand edit a file to change disk images.  This isn'tsomething I like doing.  Anything version with a UI that handles diskimages?Thanks,Dain(A2.DAIN, Cat 29, Top 41, Msg 1)>>>>>"""""There are two versions of KEGS for Windows that has "KEGS" in its names.ActiveGS, the Windows ActiveX component IIgs emulator is based on KEGS--andfor all practicality, can also be included in this topic.ActiveGS does not allow you to switch disk images at all--the disk image ispre-defined on the Web page as links.  Essentially, you just click on alink and you boot up another disk.  This operation is similar to afloppy-based system.KEGS32 is the only version of KEGS that is designed like a Windowsapplication. It has a GUI interface to perform operations such asadd/change/remove disk images and set emulator speed.  KEGS32 is based onthe 0.60 KEGS codebase.KEGS32's GUI allows up to 2 disk images for slots 5,6 and 7.  5.25"DOS-ordered disk images are used in slot 6.  800k ProDOS-ordered diskimages are used in slot 5.  Virtually any size ProDOS-ordered disk image(up to 4 gigs) can be used in slot 7.  KEGS internally can handle up to 32disk images for slot 7, but KEGS32 does not provide that functionality fromthe GUI.  To use more than 2 disk images in slot 7, you have to edit thekegs_conf like any other version of KEGS.  But using the KEGS32 GUI willremove any slot 7 disk images beyond the first two.  If I use KEGS32, Ialways edit the kegs_conf file by hand since I have many hard disk imagesin use.KEGSwin is the most recent entry as a Windows port.  This is the versionthat is maintained by Kent Dickey himself.  It uses the newest KEGScodebase (0.71), but lacks some functionality found in the equivalent UNIXversions (and KEGS32).  It has no GUI interface to speak of (just like theUNIX versions), but fortunately, it works like the UNIX version so if onehas been using KEGS for years, there is no learning curve.  One has to editthe kegs_conf file to change disk images.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 29, Top 41, Msg 2)>>>>>"""""KEGS is the most sophisticated and most compatible IIgs emulator under theWindows environment,  There are several different versions of KEGS--eachwith their own development paths and features.

In the previous segment, you wereintroduced to the origins of the GEnieLamp concept and the early days ofdigital publishing, on through the first year of existence of the Apple IIversion. Apple IIGS users were reveling in the glow of the release ofSystem 6, and the platform was doing its best to thrive; but Apple'sinvolvement with its original platform continued to be minimal, and someworried about the suspicious absence of the long-promised Apple II EthernetCard.In January 1993, Bill Clinton was soon to be inaugurated as president,having defeated George Bush in the 1992 election. Reggie Jackson waselected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. David Letterman announced hisdecision to move from NBC to CBS. In the computer industry, Intel wasworking feverishly on its successor to the 486, the first version of thePentium. IBM was having its difficulties with the decade-long struggleagainst clones, demonstrated by their announcement of the largest year-endloss of any U.S. company in history, $4.6 billion. The latest and greatestof these clones was powered by an Intel 486, it ran at a blazing speed of25 MHz, used 4 meg of RAM, and stored its data on a 200 meg hard drive. AtApple, their attention was focused on its impending announcement of no lessthan SIX models of the Macintosh, the Color Classic, LC III, Centris 610and 650, Quadra 800, and the PowerBook 165c. And in December 1992, they hadjust dropped a not-unexpected bombshell on the Apple II community. For areview of a year full of endings and beginnings, let's move into 1993, asseen through the eyes of GEnieLamp A2.DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC?As 1993 began, the GEnieLamp format remained much the same as before, withJohn Peters as Editor-in-Chief, and Darrel Raines as Editor for the AppleII edition. John's editorials continued to give people a taste of what washappening on GEnie in general. He encouraged people to upload GEnieLampanywhere they wanted, discussed changes in staff at GEnieLamp IBM. InApril, Peters started the DigiPub Roundtable for digital publishing topics,and left the GEnieLamp RT specifically for downloading of the variousGEnieLamp publications, available at the lower "GEnie*Basic" rates. Peterspublicized his concept of "Disktop Publishing", referring to non-printed,digital publications such as GEnieLamp. To further promote digitalpublishing, Peters announced in July that the Digital PublishingAssociation was holding the second annual Digital Quill Awards competition,specifically for publications that were created only in a machine-readableformat.In the May issue Peters announced that GEnieLamp was changing to atwice-a-month publication schedule, and there were indeed two issuesreleased that month (9305a and 9305b). However, he and his various editorsfound it to be simply too difficult to keep up with a biweekly schedule; sothey returned to the previous monthly schedule, and the next issue of theGEnieLamp magazines did not appear until July 1993. Peters also announcedthat T/TalkNET, his company, had been commissioned to do final formattingfor an online version of GEnie's LiveWire magazine (the print version wasmailed out periodically to GEnie subscribers to promote its variousservices).One change that Peters brought about early in the year was the creation ofGEnieLamp A2Pro. The A2Pro coverage had increased the size of GEnieLamp A2to over 200K, and he felt splitting them apart would be helpful to keep itto a more manageable size, and still provide the content. This editionbegan in February.The GEnieLamp ASCII art section continued with the appointment of MikeWhite as the official CowTOONs artist.APPLE II CONTENT IN 1993The credits on the masthead of the January 1993 issue of GEnieLamp A2looked like this: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////|| GEnieLamp A2     ~ A T/TalkNET OnLine Publication ~    Vol.2, Issue 11 || """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ||  Publisher.................................GEnie Information Services  ||   Editor-In-Chief........................................John Peters   ||    Editor.............................................Darrel Raines    ||                                                                        ||  ~ GEnieLamp IBM ~ GEnieLamp [PR]/TX2 ~ GEnieLamp ST ~ GEnieLamp A2 ~  ||      ~ GEnieLamp MacPRO ~ GEnieLamp A2Pro ~ GEnieLamp Macintosh ~      ||            ~ Member Of The Disktop Publishing Association ~            ||////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\||________________________________________________________________________|There was little change until July 1993, when Darrel Raines completed hislast issue as editor of the A2 edition. Consequently, John Peters and DeanEsmay, Chief Sysop of A2/A2Pro, began looking for a suitable person to takeover as editor. Doug Cuff, who had been absent from GEnie for a time, hadreturned specifically because he had enjoyed reading the GEnieLamp A2newsletter downloaded from a local BBS where it had been posted. He heardof the available position as editor, applied for it, and as Peters feltthat he was the best-qualified applicant, he was given the position. Doug'sfirst appearance was in August 1993, and he continued for forty-one issuesbefore he finally retired from the position in December 1996.The GEnieLamp A2 masthead now changed to look like this: _________________________________________________________________________|                                                                         ||\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////||  GEnieLamp Apple II ~ A T/TalkNET OnLine Publication ~  Vol.2, Issue 17 ||  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ||  Publisher...............................................John F.

This name remained atthe top of the masthead to the very end of the run of the newsletter onGEnie. Also remaining standardized to the very end was the title at the topof the first page. Where it had previously read "Your GEnieLamp Apple IIRoundTable RESOURCE!" it was now a more generic "Your GEnieLamp ComputingRoundTable RESOURCE!"This was also the first time that Bruce Maples' name appeared in themasthead, as Copy-Editor. He continued in this position from August 1993until July 1994, and the next time his name appeared in any GEnieLamppublication, it was as editor of the GEnieLamp Windows edition, starting inApril 1995.By the September issue, Doug Cuff had taken over the "From My Desktop"column that John Peters had previously used as his soapbox, and John'snotes were much more brief (mentioning only that there was now a Macintoshedition of GEnieLamp that had graphics). John had a few short notes in theOctober issue, and from that point onward never had any further writteninput into GEnieLamp A2. Prior to this, Peters had put together each issueof GEnieLamp for each platform. With the October issue, Peters now put thefull responsibility for creation of GEnieLamp into the hands of therespective editors. Consequently, Cuff had his work cut out for him.ROUNDTABLE NEWSThe A2 Roundtable celebrated the new year and 20,000 uploads to the libraryby awarding the uploader of the first file of the new year with prizes fromseveral major Apple II hardware and software companies. Other prizes weregiven to other participants of the A2 RT during January and February.A2Pro was run under the leadership of Matt Deatherage (who worked at Applebut spoke for himself when online). He reorganized the roundtable to betterallow for support from companies (such as The Byte Works) that chose tohost categories. Also involved in maintaining technical support categorieswere Procyon, Inc., Morgan Davis Group, JEM Software, and LunarProductions. A2U (Apple II University) was hosting a class on "Ultra 4 ToThe Max", taught by Will Nelken, and "Hacking Data Compression" by AndyMcFadden. Jim Murphy, another of the A2Pro Sysops, accepted a position atApple in the Apple II Continuing Engineering Group, beginning in January1993.GEnie itself was often the subject of discussion in the Roundtables. In theJuly issue, they debated the new rate plan that GEnie had just introduced,which included a reduced rate for access at 9600 baud (previouslyaccessible only with a surcharge). Furthermore, Genie was now alsoavailable for a $2 per hour surcharge via SprintNet, a new name for theTeleNet network.GEIS, the network on which was run, began to make it possible to contactthe outside world via the Internet. Information was posted on how to sende-mail so it could get to a different network outside of GEIS. In order forthis to work, it was necessary to append some additional info to the end ofan address: "a2history@syndicomm.com@INET#". This flagged GEnie's softwareto direct the message outside of the GEIS network, to the Internet.Receiving messages required use of the GEnie username, with GEnie's domainname: "a2history@genie.geis.com". To send and receive e-mail to/from theInternet at that time had a price also, costing $0.30 per 5000 bytes!Lost Classics Project coordinator Tim Tobin was given an additional taskduring 1993. He was asked to handle the Font Clearinghouse, with thepurpose of helping organize the many TrueType fonts that had been uploadedto the GEnie A2 libraries.With the decreasing support given by Apple Computer for its Apple II lineof computers, users groups were becoming more important. The GEnie A2Roundtable became host of an official user group, with the creation of theWorldwide Apple II User Group (WWUG) by Lunatic E'Sex. Designed during abrainstorming session at KansasFest 1993, it functioned through onlinemeetings in the A2 Real Time Conference (chat) area, doing much of what atraditional user group would do, with the exception of the attendees beingwidely scattered across the country (or the world!)HARDWARE NEWSThe year started with postings from December regarding the removal of theApple IIGS from Apple's price lists, effective 12/14/92. The January issuealso included an interesting summary of a meeting between John Santaro ofApple and members of the Bay Area Apple User Group about the IIGS. Ofparticular interest was the comment that part of the reason for thedevelopment of IIGS System 6.0 and HyperCard GS was to give Apple II usersa taste of the Macintosh, hopefully to encourage them to switch platforms.The posting also made mention of the never-released "ROM 04" IIGS and thefeatures it was to have had.Having the official announcement from Apple didn't change things very muchfor many people, as Apple had done little active promotion of the IIGS forseveral years. However, it likely contributed to the decline of somecompanies that produced products for the platform.CV Technologies, creator of the RamFAST SCSI card, decided to get out ofthe hardware business, and sold all of the rights to that card as well astheir memory cards to Sequential Systems. Their RAM card product for theIIGS was renamed from "CV-Ram" to "GS-RAM Plus". Soon afterwards,Sequential expanded the usefulness of the RamFAST card by theirintroduction of discQuest and discQuest GS, which allowed access to manyinformational and educational CD-ROMs that were becoming available for theMS-DOS and Mac platforms.ECON Technologies had its own problems. They had promised that theSoundMeister Pro sound card WOULD ship, and would be available bySeptember, 1993. This card, a successor to their existing SoundMeisterproduct, was to have advanced capabilities and was highly anticipated.However, news leaked out that the SoundMeister Pro was NOT going to bereleased, and by December ECON confirmed this. The reasoning was that thenumber of orders for the Pro card had not been sufficient to warrantputting it into production. (In reality, it was later learned that theprototype ECON had was never sufficiently finished to allow ANYONE toproduce it.)New products introduced included the Parson's Engineering Focus Hard Card,which made its first appearance in the latter half of 1993. This IDE driveon a card originally was sold as the Focus 40 (meg) for $349, a Focus 80for $599, and a bare card without a drive for $129. (And if you think THOSEprices are high, you should read ads that show the costs of a 5, 10 or 20meg hard drive back in the early 1980's!)///SSH Systeme in Germany released their Turbo IDE card, bringing toIDE/ATA drives some of the same speed of hard drive access that the RamFASThad achieved for SCSI drives. The product was also compatible with olderVulcan hard drives, improving their access speed as well.Various users posted their successes in getting their desktop publishingsoftware to work with laser printers. In addition, a certain R.SUENAGA1made his first appearance in GEnieLamp, with comments on how Postscriptprinters work. (He apparently didn't have much else to say that GEnieLampdeemed newsworthy for another eighteen months, until April 1995.)SOFTWARE NEWSThe biggest news of the year was the release, finally, of Apple IIGS SystemSoftware 6.0.1, which included many bug fixes and a few new features. Wenow know that the release had been delayed by Apple management's decisionto cancel the Apple II Ethernet card; this required removal from the 6.0.1update the installation options for it, and any other mention of the cardor of software that would have supported it. Many comments were publishedin GEnieLamp about how to make use of the new features of 6.0.1.Randy Brandt of JEM Software was shipping Ultra 4.1 (which included UltraExtras, originally an add-on product), the next evolution of UltraMacros3.x for AppleWorks 3.0. But more excitement was yet to come, as JEMSoftware and Quality Computers made an announcement in the middle of theyear of a major project. Code-named "Quadriga", this product was originallygoing to be called The WORKS 4.0, and was to have been a major patchprogram to update AppleWorks 3.0. Since Claris had not seen fit to do anyupdate on its own, Brandt had decided to do it himself. Having worked onAppleWorks 3.0 originally for Claris, he was uniquely qualified to makechanges to improve the program. When Claris saw that Brandt and Qualitywere making a serious effort to enhance AppleWorks, with or without theirpermission, they decided to license AppleWorks to Quality. This allowed theupdate to be officially called AppleWorks 4.0, and instead of a patch, itwould be a full application. The final product shipped on November 1, 1993,and was soon followed by an update (bug fix) to 4.01.John Link, who had written many versions of SuperPatch, a utility to alterAppleWorks 3.0 to add simple features, released "lastPatch" to do the samewith AppleWorks 4.01. The name also showed that he had no plans to do anyfurther patching programs for AppleWorks.Quality Computers also generated a lot of excitement with the news thatthey had also licensed AppleWorks GS from Claris. Their plans were toproduce an update in this long ignored application; however, from thebeginning they made announcements that it would not be a trivialundertaking. They also continued work on a fax program, Q-Fax GS (it neverdid get finished), and did release Bill Tudor's Six Pack, a set of Finderextras.Moreover, as if they didn't have enough projects, Quality mentioned thatthey were looking to see if it might be possible to emulate an Apple II orIIGS using a PowerPC Macintosh.Many of the software product announcements during the year werespecifically for the Apple IIGS. Roger Wagner promoted the new HyperStudiofor the Macintosh, as well as promising continued support and developmentfor the IIGS version. Softdisk announced that it was looking forprogrammers to help produce products and articles for Softdisk G-S.Foundation 1.0.2, a IIGS resource editor, was available from LunarProductions. County Line Technology released GSTape v2.0, a utility to backup a hard drive to a tape drive.Procyon introduced Switch-It (a program switcher). Soon after, Seven HillsSoftware and BrainStorm Software released The Manager, which was promotedas being more like the Macintosh MultiFinder (that had eventually becomepart of that computer's system software). Seven Hills also updated theirprint buffer utility Express to version 2.1.Other products that appeared during 1993 were ANSITerm 2.1 and PMPUnzip 2.0(Parkhurst Micro Products), HyperLogos GS (The Byte Works), Pedigree 2.0(Bright Software), Financial GeniuS 2.0 (Rick Adams), Symbolix 1.8 (BrightSoftware), Quickie 3.1 software (Vitesse),and Addressed For Success (ECONTechnologies).Roger Wagner Publishing continued support and promotion of HyperStudio withtheir First Annual Hyperstudio Festival in July.IIGS games released included Ant Wars from Karl Bunker (however, soonafterwards, he decided that the Apple II shareware market just was notpaying any bills for him, so he decided to release all of his programs asfreeware and get out of Apple II programming). Bouncin'Ferno contestentries began to arrive in Joe Kohn's mailbox. Ken Franklin was working ona new game called "Monster Lab" (unfortunately he never had time tocomplete it). Lawrence Productions released the Lost Tribe, an educationalprogram.The Apple IIe and IIc were not left out in the cold, however. DOS 3.3Launcher made it possible to run DOS 3.3 programs from ProDOS 8 on a IIe orIIc (or from the Finder on the IIGS).Tom Hoover's GEM (GEnie Master), an offline message reader that used TalkIs Cheap and AppleWorks, was released to freeware status (actually, the A2RT took over production and maintenance of the package). An update was doneto handle changes in the GEnie software about mid-year; after this release,however, there was little else about GEM that was newsworthy enough towarrant further inclusion in GEnieLamp. CoPilot, another offline reader,was also updated to handle the new GEnie changes.AppleWorks and UltraMacros were in heavy use in other applications. MagicalSoftware announced the Magic News Group Reader, a set of AppleWorks macrosto facilitate reading and responding to messages from Internet newsgroups.ProTERM 3.0 publisher InSync Software, Inc. had to have its name changed toInTrec Software, Inc. They also released ProTERM 3.1 in May. Don Elton'sterminal program Talk Is Cheap was updated to version 4.0.Kitchen Sink Software released II System, a double-hires GUI environmentfor ProDOS 8 on the 128K Apple IIe or IIc.And at least one 8-bit game was updated: Star Trek: First Contact v2.0.Beyond product announcements, other software news appeared in GEnieLampduring 1993. Publish-It 4.0, a desktop publishing program for any Apple II,was mentioned in regards to a desire to have it updated, but unfortunatelythat was not possible (according to comments from another softwarepublisher) due to the small return they were likely to get on theinvestment.In these pre-PayPal days, some shareware authors overseas were havingproblems with shareware payments from U.S. customers. Peter Watson (authorof MS-DOS Utilities for the IIGS) was having problems with this, and JoeKohn was helping him by cashing U.S. checks for him, and they sending acompatible payment.PUBLICATIONSBad news came also this year, as not only did inCider/A+ discontinuepublication, but A2-Central, a newsletter with much more than just news,changed from a paper publication to a disk-only publication. MacComputing,the Macintosh-centered magazine that inCider/A+ was supposed to turn into,disappeared after only one issue was printed.Good news came in the form of Joe Kohn's announcement of his newsletter,Shareware Solutions II, the successor to the column he had written forinCider/A+. Phil Shapiro, who also contributed a monthly article toGEnieLamp, began publication of Helium Balloons, a disk-based publicationfor educators. Another newsletter that was announced was The Passport HouseLetter, but after a single mention, GEnieLamp never had any further newsabout it. GS+ Magazine stated its plans to continue in production.Quality Computers continued its expansion beyond simply being a catalog anddistribution center, with the announcement of II Alive magazine, whichbegan production in March 1993. After the demise of inCider/A+, it was theonly remaining glossy publication dealing with both the 8-bit and 16-bitApple II line. The release of AppleWorks 4.0 delayed the November/Decemberissue, due to multiple responsibilities held by editor Jerry Kindall.Resource-Central's disk publication Studio City had a change in editor,from Dean Esmay (who was leaving to work with Softdisk Publishing) to BillLynn. Jay Jennings left Softdisk to work at Ariel Publishing.KANSASFESTResource Central again held the A2-Central Summer Conference (KansasFest).This 5th annual event was also the "sweet sixteen" birthday of the AppleII. Mike Westerfield, Roger Wagner, Jay Jennings, Brian Pietzak, GuyForsythe, Jim Maricondo, Andy McFadden, Joe Kohn, Jerry Kindall, NateTrost, Steve Gunn, Bill Heineman, and Richard Bennett were among thefeatured speakers. Besides the scheduled speakers, the annual roast focusedon Tom Weishaar.In 1992, Bill Heineman had introduced his Avatar project to build aIIGS-compatible computer out of available off-the-shelf PC components. Hepresented an update on the project, which was to use ROM code to emulate aIIGS, and therefore avoid legal complications from Apple.REVIEWSHardware products reviewed included Tulin's Floptical disk drive for theIIGS, which sold for $489 (not including the SCSI card); the SyQuest 88removable cartridge drive; and the inexpensive LineLink 14.4K modem.Several games were reviewed: Solarian GS (arcade game), Blackjack Tutor 3.0(card game), Shove It GS (puzzle game), Bounce It GS, Ken Franklin'sReliefware games Plunder, One Arm Battle, and Milestones 2000; and Out OfThis World (a graphic animated adventure).Other packages reviewed were Prime BBS software, UnZip IIe, ShadowWrite1.3, GIF.3200, Computer Keyboarding 5.0, and Independence and Harmonieprinter drivers.INTERVIEWSAn ongoing popular feature of GEnieLamp A2 was the interview column. In1993, these Apple II personalities were interviewed:o Ellen Rosenberg, editor-in-chief of A2-Central newslettero Mike Westerfield, The Byte Workso Kendrick Mock, author of several word and letter games for the IIGSo GEnieLamp A2 staff, including Darrel Raines, Phil Shapiro, and Mel Fowlero Guy & Cindy Forsythe and Guy Bush of Kitchen Sink Softwareo John Peters, publisher of GEnieLampo Joe Kohno Roger Wagnero Jim Royal, author of Star Trek: First ContactWRITERSDarrel Raines continued to contribute articles during the time he editedGEnieLamp. Phil Shapiro continued his "Thinking On" series, as well ashandling other writing tasks for the newsletter, including interviews. Healso wrote some articles for a "Beginner's Corner" column. Gary Utter hadmany thoughtful messages reproduced from the bulletin board, including adescription of shrinkwrap licenses. InSync (now InTrec) Software's JerryCline explained the mysteries of the MNP feature on modems.My own Apple II History series continued, running Parts 8 through 18. Sinceit had already been written, this was easy. However, in order to get somediscount hours from GEnie as payment for submitting articles, Doug Cufftold me that I needed to submit TWO articles per month. Therefore, Istarted a monthly column that continued the Beginner's Corner theme thatPhil Shapiro had started. My column was subtitled "Polishing Green Apples",and dealt primarily with getting started on the Apple IIGS, explaining thepicky details of selecting a model, outfitting it with the right hardwareand software, and explaining how some of it worked.Mel Fowler did software reviews. Udo Huth, a roundtable member fromGermany, contributed an article discussing the difficulties in accessingGEnie from other countries. Al Fasoldt, a newspaper editor and programmerin Syracuse, NY, began a column. Among other topics, he discussed thelimitations of spell checking software when it comes to homonyms ("four" vs"for").Joe Kohn wrote many RT messages that appeared in GEnieLamp; in 1993 he wasdiscovering the Internet and was beginning to learn how to use the tools(prior to the development of the World Wide Web). His article"Connections", was, for some reason, reprinted (it had appeared earlier inthe September 1992 issue of GEnieLamp A2). Joe also announced his plans topublish his Shareware Solutions II newsletter, as inCider/A+ wasdiscontinued in June 1993.Gina Saikin wrote her first article for GEnieLamp, discussing herexperiences of starting with an Apple II computer, and followed up laterwith an article about Real Time Conferences (chat). Cynthia Field, a writerfor inCider/A+, allowed reprinting of an article that she had written in1991, a Consumer's Guide To the Apple II.At the end of the year, Jay Curtis began a series of articles about AppleII hybrids, add-on cards that allowed one computer to function as anotherone (such as the PC Transporter to use MS-DOS from an Apple II).MISCELLANEOUS FEATURESMark Quinn discussed various general computer topics, usually in a humorousvein. Monthly Search-Me puzzles continued to appear, with topics focusingon various GEnie roundtables and services. GEnieLamp ELSEWHERE appearedonce, discussing how to access the Computing and NewsCenter.In July, GEnieLamp reproduced the press release from Apple that announcedJohn Sculley's resignation as CEO of the company, and the move of MichaelSpindler into that position. By later in the year, other Apple boardmembers were looking for work elsewhere.Several comments were made regarding Apple's new migration to the PowerPCprocessor for its Macintosh platform. There was at first a misunderstandingabout what the PowerPC chip could do, and some believed it was going toEMULATE a 68000-series processor, much as the program SoftPC emulated anMS-DOS computer, which would adversely affect the performance of thecomputer. Concern was also raised about Apple's promise to continuesupporting the 68000-series computers as the PowerPC computers became moreplentiful. It was also pointed out that the transition between the Mac andPowerPC Macs would be more like that between the Apple IIe and IIGS, ratherthan the differences between the Apple II and Mac.HUMOR ONLINEWe were informed of "safe fax". A problem-solving flow chart was presentedin the second May issue. The CowTOONS series had a swimsuit issue in March.Giving a computer a personal name was discussed. Darrel Raines introducedthe "Banana PC" in an April column. Tom O'Nan submitted his true storyabout accidentally shooting his Rana floppy disk drive.STILL CRAZY AFTER ALL THESE YEARSI hope you've enjoyed this stroll through the world of one decade ago. Nexttime we will dive directly into 1994, as seen through the eyes ofGEnieLamp.Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.org[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[ASA]THE APRIL ISSUE OF Syndicommotion NOW AVAILABLE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The April issue of Syndicommotion is now available.

Lay two cablesnext to each other and they will tangle themselves into a mess.  Connectsix or eight external accessories to your Apple II and you have a pile ofcables resembling a pile of cooked spaghetti.The plan below features a compartment with adjustable shelves that is openboth front and back and has casters to allow moving the cart away from thewall.  This provides accessibility for working with your equipment.Place your accessories only one layer deep.  Tuck the extra length ofcables on the shelf where the accessory is placed.You can adjust dimensions to provide for your needs as you prefer.THE PLAN""""""""       /----------------------------------------------/      /   (A)                                        /|     /                                              / |    /                                              /  |   /                                              /   |  /----------------------------------------------/    |  | /  (E)                       |    |          |    |  |/----------------------------/|    | (open)   |    |  |    |                         |    |          |    |  |    |                         |    |          |    |  |(B) | (C)                     |(B) |          |(B) |  |    /-------------------------|    /----------|    /  |   /                          |   /           |   /  |  /                           |  /  (D)       |  /  | /                            | /             | /  |/                             |/--------------|/What You Will Need""""""""""""""""""3/4 Inch Plywood                                      Inches''''''''''''''''                                      ''''''(A)  1 Top                                            15 x 48(B)  3 Uprights                                       15 x 24(C)  1 Back Panel, Left Compartment                   24 x 30(D)  1 Bottom Panel, Right Compartment                15 x 15(E)  1 Keyboard Shelf, Mounted on Drawer Slides       12 x 29.5 *(F)  6 Shelves                                        15 x 14.5 ** Adjust dimensions to provide for hardware.Hardware''''''''(1)  4 Adjustable Shelf Support Strips(2) 24 Clips for Adjustable Shelf Support Strips(3)  1 Pair Drawer Slides(4)  6 CastersWhere to Get What You Need""""""""""""""""""""""""""Your local building supply storeNotes"""""(a) Right compartment open, front and back to allow access to equipment.(b) Adjustable shelf strips on right and left panels of right compartment.(c) Keyboard shelf mounted on drawer slide hardware.(d) Mount two casters at bottom of each upright.[EOA]YOU ARE INVITED"""""""""""""""You are invited to submit your favorite Tinkerer's Project for the Apple IIcomputers.Send your write up or idea to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, Editor <lyle@FoxValley.net>The Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KFT]------------------------------                       KFest 2003 |-----------------------------------[PBT]KFest 2003 - PLAN TO BE THERE!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KansasFest 2003 is planned for July 22-27, 2003 at Avila University inKansas City, Missouri.(Entrance banner, Cat 5, Top 5)[EOA][KRF]KFest REGISTRATION FORM"""""""""""""""""""""""The KFest registration form with instructions in PDF format can bedownloaded here:http://lamp.a2central.com/klo/registration_forms/KFestRegForm2003g.pdfIf you can not access PDF documents with your computer contact Jerry Clineat Intrec Software and request a form by mail.

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.[editor@juiced.gs]                         The KFest FAQ Version 4.0                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The following article is set up in a form commonly seen on theInternet, called Frequently Asked Questions.  It is designed to answer someof the most common questions people have about KansasFest, the Apple IIevent of the year.  It is not designed to answer general questions aboutthe Apple II, although there may be some overlap.     Any questions about this article can be sent via email toeditor@juiced.gs.Q: What's a FAQ, and how is it pronounced?A: The letters "FAQ" stand for _F_requently _A_sked _Q_uestions.  Whenpeople first hear of or learn of a subject, such as KansasFest, they oftenhave a number of questions which others before them had when they alsofirst learned of the same subject.  A FAQ is a document listing both thequestions and answers most frequently associated with new users, to savethemselves (and others trying to assist them) time and frustration.And by the way, it's pronounced "fack", nearly identical to "fact".Q: What is the purpose of this FAQ?A: This FAQ is set up to assist people interested in KansasFest, also knownas KFest.  Many Apple II enthusiasts are interested in attending or justwant some information about this event, so the most common questions areanswered here.Q: How can this FAQ be distributed?A: The content of this FAQ is copyright 1999-2003 by Ryan M. Suenaga.Distribute freely, provided the content is unchanged.Q: What is KFest?A: KansasFest, abbreviated "KFest", is a computing conference held everysummer at Avila College (now Avila University) in Kansas City, Missouri.Its original formal name was "The Apple II Summer Conference" while itsnickname was "KansasFest", which was abbreviated to "KFest".  Today, theconference's official name is "KansasFest".Q: When was the first KFest held?A: The first KansasFest was held in 1989.  It was originally sponsored byResource-Central, the folks who brought you the wonderful _Open-Apple_ and_A2-Central_ (among several other Apple II) publications.  AfterResource-Central became ICON, The Apple II Summer Conference becameICONference.  This lasted one summer until ICON shut down.  Two differentcompanies sponsored KFest before Intrec Software, publishers of _ProTERM_,took over a few years back.  This July will welcome the 15th KFest.Q: When is KFest this year?A: KansasFest 2003 runs from Tuesday through Sunday, July 22-27, 2003. Thevery popular early arrival day is now officially rolled into KansasFestproper.  Meals, however, will not be served at Avila until Wednesdaydinner.Q: Where is KFest held?A: KFest is held at Avila University in Kansas City, Missouri.  The addressand phone number are:     Avila University     11901 Wornall Road     Kansas City, Missouri  64145     United States of America     (816) 942-8400Q: If it's held in Missouri, why is it called KansasFest?A: I dunno.  It does take place in Kansas City, and if it makes you feelbetter, the Kansas border is very close to Avila University.Q: Who comes to KFest?A: While KFest was originally devoted to programmers, nowadays all kinds offolk from all over the world show up at Avila University.  Programmers,users, newsletter publishers, and everyday folk show up from Europe,Canada, Australia, and all over the United States to celebrate theApple II.Q: Who organizes KFest?A: Currently, KFest is organized by a committee headed by The Grand Gouda,Steve "Godzilla" Gozdziewski, who has taken over from The Big Cheese, CindyAdams.  Cindy remains on the committee.  The scheduling is done by TonyDiaz, of Alltech Electronics fame.  Tony also handles the maintenance ofthe World Wide Web site, Devin Reade maintains the email lists, and Eric"Sheppy" Shepherd provides World Wide Web hosting services and organizesHackFest, the programming contest.  KFest is sponsored by Jerry Cline ofIntrec Software.Q: How do I register for KFest?  How much does it cost?A: Depending on when you register, registration prices vary.  If youregister early, you'll get a better deal. Please check the KFest Home Pageathttp://www.kfest.org/for the most current information.  You can download the registration formin PDF format fromhttp://www.kfest.org/KFest2003Reg.pdfIf you cannot download the form or print a PDF file, please contact JerryCline at Intrec Software (contact information is elsewhere in this file)and he will send you a form by fax or postal mail.Q: How do I reach Intrec/Jerry?Jerry ClineInTrec Software, Inc.3035 E Topaz CirclePhoenix, AZ 85028-4423Voc:602/992-1345Fax:602/992-0232kfest@intrec.comQ: Which airport do I fly into and how do I get from there to Avila?A: The major airport nearly everyone flies into is Kansas CityInternational, which goes by the code letters MCI (not KCI, which will getyou to Indonesia).  There's a couple of small commuter airports which arecloser, but unless you're Tony Diaz (who flies his own plane), you're notlikely to use these.Even though MCI is the "closest" major airport, it's still most of anhour's drive from there to Avila, so walking is out of the question and cabfare would be substantial.  Your best bet would be to try and catch a ridewith another KFester who'll be flying in or passing by around the same timeyou'll be arriving.  Carl Knoblock unofficially organizes rides to and fromthe airport.  The best way to get in on the ride planning is to join theKFest email list (information on subscribing is elsewhere in thisdocument).Q: What kind of official activities go on at KFest?A: Officially, there is a keynote speech, sessions on various computingtopics, HackFest, a celebrity roast, product demonstrations, and a vendorfair.Q: Who is this year's roastee?A: Just announced by KFest Roast MC Ken Gagne: Geoff Weiss, author ofSpectrum Internet Suite and many other Apple IIgs programs, will be theguest of honor at this year's roast.Q: What if I want to host a session?A: Email sessions@apple2.org with your ideas for a session.  Sessions caninclude new ways to use programs, new programs, networking, or just aboutanything you can imagine.  Everyone has something they can teach.Q: What kind of unofficial activities go on at KFest?A: Unofficially, there's been movie outings, pizza nights, Bite The Bagcontests, late night eating at Denny's, runs out to Krispy Kreme, FloppyDisk Ninja, Apple II Jeopardy, and huge groups of folks going to eat hugepieces of beef at K.C. Masterpiece and Jess and Jim's restaurants.  Andthere's a new contest this year called "CansasFest", a homemade 802.11bantenna contest.Q: Has anyone attended every KFest?A: One person: Tony Diaz of Computer Circulation Center (formerly known asAlltech Electronics).Q: I hear that the Avila University dorm is wired for Ethernet.  Is there away I can access that while I'm there?A: Yes.  In each dorm room in the halls of Avila are two outlets that seemto be phone jacks.  These _aren't_ phone jacks.  They're Ethernet ports--tobe exact, they're RJ-45 connectors that are compatible with 10 Base-TEthernet.  The entire Avila dorm is connected to the Internet this way,making for high speed World Wide Web browsing, electronic mail, and ftpconnections for KansasFesters during their stay!    The Avila Ethernet uses a protocol called Dynamic Host ConfigurationProtocol, or DHCP, for short. Those of you who have set up TCP/IPconnections with Windows or Macintosh computers (or, for that matter, theApple IIgs) probably have some familiarity with inserting IP addresses, DNSaddresses, and Gateway addresses.  The beauty of DHCP is that it sets upnearly everything you need dynamically, meaning that the server assignsthese addresses--all you need to do is set up TCP/IP on your computer andchoose the DHCP protocol.     Regardless of which platform you use, if you have software set up toshare your hard drive with other computers, you probably ought to disableit--unless you like everyone in the Avila Ethernet having access to yourfiles.     At this point, you ought to be connected.  If you previously had anyproxy servers set up for use with your setup before Avila, disable them.You ought to have easy access for checking mail, browsing the Web, or usingfile transfer protocol--and very high speeds.  One last caveat:    As Spam on the Internet proliferates, it has become accepted practiceto close off an Internet Service Provider's mail sending server--usuallyusing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or smtp--to access from anyone who isnot directly connected to the ISP.  In other words, no one wants to be arelaying point for Spam.     Because of this, it's likely you will not be able to use the same smtpserver you use at home to send mail while at Avila.  There is, however, amail.avila.edu smtp server that can be used while at Avila.  That ought tokeep your email flowing freely.Q: I hear that there's wireless Internet access in the Avila dorm.  How doI get hooked up?A: Ah, the infamous wireless.  Several KFesters have set up Apple AirportBase Stations and other equivalents.  Please see one of them (Sean Fahey,Dain Neater, Eric Shepherd, and Ryan Suenaga are likely candidates) ifyou'd like to get on the wireless 'Net.Q: How can I learn more about KFest?A: You can get more information on KansasFest by visiting the KansasFestWorld Wide Web site at http://www.kfest.org/ or sending email tokfest-help@kfest.org.  You could also subscribe to the KFest mailing listby sending email to majordomo@kfest.org.  In the body of the email includethe text:     subscribe kfestYou will receive a confirmation email with instructions on finalizing yoursubscription.Q: Should I go to KFest?A: Need you ask?  KFest is a must for the serious Apple II fanatic.  Doyourself a favor--you're worth it.  Show up at KFest 2003, the summer campfor Apple Geeks.[EOA][VKF]FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THE KFest HOME PAGE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""KFest Home Pagehttp://www.kfest.org/[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
