Then, depending on his mood ofthe day, he picks a car and goes for a drive.  He likes to show them off inlocal car shows.  And participate in local parades.     Those of us restoring, tinkering with, and using classic computerssuch as the Apple II's are in good company.

The closure will take effect at midnight Eastern Standard Timeon December 1, 2006.Customers that have business web site accounts with Syndicomm will be ableto continue to have their sites hosted with Syndicomm.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd, the owner of Syndicomm, said, "With A2Central.comin Sean's capable hands, I feel confident that he can pick up the banner ofproviding the ultimate online home for Apple II users.  Since SyndicommOnline is almost all Apple II users anyway, I felt it was time to close theonline service so my time could be better used elsewhere."Shepherd added, "The online service has been being supported by the sale ofsoftware products since its inception, while at the same time keeping metoo busy to develop new products.  I feel that my best purpose in the AppleII world is to develop software, and closing the Syndicomm Online servicewill allow me to spend more time doing just that.""Sheppy and I realized that the best way to serve the Apple II world wasfor A2Central.com to provide chat, message boards, and similar services,and to let Sheppy -- that is, Syndicomm -- write code," Fahey said.

This place was a popular vacation spot for my family whenI was younger, but it didn't hold quite the same appeal then that it doesnow.  Indeed, Funspot got a lot of flack from 1988 to 1999 - but they knewthat, in time, sticking to their guns would produce for them a uniqueattraction.That attraction is a room filled with more than a hundred arcade games fromthe Seventies and Eighties.  Among that collection are many that arefamiliar to Apple II users, including Lode Runner, Qix, Arkanoid, Paperboy,and Frogger.This is the arcade where Billy Mitchell achieved a perfect score in Pac-Manon July 3rd, 1999.  He is one of many whose pictures are framed on the Wallof Fame, while nearby are hung original posters advertising new games suchas Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.  Along the perimeter of the main room aredozens of pinball machines, from Superman of 30 years ago to more recentdevices such as The Addams Family and Star Trek: The Next Generation.The games cost what they did back then: a quarter, unadjusted forinflation.  I went to Funspot with someone who had never been to an arcadebefore - in fact, before last month, she had never played any video gamewhatsoever.  We split $10 in tokens and squeezed out more than two hours ofentertainment.  We then played air hockey and skeeball, exchanging ourtickets from the latter for a Chinese finger trap and some Pixie sticks,before heading from the cold, dark hive of electronic activity out againinto the glaring sun of midday to take on Funspot's go-kart track.Throughout the weekend, I neither stepped foot onto Weirs Beach nor spentany moment of the fading hours of summer sunlight in the waters of NewHampshire's largest lake.  I am home again now, thinking to myself of allthat I've missed - not the natural wonders of New England, but the 20 yearsof arcades that have witnessed increased expense and decreased popularity.Fortunately, the fall of that empire can be, at least temporarily, reversedas decades past rise once again by this simple trek to Funspot - madepossible by the determination and passion of people such as manager GaryVincent, technician Randy Lawton, and donors like Curt Vendel, who detachedthemselves from their own precious gaming artifacts so that they could bemade available to all generations at this living museum.The website for Funspot, which catalogues their collection, is:http://www.funspotnh.com/gms-classic.htm(KGAGNE, Cat 14, Top 8, Msg 41)[EOA][IPD]ImageMaker Work on Protected Disks?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Can I use ImageMaker to get a disk image of a protected disk?

Performance on PowerPCsystems is also much improved.A complete list of the changes follows:1. Pathnames are now kept in UTF-8 format instead of in ASCII, whichimproves compatibility for non-English users.2. Added a preference to automatically cause the mouse to be disabled whenin text modes.3. Fixed the speed control checkbox so that toggling it takes effectimmediately instead of usually requiring you to quit and restart Sweet16.4. Optimized performance on PowerPC systems, improving speed by up to 30%.5. DiskCopy 4.2 images created and marked as being Mac format disks willnow work in Sweet16.6. Sound effects are now played when ejecting floppy disk images.7.

The new feature includes a couple of modest newfeatures and fixes a slough of bugs.You can get additional information or download the software at<http://www.sheppyware.net/software-mac/sweet16/index.html>.  Sweet16 isfreeware.Here's a list of everything that's changed:1. Holding down the option key while mounting 800K disk images now mountsthem as CleverPort devices instead of as IWM floppy disks; this lets youmount lots of 3.5" disk images at once, which makes installing the systemsoftware, for example, incredibly easy.2. Updated the URL in the documentation that's presented for where to go todownload system disks.3. Aliases to files now resolve correctly, so you can drop aliases to yourdisk images into the Disk Images folder, instead of moving the imagesthemselves.4. The Reset command in the Setup menu now works correctly.5. Optimized more PowerPC code, resulting in a small additional performanceboost over version 1.7.6. Fixed a bug that prevented Recent Disks from mounting.7. Items in the Eject submenu now display the name of the disk correctly;this broke in version 1.7 due to the UTF-8 change.8. Ejecting a disk then inserting a new one now properly redraws thecontents of the disks window if it's visible.  Previously, it was possiblefor the contents of the window to become somewhat confused in thissituation.9. Fixed a bug that caused the mouse cursor to bounce around the screenwhen Default Folder X is installed.  This also slightly improves theresponse performance of the mouse in Sweet16.10. Fixed a couple of problems that caused crashes when clicking in thedisks window under certain circumstances.11. The Control-Command-M keyboard combination now properly issues theMount Disk Image command.12. Fixed a memory leak when initializing the Recent Disks menu.13. Added a "Clear Recent Disks" command to the Recent Disks menu.  Thisempties the recent disks list.14. Fixed a bug that caused new DiskCopy 4.2 images to have invalid namesin their DiskCopy 4.2 headers.15. Fixed a bug that caused the progress window used when creating diskimages or calculating the checksum on a DiskCopy 4.2 image to crash.16. Fixed HTML markup problem in the documentation that made theinstructions on copying the ROM from a IIgs unreadable.17. Fixed the error dialog box that appears if you try to mount too manydisks (or too many of a given type) so it actually contains text.18. Fixed the "allow 14 MB" checkbox and the other controls in the Memorypanel in the Preferences window to stay in sync properly.19. Fixed the memory size preference so it resets to 8 MB if you turn offthe "allow 14 MB" checkbox with the memory size set above 8 MB.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 29, Top 39, Msg 7)>>>>>"""""I've just released Sweet16 1.7.2.

Everything seems to beworking fine except the mouse. It's not smooth. It kind of skips andstutters across the screen, and there is a slight delay between when I movethe mouse and when the pointer moves. This makes it a bit hard to use,especially when I need fine control of the pointer.I have tried various speed settings, with and without speed control andZipGS emulation. Actually, I'm not quite sure what the speed controlcheckbox is supposed to do, as the overall performance seems to be the sameregardless of this setting. But whatever settings I use, the mouseperformance is always the same.I'm using a Power Mac G4 1.4 GHz with 1 GB RAM running OS X 10.4.7.Other than this little glitch, Sweet16 is working great for me.

It's going to be a big job.Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 29, Top 39, Msg 11)[EOA][SSU]Sweet16 1.7.3 Released""""""""""""""""""""""I've released Sweet16 1.7.3, which I expect to be the last update before amajor revision that will take some months to finish.This version fixes speed control to work correctly on PowerPC, fixes thetiming of certain interrupts (games that were playing at the wrong speedshould work better now), and now supports the Dvorak and French Canadiankeyboard layouts.http://www.sheppyware.net/software-mac/sweet16/index.htmlEric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 29, Top 39, Msg, 12)[EOA][AIE]A2Unplugged Interviews Juiced.GS Editor-in-chief""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The latest episode of Ryan Suenaga's biweekly Apple II podcast,A2Unplugged, features an interview with the editor-in-chief of Juiced.GS.Read more about it and download the MP3 at this page:http://a2unplugged.com/wordpress/?p=13(KGAGNE, Cat 23, Top 2, Msg 731)[EOA][LTE]-------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------NO LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THIS MONTH"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The mail box for Letters to the Editor remained empty this month.[EOA]AN INVITATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~Express your opinions about the comings and goings in the world of theApple II computers.Send your comments to Lyle Syverson, lutefisk4me at sbcglobal dot netThe Editor reserves the right to edit any material submitted.The Editor reserves the right to reject any material he considersunsuitable for publication in _The Lamp!_.[EOA][KF7]------------------------------                       KFest 2007 |-----------------------------------[KFS]KansasFest 2007"""""""""""""""is scheduled for July 17-22, 2007.Go to <http://www.kfest.org> for details.[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
