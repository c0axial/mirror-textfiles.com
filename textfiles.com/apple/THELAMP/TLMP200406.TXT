In time, my brother and I spent many hours driving this tractor.     The Farmall Regular 20, equipped with steel wheels, was a row croptractor... the wheels placed so as to straddle the rows of crops such ascorn.  Over the years it was upgraded using parts from third party sourcesas well as from the manufacturer.  Steel wheels replaced with rubber tires.A more efficient governor to maintain a steady speed.  A new magneto toprovide a more efficient spark for ignition.  A hydraulic seat for asmoother ride.  Addition of a "road gear" for faster movement when on theroad between fields.     In time a larger, more powerful tractor was purchased and the originalbecame the "2nd tractor" for the "smaller jobs".  Even later the Regular 20was retired... but my Father could not part with it... there was somethingspecial about his first tractor.     My Father has passed on.  My brother took over the farm.  That oldtractor still has a place of honor in the machine shed.  Once a year westart it up and drive it around the yard.  It is still capable of doing thework it was designed to do.  But the work is now done with larger, morepowerful tractors that are several generations beyond the Regular 20.     Notice the similarity of the tractor story to that of the Apple IIcomputers... upgrading, still capable, not willing to part with your firstcomputer, etc.     Come to KansasFest 2004 for a dose of Apple II nostalgia.  See theKFest section of this issue for more information.                          The Lure of Versatility                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The versatile nature of the Apple IIgs inspires the Tinkerer.

Personal computers were still (perhaps rightly) regarded asglorified toys, or at the most high-tech typewriters. Visicalc put personalcomputers in general (and the Apple II in particular) on the map.Another way of looking at spreadsheets is that they allow non-programmersto create "programs", in the same way that modern phones allow everyone tobe a telephone operator. A colleague at work is very definitely not aprogrammer, but he blew me away recently with a spreadsheet he developed topredict the size of a custom database after a year.I am still discovering new ways to use spreadsheets - and I haven't even*begun* to touch the macro-type facilities!Peter               peterw@syndicomm.comPalm OS Community Bulletin Board Manager(PETERW, Cat 2, Top 6, Msg 109)[EOA][WUS]Geoff Weiss UPDATES SEVERAL TITLES OF HIS SOFTWARE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I uploaded a new version of my ping shell utility: ping version 1.1.Not only does it have several bug fixes, it now does the following:- support output redirection- errors are sent to stderr- the version number can be displayed with the -V argumentPlease let me know if it doesn't work if used from your favorite shell.Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 20, Top 13, Msg 69)>>>>>"""""I must have been in a bug stomping mood.

There are multiple problems that occurred,and they're trying to sort through them.1. The printer no longer provides staples as an option; this is why none ofthe issues were stapled.  Clearly, this is the last straw, and we will befinding a new printer before V9I3 is shipped.2. For some reason, something went wrong with their automatic distributionnetwork that assigns printing to the regional print shops.  Normally, asyou're all aware, issues are printed at a facility relatively close to therecipient, then mailed from there.  For some reason, all of the issues wereassigned to the Oakland print facility.3. In addition to that, for whatever reason, it seems that many issues werenot mailed at all.  We don't know why yet.4. They also substantially overcharged us for postage, and they're notclear on why yet.  They're looking into what happened and are going to tryto get that refunded.Part of the problem is that about a year ago, the US Postal Service, whichhas been handling our printing and mailing for us since Syndicomm took overJuiced.GS, outsourced their online printing and mailing service to a thirdparty.  Six months ago, that third party made substantial changes to theservice that both added -- and removed -- features.

The seriesILLUMINATING THE LAMP will continue in the August or September issue.[EOA][TTC]-------------------------------             THE TINKERER'S CORNER |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>The IIgsX2~~~~~~~~~~By Lyle SyversonYou might want to refer to the February 2000 issue of _The Lamp_ for myfirst mention of the IIgsX2 in the article on "Dreamware".  Sometimes ittakes awhile for a dream to come true... and the details might vary to someextent.The IIgsX2, as described in this article, consists of two IIgs's connectedto one monitor and one keyboard/mouse via a KVM switch.  In one switchposition the monitor and keyboard function with the first IIgs.  In thesecond position the monitor and keyboard function with the second IIgs.You can start a task with one of the computers, then switch to the other tostart another task.  You can switch back and forth between the twocomputers to check on the progress.  Start downloading a large file on oneand play a game on the other, for example.Advantages of the IIgs''''''''''''''''''''''1. Two computers fit nicely on one desk.2. More slots for a larger selection of slot cards.3. Dual processors.  :)4. Multitasking.     :)5. ROM 1 and ROM 3 available at the click of a switch.What You Will Need''''''''''''''''''1. Two IIgs's.2. One IIgs monitor.3. One keyboard with mouse.4. Two extra cables of the type used to connect the monitor to the IIgs.   (A total of three of these cables.)5. Two extra cables of the type used to connect the keyboard to the IIgs.   (A total of three of these cables.)6. A suitable KVM switch.  Be sure you are getting one designed for the Mac   with the D15 monitor connectors and the ADB keyboard connectors.  These   switches are offered for sale from time to time on the LEM-Swap list.   (See 5. below)Additional Items You Might Need if You Opt for Data Transfer (See Below)''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Two removable media drives such as the SyQuest 44/88 or Zip 100.2. Mac computer with serial port.3. Three PhoneNet connectors.4. Telephone wire.Where to Get What You Need''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Thrift stores.2. Garage sales.3. Usenet... comp.sys.apple2.marketplace4. A2 on Syndicomm5.

A2Central.com (System disks, if needed)Procedure'''''''''1. Connect the monitor to the common connecter on the KVM switch.2. Connect the keyboard/mouse to the common connecter on the KVM switch.3. Connect the first IIgs to the first set of connecters (monitor and   keyboard/mouse)4. Connect the second IIgs to the second set of connecters (monitor and   keyboard/mouse)5. Turn the switch to position one and boot the first IIgs.6. Turn the switch to position two and boot the second IIgs.7. Switch back and forth as desired.Transfering Data Between the Two IIgs's'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''1. Floppy disks.2. Larger removable disk devices such as the SyQuest 44/88 drives or the   Zip 100 drives.  Identical drives, one on each of the two IIgs's, equals   a "portable hard drive" that can be accessed by either computer.3. Both computers connected via AppleTalk to the same Mac.  Transfer data   to the Mac with one IIgs.  Retreive it from the Mac with the other IIgs.   Each of the IIgs's would also have access to a CD ROM drive connected   the Mac.  Refer to the November 2002 issue of The Lamp! for information   on setting up AppleTalk between a IIgs and a Mac.[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][JSC]June 2004 Issue of Syndicommotion Available"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The June 2004 (Volume 3, Number 6) issue of Syndicommotion has been emailedto subscribers.

The rules are the same as always, but follow:KansasFest 2004HackFest Rules1. Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 21, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 24 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.  However, entries may be described or discussed, includingscreen shots (where applicable), by the KFest committee for promotionalpurposes, or by legitimate Apple II community press.The following lists are not necessarily complete lists of everythingallowed; these are to be taken as "givens."  If it's not on the list,please ask for confirmation.Acceptable software:     System software     Development environment (no customizations)     GSBug     Nifty List     Marinetti     Exerciser     ORCA/Debugger, Splat!     DesignMaster, Foundation, Genesys, ResLin     Talking Tools     Spectrum, ProTERM, ANSITermAcceptable hardware:     Apple II computer, monitor, disk drives, hard drives     CD-ROM drive, tape drive     Hard disk controller card     Sound card (speakers/headphones/etc)     Accelerator card (any speed)     RAM cardAccepted reference material:     All official Apple reference materials (including     manuals, technical notes, and file type notes).     Reference manuals included with development tools     and software.     Commercially-available reference manuals.Any other hardware, software, or reference material needs the approvalof the judges in advance.  When in doubt, ask the judges.(Eric Shepherd, Owner, Syndicomm: http://www.syndicomm.com)(Via KFest Mailing List)[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
