Thewater in the river below is churned up into large waves... whitecapsjumping against the current.  Just a mile to the north sits the SinnissippiPark greenhouse, next to the river.  Come... let us go for a sample ofSpring... lets us visit the greenhouse.     The wind bites our noses as we walk the bridge over the river.  Alongthe trail a lone jogger leans his body into the wind... his face red fromthe cold wind rushing past him.  A strong gust of wind forces a burst ofold, dry leaves across the trail.  The Mallard ducks sitting along the bankhave their beaks tucked under their wings.  The tennis courts are silent,except for the sign slapping against the fence.  The benches positionednext to the river are deserted.     At last... inside the greenhouse we smell the moisture of the warmair.  No wind.  We are visiting another climate.  The many beautiful bloomsare truly inspiring... the reds, yellows, blues, purples.     In the back section are flats of barren soil.  A tag proclaims whathas been planted in each of these flats.  It has been anticipated thatthere will be places along that windy trail we have walked today forflowers... flowers that will thrive in the new season.                         In Anticipation of K-Fest                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     A visit to the section of this issue devoted to K-Fest indicates thatpeople are getting anxious for another visit to Kansas City to honor theApple II.  Will you be among those who will make this pilgrimage?  We hopeso![EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA]---------------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[SCV]SILVERN CASTLE v7.3 AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I am reposting this announcement to make a correction.

I wanted to get it 'presentable' before I released it onthe world (and perhaps make damn sure that it fixed the problem for goodfor others). Right now it requires hardcoding your _complete_ pathname foryour APLWORKS.SYSTEM file using a block editor, and most folks don't findthis convenient.In a nutshell, I took (stole, borrowed) the code that ProSel 16 uses priorto launching a ProDOS 8 program (e.g. AppleWorks 5.1), hardcoded myAppleWorks 5.1 full pathname into it, renamed it as StartAW.System, andsaved it as a ProDOS 8 SYS file.Now, I launch this file from the Finder and it in turn, launchesAppleWorks. Now, I _never_ crash upon the second (or third, or ... ) launchof AppleWorks from the Finder, either on a 'real' GS or in Bernie. The lateProfessor Bredon had a few tricks up his sleeve, and from what I candeduce, his routine plays with memory and interrupts. His tricks work, too.If you (or anyone else) would like to test this (and are experiencing the'crash' problem on a fairly consistent basis), please send me your_complete_ pathname for APLWORKS.SYSTEM, I'll hard code it into the file,and e-mail it back to you for you to test. Just send your info to me at:hughhood@earthlink.netUnfortunately, I don't have any source code for the Bredon routines, andI haven't had the time to disassemble them well enough to write any.Hugh...(HUGHHOOD, Cat 9, Top 26, Msg 7)[EOA][CAX]CLASSIC AppleTalk SUPPORT ON A MAC RUNNING OS X"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Has anyone tried switching on classic AppleTalk support in OS X and seeingif their IIgs can connect to their Mac via a LocalTalk to Ethernet bridge?I switched on classic AppleTalk on my PowerBook, but since it's on AirPort,the IIgs can't see it, and I haven't gotten around to doing a hard-wire onthe Mac yet. :)Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 10, Top 6, Msg 15)>>>>>"""""I wasn't aware that OS X supported classic Appletalk.

Apossible third version (depending upon your point of view) would be the IIeLC Card for the Macintosh LC that was produced from 1991 until 1995.The original mandate was a reengineered Apple II plus motherboard withreduced chip count (thus reduced manufacturing cost) while building in somenew features.  The chip count was reduced from 120 to 31 while building in16K Language Card and upper/lower case support.  In addition the newAuxiliary Slot, replacing the Apple II/II plus slot 0, adding the abilityof 80 column text with the new 80 Column Text Card.  Also available was a64K Extended 80-Column Text Card giving you a full 64K of bank switchableRAM.  This version booted up with "Apple II" top center and usually had akeyboard with white key caps.One of the first (of many) motherboard changes allowed for a new graphicsmode, Double Hi-Res and Double Lo-Res.  The next big change was introducedin March 1985 with the introduction of the Enhanced Apple IIe that wasbasically a 4-chip change.  This change included a new processor (65C02 vs.6502A), new CD and EF ROMs (bug fixes mostly) and a new character generatorROM that now included mousetext.  This change pretty much brought the AppleIIe up to the same potential capabilities of the Apple IIc (introduced inApril 1984).  This version booted up with "Apple //e" top center and atsome point they changed the keyboard to one with black key caps.The second major version was the Platinum IIe that started shipping inJanuary 1987.  This featured a new "platinum" case and a keyboard with abuilt in keypad.  They also re engineered the motherboard again furtherreducing the chip count from 31 down to 24.  This new motherboard actuallystarted to be used in the late run beige IIe's starting around October1986.  Among the motherboard changes included the combining of the two CDand EF ROMs into a single CF ROM and the use of two 256Kb RAM chipsreplacing the eight 64 Kb chips previously used.  This machine also camestandard with a newly re engineered 64K Extended 80 Column Card that wasmuch smaller than the previous card.The third major version, the IIe LC Card, was Apple's attempt to provide atransitional path for schools from their Apple IIe's to Macintosh withoutneeding to scrap their entire software base.  Pretty impressive engineeringin its day considering they managed to reduce the entire Apple IIe to 5" x3" card.  This card was discontinued in July 1995.An excellent source for additional info would be Steven Weyhrich's Apple IIHistory site at http://www.apple2history.org/.Mark Percival - Syndicomm.com Apple II RTC Host"Midweek Madness!" every Wednesday night.7:00 PM - 9:00 PM PDT(MARK, Cat 18, Top 3, Msg 4)[EOA][ATL]TROUBLESHOOTING AN Apple IIe - Linux BOX SETUP""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I have been having an annoying problem since we came over toa2central.com/syndicomm.com a year ago.  My setup is an Apple IIe/SuperSerial Card/null-modem connection/Linux box.Sometimes when I should get a BB or menu prompt, ProTERM appears to hang.To recover I have to send the break command.  When I do this half the timeI get the proper BB/menu prompt and the other half of the time I getreturned to my Linux boxes prompt and I have to reconnect.  This has been aPITA but I've been living with it.Last night I was reading an old A2-Central article on the basics of serialcommunications.  When it spoke about software vs. hardware flow controlI started to wonder if this was my problem.  According to the articlenormal XON/XOFF works with a control character (ctrl-s, ctrl-q) to stop andstart flow.According to the ProTERM manual, default flow control is determined by yourmodem settings.- What is the default setting in a null-modem situation where no modem is  involved?- There is the ability to override the default settings.  What would be the  proper setting to properly override?  "R0" = Drop RTS  "R1" = Raise RTS  "D0" = Drop DTR  "D1" = Raise DTRAny help would be appreciated. :)Mark Percival - Syndicomm.com Apple II RTC Host"Midweek Madness!" every Wednesday night.7:00 PM - 9:00 PM PDT(MARK, Cat 21, Top 4, Msg 4)>>>>>"""""I guess I should explain why I think flow control might be a problem.I have noticed that the BB/menu prompts here have a embedded controlcharacters in it.

From what I understand this is normally the ctrl-s,ctrl-q to stop and start data.  It seems that this plays havoc with the BBsoftware as it seems to interpret these characters as something else.

I also download a Word document from onesite with details about doing this but I didn't bookmark it and haven'tbeen able to find it again. Here are the couple I did bookmark, though:http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/5704/dcc1.htmlhttp://www.tecno.demon.co.uk/dcc/dcc.htmlThe Word document I got had me do a few changes to the Windows registry butI'm pretty sure they are just there to support modem connections. I'vefound this handy as it gives me a way to trigger events and see when DCCgives up trying to negotiate a connection.It took a few changes to various things to get my serial port on the PC andDCC working at 57,600 bps like I wanted but I finally changed the rightthing. To test things, I started Spectrum on my IIgs and then DCC on the PCand told it to be a host and listen for a connection. It sent the modeminit string I had set up in the registry and waited for a connection. WhenI typed the word "CONNECT" into Spectrum (which is what I set the registryto trigger a connection on), DCC changed its window to saying it wasverifying user name and password and sent the word "CLIENTSERVER" to myIIgs followed by a packet of data that looked like this:0000: 7e ff 7d 23 c0 21 7d 21 7d 21 7d 20 30 7d 22 7d0010: 26 7d 20 7d 2a 7d 20 7d 20 7d 23 7d 25 c2 23 800020: 7d 25 7d 26 7d 20 7d 21 bb ea 7d 27 7d 22 7d 280030: 7d 22 7d 31 7d 24 7d 25 dc 7d 33 7d 33 7d 21 e00040: 7d 2a 5f c1 ea bb 7d 21 7d 20 c0 ab 5f c1 9d 7d0050: 2f 7d 20 7d 20 9c 2d 7e 7e ff 7d 23 c0 21 7d 250060: 7d 22 7d 20 7d 24 59 28 7e(NOTE: There may be typos in this as I typed it in here on my PC whileviewing the data on my IIgs.)I poked through RFC 1334 (PPP Authentication Protocols) and found thatthere should be a $C023 in there somewhere for PAP authentication and $C223for CHAP authentication.

Just take extreme care not to bend or break any of them.There is also the possibility the 65C816 itself is defective, or thecontacts inside the DIP socket aren't making proper contact with the pins(apparently that is common from continually reinserting and removing anaccelerator card such as a Zip or TransWarp GS).Also check the socketed ROM to see that it's properly inserted (it'sunlikely that's at fault, but try it if all else fails).Try the above and see what that does. A new motherboard can probably befound on eBay for under $5, but I'd see if you can't save this one first.ps - Another possibility is what your seeing is the built-in self testdiagnostic running, *but* I'd discount that because you mentioned thespeaker clicking (there is no sound until the end of the test).Mitchell Spectora_specto@alcor.concordia.ca(SPECTOR1, 3563.2, Delphi A2 web side)[EOA]------------------------------------             LETTERS TO THE EDITOR |------------------------------------[LTE]LETTER TO THE EDITOR""""""""""""""""""""Dear Editor:Thanks for keeping us updated as to the various Apple II issues beingdiscussed on online services such as Delphi and Syndicomm Online.I'm always interested to see which messages make the cut each month.
