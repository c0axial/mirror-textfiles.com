I'm in theprocess of putting together a companion web page for it right now.  Whilethere are a lot of BBS lists out on the net, I don't see one which covers,specifically, BBSes either run on old 8 bit hardware of the period, or elsevintage BBS software running in some kind of emulator.I've found a few of these boards so far - the well-known latenightbbs.com6001, which is an actual working ddial (IMHO, the coolest retro sitearound, but again, not really a BBS)...and I've found several Commodoreefforts so far.I'd like to put a list together on my page of just these kinds ofsystems...Does anyone know if such a list already exists?  I've googled butI haven't seen much in that department.Beyond that, can anyone point me to old Apple II / // / ][ sites (As anex-Commodore user, I never did get the nomenclature straight) that arerunning, say, GBBS or something like that via emulation or on actual Applehardware?  In an odd and some would say sordid turn of events, even as aCommodore user, the most memorable boards I was into were Apple boards.  Atleast, there was something about the Apple community where I lived (CentralNew Jersey) which made for good discussion.  And codes.  ;)Any pointers would be appreciated.   -Quag7 (www.frostwarning.com)(Quag7, a2c.community, Jan 18 2007)[EOA][MNO]Minimo"""""">> geoff wrote:  I looked at WML around four or five years ago.   Afterdoing some testing on several different phones, I decided that anyinterface made for the IIGS would be non-intuitive, at least compared toSIS.  I don't recall there being much content to consider it veryworthwhile, also compared to what was accessible by SIS.  It was alsodepressing to see cell phones having a higher color depth and a fasterprocessor to uncompress images--I think I recall that there was at leastone phone with a better resolution than a IIgs being available too. <<That brings me to another web-related topic I'd like to throw out there:What about writing an Internet-based utility that you could pass an URL toan image to, that would then turn that image into a GS-friendly form?For example, you could do something like:http://www.foo.com/gsify-image?url=http://www.bar.com/blah.jpg&width=200&height=120&mode=640And the image would be loaded by the utility, converted into a 200x120640-mode GS image, then returned to the GS.This would likely be faster than doing the conversion locally (especiallyfor JPEG), and could be done to allow scaling to a percentage, or to agiven width, or to retain aspect ratio, etc.In theory you could even specify a palette to use by MIME-encoding it andincluding it in the request.(Sheppy, a2c.a2pro_developers, Apr 16 2007)>>>>>"""""Rich (I can't remember his last name) has been working on an 8 bit HTMLviewer, which he is planning on making into a full 8 bit web browser, andhas been discussing it in comp.sys.apple2.programmer.  Not too long agothere was some discussion about this sort of utility and Blurry (don'tremember his real name) wrote a utility to do this that converts imagesinto standard hi-res.I haven't seen a lot of information about this but you can see somescreenshots of Rich's and Blurry's work at:    http://rich12345.tripod.com/htmlview/index.htmlI'm sure adding a way to specify the output format wouldn't be hard andthat way you could get HGR monochrome, HGR colour, DHR monochrome, DHRcolour, SHR320 monochrome, SHR320 greyscale, SHR320 colour, SHR640monochrome, SHR640 greyscale or SHR640 colour.  This would be in additionto your suggestions above for scaling, aspect ratio or whatever.By the way, instead of passing all this info in the URL why not just usethe HTTP POST method and use the body of the post to hold an XML documentor some other type of data that would tell the utility what all options youwant?  Heck, you could even pass it a chunk of binary data in the body (ie.the actual bytes of a TYPE structure in Apple II memory).  It would be aseasy to troubleshoot but it would transfer quickly and would take less workon the Apple II to put together the request.  Just a thought, though.(Jeff Blakeney, a2c.a2pro_developers, Apr 16 2007)>>>>>"""""There is a thread with this exact topic in comp.sys.apple2.programmer.  Iran across it the other day.I remember a bunch of us talked about this around nine years ago at aKFest.  I was strongly opposed to have somebody be responsible for hostinga server to convert graphics.  I claimed it is the responsibility of theWeb client to do this processing.I am willing to append my original argument that a proxy server on the samelocal network as the GS would also be functionally equivalent.You do not want to get in the business of running a free-for-all proxy.If the IIgs is too slow to decompress graphics, then somebody needs todevelop a hardware solution to decompress graphics much faster.  Or suck itup and wait (you can't expect modern performance on a 20 year oldcomputer).  Or use an emulator.Geoff(geoff, a2c.a2pro_developers, Apr 16 2007)[EOA][DSM]DOS 3.3 Master"""""""""""""">> WhollyMindless wrote: Is there a chance anyone would make a DOS 3.3Master for me so I can get something going...
