Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]            WELCOME BACK MY FRIENDS TO THE SHOW THAT NEVER ENDS            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     A new name, new online service, and new format may mean that this alllooks like a new electronic publication for the Apple II series ofcomputers.     Looks can be deceiving, can't they?     My name is Ryan Suenaga.  I was the last editor of the greatest onlinepublication for the Apple II of all time, _GenieLamp A2_.  I took the helmfrom Doug Cuff, who edited three Apple II publications: _GenieLamp A2_, _IIAlive_, and, of course, the dear, departed _A2-Central_.  My roots as awriter lie back in _GS+ Magazine_; my roots with the Apple II trace back tothe Apple ][+ in 1982; my roots in electronic communications to the localBBS's of the mid 1980's, and, of course, the GEnie (now Genie) onlineservice, the virtual center of the Apple II universe for many, many years.     In 1996, the wheels began to come off; GEnie became Genie, and newownership made the small esoteric online service even smaller by hiking itsprices to make it the most expensive service of its kind in the world.Even the most faithful Apple II user wondered if the nearly $20--ormore--charge for 9 hours of non-prime time use each month was worth it.Many decided it wasn't, and began to leave.  Many held on, hoping thatownership would see the light and grant relief to the longtime faithful,and with the exception of the aptly named and short-lived Genie Lite plan,that relief never came.     Survivors that they are, the Apple II faithful looked elsewhere for anew place to call home.  In late 1996, that home was found: Delphi.  Firstthought of primarily as an alternative to Genie, it became clear when amove to price Genie more competitively never came that Delphi would notneed to be a second home for virtual support for the Apple II.  It wouldneed to be _the_ home.     Economically priced, with equal access to users via the standard textinterface or the new fangled World Wide Web, Delphi has opened its doors tothe Apple II faithful.  It has surpassed Genie in both quantity and qualityof message content, and it is now clear: the future of Apple II onlinesupport is on Delphi.     _GenieLamp A2_, good ship that she is, had become drydocked; while itwas entirely capable of playing its part in the Apple II community foryears to come, the material that had been its backbone--postings by theApple II users on the Genie A2 Bulletin Board--had thinned considerably.  Anew port was needed to get her floating again.     It has been found.     Apple ][ Forever.     And forever on Delphi.                                [*] [*] [*]     For those of you unfamiliar with the history of _GenieLamp A2_, youcan check out the entire library of back issues--five years worth--on theWorld Wide Web, at:     http://people.delphi.com/rsuenaga     That's The Official Unofficial Home Page of _GenieLamp A2_ on theWorld Wide Web, hosted by, uh, me, its last editor.     What you're reading, The Publication Formerly Known As _GenieLamp A2_,will have its own home on the World Wide Web as well.  Unfortunately, it'snot ready yet, but it at least has a home.  It's at:     http://www.sheppyware.ml.org/~rsuenaga     If I'm lucky, it'll be updated by the time you read this.                                [*] [*] [*]     Oh, and about that name. . .     Sometimes, you make things harder than they need to be.  When Idecided the time had come to move from Genie to Delphi, I decided we neededa new name for the publication; after all, "GenieLamp A2" just didn't makeas much sense for an online service on Delphi as it did on Genie.     I thought long and hard about what to call the "new" newsletter.  _TheDelphi Oracle_ seemed a natural, until I discovered that the name wasalready taken.     Given that Apple II users tend to be some of the brightest peopleyou'll meet, I decided to take the question to them.  The _II Scribe_ Forumon Delphi sponsored a conference, asking for name suggestions and taking apoll.  Together with the help of some Apple II celebrities: Tim Kellers,operator of the _II Scribe_ Forum; Cindy Adams, KansasFest organizer; andMax Jones, editor and publisher of _Juiced.GS_, we picked a name we thoughtwas most appropriate.     Henceforth, _The Publication Formerly Known As GenieLamp A2_, is nowknown simply as _The Lamp!_, as suggested by that same Tim Kellers who runsthe _II Scribe_ Forum on Delphi.     Now, isn't that simple for everyone?                                [*] [*] [*]     A word (well, a few) on copyrights:  As the Apple II has moved fromstate-of-the-art to orphan to classic, and support has moved from usergroups to paper publications to the online world, incidents of copyrightviolation have spread wildly.  While this publication is not in the samecategory as an Apple II program, it is also subject to copyright.     In the credits of this publication, just as with _GenieLamp A2_, youwill find the guidelines for distributing and reprinting material in thepublication.  However, if you read carefully, you will also find that therestrictions are more stringent than with _GenieLamp A2_.     Basically, the restrictions are simple: _The Lamp!_ is to remainexclusive to the _IIScribe_ Forum on Delphi for the first thirty days afterpublication.  After that, I will post it on the World Wide Web at its homepage, at the URL listed above, and possibly elsewhere (the Genie A2libraries, for instance, are a possibility).     I have thought long and hard about this.  I realize that Apple II usergroups and newsletters are hurting for material, and some of the articlespublished in _GenieLamp A2_ made its way around the globe to userseverywhere.  But the fact remains that copyright is a big issue, one Idiscuss with others in the Apple II world daily, and protecting it isimportant.     If anyone from a legitimate Apple II user group or business hasinterest in being granted a no cost license to reprint parts or all of thisnewsletter regularly or distribute this publication more freely, they maycertainly contact me via email.  I'm not out to stop the world from seeing_The Lamp!_ and the light; I'm out to make sure I don't get taken advantageof in the process.                                [*] [*] [*]     Oh, and in case you missed my not saying it for the last month or two:KansasFest 1998 is alive and well and being planned for July 22-26, 1998 atAvila College in Kansas City, Missouri.  I hope to see you all there again.Ryanthelamp@delphi.comASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][OPN]------------------------------     A FUNNY THING HAPPENED. . . . |-----------------------------------Checking out A2 and A2Pro on Delphi"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

I'm not sure how the Spectrum telnet is setup, butit might be possible to telnet to your UNIX account with TopCat and run SISthat way. I can't think of any reason why that won't work and I'm sure Ewenwill correct me if there is something glaringly obvious why it won't work.What I was referring to was the latter situation--the code does not supportsuch a situation and will break. Hopefully it will just cause long pausesof inactivity and report an error, but the worst case is the system willhang. I tried to make SIS handle as many error conditions as gracefully aspossible.Geoff                      (SISGEOFF, 7498, GO COM A2 FOR)>>>>>   As far as Spectrum and its scripts are concerned, a TCP/IP Telnet"""""   session is just like any other session. Some things like 'Hangup'obviously will be ignored, but otherwise Spectrum sees the data like itnormally does. The connection of course is reliable, so there are no errorsor missing characters...This means that a script does not need to use Timeouts, except in specialcircumstances. You only really need Timeouts if you don't want to hangaround all day waiting for a slow server...So using TopCat to Telnet into a site that then behaves as if it was astandard Unix shell, should work just fine with SIS I would guess.But just to make sure that we cause no confusion here, using TopCat and SISin this way, is not the same as using SIS through a normal SLIP Internetconnection. That will not work, as the commands within SIS are incorrectfor such a connection.Let us know how you get on... Do it manually at first, that is connectmanually with the TopCat menu option then run SIS. If that works, we canperhaps set up a SISConnect script for TopCat and a Unix shell.Ewen Wannop - SpeccieMessage delivered by Crock O' Gold and Marinetti TCP/IP!http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ewannop/                      (EWANNOP, 7515, GO COM A2 FOR)PATCHING UP SIS   I just released a patch for SIS.

Now, Ithought that a good idea at the time, but never got around to doing that asI didn't have a soldering iron, and hadn't really looked into buying one.Boy, was that a mistake.  And dangerous.  Several days back (almost twoweeks ago), I was sitting and working at both my computers when all of asudden there was a BAMPF from the area of the GS.  I wasn't certain ifanything had happened because everything was still running.  I got up tolook around and started checking closely around my GS when I startedsmelling smoke.  At this point, the GS got shut down as fast as I couldmanage it.  Then I started taking things apart, and finally got to thesystem saver...removed the screws so I could take it apart, and the insidewas very black and had some melted plastic ans was quite hot, especiallyright above were the blown MOV was.At this point, the first thing that came to mind was all the times that Ihad left my GS running while I was gone.

(:So, my question.  What questions should I be asking the ISP's about theirservice?  Obviously I should ask what speed (and flavor) their modems are,and some other things I have gleaned from my lurking have come to mind, butI am not sure I have thought of everything. :)Do I need shell access, or can I get by with TCP/IP?  Is this differentfrom PPP?  Should I ask how many modems and customers they have?  Of courseI need to ask about money.  I don't plan on having a Web site, so howimportant is having Megs of space?

I'm a Genie refugee, though I still maintain my""""""""""""""""""""   account over there and check it regularly. I've hadDelphi for several months, but only started using it this past month, whenmy favorite sections of CompuServe converted to the new, ASCII-lesssoftware.I started off with an Apple //e, prolly about as early as they came out. Itraded it in for a IIgs in 1988, which served as an accelerated //e for agood many years. When I started plugging away at CompuServe (using Smartcomand an Apple Personal Modem, no less!), I learned my stock machine couldn'tdo many of the things I wanted it to - and so, with recommendations fromthe likes of Scott Everts and Loren Damewood, began a long series ofupgrades. I bought a second IIgs in '93 and ran a BBS until late summer'97. In May of this year, I bought a PowerBook 1400cs and registered a copyof Bernie, and now use the Mac as my school computer (a freshman majoringin computer science) and my Apple II at home.I do have a question about Delphi, though. I'm glad to find that thisservice has a text-based access that is becoming increasingly rarenowadays. But I keep hearing that the level of text access is decreasingwhile web usage is increasing, and that the future of Delphi lies in theWeb. Although Marinetti might change things, the Web as it exists today canbe very unfriendly to an Apple II user, with its inlines and applets andwhatnot.What I'm wondering is, how much longer will Delphi be a friendly place?

In making the plans to convertthe purely text based Delphi service to a Web  based service, theydeliberately set things up so that the message bases on both the text andweb sides are fed from the same data. That is, when you post a message onthe text side, that message is mirrored on the Web side forum software, andwhen you post a message on the Web side, that message is mirrored on thetext side forum software. This is because both the web and the textsoftware use the same message base files.The effect of this is that, with the use of Telnet, Delphi can keep thetext side software running as long as the hardware that supports itcontinues to function. :)Gary R.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                     MSDOS Utilities Graphic !nterface                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          Program Name:      MSDOS Utilities Graphic !nterface          File Name:         MUG101.BXY          Database:          Apple Operating System          File Size:         117248          Program Type:      New Desk Accessory          Author:            Peter Watson          Version Reviewed:  1.01          Distribution:      Shareware, $15 U.S. dollars, see ReadMe for                             details          Requirements:      125K of drive space (40K additional for text                             and preference files), System 6 or later, MFM                             capable drive     With GS System Software 6.0.1 came a file called the MSDOS.FST.Translated from Computerese, this was the Microsoft Disk Operating SystemFile System Translator, and it gave the IIgs the remarkable ability to readfrom disks formatted using the Microsoft Disk Operating System, also knownas MSDOS.  It required special hardware (a SuperDrive or equivalentconnected to a SuperDrive card, floppy drives driven by a PC Transporter ora BlueDisk card, or a Floptical drive), but it was an incredibleaccomplishment, of use particularly to those who needed to work with aMSDOS or Windows machine at work.     Unfortunately, Apple finished writing System Software for the Apple IIbefore they added the ability to write to disks formatted with MSDOS.  Thiswas almost tragic, as there was just as much need to write to MSDOS disksas there was to read from them.     Of course, being the creative, never-say-die bunch they are, Apple IIprogrammers took matters into their own hands, and Australian Peter Watsoncame up with MSDOS Utilities, a shell based set of utilities that wouldallow IIgs users with the proper hardware to not only read MSDOS disks, butto write to them and format them as well.  A cult shareware hit, it foundfavor with users who were comfortable with the command line interface,including myself, although I admit to having a cheat sheet of MSDOSUtilities commands taped to the shelf to my left.   Unfortunately for themore squeamish among us (meaning those who loved the grace of the IIgsDesktop and the graphical interface), MSDOS Utilities was intimidating anddifficult to use.     Faced with this dilemma, Watson went back to work, trying to integratethe power of the MSDOS Utilities with the friendly desktop interface of theIIgs.  The result is MUG!, aka MSDOS Utilities Graphical !interface, a NewDesk Accessory that attempts to bring the point and click mouse driveninterface of the IIgs to MSDOS Utilities.  How well did Peter do in hiseffort?     Installing MUG! was a simple process.  After using Balloon 2.0 NDA tounpack the archive, I copied MUG! and the other files in the archive to my*/SYSTEM/DESK.ACCS folder, and restarted (note for you IR fans: I wasunable to successfully start MUG! with IR).  As expected, MUG! showed upunder the familiar rainbow colored Apple menu after startup was complete.     Reading the documentation, it is clear that MUG! is far more ambitiousthan it would first appear.  Mr. Watson sought not only to bring to theApple IIgs user the functionality of writing to MSDOS disks, he sought tooutdo Apple itself by providing far more function reading MSDOS formatteddisks than the MSDOS.FST provides.     The MSDOS.FST can only handle floppy diskettes with the traditionaleight-dot-three file name (a maximum file name length of eight characters,followed by a ".", known as a "dot", followed by a three characterextension, identifying the type of file it is--in the case of a file namedLAMP.TXT, for instance, a TXT or text file).  However, MUG! not only readsthese floppies with traditional filenames, it can handle the Windows 95"long" file names, large removable media (such as Zip Disks or SyQuestcartridges), and even PC Transporter MSDOS partition files).     As previously mentioned, Apple's software does not provide for writingto MSDOS disks at all.  MUG!, on the other hand, will format disks, renamefiles, copy files, and rename volumes.     With a very clean, simple look, MUG! provides three different types offunctions:     File Functions;     Disk Tools     and miscellaneous and help functions.     The miscellaneous and help functions include the preferences, whichallow you to tell MUG! where your PC Transporter MSDOS partition files are,and to add/strip linefeeds while copying text files.  If you've ever beengiven a text file on a MSDOS disk with control characters at the end ofevery line, you'll appreciate this option; an "About" dialog; and the "ReadMe" help file, which will tell you all about MUG! as well as how toregister it.     The Disk Tools will give you the power to get information about aMSDOS formatted diskette (more information than you might have knownexisted!), change a disk's label (the volume name, in Apple II terms), and,of most people's interest, do disk copies (one MSDOS formatted diskette toanother, identical one, using one drive) and format MSDOS disks.Typically, Peter gives you more options than you can imagine with most ofthese--for example, the format dialog box lets you name the volume, choosethe interleave, do a "quick format", skipping the low-level formatting, oruse the standard GS/OS initialization dialog for those who want to simplifylife.     For most users, the heart of MUG! will be the File Functions--not onlycan you copy, delete, and rename files as well as create new folders, youcan set a file's attributes (to make it hidden or read only, for instance)and view files (either as text or hexadecimal)--something I find myselfusing regularly.  In keeping with a theme, "view file" doesn't do thefunction justice; you can also save the contents, copy to the clipboard, orprint out the file you're viewing.     I haven't found any drawbacks to MUG! at this point aside from theaforementioned inability to start it up with IR, and no bugs to speak of.Note, however, that until you pay the shareware fee and get a registeredversion, it will pop up a self-declared "annoying dialog box" to remind youyou still need to register it.  I find it an indispensable tool for anyonewho must use an MSDOS machine in addition to a IIgs.  Peter Watson'sperseverance has paid off in giving us not only incredible power, butincredible ease of use.  You've earned your shareware fee, Peter.     [EOA][WEB]------------------------------                  WEB SLINGING 101 |-----------------------------------Delphi Forums And The Apple II~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~by Ryan M. Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                Using Lynx To Check Out Delphi A2 and A2Pro                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The Apple II has always been, above all, flexible, and the DelphiOnline Service is much like the Apple II in that regard.  One of thehallmarks of the flexibility of both has been their ability to change withthe times.  The Apple II can read the oldest 5.25 inch disks runningAPPLEVISION, or a 2.88 meg 3.5 inch disk formatted under MSDOS.  It can actas a teletype terminal at 300 baud or cruise the Internet at 57600.  Delphican act like the old online service that is strictly text based and dial-upaccessible, or it can be accessed via the newest cable modems and Internetcruisers.     Not only has Delphi found a way to be very affordable for mostusers--with telnet access as low as $35 a year--it has even found a way togive free access to users coming in through the World Wide Web!  Users ofadvanced graphical browsers that are "cookie-aware" (more on this later)can check out the content in the Delphi Forums, as well as use a Java basedchat application that allows users to chat with other Delphi members.     Apple II users have not been totally left out in the cold.  Whilethere is no Java compiler for the Apple II series of computers--andtherefore no web-based chat--there are several web browsers which areusable with the Apple II.  Of these, the ubiquitous Lynx browser is able toaccess the Delphi Forums.     While the single graphical World Wide Web browser available to theApple II set, the _Spectrum Internet Suite_, is unable to handle"cookies"--small pieces of data set by your web browser at the request ofthe web site you are accessing--the latest versions of the UNIX basedbrowser Lynx (2.7 and later, current is 2.7.1), on the other hand, handlecookies well.  When you access Delphi via the World Wide Web, Delphiinsists on setting cookies, and Lynx can handle them while SpectrumInternet Suite is not yet able to.  You will have to allow Delphi to setcookies when you're accessing it with Lynx or any other web browser, or youwill not be allowed access.     If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) does not have a recent versionof Lynx installed, you can do one of three things:1) Ask them to install a more recent version;2) Use your personal space on their server to install your own; or3) Find a publicly accessible recent version of Lynx.     All of these are beyond the scope of this article.     Once you've started up your late model version of the Lynx browser,hit the 'g' key to go to a location, then type in:http://www.delphi.com/dir-login/index.asp     That is known as the Uniform Resource Locator, or URL.     This will take you to the area where you can sign in to Delphi.  Ifyou are new to Delphi, you can also sign up for a free account here.Simply fill in the blanks: Delphi needs to know your first name, last name,nickname, email address, membername (the name you will use on Delphi, whichbecomes your email address on Delphi--in my case, rsuenaga, hence the emailrsuenaga@delphi.com), password, zip code (if you're in the United States ofAmerica), and birth date.     If you already have a Delphi membership, you can log in here.  Simplyfill in your membername and password, then hit the "Log In" button.     It is possible that after you ask Delphi to register your membershipor let you login, you will get an error message asking you to P)roceed, useG)et, or C)ancel--if you get this message, hit the 'g' key to use G)et.You will then be logged onto Delphi!     Remember, while you can access the Delphi Forums (the message boards)via Lynx, you can't hit the Databases (libraries) or Conference (chatareas) with it.  For that, you would need a dialup or telnet account.     To get to the A2 Web page on Delphi, direct your browser to thefollowing URL:http://www.delphi.com/apple2     Here you will find some articles of Apple II interest, and informationabout Delphi and the A2 Forum.
