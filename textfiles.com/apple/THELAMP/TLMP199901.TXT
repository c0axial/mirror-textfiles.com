Many of us gotstarted on our Apple IIs just that way--booting up by 5.25 inch floppy,waiting for the ] prompt to show up, and typing away.  Many, many hourswere spent late into the night, scratching heads and reading manuals,wondering why this darned thing didn't work, or trying to figure out a newway of doing it.     A few months ago, Mike Westerfield of Byte Works gave Applesoftprogrammers the language they've waited their entire Apple IIgs lives for:_GSoft BASIC_.  Recently, he followed this up with _FREE.GSOFT_, a scaleddown version of the language which could be freely distributed--anincredible gift to The Rest Of Us.     In the late 1990's, Apple II users don't have a hundred new programscoming out each month--we have a stream of steady new software, but not aflood.  As such, it's time to do what the generation of Apple II users inthe late 1970's did: create our own future.     Apple gave us the tools in Integer and Applesoft BASIC to do that 20years ago.  Mike Westerfield gave us the tools to do it again in 1998.     In the spirit of teaching the Apple II user to fish, we need to havethe right nets.  _GSoft BASIC_ is the net The Rest Of Us have waited forsince that day in 1986.     Seize the day.                                [*] [*] [*]     Recess Is Over Department: I said you wouldn't hear it again 'tillJanuary.

And to be honest, itwas probably the most unlikely of projects I though would be brought to theGS.

Indeed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   there is.This is my normal way of running COG. I sign on to Genie via CoPilot, acustom script then starts up COG, which then connects me to Delphi. I readand reply to Delphi via COG, quit COG which automatically returns me toCoPilot, where I read and reply to Genie.In the COG2 archive that you downloaded (not sure if it was included inv2.6) is a folder called "Contributions". Inside that folder are a fewother folders with contributions from various people. One of thecontributions details how you can easily do what you're asking.Basically, you create a RT in CoPilot called 'Special'. Write a simplescript that says "Chain $spectrumpathCOG2:Rapid.Start" and name it"Genie.S.Special". Place it in your GEFiles folder. Configure COG to usethe 'Genie.Connect' method of connection and be sure to enter your Delphiscreen name and password. Check your 'Online Activities' in CoPilot to makesure that the 'Special' RT is checked. Also, be sure that the 'Special' RTis the last in the list of RT's to visit (I've placed mine in #11 justabove 'Mail'). Sign on to Genie via CoPilot in the normal way, and voila!After CoPilot does its' normal run, it will then connect to Delphi viaGenie's Telnet, run COG, and it will do its' normal run.Jeff Carr Sun, 13 Dec 98 @ 12:47:47Cruising the 'rainbow' path provided by:Spectrum v2.2 and Crock O' Gold v2.6                       (LUMITECH, 18345, GO COM A2)TRANSPROG III TIDBITS   For all of you using Transprog III... you can add"""""""""""""""""""""   COG to your TP III menu and launch it directlywithout having to launch Spectrum and then OA-R to run your script.I use it all the time... it is more of a direct route to where I wanna go..more useful things you can do with your GS  ;)Make sure that before you add COG to your TP III menu that you launchSpectrum from the Finder so that Finder updates the Desktop file. Thenquite back to the Finder and add COG to the TP III menu.If you don't do this, when you launch COG it will ask you to find Spectrumand Start.Cog each time you run COG from TP III.Leon                       (SARGENLE, 18221, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I've had COG set up in my TransProg III menu for ages.

Now I can choose to launchdirectly to Spectrum, COG or SIS from TransProg III.By the way, I've never run into the problem you mentioned where you getasked to locate programs and such but I believe it is sound advice.  Ibelieve I've never run into it because I never added a program to myTransProg III menu that I haven't run because I always want to make surethe program actually works before spending the time and effort to update myTransProg III menu.  :-) Jeff Blakeney - Dean of the Apple II University in A2Pro       ** HyperCard IIgs Course now in session! **                       (JBLAKENEY, 18240, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Besides the obvious of setting up documents to use as templates,"""""   one use that I make of this is to set up my UniverseMaster scriptsas documents.

You can specify whether or not to usecompression, specify certain filetypes and/or folders, days since lastbackup for a file, etc.  You can run scripts together as well by linkingthem in a chain document.  You typically perform backups for the first timeon a folder/drive from the UniverseMaster desktop, which creates thescript, or subsequently from the menus.  However...You can also use a program launcher such as Finder or TransProg III tolaunch UniverseMaster via a script or chain document.  When UniverseMasteris launched with a start-up document (as in double-clicking from Finder orusing the document feature of TransProg III), UniverseMaster scans thescript and specified folders, prompts for the destination path (if notonline), runs the script and then automatically quits back to the launcher.So, the ability to run these script documents from TransProg III means Ican decide to do a back-up at any time I am in a desktop program (whichreminds me - I have to set these up to 'stack' so that UM will quit back towherever I was, not just my program launcher). - Don (IronTooth)Delivered by my ANSITerm off-line reader scripts...                         They're OLRight!                       (DZAHNISER, 18391, GO COM A2)A2U'S WINTER BREAK ENDS   I should mention that I've just sent lesson 4 to"""""""""""""""""""""""   Jeff.

This way the AppleTalkon the back of the IIGS could be connected to the bridge, and subsequentlyinto the Ethernet hub.I do not know what boxes are available, and what power they do and do notneed, nor their speed. But I guess I need something like this:Standalone bridge with LocalTalk (mini-din-8) and Ethernet (RJ45)connectors. Switching (or at least 240V) power supply, with universal powerconnector so I can use an Australian power cable. Status lights would begood, in case I have trouble getting it to work with the IIGS.I counted up the posts re the MacIP module, and figure there's enoughsupport to put together a bridge to send to me. If I can get the bridge upand running, I'll release the MacIP driver. :-)  I like this idea betterthan taking money off folks. It may as  well go towards getting my machineback online so I can continue development.Oh, and the bridge would need to run without any drivers, it must becompletely self contained. Failing that, if you can get specs on theinterface, I may be able to work something out.Regards, Richard                       (RICHARD_B, 18465, GO COM A2)IMPROVING ON 6.0.1   What I always thought would be a nice idea is to have""""""""""""""""""   an 'on-line panel of reviewers' go over all theavailable 'quality' replacement icons and come up with a 'Delphi A2approved' set of icons for enhancing System 6.0.1.In fact, this potentially could be expanded to other areas of System 6.0.1(like an approved scrapbook NDA, text editor NDA, etc.) This way, ifsomeone is having system problems they can say something like "I'm runningSystem 6.0.1 and the Delphi endorsed enhancement package, version 1.0" andeveryone else will have a good idea of what their system set-up is like.Plus, it would provide a stable core of system enhancements which have been'field tested' to ensure there were no incompatibilities among them. Also,it would help developers when they beta test. They'd know that if theirprogram is solid with the 'enhancement package' during beta testing thatthere would be less likelihood of a bothersome post-release bug jumping up.After all, a lot of users would be running the same core of systemcomponents!Just a thought.Paul.Paul Schultzschultp@delphi.comsent your way via Spectrum 2.2 and Crock O' Gold 2.6                        (SCHULTP, 18853, GO COM A2)>>>>>   It's a good thought, Paul.

I needed one number for use as "no number on this line," and Iused 0 for that purpose. 0 is a legal Applesoft line number, though, andsome Applesoft "compressors" apparently started the line numbers from 0.Try renumbering the program, or at least that first line.If that doesn't work, or if this just isn't the problem, try to give mespecific information about the error you're seeing.In the end, though, GSoft BASIC is not a superset of Applesoft. It's flatimpossible to make all Applesoft programs run safely under GS/OS because ofdifferences in the way memory is handled. There are some Applesoft programsthat won't run, at least not without modification. The conversion programtries to point those out, but in general, PEEK, POKE and CALL statementsneed to be translated to a modern equivalent, and & commands just aren'tgoing to move at all.For some programs, it's worth the effort to move it to GSoft BASIC. GSoftBASIC is a little faster than Applesoft BASIC, offers long number formats,and can handle far more memory. But for other programs, it just might notbe worth the effort. That's really a decision for the person who wants touse the Applesoft program. :)Mike Westerfield                       (BYTEWORKS, 18659, GO COM A2)<<<<<   On the subject of translations, I'd like to make a request:"""""If you translate any public domain or freeware program, and if you aredonating the translation to the public domain or making the translationfreeware, please send me a copy.

Apple ][+and //e boards made their way into a lot of equipment that was built to doone/special things.  Like the numbers for who's pizza order was ready atthen, Showbiz Pizza Place. (It was a ][+ with a ROM card and program burnedinto ROM, just enter the order number on the keypad and hit enter. Enter itagain to remove it.

B. Changes have to be made on the           motherboard. Cut and connect some traces, add a few resistors.           I've done this before, but it's been a long time)   *READ* (C)1982, the (C)1984 Board also has a -A.1982 820-0064-B - The Second Issue. This board has the same ROMs as the -Aboard, the differences are the PAL change and board level changes mentionedabove. The PAL Part# is 342-0170. The ROMs are 342-0134/0135.1984 820-xxxx-A - Third Issue, Identical to the 820-0064-B except that part# 65C02, 342-0303/0304 and 342-0265 are silk screened on the board toreflect the new part numbers for the Enhanced ROM set. Also some parts ofthe production run had some of the ICs soldered to the board instead ofsocketed. Some boards have a part # of 820-0087-A, others 820-0187-A, somehave both these numbers.1986 820-0087-B, 820-0128-A, Fourth Issue, RAM and ROM reduction. Replacedthe two 64K ROMs with a single 128K ROM. (2764 x 2 for 27182 x 1). Replaced8 4164 DRAM with 2 4464 (64x1 x 8 for 64x4 x 2). More IC's soldered inplace. This is the board that shipped in the Platinum Apple //e withnumeric keypad.In all that there were 4 major changes that meant change the part number.There are probably 2 or 3 minor changes. Aside from the PAL (Europe,Australia) motherboard I have seen 8 different revision //e boards. Withthe exception of the first board, all can run either ROM set/CPU. For thelast revision you would need to burn your own ROM as the non-enhanced ROMset was never produced in a single chip (27128) version.The PAL versions of the //e motherboard also use the SAME ROMs. Only thecharacter generator and keyboard map (342-0132 in the US) were changed toreflect the local keyboard needs.Tony                        (T_DIAZ, 18808, GO COM A2)STRONG OPINIONS FROM A2   A Power Mac G3 and a copy of Bernie ][ the Rescue"""""""""""""""""""""""   is a better IIgs than Apple ever built.(With a few caveats; Henrik has my list of demands :)Eric "Sheppy" ShepherdMacintosh & PowerPC Programmers Forum                        (SHEPPY, 18445, GO COM A2)>>>>>   The reader in OLRight! 3 and later is far superior to any of the"""""   readers for the various Apple II and Mac OLR's for Delphi (andGenie or Compuserve, for that matter) that I've tried. - Ryan M.

This is a major development for the IIGScommunity because, if you'll recall, the commercial version sold for ashigh as $99.But there is more to the story than was published in Juiced.GS, primarilybecause I got some new information on the topic after the issue had alreadygone to press.Animasia 3D, in addition to now being shareware, has been upgraded toVersion 1.1b1. And author Michael Lutynski says that this new version is 33percent faster that Version 1.0!The only drawback is that the excellent manuals that accompanied thecommercial product are no longer available. At least not in printed form.The good news, however, is that all of the manual files =do= exist on myhard drive, and I will be working in coming weeks to get them into someshape for distribution. I will be posting more about that later.I will be uploading the Animasia 3D four-disk set to Delphi very soon.Meanwhile, if you would like the disks sent to you via U.S. mail, send $12in the U.S. Canada or Mexico ($15 elsewhere in the world) to: Max Jones Juiced.GS 2217 Lakeview Drive Sullivan, IN  47882Remember, this disk set does not contain manual files.

I'm not sure the language is totally dead, although it"""""""""""""""   does seem to be off the "way cool" list of languages  :)I sincerely wish that there was a viable 8-bit A2 PRODOS pascal compilerbut as far as I know, (and I could be wrong) you have to use the pascal OSif you want to use Apple's pascal.  That sort of limits the usefulness inmy very humble opinion._________  | homas                      (TCOMPTER, 2350, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Well, first, Pascal isn't a dead language, but like most, it's"""""   swamped by the C++/Java craze. It's also true that the originalsupporters of Pascal, the educational community, has largely moved oneither to Ada (more or less a successor to Pascal, and just as elegant) orC++ (they have to teach what people want, whether what they want is goodfor them or not). But Pascal is still used by a fair number of people,including yours truly.As for a viable 8 bit compiler, there isn't one, never has been one, andnever will be one. IMHO, there has never been a viable compiler of any kindfor any language for the 8 bit Apple II. The reason is simple: with 40K ofusable RAM and 1 256 byte stack you just can't implement a modern compiler.Not that there haven't been some good attempts. Apple Pascal is amazing forwhat it did with the resources available. Kyan Pascal claims ISOcompatibility--and I just saw someone in the internet Apple II programmersforum selling a copy. But if you want to write something longer than a fewhundred lines, Kyan Pascal won't do, and Apple Pascal will choke soonenough.ORCA/Pascal is quite decent, although the environment is dated by today'sstandards. It works, but it's not as nice as some of the modern ones. (Forit's day it was very advanced, but time marches on.) It runs on an AppleIIGS, and you can pick those up pretty cheep these days.There are several very nice Pascals on the Mac. I've used the Pascal thatcomes with Codewarrior, and generally like it. I've also used MPW Pascal.The environment isn't one I'm fond of, but the compiler performs well. Ipresume there are some nice ones on the Windows platforms, too, but Ihaven't used a Pascal on a Windows machine since the 8086 was a hot chip,so I can't speak from experience.For sheer poetry of the engineering kind, you might also look at the P4compiler. It's even public domain. This compiler isn't full Pascal, noteven full Jensen&Wirth Pascal, but it's really elegant for another reason.It's a complete Pascal compiler that compiles itself, and the source isexactly 4000 lines long. Pretty cool. :) The compiled output is P-code; itwould be easy enough to write a P-code interpreter in assembly language,Pascal, or C. I've compiled this compiler myself, writing p-codeinterpreters for the 8086, 6502 and 65816.Mike Westerfield                      (BYTEWORKS, 2352, GO COM A2PRO)>>>>>   Just wanted to chip in re Pascal.

Personally, I love MPW'sApple IIGS cross compiler.I've been doing a lot of Codewarrior Pascal under Mac OS and W98, and itspretty nice, once you realise half the Windows interface files aren'tthere, and have to write your own.FWIW, Windows is a nice development environment. I thought I'd hate it, butIMHO its more productive that writing for Mac OS.

We highlight the best of Apple II achievement in 1998.     Keep in mind that the ultimate decision on whom each award went to wasmade strictly by the staff here at _The Lamp!_, namely, me, your editor andpublisher.  Any comments can be directed to thelamp@sheppyware.net.     BEST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT:   There were a few contenders, but the     """"""""""""""""""""""""   program that Applesoft programmers havewaited 12 years for was the choice for 1998.  _GSoft BASIC_ from ByteWorks, giving the power of the Apple IIgs desktop to The Rest Of Us, wasthe winner in this category.  Others mentioned were _WebWorks GS_(Sheppyware/Shareware Solutions II), _NiftySpell_ (Shareware Solutions II),and the _GraphicWriter III_ and _Spectrum_ updates (Seven Hills).     BEST SHAREWARE PRODUCT:   To really unleash the power of your Apple     """""""""""""""""""""""   IIgs, you need to add to it a variety ofsoftware extensions--and fortunately, we have an abundance of them.Unfortunately, add too many and your system can become unstable, or at thevery least, have all kinds of problems using your modem at high speeds.  Toreally manage your extensions, you need _Shifty List_, the former _SoftdiskGS_ product now updated and re-released as shareware by Eric Shepherd.This extension for the Apple IIgs operating system allows you to choosejust which extensions you want loaded with your Apple IIgs when you shiftboot--and adds functions for playing sounds as you boot, or choosing one ofmany different sets of extensions on the fly.     BEST FREEWARE PRODUCT:   We have a tie, but the clear winner in all     """"""""""""""""""""""   of this are Apple IIgs game fiends.  Thelong-awaited Apple IIgs port of Id Software's _Wolfenstein 3D_, withprogramming by Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd and Logicware's "Burger" BillHeineman, is a winner just on its sheer size and complexity.  It is a truework of art, and a power packed action game.  The other winner is KelvinSherlock's _GShisen_, a devil of a game which seems like a simple, elegantMah Jongg clone, until you play it and realize it is the most addictiveApple IIgs game ever.     BEST WORLD WIDE WEB SITE:  Several were mentioned, but Tony Diaz's     """"""""""""""""""""""""   http://www.apple2.org, the Apple IIInformation Resource, won out by a hair over David Kerwood's A2-Web athttp://www.syndicomm.com/a2web.  A2-Web is the one-stop shop for your AppleII WebHead, but apple2.org offers technical information found nowhere else,and Tony's collection of rare Apple II hardware gives the Apple II user ataste of what was, and what could have been.     BEST PUBLICATION:   A few years ago, Max Jones decided to use his     """""""""""""""""   skills as a newspaper editor in Indiana to createa newsletter about the Apple IIgs.  Several years later, his _Juiced.GS_ isan international publication with a beautiful layout produced on an AppleIIgs.  Max himself does much of the writing but has contracted with AppleII veterans like Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd and Tony Ward to write about thetopics they are experts in.  Also mentioned was the Dean of Apple IIpublications, Joe Kohn's _Shareware Solutions II_, and, interestingly, thispublication, _The Lamp!_.     OUTSTANDING APPLE II RELATED DEVELOPMENT:   There were many nominees,     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   but Richard Bennett's_Marinetti 2.0_, the link between the Apple IIgs and the rest of thevirtual world was another instance of showing the world how to do whatcouldn't be done.  Thanks to Richard for an incredible piece of work.Runners up were those dogs of programs, the _Bernie ][ The Rescue_, _OpenBernie_, and _Sweet-16_ Apple IIgs emulators from Henrik Gudat, AndreHorstmann, and Urs "Cody" Hochstrasser, for turning otherwise boringcomputer into the Apple IIs of the 21st century, and the continuing successof the Apple II gathering known as KansasFest.     OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT:   While everyone programming the     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Apple II in the late 1990sdeserves a round of applause, Ewen Wannop, the author of the Apple IIgstelecommunications program _Spectrum_ deserves a standing ovation.  He notonly continued work on the affectionately named _Speccie_ and itsaccompanying Delphi offline reader _Crock O' Gold_,  he also helped bringout _BabelFish 1.0_, _Disk Access II_, the _TABBS CDROM_, and assisted withbeta testing for _NiftySpell_, as well as many other products we may noteven know about. . . yet.

Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                [thelamp@sheppyware.net]                               BABELFISH 1.0                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~          Product Name:      Babelfish 1.0          Distribution:      Freeware; available in the Delphi A2                             Database, Genie A2 Library, and Apple II ftp                             sites.                             Original specifications by Dave Hecker and                             Steve Stephenson, modifications by Dave Hecker                             and Bill Tudor.                             Programming by Bill Tudor.                             Bug fixes by Ewen Wannop                             Seven Hills Software Solutions          Requirements:      Apple IIgs; System Software 6.0.1     _Babelfish_ is an extension for the Apple IIgs System Software thatmakes the Apple IIgs even more flexible than it already is.  _Babelfish_allows Apple IIgs applications to import and export data in formats thatare not native to them.  Imagine having the ability to change a standardApple IIgs font into one you can use with _Print Shop GS_, or being able toconvert an Apple Preferred Format picture into a _MacPaint_ graphic.  Youcan with the _Babelfish_ package.     _Babelfish_ comes with the _Convert File_ New Desk Accessory, whichgives you a simple way to do your conversions.  Don't think that the_Convert File_ NDA -is- _Babelfish_, though--it's not.  _Babelfish_ canwork with applications that include _Babelfish_ support directly, such as_SuperConvert 4_.  For use in any desktop application, though, the _ConvertFile_ NDA is a practical way to access the power of _Babelfish_.     _Babelfish_ translators are available for graphics, sounds, fonts, andtext.  While there are many different kinds of conversions you can do, themost useful I have found are the text based conversions.  You can import_Teach_ or text files and export them as _Teach_, text, or HTML files.  Thesignificance of this can be made clear very quickly--if you have, forinstance, a documentation file you created as a _Teach_ file, you can use_Babelfish_ to quickly save it as a HTML file for easy posting on the WorldWide Web (perhaps to your Delphi workspace)--keeping much of the formattingintact.  No more retyping!     _Babelfish_ translator documentation is free for the asking.  Already,one additional translator has been completed--by Kelvin Sherlock of_GShisen_ fame, it takes an Applesoft program and converts it into a textfile, so you can edit it with your favorite word processor.     There have been some difficulties with _Babelfish_.  First, the_SFUtility_ file which comes with the package has given some users problemsbooting their system--after some investigation, Ewen Wannop, who helpedwith the debugging, has determined that the file is not needed and cansafely be deleted.  Additionally, some of the translators provided with thepackage (in particular, the sound translators) have some problems.  Theseare being looked into, but no fix is available yet.  The _Convert File_ NDAhas been noted to be incompatible with some programs.  Finally, there aresome programming issues with translators that have been covered in previousissues of this publication.     Still, _Babelfish_ has made a splashing debut in the Apple II softwareworld.  While there are problems with some of the parts in the package, itshows just how much potential the Apple II still has--and the generosity ofSeven Hills in making it freeware.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :    Wench: What you use to turn the head of a dolt.    :         :                                                       :         ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: LUMITECH ::::::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
