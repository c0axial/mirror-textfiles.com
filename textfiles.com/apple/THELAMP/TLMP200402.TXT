The Starlight Theater was an outdoortheater... hence the name.  After a hot, busy day, it is a delightfulexperience to take in a play in the cool of the evening under the stars.     But every so often the weather didn't cooperate.  A performance had tobe cancelled.  Sometimes a play was finished in the rain... members of theaudience had brought their umbrellas!     The man in charge of the theater had a dream... what if you had afolding roof that could be moved into place above the theater if needed.He built a model of his concept of how it would look and began promotinghis idea.  The idea caught on and private donations provided the funds tobuild it.  So starting last summer you could see a play under the stars andleave your umbrella home... if it rained they closed the roof!                              More Summer Fun                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Some people decided during KFest 2003 that they would be attendingKFest 2004.  Others missed last summer but plan to make it this year.     And there are those who have told themselves they would like to gosometime.  They didn't have time... or the didn't have the money.     Planning is what can make it happen.  Talk to the boss about time off.Start saving up some money.  It is just five short months until KFest.     KansasFest 2004 is planned for July 20-25, 2004 at Avila University inKansas City, Missouri.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[SLP]Syndicomm Lane - A SONG PARODY""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""After an absence of several years, here is yet another song parody for yourenjoyment...Syndicomm Lane(sung to the tune of "Penny Lane" by the Beatles, with no apologies sincethey are being unreasonable about the use of the name "Apple" inassociation with music)On Syndicomm, we find Bruce Baker posting photographsOf every KFest head found sleeping on the flo'And in the chat room those that come and go,stop and type "hello"On the Quill, we find Ken Gagne musing writing craftAnd then there's Gamebits, Showbits;He just never slacksThen there's Dave and Sheppy with their Macs,to update a pagenot so strange.Syndicomm is on the Net and on my screenThere with telnet text or World Wide Web I browse,and meanwhile backOn Syndicomm, they have a filter for the data flowTo try and keep the spam from filling up my screenThey try to keep their system server clean,It's a clean machineSyndicomm is on the Net and on my screenFor the Palm and Apple II, plus Newton,meanwhile backIn topic 5 I see there's talk about the "AnyCard"It should be here some year, at least that's what they sayAnd while the Big Cheese hears her iTunes playShe just knits awayAt Syndicomm, the online store sells stuff to customers,Suenaga's getting his "Juiced" deadline inAnd in an RPG match they spin, just to make a playVery strangeSyndicomm is on the Net and on my screen.It's for the Apple II and Palm plus Newton,meanwhile backSyndicomm is on the Net and on my screenThere with telnet text or World Wide Web .......Syndicomm!Steven Weyhrich <IX0YE>--<Apple II Historyhttp://apple2history.org(A2HISTORY, Cat 2, Top 13, Msg 123)>>>>>"""""Steve :)Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 2, Top 13.

Ithappens like this: I pick up the patient chart from the door, and then stepover to my pull-down desk to review what is in there. Why is the patienthere for this visit, what is the blood pressure today, what lab was donelast time and is any lab to be done on this visit, and so on. I also makesure that the papers I need in the chart are in the right order, so I canfind them at the right time. Sometimes while I am doing this quick reviewbefore I actually see the patient, I might be interrupted by apharmaceutical company representative who wants me to sign for samples, orto tell me of some great new breakthrough. Or it might be a notice thatthere is a phone call from the hospital that I have to take. Or possibly itmight be that precariously balanced stack of charts that have phonemessages that need to be done about an hour ago. In any case, after myreview and after whatever other interruption had come my way, I pick thechart up and head to the exam room. Which room? Why, that one over therewith no chart on the door, of course. Except... Mr. Green with thehypertension is looking rather different today; he is only 6 years old, andis banging his sister on the head with a book. Ooops, sorry; you'll beright after the patient I am seeing now. I leave the room and head to theCORRECT room, vowing to pay better attention next time to the room NUMBERwritten on the front. And, of course my nurse is laughing at me, because Idid it AGAIN. Makes me feel kind of foolish.     Well, as we examine this last year of the century (depending on yourdefinition of when the century truly ends), many people were caught up inthe media-led hysteria of all the terrible things that were going to happenat the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2000. All of these old computersthat RUN EVERYTHING were going to have the digital equivalent of a memorylapse as their primitive two-digit year counter swung around from 99 to 00,and suddenly were cast into the start of the 20th century. Banks would havelocked vaults, planes would loose control and fall from the sky, cars wouldfail to start, and equipment from here to China would malfunction as theytried to figure out what to do with 1900 instead of 2000. And the worstpart of it all was that there simply was NOT ENOUGH TIME to get out thereand fix this problem before disaster struck. It would be a cascade effectof computer failures that would risk civilization-as-we-know-it.     To prevent (or at least prepare for) this disaster, corporations spentBILLIONS of dollars upgrading equipment, or testing it to make sure it wasY2K-proof. At the hospital where I work, many types of equipment weretested and certified as Y2K-ready -- even the DIGITAL THERMOMETERS used totake patient's temperatures!! ("Oh, look Betty! This patient's temperatureis 124 degrees! It must be the one they missed that HAS the Y2K bug! Runand hide! We're all going to die!!")     However, we that were in the Apple side of the computer world couldafford to be smug about the whole problem, since OUR favorite computer wasimpervious to the Y2K bug. Unlike our Intel-based rivals, OUR internalclocks did not keep track of time based on MM/DD/YY, but rather on secondselapsed since the early part of the twentieth century, and so didn't reallyCARE about the transition from 12/31/99 23:59 to 1/1/00 00:00.     Nevertheless, in the midst of this smugness, there were some cracksbeginning to appear in the walls of the new Apple II home at Delphi, andthe universe got a little bit smaller. Let us now move the story into thislandmark year of 1999.FOOL ON THE HILL     During 1999, Turkey was shaken by an earthquake of 7.4 magnitude,which killed over 15,000 people. War broke out in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, aspresident Slobodan Milosevic began the massacre and deportation ofAlbanians, which resulted in a NATO military response. Two (disgruntled)students invaded Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, and initiated akilling spree that claimed the life of twelve students and one teacher, andultimately themselves. George Lucas released the long-awaited movie, "StarWars Episode I--The Phantom Menace". Although the U.S. House ofRepresentatives had impeached President Clinton of perjury and obstructionof justice, the Senate voted to acquit him. George W. Bush, governor ofTexas, announced his candidacy as a Republican for the 2000 presidentialelection. And computers became a focus of daily news reports, as the mediastirred up fears of a digital Armageddon due to the Y2K bug.     The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) introducedthe 802.11b protocol for wireless data transmission. Intel released the 500MHz Pentium III.  Microsoft released Windows CE 3.0 (sometimes abbreviatedas "WinCE", possibly referring to the difficulties in using it) forhandheld PocketPC computers. Color versions of these handheld computersbegin to appear. Prodigy, one of the early text-based online services,discontinued that text service in January due to Y2K-basedincompatibilities, with the company planning to focus on its Internetservice. And the wild ride of the Internet explosion itself continued, withDisney getting in on the action with the creation of the Go Network. Thecomputer viruses Melissa and Chernobyl caused more problems than Y2Kultimately did, causing several large corporations to shut down their mailservers to defend against its effects.     Apple Computer released its next iteration of the wildly popular iMac.Available in five translucent colors, the iMac 266 was similarlysuccessful. Later in the year it was replaced by the faster iMac 333. ThePowerMac G3 came out in a blue and white case that was the easiest Apple toopen up and get into since the original Apple II. It started at 300 MHz andwas bumped to 450 MHz mid-year. Slimmer and lighter than its predecessorsby two pounds, the PowerBook G3, code-named Lombard, was released. InAugust, the new PowerMac G4 was announced, featuring a math acceleratorcalled the Velocity Engine. Because it could do over one billion floatingpoint operations per second (a gigaflop), it was classified as asupercomputer. And in September, Apple's consumer laptop computer, theiBook, was released. It was the first commercial product to promote theIEEE 802.11b wireless networking protocol, which Apple marketed under thename "AirPort".THE LAMP! INFO     Editor Suenaga started what became an annual event for several years.The 1998 Apple II Achievement Awards appeared in the January issue, andawarded the Best Commercial Product to GSoft BASIC; Best Shareware Productto Shifty List; Best Freeware Product(s) to Wolfenstein 3D and GShisen;Best World Wide Web Site to Tony Diaz's Apple II Information Resource, withA2-Web coming in as a close second; Best Publication to Juiced.GS, withhonorable mentions to Shareware Solutions II and The Lamp!; OutstandingApple II Related Development to Marinetti 2.0, with honorable mention tothe Bernie ][ The Rescue and Sweet16 IIGS emulators; and OutstandingIndividual Achievement to Ewen Wannop for his work on Spectrum, Crock O'Gold, BabelFish 1.0, Disk Access II, the TABBS CDROM, and for help intesting Nifty Spell.     In February he gave his assessment of the "State Of The II, 1999",declaring that the presence of quality emulators like Bernie ][ The Rescueand Sweet16 were making it possible for the Apple II to have yet anotherchance to make a comeback. Whether or not it would do so was up to thosewho used it.     In the September editorial, Suenaga announced that due to workschedule changes, he was finding it necessary to stop doing The Lamp! as ofthe December issue. He had missed his personal deadline of a mid-monthrelease one time too many, and he felt that he had to let go of SOMETHINGin his life to regain control of things. In October, he announced that thenew editor would be Lyle Syverson, who had an article appearing in thatissue.     One thing that I had forgotten to mention when I was going through1998 was a small change in the masthead for The Lamp! Whereas it hadoriginally listed Suenaga's Internet mail address as "thelamp@delphi.com",by the December 1998 issue it had changed to "thelamp@sheppyware.net", andremained that way through 1999: ________________________________________________________________________|                                                                        ||::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::||The Lamp!

Suenaga, M.S.W., L.S.W.||Internet Email....................................thelamp@sheppyware.net||::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::||________________________________________________________________________|     In his final editorial, Suenaga discussed the balance needed in life,and how his change of work had put things OUT of balance for him, thus theneed to remove something (being editor of a monthly publication) to restorethat balance. He also vowed to stay very involved with articles for TheLamp! and Juiced.GS, as well as a "few other projects which you all mightbe interested in (and unfortunately I can't really talk about right now)."He also thanked those in the Apple II community who had been his supportersand helpers, and turned things over to his new editor, Lyle Syverson.FORUM NEWS     During the entire year, Delphi was working on mirroring theirtext-based content to be accessible from a standard web browser. By the endof the year, their focus was almost exclusively on the Web part of theirservice.     In the A2 Forum, the issue was raised again about the files from theGenie A2 library archive, and when would they be available in the Delphi A2library. The same answer was given as before, that there were copyright andpermission issues to overcome in some cases, but for the vast majority, itwas simply a matter of the volume and the time needed to upload them all.Tony Ward was the A2 Database Manager on Delphi and was working on it as hewas able. Gary Utter mentioned the possibility of the creation of a CD-ROMof software from the Genie A2 library that could legally be reproduced.     In his role as librarian, Ward posted some detailed information in theMarch issue as to the rules for uploading files to the Delphi A2 library.These were primarily rules on naming the files, and creating ShrinkIt andBinary II archives.     Also in the March issue was the announcement from February that theApple II User Forum on CompuServe (APPUSER), the one that was stillaccessible with a standard Apple II, had finally been closed down. Joe Kohnwas the one who first discovered this, and in the Apple II area that hadbeen created within the Mac Forum it was also Joe who managed to post thevery first welcoming message. The content of that message was, of course,"Apple II Forever!"     Interestingly, the text-based forums on CompuServe had been run foryears on old _36-bit_ mainframe computers, and the corporation had been inthe process of changing to newer 32-bit computers to support their onlineservice. Unfortunately, keeping ASCII access available was a cost thatCompuServe had decided not to spend, and so those text-based forumsdisappeared.     As before, when America Online discontinued access for Apple II users,it was suggested that they be encouraged to come over to Delphi A2, wherethe major part of the Apple II online community had moved.     Daylight-savings time weekend in April saw a nuisance bug hit theForum as a result of Delphi installing an upgrade to synchronize the textand web message posting. This bug caused a large number of messages to beduplicated in the A2 Forum (as well as most other Forums hosted by Delphi).This played havoc not only with those doing automated offline messageprocessing, but also for editor Suenaga in his efforts to collect messagesto include in the May issue.     In March, Mike Westerfield began an online course "Learn To Program InGSoft BASIC". It was divided into fourteen lessons, based on his tutorialbook of the same name, and followed the Advanced Placement Computer Sciencecurriculum.     Shareware Solutions II's multi-system chat became a mono-system chatin April when Genie became inaccessible (and CompuServe had alreadydisappeared). After the Genie A2 Roundtable chat area was again functional,the multi-system chats resumed.     Late in the year, Delphi became less friendly for the Apple II usersaccessing it via direct dial-up. Delphi announced that it was no longergoing to have its own dial-up numbers via SprintNet as it had traditionallydone. Instead, to get to the text side of Delphi, it was now necessary tolog on using telnet. In essence, Delphi took one more step away from thetraditional online service, and one step closer to being an Internet-onlycontent provider. In the November issue, Suenaga, Howard Katz, and LyleSyverson wrote an article detailing how to get to Delphi via text.GENIE INFO     Some people on Delphi were still asking for information about how tosign up for Genie; the costs and advantages (primarily the huge filelibrary) were mentioned in brief in February. However, Apple II users onGenie began to experience "blackouts" during 1999. The May editorialmentioned that as of late April and for the three weeks following, the A2Roundtable on Genie had been completely inaccessible both to staff andnon-staff members. Repair efforts were apparently not being made veryquickly to resolve this problem, further clarifying that the focus of thecompany that was operating Genie did NOT have service of their currentcustomers in mind. Dean Esmay commented that a major part of the problemwas that there were no longer any programmers or staff engineers working atGenie who knew anything about the GEIS (General Electric InformationSystems) network. The result was that if something stopped working, it wasnot possible to fix it. He pointed out that it had not even been possibleto sign up for a new Genie account for the prior TWO YEARS, due to a Y2Kbug that would not allow the system to accept credit card expiration datespast 1999.     By early summer, the A2 Roundtable on Genie was again functioning, butits access was not reliable. By the latter part of the year, some A2refugees were hanging out in the Mac Roundtable, since THAT was stillworking.     The number of people using the Genie service as a whole (A2 and all ofthe other forums) had been steadily dropping in the years since the sale toYouvelle/IDT, and the quality of customer service provided by Genie'smanagement was questionable. They had the habit of announcing lofty plansthat never came to pass, and also of making sudden changes with very littleprior warning. Near the start of December an announcement was made that notall Genie subscribers noticed: As of December 27, 1999, the text-basedservice that Genie had used from the beginning would be discontinued, andGenie content (what remained) would be available only from a web browser.Since Genie contracted with individuals to host and manage the Roundtables,there was also disagreement as to the ownership of the messages and contentposted therein. Some sysops disagreed with the transition to the Webwithout Genie management even asking permission to mirror their messages.The disagreement escalated in some cases to the point that some sysops tookpains to delete as much as possible from their Roundtable, before it wastaken beyond their control.     According to newsgroup messages (found on http://groups.google.com, inthe alt.online-service.genie topic), some members of the SFRT (ScienceFiction Roundtable) were planning on a wake to be held on thatdiscontinuation date, 12/27/99. They were then likely to migrate to one ormore independent web sites to continue their community.     On that same newsgroup, Nic Grabien, the Managing Sysop for the GenieSFRT, posted an official "time of death": 12/30/99 14:15 PST. His messagestated that the system still answered the dial-up, but it did not respondwith any content. (Sort of like someone whose body is maintaining a beatingheart, but who has no brainwave activity, and is declared to be clinicallydead). At this point, any remaining contact with Genie was purportedly tobe via the Web only, at www.genie.com.HARDWARE NEWS     In the January issue, Tony Diaz gave a detailed description of thehistory of Apple IIe motherboard revisions, including ways to identify aspecific board. Later in the year, he and Jeff Blakeney discussed theRamFAST card, focusing on its use with the larger-sized hard disks thatwere affordable in the late 1990's, as well as issues associated with usingmore than one RamFAST card at one time.     Tony and solder slinger Harold Hislop also gave a short tutorial aboutpower supply replacements for an Apple IIGS, and how to pick what type touse. It was pointed out that "underloading" the power supply (having astronger supply than was needed by the computer) could be just as much of aproblem as OVERloading it.     The Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 series had been a favorite of Apple IIusers for several years. In 1999, HP was releasing some new models toreplace these, and Joe Kohn discussed which ones would NOT work on theApple II, and how to identify those that would.     A nugget of information from the past was posted by Chuck Stiles aboutthe ImageWriter II printer, regarding the special button-presses necessaryto set print darkness and run a self-test on the ImageWriter II. Honeybee,Gary Utter and others, gave further information in April.     Stiles also posted news about placing an order for 65816 processorchips (for the Apple IIGS) built to run at 14 MHz, at a price of only $6.18each. However, this price was only good for orders of at least $100 sent toa single address, and so he was looking for others who also were interestedin placing such an order.     The lifespan of the Apple IIGS clock was brought up as a topic ofdiscussion in August. This clock is based on a 32-bit integer that countsseconds from January 1, 1904 to the present. As a result, this number willoverflow on February 6, 2040 after 6:28 am. At that time, the IIGS willhave its own "Y2.04K" problem, and the clock will reset to 1/1/04, 12:00am. And that bridge will have to be crossed when it comes...     Sequential Systems was planning on making one final run of RamFASTcards, after they had received at least 200 pre-orders. This was likely tohappen, as Habanero in his announcement about it said that he had placedorder #199.EMULATOR NEWS     Bernie ][ The Rescue 2.0 was announced in the January issue, and ithad been updated to v2.5 by September. That revision introduced BernieTotal Integration, which simplified file transfer between the emulatedApple II and the Mac on which it was running. This was accomplished byfully implementing "drag and drop" and through the vehicle of targetedfolders on the Mac and on the emulated IIGS. A modification to this releasewas soon needed, after it was found that some Delphi messages weretriggering an Easter egg in the program that caused the program to "bark"when certain text strings were received through the serial port. Bernie wasalso quickly updated to 2.5.1 because of an error that prevented the launchof ProDOS 8 programs from the Finder.     February saw the introduction of a beta version of Sweet16, atranslation of Bernie designed to run under the BeOS on Intel-basedcomputers. In May, Eric Shepherd had taken over the project from F.E.Systems (although they still maintained ownership). By early July, it wasready for release. One advantage Sweet16 (informally known as "Ernie")offered over Bernie ][ The Rescue was the ability to make use of multipleprocessors if present on the computer running it. A new web site was setup, www.emulate.gs (using the ".gs" country code designated for the SouthSandwich Isles). Bug fixes and enhancements resulted in Sweet16 updates tov1.1 by September, and v1.2 the next month.     Some discussion ensued about whether or not to allow an emulated AppleIIGS to exceed the hardware features of a true Apple IIGS. The advantagesof evolving it centered around adding "hardware" features that would neverappear in a real IIGS (since they were no longer being manufactured),versus leaving the hardware alone, since all of the existing softwaredepended (to some extent) on a predictable hardware architecture.     Benchmarking the various real and emulated Apple IIGS computers wasalso a topic of discussion. Mike Westerfield of The Byte Works used as hisbenchmark the time needed to do a full compile of GSoft BASIC. He used hisPowerMac G3 running at 300 MHz to compare Gus (the emulator started atApple and then abandoned), Bernie ][ The Rescue, and a true Apple IIGSrunning at 9 MHz. The results:PowerMac G3/300, Gus........ 66 secondsPowerMac G3/300, Bernie..... 72 secondsApple IIGS, 9 MHz ......... 753 seconds     Sheppy chimed in with his own benchmark, which he called the WolfyMark(the time required to compile Wolfenstein 3D in ORCA/C):Apple IIGS, 9 MHz .................................... 6300 secondsPowerMac 8100, Bernie ................................ 2700 secondsPowerMac G3/266, Bernie ............................... 105 secondsPowerMac G3/266, Gus ................................... 92 secondsPowerMac 8500 dual 180 MHz, Sweet16 (BeOS) ............. 82 secondsPowerMac 8500 dual 180 MHz, Bernie (SheepShaver MacOS).. 72 secondsSOFTWARE NEWS:: PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE ::     The Byte Works released FREE.GSOFT, a free scaled-down version ofGSoft BASIC. GSoft BASIC itself was updated to version 1.2.      Patches were posted in January to make I.CALENDAR, the AppleWorks 5calendar add-on, work for the year 1999. In October, patches were posted tomake it work for the year 2000.     Juiced.GS announced the release of Animasia 3D as a shareware product,although not including the manuals that had been part of it when it was acommercial product.     Self-proclaimed Applesoft-aholic Gerry Wright offered a method oftransferring The New Print Shop from 5.25-inch disks to 3.5-inch disks.     Howard Katz and The Lost Classics Project received permission torelease Q Labs software as freeware. He also was able to get Deja II (theAppleWorks 5.1 emulator for the Macintosh) and Kitchen Sink Software titlesreleased.:: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE ::     Sheppy wrote gsAIM, an America Online-compatible instant messaging(AIM) client, based on Marinetti technology. The beta version was releasedas a Delphi-only product (since it was a just a beta). In February, theofficial 1.0 version was released. Unfortunately, gsAIM had a short life,after AOL added code to lock out other instant messaging clients(specifically MSN Messenger). He also wrote an NDA called ShepPing, toallow a user to "ping" a network web site or address. It was not completed,however, due to some difficulties with the available version of Marinetti.     Don Zahniser's offline Delphi message manager for ANSITerm, OLRight,was updated to v4.0. Ewen Wannop's Spectrum-based offline manager, Crock O'Gold, was near to a 3.0 release in February, and when it did becomeavailable was well received. A bug release bumped the version to 3.1 bymid-year, and v3.2 appeared in September.     Geoff Weiss released GWFTP, an FTP client for the Apple IIGS. SIS(Spectrum Internet Suite, the Apple IIGS web browser) was updated to 1.1 inApril.     Jeff Blakeney and others debated the merits of BinSCII vs BinHex forfile compression and transmission.:: UTILITY SOFTWARE ::     In February, a long discussion was reprinted that outlined differencesand advantages between two competing IIGS printer drivers, Independence andHarmonie.     Chuck Newby of Charlie's Appleseeds had for many years been theofficial sales source of Glen Bredon's ProSel and ProSel-16 Apple IIutilities. On March 6, 1999, he announced that Bredon had changed bothproducts to public domain status. Consequently, the full versions of theseprograms were made available in the Delphi A2 library. Charlie's Appleseedsplanned to continue to provide copies on a floppy disk for a nominal cost,to cover disk costs and shipping. Bredon stated in his e-mail to Newby thathe was NOT planning on supplying the source code, primarily because hisIIGS hard drive had been getting "touchy" in its latter days and it wouldbe hard to put it all together. Additionally, he was concentrating ondigital photography with his new PowerMac G3, and offered a web siteaddress to go and see his pictures. (Interestingly, even though Bredon hassince passed away, this photography web site is still up -- you can view itat http://www.sierratel.com/bredon). Later in the year, Tony Diaz releaseda patched set of ProSel files, intended to address some Y2K issues.     Ewen Wannop announced the availability of the !HELP! NDA from his website. Previously it had been available only on disks with the software hehad written.:: GAMES ::     NinjaForce announced another delay in the release of KABOOM!, an AppleIIGS game they had been working on since at least 1997.     Silvern Castle by Jeff Fink was released at KansasFest 1999. The game,written in Applesoft BASIC, had originally been sold in 1988 to Softdiskbut was never published. Fink, who still retained rights to the program,improved upon the original game and finally made it available to the world.Written in the style of the older Apple II game "Wizardry", the gameinvolved creating characters and going into a maze to fight monsters. Theultimate goal was to recover the lost Crystal Orb of the Wizard Drachma. Itwas sold as a $15 shareware game. By the end of the year, he had updatedthe game to v2.1.HACKING     In the February issue, Scott Alfter posted info about how to patchProDOS for the year 1999 and beyond, giving a detailed explanation on howto do it for future years in which the clock code would need to be changed.The ProDOS filing system had its own date related bug, related to theoriginal Thunderclock driver on which it was based. Instead of having alimit of two digits for the year, as was the problem with the Y2K bug,ProDOS had NO place to keep the year for a file. Instead, a date for filestamping was determined from a look-up table that was good for only aboutseven years before it had to be patched. Based on the patch for ProDOS2.0.3 that Alfter posted, the next time that it would be necessary to patchProDOS would be after February 28, 2004. (Hmmm, that's not too far fromnow...)     Much discussion took place in the April issue about how to create anApplesoft window in the Finder desktop on the Apple IIGS, similar to theMS-DOS window in Windows. Possible uses for this included being able to useApplesoft as a scripting language. Some also wanted to hack the ProDOS FSTin order to modify it to be compatible with larger disk volumes. On furtherdiscussion, it was suggested that to have a utility to repair the HFS FST(when a volume went bad) would be more useful (and manageable).INTERNET NEWS     The Apple II Web Ring expanded further in 1999, with the addition ofGeorge Wilde's web site (author of UtilityWorks and UtilityLaunch); HAAUG(a user group); Russel Nielson's software web site; and the Apple II GamingResource.     "Ask Jeeves" was first mentioned in April as a new search engineallowing queries to be made in full sentences. (This is still available athttp://www.ask.com).NETWORKING     More messages appeared on how to connect an Apple IIGS into aMacintosh AppleTalk network, with the additional benefit of bridging it tothat Mac's Ethernet connection. It was recommended to obtain (relatively)inexpensive Macintosh SE/30 or similar computers on the used market,install an Ethernet card, and then use these to hook up the IIGS into theMac network. Mike Westerfield presented some of the most detailedinformation in the April issue.PUBLICATIONS     Juiced.GS continued publication throughout 1999. The start of the yearsaw a listing of the contents of the final issue for 1998, and eachsubsequent issue's contents were posted when it was ready to ship.     Shareware Solutions II mailed out Vol 4, Issue 3.     The AppleWorks Gazette received its first mention in over a year.Co-editor Howard Katz posted an explanation for the absence of thepublication. The person who was working with him on the project, ChrisSerreau, had disappeared (literally) in 1997. In the two years since, Katzhad not been successful in any fashion in making contact with him, plus jobchanges made it difficult to try to continue the publication on his own. Tothis very day, the fate of Chris Serreau is unknown to Katz or anyone elsewith whom he has spoken.COMPANIES     Sheppy announced that the computer SheppyWare was using as an Internetserver had been upgraded to have 120 MB of RAM, and an additional 500 MB ofdisk storage, which he felt would provide room for future expansion. Asmentioned above, he released gsAIM, ShepPing, as well as IdleTime. Updateswere posted to these products: Shifty List v2.0.2 and v2.0.3, WebWorks GS1.2.1, and ImageMaker 1.0.     An unfortunate turn of events was announced in the October issue, whenSheppy stated that he was putting his Apple II software development onhold, due to hassles from a few complainers that dampened his enthusiasm.     Joe Kohn and Shareware Solutions II came to an agreement with Vitesseand Bill Heineman to allow him to become the new publisher of Harmonie. Healso got permission from Steve Disbrow to sell EGO Systems' unsoldinventory, specifically Balloon, Cool Cursors Volume 1, IPC Spy ModulesVolume 1, AppleWorks GS WP translator for GraphicWriter III, and the RTFTranslator for GraphicWriter III. Kohn also reminisced on May 21st that ithad been 12 years ago to that day (May 21, 1987) when Applesig on TheSource (which he had set up for them) went online.     Seven Hills Software made a change in web server to MyESource.com, butthen began to fade from the Apple II world. They announced a sale on IIGSsoftware later in the year.     NinjaForce announced a new web site in late 1999,http://www.ninjaforce.com (which is still working today).KANSASFEST     The 11th KansasFest was held in 1999. The mailing list was re-openedin January, and in February, registration was opened. InTrec Software, Incsponsored the event.     At the event, Max Jones gave the keynote speech, and the guest ofhonor at the roast was Ewen Wannop.     Ryan wrote "The KFest FAQ" to answer those, well, frequently askedquestions. Doug Cuff's "Accidental Tourist at KansasFest" was updated for1999.     Pat Kern was again offering pictures of past KFest's on a CD, covering1994 through 1998. After KFest 1999, she added the pictures for that eventonto the CD.     HackFest this year included fourth place awarded to Jeff Blakeney (aGSoft BASIC program), third place to Richard Bennett (an iMac mouseemulator for the IIGS), second place to Shawn Beattie (for a Y2KFestcountdown program), and first place to Ken Gagne for a Spectrum databaseprogram. Also, Cindy Adams was awarded fifth place for writing a Spectrumscript "because she could".     Sessions included one on GSoft BASIC; how to use Print Shop GS andPrint Shop Companion; Tony Diaz' new CD-ROM collection, A2-ROMulan; ademonstration of QuickTime 4 from Craig Foos of Apple Computer; and Sheppydid a presentation on BeOS.     New products included Keepsakes of KFest CD (by Pat Kern), TheCompleat Lamp CD, the Friends For Life CD (by Max Jones), SpeedReadPlus (byTerry Morris, demonstrated by Max Jones), the Bernie ][ The Rescue StarterKit (by Ewen Wannop), the Marinetti MacIP Link Layer module (by RichardBennett), and Silvern Castle 1.0 (by Jeff Fink).     The planning for KansasFest for 2000 was so ready that theregistration form was placed in the December 1999 issue (perhaps they wereworried that there wouldn't be anywhere to post it for a while afterJanuary 1, 2000?) The event was nicknamed "Y][KFest", in honor of thefamous Y2K bug that did NOT affect the Apple II or IIGS.REVIEWS     Ryan Suenaga reviewed these Apple II products:o BabelFish 1.0o FontPimp 1.0o Castlewood Systems Orb DriveWRITERS     Suenaga was pleased to add content written by Tee Cashmore in theApril, June, July, and November. He contributed articles on computingdevices to assist the disabled, use of the PC Transporter, accountingsoftware for the Apple II, and the results of a survey that she had postedon Delphi about Apple II users on Delphi, and how they connected to theNet.     Though not strictly an article, it could have been submitted as one ofthe old "Humor Online" articles from GenieLamp. Habanero had posted a storythat was reproduced in the April issue, all about Bill Gates and Paul Allenand their programming practices from back in 1974. (His two previousstories appeared in the 1998 series of Lamp newsletters; check out the LampIndex if you are interested in finding these.)     Finally, editor-to-be Lyle Syverson submitted his first article in theOctober issue about the use of HP DeskJet printers and the Apple II.MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES     Sheppy announced that he had written some new technotes for the AppleII, specifically documentation of new IPC request codes, and how toidentify whether or not a program was running on an emulator (and if so,which one).     Suenaga wrote an article about scripting with Marinetti in the Julyissue. In December he wrote "Y][K", briefly extolling the positive aspectsof using a 20-year-old computer platform, and all it could do, despite theangst the rest of the computer world was experiencing in its anticipationof the unknown passage past 12/31/99.STATS     Here are statistics for the first eight years of GEnieLamp and TheLamp! The numbers refer to the size of each issue in "K" (kilobytes):Year    Min     Max     Avg----    ----    ----    ----1992    116K    212K    156K1993     80K    256K    172K1994    124K    216K    165K1995     92K    176K    125K1996     80K    192K    116K1997     44K    124K     85K1998     68K    156K    102K1999     59K    120K     91KWON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN     Did the world come to a screeching halt when that big ball dropped inTimes Square on December 31st? Did a new dark age come across the planet?Did the humans, now shrouded in darkness with the loss of their electricalpower, automobiles, and airplanes, fight each other for the rotting remainsof groceries in vandalized Wal-Mart stores? Well, you'll have to wait untilnext time to get that answer. In the mean time, you might want to set theclocks in your non-Apple computers back a ways to avoid disaster...Steven Weyhricha2history@syndicomm.comhttp://apple2history.orgReferences:Computer History For 1990-2000http://www.computerhope.com/history/19902000.htmHistory of Computing Industrial Era 1994-2000http://www.thocp.netInformation Please: 1999http://infoplease.lycos.com/year/1999.htmlLowEndMac.comhttp://www.lowendmac.com/history/1999dk.shtmlTimeline of the 90s, 1999http://www.inthe90s.com/generated/time1999.shtml[EOA][ANS]-------------------------------      ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNDICOMM |------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[TSU]TO SIGN UP FOR SYNDICOMM ONLINE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Please visit our web site at http://www.syndicomm.com for information or tosign up!(Logon message)[EOA][SNA]SyndiChat v1.2 is Now Available"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""SyndiChat v1.2 is now available.
