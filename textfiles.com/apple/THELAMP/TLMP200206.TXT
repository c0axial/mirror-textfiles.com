I've read an article by a Jim Pittman that was in theAppleQuerque user group newsletter in Feb 1996. In that version, Mr.Pittman discovers someone who used to work for Apple in early 1993, who hadthis old prototype that turns out to be the Mark Twain IIGS.In another version, C.T. claims to have seen it as a service question fromsomeone who purchased it for $50 at a flea market. He then loses track ofit until the discovery by the AppleQuerque people.And somewhere in the mix is Joe Kohn, who documented what was found in anissue of Shareware Solutions II.I'm looking for the best correct accurate story that i can come across toexplain where it was found, by whom, and who has it now. Also, are thereany color photographs of it anywhere? Preferable a couple that could beincluded in an update to the History in the IIgs chapter.Can anyone help here? Thanks in advance!Steven WeyhrichApple II Historianhttp://apple2history.org(SWEYHRICH, Cat 2, Top 15, Msg 16)>>>>>"""""Hi Steve,Jim Pittman indeed tells a true story. The Albuquerque Mark Twain didexist, and I wrote all about it in the premier issue of Juiced.GS, Vol. 1,Issue 1. My article was based on in-depth e-mail interviews with twoprominent Apple II personalities who saw it and spent some time assessingits make-up and capabilities.My two sources were Mike Westerfield (Byte Works) and Joe T. Walters(former A2 forum sysop on Compuserve). Joe even sent me a batch of colorphotos of the Twain, and some were used with the article. It is myrecollection that the Albuquerque machine was quite fragile and did notperform well. Eventually, I believe it went back to its original owner, whoMike and Joe would not identify.The Joe Kohn Twain is a totally different machine, obtained independentlyof the Albuquerque Twain. Last I heard, Joe was still using it as his mainIIGS.Tony Diaz undoubtedly has a wealth of info about the Twain that he couldshare with you. He's probably the single best source for such info, butI'll let him take it from there.Good luck on your research. If there is anything I can do to help yourcause -- such as send you a complimentary copy of the Juiced.GS issue withthe Twain story in it -- I'd be happy to do so.-- Max Jones-- Editor Emeritus and founder :-)-- Juiced.GS(JUICEDGS, Cat 2, Top 15, Msg 17)>>>>>"""""Not mentioned here yet is that Tony Diaz has a complete, functioning ROM 4prototype.

I started my Apple II experience back in 1979 whenmy best friend picked up a new, 32K, Apple ][ plus with the earning fromhis summer job.  I spent a lot of time over at his place exploring thecapabilities of his machine and was hooked.  I wasn't able to get my ownApple II until November 1981.  When I did I used that machine religiouslyuntil around 1985.  At that time I started a full time programming job andpart of what I supported was IBM PCs.In 1994 I started the road back to the Apple II.  While searching a localBBS for flight simulator software I fell upon an Apple IIe emulator,SimSystem IIe.  It rekindled my interest in the old machine and in July1995 I bought a brand new Platinum IIe from Sun Remarketing.  Also aroundthis time I found a text copy of your Apple II History which brought me upto date and further fuelled my interest.Since then I have picked up an additional 3 Apple IIe's, 2 Apple IIc's, anApple IIc plus, 2 Apple IIgs's, a Golden II (II+ clone), an Apple IIe cardfor the LC series Macintosh along with my original Apple ][ which I stillhave..  My online experience started with comp.emulators.apple2, tocomp.sys.apple2, to Delphi and to here when Sheppy opened the doors inDecember 2000.  I have the regular my Wednesday night RTC slot and attendedmy first KFest last year.Right now I have 4 of my Apple II's setup in my home, the others are instorage.  For me it is mostly a nostalgia thing.  The program I use mostoften is ProTerm A2 in conjunction with my Linux box/cable modem from whereI can use Lynx, Links, Pine, Tin, FTP, SSH and Telnet.  I make a point ofconducting my weekly RTC from a real Apple II.Over the last couple of months I've also started realizing a 20 yearambition to become an Apple II assembler programmer.  My apprenticeship hasstarted with a copy of Roger Wagner's "Assembly Lines: The Book" and ORCA/MMacro Assembler.  I have started my first programming project which Inaively expected to have completed by KFest but now expect to have readyfor Christmas.That's my story and I'm sticking to it. ;)If any of this manages to be useful to you please feel free to use ithowever you see fit.Mark Percival - Syndicomm.com Apple II RTC Host"Midweek Madness!" every Wednesday night.7:00 PM - 9:00 PM PDT(MARK, Cat 8, Top 1, Msg 7)>>>>>"""""Steve,I purchased my Apple IIgs computer at the Frankfurt Post Exchange in 1987while stationed in West Germany with the U.S. Army.

He said that the master disks still exist, but wouldobviously require some conversion into disk image format. He didn't feelthat there was much demand for something like that, considering the timeand effort that would be necessary to create that type of archive. (He alsomentioned that any of their IIgs's still in existence are boxed up and inquestionable operating condition).I also asked whether some of the best games could even be made availablefor sale on their Softdisk store, and the issue still is the time andeffort and what they perceive as little value.And of course, they will NOT plan on sending the master disks offsite tohave someone else do the work, even if they are volunteering.Now, if someone lives in Shreveport, LA, has a IIgs with a 5.25 drive, 3.5drive, and appropriately sized hard drive, and the time to convert multipleissues of SD and/or SDGS into uploadable disk images, and wants to go totheir offices to do the conversion, maybe he would be interested. :-)Steven WeyhrichApple II Historianhttp://apple2history.org(SWEYHRICH, Cat 15, Top 4, Msg 23)>>>>>"""""Strangely enough, last week I copied all 82 issues of SDGS to my hard driveas a form of backup.

You essentiallykeep power on the ADB ports.  The switchbox isn't just a simple disconnectpins from one port and move them to another.  There are additionalelectronics and you expect the price to start at a couple hundred dollars.Sun workstations are especially picky if you disconnect the keyboard.  Theybehave as if it received a reset signal.  But KVM switches exists for thesesystems and the reset behavior isn't present (as long as you get anexpensive enough switch) when switching the keyboard to differentworkstations.There are some systems (i.e. a Mac II) that can result in hardware failureif you pull a keyboard while it is powered on.  The IIgs doesn't have thisproblem (as most Macs also don't have this problem).  I have disconnectedADB devices frequently on my IIgs with no ill effect.

Modern ATX boardshave dual DE9 connectors (9-pin male) while older AT boards often used DE9and DB25.You can use either serial port, it's just a simple matter of tellingWindows that the ImageWriter is using either 'COMM1' or 'COMM2' (COMM1 isusually used by a serial mouse). If you're using an analog modem (dial-up)then your second serial port would be in use, though you can safely swapserial cables with the power on.Windows has a built-in driver for the ImageWriter. When you click on 'Addprinter' pick 'C-Itoh' and choose the 8510 model. It should set everythingup for you automatically, just tell it which serial port you're using. Ifyou want to do color, you'll need to download a newer version of the driverfrom C-Itoh's page.As far as the physical connection is concerned, all you need is:-A plain Apple IIgs/Mac modem cable (mini-DIN8 to DB25m)-A plain PC modem cable (DB9f to DB25m; or DB25f to DB25m)-A Null-Modem adapter (an adapter with DB25f on both ends)If you want to free a serial port, you could switch to a PS/2 mouse.I prefer it anyway as you can set the polling rate higher to have smoothermouse movements, like the IIgs and Mac have always had.Btw, it turns out the StyleWriter I is a QuickDraw based printer, so itwon't work on the PC with standard software drivers like the ImageWriter(or an 8-bit Apple II for that matter).

Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 24, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 27 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will bea non-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.
