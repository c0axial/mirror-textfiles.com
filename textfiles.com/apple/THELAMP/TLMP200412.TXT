Eachindividual light is duplicated by its reflection on the water.  This timeof year the traditional "official" community Christmas tree is added tothis scene.  Hundreds of bulbs of many colors light the forty footevergreen tree.     This winter scene brings to mind a tradition of some sixty years ago.With no electricity on the farm, there was no way of storing frozen foods.So we made Home Made Ice Cream in the Winter... when it was cold enough tofind plenty of ice outdoors.     This was truly a do it yourself project.  The milk came fresh from thecow.  Part of the milk was run through the hand cranked separator to getthe cream.  The fresh eggs came from the chicken coop.  The sugar, vanilla,salt, and chocolate were purchased from the general store by trading eggsor cream.     The ice cream mix was prepared with care... heated on the cook stovewhich was fired with corn cobs.     Ice was placed in a gunny sack and pulverized by repeated poundingwith the side of an ax.     The actual freezing of the ice cream was a job for my brother and I.The mix was placed in the freezer can and the cranking mechanism put inplace.  Alternate layers of ice and salt were packed around the can.  Thenthe steady cranking to keep it mixed during freezing.  Add more ice andsalt and crank.  Repeat until it became difficult to crank, indicating itwas frozen.     Ah... the best ice cream you will ever eat.                           A Change of Tradition                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     From time to time it becomes necessary to change a tradition.KansasFest will be held this year in a different location in Kansas City.See the KFest section of this issue to find out why it was necessary tochange from the traditional location.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[SUL]SEVERAL NEW UPLOADS TO THE A2 LIBRARY"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""We have three new uploads in thesystem_software/misc_16-bit/desk_accessories/nda directory:File: MailChec1b2.BXYSize: 14976Date: Nov 14This is a new public beta version of MailChecker.NDA, another New DeskAccessory from Ryan Suenaga.

(Decoding the text used to leavethe seed in a known sequence, which normally was not a problem as the nextkeyboard input randomized the seed again, however in the case of randomitem special goodies this is not true as the list of items are generatedbefore the next intervening keypress.)o Breaking a key while the auto-unlock function is active now worksproperly.Stuff Changed in v8.2:o The Tome Reader is now over 18 times faster!!!  The search speed is noweven faster than Dogpaw by a factor of 4!!! This has been accomplished bypartly coding the page display/search routines in assembly language.However, the main program still is almost entirely AppleSoft BASIC.o The tome viewer now has a fast input routine with full editingcapabilities.o All library tomes are now in AppleWorks format.o The CTRL-Z command has been removed.  Its function to restore the hiresscreen after using the GS control panel to fix a Second Sight card anomalyhas now been made automatic.o Assembly-language code optimized, saved over 150 bytes! The CODE, CODEQ,and VAP/CODET object files have now been incorporated into a single newobject file: SC.OBJ!  In addition, this file is only loaded once,speeding-up the time needed to reload the title page.o The Quick Plot function has been changed to Full Plot so the ON/OFFdisplay is shown in positive logic.o Since the automap function was added, the LOCATE spell has lost itsusefulness.  Now, when you invoke this spell, it gives you the teleportcoordinates needed to get to your current location from the stairs to themarket (or the spot the portals to the other scenarios take you).o Lowered the chance to lose skills when gaining levels (however,characters near their life expectancy may still expect to lose skills).  Inaddition, your level now has more weight in determining whether skills aregained-although age and vitality are still the main factors, the greateryour level the higher chance there is to gain skills (since higher levelsare more difficult to attain, the awards should be greater).o The maze information window is no longer annoying redrawn after goingthru a locked door when the auto-unlock function is active.New Stuff in v8.2:o The Tome Reader now has an option to view the tomes as one continuousdocument to allow you to browse/search all the tomes at once.  When viewingall tomes, you can quickly jump to the previous/next tome by pressing theopen-apple key and the up/down arrow.  You can also view the tomesseparately as beforeo The Tome Reader now displays the current tome number being viewed.o To more easily ascertain which group of 8 items are being displayed, thesecond page of items have their index numbers shown in inversed type.(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 140)>>>>>"""""For those of you updating from v7.0 to v8.2, don't use the Extra Menu ViewAutomaps option until after you run the update and exit to the title page,otherwise you'll get a crash until you do so.This is very minor and only affects v7.0.  Why?  Since I reassembled allthe ML code into one file in v8.2, the automap entry point was moved to alocation not valid for v7.0.  Because the ML code has grown a couple timessince the original version, LOMEM gets reset after the update; until theupdate all ML code that will be run prior to the update must be below theoriginal LOMEM.Since the automap didn't exist before v7.0, no problem.  And v7.1 had aLOMEM increase above the relocated automap routine so versions after wouldnot cause an error either.(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 141)[EOA][KSU]Kelvin Sherlock.UPDATES WEB SITE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sheppy isn't the only one who can redesign his website (or set one up forthat matter).http://www.syndicomm.com/~kws/iigs/I've stolen some IIgs icons and cornflower blue for that old time feeling.I'm also in the process of sorting the random stuff on my hard drive, sothere's some goodies there (like a new version of the QServer NDA, whichshould be in the ftp library soon) and source code (download or browse itonline).Kelvin(KWS, Cat 20, Top 11, Msg 14)>>>>>"""""I'm curious -- how do you use the quote server? :)Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 20, Top 11, Msg 16)>>>>>"""""On the IIgs side, open up the NDA and click the start button.On your other computer, telnet to your IIgs, port #17.I've never seen another quote-of-the-day server (not that I've looked), soI don't know why you'd want to use it.

I plan to make the garage available again thisyear.In addition to that, I will be giving away 6 - 8 Apple //c Plus computersthat are in above average condition - these are from my personalcollection.  I mention it because several people have asked me for //c+machines in the past. The KFest committee will determine how they'll begiven away - I have suggested a drawing in which only people who want oneare in the drawing.There will be other goodies in the garage - misc floppy drives, Siders,cards, and probably some useless stuff too but we'll see.
