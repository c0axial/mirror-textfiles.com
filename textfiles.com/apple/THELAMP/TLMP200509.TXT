Bellevue State Park in Eastern Iowa provides anobservation point High Above The Mississippi River.  Lock and Dam number 12is located on the river below.  Here you can watch the slow movement of thebarge traffic up and down the river... and the movement of the bargesthrough the lock.     The upper Mississippi has a series of dams with locks designed toprovide a minimum depth of six feet to facilitate the movement of bargetraffic.     Each tugboat is pushing a collection of barges lashed together...three barges wide and five or six barges long.  The barges are sized sothat a group of three wide by three long will fit into the locks.  To passthrough the locks each collection of tugboat/barges must be broken into twosections... each section moving through the lock separately... the sectionsare lashed together again to continue their journey.  (A cable-winch systemis provided to move the section of barges without the tugboat attached.)     The tugboat/barge collections are dynamic... leaving a barge here...picking up a barge there.  A comparison to the internet is in order here...where data travels in packets.     When you consider the length of the Mississippi, add in all of therivers that connect to it that are capable of barge traffic, and themovement of cargo to/from ocean going vessels in the port of New Orleans,you have quite a transportation system for large and bulky cargo.     So the destruction of the recent hurricane, Katrina, is felt far andwide due to its disruption of transportation.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[RBP]RETROBITS PODCAST"""""""""""""""""Has anyone besides me been listening to the Retrobits Podcast?http://www.retrobits.com/Definitely worth a listen imho.RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 576)>>>>>"""""I haven't, but mostly because it's too much like talk radio, which boresme. :)Eric "Sheppy" Shepherd                                sheppy@syndicomm.comOwner, Syndicomm                                  http://www.syndicomm.com                     Building communities, bit by bit.(SYNDICOMM, Cat 2, Top 8, Msg 577)>>>>>"""""I've never listened to talk radio before, but I'm using my new iPod tolisten to video game talk show podcasts in the car.

This is now fixed.  Thanks to Jon Rose for reporting.o The Camp list S)pells command now works under all circumstances, even ifyou currently can't cast spells.o The Proving Grounds was supposed to limit hit points bonuses to a maximumof 10hp per level, with a cap of 100hp.  However, due to a bug, if you have101hp or more, the cap is ignored.  I hereby proclaim this a feature!o Fixed combat weapon equip bug that sometimes would forget to re-equipyour original weapon after combat.Stuff Changed in v8.4:o The possibility of very low-level parties encountering large "organized"wandering monster groups has been removed.o Initiative formula changed.  Agility is now the major determining factor,adjusted slightly by class, level, marching order, and a bit of luck.o Most potions have been reduced in price, due to the fact they are now inunlimited supply.o Level 2 monsters are no longer allowed on the first level.o Enhanced feature:  Instant Automap!  As long as you don't leave thecurrent level or explore new territory, the automap is now instantlydisplayed.o Enhanced feature: Interactive Auto-Notes!  Instead of displaying speciallocations as drab coordinates on the text screen, special locations are nowshown interactively on the automap display.o Ladders are now shown in the automap display.o Enhanced ID spell.  Now the ID spell will also show the monster's baseinitiative rating.o The message time delay can now be adjusted up to 65500 for emulator userswho want to run Silvern Castle at faster speeds, but still be able to readmessages.o When the preference to restrict loot to gold pieces is on, only goldpieces will be shown.  Requested by Bruce Baker.o If a monster gulps one of your characters, and if that monster is killedyour character will emerge at the end of the round instead of when the lastof that group is killed.  Requested by Bruce Baker.  But if the monsterflees with your character, all items and gold carried plus your characterare lost forever!o Rewrote the title page text scroller to be viewable on most emulators.New Stuff in v8.4:o New preference: Encounter Frequency.  This preference allows you toadjust the frequency of wandering monster encounters.o New preference setting: Disable shareware checks.  Ever since SCv5.2 whenSilvern Castle became freeware, the flag that used to check whether you hadregistered was disabled, although the actual unregistered shareware codewas never removed.  Now you can toggle this flag on and off.o New display preferences!  Now you can set your preferred display modes(hires or text) for all modules (maze, camp, market, combat, guild).  Inaddition, you can choose to keep the standard Silvern text mode colorscheme (white & black), or use your GS control panel display settings.o New preference: Mundane loot frequency.  Now you can adjust the frequencyof mundane loot, or set it to automatically skip all mundane loot-greattimesaver for high-level parties!o New maze info command: @ This command brings up misc info, whichcurrently includes the party rating and the encounter chance.o NPC lairs!  Now you may encounter very powerful gatherings of specificclasses of NPCs!o New preference: Substitute initiative for race.  This toggles whether thebottom character status window shows the character race as normal, or showsthe character base initiative instead.o The character base initiative rating is now shown at the Camp inspectcharacter display, unless the sub initiative preference is already set toshow initiative at the character status window.o New preference!  Auto-save automap images.  By default, Silvern Castlewill now auto-save all automaps viewed, which speeds up the new instantautomap feature even more.o New Extra's Menu option: Erase & Zero Automaps.  This option allows youto selectively erase your automaps per scenario.o New preference: Lair Frequency.  This preference allows you to adjust thefrequency of lairs appearing in rooms. Requested by Bruce Baker.(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 168)[EOA][IDI]INSTALLATION OF Silvern Castle HD DISK IMAGE""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I just realized that the install directions for the hard drive disk imagefor emulator uses can't be viewed by people who don't already have a way toview text files.The upcoming v8.4 release will contain a stand alone text viewer; I havealso included them below:Silvern Castle for Emulators UsersThis bootable 1.5MB hard drive disk image contains a shrinkit file of thelatest Silvern Castle release.The cookbook instructions below are more geared for PC's running theAppleWin emulator (v1.12.6.0 or later required), but users of KEGS andother emulators should be able to follow along.  Personally, I prefer KEGSover AppleWin.Please see the appropriate section depending if you are upgrading apreviously installed copy of Silvern Castle, or if this is a newinstallation.I. NEW INSTALLATIONAll you need to do to install Silvern Castle is to extract the entirecontents of the shrinkit file into a folder on any hard drive image.  Irecommend naming the folder SILVERN.CASTLE, but this is not necessaryunless you are following the cookbook method below to create an auto-bootSilvern disk.  Run the SILVERN.SYSTEM file to start.Here's the cookbook method to install on the included hard drive image:1. Mount this hard drive image as drive 1 in slot 7 of your emulator soit's the boot hard drive.2. Boot this hard drive image in your emulator.3. At the standard AppleSoft prompt, type BYE<return> to get to the ProDOSquit selector and choose the SHRINKIT program and press <return>.4. Choose the open archive option and select the shrinkit file (the onewith the SHK suffix) and press <return>.5. Press open-apple-A (left ALT+A for most PC emulators) to select all thefiles and press <return>.6. Highlight the SILVERN.CASTLE folder and press <return>, then press<return> at the select current prompt to unpack the files into this folder.7. After all the files have been unpacked, exit the Shrinkit program.8. At the ProDOS quit menu, select BASIC.SYSTEM and press <return>.9. If you want Silvern Castle to auto-boot, type the following:    RENAMEBASIC.SYSTEM,BASIC.SYS<return>.  Then reboot your emulator to start SilvernCastle.10. To start Silvern Castle manually, type -SILVERN.SYSTEM<return> (don'tforgot the dash) from the AppleSoft prompt, or select it from the ProDOSquit menu, or from your program launcher.11. After starting Silvern Castle, you will need to run the UpdateDatafiles option in the Extra's Menu.12. After updating, I recommend you change the following defaultpreferences in the Extra's Menu:a. Set the Preload Files to /RAM option to [N].  This option is redundantfor hard drive users.b. If you are using AppleWin, set the Message Time Delay to [20000].  Usersof KEGS should set this to [01000].13. See the Library Tome in the Extra's Menu for the full user's guide.14. The shrinkit file may now be deleted if you wish.II. UPDATING AN OLDER VERSION OF SILVERN CASTLESimply extract the entire contents of the new shrinkit file into the samefolder where your old Silvern Castle folder is located, overwriting allduplicates.  Start Silvern Castle as normally.  You may need to run theUpdate Datafile option in the Extra's Menu.It's probably a good idea to make a backup of your existing Silvern Castlefolder in case of any problems before you begin the update process.Here's the cookbook method to extract the new shrinkit file to your oldSilvern Castle folder:1. Make sure the hard drive image that contains your old copy of SilvernCastle is the boot hard drive.  You will be updating this old copy ofSilvern Castle.2. Mount this newer hard drive image as drive 2 in slot 7 of your emulator.You will be extracting the new shrinkit file to your old copy of SilvernCastle.3. Boot your old copy of Silvern Castle.4. If Silvern Castle is setup to auto-boot, press <esc> at Silvern's titlepage to exit, and then from the ProDOS quit menu choose BASIC.SYS<return>.5. Type BYE<return> to return to the ProDOS quit menu.6. Select SHRINKIT<return>.7. Choose the open archive option, press <tab> to change to the new harddrive mounted in drive 2, then select the new shrinkit file and press<return>.8. Press open-apple-A (left ALT+A for most PC emulators) to select all thefiles and press <return>.9. Highlight the SILVERN.CASTLE folder on your old hard drive mounted indrive 1 and press <return>, then at the select current prompt press<return> to unpack the files into this folder.  Overwrite all duplicates.10. After all the files have been unpacked, exit the Shrinkit program.11. You can now unmount and remove the hard drive image in drive 2, andboot the updated hard drive image in drive 1.12. You may need to run the Update Datafiles option in the Extra's Menu.13. See the Read.Me.First file in the Tome Library located in the Extra'sMenu to review what's new.(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 169)>>>>>""""">> I just realized that the install directions for the hard drive diskimage for emulator uses can't be viewed by people who don't already have away to view text files. <<There are a number of free text readers available.

Finding stuff over +2 is very uncommon, but stuff upto +6 is still possible.  Usually all weapons and armour items found insidea treasure chest on the deeper levels will be enchanted.Looking at my item table, on level 9 for example, the chance that typicalitems will be enchanted are fairly good:                        Chance to find in treasure chests--------------------------------------------------------------------------Item                    +0      +1      +2      +3      +4      +5      +6--------------------------------------------------------------------------Long sword              0%      24%     46%     27%     4%      <1%     0%Short sword             0%      14%     40%     35%     11%     1%      <1%Broad sword             0%      46%     43%     10%     1%      0%      0%Bastard sword           95%     4%      1%      0%      0%      0%      0%Cloak                   0%      13%     40%     37%     10%     0%      0%Chain mail              17%     46%     38%     0%      0%      0%      0%Scroll/Fireball         58%     30%     9%      2%      <1%     0%      0%I think the first few releases of Silvern Castle were really excessive withenchanted items.  Stuff up to +10 were fairly common, and even up to +32 orhigher were technically possible.You can always pay Quillon at the Trading Post to enchant items if you canafford it.Mostly to avoid the drought of spell scrolls in the early games, mostchests now contain a high percentage of such items, and usually the samelevel spell scroll can be found around the same level of the maze (i.e.troll on level 5 to find the level 5 lightning-bolt spell scroll).However, many of those advanced-class level 7 spells are only found onlevel 10.-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 174)>>>>>"""""Sounds good.I've been trolling on level 10 and found a couple of striking +1 andfinally a death ray.I thought you said that level 10 is rearranged a little.

But some of you finished without ever seeing it-and complained-sonow it's required and part of the scenario.In addition, the area with Drachma's Lab cannot be reached directly fromlevel 10 anymore.Confused?  Look for the locked door needing the silver key on level10-there's only one.
