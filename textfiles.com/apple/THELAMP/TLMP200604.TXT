It is easy to overlookthe fact that there are people who do not have access to electricservice... to overlook the fact that there are people who have had longinterruptions of electric service due to storms or war.     Electricity came to the farm when I was seven years old.  A localCO-OP was formed for distribution of power to the farms in the area.  Moneyfor the project was raised with a low interest rate loan from the REA...the Rural Electrification Association.     As the lines were being built the local electricians were busy wiringhomes and other farm buildings.  And installing a Yard Light... withtwo-way switches... so you could turn it on or off from either the house orthe barn... no more walking to and from the barn by lantern light to do theevening chores.     It was a fascinating time for a seven year old... watching the powerlines being built... watching the electrician at work... having a pocketfull of "money" (the knock outs from the switch and junction boxes beinginstalled by the electrician).     But the most exciting part was the day they turned the power on... mybrother and I ran from room to room turning the lights on and off.     The coming of electricity also left me with some vivid memories.  Thecompletely dark countryside allowed the family to spend time togetherobserving the multitude of stars... locating the constellations and theNorth Star.  Star gazing was never quite as nice after the coming ofelectricity... with all the stray light in the countryside.     Then there was the magic of Christmas Eve.  We would light themultitude of candles carefully placed on the Christmas Tree and extinguishthe lamps.  We would sit silently for fifteen minutes watching the tree bycandle light.  We then relit the kerosene lamps and carefully extinguishedeach candle.  The risk of setting the house on fire was too great to leavethe candles lit any longer.  The coming of electricity brought electriclights to the Christmas Tree... but it just wasn't the same as with realcandles.     So when you are enjoying your Apple II's... give some thought to thepeople who do not have electricity, much less a computer.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[HAH]Hear Some of Apple's History""""""""""""""""""""""""""""If you're interested in hearing some of Apple's history (including a lot onthe Apple II), take a listen to this week's version of TWiT (This Week inTech), number 48, which reunites a bunch of Apple's early employees to talkabout the company's history for its 30th birthday.http://www.twit.tv/RyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 2, Top 15, Msg 38)[EOA][ACT]Apple Computer's 30th"""""""""""""""""""""Thirty years of Apple Computer, Inc., by CNet.com:http://tinyurl.com/s3tdbRyanChief Sysop and Head Geek(A2.RYAN, Cat 4, Top 3, Msg 22)>>>>>"""""CNN.com's take:http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/03/27/apple.turns30.ap/index.html(KGAGNE, Cat 4, Top 3, Msg 23)>>>>>"""""Ed Lundberg recently forwarded this info:Here are two online quizzes about Apple, which celebrates its 30th birthdaytoday:* How Much Do You Know About Apple?

I compared the ARP request to otherones (from a different computer on the network) and the only difference Icould see was that the kegs' target mac address (in the arp request, notthe header) was ff:ff:ff:ff:ff;ff whereas the other one was00:00:00:00:00:00.Is it normal for that many arp requests to be sent?  How should the kegs ipaddress be set?  To the host computer's, or to an unused one?  I've triedit both ways with no difference, (although windows gives a warning if youreuse the host's ip address). The Mac address, is of course, unique to thenetwork.Kelvin.(KWS, Cat 29, Top 41, Msg 53)>>>>>"""""After fooling around with winpcap, it occurred to me that my 'net access isvia wireless ... I suspect the router filters out most traffic (includingthe response to my arp request) before broadcasting it over the air.Using the same mac address as the host computer (but a different ipaddress), I did receive an ARP response (this was with winpcap, not kegs,but the same restrictions would apply either way).  Reusing the MAC addressis probably a really bad idea.Kelvin.(KWS, Cat 29, Top 41, Msg 55)>>>>>"""""Based on the information found athttp://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~mick/academic/networks/msc/network/arp.shtml(too lazy to google the actual RFC), the ARP Broadcast isFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  I don't know what it means for a "broadcast" of00:00:00:00:00:00.You want the MAC for your emulated ethernet (the same concept as a tunnel)to be different from the host's system.  The MAC address distinguisheswhich ethernet device (real or whatnot) should handle the packet.The host computer's ethernet adaptor must be in "promiscuous" mode toaccept an ethernet packet with any MAC address.  Normally, the ethernetadaptor ignores packets with a different MAC address.  I found libpcapautomatically enabling promiscuous mode (assuming the host computer'sethernet driver didn't have a bug to prevent it from working which was acase that I had to troubleshoot and fix at one time).Geoff(GEOFF, Cat 29, Top 41, Msg 56)[EOA][AGS]ActiveGS on Your Web Site"""""""""""""""""""""""""If you are running ActiveGS on your Web site, you may need to modify yourHTML before April 11 to maintain existing user interface compatibility (thechange will occur in IE as long as you patch your system regularly).
