After all, SC is mostly BASIC, so you can list andchange variables easily, and even without REMmarks you probably candecipher enough info to write your own character editor.In fact, Silvern's automap and saved game routines were taken from ideasgleaned from listing other programs.  Somewhere on the Time in a Bottle CDthere's a program called Rat's Maze that gave me the core for an automaproutine.  Since I'm using MicroDot, I can't use Basic.System'sSTORE/RESTORE to saved games anymore, so I got a binary technique used inDOS 3.3 days, in this case, from listing a few Eamon's that have a savedgame feature.I'd be happy to answer questions about BASIC routines used by SC if anyoneis interested.-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 90)>>>>>"""""Sorry Mark, but I just converted the automap routine to machine language!It now runs almost 3 times faster; on my 8Mhz GS it now takes only 5seconds to plot a complete level, where it took 14 seconds previously.I used MacroSoft to do this.  This is a bunch of BASIC command-like macrosthat when used with Nibble's MindCraft assembler, produces machine languagecode.  Its much easier than doing by hand, since the macros look almostlike AppleSoft anyway.  Example of code:BEGIN $3000      ;ORGVAR L,S          ;define INT varsFVAR SF          ;define FP varsGETVAR L,A%      ;get A% from AppleSoft and transfer to LGETVAR SF,LM     ;get LM from AppleSoft and transfer to SFTOINT S,SF       ;convert SF (FP) to S (INT)IF L=0, LET S=1  ;if L=0 then set S=1PUTVAR S,A%      ;transfer S back to AppleSoft A%END              ;RTS to AppleSoftFrom AppleSoft100 S=4: LM=0: CALL 12288: PRINT S: REM prints 1There is still some BASIC parts in the automap routine because, get this, Idon't know how to call my own machine language programs from assembly!  Iuse AppleSoft routines mostly to find variable pointers and values (i.e.CALL 768,A% or & 15,A%(0),T).  I think what I need to do is search thevariable table directly to find simple variables and arrays (I know how todo this in theory, but actual practice make take much trail & error).One limitation MacroSoft has is not being able to handle more than singledimensioned arrays.  If it could I think coding the rest of the automapdisplay would be done already, I think I could get the speed down to 2seconds or less eventually.BTW, this stuff from Nibble is pretty old (copyright 1982, but converted toProDOS in 1991).  I got it right before Nibble went under and never didanything with it until last week.  Now I wish I had used it earlier.Anyone else familiar with MacroSoft?  The biggest problem with it is thearchaic line editor that MindCraft's Assembler uses, plus the need to putor not spaces exactly as needed, and virtually no error checking (exceptfor assembly errors).  I almost throw this package out the window a fewtimes because it will assemble merrily without indication anything iswrong, so much trail & error is needed.  For example HPLOT only plots twocoord pairs, so HPLOT 0,0,50,100,0,0 will not work, but the manual doesn'tmention this little pitfall.-Jeff(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 97)>>>>>"""""Well, I now have converted the remaining core automap routines into ML withMacroSoft.  So now the automap display runs almost 5 times as fast!  Mytime to plot a complete level is now 3 seconds flat.There still is a bit of optimizing I can still do, so I might be able tosave an additional second or two.I figured out a way to call my own ML routines from assembly.  This issomewhat difficult because my ML routines are meant to be called byAppleSoft; such as:& 15,A%(0),T: REM is square "T" in automap?  Returns PEEK(249)=1 if trueMy routine in ML does this:  Jumps to routine #15, gets address ofbeginning of A%(0) automap array (each square is 1 bit position) usingAppleSoft routines, finds square "T" in array then returns result in memorylocation 249.To get this to work with MacroSoft without rewriting or duplicating theexisting routine, I would do this:5339 CALL 12288: GOTO 5440: & 15,A%(0),TWhich calls the automap plot routine assembled with MacroSoft, when done itskips the rest of line.  In MacroSoft, I use AppleSoft's parse routine tofind the ampersand following the GOTO, then simply jump to my ML routines.Since AppleSoft's TXTPTR will be pointing to the "1" following theampersand, my existing ML routines work from assembly.  I then reset theTXTPTR back to were it was.  Pretty neat trick.  Probably slower thandirect assembly but saves me the trouble of using the existing routinewithout creating a new routine.(FINKSTERJ, Cat 14, Top 7, Msg 89)>>>>>"""""After optimizing further, the time is now 2.72 seconds.

My only real experience with filetransfers came from using Zmodem on a Unix Machine at college and someZmodem and Xmodem stuff transferring files from Hyper Terminal on a PC tomy IIgs.  I have seen Y-Modem but have no clue what this is?What makes one better than the other anyway?Dain Neater(A2.DAIN, Cat 57, Top 49, Msg 1)>>>>>"""""X-Modem was the first of the error-free protocol file transfer methods. It,and all the others, use a packet of data with a check-sum. if the check-sumdoes not match, then the receiving end ask for the packet again. This way,you get an error-free transfer regardless of the integrity of theconnection.X-Modem does not carry the filename, and in general uses small packets,although there is a 4K X-modem option that some hosts support. As eachpacket has to be acknowledged, the turn round for a packet can be slow ifthe distance between the host and the receiving computer is great.Y-modem carries the filename, and can have larger packets and an improvedcheck-sum. Also Y-modem can 'batch' a number of files per session. It istherefore more robust.Z-modem also carries the filename, has an improved check-sum, and variablelength packets. However the main speed boost with Zmodem is that it uses asend-ahead method, whereby the next packet is sent out regardless ofwhether the previous one has been acknowledged. This speeds things updramatically on long distance connections. Also Z-modem can resume atransfer in the middle, if you had to abort a download for any reason.Finally there is Kermit. Kermit was designed to work on almost any link youmight come across. It can handle both 7 and 8 bit connections, and can haveoptionally very large packets and a windowed mode. When you start atransfer, it negotiates with the other end to see what features aresupported. The best method is chosen to suit both ends. It supports largepackets, has improved check-sums, send-ahead, and a windowed mode where badpackets can be re-requested from the middle of a window. Zmodem always goesback to the last good packet to resume a download.Kermit IMHO is very much underrated, as if both ends support all thefeatures, it is actually faster than Zmodem. However it is rare to find ahost that supports all the features, so usually you end up with a slowsmall packet transfer often with only a 7 bit transfer rate. Spectrumsupports most Kermit features, so against a full featured host, it canoutrun Z-modem!As TCP/IP is an error-free connection in itself, you do not need to havepackets and check-sums, as data can flow freely. FTP file transfer simplydumps the data as fast as it can across the link, but is only available ifyou use an Internet connection through Marinetti. Ewen Wannop - Speccie - Sun 3 Mar 2002 - 142 days till KFest '02 Delivered without using a IIgs by Spectrum v2.5.2 & SOAR 1.0b5 Setup: Bernie ][ the Rescue 3.0 and a dual G4/800Mhz GeForce3 http://www.ewannop.btinternet.co.uk/(CONDUCTOR, Cat 57, Top 49, Msg 2)>>>>>"""""Dain,In addition to Ewen's excellent descriptions, check out the printed manualfor ProTERM A2, if you have it.

I recently acquired 2 apple platinum 5.25 drivesand put them on my GS. For some reason only 5.25A shows up in GS/OS. 5.25Bis nowhere to be found. However, in P8, they both work great. All my P8disk utilities, and even older 2-disk games on my ][plus work fine in bothdrives.I thought maybe I had too many devices listed in the finder, so I disabledmost of my HD partitions with the RamFAST utility, but still no luck.My floppy drive chain is plugged in like this:GS -> 3.5 d1 -> 3.5 d2 -> 5.25 d1 -> 5.25 d2I also have a Zip accelerator, RamFAST RevD, and LanceGS, 5 meg RAM (4 megcard on Rom 3) and running System 6.0.1 with all the patches that I knowof.Thanks,Matt(MPORTUNE, 3571.1, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>"""""It took a bit of remembering, but I know the reason and a solution...Before System 6, the OS would attempt to detect how many 5.25 drives wereattached to the diskport (or card based controller) and display an icon foreach appropriate drive found. The problem was some third party drives,including Apple-made drives, weren't always being detected properly.So, when System 6.0 was introduced, GS/OS would just automatically place_two_ 5.25 drive icons on the desktop (for each controller found)regardless of how many drives were connected. Lots of people with only asingle 5.25 drive found this annoying and patched the device driver so itwould only show *1* drive icon on the desktop. I'm pretty sure this is whatyou must have done 10 years ago and forgot (in fact I had to think aboutthis a bit before my memory kicked in since my system is set up this way).:)The solution is to revert the 'Appledisk5.25' driver found in/System/Drivers back to how it came. Simply change the auxiliary filetypeback to "$010E"--it's probably set to $0101 or $0103 if you're seeing onlyone drive icon now. Or you could just copy over the driver with one from aclean copy of the System 6.0.1 disks, that would obviously work too.Reboot and you should see two 5.25 drives on your desktop.ps - ProTERM 3.1 is handy for quickly changing filetype/auxiliary types,just go to the 'Set File Info' option in the File menu.Mitchell Spectora_specto@alcor.concordia.ca(SPECTOR1, 3571.5, Delphi A2 web side)>>>>>"""""Mitch, as usual you're a genius!
