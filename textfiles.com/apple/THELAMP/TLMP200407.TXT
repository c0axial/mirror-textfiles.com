To callattention to their stores, the business owners have organized a weeklyFarmers Market in the parking lot.     Each saturday morning in the Spring, Summer, and Fall, venders areinvited to bring their wares and set up shop.  In season you can find freshfruits and vegetables, fresh herbs, home baked items, home made jelly, homemade crafts, cut flowers, flowering perennials, etc.     The Law of Supply and Demand is dynamic here, with prices beingadjusted on the go... influenced by how many venders are selling the samething and how fast an item is being sold.     Part of the experience is visiting with the venders.  You can verifythat corn on the cob was really harvested just before they came to themarket.  You can pull back the husk on an ear and see if the corn is asmature as you like.     Many people like corn on the cob.  However, you don't know what youare missing until you have had corn on the cob the same day as it washarvested.  The Farmers Market makes this possible.                           The KFest Experience                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Getting acquainted with and exchanging ideas with other Apple IIpeople on line is a great experience.  However, you don't know what you aremissing until you have had the KFest experience.  Kind of like eatingfreshly harvested corn on the cob.     There is still time to register for KFest 2004.  Refer to the KFestsection of this issue for more information.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAS]----------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 FORUM at Syndicomm.com  |                                  (A2Central.com) |---------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson <lyle@foxvalley.net>[NBI]NEW BACKGROUND FOR IIgs IN A2 LIBRARY"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""There is a new file in thesystem_software/misc_16-bit/inits_and_finder_extras/Appearance/Desktop.Dressing directory:File: appledesktop.bxySize: 3456Date: Jun 15This is a background init for the Apple IIGS.

From European programmersto American first-time Apple II owners, we gather each year in Kansas City,Missouri, to celebrate the Apple II.  It's a five-day event witheducational sessions covering a wide array of topics from using popularApple II software to writing  new software yourself.  No matter what yourskill level or interest, there's something at KansasFest for you!After the sessions are over for the day, there are other events, fromtrivia contests to viewings of classic geek movies like WarGames to justhanging out and swapping stories.  KansasFest is renowned for its latenights and early mornings -- join a caravan at 2:00 in the morning to graba late-night meal, and then get up at 8 AM for breakfast and the firstsession of the day.KansasFest is the traditional place for new Apple II product announcementsand demonstrations, and the Saturday vendor fair is always popular -- getthe latest Apple II stuff (and usually some great used gear) at the bestprices.  The vendor fair is open to everyone, even if they didn't attendthe rest of KansasFest.KansasFest costs only $295 until July 15th, including all five days of theconference and room and board. $359 for a single room. Get all your meals,all your fun, and a place to sleep, all for one low price.  So join us andfind out what the Apple II family is all about!http://www.kfest.org(Sean Fahey, comp.sys.apple2)[EOA][DMM]KFest PRESENTATION - DIGITIZE MUSIC ON YOUR Mac"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hi all.I'd like some advice as to a talk or two I wanted to do (planned beforethis keynote speaker thing came up :-) ).What I wanted to present was a talk about digital music, from the Apple II"beep" up through iTunes (a historical overview, so to speak). Now, THATpresentation is moving along nicely, only needs some artwork to pretty itup in Keynote.The other talk was going to be more of a "how to", in regards to how todigitize music that is not in a CD format (i.e., LP's, cassettes, 8-tracks,cylinder records, etc) using available tools. This would also get intoorganizing a music collection on your computer, use of Smart Playlists,etc.Is there enough interest from those planning to attend to bother creatingthe second talk? If those who want to digitize music have already done it,or don't have a Mac, there is probably not much point.Steven Weyhrich <IX0YE>--<Apple II Historyhttp://apple2history.org(A2HISTORY, Cat 5, Top 22, Msg 18)>>>>>"""""Steve,I've often seen inquiries, either on this service's Mac RT or elsewhere,regarding how to get audio from older media into something more modern andaccessible.

The rules are the same as always, but follow:KansasFest 2004HackFest Rules1. Contest begins at 7:00 AM on Wednesday, July 21, and ends at 7:00 AM onSaturday, July 24 so that judging can begin.  The winners will be announcedduring the Saturday morning sessions.  Entries submitted late won't beconsidered.  Entries may be done by individuals or teams; however,individual achievement counts.2. Three judges will be selected by the KFest committee to judge thecompetition; at least one of them will be available at all times, toprovide assistance and judgement calls.  At least one judge will be anon-programmer.3. Entries must be written entirely during the allotted time; no sourcecode -- printed or on any form of computer-readable media -- may be used(although sample source code printed inside standard and acceptablereference materials is allowed), and the program must run on an Apple IImodel present at KFest.4. Any version of any development environment and programming language maybe used; however, there may not be any libraries, header files, or macrosets used that aren't standard-issue for that version of the developmentenvironment or programming language.5. Programs can't require unusual additional software or hardware; it's upto the judges to decide what constitutes "unusual."  The participant shouldask in advance.6. Programs can't take unfair advantage of system addons written in advancefor the sole purpose of easing the work to be done during the contestperiod.  Any extensions or other system addons used by an entry must havebeen released to the general public at least three months prior to thecontest date.7. Entries will be judged on completeness, cleverness, and the somewhatvague "cool" factor.  Entries don't have to be useful if they're otherwiseimpressive, and they don't have to be "finished."8. All entry programs are the property of the creator, and do not have tobe released to the general public at any time; however, we hope thatentries will be distributed by some means (whether for free or otherwise)when ready.  However, entries may be described or discussed, includingscreen shots (where applicable), by the KFest committee for promotionalpurposes, or by legitimate Apple II community press.The following lists are not necessarily complete lists of everythingallowed; these are to be taken as "givens."  If it's not on the list,please ask for confirmation.Acceptable software:     System software     Development environment (no customizations)     GSBug     Nifty List     Marinetti     Exerciser     ORCA/Debugger, Splat!     DesignMaster, Foundation, Genesys, ResLin     Talking Tools     Spectrum, ProTERM, ANSITermAcceptable hardware:     Apple II computer, monitor, disk drives, hard drives     CD-ROM drive, tape drive     Hard disk controller card     Sound card (speakers/headphones/etc)     Accelerator card (any speed)     RAM cardAccepted reference material:     All official Apple reference materials (including     manuals, technical notes, and file type notes).     Reference manuals included with development tools     and software.     Commercially-available reference manuals.Any other hardware, software, or reference material needs the approvalof the judges in advance.  When in doubt, ask the judges.(Eric Shepherd, Owner, Syndicomm: http://www.syndicomm.com)(Via KFest Mailing List)[EOA][INN]------------------------------                    EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
