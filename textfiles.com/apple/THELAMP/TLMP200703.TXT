The wheat, corn, andsoybeans delivered by the farmers for sale are "elevated" to the top of thestructure, then diverted to one of the bins for storage.  This allowsmoving grain into railroad cars via gravity.     Over the years farm machinery has become larger and larger.  This inturn allows each farmer to farm more and more acreage.  In an area wherethe economy is driven by agriculture, the result is a shrinking population.     In this community there has been only one ISP available via a localcall.  So the arrival of some competition, in the form of a wireless ISP,was quite welcome.     Where to place the antennas used by the wireless ISP was a"no-brainer"... mount them on the top of the grain elevator.[EOA]ASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][DAA]-------------------------------------------------------DISTILLATIONS FROM The A2 Bulletin Board at A2Central.com  |------------------------------------------------------------by Lyle Syverson  email: lutefisk at grex.cyberspace dot org[ABB]Access to A2C BB""""""""""""""""Which computer and software do you use to access the A2Central BB?I am using a Mac Beige G3, OS 9.1 and the WaMCom version of Mozilla 1.3.1.(Available at http://wamcom.org/)Lyle Syverson, Editor, _The Lamp!_published monthly at: ftp://www.a2central.com/the.lamp!email:  lutefisk at grex.cyberspace dot org(Lyle, a2c.general_chat, Feb 24 2007)>>>>>"""""The computer is an old IBM PC 350 (Pentium 200 model).

I never liked the newer versions of Free Agentmuch and now that they gotten over v4.0 they don't even make a Free Agentanymore, only the commercial Agent.  Because of this, once I installWindows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional on this machine I'mgoing to give a program called "40tude Dialog" a try for both my e-mail andnews reading.  I'm thinking I'll finally give up on Pegasus mail afterhaving used it for many years.However, that said, I'd rather be reading this stuff on my IIgs.  My realIIgs is not connected to the internet at present so the only way I can doit is running in KEGS and using its SvN support.

I want the control to be notified whenthe mouse is hovering over it.  Most modern GUIs will notify the controlwhen the mouse enters/exits/moves within a control.  As far as I can tell,the Control Manager will only notify the control when there is an actualmouse click.Can anybody tell me otherwise?  I'm thinking the only reasonable way tohandle it is to manually check the mouse after callingGetNextEvent/TaskMaster.Kelvin.(kws, ac2.a2pro_developers, Feb 28 2007)>>>>>"""""There is no easy way as far as I know. You would need to do some manualtracking of the control from within a TaskMaster or ModalDialog loop,checking to see what was under the cursor at regular intervals.You could build in a timing sequence using the TickCount, so for instance,if the mouse hovered for more than a few seconds at the same point, youresponded in some way.So it possible, but a bit of a kludge!Ewen(Speccie, ac2.a2pro_developers, Mar 01 2007)>>>>>"""""Yeah, unfortunately, you're going to have to add a check in your event loopto see if the mouse is inside a control by calling FindControl(), then takewhatever action is necessary based on that.Sheppy(Sheppy, ac2.a2pro_developers, Mar 05 2007)[EOA][ATU]Appleworks Word Processor to TXT Utility""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""(From the February issue:)Does anyone know of a utility, macro, or script - for ProDOS, GS/OS,Classic, or OS X - that will batch convert AWP files to TXT?(kgagne, a2c.appleworks, Jan 28 2007)>>>>>"""""(From the February issue:)There's lots of utilities that will do it, with lots of variations.

On my PowerPCmachine, I can still use AW5 to convert files -- but for someone withhundreds of files to convert on an Intel Mac, there are multiple reasonswhy AW5 isn't an option.I think I will try MacLinkPlus, as recommended by Sheppy and detailed here:http://www.dataviz.com/products/maclinkplus/mlp_xlators.htmlI had previously checked this site but had overlooked its support for AppleII formats, since they're listed under the heading "Macintosh WordProcessing Formats".
