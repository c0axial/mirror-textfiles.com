A simple enough philosophy that could substitute forat least four of the courses I took in graduate school, yet one not enoughof us subscribe to.     I got a call from an Apple IIgs user on the island who needed a newcopy of a system disk.  I don't have a license to distribute it--mostpeople don't--so the short term answer would've been to refer him to ourlocal user group (The Hawai'i Macintosh and Apple Users Society--althoughdropping the "and Apple" from their name would be more than appropriatenowadays).  He could've gotten his disk, I could've gotten on to the otherthings I need to do.     Instead, I told him what I believed best--that his Apple II needswould be served by getting online, and subscribing to the remaining AppleII publications, including this one.     For the Apple II user, it's a more valuable gift to get them involvedwith the Apple II community than it is to replace their trashed systemdisk.     I could have fed him for the night.  I decided to teach him to fishinstead.     If the computing world at large is fast becoming an electroniccommunity, Apple II users must be acutely aware that our village is small,and without the assistance of Apple Computer, Inc., or any other largemultinational corporations, the only way the Apple II community willcontinue to survive in the 21st century is if the entire village learns tofish.     Use your opportunities with other Apple II users to teach independenceand self-sufficiency, and use the magic of the virtual and actual printedword to build the Apple II village to house us into the new century.  Everytime we feed the Apple II user rather than teach him how to fish, we losean opportunity to have a long-lasting positive impact on our community, andwe're not doing ourselves any favors that way.     Teach the Apple II fanatic how to fish, and we all become stronger,more independent, and more self-sufficient.  Not to mention better fed.     Besides, if everyone in your village depends on you to feed them, whatwill they eat when you're in Kansas City in July?                                [*] [*] [*]     Sorry, I blew it department: this issue of _The Lamp!_ must include anapology to Delphi users who eagerly await the release of _The Lamp!_ fromthe _IIScribe_ Forum's Database.  Somehow, the original archives of thecompressed text and Appleworks versions of _The Lamp!_ becameread-disabled.  My sincere apologies.                                [*] [*] [*]     By the time you get this, it'll likely be just past the time thatearly registration prices for the Apple II event of the year, KansasFest1998, expire.

This month is the story of the construction of the KFest IIgs, anApple IIgs that's easier to bring on the trip to Avila than the standardhigh performance model, yet doesn't require the Dremel-wielding skills of aTony Diaz to put together.  In coming months we'll look at other reasons toshow up in the hot summer sun at the even hotter Apple II event of theyear.  Don't miss the opportunity to be among the dozens of Apple IIfaithful at Avila College in Kansas City, Missouri in July.     It'll be one heckuva fishing trip.Ryanthelamp@delphi.comASCII ART BEGINS_________  _                     _                                      _|__   __| | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |                   | |                                    | |   | |    | |___     ____       | |       _____   __ ___ _   _ _____   | |   | |    | ___ \   / __ \      | |      /____ \  | v   v | | v ___ \  | |   | |    | |  | | | /__\ \     | |       ____| | | /\ /\ | |  /   \ \ | |   | |    | |  | | | _____|     | |      / ___  | | || || | | |    | | |_|   | |    | |  | | | |_____     | |____  | |__| | | || || | |  \___/ /  _   |_|    |_|  |_| \______|     |______| \____^_| |_||_||_| | |\____/  |_|                                                            | |                                                            | |                                                            |_|ASCII ART ENDS[EOA][OPN]------------------------------     A FUNNY THING HAPPENED. . . . |-----------------------------------Checking out A2 on Delphi"""""""""""""""""""""""""by Ryan M.

After all, we're used to tinkering with oursystems and know all about what's "under the hood."It seemed to both of us that people who got started with the Apple II arejust more adventurous and less intimidated by computers.Contrast the differences...when a Windows 95 program is downloaded, a userjust has to click on a file named Install, but when a similar Apple II orIIGS program is downloaded, we actually perform the installation ourselves.Most of us can look at our IIGS System folder and know about everything init, mainly because if it's a system add-on, we put it there ourselves. Aska Windows 95 user about all the files on his/her hard drive, and you'lldraw blank stares.The adventurous and friendly nature of the Apple II community lends itselfto being a valuable resource for non-Apple II related questions andproblems.I can think of dozens of times when I've seen messages posted to an AppleII area online that starts out with, "Hi. I asked this Mac (or IBM) relatedquestion on the Mac (or IBM) forum but didn't get an answer, so I'm postingit here." And, invariably, an answer is supplied real quick.Apple II Forever!! Joe Kohn http://www.crl.com/~joko                       (JOE_KOHN, 10735, GO COM A2)>>>>>   A discussion I have had at various times with different Apple II"""""   people, although invariably at KFest. . .Apple II people tend to also be the kind of people who like things like oldcars (Tony Diaz), tube amplifiers (Steve Godzilla), old bicycles (me), andall kinds of other "dead technology".They also tend to be the kinds of people who pop the hood on their cars,change their own oil and spark plugs, build their own furniture, and fixtheir own plumbing.The generation of computer teachers approaching retirement now are also theones that grew up on the Apple II.  When they're gone, it'll be tough forthe ones left behind to keep them going. . . but it'll also be tough forthe ones left behind to keep any set of computers going.  It's not so muchthe technical knowledge as the mindset.  The lack of fear to open the hoodand work on stuff.When one of my friends was having computer problems with his 486 and calledme with what appeared to be a hardware problem, I told him to shut thething off, take the cards out and put 'em back in, and take the cables offand put them back on, he thought I was nuts.

After all, if a picture isworth 1,000 words, a demo of a software program speaks volumes.For those unfamiliar with ShiftyList, in short, it's a GS/OS utility thatallows you to choose which items you want loaded after doing a Shift-Boot.Without something like ShiftyList installed, when you shift-boot, no DAs orInits get loaded. But sometimes, you might want to perform a shift-boot forincreased system stability, but you also need something like Pointless orHardPressed or IR installed. With ShiftyList, you can do that.Soon after Sheppy released ShiftyList 2, Max Jones wrote a rave review ofit in Juiced.GS. But again, with the ShiftyList demo available fordownload, no one has to take mine or Max's word for how useful ShiftyListcan be; they can see for themselves. Joe Kohn http://www.crl.com/~joko                       (JOE_KOHN, 11211, GO COM A2)<<<<<   As a follow-up to my post about ShiftyList, I wanted to post the"""""   Delphi Library filename of the demo and on which ftp sites it canbe found.But, first, let's inject some Sheppy humor into the discussion ;-)I found the following write-up within Dave Grenda's report on KansasFest1995 and I'm re-posting that here, mainly for the last line, which reallycracked me up:"ShiftyList 2.0 will be distributed on a Softdisk G-S issue. This versionis a very powerful update.  By holding down different key combinationsduring booting, you can load different groups of INITs, NDAs,  CDAs, andCDEVs.  The composition of each group is determined by the user beforehand.You can also create boot scripts.  Scripts could run pictures or soundsduring booting.  For example, you could display a picture and play a sound,load some INITs, display a new picture, load some NDAs/CDAs, displayanother picture and play a sound, and load the rest of your system - totaluser control.  Sheppy expects ShiftyList to be out at the end of the year.He lost three months of work when his hard drive crashed.  As Sheppyremarked, "apparently back-ups aren't for weenies."More seriously, Sheppy himself describes ShiftyList 2 as follows:   The latest version of one of the most popular utilities of recent   Apple II history.

I normally keep it closed, but when opened, I have it sortedby name.  There are aliases to folders made with EasyMount (I have a customicon that I made for Easymount documents that is a pink folder, as opposedto my usual yellow).  I then create all my application/document aliaseswith Workset (from Six-Pack).  Why this approach?  Well:Workset is an extremely powerful aliasing FinderExtra. With it you can:o Create an alias to a foldero Create an alias to an application.  Within the alias to the application,you can attach folders and documents.  You can 'mark' documents and folderswithin the Workset for opening, and press the Option key whiledouble-clicking the Workset document to customize them prior to launching.Extremely flexible.  Some of the flexibility includes: - Create a Workset with a document marked, and if the program can open thedocument, it will when launched.  Note that you can mark/open _multiple_documents in some applications! - Have a folder within an Application Workset. If it is marked, it isautomatically passed to the application as the default folder for openingdocuments.o Include Workset documents in Launchlist (Also from Six-Pack).  Thisprovides a window on the Finder desktop containing all your launchableitems on all drives.  You can negotiate it with keystrokes (e.g. - Type 'G'to get to the items starting with 'G').I have created icons for the Workset document type/subtype, customized forthe application or document name.  However, over the time I have used it, Ifind that I prefer to use a simple Workset icon (based on the Symlink icon)that tells me that I am not launching the 'real thing'.  Two examples:1) I have a Workset for AWGS.  As a default, it has my AWGS templatesfolder marked, and a document that is all set up with my usual WPpreferences (font, margins, tabs).  Double-click, and I am in the WP readyto type.2) I have a Workset for ANSITerm (a P8 program that supports receiving astartup document pathname).  I have multiple startup scripts in theWorkset, but the default is the launch script for OLRight!  I have namedthis script 'OLRight', but if I option-double-click, I can pick one of theothers instead of the OLRight startup document.Whew!

An easy install Updater script is provided, so it isvery easy to update your existing files.Unless you have customised any of the original COG set of scripts, allexisting settings will be preserved.

The sequence is supposed to bethe same off the same seed. That's the theory.   Where this can severely break down in practice is that programs rarelyrun solo on the GS anymore. Inits, DAs, etc may all want random numbers,and if they take them, that messes up your nice sequence. There's nodocumented way for any init/etc to get a few random numbers and then goback to the same state in the sequence. While this may seem drastic, theonly way you're going to get the same set of random #s out of _Random is todisable interrupts, grab 64K numbers, and then reenable interrupts.Anything less invites problems.   Further, I've seen a whole bunch of cases when _Random will godegenerate and return only 0s until the cows come home. Anything notchacking that (and the tool call is _Random, not _Zero) and assuming it'lleventually find something in the right range is gonna hit an infinite loop.Even if your app doesn't check for that, you may get seriously skewedresults from a non-random # generator.   If you're wanting guaranteed results out of a random number generator,I'd really advise using your own private internal one where you have somelevel of control over how and when it's called. Even if you don't, checkingfor a degenerate random # stream out of _Random (anything more than about100 0's in a row out of it is so improbable in ideal conditions that youshould definitely reseed it by then) can save you a lot of headaches.   I'd seriously like to patch the random # generator to reseed when itgoes degenerate, but some currently may be (mistakenly) thinking they candepend on _Random. I hope this posting causes you to rethink basicassumptions about the toolbox, as your apps do not have full control overthis call, sorry. This is a slightly bad design to begin with, andworkarounds would be best for all.Nathan "I break everything" Mates                         (NMATES, 1583, GO COM A2)>>>>>   I renew my objection to changing the behavior of Random.

This means that you can't get anymore than 64K numbers before it starts to repeat, and in practice thenumber will be far smaller. It's not a good solution for computer programsthat can easily generate hundreds of numbers.(Footnote: Generating 64K numbers will generally not, as one person seemsto assume, cycle the random number generator back to it's starting point.To do that you have to copy and restore the seed.)At the same time, all of the ORCA languages have a built in random numbergenerator. They have had this same random number generator since ORCA wasreleased under DOS 3.3. It has withstood my own tests, as well as those ofMerlin's author (a mathematics professor at Princeton who sorely wanted tosee it break). It has an extremely long period, yet generates numbersquickly. In fact, the period is so long that I promise you you won't breakeven the simplest encryption method based on this random number generatorby brute force--with QuickDraw II, it would take at most 64K tries,something you can to an Apple ][ in Applesoft. Source code is available,and always has been, so anyone can examine it or coax it to give differentnumber formats.A few people who didn't know a random number generator from a quadraticequation accused it of generating bad numbers. Yes, as any book that coversrandom numbers will point out, if you give it a horrible seed (or no seedat all) it will behave poorly. Yet even with a seed of 0, something thatstymies most random number generators, it bounces back to a good sequenceafter a few hundred numbers. So what's a good seed? That's documented inthe ORCA manuals. A good seed has approximately the same number of 1's and0's, in no particular sequence. Where do you see that documented for QDII?All I can figure is that people have an attitude that if it was invented atApple, it's better than any alternative.

The caveat, as will all Cimplementations, is that you not have any whitespace between the "#defineF" and the '(', otherwise you change the semantics of the macro.BTW, I recommend that any serious C programmer get a copy of the ANSI orISO/C specification and keep it handy.  If you can't afford the officialspecification, the Schildt book is a suitable replacement, as long as youignore Schildt's annotations.Devin                       (GLYNREADE, 1554, GO COM A2)>>>>>   Actually, this information is in the ORCA/C manual, but like many"""""   things you want to know in day to day programming, it involves twoseemingly unrelated pieces of information. It's not explicitly spelled outin the manual. I made an effort to cover each and every feature of thelanguage, but I don't regard it as reasonable or even desirable to coverall combinations of two features, let alone higher numbers. :)The first piece of information is a direct answer to the original question.ORCA/C does not support multi-line macros. Neither does any other Ccompiler I am aware of.The second piece of information, which explains the technical hairsplitting of that last comment, is on page 235, under the caption"Continuation Lines." It explains that the \ character, used at the end of_any_ line, causes an _immediately_ subsequent end of line mark to betreated as a space. In other words, you can split _any_ line in two, aslong as you do it where a space is allowed. This is true in most Ccompilers. I think it's part of the standard, but I'd have to check to makesure before stating flatly that it is, and I'm too lazy to walk over andpluck it off the shelf right now.So you can use the backslash character as it was used in the example toforce a macro to appear on multiple lines, but technically, this isn't amulti-line macro feature--you're just taking advantage of another featureof the preprocessor that allows you to tell the preprocessor to ignore aphysical line feed.Ick. Technical goop and double-talk. But it's these nitty details that haveto be covered for a complete understanding (or documentation) of thelanguage. :)Mike Westerfield                       (BYTEWORKS, 1563, GO COM A2)[EOA][KFE]------------------------------                    THINKING KFEST |-----------------------------------THE KFEST GS PROJECT""'"""""""""""""""""by Ryan M. Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                             ON THE ROAD AGAIN                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Another year, another KansasFest.  Unless you've been totally out ofthe loop for a few months, you know that the Apple II event of the year isset for July 22-26, 1998, on the campus of Avila College in Kansas City,Missouri.  Apple II fanatics from all over the world will converge on atiny college in the middle of the United States to have all kinds of funwith all kinds of programs, hardware, and no sleep whatsoever.     Despite the recent development of Apple II and IIgs emulators thatwill run on Intel based or Macintosh notebook computers--infinitely moreportable than any Apple II ever built--the feeling of showing up at KFestwithout a real Apple II is akin to showing up at the senior prom in a tanktop and Bermuda shorts--you're definitely underdressed.     Unfortunately, the realities of cross-country travel make it difficultto bring anything but a laptop computer if you fly to K.C., as I do.  Analternative is to ship your Apple II up to Kansas City via a courier suchas United Parcel Service, and pick it up there, which I've done severaltimes.  However, just the act of packing up so many different components toship over--the CPU, the external floppy drive, an external SCSI hard drive,a System Saver, a Floptical drive, a Zip Drive, a monitor. . . whew!  Thebox alone weighed about 30 pounds.  The IIgs might be a heavyweightcontender, but my back and my pocketbook could appreciate less heavy metal.     So, my task for this year was to come up with a IIgs that would bemore user-friendly for transporting to Kansas City--something that,excepting the monitor, could be brought with me, rather than shipped.  Atthe same time, I refused to sacrifice performance.     Taking a basic IIgs CPU (ROM_01) that I had lying around, I quicklyadded a four megabyte CV Tech memory board and a ZipGSX 8 mhz accelerator,instantly skyrocketing performance.  These products were added due toavailability--I had them both unused here--and with the goal of minimizingheat and power usage.  The IIgs is notorious for problems with heat andpower, and it was imperative to try and minimize these with the parts onhand.  The alternatives--adding a six megabyte Applied Engineering memoryboard and a Transwarp GS accelerator--were likely to use considerably morepower and considerably more heat, and considering the goal of taking lessequipment to Kansas City than in previous years, one of the main objectivestowards that goal is being able to leave the System Saver GS at home foronce.     A small clip-on fan, similar to those sold by Alltech Electronics, wasinstalled to help ward off the hot and humid July Avila weather.  Thislittle fan doesn't block any slots, mounts totally within the IIgs case,and draws power directly from the IIgs motherboard.  It doesn't match thecooling power of a System Saver, but, importantly, it doesn't representsomething more to pack.     With speed and memory taken care of, my attention next turned tostorage.  Wanting to be able to exchange floppies with our Intelnotebook-toting friends who inevitably show up at KFest, 3.5 inch diskdrives that handle both 800K GCR and 1440K MFM floppies is a must.  Notwanting to take both an Apple 3.5 Drive and either a Floptical or BlueDisksetup with me, I installed a SuperDrive Card and attached an AppliedEngineering High Density Drive, a SuperDrive equivalent.     All that's left is to add a hard drive and a modem to our KFest GS tobe ready to go.  While there are other internal hard drives for the AppleIIgs out there, there was really only one choice: Alltech Electronics'Focus Drive.  This 2.5 inch IDE drive on a card comes in a variety ofsizes, is fast, reliable, and mounts entirely within the case of a //e orIIgs.  Sizes from a tiny (but useful) 20 megs up to a gargantuan 1 gigabyteplus are available.  A tiny external modem (as compared to an internal, butslow, Applied Engineering 2400 baud modem) would complete the package.While I am usually not a fan of modems with built-in cables, the SupraExpress modem is tiny, proven, and with cables connecting to the IIgsserial port (for data) and ADB port (for power), it didn't require anythingadditional to carry--no hardware handshake cable or wall wart.  Onedisadvantage--because the power cord is built into the modem and there isno on/off switch, to do a hardware reset, you need to power down thecomputer.     Compared to the IIgs setups I've taken to KansasFests past, this KFestGS is considerably lighter and less bulky, and I won't have any problemstuffing it into my duffel bag along with the trademark Bermuda shorts andtank tops (although the monitor will still be shipped).  While the KFest GSmay be lighter and sleeker than its predecessors, it packs as much punch asthe next GS.  Look out, Avila, here we come![EOA][FRE]------------------------------                FREEWARE FAVORITES |-----------------------------------FILE-A-TRIX"""""""""""by Ryan M.

Apple IIgs users commonly use the ubiquitous Finder to handle thesebasic file management duties; others use _Prosel_, _Wings_, the _Salvation_series, or any of a number of other tools.  All of these programs havetheir strengths, and any of them can handle these basic tasks.     But sometimes we're in another program that doesn't have these filemanagement tools, and we need to do something--copy a file, delete a file,rename it, or something else.  For these times, a desk accessory can be alife-saver.  Enter _File-A-Trix_.     Originally shareware, later reclassified by the author to freeware,_File-A-Trix_ is one of Karl Bunker's "Bunkerware" collection, anoldie-but-goodie in the Apple II world.  It's a Classic Desk Accessory,usable from either ProDOS 8 or GS/OS, that allows you to handle your basicfile management tasks.     Borrowing heavily from the interface of Glen Bredon's classic_Prosel_, _File-A-Trix_ gives you full management power over your files.You can copy, move, delete, lock, unlock, rename, and find files;initialize 3.5 disks; set file attributes (filetypes and auxtypes); createnew folders; and view text files.  Because _File-A-Trix_ uses the textinterface, its fast; because it's a Classic Desk Accessory, it's usablefrom both ProDOS 8 and GS/OS.  And because it's free, it's an incrediblebargain.     One concern with _File-A-Trix_ is its ability to access files underProDOS 8.  Like any other file management program used under ProDOS 8, onemust be careful with forked GS/OS or imported Macintosh files. Other thanthat, I have no reservations about the program. _File-A-Trix_ plain works,with little flash but full function, in the best tradition of the Apple II,and the price is definitely right.  Sometimes the best things in life arefree--and _File-A-Trix_ is one of those things.  I recommend itwhole-heartedly for the most basic or advanced IIgs user.[EOA][WEB]------------------------------                  WEB SLINGING 101 |-----------------------------------Using Your Delphi Web Workspace~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~by Ryan M. Suenaga, B.A., M.S.W., L.S.W.                    [thelamp@delphi.com]                      IF YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Last month, I promised to use this month's column to keep you up todate on more Apple II hangouts on the World Wide Web.  I'll amend that abit--this month we'll put you through the basic steps of creating your ownlittle hangout on the World Wide Web using your Delphi account's WebWorkspace.     Every Delphi account (other than the totally free Web accounts) isallotted ten megabytes of "workspace" on Delphi's servers.  You can usethis workspace a number of ways: you can store files on it, for instance,or use it with File Transfer Protocol (ftp) when you find files on theInternet you either want to download for your own use or submit to theDelphi Databases.  One of the more popular uses of this workspace is toallot some of it for use as a "Web Workspace".  When used this way, you canhave your own page on the World Wide Web right on Delphi.     The URL for your Web page on Delphi will be:     http://people.delphi.com/username     where "username" is your Delphi username.  For instance, my Delphipage is accessed at http://people.delphi.com/rsuenaga, since my username onDelphi is rsuenaga.     Before we even begin discussing how to use the Delphi Web Workspace,it's imperative to understand at least some of the HyperText MarkupLanguage (also known as HTML).  This is the "language" of the World WideWeb, the text files that are translated into the hypermedia experience yousee when you view the World Wide Web with a graphical browser.     While I'd stop short of calling HTML a full-fledged programminglanguage, in a lot of ways it certainly is as complex and challenging asany computer language.  At the same time, it can be very simple.  A primeron HTML is beyond the scope of this article.  There are many books on thesubject, as well as sites on the World Wide Web starters, try the resourcesavailable at:     http://www.delphi.com/pubweb/hres.html     Of course, since this is an Apple II publication, I encourage you todo what you can to make your pages Apple II compatible.  Nathan Mates,well-known programmer and keeper of the comp.sys.apple2 FAQ, has drawn up aset of guidelines to ensure your Apple II Web page is viewable on an AppleII.  You can review these guidelines over at:     http://www.visi.com/~nathan/a2/a2viewable.html     Once you've prepared the files you want for your Delphi Web page, it'stime to start uploading your pages.  The first thing you need to do is getover to your Web workspace area.  To do this, at a Delphi main prompt,enter:     GO COM NAV WORK WEB     This will take you to a prompt that looks like:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------WEB-WS>[END OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------------     From this prompt, you can upload your files to your Web workspace,create or remove directories, or delete files already there.  Delphi'slisting of commands that can be used from this prompt is:[BEGINNING OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------APPEND to File        UPLOAD FileCATALOG Files         KERMIT-ServerCOPY File             WEB SiteCOUNT Words           INFO about Web SitesCREATE File           CD (Change Web Dir)DELETE File           LS (List Files)DOWNLOAD File         MV (Move/Rename Files)EDIT File             MKDIR (Make Web Dir)HOME Workspace        RMDIR (Remove Web Dir)LIST File             CLEAN (Clean up Web)PUBLISH File          UNZIP to Web SitePURGE Old Versions    FTP (File Transfer Protocol)RENAME File           Other CommandsSETTINGS              HELPSUBMIT File           EXITUNPROTECT File[END OF SCREEN EXAMPLE ]------------------------------------------     You're likely to mainly be concerned about uploading files.  Delphiappears to be set up to automatically accept ZModem uploads, although Ican't find any documentation about that anywhere.  If you have had successuploading and downloading files (see this column in the February 1998version of _The Lamp!_) using ZModem, just go ahead and try starting anupload from the WEB-WS> prompt.  If not, you may need to fall back on thereliable but maddeningly slow Kermit protocol.     Once your files are uploaded, you'll simply need to issue the PUBLISHcommand to give everyone access to your files.  Delphi will ask you toconfirm the date you want to use as the publishing date of the files, andoff you go.     To confirm that everything is as you want, you probably want to visityour home page with your favorite browser.  Just go to yourpeople.delphi.com URL, and see if things are as you want.  If they aren't,you can download the files from your Delphi workspace, edit them, deletethe files in your workspace, re-upload them, and re-publish.     There you have your new Apple II friendly Web page.  We'll keeplooking at the WWW from the Apple II point of view in coming issues.         :: DISCUSSED ON DELPHI ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::         :                                                       :         :     As a writer, I always thought I made a pretty     :         :                   good programmer.                    :         :                                                       :         ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: TONYW1 ::::[EOA][INN]------------------------------                     EXTRA INNINGS |-----------------------------------About The Lamp!
