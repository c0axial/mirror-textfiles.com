		  Powerful Open Macintosh Expands Applications


  AppleWorld, Los Angeles, California, March 2, 1987.  Apple Computer, Inc.
today introduced a high-performence, open architecture member of the Macintosh
personal computer family, the Macintosh II.  The new Macintosh offers users
high speed, expansion and fleibility.  It modular design and open architecture
permit a number of display options, including color displays, and th ability to
incorporate add-in cards from Apple and third party for additional
functionality.

  This top-of-the-line model is intended for advanced applications in business,
desktop publishing, higher education and engineering enviroments.

  "Because of its power and expandability, The Macintosh II strengthens Apple's
position in markets in which we are already participating and extends the
Macintosh personal computer family into new markets," said William V.
Campbell, executive vice president U.S.  Sales and Marketing.

  At introduction, the Macintosh II operates most existing Macintosh
applications up to 4 times faster than the Macintosh Plus.  The Macintosh II
offers upward compatability with the majority of existing applications.  Apple
is working closely with third-party hardware and software developers to ensure
that a wide range of software, peripherals and add-on cards are developed to
take full advantage of the advanced features of te Macintosh II.



			   Macintosh II Specifications


  The Macintosh II is based on the 32-bit Motorola 68020 microprecessor
operating at 16 megaherta (MHz).  It includes a floating point arithmetic chip,
the 68881, that can perform mathematical operations up to 200 times faster then
the 68020.  These features let the Macintosh II process at a speed of 2 million
instructions per second (2 MIPS).  The Macintosh II also features transfer
rates greater then 1 megabyte(MB) per second over its Small Computer Systems
Interface(SCSI) interface.

  The Macintosh II come standard with 1 MB of random-access memory(RAM),
expandable to 8 MB on the logic board.	Additional RAM expansion of up to 1.5
gigabytes(GB) can be achived with add-in boards.

  The Macintosh II provides Macintosh Plus-compatable ports for a SCSI
connection, two RS-422 serial ports, an external SCSI disk drive interface and
a sound port with four-voice stereo capability.  Like all Macintoh computers,
the Macintosh II has the AppleTalk network built in.

  In addition, the Macintosh II includes six slots that use the
high-performance NuBus protocols.  NuBus is a processor-independent, industry
standard bus that supports 8-, 16- 32-bit data paths.  It permits the fast
transferof large quantities of data between add-on cards and he logic board.
NuBus features fair arbitration and geographical addressing.  Te two
characteristics let the add-on cards "identify" themselves so, unlike other
computer systems thereis no need to set dip switches to configurethe ystem.
Because NuBus lets add-in cards be placed in any slot, thre is exceptional
flexibility and ease associated with system configuration.  Th six slots let
the Macintosh II operate a wide range of performance-driven, deanding
applicatons and expand as users' needs expand.

  The video interface is provided by the Macintosh II video card which fits in
one of the slots.  The card can drive either of the high-resolution monitors
introduced today.  In its standard configuration, the card can simultaneously
generate 16 colors or shades of gray from a standard palette of more than 16
million colors.  With the addition of the Macintosh II video Card Expansion
Kit, the card can generate up to 256 colors or shades of gray from te same
palette.

  Users may choose a 12-inch, high-resolution, monochrome monitor or a 13-inch,
high-resolution red-green-blue(RGB) color monitor.  Both display units feature
640 x 480 pixel resolution and utilize an analog input format.	This formatlets
the monochrome monitor display millions of gray values and he color monitor
display millions of colors or gray values.

  The monochrome monitor, which is capable of displaying the full width and
over half the length of a page, suits a need in productivity applications such
as word processing, spreadsheets and business graphics.

  The RGB monitor combines the full-width viewing area with te unique
capability of displaying high-resolution text and graphics in both colorand
black-and-white.  This provides the Macintosh II user with a versatile,
high-performance monitor capable of satisfying a broad spectrum of user needs
from word processing to advanced graphics.  A tilt-and-swivel monitor stand is
available as an option for the high-resolution monitors.  Users can configure
the Macintosh II with multiple monitors by adding video cards in slots.
Various monitors and video cards are also available from third parties.  The
Macintosh II also includes the Apple Desktop Bus(ADB) standard interface for
input peripherals.  ADB is also used on the Macintosh SE as well as the Apple
//gs.  The ADB lets users connect up to 16 input devices concurrently,
including such peripherals as a keyboard, mouse or graphics tablet.  Users may
also choose from two Apple keyboards:  the Apple Keyboard includes a typewriter
style layout, a numeric keypad and cursor keys:  and the Apple Extended
Keyboard includes the numeric keypad, function keys and special purpose keys
for sing alternative operating systems, such as MS-DOS or terminal emulation
programs.  Keyboards are packaged and sold separately.	The Macintosh II can
internally accomodate, simultaneously, up to two 800 kilobyte(KB) floppy disk
drives and one 20, 40, 80 MB hard disk.  Both the 40 and 80 MB hard disks
feature a very fast access time of less then 30 milliseconds(ms).  In addition,
up to six storage devices can be daisy-chained through the external SCSI port.
For those users who want to back up critical data from thier hard disks, Apple
also introduced an optional SCSI 40 MB tape backup unit, which provides file
and image backup on preformatted, one-quarter-inch tpae cartridges.  Apple also
introduced the Apple EtherTalk interface Card, which provides direct
connectivity to Ethernet networks for the Macintosh II.  Apple will support
AppleTalk network architecture and A/UX (Apple's UNIX product) networking
software enviroment for use with the EtherTalk Card.  Third party vendors are
expected to provide software support allowing connectivity to other
enviroments.  The EtherTalk product will be available in the second half of
1987.



			Alternative Operating Enviroments


A/UX, a version of AT&T UNIX

  Apple also announced today that it will offer a version of the UNIX operating
system for the Macintosh II.  This operating system is widely used in
universities, in government and by technical professionals.  An optional
Motorola 68851 paged memory management unit (PMMU) is required for A/UX and
will be available from Apple.  Unisoft Systems developed a significant portion
of A/UX under contract with Apple.  A/UX is a full implementation of the AT&T
UNIX, System V, Release 2 Version 2 operating system and includes features from
Berkeley's 4.2 BSD version.  The featurs incorporated from 4.2 BSD provide easy
portability of programs from 4.2 BSD to A/UX and andvanced communications
capabilities.

  A Macintosh II running A/UX offers the tradidional user interface of a UNIX
operating system:  a high-powered command line interpreter.  Standard UNIX
System V applications can be easily ported to A/UX.  Additionally, a key
enhancement from Apple lets A/UX developers have full access to the Macintosh
Toolbox.  A/UX applications can therefore have the complete look and feel of
Macintosh programs.  New applications, properly designed, can operate in both
enviroments.

  A/UX also offers, through add-in cards, connections to Ethernet, AppleTalk
and serial communications networks using standard UNIX communications and
electronic mail systems.  It can also act as a server or a client on a Sun
Microsystems Network File Systems (NFS) Ethernet network.  The Apple EtherTalk
Interface Card provides direct connectivity to Ethernet networks for the
Macintosh II.  A/UX is expected to ship this sumer.  Pricing and licensing will
be announced in May.

MS-DOS

	Apple's goal is to provide data file inter-change with other operating
systems, to provide MS-DOS data file compatability, Apple is introducing
InterFile, file transfer software, a 5.25-inch MS-DOS floppy disk drive and
drive controler cards.	In addition, MS-DOS coprocessor cards for te Macintosh
II and the Macintosh SE are available from third parties.
	For example, users who purchase the 5.25-inch drive and controler card
from Apple can read in a Lotus 1-2-3 data file so it can be used in a
spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, on the Macintosh.  Or, users who
choose a coprocessor card from a third party can run dBase III or Lotus 1-2-3
in a window on the Macintosh screen.



			      International Models


  Apple is Simultaneously introducing the Macintosh II available in 15
localized versions in 10 different languages, including English, French,
German, Spanish, Flemish, Norwegian, Japanese, Dutch, Swedish and Italian.  The
Macintosh II features a universal power supply that permits operation with all
common voltage.



			      Price and Availablity


	The Macintosh II will be available in May in two configurations in a
new platinum color: a basic system, including 1 MB of RAM and one 800KB floppy
disk drive is offeredat a suggested retail price of $3,898, inclusing keyboard;
a second configuration, including 1 MB of RAM, one 800KB floppy disk drive and
one 40 MB internal SCSI hard disk is listed at a suggested retail price of
$5,498, inclusing keyboard.  Many of the other products introduced today are
available as options for the Macintosh II.



			      Macintosh Technology


	Macintosh personal computer technology -- manfested by ease of use,
graphics and unique functionality -- features a very high level of software
consistancy and tight intergration across all applications, resulting in low
requirements for user support and training.
	These attributes have contributed to the widespread acceptance of the
Macintosh personal computer family accross all sizes of business and in higher
education and has increased momentum by third-party developers over the past
year.
	Over one million Macintosh computers handle business, education and
consumer applications.
