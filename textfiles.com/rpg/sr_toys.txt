Subject: SR: Shadowrun Cybertoys ...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay - There were some chummers out there wanting new ideas and such. A few 
of
these are variations on old themes, some are new, and some are just plain
strange. But you know shadowrunners, always the cutting edge in strange stuff
and weird ideas. Some of these guys are obviously only for the ultra rich of
the corps and the military, while others are set up for the professional,
others even for the trendsetter with nuyen to burn ...

 I'd like to know what you chummers think of this stuff ... Not prices ...
Those vary from game to game ... I'm talking the ideas ... 

==============================================================================


 Absorption Moduals -
=======================
  Essence: .3                 
  Cost: 75K
 Absorption moduals are a series of capacitors and disipators which will 
absorb 
one wound catagory of an electrical attack automaticly, or reduce stun time 
by 
an extra d6 (Warning: Overloading Absorption moduals can prove hazardous to 
your health)


 Skeletal Implants -
======================
  Essence: 2.6 (Beta)         
  Cost: 1,400K
    Body (+2)
 Replaces arm and leg bones and joints, as well as reinforcing the spine and 
neck. The joints have locking mechanisms, as well as allowing many
``unnatural'' contortions. Super-alloy implants weigh the same as normal bone.
These allow you to utilize those enchanced-strength cyberlimbs to their 
fullest
potential. Absorption moduals are an option (No essence cost, 100K)


 Wings I -
============
  Essence: .4 (Beta)          
  Cost: 700K
 These thin fiber-plastic membranes connect to the body from the wrists, along
the sides of the torso, along the outside of the leg to the ankle. Along the
connection points are ``reels'' which can furl the membrane to the arm, body,
and leg. When furled, the membrane is difficult to notice (Concealability of 
9).
The one drawback is that one cannot have any binding material along the sides
of the body, for it impedes the membrane. Suggested use with Skeletal 
Implants,
due to increased control with locking joints. Glide ratio - 1:10. With
successful skill test, each success will gain 1 meter of altitude.


 Wings II -
=============
  Essence: .3 (Alpha)
  Cost: 150K
 These wings are very similar to the above Wings, but are only attached to the
Arm, needing specially constructed clothing to attach to the wings. These 
wings
are not as stable as the other wings, having a tendency to come unattached
during manauvers in flight. Glide ratio 1:4.


 Dermal Clothing -
====================
  Essence: (As normal Dermal Alpha or Beta) 
  Cost: Normal Dermal + 5K then x3 or x7
 These tailored dermal plates have clothing attachments, as well as being
equivilent to a suit of Fine (Alpha) or Tres Chic (Beta) clothing themselves.
They work as normal dermal armour. Suggested use with Wings, thus allowing the
recipient to use the wings and not feel quite so exposed.


 Dermal Injectors -
=====================
  Essence: (As normal Dermal Alpha or Beta)
  Cost: Normal Dermal + 10K then x3 or x7
 These implants are built into the dermal armour, and allow for injections of
drugs directly into the body. Built in supplies area will hold 10 separate 
doses of drugs, which need not be set off in a predetermined sequence. Cost 
for
combining with Dermal clothing = + 15K instead of + 10K.


 Bear Trap -
==============
  Essence: .4 (Alpha)
  Cost: 12K
 This implant replaces a hand, and is suggested with use of a cyberarm due to
torque often encountered during combat. It is, as the name suggests, a bear
trap with two serrated jaws. It is spring operated, but with return servos and
a locking mechanism. It clenches with a strength of 8, and does 4S2 damage as
it initially clenches.


 Rotorhand -
==============
  Essence: .6 (Alpha)
  Cost: 120K
 This destructive device is one of the most unnerving of all the cyber-
weapons.
The hand is replaced with two counter-rotating, three blade units and a high
speed engine. The batteries are good for 5 minutes of full use. It takes one
full round (3 seconds) to come up to speed. This is usually only available to
military shock troops. Damage 8S1. (User needs a concentration in Armed Combat
to use properly otherwise, use is at a target number of +3.)


 Sawarm -
===========
  Essence: .7 (Alpha)
  Cost: 90K
 If you like chainsaws, this is for you. This attachment requires the removal
of a hand and most of the forearm. The heavy-duty electric engine has battery
power for 10 minutes of continuous use, and takes one round to come up to
speed. Found usually in Lumbering Corperations or the military. Damage 7S1.
(User needs a concentration in Armed Combat to use properly otherwise, use is
at a target number of +3.)



 Power-Fingers -
==================
  Essence: .5
  Cost: 60K
 Power-Fingers are a gift to those who always feel that they can never find
the right tool. Now, you can have the tool you need at your fingertips, or
rather, in your fingertips. Thumb and forefinger form Vise-Grips, while the
other three digits have removable tips which reveal the power tool
interchanges. All applicable attachments are included (In sets applicable for
each (B/R) skill). The entire hand must be replaced. Due to the power drain,
the hand must be periodicly recharged.  Specially tailored hands are 
available,
for specially tailored prices. Don't be afraid to ask, we've even gone to the
extent of making a specially tailored hand for one of the great French chefs.


 MechoArm (MechoLeg) -
========================
  Essence: 1 (Alpha)
  Cost: *Varies*
 This cyberlimb comes in several varients, each for your need. The Electro is
specially designed for the engineer, while the Vehicular line comes set for
almost any transportation device. The ARMourer varient is perfect for the
professional firearms entrepreneur. Each of the varients comes with built-in
tool kits*, Power-Fingers(tm), and a mini-comp full of useful data (Rating 4).
The leg variants have detachable power tools instead of the power-fingers.
Costs: 
ARMourer  (Armed Combat)      375K
          (Firearms)          375K
          (Gunnery)           375K
Electro   (Cyberware)         390K
          (Electronics)       390K
          (Computer)          390K
Medicarm  (Paramedic)         400K
          (Cybertechnition)   390K
Vehicular (Ground)            380K
          (Boat)              380K
          (Aircraft)          380K
* - Medicarm (Paramedic) comes with a Medkit built into the arm, as well as
    having medical tools.


 Lurker -
===========
  Essence: 1.75 (Alpha)  [With Vehicle Control Rig, 1]
  Cost: 450K [340K]
 This cyber-arm is all the rage with those who ``just have to know''. With a
small complement of Vehicle Controls (Equivelant to Level 1 VCR's with arm
drone ONLY) and a semi-attached drone, it allows you to see and hear in one
place while actually being in another. The four wheeled drone (3cm x 5cm x
10cm) is connected to the arm by 50 meters of fiber-optic cable (With a
power-reel for those times when you want it back quick), and comes with a
Sensors 1 package standard. The powerpack lasts for 15 minutes of travel or 30
minutes of survailance, and is located in the arm itself. And, due to the
fiberoptics, you need never worry about those jammers which plague most
riggers.

 Speedfeet -
==============
  Essence: .4
  Cost: 50K
 These foot replacements have been used by some of of the most famous
atheletes. With five in-line wheels ready for use at the touch of a button (or
a thought), you can double your effective movment rate over most urban 
terrain.
Great for the athlete wanting to stay in shape, or the bike racer who wants
that extra bit of stability. Bearings should be changed every 30,000 km.


All of thecyberstuff that needs to be recharged will have an internal coil of
two meters of wire and a plug which will draw from household current. You can
operate these from household current without draining the batteries.
