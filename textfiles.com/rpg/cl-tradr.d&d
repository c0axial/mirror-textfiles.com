Subject: The class Dark Sun forgot: The Trader!

Well folx, a while back I pointed out that the trader class was mentioned
in the DS rulebook, but not present.  Well, here it is.  I tried to keep
him in balance with the other classes, and I think you'll find he has a
flavor all his own.  As far as how he might fit into a campaign, well,
he could very well be wanting to establish a mechant house of his own.
 
THE CLASS TSR FORGOT:
 
                    THE TRADER CHARACTER CLASS
 
     The Trader character class is a subclass of the Rogue class.
The trader, like the bard, has a diverse store of abilities.
First and foremost, though, he exists to further his own
pockets.  Traders like to think of themselves as the mainstay of
Athasian society.  They cart goods back and forth over trackless
wastes, hawk there wares in crowded cities, are embroiled in the
politics of trade and survival.
     A trader has a number of prime requisites, because his
foremost, a trader must have a CHA of at least 14 and a DEX and
INT of at least 12.  If all three scores are 16 or higher, the
trader receives a +15% bonus to earned experience.  If just CHA
and INT are 16 or higher, the bonus is +10%.  Additionally, the
trader must have a WIS and CON of at least 10.
     A trader must be of neutral alignment, and also must be
principled or selfish (though the latter is more common.)  For
all intents and purposes, the most common trader alignment is
Lawful-Neutral-Selfish.  Any character class except half-giants,
Muls, and Thri-Kreen may be traders.
     A trader may use the following weapons: dagger, knife,
short-sword, club, hand-crossbow, light crossbow.  A trader may
wear no armour better than leather, and never uses a shield.
     A trader has a small repertoire of theiving skills (base
values in parenthesis): Pick Pockets(10), Hide In Shadows(15),
Detect Noise(10), Read Languages(20).  A trader recieves 10 extra
points at first level, and 15 more points each time he rises in
level.
and x2 damage) when he reaches 3rd level.
     A trader gains the appraise value proficiency for free.
Because he is so adept at business transactions, a trader can
force a protracted barter past the normal three rounds by making
a save versus his charisma at -4.  If he succeeds, the bartering
will continue until he loses a "barter round" -- at that point,
he may try to force another barter-round, but at -6, then at -8,
etc.
     A trader always gains an additional +1 reaction for every
two levels he has attained.
     A trader begins the game with an additional 100gp.
     Like the bard, the trader knows a "little bit about
everything" and has a 5% chance per level know a tidbit of
information: about a locale, people, thing, etc.
     Because of their affinity with people, traders get special
abilities.  A trader begins with 20 points to distribute among
these abilities, and gains another 15 each time he gains a level.
 
detect the ring of untruth about a statement he has just heard.
If the liar is aware of the trader's ability, the trader's
chances are reduced by half.
 
KNOW PERSON: Base 5%.  By scrutinizing a person for at least two
rounds, the trader will notice little hints of the persons
identity.  After the first two rounds, only one bit of
information can be learned for each round.  Applicable
information indicates general class: (spellcaster, priest, rogue,
etc.), general alignment: (Good, Evil, Neutral), general prowess:
(green, experienced, veteran, ultr-powerful).  Specific
information reduces chances by success by half.  This yields a
bit of info of one of the mentioned types, except more specific,
i.e. exact class, alignment, rough idea of level.  Additionally,
the Trader can glean information about the person's occupation,
habitat, etc.
 
FAST TALK: Base 5%.  This allows the trader to convince an
works on NPC's, and then only if the NPC is at least Indifferent.
(Cautious and below incurs penalties).  Basically, this ability
is used to get out of tight situations, stall, etc.  If it
succeeds, the victim will believe the trader for a number of
rounds equal to the trader's IQ minus the victims IQ.  If the
victim's IQ is higher than the trader, the chance of success is
halved, and the victim will beleive (cautiously) for but a single
round.
 
     At 9th level, the trader attracts from 2-20 apprentice
traders.  They are all third level rogues and will serve the
trader for up to a year.  The trader can keep them permanently by
starting a merchant company.

--- If you liked/hated/whatever this class, please let me know.  Oh yeah,
go ahead and pass it out, as long as I get credit for the work I did...
