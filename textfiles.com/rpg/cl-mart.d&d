Martial Artist Kit

Ever since I bought the Complete Fighters Handbook, I had been enticed by the
martial arts additions.  To that end, I created a Fighter Kit for the complete
Martial Artist.

Special Benefits:  Of course, there are the normal benefits for
specialization in weaponless combat.  With the kit, however, the fighter is
allowed to add his Martial Arts bonus (the number of points devoted to the
weapon proficiency after the initial one) to his armor class.  The true martial
artist does not wear armor, but his quick reflexes and defensive training make
him far more difficult to hit.  This bonus may be added to the dexterity bonus
as well, so a fighter using this kit can have a low armor class while wearing
no armor (as such would interfere with his combat style).

Special Restrictions:  In combat, the Martial Artist cannot wear armor
(including helmets and shields, but excluding bracers), cloaks, boots, or
gauntlets (although gloves are acceptable).  He also cannot use weapons in his
off hand, as Martial Arts use both hands and feet.  The DM might also want to
add a code of honor or conduct to these restrictions, as Martial Arts require a
great deal of discipline.

Recommended Proficiencies:  Jumping, Tumbling, and one I created, Anatomy. This
proficiency allows the MA to have specific knowledge about vulnerable points of
the body.  One slot allows the study of one species (or very closely related
ones, such as human, elf, and half-elf.  The same proficiency will not work on
orcs or halflings...they must have their own slots).  When fighting that type
of creature, the MA is allowed +1/slot devoted on the martial arts table.  This
is NOT added to the to hit roll or the damage adjustment...it only increases
the range on the table.  Thus a MA fighting a species with which he is familiar
will be more likely to get a KO (as reflected by the table modification).

All other restrictions for MA apply, including the limitation on initial
proficiency slots.  A fighter may not devote all four slots to  MA.  2 must be
placed on other weapons (I specialized in thrown daggers...a very effective
combination).

I used this kit in a Dark Sun campaign.  It was very effective in a realm where
armor is too hot to wear and metal is so rare.

From: BRUCE NORMAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martial-Priest Kit:
    Starts off with 0 weapon profs.  Three non-weapon
profs.  These profs are restricted because of the time
spent learning martial arts.  Martial priests attack using
the priest THAC0 table, and may make physical attacks with
their hands and feet for greater than normal damage.
Damage against large creatures is at -1.  Damage against
non-human creatures is at -1hp.  Minimum damage from an
attack is 1 hp.  Strength bonuses *do* apply (all this
garbage about strength not mattering when you're punching
or kicking someone is rediculous).
    In additon, knowing martial arts lowers your armor
class.  When fighting someone who is also using martial
arts, knowing martial arts allows you to add a further
bonus of +1 to your AC for ever 3 levels of experience.
Dex bonuses do apply in full when calculating your armor
class.  When wearing armor heavier than leather, no AC
bonus applies (hey, we have to keep these guys from being
too tough :)

    Level       Damage    AC Bonus.
     1-2         1-3         1
     3-4         1-4         2
     5-6         1-4+1       2
     7-8         1-6+1       3
     9-10        1-6+2       3
    11-12        1-8+2       4
    13-15        1-8+3       4
     16+         1-8+4       5

    Other classes: Other classes may use this martial arts system.  It costs
2 weapon profs and one non-weapon prof to "purchase".  Once
purchased, the purchasor uses the table as if he was level
1.  However, the purchases will advance at *double normal
rate* until such time as he "catches up".  Lets give an
example.....
    Boris the mage is 7th level. He did not spend his *innitial* weapon prof
and now gains his second.  He spends both of them, and 1
non-weapon prof, to learn this simple martial arts system.
Boris now attacks using the level 1 table, making one
attack for 1-3 points of damage, and gaining an AC bonus of
1.  Boris gains one level.  He now attacks as using the 3rd
level table, as he is progressing in martial arts at double
normal rate.  When Boris is 13th level he will fight using
the 13th level table, and will have completely "caught up".
 He now progresses *normally*, so at 15th level, he'll
still be in the 13-15 level bracket.
    I realize this martial art is somewhat "boring"
compared to the Oriental- Adventures "Eagles Claw, 3-30hp
of damage" type, but so what? I think its more realistic.

Martial Artist

Ability Requirements: Strength 14
                      Dexterity 14
                      Constitution 11
                      Wisdom 13
Prime Requisites:     Strength, Dexterity
Races Allowed:        Human, Half-elf

Martial Artists are men and women who practice rigorous mental and
physical training and discipline in order to become superior through
the martial arts. There are many ways Martial Artists put their
talents to work; some fight for causes, some act as body-guards, some
just wander from place to place, trying to fit in.

Although there are few examples of Martial Artists of this sort in
medieval history, the Shaolin Monks of China, and the Karate masters
of Japan and Okinawa, are good role models. Caine, from the television
series, ``Kung Fu'' is a Martial Artist.

A Human or a Half-elf can become a Martial Artist. He must have
minimum ability scores of Strength 14, Dexterity 14, Constitution 11,
and Wisdom 13. A Martial Artist with Strength and Dexterity of 16 or
better gains a 10 percent bonus to the experience points he earns.

Martial Artists are masters of armed and unarmed combat. A Martial
Artist may learn to use any weapon, however he must learn the bo staff
before learning others. Since this is the traditionally preferred
weapon of the Martial Artist, he gains a +1 onto his ``to-hit'' rolls
when it is used.

A Martial Artist's empty hand attacks consist of a combination of
kicks and punches. When he fights an opponent more than one and a half
times his size, his open hand attacks do only half damage. Starting at
fourth level, Martial Artists get multiple empty hand attacks. This
differs from other Warriors, who do not get multiple attacks until
seventh level.

A Martial Artist has a special armor class. The armor class represent
the Martial Artist's evading, blocking, and parrying ability. This
only works when the Martial Artist can defend himself and is aware of
the imminent attack. A high dexterity can further improve a Martial
Artist's armor class.

A Martial Artist has the following special benefits:

A Martial Artist can run very fast. The Martial Artist's movement rate
is listed in Experience Table.

A Martial Artist is good at stealth. A Martial Artist has the
following Rogue skills: Move Silently, Hide in Shadows, and Climb
Walls. These skills are listed in Martial Artist Abilities Table.

A Martial Artist has special combat maneuvers. Martial Artists have
combat options not available to other character classes. These are
listed in Manuever Table. Each maneuver uses up one weapon proficiency
slot. The special maneuvers are classifed by the method used and the
difficulty of each maneuver. The lower the number of the maneuver, the
easier it is to perform. When selecting maneuvers from a method, there
must be a progression from 1 on up, i.e. a maneuver can be learned
only when all of the easier ones from that method are known.

A Martial Artist can heal himself. The amount of damage which can be
healed is two hit points per level. This self-healing ability can be
used twice a day, requiring only a moment of concentration, and can
therefore be used without withdrawing from melee.

A Martial Artist can feign death. At fourth level, a Martial Artist
gains the ability to use self-induced catelepsy to appear dead. This
can be done perfectly, as the Martial Artist is able to lower his or
her body temperature and heart rate. The Martial Artist is able to
maintain this state for twice the number of turns as his level. He is
fully aware of his surroundings while in this state and can revive
himself within one turn.

A Martial Artist can use Ki power. At seventh level, the Martial
Artist gains the ability to give a powerful Ki --- a fierce battle cry
that channels the Martial Artist's energy and gives him a +2 bonus to
his strength (e.g. a 17 strength becomes an 18/10) for that round and
a +1 for the next one. A Martial Artist can use this Ki twice a day.
At 17th level, the Ki ability gains the additional effect of the
4th-level Wizard spell, Shout usable once per day.

A Martial Artist has special immunities. At 10th level, the Martial
Artist gains immunity to diseases, haste, and slow spells. At 14th
level, the Martial Artist becomes immune to poisons. At 17th level, he
becomes immune to all mind-controlling spells such as Geas and Quest.

A Martial Artist can attract students. This occurs when the Martial
Artist reaches 10th level. These students have heard of the Martial
Artist's reputation and seek to benefit from his expertise. They will
obey his orders with great loyalty. To attract students, the Martial
Artist must have a school or temple.

A Martial Artist ages slowly for his race. At 12th level, the Martial
Artist enjoys slower aging --- he ages at one half the normal rate for
his race.

A Martial Artist can blur his form in combat. The Martial Artist gains
the ability to Blur, twice a day starting at 13th level, as the
2nd-level Wizard spell.

A Martial Artist can wound and cure with his hands. At 19th level, the
Martial Artist can Cause or Cure Critical Wounds, as the Priest spell,
each usable once per day. No spell casting is required; the Martial
Artist need only touch the recipient for the latter or hit his victim
for the former - in which case, the damage inflicted from the strike
is added to the total.

A Martial Artist has the following restrictions:

A Martial Artist can not wear armor. This includes all armors,
including magical and elven ones.

A Martial Artist must give away part of his treasure. Martial Artists
must tithe 10 of all treasure gained to their home temple, or to
another temple of the same order. Furthermore, Martial Artists may not
own more wealth than that which they can carry with them. Excess money
or equipment must be gotten rid of in any way the Martial Artist deems
fit.

Sweeps: The following is a description of the sweeps. These is a five
percent chance per sweep level of stunning an opponent on a successful
sweep.

Foot Sweep. Using the lead or rear foot, the Martial Artist attempts
to make the opponent fall to the ground. If a successful attack is
made, the opponent must make a successful dexterity fall or the ground
and lose his next round of attacks. Whether or not he makes the check,
he still suffers a penalty of 2 to his armor class for the rest of the
round and the next. In any of the above cases, the Martial Artist
suffers a penalty of 4 to his armor class during the round in which he
makes the sweep.

Scissor Sweep. The Martial Artist drops to the floor, scissoring the
opponent's legs out from under him. If a successful attack is made,
the opponent must make a dexterity check or fall to the ground ---
face up or face down, depending on the Martial Artist's whim. If face
up, the opponent takes 2d4 hit points damage from the fall, but can
fight or get up the next round. If face down, the opponent takes no
damage, but must take an extra round turning over before attempt to
fight or getting up, and additionally suffers a armor class penalty of
2. No matter what happens, the Martial Artist falls to the ground,
too, but in such a way that he sustains no damage.

Drop Sweep. The Martial Artist drops to his hands, and swings his rear
leg around to sweep the opponent's legs out from under him, sending
him crashing to the floor. If the Martial Artist makes a successful
attack at -2 to hit, the opponent falls to the floor and takes 2d4 hit
points of damage. If the monk makes a successful dexterity check ---
whether or not he hits --- he can choose to remain standing after the
maneuver.
