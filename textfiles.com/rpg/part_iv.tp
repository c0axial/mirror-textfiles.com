         Chapter 4:


                             THE TOONPUNK CAMPAIGN


              What's a TOONPUNK game without a TOONPUNK world to 
         attack authority in?  This chapter lists places to go, people 
         to meet, and things to do in Blight City.  This is by no 
         means complete.  If you can think of things to add, go ahead!  
         A good suggestion is to get a "serious" dark future 
         sourcebook and make it silly.


                                 PLACES TO GO

         THE STREET
              The Street is a generic name for any part of Blight City 
         that isn't a Corpdome.  Life in most areas is dull and boring 
         because those areas are where the average citizen lives.  The 
         areas where the Toonpunks live is another story.  _There,_ 
         wacky and wild things are always going on!  The Toonpunks are 
         always partying and goofing around.  Most of them are usually 
         on the run from the Serious Police, too!
              Physically, Blight City bears a strong resemblance to 
         New York City as it might look in 100 years or so (with 
         Corpdomes).  There are lots and lots of tall buildings and 
         mean streets.  Some areas are controlled by Toonpunk gangs 
         like the Savage Grouchos, the New Stooges and the Lords of 
         Comedy.  You run the risk of Falling Down or being Boggled 
         when you enter gang turf.

         THE CORPDOMES
              The Corpdomes are small, safe, clean, _boring_ 
         minicities inside protective domes.  The only people who live 
         there full time are the Corptoons and their families.  All 
         the blue collar workers who work in the factories live 
         _outside_ the domes and are only allowed to enter them to go 
         to work.
              Since all of a Corp's resources are in the domes, they 
         are a prime target of Toonpunk activity.  This can range from 
         just spraypainting funny graffiti on the outside of a dome to 
         actually breaking _into_ a dome for some subversive clowning 
         around.
              Security in the Corpdomes is very tight and completely 
         controlled by the Serious Police.  They are good at what they 
         do -- any Toonpunks who get into a dome will soon be on the 
         run!  The Serious Police will Mindfry any trespassers they 
         catch, and they're rumored to _Zero Out_ the ones who really 
         give them a hard time!
              Some Corps are Skratchanichi, MusiCorp, Daily Midnight 
         News Network, Worknet 32 (XXXII), GloomTech, Network Views 
         42, BiToonica and Krawlin, Toa Hoal, & Dye.

         BARS
              Bars are places where Toonpunks meet, drink Jack Bean 
         Cool-Ade, and exchange information.  Some Bars serve only 
         certain types of patrons, so if you want to meet a Netroamer, 
         go to a Netroamer Bar.  But all Bars have a few things in 
         common, like dark booths, a jukebox playing music (either 
         rock and roll or muzak, depending on the Bar), drinks, a 
         bartender, and, of course, a bar.
              Here are a few Bars in Blight City:

              Gentleman Roamer (Netroamer Bar)
              Aluminum Kennel (Cop Bar)
              Forlorn Joke (Muscleboy Bar)
              The Night Yawn (Corp Bar.... BORING!)
              Zero Down Under (Combat Bar, bring your Smart Gun and 
         cream pies!)
              Hip Hop Bee Bop (Dance Club, but it's still a Bar)

         Drinking
              Toonpunks like to drink.  It makes them silly.  The more 
         a Toonpunk drinks, the sillier he gets.  Each drink has a 
         Sugar Rating (sometimes called "proof").  Every time a 
         Toonpunk drinks, he adds his Sugar Ratings together, and 
         consults the "Toonpunk Drinking Chart" (see p. 00).
              For example, Dixie Scatline drinks a Joka-Cola and a 
         glass of Jack Bean Cool-Ade (he's had a bad day).  That's 9 
         (4 + 5), and now Dixie is acting VERY silly...  He subtracts 
         2 from his Smarts, adds 2 to his Zip and 1 to his Muscle.
              Characters lose one Sugar Rating every 3 minutes (or 
         every 3 actions, whichever the Animator decides).  A few 
         common drinks in Blight City are:

              Water (Sugar Rating 0) - Free
              Terrier (tm) Sugar Water (Sugar Rating 1) - $5 a glass
              Sour Puss (tm) Lemonade (Sugar Rating 2) - $10 a glass
              Diet Popsi (tm) Diet Cola (Sugar Rating 3) - $15 a glass
              Joka-Kola (tm) Cola (Sugar Rating 4) - $25 a glass
              Jack Bean Cool-Ade (tm) Fruit Drink (Sugar Rating 5) -
                   $35 a glass
              Bolt! (tm) Cola... "almost twice the sugar of normal
                  colas!" (Sugar Rating 6) - $50 a glass

                            TOONPUNK DRINKING CHART

         ------------   ------

                        a Sugar Rating of 0.

         Candy
              Besides drinking, most Toonpunks are recreational candy- 
         munchers.  Candy is considered illegal by the Serious Police, 
         because it can lead to outbreaks of fun.  So candy is sold on 
         The Street.  However, here in 2020 1/2, candy is much more 
         refined than its 20th century counterparts, and it has some 
         interesting side effects.  Some of the "goods" currently on 
         The Street are:
              Candy Bar: Increases your Zip by +1 for 3d turns.  One 
         bar is $100.
              Smarties: These colorful little sugar pills will 
         increase your Smarts by +1 for 3d turns.  One package is $100 
         (the whole package must be eaten for the effects to take 
         place).
              Taffee: This multi-colored stretchy stuff will increase 
         Muscle by +1 for 3d turns.  One piece costs $100.
              Licorice: The most sought after candy in Blight City, it 
         can heal lost Hit Points!   Red costs $100 and heals 1d Hit 
         Points, while the rare Black costs $300 and heals 2d!


                       PEOPLE (AND OTHER THINGS) TO MEET

         YUGOTA SKRATCHANICHI
              Head of Skratchanichi Megacorp.  Yugota is a tiger.  He 
         stands over 6 feet tall and always wears expensive black 
         suits.  He is the richest Corptoon in the world and probably 
         the most powerful.  He has _no_ sense of humor at all.  
         Yugota hates Toonpunks -- Netroamers in particular.  He will 
         not rest until the whole world is a serious place.
              BELIEFS & GOALS:  Money and power are the best things in 
         life.  Be serious at all times.  Destroy the Toonpunks and 
         Zero Out _all_ Netroamers!

         DONNA DiDEAD
              Of all the Toonpunks on the Street, Donna is the 
         strangest.  First of all, she's a platypus, which is pretty 
         strange to begin with.  On top of that, she makes herself up 
         to look like a zombie!  She wears ripped up jeans and a shirt 
         with holes in it.  She always carries a laser pistol and a 
         rubber zombie mask in her Back Pocket.
              BELIEFS & GOALS:  Zombies are cool!  Try to look really 
         dead.  See all the zombie movies you can.  Down with Corp 
         rule!  Be loyal to your friends.

         and replaces cyberware.  He is absent-minded and a bit 
         accident-prone.  Dr. Nicewrench is a fox, who stands 6 feet 
         tall and wears a lab jacket over a T-shirt and white pants.  
         His hair is red and frizzy.
              BELIEFS & GOALS:  Give the customers good service and 
         they'll come back -- especially if you charge less than the 
         competition!  Try out new ways of building or fixing things.  
         Don't break expensive tools!  Oops!  Ouch!  Try not to hurt

         FLOYD BLINKINGCHIP
              Floyd is an intelligent young woodchuck.  He is 4 feet 
         tall and likes to wear bright Hawaiian shirts.  His hair is 
         cut short and he wears an earring in his left ear.  Floyd is 
         a Netroamer.  A very good Netroamer.  He loves to set up 
         elaborate practical joke programs, especially in the 
         Corporate Security areas of cyberspace.  Unfortunately, this 
         means that Floyd is wanted by all the big Corps for Netcrime.  
         Of course, they still have to catch him.  Floyd uses a Mark 
         IV cyberdeck.  He prefers to take Bogglegrams into cyberspace 
         with him.
              BELIEFS & GOALS: Netroaming is fun, but playing jokes on 
         the Corps is more fun!  Never go into the Net unprepared.  
         Always try to look cool.  Watch out for Cops, the Serious 
         Police and other enemies.

         COMMANDER GLUMM
              Commander Glumm is leader of the Serious Police.  He is 
         a big, tough, serious-looking Doberman Pinscher.  He always 
         wears body armor and carries a depression dart gun -- anybody 
         he hits must roll vs. Chutzpah or be depressed for 1d turns.  
         He has very few weaknesses, but the worst one is the fact 
         that he can be Boggled on a roll of 5 or less.  If any 
         Toonpunks found _that_ out, Glumm would put them at the top 
         of his "seek and depress" list.  Commander Glumm has a deep 
         voice and growls when he is mad.
              BELIEFS & GOALS: Toonpunks are the enemies of society 
         and I will not tolerate their antics!  Always follow rules 
         and regulations.  _Don't get Boggled!_  Always wear your body 
         armor.  Exercise every day.

         "ROCKIN' RAUL" MEWZIK
              "Rockin' Raul" is the number one enemy of MusiCorp, the 
         corporation that has cornered the market on elevator music.  
         Raul has managed to get hold of programs that let him take 
         over the airwaves and play Rock & Roll.  Toonpunks love him 
         and the Corps want him switched off permanently.  Raul is a 
         parrot who dresses in flashy sequined outfits.  He wears his 
         hair (feathers?) short and spiky.  He's about 5 feet tall.  
         Raul always carries a laser pistol and his feet are equipped 
         with jetskates.
              BELIEFS & GOALS: Always be outrageous!  Rock & Roll will 
         never die!  Do everything you can to mess with MusiCorp.  Try 
         not to wear the same outfit twice!  Always be ready for a 
         fight or a joke!

         MAX PLAYROOM
              Max is an AI prgram with a computer-generated face!  He 
         can only be seen on vidscreens and in cyberspace. What's 
         more, when he appears on a vidscreen, the terminal animates, 
         sprouting arms and legs, and Max walks around.  He can change 
         his shape to look like any sort of machine.  If he Falls 
         Down, the terminal is smashed, but Max doesn't care -- 3 
         minutes later he appears on another one.  Max looks like a 
         cat in dark glasses and a black-and-white striped suit.  His 
         best friend is Floyd Blinkingchip, who created him.  Although 
         he is Corporate Enemy Number One, Max has the highest ratings 
         on the vidnets.  Max can appear anywhere in cyberspace that 
         isn't too well-protected.  All his attributes and shticks are 
         subroutines in his very complex self-actualization program.
              BELIEFS & GOALS:  Being an AI is fun!  So is breaking 
         into the Corporate vidcasts and setting up jokes in 
         cyberspace!  Keep moving around the channels and the Corps 
         will _never_ catch you.  Help Floyd and his friends however 
         you can.  Be friendly and witty, even to the Serious Police.

                                 THINGS TO DO

         NEUROPRANKSTER
              Someone has found a way to brainwash Netroamers into 
         doing silly, dangerous or embarrassing things.  Sounds like 
         fun!  So now you want to find out who this guy is and learn 
         his tricks.  Will you go into cyberspace after him, or will 
         you look for him on the Street?  And what will you do if he 
         finds _you_ first?

         COUNT ME ZEROED
              Crazy Eddie, the wackiest Toonpunk in Blight City, has 
         been Zeroed Out!  But just before he went Gloomy, he left a 
         note "Gloomtech... Big Zero Project... corned beef on rye, no 
         mayo."  What could it possibly mean?  Looks like a trip into 
         the Gloomtech Corpdome is in order!

         FRIDAY NIGHT PIE FIGHTS
              There's trouble brewing on The Street!  It seems that 
         two laughgangs, the Savage Grouchos and the New Stooges, had 
         an arguement about who invented the joy buzzer and now 
         they're going to settle matters!  Before the night is over, 
         the Streets will run sticky with cream pie filling.

         AI-YI-YI!
              When your computer-generated pal, Max Playroom, tells 
         you about a secret land of outlaw AIs, you are amazed!  When 
         he tells you that they want to learn all about humor and fun, 
         you're _Boggled!_  But when he tells you he wants to _take 
         you there_...

         HAYWIRED
              Your hearty little band of Toonpunks has had years of 
         experience breaking into Corpdomes and Corp databases, but 
         now, things are different.  You're deep inside the 
         Skratchanichi and the Serious Police are hot on your trail!  
         This time, you have to break out!  Can your pals in 
         cyberspace do anything to help you?  Maybe, but only if they 
         can avoid the newly-created hunter/boggler program code-
         named _Toonstalker_.

         ARCADE RUNNER
              You thought your laughing days were over when the 
         Serious Police grabbed you, but instead of Zeroing you out, 
         they offered you a deal.  All you have to do is find out what 
         made three former S.P. officers become Toonpunks and why they 
         have started substituting arcade game programs for Youth 
         Indoctrination Lessons.
