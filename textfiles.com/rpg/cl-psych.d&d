Racial bonuses are expressed through ability scores.
Note that only elves might be able to wear elven chain.
When making the character, allow the player to distribute 10% points as he/she
wishes.  Every level adds an additional 10% to distribute.
It is possible, but unlikely, to get higher that 100% in a category.
 
Ability description:
 
PK: Mind over matter, expressing itself as the simple levitation and manipulati
on of objects.  The strength and dexterity of these manipulations is calculated
by dividing the percentage by 4.  Optionally, the strength and dexterity may be
 separate categories.  Many psychics use this skill to wield weapons in combat,
 however this requires a separate profiency slot, in addition to being able to
fight by hand.  It is possble to design weapons which can only be used psychica
lly, such as the glaive from the movie Krull.
Pyrokinesis also falls under this heading as follows:
 
5-10% can light a candle within 20'
11-25% can light a torch within 20'
26-50% can light a fire within 20'
51-75% can create small explosions (3d6)
76-100% did you ever see Firestarter?
 
Psychometry: the ability to sense the past history of an object or area. Physic
al contact is required for an object, presence only for an area. Recent impress
ion can drown out older ones.
 
5-10% 1 day or less
11-25% 1 month
26-50% 1 year
51-75% 10 years
75-100% 100 years
 
 
Precognition:  Visions of the future.  The possible futures are all visible, bu
t the more likely futures come in clearer.  Range improves with skill, but perc
entage of success is rather low. [translation, did you guess right?].  For some
 unknown reason, it is impossible to see your own death. Range is as in psychom
etry, but reversed [naturally].
 
Clairsentience: The ability to sense without using the physical senses.  Howeve
r, it is not possible to just choose a location.  It is necessary to "pan" over
to it.  applications include 360 degree vision, blindfold vision,  etc.  If the
 player has been blinded, struck deaf, etc. this  will restore the damaged sens
e.  If the sense was damaged from birth, no repair is possible.  Sight attacks,
 sound based attacks, etc. may work, at the DM's discretion [I'd say yes].
 
5-10% 1/4 mile radius
11-25  1 mile radius
26-50  100 mile radius
51-75  Planetary [assuming planet based cosmology]
76-100 Planar
 
[if sight attacks work, it may also be of use to allow psychic abilities to fun
ction, at 1/2 strength, in the area under scrutiny]
 
TP: a spectrum of abilities, including empathy, ESP, brainwashing, and possessi
on.
 
5-10% can sense emotions in 20' radius
11-20% can project emotions in 20', sense in 40'
21-30% can read surface thoughts in 20', project in 40', sense in 80'
31-40% can read "private" thoughts in 20', surface thoughts in 40' etc
41-50% can project thoughts in 20'
51-60% can plant a suggestion [as per spell] in 20'
61-70% can control inactive muscles in 20'
71-80% can force a conscious act in 20'
81-90% can completely control another mind in 20'
91-100% can possess another body in 20'
 
The number of people affected by an ability is equal to the maxium radius divid
ed by the actual radius affected.  Thus a radius of 160' means that the skill c
an affect 8 people in 20', 4 people in 40', 2 in 80', but only one in 160'.
 
As this is the only skill which directly affects another person, there is a sav
ing throw v. charm.  Calculate the TD ( telepathy difference) by subtracting th
e psychic's intelligence from the target intelligence, and use the following ta
ble.
 
TD    Modifier
-22_-16   Automatic fail
-15_-9    -10
-8_-6     -5
-5_-4     -2
-3_-1     -1
 0         0
1-3       +1
4-5       +2
6-8       +5
9-15      +10
 
 
Duration: The abilities can be used for 1 round per level, plus the following
Constitution bonuses:
 
CON 10-12  none
    13-15  1 round
    16-18  5 rounds
    19-25  10 rounds
 
After this the character loses one HP per SEGMENT, until either he stops using
the ability, or reaches 0HP.  If he stops, the HP drain stops.  If he reaches 0
HP, he falls unconscious, and loses no more HP.   The abilities will not functi
on for one day afterward. However, the HP lost in this fashion can be regained
at the same rate by resting the required time, [1 round per 6hp]. In addition
one round of rest allows for one regained round of ability, up to the current m
aximum.
 
Terrain modifiers:  These abilities work by tapping life energy, so the amount
of living matter [ie terrain] affects the skills.
 
Desert, Mountain, Arctic: all abilities at 1/2 percentage
Steppe, Farmland, Village: standard
Forest: all abilities at 3/2x
Jungle: double
Deep sea, underground: 3/4x
Offcoast: use terrain at coast
Midair [altitude greater than 1 mile], space: 1/4X
 
Optional rules:
 
1) Magic detection in 20' radius, due to sensitivity.  Only strength, not type
of magic.
 
2) Healing: Can heal another at 1 HP per round, by directly feeding life energy
 
3) Life draining: Reverse of ability 2.  Don't tell the player he can do this,
let him figure it out on his own.  This will cause the player to show up as evi
l in a detect evil spell.
 
4) Psychic combat: Telepathy war.  First person to fail saving throw loses.
 
Possible multiclasses include psychic/fighter and psychic/thief.  Spell use, an
d any magic item that affects the body [ie ring of etherealness] is not possibl
e, ever.
 
OK there it is.  Let me know what you think.
