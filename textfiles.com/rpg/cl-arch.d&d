1.
The ARCHER
by 
Lenard Lakofka
    Those who are familiar with the Errol Flynn movie Robin Hood may recall a
    scene where when he kills five men-at -arms with single arrow shots, all
    within one minute (I've timed some of the missle-firing scenes ). We have
    all seen some movies in which the bow (usually the long bow) is
    fantastically accurate and deadly. This pre-conditioning, if you will,
    confuses many a new player of the D&D or AD&D game. The novice might give
    up if the leader of a group of orcs shouts out to his troops, "Stand and
    deliver!" because the player has a fear of the bow. On the other hand, the
    party might refrain from missle fire for the opposite reason: Most monsters
    met in an encounter cannot be killed by a single arrow. Are, or were,
    archers really as good as they are sometimes portrayed to be? In fact, an
    English longbowman could hit and kill a figure at a range of 400 yards!
    This was, however, the rare shot and not the rule. That fact is based on
    fire into a group of figures  and rarely, if ever was such a feat achieved
    by a single shot at a lone target. The maximum longbow range in the game is
    21 inches, which equates to 630 feet outdoors - a mere 210 yards. How can
    this apparant inequity be taken care of? Well, it cannot without
    unbalancing the game. Remember that movement and spell range, say nothing
    of spell casting time, is tied to selecting distances. If bow range is
    tampered with, it will throw off the other numbers. However in the archer
    and archer-ranger subclass (described hereafter), some increase in range
    is allowed for strong characters.

A new NPC class: Archers and Archer-Rangers
    The principle attributes  of an archer are strength and dexterity, both of
    which must be 15 or better. Intelligence, wisdom, and charisma must all be
    at least 6, and constitution at least 9.Archer-rangers require even higher
    intelligence, wisdom, and constitution - a minimum  of 14 in each. Archers
    and archer - rangers whose strength and dexterity are both 16 or better
    gain 10% to earned experience.
    While archers may be of any alignment, archer-rangers must be good, just
    as rangers.
    Archers can be human, elf, half-elf, or half-orc as well as some other
    humanoid races.  Humanoids are limited in level as an archer as follows:
    Orcs can become 3rd level archers, gnolls can become 5th level archers,
    and hobgoblins can become 4th level archers. Kobolds, goblins, dwarves,
    gnomes, and halflings can not become archers. Only humans and half-elfs
    can become archer-rangers. Archer-rangers can be humans or half-elf.
    Archers and archer - rangers use 8 - sided dice for determination of hit
    points. At first level, two 8-sided dice are thrown, just as for the
    ranger class. All archers add 2 hit points per level after the 9th level.
    All archers may use a wide selection of armor, but the use of plate armor
    will negate an archer's "to hit" bonuses, and thus he will surely decline
    to use this type of armor. A shield can be carried, but obviously it must
    be set aside when arrows are fired.
    Archers have a great selection of weapons available, but this selection is
    not as broad as that of a fighter. They may use, in addition to their long/
    composite/ great bow, the following weapons: swords of any type, dagger,
    axes of any type, spear or javelin, darts or scimitar. Archers rarely use
    blunt weapons like a mace, hammer , or flail. Archers do not use pole arms
    except for the throwing spear. It is very rare for an archer to use a short
    bow or any type of cross bow. Archers gain no bonuses to hit or damage when
    using these latter missle weapons.
    Archers and archer - rangers have the same saving throws as fighters. They
    melee on the fighter table. All archers begin with only two weapons, a bow
    and almost always some type of sword. Thereafter they may add one weapon
    for every three levels attained, just as other fighter classes do. However,
    their non-proficiency penalty is -3. All archers can make only one
    hand-to-hand melee attack per round through the 8th level. At 9th through
    15th level, they can strike three times in two rounds. They gain two
    attacks per round only at 16th level and higher. At 7th level and above,
    archers can fire three arrows per round instead of just two. All archers
    can employ those magical items usable by all classes plus many other items
    as well. A magic bow and/or magic arrow operates at +1 in an archers hands,
    over and above any magical bonuses to hit and/or damage  it may already
    have. However, elven archers do not gain this +1 to hit with a long bow
    because of their smaller than human size.
    At 9th level, an archer can establish a freehold just as a fighter can
    (see Players Handbook, page 22). However, archer-rangers cannot build such
    a freehold (PH, page 25).
    The following applies only to archer - rangers. In melee, acher - rangers
    gain +1 to damage vs "giant class" creatures, just as rangers do. An archer
    - ranger is as stealthy as a ranger and is able to track like a ranger
    does. An archer - ranger attracks a body of 2-24 followers, just as a
    ranger does.  However, archer -rangers only gain druid spells, except for
    some very specific magic-user spells outlined hereafter for both archer -
    rangers and archers.  Druid spells are gained at the 8th level and follow
    the chart given for rangers. An archer - ranger does not gain any special
    advantage from non-written magic items pertaining to clairaudience, ESP,
    and telephathy, such as a ranger can.
    All archers can learn some specific magic-user spells, but to do this
    intelligence must be 9 or higher. When the spell is to be taught by a
    magic-user, the archer must check to see if he can learn it, as if he were
    a magic user. Failure to succeed on this check forever negates that
    particular spell. Archers cannot read spells from scrolls in any case, and
    neither can they pen their own spells.
    Archers may use particular spells beginning at the 7th level of ability.
    The number of spells usuable and the list from which the archer may choose
    changes as the archers level increases:
Level	# of spells	
of Archer	usuable	Which spells possible
7th-8th	1	Magic missle, shield
9th-10th	2	Strength,mirror image  plus above
11th-12th   3   Flame arrow, protection from normal missles,  plus above.
13th and up 4   Enchanted weapon  (bows & arrows only) plus above
    At 3rd level any archer can make arrows for his bow, assuming the proper
    raw material is obtained. He can craft a dozen arrows in an 8 hour day. At
    5th level any archer can make a long, composite, or great bow. This process
    takes 9-14 days  and also assumes proper materials are at hand. A crude bow
    that is -2 to hit and from which the archer gains no bonuses whatsoever can
    be crafted in less than an hour.
    An archers major attribute is an enhanced ability to hit and damage a
    target with bow and arrow. This bonus applies only if an archer is not
    wearing plate armor, as previously noted. He  must be using a well-made
    bow and well-crafted arrows. The bonus applies to any target of human size,
    and may be further modified upward or downward depending on the target size
    and relative motion of archer and target (see preceeding discussion) .  The
    bonuses to hit and to damage must be awarded at each level promotion the
    archer. Remember also that a +1 bow is +2 in the hands of an archer, over
    and above any bonus given here. The same "extra +1" is true of arrows.
    Archers use the range of "point blank" in addition to the short / medium
    / long ranges for most missles. For an archer, point-blank range is from
    10 to 50 feet. Other ranges remain the same. (Hereafter are given range
    changes for exceptionally strong characters, which may be used for archers
    at the DM's option.)
    Note: the bonus to hit / damage given below do not  include the -2 and -5
    adjustments to armor class must always be applied at medium and long range,
    respectively.

Bonus to hit / damage at the range given:
Archer	Point-blank	Short	Medium	Long
level	Hit	Dam.	Hit	Dam.	Hit	Dam.	Hit	Dam.
1	+1
2	+1	+1	+1
3	+2	+1	+1	+1
4	+2	+2	+1	+1	+1
5	+3	+2	+2	+1	+1	+1
6	+3	+3	+2	+2	+1	+1	+1
7	+4	+3	+3	+2	+2	+1	+1	
8	+4	+4	+3	+3	+2	+2	+1	+1
9	+5	+4	+4	+3	+3	+2	+2	+1
10	+5	+5	+4	+4	+3	+3	+2	+2

12	+6	+6	+5	+5	+4	+4	+3	+2
13	+7	+6	+6	+5	+5	+4	+3	+2
14 and up	+7	+7	+6	+6	+5	+5	+4	+4

    No matter how well an archer is capable of shooting, a roll of 1 on the
    "to hit" die is always a miss. (Normal missle-firing troops always miss
    on a 1 or 2.) As an example of how to use the above chart, a 7th-level
    archer with a +1 bow firing a +2 arrow at point-blank range would have
    these bonuses to hit and damage: +1 for the bow and +1 more because an
    archer is firing it; +2 for the arrow and +1 more because an archer is
    firing it; plus +4 to hit due to skill and +3 damage due to skill at point
    blank range, for an overall bonus of +9 to hit and +8 damage!
    All archers, and optionally any trained figure with a long, composite, or
    great bow, can also do extra damage and gain greater accuracy through use
    of physical strength. This can only be accomplished by the use of specially
    made bows and arrows with a greater "pull." Normal bows and arrows cannot
    be used, nor can any short bows or any type of crossbow. Such a bow must
    be crafted by an archer, an archer-ranger, or an elf bowmaker who is at
    least 6th level as an archer or a fighter. Proper "long arrows" must be
    crafted by an archer, an archer-ranger, or an elf fletcher of at least 4th
    level. Ordinary fletchers can only make normal arrows.
    The strength bonuses apply to point-blank range and short range only. Full
    strength bonuses as given in the Players Handbook will apply;  +3 to hit
    and +6 to damage is the maximum bonus allowed due to strength. Girdles of
    strength  will not provide a further bonus for this purpose. At short
    range, the bonus to hit and damage is halved from the ammount of the bonus
    at point-blank range (fractions are dropped). This bonus for strength is
    in addition to an archers bonus for skill.
    The strength of an archer or archer-ranger may also allow for an expansion
    of of the long- range end of a bow's potential. Only specially made bows
    will give greater range. Only the top end of the long-range category is
    expanded. Medium range distance stays the same as given in the Players
    Handbook. Given below are ranges for each type of bow allowed to an archer,
    archer-ranger, or strong fighter according to the strength of the
    character. Remember, the bows and arrows must be special.

	Point			Long	Long	Great
Strength 	blank	Short	Medium	comp.	bow	bow
9-15	10-50	51-210	211-420	421-630	421-630	421-630

18/51-75		in		421-650	421-680	421-660

18/00				421-670	421-720	421-660


    Only archers and archer rangers who reach 8th level or above can craft
    arrows that can later be magicked to become arrows of slaying. The magic
    must be accomplished by a magic-user the following spells: enchant an item,
    wish, and trap the soul. Fresh blood from the figure type to be slain must
    be available. Thus, it is virtually impossible to craft an arrow for use
    against a unique character like Bahamut, Tiamat, or a deity or demi-god.

    It is not uncommon for archer-rangers to have a double title, like
    Fletcher-Scout, or Ranger-Archer. Note that the ranger class title is
    given first. Any individual might only state part of his title.  Note that
    the experience points necessary for each level are the same for archer or
    archer-ranger.
    (By the way, Errol Flynn's Robin Hood  was an Archer Grandmaster and not a
    thief of any type. Consider Flynn's statistics as follows: Str 16, Int 17,
    Wis 15, Dex 18, Con 18, Cha 17; 14th- level Archer Grandmaster; leather
    armor+2 for AC 6; HP 110; long sword +2, long bow +3.)

2.
                        THE ARCHER CLASS
                       
          The  Archer's main attribute is enhanced 'to-hits' 
    and  damage to distant targets with their various  forms 
    of specialized bows.  
          To  become  an  Archer,  a character must  have  a 
    strength and dexterity of at least 15, a constitution of 
    9,  and  at  least a  6  in  intelligence,  wisdom,  and 
    charisma.
          A  minimum  height  of  5 feet 5  inches  tall  is 
    required  because  of  the size and power  of  the  bows 
    employed.   If a character possesses both a 16  strength 
    and   dexterity  he/she  is  entitled  to  +10%   earned 
    experience.
          Archers may be human,  half-elf,  elven,  or half-
    orc.  The  height limitation may prevent most elves from 
    becoming Archers of this type.   Non-humans are  limited 
    to  8th level of experience;  9th level if they  possess 
    both an 18 strength and dexterity.  Elves tall enough to 
    fit  the class who possess and 18 strength and dexterity 
    may progress to the 13th level of ability.
          The  classes which may double or multi-class  with 
    the Archer are the Ranger,  Magic-user, and illusionist.              
    Archers may be of any alignment, but Archer-rangers must 
    be  of good alignment.   After 5th level no more than  2 
    Archers will work together in the same group.
          Archers use the fighter tables for 'to-hits',  but 
    begin  with  only two weapons:  A bow of some  kind  and 
    normally  a  sword.   Thereafter they become  proficient 
    with  one new weapon each 3rd level.   The  Archer  non-
    proficiency  penalty  is -3.   At 7th level Archers  may 
    shoot  3  arrows per round,  and 4 arrows per  round  at 
    15th.  At 8th level Archers get 3 attacks every 2 rounds 
    with hand held weapons, at 15th they can attack twice in 
    every round in hand-to-hand combat.
          Archers  may  use  any  type  of  armor,   however 
    platemail negates their skill and damage  bonuses.   The 
    weapons  Archers  can  use  are:   Bows,  dagger,  dart, 
    javelin,  spear, any type of sword or axe.  They may (if 
    rarely) use short-bows, crossbows, or blunt weapons.  At 
    9th level Archers my build freeholds like fighters.
          Archers  may  employ  any magic  items  usable  by 
    fighters,   At 7th level they may begin to learn certain 
    mage  spells  if their intelligence is 9 or  more.   The 
    spells  must  be taught to the Archer by a  mage  or  by 
    studying  a copy.   Archers cannot write scrolls nor can 
    they cast from them.
          Archer-rangers  can  gain spells from  the  Archer 
    chart in place of their normal magic-user  spells.   The 
    appropriate  levels  of  spells equaling  gained  Archer 
    specialty spells.
          Double or multi-classed Archers DO NOT gain Archer 
    spells in addition,  only in substitution for spells  of 
    the  same  level  that the character  may  have  already 
    learned.

                      FLETCHER CRAFTS

          THIRD LEVEL:
          Archers  gain  the ability to make 12 arrows in  8 
    hours.
          Archers also gain the ability to fashion any  type 
    of bow except crossbow in 9-14 days (8+1d6).
          FOURTH LEVEL:
          Archers  learn to fashion "long-arrows",  12 in  8 
    hours.
          FIFTH LEVEL:
          Archers learn to fashion Arch-bows.  These take 26 
    to 35 days to make (25 + 1d10).
          THIRTEENTH LEVEL:
          Arch-bows  created by Archers of this level can be 
    magicked  by a mage into a strongbow.   70 days time  is 
    required to fashion such a bow.

                    BOW & ARROW DESCRIPTIONS

          "Long-arrows"  are  arrows of greater  length  and 
    larger  feathering designed specifically for long  range  
    shots.  These kind of arrows are required for all Archer 
    LONG-RANGE shots.

          Listed are the three bows most used by Archers.

          LONGBOW:   This is a bow of standard type utilized 
    by adventurers.

          COMPOSITE  LONGBOW:   This  bow  is used  for  its 
    harder  hitting  power  at  short  ranges  and   greater 
    accuracy.

          GREATBOW:  These are very large longbows which can 
    be  fashioned to an individuals strength  (personalized) 
    to give greater damage.  A 5'8" height is required as is 
    a minimum strength of 16 to use these bows properly.

                SPECIAL & MAGICAL ARCHER ITEMRY

          THE ARCHBOW:
          These   are  bows  crafted  for  great  range  and 
    accuracy,  and  greater hitting power at  short  ranges.  
    When firing at point blank range,  strength bonuses 'to-
    hit'  and damage are added.   At short ranges,  the same 
    pluses are halved and fractions dropped.   Greatbows  of 
    the  arch-bow  type  can be fashioned to  give  strength 
    bonuses  at  point-blank and short-ranges  with  bonuses 
    being halved at medium range.   A height of 5'8" and  16 
    strength   are  needed  to  pull  a  standard   Archbow; 
    Greatbows  require a height of 6'0" and a 17 strength to 
    pull.   The maximum strength bonus applicable with these 
    bows is +3 'to-hit' and +6 damage.


          STRONGBOWS:
          These  are powerful magic bows which give strength 
    'to-hit' and damage bonuses at ALL ranges.   These  bows 
    are  the only type of bow which can give giant  strength 
    'to-hit' and damage bonuses.  A height of 6'0" and an 18 
    strength  are required to pull a standard strongbow.   A 
    height of 6'0" and a 20 strength (stone-giant belt)  are 
    required  to utilize a great strongbow.   These bows are 
    reputed  to combine the bonuses 'to-hit' and damage  for 
    gauntlets  of ogre power and belts of giant strength  as 
    does a hammer of thunderbolts c.f.

          MAGIC BOWS & ARROWS:
          Magical  bows  function as a great arch-bow in  an 
    Archers hands,  adding their magical pluses 'to-hit' and 
    to damage at short and point-blank ranges because of  an 
    Archers  ability  to make better use of the bows  magic.  
    Magic arrows shot by an Archer have 16% better chance of 
    surviving unbroken.   Magic arrows can be fired at  long 
    ranges the same way a "long-arrow" can be fired.
