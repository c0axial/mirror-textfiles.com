                       ALTERNATE MAGIC SYSTEM SUPPLEMENT

	This is a supplement to  the  Spellweaving  System.  It  can  be  used  in
conjunction with the Spellweaving System, or with  the  standard  AD&D  magic
system. The original idea came from a Tortured Souls magazine (Great magazine
to buy if you can find it). It involves the notion that there are centers  of
magic, magical sources if you will, around  the  campaign  world  or  playing
area. Note that this is for spells and not magical  items,  although  the  DM
might rule that these modifiers effect the creation of magical items in  some
way.
	The modifiers should not be told to the players in advance, but should  be
discovered by them during the course of play; this reflects  the  acquisition
of similar knowledge by their characters. If the DM thinks that it  would  be
common knowledge, for mages and priests, where the centers are, then so be it.




	There are several general categories of spells, these are:

 1. Elemental spells eg. Gust of Wind, Wall of  Iron,  Fireball,  Fog  Cloud.
    These will typically have centers  as  such:  Air  elemental:  some  tall
    mountain range, Earth elemental: some rugged  mountain  range,  the  sort
    that dwarves love, or a canyon, Fire elemental: some great desert.  Water
    elemental: the ocean, or the largest ocean around. These are better to be
    in the four corners of the playing world, but it is not necessary.

 2. Nature spells eg. Charm Plants, Weather Summoning, Warp Wood, etc.  These
    are druid type spells that call upon the forces of nature  in  some  way.
    The typical place for the source of nature would be in the  middle  of  a
    huge forest.

 3. Divination spells eg. augury, detect magic, etc. This effects priests and
    not mages, since it depends on where the god or his/her holy  city/temple
    etc. is.  The  source  of  the  magic  comes  from  here  in  this  case.
    Alternatively this can effect mages with regards to the information being
    divined eg. If a mage is doing a detect magic on a Flame Tongue, he would
    receive the same modifier as a Fire elemental spell.

 4. Illusion spells eg. Shadow Magic, Phantasmal Force etc. The center of the
    source of illusionary magic is the place in the playing world where  most
    of the intelligence is. This is  generally  the  capital  city,  or  more
    generally the city with greatest population.

 5. Other spell types. With regards to anti-magic, the defence against magic,
    the modifier will change in sign, since it will be easier  to  dispel  or
    defend against against a source of magic which is far away, and harder to
    defend against a source of magic which is near. eg. if the spell Wall  of
    Iron is in the area which gives it  +3  modifier,  there  will  be  a  -3
    modifier for anyone trying to dispel it. With regards to spells that  are
    related to another spell type eg. Wish,  Glyph  of  Warding,  Permanency,
    Nystul's Magical Aura etc. treat them as the appropriate spell type.

    Any others: either no modifier, or use your judgement.

Remember that these are only suggestions.

Distance From Magic Source: This is best done from the  map  of  the  playing
world. An alternative to the distances given above, if your playing world  is
a lot smaller or larger, is to divide the length of the playing area by about
15 and use this figure instead of the jumps of 1000 miles.
Another method is to use the  above  distances  informally  (eg.  within  the
elvin forest the modifiers are +2 for a certain magic type, etc.) This  eases
the use in campaign worlds.

Modifiers For Supplement: If you are using  the  Spellweaver  System  I  have
offered in a  seperate  article,  then  these  are  the  modifiers  added  or
subtracted when finding out the spell's effect.

Modifiers On Own: If this system is used on it's  own,  then  these  are  the
modifiers used. If there is damage or healing involved, then the modifier  is
applied to this. If it is a divination spell, then this is the chance  of  it
not working (if negative), roll this chance again, and get false information.
If it is a positive modifier to divination spells then  you  can  either  get
that percentage in extra info, or similar.
Other spells can have, duration, area of effect, or range effected,  or  even
the chance of the spell working at all. This is up to the DM.

Magic Items: These modifiers will affect all spells, whether they  come  from
scrolls or come from a magical item that gave the user the  spell  use.  This
is the only way in which magic items will be affected.


   This system will tend to bog down  spell  use  a  bit,  but  will  make  a
campaign more fun and will give a fresh aproach to magic in  AD&D.  Hope  you
enjoy.
