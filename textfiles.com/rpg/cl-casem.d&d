This is to everyone who says "I want a fighter who can pick locks."
    Caseman [New Character Class]

          The caseman is a specialized Fighter character class.  They are
exactly like the fighter class, except they have the ability to Open Locks.
The name "Caseman" is used so that they don't get confused with the thief kit,
"burgurlar."

          Caseman comes from the term "casing" a joint.  They can use any
weapon, wear any type of armor, use d10 for hit points, use fighter's THAC0
table and saving throws.  They gain the additional hp for Con bonus as per the
fighters, and also can have exceptional [18/??] Strength.  They can be any
race, with non-human level limitations as per the Fighter class.
