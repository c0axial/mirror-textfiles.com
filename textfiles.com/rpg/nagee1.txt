Welcome to the First Annual Neo-Anarchists Guide to Everything Else. If 
we're lucky, this will be a semi-regular electronically-distributed 
magazine devoted to FASA's Shadowrun¨ role-playing game. In the NAGEE, 
we'll be covering everything else. Everything that our contributors feel 
should have been covered, but wasn't. And, just things that look nice, 
'cause looking good is the only way to go.

If you'd like to contribute, here's the kind of stuff we're looking for:
     1) Area Descriptions
     2) Adventures
     3) Fiction
     4) Spells
     5) Spirits
     6) Cyberware, Weapons, and Equipment
     7) Creatures
     8) Reviews
     9) Everything Else

Take a look at this issue for an example. If you see something that 
inspires you, send us your inspiration. If you see something that's 
missing, send us that as well. If you have no idea what to write about, 
describe your home town as it will exist in the year 2050, after the 
awakening. Or write a story about one of your characters' adventures. 
Or, just sit back and read. They also serve who just chip in.
Tell us what you think about the articles, as well. If we get letters, 
we'll print them, just like a real magazine. Heck, you can even send 
them in shadowtalk.

By the way, this Guide comes in two versions -- Rich Text Format (for 
Word 4.0 and other word processors) and an ascii text version. The ascii 
version contains the same information as the Word version, but doesn't 
look nearly as spiffy. If you don't have a friend with a Macintosh and 
Word 4.0 (or higher), expand your circle of friends: contacts are, after 
all, the key to survival.

Many thanks to all those who have contributed to this issue.

Subject: Orichalum Cyberarms

How 'bout this one... to ponder, there are no real rules in this one, 
merely an idea.

The Orichalum Cyberarm... Ideal for punching, plus a good focus as 
well... Mind you, the mage using this does lose a point of essence, but 
the fact that there is a focus involved does compensate. Cost is the 
usual... Cyberarm cost+(rating x 300,000); A bit steep, but when you 
consider the possibilities (orichalum spurs, razors, etc.) it works out.
I doubt Orichalum Decks would be useful (magic and VR doesn't mix at 
all!) and vehicles are right out.

A little background...I ran into a CorpMage with one of these. Dear ol' 
Max Overload (El Rigger Mejor, c'est moi) hit him with a panzer. Just 
cuz you're magic don't mean you're invulnerable to tech.

Subject: BloodRunners

Somewhere in California (any place, really) there is a growing gang 
called the BloodRunners. Even for a Sprawl Gang they are vicious and 
cruel. They are all of mixed race, creed, and subspecies, but they all 
share a common bond. Anger and hate. Their leadership are mostly 
Vampiric, and most underlings are not, but (when they prove themselves) 
are infected as they rise in rank. The Yaks are using them more and more 
often as hit teams or enforcers (since they are rather effective), and 
the Seolpa Rings are beginning to realize their potential as well. Both 
are actively employing the BloodRunners for various jobs, although each 
are unaware of the others presence. The BloodRunners don't dress like a 
gang, they all wear normal clothing (so as not to make them easily 
distinguishable), however, they do all wear black silk shirts so they 
can recognize each other.

The BloodRunners are extremely dangerous... Not to be taken lightly. If 
ever confronted, pray. Some of us carry silver crosses for that purpose. 
Another characteristic worth mentioning- whether or not the gang member 
is infected with the Vampiric Virus, all members drink the blood of the 
slain after a skirmish or battle. They even scare the I-Marines.

I ran into one once - With an Armored ATV. Had to back over it twice and 
then tossed it into the Pacific. Needless to say, I now live in FDC.

My party is attempting to circumvent the primary problems e.g. 
insanity/death associated with the barrier by entering a state of 
"cryogenic statis" in a life support unit on the way up. Why cryo? We 
hope that our lowered body functions and reduced auras due to being 
enclosed in high tech machinery will help us survive. We have already 
decided we can deal with the rest of the problems. Dave will be there 
with them and could use your input.

Well, I can't name my sources, but you might look at the article in this 
issue of the NAGEE (Shadow Space). It describes the state of astral 
space beyond the barrier and in the void. (It also includes your group's 
findings on the barrier. Thanks much! Not everyone would have been 
willing to share such hard-won data.)

I think I speak for many when I say we await your findings avidly.  I 
hope you come back to tell us what's out there.

Rock on! I've tried to make sure this is as accurate as possible, and 
I've called on quite a few of my friends to add their comments. Enjoy,

LOS ANGELES

A SHORT HISTORY OF HELL

The first thing people see when flying into Los Angeles at night is the 
sea of light. Los Angeles is the largest metrozone in North America. 
Extending from the Angeles National Forest 160 kilometers down to 
Northern San Clemente, from the Pacific Ocean 100 kilometers to Palm 
Springs, Los Angeles is solid urbania. There are sections of Los Angeles 
that haven't been seen by outside eyes for 20 years or more. East Los 
Angeles and the Watts District are today's versions of our grandparents' 
uncharted jungles. Who can forget Brigit McSidhe's classic performance 
in Tarzana of the Jungle?

Landing at LAX, Los Angeles is the largest jewel in the world, a 
nightlight of immense proportions. The third thickest smog in the world 
makes it sparkle like chrome on a poseur.

Describing the lights of Los Angeles in the twentieth century, Douglas 
Adams said:

"... but light is meant to illuminate something, and having driven 
through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was illuminating 
they didn't think much of it."

Mr. Adams also described Los Angeles as "...being like several thousand 
square miles of [...] junk mail, but without the same sense of moral 
depth. Plus the air is, for some reason, yellow."

Of course, today it's brown. If you plan on spending any time outside, 
bring a filter.

He makes a good point. Los Angeles is now a rat's maze of walls and 
highways. In the jungles, there is no law and no escape. All areas 
around a jungle are walled, with the result being the jungles are walled 
in. Gangs rule like ancient Irish marauders.

>>>[You'll need weaponry in the jungles, but don't flaunt it. People 
will die for a good weapon in the zones of LA, and gang leaders 
will not hesitate to sacrifice their gangs for a good automatic.]<<<
-- Erol Flin (10:11:54/01-01-50)

>>>[Don't even be seen with smart goggles. You'll be wading in corpses 
in seconds.]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (09:54:12/01-01-50)


HIGHWAYS AND LOWAYS

In Los Angeles you only need a drivers' license to drive the highways, 
since that's the only place where the CHP patrols. Local police will 
only require that you have a credstick or other form of identification. 
A drivers' license is a valid form of identification, of course.

Highways:
    2                       Santa Monica Blvd
    134                     Ventura Frwy
    210/30                  Foothill Frwy
    170                     Hollywood Frwy
    42/5                    Santa Ana Frwy
    10 (West)               Santa Monica Frwy
    110                     Harbor/Pasadena Frwy
    405 (from 101 to 2)     San Diego Frwy
    5 (North of 10)         Golden State Frwy
    10 (West to 210)        Santa Monica Frwy
    1                       Pacific Coast Hwy

Loways:
    405 (except 101 to 2)   San Diego Frwy
    101                     Ventura/Hlywd Frwy
    66                      Foothill Blvd
    5 (except  N of 10)     Santa Ana Frwy
    10 (East to 210)        San Bernardino Frwy
    710 (except N of 10)    Long Beach Frwy
    39                      Beach Blvd
    72                       Whittier Blvd

>>>[Last time I was in Hollywood, I was stopped from entering Hwy 101. 
Security officer recommended I just turn around unless I had an 
automatic of some kind. I guess the rent-a-car looked too sedate.]<<<
-- MicroMara (19:12:34/01-02-50)

>>>[You were in LA without a weapon?]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:07:11/01-03-50)

>>>[I had an Ingram under the seat, but I wasn't going to show it to 
a cop!]<<<
-- MicroMara (18:49:41/01-03-50)

>>>[Why? Cops admire a good weapon as much as anyone else.]<<<
-- Security Czech (20:52:02/01-03-50)

If you're going to drive a highway, you'll need a permit. Highways are 
strictly regulated to avoid traffic problems. There are 24 colors, each 
for a specific hour, and you buy the color(s) you need. The Gold Permit 
is rare and expensive, but it gives you full access to the highway you 
ride. The Gold Permit costs 20,000´. Standard Permits cost 1,200´, and 
permits last for one year. You can get a Commuter Permit for 1,800´, 
which gives you the choice of two hours, but they must be at least 6 
hours apart. If you want one for a prime hour (6,7,8, and 9 in the 
morning, or 3,4,5,6,7 or 8 in the afternoon), apply early. The waiting 
period for these ranges from 2-12 months, depending on the highway. 
Others have a waiting period of from 0 to 11 weeks.

If you need to use the highway now, you can wait in the daily lane. This 
allows you to use the highway once, for up to an hour. You'll need to 
buy another daily for your return trip. Dailies cost 10´ normally, 15´ 
on weekends (6 PM Friday to 4 AM Monday).

>>>[Be prepared to wait up to 3-4 hours on Friday and Saturday nights. 
And the Hollywood offramps are usually locked out after 11 PM those 
nights.]<<<
-- Thomas Chin (03:39:25/01-03-50)

>>>[Damn cruisers.]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:09:11/01-03-50)

>>>[The chips will stop and arrest anyone driving with an incorrect 
permit. They do not want another disaster like the Highway 101 fiasco. 
If you miss your time slot, you've just missed a day of work.]<<<
-- MicroMara (19:02:12/01-03-50)

>>>[Why not take the bus? They've got Gold Permits.]<<<
-- Security Czech (20:58:59/01-03-50)

>>>[Sure. And you'll be lucky if any part of your car remains at all in 
the bus parking lot. They're guarded by incompetent orcs on meth.<<<]
-- Bible Bob (00:05:32/01-03-50)

>>>[Hey! My brother-in-law is a parking attendant for CalTrans.]<<<
-- Erol Flin (10:01:41/01-04-50)

>>>[See?]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:29:29/01-04-50)

>>>[The best way to get onto the Highway is to rent a car with the right 
permit. Rent-a-car agencies by permits in allotments. Renting a permit 
with your car usually adds 20-60´ per day, depending on the time slot. 
Or 400-1000´ for a Gold.]<<<
-- Hank Spank Williams
(13:21:05/01-04-50)

>>>[Don't think you can fool a chip with a colored sticker. The colors 
of the permit are for you, not the cops. The permits are actually 
upcoded for ultraviolet scan.]<<<
-- Puestiel (14:42:20/01-04-50)

>>>[Which brings up a little known fact: when you buy a permit, your 
name goes into a police file (easy to get into, my decker friends tell 
me). Chip copters automatically scan every car they pass, and the 
computer can tell if the car has been reported stolen or if there's 
anything the police want to talk with you about.]<<<
-- MicroMara (18:48:02/01-04-50)

>>>[Deckers got friends? Anyway, it also means they keep track of who's 
been where, don't they?]<<<
-- Lester Riverfield
(19:18:21/01-04-50)

Loways do not require permits. Bring beer, a pizza, and a weapon. You'll 
be going about two kilometers an hour at best. Many people on the Loways 
live in their vehicles.

>>>[Of course they do. They lost their lease while they were stuck on 
the road.]<<<
-- MicroMara (19:22:34/01-03-50)

>>>[The best way to get around on the Loways is by bike. Gotta look out 
for the assholes, though. Never know when someone's going to swerve or 
open a door.]<<<
-- Erol Flin (10:11:09/01-04-50)

>>>[Loway 101 has the best parties]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:37:29/01-04-50)

>>>[Make sure your credstick is green. Food copters will lower food, 
drinks, water, and gas. But it costs. About triple standard prices. Oh, 
and bring cash or barter for the less legal stuff.]<<<
-- Feral (12:03:58/01-04-50)


SPECIAL ATTRACTIONS IN LOS ANGELES

DISNEYLAND

Disneyland was founded nearly a century ago as the dream of pioneer vid 
animator Walt Disney. Disneyland is by far the best children's show of 
the awakened world. The Adult price is 40´, and the Child (14 or under) 
price is 30´.

>>>[You can get a 10´ discount at just about any Ralph's. And Disney is 
always doing special promotions.]<<<
-- John (02:33:11/01-02-50)

>>>[Disney security is top-notch. They don't want anything screwing up 
the kiddies' fun. And believe me, they can hide a lot of weaponry inside 
those stupid costumes.]<<<
-- MicroMara (18:57:09/01-04-50)

>>>[Who the frag wants to make a run on Disneyland?]<<<
-- Feral (12:01:32/01-05-50)

THE LA BREA TAR PITS

Once a major attraction in Los Angeles (The Rancho La Brea Fossil Pits), 
the tar pits were purchased by the Thessalonians, an order of mages, in 
2032. Originally, their contract required that they keep the tar pits 
open to the public, but after an altercation with the city, they closed 
their doors in 2034.

>>>[Yeah. The city was none too pleased about the drek going on there. 
In 2034 a swat team tried going in. The fireworks were incredible, but 
the mages won. Nobody's been inside the pits since then.]<<<
-- Puestiel (14:30:32/01-04-50)

>>>[What drek? What were the Thesses doing that the city didn't like 
enough to risk taking on an order of mages?]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:57:01/01-04-50)

Now, the tar pits are covered with a wicker and mud dome, and surrounded 
by meso-american stonework. Shops nearby sell postcards and other 
memorabilia.

>>>[Yeah, and every morning the stones are covered in graffiti, and 
every morning they clean it off by nine.]<<<
-- Puestiel (14:41:20/01-04-50)

THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART

Located at 851 La Cienega, in a relatively decent section of Los 
Angeles, the LA County Museum of Art has a vast collection of modern and 
historical art. The Museum specializes in indigenous American artforms - 
from pre-Columbian Mexico and Peru to that of the Eskimo tribes of UCAS, 
and colonial America.

There are also galleries for the Italian Renaissance, the Dutch Golden 
Age, French Impressionism, and African post-Awakening.

>>>[Heh. I remember when they airlifted all the art out of the original 
location, on Wilshire Blvd, back in '29.]<<<
-- Puestiel (14:49:33/01-04-50)

>>>[Anyone know what ever happened to that building?]<<<
-- Bible Bob (00:12:57/01-03-50)

SOUTH COAST BOTANICAL GARDEN

Located at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd, on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the South 
Coast Botanic Garden is an amazing sight for most Langelenos. Admission 
is 5´ per adult, 2´ for senior citizens and children. The garden 
contains a lake, ducks, an orchard, and a wild bird sanctuary. Plants 
from Mediterranean and African climes join with Southern California 
plants in this 87-acre planned wilderness.

>>>[The garden is a fragging weird place. Every once in a while some 
enchanter gets the idea that it makes a perfect hunting ground for bio 
supplies -- Mediterranean and African? What could be better? -- but it's 
invariably an immense waste of time, effort, and soul. The plants here 
simply cannot be enchanted.]<<<
-- Arden Ariadne (20:50:31/12-30-50)

>>>[Yeah. I was one of them. Afterwards, I checked into the history of 
the thing, and it turns out the gardens are on top of a twentieth 
century sanitary landfill. And landfill's atop an earlier diatomaceous 
earth mine. It's no fragging wonder there's no magic left there.]<<<
-- John Flaring Tree (09:33:03/01-01-50)


HOLLYWOOD

Hollywood has walls on three sides, and the fourth side is blocked by 
the foothills of Mt. Hollywood. Hollywood is walled from Van Ness Avenue 
in the east to Fairfax Avenue in the west, and Melrose Boulevard in the 
south. It is bordered by West Hollywood (west), Wilshire (south), and 
City College (east). Laurel Canyon City is considered by some to be part 
of Beverly Hills, and Laurel Canyon does cooperate fully with both 
Hollywood and Beverly Hills officials. Laurel Canyon is the route 
between Hollywood and Beverly Hills, since West Hollywood is walled out 
of both places. The Laurel Canyon-West Hollywood wall runs along the 
south side of Sunset Blvd.

On weekends, outsiders try to go over the walls, especially from West 
Hollywood and City College.

>>>[Most succeed. But remember that Hollywood Security shoots to kill. 
Still, once you're inside, you're safe.]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:29:25/01-03-50)

>>>[Sure, from Security. But don't wander off the blvd at night!]<<<
-- Feral (12:01:11/01-03-50)

>>>[The blvd fills up on Friday nights. Most shops stay open well past 
midnight, if only to protect their stores.]<<<
-- Hank Spank Williams (13:33:31/01-04-50)

The authorities recommend that tourists take a bus or a cab. There is no 
parking on weekends unless you get in Friday morning, before the morning 
rush hour. As office workers leave Hollywood, cruisers come in.
>>>[Well, I recommend hiring a helicopter.  No telling who you'll meet 
on a bus.]<<<
-- MicroMara (18:37:22/01-02-50)

>>>[Since when was an anarchists' guide for drekkin' tourists, 
anyway?]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:31:21/01-03-50)

>>>[Incidentally, Hollywood is a Corp. It's got a CEO and a Board of 
Directors like any other. And it brings in a ton of Nuyen. Anyone taken 
a look at their balance sheet recently?]<<<
-- Feral (12:39:42/01-03-50)


HOTELS IN HOLLYWOOD

THE DUNES SUNSET HOTEL & RESTAURANT
                           5625 Sunset Blvd.
                              (213) 467-5171

The Dunes motel actively seeks the tourist market. It is located near 
Universal Studios, Dodger Stadium, the Hollywood Convention Center, the 
Memorial Coliseum, and, of course, Beverly Hills. They provide daily, 
inexpensive tours through Hollywood, Laurel Canyon, and Beverly Hills.
You can expect to pay two times normal prices here. The rooms are small, 
and the Motel only has ten floors, but it is spread out over nearly an 
entire block.

HOLLYWOOD PALM HOTEL
                        2005 N. Highland Ave.
                               (213) 850-5811
The Hollywood Palm cultivates an early twentieth-century charm. Near the 
famous Hollywood Bowl, the Palm is an expensive place for tourists and 
the hotel of choice for celebrities. The upper 19 floors are reserved 
for those in the acting profession, and the lower  35 floors are for the 
general public. The Palm has it's own small city -- twelve restaurants, 
a bank, a rent-a-car agency, and a small hospital.

Expect to pay approximately 4 to 5 times normal for a general-occupancy 
room in the Hollywood Palm. If you're a celebrity, you can pay up to 10 
to 20 times that, but the service is worth it.

HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL
                           7000 Hollywood Blvd
                        (Hollywood and Orange)
                                (213) 462-5400

The Hotel Roosevelt was built in the early twentieth century, renovated 
in latter part of the twentieth century, and renovated again in 2029. 
The upper floors are almost always reserved for acting ensembles and 
other luminaries. Rates for the lower floors will be about three times 
that of a comparable hotel elsewhere. Expect to pay ten to 20 times for 
an upper floor.

The Roosevelt now has 50 stories, and sways like a palm tree during an

HOTEL HOLLYWOOD
                              5825 Sunset Blvd
                                (213) 462-5400

The Hotel Hollywood has just been completely renovated. It is now the 
largest hotel in Hollywood, with 79 floors.

>>>[Of course it's just been renovated. Someone blew up the last 
one.]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie [10:20:32/01-03/50]

Rates here are only about twice what you'd pay for a comparable hotel 
room elsewhere. The Hotel Hollywood used to be a seedy place, and hasn't 
yet moved beyond the tourist industry. You won't find any stars staying 
at the Hollywood.

>>>[You can see the upper floors in the latest Neil sim -- they're using 
them for the dormitory site.]<<<
-- Warner Bones (08:49:31/01-07-50)

>>>[There are, of course, dozens upon dozens of seedy dives in this 
town. You can get away with only moderate prices (a drekky room for what 
you'd expect to pay for a good one) if you want to.]<<<

HYATT ON SUNSET
                            8401 Sunset Blvd
                              (213) 656-4101

The Hyatt is located between Beverly Hills and Hollywood. It's south 
side overlooks the Laurel Canyon-West Hollywood wall, and the north side 
overlooks the Hollywood Hills (Laurel Canyon). The Hyatt is a favorite 
of corps types. Corporation meetings and continental conferences are 
regularly held at the Hyatt.

Expect to pay three to five times normal for a room here. Many 
corporations have a discount at the Hyatt, so check with your boss 
first.

>>>[My boss? Somehow I don't think the Ripper has a working relationship 
with the Hyatt on Sunset.]<<<

COLUMBIA RECORDS AND CHIPS

Like most record companies, CRC maintains a sizeable presence in 
Hollywood. Columbia, however, is much more ostentatious than others. 
Their building is built with floors that look vaguely like 80 disks 
stuck one on top of the other.

>>>[They'll charge you 1´ for a tour of the place. But no free 
handouts.]<<<

GUITAR CENTER OF HOLLYWOOD

The famous Guitar Center chain's main store is on Sunset Boulevard near 
the border between Hollywood and Laurel Canyon. See the axes made famous 
by Paul Gilbert, Eddie Van Halen, Riot Tenzine and Torquemada, among 
many, many others.

>>>[Of course, if you don't want to spend quite so much, or the sight of 
sleeze bothers you, there are about a dozen other music stores in the 
same three block area.]<<<

HOLLYWOOD BOWL

Just head on up Highland Avenue or Cahuenga, and signs will direct you 
to the famous Hollywood Bowl. The Bowl is a wonderful concert hall. It's 
surrounded by the Hollywood Bowl theme park. The theme park is only 2´ 
if you have a ticket for a Bowl event, or 10´ otherwise (8´ Seniors and 
children). During the summer, the Los Angeles Philharmonic plays here 
regularly. Most rock and pop tours pass through the Bowl on their way 
through the CFS.

>>>[The Bowl is truly a wonderful place to hear music. It's like 
listening to Bach somewhere deep beneath the earth.]<<<

THE HOLLYWOOD CHRISTMAS PARADE

For over 120 years the Hollywood Christmas Parade has been a staple of 
the Christmas season on the North American continent. Even in the depths 
of the VITAS plague, Hollywood continued to present us with a cheering 
spectacle of lightness and goodwill.

The parade is usually the Sunday following the third Thursday of 
November, for historical reasons. Many Hollywood civic groups 
participate, as do many celebrities. Since 2035, the Screen Actors Guild 
has provided a yearly show of wage mage actors sure to warm the heart.

>>>[Bleah! Bleah, bleah bleah!]<<<
-- Hank Spank Williams (13:42:31/01-11-50)

THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN

The sign was originally built with mules and wagons in 1923. It was 
destroyed in 1978, and restored in the same year, this time with 
helicopters. Then, the sign was mostly cement, 45 feet high and 450 feet 
wide. In 2032, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce decided to bring the 
sign up to date, and after a five year celebrity fund-raising campaign, 
the familiar laser-light auto-stim sign was put in place.

The sign is part of Griffith Park, near the Griffith Park Astronomical 
Museum.

>>>[Believe it or not, the Griffith Park Rangers are trouble to mess 
with. I guess after the Lord Holies tried to blow up the sign in '47, 
Hollywood decided to hire some professionals.]<<<
-- Feral (13:01:53/01-07-50)

>>>[Old news. Sure, they did hire some pretty expert people in '48 and 
'49, but 'cost-cutting measures' forced them to go back to standard 
security in '50. So if you want to make a run on the sign (why?) you 
shouldn't have any problem.]<<<

THE HOLLYWOOD STRIP

The place to be in Hollywood on the weekends is the strip. Hollywood 
Boulevard is half of it. The other half is Sunset Boulevard. Take your 
car, your bike, or your feet, and drive from Hollywood Boulevard to Vine 
Street to Sunset Boulevard (or, if you're feeling adventurous, Melrose 
Boulevard), to . Don't take Orange, the lights only work half the time. 
And just keep circling. Stop in at the Sunset Grill for a burger if 
you're not worried about your health. And bring a gas mask.

>>>[Like filters aren't SI in Hollywood anyway? Yo, waitress! I'd like a 
burger and a side order of emph, to go!]<<<
-- Hank Spank Williams (13:35:51/01-11-50)

>>>[Designer filters are all the rage. You can pick them up at most 
shops on the boulevard. Everywhere but Hollywood, air filters are white 
and boring.]<<<
-- Warner Bones [08:43:32/01-07-50]

One of the first things you'll notice on Hollywood Boulevard and Vine 
Street are the stars on the sidewalk. Don't look down too much, those 
holograms can get very disorienting.

>>>[That's verity. I've seen people trip over themselves and fall into 
the street because of those things. Fortunately, traffic never moves 
faster than a crawl.<<<
-- Warner Bones (09:01:55/01-07-50)

These are dedications to entertainment stars of the past and present. If 
a star has died recently, you'll see a light display and flowers above 
their star.

>>>[Heh. When Charlie Sheen died, the faux-fleurs and holo-deds came in 
from everywhere. They had to set up a special viewing room somewhere 
else, because it blocked the boulevard. And we don't let nothing block 
the boulevard.]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie [10:35:09/01-03/50]

THE MELROSE WALL

On Melrose Boulevard you can see the South Wall -- it's right behind the 
buildings.

>>>[You can usually find a couple of bodies there as well.]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:49:20/01-03-50)

MUSICIANS INSTITUTE
                          McCadden and Hawthorne

Hidden just off Hollywood Boulevard (and in the shadow of the Hollywood 
Dianetics Building), Musicians Institute has been churning out speed 
guitarists, bassists, drummers, synthists, and vocalists since the 
twentieth century. As their alumni, they boast of such historic greats 
as Paul Gilbert, Adrian Anders, Nathan Holm, Meci Abroux, and Teleri 
Orloff. Elven Ozone's bassist Mike Orgone swears by his BIT (Bassist 
Institute of Technology) training. If you're interested in honing your 
chops, seriously consider spending a year with the Institute.

THE NEW ORC WAX MUSEUM
                         Hollywood and Highland

Once the Hollywood Wax Museum, this is one of the oldest institutions in 
Hollywood. All the stars of today and yesterday are sculpted in life-
like wax. You can have your picture taken with anyone from Dunkelzahn to 
Neil the Ork Barbarian.

>>>[The best museum is their basement. They don't re-use their wax, just 
in case some of these has-beens ever come back into style. They've got a 
basement full of old and long-forgotten actors.]<<<
-- Warner Bones (09:23:21/01-07-50)

>>>[The reason they don't re-use them is that the real bodies are 
underneath the wax, drek-head.]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:21:39/01-02-50)

THE SUNSET STRIP

For most people, Sunset Boulevard is the other half of the Strip. It 
doesn't have the proliferation of small shops that Hollywood Boulevard 
does but it does have a couple of nice minimalls and more established 
fast food joints.

>>>[The best record stores are on Melrose, chummer.]<<<
-- Chrome Charlie (10:39:21/01-03-50)

XIAO'S CHINESE THEATRE
                         Hollywood and Orange, Xiao Inc.

Calling this Xiao's Theater is a minor misnomer. All the film theaters 
on the Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards are Xiao's. The Chinese, however, 
is the first of the Hollywood empire. It started as Graumann's Chinese 
Theater sometime in the last century, but was bought out immediately and 
renamed Mann's Chinese Theater. Mann's expanded throughout Hollywood, 
and Xiao Inc. inherited it when they bought Mann's in 2029.


DIANETICS VS. THE UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD

There is a war being fought, a war for the hearts and minds of the

L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics and the usurpers from the North, The 
Universal Brotherhood.

LOUDER THAN A BOMB
LAS VEGAS UNDER THE NAN

 "This style seems wild.
  Wait before you treat me like a stepchild."
     -- Public Enemy, Louder Than A Bomb

Disclaimer One: Las Vegas is it's own place. You almost have to have 
been there to truly understand its personality. There is a pretty funny 
and telling essay in September's Travel & Leisure magazine, which sums 
up the feeling of Vegas as "That was the silliest thing I've ever seen. 
I loved it."

Disclaimer Two: There seems to be a feeling that all citizens of the NAN 
are back-to-nature environmentalists. I feel that this is exaggerated. I 
feel that each environmental (and other) issue has more than one side 
(see entry on the Glen Canyon dam) and that there comes a point where 
you have to sacrifice nature -- even just a little -- in favor of 
survival. Also, for the most part, you're more likely to see a NAN 
citizen in a suit than in deerskin. The NAN people are still human, and 
corruption doesn't just disappear because your skin is not white.

What follows are excerpts from Transformation of the West (BarTours, c. 
2049) dealing with the relevant area.

AN OVERVIEW


HIGHWAYS

By necessity, Interstate highways are kept intact and in good repair. 
Most of the U.S. Highways were also kept intact. However, due to the 
NAN's lower population and environmental stance, many of the State 
Highways have been neglected to the point of unsuitability or, most 
notably in the V Regions (see below) removed.
It is also worth mentioning that internal combustion ground vehicles are 
more heavily taxed than electric cars in the NAN, although there is no 
legislation banning the vehicles.

>>>[Just what does U.S. stand for, anyway? I see it all over the old 
highways and off-road.]<<<
-- Rocker (02:43:50/5-6-52)

>>>[U.S. is an abbreviation for U.C.A.S. Many of the old roads were 
built by the old American States.]
-- Seelie (05:33:12/5-9-52)

>>>[This lack of legislation is mainly due to the efforts of combine 
farmers, who -- thanks to White Hawk's process -- find it much cheaper 
to make their own gasohol.]<<<
-- LJ (07:10:38/8-29-52)

>>>[In practice, the combustion tax only really applies to legal 
citizens of the NAN, as it is, in all of the Nations, levied upon 
registration of the vehicle. It is a pretty major tax, though. In the 
Ute, for example, registering an internal combustion car is about ten 
time more expensive than registering an electric car of the same 
make.]<<<
-- Doctor Love (01:01:15/8-31-52)


V REGIONS

 The NAN have turned large portions of their land into places designated 
as untouched by legislation or pollution. Made up originally of the old 
U.S. National Parks, they have grown much larger. The Zion/Bryce Region, 
one of the biggest V Regions, contains the old Zion, Bryce and Capitol 
National Parks, as well as Dixie and some of Fishlake National Forests. 
Like most of the V Regions, cars are not allowed within, except in 
certain entrance points. Only official air units may enter the air space 
under 18,000 feet. All of the state highways, as well as part of U.S. 89 
have been removed from the Region, but the abandoned small towns have 
been left to rot, so some manmade shelter can be found, in decaying 
shape.

>>>[Riggers are advised to avoid crossing through large portions of the 
V Regions. Although the chance of officials firing on you (or even 
following you) within the V Regions is pretty slim, if they catch you 
outside, you might as well hang it up.]<<<
-- Doctor Love (23:53:02/4-7-52)

>>>[The area bordered by Interstates 70, 15, 25 and 40 is some of the 
most breathtaking land on this planet. It also has some interesting 
examples of paranatural flora, some with healing properties.]<<<
-- Tess (14:23:45/7-7-52)

>>>[I'm told that there is a small group in the Ute who try to track 
down and assassinate riggers who violate V Regions. Anyone heard of 
this?]<<<
-- Blaster (12:56:16/8-31-52)

>>>[I've heard that some areas in the V Regions are also Dead Zones. 
Anyone know?]<<<

THE UTE NATION


LAS VEGAS

That Vegas was allowed to remain more or less unchanged is as telling as 
it is surprising. Even today, untold kilowatts are used for the light 
show in downtown Vegas. The glitz is the same as it ever was.

>>>[What is surprising about it? Vegas was taking in billions of dollars 
a year before the treaty of Denver.]<<<

>>>[Vegas is also one of the only places in the Ute where you can get 
good steak.]<<<
-- Manticore (12:47:34/3-1-52


HOTELS

The legendary hotels in Vegas are still going strong. Ceasar's will 
probably stand for yet another hundred years and Bally's will last until 
it gets burned down (again). Rates are about half of what you'd expect 
from comparable resorts in other parts of the world.
Chips, although once good as currency, are now only useable within the 
casino where they were purchased. By old Vegas tradition, however, 
churches still except them.

>>>[Tips are big in Vegas. It is a good idea to have chips or other 
loose cash in Vegas for tips, as credit transfers are fairly slow. When 
gambling (including slots), drinks are free but a tip (1´ is sufficient) 
is expected. For good seats at a show tip the maitre d' 5´ to 20´. Other 
tips include the standard 15% for meals as well as:
Dealers: based on service and winnings
Valet Parking: 1´
Bellman: 5´, unless lots of bags, when more is required
Maid: 1´ per day ]<<<
-- Archon (19:51:00/11-1-51)

>>>[Vegas casinos are always running and always heavily populated. 
You're also always being watched electronically. It is a very tough 
place to sneak about.]<<<

This motel-style place is a Vegas exception. It has no casino, no 
nightclub. It does have a pool and boasts far better rooms and service 
than most hotels of its kind.

trying to save money.]<<<

BALLY'S LAS VEGAS
Address: 3645 Las Vegas Blvd
Luxury Hotel, Casino, Nightclub, Mall
Bias against magicians
LTG#     7777 (BALLYS)
Owner:   Tony Lercara

One of the largest resorts in the world, Bally's contains a full 
shopping mall, two major showrooms, a health club, a youth center, an 
Olympic pool, six restaurants, a comedy club, various bars, golf 
privileges, and 2,832 rooms. Formerly the MGM Grand (before the 1980 
fire), rooms are rife with old Hollywood photos and each room has a star 
on the door.

Gambling facilities include 1,000 slot machines, 11 craps layouts, 84 
blackjack (5´ minimum bet), 12 baccarat, 9 roulette, 20 poker (20 nuyen 
buy-in), sports and race book. Unlike most resorts, Bally's slots run 
entirely on credit (no coins); this drives some away, but provides a 
different background noise than most casinos. Magicians are tolerated, 
but strongly discouraged from gambling.

>>>[Wage Mages roam the crowds, and one checks everyone who enters. If a 
magician checks in, almost every employee in the place will know soon. 
Winners of big pots are checked for magical ability. Lucky magicians are 
politely asked never to return.]<<<
-- Wanda (03:16:12/1-4-50)

>>>[Security is heavy, but very sedate and in the background. Weapons 
larger than light submachineguns must be checked in. Bally's squeezes 
extra service out of their Wage Mages by giving them first go at trouble 
makers in a silent way. They dislike shooting customers, but will do so. 
The last man to attempt a robbery at Bally's was allowed to leave with 
100K in cash and chips, but was sliced in half by a security drone as 
soon as he left.]<<<
-- Cooler (12:23:10/1-15-52)

>>>[Bally's computer system is layered and an onion style fairly typical 
of Vegas. The outer layer is blue, housing reservation making 
information and news about upcoming events. Next is a green system 
holding ticketing, control of the movie units in each room, elevators 
and some of the more mundane resort operations. Next is an orange layer 
for billing, personnel records and the security cameras. The supposedly 
deepest layer holds more personnel records (hard to read) and financial 
information (which seems legitimate and really boring). From the 
outside, there seem to be more nodes than I can account for, but so help 
me if I can find another SAN, even in the red layer. All the things that 
can help you get rich quick are usually their own isolated systems. This 
is the Vegas norm. Keno, for example is an isolated system. The slots 
are individual non-Matrix computers, also isolated. The record keeping 
archive for the sports book is isolated (and red). This is actually more 
effective here than in the rest of the world, because these isolated 
systems are constantly used and manned, as the casinos run 24 hours a 
day.]<<<

CEASAR'S PALACE
Address: 3750 Las Vegas Blvd
Luxury Hotel, Casino, Nightclub
No racial bias
LTG#     7777 (PALACE)
Owner:   Joel Spicola

This Vegas standard emulates a Roman city, complete with moving 
sidewalks, pool, health club, shops, seven restaurants, bars, and 2000 
rooms. The statuary of the Palace is composed of replicas (some in 
Carrara marble) of David, Venus de Milo, the Rape of the Sabines, and 
more.

There are two separate casinos and a private baccarat lounge. Minimum 
blackjack bet is 5´, but there is one 3´ table. Poker buy-in is 25´. 
Ceasar's still has slot, poker and blackjack machines which run on 
quarter nuyen chips.

>>>[Centurions abound in this place, some orks and trolls. They are 
usually armed with Taser weapons. Some areas have lockers with a 
Narcojet rifle and Net Guns. More insidious are the hidden cameras, some 
of which have servoguns. Just about every mirror in the place has a 
camera behind it.
I'm told that Ceasar's hires (some say creates) Samurai to walk about 
undercover, armed. I've seen several men who would fit the bill; not 
obviously cybered, but very fast. Custom stuff if I've ever seen it. 
There is usually a rigger wired into the security system, part of which 
is not Matrix accessible. Remember that Heavy Armor is way illegal in 
the Ute, even for corporate (or casino) security.]<<<
-- Cooler (12:24:01/1-15-52)

>>>[Elementals patrol astral space on the lookout for spells. Awakened 
customers are warned upon entry that magical spells will not be allowed 
for any reason within the casino. Elementals do not attack quickened or 
locked spells. Instead they alert a Wage Mage, who checks to make sure 
the spell is not for the purpose of cheating. Generally, the Mage will 
watch the magician for quite some time.]<<<
-- Marackeshh (23:56:52/2-6-52)

>>>[Ceasar's entire system is red, except for a separate green 
reservation computer. It utilizes isolated gambling systems. The system 
is not sculpted at all. Perhaps Ceasar's wished to spare its employees 
Roman overkill.]<<<
-- Bilbo (23:29:12/2-24-52)

>>>[Big winners, especially on the slots, at Ceasar's are usually 
subject to examination for magical ability and cyberware. Slot winners 
with cybereye video cameras are asked never to come back. Ditto card 
game winners with headware memory/program carriers. By the way, cameras 
and hand computers are not allowed in any casino in Vegas.]<<<

THE EDGE
Address: 3661 Las Vegas Blvd
Luxury Hotel, Casino, Nightclub
No racial bias
LTG#     7777 (28-1287)
Owner:   Matre Pagano

Built in the late 1990's, this smaller resort is themed around the dark 
future presented in the cyberpunk literary movement of the early '80s. 
Among it's neon, lasers, smoke and stainless steel-sheeted architecture 
can be found a Matrix amusement park (looking much like an auditorium of 
chairs, each with a input into the 'mind-park'), three restaurants, two 
lightning exhibits, 900 rooms, one of the largest holo-game arcades in 
the country, and several historical/artistic exhibitions of some of the 
less savory aspects of human nature. Recently, in an effort to win back 
customers, the Edge has taken a post nuclear turn. (Two guests 
apparently died of heart failure when illusory nuclear detonations 
kicked off a surprise attack party last January.)
Where most Vegas casinos are open spaces, the Edge's casino is a mass of 
twisted metal, smoke and arcing electricity. It also has no slot 
machines of any kind. Blackjack minimum is 10´ and poker buy-in is 30´. 
Baccarat tables occupy a sort of aristocratic calm in the storm.

>>>[No slots? They're cutting themselves out of some profits. Plus the 
atmosphere is one not really suited to those with weak constitutions. 
Weird.]<<<
-- A.C. (19:32:09/12-1-51)

>>>[We view the Edge as an artistic endeavor, not a profit making 
opportunity. But A.C. is correct. If not used to the lifestyle, please 
stay away. This makes it easier on our janitorial staff.]<<<
-- Alexis Pagano, L.L.B. (18:50:19/12-23-51)

>>>[Security here is very visible, as fits in with the theme. Guns are 
allowed, but using them his harshly dealt with. The camera/servo-gun 
combo is used here too, except that they are not concealed. An 
occasional patron disappears, but other patrons are usually blamed. I 
tend to agree with that, the Edge is a tough place. But artistic in a 
kind of jump-off-a cliff way.]<<<
-- Cooler (12:24:01/1-15-52)

>>>[I was present at what is now called the Doomsday Party. It was a 
pretty raucous time, and surprising as hell. There I was, up five grand 
at blackjack, when suddenly missiles bust through the far wall 
(apparently, no matter where you were, it was through the 'far wall') 
and bathes the poker tables with nuclear fire. Lasers fired from the 
walls, 'killing' people (employees in make up, it turned out). The place 
quickly turned into a madhouse. We all wondered why they took guns that 
night, but the place woulda been a bloodbath if they hadn't. It ended up 
being a hell of a party. My winnings were swiped in the confusion, but I 
didn't mind so much. It was that kind of party.]<<<
-- Arc (15:10:01/3-03-52)

>>>[The Edge is one of the few casinos where Magic is actually 
tolerated. But be warned, if (and only if) you use magic to gamble, it 
will be used against you. They usually have much more practice. The 
magician to normal ratio is about double in employees and patrons 
alike.]<<<

LTG#     7777 (28-5630)
Owner:   Joseph H. Thomasi

Looking like a fantasy castle (complete with drawbridge, moat and 
ladies-in-waiting), Excalibur harkens back to the legends of King 
Arthur. On the 117-acre site can be found 23 shops, an 890-seat 
amphitheater, two pools, a marriage chapel, 7 restaurants (including 
Lance-A-Lotta Pasta), 6 theaters, bars, and 4,000 rooms.
The gaming area is over 100,000 square feet, including 2,600 slot 
machines, a crossbow arena and a separate gladiatorial games viewing

bet is 3´ and poker buy-in is 20´.

guess.]<<<

THE MIRAGE
Address: 3400 Las Vegas Blvd
Luxury Hotel, Casino, Nightclub
No racial bias
LTG#     7777 (27-6667)
Owner:   Maria Maldinato

The Mirage's claim to fame is a volcano which erupts every 15 minutes. 
It also houses 5 restaurants, a spa, a salon, a waterfall strewn pool, 
an indoor rainforest, shops, 3049 rooms, and empty cases and aquariums 
which used to house dolphins, sharks and paratigers. The top five floors 
are penthouses, accessible only by private elevators.
The casino is a bit brighter than others. Minimum bet is generally 5´, 
but some 2´ blackjack tables exist.

>>>[Mirage security is notoriously hard to spot, until they're all over 
you. All firearms bigger than handguns are asked for (but not absolutely 
required) at the door. Two riggers are always on duty, one monitoring 
cameras, one running drones inside and out. If some security people 
hassle you, remember their faces; data worth money.]<<<

an orange sub-system, the Mirage's is red. Additionally, both red layers 
can be reached from the green layer and not each other. This system has 
no unaccounted for nodes and is sculpted so that each layer appears as 
Caribbean island. The SAN to the rest of the Matrix appears as the beach 
of the Mainland.]<<<

TROPICANA
Address: 3801 Las Vegas Blvd
Luxury Hotel, Casino, Nightclub
No racial bias
LTG#     7777 (TROPIC)
Owner:   Michael Beck

Tropicana offers Caribbean decor, seven restaurants, lounges (one of 
which offers a great view of the tennis courts), a golf course, glass 
elevators, the largest indoor/outdoor pool (including swim-up blackjack 
tables, three Jacuzzis and a water slide), a lagoon surrounded island, 
and 1,913 rooms.

Gambling is pretty standard (5´ minimum with two 2´ blackjack tables, 
20´ poker buy-in), with the added feature of weekly underwater glad 
games.

>>>[Tropicana security wear Caribbean dress and carry SMGs very 
prominently, but if you want to pull anything this month, do it here.

'til they fire their sec head. They require gun check in, but don't 
check real well.]<<<

BOULDER DAM

Completed in 1935 to control water flow and provide power to a large 
portion of the Southwest, Hoover Dam was an asset that the Ute Nation 
could not afford to be without. Although there was an initial media 
outcry favoring elimination of the dam to "remove man's scars to the 
land", when the issue was put to a national election, the Ute people 
elected to keep the dam by a 90 percent majority, mostly due to a highly 
successful (not to mention different) word-of-mouth campaign.

>>>[This entire campaign was funded by the corporations who wish to 
continue their exploitation of our lands.]<<<
-- Michael Breathing-Dog
     (05:49:55/4-25-52)

>>>[Sorry. B.D., but for the first time I can recall, your info sucks. 
It was the Vegas-based Mafia who sent the Dam advocates to every town in 
the Ute. The Mob was concerned about the loss of the electricity from 
the Dam to Vegas, although I think the people would have voted to keep 
it even without the Mafia preaching about farmer's water rights.]<<<
-- Ex-terminator (01:19:39/9-4-52)

Originally named Boulder (due to its proximity to Boulder City), the Dam 
was renamed Hoover Dam not too long after completion. When the Ute 
Nation was formed and they began to assess their territory, they changed 
the name to its original form.

Although the lake formed by the dam -- Lake Mead -- was a large tourist 
center before the Awakening, the entire dam complex (as well as Boulder 
City) is now a military installation ensuring the safety of the dam 
(mainly against aggression from the California Free State). Although 
Interstate 93 still exists as a road through the region (and still runs 
across the top of the dam), it is closed to public traffic.

>>>[There is more traffic in and out of Boulder Dam than is strictly 
necessary for simple dam defense. It could be anything from simple 
training to high security stuff. Any guesses?]<<<
-- Edward Seven Men (12:12:12/10-10-52)

The dam is 660 feet thick at the base, 45 feet think at the crest and 
spans the 1244 feet across the Black Canyon. The structure contains 
roughly 4.4 million cubic yards of concrete.

As the dam was originally built using funds from seven states, some 
legal documents existed dealing with the dams distribution of water and 
power to these seven states. The NAN lands who left the Treaty of Denver 
with control of these lands (some sooner, some later) invoked these 
documents and demanded their share from the Ute.

The Ute Council responded by declaring that as the previous agreements 
dealt with borders that no longer existed, new agreements would have to 
be made. The other nations soon discovered that whether Ute had a legal 
right to do this or not was irrelevant, as the Ute had the dam and could 
control its output.

Agreements were drawn up, with Ute getting by far the best end of the 
deals. The Council gave preferential treatment to other Amerindian 
nations. It treated Aztlan with disdain, but they received a far better 
deal than did California.

Boulder Dam's 17 generators now supply over 2.4 million kilowatts to a 
large portion of the Southwest, including Vegas and Los Angeles. The 
Boulder Dam still controls water flow to prevent the floods of summer 
and droughts of autumn which necessitated its construction in the first 
place. Lake Mead, which backs up nearly 180 miles behind the dam, can 
store nearly 2 years of average Colorado River water flow (about 28.5 
million acre-feet).


GLEN CANYON DAM

Before 1956, the area which was to become the Glen Canyon dam site was 
almost entirely inaccessible. The nearest available point of crossing to 
the other side of the canyon was 200 miles away. That changed with the 
construction of the Glen Canyon Bridge in 1959. The dam itself (built 
about 75 feet upriver from the bridge) was completed in 1963. Lake 
Powell did not finish filling the canyon until 1980.

After the new Ute government had dealt with Boulder Dam, they began to 
discuss what to do with Glen Canyon. Sighting the reasons for keeping 
Boulder Dam, most of the government was satisfied to leave Glen Canyon 
as it was as well; however, a somewhat large lobbying group attacked the 
Council over the issue, charging that the Council members had "turned 
their backs on the land." In a short time, this group gained more 
support, and seemed ready to demand the destruction of the dam "to allow 
the earth to heal herself."

The Council reacted by putting the issue on the next national ballot. 
During this announcement, a small coalition forced their way to the 
podium and announced that destroying the dam would destroy the ecosystem 
which had finally stabilized in Lake Powell, doing more harm to the land 
than good. This was coupled with a well executed media blitz, including 
support from Vegas, Salt Lake, Provo, and Denver news services.

The election was held, and after four recounts, the Ute elected to keep 
Glen Canyon dam with 59% of the vote. Security at the dam was increased 
for a time, but eventually returned to normal as disgruntled activists 
flocked to another issue of the day.

>>>[At the time, rumors abounded about who was behind the ecosystem 
group (who actually seemed to be the most coherent, if you ask me). I 
give most credence to the rumor that FoodTech was their main financial 
backer (this was before their U.N. indictment, remember). What their 
interest was, I'm not sure. In any case, the ecosystems group was most 
decisive in splitting up the environmental vote.]<<<

on our lands.]<<<

The dam is one of the major hubs of the Colorado River Storage Project 
(CRSP) not only in water storage, but in power generation. The dam's 1.8 
million kilowatts do not reach L.A. or Las Vegas and only rarely (in 
emergencies) does the power reach Phoenix, Salt Lake or Denver. Instead 
the dam powers hundreds of medium and small cities and towns in what 
what used to be Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico and 
Nebraska. The 13,800 volts from the generator is stepped-up to 345,000 
volts for its transmission to Montrose, from where all power from the 
CRSP system is routed.

Like Boulder Dam, Glen Canyon provides water to acres of surrounding 
land, as well as maintaining a steady flow of water to prevent flooding 
in the early summer and drought in the fall. Summer output is generally 
about 30,000 cubic feet per second. Additionally, Lake Powell (the lake 
formed by the dam) has grown to be a major tourist attraction for the 
Ute.


PAGE

Located on the northwestern border of what used to be the Navajo Indian 
Reservation, Page was founded in the 1950's to provide homes and 
services to those who worked on the Glen Canyon Dam, and later, those 
who ran the dam and worked for the tourist trade.

After the Treaty of Denver, income from tourism fell to almost zero and 
Page lost half of its population. Once the furor from the dam vote had 
died down, Page officials realized that the only way to assure the 
survival of Page was to bring back the tourists. After securing a small 
Federal loan from the Ute Council, Page launched an extensive 
advertising campaign throughout the Ute.

Although the growing Amerindian corporate class was slow to respond, 
they did respond. By 2045, Page had doubled in size and is rapidly 
becoming one of the Ute's most visited vacation spots.

Page offers a back-to-nature type vacation without many of the back-to-
nature type drudgeries. This "go rock-climbing in the naked desert by 
day, sleep in silk sheets by night" style of recreation appeals to the 
growing Native American urban/corporate class, as more of them are being 
born and raised within cities. Page offers boating, water-skiing, white-
water rafting, Anasazi ruins, hiking and rock-climbing hand in hand with 
music, theatre, dancing, night clubs and luxury hotels on the lake.

The canyon itself separates the two halves of Page's offerings. Page 
itself is located on a hill overlooking the south rim. The boat harbor 
(and a few hotels) are on the north shore of Lake Powell. Up the coast 
of Lake Powell can be found Nonnoshoshi (a Navajo word meaning "the 
rainbow turned to stone"), the largest natural bridge on earth.

Page boasts a fairly large convention hall, a 700-seat auditorium, a 
small airport, and a moderate-sized, state of the art heliport. 
Helicopter travel is the only convenient ways to get into page, 
especially from the North, as U.S. Highway 89 is no longer (State 
Highway 98 still runs south from Page, however). Supplies usually reach 
Page by helicopter or by pollution-free barges and ferries down Lake 
Powell. It is important to note that what was the Glen Canyon National 
Recreation Area is one of very few such areas that was not turned into a 
V Region.

>>>[Page, at least Inner Page (the original Page, before the Tourist 
Boom) is a designed town. Schools and churches are built right across 
from one another, apparently in deference to old United States zoning 
laws. (Something about churches and schools in neighborhoods where you 
couldn't get alcohol licenses.) Mind you, it is a bit expensive. If you 
plan on staying for more than a week and wish to shuttle from hotels to 
camping to conventions, it will probably be in your best interest to 
have your car (electric ONLY) ferried to Page. Cabs can get a bit 
expensive. Better yet, bring a bicycle. Generally, about everything 
useful (hotels, meals, etc.) is about 20 - 25% more than usual for 
Ute.]<<<

On one of my brief forays into the Hollywood areas (God save me) I, Max 
Overhaul, happened across an odd version of Street Samurai.  They seem 
to be indigenous to Hollywood, but are spreading out into the Eastern 
Coast and the outlying areas.  I can only speculate about their origins, 
Perhaps the heavy Japanese influence in the Hollywood area led to their 
existence, but I digress...

The Bladeboy is much like a Street Samurai, but, instead of emphasizing 
firearms, uses Armed and Unarmed combat. Quite deadly at close ranges, 
and not any less dangerous from a distance. If you meet one, don't mess 
with him.  If you are one, kick some butt.

BLADEBOY

The Bladeboy embodies the Real Samurai of Feudal Japan, honorable 
(usually), deadly (always), and stealthy (as often as possible).  
Extremely dangerous at close range, the Bladeboy uses a plethora of 
silent weaponry for the quick kill.  However, this doesn't mean that the 
Bladeboy is not dangerous in ranged combat.  His bow fulfills that void.  
Some also think that a bow cannot keep it's place in a firefight.  That 
is why he carries a Colt Manhunter.

DEAD ZONES
                          Doctor Jerold Stratton, Ph.D. Psychology


Dead Zones are mysterious regions where technology fails. There are 
known Dead Zones in the Anzo-Borrego near San Diego, and one north of 
Denver.

Dead Zones are known to change size at irregular intervals. One rumor is 
that they wax and wane with the phase and visibility of the moon. 
Another is that they grow as a natural check against the human 
population -- as populations in nearby cities grow, so will any Dead 
Zones nearby.(1)

When nearing a Dead Zone, computers stop working (and may lose volatile 
memory), and cyberwear starts acting up. This 'warning zone' can vary in 
size from a meter to a kilometer. Once within a Dead Zone, nothing 
electronic works, and it seems that sub-atomic processes stop as well.

Because of the effects, it's very hard to determine how a Dead Zone 
affects technology in the way that it does. Some magicians claim that 
within a Dead Zone, the laws of nature revert to their natural state -- 
that devised by the Greek philosophers and naturalists. Matter becomes 
homogeneous, composed of Earth, Air, Fire and Water.(2) Unfortunately, 
we can't just go in and check this out -- Electron Microscopes don't 
work, of course, in a Dead Zone. Everything visible seems to remain the 
same, but electricity stops flowing and radiation stops (or is blocked) 
within the zones.(3)

One of the most intriguing theories surrounding the Dead Zones is that 
the Awakening hasn't yet finished. Eventually, the Dead Zones will grow 
to cover the world. Most of the theorists believe that such will only 
occur after hundreds of years, but the implications are staggering.

Much of our knowledge about humanity comes from inference based on 
techno assumptions. Carbon (radioactive) dating is a prime example. If, 
throughout half of our history, radioactive breakdown has not been 
occurring, then everything over five-ten thousand years old is up to 
twice as old as we thought it was.

And what will happen to our civilization when technology fails 
completely? Satellites will fall and undersea villages will suffocate. 
But is it possible that this has happened before? There are many strange 
legends that crackpots of the last century have attempted to explain via 
an alien race or technologically advanced forebears. Could it have been 
an earlier Awakening that drove Atlantis into the sea? Might astronauts 
have visited us in unknown times, only to be stranded here (or 
elsewhere) when the magic came and the technology went?

   Jovanovich, 2049.

   Phillips, March 15, 2043.
(3)Two well-received experiments have backed this up. The first
   (Wiedrich and Fries), reported in New Research, February, 2050,
   showed that X-Ray sources do not leave a mark on photographic plates
   within a zone. The second (Larasia), reported in Scientific
   Republican, January, 2050, showed that rats exposed to highly
   radioactive uranium within a zone were unharmed after weeks of
   exposure, while their control group counterparts contracted severe
   cases of cancer in days.

NEW SKILLS, CONCENTRATIONS, AND SPECIALIZATIONS
                          by ANANDA%BSU.DECNET%MSUS1.BITNET@Sdsc.Edu


The first campaign I started included a rocker and a theatre-type. Due 
to the dearth of related skills in the skill listings, I worked on 
creating my own. After a few sessions and a few new non-player 
characters, new concentrations and specializations also cropped up.

FORMATS:

GENERAL SKILL
   concentration (specializations)

GENERAL SKILL
   concentrations
      specializations

PERFORMING ARTS

Instrumental music and vocal music encompass the ability to play 
instruments or sing well, and can be considered a measure of how good a 
musician a person is. Performance encompasses how the musician interacts 
with an audience. A person could be a technically brilliant musician, 
cutting lots of audio tracks, yet never do a single concert because of 
an inability to deal with an audience.

INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC
   instrument family--e.g. saxophone, clarinet, flute, guitar, synth,
         etc.
      specific instrument--e.g., alto sax, bass guitar, etc.

VOCAL MUSIC
   choral, barbershop, rock, opera, etc.; vocal synth
      specialization is some aspect of the specific concentration

MUSICAL COMPOSITION
   vocal (choral, barbershop, rock, etc.)
      instrumental (chamber music, symphonic, jazz, etc.)

PERFORMANCE 
   actor, singer, comedian, musician
      specialization is a specific style of the concentration

Performance is stage presence and working with an audience.

ACTING
   simsense, movies (flat films), stage plays, trid (by medium)
         comedy, drama, western, horror (by genre)

This skill could possibly switch the concentrations with the 
specializations. I have it arranged this way because more actors talk 
about making 'the big step' from one medium to another (especially 
trid to movies) than from one genre to another. Also, anything to 
simsense is a much bigger step than between any two genres, since the 
latter doesn't usually require the actor to get cybered.

NON-PERFORMING ARTS

ARTISTIC COMPOSITION & DESIGN
   two-dimensional (painting, drawing, etc. [by general technique];
         color or black and white), three-dimensional (sculpture,
         holographs, etc.), animation (children's, adults',
         educational/instructional, etc. [by audience or purpose])

WRITTEN COMPOSITION
   fiction genre -- e.g. mystery, romance, poetry, western, science
         fiction, fantasy, suspense, `popular fiction', etc.
      novels, novellas/novelettes, short stories
   non-fiction genre -- news, science (either general or a specific
         field), self-help, diet/nutrition, etc.
   books/texts, articles (e.g., magazine, journals, newspaper, etc., as
         appropriate), etc.
   scripts -- simsense, movies (flat films), stage plays, trid
         (series), music videos
   comedy, drama, western, horror  (by genre); documentary, etc.

The reason that the genres are concentrations and the lengths are 
specializations is that a person can easier write different lengths of 
works within a different genre than write works of similar length across 
different genres. Scripts are the exception; script authors seem to 
cross genres more frequently than they cross medias.

ACTIVE SKILLS

UNARMED COMBAT
   Fist-fighting (brawling, boxing)
   Throws
   Grapple is renamed Wrestling (take-downs, holds, escapes)

ELECTRONICS
   Security systems (while it is true that many security systems are
         tied into a computer, there are many that aren't.)

SOCIAL SKILLS

LEADERSHIP
   Gang

INTERROGATION
   Verbal (interviewing)
   Machine-aided (lie detectors, etc.)
   Coercive (torture) (sick, I know, but just the thing for your next
         cyberpsycho npc who is determined to get that tidbit of info
         that your players didn't know they had.)

NEGOTIATION
   Bargain (haggling, barter)
   Con (duping someone; persuading someone to do something they normally
         wouldn't do)

ETIQUETTE
   Media (Journalists, Rockers,  Musicians, Actors, etc.)
   Organized Crime (Yakuza, Mafia, Seoulpa rings, Tongs, inter-group
         relations)
   Religions/Cults (by religion or cult, inter-group relations)
   Tech (Technicians, Armorers, Mechanics, etc.)
   Military
   Government

Military and Government specializations include:
      specific branches or departments
      inter-branch or department relations
      local- or state-level groups

About the Organized Crime concentration: Although arguments can be made 
to include this under the Street concentration, the different groups 
listed as specialization possibilities are highly organized and have 
their own rules of conduct, which are very different from the rules of 
etiquette that would apply to gangs and other Street elements. This 
would seem to argue for the various mob groups to be specializations of 
the Corporate concentration. However, the primarily illegal and extra-
legal orientation of the mob groups does not fit the Corp. 
concentration. Making Organized Crime its own concentration solves these 
problems.

KNOWLEDGE SKILLS

THEOLOGY
   Christian, Hindu, Muslim, etc.
   history of the religion or church, rituals, customs, etc.

LANGUAGES
   Move Estonian from the Baltic family to the Finnic family. One person
         speaking Finnish and one speaking Estonian can understand each
         other fairly well.     
   Romance family: add Ancient Latin, Medieval Latin, and Church Latin.
         There are sufficient differences between the three to
         differentiate them.
   Sign Languages: American Sign Language, Perkins-Athabaskan
   Sasquatch
   Special Languages: Pidgin English (the City Speak equivalent of many
         semi-aboriginal groups in South America, Africa and Asia)


SHADOW SKILLS
                                           Jerry Stratton


Here are some skills you won't necessarily learn at the city college. 
You'll most likely need to find a teacher in security or in the shadows.
These are all special skills, and fall under the heading of Action 
skills. These require 2x Karma to train in, so referees take note: they 
are general skills, and cover quite a bit of ground.

OPEN LOCKS

Opening locks covers hard locks (padlocks, etc.), electronic locks, and 
computer locks. Each type requires its own special tools, and characters 
can concentrate in any of those three types (or any other types that may 
exist). A hard lock kit costs 200´. An electronic lock kit costs 400´, 
and a computer lock kit costs 800´. Opening locks is usually an 
unresisted test against the lock's rating, with extra successes reducing 
the base time to unlock. Some especially tough locks will have a 
threshold less than or equal to their rating.

IMPERSONATION

Impersonation covers all forms of impersonating other people: 
ventriloquism, disguise, and mannerisms. Each of those three can be 
concentrated in. Using this skill is usually an unresisted test against 
a number chosen by the referee, using the Skill Success Table. A troll 
trying to impersonate a human, for example, will find it nearly 
impossible. The referee will need to take into account the backgrounds 
and appearance of the impersonator and the person being impersonated. A 
street punk impersonating a CEO will find it a difficult task, unless 
the street punk has knowledge of corporate etiquette.

The number of successes show how well the impersonation succeeded. Only 
one success will be necessary to fool most people. People who know the 
person being impersonated will have a threshold up to their 
intelligence.  If the street punk tries to impersonate the CEO to the 
CEO's wife, the punk will need at least one more success than the wife's 
intelligence. Impersonating the CEO to his secretary will require only 1 
extra success (a threshold of 1).

The impersonator can reduce the target number by studying what needs to 
be done. If the street punk above finds someone willing to show him how 
a corporate CEO acts, he can make an Intelligence test vs. the target 
number (6), and the successes here reduce the target number when making 
the actual impersonation attempt. The street punk's intelligence is 3. 
He rolls 1 six. This brings the impersonation target number down to 5. 
Characters cannot study to bring down target numbers that are high 
because of physical reasons (a troll impersonating a human). The referee 
will have to decide which part of the target number is physical and 
which mental. It takes target number days to study for the intelligence 
test.

A disguise kit costs Rating times 50´ and weight three times Rating 
kilograms. The rating is the maximum target number the kit can deal 
with. A rating 5 kit can only be used for challenging  or easier 
impersonations.

SLEIGHT OF HAND

Sleight of Hand covers picking pockets, magic tricks, and diverting 
attention. Each of those can be concentrated in. Sleight of Hand is 
usually an unresisted success test against the target's intelligence 
(perception). The referee may assign a threshold for particularly 
difficult sleight-of-hand attempts. Picking a pocket is fairly easy (no 
threshold), but picking a pocket inside several layers of clothing will 
be more difficult (a threshold of 1 or 2).

A magic kit will cost 50´ or more, depending on what the character is 
going to do.

Spells attributed to White Winter thanks to Erekosse,

ASTRAL FOG     Manipulation (Transform)
               D.C
Astral Fog     M1     Mana     Sustained

A rather oddball desperation move, but D.C. swears it can be effective 
(then again, he's not as good in Astral Combat as I am). Target number 
of 6, and each success generates a point of background count within the 
spell's area of effect, making an effective smokescreen.

Background Count is defined in the Grimoire. It affects every magical 
act in the area.

BLACKOUT     Illusion
             D.C
Blackout     M2     Physical     Sustained

An area-effect stunt of D.C.'s that blinds everyone in the room 
(including yourself, so you might want to Perceive before casting it). 
And yes, this one does work on cybereyes.

It's a physical spell, so it affects cybereyes and cameras. You can 
think of it as cutting off visual input, or you can think of it as 
replacing one's visual input with basic null-light 0% black. Either way 
it affects cameras (however, the target for living beings is their 
Willpower, while the target for a camera is 9, it being a high-tech 
gizmo thing).

The mere shift to Perceiving voids the spell. However, then you can't 
really hear what's going on...

DISGUISE VEHICLE     Illusion
                     Spectre
Disguise Vehicle     L2     Physical     Sustained
Touch Required

Mask for your car. And it's touch-required, but if you're inside all 
you've gotta do is lay your hands on the wheel or on the seat. Real 
handy for evading pursuers in heavy traffic.

I gave it a one-level boost to the drain code to make it sound like 
another vehicle as well as just looking like it (people are going to 
raise an eyebrow when your erstwhile Dodge Scoot makes the noise of a 
150cc engine).

EXISTENTIAL BLUES     Manipulation (Control)
                      D.C
Existential Blues     M1     Mana     Sustained

A nihilistic Mob Mind -- overwhelms everyone in the area of effect with 
a terrible sense of futility and pointlessness. Makes 'em just wanna 
give up and quit whatever they're doing. Frankly, I have trouble staying 
motivated sometimes without this spell, but I can see some potential 
uses.

D.C. originally designed it as a single-purpose Mob Mood, but then 
realized that for only one more level of Drain (and really, M1 is no big 
deal), he could intensify the effects and make them actively want to 
give up instead of just feeling angsty.

FORCED TRUTH     Manipulation (Control)
                 White Winter (Leader, Hermetic Order of Guardians)
Forced Truth     L2     Mana     Sustained

The subject of this spell is forced to tell the truth while this spell 
is in effect. The spell does not, however, force the subject to speak. 
The threshold is the victim's willpower. The referee may allow 
additional resistance tests as warranted by the situation.

>>>>>[I picked up this spell at Blue Moon Lore Store over near Seattle 
U. I got it by its proper name, but I guess it's to be expected since 
the sign on the door said "White Winter Proprietor." This is great to

streets.]<<<<<

KNOW EXIT     Detection
              Spectre
Know Exit     M2     Physical     Sustained

Now this one is useful. It's a hypersense spell, with the usual 
provision that the number of successes establishes the effective range. 
Basically, it's a trail of bread crumbs -- lets you know exactly the 
fastest way out of a building, assuming the exit is within the effective 
range. Once you get this spell up and running, you're a virtual escape-
route bloodhound.

The thing took me two days to write. It doesn't exactly determine the 
fastest route per se... simply the most efficient one. There's a little 
bit o' Detect Enemies in there too, which I accounted for by adding the 
Drastic Effects modifier.

PHANTASMAL FORCE     Illusion
                     Spectre
Phantasmal Force     D1     Mana     Sustained

This is my baby, and I do love it so. Area-effect, full-sensory, 
realistic illusion. I get this sucker going and reality is mine for the 
creating. You see, hear, smell, and feel what I want you too. Having 
always had a nuyen for the macabre, I like to pull stuff like lowering 
the ambient temperature ten degrees, having shrieking demons descending 
from out of the sky, having a room overrun by crawling rats, or 
surrounding myself in a skull-mask and blue flame. A real mindfragger -- 
unfortunately it's mana-based, but that just confuses the chromies even 
more.

This is a standard illusion spell -- my target number is the victim's 
Willpower and varies from victim to victim. What I have to do is keep 
track of the numbers I roll for the success test.

For example, I cast it at Force 4 and throw in 6 points of Pool, and I 
roll 10,9,5,5,4,4,4,3,1,1. Now, characters with Willpower 6+ need to 
roll two successes against my Sorcery to resist; characters with 
Willpower 5 need four successes; characters with Willpower 4 need seven 
successes; etc.

TEMPORARY INSANITY       Manipulation (Control)
                         Jerry Stratton
Temporary L Insanity     L2     Mana     Sustained
Temporary M Insanity     M2     Mana     Sustained
Temporary S Insanity     S2     Mana     Sustained
Temporary D Insanity     D2     Mana     Sustained

Temporary Insanity changes the target's outlook on life to an extent 
that resembles insanity. The nature of the insanity will depend on the 
circumstances when the spell is cast and the target's original 
personality.

The target resists with Willpower, and there is a threshold equal to the 
target's Willpower. The number of successes indicate how detailed the 
insanity will be.

Marcia the wage mage, with Temporary Moderate Insanity (Force 4), 
Sorcery 5, Magic Pool 5, and Willpower 6 casts this spell on Billda Ork, 
Willpower 3. Marcia uses 3 of her Magic Pool dice to augment the spell's 
Force, rolling 7 dice:, getting 5, 7, 8, 1, 4, 4, 10. This is 6 
successes, minus 3 (Billda's Willpower), for 3 successes. Billda resists 
with her Willpower, rolling 3 dice vs. Marcia's Sorcery 5, getting 9, 4, 
and 1. One success does not offset Marcia's 3 successes, so Billda is 
moderately insane (see Insanity)

Marcia rolls drain. She saved 2 Magic Pool dice for drain, so she rolls 
8 dice, vs. the force of 4, getting only 3 successes. She takes Light 
drain.

TRUTH GLOW     Manipulation (Control)
               White Winter (Leader, Hermetic Order of Guardians)
Truth Glow     M2     Mana     Sustained

This area spell works like a polygraph test, however, with more 
accuracy. Instead of monitoring physiological signs of falsehood, it 
detects aural indications. When a subject tells a lie, the individual 
will shed a white glow perceivable to anyone in visual range. The spell 
does not force someone to speak nor does it require the subjects to 
speak the truth; however, falsehood will be quite obvious. The threshold 
of this spell is half the subject's willpower.

>>>>>[The street name on this puppy in most places is Pinocchio version 
1. It's great to use at a meet. If everyone knows the nature of spell, 
it's a good way to establish trust where none is present.]<<<<<
----Erekosse<02:19:43/03-04-52>

>>>>>[I beg to differ. This spell is awful at a meet. You know the old 
saying, "Tell me no secrets, and I'll tell you no lies." Well most meets 
are secret.]<<<<<
----Shade<04:25:34/03-04-52>

>>>>>[Ignore Shade; she's a pathological liar. At our last meet we used 
her to read the contracts.]<<<<
----Spit Fire<15:54:54/03-08-52>

TURN MARBLE TO BAT     Manipulation (Transform)
                       D.C
Turn Marble to Bat     L3     Physical     Sustained

Yeah, I looked at D.C. that way too, but he wasn't kidding. He actually 
carries a bag of shooters around with him, and when things get tight, 
he'll lob a handful of 'em into the oppos' general direction and chase 
'em down with this area effect spell. Whammo -- cloud of bats. Instant 
chaos. It does need to be sustained, though; soon as you drop it, the 
marbles fall to the floor again. 'Course, then they can be stepped on.

The drain code is so low because of the Very Limited Target modifier. 
Not only does it only affect glass (real glass, not Plasti-Vue or Saf-T-
Glas), it only affects spheres of glass less than 3 cm in diameter... 
and it will only turn them into one specific animal, the northern brown 
bat. Note that the target number is going to be the marble's Object 
Resistance of 5 (simple techie object).

X-RAY SPECS     Detection
                Keith Ammann
X-Ray Specs     L2     Physical     Sustained

A handy little gem, to be cast on any voluntary subject. It's a 
hypersense spell, so roll against a Target of 4. Each success lets you 
look through one point of Barrier Rating (inanimate objects only -- you 
can look through a bench, but not a dog). You can guess what my focus 
for it looks like. Yeppers, made in Taiwan.

The target for all hypersense spells (as opposed to ranged detection) is 
4; the number of successes usually determines the range of 
effectiveness, but in this case it determines the strength of the spell 
instead. BTW, there is no resistance test on the part of the object one 
looks through, in case anyone was wondering.


SPELL CREATION NOTES FROM D.C.

D.C. reverse-engineers everything. He'll think back to the last bad 
situation he and his pals were in, think, "What would have been really 
handy to help us out or buy us some time?" and come up with a spell that 
fits the bill. The Astral Fog came from the time he got his butt creamed 
in a mano-a-mano in the ether and decided that the best thing for him 
would have been to make it twice as tough for anyone to do anything -- 
that way his oppo would be just as ineffective as he was at the time.


MASTER SPELL LIST
                              originally compiled by Chris Spindler


Here's a quick reference guide for Shadowrun spells. Thumbing through 
two separate books to determine things that were left out of the table 
in the Grimoire just got too irritating. And now that the On-Line 
Grimoire is regularly providing new spells, it'll only get worse.

The following table is a revised version of the Grimoire's which 
includes useful things like drain code, staging, target numbers and 
threshold (if any).

THE PHARMACY

DRUGS IN SHADOWRUN

Drugs have an effect, which is presumably why they're used. They also 
have the following characteristics: Onset Time, Duration, Aftershock 
Code, Addiction Code, and Addiction Lethality.

Body tests vs. Drugs are almost never affected by dermal armor.

ONSET TIME
The Onset Time is the amount of time it takes for the drug to take 
effect. Often, this will by multiplied by a Body test vs. an Onset 
Target. This target will usually increase with the drug's rating.

DURATION:
The Duration is the amount of time the drug's effects last, once the 
drug has taken effect. This will usually be divided by a Body test vs. 
the Duration Target which will increase with the drug's rating.

AFTERSHOCK CODE:
This is the damage code for Mental damage taken once the drug wears off. 
If the drug's rating is high enough with respect to the user's Body, 
this will be Physical damage. Staging is often affected by the dosage.

ADDICTION CODE:
If the drug is addictive, the user must make a Willpower test once the 
drug wears off. The 'Wound Level,' or Addiction Level is almost always 
the dosage. The Target number is proportional to the drug's rating. The 
addictiveness of the drug is measured in the staging.

The final Addiction Level (after the Willpower test reduces it) is 
multiplied by the drug's rating, for the number of boxes permanently 
filled in on the character's Mental damage monitor. This is the 
Addiction Level, and it isn't additive. The only time the Addiction 
Level increases is when an Addiction test results in a higher Addiction 
Level than the character previously had.

If a character with Willpower 5 takes two doses of a drug with a Rating 
of 3, and an Addiction Code of 4(dosage)2, the player rolls 5 dice 
against a target number of 4, staging 2. If the player rolls 1 success, 
the Addition Level is 2 -- the dosage. If the player rolls 2 or 3 
successes, the addiction level is 1. If the player rolls 4 successes, 
the character is not addicted.

While using the drug, a number of Mental boxes equal to the dosage taken 
times the drug's rating are freed.

If a character has an Addiction Level of 6, and shoots up 1 dose of 
rating 2, the Addiction Level will be reduced to 4 for the duration of 
the drug's effects.

If a character is addicted to more than one drug, keep track of each 
Addiction Level, but only apply the highest.

Penalties due to Aftershock damage do not apply to the Addiction test.

ADDICTIVE LETHALITY:

Each day, the character must make a Craving test. This is a Willpower 
test with a target number equal to the character's Addiction Level. If 
successful, the character has no craving that day. If unsuccessful, 
subtract the highest die roll from the character's Addiction Level, for 
the additional Mental monitor boxes filled in.

If the character goes the full day without getting a fix of at least 
Addiction Level (Rating times Dose), a Body Test is required, vs. the 
drug's Addictive Lethality, with a target number equal to the Addiction 
Level minus the fix taken (0 if none), and a staging equal to the 
Addiction Code staging. If the target number is greater than twice the 
character's Body, the damage is physical. Otherwise, it's mental.

This is also how the character can reduce his, her, or its Addiction 
Level. If the addictive lethality is reduced to no damage, reduce 
addiction level by the number of extra successes, divided by the staging 
(and rounded towards 0).

These tests are not affected by stun caused by the character's addiction 
level, but they are affected by other stun and physical damage that is 
there for most of the night or day.

John is addicted to Crack, with an addictive lethality of Serious and an 
addiction code of (Rating times 2)(Dosage)(2). His addiction level is 5. 
He has a Willpower of 2 and a Body of 3. Monday morning, he rolls a 
craving test, getting 5 and 3. His target number is his addiction level, 
or 5, so he has no craving that day. On Tuesday, he rolls 2 and 4. He 
craves some crack, but his friends lock him up so that he can't get any. 
He must make a Body test vs. 5S2 (addiction level Serious addiction code 
staging). This is mental, since his target number is not greater than 
twice his Body. He rolls 2 and 4, taking Serious mental damage.

On Wednesday, he fails the craving test again, and manages to sneak in 2 
doses of rating 2 crack. This is a fix of 4, reducing the Body test to 
1S2 (the target number is really 2, since that's the lowest possible 
target number). He rolls 4 and 2, taking Moderate mental damage.


USING DRUGS

Combat drugs (such as booster shots, nopane, and hul kaline) are most 
commonly administered via slap patches. This takes one action to self-
administer, as long as the patches are readily accessible.

The next most common means of injection is through built-in cyber-
controlled injectors. These take no action to use -- a simple thought is 
all that's required. Of course, if a character with a loaded cyber-
injector gets a craving, the mind will automatically trigger an 
injection.


BOOSTER SHOTS

EFFECT: Booster shots affect the user as boosted reflexes (see the 
Street Samurai's Catalog) of rating equal to the drug's rating. Booster 
shots are not cumulative with boosted reflexes. Booster shots interfere 
with wired reflexes. Subtract the booster shot rating from the wired 
reflexes rating, for the effective wired  rating. If this is negative, 
Reaction is reduced, and negative dice are applied.

COST: Booster shots originated in Korea, and Japan is trying very hard 
to keep them from reaching the western world. The Japanese government 
does not want boosted reflexes within reach of drug addicts in their 
colonies. Within Korea, Booster shots are less expensive than in the 
Americas.

           BOOSTER SHOT COST
     Rating     Korean     American

       3          400´      1,500´

Unless Japan can stop the flow, American prices will drop to Japanese 
levels within 2 years.

ONSET TIME: One Action. The onset target is the drug's rating+3.

DURATION: (Dosage+2)d6 turns. The duration target is the drug's rating 
+1.

AFTERSHOCK CODE: (2x Rating)D (dosage). If the rating is higher than 
body, the damage is physical.

ADDICTION CODE: (Rating+1)(dosage)2.

ADDICTINO LETHALITY: Deadly.


NOPANE

EFFECT: Nopane reduces the penalty for physical damage by the drug's 
rating. It reduces Reaction and Quickness by rating. Quickness can't be 
reduced below one. If rating is higher than or equal to Quickness, 
Quickness is reduced to one, and the character has a penalty of 1, plus 
rating minus quickness, on all quickness tests.

Cost: Nopane was developed by the UCAS army, and its use has spread 
across the Americas. It is not common in Europe or Asia yet.

             NOPANE COST
     Rating     America     Eurasia

       3         200´     400´

Nopane is very illegal, and possession of Nopane marks the user as a 
seedy mercenary or killer. There are better and cheaper drugs on the 
market (illegal or otherwise) for normal drug-users.

ONSET TIME: Two Actions. The onset target is the drug's rating+2.

DURATION: (Dosage+1)d6 minutes. The duration target is the drug's rating 
+3.

AFTERSHOCK CODE: (Rating+1)M(dosage). The damage is never physical.

ADDICTION CODE: (Rating+1)(dosage)2.

ADDICTION LETHALITY: Moderate.


HUL KALINE

EFFECT: Hul kaline (also known as Conananol or Scharzezine) increases 
the user's strength by causing the body to go into overtime. Hul kaline 
is very debilitating, though not very addictive. Hul kaline increases 
the user's Strength by rating,. It decreases the user's Quickness by 
half rating (round down) and Intelligence by half ratingÊ(round up).

COST: Hul kaline was developed by the Aratech Arcology in the late 30s. 
When Aratech went under, they sold the formula to a consortium of 
military contractors, and Hul kaline is a staple of South American 
subcontractors.

     Rating     Hul kaline Cost
       1            500´
       2          1,000´
       3          2,000´
       4          4,000´

Possession of hul kaline is very illegal in most areas.

ONSET TIME: Four Actions. The onset target is the drug's rating+2.

DURATION: (Dosage+2)d6 turns. The duration target is the drug's rating 
+2.

AFTERSHOCK CODE: (Special)D(dosage). The target number is the drug's 
rating plus half the user's original strength (round up). The damage is 
always physical.

ADDICTION CODE: 2(dosage)2. The addiction code is not dependent on the 
drug's rating. Hul kaline is surprisingly non-addictive.

ADDICTION LETHALITY: Deadly.


SIMSENSE

Simsense is almost exactly like drugs, except that Body is replaced by 
Charisma. Onset time and duration are chip in and chip out, and dosage 
is measured in time.

"Simsense gives you the movie, but with all five senses instead of just 
two. BTL [Better than Life] gives you the same, but pushes the sensory 
signal to the red line. 2XS... hits you at the physiological level as 
well: adrenalin, endorphins, everything."
                                     -- Nigel Findley
                                     Shadowrun 4: 2XS

Some less reputable simsense producers program their chips to degrade 
with use. Of course, even normal simsense will go bad under the typical 
handling it receives. Simsense users are not known for their 
organizational skills and hygiene.

COMMON SIMSENSE: (rating 1 to 3)
AFTERSHOCK CODE: (Rating+1)M2
ADDICTION CODE : (1+Rating)(dosage)1
DOSAGE         : 30 minutes
LETHALITY      : Moderate

Simsense is very much like movies: a sequence of pre-recorded actions 
and scenes. The simsense industry (centered in Hollywood) has directors, 
producers, and actors, just like TriVid.

BETTER THAN LIFE: (rating 1 to 4)
AFTERSHOCK CODE : (Rating+2)S3
                   If rating is greater than willpower, aftershock is
                   physical.
ADDICTION CODE  : (2x Rating)(dosage)2
DOSAGE          : 10 minutes
LETHALITY       : Serious

BTL chips are the scummy side of simsense. The signals are amplified to 
provide a 'better than life' experience. Oddly enough, most BTL chips 
deal with violence rather than sex, although there's usually a sexual 
tint to the violence.

2XS            : (rating 1)
AFTERSHOCK CODE: (Rating+3)D4
ADDICTION CODE : (2x Rating)(dosage)4
DOSAGE         : 1 minute
LETHALITY      : Deadly

2XS is new to the market. It requires a datajack. It must be fed 
directly into the brain. 2XS is so illegal very few people outside of 
illegal simsense users know about it.

INTERACTIVE SIMSENSE: (rating 1 to 3)
AFTERSHOCK CODE     : (Rating-1)L1
                       Level 1 and 2 InSense will not cause aftershock,
                       unless the user has penalties sufficient to bring
                       the target number above 1.
ADDICTION CODE      : (Rating)(dosage)1
                       Rating 1 InSense is not addictive unless the user
                       has penalties to the roll.
DOSAGE              : 30 minutes
LETHALITY           : Light

Interactive Simsense (InSense) allows the user to change the flow of 
action, and make choices. Some insense gives the user a character-eye 
view. Others are like movies. In each case, however, the viewer has the 
choice of what directions to follow.

Insense requires a special computer buffer to interface. Some insense 
won't work without the interface. Others will work as standard simsense, 
providing a pre-recorded sequence of scenes.

It is rumored that FASA Corp, in conjunction with the Collegium for 
Research in Interactive Technologies, is developing a networking 
technology for insense.




SHADOWSPACE

Here are two articles describing aspects of outer space. The first 
describes the barrier between the living Earth and the empty void. The 
second describes what exists beyond the barrier. We at the Guide cannot 
vouch for the accuracy of these reports, nor be held responsible for any 
problems any inaccuracy causes.


THE SPACE BARRIER
              by David Meleedy (dmm@linde.harvard.edu)

What is the barrier? The barrier is a non-typical manifestation of the 
awakening. It is similar to a convection ring, which is caused by mana 
being released in a (typically) traumatic way (i.e. death), and which 
gets trapped at the outer boundaries of earth's domain. Consider that in 
the rules, the earth is described as being one huge spirit. When a being 
dies, the mana is expelled from the body. Mana with no body is at first 
tenuous and is typically near sources of mana that are still bound to 
living, organized matter. In an attempt to preserve itself, the mana 
flees upwards. Soon however, it reaches the outer boundaries of the 
Earth Spirit domain and cannot travel any further because it is not 
powerful enough to traverse beyond the domain in which it was created. 
At this point, the more powerful spirits are able to gather force and 
form, and return as ghosts. Unfortunately, the lesser spirits, are 
subject to entropy and are eventually dissipated at the boundary of the 
Earth Spirit's domain over a long period of time. This vast bubble of 
agitated mana is known as the barrier.

Now, any living magically sensitive creature (including man), that comes 
in contact with the barrier is instantly subjected to the trauma of 
being in contact with the dissipation of thousands of living creatures. 
This is what causes the phenomenon of insanity and death which manifests 
in magicians who pass 50 miles above the earth either astrally or 
physically. In game terms for a magician to survive contact with the 
barrier he must make a Body roll against an (Essence)D1 wound, using his 
base Body score (no spells allowed). What is happening, is that the 
entropic effect of the barrier is attempting to rip the spark of life 
(Essence) from the body of the magically attuned character. The 
character's only defense at this point is the effect of his/her body 
which is attempting to stay alive (hold in the Essence). To avoid 
lasting insanity because of the joining of his mana with that being 
dissipated, he must make a Willpower roll with a target number of his 
magic rating and a threshold of his Essence-1. This is because the 
higher the character's magic rating, the more attuned he is with 
awakened phenomenon. This effect is so powerful that the character's 
mind will become overwhelmed by the environment unless he makes a roll 
to maintain his identity. At this point though, the character has 
already been determined to be alive, and so there is a tenuous link 
already between his body and his Essence, this tenuous link is 
represented by the small subtraction in the threshold number. The 
threshold method was chosen because of its similarity to mind affecting 
game mechanics (i.e. thought control spell, or decking).

Magic which comes into contact with the barrier is subject to the full 
force of its disruptive power. As the weaker spirits dissipate (which is 
most of them) they release their magical energy, which causes a domino 
effect across the upper atmosphere. What this means to a magicians 
spell, is that the magic is dispelled and "washed away" by the tidal 
forces of magical energy that sweep across the edge of the barrier. All 
astral links (yes, Quickened locks too), including those established by 
ritual sorcery are instantly severed. Obviously spells cannot be 
sustained in this environment.

Magic items which are physically carried into contact with the barrier 
will be destroyed unless they make a save of the Force of the object vs. 
a target number of 12. Also, the link between the magician and the item 
is also disrupted unless the item makes a save of its Force vs. a target 
number of the karma invested in the bonding and a threshold of the 
number of items bonded when the barrier was reached. The magical energy 
of a Fetish is automatically destroyed.

Nature Spirits, being restricted by domain, and more intelligent than 
any mage who goes to the barrier, will not come in contact with its 
destructive phenomenon. If a shaman attempts to bring/summon a nature 
spirit to the barrier, he will fail. Elementals are a different matter. 
An Elemental which comes into contact with the barrier must resist 
discorporation with its Force in dice against a target number of the 
number of services remaining times the magic rating of the mage who 
bound it. Should the Elemental survive, the magician must make a Magic 
test (his magic rating in dice) against the Force of the elemental or 
the bond between them is broken, and it will go free. Should the mage 
die or go insane, the spirit or elemental, is obviously free of any 
further obligations. Allies, due to the unique process of their 
creation, are not instantly disrupted by the barrier. However, the mage 
must make a test using his magic rating in dice against twice the ally's 
force or it will go free if it so chooses. (Note that you cannot use the 
magic rating dice supplied to the mage by the ally or use automatic 
successes from an elemental). Whether allies or elementals may pass 
beyond the barrier is currently unknown.

>>>[See the next section. While elementals can pass beyond the barrier, 
they are extremely volatile in the void. It may be possible that allies 
in a physical form will be protected from the void. Our sources are 
unclear on that point. None of them have an ally.]<<<

BEYOND THE BARRIER

ASTRAL PERCEPTION

Anyone viewing the astral plane while in outer space must make a 
Willpower test vs. 6D3/Mental. Anyone who remains conscious after this 
test must make a Charisma test vs. 5D1/Insanity, each turn. Already 
existing insanity is applied as a bonus, not a penalty, to these two 
tests.

SPIRITS

Nature spirits cannot travel into space. If they are forced to do so, 
they lose 1 Force Point per minute. Other planet-created controlled 
spirits (Elementals, Watchers, etc.) must make a Force test vs. 4D1 
every Force days. The spirit does not actually take damage, but loses 
Force points equal to the wound level -- 4 for Deadly, 3 for Serious, 2 
for Moderate, and 1 for Light.

On a largely uninhabited planet, the target number for resisting drain 
from summoning a nature spirit is at +2. On an inhabited but alien 
planet, the target for drain is at +1. When conjuring elementals, 
watchers, and other non-nature spirits on a largely uninhabited planet, 
the staging for drain is increased by 1.

Non-nature spirits can be summoned in space, with a staging for drain at 
+1, but the spirit will not be controlled.

SPACE INHABITANTS

Many strange creatures live in space. There are abandoned, haunted space 
stations, lost, insane wizard ghosts (wizards who tried to astral 
project beyond the barrier), and free spirits. There are rumors, as 
well, of gigantic floating webs in space, and man- or whale-sized 
spiders spinning them. Legends of creatures that thrive on magic cast at 
them, and rumor of a strange nature spirit or elemental whose domain is 
the void. It will take much more exploration before the truth of these 
legends comes out.


INSANITY

Insanity is measured as Light, Moderate, Serious, or Deadly. The penalty 
to target numbers is the same as for normal damage, and is cumulative 
with physical or stun damage. There is no penalty for deadly insanity, 
but such a character can only be a non-player character.

When in a situation where insanity may occur, resistance will be rolled 
with Willpower. Insanity helps keep a character sane: if an already 
insane character makes a willpower test vs. further insanity, the 
insanity penalties are applied as a bonus instead of a penalty.

Insanity heals in a manner similar to mental damage, although rest is 
not required. A Charisma test is rolled. Insanity damage does not apply 
penalties to this roll, but mental or physical damage does. Divide the 
duration by the number of successes. This is the amount of time it takes 
for insanity to drop one level. If there are no successes, the level 
does not drop, and the duration is doubled for the next roll.

Insanity     Duration     Target Number
Deadly       10 days            6
Serious       6 days            5
Moderate      3 days            4
Light         1 day             3

EFFECTS

The exact effects of insanity are left up to the player and referee. The 
style of the game and the situation that caused the insanity should 
dictate how insanity is treated.

Light insanity should involve minor distractions or compulsions. 
Moderate insanity should involve definite compulsions and/or a twisted 
world-view.

Serious insanity will involve occasional hallucinations, paranoia, 
and/or very strange compulsions. Deadly insanity indicates that the 
character is completely insane. Most of the character's time is spent 
with hallucinations. It might involve paranoid delusions and 
schizophrenia, or a complete, non-stable personality switch.

Insanity is not cumulative. However, characters can have multiple 
insanities. Only the penalty for the most serious insanity modifies 
success tests. Each insanity must be cured separately.

A character  might have a deadly psychosis (fear of flying), a moderate 
neurosis (kleptomania), and a light paranoia. Whenever the character is 
in a situation where kleptomania grabs hold, the character has the 
penalty of 2 for moderate insanity. If kleptomania isn't in effect, the 
character has the penalty of 1 for the paranoia (since paranoia will 
pretty much always be something the character will have to worry about). 
Whenever the character's fear of flying takes effect, the character is 
played by the game master, and no penalties are in effect. (Yes, the no 
penalty for deadly does override the real penalties for lesser 
insanities. It's the highest insanity, not the highest penalty, that 
takes precedence.)


A CONFEDERATE CAJUN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
                               Sony-Louis Rollando

The desert sun beat hard from the west. In my right hand, I held an 
Ithaca SA-50. Not standard issue, but I prefer a little surprise. To my 
left, Gary surveyed the area with binoculars. He pocketed them, and 
pulled out an old pair, with glass lenses and no electronics.

"Looks like the zone caught up with us. Does it grow?"

"Could be. Full moon tonight."

I looked at my wristwatch -- a mechanical one, for in the zones nothing 
else worked reliably. Above the watch was a wrist calculator. There are 
no mechanical analogs to that. I punched in 3 + 2. It came up 7.12159. 
We were definitely in the zone. Half an hour ago, 3 + 2 equalled 5. I 
sheathed my gun. At best, firearms in a zone don't work at all. At 
worse, the decreased burn rate builds pressure slowly and explodes the 
weapon.

We went back into the small cave. Gary slept three hours, and I kept 
watch. I saw one snake.

It was 2045. In the east, President Iroff had finally signed the Lee 
Treaty, though the war between the states had really been over with for 
nearly a decade. Not my problem anymore, though. Not since I moved to 
SoCal. I'd been with the Pendleton Franchise for 8 years, and the 
Confederate Army for three years before that, and was just beginning to 
have second thoughts about spending my life as a career soldier. Or 
ending my life as a body shield for whatever renemage tries to earn 
extra pesos hiring out to the Franchise.

No mages here, fortunately. Just a real mental jack who'd decided he 
could hide from the law in a technodead zone. Hell, he'd of been safer 
staying in San Diego. Even then, the law didn't give a damn about some 
minor murderer. All the wigs wanted was to make sure no one thought a 
dead zone was a free zone.

So here I was. Somewhere in the Anzo Borrego. I loosened up with the 
katana before handing the watch over to Gary. In three hours, we moved 
on. I've been meaning to ask a naturalist why there are no dead zones on 
a beach.

Two sleeps later, we found our first trace of him. At first we thought 
he was being clever, setting an obvious trail to lead any one following 
either astray or into a trap. So we move along real careful, like, for 
an hour. Turns out he's not clever, just an idiot. I heard a saying once 
about mad dogs and Englishmen. I've never met an Englishman, but this 
guy was a total cake. Swapped spit one too many times with the dragon. 
He's living in a cabin in the center of a small, flat valley, 
sun baking the rocks like a natural microwave.

Still thinking this guy can't be that crazy, but wondering what it does 
take to systematically track down and kill only redheads whose names 
begin with G, I set up my bow. Adjusted the scope, a mechoid, of course, 
for the estimated distance, and waited underneath an overhang.

In the vids, this is where two soldiers always manage to solve their 
existential problems in a down-home, philosophical discussion. Screw 
that. In the middle of the desert, it's hot, it's dry, the sun stares 
down like an ancient angry god, you don't feel like thinking, let alone 
talking.

So he comes out, probably to take a leak, the poor slob. One arrow and 
he's down, the next, he's good as dead. Gary looks on with the 
binoculars, and tells me when it looks like he's stopped breathing. We 
don't bother to check the body until nightfall. It's not worth leaving 
the cool, and you never know -- he may be faking it. From 300 feet it's 
hard to tell with old optics. But if he lays there in the sun all day, 
it won't matter what he's faking.

The moon rose before the sun disappeared. We came out of hiding, went 
into the little valley, checked the body. He's dead, no doubt. Peek 
inside the cabin, which is still holding in the day's heat, and there's 
nothing there. We left.

At the top of the valley's side, I turn around to take one last look at 
the sucker. And stop. The body was gone.

Like the old chummer used to say, just when things can't get any 
better, they gotta get worse.

Gary saw the same thing. He swore as well. It meant we were going to 
have to track the bastard, or whoever stole him, down. The hot day was 
fast becoming a cold night.

The calculator no longer worked at all. We climbed about fifty feet 
higher than we were, and surveyed the area. The full moon lit the desert 
almost as well as the sun, but our binoculars showed no one nearby -- no 
person, no animal larger than a lizard, the only sign of humanity the 
fruitcake's cabin.

The door swings in the breeze, but I don't feel anything up here. The 
air has that humid, kind of damp, fleshy feel. You've never been in heat 
until you've been in Louisiana in August. Or the Yucatan, I suppose, in 
whatever passes for boiling there. Or even West Africa, from what I've 
heard. But I believe I'm babbling.

And I was. But momma set me right. She always did, that silvery smile, 
bright red hair. But that was the neighbor-girl-next-door. Daddy came in 
from the wars and set his briefcase down, but I couldn't see him over 
the din of the trivideo set. It wasn't for nothing they called us 
inseparable, my sister and eye. Red blood in my I, and a song in my 
heart.

Obviously, something was wrong. Far wrong and way cool. I thought I 
heard thunder in the distance, but it was Gary slapping me back to 
reality. Which wasn't an easy trip with the whore-whore-horehounds 
blowin' in the wind. I steeled myself against his mind, obviously the 
fruitcake's mind was still here in the dead zone, trying to infect us 
with his madness.

Or, perhaps not trying at all. Only a mindless life force, a shell, a 
lifeless mind trapped in the moon, to fade as the moon fades to 
nothingness.

I crouched, and saw the stars, and felt the ground again. Now there was 
a cold wind, and an odd smell in the air.

Gary kicked at someone. The kick should have sent his opponent tumbling 
over the edge. Instead, there was a slurping noise, and I saw his toes 
exit his opponent's back, straight through the liver. A hot smell 
exploded into the air, sun-boiled meat. Gary tried to hold back his 
nausea, and lost. It occurred to me that it was too bad he wasn't a 
redhead, then without thinking I drew my sword and hit whatever it was 
he'd kicked. I saw the thing's face, and it was the nut, and he was 
dead, but he clawed at me anyway. His mouth hung open, and his tongue 
lolled out one side of it.

My sword had cut deep, and I yanked it out, as he clawed at me again. I 
rolled back, and realized why video adventurers always had a shield. 
Steaming water poured out the wound in its side. Gary pounded its back 
with his staff. It staggered forward, but kept its eyes on me as I swung 
the sword back and chopped off his head.

It staggered forward, still clawing, and I thought we were screwed, when 
it just stopped, swooned, and fell. I could still feel the ripples of 
the life force in the air, but it had lost its power.

We didn't rest until we reached the horses the next morning.


LAW OF THE PACK
                                                     by Keith Ammann

The gray October wind blew plastic wrappers up the street and some of 
the brown haze out of the air. The afternoon sky was thick with clouds. 
The street was empty of people except for a thin, white-haired young man 
wearing a respirator mask and a goblin in a tan trenchcoat and spiked 
dog collar. As the thin youth covered his motorcycle with a plastic 
sheet, the goblin stared at the sky.

"So much for today's job-hunt," said the goblin, spitting on the ground.

"Yeah, Arch, like we were goin' anywhere anyway." The young man lifted 
up his respirator and wrinkled his nose. "Man. This rain better wash 
some o' the smog down." The two moved into a nearby doorway and sat down 
on the steps. Thunder rumbled quietly to the west.

"I don't know why you're hangin' around with me, man," said the goblin. 
"You're the one with the diploma. You could be out doin' somethin'."

The human shook his head. "The corps ain't for me, Archie. I can't live 
like that. You gotta give yourself away, man. They don't let you have 
your own life anymore. I'd rather stay on the streets."

"Man, Corin, you always was the spooky one."

Neither one said anything for a while.

"How's your dad?" asked Corin.

"Better. He's finally gettin' the people organized. They're gonna have 
some kind of rally." Archie kicked his heel against the concrete steps. 
"I'm really glad he finally got that promotion. 'Bout time they got an 
ork foreman down there. Might make some real money now."

"You think of applyin' down there?"

"Naw, man. Not on the line."

"Why not?"

"Because..." Archie thought for a minute, resting his chin on his hand 
and rubbing his enlarged lower teeth with his thumb. "Because I wanna be 
someone. Because I want a real job and a real life. I don't want people 
lookin' at me like I'm just another dumb ork with nothin' but muscle and 
attitude. That drek chokes, man."

Corin looked down, then at Archie. "They gonna think that anyway."

Archie sighed. "I know. But down on the line, people fight you to prove 
it. Too much hate there for me, man. I don't wanna get into all that."

"I know what you mean," Corin said. "But you gotta get somethin' 
sometime."

"Yeah." Archie hadn't had a job since he'd left high school. He hadn't 
even gone for an interview since the disaster a year before, when he 
applied for a counter job at the neighborhood Stuffer Shack convenience 
store, hoping that he could eventually make it to manager. Since that 
interview, he'd always found excuses not to go to any others, fearing 
the rejection he was sure he'd receive.

---

"Name?"

"Archie Santangelo."

"How old are you?"

"Nineteen."

"Education?"

"Two years at Jarman High."

"Only two?"

Archie hadn't thought it would be the right thing to say that he'd been 
expelled his junior year for trying to stop a fight between two normals. 
The security guard, seeing Archie shove the larger of the two hard 
against a locker, assumed he had started the fight. For some reason, the 
dean didn't think it was strange that a B student with a clean 
disciplinary record would assault two other kids at once. "That's 
right," Archie said.

"Program?"

"College prep."

"Not vocational?"

The dogs in Archie's head woke up. His voice took a hard edge.

"No, not vocational. College prep."

The interviewer noticed the change in tone and looked up coldly.

Archie had made his first mistake. "What previous experience do you 
have?"

"None yet."

"None yet," repeated the interviewer, as if he had guessed the answer 
beforehand and just been proven correct. "What made you want to work at 
Stuffer Shack?"

"It's near home," Archie replied as Corin had coached him. "I don't have 
a car. I can work night shifts. I know how the stores are organized. I'm 
not afraid of being robbed."

The interviewer smirked. "Do you know what to do in case of a robbery?"

"Don't resist. Get a good look at the robber so you can describe him 
later. Give him what he wants. Hit the Panicbutton as soon as he 
leaves."

The interviewer scowled. He'd expected the ork to say something like, 
"Jump the counter, maul the fragger, and give what's left to the cops." 
Somehow he didn't like the fact that Archie knew the right answer. He 
looked up. "Why the dog collar?"

Second mistake. He'd forgotten to take it off before the interview.

"I just like it."

"Can't wear it on the job."

"I understand."

"We have strict dress codes. You wear the uniform and the hat. No 
scruffy clothes, no street clothes. No dog collars."

"I understand."

"Good." The interviewer looked down again. "Any criminal record?"

"Nope."

"No assaults? No vandalism?"

"I said no."

"Ever stolen from an employer?"

"I told you, I've never been employed."

"You drink? Use drugs or chips?"

"I don't have a jack. And I don't use drugs." The dogs began to growl.

"But you do drink."

"Yeah, some."

"Ever drink on the job?"

Archie jumped up. "Goddamnit, I told you! I haven't had any other job 
yet!"

The interviewer looked up slowly, icily, and closed the folder.

Strike three. "Thank you, Mr. Santangelo. That will be all."

Archie looked open-mouthed at the interviewer. Gradually, disbelief was 
replaced by understanding. "You never intended to hire me at all, you 
bastard. You were just stringin' me along. It's 'cause I'm an ork, isn't 
it?"

The interviewer said nothing.

"Isn't it?"

The interviewer pressed a button on his telecom. "Liz, please show the 
applicant out."

"You goddamn bastard." Archie shook his head and walked wearily out of 
the office, ignoring the girl in the doorway who stared at him vacantly. 
The barking of the dogs was giving him a headache.

---

The clouds finally broke open. A drizzle of pale yellow rain began to 
fall, turning gradually into a steady shower. Archie backed further up 
the steps, pulling his long legs out of the rain's reach. The wind 
picked up. Corin zipped up his heavy black jacket.

"What time is it?" Corin asked.

"Why don't you get a watch?" said Archie.

"Can't afford one, drekhead. What time is it?"

Archie looked. "Quarter after four."

"Guess we're stuck here for a while."

---

The rain continued on into the early evening. When it finally stopped, 
Corin took a sniff, decided the air was safe to breathe again, and 
walked up the block toward his basement apartment. Archie went down the 
block to his own building.

His family was already seated around the dinner table when he got there. 
"Hurry, Archie, your food's getting cold," his mother called as he hung 
his long coat on a peg, picked up his two sisters' coats, and hung them 
up too. He sat down at the table between his father and his younger 
sister, Mary. The dinner was flavored nutrisoy, as usual. No specials 
tonight. He picked up his fork and started shoveling it in. His father 
was talking about the union; they were going to have a rally the next 
night. Archie made interested noises.

"Mommy, can I get a straw?" Mary asked.

"Certainly, honey." Archie's mother got up and went to the drawer that 
had the straws. She and his other sister, Anna, hadn't undergone the 
mutation that affected Mary, him, and their father, making their muscles 
denser and stronger, their frames taller, and their faces frightening 
parodies of normal humans' faces, with slightly pointed ears and 
overgrown lower canines that poked out between their lips. Archie and 
his younger sister had been born that way; their father, he was told, 
changed at puberty. He'd spent three weeks in the hospital, and come out 
more strong and stubborn than ever before. Anna, being fifteen years 
old, was considered beyond risk. She would probably stay human the rest 
of her life.

"Mom, why you gettin' Mary a straw?" Archie said. "She's gotta learn to 
drink from a glass some time."

"Archie, don't be mean."

"I'm not bein' mean, Mom. Mean is gonna be the kids in high school 
askin' why she don't drink out of a glass like everyone else." Mrs. 
Santangelo put the straw in Mary's glass with a resigned look at Archie. 
Mary drank the soymilk. Archie shook his head and returned to his food.

"Find a job today, Archie?" asked his father.

Drek, thought Archie, having hoped that his father would talk about the 
union until dessert. "No, Pop. Got rained out."

"It wasn't raining this morning."

"I wasn't up this morning." Knots formed in Archie's stomach. His 
appetite fled. The dogs howled.

"Why weren't you up this morning?"

"Pop, I'll go out tomorrow."

"Answer me! Why weren't you up looking for a job this morning?"

"Michael, please." His mother's face had a pained expression.

"Paula, stay out o--"

"Pop, I'll go tomorr--"

"Don't shout --"

"You will get up out of --"

"Pop, I will --"

"Can I head over to Rachel's?" said Anna. Her soft, steady voice cut 
through the shouts. The argument lost what little continuity it had.

"Yes, dear, go ahead," said Mrs. Santangelo. Anna got up from the table 
and went for her coat. Archie and his father looked at each other once 
again.

"Archie, hon, if you're not doing anything tomorrow, could you pick Mary 
up from school?" asked his mother before the shouting could begin again. 
The front door opened and shut.

"He's not--"

"Yes, Mom," Archie said. His father scowled angrily. "Pop, I'll check 
the ads tomorrow morning."

Mr. Santangelo glared at Archie, pushed away from the table, and walked 
into the TV room.

---

Archie got up early the next morning, mainly because his father woke him 
up. That day he browsed through the want ads on the newsfeed, made a 
couple of half-hearted phone calls, and didn't write down the 
information he got.

Early in the afternoon, he went out to find Corin. He was hanging around 
on the corner with Martin Megistus, the street magician. Martin was 
popular with all the kids, but only Corin had stayed interested in the 
old man's tricks as he grew up. He said the magician was the real thing, 
and he was learning the stuff himself. Martin had always told Archie he 
had the talent as well, but Archie could never stay interested. Most of 
the things the magician said went over his head. Any time he thought he 
understood something, the dogs would get restless, and he'd lose his 
concentration. Corin could focus his attention on something for hours at 
a time. Archie didn't care about things if he didn't understand them 
right away.

Corin, as usual, was completely wrapped up in what the magician had to 
say. Archie tried to look interested but couldn't. His efforts to get 
Corin's attention away from the magician came to nothing. His "Sayonara" 
as he left barely got a nod. He checked his watch. It was a little after 
two-fifteen. He headed off to pick up his sister.

Archie walked up the drive to the front door of Milton Elementary. He'd 
gone there too, when he was little. The lobby always looked really small 
compared to how he remembered it, no matter how many times he came back. 
Watercolor paintings from the art classes covered the fake-wood- paneled 
walls. Children milled noisily about. Parents bumbled through the crowd, 
calling out, trying to find the ones that were theirs. Carefully and 
gently Archie pushed his way over toward the auditorium doors, next to 
that weird metal thing that was supposedly a sculpture. It had been 
there forever. Corin had always been fascinated by the metal thing, with 
its small, intricate shapes and moving parts. Archie had never gotten 
the point. He craned his neck and scanned the lobby, looking for Mary.

When he spotted her, the dogs started barking in his head. She had been 
crying; there were dark circles under her eyes. A big black smudge of 
dirt covered one side of her new jacket. Her long, brown hair was messed 
up. Forgetting politeness, Archie plowed through the crowd toward his 
sister.

"Mary, tell me what happened."

"No." Her lip trembled.

"Who did this, Mary? Tell me who did this?"

"No." She shook her head.

"Dammit, Mary, what happened?"

"Nothing."

Archie felt ready to explode with frustration. "Come on. Let's get 
home." He took her hand and started walking, too fast, toward the door. 
As they walked out the door and down the drive, Archie's questions were 
answered. A group of human kids, standing at the bus stop, pointed and 
laughed. Archie stopped in his tracks and put a hand on Mary's shoulder. 
"Stay right here, Mary," he said. Mary stood as still as a fence post. 
Archie strode toward the bus stop kids.

"What're you starin' at?" he shouted. "What the hell you think you're 
starin' at?" Most of the children stopped laughing. One whispered, "I 
don't know, but it's u-u-ugly!" Another giggled at that.

"Who said that?" demanded Archie. The dogs strained at their leashes. 
"Who was it? Was it you?" he shouted into on child's face.

The child was petrified. Archie straightened up.

"That," he said with fierce restraint, "is my sister. You hear me? My 
sister. And if I find out that any of you little snots are messin' with 
her again, teasin' her, pushin' her around, callin' her one single 
fraggin' name that's not her own, then I hope you got the bus fare to 
get back from where I'm gonna kick your snotty little asses to. You got 
that? One word! One word and you're meat." The children stood frozen, 
speechless. Out of the corner of his eye, Archie saw a teacher walking 
over. He nodded to her and turned to walk back toward his sister. The 
teacher continued walking, approaching him. He gritted his teeth.

"Can I help you, sir?" the teacher asked accusingly.

Archie turned his head and gestured to his sister. "No, but maybe you 
could start helpin' her. 'Bout time someone did." He shut himself off 
from the teacher, took Mary by the hand, and walked her home without a 
word.

On the way home, his head was full of angry thoughts. He'd only been 
trying to look after his sister, and the teacher -- the same one he'd 
had years before -- had thought he was some sort of criminal. A chill 
wind picked up. The studs of his collar felt cold against his neck. 
Archie hung his head, ashamed of his outburst. He wondered if he could 
actually bring himself to do anything to those kids if they bothered 
Mary again. He wondered if he'd ever be able to live with himself if he 
did. His hand gripped Mary's tightly. The dogs remained awake, watching.

When Archie got home, Corin was waiting outside. "Sorry I wasn't -- " He 
noticed Mary's condition and broke off. What happened? he mouthed.

Archie motioned Corin to come on in. He glanced at the elevator; broken 
again. It's not fair to make a ten-year-old kid walk up four flights, he 
thought. He carried Mary up the steps.

His mother told Mary to go change and wash up. "Mom," Archie started, "a 
bunch of kids were --"

"It's okay, Archie. She's fine. She just needs to get straightened up."

"Mom, she's not fine. The kids are knockin' her around. You gotta talk 
to the teachers there."

"She'll be fine, Archie. She's not hurt. Just a little dirty."

"What if she gets hurt?"

"Archie, don't worry. Everything will be okay." Mrs. Santangelo turned 
and followed Mary.

Archie swung his fist at the air. "Nothing. Not a damn thing I can do."

"C'mon, Arch. 'Sko over to my place." Corin motioned Archie to leave.

They went out the door. Anna was coming up the stairs. "Hoi, Anna," said 
Archie. Corin waved. She smiled at the two and turned into the apartment 
without a word.

Corin walked down the stairs. Archie stomped. "I can't take this 
anymore," Archie said. "Kids pickin' on Mary. Guys at work givin' Pop 
the screws. Pop givin' me hell for not bein' perfect. Day after day with 
nothin' to do. I can't take it."

"Get a job."

"Slot off, man, I'm serious. I am goin' absolutely nuts. I live on a 
street with squatters, chipheads, people with dead-end jobs and 
unemployed bums like us. And there's not a fraggin' thing I can do about 
it! I can't even get a fraggin' job--"

"You tried lately?"

"That's not the fraggin' point!" snapped Archie as they walked out the 
door. "Even if I tried, I wouldn't get nothin'. They're keepin' me out. 
Don't want me. Don't want a fraggin' ork doin' somethin' they could get 
a normal do to. Don't want me nowhere but on the line or on the street, 
where I can't do nothin'. Christ, I gotta do somethin'!"

"What can't you do?"

"I can't change nothin'. I can't stop people from messin' with my own 
goddamn sister. I can't make people see what's goin' on. I start maulin' 
people, what does that do? Nothin'. I'm just what they want me to be 
then, see?"

Corin nodded quietly. "Yeah, I get it."

"I don't wanna hurt no one. I just can't stand to see all this drek 
goin' on around me. I gotta do somethin'. God, they won't even let me 
protect my own goddamn sister."

Corin gave Archie a moment to cool down. "Let's get somethin' to eat, 
man."

"Got no appetite," said Archie.

"You can buy mine, then."

Archie laughed. "You take me to Stuffer Shack, you're meat."

The dogs started barking later that evening. Archie couldn't shut them 
up. They drove him to distraction. As he and Corin approached his 
building, the barking became more and more insistent. Archie stared 
blankly at the building. In his mind, the dogs barked disaster. A 
dreadful intuition overcame his reason. He bolted away, up to the 
building and through the door, bounding up the steps two and three at a 
time, hitting the stairwell wall once as he lost his grip swinging 
around the rail. The dogs barked incessantly. He burst through the 
apartment door without turning the knob all the way, nearly ripping the 
bolt slot from the frame.

His mother sat on the couch, holding Mary. The girl was crying in terror 
and grief, tears streaming down her face, gulping in air and expelling 
it in horrible wails of anguish. His mother sat still, her face pale, 
her eyes sunken, staring straight ahead, mechanically stroking the 
girl's hair. Anna sat on a chair in the dining room, tracing a finger 
around in circles on the table.

"What's wrong?" screamed Archie. "Someone fraggin' tell me what's 
wrong!" His shouting intensified the young girl's crying. His mother 
shrunk back against the sofa. Neither spoke.

The only answer came from the other room. "The Humanis Policlub crashed 
Pop's union rally," said Anna in a melancholy monotone, not looking in 
Archie's direction. "They came with baseball bats and shotguns. They 
said they were there to punish the local that hired goblins as foremen." 
She paused. "They beat Pop to death."

The dogs were going crazy, barking, pulling at their leashes, jumping 
and cursing and yelping in every direction. Archie's head spun.

"They what? Who were they? Who did it?"

"The police broke it up," said Anna. "Pop was already dead. They 
arrested a bunch of them." Anna looked at Archie, a strange, puzzled 
expression on her face. "Mom won't press charges."

"WhaaAAAGGHHH!" Archie had meant to confront his mother, but instead of 
words came an inarticulate roar. His mother's face was devoid of 
emotion, almost devoid of life. She spoke like a ventriloquist's dummy, 
like the words weren't her own and she was only the medium. "I don't 
want any more trouble, Archie. I don't want any more trouble. Everything 
will be all right. It has to be. No more trouble."

In his anger, Archie brought both his forearms down on the end table, 
smashing it into jagged fragments. His mother closed her eyes tightly 
and shook her head. Mary wailed. Anna turned back to staring at the 
table. The dogs broke free, the pack charging off on the hunt. Archie, 
running, followed them out the door, leaping down the stairs. On the 
second flight he turned his ankle painfully as he landed, adding to his 
rage as he stubbornly and unevenly ran down the rest of the stairs and 
out into the street, screaming incoherently all the way.

Corin saw his friend tear out of the apartment building, yelling his 
guts out, loping along with a face that could give a mercenary a heart 
attack, and was struck dumb with shock. Archie never even saw Corin as 
he ran through the streets in agony, flailing his arms, barely 
maintaining his balance. The dogs had been loosed to the hunt. Hunting 
normals. Archie was part of the pack, being driven along with them. The 
pack would find their quarry, and Archie would join them as they chased 
and cornered and tore it to pieces. He charged down the streets with the 
pack, looking for the one that would pay for what normals had done to 
his family.

Suddenly something caught him and he wasn't running, he was falling.... 
His body slammed heavily against the pavement, his jaw scraped against 
asphalt. His hands were torn by gravel. He tried to get up but couldn't 
get his limbs to obey his commands. He was losing the chase. As he lay 
on the ground, screaming pleas to the darkness, the pack charged off and 
left him behind. He collapsed down and sobbed helplessly, unable to do 
anything.

Combat boots appeared next to Archie's head. Corin was kneeling down 
beside him, his face painted with nervousness and every limb shaking. 
"You go-g-gotta ch-chill, Arch," he stuttered out. "You g-gotta t-tell 
t-t-tell me wh-wha-what ha-what happened."

Archie's voice was choked with anguish. "They got away... The fraggers 
got away...."

"Who-who did?"

"They're gonna pay," sobbed Archie. "I'm gonna kill 'em... kill 'em 
all... every fraggin' one...."

"Archie, what are you talkin' ab-bout? You're n-n-n-n--" Corin scrunched 
his eyes shut and bit his lip. "You're... not... going to... kill 
anyone."

Archie's scream tore ruts through the street. "I KNOW!! They'll never 
let me... won't let me defend my own fraggin' family....

Don't you see? All this goddamned drek... I can't do anything... they 
won't let me...."

"Archie, you can't kill anyone. You said it yourself. You can't become 
what they want you to be."

Archie exhaled a deep sob and dropped his head. His forehead hit the 
asphalt, jarring his senses. "I can't be anything," he breathed out. "I 
can't do anything. All I can do is lie here and take it." He paused. 
"All I can do is lie here. Corin, why can't I move my fraggin' arms?"

"My fault, man."

Archie suddenly felt free to move. He sat up dizzily. "What the hell'd 
you do?"

"Somethin' Martin taught me. Said your anger'd run away with you 
someday. Told me to do that if I ever saw it happen."

"Do what?"

"Never mind, man." Corin took a deep breath. "C'mon, let's get you 
cleaned up. You're a fraggin' mess."

"Gimme a sec. My head hurts." Archie lay back down, propping himself on 
his forearms. "I dunno what to do, man. I feel so fraggin' helpless. 
Muscle an' attitude's all I got. Can't use it without becomin' somethin' 
I can't stand to look at. Just another dumb goddamn ork."

"You got a lot more than that, Arch. You know what's right. Lots o' 
people can't see that. And you ain't afraid to stick up for it."

"Doesn't matter. Just a dumb fraggin' ork. Never be anything else. Not 
even good enough for the line...."

"Come on, man, your head works just fine. I can't stand stupid people, 
but I hang with you. You know what's right. You just gotta know how to 
make people listen."

Archie sighed. "I dunno. I just get so fraggin' confused... maybe if I 
just got somewhere where I could think...." Archie fell silent for a 
moment. He looked up at Corin, his eyes narrow. "You think they'd let me 
back into Jarman?"

Corin thought. "Doubt it. Maybe another school."

"Got no car."

"We'll figure somethin' out. Come on."

Corin steadied his friend's arm as he got to his feet. They walked and 
limped up the block. "Hey, Corin," Archie asked, "how come you got so 
many books? You won't buy a TV or a fraggin' watch, but you buy books?"

"You wanna read any of 'em, you're welcome to," Corin said, looking 
Archie and breaking into a small smile. "Knowledge is power."

Neither one said anything for a while.

"The more I think about it... the more it looks as if I've been a cog in 
one thing or another since the day I was born. Whenever I get set to do 
what I want to do, something a whole lot bigger than me comes along and 
shoves me back into place."

THE FUTUROLOGICAL CONGRESS
                              Stanislaw Lem
   translated from Polish by Michael Kandel
          Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1985
     1250 Sixth Avenue, San Diego, CA 29101
      111 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY, 10003

In the world of Shadowrun, altered reality is a way of life. People jack 
in and chip in, using drugs, simsense, BTL, 2XS, and decks. What effects 
will there be when people can control their lives to the extent that 
chips can be controlled?

Stanislaw Lem wrote The Futurological Congress before the advent of 
virtual reality technology, but the drugs that play a major part in this 
work are uncannily similar to chips in 2050 AD. Lem shows us what is 
possible with simsense.

In a society where governments can no longer take care of their 
citizens, they use drugs to create an artificial world. Artists drop out 
of the real world and create their masterpieces in their own private 
world, for their own private pleasure. Companies spring up that create 
custom drugs which allow customers to vent their anger against 
individuals in a non-violent, socially acceptable way.

Lem's writing, as usual, is superb, and he deftly explores the 
ramifications and possibilities of a world where reality is both fixed 
(nature) and fluid (simulated). The Futurological Congress is highly 
recommended to any Shadowrun referee.

SHADOWRUN 4: 2XS
                             Nigel Findley
             Penguin Books, USA Inc., 1992
     375 Hudson Street, New York, NY 10014

The writing in 2XS is awkward, and typos abound. Simply as fiction, I 
cannot recommend this book. It does, however, provide a good look at the 
world of Shadowrun. While general editing was lacking, continuity 
editing seems to have been tight -- everything conforms almost exactly 
to Shadowrun terminology and effects. You can almost see the game behind 
the story.

But only almost. Dirk (the hero) just isn't on the ball. It's surprising 
he's survived this long without getting fragged. We, as readers, can 
tell what's happening to Dirk and his friends before he figures it out, 
even though we're only told what Dirk sees. Are we more pre-disposed to 
strangeness than Dirk would be? Unlikely. Dirk lives in the awakened 
world. The traffic report he listens to warns of octopi climbing onto 
the highway and chomping cars.

If you're a Shadowrun gamer, I do recommend reading this. You get a 
description of simsense (the 2XS of the title) from the user's 
experience. You see a mage/free spirit relationship. And you get a 
nicely described Shadow-mission towards the end. The virtual reality 
descriptions in this book are better, and more useful from a gaming 
standpoint, than those from the story in the Virtual Realities 
supplement.

SPOILER WARNING: This book contains spoilers for the Universal 
Brotherhood.
