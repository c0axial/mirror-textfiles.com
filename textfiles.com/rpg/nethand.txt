                              Version 1.0
                               May, 1993

                          Editor: Joe Delisle

     Welcome to the first release of the Complete.Net.Handbook! It's
taken a while to get everything put together, but I think you'll be
happy with the effort.
      I first started the CNH when I noticed that there were a lot of
net.books available: mage spells, cleric spells, plots, etc, but none
that specifically addressed kits or classes. Having made up several
kits, I decided to create my own net.book. Rather than limit it just
kits and classes, the CNH is the collection of everything that doesn't
have a collection.
     I'm starting the CNH small, including only new character classes,
house rules, kits, and races. But with the first release done, I'm
willing to add on more things that need a collection. If you have
something you want included in the next release, regardless of whether
or not it fits into one of the categories covered by this edition, send
me e-mail to one of the addresses below. I'm especially looking for more
information on monks (for second edition), and new non-magical weapons;
there wasn't enough information to put them in this edition.
     I would like to thank Dana Carrol, who sent me an excellent mapper
program. It's available on the greyhawk.stanford.edu FTP site, in the
/D_D/incoming directory.
     Finally, I'd like to thank all the contributors to the handbook.
Without their wonderful material, this book would be much smaller, and
much less enjoyable. Specifically, they are:

Use no weapons (except for what they make)
Wear no armor of any kind


    Alchemists are believers in magic and technology.  This makes
them a very special subclass of sages (a sub-category of the
"esoteric knowledge" branch).  They are well versed in chemical,
herbal, and metalurgical lore.  They use this knowledge to
manufacture their items.
    Alchemists usually don't go adventuring but can be persuaded
(not too often) or go on their own free will if some sort of
alchemical relic is involved.  They are induced more easily in
going adventuring if they are hired for making, figuring out,
and/or using their items.
    Alchemists acquire experience by using the items that they
made (less for somebody else's), by figuring out items, and
the money they get from services and items sold at a ratio of
10 gold pieces/1 experience point.

  Alchemists can use barbaric weapons (such as swords and the
like) but not get any experience for it.

Wear wear only leather and no shield


    Archers are users of mainly bows (except short swords as
noted) and wear little armor.  They increase their number of bow
shots (noted below) as they increase in level.  They are mostly a
subclass of thief but they hit on the fighters' chart.


     Acquired Abilities:

A. +1 shot/round
B. +1/2 shot/round
C. 1st level thief abilities
D. +1/2 shot/round
E. +1/2 shot/round
F. +1/2 shot/round
G. +1/2 shot/round
H. +1/2 shot/round


    Additional notes:

  Archers may be any alignment but good.
  When archers get thief abilities they go up at a rate of 1
level of ability per 1 level experience.
  Archers get their backstabbing ability with bows when they get
thief abilities.

Use any two handed weapon and any bow or crossbow
Wear any armor up to chain but no shields


    Barbarians are uncivilized warrior types that intensely dis-
like technology or any weapons more complicated than a crossbow.
    They love to fight and get a +3 save vs. fear.  They have a
50% chance to discard their missile weapons and charge in glee.
    They can choose at any time in combat to go beserk, adding 4
to their hit probability but -3 to their armor class.  Once bes-
erk, they will fight blindly for 1 round per level below 20th
that they are, even if the enemy is dead.  There is a 60% chance
for a 1st level barbarian to go beserk uncontrollably.  This
chance is decreased by 5%/level, with a 13th level barbarian
going beserk only by choice.  This chance is rolled at the beg-
inning of every round until the battle is over or the barbarian
goes beserk.
    Barbarians also have a great fear of undead, which they
regard in awe.  Use the table below everytime any undead is
encountered.

    01-60  retreat in an orderly fashion
    61-90  stand fast and fight at -1 (cannot go beserk)
    91-00  retreat in complete disarray


     Acquired Abilities:

A. Hear as a 1st level thief
B. Climb as a 1st level thief
C. Move silently as a 1st level thief
D. +1 to constitution
E. Can "smell" enemies within 25'
F. +1 to dexterity
G. +1 to strength


    Additional Notes:

  Barbarians can only be neutral/neutral or neutral/evil.
  Barbarians can never learn more than 2 languages.
  Barbarians cannot start the game with more than 60 g.p.
  Thief abilities acquired go up at a rate of 1 level/level of
experience.

    Blademasters are fighters that use only swords and become
extremely profficient with them.  As their levels increase, so
does bonuses to hit probability and damage.  All blademasters
belong to the Swordsmen's Guild and must attend a meeting at
least once a month.  The highest level a blademaster can obtain
is 12th.  When the blademaster has enough experience to become
12th level he/she must find the nearest Guildmaster of Swords-
men and fight to the death, the winner being 12th level.  There
are 25 such guildmasters existing, each controlling a 200 mile
radius area.  The guildmaster is in charge of all the guilds in
his/her area.  Also the guildmaster in charge of paying all fees
but gets all the dues.

CHRONOMANCER----
From: TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        A chronomancer is a wizard who specializes in the school of chrono-
mancy.  Chronomancy deals with everything concerning time or one's perception
of it.  Since space/time is one of the least understood things there is, a
character must have an INT of 13 to be a chronomancer.  When one lays his hands
on space/time, he is tampering with the most powerful forces in nature, so
a chronomancer must also have a WIS of 16.  The school of chronomancy is most
closely linked to alteration, but it also contains divination spells (seeing
into different parts of space/time), necromancy spells (death is a significant
event in time), and enchantment/charm spells (changing how time is perceived).
Spells that make permanent changes are much favored and also included.  The
school has few spells, but they tend to be fairly powerful at higher levels.
The barred schools for a chronomancer are abjuration and conjuration/
summoning.
        A character must be a human or elf to be a chronomancer, as half-elves
do not have the unique sense of time that elves do, and gnomes are not adept
enough at magic.  They have a +1 to save against spells of this school and
others save at -1 against these spells when cast by a chronomancer.  Elves
can advance to 15th level.
        At 17th level a chronomancer can withdraw once per day as per the 2nd
level priest spell.  He can tell you with 95% accuracy what time of day it is.
If he fails the check, he is off 5 minutes for every number over 95.  Since
this ability depends on the positions of the sun, moon, stars, along with the
tides and weather patterns, being underground reduces the accuracy.  Every day
spent underground reduces this chance 10%.  Every day spent above ground
improves this chance again 15% per day up to 95%.  At 20th level he gains an
additional +1 to his saves vs. chronomancy.  From now on, they do not experience
the aging side effects of certain spells.
        Chronomancers, as a group, tend towards neutrality moreso than any
other group of wizards.  They know that time is largely unaffected by the
actions of the petty doing of mere mortal creatures, so they just sit back and
let it roll by.  If anything there is a slight tendency towards law and good
because they create less disturbance, but most are still at least partially
neutral.
CHRONOMANCY SPELLS
1st:    Cantrip, Lasting Breath, Sleep
2nd:    Continual Light, Death Recall, Forget, Past Life
3rd:    Delay Death, Haste, Slow
4th:    Dimension Door, Extension I, Mordekainen's Celerity, Rary's Mnemonic
        Enhancer, Replay*
5th:    Extension II, Stone Shape, Teleport
6th:    Contingency, Death Spell, Extension III, Legend Lore, Mordekainen's
        Lucubration, Permanent Illusion, Reincarnation
7th:    Delayed Blast Fireball, Dramij's Instant Summons, Finger of Death,
        Limited Wish, Reverse Gravity, Teleport without Error, Vanish
8th:    Permanency
9th:    Chain Contingency, Temporal Stasis, Time Stop

        Replay is a new spell of my own for the chronomancy school.  Only
chronomancers may learn it.  Other spells (perhaps adapted from the new
priest sphere of Time, but go easy on this) could easily be created for this
school.  Time is a big subject to deal with.  Replay is rather closely related
to the wild magic spell Alternate Reality.

Replay
Range:  0       Components:  V,S        Duration:  Instantaneous        CT:  4
AoE:  the caster        Saving Throw:  None
        This spell has two versions, which I call the combative and
investigative versions.
        In the combative version, the caster causes the events of the last
round to come undone for him.  He gets to re-do the events of the previous
round, re-rolling damage inflicted or saving throws, or anything else that
depends on chance.  For instance, let's say Rummo the chronomancer just cast a
fireball but did miserable damage (hardly fazed his opponent) and later that
round got hit by a blindness spell and missed his save.  In round two he casts
a Replay and can re-roll the damage of his fireball and try again to save
versus the blindness.  If a successful check is made on d20 against half his
intelligence he can even change his actions of the previous round.  For
example, Rummo realized that casting his fireball at that red dragon wasn't
too smart.  In round two he casts Replay.  If he successfully rolls a d20
under half his intelligence he can decide to cast a cone of cold instead, or
some other spell.
        In the investigative version the caster gets a renewed clarity of the
past up to a number of minutes or rounds equal to his level.  In essence this
allows the DM to remind the chronomancer of pertinent details in recent
happenings that have been overlooked.  In this reverie he remembers only things
that he actually did witness in that time.  For example, if Rummo is 10th
level the DM can remind him of details that he's seen in the last 10 minutes
that he might not have paid attention to, or saw out of the corner of his eye,
or heard faintly but ignored.  The DM should be careful not to give too much
away, however.  If the sound was too faint or the object too small to be
witnessed normally at that time the chronomancer cannot enhance it through use
of this spell.  He just remembers more fully and with more clarity.

DEATH MASTER----
From: TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        Yes, this is a remake of the 1st ed. NPC class (weren't NPC classes
just the dumbest idea?)
        Death masters may start as any alignment but every even-numbered level
roll d10.  1 means he moves one step towards chaos, 2-3 means he moves one step
towards evil.  These alignment changes do not incur XP penalties.  If the
character commits acts that vary from his alignment in the direction of law
or good, the DM can warrant rolling a smaller die, with 1's and 2's having the
same effect (penalizing the death master for being too goodie-goodie).  This
would cause alignment penalties to XP.  The character may also of his own
volition become more evil or chaotic.  This incurs XP penalties also.  If, when
rolling, the die comes up 1 and the character is already as chaotic as
possible, ignore it.  Likewise for rolls of 2 and evil.  The DM should keep
the player informed of his alignment (at least advise him when it's changed)
so that he can play the character more efficiently.
        Death masters must have a 9 STR, 12 DEX, 14 CON, 16 INT, and LESS THAN
AN 8 CHA!  They must also be human AND MAY NOT EVER DUAL-CLASS!
        Weapons allowed:  knife, dagger/dirk, sickle, scythe, whip, scourge,
scimitar.  May use any magical version of these except flame-tongue scimitars.
When touching aligned weapons treat him as chaotic evil.  If he touches some
weapon more evil or chaotic than he actually is, he takes no damage and an
alignment check (on d10, as above) must be made right then and there.  He
takes no damage for touching CE weapons.  Otherwise he takes 2x the ego damage.
        Armor allowed:  none and no shields.
        Magic:  may learn any of the following wizard spells to be transcribed
into his spellbook (must follow the same rules as a mage for learning and
casting spells):  all Necromancy, as well as low-level (3rd and less)
abjuration, invocation/evocation, and conjuration/summoning.  Also divination
(up to 4th).  Can only use rings, rods, staves, wands, and other magic that
concerns death, undead, or protection (and absolutely none that concern fire
unless it is directly related to one of these--a wand of fireballs is not
allowed even though it's probably used to cause death--a wand of corpse
cremation would be OK).  Spells of Elemental Fire are a no-no, regardless of
school.
        Psionics:  they have the following psionic powers (and these only, no
extra wild talents):  life draining (and 11 PSP's) at 4th level, aging (and 8
PSP's) at 5th level, death field (and 13 PSP's) at 13th level.  Beginning at
4th level they gain 3 PSP's per level (they do not get PSP's for the levels
they already have).  Using these powers does NOT make them more evil--it's
natural for a death master to explore these areas.
        Abilities:  can identify a potion of undead control by tasting a single
drop--they get twice the effect and duration
        they can command unintelligent undead (skeletons, zombies) as an evil
cleric of equal level (they do not have to be evil)
        at 4th level they can speak with intelligent undead telepathically
        at 7th level they may speak with dead as cleric of the same level, with
out the spell, once per day
        at 9th level they are immune to undeads paralysis and holds
        at 11th level they save vs. death to avoid undeads level draining
        at 18th level they can command any undead as a cleric of half their
level (they do not have to be evil)
        they learn necromancy spells at +10% chance, other spells at -25% chance
        they can research necromancy spells as if they were 1 level less
difficult for the purposes of time and expense
        Followers:  henchman must be evil and human, hirelings cannot be more
good or lawful than the death master currently is
        If a 13th or greater level death master is killed on Orcus' Feast
(Halloween) he is animated by Orcus as undead (because he will eventually come
to worship Orcus).
        Death masters save and fight as wizards, unless noted otherwise.

Use any kind of weapon
Wear any kind of armor


    Demon/devil/undead hunters, easier known as D/D/U hunters,
are mainly a religious class.  They show considerable amounts of
respect for the gods they choose.  Often they will donate large
sums of treasure to the temple of their god.  This class can show
no contempt of evil types, such as demons, devils, and undead as
the name states.  The D/D/U hunter gets bonuses on the following
evil types: demons,devils,undead,evil clerics, and evil magic-
users.  Until they reach a certain level, D/D/U hunters do not
have to save vs. fear except from greater devils,demon princes,
gods, etc.  They have a 50% base chance to attack evil -5%/
level.  They also hate barbarians, but they get no attack bonus.


     Acquired Abilities:

A. Detect demon/devil/undead/evil within 90' and attacks "evil"
   at +1
B. Detect magic once a day
C. Cure light wounds once a day
D. Protection from evil 10' radius once a day and attacks "evil"
   at +2
E. Remove curse once a week (as the spell)
F. Totally resistant to all fear
G. +3 on all saves vs. evil creatures, +1 vs. magic, and attacks
   "evil" at +3
H. Bless once a day
I. Detect charm or posession 75% chance
J. Exorcise once a week
K. Save vs. everything at +1 and attacks all "evil" at +4
L. +3 to armor class (blessed by the gods)
M. Cure critical once a day and attacks "evil" at +5


    Additional notes:

  D/D/U hunters *MUST* be lawful good.
  D/D/U hunters will give at least half of all treasure obtained
(excluding magic items) to the temple of their god.

Use only rapier, dirk, and composite bow
Wear no kind of armor


    Dirksmen are a combination fighter-thief, mostly fighter,
that use rapiers and dirks.  Rapiers do 1-8 1-8 damage and hit as
a long sword while dirks do 1-3 1-4 damage and hit as a dagger.
The amazing thing about these weapons is that they get both
dexterity and strength bonuses on them.  Dirksman increase their
number of swings as they increase in level, not to hit and damage
bonuses.  Dirksmen wear no armor but their base armor class de-
creases as levels increase (dexterity bonuses do count).

  Dirksmen do not get the backstabbing bonuses with bows.
  Thief abilites for a dirksman go up at a rate of 1 level/3

Use any one weapon
Wear any kind of armor up to studded leather and shield


    Experts are fighters that choose one weapon type to use for
all time.  For example: at the start of the game the expert
chooses a 2 handed sword.  The only weapon he can use and get
experience with is a 2 handed sword (he/she could use a long
sword but not get any experience).  The expert, however, can use
any 2 handed sword with no problem (if a magic one is found).
The expert gains to hit and damage bonuses as levels increase.

HEALER-----
From: TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        A healer must have at least a 9 CON, 14 INT, and 13 WIS.  Prime req's
are INT and WIS; a 16 or better in these two areas gains 10% bonus exp.  A
healer must be smart enough to know certain doctoring skills, wise enough to
make tough judgment decisions related to his duties, and tough enough to stand
the conditions he will be subjected to.  Character race may be dwarf, elf,
gnome, halfling, or human (half-elves have problems with their weird anatomy).
Multi-classing is not possible, although dual-classing always is.  Healers may
not be of any evil alignment.
        Healers may not use any edged or pointed weapons other than knives,
daggers, and dirks.  They have taken up this profession because they highly
respect life; taking it for no purpose sickens them.  Only in extreme circum-
stances will a healer take an intelligent life, although he will defend himself
and his compatriots.  They realize the necessity of hunting, and killing
animals for human use raises no qualms with them.  They always make weapon
attacks last unless hasted (or the enemy is slowed) when they may roll
initiative normally.  Healers may never wear armor that is entirely metal (any
chain but elven, any plate, scale, etc) for this hampers their ability to
rush to the aid of comrades or others that need attention.  Shields are
allowed.  They may use any magical armor of a type allowed them as well as
any magical defensive items.  When healers do enter melee they get a +2 to
damage simply because they know where to hit.
        Healers advance in the following fashion (with a few exceptions):  a
healer is equivalent to a priest 2/3 his level, rounded normally; he is
equivalent to a wizard of half his level, rounded down; he is equivalent to
a psionicist of half his level, rounded down.  For example, Marcus the
halfling is a 7th level healer.  He has spells like a 5th level priest, a 3rd
level wizard and PSP's like a 3rd level psionicist.  For the most part,
healers are restricted to healing and protective powers.  They must follow
the normal rules for acquiring spells and powers (praying, studying from spell
books, etc).  They are hesitant about using powerful magicks obviously
contrary to their alignment (animate dead, destruction, etc).  Healers may
use rod/staves/wands or healing or protection, or any other that may not
be used offensively.  Healers can use scrolls and other miscellaneous magic
allowed to either priests or wizards.  Healers do not need a holy symbol to
cast priest spells.  If some magical effect affects mages and priests
differently, the effects should be merged into something between the two to
be applied to healers.  Since healers do not have to meet all the ability
requirements for being psionicists use the following table (an extension of
Table 5 in The Complete Psionics Handbook) for PSP's:

Ability Score   Base Score      Ability Modifier
        13          13             0
        14          17             0

        Healers have healing proficiency as a bonus.  This should be allowed
them even if the proficiency rules aren't used.  They must also choose
herbalism by 3rd level.  A person under the care of a healer heals at 3 times
the normal rate, 2 times if engaged in nonstrenuous activity or traveling (4
times and 3 times if he also has herbalism, see below).  If nonweapon
proficiencies are used, characters under the care of a healer have a +3 to
their save vs. poison (see healing proficiency, 2nd Ed. AD&D Players'
Handbook).
        They can turn undead as a cleric of 1/3 their level, rounded down.
This is because even though they are not clerics, healing deities show special
favor on them (doctors should be fairly spiritual people, after all that's how
they're getting their spells in this system).  At 10th level level-draining
attacks do not affect healers beyond normal hit point damage, if they
successfully save vs. death magic.
        Healers are NOT clerics of a healing deity.  Clerics of a healing
deity are out to serve their god, and they do it by healing people.  Healers
are out to heal people, and they do it by praying to get spells (and some
other stuff, too).  They are people concerned with the physical welfare of
others.  They will study and use any method that can possibly help them do
better in their chosen role.  Healers may find a deity of healing such as
Apollo appropriate to be worshipped, however, and they must worship some
deity to turn undead.  At 3rd level they can detect slimes, molds, jellies,
and fungi (not type, just presence) at a distance of 40' by concentrating
one round (can scan one quadrant per round--scanning 360 degrees takes 4
rounds).  At 8th level the healer can brew non-magical healing potions that
cure 1d(die closest to healer's level, but not more than 12) per flask drunk.
Brewing is slow, no more than 1 flask per week can be brewed.  At 14th level
their desire to help life is strong enough that they can survive on the Pos.
Mat. Plane without being consumed by the life-giving forces there.  At 17th
level their ties to the Pos. Mat. Plane are strong enough that they can
survive on the Neg. Mat. Plane.  If survival from elemental forces is taken
care of, these powers allow existance on the Pos. and Neg. quasi-planes, also.
        Healers have a base 10% chance to read languages that increases by
5% per level to a maximum of 95%.
        Healers get 1 XP for every hit point healed by proficiency or spell
use.  They get XP equal to twice the max hps of any character they raise from
death in any manner.
        Healers make saves on the priest's scale with a +3 vs. paral/pois/d.
magic.
        Dwarves are restricted to 11th level and cannot learn wizard spells
of greater than 1st level strength (stopping wizard advancement at healer level
5).  This is due to their nonmagical nature.  Halflings can advance to 12th
level, with the same wizard spell restrictions as dwarves.  Gnomes can get to
14th level and 2nd level wizard ability, stopping wizard advancement at healer
level 9.  Elves can work up to 17th level, but cannot advance in psychic
powers past healer level 6.
        At tenth level healers attract 1d6 first level healers as understudies,
provided that he's built some kind of clinic.  He may build the clinic before
10th level but doesn't get followers for it then.  They also attact 1d3 mage/
thieves of 1st level ability in each class.  Dwarves has a 75% chance to
attract psionicist/thieves instead of mage/thieves.  50% of the time these
followers are of the same race as the healer.
        A healer's primary reason for adventuring will probably be to look
for new treatment methods and rare herbs, tending the unfortunate sick along
the way.  And treasure troves are good for financing clinics and finding old
tomes with healing recipes.
        It was mentioned before that healers cannot be evil.  If one does change
to an evil alignment (intentionally or not) he loses all ability to affect
undead, all saving throw bonuses for being a healer (except vs. poison), but
they gain a +2 to save vs. acid.  They can brew poison instead of healing
potion.  They gain Neg. Mat. Plane survival at 13th level but never get Pos.
Mat. Plane protection.  Normal alignment change penalties apply, of course.
All healers start as non-evil.  Evil healers are called leeches (since they
like to use them more than healers) and may use polearms and scythes.
        Remember, this is just a guide.  Extraordinary circumstances may
dictate atypical behavior, as may historical events in the character's life.
The key to having fun with any character is the quality of the role-playing,
which may be tough with a class like this. (Who said being a doctor was easy?)

HOLY FIGHTER

From: brunborg@alkymi.unit.no

Ability Requirements:   Strength 17
(before racial adjustments)
     Constitution  14
     Wisdom 14

Prime requisite: Strength
                 Wisdom

Races allowed: All (Optional: only demihumans)


The Holy Fighter is a warrior, much like a paladin, under direct command of
the church. He is not bound to LG alignment, but must have the same alignment
as his deity. He uses the XP progression of paladins. He may use all types of
armor, but is restricted in his choice of weapons. A Holy Fighter may only be
multi- or dulaclassed if that is for the good of the church (a Holy
Fighter/Speciality Priest combination should not normally be allowed).
The Holy Fighter is as strongly bound to his church as the paladin.

The Holy Fighter must always seek to further the belief of his deity. A CE
Holy Fighter of grief and pain must always cause as much pain and grief as
possible, and a CN Holy Fighter of thievery may very well be a multi- or dual
class thief. A N Holy Fighter must fight to keep the balance, etc...
Use the guidelines for the Speciality Priests when deciding this.

If the Holy Fighter ever comits an act knowingly against the interests of his
deity, he loses all powers _and_ one level of experience. This level may not
be restored by a "Restoration" spell, but may be regained in the normal
fashion. The lost powers may only be regained if the deity wants, and that is
concidered very unlikely, as the character has shown himself unworthy.
If he comits such an act unknowingly and/or unwillingly, he must seek a
priest of the same deity as soon as possible and atone.

The Holy Fighter has the following benefits:

    May specialise as a normal fighter in his god's preferred weapon(s).
    (A Holy Fighter of Thor is probably specialised in warhammer.)

    Upon reaching 4th level, he may call upon the power of his deity to aid
    him in combat. The Fighter may only do this once per day, and may not
    do anything else the round he calls for this aid. The call is not
    disturbed if the Fighter recieves damage. The Aid starts at the very
    start of the next round.
    The power manifests itself as a "Prayer"-spell, with the duration of 2
    rounds per level of the Fighter.

    For every 4th level attained, the Holy Fighter must attain a quest to
    prove himself worthy.

      The first quest, at 4th level, will, if successful, grant him a Special
      Mount (as for Paladin).

      The second quest, at 8th level, will give him a +2 weapon, with the
      alignment of his Deity and 1d3+3 curing spells of level 1-2.

      The third quest, at 12th level, will give him a +4 weapon, with the
      alignment of his Deity and 1d6+4 curing spells of level 2-3.

      The 4th quest, at 16th level, will grant him a Holy Avenger-type weapon
      of uniqe design.

      The spells of the first two weapons may be recharged by a Speciality
      Priest of 12th level or greater.

      These weapons are not given to the Fighter from the Church, but placed
      at the end of the adventure by one minion of the deity (at 8th and 12th
      level) or by the deity himself (the Holy Weapon). The spell functions
      of the weapons work only when the Holy Fighter is using the weapon.
      Furthermore, if the weapons are used by any other character, they lose
      one "plus" (the two first) or is a +2 weapon (the Holy Weapon)
      If the Holy fighter fails in one of these quests, he may try again
      after advancing at least one level.

      These quests should be modified by the DM to fit the level of magic in
      his campaign. The exact powers mentioned here are mere suggestions. If
      he feels that the Holy Fighter should not get these weapons at these
      specific levels, or get them at all, he may modify the levels and/or
      the wereabouts of these weapons.

    The Holy Fighter is immune to all diseases upon reaching 5th level.

    Holy "Preferred Weapon" gives basically the same benefits as Holy Sword
    for paladin, but the powers that depends on alignment (protection, +10
    damage, etc.) works only vs. Holy Fighters, paladins or priests of an
    enemy deity (Ex: Holy Fighter of Thor vs. a Frost or Fire Giant
    Shaman).

    The DM in encouraged to design new Holy Weapons for these fighters. A
    "Hammer of Thunderbolts" would be a nice base for "Holy Hammer of
    Thor", and to balance it all perhaps lower the MR rate.

    Cast priest spells from the war and combat spheres upon reaching 9th
    level (use spell progression for paladins, no bonus spells for high
    wisdom).

    He attracts a body of fanatic elite soldiers upon reaching 9th level.
    (If he has a stronghold, that is.)
    To decide what units he attracts, use the "Elite Units"-table on pg. 27
    of the PH, or design your own.

    Upon reaching 9th level, he recieves a power called "Enhance Weapon".
    This power adds +1 one weapon of the Fighter's choice. The weapon may
    only be used by the fighter. If anybody else use it while this power
    is in operation, the duration expires. This power have a duration of
    2 rounds/level, and may be used only once per day.


The Holy Fighter has the following restrictions:

    May only be proficent in his deity's preferred weapon(s).

    May not posses more than 8 magical items, any items exeding this must
    be given to the church.

    He must give all his incoming money, gems and art (exept maximum 20 gp
    of cash per level) to the church, who will pay for his equipment. He
    may borrow money from the church to pay for expences on missions that
    further the belief and attitudes of his deity. Abuse of this confidence
    will cause loss of all XP for the adventure. The churh will help him
    build a stronghold when they feel the time for that has come.

    May only employ NPC's of same alignment and, as far as possible, of the
    same faith.


I would like to thank Ronald E. Kijewski (kijewskir@pgate.boeing.com) for
helping me tuning the Fighter in.

Use any kind of weapon
Wear any kind of armor

    Knights, for the most part, are minor paladins.  They need
less to change levels, but do not get as many abilities.  Their
nature is the same being do-gooders and helping out people at
almost every opportunity.  The notes above say that knights can
use any weapon and wear any armor but favor plate armor and 2
handed swords (the reason being is that they get +1 a.c. and +1
on to hit and damage respectively).


     Acquired Abilities:

A. Make all saves at +1
B. Cure light wounds once a day
C. Track as a ranger at 50% base chance + 3%/level
D. Make all saves at +2
E. Detect enemies within 60'
F. Cure light wounds twice a day
G. Detect magic at 20% base chance + 5%/level
H. +1 hit prob., damage, and parry on any one weapons (+2 on
   2 handed swords)
I. Detect illusions at 20% base chance + 2%/level
J. Cure light wounds thrice a day, and receive a kingdom (must
   first fulfill a quest to the king that originally knighted
   the character).


    Additional notes:

  Knights, of course, must be lawful good.
  Knights strongly worship their gods and the same evil actions
taken by a knight is subject to the same discrediting as a
paladin.

    Ninjas are the oldest order of spies.  They are profficient
in the ways of disguise, espionage, concealment, assassination,
and very profficient in martial arts.  Ninjas gain special abil-
ities that pertain to the 4 elements; earth, wind, water, and
flame, plus ninjas believe in a fifth element, ku, which they
consider to be what binds all the other elements together (per-
haps this could be considered the ethereal plane).  They are al-
so very similar to monks because of their knowledge in the mar-
tial arts.

 6. body control as per psionic ability
 7. mind bar as per psionic ability
 8. E.S.P. as per magic-user spell
 9. telempathic emotion as per psionic ability
10. ku, which is the special ninja ability to place his/her
    mind and body in ku.  What happens is their body molecules
    break their bonds but retain their respective positions,
    making the ninja a "spirit".  In this state nothing may con-
    tact the ninja and visa-versa.  Finally the ninja can move
    only at half speed.  This ability can be used once/week and
    lasts for 5 + 1 round/level for 5 rounds minimum.

Additional notes:

  Ninjas must be lawful and cannot be good.
  Ninjas will not tell their occupation but only to their best
friends.
  Ninjas will not go back on their word.
  Ninjas in effect get 10 psionic points/level when ways of the
mind are achieved to determine duration and other factors.
  Ninjas may use poison.
  There are only a limited number of ninjas starting at 10th
level.  There are 9 at 10th and from then on there's 5 at 11th,
4 at 12th, etc. up to 1 at 15th.  Like monks, the character must
fight the ninja (or any one of the ninjas) that already occupy
that level.  This fight is performed honorably (no dirty stuff)
and will be decided by the challenged ninja whether it will be
fought by hand or with weapons.

Use only thief weapons
Wear only thief armor

    Outlaws are a thief subclass.  As noted above, they use thief
weapons and armor bur they get some special abilities that
thieves do not get.  The character choosing this class is not
necessarily a breaker of the law initially but must become one to
achieve 10th level.  One problem with this class is that the law
is always giving outlaw types a hassle.  Even if the outlaw isn't
doing anything wrong, they can still get arrested and have very
bad times in court (usually winding up guilty even if totally
innocent).  Outlaws get normal thief abilities also.



     Acquired Abilities:

A  Evade at 25% base chance +5%/level and 50% base chance of
   getting true or near true rumors every hour
B. Add 2 languages learned and track as a ranger at -2 levels
C. Gain the ability to use any weapon
D. Detect poison 50% base chance + 5%/level
E. Gain the ability to use magic-user scrolls with 15% chance of
   backfire
F. +1 to strength and +1 to dexterity
G. Add 2 languages learned


    Additional notes:

  Outlaws can be neutral at best.
  Outlaws cannot use holy water.

Use only staves and daggers

    Psychics are naturally psychic beings.  Being of this nature,
they get a 20% bonus when rolling for psionics at the start of
the game.  If they don't get psionics at the start, they roll
once per increase in level (normal roll) until they do get it.
Psychics tend to be "out of it",  thus acting dreamily, but still
semi-aware of what's happening.  Even if psychics do not have
regular psionics they still acquire minor and major devotions.
The psychic gets psionic points to work these devotions depend-
ing on the intelligence and the level of the character:


         Int.               Pts./level
          16                    4
          17                    5
          18                    6
          19                    7
          20                    8

    Should the psychic have normal psionics, he/she still
receives points in the above manner as a bonus.  These bonus
points are divided by 2 and added on to attack and defense
strengths.
    Psychics are not very good fighters.  They hit on the
magic-users' table but at -2 to hit.

    Rune weavers were the original magic-users, learning their
craft from the reptilian races of eld.  Their magic, however,
is lengthy in its conjuration (taking 50% longer rounded up).
    Rune weavers may cast spells higher than they currently have.
When trying to cast a spell 1 level higher than normal there is a
30% chance of failure.  When trying 2 levels above normal there
is a 90% chance of failure.  If failure occurs use the following
chart:
         01-50  nothing happens
         51-85  goes off in random direction at partial strength
         86-99  boomerangs back onto spell caster
          00    spell goes off as planned


     Acquired Abilities:

A. 100% chance of dispell magic (takes 1 round/level of magic)
B. 100% chance to fully identify any magic item (20 rounds)
C. can transport rune weaver and up to 4 people to any plane of
   existance
D. can banish any creature to its original plane of its existance
   (creature cannot return to plane banished from for 1 year)


    Additional Notes:

  Rune weavers can be any alignment.
  Rune weavers can use their special abilities only once a day
unless otherwise noted.

    Sages are characters devoted to learning.  They are well
versed in history, natural sciences, and languages.  They are
intermediately acquainted with all aspects of books, scrolls,
and manuscripts.  As they increase in level, they increase their
limits in the fields that they choose to work with.  Sages also
seek out all things that they might feel would increase their
knowledge in such fields, thus being easily persuaded into going
adventuring.
    Sages, like alchemists, are hired for their knowledge and
abilities to find out and get information on certain things.
Thus, sages get 1 experience point/10 gold pieces made.
    As the sage increases in levels, he/she chooses the categor-
ies that is wanted and the amount of knowledge the sage wishes
to have devoted to such fields chosen.  The sage gets to start
out with 3 categories and 30 percent points to divide up among
these categories.  Then, at every increase in level, the sage
can choose 1 more category and gets 20 more percent points to
divide among the rest of the categories.

    Acquired Abilities:

A. Sage receives set of books from teacher to add to knowledge
   of categories (determined by D.M.)
B. Sage can add to abilities by means other than reading (i.e.
   talking, witnessing, etc.)
C. Can instantly tell what form of language is being spoken,
   is written, etc.
D. Sage receives second set of books from teacher (as above)
E. Can obtain information from local sage at either discount
   or can trade information for information

This class does not have a large number of spells in each book,
but only the most necessary are chosen.  Shamans use daggers at a
bonus of +1 to hit.

Use bows and crossbows (also what they make)
Wear no armor (except special armor they make)


    Technos are specialists that initially disbelieve in magic
100% and work from a strictly scientific point of view.  They are
constantly dismembering dragons to see where the flamethrower
was hidden.  They initially don't trust magic-users and grudg-
ingly tolerate clerics.
    Since technos' views and equipment is so much different than
that of everybody else's, they are often ridiculed or held in
belief as being something "evil".


     Acquired Abilities:

A. 75% base chance + 5%/level of figuring out mechanisms (clocks,
   crossbows, mechanical traps, etc.)
B. 25% base chance + 5%/level of detecting mechanical traps,
   ability to build better bows, and beginning architecture
C. ability to build even better bows, build better armor, and
   25% base chance + 5%/level of detecting structual weak points
D. intermediate architecture, beginning chemistry, build best
   bows, beginning biology, and build even better armor
E. advanced architecture, intermediate chemistry, build best
   armor, intermediate biology, and beginning electronics
F. advanced chemistry, advanced biology, intermediate electron-
   ics, simple costruction, and beginning physics
G. advanced electronics, intermediate construction, and inter-
   mediate physics
H. advanced construction and advanced physics
I. +3 to intelligence, +2 to wisdom, ability to believe and

J. can continue to keep advancing in any of the previous fields
   mentioned (biology, chemistry, etc.)

               giving the ability to bind wounds on anyone (or
               thing) for 2d.8 + 1 point/level, cure natural
               diseases, and +2,+3 on all attacks (knows how ner-

               gravity (magnetism)
cont.fields....the techno can pursue knowledge in any of the
               fields available but must tell the D.M. what
               aspect of what field he/she attempts to pursue
               and what the techno expects to gain from such
               knowledge
    Additional Notes:

  Technos may be any alignment.
  Any kind of cure or heal done on a techno has a 50% chance of
not working due to the disbelief the techno has concerning
divine beings (this changes in time).

TECHNOLOGIST----
From: TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        Master of technology, such as it is.  Dwarves are the true builders and
craftsman, advancing to 13th.  Gnomes, however, like to tinker (no, I made this
up before I ever heard of Krynn) and putter around, advancing to 14th.  Elves
think it's interesting but don't take it very seriously (10th).  Must have a
14 INT and 13 WIS.  High DEX and STR are also useful.
        They are allowed weapons that have some degree of complexity in their
use or manufacture:  arquebus, battle axe, bow (any), crossbow (any), dagger,
hand axe, mancatcher, sickle, sword (any).  They can use any armor of a type
that they have proficiently made (in the time of the campaign, things made
before don't count) because they've spent enough time with that type to know
it fairly well.  To use an 'across-the-board' magical protective device such
as bracers or a cloak they must roll successful WIS *and* INT checks, or they
are never allowed to use that type of device.  A generous DM may allow new
checks for times when the character's INT or WIS is boosted.  They may
specialize in one weapon of a type they have proficiently made and get the
bonuses with that type of weapon.  However they do not get the attack/round
bonus that all warriors get without having to specialize.
        A technologist will, of course, try to do a service to everyone by
attempting to get them to use his devices more often.  However, most people
will be distrustful of this technology, and won't use it.  You should not
allow the technologist character to totally reshape the world!  Only in
extreme circumstances should his devices be accepted and used for any length
of time (even the scientist gets to save the day!).  An example of this would
be where he saves a starving village by inventing a steel-bottom plow and
new irrigation procedures, that when combined with his new pumping system,
saves the people from slow, painful death.
        They have the ability to open locks and remove (not find) traps like a
thief.  Their base chance is like a thief's base chance, modified for race and
DEX and armor.  These abilities increase 5% per level to a maximum of 95%.
        Technologists cannot multi-class with priests or wizards.
        Starting funds are (2d4+1)x10 gp.

        One of my favorite ideas for a technological weapon (easy to make,
besides) is a Leyden jar charged full of static electricity.  You throw it and
it breaks (it's glass) on contact, doing 1d3+(his level) damage to everyone
within 5 feet.  A friend I mentioned this class to said, "Awesome!  I'm gonna
build a tank or maybe a mech-suit!"  DM's, DO NOT ALLOW THIS!  A fully
hydraulic suit of mechanized battle armor that is mobile and still agile
enough to fight in, that protects you besides, is much too powerful for a mere
PC to make.  *Perhaps* some 2,000th level NPC genius, but not a PC.  If he
tries he's gonna have to restructure the world's economy by introducing
assembly lines and precision made parts, and remember these didn't even come
about in our world until around 1900.  That's at least 350 years of development
our world had between the era AD&D is played in and "the present".  I doubt
one man should be allowed to make that sort of jump.

    Traders are an unusual class.  They seem to have bits of all
characters in them.  They can bargain for reduced prices of many
things, sell for commission hard to find items, and gain many
abilities from other classes.  This class hits on the clerics'
table and can use any magic item of any other class if the trader
has gained any abilities from that class.  The traders get an am-
azing ability to start talking fast and babble.  The other person
will either: 1) help you, 2) be so confused as not to hinder you,
or 3) flee in confused agitation.

     Acquired Abilities:

A. Bargaining and appraising abilities
B. Directional and 1st level thief abilities
C. Read magic ability and add 2 languages learned
D. Equivocate ability and add 1 to intelligence
E. May use crossbows and add 5 languages learned
F. 1st level monk abilities and 3rd mate seafarer abilities
G. Bribery ability and 1st level assassin abilities
H. May use any missile or pole arm weapon
I. Add 7 languages learned
J. 1st level illusionist abilities
K. Detect magic ability and automatic guildmaster

    Explanation of Abilities:

Bargaining.....base 5% discount + 2%/level (50% maximum)
Appraising.....50% base accuracy + 2%/level
Directional....35% base chance + 1%/level
Read magic.....20% base chance + 1%/level
Equivocate.....15% base chance + 2%/level (50% maximum)
Bribery........30% base chance + 2%/level
Guildmaster....500 g.p./month kickbacks, maintains a residence
               in a city
Detect magic...10% chance base + 1%/level

    Additional Notes:

  Traders can be any alignment.
  Traders that are guildmasters gain 1,000 g.p./month in wages
in a large city.

    True weaponsmasters are a class that actually can obtain the
full potential of any weapon.  Unlike other fighter types that
choose a certain weapon type, this class gets its bonuses on all
weapons.  This class gets to hit/damage and parry bonuses of
all weapons and also increases the # of swings a round.  The
character can also hit as plus weapons (on monsters that need
+1 or better to hit, for example).

    Witches are pretty self-explanatory.  This class does most
of the things witches are fabled to.  They can make certain
potions, learn languages, enchant, and make magic items.  This
class uses a combination of clerics' and magic-users' spells.
As the name implies, this class can only be occupied by females.

     Acquired Abilities:

A. Brew poisons, narcotics, and hallucinogens
B. Make a bag of holding
C. Brew love potions
D. +1 to charisma
E. Dance of seduction
F. Brew truth drugs
G. Read and use magic-user, druid, and illusionist scrolls

I. Add 5 languages learned
J. Disguise
K. Brew control potions
L. Brew other potions
M. Brew acids
N. Gain the voice
O. +1 to charisma
P. Transfer hit points
Q. Enchant items

    Explanation of Abilities:

Brew poisons,etc......for each level the witch is, she can brew
                      1 d.8 strength poison, narcotics are sleep
                      drugs, hallucinogens cause confusion
Bag of holding........there may be only 1 bag of holding for
                      each witch, if lost or destroyed it takes
                      1 month  to make a new one
Love potions..........they act as a rod of beguiling, if the
                      ratio of brew points (1d.8/lvl) is 1 or
                      more than the victims, the effect last 1
                      week (15% chance/day of wearing off)
Dance.................all humanoids are susceptible, it takes 1
                      turn to perform, victims are entranced as
                      long as the witch is present unless at-
                      tacked, there's a 10% chance/lvl that it's
                      successful -10%/level over 5th of victim(s)
Truth drugs...........save vs. poison or answer accurately a # of
                      questions = to the witch's level, then a
                      deep sleep sets in
Familiar..............the witch automatically gains a familiar as
                      the spell (it's possible to have 2)
Disguise..............as an assassin
Brew acid.............as an alchemist's low acid
Voice.................a witch may shout a command no more than 10
                      words long (count them out beforehand) and
                      those failing to save vs. magic at -2 will
                      obey the command for 1-4 rounds, the voice
                      cannot be used more than 1/3 rounds on the
                      same person
Transfer hit points...a witch may permanently transfer her hit
                      points to anyone else, if done within 1
                      turn of death it will revive that person
                      giving them that many hit points, char-
                      acteristics of others may also be raised
                      at a cost of 4/1 up to 13, 6 for 13 to 14,
                      7 for 14 to 15, 8 from 15 to 16, 9 from 16
                      to 17, 10 from 17 to 18, and 12 from 18 to
                      19 (loss of hit points is permanent)

Section 2: New Kits


Warrior Kits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backbiter (fighter kit)
jdelisle@loyola.edu

Description: Backbiters are a type of fighter who has joined a thief
guild, and accompanies the thieves out on "jobs" not as an extra sword,
but as an expert swordsman. Backbiters are often used as guards when on
an assignment, since they can most effectively fight the city watch with
the greatest chance of success (and survival).
     Backbiters must have a minimum Dexterity of 10, Intelligence of 8,
and Strength _two_ points greater than Dexterity. What's the point of
being a fighter if a character is more agile than strong? Backbiters
suffer a 10% penalty to experience point totals, since they are
performing activities better suited to thieves. A Backbiter _never_
gains experience for using his thief-like abilities.
     To earn a 10% experience point bonus, the Backbiter must have a
Strength of 16 or more, and his/her Dexterity must be four or more
points less than strength.
     The kit can be abandoned, but all thief abilities are halved and
can never again be improved. In addition, all armor penalties (including
shield restrictions) are kept, and the fighter still cannot specialize
in a weapon, but he/she can learn formerly prohibited weapons.

Role: The Backbiter is almost always the best fighter in the guild, even
at low levels, and is considered the "anchor" on an assignment. A mage's
spells may not work, or a psionicist's powers might fail, but a good
fighter is always a good fighter, and can be depended on to help pull
the thieves' fat out of the fire. When a doorway needs to be defended,
it is the Backbiter who is entrusted with the task, simply because
he/she is the best at physical combat.
     There are as many reasons for becoming a Backbiter as there are
Backbiters. Unlike Sneakspells, who must go through years of
apprenticeship to gain magical abilities, Backbiters need only minor
training to become fighters. As a result, a large guild may have over a
dozen Backbiters, but only one or two Sneakspells.
     Unlike Sneakspells, Backbiters must be first or second level when
this kit is picked up, and can be played any way the player chooses.

Secondary Skills: Usually none, since the Backbiter is a professional
thief, but any warrior or rogue skill can be chosen.

Weapon Proficiencies: Backbiters can use almost any weapon. Polearms are
prohibited (due to their size, and inability to easily conceal them in
nearby surroundings). Likewise, any missile weapon with a firing rate
under 1 (heavy crossbow, arquebus, etc) are prohibited, since the don't
offer enough firepower.
     One of the first weapon proficiencies must be spent on the dagger
and a sword of any type.

Armor Allowed: Only leather armor is allowed, and a shield can never be
used. A Backbiter can wear heavier armor, but loses all thief abilities
since he/she is untrained to deal with heavy armor. Also, the heavier
armor is treated as being one armor class worse than it usually is, due
to the fighter not being used to wearing it. A Backbiter could wear
chainmail, but he would be AC 6, and would not be able to use any of his
special skills.
     If the Backbiter goes without armor, his ability scores improve the
same way a thief's would.

Non Weapon Proficiencies: Backbiters can use any NWPs in the general and
warrior categories. Rogue NWPs can be used, provided they give the
Backbiter some direct, physical advantage; tumbling and disguise would
be acceptable, while appraising, forgery, and gaming do not.

Equipment: Backbiters can buy any equipment he/she likes, but will not
normally buy a shield, armor heavier than leather, or weapons that
cannot be used. Backbiters will _never_ carry thieves' tools (like
lockpicks, crowbar, etc); if caught by local authorities, a Backbiter
would rather be assumed to be a ruffian than a thief (especially in
areas with harsh penalties against thieving).
     Also, Backbiters like magical weapons and defensive devices, like
swords, axes, bracers, and rings, and make every attempt to get such
items if found. (The argument "How am I supposed to defend you guys if
I don't have the best sword?" works quite well.)

Special Bonuses: Backbiters get several thief abilities as part of their
training. Their abilities are inferior to those of bards, but superior
to Sneakspells by far.
  Starting Scores:
    Move Silently: 15%
    Hide in Shadows: 15%
    Climb Walls: 40%
    Backstab: 10%
All of these abilities work the same as they would for a thief, except
for the backstab ability, for which the kit is named. When a Backbiter
wants to backstab an opponent, he/she _must_ be behind the opponent,
have surprise, and make a successful backstab roll. If the roll is
successful, the damage is doubled, but if the backstab roll fails, only
normal damage is done. It's important to note that without the ability
to successfully move silently and hide in shadows, the character can't
gain surprise, and can't backstab effectively.
     When this kit is first assumed, the Backbiter gains 20% to add as
seen fit. For every level a Backbiter gains after picking up this kit,
he/she gains 5% to add to any ability score. These gains are only
received if a thief is available to train the Backbiter.

Special Hindrances: The most obvious hindrance is the inability to wear
non-leather armor and use a shield. The other serious threat is that
Backbiters cannot use polearms, which are among the cheapest and
deadliest weapons available, because they can't be hidden on one's body
(like a dagger), or hidden in an alley or cart (like a sword). A third
type of weapon that cannot be used are the higher damage missile
weapons, like heavy crossbows, arquebuses, and other firearms.


*******************************************************


JUGGERNAUT
TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        Juggernaut is a fighter kit.  Juggernauts are very intimidating, so a
16 STR and 16 CON is required.  They epitomize everything big, dumb, ugly, and
menacing.  The character desiring to be a juggernaut must also be in the top
quarter of the possible height and weight for his race.  The sum of INT and
WIS cannot be more that 15 to qualify for this kit, and neither can be more
than 10.  Halfling and gnome fighters cannot take this kit, for reasons that
should be obvious.  If your campaign allows non-standard races, half-ogres
would be great.
        Juggernauts are the masters of hack-and-slash.  Once they get started,
nothing can stop them.  They prefer to use the largest weapons possible, so
large they have to be wielded two-handed.  Size S weapons are forbidden, as
juggernauts associate them with thieves, who are always hiding them and using
stealth.  That is not the way of the juggernaut.  Straight-forward attack is.
Furthermore, missile weapons that are not cast directly from the hand are
forbidden.  Therefore, slings, bows, and crossbows are forbidden, but javelins
and spears are not.  Juggernauts do not like to stand off at a distance to
kill enemies, they'd rather have the gore squelch beneath their blades.  For
the same reason, the longer polearms will not be used by juggernauts (limiting
them to very few pole weapons at all).  One initial WP slot must be spent on
two-handed sword (for size M creatures, a size L weapon) or on a bastard
sword (for size S creatures, a size M weapon).  As for armor, they must take
the most expensive they can afford that gives the most protection.  This, of
course, makes them look even more intimidating.  The quality of impressiveness
is more important to them than protection.  In fact, they will use normal
bronze plate armor with a normal shield rather than elfin chain +5 because
plate looks better (DM's enforce this, this is their big penalty).  They will
also spend extra money to have sinister designs scrolled or inlaid into the
armor.  Deaths' heads, horned and spiked helms, anything to intimidate.
        The unstoppable slaughterhouse called a juggernaut is allowed to keep
on fighting pas 0 hps.  As long as his hit point total is above -10 the
juggernaut keeps right on going.  If he drops below -10 he dies instantly and
the opponents killing him get a +1 to morale.  A juggernaut killed this way
can only be resurrected/raised by a cleric of at least half again his level.
If the juggernaut stops fighting between 0 and -10 hps, he instantly falls into
the coma-like state described in the Player's Handbook under the optional
Hovering on Death's Door rules.  However, he loses 3 hit points every 2 rounds
instead of 1 per 1.
        If nonweapon proficiencies are used juggernauts must chose
Intimidation (from the Complete Thief Handbook) at first level (it costs them
only one slot).
        They dislike all magic intensely, figuring brawn is better than brain.
They have only a half normal chance for a wild psionic talent.  They save
against all magic that allows saves at a -2 (death magic, r/s/w, spells).  Even
if the juggernaut is the willing receipient of the spell he must still save
with a +2 (successfully saving means the spell DOES affect him).  In addition,
magical items other than weapons must be successfully saved against vs. spell
to be used (with a +2) success meaning useable.
        The juggernaut's primary bonus is the use of d12 hit dice.

MOUNTAIN RANGER
TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        The mountain ranger is a hunter and mountain man who lives not only by
his sword, but by his wits.  Mountain rangers may be of any good alignment.  A
mountain ranger with STR, CON, and WIS scores of 16 or better earns 10% bonus
experience.  They have the typical ranger two-weapon fighting ability when
wearing studded leather or lighter armour.  This type of ranger is not so much
a woodsman as a mountain man.  Even if the optional proficiency rules are not
used the mountain ranger gets mountaineering proficiency.  This skill improves
like the ranger's tracking proficiency.  When wearing studded leather or
lighter armor a mountain ranger can try to move silently, hide in shadows, or
detect noise.  The chance to succeed in natural surroundings is given below; in
unnatural surroundings the chance is halved.  They select a species enemy as
do normal rangers.  They have the same ability with animals as do normal
rangers.  Mountain rangers can learn priest spells, but only of the animal and
elemental (earth and air) spheres, when he reaches 8th level.  Mountain
rangers naturally have more affinity for stone than plants.  The elven races
seem at home in the woods; likewise a dwarf is at home in the hills.  He
follows the ranger rules for using his priest spells.  In all other respects
they are identical to rangers.
        Mountain rangers must have a 13 STR, 12 DEX, 15 CON, and 14 WIS.  They
may be dwarvish or human.  Their prime requisites are STR, CON, and WIS.

SQUIRE
TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        Squire is the demi-human version of the paladin.  As they are not
allowed to be true paladins (that is the humans' bonus) the truly devout
fighters must settle for this.  It requires at least an 11 STR, 9 CON, 11 WIS,
and 13 CHA.  A squire cannot be evil or chaotic.
        If a squire commits a chaotic act, he must go to a lawful good cleric,
confess his error, atone, and do penance, just as a paladin.  However, the
penance is likely to be less.  If he does an evil act while under enchantment
he loses his status and powers; until he can atone he is a fighter.  If he
willingly and knowingly commits an evil act he is permanently a fighter of
equal level (dropping experience above that required to be a figher of equal
level) ever after.
        Squires may detect evil within 30' if concentrating.  They are allowed
a saving throw vs. breath to avoid catching a disease.  They can heal 2 hp
per level by laying on of hands once per week.  They have a limited ability to
turn undead.  At eighth level they gain a limited ability to cast spells from
the priest spheres of combat and protection.  They may not have more than 10
magic items including not more than 1 suit of armor, 1 shield, and 4 weapons.
They must tithe to an NPC institution of choice and retain only enough wealth
to live modestly.
        They attract the same type of followers as fighters but in lesser
numbers.  Roll as you would for a fighter, then divide the number by 3.
Hirelings must be non-chaotic, non-evil; lawful good preferred.
        A human squire may, at any time up to tenth level, choose to change
alignment to lawful good and become a true paladin (if his abilities are
high enough).  He does not suffer alignment change penalties because of this
(since it's actually a step up for him) except that he no longer feels the
need for followers and he releases any he has from service.  He is not dual-
classed, he is now simply a paladin and not a squire.
        Dwarves may advance to 14th, elves to 13th, gnomes to 11th, half-elves
to 15th, and halflings to 10th.  Humans, of course, are unlimited.

Mage Kits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------



POWERMAGE
TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        Powermages must have a 9 INT and 15 STR.  Being physically mighty
themselves they like spells that are magical representations of sheer force
and physical power.  They tend to be a bit brash and arrogant, knowing they
are powerful and liking it.  Some like it too much and start to dip into evil.
Others use their power to help others.  Still other powermages don't care for
anything except the magicks of power themselves.  Thus powermages are probably
the most diverse in alignment of any wizard group.  Half-elves and humans may
become powermages.  They learn power spells at +10% and other spells at -10%.
They have a +1 to their saves vs. power spells and inflict a -1 to other
people's saves when they cast power spells.  They can memorize an extra spell
of each spell level they know every day if it is a power spell.  At 17th level
they gain an additional +1 to their saves vs. power spells.  At 20th level
they gain the ability to dispel power spells once per day.  All 1st, 2nd, & 3rd
level power spells in a 10' path are dispelled up to a 90' range.
        Spells in the school of power (another lousy name) are similar to
those of invocation/evocation.  They create force from nothing.  A powermage's
oppositional schools are enchantment/charm and illusion/phantasm.  (They
don't like those so-called "weak" magicks.)
        I think that's all that needs to be said.  Now for their spell list,
which at low levels isn't too good (you can't have big massive force spells
at low levels).
1st:    Cantrip, Hold Portal, Shield, Tenser's Floating Disk
2nd:    Choke, Ray of Enfeeblement, Strength
3rd:    Hold Person, Wind Wall
4th:    Leomund's Secure Shelter, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Otiluke's
        Resilient Sphere, Shout, Solid Fog, Wind Breath
5th:    Avoidance, Bigby's Interposing Hand, Dismissal, Von Gasik's Refusal,
        Wall of Force
6th:    Bigby's Forceful Hand, Globe of Invulnerability, Repulsion
7th:    Bigby's Grasping Hand, Forcecage, Mordekainen's Sword, Reverse Gravity
8th:    Bigby's Clenched Fist, Binding, Otiluke's Telekinetic Sphere
9th:    Bigby's Crushing Hand



***************************************************************


Sneakspell (wizard kit)
jdelisle@loyola.edu

Description: The Sneakspell is a mage who has some thief training, and
is almost always a member of a thieves' guild. Sneakspells became mages
because they had more brains than agility, but ended up joining the
guild for one reason or another. Guildmasters give Sneakspells a greater
share of loot, since they possess different skills from the other guild
members, and tend to contribute more to an assignment. Once the mage's
apprenticeship for magic is done, he/she joins a guild (or is drafted
into one) and begins an apprenticeship to learn some stealth skills.
     Sneakspells must have a Dexterity of 10 or more, Strength of 8 or
more, and Intelligence that is _three_ points higher than dexterity.
Sneakspells suffer a 10% penalty to experience point totals, since they
are performing activities better suited to thieves. A Sneakspell _never_
gains experience for using his thief-like abilities.
     To earn a 10% experience bonus, not only must the Sneakspell's
Intelligence be greater than 16, it must be 5 or more points higher than
the Dexterity score. This is due to the fact that characters with higher
dexterity will either favor their thieving abilities, or will become
thieves outright instead of mages. After all, wouldn't you rather learn
by doing than spend 2-3 years looking at books?
     This kit can be abandoned, but all thief abilities are halved, all
penalties are kept, and thief abilities can no longer be improved. A
mage can become a Sneakspell at any time, but all special abilities are
considered to start at first level.

Preferred Magical Schools: Sneakspells usually carry spells hand-picked
for an "job" (like Knock, Invisibility, Detect Magic, etc), or a random
assortment of spells. Sneakspells of any decent level will always carry
one offensive and one defensive spell, regardless of the situation.

Barred Magical Schools: No schools are barred for the Sneakspell, but
many spells in certain kits are discouraged. The spells least desired
are those that have no purpose while on a job, like many of the
Abjuration, Divination, and Necromancy schools. These spells are only
carried if they will have special uses while on a job, like Detect
Disease, Protection from Evil, and Hold Undead.
     Specialists, whether from one of the nine schools of magic, wild
mages, or elementalists, cannot become Sneakspells. Being a Sneakspell
requires as much work (if not more) than being a specialist, and the
nature of the kit requires great flexibility.

Role: Sneakspells serve as the "jack-of-all-trades" in a thieves' guild.
They serve as heavy firepower, door openers, and magical trap disarmers.
Low level Sneakspells tend not to live long, especially if a trap goes
off or there is any combat, but those who do reach higher levels tend to
command quite a bit of respect, due not only to their power, but their
usefulness.
     Mages become Sneakspells for many reasons. Perhaps thieving is
considered a respectable (or honorable) job where the mage grew up. A
mage without a copper to his name might join to make some money. The
guild may do favors for the mage, in return for the mage's services, or
perhaps they made him/her "an offer that couldn't be refused"
     A mage can become a Sneakspell at any level, but the thief
abilities are considered to start from first level.
     The Sneakspell should be played as a "fallen mage" (a mage who has
became a Sneakspell unwillingly (he needed the money, was coerced,
etc)), a "mystical thief" (who is a thief at heart, but possess
incredible powers), or the "bored mage" (looking for excitement, the
mage started hanging around thieves).

Secondary Skills: None. The Sneakspell earns a living through being a
thief. He/she might pick up a few things, but not enough to be
considered a true secondary skill.

Weapon Proficiencies: Same as a regular mage

Non-Weapon Proficiencies: Bonus: none
Choices: All General NWPs
     Rogue: appraising, disguise, forgery,  jumping, tightrope walking,
and tumbling (all for one slot).
     Mage: herbalism, gem cutting, reading/writing, and spellcraft. Any
additions to either the Mage or Rogue categories is usable by the
Sneakspell under the following conditions:
  1. It is directly usable on a thieving job
  2. It does not require a lot of "after-job" work or research
     (the Sneakspell has enough to do already, with spell
     memorization and practice)
  3. It does not involve fighting, traps, or snares

Equipment: The Sneakspell can buy any equipment he/she wants, but tends
to shy away from loose robes or colorful clothing. Sneakspells dress as
would a thief, and when on a job, prefer to wear dark clothing
(especially leather).


Special Benefits: The primary benefit of being a Sneakspell is gaining
several thief abilities, although to a more limited degree than even
bards. The Sneakspell learns to Hide in Shadows, Move Silently,  Climb
Walls, and Read Languages (having a mage with you is no good if he
sticks out like a sore thumb or can't get over a 20' wall!).
  Starting Scores:
    Move Silently: 5%
    Hide in Shadows: 10%
    Climb Walls: 35%
    Read Languages: 0%
When this kit is first assumed, the Sneakspell gains 20% to add as seen
fit. For every level a Sneakspell gains after picking up this kit,
he/she gains 5% to add to any ability score. These gains are only
received if the Sneakspell is trained by another thief.
     Sneakspells can get racial and dexterity bonuses for their thief
abilities, but do NOT get any bonus for wearing no armor. Also,
Sneakspells cannot backstab.

Special Hindrances: Sneakspells are action oriented, and dislike being
holed up in a room for any reason. As a result, their research skills
have suffered. Any time research is involved, all times and costs are
doubled. Spell research, research in a library, or even a Legend Lore
spell all have their times doubled. Likewise, Sneakspells' dislike of
research prevents them from having "useless" knowledge non-weapon
proficiencies, like religion, ancient history, or ancient languages.
     Sneakspells also suffer from an alignment problem. Like thieves, it
is hard for a Sneakspell to be of good alignment, but the Sneakspell has
the additional problem of being tied to the guild for training. As a
result, most Sneakspells are of neutral alignment.
     Spells must also be chosen carefully. A Sneakspell will _never_
choose a spell that cannot be directly applied to the thieving job he or
she is leaving on. Offensive and defensive spells can be learned
normally, but the Sneakspell's sense of utility prevents learning spells
that may not get used. For example, a Sneakspell will learn Knock and
Invisibility before Wizard Lock or Magic Mouth.
     Compared to other mages, Sneakspells are reckless, undisciplined,
and untrustworthy, but relate well to thieves, assassins, and other
outlaws.



Priest Kits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The DWARNOI (Dwarven Stone Priests)
TEL002@ACAD.DRAKE.EDU

        This is a new character class open to dwarves only. Stone is to the
Dwarnoi as nature is to the druid. The Dwarnoi use the magic within stones to
protect and serve their race, and are well regarded by other dwarves.

Requirements:
        A Dwarnoi, besides having to be a dwarf (the DM may even wish to limit
the class to Mountain Dwarves ), must have an Intelligence of at least 10 and
a Wisdom of at least 12. The latter is a prime requisite.  Dwarnoi use the
same table for level advancement, hit dice and saving throws as do priests.
The level limit on the class is 15th, which few Dwarnoi have ever attained.

Weapons Allowed:
        Dwarnoi may wear any type of armor and shield, and may use only battle
axes, clubs, mace (any), morning stars, broad and short swords, warhammers,
and any weapon made of stone. They attack on the same table as priests.

Spells:
        Dwarnoi have access to spells regarding stone in both priest and wizard
classes, with some additional spells unique to their class. A full list is
given below.

Granted Powers:
        The Dwarnoi have a secret language consisting of stone-tapping. It is
rudimentary, at best, but is sufficiently developed to transmit simple
messages. Like all secret tongues, it is jealously guarded.
        The Dwarnoi are resistant to earthquakes, and run no risk of being
swallowed by them, natural or otherwise.
        The Dwarnoi receive a +2 saving throw against petrification attacks,
and any such attack becomes ineffective after the 7th level.
        The Dwarnoi is at a +1 to hit and damage when employing a hammer only.
        Additional powers are gained at the following levels.

        - At 3rd level, the Dwarnoi can automatically perform all the detects
on page 21 of the PHB with 75% + 2%/level accuracy.
        - At 3rd level and beyond, he can turn stone-related creatures
(Gargoyles, Margoyles, Umber Hulks, but this is to the DM's discretion) as if
they were undead on the priest turning chart. The Dwarnoi can turn them as
if he was a priest two levels lower.
        - At 5th level, he can converse with any creatures that make their
homes within stone.
        - At 10th level, the Dwarnoi can call for an earthquake, but with dire
consequences. He is stripped of all spell-casting and rune-carving abilities
for a month at least, and till that time must not step foot within a Dwarnoi
sanctuary. To do so is to run the risk of being killed by members of its own
sect.
        - Dwarnoi _cannot_ turn undead.

Proficiencies:
        The Dwarnoi use the priest table for both WP's and NWP's. They must
take the proficiency of stonemasonry initially, and mining by 3rd level. They
can take on craftsman skills from the warrior table (armorer and
weaponsmithing) without paying the double cost in slots.

Ethos:
        The Dwarnoi respect the mountains and stones, and the treasures they
conceal within. They consider these metals to have been placed in stone to
be shaped, and carved into new and wonderful works. Mining solely for
profit is detested by the Dwarnoi, though they will avoid getting entangled in
such affairs.
        The holy symbol of the Dwarnoi is simply a piece of stone.  As an
acolyte, the Dwarnoi receives his stone from the mother rock. This is a
boulder from which all members gain their holy symbol from. As time goes by
and the caster rises in level, the rock becomes more smooth and well-rounded.
Losing the stone require a penance of some sort; probably some minor quest
if the loss was due to a good reason, a major endeavor if not.
Sanctuary
        The Dwarnoi center of worship is typically set apart from the rest of a
dwarven stronghold. The dwarnoi may have a location near to the rest of
their kin, but this is used mainly as a location where the Dwarnoi can create
or smith items.
        The actual Dwarnoi temple can be reached only by members of the sect
through special doorways, similar to permanent phase doors.

New Spells
1st lvl:
    Break Fall ( Alteration )
    R       : Special                  Comp: V,S
    Duration: Special                  CT  : 1
    AOF     : Special                  ST  : N/A
This causes the floor ( if rock or stone ) beneath the Dwarnoi to become soft
and cushion his fall. He will only take 1/4 of normal damage from such
impact.

    Sharpen ( Alteration )
    R       : Held                Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: 6 months / lvl      CT  : 1 turn
    AOF     : 1 weapon            ST  : N/A
This keeps a sharp edge on any one weapon for at least the time period
specified.

3rd lvl:
    Strengthen ( Alteration )
    R       : Touch               Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: 10 yrs/lvl ( spe )       CT  : 1 week
    AOF     : See below           ST  : N/A
This enables the Dwarnoi to carve a special rune on some structure, a wall,
well, or other stone design, that will keep it sturdy and strong for the
duration specified. About 250 cubic feet of stone per level can be affected.
Earthquakes will not damage the structure. After the 10th level, the spell
becomes permanent until dispelled. The material components for this spell
are a piece of chalk, and a set of arches constructed of steel. The Dwarnoi
must analyze the structure beforehand, to place the spell appropriately.

    WarStone ( Alt )
    R       : 0                    Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: Special                   CT  : 4
    AOF     : Special                   ST  : N/A
This spell enchants up to three small pebbles, which can be no larger than
sling bullets. They can then be hurled or slung at an opponent. The
warstones have a +3 to hit and damage, and are considered to be enchanted
for purposes for determining if a creature can be struck. Upon striking, the
stone shatters and flings shards in a 5'radius, inflicting 1-3 points damage.
The stone will still shatter if it misses. (Less if smaller than sling bullet
sized). The material components are three unworked stones.

5th Level:
    Stone Bridge ( Alt )
    R       : 10'                      Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: 1 turn/level                   CT  : 6
    AOF     : Special                        ST  : N/A
This creates a bridge of up to 50 square feet + 25 sq ft /lvl, across any gap
the Dwarnoi desires. It is sturdy and safe to walk across, and can bear the
weight of an elephant. The material component of this spell is a piece of
rope, which should be knotted together when the spell is cast.

7th Level:
    Dwarf Golem ( Conj / Summoning )
    R       : 0                        Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: Perm                     CT  : 3 months
    AOF     : Special                        ST  : N/A
This enables the Dwarnoi to construct a dwarf sized stone golem with the
following stats. ( AC 2; MV 6"; HD 10; HP 45; #AT 2; Da/At 4-10/4- 10; SA
Hurl Rocks for 2-8 points damage; SD None; MR Special; AL N; Sz S ). This
golem is immune to all spells that stone golems are. It can produce rocks
from its body and throw them up to a 30' range. It can not take any other
actions this round if it decides to do so, however. The golem costs 8,000 gp to
make, and after casting, the Dwarnoi must make a d20 roll and add 2 to it. If
the score is above his level, the spell fails and all the gold is used up. If
it is less or equal, the spell succeeds.

    WarBoulder ( Alt )
    R        : 0                             Comp: V,S,M
    Duration : Special                 CT  : 1 turn
    AOF      : Special                 ST  : N/A
This creates a similar enchantment as the WarStone on a single boulder ( up
to large catapult size ). The Dwarnoi can then make this boulder hurl itself
up to a distance of 10'/level, doing damage as if hurled by a catapult. Upon
striking, the boulder shatters and inflicts 2-h damage in a 30' radius.

Psionicist Kits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Fraud (psionicist kit)
jdelisle@loyola.edu

Description: Frauds are psionicists who use their powers to dupe
others. They tend pass themselves off as exorcists, diviners,
healers, mystics, or whatever else their powers make them suited
to. They typically take advantage of the towns they visit, milking
the residents for all the gold, items, and favors they're worth,
and never even giving a hint of falsehood.
     Frauds have the same primary requirements as psionicists, but
they also need a Charisma of 14 or more. Also, Frauds cannot be of
good alignment (tricking people for money is _not_ a good action!).
     This kit is almost impossible to be abandoned, because the
ways of duplicity and lies are hard to give up, especially when a
character is just so damn good at them. The only way a character
can stop being a Fraud is to change to a good alignment, and stop
tricking people (thus loosing all the benefits of this kit).

Preferred Disciplines: Frauds take disciplines based on what can be
done with them. Clairsetient powers allow for information gathering
from a distance. Telepathic powers can be used to gather personal
information from a person (through Probe and ESP). Informational
powers are used to become "fortune tellers", "psychics", and
"personal readers", whose knowledge of a character's past makes
people think their predictions for the future are valid. Telepaths
can also pass themselves off as "exorcists", who rid people of
personal "demons" (caused by the psionicist)
     Psychometabolic powers can be used for a variety of guises,
like a "healer". Psychokinetic powers are used to dispel (after
creating) mischievous spirits.

Barred Disciplines: Frauds cannot have Metapsionic or Psychoportive
disiplines as their primary discipline.

Role: Frauds make their living from duping people into believing
their plans. Frauds may masquerade as healers, fortune tellers,
exorcists, or anything else they can think of, but always charge
high prices for services rendered, and always find a way for people
to need their help. For example, a "healer" (a psi with Cell
Adjustment) could perform "miracles", claiming to be the priest of
a new god, and ask for donations to build a temple (which will
never be built). An "exorcist" could, during a bogus exorcism,
telekinetically make things happen (knocked over chairs, ghostly
moaning, etc).
     Psionicists pick up this kit because they realize the
potential their powers have, and how easily duped most people can
be. Frauds trick others into paying for their expensive lifestyle,
and live from town to town, leaving well before being discovered.

Secondary Skills: Any.

Weapons Allowed: Same as a psionicist.
Armor Allowed: Leather armor only, no shields.

Non-Weapon Proficiencies: Frauds have access to all General and
Psionicist NWP categories, and can also select the following
without penalty: ancient history, appraising, forgery, local
history, and spellcraft. (These are not granted automatically.)
     Frauds begin with the disguise proficiency at no cost, as well
as the Improvise and Persuasion proficiencies. (see special
bonuses).

Equipment: A Fraud must have equipment consistent with his/her
current guise. A fortune teller would have cards, tea, and other
predictive devices, a healer would have herbs and (fake)
prayerbooks, etc.

Special Bonuses: Fruads have the ability to make not only make up
facts quickly, but to convince people of the validity of their
statements. As such, they have two unique proficiencies
automatically: Improvise and Persuasion.
     Improvise's score is Wisdom + Intelligence, divided by two.
Improvise is the Fraud's ability to take a small amount of
information, and extrapolate as much as possible from it, using
both reasoning powers and intuition. Modifiers to this score can be
assigned by the DM; for example, if the victim is someone well
known to the Fraud, there might be a bonus of +3, but against
someone the Fraud has only talked to once, there might be a -10
penalty. On a failed check, the Fraud gains no insight. On a 20,
the Fraud's insight is 100% wrong, and is quite often the opposite
of the truth.
     NOTE: Improvise should not replace role-playing!! It should
only be used to give the Fraud more information to role-play with.
     Persuasion's score is Charisma minus two. Persuasion is the
ability to convince people of something other than what they know,
especially when it comes to what the Fraud does and says. Modifiers
should be based on what the Fraud did (killing the king cannot be
easily explained, but making a social faux pas could be explained
more easily). Also, if an intended victim has more intelligence
than the Fraud, use the difference between the two as a negative
modifier to a Persuasion check; someone smarter than you is more
likely to catch such a mistake. For example, a Bob (a 20th level
Fraud) tries to improvise in a conversation, and rolls a 20, and
says something regrettable. Bob then succeeds a Persuasion check,
and manages to convince the person he's talking to that he didn't
mean what was said ("The words came out wrong."). Again, the
Persuasion NWP should not replace role-playing, only enhance it.

Special Hindrances: The primary disadvantage of this kit is the
amount of knowledge about psionics people possess. Those familiar
with psionics will almost never fall for a Fraud's tricks, but
where psionics are unknown, a Fraud may never be uncovered. As a
result, Frauds are almost never seen in Grayhawk or on Athas, are
uncommon in the Forgotten Realms, and relatively common on Krynn,
compared to "plain vanilla" psionicists.
     Another hindrance is the magic aura given off by magic items.
Frauds know that magic detection spells reveal nothing when they
use their powers, but are aware that having magic items on one's
person will reveal magic to anyone who can detect magic (and
possibly end the psi's current performance). As a result, Frauds
will not willingly have any magic items on them when they perform
their "magic". Of course, if a Fraud doesn't know an item is
magical, or if he/she can't get rid of it (like a cursed item),
then he/she won't put it down. There is no restriction of having or
using magic items when not in a guise, or not "performing" for the
public.


*******************************************************


Rogue Thoughts (psionicist kit)
jdelisle@loyola.edu
(name inspired by Scott [bloodgor@maria.wustl.edu])

Description: Rogue Thoughts are psionicists in the thieves' guild. The
Rogue Thoughts can be used in different ways, depending on the powers
known. Telepathy allows for information gathering and trickery,
Psychokinetics are the ultimate door openers, and Psychometabolics give
improved combat abilities and other powers. This makes the Rogue
Thoughts more flexible than a Sneakspell, and more desirable for a
variety of jobs, since powers can be re-used.
     Rogue Thoughts must have a Constitution of 11, Dexterity of 11,
Intelligence of 13, and Wisdom of 16. Rogue Thoughts suffer a 10%
penalty to experience point totals, since they are performing activities
better suited to thieves. A Rogue Thought _never_ gains experience for
using his thief-like abilities.
     Rogue Thoughts cannot earn a 10% bonus for Wisdom of 17 or greater,
and a Constitution of 15 or greater.
     This kit cannot be abandoned. A Rogue Thoughts spends much of his
time learning the ways of stealth, to the point of combining his thief
training and psionic powers in some cases.

Preferred Disciplines: Rogue Thoughts can have only one of these three
disciplines as their primary discipline: Telepathic, Psychokinetic, or
Psychometabolic. All of these are directly usable, in a variety of
situations.

Barred Disciplines: Rogue Thoughts cannot have Psychoportive or
Clairsetient disciplines as their primary discipline. While information
gathering or quick escapes are useful, the Rogue Thought is capable of
bigger and better things.
     Rogue Thoughts are prevented from learning powers from one
discipline: Metapsionics, which don't do "enough" for the psionicist
(quite a few powers don't "stand alone", like Gird or Splice). At the
DM's option, some Metapsionic powers, like Receptacle and Wrench can be
made available to the player, if "useless" powers in other disciplines
are made unavailable (like Taste Link or Banishment, for example).

Role: Rogue Thoughts are the wild cards of a guild. Depending on the
primary discipline, a Rogue Thought may be best at running cons or
information gathering (Telepathic), breaking doors and locks open
(Psychokinetic), or combat/true wild card abilities (Psychometabolic).
Mid level and high level Rogue Thoughts look down on the thieves in
their guild, since the thieves are common lackeys, but a Rogue Thought
can be considered a "special operative." They think of both Sneakspells
and Backbiters as bodyguards and additional firepower, since both are
better at combat, but lack the finesse a Rogue Thought has (or thinks he
does).
     A psionicist picks up this kit for a variety of reasons. Perhaps
his or her mentor was a dual-class thief, or a Rogue Thought. The
psionicist could worship a god of thieves, and join the guild to
"worship better."
     A psionicist must start with this kit, or he/she will lose the
Stealth thieving ability (see Special Bonuses). Otherwise, the level the
psionicist picks the kit up at is considered to be first level as far as
thief abilities are concerned. If the psionicist has any Metapsionic
powers, there are lost without any replacements.

Secondary Skills: The Rogue Thought is a job all by itself, requiring
the psionicist's full attention. A secondary skill can be assigned, but
it will have fallen into disuse.

Weapons Allowed: Same as a psionicist.

Armor Allowed: Leather armor only, no shields.

Non-Weapon Proficiencies: Rogue Thoughts have access to all General,
Rogue, and Psionicist non-weapon proficiencies without penalty.

Equipment: A Rogue Thought must have leather armor, and two weapons
before going adventuring. If a missile weapon is chosen, sufficient
ammunition must be carried at all times (at least enough for five rounds
of firing).

Special Bonuses: Rogue Thoughts get several thief abilities as part of
their training.
  Starting Scores:
    Move Silently: 10%
    Hide in Shadows: 15%
    Climb Walls: 35%
    Stealth: 15%
All of these abilities work the same as they would for a thief, except
for the Stealth ability. When the Stealth ability is invoked, the Rogue
Thought tries to use any psionic power based on camouflage or confusion
more effectively. The Stealth roll and power check occur simultaneously,
but there is an initiative modifier of +1. If the Stealth roll is
successful, the psionic power gains a bonus of 1 (or 5%) in all ways:
power check, saving throw bonuses, penalty on victims' saving throws,
etc. Camouflage based powers conceal something or cloak it in illusion;
Chameleon Power, Invisibility, Create/Control Sound, and Animate Shadow
are examples. Confusion based powers are powers that cause the victim to
lose his understanding of the current situation, and are mostly
telepathic in nature; Daydream, Awe, Repugnance, False Sensory Input,
and Phobia Amplification are good examples. Psionic attack modes,
defense modes, and telepathic powers which do NOT change the victim's
perceptions are not considered confusion powers.
     When this kit is first assumed, the Rogue Thought gains 20% to add
as seen fit. For every level a Rogue Thought gains after picking up this
kit, he/she gains 5% to add to any ability score. These gains are only
received if a thief is available to train the psionicist.

Special Hindrances: The Rogue Thought does not have as many hindrances
as a Sneakspell does, but there are problems. First, the inability to
learn Metapsionic powers prevents the psionicist from creating
psionically endowed items, creating receptacles, or battling undead
effectively. The inability to have Clairsetient or Psychoportive powers
limits the psionicist's information gathering abilities, and ability to
enter and exit restricted areas.
     A more important hindrance is alignment. A psionicist can never be
chaotic, so Rogue Thoughts have the difficulty of breaking laws against
theft but not becoming chaotic. How this is handled is up to the player,
because there are so many ways of handling it.



Section 4: Non-Standard Races

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Falloy.
From:ZA9ZA03@SYSA.COMPUTING-SERVICES.MANCHESTER-METROPOLITAN-UNIVERSITY.AC.UK

 This new race was inspired by the Lyonesse books by Jack Vance.
The Falloy is the off-spring of the mating of a female elf and a male halfling.
This is not as strange as it sounds. Both are creatures of Faerie rather than
human stock (in my world at least) and are allowed to mate, if they choose,
once a year upon the night that humans call Samhain Eve. This is the Faerie
festival of essence, when any of true Faerie blood may change form to that of
pure fey (the life force of Faerie folk), thus allowing the mating of diverse
races. Falloys are raised by their elven mothers, but inherit many of the
characteristics of their halfling fathers.
 Falloys take after their elven mothers in looks and stature, and after their
halfling fathers in terms of build and hardiness. Colouring amongst Falloys
tends to be rather pale for both hair and skin; however, their eyes are always
dark, either a dark brown or even almost black. They are frivolous to the
extreme, lack much in the way of self discipline, and generally do as they
please; in all, a very chaotic race. Thus, Falloys as PCs are always chaotic or
neutral; they are never lawful, though they may be good and evil as these
concepts mean little to them. Due to their chaotic nature Falloys may not be
clerics or mages (except wild mages). They may be Fighters, Thieves, Bards, or
Wild Mages.
 Falloys gain a bonus of +1 to dexterity and charisma, but also a -1 penalty
to intelligence and wisdom. Falloys live to be approximately 250 years old.
 They have the magical resistances normal for a half-elf i.e. 30% resistance to
sleep and charm. They also gain the saving throw bonuses due to constitution
that a normal halfling gains, but only against poison and not spells or rods,
staffs, or wands. Falloys are born with infravision, and can see upto 30 feet
when using it. Falloys are liked by elves and halflings, humans find them
mystifying but tolerate them, as do gnomes, but dwarves find their lack of
moral fibre annoying and dislike them.
 Falloys may choose from the same languages as elves. They gain a bonus to
surprise when not wearing metal armour and is alone or among similarly clad
elves/halflings. They do not gain the ability to detect secret/concealed doors.
 Due to their capricious nature Falloys never gain a 10% experience bonus for
high stats in any class.

      components (only concentration), can be cast in one segment, as if the
      PC was a mage of one-half his exp level) on a d8 with an 8 meaning no
      magic talent, it can only be cast 1/day
   have a -1 to first hit die
   are size T (tiny)--must use size S weapons two-handed--wpns

   +1 to hit with long bows
   can rear kick for 1d4/1d4 (directed at same opponent):

      out that round--too unstable
        +3 to first hit die
   are size L, take larger-than-man-size damage--however, the

Section 5: House Rules

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Non-Standard Rules
From: jdelisle@loyola.edu

Character Generation: To generate the stats, I use 3d6, arranged to
the player's tastes. For two of the stats, I'm nice and use 4d6,
dropping the lowest die. Of course, if a class/subclass has some
prerequisite (like Stupidity 15 or Sneakiness 14), then I'll make
sure all the requirements are met.

Weapons: Crossbows do more damage than listed in the standard
books. Here's how the new damages break down (ranges and rates of
fire are the same); the left side is for damage against medium
creatures or smaller, the right is for size large creatures or
bigger.
  Light Crossbow:                          1-8 / 1-8
  Heavy Crossbow:                         2-11 / 2-13
  Repeating Crossbow:                      1-6 / 1-6
    (very expensive)
  Hand Crossbow:                           2-5 / 1-4
    (very rare)

  As far as bows are concerned, the only "standard" arrows are
flight arrows. The rest are special purpose arrows, but all have
the same ranges and can be fired from any bow.

                                  Target size
Arrow type                        S-M   L
Armor Piercing                    1-4  1-3
Fire                              2-7  2-7
Flight (regular)                  1-6  1-6
Frog's Crotch                     1-4  1-3
Hummingbulb                       1-3  1-2
Leaf Head                         1-8  1-6
Bird                              1-4  1-2
Hollow-tip                        1-2  1-2
Fishing*                          1-6  1-4

* This arrow does an extra 1-6 hp damage
  if removed without proper precautions.
  Careful removal takes 2-5 rounds.

Armor Piercing: These have a sharp, pointed tip, giving them a +1
to hit (non-magical), but reducing their damage.

Fire: Fire arrows can be used against creatures directly, or to set
combustibles aflame.

Flight: These have a slightly wedge-shaped head, and are the most
commonly available.

Frog's Crotch: Having two blades, this arrow can cut through ropes
and thin chains. They are shaped like a circle with a "V" shape cut
out of the front.

Hummingbulb: This arrow type has a beehive-like tip, which makes it
much harder to carry. Unlike the other arrows, this is not intended
to be aimed at a creature. Instead, it is fired straight up and
produces a high-pitched whistle that can be heard a mile away in
good weather conditions. Hummingbulbs arrows can double as fire
arrows in an emergency, by filling them with straw or paper and
igniting it. Once fired, a hummingbulb arrow is 100% certain to
break on impact, so it can't be re-used.

Leaf Head: Leaf head arrows have a broad but flat tip, and do more
damage when they hit.

Bird: Used for hunting fowl.

Hollow-tip arrows: These are used to carry some a small quantity of
some substance to the target. Listed are some of the non-magical
substances that are used.
         Acid: Target area affected by the acid is a 5" diameter
circle.  The arrow does an additional 1-3 hp to living targets and
exposed objects will also be affected.
         Dust: The target has a +2 saving throws bonus vs. the effects
of magical or mundane dusts contained within.
         Flash: Target blinded for 1-6 rounds by flash powder.
         Gas: Gas affects target in same round, expanding in a 5'
radius centered on target.  All others in area of effect affected
in next round.  Gas dissipates on third round.
         Pepper: Target gains +2 bonus to save vs. effects (usually a
save vs. poison or else sneezing for 2-8 segments, preventing spell
casting and placing a -1 "to hit" penalty on all attacks that
round.
         Poison: 5 inch diameter circle, large enough for one being.
Only insinuative or contact poisons work with this arrow.

Fishing arrows: Hold in wood better (only come out on a roll of 1-2
on 1d6 instead of 1-4 on 1d6 of normal arrows).


Combat

The rumors are true -- I do use critical hits and critical failures
for saving throws. And what characters get, so do the monsters...

For critical hits, I use the Giles crit chart (should be available
at several archives), plus these few modifiers.

Critical Hit Modifiers

The character must first roll a 20 on his/her attack roll, and be able to hit
on a 20 normally. If the weapon has a special power activated on a 20 (like
a vorpal sword), then there is no critical hit -- the magic effect takes
precedence.
        Once a character gets a 20, roll another d20, trying to roll his/her
level or less. The modifiers below are _cumulative_ (so a wizard using a
cursed dagger -1 and a Dexterity of 5 would have a -4 penalty on the level
check roll). The modifiers are added to the character's level, so negative
modifiers are penalties, and positive ones are bonuses.


CLASS:
   wizard (and kits or subclasses): -2
   thief, or psionicist (and kits or subclasses): -1
   fighter (not a multiclass, subclass, or kit): +3
   fighter (multiclass/subclass/kit): +1
   cleric of a battle/warrior god: +1
   cleric of a non-violent diety: -2
   cleric (any other diety): +0

AGILITY:
   Dexterity under 8: -1
   Dexterity 14 to 18: +1
   Dexterity 19 or more: +2

WEAPON USE:
   using weapon not proficient in: -1
   specialized in weapon: +1

UNUSUAL SITUATIONS:
   special reason for poor grip or footing (like weather or magic):
        -1 to -4
   fighting while under a fear, scare, or pain effect: -1 to -3
   fighting while mind is altered (charm, domination, etc): -1
   fighting while under an anger or berserk effect: +1
   vitally important battle (defending home, death feud, etc): +1
   not taking battle seriously: -1 to -10 (DM's discretion)
   not wishing to inflict a crit (practice, etc): -1 to -10
       (accidents _do_ happen!)

MAGICAL/CURSED WEAPONS:
   above average magic weapon (+2 to +4): +1
   extremely powerful magic weapon (+5 or more): +2
   cursed weapon: -1,  +1 if used against friends or allies
   powerfully cursed weapon: -3, +3 if used against friends or allies
   unique or special magic weapon: +2 to +4  (includes artifacts, and
        special purpose weapons (mace of disruption, sword of slay evil))

HIT POINTS:
   attacker at only 50% - 25% of normal hit points: -1
   attacker at less than 25% of normal hit points: -3
   attacker at less than 10% of normal hit points: -5

Multiclassed characters use the best critical hit modifier value (a
fighter/mage uses the multiclassed fighter value).



Classes

All classes, except Priest, are assumed to be "proficient" with a
knife as a weapon, because it is a normal part of life and used
quite often in most cases. If the knife is not chosen as one of the
character's weapons, it can be used with a -1 to hit.

Warrior: Plain fighters (not multiclassed) get what I call
"strength scaling". When the character is rolled, the strength
scores are scaled upwards, so that if a 12 is used as the strength
score, it's treated as a higher score (like a 16 or so), since a
fighter has more time to develop muscular strength than the warrior
subclasses. And it helps give fighters high strength bonuses
without needing a 16+.

Wizard: Mages get several advantages over specialists. First, they
have more weapon proficiency opportunities, being able to learn the
starwheel pistol, balisard, or short sword in addition to the
dagger, sling, or staff.
   When generating a mage, three stats are rolled using the 4d6
(drop one) instead of two.



Magic

Memorization: A mage, specialist, or bard can have as many spells
in his spellbook as desired, and as many spellbooks as he can
afford. The character can memorize as many spells per level as
indicated by the "Maximum Number of Spells per Level" chart under
Intelligence. A wizard with Intelligence of 18 can memorize 18 1st
level spells, 18 2nd level spells, etc.
   If a wizard (but not bard) has a spell that is not memorized,
but in his spellbook, he can try to remember it on a successful
Intelligence and level check (both on a d20), plus modifiers. If
the attempt fails, the wizard can do something else that round. The
modifiers for the level check are quite large for low level spells
(a 50% bonus for 1st level spells), so low level characters have a
good chance of remembering a spell.

Casting: Wizards and bards use the standard Player's Handbook
charts for spellcasting, but the same spell can be cast over.
Material components are used only for higher level spells, or
"specialized" ones (that require a component -- like bodies for
Animate Dead). Spells of a certain level can be "exchanged" for
those of another level, but that doesn't matter to first or second
level characters...

Resting: To restore casting abilities, a wizard (or bard) must
study his spells for one hour per day, and get enough sleep --
either 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep or 10 hours of sleep with one
interruption of less than two hours.

Clerics: To see how many spells a cleric can know, use the "Maximum
Number of Spells per Level" chart under Intelligence, but use the
character's Wisdom instead. Bonus spells mean more spells per day
can be cast; for example, a first level cleric with a bonus 1st
level spell can cast two 1st level spells per day.
   To regain spells, a cleric needs to spend 3 hours per day
praying, but this time can be spread out however seen fit.

Ken Jenks' AD&D House Rules, updated 12/02/92
From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov

I play by AD&D (version 1) rules (PHB, DMG, MM, DDG), with a few spells
from the Unearthed Arcana.  This is my list of interpretations and
variations from the rules in the books.  These have been play-tested in
many dungeons by many DM's over the years.  Feel free to copy, modify,
and use them as you wish.  Attribution is polite and appreciated.

ASSASSINS

Player characters may not be Assassins.

BOOKS

No player may open any Dungeons and Dragons book except the Player's
Handbook or Unearthed Arcana without explicit permission from the DM.

CHARACTERS WITH TWO CLASSES

Only Humans can switch character classes.  Switching character classes
requires lengthy training in the new class:

  Magic-User   4 years
  Cleric, Monk 2 years
  Fighter      1 year
  Thief        1 year

The character retains his hit points, saving throws, and to-hit scores
from his previous class.  When the saving throws or to-hit scores from
the new class exceed those from the previous class, the character can
use the most favorable number.  The character only gains more hit
points when the level in the new class exceeds the level in the old
class.  Except for Bards, humans can only have two classes.  Psionic
disciplines increase in level of mastery every time the character
advances one level.  If a character with two classes is affected by
Energy Drain, levels from the second class are affected first, then the
previous class.

CLERICS

Clerics may not use cutting or stabbing weapons.  The only exception is
that a cleric whose holy symbol is a cutting or stabbing weapon (cleric
of Tyr, cleric of Poseidon) may use a non-magical version of that
weapon.

Spell variances and interpretations:

All Cure Wounds spells cure a minimum number of hit points equal to
half the level of the cleric casting the spell (round even), so a
seventh level cleric casting a Cure Serious Wounds (2d8+1) cures a
minimum of 7/2 -> 4 HP.

1
  LIGHT

  See "LIGHT AND DARKNESS SPELLS" above.

  RESIST COLD

  This spell is not cumulative with other Resist Cold spells.

2
  RESIST FIRE

  This spell is not cumulative with other Resist Fire spells.

  SLOW POISON

  This spell can counter the effects of Stinking Cloud or Cloudkill.
  Note that it must be cast on bare feet.

3
  CURE DISEASE

  This spell has a casting time of one round, not one turn as stated.

  DISPEL MAGIC

  See "DISPEL MAGIC" below.

  PRAYER

  Prayer is not cumulative, except with Chant spells cast by clerics
  of the same deity.

5
  RAISE DEAD

  Note that Elves and Half-Orcs cannot be Raised.

CRITICAL HITS AND FUMBLES

There are no critical hits or fumbles; they only hurt the player
characters in the long run.  A 20 doesn't always hit, and a 1 doesn't
always miss.

DEATH AND RESURRECTION

If a character dies and is brought back to life with a Raise Dead or
Resurrection spell, he loses a point of Constitution, and must either
rest at least one week or get a Heal spell cast on him.  If he is
brought back by Wish or divine intervention, he suffers no ill
effects.  A properly-phrased Limited Wish (just prior to the Raise Dead
or Resurrection) can prevent the Consitution loss.

Elves and Half-Orcs cannot be Raised or Resurrected.

DISARMING

According to the PHB, a creature weilding a Ranseur or a Spetum can
disarm his opponent by rolling a to-hit against AC 8.  I add the
following restrictions to this:  1) that armor class is modified by the
defender's DEX and items of protection (rings, cloaks, etc.)  2) After
a successful roll, the opponents square off STR vs. STR in Champions
style: each opponent (disarmer and defender) roll 1d6 for each point of
Strength, counting each category for STR over 18 (see table).  Add two
dice for each "plus" of magic weapons.  Add up the totals; the one with
the higher total wins.

So if a fire giant (Strength 22, 25 dice) using a Ranseur tries to
disarm a fighter (Strength 17 with +2 sword, 17+4=19 dice), the fire
giant rolls 27 dice, and the fighter rolls 19.  If the giant wins, the
sword goes shwing! but if the fighter wins, he keeps his weapon and
gets to beat up the giant.

  STR          Dice
  ---          ----
  17           17d6
  18           18d6
  18/01-18/50  19d6
  18/51-18/75  20d6
  18/76-18/90  21d6
  18/91-18/99  22d6
  18/00        23d6
  19           24d6
  20           25d6
  21           26d6
  22           27d6
  23           28d6
  24           29d6
  25           30d6

DISPEL MAGIC

Dispel Magic can be cast either on an area or on one particular magic
item.  If the spell is cast on an area, all spells within the area of
affect are subject to being dispelled, but magic items and the affects
of potions which have already been imbibed are not affected.  If the
spell is cast on one particular magic item, the item will be made
inoperative for one round (if it's in the possession of a creature, it
gets a saving throw.)

Dispel Magic has no affect on Wall of Force, Anti-Magic Shell, or
potions contained in a closed Bag of Holding or Portable Hole or
similar magical device.

Dispel Magic can only affect spells within its area of effect, so a
Dispel Magic might only be able to eat small holes out of a large Wall
of Stone.

DROPPING THINGS

As per DMG1, p. 64, a dropped boulder (or any heavy weight) will do
damage as follows: each 14 lbs. of weight will inflict one point of
damage per foot of distance dropped between 10' and 60'.

DRUIDS

At fourth level, Druids can communicate with non-magical animals, but
they still need the Speak with Animals spell to encourage the animals
to be friendly.

EXPERIENCE POINTS

Characters gain experience for completing missions, solving clues,
evading enemies, making allies, dealing with traps, and many other
things in addition to killing monsters and taking home treasure.

Characters may only gain enough experience in one adventure to place
them at the top of the next level.  For example, if a starting
Prestidigitator manages to Charm an Archmage, he may only gain 5000 xp
from the feat (plus the immediate, but not lasting, friendship of
the Mage).

When a character gains sufficient experience to reach the next level,
he may continue gaining experience until he reaches the top of that
level, but may gain no more until trained up to that level.

Training must be guided by a name level character or a character two
levels greater than the trainee's destination level, whichever is
less.  If this guided training is not used, self-training is possible,
but will take twice the time and twice the expense (normally 1500
gp/level -- that's the PREVIOUS level).  With guided training, it
actually costs the trainer only 1000 gp/level to train a lower-level
character, and some trainers will pass along only that cost to
trainees.

FIGHTERS

Fighters, but not Paladins and Rangers, are allowed to use the "per
level advancement" option (DMG1, p. 74), which basically allows
even-level Fighters +1 to hit.

HIT POINTS

When a player character rolls his starting hit points, the first die
must be re-rolled until it is greater than 50% of the maximum for that
die (i.e. 3 or more on a d4, 4 or more on a d6, 5+ on d8, 6+ on d10).

First level Rangers and Monks get their HP bonus due to Constitution
twice -- once for each Hit Die.  Characters above name level still get
their Constitution bonus for gaining hit points at each level, even
when they no longer roll Hit Dice.

  Hit
 Points     State
1 or more   Concious, active
0 to -4     Unconcious, stable (not "bleeding")
-5 to -9    Unconcious, unstable (losing 1 HP/round)
-10 or less Dead

If a creature is Cured, Healed, etc. in the same round he reaches -10
HP (exactly), he'll live.  If he goes below -10, he's dead.

Binding wounds stabilizes the creature and stops the 1 HP/round loss,
but does not restore any lost Hit Points.

ILLUSIONISTS

Illusionists must roll their chances to learn spells in the same
manner as magic-users (see below).

INITIATIVE

Each party (usually characters and monsters) rolls 1d6 for initiative.
One Player rolls initiative until he loses initiative to the Monsters,
then the roll passes to the next Player to the left.  In each melee
round, the Player to the left of the person who rolled initiative goes
first, and so on around the table to the left.  Between the Players and
the Monsters, highest roll goes first, with two modifiers:

  (1) dexterity bonus/penalty for creatures hurling missiles,
  (2) weapon speed factor and spell casting time when spell casters
      are in combat,

INITIATIVE TIES AND WEAPON SPEED FACTOR

DMG1, p 66, sez:

"When weapon speed factor is the determinant of which opponent strikes
first in a melee round, there is a chance that one opponent will be
entitled to multiple attacks.  [...] If the difference [in speed
factors between fast and slow weapons] is at least twice the factor of
the [faster], or 5 of more factors in any case, the opponent with the
[fast] weapon is entitled to 2 attacks before the opponent with the
[slow weapon] is entitled to any attack whatsoever.  If the difference
is 10 or more, the [fast weapon gets] 2 attacks before [...] and 1
further attack at the same time as [the slow weapon]."

Sheesh.  No wonder the second edition is selling so well.  The whole
section is very poorly written, and open to many interpretations.
Here's how I interpret it:

The only time weapon speed factors give multiple attacks is during
initiative ties.  On a tie, we compare speed factors.  If the
difference in speed factors between slower (S) and faster (F) weapons
is either twice the faster weapon (S - F >= 2 x F) or five (S - F >= 5)
then the faster weapon gets two attacks.

However, if the difference in speed factors between slower (S) and
faster (F) weapons is 10 or more (S - F >= 10) then the faster weapon
gets three attacks.

This is of great advantage to monks (open hand speed factor = 1) and
dagger users (Speed 2), especially since most fighters use short swords
(Speed 4) or longswords or broadswords (Speed 5).  Monks love
initiative ties, especially in their multiple attack rounds.

The only other interpretation is what to do when there's more than one
attack routine.  I only allow the first attack routine to get these
multiple attacks due to speed factors.

INITIATIVE: WEAPON SPEED FACTOR vs. SPELL CASTING TIME

The next paragraph (DMG1, p. 66) talks about weapon speed factors vs.
spell casting times, and using weapon strikes to disrupt spell casting,
which I loosely interpret as follows:

Take the weapon speed factor (W) spell casting time (C), and the
initiative die rolls of the weaponeer and the spell caster (DW and DC).
  If DW-W < DC-C, the spell caster goes first;
  if DW-W > DC-C, the weapon slinger goes first;
  if DW-W = DC-C, tie.
If it's a tie or the weaponeer goes first, spell caster gets no
dexterity bonus to armor class.  If the spell caster is hit with a
weapon before his spell goes off, it's disrupted and lost.  Bummer.  If
it's a tie, the spell goes off even if the spell caster gets hit.
(Picture both parties lying on the floor.)

Missile weapons have speed factor zero minus the missile-slinger's
Reaction/Attacking Adjustment due to dexterity.  So for a thief with a
17 DEX throwing daggers, that's a speed factor of -2.  This disrupts
spells easily.

To follow the examples in DMG1, p. 67, Abner (MU 5) and Gutboy
Barrelhouse (F 6) are quareling.  Abner is planning to use a Fireball
(casting time C=3), Barrelhouse is swinging a longsword (Speed W=5)
(don't ask ME how a 48 inch tall dwarf can swing a 42 inch long
sword one-handed; this is fantasy).

Abner rolls his initiative die, DC = 5; Barrelhouse rolls DW = 4.
DW - W = 4 - 5 = -1
DC - C = 5 - 3 = 1

DW-W < DC-C so the Fireball goes first (at melee range, yet).

Now, suppose Barrelhouse is using a dagger (Speed W=2).  Same rolls.
DW - W = 4 - 2 = 2
DC - C = 5 - 3 = 1

Now, DW-W > DC-C so the dagger goes first, and Abner gets no DEX bonus
to AC.  If Barrelhouse hits, the Fireball is disrupted.  Good luck,
Abner.

Just to illuminate my missile weapon interpretation, suppose
Barrelhouse has a 17 DEX (racial maximum for a dwarf) and is
hurling a dagger at Abner.  Same rolls.
DW - W = 4 - (-2) = 6
DC - C = 5 -   3  = 1

Again, DW-W > DC-C so the dagger goes first.

LIGHT AND DARKNESS SPELLS

Light spells and Darkness spells (both temporary and Continual
varieties) are inherently different.  Light spells radiate from a
point, and the light is blocked by opaque barriers (walls, etc.), but
Darkness spells permeate the whole area, regardless of intervening
physical barriers.

When a Darkness spell is cast after a Light spell, the whole area goes
dark, and any Light spells in the area are dispelled.  When a Light
spell is cast after a Darkness spell, the Darkness is dispelled in the
area where they overlap.  If two rocks with Continual Darkness and
Continual Light spells cast on them are brought within 60 feet, the one
which was cast most recently takes precedence, and the other (older)
spell is dispelled.

MAGIC JAR AND POSSESSION

The spell caster cannot cast spells or use psionics if he's not in his
own body.  While the spell caster inhabits a body, the soul of that
body is trapped in the Soul Gem.  If the body dies or has a successful
Exorcism, the spell caster either "snaps" back to his own body or, if
it has been destroyed while he's away, snaps back to the Soul Gem, from
which he can attempt to possess creatures within line of sight of the
Gem at a rate of one attempt per round.  If the Gem is destroyed while
a soul is in it, the soul is destroyed (no Raise Dead, Resurrection, or
Reincarnation).

MAGIC RESISTANCE

As stated in the front of the Monster Manual (MM1), magic resistance
varies with the level of the spell caster by -/+5% per level difference
from 11th level.  Magic resistance generally only applies to spells and
magical effects which duplicate spells.  It does not apply to dragon
breath weapons, magical swords, magic items, etc., but it would apply
to spells cast by spell-using dragons or special abilities of
intelligent swords.

MAGIC USERS

Magic-users do not have to roll their "chance to know" spells for spells
they gain during initial training or when training up to the next level.

Reversible spells and their normal counterparts are both memorizable
from the same entry in the spell book, but only one roll "to know" is
needed for a spell and its reversal, and the pair only takes one entry
in the spell book.

Spell variances and interpretations:
1
  ENLARGE (REVERSAL)

  This spell will reduce the size of the target by dividing the
  initial size by (1 + 0.2/level) on creatures or (1 + 0.1/level)
  on non-living objects.  (This eliminates any confusion about
  Reduce making objects reduce by 100% so that they disappear.)

  FIND FAMILIAR

  The familiar stays with the Magic-User for one year.  At the end of
  each year, if both the familiar and the magic-user want to remain
  together, they must go through the same ceremony to renew the spell.
  Otherwise, the mystical bond is broken.  When a familiar is within
  one mile of the Magic-User, they can share each other's senses at
  will.

  LIGHT

  See "LIGHT AND DARKNESS SPELLS" above.

  NYSTUL'S MAGIC AURA

  This spell is permanent until dispelled.

2
  INVISIBILITY

  If you become invisible, then pick up a bottle of beer, the bottle of
  beer becomes invisible, too.  When you put down that bottle of beer,
  it becomes visible again.  If you drink the beer, the beer becomes
  invisible.  You can't read a book or a scroll while invisible unless
  you're not carrying it.

  Note that there are two ways to find invisible opponents:  (1) Detect
  Invisibility, True Seeing, Gem of Seeing, pseudo-dragon familiar, or
  similar magics, and (2) the "natural" chance to see invisible creatures
  (DMG1, p. 60).  The first way shows exactly what's there, what he looks
  like, and gives the detector no penalties for combatting the invisible
  opponent.  The second way gives vague hints that there's an invisible
  creature around and allows the detector to attack at -4 on to-hit
  dice.

3
  DISPEL MAGIC

  See "DISPEL MAGIC" above.

  HASTE

  Haste does not age recipients if used to counter the effects of a
  Slow spell or similar magical effect.

  INVISIBILITY 10' RADIUS

  All of the creatures within a 10' radius of the target creature AT
  THE TIME OF THE CASTING are affected as if by an Invisibility spell,
  even if they leave the 10' radius after the spell is cast.  If the
  target creature attacks, the whole group becomes visible.  If any
  other affected creatures attack, only that creature becomes visible.

5
  MAGIC JAR

  See "MAGIC JAR AND POSSESSION" above.

  WALL OF FORCE

  Blocks Teleport and related spells in both directions, but does
  not extend to Astral or Ethereal planes, so plane travel can
  bypass the Wall.

6
  ANTI-MAGIC SHELLS

  An Anti-Magic Shell spell moves with the spell caster.  Magic
  Resistance does not apply to Anti-Magic Shells.  Creatures who are
  only struck by magic weapons may be hard to hurt inside of Anti-Magic
  Shells, but monsters with sufficient Hit Dice will be able to harm
  them.  Psionics function normally in Anti-Magic Shells.  Anti-Magic
  Shell spells cannot be made permanent except via Wish.  Anti-Magic
  Shell spells are not affected by Dispel Magic.  If an Anti-Magic
  Shell overlaps a Prismatic Sphere, Prismatic Wall or a Wall of Force,
  whichever was in that location first will take precedence.  If an
  Anti-Magic Shell is moved into contact with a Prismatic Sphere,
  Prismatic Wall or Wall of Force, the Sphere or Wall will not be
  affected.

9
  PRISMATIC SPHERE

  I don't allow Blink, Teleport, Dimension Door, or Teleport w/o Error
  through a Prismatic Sphere (or Wall of Force).  I do allow
  plane-shifting spells like Plane Shift, Astral Spell, and the
  equivalent psionic disciplines, since they don't go "through" the
  sphere.

  The spell caster can move in/out at will, but he can't see
  through the sphere (it's opaque to everyone) and nobody can cast
  spells through it (even if they make their MR).

  The Sphere filters out all gasses except O2 going in and an equal
  volume of CO2 going out.  These can pass through at a "gentle breeze"
  (no hurricanes).

  Anybody or anything inside a Prismatic Sphere CANNOT be found
  or detected by anybody or anything outside the Sphere.  It takes
  the personal intervention of a Greater God to locate something
  inside a Prismatic Sphere.

  WISH

  See "WISHES" below.

OIL, FLAMING

A hurled glass flask of flaming oil must MISS a saving throw vs.
crushing blow (20 on d20) in order to break and catch fire.  Flaming
oil does 2d4 hit points of damage, maybe more against especially
flamable opponents.

PARRYING

If you choose to parry (PHB1, p. 104, "Melee Combat" paragraph),
subtract all of the following from your Armor Class:
  1) Your strength bonus "to-hit"
  2) Any magical bonus(es) in the weapon(s)
  3) two
For example, a thief with an 18 DEX, wearing leather armor (AC 8)
chooses to parry instead of attacking.  He's using a +1 sword and
a +2 dagger, and has a 17 STR.  His base AC (leather and DEX) is
AC 4.  When parrying, he subtracts:
  1) 1 (because 17 STR gives +1 to-hit)
  2) 3 (1 from sword, 2 from dagger)
  3) 2 (because he's parrying)
so his total AC is 4 - 6 = -2.  (Pretty good, for a thief.)

PSIONICS

Only Humans and monsters can be psionic.  The "Psionic Ability" listed
for monsters is the total of attack strength plus defense strength.

Energy Control is not allowed (roll again).

Psionic disciplines are gained at odd levels (first Minor at first
level, next discipline at 3rd, etc.).  Level of Mastery is first when
the character gains the discipline, and increases once each character
level thereafter.  For example, Angellica discovers she is psionic.
She rolls an 82 and gets 3 Minors, 2 Majors.  They are:  (1) Detection
of Magic, (2) Cell Adjustment, (3) Animal Telepathy, (4) Astral
Projection, and (5) Telepathy.  At first level, she gets Detection of
Magic at 1st Level of Mastery.  At third level, she gains Cell
Adjustment at 1st Level of Mastery, but Detection of Magic is now at
3rd Level of Mastery.

If they concentrate for one round, psionics can sense other psionics
or psionic-related powers within a radius equal to the longest range
of their psionic attack modes (between 5" and 18").

During psionic combat, each combatant can sense the attack mode of
every attacker during each segment and may choose the most efficient
defense mode from the table.  A psionic who takes physical damage in a
segment may defend, but may not attack psionically for the rest of the
round.

Psionic creatures are immune to psionic attack while asleep or
unconcious.

Psionic creatures may either attack psionically (once per segment) or
use a psionic discipline (once per round), but not both, during a
round.

REGENERATION

If a character is wearing a Ring of Regeneration, he can only
regenerate damage he takes while wearing the Ring.  (This precludes
passing the Ring around the party until everybody is healed up.)
Damage from acid or fire must be logged separately, since it cannot be
regenerated (this also applies to other forms of regeneration).

SCROLLS

When read by the writer, spells are cast at the reader's current
level.  When read by anybody else, spells are cast at either 6th level
or the minimum necessary to cast the spell (whichever is greater),
unless special preparations (costing double) are made to allow ANY
reader to cast the spell at the level of the writer.  Scribing scrolls
normally costs 100 gp per spell level.

STATS

Starting player characters roll 4d6 and add the highest three dice for
stats.  Repeat this six times; one each for Strength, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.  Rearrange scores at
will within these stats.  When you're done, you may roll 4d6 adding the
highest three dice for a Comliness score, but I ignore Comliness
completely.

While you're rolling and arranging, choose a race and a class.  Most of
my world is Human, and most magic items are sized for Humans.  I'm
strict about level restrictions for non-Humans, too.  Elves and
Half-Orcs cannot be Raised or Resurrected.  (I recommend Human.)

When you've chosen a race and a class, roll for age then apply aging
adjustments to your stats.  They usually help.  They are cumulative, so
a Mature character gains +1 Strength and +1 Con.  (Human Rangers are
automatically Mature, and with a 14 Con minimum, raised to a 15 by
Aging, Rangers always have at least +1 HP to each Hit Die.)

SURPRISE

When two parties encounter each other, each rolls a d6.  If either
party rolls a 1 or a 2, that party is surprised.  Subtract dice to find
out how many "surprise segments" are granted to the surprising party.
If members of the surprised party have a 16 or greater Dexterity, they
will negate one or more segments of surprise.  Each surprise segment is
treated as a complete round for melee combat, but spell casting is
unaffected except that the surprising spell caster can BEGIN casting
spells during the first surprise segment.  Missile combat is at triple
normal fire rate if the missile weapons are in-hand in sufficient
number (DMG1, p. 62).

THIEVES

Thieves can find and remove magical traps with their normal
percentages.

During a backstab attack, ALL damage inflicted by the attack routine is
multiplied, including second weapon, strength and magical bonuses, but
excluding damage caused by a Shocking Grasp spell.

TWO WEAPONS

Any character class may use two weapons, but the second weapon must be
either a dagger or handaxe (precluding most clerics).  See DMG1, p. 70,
for details.  The second weapon may be used once per attack routine.
Thieves using two weapons are allowed their damage multiplier on each
weapon that hits during the first attack routine.

UNEARTHED ARCANA

The only things I use from the Unearthed Arcana are a few spells and
magic items.  No weapon specialization, no Cavaliers, no Barbarians.
No "full plate armor."

Magic-users and Illusionists will occasionally receive UA
spells, but no cantrips.  Clerics and Druids (etc.) may memorize or
cast the following UA spells:

  Cleric:
    1: Ceremony (Clerics [not Paladins] can cast this at will),
       Combine
    2: Detect Life, Enthrall, Holy Symbol, Messenger
    3: Death's Door, Negative Plane Protection, Remove Paralysis,
       Water Walk
    4: Abjure, Cloak of Fear
    5: Animate Dead Monsters, Golem, Magic Font
    6: Forbiddance
    7: Exaction

  Druid:
    1: Ceremony (Druids [not Rangers or Bards] can cast this at will),
       Detect Poison, Precipitation
    2: Flame Blade, Reflecting Pool, Slow Poison
    3: Spike Growth, Starshine
    5: Moonbeam, Spike Stones
    6: Loveoak, Transmute Water to Dust
    7: Changestaff, Sunray

Other UA spells may adversely affect the balance or flavor of the game.

WISDOM BONUS TO NUMBER OF SPELLS MEMORIZABLE

All classes able to cast clerical-type spells may gain bonus spells
from high Wisdom, including Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Rangers and
Bards.

WISHES

Any reasonably worded Wish to (a) bring back dead party members, (b)
heal the party, or (c) transport the party to a safe location will
probably work.  Any greedy Wish is subject to the DM's whim.  All Wish
spells cast by magic-users except (a) through (c) will cause 3 years of
aging and require a lengthy recovery time.  Any Wish spell put into a
Ring of Wishes or similar device will likewise cause aging at the time
when the device is created.

One Wish can raise one stat one point up to a maximum of 16, then
1/10th of a point (or 10% on Exceptional Strength) thereafter.
One Wish is required to go from 18/00 to 19 Strength.

One Wish can allow a non-human to exceed his racial maximum level by
one level.  Note that the Wish doesn't give the character the
experience or training to go up another level; it just by-passes the
maximum for this level.

ERRATA

One of the old Dragon Magazines -- I forget which issue -- published a
list of "Errata" to the DMG1.  I dutifully incorporated these in my
DMG1 (I believe mine is from the second printing, 1979), and they form
part of the rules I play by.  I have similar corrections for the PHB1.
Since not everybody has these corrections, I'll include them in this
file.

DMG1, p. 13.
  In the paragraph marked "Middle Aged:" delete the words in
  parenthesis.  The CUMULATIVE aging adjustments are:
    Young Adult: Wis-1, Con+1
    Mature:      Str+1, Con+1
    Middle Aged: Int+1, Wis+1
    Old:         Str-2, Dex-2, Con-1, Wis+2
    Venerable:   Str-3, Dex-3, Con-2, Int+1, Wis+3

DMG1, p. 21.
  There's an inserted paragraph about bonus (beyond the table on p. 85)
  experience point value for assassinating a character.  Since only
  NPC's can be Assassins in my game, and since NPC experience points
  are really assigned by the DM (me), I'll just summarize: Assassin
  receives 100 xp per level of deceased +/- 50 xp times (level of
  Assassin minus level of deceased).  These xp are multiplied by some
  "degree of difficulty of the mission" values: times 0.5 for "simple,"
  times 1 for "difficult," and times 1.5 for "extraordinary" (see
  SPYING, p.18).

DMG1, p. 39.
  After the section on "Acquisition of Magic-User Spells," there's
  an insertion entitled "Acquisition of Illusionist Spells."

  "Illusionists do not need the spell Read Magic or anything like it in
  pursuit of their profession.  All illusionist spell books and scrolls
  are written in a secret tongue which every apprentice learns from his
  or her mentor.  This arcane and difficult language is common to all
  phantasmal magics, and is necessary for illusionistic conjuring.
  When an illusionist gains Read Magic at the 14th level (along with
  several other 1st level magic-user spells), this merely allows him or
  her to utilize magic-user scrolls that contain spells different from
  those on the illusionists' list.

  "When a 1st level illusionist receives his first level spell book
  from his master, it contains only three spells (Read Magic being
  unnecessary).  The DM should require the player's character to roll a
  d12 on the table of 1st level illusionist spells, rolling three times
  and ignoring any rolls that result in duplication.  If a DM feels his
  or her campaign is unusually difficult, he or she may allow the
  player to choose one or even two of these initial spells."

DMG1, p. 42.
  There's a further explanation of the fourth level Clerical spell,
  Sticks to Snakes:

  "Poison: AC 5, MV 15", HD 1, D: 1+poison
   Normal: AC 5, MV 12", HD 3, D: 2-5"

DMG1, p. 43.
  Restoration ages the caster by 2 years.
  Resurrection ages the caster by 3 years.

DMG1, p. 46.
  Reincarnation: change to "See the DRUIDICAL spell..." (not CLERIC).

DMG1, p. 52.
  Change first sentence of paragraph entitled "Fly spell:"

  "Utilizing a Fly spell takes as much concentration as walking, so
  most spells could be cast while Flying, either while hovering or
  moving slowly (3" or less)."

DMG1, p. 62.
  Change table marked "Party's Die"/"Monster's Die" to read:

  Party's  Monsters'  Surprise
   Die       Die      Effect
  3 to 6    3 to 6    none
    1         1       both surprised
    2         2       both surprised
  1 or 2    3 to 6    party surprised
  3 to 6    1 or 2    monsters surprised
    2         1       monsters surprised
    1         2       party surprised

DMG1, p. 71.
  There are numerous errors in the Example of Melee.  For example,
  Arlanni the Thief is using a sling with bullets (not a bow with
  arrows -- she's a Thief!).  Aggro needs a base 8 to hit Balto, and
  his adjusted amount is only 6.  Later on, Balto uses a staff (he's a
  Monk!) and gets the -7 AC adjustment for staff vs. plate & shield.
  When Arkayn chooses to attempt to hit Gutboy, Arkayn needs a base 17
  to hit AC 1.  When Blastum's Shocking Grasp "kills" Arlanni, and
  Aggro's axe "kills" Balto, they're really only knocked negative by a
  few HP (-2 and -3 respectively), and p. 82 ("Zero Hit Points") says
  they're just unconcious, not dead.

  (I find it amusing that the bottom of that same page states that "An
  experienced DM can do it with only an occasional reference to the
  tables (though it is not recommended that you try this -- wait until
  it comes naturally).")

DMG1, p. 73.
  There's a change to the "Opponents With Weapons Used Normally"
  paragraph:

  "If the opponent of a grappling, pummeling or overbearing attack has
  a weapon, the opponent will always strike first unless the attacker
  has surprise.  Any weapon hit does NO damage, but it does indicate
  that the attacker trying to grapple, pummel or overbear has been
  fended or driven off, and the attack is unsuccessful.  The
  weapon-wielder then has the opportunity to strike at the weaponless
  one "for real," if he or she so chooses.  Surprised opponents with
  weapons have no chance for a fending-off strike, unless the attacker
  must use all surprise segments to close to grapple, pummel or
  overbear."

DMG1, p. 74.
  There's a change to the note under the Fighter's table, "I.B.":

  "*Note: Half-elves use the attack matrix as elves do, while non-player
          character half-orcs use the attack matrix for monsters.
          Dwarves, elves and gnomes are never lower than 1st level
          (unlike halflings and humans, which may be 0 level).  Bards
          fight at their highest level of FIGHTER experience."

DMG1, p. 116.
  Change the "Poison" paragraph:

  "Only assassins of 9th level or higher may concoct "potions" of
  poison -- or any other sort of poison for that matter.  Refer to the
  section on assassins for details on special forms of poison.  No
  laboratory or alchemist is needed, but cost and time are found as if
  a normal potion was [sic] being prepared."

DMG1, p. 118.
  After "Fabrication Of Magic Items By Charmed Or Enslaved Magic-Users:"
  paragraph:

  "FABRICATION OF MAGIC ITEMS BY ILLUSIONISTS:
  Though different spells are employed, the process of fabrication of
  magic items which illusionists use is not really very different from
  that used by magic-users.  It is almost exactly similar [huh?] as
  regards costs in both time and money.  Some processes are also nearly
  identical, such as the making of scrolls, which may be done at the
  7th level and up.

  "At the 11th level illusionists may be able to create one-shot or
  charged magic items, things without a permanent dweomer, such as
  potions or a Wand of Illusion, for example.  Such items are really
  merely storehouses of magical energy which can be released in various
  ways.  Like any other spell-caster, the illusionist must fashion the
  item out of rare and expensive materials, but instead of using
  Enchant an Item to prepare the item to receive its enchantment, the
  illusionist uses Major Creation to subtly alter its structure in a
  magical direction so that it can receive and retain the necessary
  spells.  During the next 16 hours after casting the Major Creation,
  the illusionist instills the primary initial dweomer into the item,
  and if his concentration is disrupted even once during this period,
  the item instantly fades and forever disappears, like an illusion
  that has been dispelled.

  "Beginning at 14th level an illusionist may attempt to make items
  with a truly permanent dweomer, such as a +1 dagger or a Ring of
  Protection, for example.  This entails a similar process to the one
  described above.  The crucial difference is that after a Major
  Creation spell has been used to adjust the material object, an
  Alter Reality spell must be cast to fix it permanently in place
  and make it able to contain a permanent magic.  Thus, with a
  great expense in time, money and preparation, Major Creation,
  Alter Reality, and True Sight spells, and an unflawed gem of not
  less than 10,000 g.p., an illusionist might be able to create a
  Gem of Seeing.

  "The basic thing to remember if details are in question is that
  illusionists are a sub-class of magic-users, and except for what
  has been outlined above, what applies to magic-users applies to
  illusionists as well."

DMG1, p. 121.
  G.P. sale values for Giant Control and Giant Strength potions were
  reversed; the table should read:

  35-36  Giant Control*      400-900     900-1,400
  37-39  Giant Strength* (F) 500-750   1,000-6,000

  (In my campaign, I also change potion of Polymorh to 500 xp/1500 gp.)

DMG1, p. 123.
  Dust of Disappearance        2,000       8,000
  Dust of Sneezing and Choking  ---        1,000

  (In my campaign, I also change Girdle of Giant Strength considerably.)

DMG1, p. 125.
  The "drink-half-a-potion" rule: The corrected rule comes after the
  paragraph which ends:

  "might smell, taste, and look differently [sic]."

  Corrected rule:
  "Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a potion will last for 4
  complete turns plus 1-4 additional turns (d4).  If half of a potion
  is quaffed, the effects will last one-half as long in some cases.
  Potions take effect 2-5 segments AFTER they are imbibed."

DMG1, p. 145.
  Change table for Girdle of Giant Strength to be consistent with
  Potion of Giant Strength:

          Weight             Base   Rock    Bend Bars/
  Type   Allowance   Range  Damage  Wt.**   Lift Gates
  Hill    +4,500       8"    1-6    140        50%
  Stone   +5,000      16"    1-12   198        60%
  Frost   +6,000      10"    1-8    156        70%
  Fire    +7,500      12"    1-8    170        80%
  Cloud   +9,000      14"    1-10   184        90%
  Storm  +12,000      16"    1-12   212       100%

DMG1, p. 167.
  Replace Table 3.: Sword Primary Abilities:

  Die
  Roll   Ability
  01-11  detect "elevator"/shifting rooms/walls in a 1" radius
  12-22  detect sloping passages in a 1" radius
  23-33  detect traps of large size in a 1" radius
  34-44  detect evil/good in a 1" radius
  45-55  detect precious metals, kind, and amount in a 2" radius
  56-66  detect gems, kind, and number in a 1/2" radius
  67-77  detect magic in a 1" radius
  78-82  detect secret doors in a 1/2" radius
  83-87  detect invisible objects in a 1" radius
  88-92  Locate Object in a 12" radius
  93-98  roll twice on this table ignoring scores of 93 to 00
  99-00  roll on the Extraordinary Power Table instead

  [Ever notice that most of the munchkin-owned intelligent swords
  in the world somehow managed to roll 99-00 on this table?]

DMG1, p. 169.
  Replace description of Mace of Disruption with:

  "Mace of Disruption appears to be a +1 mace, but it has a neutral
   good alignment, and any evil character touching it will take 5-20
   points of damage due to the powerful enchantments laid upon the
   weapon.  If a Mace of Disruption strikes any undead creature or evil
   creature from one of the lower planes it functions similarly to a
   cleric turning undead (see ATTACK MATRICES).  The Mace causes all
   such creatures to roll on matrix III., MATRIX FOR CLERICS AFFECTING
   UNDEAD, as if the wielder were 12th level, and if the creature
   struck scores equal to or below [they mean "above"] the number
   shown, it is disrupted and slain.  Thus, skeletons, zombies, ghouls,
   shadows, and wights are instantly blasted out of existence, as are
   ghasts and even wraiths; and mummies have only a 20% chance,
   spectres 35%, vampires 50%, ghosts 65%, liches 80%, and other
   affected evil creatures 95% chance of saving.  Even if these saving
   throws are effective, the Mace of Disruption scores double damage
   upon opponents of this sort, i.e., 2x bonus and 2x dice."

DMG1, p. 174.
  In paragraph starting "Greater monsters on higher levels..." change
  "trolls" to "shadows."

Disarming Rules

From: brunborg@alkymi.unit.no (Aadne Brunborg)

This system is based on the princip that it's harder to disarm ar opponent when
he's a better fighting man than you, and is not based on what armor type he's
wearing.


In order to disarm an opponent, the attacker must make a successful attack vs.
DAC (DAC=DisArmorClass).

DAC =    baseTHAC0
        -19("disarm-factor")
        -(to-hit-bonus for strenght and specialisation)
        -(penalty for non-proficency)
        -(AC-bonus for dexterity)
        -(magical bonuses on defender's armor (not counting shield)
        -1(if defender's weapon has a basket hilt)


The "disarm-factor" is decided like this:
        Joe Average is fighting his cousin Bill Average. They both have Average
        ability scores (8-12). Joe decides to disarm Bill. They are both 1st
        level fighters using long swords, in which they are proficent. The
        question is: What number need Joe to roll to disarm Bill? This number
        is the "disarm-factor". In my ruling, this number is 19, and this
        _includes_ the -4 penalty for called shot to arm. So, Joe tells the DM
        that he will disarm Bill. He rolls a 17. He hits the hilt of Bill's
        sword, but not good enough to disarm him.
        The DM may modify this factor as he likes.


Any disarm attempt causes no damage, as the blow is directed against the weapon
and not the man behind it. A disarm MUST be declared in advance, before
initiative is rolled, or the attack is concidered a normal attack.

Example:Dr Izt Igot Euf, an 8th level ranger armed with a long sword +3 and a
        strenght of 18(64) (+2/+3), decides to try to disarm Timok Swordhawk,
        an 8th level fighter with long sword +3, strenght of 18(76) (+2/+4),
        dex of 16 and double-specialist in longsword (+3/+3).
        Dr Izt's modified THAC0 is: 13(base)-3(magic)-2(strenght)=8

        Timok's DAC is: 13(baseTHAC0)-19-(2+3)(strenght and specialisation)
        -2(AC bonus for dex)=-13

        ie. the ranger must hit AC-13 to disarm the fighter.

Death's Door Rules


From:   ross@LCLARK.EDU  (Anthony Ross)

INTRODUCTION
        Over christmas break I was in Syria visiting my parents with
little to do (except for my thesis and graduate school applications!)
except read over net stuff and think about rules. The following is a
synthesis of three different house rules posted in the last several months
for characters who are on "death's door." I realize that I am violating
netequitte in not citing the origional poster's names, especially since a
lot of what is below are direct quotes from their posts, but I lost their
names in the process of ging through a mountina of stuff on disk. In any
event, I hope they won't mind as all I'm trying to do is further the game
of AD&D and spread some ideas.  With that long-winded introduction and
disclaimer...here goes:

THE RULES
        You are fully active and whole from what ever your current maximum
might be to 1 Hit Point. You are envigorated and almost otherworldly if you
some how have more that your maximum hit points..from an AID spell or a potion
of HEROISM, etc.

       At 0 hit points you are stable and unconscious. This means that you will
lie there breathing shallowly, faint heart beat, and flickering eyelids
until you have rested enough to regain that 1 hit point.  Then you awaken fully
healthy and hale, ready to do battle and fully active, but with only 1 hit
point.

        A charecter does not die untill the negative hit points of damage
he/she has taken reaches 1 over his/her constitution. This way "healthier"
charecters have better odds of surviving than weak and frail ones.

        If you should take damage to -1 or lower then you are automatically
unconscious AND FALLING!! This means that unless one of the following is
being done, you continue to drop 1 hit point per round:

       1. Someone is actively trying to save your life with bandages, CPR and
       clearing your throat of blood and other unpleasantries, in doing this
       they may restore one hit point per round until you reach 0 hitpoints.
       2. Someone casts a healing spell bringing you to 0 hit points.*
       3. Someone uses a magical salve bringing you to 0 hit points.*
       4. Someone forces a potion down his lips bringing you to 0 hit points.**

*If you try this option, the character has to roll system shock to
avoid choking and gagging on it. If the roll is unsuccessful the charecter has
to make a save vs. death to keep from choking to death. Either way the potion
is lost)
**Magic can only bring the character up to 0 hit points and no
further regardless of how may spells, potions, or devices are used.

        If one of the above actions occurs, bringing you to 0 hit points, you
are now stable but unconcious, effectively in a coma. You must be moderately
tended to, wounds checked at least once an hour, new bandages and so on
until you have revived. You will be uncouncious for a number of days equal to
the number of points below 0 you were taken, plus one.

        Know these rules, and know when to rush to your comrades aid!

TABLE
Maximum >= 1 hitpoints          Perfectly healthy
0 hitpoints                     Stable but Unconscious
-1 up to -CON hitpoints         Bleeding to death
-CON+1 hitpoints                DEAD -- only magic will save!

        These same rules can be applied to monsters as deemed appropriate
by the DM, of course an approximate CON score will have to be figured out.

        These rules obviously add a huge incentive to have a good CON
score. They also have the effect of forcing characters to hack away at
creatures they aren't sure if they've killed yet. In general this probably
moves the game a little further away from "high fantasy" and more towards
"low fantasy," but hey some people prefer that.

EXAMPLES
#1: Bozo the Fighter has 12hp and a 11 Constitution. Fighting an ogre, he
takes a blow for 12 hit points of damage. Bozo drops unconsious and is bleeding.
7 rounds pass while his party dispatches the Ogre. Glinda the Mage then
rushes to Bozo and tends to him (taking one round to get there). Bozo is
stabilized at -8 hp and is alive, Ginda tends to him for eight consecutive
rounds bringing him to 0 hit points. It will be 9 days(9 + -8 = 1) before he
recovers conciousness and then he will be at 1 hp. If they cast a couple cures
on him and bring his hp to 0 he will still be unconcious and will be so for
nine days. If they had been delayed for 4 rounds longer to reach him, he would
have died (-8 + -4 = -12 > 11).

#2: Glinda the Mage has 3 hp and an 18 Con. In a later battle with the ogre's
brother she is hit for 12 hit points. Glinda is now unconcious and is bleeding
at -9 hit points. 2 rounds later (she is now at -11) the ogre maliciously
bashes her again, for another 7 hp of damage. She is now at -18 hp. If she is
not healed THAT round (cure light wounds, salve, staunch the bleeding) she
will reach -19 hp next round and die.
