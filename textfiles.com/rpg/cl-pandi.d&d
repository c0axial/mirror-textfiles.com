Well this topic of knights has brought up some interesting points.  I for one
believe that I can incorporate them into my FR campaign based on the rules
listed below.  As to why I want them, I don't like the way the cavaliers were
created and wish to have an alternate class.  Just my opinion.
 
Prime requisites:  15 STR, 15 CON, 14 INT, 10 WIS, 13 DEX, 12 CHA
  This should make the order a little difficult to get into, but worthwhile.
 
Spell nature:  Mage spells up to third level.  Concert casting may occur with
               six or more knights who's levels exceed 40 combined, but with
               a minimum level of 4 needed to participate.
 
Spell awarding:  Gain spells at the same rate a mage would, but at one level
                 lower.  A knight would use cantrips at first level, and would
                 gain third level spells upon reaching sixth level.  Only one
                 spell may be learned per level.
 
Spell acquisition:  Knights learn their spells from a patron mother (mage) who
                    never adventures with the knight.  A knight must return
                    to this mage for instruction and has a base 75% chance of
                    being taught a spell, which is modified 2% per point of
                    intelligence above 15.  If the teaching fails the knight
                    does not learn that spell or any other for that level.
 
Spell retention:  Once taught a spell, the knight retains it in memory and
                  need not memorize it ever again.  Spells and attacks that
                  affect the mind do have a chance of erasing learned spells
                  for a period of up to one year, at the DM's discretion.
 
Spell casting:  A knight must concentrate for one round per level of the spell
                being cast before releasing the spell.  This time is needed
                for remembering the spell.  Cantrips may be cast immediately
                and need no additional prep time.  Only one spell per day may
                be cast by a knight, as the memory recall is muddled after the
                casting.  Armor does not affect the effects of the spell, as
                the teaching was designed to accomidate it.  No components or
                holy symbols are needed as the knights faith delivers the
                magic.
 
Spell origination:  Each knight must pay homage in some fashion to Mystra,
                    goddess of magic.  It is from her that they gain their
                    abilities.  This need not be total loyalty, only token
                    recognition of where the powers come from and gratitude.
 
Patron mothers:  Women who have been called by Mystra to teach Pandion Knights
                 the way of magic.  Mystra's reasons are her own, but could
                 possibly be related to her desire to be worshipped in what-
                 ever way she can manage.  Patron mothers live until destroyed
                 or have completed their mission, or have offended Mystra.
                 They do not age or suffer from common ailments or diseases.
                 Note:  They can be murdered by ordinary means.
