        Okay, fine with everything you've described so far with the Church
Knights, with the possible exception of alignments, and I'll get into that
when I have more time with another post (tommorrow). Anyway, I disagree
with the Knights using clerical magic. Big reason: they were the Knights of
the Elene God, and used Syric magic, so if anything, they would be using
good 'ol wizardly magic. Also, the way the magic in the books was presented
was such that there was no prayer element to it. More later...

        I like the idea of doing Edding's Church Knights ( No Bard this has
nothing to do with your world as I know it) from the Daimond Throne.  However I
can't do the characters without getting more background.  Mybe A friend of mine
has the books.  So I'll do an improvision on the class.
 
                        Church Knight (sub class of fighter)
        The Church Knight can be human or halfelf (or for you sadistic DM's a
halfdwarf).  His minumum strength must be 15, wisdom 14, and dexterity 15.
Even if he meets these requirements he is put through several test.  For only
those loyal to the church and crown are allowed in.  These test are up to the
individual DM but remember  it is an elite group.  The Church knight is then
inducted in as a squire (1st level) where he learns special techniques and is
taught clerical magic.  I know you must be saying Hold On!! See below for
restrictions.  All Knights have to be some kind of lawful nature with 75% being
good, 20% nuetral, and a rare 5% being evil.  Each Knight can use any armor but
prefer chain mail or plate.  However when just starting out they get leather
armor with church symbol and their chose of three weapons.  All knights take
pride in the church and are offened when the church is insulted.
 
                        Restrictions
 
1. The Knight must be lawful, any deviation will have him stripped of his
powers by the church forever kicked out and becomes a normal fighter.
 
2. Doesn't recieve bonus spells for high wisdom.  Instead he has only the spell
amount to a cleric 1 level below his.
 
3. He can't turn undead at anypoint or time.
 
4. Must return to a church every two months for various reasons, mostly to give
reports of things he saw, heard, or did.  Also must do anything to accomplish a
quest given to him by his church *within alignment*.
 
5. Can only keep 25% of whatever he gets, and 9 magic items (potions when added
all together only count as 1).
 
6. When he does a clerical spell it will appear he is doing a magic-user spell
and can be interupted if hit.  However the spell is not lost but can't be used
intill two rounds later.
 
                        Bonuses

1.  He starts off with 1 automatic specailization in weapon of his choice, and
three other slots.
 
2. Can ask anyone who worships his god or partheon for food and shelter and
recieve it.
 
3. Can recieve anytype of help (within reason) from his church.  Such as
healing, remove curse, ect....
 
4. Has an 65% chance to start off with a magic (+1) weapon or leather armor.
 
        Experience Point Table
Xp's                                    Level
0 to 6000                               1
6001 to 12000                           2
12001 to 24000                          3
24001 to 36000                          4
36001 to 55000                          5
55001 to 85000                          6
85000 to 134500                         7
134501 to 165000                        8
165001 to 195000                        9
 
I'm not sure of these numbers are accurate, I don't have a book here to compare
them with.
 
The Church Knight gets 1d10 for hps and +2 hps past 9th level.  Also it takes
an additional 500000 to obtian a new level past 9th.
 
        Well that is a fast on the spot character class from Eddings book.
Like I said I need to read more of them to do the characters.
 
                        Well intill later bye,
                                The short DM,
                                        Scott
