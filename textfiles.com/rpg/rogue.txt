   ROGUE:


Food and magic are your most valuable possessions. Use them
sparingly. Both get increasingly scarce as you descend further
into the dungeon. Wait until your characters are faint with
hunger before eating, and save wands and staves for the really
tough monsters.

Read scrolls at the first opportunity.

Wands and staves that shoot magic may ricochet.

Wands of polymorphing are dangerous at the upper levels. Wait
till you are in the deeper dungeons.

Aquators rust through armor and like to lurk in dark rooms and
behind closed doors. Remove your armor or fight from a distance.

Let sleeping monsters lie untill you have cleared the current
level.

Some scrolls and potions identify themselves as soon as they are
used. For those that don't, refer to the following charts:

Message						Name of Scroll

Weapon gives off a flash of white
light.						Vorpalize Weapon

Weapon glows blue				Enchant weapon
Armor glows faintly				Enchant armor
Hands glow red					Monster confusion
Hear a high pitched humming noise	        Aggravate monster
Feel as if someone is watching
you					        Remove curse
This scroll has a map on it		        Magic mapping
this scoll is an identify scroll	        Identify
Hear a cry of anguish in
distance.					Hold Monster
Hear laughter in distance.		        Scare Monster
You fall asleep.				Sleep
Scroll vanished as you read it	                Teleport
Scroll vanishes as you read it	                Create Monster
Nose tingles					Food detection
Nothing on paper to read.		        Nothing

The most requent complaint about the game is the player's high
mortality rate. We found the following method very helpful. As
soon as you complete a level, save your game. When the disk is
through accessing, remove it and write protect it. Next, restore
your game and proceed to the next level. If you are killed during
this foray, the machine will attempt to erase your character but
can't. 

If you have one identify scroll and several magic itms, you can
try saving lyour position as described and then identifying an
item, restoring the game, identifying another item, ad nausium.

A teleport-to wand teleports a monster you zap with it right next
to you, as opposed to the teleport-away wand which pops the
monster away to some other room. 

Avoid Trolls.

Zap trolls and such bad guys with sticks of metamorphose to
change them into something less nasty. There are also crossbow
bolts of "slay-troll" around.

For beginners:
Try and find leather armor as soon as possible and wear it.

Spells of maintain armor will protect metal armor types from the
aquator.

Slimes divide, so draw them into the halls.

Scrolls of light-headidness are scrolls of discernment. 

Save scrolls of night vision (it is light in here_).

Wands of cold, striking or lightening seem to have some effect
upon Trolls. But take care.

Use remove curse scrolls whenever you put a ring on without
identifing it...sometimes the rings are cursed. Read the scroll
and then remove the cursed item.

A two-handed sword will take on a Troll. Plate seems to absorb
Troll hits very well.

Since Rogue deletes your save games when you restart, you can
play from a given point over and over by doing the following:

After Rogue saves your game and puts you back in the desktop,
click on the .sav file and use see info to change the attribute
to read only. You can also copy the .sav file to another disk to
be transferred back to this disk when you want to start at the
same place.

Don't use the identify scrolls until you have several
unidentified items in stock.

You can map out dark rooms without waking up by using the
following techinque: Do into the room and move ONE square at a
time. Since most monsters are asleep, and don't wake up untill
you walk into them, you caqn take single steps and be safe. Just
move around them.
