METAMAGICIAN
 
Description:  This rare and esoteric school deals with the study of
the scientific and logical underpinnings of magic itself, as well as
the casting of spells that modify the operation of other spells.  It
is usually only open to individuals that attend a large college of
magic, although it is not unheard of for a lone metamagician to take
on apprentices far from such a school.
 
Specialist Name:  Metamagician.
 
Allowed Races:  Humans, elves, and half-elves may be metamagicians.
The requirement for a broad base of magical skills excuses the other
races from joining this school.
 
Ability Requirements:  Metamagicians must possess an intelligence that
is no less than 17 because of the extreme technical rigor of
metamagical studies.
 
Saving Throw Modifiers:  None.
 
Bonus Spells And Acquired Powers:  A metamagician can memorize an
extra spell at each spell level, providing that at least one of the
memorized spells is from the school of metamagic.
     As metamagicians rise in experience, they learn progressively
more about how to control magical forces.  Their bodies, in fact,
become little more than vessels for the magical powers inside of them.
This influence over magic manifests itself as a magic resistance of 5%
when the metamagician reaches 11th level.  With each experience level
that the metamagician attains after 11, another 5% resistance is added
on.  Thus, a 16th level metamagician has a 30% magic resistance.
 
Oppositional Schools:  The discipline of metamagic is a study of magic
in all of its forms.  Thus, there is no oppositional school to
metamagic.  However, the metamagician must take an experience point
penalty of 15% to represent the extra time and study required to learn
all of the different methods open to him.  (Note that since the
metamagician must have an intelligence of 17 or better, s/he
automatically gets an experience point bonus of 10%.  This is already
accounted for in assigning the 15% penalty; actually, the metamagician
receives a 25% penalty that is partially counteracted by high
intelligence.)

* Serten's Spell Immunity is only a metamagical spell when the AD&D
Second Edition rules are in use.
 
     As the list of metamagical spells suggests, there are not many
high level metamagicians that are not also wild mages.  This may only
be a temporary bias, or there may be some connection -- it is up to
the individual DM.
