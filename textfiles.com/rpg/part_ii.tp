         Chapter 2:

                     MAKING YOUR TOONPUNK 2020« CHARACTER

              Making a TOONPUNK or SHADOWTOON character is very 
         similar to making a normal TOON character, except for 
         Character Types, a few new rules and shticks, and the nifty, 
         ultra-cool Strife Paths! 


                                CHARACTER TYPES

              Although you can be any species you want, TOONPUNK 2020« 
         has certain types of characters that are most appropriate for 
         the game.  Of course, you can play any type of character you 
         want, even if it's inappropriate to TOONPUNK, but ask the 
         Animator first, ok?
              Most characters are Toonpunks, but you can play a member 
         of the Serious Police or a Corptoon if you want.  See the 
         descriptions of Commander Glumm (p.00) and Yugota 
         Scratchanichi (p.00).
              Any character can have built-in bionic gadgets.  Some 
         are very useful.  Some are silly.  The Animator should let 
         players suggest other gadgets -- especially silly ones.
              Everyone gets 1d x $1,000 in starting money.  After 
         that, they'll have to earn money somehow.  That shouldn't be 
         too difficult.  In Blight City, employment opportunities are 
         everywhere.  Some of them are even honest!
              One thing to remember about this world is that looking 
         cool is more important than anything else!  If you don't look 
         cool, you won't even be noticed (see LOOKING COOL, pg.00).

         TOONPUNKS
              A cartoon character with bionic gadgets and a bad 
         attitude -- that is, a sense of humor.  Some Toonpunks have 
         specialties, described below.  Others just get crazy.  Knock- 
         knock joke graffiti, seltzer ambushes, ruthless drive-by 
         Boggling -- it's all in a day's play for a Toonpunk.

         NETROAMERS
              These are the 21st-century's version of today's computer 
         hackers.  The big difference is that Netroamers actually send 
         their minds into Cyberspace.  They use cyberdecks (see p.00) 
         to adventure in the net.  Netroamers can enter any system and 
         even access other programs and files, unless they get caught 
         by a Trapgram or other protective program.  Anybody can get 
         into the Net (see p.00), but the Netroamers are the best.  
         For more information on the Net, see chapter 3: NETROAMING.

         MUSCLEBOYS
              These Toonpunks like fighting and combat as much as they 
         do jokes and laughing.  Their idea of funny is to drop an 
         anvil on someone's head -- four or five times.  Muscleboys 
         like to wear body armor, unless most of their skin has 
         already been replaced by armor.  Then they just wear a pair 
         of gym shorts (or a bikini, if they're female).  All 
         Muscleboys have at least four cyberware implants and most 
         have lots more than that.
              Muscleboys think Netroamers are nerds and Cops are 
         trouble.  Other types of characters don't much matter to 
         them, except Technogeeks.

         TECHNOGEEKS
              If you need it built, fixed, programmed, modified, or 
         invented, a Technogeek can do it.  Technogeeks are 
         programmers and engineers who have decided to work for 
         themselves instead of a Corp.  Most Technogeeks are very 
         popular guys on the Street.  Technogeeks tend to wear tie- 
         dyed labcoats over multi-colorful shirts and jeans.
              Technogeeks prefer to spread the Message of Humor by 
         inventing new weapons and gadgets for other Toonpunks to use.  
         Occasionally, they manage to boobytrap the machines at a Corp 
         factory.  For that reason, most Technogeeks are wanted by the 
         Serious Police.

         COPS
              No matter if they are city police, private eyes or 
         bounty hunters, they're all Cops to the Toonpunks.  Most Cops 
         are honest, but not all of them.  City police and bounty 
         hunters only handle crime on the Street, but private eyes 
         often go into the Corpdomes.
              Not all Cops dislike Toonpunks.  In fact, since they 
         don't handle crimes against the Megacorps, the city police 
         only chase Toonpunks who commit Streetcrimes.  The Serious 
         Police don't like this, but the Cops don't care.  A few Cops 
         are actually Toonpunk spies!
              Some Cops specialize in handling Netcrime, and are 
         Netroamers themselves.
              Cops can have just about any weapon or vehicle they 
         want.  City police don't have to pay for these things, but 
         private eyes and bounty hunters do.  Many Cops and almost all 
         private eyes and bounty hunters have some cyberware implants.


                                 STRIFE PATHS

              To see what type of interesting, dramatic, stupid 
         personal problems your character has, start by rolling a die.  
         Go to the starting point with the same number.  From there, 
         you just keep rolling the die until you get to an END.  You 
         can go through the Strife Paths as many times as you want.

                                   NEW RULES

         NEW SHTICKS
              All the old shticks from TOON could be used in TOONPUNK, 
         either as is or disguised as an implant.  Also, any shticks 
         from TOONIVERSAL TOUR GUIDE can be used with the Animator's 
         permission.  Here are a few of the most helpful ones:

         * CATFALL (4 POINTS)
              Catfall allows you to fall from a GREAT height
         and land on your feet, unscathed.  This is, of course, if you
         make your Shtick roll.  Otherwise, you take damage as normal 
         from the fall.

         * KNOW OBSCURE FACTS (3 POINTS)
              You know all sorts of useless facts, making you great at
         game shows!  When you make your Shtick roll, the Animator 
         will let you know one relevant fact, usually little known and 
         probably helpful.  However, if you fail, he will tell you 
         something either not imporant or dangerously _wrong_.  But 
         you won't know that, because the Animator makes the roll.

         * MAXIMUM BOGGLE (5 POINTS)
              A Maximum Boggle is just like a regular Boggle, but if 
         you manage to Maximum Boggle someone, he is Boggled for 3 
         turns instead of 1!  Furthermore, he has to roll three times 
         on the Boggle table.  If you Maximum Boggle another player, 
         you get double points!

         * SENSE OF DIRECTION (2 POINTS)
              With this Shtick, you can always find out what direction 
         anything is from where you are standing.  Characters using 
         this Shtick will stretch out one arm, point with their index 
         finger and spin around like crazy for one turn.  When they 
         stop, they'll be pointing in the direction of whatever they 
         wanted to locate, if they make their Shtick roll.  If they 
         fail, they'll be going in either a random direction or the 
         opposite direction (but they won't know it -- the Animator 
         makes the roll).
              Sense of Direction works in cyberspace.

         * WEIRD SCIENCE (5 POINTS)
              With this Shtick, you can invent strange new weapons and 
         machines using whatever you find lying around, or make new 
         programs from scratch.  That doesn't mean they'll work the 
         way you expect.  The Animator determines that.  Animators 
         have all the fun, don't they?

         SKILL POINTS
              TOONPUNK characters get 40 Skill Points to make their 
         characters with, instead of the standard 30.

         MAPS AND RANGES
              This is a new rule.  While it's not necessary, Animators 
         might want to use it to add a visual elememt to the game.
              You'll need something to represent each character, 
         vehicle, building, etc.  Metal or cardboard miniatures will 
         do fine for characters.  You can just draw buildings or other 
         big stuff.  If you don't have miniatures, use toy figures, 
         blocks, dice, coins, or anything else that's handy.
              A plastic Battlemat (available at most game stores) or a 
         large sheet of paper marked with small squares will make 
         judging movement and distance much easier.  Use one square 
         (one inch, or whatever) to represent 10 feet.  If you don't 
         have a map sheet, you can use a ruler or just guess.  After 
         all, this is still TOON.
              Certain things, like weapons and spells, have Ranges.  
         This is the farthest distance at which they will have an 
         effect.

         SPEED
              This is the other half of the Range rule.  Everything 
         that moves has a Speed rating.  This tells how many squares 
         on the map it can move each turn.  All characters and other 
         living things have a Speed equal to their Zip plus 1.  
         Therefore, a character with a Zip of 6 will have a Speed of 7 
         and can move 70 feet a turn -- or 7 squares on the map.  
         Vehicles have Speeds, too.
              Falling objects always fall at 50 feet per turn, unless 
         something special affects them (like the Animator's whim).  
         Characters may or may not be able to step out of the way to 
         avoid getting konked.
              You may be able to find Stuff that can increase or 
         decrease your Speed.  The Animator may also come up with 
         Speed-changing deviices or situations, because Animators like 
         to mess around with things like Speed.

         STUFF
              In this book, Stuff means possessions.  A character can 
         still specify up to eight items in his Back Pockets, and can 
         pick up more (any number of items!) along the way.  Remember 
         that four items must be normal, but then again, what is 
         normal in TOONPUNK may not be normal for TOON.  Ask that wise 
         being, the Animator, for advice.

         NEW SKILL - LOOK COOL (CHUTZPAH)
              In Blight City, nothing is more important than looking 
         cool.  If you look cool, you are cool.  If you look cool 
         enough, even the cops will leave you alone.  Other Toonpunks 
         will want to be your pal, help you do things and will think 
         that you are the coolest person since Elvis.  Of course, if 
         someone with a higher Look Cool score than you comes along, 
         you'll just be another schmo.
              Whenever a fight is about to happen, either side can 
         call for a Cool Off instead.  The enemies (or leaders of each 
         side) look each other over and make cool remarks.  The 
         players should act out the poses and attitudes that their 
         characters are striking during the contest.
              Then each player makes a Look Cool roll.  Whoever made 
         it by most, wins.  (The Animator can give one side a bonus 
         for really cool roleplaying.)
              After you know who's coolest, you can still fight if you 
         want to.  But if one side Cooled Out the other by three or 
         more points, the loser is Boggled and there's no fight.  
         Punks who are cool enough can Boggle the cops and walk away.  
         (Of course, cops who are cool enough can Boggle the punks 
         into surrendering.)

         IMPLANTS
              Cyberware implants are pretty expensive, and the cost 
         varies based on the quality.  A licensed cybersurgeon in a 
         sterile operating room costs much more than a Toonpunk 
         cyberdoc in a fairly clean apartment.  So does cyberware made 
         in a factory instead of someone's basement or garage.  All 
         cyberware has a chance of failing or malfunctioning.  
         Animators should keep this die roll secret and if a 
         malfunction occurs, roll on the Technogeek Mistake Table (see 
         p. 00).
              Implants are basically cybernetic shticks that cost no 
         character points.  However, they can never be improved, and 
         the Shtick roll (if there is one) will always be a 5.
              The _Net Profits Catalog_ offers many implants, some 
         with free installation and a one-year warranty (see p. 00).
