Vampire Hunter (Fighter)
By Aaron Brown
(C) 1989
Revision Date (C) 1990

A Vampire Hunter is a sub class of Fighters that are totally
and fully devoted to the destruction of all vampires and
lycanthropes.  They see only the truly alive and truly dead
should remain, and if they, themselves, at some point and
time become vampires, they will immediately put a stake of
holly through their heart.

Vampire Hunters must be human, and have a 13 STR., a 14 WIS.,
a 16 CON., and a 10 CHR.  The major attributes being STR, and CON,
but don't get me wrong, WIS is almost, if not more, important
as the other abilities.

A Vampire Hunter immediately learns all of the racial
languages (Elf, Gnome, etc.) so that they can speak to all
vampires.  They must be of Lawful or Chaotic alignment, as a
neutral person would not attack something for no reason, but
they can be good, evil, or neutral.  They do have some
Clerical abilities also, like turning the undead as a
identical level cleric (and only TURNING, no charming them to
help you), and using spells of half the level of the Vampire Hunter
starting at 2nd, i.e. a 2nd level Vampire Hunter casts as a 1st level
cleric, 4th as a 2nd, etc. etc.  Vampire Hunters also have a 25%
chance to hear otherwise undetectable noises of the undead
(65% to hear normal noises as the thieves Hear Noises), a 75%
chance to Move Silently, and a 70% chance to Hide in Shadows,
as the Thieving ability.  If the d% roll on Move Silently is
successful, then there is a 15% chance for undead quality
silence.  These abilities are because of countless hours of
studying vampires and the undead, and are also only 1st level
percents, so as levels go up, so do the abilities.

Vampire Hunters are given, by their family a Holy Mallet and 10 stakes
from the best Holly Trees.  These tools and weapons will help
them destroy almost any vampire of any level.  A Vampire Hunter can use
any clerical weapons plus a Short Sword.  A Vampire Hunter gets a +1
bonus to there "to hit" roll when hitting undead creatures, this goes up
by +1 every 2 levels the Vampire Hunter advances.  When fighting vampires
they get a +2 bonus, and this goes up by +1 every 2 levels also.

The Vampire Hunter will attack any Lycanthrope on sight, irregardless
of alignment, and will suffer no penalty because of that.
This, of course, is because their sole purpose in life is to
destroy all Vampires on the planet.  Also, as a Vampire Hunter goes up
in level, s/he gains special abilities.

Restrictions:
   If the PC Vampire Hunter does not kill an undead creature in 14 days
s/he will do beserk and kill everything on first sight (except Party
members) until s/he destroys 2 undead creatures.  (This has no effect on
alignment, due to noncontrol of the PC's actions).

Subject: Ravenloft class

Here's a new Thief Kit for Ravenloft PC's.  I know it'd double spaced.
I'm working on getting that fixed....
Vampire Hunter
  Description: Vampire Hunters are individuals dedicated to the
destruction of undead, particularly vampires.  They do not use
their thieving abilities to profit themselves, but as tools to
aid in their quest to destroy undead.  Because of this, they must
have a dexterity of 12.  Their most dangerous weapon is their
knowledge and cunning; vampire hunters must have an intelligence
of 12 and a wisdom of 15.
  Role: Vampire Hunters are native to the Ravenloft setting.
There they are defenders of the common people, individuals with
the tools and courage to face what the average person cannot.  An
example from popular fiction is Dr. Van Helsing.  They are
usually of a good alignment, but may be neutral.  They are rarely
chaotic.
  Secondary Skill: Any.
  Weapon Proficiencies: Because of their rather specialized
nature, Vampire Hunters may only become proficient in the
following weapons: shortbow, club, dagger, knife, lasso, mace,
quarterstaff, rapier, saber, scimitar, scythe, sickle, sling,
spear, and warhammer.  They may use any one-handed firearm.  They
may also use a holy symbol in combat (see special benefits).
  Nonweapon Proficiencies: Required: Languages, ancient,
Read/Write, Religion.  Recommended: Animal Handling, Ancient
History, Disguise, Local History, Alertness, Astrology,
Herbalism, Fortune Telling.  Vampire Hunters may chooses
nonweapon proficiencies from the Priest area without extra cost.
  Skill Progression: Vampire Hunters suffer a -10% penalty to
pick pockets and climb walls, but receive a +5% bonus to hide in
shadows and hear noise and a +10% bonus to read languages.
Because of their specialized nature and other abilities, vampire
hunters begin with only 40 points to distribute among their
abilities and gain 20 points every time they gain a level.
  Special Benefits: Vampire Hunters gain three special abilities.
Starting at second level, they may turn undead as a cleric one
half their actual level.  They may fight with a weapon in one
hand and a holy symbol in the other with no penalty.  When using
a holy symbol, such as a cross, in combat, any successful hit
with the holy symbol against an undead creature will do 1d6
damage plus an extra point of damage for every level of the
Vampire Hunter.  The holy symbol may be made out of any material.
Vampire Hunters also gain a +2 bonus to resisting Horror and
Fear.
 
  Special Hindrances: Vampire Hunters are hated by undead, and in
combat are likely to be sought out by undead above all other
enemies.  (Note that this occurs only if the undead are
intelligent and are aware of the Vampire Hunter's true nature).
Vampire Hunters may not keep more treasure than they can carry,
donating the rest to a good institution.
  Races: Humans are the best suited to this kit, but elves, half-
elves, and dwarves may also become Vampire Hunters.  This
profession is too grim for most halflings and gnomes.
Some of the proficiencies are from the Complete Thieves Handbook, but
the names are pretty self-explanatory....
