Clan Jade Falcon Battlemech - Hellfire
By Nightblade [71670,3446]

The Hellfire was designed with close combat in mind.  Lacking the long range
firepower of most clan assault mechs, the Hellfire made up for it with twin
Ultra AC/20s, an ER Small Laser, and a SRM-6.  This is enough firepower to
defeat any Inner Sphere bettlemech, but the Khan demanded perfection.  An LRM-5
was added to satisfy the long range requirements.  Another complaint was the
weakness in the rear armor on most clan mechs.  The Hellfire relocated it's
communication equipment and moved a very large amount of it's armor to the
rear.  Although it is unlikely to match up to the fame of such assault mechs
as the Executioner and Dire Wolf, the Hellfire is a force to be reckoned with.
