Clan Ghost Bear "Racemech" - Cheetah Experimental Racemech
By Nightblade [71670,3446]

As fastest mech in the known universe, the four-legged Cheetah has been clocked
going at over 409.6 kph!  Basically a fusion engine with legs, the Cheetah was
never considered for military use until the Inner Sphere invasion.  While it
would not survive very long against a skilled Clan mechwarrior, the Cheetah was
found to be quite useful as a scout mech when used against shorter ranged Inner
Sphere weapons.  Being assigned to pilot a Cheetah is often used as a form of
punishment for Clan warriors.  Most trueborns would sooner shoot themselves
than be assigned the cowardly job of running past the enemy and taking pictures
in a Cheetah.  Freeborns usually end up piloting the Cheetah, although it is
unlikely they will get much glory from piloting this mech.
