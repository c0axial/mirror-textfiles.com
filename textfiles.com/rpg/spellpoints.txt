Description for SpellPnt.Zip:

This is a spellpoint system for AD&D. It is mostly the work of Mark Morgan,
but has been modified somewhat by Matt Miller.  This version is NOT a text
file: it is a very nice Ami Pro document. If you don't have Ami Pro, don't
despair: PageMaker should be able to import this with relative ease.  (But 
a slight warning:   I'm not sure how well it will import the table and
graphical data...)  If you don't have PageMaker either, or anything else 
that can read .SAM files, go ahead and despair.

Oh, and it uses the Optima TrueType font, but if you don't have that, don't
worry, any sans-serif font will do.


                            Spell Point System

Please send mail to the above address as to how you like the system, possible
   changes, and any other things you wish to say.

        The normal spell system causes an inbalance in power for the mage 
class.  At lower levels, they are extremely weak, able to cast only 1 or 2 
spells before they become useless.  Conversely, at higher levels, they are 
much more powerful than other classes.  This system helps to balance out the
mage class at all levels of power, without major modifications having to be
made to the rest of the AD&D game system.
        I can hear the arguments from the players now--"But what's the point
of using this new system if I can't have all the benefits I used to?"  
Instead of limitting mages, and other spell-casting characters, this system
gives them increased flexibility.  Spells do not need to be memorised in
order to be cast--only the required number of spell points are needed for
the spell to take effect.  Enough of a preamble; on to the good stuff...

        Pure Normal:  General priests and mages
        Pure Spec:  Specialist mages and priests(including druids)
        Hybrid:  Classes other than mages or priests who gain spells.

        *  Note:  Hybrid spell caster levels are considered from the first
                  level that they gain spells.  This is also their effective
                  casting level.  For example--as Bard's gain spells at
                  character level 2.  A 2nd level bard would have 1 spell
                  point, and have an effective casting level of 1.

Spell Point Multipliers:
      With the normal AD&D spell system, there are few advantages to a mage
    having a high Intelligence.  They do not gain additional spells as does
    a cleric with a high Wisdom.  Under this system, a bonus or penalty to
    the number of spell points is given to a pure spell user who has a
    high INT or WIS.  The same bonus or penalty is given for a pure spell
    user who has a high CON.  This represents an ability to sustain a
    greater amount of magical or holy energies in the spellcasters body
    in a given day.
      Hybrid spell users do not gain any bonuses to the number of spell 
    points they recieve, but may, if their abilities are low enough, recieve
    a penalty as do pure spell users.

                        Ability          Multiplier
                         Score
                        ===========================
                           8                 .70   
                           9                 .80
                          10                 .85
                          11                 .90
                          12                 .95
                          13                1.00
                          14                1.05
                          15                1.10
                          16                1.15
                          17                1.20
                          18                1.25
                          19                1.30

    A couple of examples on how this works may be in order.  
       Example 1:  Thom, a 6th level bard(hybrid user--level 5) has a 16
          INT and 10 CON.  If he was a pure spell user, his multiplier for
          his INT would be 1.15, but as a hybrid user, he does not gain
          this bonus.  His CON of 10, however, results in a 0.85 multiplier
          to his base Spell Points.  The number of spell points he would 
          normally have per day is:  
                11(base) x 0.85(CON multiplier) = 9.35 which would be
                                                  rounded down to 9.
       Example 2:  Durik, a 9th level priest of Hades(pure specialist) has
          a WIS of 17(multiplier 1.20) and a CON of 16(multiplier 1.16).
          His total Spell Points normally usable would be:
                75(base) x 1.20(WIS) x 1.15(CON) = 103.50 which would be
                                                  rounded up to 104.

Spell Cost:
      Each spell costs it's level squared in spell points to cast.  For
    example, a 5th level spell would cost 25 points, and a 2nd level spell   
    would cast 4 points.

Spells Castable:
      The levels of spells which could be cast by a character would not
    change under this system.  For example, a mage would have to be 9th
    level before he could cast a 5th level spell.  This has nothing to do
    with the number of Spell Points the character has, but the level of
    magical mastery achieved by the caster.  There is no limit other than
    the number of Spell Points as to how the spells are to be divided.
    Continuing the examples from above:
         Thom, being a 6th level bard can cast only 1st and 2nd level spells.
       He could use his 9 spell points in any combination of 1st and 2nd 
       level spells.  He could cast 1 1st level(1 SP) and 2 2nd level(2x4 SP)
       or 9 first level spells.
         Durik, a 9th level priest with 104 spell points could cast spells
       of up to 5th level which do not exceed 104 SP.  This could be used
       to cast 4 5th level spells(100 SP) and 2 2nd level spells(4 SP), or
       any other combination which would result in a maximum of 104 SP.

Regaining Spell Points:
      Spell Points are regained by sleep.  The number of points gained per 
    hour of restful sleep depends on the character's level, and the type of
    spellcaster.  A hybrid spell user regains SP at the rate of level x 
    1/2 SP per hour of sleep.  Pure Normal spellcasters regain level x SP 
    per hour of restful sleep, while Specialists gain level x 1.5 SP per 
    hour.

Being Struck During Combat:
      If the caster sustains damage during the casting of a spell, the spell
    does not go off, and the caster loses the full amount of SP, unless he
    has the Concentration proficiency described below.

    Concentration non-weapon proficiency
    Priest:  1 slot     wisdom-3
    Mage:    1 slot     intelligence-3

      This proficiency gives the spellcaster a proficiency check to avoid
    losing the full number of Spell Points if struck during combat.  It 
    represents the ability to rein in the spell without full loss of SP.  
    On a successful ability check, only 1/2 of the normal spell points
    (rounded up) are lost when struck.  If the check is failed, the full
    amount is lost.



OPTIONAL RULES:

Overextending Normal SP Limits:
      Using this rule, it is possilble to use more than the normal amount
    of spell points in a given day, though it gravely affects the caster's
    health.  When a spell is cast for which the caster does not have enough
    SP, the difference is SP comes directly from the caster's HP.  Note that
    this HP lose is PERMANENT, and cannot be reversed by any means short of
    a full Wish.  Even if a Wish is used, only 2d10 of the lost HP can be
    recovered.  This obviously, is only to be undertaken when it is a life-
    or-death situation, else the spellcaster would soon find himself with
    almost no hit points.

Cas
    No spell, regardless of the number of components which it normally has,
    can be reduced to zero components.  There must always be at least one
    component, though it is the caster's choice of what that component will
    be.  For example, suppose Merlin the wizard is caught within a Silence
    spell which he wishes to dispel.  As Dispel Magic is a 3rd level spell,
    it would normally cost 9 SP to cast the spell.  Since Merlin wishes to
    cast it without the Verbal component, the spell cost is doubled to 18 SP.
    It would not be possible for Merlin to cast the spell without somatic
    components as well, as this would reduce the number of components to
    zero.

Holy Days:
      Most dieties are assumed to have days at which their power is greater
    than other days.  These days are what mortals celebrate as holy days
    for their particular gods.  Upon these days, specialty priests and 
    paladins gain a bonus to the number of Spell Points which they recieve.  
    For specialty priests, this bonus is 2 times the priests level, while for
    paladins, it is their effective level as a spellcaster.  These points
    will remain with the spellcaster until the number of Spell Points drops
    below the normal maximum number of Spell Points.  The priest or paladin
    must make a sacrifice of the type desired by the diety to gain this 
    bonus.

Spell Point Resovoirs:
      Spell Point resovoirs are a simple magic item which can be created by
    all pure spell users regardless of level, provided they have enough spell
    points to charge the item.  Spell Point resovoirs allow a certain number
    of SP to be stored in them, to be later tapped and used by the spell
    user.
      The process of charging an item involves two steps.  The item must
    first be purified by casting a Purify Resovoir spell(see below) on it.
    If the item is not destroyed in the casting, it is then open to recieve
    Spell Points from the spellcaster.  To deposit Spell Points, it costs 
    ten times the number of SP to be imbued in the item.  For example, to
    store 5 SP into a crystal, 50 SP would have to be expended.  All of the
    spell points which are to be put into an item must be done during one
    sitting.  It is not possible to put 5 spell points into an item one day,
    and another 5 spell points into the item the day after.
      To tap the resovoir, the spellcaster need only have the item in contact
    with his skin, and think of the item while casting the spell.  The spell
    points will then come from the item before coming from the caster's
    personal stock.  Once all the spell points in a resovoir are expended,
    the item completely disintegrates.
      Note that spell resovoirs are attuned to the person who made them, and
    can only be used by them.  It is NOT possible for a spellcaster to have
    more than one resovoir in existance at any time.  The previous resovoir
    must be completely expended before a new one can be created.

    Purify Resovoir     Level 2
    
    Mage School: Alteration
    Priest Sphere: Creation
    Range: Touch
    Components: V, S, M
    Duration: Permanent until expended
    Casting Time: 1 hour + 1 turn / spell point imbued
    Area of Effect: 1 item
    Saving Throw: n/a

      By means of this spell, the mage or pries is able to ready an item for
    use as a spell resovoir.  The ritual is quite involved, and any 
    disturbance of the caster results in the failure of the spell.  Even if
    there are no interruptions in the ritual, there is still only a 10%
    chance per level of the spell actually working.  Should the spell
    fail, the item is instantly converted to pure energy, which causes
    1 point of damage per each spell point which could be stored to all
    within 10 feet of the item.  There is no save for this. 
      Once the item has been purified, there is no chance of the resovoir
    exploding, and the spellcaster can begin to charge the item.  Charging
    requires 1 hour and 10 SP for each SP which is to be imbued within the
    resovoir.  If the charging is interrupted for any reason, charging
    cannot be resumed at a later period.  
      The possible items which can become resovoirs are as follows:

                Item                  Maximum SP
              ==================================
              quartz crystal(10gp)         2
              ornamental stone(100gp)      5
              gemstone(1000gp)            15
              gold ring(50gp)              5
              gold amulet(200gp)          10
              ivory wand(50gp)             5
              crystal wand(1000gp)        20

      The material component of this spell is the item to be charged, which
    obviously is not expended.
