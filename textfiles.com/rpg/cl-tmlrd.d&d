  Here's some of my own thoughts on the Time Lord elite of the race
of Temporals.  A bit of history  and then the kits.

  Here Presented are the Time Lords of AD+D:

   Genesis Part One

Description:  This is not one kit but several whose origins lie in
the efforts of transplanted humans to adapt and master the Plane of
Time.  Complete mastery eluded them as Time masters both mortal and
immortal but these efforts did eventually create a race which could
at least hold it's own in the environment.  The emerging Temporals
sound found themselves isolated from the Prime Material world from
whence they came as all efforts of planar travel ended fatally for
the would-be voyagers.  The surviving sages came to realise that
Temporal bodies had become adapted to the randomness of time and
that the pressure of a one-way TimeStream caused sudden shock,
dubbed the Time Bend.  The few survivors however developed amazing
powers of body and mind that even magic could not explain. The
answer came with the attempted invasion of th illithid, those
known as the Mind Flayers.  Not adapted to the Time Plane, the
invaders succombbed after bloody losses to both sides.  From
lore of the invaders and examination, the stories became a formal
art of psionics the powers of the mind.  The first subject of the
new science was it's creator, the mage Rathlon the first of what
would be eventually known as the Time Lords.  His traumatic
experience led to the new disciplines and the first of the Time
Carriages.  Such was the stage set for the great triumphs and
the greatest tragedies.

  The prototype kits follow in next message.

Time Lord

Description:  The elite class of Temporal society those who have mastered
the vagaries of the Plane of Time by will and intuition.  Minimum require-
ments are a 11 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Constitution and a 16 in at
least one of the above 3 attributes.  Also, most are of at least non-chaotic
alignments.  Chaotic characters seldom have the self-control neccesary for
the mastery required.  Also due to the alien enviroment of the Plane of
time, Rangers may not be members, nor are there Time Lord Paladins.  Fighter
members of this kit are generally known as Time Masters, Thieves as Time
Scouts, Wizards as ChronoMages, However in formal language, all refer and
are referred to collectively as Time Lords including the clerics which are
the fewest among them.  Of special mention are the Chronoscist, the
Psionicist who hold the fullest mastery of time and oversee the training of
Temporal Initiates who take the test of Time Mastery and the construction of
Time Carriages.
Role:  In campaigns mostly centered on the Prime Material plane, Time Lords
are generally NPC's who associate with the party for reasons most kept to
themselves.  In a more ranging series of adventures, they are the avenue of
travel to frontiers not even known to the hardiest spelljammer.
Secondary Skills: Required, none.  Recommended,  Scribe.
Weapon Proficiencies: No special requirements
Non-Weapon Proficiencies: Bonus Ancient History, Read/Write Recommended,
Ancient Languages, Navigation, Astrology, (events of great import are
often written "in the stars"), Ancient Languages. Slot costs are as for
main class. i.e. Fighters  pay 3 slots for Astrology.
Equipment:  up to DM's option, Time Lords may be sent by the Council
Rces: Only Temporals may be members of these rather exclusive Academies.
