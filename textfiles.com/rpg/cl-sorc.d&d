Subject: SORCEROR character class (NOT sorcerER!)

This class has been successfully play tested in an email environment ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SORCEROR
 
 
     Sorcerors are the great seekers of knowledge;  their goal  in  life  is  to
understand and master the mysteries of the world in which they reside.  They are
very  intelligent;   they  must have an INTELLIGENCE of at least 18, and minimum
WISDOM of 14.  In addition, they also require a good perception of at least  12.
A  Sorceror  who  has both WISDOM of 18+ and PERCEPTION 15+ gains the benefit of
adding 10% to all experience points earned.  (PERCEPTION is rolled on 3d6 only.)
Only humans, elves and half-elves may be sorcerors.
 
     Sorcerors originally started out in life as  sages  of  great  distinction.
Such was their pursuit of knowledge, they drew the attention of Thoth, the great
God  Of  Knowledge  (see  "Legends  & Lore").  Impressed by their dedication, he
bestowed upon them his own knowledge of spells and languages.  Hence,  sorcerors
are  able to cast any spell and know all languages, within the confines of their
experience level.
 
SPELL USE
 
 
     As stated above, all spells are employable  by  Sorcerors.   Spell  casting
does,  however,  require  great  concentration  and mental effort;  only through
experience does the Sorceror master the ability and expend only the  minimum  of
effort.   Such  mental  strain  drains  energy,  causing the character to become
weaker;  only uninterupted rest may the sorceror  recover.   Hence,  hit  points
lost  through  spell  casting  may  not  be  replenished  in the same fashion as
"physical" damage (spells such as "Cure Light Wounds"  only  affect  hit  points
lost through physical effort, such as due to combat).
 
eg. A first level sorceror with 24 hit points  casts 2 spells in the course of
    the day  (using 20 hit points),  and is struck in a battle for another  3.
    A fellow Cleric casts "Cure Light Wounds" for 5 hit points.  However, only
    the physical points lost may regained in this way, hence 3 points only are
    restored.
 
Hit points lost due to spell casting are regained at  a  rate  of  1hp/level  of
experience  per  hour  of  uninterupted  rest.  Any disturbance during this time
could cause the loss of that hour's rest.
 
 
         .---------------------------------------------------.
         | Base Level % chance of losing hour's rest :   90% |
         | Modified for each level of experience     :   -5% |
         |                                                   |
         | To a minimum % of                         :   40% |
         `---------------------------------------------------'
 
Not all spells require the same concentration.  The  environment  in  which  the
sorceror  undertook  study has effect on which spells are easier to cast.  There
are four degrees of difficulty:
 
  .------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Spell-Type                 Magic User    Illusionist   Cleric    Druid |
  |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Natural Environment            +2            +5          +1         0  |
  | Religious Environment          +1            +4           0        +2  |
  | Urban Environment               0            +2          +3        +5  |
  `------------------------------------------------------------------------'
 
Hence, a 5th level Sorceror from an Urban Environment can cast a 2nd level Magic
User Spell using a total of 12 hit points, but a 2nd  level  Druid  spell  would
take 17 hit points.
 
 
COMBAT
 
 
     Due to the degree of  dedication  of  their  disciplines,  Sorcerors  abhor
physical  combat.  Hence, initially they have no weapon proficiencies or indeed,
may not employ weapons of any sort.  On achieving 6th level, however,  sorcerors
may then employ a staff, of which they become proficient at 7th level.  This may
only  be used for defensive purposes (attacked first).  Sorcerors will prefer to
study battle tactics, but will uae magic as they see fit to aid their associates
in battle.
 
 
     Neither armour or shields may be employed by Sorcerors.  Instead, as a gift
for their faithful study, a special robe has been provided.  This has been woven
from the finest, strongest fibres, and has an armour class of 5.  In  appearance
it  has a grey colouring, with faint streaks of silver that occasionally glitter
when in bright light.  It has been endowered with certain magical properties :
 
a) the robe offers the same abilities as the Cloak Of Elvenkind.
b) the armour class of the robe may be increased magically  by use of a special
   spell known only to Sorcerors  - "The Strength Of The Shield" -  which, when
   cast upon a magical shield (+1 or more) will draw the magical bonus from the
   shield and impregnate it into the robe itself.
 
              .------------------------------------------------.
              | Base Chance Of Spell Success               25% |
              | Modified by level of caster above 5th      +5% |
              `------------------------------------------------'
   ie. An 8th level Sorceror has a 40% chance of transferring the bonus.
   Failure to transfer loses the property, and the shield becomes normal.
 
These magical bonuses can be lost as with any other magical item.   If  this  is
the case, the robe reverts back to its initial armour class of 5.
 
 
NOTES ON SPECIAL ABILITIES
 
LANGUAGES:
     Due to the special favour that  they  hold,  Sorcerors  have  the  inherent
ability  to comprehend languages;  they can make out what has been written down,
and follow the course of a converstation.  To fully understand  a  language,  to
speak,  read  and  write  fluently,  the  Sorceror may request "help" from Thoth
himself.  If granted, this knowledge is bestowed onto the Sorceror;  however, it
is not permanent and is lost after resting.  To use it again, the Sorceror  must
request help once more.
 
HELP:
    The knowledge of Thoth is very extensive, and it  is  often  necessary  for
Sorcerors  to draw upon this;  the willingness of their lord to impart requested
information is given in the Experience Level Table.  Help may be requested about
anything - the DM decides what is applicable.  Such things that can be requested
include Language understanding (above), and the determination of the effects  of
MAGIC ITEMS.
 
ALIGNMENT:
     The majority  of  Sorcerors  are  of  Neutral  alignment;   thus  they  are
untainted  by  ideals  and  are  able  to operate in any environment and collect
knowledge from virtually all aspects  of  life.   Occasionally,  however,  Thoth
choses  sages of other alignments, seeing them as keys to obtaining knowledge on
other darker, lighter, lawful or unlawful aspects of life.   These  sages  would
"see"  things that those of the neutral alignment cannot comprehend.  Hence, the
greater knowledge of life may be left in the  hands  of  his  "eyes  and  ears",
leaving Thoth to pursue other, more "demanding" projects.
 
ALIGNMENT CHANGE:
     Failure to maintain alignment, or the dereliction of duty may  cause  Thoth
to  become  displeased  and  withdraw his guidance (determined by the DM).  This
results in a reversion to the degree class in which the Sorceror was  proficient
(from  the  Environment  Modifier  Table).   Such  action  causes  two levels of
experience to be lost,  along  with  half  of  total  hit  points  gained.   The
comprehension  of  languages  remains,  and  the  character  may now use weapons
applicable to his/her class - however, no weapon proficiencies may be gained.
 
SPELLS SPANNING TWO CLASSES:
     Where spells are duplicated in two classes,  the  class  with  the  MINIMUM
spell  level  is  used.   Hence,  "Phantasmal  Force"  is  taken to be 1st level
Illusionist, NOT 3rd level Magic User.

HENCHMEN:
     Sorcerors are solitary in nature;  though they accompany parties  in  order
to  acquire  knowledge,  and can indeed become a trusted friend, sorcerors NEVER
have followers or henchmen.  No level of commitment is  therefore  formed,  thus
allowing Sorcerors to come and go as they please.

Okay,  I've had a couple requests for details about the sorcerer class,
so here goes.  Much of what is here is original,  some I've revamped for
compatibility with more general campaign specifics.
 
Character Class
===============
Sorcerer
 
Description.
One in a family of magic-users,   the Sorcerer class is perhaps the most
self-reliant of all the mage types.   They utilize the power of their
will and combine it with words of direction to give shape to their
visions.   In essence,  their power springs directly from within.  They
do not merely channel existing energy from some source as do normal
mages;  they generate it within themselves and unleash it with speech.
 
Restrictions
============
A Sorcerer must always be of the Free Races.  This group of races
includes humans and animals.   As no normal animal has the gift of true
speech as we understand,  Sorcerers must always be human.  This
restriction to Free Races came from the creation of the Universe.  Three
great Races were created : The Fair Races,  the Free Races,  and the
Dark Races.   THe Fair and Dark Races were inherently good and evil,
respectively.  Because sorcery deals with balance,  as we shall see,
the bearer must not be born predisposed toward any ethos.  Humans,  as a
rule (in my world anyway),  are always born neutral.
A sorcerer can be of any alignment,  for Humans can choose their path
more freely than other races.  A sorcerer's choice of alignment does not
violate his belief in the balance.
A sorcerer can not wear any armor,  nor utilize any type of magical
defense.  Bracers,  rings,  cloaks,  and potions are all useless for
aiding his defensive ability.  THe sorcerer can carry and use only one
weapon.  It can be any one-handed weapon,  and may be magical.  (Oh,
sorry,  a Defender won't work either!)
 
Requirements
============
A Sorcerer must have:
Int: 16
Con: 16
ALSO
The Sorcerer's CON can never drop below 12.  If it does,  his body is
unable to contain the forces created within,  and he will be destroyed
at the first use of Sorcery.  Magical means of raising it are
permissible.
 
Sorcery
=======
Okay,  here's the sticky part.  THere are many ways to assign values for
what a sorcerer can do.  The DM can arbitrarily decide, for one.
However,  here's my way,  which allows clever characters to make good
use of their points.
Sorcery Points - (Int*2) + Wis + (Level*2)
 
First,  assume a sorcerer has say, four main manipulations :
trunsmutation,  obliteration,  creation,  and  probing.
Next,  imagine types of creatures these powers could be done upon : non-
or semi-intelligent animals,  normal creature,  magical creaures or
creations,  divine or ultra powerful beings.
OR, materials upon which these powers can be used : fire,  water,  wind,
earth,  rock,   metal,  flesh...
Now assign each a multiplier,  representing a dgree of difficulty.
SO now we have something like a chart.
 
Power -  Mult   Creature - Mult   Material - Mult
=============   ===============   ===============
Probe 1   Animals   1 Wood/Wind   1
Create2   Normal2 Water/Fire  2
Transmute 5   Magical   5 Steel/Rock  3
Destruct  5   Divine10 ** Magical 5
 
Now,  a more complete chart is necessary for a good setup,  but
this crude one will do for our purposes.   Say our sorcerer,  named
Belicose (har, har!)  wants to do something :  he wants to create a normal
hunting dog to accompany the party, the DM looks at  the chart and
says:
"Two for creation times one for normal animal equals two points spent."
And the dog is there!
 
Moving on,  Belicose's party encounters a dense wood.  They hear
a noise,  and they know something lurks within.   Belicose probes,  and
the DM decides a dragon awaits the party.   He determines : 1 for probe,
times 5 for magical creature,  plus one for wood's interference,
equals 6.
Later,  Belicose attempts to turn an enemies sword into wood.  The DM
says it will be 5 for transmute,  times 2 (3 steel minus 1 wood),  plus
3 due to sword's  +3.  13 points.  Unfortuneatly,  the sword saves
versus magic,   and Belicose fails.
And so on...
THe important thing is,  make your charts as comprehensive as possible.
The one here is by no means exhaustive.  My own is lost,  alas!  I had
over 100 specific actions scored for,  and all were used often.  The
idea here is new,  and more adaptable.
 
Other sorcery stuff
===================
I said before a sorcerer couldn't wear armor or use magic to help.  He
can do some thing just as good, though.  HE can choose to spend a
certain number of points,  and subtract the total from his AC.  THis
lasts for an hour.  HE does not have to concentrate,  and he will not
recharge these points during any gather (see below) within this hour
time period.   Limit is 10 points for this function.
Gathering is the recharging ability of sorcerers.   This is what makes
them more versatile than standard MU's.  In one round,  the sorcerer can
bring himself up to full points  (see exception above) by simply
gathering his will.  HE will glow blue for a moment,  and he cannot move
or take damage.  His force shield,  if present,  will protect him.

Spell effects
=============
Probe :   this is a mind probe.  Thinking directly of Polgara's use,  it
allows the Sorcerer to feel around with his mind.  He can read the
emotions of any target creature,  and know rudimentary thoughts.  This
can also sense a certain item.
Creation : this power allows the sorcerer to create something.  This has
one big restriction : the object created must exist.  The sorcerer can
never create a divine being.
Transmute : this changes something to something else.  It is the
transmutation factor times the difference of the two factors that the
object is moving from and to.  If this is zero,  it becomes 1  (wood to
air).   Area of effect is one pound per level.  A sorcerer can never transmute
a divine being.
Destruct:  a bad word,  this is the attacking aspect.  If it is used to
burst a door or such,  it is 5 times the material factor.  If it is used
to attack,  it is as follows.  The sorcerer uses a Rogue
's ThAC0,  and for every point he spends (limit 10), he adds one to his
'to hit' roll.  Damage is his level times the number of points he spent
(so you must spend at least one!)
Okay,
It's late,  and I'm beat,  and I'm sure there's a million questions.
I'll try to gather some more stuff.  In the meantime,  write and tell if
I made any major screw-ups.  I'm sure i've forgotten imprtant stuff,  or
I'm assuming some things.
