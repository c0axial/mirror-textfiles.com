Re: THE ARSONIST KIT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Arsonist

Description: The Arsonist makes his living by setting fire, for
pure enjoyment or for the money.  They are modeled after the
modern arsonist, and pyromaniacs, but have been slightly modified
to fit most campaigns.
     Their main attributes are memory and speed, so high wisdom
and dexterity are prefered.  Since memory and speed are of the
essence he needs at least a 14 in both.  A high constitution is
also important.

Role: The Arsonist is a person that enjoys setting anything on
fire.  If they are offered a considerable ammount of money they
will burn just about anything.  The Arsonist can find jobs as
arsonists, demolition experts, fire-fighters, and fire-safety
experts.

Legal Issues: The Arsonist is very secretive about there work, and
few are ever caught.  Those that are caught are burned at the
stake, a penalty befitting their crime.
     Some Arsonist set fire for the gonvernment.  For instance:
They may want and old structure taken down so they hire an arsonist
to do the job.
     Those that work for the government fighting fire or tearing
down (burning) old building have a place in society, but those that
burn just for money and the fun of it are sought after and killed.

Secondary Skills: If your DM is using secondary skills the
character can select any of the following secondary skills:
Forester, Limner/Painter, Mason, Scribe, and Woodworker.  The
character can have any two of the five.

Weapon Proficiencies: Required: Bow (long or short), dagger, flight
arrows (burning), javelin, sling, spear, and the longsword.  The
Arsonist must become proficient in these weapons before gaining
proficiencies in any other weapon.

Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus nonweapon proficiencies: Fire-
building, Weather Sense.  Recommended (General): Carpentry,
direction sense, riding land-based, rope use, stonemasonary;
(Rogue): Blind-fighting, disguise.

Equipment: The Arsonist will have the equipment he deems necessary
for his survival.  Most will have a 100' rope, grapling hook, and
a kit of various disquises, 2 flasks oil, tinder box.  They will
have a dagger, bow and 6-10 arrows or spears.
     Some Arsonist will have a riding horse near buy as a means of
escape.  Other supplies can be kept in saddles.

Skill Progression: The Arsonist tend to have fairly balanced thief
skills.  The only skills of little interest are Pick Pockets, and
Read Languages, they will distribute their abilties in other skills
are they deem necessary.

Special Benefits: The Arsonist has the a skill known as Pyrology:
This is the science of starting fires, and it consists of two
parts.   * Part One: The Arsonist has developed a Burning Hands
ability,, like the first level Wizard spell of the same name.
This allow the Arsonist to cause 1d6 +1 hit points of fire
damage.  * Part Two: The Arsonist increase in the ability of
setting fires, and recieves a bonus of +1 to setting this them.
This increase every four level to a maximum of +3.
     The Arsonist recieves the ability of Pyrostrife: This is a
bonus of +1 to hit and damage when firing a flaming arrow, or
throwing a flaming spear.

Special Hindrances:  The Arsonist can not wear armor heavier than
studded leather, because the Arsonist has to be able to escape from
a fire quickly and safely.
     The Arsonist only recieve his Pyrology ability if he has the
nonweapon proficiencies of carpentry, and stonemasonary.  The
Arsonist must recieve these proficiencies at first level.  The
Arsonist needs these skills too find the main support structure of
a building so that the whole building would collapse.
     The Arsonist only recieves his Pyrostrife ability when
firing flaming arrows or throwing flaming spears, and must
proficient with these weapons at first level.
      The Arsonist prefer to be Neutral Evil, but can be any
evil.  They do not recieve the 10 percent bonus to earned
experience.  While the Arsonist can have any monetary amount of
treasure, they cannot have more treasure than they can carry.  So
in this case a Bag of Holding is very useful.

Races: Any race that enjoys setting things on fire can be a
Arsonist, but it is only recommended for humans, and half-elves.
Nonhuman characters are limited to their racial restrictions of
their choosen class.

Notes: This kit is only recommended for thiefs.  The DM may wish to
use the Arsonist kit as a type of fire fighter instead of starting
them, he will put them out.  In this case the character will be
good, and designed to stop fires.
