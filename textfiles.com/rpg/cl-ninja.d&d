Re: "NINJA" CLASS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE NINJA KIT

DESCRIPTION: Ninjas are invisible warriors, spies, and assassins
practied in the skills of concealment, stealth, trickery,
disguise, and acrobatics.  The ninja is a thief that is based
upon the medieval Japanese ninja.
      To become a ninja, the character must meet the minimum
scores of 14 in dexterity, and charisma, and a 15 in intell
igence to qualify as a ninja.  The ninja has no prome requisite,
and so never gains the 10% bonus to earned experience.  The ninja
must be any non good alignment.

ROLE: The ninja do not really exist, at least that is what a
ninja will have one believe.  Their abilities and reputations are
clouded in mystery.  Many ascribe supernatural powers to them.
The ninjas have done nothing to discourage these stories and may
have spread the tales themselves.  Such confusion only enhances
their reputations, inspiring more terror at the mention of their
name.

SECONDARY SKILLS: Fisher, Hunter, Navigator, and the Scribe, are
suggested secondary skills for the ninja, if the DM uses
secondary skills.

WEAPON PROFICIENCIES: The ninjas use many unique devices.  A
ninja can use a variety of weapons preferred by his class without
loss of honor.  These weapons will appear on the Ninja Weapons
Table.

NONWEAPON PROFICIENCIES: Bonus nonweapon proficiencies: Disguise,
and Tightrope Walking.  Recocommended: (Rogue) Blind-fighting,
forgery, jumping, reading lips, tumbling; (General) Direction
Sense, etiquette, riding land-based, and rope use.

SKILL PROGRESSION: The vital skills of the ninja are: Hide in
Shadows, Move Silently, Find/Remove Traps, Climb Walls, and Open
Locks.  The ninja seeks a fairly even distribution among these
skills.

EQUIPMENT: The ninja uses many uniques devices and these devices
will be listed on the Ninja Weapons Table.  Besides weapons the
ninja can use the weapons of the western world if the DM allows
it.  The ninja will only buy equipment and supplies that he deems
necessary for their survival.

SPECIAL BENEFITS: The ninja posess a number of unique powers not
available to a normal thief.
      At 1st level the ninja begins using his ki when holding his
breath.  The character can hold his breath for a number of rounds
equal to his level.  This power can be used a number of times per
day equal to his level.  This is the only power that is available
to the ninja kit for more information see the Oriental Adventures
book.


      The Ninja get multiple attacks.
Level              Attacks per round
1 - 6                       1
7 - 14                     3/2
 15+                        2

SPECIAL HINDRANCES:  The multiple attacks of the ninja character
apply only when using ninja weapons.
      Honor is extremely important to the ninaj since it is a
measure of his reliability.  The two most important are secrecy
and completion of his mission.  Should the idenity of a ninja
character ever be discovered, he becomes a nukenin and considered
a normal thief and gains no more ninja abilities.  Second,
failing to complete a mission results in the character becoming a
nukenin, although the mission can be attempted more then once,
and he is considered a nukenin until he completes his mission.  A
ninja who refuses to complete a mission becomes a nukenin, and is
considered to have defied the head of his clan.
      Ninjas are ruled absolutely by the head of a clan or
family, and any failure to obey him leads in never-ending series
of assassination attempts against the offending character.  This
ends only when the character is dead or when he slays the head of
clan or family and establishes himself in the position.  A rogue
ninja is called a nukenin, sometimes a hero of the common people.

RACES: The ninja is only available to humans, and both male and
females can be ninjas, but the DM can change this rule.

NOTES: If a character becomes a nukenin, by having his identity
become known he will not be considered a hero.  Attempts may be
made on the characters life, but that is up to the DM.
Regardless, however the character becomes a nukenin, he needs
twice the normal experience to advance in level.
      In the Oriental Adventures Campaign the ninja is not a
class by itself, but to simplify the ninja class, we made it a
kit for the thief.  For more details on the ninja see the ninja
class in the Oriental Adventures book.
