Subject: Class -- Protector (a druid/ranger combination)

This is an excerpt from the soon to be worked on (like next week)
class compilation of mine.  This class is one of my own creations,
which I made for use in my campaigns.
 
The class is the Protector, and it is a specialized ranger class
which combines the druid and ranger class in a manner that creates a
class which fits better what I envision than either multi or dual
class does.  Besides, I really hate multi and dual classes, and hate
that humans can't multi class and all.  So I tend to create my own
mixed classes, whenever the need arises.
 
This combined class isn't the best of both worlds, nor is it the
worst.  It's the good and bad of both classes, and I hopefully left
it so that although the Protector is a good class, the ranger and
druid themselves are still desirable as classes.
 
The class was designed using 2nd edition rules for spells, spell
spheres, etc, but it could be adapted to first edition (hey, I
normally play a mixture of both, anyway...)

Special Abilities
-----------------
o  Protectors can Hide In Shadows, similar to the thief ability, as
   per the above table.  (Normal 2nd edition rangers can also Move Silently,
   but I have removed this skill in lieu of allowing Pass Without Trace).
   Protectors are adept at hiding in shadows in wilderness or natural
   areas, but in a civilized or city settings, the ranger has only half his
   skill in this ability.
 
o  Like rangers, protectors can track as if they had the tracking
   non-weapon proficiency.  This skill improves in the same manner as the
   normal ranger's.
 
o  Protectors may specialize in *either* the bow or scimitar.  They may
   also learn two weapon fighting with the scimitar.
 
o  Pass without trace after reaching 3rd level.
 
o  Speak with animals after 5th level.
 
o  Immune to charm by woodland creatures after 7th level.

o  The protector gains the shapechanging ability of the druid, but to a
   smaller extent.  The protector must pass through a special ceremony to
   reach 7th level.  At this time, his "guardian spirit" is chosen, being
   one of the animals of his home region.  At this time, he may shapechange
   into this once per day, with no hit point regeneration.  At 8th level,
   he may also change into a mammal, reptile *or* bird once per day.  At
   9th level add another form, and at 10th level, he may shapechange 3
   times per day, once each into a mammal, bird or reptile (like the druid's
   shapechanging) and each time he regains 1/4 of his previously lost hit
   points.  At 11th level he gains the ability to change into his guardians
   form at will.  (In this manner the shapechanging ability is still available
   to the class, although in a weakened state).
 
 
Protector Experience Progression
--------------------------------
 
To reach 7th level, each protector must undergo a special ceremony performed by
the druids of his home region.  At this time he becomes a full protector (the
previous levels are simply seen as training) and he gains his shapeshifting
ability and his immunity to charm.  The protector *must* undergo this ceremony
in order to continue advancement.
 
 
Spell Spheres of Influence
--------------------------
 
The protector worships no god or goddess, instead protecting the earth around
him.  He gains his spell ability from the world of nature and animals, and
therefore most of his spells pertain to this.  He does have a few spells that
concern other matters, but he has no power over the undead or combat abilities
that do not concern nature.
