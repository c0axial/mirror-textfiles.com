The Seafarer

Description: The Seafarer makes his living on ships, and in the
open waters.  They are modeled after the modern day coast guard.
It is the seafarer's duty to protect the people, and find lost
ships.  They will not attack any fishing or smaller type vessels.
     Their main attributes are strength and speed, so high
strength and dexterity are prefered.  Since strength and speed
are of the essence. he needs at least a 14 in both.  A high
constitution is also important.

Role: The Seafarer is a protector of the oceans and open waters,
and the creatures that live there.  They will fight pirates, and
protect other ships from pirating vessels.  The seafarer can find
jobs as navigators, ship captains, guides, and fishermen.

Secondary Skills: If your DM is using secondary skills the
character can select any of the following secondary skills:
Fisher, Navigator, Sailor, and Shipwright.  The character can
have any two of the four.

Weapon Proficiencies: Required: crossbow (light, or hand),
dagger, or shortsword, khopesh or scimitar, and the whip.  The
seafarer must become proficient in these weapons before gaining
proficiencies in any other weapon.

Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus nonweapon proficiencies:
Navigation, seamanship.  Recommended (General): Direction Sense,
fishing, rope use, swimming, weather sense; (Warrior): Animal
lore, blind-fighting, endurance.

Special Benefits: The Seafarer has the a skill known as
Swashbuckling: This ability give the seafarer a +1 bonus to hit
and to damage.  The Seafarer also recieves a bonus of +1 for every
three levels of ability for a maximum of +3 toward the nonweapon
proficiency of Endurance.
     Seafarer are excellent navigators, and can handle ships in
even the worst possible weather conditions.  Although a seafarer
would not want to sail in bad weather conditions, he does know how
to handle a ship during them.  (Ex. A seafarer only recieves a -25
penalty to their ocean worthiness check while sailing during a
hurricane.)
     The seafarer has the theif abilities of a Climb Walls, and
Hear Noises.  His abilities are equal to that of a thief of equal
level.

Special Hindrances: The seafarer can not wear armor heavier than
chain, and can employ shields, because the seafarer, has to climb
ropes, and sides of ships.  So they can not be weight down with
armor.  The seafarer does not recieve the 10 percent bonus to
earned experience.
     The seafarer only recieve his Swashbuckling ability on ships
or on the open water, and must be wearing armor lighter than
studded leather.  The seafarer at first level must choose what
weapon he want to develope his ability with.
    Although a seafarer can handle a ship during any type of
storm with very little difficulty, there is still a 25 percent
chance that a seafarer will not sail a vessel if he senses bad
weather.
    The seafarer only has his thievies abilities on ships, in
open waters and underwater.  In area such as a town or city there
abilities do not function, because they are not trained for said
enviroment.  Also the seafarer recieves a bonus to the nonweapon
proficiency of Endurance, only if he choose it at first level.

Wealth Options: The seafarer recieves the usual 5d4 x 10gp in
starting gold., and will spend on the equipment he deems
necessary for his survival.
     While the seafarer can have any monetary amount of treasure,
they cannot have more treasure than they can carry.  So in this
case a Bag of Holding is very useful, or a seafarer may choose a
spot to bury his treasure some place.

Races: Any race that enjoys traveling in the open waters can be a
seafarer, but it is only recommended for humans half-elves, and
races that enjoy the sea.  Nonhuman characters are limited to
their racial restrictions of their choosen class.

Notes: Most warriors build strongholds when they reach the 9th
level, and start to attract a body of soldiers.  But since a
seafarer spends his time on open waters, he prefers to buy some
sort of ship instead of building a stronghold.
     Since the seafarer, try to stop pirates and likes to help
people, most pirates do not like them.  So pirates may want to
try and kill seafarers, but that is left up to the DM.
     Rumor has it their is and evil version of the Seafarer.  He
loves to attacks ships and steal their cargo.  Captives will be
used as slaves.  The evil seafarer enjoys plundering coastal
villages and will sail in any weather for a price.  These evil
seafarers are often refered to as: Scalawags or pirates.
