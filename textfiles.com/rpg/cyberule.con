      What is Cyberpunk?
      ------------------

      Individualism

Cyberpunk  is the triumph of the individual through the power 
of  technology.  Modern  and post-modern technology has given 
the  individual the power to express and realize the creative 
diversity of his own ideas, a power unprecedented in history.
 
       Personal Technology

Cyberpunk  is  closely linked with personal technology, which 
can  be defined as technology which is ''close to the skin.'' 
Examples   are   the  personal  computer,  the  Walkman,  the 
color-changing  contact  lens, and so on. This is the kind of 
technology which gives power to the individual.

       The Edge

Cyberpunk  is  existence  on the Edge. The Edge refers to the 
frontiers, be they social, technological, or mental. It is an 
attitude  which  embraces  the  new,  is  willing  to try the 
untried,  is  willing to experiment. It is a fascination with 
the  fringes,  and  the  boundary conditions, and in general, 
with the Edge of current reality.





        Style

Cyberpunk  is  Style.  Style  is  used  to  make  a point, to 
entertain, and to make an individual stand out in a crowd. In 
Cyberpunk,  Style  applies  to  everything  from  fashion, to 
software,  to  hardware, to behavior, to everything under the 
Sun.  Whatever it is, it should look good, feel slick, and be 
done  with  elegance.  In  Cyberpunk,  Style  is the ultimate 
weapon, and it is used to wage war on the mundane.

       Innovation

Cyberpunk  is  innovation  at  all levels. It is the attitude 
that there is always a better way of doing something and that 
there is glory in discovering it.

      Diagonal Thinking

Cyberpunk  is  diagonal  thinking,  which  can  be defined as 
creative  rule  breaking,  nonconformal  cerebration  and, in 
general,  using virgin neural pathways on a regular basis. It 
is  very  closely linked with innovation, si of Cyberpunk and 
is  expressed all over the place. It's an irreverent attitude 
towards the world that characterizes Cyberpunk.

     Communication

Cyberpunk  is,  above  all,  communication.  The transfer and 
manipulation  of information (which is what communication is, 
in  this context) is, more than anything else, what Cyberpunk 
is  all  about. Cyberpunk rides the seas of information along 
the  links, whether they are video, or telephone, or computer 
networks,  or  printed  media,  and  it is the interaction of 
myriads   of   individuals  along  those  links  which  makes 
Cyberpunk   possible.  Cyberpunk  is  about  the  mastery  of 
information  flow and about the skill in shaping, processing, 
and manipulating data.
