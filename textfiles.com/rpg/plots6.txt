<plot>
On the Island of Ro, there are four countries - the Olven Woods - inhabited 
by the Olden Elves, Arabica - a nation based on arabian culture, Arthuria 
- a culture based on Arthurian Culture and Musketterland - based on the Three
Musketeers - just no muskets :-)

Olden Elves - these are a bunch of stuckup elves that would love to 
destroy all the other races on the island and recover all the elven 
territories. 

Normal Elves - these are elves that live freely amongst the humans.

Dwarves - dissapeared hundreds of years ago into their mountain 
strongholds - after defeating the elves in battle - basically giving the 
humans space to conquer the world.

Gnomes - allied with the dwarves - nobody knows where they now are.
Halflings - very secretive and seldom seen - similar to leprechauns.

About 50 years ago the Arabics and Arthurians were at war - by the time 
they stopped fighting the arabics had conquered one of the arthurian 
provinces (neighbouring the Olven Woods). The elves have now decided it 
is time to recapture the lost territories - so how to do it :-)

Decimian - High Priestess of Elventia (The goddess of Elves) has 
undertaken a journey with a few followers to get the Arthurian and 
Arabics to go to war - their first stop was in Arthuia where they managed 
to steal a missive from King Arthur to a fellow. They then proceeded to 
Mussketter land where they aim to get a letter copied by a scribe, the 
letter will be forged in King Arthur's script, the letter will be 
addressed to Sir Lancelot - Captain of the Arthurian Army - and be an 
order to attack the captured province in full force. - Decimian is hoping 
that this will spar a war between Arthuria and Arabica.

Dacimians idea is then to get Arabica to attack Musketterland as well so 
that all the enemy cultures are at war.

Initial adventure

The party is in Musketterland when they are approached by the local 
Parchment Maker and asked to find his daughter - she disappeared the day 
before while looking after his shop - without leaving a note or anything 
- and taking only her brushes and parchment with her....

This becomes a detective adventure where the party need to find her

In the same street as the parchment maker are a Pottery - Potter and 
Apprentice, and a blacksmith.

If asked what they saw - the blacksmith saw
<list>
1. 10:00 A hunched up man in a brown cape - went into the shop and came 
   out after 30minutes
2. 12:15 A young woman - also about 30 minutes
3. 16:45 A Knight (Soldier of the Cardinal) - stayed only 5 minutes
</list>

If asked the Potter saw
<list>
1. As above
2. As above
3. did not see the knight
</list>

(The potter is very difficult and insists that he never left the front 
desk - if pushed he admits going out for lunch at about 13:00, when the 
apprentice was in charge)

The apprentice saw - a beautiful elven woman go into the shop - but never 
saw her leave. By description the elven woman is obviously an Olden Elf - 
rarely seen in these parts - but the Apprentice swears she never left.

The man in the brown cloak is in fact the girls boyfriend and (could be 
carrying flowers) just came to visit her.

The young lady came to have a love letter written for her boyfriend. Her 
money - 1sp is actually in the till - she will be coming back the next day 
to collect her note - only the girl knows this.

The Knight - a soldier in the cardinal's guard (the bad guys - allied 
with the Arthurians) - he was also coming for a love letter but there was 
nobody in the shop and he left without placing his order.

The Olven Lady - you guessed it - Decimian - she offers the girl 100gp to 
copy the note - (an elf can't copy the note - elves cannot forge human 
script well enough - and also it could be scried by magic that it was 
touched by an elf). Decimian has taken the young girl to an ancient olven 
temple about 50 miles outside of town, where she will do the work

Notes : The elves do not want to hurt anyone and would rather let the 
party see what they are doing before hurting them.

The girl will want to finish the note - and earn her 100gp - (5 years 
income) so will insist on staying - the best the party will be able to do 
is to let her father know she will return soon.

Clues to where she has been taken - going out the back entrance there 
are two sets of prints, an olven foot and the girl's bare feet.

Decimian is wearing the symbol of her church (a red circle) seen by the 
potters apprentice and with research it can be found that an old temple 
exists in the woods....

Future Adventures
<list>
* The Party must warn King Arthur and Lancelot....
* But too late - Arthuria has invaded Arabica
* Now the party must make peace....
* But too late, an Arabican noble has been assassinated - by an Arthurian 
  Arrow
* Who killed him......? An Olven Assassin, An arthurian Archer
* NO! - A Musketter - a member of the cardinals guard
* Arabica threatens Masketter
* Musketter King Louis wants peace
* The Cardinal tries to kill the king....
</list>

Sound Fun

	Here's a little bit about my campaign:  I call it THE QUEST FOR THE
MAGNUS LEXROTA.

	The characters get word that an ancient evil is about to come back out
into the world after being asleep for about 500 years.  At the same
time, they stumble into an old mage lair and find a triangular piece
of decorated gold with a curved bottom.  It turns out to be part of an
ancient holy relic called the Magnus Lexrota or Great Wheel of Law.
There are seven other pieces the characters have to find to put it all
together.  Since this ancient evil being possesses the Talisman of
Chaos, they must put it together in order to even combat him.

	The seven other pieces are really just a thread that you can use to
string together a series of otherwise unrelated dungeons and
adventures.  But at the same time, you can throw in some intrigue from
other groups who want the Magnus Lexrota for their own, and will do
anything to get it.

	In my world, the Holy Imperial Church of Hyperion wants the MLR to
validate itself.  Many of the great Orders of Paladins want the MLR to
launch a crusade against its enemies.  Minions of the Great Evil want
it so their master can take over the world.  The gods of Mondalith
want the MLR back so they can restore order to the world.

	You get the picture.  It's really an easy way to use existing dungeons
and adventures without going to much trouble.  All you need to do is
plug in extra-curricular interplay....

	Hope that's some help!

</stats>

        The QUEST FOR THE MAGNUS LEXROTA (or the Q4MLR for short) is really
nothing more than a thread.  It is a simple yet effective device you can use
to string together a series of otherwise unrelated dungeons and adventures.
Depending on your personal needs, the Q4MLR can be a simple adventure to
last your player characters only a short time, or, in my case, can become a
huge campaign around which your PC's lives revolve.  The only thing you need
to create to make the Q4MLR more interesting is an aura of mystery and
intrigue surrounding it as more and more NPC's become aware of its existence
and in turn desperately want it.  You will also need a pantheon of gods to
make this work, but which one is entirely up to you.

        Here's a quick look at how I plug in the Q4MLR into my campaign.
First, here's my background.  This is subtext that the players get in a
handout before the game begins:

        More than 2000 years ago, the kingdom of Abydos flourished and
prospered on the banks of the Great River which wound its way through the
vast deserts known as the Tempest Wastes.  Its ruler, Cheops the Mighty,
however was not content.  He eyed the rich coastal city-states of the Great
Crescent Sea with greed and lust.  Though there was little doubt his
charioteers could win the small city-states, victory would not come without
great price.  So Cheops ordered his court magicians to create a device
which, when wielded by his army, would crush its enemies.  They created a
device called the TALISMAN OF CHAOS (TOC for short).  Through its most
powerful magic, the talisman created chaos and turmoil wherever it went.
But what they didn't know is once unleashed, no man, not even a great
pharaoh, could reign in the unrelenting chaos.  Cheops' enemies did indeed
fall, but the magic was so powerful, it also eventually destroyed Abydos as
well, and cast all of the world of Mondalith along with it.

        For 500 years, chaos reigned supreme until a new pantheon of deities
decided to take action.  The pantheon of Zeus arrived on the slopes of
Olympus.  They quickly and easily dispatched the old abydosian gods and
began plans to restructure the world.  One day, Zeus looked down from
Olympus and ordered his blacksmith Haephastus to construct something to
reign in the rampant chaos.

        The great misshapen god fired his forges deep underground. He and
his minions fashioned a wheel made of gold and mithril.  It was called the
Magnus Lexrota, or Great Wheel of Law (I use a barely passing form of Latin
as my ancient language.  I think it gives my campaign an authentic feel).
Worn around his neck with an adamantite chain, Zeus was able to halt the
chaos and begin the rebuilding of society.  That rebuilding took form
primarily in the Imperium.  

        The Imperium sprang from the city of Myrrh.  Its borders stretched
far and wide across the world, and its culture formed the basis of life in
Mondalith.  At its height, Imperium centurions patrolled from outposts as
far north as the Clywiddan Mountains and as far west as the Rhyder Pass.
Imperium engineers brought water to deserts, elaborate villas to the
frontier and strongholds to wild lands.  The Imperial drachir became the
standard coinage.  And most importantly, imperial judges issued imperial law
with a cold and impartial hand.  "All roads lead to Myrrh," the old saying goes.

        But just as Rome, Myrrh too grew fat and complacent.  Perversions
and greed chewed away at the empire's foundations.  With most of the
frontier under the imperial standard and few lands left to conquer, the
Circus Maximus became the favorite of the mob.  Gladiatorial games and brutal
executions seemed the only way to satiate the hunger of the people.  Zeus
himself grew fat and perverted; known then as Obese Zeus.

        Into this mix, a small cult began to form on the streets of Myrrh;
the church of Hyperion.  Hyperion the Lionhearted was a noble figure of
goodness, honesty and chivalry.  He attracted a mix of other deities and
together formed the basic tenets of their religion: Paladur, god of
knighthood and noble combat, Azariah, god of learning and justice, Ulfyn,
god of the harvest, etc.  These gods and others in the new religion appealed
to the a populace weary of a constant diet of dessert without ever having a
main course.  Soon Hyperion and his pantheon of noble gods challenged  Zeus
upon the very slopes of Olympus. The War of the gods had begun.  It raged on
for years on Olympus until Hyperion came to a realization.

        The only way to defeat Zeus was to snatch the MLR off his neck and
cast it down Olympus.  In a great final pitched battle, Hyperion ripped the
MLR off Zeus' neck and threw it down the mountain where according to legend,
it smashed into eight equal pieces and vanished into Mondalith and history.

        Hyperion was victorious.  He and his pantheon took their rightful
places as the deities of Mondalith.  But with the MLR destroyed, the evil
gnawing chaos began creeping back into the world.  Despite Hyperion's
valiant efforts, the Imperium, just as Abydos, collapsed into anarchy and
despair.

        During the empire's death throes, a man named Viriditus Acies, third
son of a Myrrh noble, sailed with some companions and formed a kingdom far
away from the collapsing land.  Joining with the native clans of Gaels,
Vajars, and Goths, he conquered the land later known as the Kingdom of
Argandel.  The kingdom seemed to be mankind's last best hope in the face of
the dead empire and rampant anarchy.

        But not more than 100 years after Acies, his descendant, King Robert
III, hired a court magician named Tallok.  Tallok lived with Robert and his
family in the king's magnificent underground palace called Green Castle.
Built by dwarves, Green Castle was the envy of dukes, sultans, emirs and
archbishops.  But Tallok was a schemer and conniver, and unknown to anyone,
has obtained the long lost Talisman of Chaos.  Soon, "Bloody" Tallok used it
to usurp the throne and grip the land in an iron fisted reign of terror.  He
ruled without mercy for 11 years, using his demons to destroy villages,
churches, tribes, and the all-important knowledge of the past centuries.
Finally, an army of Robert's former knights and men-at-arms defeated
Tallok's dark minions and forced him back into the castle.  

        They sealed off Green Castle with Tallok inside, but they never
could recapture the glory of the House of Acies.  Each succeeding king was a
more impotent shell of a monarch than the last.  23 years ago, the last one,
Thomas the Weary, abdicated the throne leaving no heir.

        Chaos has once again asserted its hold.  Without the MLR to reign in
the TOC, anarchy grips the world again.  The once grand Kingdom of Argandel
has been reduced to a chaotic mishmash of duchies, counties, diocese and
principalities.  No one recognizes anyone except the Holy Imperial Church
of Hyperion.


        Here's how things begin in my campaign:

        The characters meet on a rainy night at a small but very cozy little
inn called the Virtuous Knight at the crossroads of the Southguard and
Callanmay roads.  It's located in-between the Duchy of Ulwyn and the
Diocese of Callanmay Abbey in the old Kingdom of Argandel.  There they meet
a hospitable innkeeper named Dorin Tavernmaster.

        After they go to sleep, they hear a commotion in the common room
below and the stable area outside.  A band of marauding orcs has attacked
the inn.  They characters fight valiantly, but the orcs make off with the
innkeepers horses and life savings.

        He begs the characters to retrieve the things, offering a lifetime
of free lodging at the inn in return.  The characters agree.  Dorin tells
them he thinks the orcs are based in a dungeon located in the nearby hills
of Tors Brendyrs.  Sure enough, the marauding orcs are from there.

        This is where you can insert any dungeon (low-level if this is part
of a large campaign, or any dungeon if this is a small diversion).  I
created my own called Delvingrim; an old sanctuary for a group of wizards
called the Grim Alliance.  The orcs killed them all and decided to move in
some years ago.  The lair is a series of rooms built around a great hollow
cylindrical cavern.

        Whichever dungeon you use, you need to insert two things: Piece #1
of the MLR and a mysterious letter.  The letter is written in a strange and
ancient tongue which needs to be deciphered by a  sage in a nearby
village.  The letter orders the orcs to carefully guard the piece.  It goes
on to state that within five years he will be ready to leave Green Castle
and re-conquer the world.

        So begins their quest to find all eight pieces of the Magnus
Lexrota.  At barest minimum, all you really need to do is place pieces of
the MLR in a string of dungeons (handmade or mass produced).  You could make
the quest last a short time (reducing the number of pieces to six or four),
or do as I have done and turn it into a full fledged campaign.  

        Each piece found bestows a powerful gift to its user and grows even
more powerful when used in conjunction with the other pieces.  I'll leave it
up to you to describe those powers.  Only when completed can the wielder
attack Tallok and his Talisman of Chaos.  Otherwise, Tallok remains
impervious to assault.

        But with that power comes ultimate responsibility.  It will not take
long for the characters to realize just how coveted the MLR is.  I try to
shroud it in ancient mysteries and wrap it in enough court intrigues to make
the entire campaign more interesting.  

        In my Q4MLR campaign, the following groups try everything from
begging to bargaining, bribery to thievery, chicanery to murder to separate
the MLR from the characters:  Fishtown Rats Thieves' Guild, Chivalric Order
of Paradigms, Holy Imperial Church, Druids of the Darkling Vale, Duke
Aethelred of Ulwyn, Archbishop Germanicus of Beechanmoor, and the gods
Paladur, Morvidus, and Demetia.

        In Mondalith, I have built my whole campaign around the idea of the
MLR.  Try to imagine the Holy Grail turning up in Medieval Europe in the
10th or 11th centuries, and you have an idea how I handle the MLR.

        At the end, of course, the characters must fight Tallok.  Once they
are finished and wind up at the end of the campaign, they return to the
Virtuous Knight and Dorin Tavernmaster.  Dorin, as it turns out, is really
Hyperion.  He was testing his world and his own pantheon.  He takes the MLR
from them, granting them wishes in return.  It is up to them to decide what
to do next.  The possibilities are endless.

        I hope this is what you need.  If not, just let me know and I'll
revise it.  By the way, my new e-mail address if newsies@mindspring.com
Thanks again for your interest.  If you hear of anyone using it, let me
know.  I'd love to hear about it.

Unknowingly to anyone, supply of drinks (or water) was poisoned with
unknown substance. Anyone who drinks this drink/water is intoxicated
(PCs may be more resistant). The substance causes acute paranoia and
xenophobia - victims believe that everyone is plotting to
kill/destroy/hurt them and take "protective measures", including killing
the "enemies".

The party is hired/ordered to investigate a number of strange incidents:
crazy killers, sudden suicides, people locking their houses shut and
shooting at anyone getting too close. These incidents should be
unrelated and seemingly random.

Every time there is a clue, that killer, suicidal person (etc) drank one
specific brand of drink (e.g. Old Joe's Lemonade).

Cause of poisoning may be changed to fit campaign or be simply strange,
e.g.: drink manufacturer built new installation and didn't clean it -
artificial colors used in drink reacted with remains of anti-corrosive
paint solvent creating highly active neurotoxin.

Hi there!

I come back with a nice plot idea!

In the last campaign, my DM let us find people travelling in the desert.
It was an expedition sent by the Arch-Mage for investigate about some
strange magical accidents. Our PCs joined the expedition, but 2 days
after we realized that the people we met was evil and they weren't sent
by the Arch-Mage, but by someone else (we haven't discovered it yet). We
had a nice fight,  we won, and found some papers in a box. Here come the
genial idea: the DM really gave us about 7 papers. They were a previous
group's notes about some different dungeons, maps of forests and
inventories with notes about how to use some powerful magical items; and
he burned them a little, put part of them in the water and also put some
red paint on them. So that papers weren't completely readable because
of that treatment but also because they were just notes written during a
game session by another group. We continued our quest, we eventually
found the other party's skeletons (very old) and other papers. The DM
treated them like the others, but they were written in another alphabet
(probably he wrote those papers with his computers and then he changed
the normal letters with Greek letters). Obviously the mysterious papers
contained vital information about traps, monsters and so on..., so we
translated them (it took 1 hour and an half)

This adventure was really beautiful and it passioned all of us (we spent
hours examining the papers... it was exciting!).

bye bye

My current campaign (Draekera) consists of the following (I think I've
already posted this in another thread, but...).  Startup information
is first, followed by some campaign background.

Kalah Shadar is a Sargothi nomad (horse tribes); her tribes has been
virtually flooded with Landmar refugees (Germanic-type tribe from the
south) bearing tales of tall, vicious man-like creatures that have
been attacking their villages, killing and eating all the dead (even
their own).  Kalah was part of a group of Sargothi tribesmen from
different tribes sent to investigate.  After reporting back to their
tribes, it was decided that they should be sent to neighboring nations
to pass the word and ask for military assistance against the Beastmen.
Kalah was sent to du'Chade, where the Chadian command decided to send
a team led by Stage (Bandisalian scout 'doing jobs' for Chadian command)
to investigate.  Jadow (desert mercenary) had been traveling with Stage
and hired on for the job.  Hayden is a Chadian crystalmancer sent along
for communications support.

The party is going to examine the Beastmen, transmit the information
back to du'Chade and be told to investigate further; they will find
that the Beastmen were caused by the corruption of the Beast Law
upon the defeat of the Beast Lord (more about that below).  The
party will then have the task of restoring the Beast Lord to power.

So far we've had two sessions and they are about half-way to the keep
nearest the pass to Landmar.  Stage was fairly seriously wounded, but
was about half-healed by some salve.


CAMPAIGN WORLD

Dwarves haven't been seen in this area of the campaign, although they
are present in the Northern Mountains (near the Norse culture).  There
are Logston elves (much like wild elves) in the forest of Tirebanil,
although only the Followers of Saint Laris get to see them; other
people entering the forest tend to sprout arrows.  There are Pini elves
in the forest and mountains to east of Sargothian Plains.  The Sindaar
(high elves) haven't been seen in forty or fifty years. To the best of
my knowledge there are no halflings or gnomes.  This is a very
humanocentric campaign.

When the world was created, the gods bound the Land Law into Great
Dragons.  On each continent there is one Dragon that maintains a
particular Law - there are Sun, Storm, Beast, Wood/Forest, Sea, Sand,
Shadow, Magic, Faerie (these last two are probably the same) and
probably others.  The Beast Lord was defeated in combat by a human
warrior about forty or fifty years ago (hmmm....;).  Normally when
a Beast Lord is defeated his power goes to the one who bested him;
the human was unable to handle to power and was destroyed.  The Lord
regained some of the power but is in a coma, unable to restore the
Beast Law.  The party is going to gain possession of his mind crystal
and will have to travel to the other Lords to repair it.

There are several possible endings to this.  The first is that the
party restores the crystal and returns it to the Beast Lord, enabling
him to rebuild the Beast Law (although the Beastmen will remain
afterward - they are now part of the world).  The second is that the
party will restore the crystal and one of the members will take on
the mantle of Beast Lord by using the crystal - there are currently
two characters that this option may appeal to.  The third is that the
party fails, in which case the Beast Lord will be replaced by another
from another continent - probably a hundred years from now, after the
continent has been more or less overrun by Beastmen and the cultures
drastically changed.  There are other dragons on the continent, but
they tend to be much smaller and weaker than the great dragon; they're
kind of like the great cats of the reptile world.

To actually get characters together, I'll tell about another campaign
I was running:

The original party went into the Temple of the Snake Demons (yuan-ti),
where a couple of the characters died while cleaning the place out.
They limped back to town to recover.  While in town a couple of the
slaves they had freed asked to join their rescuers.  Dave was really
unhappy playing a ranger, so I allowed him to restart with a mage.
The ranger was found face down in an alley, obviously robbed.  Seamus
(I forget his character's name) was a thief who wanted to get in some
practice, so he went to rob a house - incidentally, the house of Therat
(Dave).  He was captured, apparently blood-cursed, and released.  He
went back to his inn, where Ramirez (6'4" Moorish Blade (bard)) was
sitting in the common room and thinking about joining a game of dice.
This fellow coming through the door with a bloody and a rune drawn
on his forehead in blood looked interesting, so Ramirez followed him and
tried to talk his way into their (Seamus and Mike (warpriest)) room.
He failed and was walking back to his table when the innkeeper passed
him in the hall - obviously going to check on his guest.  The different
voice saying he was the innkeeper got Mike's attention - there was
obviously something wrong.  In order to protect his interests, Ramirez
threw a dagger and killed the innkeeper.

Other events occurred that involved lots of running around, getting
picked up by the guard (Seamus lost three sets of lockpicks to the
guards in two days :), and being 'encouraged' by the Thieves Guild
to leave town the party was high-tailing it for the hills - not to
avoid the guard but to escape the guild - Ramirez killed one of the
Guild representatives escorting Seamus out of town.

In short, arrange things so that the party (even the innocent members)
end up fleeing the city with the law/guild behind them.  They will
be forced to work together in order to stay alive...

I ran a short plot that works well for low level characters, 
say below 3rd level, went like this:

A bard or minstrel PC wanted to purchase a new musical instrument.
When he gets to a shop, he looks them over and sees a really 
nice one in the back of the shop made by a well known instrument
maker.  He asks the shop keeper how much and the shop keeper 
asks for a price, which isn't very high for one of such quality, 
especially one made by an instrument maker of such repute.  Anyway,
the shop keeper really wants to sell the instrument, and at any price
(should play this out so the player gets that hint but it isn't too 
obvious), for his own peace of mind.  

After the player gets the instrument and gets it home, he should
be happy.  Then after a few days (you might want to make this after 
some intervening adventure to not make things too obvious to the
player), he starts having bad dreams.  He dreams of a fat man with 
a knife in hand who is laughing down at him, as he experiences the
vertigo of falling.  Of course, he never hits the ground but always 
wakes up before he hits the ground.  You'll want to start these dreams off
murky, but elaborate on them as you go.  You might also have another PC
wake up one night to see the PC playing the instrument (let's say a 
mandolin) and singing in a totally different voice.  When the player
wakes up, he remembers nothing.  Then one day, the other
characters in the party will find the PC is missing.  They should find
him walking down the road, singing in that foreign voice.  

The mandolin is the focal point for a ghost, not really a malevolent 
ghost but one that wants revenge and restitution from the burghermeister
of a nearby town.  The ghost was once a chaotic good bard who liked
to poke public fun at corrupt people and who was a little too free 
with women, especially married women.  He died when fleeing from the 
bedchamber of the irate and corrupt burghermeister, who caught him 
with the burghermeister's wife.  Now his death was really an accident 
since the burghermeister did not knife him, and the bard fell from 
the window and broke his neck.  But the ghost wants to humiliate him 
nevertheless and drive him from his comfortable office.  He isn't 
interested in killing the burghermeister, just 
wants to show him up for what he is, a corrupt and petty man.
That's why he "borrows" or possesses the body of the owner of the mandolin
to lead him to the town to exact his revenge on the burghermeister.
Hopefully, the other PCs of the adventuring group would be drawn in
to this effort.

Since the ghost is not evil, a detect evil would not show the mandolin 
as evil.  Destroying the mandolin would destroy the link with the ghost,
but any attempts to do so would make the ghost extremely angry.

I'm doing something new with my player characters...I'm starting them at 
different times. The first players village is raided by Death Knights, 
and the townsfolk pack up and get out. The players parents and family are 
killed, and the player is stuck with a group of soldiers travelling to 
Cormyr to speak to King Azoun.. The player REALLY wants to find out why 
the Death Knights raided their village after they'd been gone for a 
couple hundred years, so he enlists the aid of player 2, maybe player 3. 
They set out, hired hands, with player 1, and end up meeting player 4 in 
an adventure. Player 4 joins them after MORE Death Knights show up, this 
time led by Gondegal, who I've recreated as a Doom Knight after his loss 
at Arabel, and they flee, only to get to WaterDeep, and meet players 5 
and 6. Seven, a drow psionicist, will join them when they venture into 
Menzoberranzan.

This adventure was originally created to bridge the retirement of some 
rather munchkinish high-level characters with a starting party. The players 
had been playing good characters for a long time, and wanted to try evil. 
This is the result, and IMHO it turned out quite well.  If you need an 
intro for a new party with evil characters this may work: 

A group of high-level good characters arrives in a town known for its seedy- 
side.  In short order, they end up wiping out the Thieves' Guild, Assassins' 
Guild, and all the evil temples and magic schools there.  They also replace 
the former puppet government. 

As this is going on, the new characters (who were members of those guilds, 
temples and schools) escape.  (It is possible that some of the characters are 
friends or relatives tagging along - this allows for some non-evil characters 
in the group.)  This is where the adventure begins - with them "on the run" 
from overwhelming forces.  They join up after fleeing from the city. 
Where do they go?  They aren't prepared for overland adventures or the 
dangers beyond the city walls.  Yet returning to the city means possible 
capture by the new government.  Rewards are being offered, so former contacts 
might very well turn them in. 

The party may resort to stealing some horses and equipment.  After a while, 
some bounty hunters will pick up their trail.  It is easy to turn some of 
these bounty hunters into recurring characters that almost catch them between 
various adventures.  (In the original campaign, one known as The Inspector 
was always hot on their trail.  The players never realized he was just an 
illusionist using his spells to appear as a large garrison tracking them 
down.)  With prices on their heads, the party will need to be extra cautious 
when dealing with shopkeepers who will eagerly turn them in for a quick 
profit.  All those things that good characters normally take for granted 
now pose huge risks for this group. 

The surrounding territory is heavily populated by humanoids and other beasts 
which makes escape from the city quite difficult.  Just because they may 
have a common enemy doesn't make these creatures any less likely to view the 
fleeing party as food.  If they do make deals with the monsters, word of 
this may get back to the city further ruining their reputations.  As the 
characters become more powerful, their names and faces will appear on 
wanted posters in the towns they visit.  Other adventurers may also try to 
track them down to make a name for themselves.  Rumors of the party's 
evil-doings can get wildly exaggerated to the point that orders for their 
capture keep coming from higher places of office and further away. 

>From a DM stand-point, it is easy to convert and use any common adventure 
type with this ongoing plot.  For example, instead of the typical 
dungeon-delve, the party explores and secures a new hideout.  Instead of 
guarding the caravan, they attempt to steal goods from it undetected.  
Many DM's will likely have a blast converting parts of their old adventures 
for this one...

<title>Port of Death (The Plague: Part 1)</title>

<plot>
The party hears rumors of a plague that is ravaging a nearby seaport. 
No healing methods have been successful at treating its effects.  Some 
say it may be the result of a magical curse while others suggest that it 
is a plague sent by the gods. 

Obviously, the party probably will need to be lured into the city - possibly 
some of them have relatives there, or they are hired by someone to rescue 
family members from the city.  (Otherwise, they might just as well stay away 
to avoid contracting it themselves!)  As they approach, they encounter a 
few of the dying attempting to flee from the city.  They have lost motor 
skills, they sweat profusely and are completely disoriented - hallucinating. 
As they die, the party's efforts to help them will be unsuccessful. 

It is interesting to note that the farms just outside of the port city have 
been mostly untouched, with only a few young males that frequented the city 
having been afflicted. 

In the town, the party will encounter more plague victims.  Most seem to be 
from the seedier parts of town, but there are also a number of high-ranking 
officials and shopkeepers that have died.  With the number of dead bodies 
piling up, there have been a number of problems such as giant rats and 
ghouls feeding on the dead along with the problems of burying them all. 
(These can be turned into mini-adventures.) 

As the party investigates, they learn that the plague started within the last 
month.  None of the clerics or healers have found a way to treat the dying. 
Plus, spells that raise the dead don't even bring them back.  Priests are 
convinced that this is a sign, and that "The gods are punishing us." 

One of the main links appears to be money: many victims are thieves, harlots, 
shopkeepers and city officials while the poorer people in the same areas 
(beggars, workers, etc.) have been largely untouched.  If they pursue this, 
they will learn of a mage in the port that believes this is due to some 
cursed coins being passed around the city.  (He's wrong, but it can lead to 
some rather interesting side adventures.) 

While the records are a bit sketchy, the party will find that most of 
the early deaths occurred close to the docks, and have since spread 
throughout the rest of the city. The party will also discover that a few 
of the once popular taverns near the docks are fairly deserted.  Many of  
the former patrons have been hit by the disease.  If they check these 
places out, they will notice that one particularly rich-looking fellow 
frequents most of these places.  He stops in, talks to a couple people 
briefly and then leaves.  If watched carefully, he will be seen exchanging 
small pouches under the table with those people. 

He's was once a thief, but is now a rich drug-dealer.  If confronted by 
the party, he will try to bribe them to leave him alone.  If searched and 
then pressed about the drugs, he will reveal that he received a new type 
of drug "Drax" from a ship that arrived about a month ago.  It has been a 
big seller for him, but recently a number of his distributors in the city 
have fallen victim to the disease.  Thus, he has been forced to leave his 
fancy dwelling and go back onto the street to do the dealings in person again. 
He's been having to lower his price, for it seems that the drug's demand has 
been dropping off.  (This is because the customers are dying, but he doesn't 
realize this.)  His greed and low wisdom prevent him from making any kind 
of connection. 

If the party convinces him that the drug is causing the disease, he will be 
very upset and try to help them as best he can to avoid a certain death at 
the hands of the local officials and populace.  (He is chaotic, but not 
evil.)  He will turn over all the Drax he possesses and a fair amount of 
gold to the party.  He will also provide them with the names of the ship 
and his contacts, but then he will attempt to slip out of town permanently. 

The drug does tremendous damage to the brain producing a spectacular high 
and hallucinations in the process.  Eventually the entire brain is destroyed 
preventing any type of healing or raising from working. 

Note: If this adventure were placed in modern day, the characters would 
probably figure out the drug source very quickly.  Staging it in a fantasy 
campaign creates many more "believable" dead ends for the investigation 
such as cursed coins or a god-sent plague.  DM's should feel free to take 
advantage of this by possibly spinning off various mini-adventures before 
the true source is determined.

The party can bribe a dock agent to see a list of ships that arrived about 
a month ago.  The ship identified by the dealer came from a small island. 
They will either be sent or feel obligated to put a stop to this operation. 
A ship can be hired to take them there.  (DM's can use this as an opportunity 
for a sea battle with one or more of the drug-lords ships.) 

Drax is made from the dragon flower which is only found on Dragon Island. 
The drug-lords know its effects, and hope to use it to build income and at 
the same time wipe out the mainland population. 

The drug-lords are non-human but employ human operatives for distributing the 
drug.  DM's are free to use whatever creatures would best fit the party and 
the campaign.  Originally, this adventure was used for a low-to-mid level 
party and had ogre magi as the head of the operation with a number of 
humanoids (mostly hobgoblins) in their employment.  For higher level parties, 
the head drug-lord could easily be a dragon.  (This is Dragon Island
after all.) 

The dragon flowers can be wiped out using a variety of methods. However, 
completely eliminating this species may be frowned on by any druids in the 
area, as the flower does have other beneficial uses and is quite beautiful.

<plot>
Beginning:  The party hears tales of a large humanoid attack on Rokin, the 
capitol of Drucinia, a lawful nation.  The raid included flying creatures 
such as griffins, hippogriffs and even a blue dragon along with a humanoid 
army.  For a tie-in, one of the characters or NPC's should have ties to 
Rokin, thus leading the party to investigate.  The rumors make it sound 
like the city has been burned to the ground and all the people are dead... 

After the party gets to the city, it becomes apparent that the rumors of 
Rokin's near-destruction are greatly exaggerated.  In fact, to someone 
unfamiliar with the city, they might not even know that an attack occurred. 
There are only a few damaged buildings, but the townsfolk are really rattled - 
so rattled that their tales are already ballooning way out of proportion. 
"I swear it was 5 dragons."  "No, it was 10 if not more."  "And 500 orcs."  
"More like 5000."  "We're just lucky to be alive." 

In fact, the force was only about 100 creatures total... 

In Rokin, posted notices and town criers announce that the King of Drucinia 
died a few weeks earlier leaving no heirs.  In his place, the acting regent, 
Agral Tymart has been convening with the Rokin council to select the next 
ruler.  However, as this was transpiring, a powerful warrior, Dreth Caldan, 
and his forces raided the city, and stole the Drucinic Crown and Scepter. 
Until these are returned, the next king cannot be appointed.  After 
consulting the Law Scrolls, the council has selected the next king, a 
half-elf (who is neutral and a strange choice as most Drucinic kings have 
been extremely lawful).  Agral Tymart has offered a reward for the return 
of the royal items as well as the capture of Dreth Caldan. 

Arrange a meeting between Agral and the interested party.  He will give as 
many details as he can.  He knows the force wasn't that large, but he 
doesn't know why Dreth stole the items.  Agral knows Dreth somewhat and 
pleads with the party to capture him and bring him back for judgement as 
opposed to killing him.  Agral suspects that Dreth had a good reason to 
take the items.  He will explain that Dreth believes humanoids and other 
monsters are acceptable forces; they just need more supervision.  These 
views are part of what makes him evil.  His troops consist mostly of orcs, 
hobgoblins a handful of giants along with his flying mounts: griffins, 
hippogriffs and his personal blue dragon steed.  These forces are extremely 
well disciplined due to Dreth's skilled leadership. 

One of the councilmen, Akelor, will also meet the party as they are leaving. 
He will be much more vindictive saying, "This man must be punished.  He has 
defiled the throne, sitting upon it as if he were the king.  Do not hesitate 
to kill him."  (Akelor is the only one to witness Dreth's throne room visit.) 

The party will presumably set out to deal with Dreth.  His base is a 
mountain keep at the eastern edge of Drucinia.  It is heavily defended. 
The mountain terrain along with the defenses make a frontal assault nearly 
impossible. 

During the overland trip, the party might catch glimpses of a grizzled old 
woodsman that might be following them.  If they investigate, no trace of him 
will be found.  If and only if a party member is seriously injured, he might 
emerge suddenly from the nearby trees and heal them.  He will just as quickly 
vanish into the growth.  He will not do anything else.  This character is an 
addition to the original 1st adventure and will return in various forms 
throughout the Rokin Chronicles. 

Near the mountains, the party will meet a (very) helpful elf who knows of a 
secret way into the keep.  Below it is an ancient crypt occupied by 
various undead.  Dreth knows about this, and has left them there as guards. 
He doesn't care if the party wipes out the undead.  Once they get past the 
crypt, either allow the party to be captured or fight their way through 
Dreth's forces to meet him.  His guards have orders to capture first, and 
kill only if necessary. 

Dreth is powerful, and should be difficult (even impossible) for the party 
to defeat in combat.  But, if they role-play the situation instead, he can 
be talked into returning to Rokin. He is somewhat evil, but he is also 
extremely lawful.  His raid on Rokin was extremely selective, as he 
targeted the 2 items (which he believes are rightfully his).  He is upset 
that some minor damage occurred during the raid.  The guilty humanoids have 
been punished.  He insists that he left a scroll on the throne explaining 
his actions.  In fact, one of the councilmen was there... 

According to Dreth, The Law Scrolls in Rokin prove he is the next king. 
(And he is right!  This is due to a number of obscure laws and the order 
of titles in the situation of a king leaving no heirs.)  One of Dreth's 
agents in Rokin notified him that something was amiss.  But, the agent was 
discovered and killed before learning more.  Dreth seized the crown and 
scepter to avoid losing the rightful title, since if another was crowned 
first, he would lose the claim.  He returned to his keep to wait for vital 
information from other agents throughout Drucinia that will hopefully 
expose the plot.  Fearing the party might be part of this, he will not 
reveal any information concerning the plot or his agents.  However, he 
trusts Agral Tymart, so he is willing to accompany a group sent by him. 
(The crown and scepter are hidden in his keep, and he will not reveal their 
location.  This is his only insurance at the moment.) 

At some point after Dreth has agreed to return with the party, the elf NPC 
will attempt to kill Dreth.  He is really an assassin, and part of an 
elaborate elvish conspiracy to seize the Drucinic throne.  He will make an 
attempt on Dreth when the opportunity presents itself (i.e. he is alone 
with Dreth or with only 1 other party member plus Dreth).  It is up to the 
DM whether the attempt succeeds.  Regardless of the outcome, the elf will 
escape. 

If the party returns to Rokin, and then questions Akelor via truth spells or 
similar means, the truth will come out.  Akelor removed Dreth's scroll as well 
as hid and forged the Law Scrolls that would prove Dreth is the rightful 
king.  If pressed, Akelor will reveal that he did not act alone, but doesn't 
know all of the people involved.  He does know that the half-elf king-to-be 
is aware of the conspiracy.  The death of the former king was also 
orchestrated by someone involved (the elf the party met earlier). 
The conspiracy also involves some of the elvish ambassadors in Rokin. 

If Dreth was killed, he will be raised from the dead by priests in Rokin. 
Dreth will send messengers to his keep and his dragon mount will return with 
the crown and scepter.  Then he will be crowned as the rightful king. 

Note: Both the Crown and Scepter of Drucinia are artifacts.  Their true 
nature will be revealed in Part 4.

Much to the chagrin of the neighboring elvish empire, Dreth Caldan is now 
the King of Drucinia.  After uncovering the plot to seize Drucinia's throne, 
Dreth has ordered all of the elvish ambassadors out of the country.  In 
response, the elves have done likewise.  Both have also increased their 
patrols along the Drucinic/Elvish border.  The situation is very tense. 

Then Councilman Akelor escapes.  (He is aided by the elvish assassin.) 
He also steals some important defense plans.  Fearing invasion, Dreth Caldan 
summons a large humanoid army from the east.  All the pieces are set for
war... 

In Rokin, the people are turning on anything elvish.  "Elf-compatriot.  
Even if you say you're half-human, you're still half-elf."  Two thugs are 
seen beating up a helplessly obvious half-elven shopkeeper. 

Agral Tymart sends for the party.  There might be another way to avoid this 
war.  In his research, Agral has found notes from an ancient elvish prophecy 
about an "evil" warlord wearing the Drucinic Crown and the war that would 
follow.  The prophecy also mentions a specific event that will stop the 
fighting, but its translation is unclear.  There are only a few other notes, 
but they seem to fit closely with current events.  The original text is 
somewhere deep in the elvish kingdom. 

What follows is a difficult infiltration into the now-hostile elvish 
kingdom.  After the party sets out, they learn that the original prophecy 
is carved into stone in a sacred vale tended by a reclusive order of elven 
priests.  Along the way, you can allow the party to encounter Akelor & the 
elvish assassin.  They will attempt to kill the party rather than capturing 
them.  Very few elves know the truth about the former conspiracy, and they 
don't want to risk the party spreading it around the kingdom.  As it stands 
now, most elves view the human claims of a conspiracy as rumors meant to 
cover their real goal of conquering the elves.  If the party does try to 
expose the truth, they will be laughed at by most elves. 

This is an extremely difficult adventure to undertake.  However, with the 
help of some allies they will encounter (which includes some druids and 
the elven priests) they can make it.  Not all of elves want to fight this 
war either.  A few fights are likely, but the majority of this adventure 
should involve role-playing.  (One of the druids that will aid them is the 
same person as the grizzled man from part 1, although in this adventure he 
looks much different, so the party will have no idea...) 

The text on the stone is quite lengthy, and it is written in an ancient 
tongue (even older than elvish, but somewhat related to modern druidic). 
A few of the elvish priests that tend the vale can provide a loose 
translation.  All of the text up to this point fits exactly with the current 
events (albeit, in that wonderful "prophet-speak").  In various places the 
text refers to an ancient land in the far east where a star once fell.  That 
land is now a vast desert!  The text near the end is difficult to translate, 
but it seems to indicate that this war will end when a star falls on the 
battlefield.  It also mentions something about Havoc's Day (the apocalypse?).

The party returns to Rokin with the texts from the ancient prophecy. 
Meanwhile, the situation is getting worse in Rokin.  The humanoid army 
is camped outside the city, and everyone expects a battle will soon occur. 
Dreth has calmed fears of the council about the humanoids turning on 
them after the battle.  "With their ancient hatred, the humanoids and 
elves will attack one another first leaving our forces nearly untouched." 

With the impending battle, Agral urges the party to go to the ancient 
eastern land to look for help.  He is able to convince Dreth to spare some 
of his winged mounts for transport. 

The party reaches the desert and soon finds ruins amidst the sand.  In one 
of the buildings is a detailed map showing the once lush land.  There is a 
great pyramid shown in the map that has a star-like symbol.  A nomad will 
emerge from the sands as the party finds this map.  He will not speak, but 
will drop a number of wooden staves and clubs along with suits of plant- 
based armor in front of the party (one for each member).  He will turn and 
leave, vanishing as the sands pick up in the desert.  (This is once again 
the grizzled woodsman & druid from parts 1 & 2.)  The party will be pretty 
perplexed about where these came from - certainly not from this desert! 
The plant-based armor may not be worn with other armor. 

With some searching, the party locates the pyramid indicated on the map. 
Within the pyramid, the party encounters strange skeleton-like creatures 
that have the abilities of mid-range fighters and mid-range mages. 
Inside each ones skull is a glowing gem.  Anyone that touches this gem 
is charmed into placing it against their head.  The gem burrows into 
their head and the creature is turned into another of these skeleton-like 
creatures within 1 turn.  Before that time expires various magical methods 
may be used to stop the process. 

When a gem-skeleton is hurt and about to die, if there are none of its 
kind nearby, the gem explodes sending out tiny fragments (equivalent to 
a 6-dice fireball).  Bystanders killed this way rise up as similar skeleton- 
like creatures within 1 turn due to the shards that are embedded in them. 
The gems appear to be alive and growing, and each skeleton is able to 
produce basically unlimited number of shards from their skulls to create 
more from fallen or captured enemies.  The gems do not affect plants or 
plant-based creatures, and weapons made from plants (wood or otherwise) 
such as staves or clubs do extra damage against the skeletons.  Plants are 
also immune to the gem-detonation.  In fact, any plant material nearby 
seems to make the gems cringe.  If the party is wearing the plant-based 
armor that the nomad dropped, they are immune to gem-detonation, and they 
will notice that the shards bounce off of it.  The gems and shards can 
easily be crushed by the staves and clubs, turning to dust. 

The pyramid is filled with various traps, both magical and mechanical, 
plus a few other creatures besides the skeletons.  There are also odd piles 
of treasure, metal bands and locks, but no wood.  In fact, there isn't any 
wood in the entire pyramid, and any that once was here is completely gone! 
The gem-skeletons have destroyed all of it over the years. 

Along the way, the party will find more ancient texts.  These are a warning, 
but the party won't be able to translate them.  The party will encounter a 
small "harmless" creature that can speak to them.  It claims to be an agent 
of their deity sent to witness this blessed event.  It will lead them to a 
room where an object glows brightly (like a star) and beautiful singing 
is heard.  The glowing object is a sword (sunblade), hanging in the air 
above a magical circle.  The creature will urge the party to take the sword to 
complete their destiny.  It is arranged as part of an ancient magic circle, 
and unfortunately disturbing it will have nasty effects (but that won't be 
revealed until later).  As the sword is grasped, the little creature will 
vanish (teleport away).  The creature is actually a powerful demon that was 
trapped here.  It uses various magical means to conceal its identity. 
The sword is lawful good and will be in telepathic communication with 
anyone grasping it.  The sword will reveal that the demon has just been 
freed, and be very upset.  This type of spell will never work against this 
demon again and so the sword will feel that its purpose has ended. 

Returning to Rokin by air at night, the party sees the battle fires raging 
below. If the character with the sword explains the situation to it, and then 
hurls it down, it will blaze brightly and sing a loud chorus in elvish, 
destroying itself in the process.  From the ground it appears as a 
falling star. 

Clerics among the warring elves will call back their forces upon seeing this 
sign.  It fulfills an ancient prophecy handed down for generations. 
For now they must join this enemy to defeat an even greater one...

The texts copied from the pyramid are translated by one of the elven priests. 
They indicate that a powerful demon was imprisoned there.  It also notes 
the gem-skeletons and tells of a huge controlling master gem that fell from 
the sky. 

Far to the east, a great cloud rises up.  The demon that was freed by the 
party in the previous adventure has summoned the godstorm - basically a 
huge growing cloud of acid rain that continues to grow outwards.  This 
is what turned the lush land into desert before.  At the front of the 
storm, marches an army of gem-skeletons.  Both are swelling... 

In Rokin Castle, the party once again meets with Agral Tymart and Dreth 
Caldan.  All appears hopeless.  "Havoc's Day is upon us!" 

A hawk will fly into the throne room window, and suddenly change into an old 
man, a man that the party almost recognizes.  He combines features of the 
grizzled woodsman, the druid and the nomad from parts 1-3.  "It is time." 

He is one of an ancient order of heirophant druids that were in hibernation 
for thousands of years.  He will tell the story of the ancient land.  The 
demon came to them as a god hiding behind his illusions and promises.  The 
demon tricked the mages and priests to cast a great spell that caused a 
star to fall - the gem.  Once it began to work its evil, the demon loosed 
the godstorm.  This was a 2-pronged attack: the gems to wipe out animal 
life, and the storm to destroy all plant life.  The demon sought the 
destruction of the planet.  But a group of priests, mages and druids were 
able to trap the demon in the pyramid and stop the menace using the 
sunblade that they crafted.  The price was terrible.  That land was 
destroyed along with most of the people.  Worse, the demon was only 
trapped, and the location of the master gem was unknown. 

The survivors set out to find it, and did, but were unable to penetrate its 
defense.  The wards the demon placed on it were meant to prevent any but an 
evil druid king from touching it.  Druids can't be evil, so this was an 
apparently fool-proof ward.  However, the wording on the ward was not 
perfect, and as a result, the survivors from the old land devised a plan. 
The druidic nation of Drucinia would need to be slowly transformed.  They 
would make it a lawful nation, and one day, when a lawful evil king was on 
the throne (they didn't trust any other type of evil king to help them), 
they would have their evil druid king.  For the ward implies a Drucinic king 
as opposed to a true druid king, but at that time, ages ago, the two were 
synonymous.  They also crafted the crown to prevent the terrible mind- 
influencing affect of the gem.  The scepter is a living tree transformed 
into a pointed scepter which can penetrate and destroy the gem.  Eventually, 
the nation would be transformed and these items would be given to its kings. 
However, their plan would take thousands of years to reach fruition... 

The surviving heirophants went into hibernation.  Their prophets revealed the 
dates when they would need to awaken, and now they have.  The druids have 
methods to halt the spread of the godstorm using various weather spells. 
But they need the humanoid, human and elvish armies to halt the gem-skeletons. 
To prevent the gem-detonations from turning these armies into more skeletons, 
he reveals that the gems cannot penetrate plant-based armor.  And weapons 
made from plants deal extra damage to them as well.  Realizing there would 
be no time to craft enough of these items, their agents have been secretly 
stockpiling them over these thousands of years and putting them into stasis 
all over the world - a cave here, a grove there, etc.  The armor and weapons 
will be delivered to the armies shortly.   

To put an end to it all, both the demon and the gem must be destroyed.  It 
is up to the DM where they are hidden - could be another continent or even 
another plane.  The heirophant will take Dreth and the party there.  The 
defenses consist of more gem-skeletons as well as a few lesser demons and  
other creatures as well as many tricks and illusions placed by the demon. 
The party will likely want to wear the plant-based armor to ensure that 
they don't succumb to gem-blasts.  It can't be worn effectively with other 
armor.  Also, it is much less effective compared to other armor vs. other 
creatures, so the battles will be difficult.  Eventually, they will reach 
the hall where the gem is kept.  Only Dreth can reach it, but when he gets 
to it, the demon will be gated there too.  The party will need to engage it 
while Dreth sinks the scepter into the living gem.  As he does, it will 
revert into a tree and its roots will consume the cracking gem.  When the 
gem is destroyed, all the gem-skeletons everywhere will fall to dust. 

The demon will be hard to defeat.  The ancient druids, mages and priests 
were unable to kill it last time.  It is up to the DM if he wants to give 
it an Achilles' Heal that the heirophants learned over time, or if he just 
wants the party to be heroic enough to defeat it on their own.  When the 
demon is defeated, the godstorm will also end.  The heirophant will return 
them all to Rokin and again vanish (perhaps until his next calling...)

Scenario Requirements  

This scenario can be adapted to any level or size of group.  Just adjust 
the opposition accordingly.  I feel it would be best for 4-6 characters 
of lower-middle to mid-middle level.

Scenario Description

A family member of a noble, Lord Ansi, has been kidnapped and held for ransom.  
Lord Ansi needs a party to deliver the ransom and return the family member.  
The kidnapper Reaver is very greedy and is only out for money.   Reaver
has gotten a better offer from an enemy of the noble lord.  The enemy, Lord
Takemiya, has given the kidnapper a bonus to mislead the would-be ransom 
droppers.  The party must figure it out.

Places in the scenario

Lord Takemiya's Tower:  This tower is located east of the Kidnapper's Keep. 
A mounted party would take 3.5 days to travel there while Lord Takemiya's party
would take 7 days.

Lord Ansi's Castle:  A modest castle where the good and noble Lord Ansi lives.
It should take the party around 10 days to travel from this castle to the
Reaver's Keep.

Reavers's Keep: The central point to this adventure.  Never will you find a
more wretched hive of scum and villainy. It is the home of brigands, bandits, 
and thieves.

Eastern Road: The Eastern road is the road that heads East from the
Kidnapper's Keep.  This is the route that Takemiya's party takes.

Southern Road: The Southern road is the road that heads South from the
Kidnappers Keep. This is the route that kidnapper will say the Takemiya
Lord headed off in with the kidnapped family member.

Western Road:  The Western road is the road that heads west from the 
Kidnapper's Keep.  It continues to the Noble Lord's Castle.


NPCs in the scenario:

Lord Ansi:  A good and noble man who loves his family as well as his subjects.
This love has been perceived by the Lord Takemiya as a weakness to exploit.
Currently, the two lords are vying for power and it is a critical point in 
the situation.

Lord Takemiya:  A repulsive man who will use almost any means to achieve his
ends.  Unfortunately this tendency often forces Takemiya to do the job 
himself out of fear or distrust. He will use the Lord Ansi's family 
member to gain political advantage over Lord Ansi.

Reaver:  A former bandit, brigand, and professional thief, Reaver has now 
gone "ligit".  Instead of shaking down merchants for protection, Reaver 
has gone into the insuring "noble person's safety" industry.  This includes
returning kidnapped family members, stopping blackmailers, safeguarding
merchant caravans. When he does this, he extracts a toll from those he is
"Helping".  Recently, a member of Lord Ansi's family got kidnapped and 
conveniently found their way into the Reaver's hands.

The Adventure:

Rumors are a buzz around the castle.  Some say that Lord Ansi's son has been
kidnapped by brigands.  Others say that Lord Ansi's son has run away after
a long lost love. And even more say he has gone off to join the war.  In
any case, you are talking old times with some of your friend's when you get
the message.  Lord Ansi would like to speak with you.

<list>
1)  If the party doesn't accept the offer then perhaps some other adventure
will drop in their lap.  If they accept, goto 2.

2)  Castle:  When players arrive at the castle, they treated very well and
with great respect.  They are offered food and wine while servants fuss about
their persons (Brushing off clothes, polishing the old boots, combing hair, 
etc...).  

3)  The meeting:  The setting for the meeting will be very formal yet 
very personal. I recommend describing the castle as having good quality 
trappings and many items are simple yet elegant in appearance.  Quality 
over appearance. Lord Ansi is polite but frank with party.  His son has been
kidnapped by the scumbag Reaver.  He demands 10,000 gold pieces for the safe
return of the son. Lord Ansi can't dare to send official troops or ranking
members of the clan to "ransom" the son.  Therefore, Lord Ansi is asking if
you are willing to answer the call. Character's volunteering for the 
expedition will be given a excellent light war-horse to carry out the mission.
If player's haggle, the Lord will almost be forced to submit.  He doesn't have
magic to give to the players, but, gold, weapons, horses, land, and rank are 
available.  Players may be much better off volunteering as word will get out
about their demanding payment.  Lord Ansi will extract a vow from each 
character as follows: "I, your name, vow to return Lord Ansi's son at
whatever the cost."   After the vow has been made, a chest containing 10,000
gold pieces will be given to the character's to pay off the Reaver. The
character's will be asked to leave right away.  Lord Ansi will warn the party
to be careful in the Reaver's land.  The Reaver considers himself a Lord.

Reaver's Keep is east of Lord Ansi's castle.  

4) The Reaver's Land:  While in the outskirts of the Reaver's territory, the
party may run across the local "watch".  They will approach that party and
demand a "toll" to cross the land.  This should be 10-50 gold pieces per 
head.  The idea is to get the party use to paying through the nose for 
everything in the Reaver's land. Every watch the party runs into will make 
this demand.

5)  The Reaver's Town:  There is a modest town surrounding the Reaver's Keep.
The town is surrounded by a tall stone wall.  Nobody is let into the town
unless they have a pass that has been signed by the office of the gatekeeper.
The gate guard's will say they can't come into town without permission and 
will charge the party 100GP+ to tell them how to get permission.  It will
cost 200-300GP to have the guard arrange to get the gatekeeper to see them.
The gatekeeper will charge 500GP for the pass.

6)  The Reaver's Keep: Once inside the town, the party must arrange to see
the Reaver. It should take the paying of several officials to arrange the
meeting. The meeting will be scheduled for the next morning. 

7)  The Meeting with the Reaver:  The Reaver will have a large entourage 
escorting him everywhere.  When he enters his throne room many horns blow
tribute to the king of thieves.  Many servants run about performing small
duties and unimportant tasks.  The character's will be allowed to sit on the
floor while the king towers above in his tall throne.  Finally, the Reaver
will announce that Lord Ansi's son is no longer visiting the "castle". If 
asked for information, he will uncharacteristically give the party free 
information.  He will say something like, "I really shouldn't tell you 
where the son went to, but, you may find it interesting to take the road
South of town."  Now this is not a lie or a deception in the sense that he
really isn't saying anything specific. He doesn't know that the party won't
find the road going South as interesting. Also, it is truthful that he feels
that he shouldn't tell the party where the son went to without getting paid 
for it.  
</list>

Note:  The Load Takemiya has paid the Reaver 15,000 gold pieces for Lord
Ansi's son and an additional 2,000 gold pieces to misinform the party about
heading South to get the son.  The Reaver will keep this promise unless 
offered at least 5,000 gold pieces or more. An observant party should quickly
reason that the information could be false and offer money for the real deal.

Note:  I highly recommend describing the Reaver's Keep as gaudy looking and
fake.  The Reaver and his servants where brightly colored clothing which is
of poor quality.  Basically, the Reaver isn't royal and is projecting what
he thinks a king should look like. He is smart enough to know when people
are sucking up to him.  He loves it! If the party tries to trick him into
giving up information by catering to his ego, he will still give the false
information.

Movement:  Lord Takemiya's party will move at a rate of 1 movement factor (MF)
per day.  The party should have horses and no wagons, and will get 2 MF per 
day. Lord Takemiya is one day ahead of the party in the Eastern direction.
It takes 7 MF to get from the Reaver's Keep to Takemiya's tower. So Takemiya
will arrive at his tower in 6 days from today.  If the party takes the South
road, they have to travel back to Reaver's Keep if they want to head East.
This is due to the mountain location of Reaver's "kingdom".  If the party 
wants to travel over the mountains, cut their movement to 1/4 to 1/2 MF per 
day.

Before leaving the Reaver's Keep, the party can find out the following 
information if they search for it and pay for it.

Rumors found in Bars:
<list>
1) Lord Ansi's son left town yesterday (alone).
2) Lord Ansi's son was taken by an enemy of Lord Ansi.
3) Lord Ansi has sent an assassin to kill Reaver.  He is a member of
   a supposed "ransom" party.
4) Someone who recognized Lord Ansi's son saw him shackled to a wagon
   yesterday.  Not sure which direction they were going.
</list>

Rumors found in Reaver's Keep:
<list>
1) For a LARGE amount of gold a staff member will reveal that Lord 
Takemiya took Lord Ansi's son and made some sort of secret deal with 
the Reaver.
2) A staff member will sell the party a map to the location of where Lord
Ansi's son is held hostage.  NOTE:  This is a false map that could lead to
either a building within Reaver's Keep or somewhere outside of town.
</list>

Rumor found by asking the Guards at the South Gate:

The guards don't remember anyone leaving the South gate recently who matches
the description of Lord Ansi's son, Lord Takemiya, or the wagons. 

Rumor found by asking the Guards at the East Gate:

The guards do remember someone leaving the East gate recently who matches
the description of Lord Ansi's son, Lord Takemiya, or the wagons.  For an
additional sum of gold they will say that this happened yesterday.

Closing notes and possible outcomes:
<list>
1)  The party goes South and doesn't figure it out until it is too late.
Lord Takemiya arrives safely to his tower.  The party may try to assault
the Tower or try negotiation.  The GM should choose the best ending to either
situation.  Lord Takemiya will want assurances and concessions from Lord Ansi.
Remember, Lord Takemiya is not trusting and can't be trusted.
Assault should be very tough.

2)  The party catches Lord Takemiya and his party. A fight may/will happen
unless they can convince Lord Takemiya to give it up. The fight should not
be too difficult for the party.  You should figure out what to do if the
party captures or kills Lord Takemiya.  Perhaps Takemiya has a trick up
his sleeve to escape capture or death. If the players manage to kill the son
watch out.  Lord Takemiya will use this to his advantage and against the party.
He may go as far as mending the fences with Lord Ansi in order to appear
innocent.  He may imply that the party was working with the Reaver and even
offered to ransom the son to Lord Takemiya.
</list>

Conclusion:  

Should the party save the son, Lord Ansi will be grateful. He will follow
any commitments he made to party members, but, the word will get out that
they forced him.  Party members who volunteered get to keep the light 
war-horse and are given letters of mark against the Reaver and his kingdom.

To Be Played in Late December

In December the characters are contacted by a mysterious stranger, a contact
from an anonymous person wanting to hire them. He takes them on a half
mystical journey through the polar ice to the North Pole. Here they meet
their employer between his fairy staff and toy making facilities. It is,
well, Santa Claus himself.

The gentle, old, but powerful entity has a quest for them to accomplish. He
needs a small Christmas present delivered to Eridian Rashor, also known as
The Blood Red (or take some infamous villain of your world, a Warlord and
evil Sorcerer. The self-proclaimed rules of Eastern Skandia (or some very
distant province of your world) currently resides in the High Castle, an
ancient fortress he seized from the elves. He is known for some of the
vilest acts in recent history, like the Massacre of Wingholm, where he had
2000 elves slaughtered during negotiations, the Unholy Tuesday, on which he
had 200 nuns performing sexual acts in public or the Midsummernights
Sacrifice, during which he sacrificed 300 children to attract the Dark God
Daimor only to trap him and relieve him of his powers. You get the idea. He
is the natural enemy of anything that breathes in Skandia.

The idea behind this quest is, as Santa explains, that if there is someone
who is not likely to get any presents, like the Blood Red, but another one
desperately wants to give him one and absolutely cannot, it is Santa's duty
to bring him one or he hires others to do so, when he has no time to deal
with customers as difficult as the Blood Red, like this year. The present is
a shoebox sized case in plain white silk paper with a nice, red ribbon (it
is also immune to scrying magic) and they have to deliver it exactly on
Christmas eve (or on Julfest, as it is called in Skandia). He wont tell what
the present is or who the subconscious donator is. Of course, when you work
for Santa Claus, you are allowed to write a Christmas list with a present
for yourself and presents for other characters and NPCs as well. They are
allowed to use Santa's reindeer sleight to fly to Skandia and, of course,
also some magical red and white cloaks if they want.

When they reach Skandia, they have to realize that their mission is much
more difficult than it might have sounded. Unfortunately, the High Castle is
under siege by the combined forces of order. Gathered in five camps around
the fortress are an army of the Brotherhood of the Ring, Paladins, the
Seventh Imperial Legion, including some silver dragons, an army of Elves
from Eldylon, including griffin riders, the army of Iron Fist, a dwarven
thane, with lots of siege engines and, if you like cannons and the army of
the Duke of Skandia. Neither will be happy about some strange guys who
deliver goods into the besieged castle and will shoot down any reindeer
sleight trespassing their siege. On the other hand, they will probably
welcome a group of adventurers willing to aide in the attack.

The castle is held by the Blood Red himself, who doesn't expect any
deliveries, his guard of well equipped and experienced Black Ogres, the
weird Necromancer Tuchlon and his undead legion, Chim One Eye, a savage and
cruel barbarian and his men, the dark elven Weapon Master Tridon Talass and,
last but not least, the enslaved god Daimor and his priesthood. His orc and
human troops have deserted before the siege began. Only two human servants
are still in the castle, Dai, the old butler and Irina, a kitchen maid. She
is secretly in love with the Blood Red (don't ask ME why) and is, though
unknowingly, the cause for the present.

The player succeed if they get the present (a musical clock with a romantic
tune from the Blood Reds childhood) to the Rashor on Christmas eve, but they
could also get him to flee with the kitchen maid (Hey, a Christmas adventure
HAS to be romantic !) and thereby crushing the evil alliance and winning the
war for good.

The following celebration and especially the exchange of presents should be
nice ("Huh, what a nice sword ! I hope its more magic than my old one.",
"Hey, isn't that my old lance, that my character lend to yours 3 years 
ago?", "A book? Who of you ****** expects my Assassin to read a book?",
"What a nice statue. What do you think is its retail value?", "Warm 
socks? MAGES do not wear warm socks! ", "Oh no. Not more magic ginger bread!")

This adventure is very good to use as a startup, and to show

The party is hired to deliver some important object (sword, tome,
whatever) to a guy in a nearby city or town. On the way, they must cross
a wide river. When they arrive at the bridge, they are stopped by 2 men
with weapons, and asked to pay a toll (a big toll.) While they are
getting the money, or if they refuse, they are ambushed by about 10 more
thieves hiding in the woods surrounding the bridge. The 2 tollmen also
attack. The enemy's weapons are poisoned so that the victims will fall
unconscious very quickly. When the PCs awaken, they are at the bottom of
a deep pit in the forest. All their possessions are stolen. Once they
get out (it shouldn't be too hard), they are lost. After a lot of
searching, have them come to a path. If they follow it, it will lead to
a ruined cottage. The men who ambushed them are there, either sleeping
or awake (depending on whether it's day or night.) The PCs will
recognize them and (hopefully) plan to ambush them to get their stuff
back. This time they outnumber the bandits, and have the element of
surprise, but are unarmed. If the bandits are asleep, there is only one
on watch, and the party should win.

Assuming it's middle-ages Europe that you're after, there are plenty of
things to draw adventures from....

Problems of Feudalism:  Nobles rule the serfs, exploit them mercilessly.
The serfs could be tired of this crap, and the PCs may find themselves in
the middle of an insurrection.

Intrigue:  The middle ages were rife with all sorts of intrigues, both
between nobles, and with the Church.  There was backstabbing, jealousy,
infidelity, infighting, inbreeding, and all sorts of other nasty behavior
going on.

Crusades:  The Church is powerful, and needs to get rid of a few nobles.
Send 'em on some religious errand with huge armies and the Grace of God
behind them!

Plagues:  It's the Dark Ages!  Disease is rampant, and makes one hell of a
backdrop for PCs to get stuck in!  I did this once, and it was a very cool
game, and the players actually had fun!  ;)

War:  If all else fails, go William Wallace on their ass!  ;)  Wars offer
all sorts of adventure hooks, and they happen for an infinite variety of
reasons.

Land:  Ties in nicely with War, as it tends to be the prime reason for
violence.  Perhaps one or more of the PCs inherited (or shall inherit) a
title and the lands to go with it.  Since, in the Middle Ages, land =
power, the PC will probably want to do everything in his/her power to keep
it.

Social Injustice:  The Mid-ages were not a fair time.  Women were
frequently treated like dirt, as were ethnic minorities, pagans, children,
the underprivileged, etc.

Incidentally, I read a very good book (entitled "Shield of Three Lions,"
by Pamela Kaufmann), in which a girl disguised herself as a boy in the
hopes of keeping hold over her father's land, after he is brutally
murdered.  The whole thing takes place during the Crusades, and I highly
recommend it for the historical backdrop, as well as the excellent
dialogue she writes.    The girl is trying to reach King Richard to
validate her claims to the land.  However, this girl is far from worldly,
and the reader learns about all the "interesting" facets of medieval life
as she does.

Also, I don't know if White Wolf's World of Darkness games are your thing,
but the Vampire: the Dark Ages main rulebook may be worth at least a
cursory thumb-through for ideas.  You'd have to decide for yourself how
useful it is, though.  Other games, such as Pendragon by Chaosium (IIRC),
and Ars Magica  make use of the time period, as well.  V:tDA and Ars
Magica are a bit more magically-inclined than you seem to want, though.

There is a historical AD&D supplement called "Charlemagne's Paladins" that
may be of some use, and the "Celts" supplement may also be a fun read,
even if a bit before the time period you want.  These supplements may be
out of print, these days, however.

Finally, if you keep on being stuck, you may want to give some thought to
changing campaigns.  Think about it.  Are you fresh out of ideas PERIOD,
or only for this particular campaign?

	Your players are in a small inn when a group of priest (good) are
yelling to everybody:"If you want to save your life run outta here!".
The adventurer, curious see that an army of skeletons, death knights,
ogres, orcs and evils giants are starting to enter in the city. After
their observation the small group of priest are starting to go in the
melee when skeleton enter in the inn.

	Skeleton are arriving from everywhere, the priest are starting the
battle with them but after a little time all of them are dead or
seriously injured. The players have a chance to exit by the window,
now they are obligated to make a saving throw vs. magic. If they failed
they are staying if success they can go out of the window with another
who failed.

	When they are out of the inn it, skeleton are running after them to
make sure they go out of the town after 30 minutes the town is burning
when they are out of the town they see a small fortress that was not
already there yesterday so they were wondering how to enter when the
portal open wide to let them enter...

	After they enter in the small castle they see a pile of dead warrior
weapon, armor, helmet and blood are everywhere. If they lost a weapon they
find out in the pile. The most intelligent in the party see a large trace
of coagulate blood crossing all over the piece and ending at a large
stairway were two humans are there he see that their blood has been
sucked by a huge creature because of a teeth live there by the
monsters. After that a very big shadow enter in the piece :"A blood
sucker worm". After the battle they enter the stairway to the next level.

After 3 hours pass in the dungeon (where you can put monsters to make
fun) a Skeleton in armor is looking at them on a pile of bone. "You
little worm cross my territory in the 400 years I've pass killing people
to make my valorous army your the only one who see mee..." A huge sword
(two handed) appears in his hands by magic, the final combat starts.

Here his stats:
<stats>
Hit points: 46
Magic resistance :90%
Special power: disintegration once by three rounds
Damage: sword +5 (1d100 / 3d6)
special defenses: -2 to enemy attack roll (if good alignment), +2 or
better magical weapon to hit.
</stats>

If the party survives one of the group member can take the sword +5 and
the fortress explode so every group member receive 1d6 point of damage.
After that they see that nothing have been passed and the town is like
when you entered the inn...

<length>Long</length>
<setting>Ship</setting>
<genre>Sci-Fi</genre>
<type>Quest</type>
<type>Affliction</type>
<plot>
This synopsis is available for the use of private
individuals, anyone wanting to make a profit off it should contact Lance
Berg regarding some sort of reimbursement...The characters are recruited
to do a job, but the job screws up and dumps them in the middle of a
hijacking.  They are on their own as to whether they try to stop the
'jack, go along, try to join, or take over (the last is what my players
ended up doing...)

This mission is designed for a group which doesn't have a ship of their
own.  Other than that, it's fairly adaptable.  It would really help when
you are asking for this sort of thing if you could be more specific,
although perhaps you are really looking for a campaign starter, and don't
have any preconceived notions to work with.

1) Getting hired.  Make up a job involving a covert government operation
which needs deniable assets to perform a scouting mission.  The
characters are to board a luxury liner, travel several jumps down the
line, then take over a very stealthy small craft being shipped on board,
use it to travel to a moon of a separate planet in one of the liner's
destination systems and do their mission, then return to another liner
going the opposite way for pickup.  This should be attractive to the
characters on a variety of levels.  The job itself pays well, which may
be enough.  It involves a weeks long cruise on a luxury liner, which is a
nice fantasy.  They can easily expect to jump ship and dump the mission
at any point along the route; if you start them out down and out, stuck
on a hellhole planet with no way off this itself could be sufficient.
They might reasonably expect to get away with keeping the stealth
craft...

2) Getting sent out.  They meet their employers at a shipping terminal in
the local port, before it opens for the day.  There they find their
contacts pulling open some large shipping crates.  Inside are autodocs,
and nearby are some smaller crates.  They are instructed to put their
luggage in the smaller boxes and affix labels off a sheet, then to get
into the autodocs.  Examining the sheets show stickers with a bogus
passenger bio and address down the route past their destination.  The
autodocs seem perfectly functional, a model without 'glass port, all
slick chrome exterior.  Once someone gets in (and it turns out one of
their contacts is going along, so he'll go first if that's what it takes)
one of the party may notice that the "occupied" light and all the
monitors seem to be malfunctioning, the 'doc shows condition nominal.
Turns out that the group is being smuggled in low berth, using the
autodoc freezer capability.  These units are marked as being transshipped
from a high tech planet, with plenty of routing detail available to
anyone checking up on them; they are posted as replacements for emergency
systems aboard the liner they are traveling on.  This may confound those
who were looking forward to the luxury ride or to jumping ship, if they
figure out that they are going to be kept frozen the entire voyage (not
every group of players will...) and your plot may even fall apart at this
point.  If you have set up sufficient back story, you may have the germ of
a new plot line, in which the party tries to figure out what was really
going on, or the employers try to eliminate the party as "knowing too
much..."

3) Rude awakening.  The autodocs open, releasing the PCs from freeze into
an emergency bay, with lights blaring and an general order to go to
lifestations running.  Their contact knows nothing about this, it was not
part of the plan.  They were supposed to be awakened slightly before
coming out of Jump space while everyone was in their quarters or at duty
stations for the transition, make their way to the cargo bay, and pick up
their things and get into the small craft, preparing to launch just after
coming out into normal space.  They seem to be where they were supposed
to, in a large room full of other freezer bays.  All the others seem to
be occupied, though, and the alert system is cycling through a variety of
languages announcing life support failure...  All the berths except their
own read full, if anyone takes a look.

4) Another Jolt.  There are two exits from their chamber, taking the one
they were supposed to leads them through a double lock (door, space, door
door space door) into a corridor.  The other door has large labels
reading Crew Only.  Oddly, although anyone familiar with the anti-hijack
programming on shipboard knows how difficult it would be to get through
it, and probably disregards it, they will open easily, to reveal a
cramped small craft flight deck, unoccupied, view ports showing the
roiling gray of hyper space.  Too, characters who are interested can
easily get full access to the ships computers through access points along
the wall or so forth.  A list of running software will not include an
anti-hijack program...  At any rate, hopefully the party will (perhaps
with prodding from the NPC) get moving too quickly to get seriously
involved.  They have a tight schedule, after all, have to make it across
the ship to their craft and ready to launch, which is going to happen at
a specific time unless someone overrides it; less than half an hour form
now... The message on the intercom will change to "transition eminent"
warnings and then the group will go through jump transition, a very bad
one.  Their contact will go completely useless at this point, a victim of
transition lapse.  Shortly after this, the warning will go to "abandon
ship, catastrophic drive failure eminent!" Hopefully the group will be
through the locks by now, as there will be a shudder, and the lifeboat
they were in (probably unawares) will launch, along with others along
their corridor.  At this point (although they don't know it) they and the
hijackers are the only people on board the liner.  If they stayed on the
boat, the scenario is going to go differently of course, you are on your
own here...

5)  Now What?  Here the party really takes control of its destiny.
You'll need maps of the ship, locations and schedules of the hijackers,
and so forth; but there is no knowing what they'll try.  They may even
manage to ignore things completely and make it to their craft, which is
really there and set up for their mission.  Since you'd rather they deal
with the scenario you worked on, try to make sure they encounter at least
one hijacker on the way...  The idea here is to engender a "Die Hard" or
"Under Siege" scenario.  Have fun

6) What really happened.  The "government" which hired the group was
really an interplanetary corporation.  They arranged through other
disreputable contacts to have the anti-hijack program aboard the liner
sabotaged, and for the experimental stealth craft being shipped to a
government testing area to likewise be hijackable.  Unfortunately, the
agent they set up to actually insert the Anti-hijack disabler decided that
this would be the perfect opportunity to take over the ship for himself.
He brought aboard a number of confederates as passengers, and when the
Anti-hijack routine shut off, they put in place the emergency alerts,
planted false reports and readouts, and generally got the entire crew and
all passengers into emergency freezer bays.  Once the ship breaks out of
jump, it launches all lifeboats and transmits a distress signal, with
full (doctored) logs and telemetry indicating runaway drive failure, and
consistent with what the occupants of the boats believe was happening...
All the people in on the plot are listed as being on one of the boats,
along with the purser who started everything.  This boat floats nearby,
drive apparently malfunctioning.  In reality, the hijackers have loaded
it with explosives and scrap pieces identifiable as being from the liner,
including the "black box."  They are busy ramping up the capacitors to
jump as soon as they can.  When able, they plan to dump more explosives,
and have everything go off just as they jump.  When authorities arrive,
they should find debris, the hijackers all lost in the explosion,
everyone else safe in their lifeboats headed for the main planet in the
system.  A very close investigation may eventually show insufficient
mass/energy to account for the liner itself, but that could take months,
if it happens at all.

7) Hijacker's plans.  Part of a separatist movement, they plan to take
their entire group on the liner along with colonization gear, and head
out for a distant colonizable world, there to use the liner as their
first home.  This is a complex plan, with clandestine fueling stations,
the pickup of the group, and all sort of other details which need to be
worked out, if things ever get that far.  Since the scenario revolves
around the PCs and the hijacking itself, I've never had to go into too
much detail as to what will actually happen, but it is important that you
have some ready answers as to what the plan is, since the PCs may very
well try to find out.  Who knows, they might even decide to go along!

<plot>
The PC's are traveling to a major city, housing the main temple to a high
standing church. On the way they are ambushed by three to six bandits or so.

They can be of whatever level or skill the DM chooses, but the players 
should be able to defeat them without too much trouble, but still get 
dinged up in the process. If the PC's take a prisoner, then they might be 
able to influence him to take them to their hideout--an old abandoned watch 
tower a few miles into the woods. They might be able to find some nice 
treasures. On the leader they will find a brass necklace with a strange 
twisted symbol, and will also find that the leader has a extremely 
expensive and ornate sword. The players will obviously take this, and 
should for the adventure to work.

When the PCs reach the city, then they learn rumors that a high standing 
lord, high in the church hierarchy, has had his ten year old son abducted. 
A detachment of royal guards sees that the players have the sword (which 
really belongs to the lord) and ask them (or force them) to accompany them 
to the church. They take him before the lord and they discover that the 
lord's stepson was believed to have abducted his true heir, also escaping 
with the sword. The bandit leader was in fact the lord's stepson. If he 
is still alive (escaped or the players left him tied up if they were not 
the slaughtering types) then they can return him (preferably alive, but 
acceptable if dead) for a reward. (and of course the lord will want his 
sword back, which is a +2 magical weapon.

If the players apprehend the stepson efficiently, the lord hires them to find 
his missing heir. They will have to question the stepson and other 
person's involved if they are still alive, and do some probing around in 
the lords manor (the DM can think up details, but don't make it too 
difficult. When they start making headway on the investigation, they are 
attacked in the street by black-robed clerics with magical picks 1d4+1. If 
these picks even touch bare skin, the character must role a save vs. magic 
or suffer 1d4 points a round until cured with a Curse Disease spell. If 
the hitpoints fall to zero then the character only falls unconscious. They 
loose one point of constitution an hour until it reaches zero and they 
die. If they are cured then they regain a point of Con a day.

If they kill the clerics, then the discover they wear necklaces identical 
to the one the lord's stepson wore. The necklaces are the symbol to an 
evil order of spell casters (mages, priest, and their henchmen) and they 
magically serve to protect the wearer from the touch of the 
disease-enchanted items of the order. They also serve to locate 
each other. Priests and mages above fifth level in the order, can sense 
each other when they wear these. Which could add some complications for the 
players if they wear them. If they have any mage of cleric identify the 
necklaces, they will learn its powers, and the identifier will be able to 
sense a large concentration of the order half a day's journey away from the 
city at an abandoned temple.

To basically sum it up, the evil order is attempting to sacrifice the 
lord's son to their god during a holy night that will increase their power 
and doom the church based in the city. Many things could happen now. The 
players can rush in a save the day, maybe with the help of some of the 
lord's troops, and gain a huge reward... Whatever you do, give the players 
a chance to save the heir, but also make it a huge challenge. If they fail 
to stop the sacrifice, it doesn't necessarily mean they are dead. When I 
used this adventure, the character's success depended on an initiative 
roll. They failed, and the heir was sacrificed. It turned out that the 
Second hand Priest of the church participated in the ceremony, and the evil 
order invaded the city through ancient hidden tunnels, and took the whole 
church, capital, and palace.

Basically, they took the whole city. The lord died as well and the players 
got to keep his sword. I took this little adventure and even turned it 
into a huge campaign, where the forces of the church had to flee from the 
capital, and seek help from other nations to regain the city. The evil 
order was also in league with a nation of orc's in the north that had been 
warring with the nation for years. The order would weaken the nation, while 
the orcs rushed into attack. In exchange, the orcs would give the leader 
of the evil order a powerful artifact that they possessed, which could cause 
major problems for the players latter on...

Of course, the DM can take this wherever he wants, and there are plenty of
options and other adventures that can spring from this. Hope you like it.

One day some PCs are just relaxing in a Inn (dm's choice) and a squire
rides into town. He nails a message up all through out the city/town.
The PCs see the page and quickly rush outside to take a look at the
message. It's a invitation for all elves to King Krondin's Keep.

Note: if the PC/PC's aren't elven then this adventure can't be played. Once 
everyone is in the keep's Banquet hall, King Krondin begins his speech
about how the elven race is the best among the hole world. But later into 
the speech, his eyes start to glow bright blazing blue and he then commands 
for the guards to block the exit and then to kill them all. The guards rip 
their helmets off and reveal their razor sharp teeth that they later on use to 
rip the elves limb by limb. The King sees the PC's and orders the guards to 
capture them and keep them for the next meal. That's where the DM has to get 
creative and make the rest up because I am tired.

You know that very fine line between reality and fantasy that we're not 
supposed to cross? This adventure crosses it. Before playing, find out 
exactly who will be playing. Make up a character sheet for each of the 
players that represents the player him/herself. Don't roll their ability 
scores; just assign what you think is fair. Remember that they will have 
lower scores than regular characters--especially Strength. Don't worry 
about gear; whatever the players have at the table is their gear, including 
dice--I'll explain the importance of dice later. Proficiencies are 
important, however. Whatever the player knows, his/her character will know 
(however, languages like French and Spanish, or knowing how to change a 
car's tire won't be too useful, unless trying to impress NPC's with stories 
of the future). You'll have to use discretion with this.

Start the adventure by sending the party on some quest, like recovering the 
Amethyst Orb of Karnin Daganh or something. Be creative. Have them 
recover it and get it to where it's supposed to go. Just when they think 
that they've found out what the Orb does and the adventure's over, have an 
NPC wizard get into a fight with them and cast a spell on the Orb (or 
whatever creation you have come up with). Something will happen to it--it 
glows, vibrates, sings, whatever. Then there will be a bright flash of 
light, and presto! Now is when you bring in the new 'player' characters.
Each one will be standing with their respective 'regular' PC's. Tell the 
group that there are some people with them now. The people are dressed 
funny, and look weak--they have no weapons or armor (unless one of the 
players actually was wearing armor. I doubt it, though. . . ). Describe 
them as looking like the people gathered around your table. If someone 
asks if they do anything, reply by saying, "I don't know. Do they?"

There will no doubt be tensions between the two groups of PCs. They will
probably form two groups, and one will tag along behind the other.

Here's where the dice come into the game. Suppose the normal PCs get into 
a fight. The new ones will probably hide behind a tree or something. The 
normal PCs will miss every attack they make, unless the new guys get smart 
and realize the connection between the game rules and the game world--they 
must roll the dice in the game world to make the regular PCs attack! Same 
goes for ability checks, saving throws, etc. So, to recap: if the regular 
PCs (the ones that started the adventure) want to do something, the new PCs 
must roll dice IN THE GAME WORLD! You (the DM) can roll to determine the 
outcome. If the new (player-specific) PCs want to do something, the player 
rolls for real, in the real world, just like it always used to be.

Now the adventure really starts. The wizard who attacked the Orb in the 
first place has it. With it, he can take over the world. Then the Prime 
Material planes. Then the Ethereal, the Astral. . . you get the idea. The 
group must stop him. If he manages to get control of something, all the 
creatures living there become his personal slaves, and will sacrifice 
themselves and others to stop the PCs. Sounds like fun, eh? An adventure 
like this could span months of playing time, so be ready.

I was reading the adventure ideas section of the page and I thought I
would send one of my favorite adventures for begging characters.
Okay, so the characters grew up around each other in a small farming
village. They have known each other all their lives. Make one of the
characters the son/daughter of the town leader. Anyway, an evil army is
slowly creeping over the land, destroying and burning cities etc.,
slowly moving from the north. One day, a maimed and bloody hunter
returns to the village after a weekend trip and states that the rest of
his friends were killed by the army (the army could be any evil race, or
a bunch of races) and they are within 3 days march of the town. The town
leader summons his/her son/daughter and tells him/her to head south with
the other characters to reach another town and bring back the militia
while the village tries to hold off the army. The DM could put anything
between the characters and the town, and make anything happen to the
village while the PC's are gone.

You come to a town after a long walk through some dry lands. Inside are some

about a cave up north a couple miles. They say there's gold and stuff
inside (up to the DM) but anyone who went in never came out! It starts to
get dark. The inn is to the right. In the tavern part (down stairs) of the
inn, they can get something to eat/drink. When they ask for a room the inn
keeper calls for his/her assistant, and they take you to your room. On the
way the assistant tells you they are going to the caves the next day and
would like some company, or something like that. The rest is up to the DM to
figure out. I use this adventure for new people and call it "intro to D&D".
In mine, the cave goes into a large circular room about 30" in diameter. It
can have an open, or closed ceiling. (I prefer open) and the treasure/items
are in chests around the room. You can put traps or undead or whatever on
the way in/out. something to make it challenging. You can also follow the
cave through the mountain and end up god knows where!

wizard named Teraptus, I gave him the first name of Shion, by his son,
Gilmar, who was teaching at a wizards school. But the whole thing is as
follows:

They were hired to kill him by some strange man. They had to find a weapon
that could kill Gilmar and then go kill Shion, but when Shion is dead, they
find that Gilmar is quite well and wants them dead, because he is now going
to ascend the throne of Havis (The dragon strike planet).

<plot>
How about the PC's are hired to garrison some piddly little outpost on the
border with a neighboring kingdom when A) that neighboring kingdom decides to
come through that area on a raid/conquest/other B) hostile monsters in the
area attack the outpost, looking for loot/revenge/some item or artifact
rumored to be somewhere in the outpost but never found by previous
explorers. Catch: The obvious catch would be that whatever the situation,
the PC's would have to be either high enough levels to face it, or have
enough diversity of characters/terrain/options for magic.

How about the pc's are hired to pilfer a certain item, any item that could
have a real or perceived value to the pc's or their employer. When they get
there, the item is already being stolen or they've been set up and now must
try to get out of the situation without losing face or their lives. Catch:
Having a thief in the party would be really useful, but parties that don't
have thieves can have and npc thief come along, which could make for a more
interesting plot twist if it turns out the ambush is set up to catch only
the thief, and the rest of the party shows up!

How about the pc's are implicated in the destruction of some item with real
or perceived value and now must get out of town or find the real culprits
before time runs out. Catch: Players can get disgruntled real quick if this
happens more than once or twice.

How about the pc's, while sent on a mission (could be almost any)
accidentally come across an item which takes them into a labyrinth or maze
of some sort. For higher levels, the maze could be some sort of reality
displacer, taking the through time at various points, or perhaps space. They
exist at that point in time though they are not from it. However, they do
not exist in that SPACE in time. They are still in the maze, and it'll take
cunning to figure the trick out and get themselves home. Catch: Besides not
being able to do this very often, a plain maze can bore players quickly. Add
a minotaur or a Gorgon for flavor.

How about the pc's are hired to guard a caravan that carries a secret item
which becomes subject to several raids and more subtle inter-caravan
subterfuge. It may turn out that members of the caravan are also out to get
the item. Catch: This has to be played for flavor. If the item has real
value, make sure the players can only get their hands on it if it turns out

building a boat, the gnomes a bridge... etc... Each individual group
attempts to bribe the PCs to sabotage the others... Particularly good for an

happen there but recently loggers have been disappearing. The forest seems

DM's note: Of coarse the magic that Malister practices draws its necromatic
energy from the surrounding life. The forest is of a wild magic zone and the
logger are being captured by wood elves! I had many adventurers with this

all of the "trackers/hunters" of the town left a while ago, on a monthly
food-foraging trip, but that they are expected back within a day or two.
After spending the night in town, the PCs wake to fact that they have been
robbed of all monies! No other items were tampered with, except those that
contained money, of which all money is gone. Come up with a way for the PCs
to get their money back, shortly after which, a runner comes into town

rabbit stew to all of its patrons, because that is the only game that the
non-hunters could catch, and all other food sources are depleted, which is

The rabbits ARE the trackers/hunters, after being polymorphed by a mad mage
living in the hills around where the hunters were hunting. They intruded
upon his land, and he enacted an amusing (for him) vengeance upon them. yes,

rainbow without any rain. totem sticks stuck in the ground to mark out
ancient hunting territories, a permanent illusion left by some wizard,
long forgotten.

a personal favourite: a fairy ring, a ring made of toadstool which
supposedly moves anyone standing in it to fairy land. could be an out

In response to this I've come up with a few ideas.  For the pool,  have
the PC's look into it to find the reflection one of their inner self.
For instance,  a thief who is forced to be an outlaw might see an honest
man staring back at him.  At the abandoned campsite,  the PC's can find
evidence of a struggle.  For instance,  blood marks,  items broken,  a
bloody dagger etc.  At the stonehenge type- place,  there could be
ancient runes which gives a riddle.  A quest can be made from
discovering the answer to the riddle.

A ring of trees growing in a perfect circle.
A huge, spherical rock.

I intersperse unusual but sometimes meaningless things throughout my adventures
to give my players that 'part of a world' feeling where not everything
revolves around them or happens because they take some action.

Interesting and unlikely geological and natural structures can make for a few

(1) The PCs are in a rocky area, a day or two after torrential rains cut 
large gashes in the thin soil. If one is observant enough, one may notice 
that _something_ is buried under a thin layer of mud--something with 
suspiciously straight lines and sharp corners.

If the party decides to excavate, they will find a flat stone slab some 10' 
on a side, inscribed with strange glyphs, some magic, others mundane yet 
exotic; whatever its nature, its extreme age is obvious. If the PCs put 
their minds and spells to it, they will realize that it's some sort of AD&D 
"transporter pad" (for those Trek fans out there).

Can they figure out how to operate the device?  Does it still work
normally, or is it damaged?  Where will it take them?

(2) The PCs' camp is raided during the night; only food is missing, no one 
is harmed, and a single pair of ogre footprints are found. The PCs decide 
to track the ogre (to investigate, not to kill, at least for the moment).

If the PCs stay their weapons long enough, they will discover the
ogre's lair--filled with cages holding sick animals, both natural and
fantastic.  If the PCs play their cards right, they can gain the ogre's
trust, help him with his charges--and gain a wealth of information and
perhaps some treasure from the good-hearted but simple-minded ogre.

It shouldn't be too hard to come up with some good ones here...  there's 
lots and lots of sea-folklore.  The ocean is a dangerous, unforgiving, and 
mysterious place.  These are minor in themselves, but could develop into 
something big if the party shows interest and pursues it....  Off the top 
of my head...

1) Someone spots a strange looking creature(s), which no one has seen 
before.  Bigger things it could lead to...  attempts to capture, 
communicate with, observe, or learn more about these creatures...  perhaps 
they are just ordinary animals, or perhaps it's a dangerous sea monster 
that's best avoided (if so you'll probably find out the hard way)...  
perhaps they have their own language, maybe even a civilization, maybe they 
can offer information or advice, who knows.  Perhaps the information gained 
from studying/communicating with these things can be of value to a 
naturalist or sage...  Maybe some of the old sailors know of the things, 
but are superstitious and afraid of them, don't like talking about them, 
and act strangely when they're even mentioned...  what's going on?

2) Some debris is found floating in the water.  bigger things it could lead 
to...  mystery: what is this thing, where did it come from, and how did it 
get here?  perhaps a nearby and recent shipwreck or attack--by a monster?  
or by pirates?  is there bad weather or a hidden hazard sinking ships in 
the area?  perhaps more is found, a location of a wreck, or a life-boat 
with occupants, or a ship's log.  can a salvage operation be attempted?  
can the danger be stopped?

3) bad weather storms, high winds and high seas...  ship could risk sinking 
or be damaged, people could wash overboard (and perhaps drown, perhaps be 
rescued by dolphins or sea elves)....  or dead calm and a delay in travel.  
crew grows increasingly bored and uneasy, supplies dwindle dangerously low 
and rationing becomes stricter.  perhaps magical weather control attempts 
fail--strangely.  what's going on?  have the gods been offended?  do they 
demand a sacrifice?

4) funky weather--you've just entered the twilight zone.  Natural laws seem 
to run backwards, sideways, and in spirals.  Strange lights, sky is an odd 
color, eerie silence and stillness, the stars move in ways they shouldn't, 
the sun sets on the wrong horizon, or doesn't set at all, for weeks...  
compasses behave strangely (if they exist) Direction-sense is scrambled, 
navigation hopeless.  Odd fog, rain falling up, water spouts...  a rain of 
mice, beetles, toads, serpents or fish...  but they're all inland or 
freshwater species that live thousands of miles away(!)  Sky does Van Gogh 
things, Lucy with Diamonds things...  Visions (meaningful?  Omens?)  in the 
clouds that only some people can see...  Then, strangely, and with no 
explanation, everything returns to normal.  Or does it?

    could lead to.... Perhaps  you find yourself to be way off course... or
that the trip has taken much longer than it seemed to.. felt like a few
weeks, but you arrive years late for your rendezvous at the destination, and
were presumed lost.  You don't even notice until the bard sings of your lost
ship's "final voyage" and of the bold adventurers (you) "who never were to
be heard from again."  Or perhaps upon landing on the far shore, you realize
that you're no longer even on the same planet you were on when you set
sail... your longitude and latitude are right, but nothing fits with your
maps... or maybe the geography's all correct, but where human settlements
had long stood, there are now sand dunes... or perhaps strange (alien?)
creatures living there, and who claim to never have seen your like before.

5)  ships crew becomes restless--the captain has made some questionable
decisions lately, and the crew is growing to resent him.  Perhaps a mutiny
is likely.  Who's side are the players on?  Is the captain a liability to
the ships safe passage?  Or are the crew members right?

6) ship encounter--pirates?  a fellow traveler?  a ship in need?  lost?  low
on supplies?  without a rudder or broken masts?  Perhaps they have news...
or disease!

7)  The entire ship is *swallowed* during the night by some IMMENSE beast.
Everything's fine and nothing's damaged.  If anyone is on deck that night,
all they see are the stars being blacked out, as though something MASSIVE
has come between them and the ship.  The ship continues to sail as normal,
and there's even weather in the beast's belly, and no shore is in sight...
Then, perhaps a few days later (who can tell?) the sky reveals itself again,
and now it's a bright, clear day.  Maybe the ship is completely lost (or was
it *brought* somewhere?) or perhaps it's just outside the port of its
original destination?  No matter who you tell  your story to (and everyone
on the ship swears it to be true) no one believes a word of it.  Could it
have all been a mass-dream or hallucination?

8) Minor mishap--a mistake in navigational measurements has put you off 
course.  Or perhaps someone fell from the crow's nest, or was crushed by a 
yardarm, or fell overboard and drowned.  could lead to...  if there's a 
fatality, there could be a ghost...  especially if the body's not put to 
rest properly.  maybe the ghost won't let the ship find land again until 
things have been set right, or perhaps it just makes its presence felt and 
causes mischief.

9)  Stow away found on board.  Put on trial.  What will happen to him?
What's his story?

10)  Someone has committed a crime on board, and everyone is a suspect.
It's a mere minor theft, but the captain reacts harshly and turns everything
upside down looking for clues to see who's the guilty party.  People begin
to get paranoid, accuse each other.  Maybe fights break out?

Thoughts on Pheruccia, Jewel of Peronia

The city of Pheruccia is an ancient and elegant city. Once ruled by 
the Dragon Kings of Ancient Queg, it has been a free and independent 
city-state for some thousand years. Rulers have come and rulers have 
gone, conquerors have invaded and stayed as loved kings, elders and 
princes. The spires and domes, crenellations and battlements are 
carved from black and yellow sand, foreign marbles and local granite 
sit side by side. In the streets peoples and races from all of the 
Worlde mingle in the Bazaar and the Grand Plaza.

Beneath the ground of Pheruccia lie the ruins of hundreds of years of 
habitation, the ruins and foundations of buildings demolished by war, 
fire and religious turmoil. Deep within these catacombs lie burial 
vaults, underground temples and complexes abandoned and their very 
existence forgotten.

The current ruler of Pheruccia is the Benevolent Elder of the Guilds 
of Ancient Feruc, Salvatore di Luccia, aged, feared and respected 
ruler. As the elected ruler of the Guilds High Council, di Luccia is 
the hereditary Guildmaster of the Guild of Glovemakers, traditional 
organizers of labour in the city docks. Of the seven Guilds of Feruc, 
the Glovemakers and the family of di Luccia have held power in the 
city for 157 years now, and their Guild Hall overlooking the Grand 
Plaza is filled with the sumptuous glory of centuries of trade and 
war.

The artist Renaldo di Capelletto is currently painting an epic mural 
upon the ceiling of the Glovemakers Chapel of Balanced Repose, a task 
he has been employed upon for some 7 years to date. The vast domed 
ceiling of the new rose marble temple, erected upon the ruins of the 
previous Matchmakers Armoury, (a noted brothel and trading house), was 
completed 23 years ago. It is expected that another 2 years work will 
be required before the full glory can be consecrated and revealed. 
People have many long standing wagers as to whether the Chapel will be 
finished before Magdelena do Lattia's epic Tower of the Balancing 
Resonance is. The Tower, a Matchmaker Guild project, is pointedly 
placed on a hill overlooking the Plaza. Giuseppe di Catalan has never 
forgiven di Luccia for engineering the demolition of the Armoury in 
1648.

The Seven Armies of Feruc, the forces of the Guilds, are an impressive 
and grand site in their dress uniforms, feathered helmets and full 
pikes. The musketeers of the Candlemakers' Guild are particularly 
fine, in tune with the dominance of Signorini di Malfoso's in the 
world of society couture. In their battle dress the colourful Armies 
of Feruc inspire awe and strike fear into the hearts of disorganised 
rabbles as they advance with their bright jerkins, proud banners and 
expertly made pikes, flintlock muskets and rocket batteries. Few other 
states in Peronia can withstand a pitched battle with the brave 
condotterrie of Feruccia. Sad indeed that they often face each other 
down in the streets of the city itself.

Feruccian merchants are the widest traveled and canny of all the 
known Worlde, venturing forth in galleys, caravan trains and the 
wonderfully artificed flying machines of Leonardo the Great. Exporting 
the wonderful glass, artifices, meats and wines of Feruccia and the 
other states of Peronia, Feruccian merchants import spices from Queg, 
silk from the Southern Shore and hemp, furs and wood from the far 
north. Their great skill and wisdom has allowed them to balance trade 
in matters material to trade in money itself and the banques of Feruc 
are famed for their fair and even handed treatment of all. Many a 
princeling or potentate has kept the forces of law and order well 
equipped with Feruc muskets after the beneficent loan of funds from a 
Pheruccian banque.

Peoples of other races are welcome in Pheruccia, and many of the 
diligent and hardworking miners, sailors and tanners of the city are 
from far away. Philbians delve deep beneath the Hills of Gold, mining 
the coal that keeps city folk warm in winter and drives the steam 
engines that run many an artifice. In the docks many a boat is loaded, 
unloaded  and manned by Uth'ka'len often with the help of their loyal 
six-legged Ukken beasts. It is true that many people in Pheruccia are 
of indentured service, but all can strive to complete their term of 
service and take their place as free citizens, subject of course to 
the guiding laws of Guilds, Churches and Inquisition.

Fashions always change in upbeat Feruccia and yet some things stay the 
same. Ferrucian women of decency wear their heads shaven with a simple 
pony tail elegantly grown from the crown.. Men wear their hair in a 
crest across the skull, often shaving back the front and back of the 
head. Silks, cottons, and lace are the favoured colours of all well 
born citizens. Purple is a colour worn only by nobility, in the Quegan 
fashion, but reds, yellows and greens are common and loved at the 
moment. Perfumes, tobacco and coffee mingle with other scents in the 
meeting places and bistros across the decent parts of town. Even the 
meanest street will have the fulsome scent of good Peronian wine 
competing with the midden.

Food in Pheruccia is the widest and most cosmopolitan you will find 
anywhere. Staples such as cornbread and rice are served by street 
sellers, often with a sausage of porc or boeuf innards. At the great 
feasts of the Guilds whole Sand Dragons are roasted and served with 
curried Purple Moulds and deep fried Poison Mushrooms. Many a 
Pheruccian table is graced with oranges, lemons and kumquats from the 
Southern Shore, and the marvelous grapes of Peronia are eaten and 
drunk as raisins and wine.

I have dwelled in this great city, this paragon of the city politic, 
for some fifteen years now. It is a great honour that the Benevolent 
Elder has suffered me as Ambassador of the City of Lattia and it is my 
great pleasure to share with him this my fond memories of the city 
upon my departure home.

Giacomo di Funghi,
Ambassador to the Guilds of Ancient Feruc,
Moonday of Rat in the Month of Turtle in the 1673rd Year of Feruc

-----------

Leonardo the Great

In the year of 1636 of Feruc, a young clerk in the Guild of 
Glovemakers returned from his day at the docks where he recorded the 
rice imports for tithe calculation. A young lad of 19 he had another 
24 years left to work from his father's indenture, inherited when his 
father had died young at the age of 43.

As he sat in his mother's kitchen waiting for his nightly gruel, he 
watched as the lid on the gruel pot clattered and lifted, forced 
upward by the steam from the boiling fluid. Intrigued he began to 
doodle on his slate with his marker. Everyone knows the story from 
then on, Leonardo had begun his career as the great artificer of Feruc 
by designing the steam propellant artifice.

Grateful as any master would be, the Benevolent Elder manumitted 
Leonardo's indenture by 12 years once the Glovemakers' Artificery had 
begun the make the sophisticated steam propellant devices which power 
fans, drive water screws and perform other needful tasks in the city. 
Elevated now to working in the Artificery Leonardo's skills grew 
greater and greater. Combining the ancient Feruccian skill of 
gunpowder with the steam propellant artifice and with the Floating 
Bulbs of the Burluvian Bush, Leonardo made and flew the first 
Feruccian flying artifice across the Bay of Snakes.

Now a treasured servant Leonardo invented the Cyclopedic Travelling 
Engine, an interesting circus novelty, and began plans for an Undersea 
Galley and a Cyclopedic Flying Ship. Sadly these and many other 
devices were not completed when, in 1641, Leonardo met with an 
untimely end when a Witchfinder of the Chapel of the Inquisition of 
Fire mistook Leonardo for a known Chaotician. His ashes are now kept 
lovignly in a corner of the yet to be completed Chapel of Balanced 
Repose.

Of lesser note but of great satisfaction to Leonardo himself are his 
paintings, his poetry and his rumoured love of redheads.

Fraggia

Fraggia is the most northern city state in Peronia. It's lands border 
on the Forest of Night, with their enclaves of Kerren, to the West and 
the Ogre Hills to the East. The city is ruled by the Mask of Passing, 
an anonymous figure elected from within the ranks of the Masks of 
Balance, the Prelacy of the Balance in Fraggia. There is a strong 
guild structure in Fraggia and the Mask of Passing holds council with 
the guildmasters on city business. The Mask of Passing does have 
absolute power and should he require it he can declare an Imbalance, a 
time when prelate rule is declared and prelate troops may act under 
sole control of the Prelacy.

The Mask of  Passing, as do all Fraggian prelates, wears a full mask 
at all times. The Mask of Passing is a Death's Head, and this focus on 
Death and Endings has coloured Fraggia since it's founding as a Quegan 
outpost some 900 years ago. Fraggia is a city of tall dark granite 
buildings, black marble temples, gargoyles and death motifs. Like all 
Peronian cities the Temple of Air is on the pre-eminent hill, the 
Temple of Water in the lake created by the damning of the river and 
the Fire Temple smoulders to the East of the city. The Earth Temple is 
as tradition dictates, to the West of the city. In Fraggia the Earth 
Temple is the Necropolis, a funerary complex of low lying dark tombs, 
burial mounds and temples. The holiest temples to the Earth are deep 
within the Earth, and catacombs and tunnels run through the Necropolis 
and to Fraggia itself. The Necropolis itself lies outside the city 
walls, and many a visitor has been pleased to find it so, it's area is 
equal to the city itself, and in the moonlight it is an eerie and 
frightening ghost town. Fraggians are both feared of, embrace and 
dismiss death. They both revile ghosts, spirits and ghouls and yet 
also have many folk tales of how clever Fraggians have tricked the 
undead.

Despite this cultural affinity with death, Fraggians are quite capable 
of enjoying themselves, and once their initial formality has passed 
they are friendly and welcoming. They have a strong self deprecating 
humour, and practical jokes and black humour are commonplace. The 
current Mask of Passing has been known to pull dark jests on the 
ruling council before now, and most Fraggians are quite puzzled that 
outsiders think they have no sense of humour.

Fraggian prelates all wear masks, representing their resonance's with 
the Balance. Most also have some death motif interwoven with the 
symbols of fire, water, earth or air. Many lay people also wear half 
cut masks, women usually only venture out in public veiled and black 
is a common colour all year around. White sepulchral makeup and bone 
motifs are common for both sexes, and throughout the year are many 
festivals and ceremonies of the dead.

Fraggian food is rich and fulsome. Beer is drunk here, unlike most of 
Peronia. Roast porc, pastries, strudels, sauerkraut and fried potatoes 
are common. Fraggians adore cream and most of the shokolatt imported 
from the Southern Shore ends up in Fraggia.

Fraggians have a rather egalitarian view of the worlde. They often say 
'all men are the same under the Mask' and there is a strong sense of 
unity and purpose. With ogre and Kerren raids and common occurrence 
Fraggians have a strong and well funded military structure, run by the 
prelacy and manned by Mask commanders. Military uniforms are dark 
greens, blacks and browns, skull and bone motifs are common. Fraggian 
rocketeers, who launch themselves over enemy lines riding a back 
mounted rocket and then descending into enemy camps by parasol, are 
the elite of the army and also the most often killed in action.

This dungeon is made for low to mid-level characters with at least one mage 
and maybe one thief.  The characters are summoned by the local lord to take 
a look into the murders that are happening in town.  Parents are being 
killed and children are being orphaned.  The players can investigate any 
place they wish in town.  The only clue at each murder is a dagger with the 
hilt being the shape of a baby with a tear in it's eye.  If the players 
question the children, they will see that the kids are not sad.  They tell 
the players they have no idea who did this deed, but they are glad that 
someone has.  If the players persist, they find out that the children all 
have something in common.  They were abused.  Looking into the dagger, they 
can interview the blacksmiths of town.  After many interviews they come 
across the lord's blacksmith.  He finally admits that the daggers are being 
created by the commander of the high guards.  Gortoth.  When the players 
approach Gortoth, he denies everything.  That night another murder happens 
which proves his innocence.  The players can wait for another order of 
daggers to be made or they can scan the town during the night.  Either way 
it will be many murders and many nights before they can find him.  The 
secret is to ask, "How is he getting info about all these kids?"  Another 
thing they have in common is they all go to the same church.  The players 
can then question the priest of the church.  When approached, he gets VERY 
nervous.  Its obvious that this is the man.  If interrogated or spells are 
used, they will find out that he is working with a thief.  The thief is 
going in disguise and purchasing the daggers.  He uses them to kill parents 
that abuse their children, who the cleric finds out from the children while 
they are in school.  Both men are brothers who were abused as well.  The 
thief killed their parents causing them to be split up when young.

Good mystery dungeon.  If your players like fights, throw a few bar brawls 
in the campaign.

<title>Three Witches</title>

<plot>
Three kings meet to negotiate an alliance versus the common foe.  That foe 
employs the services of three witches who curse the kings as they meet.  
Each king loses his senses save for one, one can still see, one can hear 
and one can speak, but none can move.  The adventurers, preferably one each 
from each king's bodyguard or retinue, must set out to lift the curse.

The sages and priests can divine (either NPCs or PCs if powerful enough) 
that no army can meet this threat but that only by blinding, deafening and 
rendering mute each of the witches will the senses be restored.

The location of the witches must first be divined, and a possible option 
is: Entering the plane of the gods and requesting a boon from the Fates 
(Norns) the three crones who weave the fate of all beings, even the gods.  
They will be able to read the threads of the witches, who they see as 
somewhat impudent counterparts.  The Fates will require three gifts to 
grant the locations.

1: A ball of thread left by a hero in the maze of a minotaur.  Sad to say 
the minotaur still lives and will challenge the PCs in mortal combat.

2: A golden apple dropped by a goddess when squabbles broke out over who 
was loveliest.  Sad to say the apple has worms, and as a giant apple the 
worms are giant wyrms.  Once recovered the apple will shrink to a normal 
apple size.

3: The head of a gorgon, left in the desert and now used as a toy by a 
giant sphinx.  the sphinx will, once the authority of the PCs is revealed, 
only release the gorgon's head after 3 riddles are answered correctly.  
(see the netbook of riddles).  Note this is a gorgon's head, don't look at 
it....  (Oddly enough it doesn't affect the Sphinx)

The Fates will then divulge the positions of the witches.  They will finger 
the threads of the witches and reveal that the time has not come to cut 
these threads.  They will explain that the adventurers must complete their 
quest without killing the witches..  They will give the adventurers the 
thread, the apple and the gorgon's head.

In a flash the PCs will return to the castle, no time having passed, ready 
to hunt the witches.

Each witch's lair lies three days from the castle and may be visited in any 
order. The witches are:

Frankel, Witch of Sight

In a tall tower atop a moor, Frankel is guarded by harpies, gargoyles and 
giant birds.  The tower can only be entered from the roof and within it are 
mirror traps, illusions, mists and other optical trickery.  Frankel uses 
magicks that can create multiple copies of her herself, invisible creatures 
and spells of light and dark.  If Frankel is killed then the Fates will cut 
the thread of the seeing king and he will die.  If Frankel is blinded in 
some way (and chaining her in a dungeon with the gorgon's head on display 
would force Frankel to keep her eyes shut....)  will restore sight to the 
two kings who are blind, restore full senses and movement to the seeing 
king BUT blind him too.  (no it's not going to be a totally happy ending is 
it?)

Josel, Witch of Hearing

In a dark forest Josel is guarded by wolves, boars and howling banshees.  
Living in a giant tree, Josel will use silence spells, spells of great 
noise to burst eardrums and giant spiders which creep up on PCs almost 
silently.  She will use ventriloquism, diversions, trumpets and noise to 
keep the adventurers confused.  If Josel is killed the Fates will cut the 
thread of the speaking king.  If her hearing is taken from her (stuff the 
thread in her ears and tie it to her arms so she cannot remove it?)  then 
hearing will be restored to the two deaf kings, restore full senses and 
movement to the hearing king BUT deafen him too.

Carnel, Warlock of Hearing

In an amphitheater left by the ancients, Carnel is guarded by mages and 
wizards who will cast magicks of command and control.  The power of the 
word will be used against the players.  The drill is much the same as the 
others, the apple will fit neatly into Carnel's mouth, and the usual 
effects will apply to the kings.

Conclusion

The kings will now be restored, although one will be blind, one dumb and 
one deaf.  They will unite to forge an alliance and the struggle against 
the foe will continue.  OR one or more of the kings are dead, and 
factionalism and disunity may emerge.  Either way the witches will 
eventually get themselves free, (the magical curses will not return) and 
the adventurers will have three foes not at all happy to let them continue 
unopposed...

Twists

Of course the Fates may be the witches and the whole thing was a way of 
moulding heroes and unity.  The Fates may or may not continue to ban the 
deaths of the witches.

Dungeon for 4-6 players, 6-10 level.

As the party is walking along on the country side, they come across two 
paladins fighting side by side. As soon as the players take up arms to help 
them fight these two fire giant, one of the large hammers meets the head of 
one of the paladins'. The blow kills the paladin instantly. At that time, 
the other paladin goes into a flying rage. After the Giants are dead, the 
live paladin rips off his helmet and grabs the limp body. The person he is 
grabbing is his wife. The head is completely crushed and there is nothing 
they can do. If the players have some way of getting her back, have it 
fail. Failed system shock or something like that. At that time the players 
can help the paladin finish his mission, which was to stop a group of 
trolls from harming a nearby village. During the mission, the players will 
see a change in the paladin's attitude. He starts to pout, gets short with 
the players. He walks off into the woods alot alone. One day he attacks the 
mage with full force. The players can try to subdue him, but it's taking 
more time to get him down and the mage will start to need healing. At that 
time, a final blow will kill the paladin. Right when that happens, a laugh 
is heard and a pit fiend appears. He nods and thanks you for doing his job.

The pit fiend was forbidden to get close to the paladins. But since one of 
them is dead and the other started to turn to the dark side (sorry could't 
help myself) he was able to convince the paladin that he could bring back 
his wife if he could get rid of the mage in your party. An impossible feat 
due to the parties' power. He takes the limp body and dissappears. The 
players will feel bad, but what can they do? They continue on and meet up 
with a group of three. The one in the lead is Tara. She is a paladin. She 
is also the wife of Esgar, paladin that the players just killed. The 
paladin they thought was her, was not her, but a doppleganger. She was 
taken by a group of priests who worship the vile creature that took Esgar's 
body. She escaped with the help of these two comrades and now is looking 
for her husband.

You'll love the way the players will sqirm. They can explain and she may 
respond with a little anger, but she understands. She would like your help 
on getting him back. The people she is with has the ability to get to his 
body. The players can join them, but they won't have alot of fun.

<plot>
This is a high level dungeon for players that are 12th level plus. The 
number of players can be anywhere from 4-6.

The players are called to help a town from a dragon that has been attacking 
with terrible force. The players are known as heroes throughout the land 
and of course will help the player. They spend the next few days waiting. 
Nothing. They spend a few more days searching. Nothing. They begin to 
wonder if the dragon has gone away. They come across finally on a large 
cave. Inside the cave is a group of men sitting around a fire. The cave 
smells horrible. Rotting behind the group is the dragon that has been 
terrorizing the town. Seems like someone has beatin them to the punch. They 
approach the other party and find out that they are thieves. Why did they 
kill the dragon? Why would they care about the town? Maybe the dragon has a 
large hoard of treature? But, where is this treasure? The thieves scatter 
as the corpse comes to life. The players are introduced to a Draco-Lich for 
the first time.

The thieves were hired by the dragon to take certain items in the city 
while he attacked. The dragon caused the confusion, and the thieves did 
their job. The dragon will attack without regards to the thieves. If they 
get hurt in the crossfire, oh well.

    This goes along the lines of finding floating debris.  Instead of
wreckage or junk, however, a bottle is discovered, floating in the water.
This could just be an ordinary bottle, of clear, colored, or opaque glass,
and it may contain a clue in a mystery or small item.  It could have an
S.O.S. or other sort of message inside, or a treasure map, or something more
exotic, such as a bound spirit, demon, or djinn.  Perhaps a wizard has
cursed an entire ship, shrinking it magically and placing it in the bottle,
and then casting it out into the ocean, doomed to float about at the mercy
of the tides until such time as it is discovered and some means of rescue is
devised.  At this point, the PCs may have a new vessel in their fleet, or
else great gratitude and reward from the sailors, should they still be
alive.  This may also be an effective way of introducing a spelljammer
vessel into the campaign, if one uses that setting.

    It could also be a magic item... suggestions for an bottle of endless
smoke or endless water might be good (if it's a particularly *ancient*
decanter of endless water, this item could in fact be the *source* for the
body of water the party is currently travelling on... if so, they may need
to find a way to shut the water off, so that the flooding does not cover the
entire continent.  Of course, shutting off the water source may also result
in major geographical changes over the long term (if all the water runs off
from a large, artificially-created river or lake for example, revealing an
unexplored bed, possibly with all kinds of ruins to be discovered... along
with *deep* mud
