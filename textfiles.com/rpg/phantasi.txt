PHANTASIE I

ADVENTURER'S CHARACTERISTICS



THOLIE'S TALE

Newly arrived on the Isle of Gelnor, an adventurer entered the remote
town of Pelnor.  From the detriorating condition of the once-prosperous
shops, it was clear that things were amiss - just the plae where a
courageous person might seek a worthy quest.

The adventurer hailed a passing citizen.  "Where might I find
information about your person town an land?"

Looking furtively over his shoulder, the man tersely replied, "Ask for
Tholie at the inn," before surrying away.

Sure enough, the adventurer found the town's storyteller sitting at the
back of the smoky, dimly li commonroom.

"Hail," greeted the adventurer, as he took a seat on the rough-hewn
bench.  "I've come to Gelnor toseek my fortune.  Can you tell me the
tales of this land?"

"Why certainly," said the old gnome.  He waited for the adventurer to
buy him a tankard of brew anda meatpie before commencing his tale in a
soft sing-song voice.

"In the beginning, there was a barren vastness filled only with stars
and light, and it was called he Astral Plane.

"Within this vastness, a place was created wherein dwelt Zeus and his
followers.  The magical RiverStyx flowed 'round it all, and it was
called the Olympic Plane.

"Next, the earth and all things on it, living and dead, were created,
and it was called the Materia Pla-"

"I already know the legends of how the world began!" interrupted the
adventurer.  A look of disgustand disbelief made its way across the
youthful face. "I want to know about Gelnor and what's happenig now. 
Are there adventures, fortunes, for the likes of me?"

"Ha!" Tholie briskly retorted.  "Ever heard of the evil ones, called
Black Knights?  There are advetures a-plenty with them, forsooth!"

The adventurer face lit up, and he leaned toward the storyteller. 
"Yes! Tell me about the Black Knghts!"

Tholie continued, "The Isle of Gelnor is divided by a chain of
mountains into two regions.  The wes is the traditional domain of human
and humanoid beings - with a few renegade orcs and lizard men -
edicated to order and goodness; the east is inhabited by more exotic
creatures - dragons, trolls, an giants.  These regions have been waging
war throughout the history of this great land.  Pelnor, thetown we are
in, lies in the northwest corner...."

"Black Knights!  What about the Black Knights?" demanded the
adventurer, interrupting once again.

"Patience!" roared Tholie.  His fist banged the table.  "I'm getting
there!

"Since the Great Invasion by the evil sorcerer Nikademus, the Isle of
Gelnor has been terrorized byhis merciless Black Knight.  (The citizens
of this land hold such fear and enmity for these intruder that it has
even overshadowed their hatred for each other.)

"To maintain their reign of terror, the Black Knights travel from town
to town, demanding sacrifice and homage.  'Though they travel in small
bands, no Gelnorian can yet claim to have defeated one.

"Any unfortunates who are espied by these evil ones must surrender all
their money or die.  Worse sill, the Black Knights may bring the wrath
of the gods upon those who oppose them.  Few are willing o take the
risk."

"Defeating the Black Knights and destroying Nikademus is just the quest
I need to win my fame and frtune," exclaimed the adventurer.  "Where
can I find them?"

"No one knows where Nikademus can be found, but you can start with the
Black Knights.  You're boundto run into them if you travel in Gelnor."

Jumping up, the adventurer turned to leave.  "I shall gather a band of
fellow seekers at the adventrer's Guild forthwith."

"A few words of advice," Tholie called out.  "Whatever your success, it
is rumored the new Black Knghts are spawned in a fortress somewhere in
Gelnor.  Godspeed, and may your sword be swift and the gds be with
you."

MAGIC

Spell Descriptions

Spells fall into three general categories, each with several
subcategories.

Combat Spells - C - can only be used during encounters with monsters. 
They last only for the duratin of combat.  There are two types of
combat spells:

(1) Passive - P - magic always works and, whenever possible,
counteracts any previously cast spells. For example, if an evil wizard
throws a WEAKNESS 4 spell at the party, a STRENGTH 3 spell will cancl
it.  If an additional STRENGTH spell of any kind is cast, it will
cancel the STRENGTH 3 spell.

(2) Active - A - magic's effectiveness depends upon the spellcaster's
magic power and experience levl, as well as the strength of the target.
Active spells may have a cumulative effect.  A second FEA spell, for
example, can cause the victim to be even more afraid (but a second
SLEEP spell will not eepen a trance.)

Non-Combat Spells - N -  are used when no monsters are being
encountered.  There are three types:

(1) Town - T - spells can only be cast in one of Gelnor's towns.
(2) Wilderness - W - magic must be worked in the wilderness.
(3) Dungeon - D - spells can be cast in dungeons.

Everywhere Spells - E - can be cast at any time and in any place.

AWAKEN (#51) rouses all sleeping party members or neutralizes a Sleep
Spell.

BINDING (#29-#32) inhibits the movement of opponents, so those affected
are easier to hit.  These splls are progressive, so Binding 3 is more
powerful than Binding 2 and Binding 1 combined.  They are articularly
effective against flying creatures and monsters that are difficult to
see.

CHARM (#41) makes monsters so friendly, they forget they are in combat.

CONFUSION (#21-#24) makes it difficult for monsters to use their magic.
These spells are progressiv.  Confusion 4 is so effective that its

creatures who have returned from he grave.  They may flee or simply
dissolve.

	Fireflash 4 : 1-100 points of damage

FLAMEBOLT (#37-#40) delivers one bolt of magical flame at each monster
and does damage to its hit ponts (although some of the effect is
absorbed by its armor):
	Flamebolt 1 : 1-7 points of damage
	Flamebolt 2 : 1-15 points of damage
	Flamebolt 3 : 1-31 points of damage
	Flamebolt 4 : 1-66 points of damage

	Mindblast 4 : 1-81 points damage

nearby monsters.  Although i occasionally yields inaccurate results, it
is a good spell to cast immediately upon entering a dungon and at
regular intervals in the wilderness.

superhuman ability.  Although Ninja 1costs more magic points, it is not
as powerful as Ninja 2.

	Quickness 3 : 45% increase
	Quickness 4 : 70% increase

TRANSPORTATION (#54) inter-dimensionally transports the party from one

Scrolls

A secret society has recorded important events concerning the Isle of
Gelnor and its demise.  The 20scrolls have been scattered throughout
the land - some hidden, some left in the care of trusted citiens (many
of whom, unfortunately, have met with foul play).  To the wise and
knowledgeable, their cotents hold the keys to restoring Gelnor to its
former glory.  Scrolls can only be read in towns.

More Treasures

Objects D'art and Other Valuables of vast wealth are said to be hoarded
by the Black Knights and monsters alike - gems, precious minerals, and
glorious works of art - in addition to gold.  One hears of agnificent
sapphires, a golden ring of incredible workmanship, a large gold statue
fashioned after a ox and encrusted with jewels...

Rings and Wands, according to rumors, are described in several scrolls,
and they are significant to he plight of Gelnor.
