The Chiaroscuro

Description: The Chiaroscuro makes his living by scaring people
with the use of intimidation.  They are modeled aafter scaremongers
who you their abilities to strike fear in the hearts ofthose that
oppose them.  The Chiaroscuro cares for no one except himself.
     Their main attributes are strength, charisma, and
intelligence.  In order to become a Chiaroscuro the character needs
at least a 14 in each ability.  A high constitution is also
important.

Role: The Chiaroscuro is a madman, that gets enjoyment out of
torturing people and seeing them summit their wills.  They will
intimidate for fun, or for a price.  The Chiaroscuro can find
jobs as spies, thugs, torturers, and hired hit-men.

Legal Issues: The Chiaroscuro is a bully, or scaremonger.  He uses
his intimidation ability to scare people, but seldom really breaks
the law.  People that get tired of his tactics will react to his
picking on weaker people.  But as for leagal issues, nothing can be
done unless he has broken a law.

Secondary Skills: If your DM is using secondary skills the
character can select any of the following secondary skills:
Groom, Hunter, Leather worker, Trapper/Furrier.  The character
can have any one of the four.

Weapon Proficiencies: Required: Battle axe, dagger, any pole arm,
scourge, any sword, and the whip.  The Chiaroscuro must become
proficient in these weapons before gaining proficiencies in any
other weapon.

Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus proficiencies: Intimidation.
Recommended (General): Animal handling, carpentry, fire-building,
leather working, rope use, singing, stonemasonry; (Rogue):
Endurance, fast-talking, information gathering, observation,
reading lips, and voice mimicry.

Skill Progression:  The Chiaroscuro is highly skilled in the
abilities of Hiding in Shadows, Moving Silently, and Hearing
Noises.  And he is even distributed among the other thief
abilities.

Equipment:  Any device that is large and scary looking will be
purchased by a Chiarscuro.  Some will buy things like spiked
gloves, and supplies to build torture chambers or what trinket they
think could be used to help intimidate someone.  They have
elaborate names engraved on their swords like: Throat Slasher, or
Death Bringer.

Special Benefits: The Chiaroscuro has the nonproficiency of
intimidation.  He recieves a bonus of +1 for this ability which
increases every four levels to a maximum of +4 to his die role.

Special Hindrances: The Chiaroscuro only recieve the bonus if he
has the proficienies of animal handling, information gathering, and
observation.  Reading lips is also recoomended but not necessary.
    The Chiaroscuro must be any evil, and they do not recieve a
10 percent bonus to earned experience.
     While the Chiaroscuro can have any monetary amount of
treasure, they cannot have more treasure than they can carry so a
bag of holding will be very useful.

Races: Any race that enjoys torturing people may become a
Chiaroscuro, but it is only recommended for humans, and half-
elves.  Nonhuman characters are limited to their racial
restrictions of their choosen class.

Notes: The Chiaroscuro needs skill such as carpentry, leather-
working,and stonemasonry to design different types of torture
chambers.  Whatever type of torture the character wishes
to use is left up to the player and the DM.
     The Chiaroscuro usually gets paid to torture someone, but
sometimes it is done just for fun.  In either case the Chiaroscuro
does not care what the person's alignment is.
     This kit is for the thief class.
