     Coiuud you give us a little
better description Predator?  Like
what's south, north, etc.  Is this a
gate to a town or is it the castle were
we are supposed to be crushed(ahemmm!)?
Anyway until I get that info my guy 
(who isn't created yet) will sit down
and pick wildflowers by the side of the
road.

     Seeing how still that Stex is
lying I bark and run over and leak on
his unconcious form.
     Then I see Cronus fighting with
himself (Gee, he's winning too!) so I
start biting at his ankle..
     I think I think that I'm a pit
bull!

As KP begins to worship, I emerge out
of the top of the temple.  Timehopper
has arrived, so the adventure can now
begin.  (once mr. DM rolls me a 
character, that is... I AM GOD.
THEREFORE I MUST BE AT LEAST 2 LEVELS
HIGHER THAN KP, cuz he was worshipping
me.  Keep that in mind.

     I quickly teleport from the Chaos
sub back to here, just long enough to
HUFF AND PUFF AND BLOOOOOWWWWW your
temple in! Then I grab Cronus' ankle
and rip it off.
     Then I quickly teleport to my 
field yelling, "I'm mightier than The
Diplomat so I guess MY character should
be 2 levels above HIM!

(Guess I'll post here since KP seems to
have brought me back from my peaceful
field!)
     Well, FIRST I renew my deoderant
to rid myself of KP's stench.  Then I
walk over to him and take a leak on his
shaved head.
     "MEDITATE ON THAT ASS HOLE!!!!"
     Then I go to have a brief 'god
Meeting' with Diplomat and try and 
strike an alliance with him.


Our slogan: The Gods HATE buddhist 
monks!!!!
(Hey, we're Gods we can beep if we
wanna!)

     OH and THEN I bite off Cronus'
OTHER foot so that he won't be able to
chase me (not that it would even be a 
close race...).  ZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAP!
That last paragraph was just put into
PAST tense so you can't do a thing
about it!!!(this is a Godly power and
only me and Diplomat have it although
we can only use it once a week...gotta
have SOME limitations!)

     DOOM

P.S. I'm beginning to like ripping
off people's sign off's! My current
list of reppee's: Cronus
                  KP
           And now, SLEEPER!!!
Who will be next???


P.S.S. Cronus and KP will STILL be
hearing from my lawyer any day now...

With that refreshing puke in my 
system. I continue to grow to the size
of the planet. first I squash kp
(killing him)  then I go destroy the
whole adventure.  From all those kills,
I gain vast experience and become
all-powerful and undefeatable  The
adventure is now over, and we need a
new subop who will get this damn game
going.=

The soul of Cronus is carried by the solar winds until it reacges the Chaos
Sub, where it posesses the current Cronus-Figure there,

meanwhile Doom's Lawyer reincarnates as a mole on KP's butt.
