This next bit is a selection of comments people have sent in. I've
removed some remarks which were very similar, especially for products
which provoked large quantities of comment and I've done some minor
editing for grammar and spelling. Other than that, this is how they
were sent in.

Boxed Sets and General Comment
------------------------------
I really liked Ravenloft, possibly the best thing about 2nd Edition
even though the domain lords, with the exception of Strahd and Lord
Soth are wimps and barely worth most PCs time. However, if a clever
DM has the guts, they can try and mix the same sort of air that a
well run Call of Cthulhu game can have. Where Ravenloft suffers the
most is perhaps that it falls apart too quickly when the PCs get past
9th or 10th level, most other game worlds are the same, especially
Krynn. This cannot be compensated for as was attempted in in Dark
'Gamma World meets Rifts' Sun, Munchkinism doesn't work in AD&D, most
characters should be retired after 18th to 20th level. Anyways,
Ravenloft works well for PCs between 3rd and 8th level and can make
a good stop over during a larger adventure, say in the Realms or
Krynn. The DM, unless the PCs are aware that the game is going to be
played that way, shouldn't go out of his way to drive the players
mad. On the whole, I give the entire Ravenloft campaign setting a
'7', probably the highest rating I can give any 2nd Edition piece.

Forbidden Lore was wonderful. The dice seemed like a last-minute
add-on, but the rest was superb, especially expanded rules on curses
and Powers checks.

Can't help but be a little disappointed by Castles Forlorn. The
setting itself is well-detailed and very good, but the adventure
hooks just weren't there for me.

In general I like the feeling of Ravenloft, but there is often limits
inherent to TSR's marketing policies that limit its usefulness. The
monsters are were originally well done, but have now become more
cardboard cut-outs of classic gothic horror works.  The Van Richten's
Guide series appear to have some use, but seem like TSR rip-offs of
White Wolf material than anything else.

The modules were good, and the short crypt adventures are pretty
good. But the many world-specific domains (Dark Sun, Spelljammer) are
a little strained. The whole world is better as a series of
encounters than a world in and of itself. I take the best of the
domains and transplant them into "real" campaign worlds (like the
Known World).

I'm looking forward to using this. Full of possibilities, and nice
things to launch on PCs who fall into the dark side of the Force(tm).

Ravenloft was OK, but should not have been another setting. In my
view, this has sharply limited its usefulness, despite a generally
good concept. Not as rich or detailed as other settings. Also, its
lords were either pushovers or sure-fire party killers.

Ravenloft is the only one of the campign settings that I have. It was
rather hard to mark, as the setting was so cool, but the set itself
so poorly put together.

Not bad, but a little vague on world description (too much in too
little space), and perhaps set a little too far forward in science
for my tastes (17th-19th century).

Ravenloft, I think, depends too much on the DM's own ability to
strike terror into his players. The setting is meant to help you with
that kind of stuff, Ravenloft didn't as much as one would want.

I loved to play in Ravenloft as a player, especially on Friday
the 13th...

Supplements
-----------
Use the creatures from MC10 on a foggy night in WaterDeep and watch
the players who memorize monster stats scream :-)

MC 10 has a good mix of monsters, from low-powered monsters to
master vampires. MC 15 is nice for generating adventure ideas from
the monsters, but nothing is so unique a creative DM couldn't have
come up with it.

The plots in RR2 are usable most of the time though the adventures
for the low levels are much better than the ones for the high levels.

A comment on the reason for rating VRGtV a "10": Yeah, I'm the same
guy that gave "10"s to FOR2 and Menzo.  What can I say?  I'm
horribly, horribly biased. I admit it. I love vampires too.

MC10, the obligatory Ravenloft MC, was just kind of there. Most of
the creatures were run-of-the-mill spooky types, or filled in gaps
from the MC system.

MC15, Ravenloft Compendium II, contains some very compelling
characters, and showcased one of Ravenloft's strengths.
Individualizing opponents is one of the primary tools for making them
"better" (read: more disturbing for the players). Although most of
the NPCs are standard monster-types, all of them have a wonderfully
twisted history which makes them much more than "ordinary." A very,
very good work.

Darklords gave needed detail on major lords, as well as other new
lords that were very interesting (Ebonbane, the House on the Hill).
The new lords in this book never made it to the New Edition; grab
this while you can, Ravenloft DMs!

Book of Crypts contains maybe one or two decent adventures; the rest
is of lower quality than I would have expected.

Van Richten's Vampires contains rules for vampires that I now
consider essential, and use even in non-Ravenloft games. As with
MC15, the designers of Ravenloft realized that individualizing the
foe (in this case, so that you aren't sure how to defeat it) makes
for rich horror.

Islands of Terror is another hit-or-miss product, like Book of
Crypts. A couple of the islands show imaginative design, but others
should have been excluded. Not on my list as a can't-live-without RL
product.

Van Richten's Guide to Ghosts seemed hurried to me, but the
information there is valuable all the same. Included here is a system
for codifying all incorporeal undead, while making each unique; I
like it a lot.

Van Richten's Guide to the Lich is another superb VR's Guide. Can't
write enough praise about it. Takes the demi-lich to a whole new
level of power; now it's a foe worthy of the years it takes to become
one. Liches themselves receive such detailed treatment that this one
is a must-have for any campaign featuring a lich as a major opponent.

Werebeasts was very good but suffered slightly from its (necessary)
treatment of different wereforms. All told, though, the information
adds tremendously to the understanding of these creatures.

Van Richten's the Created is achingly good; golems in Ravenloft
receive such detailed treatment that it's impossible to put down.
Ancillary sections on golems other than flesh seemed like add-ons,
but this too was necessary since flesh golems are so much easier to
make (from Van Richten's point of view). Here, finally, is the reason
WHY Adam turned on Dr. Mordenheim, and WHY a golem in Ravenloft is
such an intractable foe.
