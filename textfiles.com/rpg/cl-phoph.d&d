PROPHET
 
A prophet is similar to a cleric in respect to armor and weapons, but he
cannot turn undead.  A prophet's main ability is to foresee the future
accurately.  In order to predict the future, the prophet must meditate for 3
turns, then he will drop into a deep sleep.  He has a base 12% chance to see
the future in his dream, but this is increased 3% for every level (15% at 1st
level, 18% at 2nd). If a prophecy comes to him, he rolls a second pair of
percentile dice to determine clarity.

The die rolls (at 1st level) are as follows:
    01-65  Unclear and not understandable
    66-85  Unclear, semi-understandable
    86-00  Clear and understandable
 
At each level beyond the first, the numbers in each of the first two ranges
shift down by 2 percentile points per level (i.e. at 2nd level, the percentile
ranges are 01-63, 64-81, 82-00).  Once the prophet reaches name level (12th
level), these numbers drop by 4 percentile points per level.  Once the prophet
reaches Oracle level (20th level), they drop by 8 percentile points per level.
A prophet cannot advance beyond 21st level.
 
No matter whether the prophet reaches a prophecy or not, the prophet loses
one point of constitution and 1-8 hit points (due to the strain of invoking the
forces involved in accurately predicting the future).  This loss of hit points
is the reason why the prophet begins with two hit dice at 1st level.  If the
loss of constitution results in a drop below the required ability score, the
prophet loses control over his power and prophecies will come to him that will
have nothing to do with him or his party.  If he does not regain the
constitution back within one week, he will become catatonic and will rest until
he gains back the constitution to the required constitution ability score.
After a prophecy, to regain the constitution points he lost, he must have 4
hours of completely uninterrupted sleep per point lost.  The hit points may be
regained by the normal means.
 
In addition, the prophet regenerates 1 point/3 levels every 5 rounds (due to
the fact that he is constantly losing hit points, he has attained a certain
resiliency to wounds other than those caused by prophecy).

The restrictions on the prophet are as follows:
 Ability scores: Intelligence - 17
                 Wisdom   - 18
                 Constitution - 15
