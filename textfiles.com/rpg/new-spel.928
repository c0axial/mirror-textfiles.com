                         NEW SPELLS


Awaken (Evocation)                 Author:  August Neverman

Level:  1                          Components: V,S,M
Range:  1' per level               Casting Time:  20 minutes
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  see below
Area of Effect:  specific location

     This spell will wake a character (or characters) to full
alertness instantaneously.  It can be set to trigger on a specific
action such as a word or action.  The primary component is a horn
(which can be reused).  Each being that may be awakened must be named
in the spell when cast.


Glow (Alteration)                  Author:  August Neverman

Level:  1                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  1' per level               Casting Time:  5
Duration:  1 hour per level        Saving Throw:  see below
Area of Effect:  One Creature

     This spell causes the object or person affected to emit an eery
glow.  The color ranges from blue to green.  It cannot be dispelled
but it can be negated by a darkness spell.  Saving throw is 5% per
level of the victim (or hit dice) minus the level of the caster.  The
glow is not bright enough to read with but is easy to spot in the
dark.  The material component is a firefly.


History  (Divination)              Author:  Jim Gitzlaff

Level:  1                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  touch                      Casting Time:  1 turn
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  one object or place (max 1000 sq feet)

     This spell allows the caster to "tune in" to the psychic
impressions left on an object or small area.  The power gives the
wizard the ability to divine special purposes, famous owners, and
powerful alignment bends.
     The spell will not identify a magic item per se, but would
identify the signet ring of a long deceased noble house as such.
Furthermore, history doubles the chance of a rare or unknown items
value being determined.
     This spell is most commonly used on nonmagical plunder, books,
and items sold at auctions.  Only a single touch is needed to make the
spell work.

Inaudibility  (Illusion/Phantasm)  Author:  Thom Watson

Level:  1                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  Touch                      Casting Time:  1
Duration:  1 hour/level            Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  Creature Touched

     By means of this spell, all sounds made by the recipient become
inaudible -- breathing, talking, walking, and the like.  Items on the
caster's person are likewise silenced, but thrown or dropped items may
make noise once released.  While under the effect of this spell, the
caster cannot cast any spell with a verbal component.  Unlike a
silence spell, inaudibility masks only the sounds made by the
recipient or items in his/her possession, so it provides no defense
against sound-based attacks such as harpy singing, a horn of blasting,
etc.  The spell remains in effect until it is magically dispelled,
until the caster or the recipient cancels it, or until its duration
has passed; it is not dispelled by the recipient attacking another
creature.  The material component is a small wad of cotton.


Anvil Fall  (Alteration)           Author:  Thom Watson

Level:  2                          Components:  V
Range:  10 yards/level             Casting Time:  1
Duration:  1 round/level           Saving Throw:  Neg.
Area of Effect:  Special

     When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected
immediately assume the mass of solid lead.  A falling or flying object
or creature affected starts to plummet, and damage taken from falling
is doubled, i.e., 2d6 per 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d6 from
a
height of 100 feet.  The anvil fall affects one or more objects or
creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the maximum original weight
of
the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of 200
pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster.
     A feather fall cast upon a creature or object under the influence
of an anvil fall will only negate the latter, and the creature then
receives only normal falling damage.  An additional feather fall would
then be needed to achieve the normal effect of that spell, and two
such spells could probably not be cast in time by a single caster.
     Like a feather fall, an anvil fall works only upon free-falling,
flying, or propelled objects, and cannot affect a sword blow or a
charging creature.


Disposal  (Evocation, Alteration)  Author:  Thom Watson

Level:  2                          Components:  V,S
Range:  0                          Casting Time:  2
Duration:  1 day/level             Saving Throw:  special
Area of Effect:  12" circle

     The casting of this spell evokes a hole, 12" in diameter, in the
caster's hand.  The hole may be placed on any surface; anything
subsequently dropped into it (an item must be smaller than the hole's
diameter; since this is neither an extra-dimensional space nor a
sphere of annihilation, items larger than that are not "sucked" into
it) vanishes and is teleported to the bottom of the nearest sewage
system (moat, sewer, large body of water, etc.).  It is especially
effective for disposing of garbage, kitchen waste, body wastes, etc.,
and may be used in the garderobe of an area otherwise devoid of
plumbing.  Magical and living items (of at least animal intelligence;
normal insects and non-sentient plant life are therefore not
considered "living" for this purpose) receive a saving throw to resist
the teleportation.  (There was no plumbing in Kestrel's tower, hence
this spell saves on traipsing up and down all those stairs with a
chamberpot).


Fog Phantom  (Conjuration/Summoning)
                                   Author:  August Neverman
Level:  2                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  50' + 2' per level         Casting Time:  3
Duration:  1 turn/level            Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  1"/level

     This spell creates a vaguely human shaped pillar of fog.  The fog
phantom can do no damage, however it can be controlled remotely by the
caster.  The Phantom moves at 1" + 1"/level of the caster.  The magic
user can "see" and "hear" through the Fog Phantom.  This spell
requires complete concentration, disturbances will cause the
termination of the spell before the end of its duration.  The Fog
Phantom cannot pass through cracks or the like; also strong winds,
intense heat or cold will cause the Fog Phantom to disintegrate.


Gold to Gems  (Alteration)         Author:  Thom Watson
(reversible)
Level:  2                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  Touch                      Casting Time:  1 round
Duration:  Permanent               Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  200 gp/level

     By means of this spell, the caster converts a number of gold
pieces, minus some random percentage, into a single gem of equal
value.  The caster places the gold pieces in the left pan of an
ordinary balance, speaks a command word, and the coins vanish.  A
single gem appears in the right pan, equal in value to the amount of
coins minus 1d10%.  This extra amount is the material component.  The
caster can convert up to 200 gold pieces per level per use of the
spell.  Thus, a 5th-level caster could convert up to 1000 gold pieces
into a single gem.
     The reverse of the spell, gems to gold, converts a single gem
(subject to level limits), placed in the right pan of the balance,
into gold coins of equal worth, minus 1d10% of the value of the gem.
If too many coins, or a gem of greater value than the caster can
convert at his/her current level, are placed on the balance, the spell
is lost but nothing is expended materially.  The type of gem obtained
cannot be specified by the wizard.

Kestrel's Voice of the Bat  (Alteration)
                                   Author:  Thom Watson
Level:  2                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  0                          Casting Time:  3
Duration:  1 turn + 1 rnd/level    Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  caster

     This spell grants the caster the ability to use sonar to "see"
and move safely at a normal rate in the dark, even in magical
darkness.  The caster can tell size and general shape of objects up
to
10 yards away in any direction s/he faces.  The caster must actively
concentrate to "see" her/his surroundings, but merely ceasing
concentration does not end the spell, and the caster may resume the
sonar again within the spell's duration.  The material component is
a
bit of bat guano.


Magic Eye (Alteration)             Author:  August Neverman

Level:  2                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  touch/special              Casting Time:  20 minutes
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  see below
Area of Effect:  specific location

     By means of this spell the caster, creates a "third eye" much
like the spell wizard eye except that it remains in a specific
location once cast.  It can be triggered in two ways, one is a
"predefined" event occurring, such as some creature passing in front
of it.  The second can be done from anywhere on the same plane, by
willing it to activate.  Once activated the eye lasts 2 rounds per
level and may again be deactivated (each activation uses at a minimum
of 2 rounds).  The "eye" sees as well as the caster, if caster can see
normally invisible so can the eye, magic enhancements do not work
through the Magic Eye, such as spectacles or detect invisible.


PhotoCopy  (Evocation)             Author:  Thom Watson

Level:  2                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  Sight                      Casting Time:  2
Duration:  Instantaneous           Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  Special

     This spell, a variation of the 1st-level copy spell, allows the
caster to create a permanent image, on a piece of parchment, canvas,
or the like, of whatever s/he sees and concentrates upon at the time
of casting, to the range of her/his vision.  Detail in the final
picture depends on distance, field of vision, and leve
For every level of the caster, s/he may choose that the final image
will appear on the parchment as if s/he were 10 yards closer to the
subject; e.g., the picture created by a 5th-level wizard standing 60
yards away from a creature could contain detail s/he would normally
notice at a distance of 10 yards.
     Material components are a piece of parchment, paper or canvas --
which is not expended and upon which the image appears--and a silver
coin and a pinch of salt (which are expended).

Runetrue (Invocation, Abjuration)  Author:  Jim Gitzlaff

Level:  2                          Components:  V,M
Range:  special                    Casting Time:  5 rounds
Duration:  1 turn/level            Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  special

     This is a spell that allows wizards to infuse the magical symbols
they draw (see below) with the power needed to repel
summoned/extraplanar creatures.  The maximum hit die creature that
may
be fenced in/out is equal to the caster's level plus four.
     Note:  As the above implies, it is possible to fence out
summoned/extraplanar creatures of less than 4 hit dice by using the
symbols without the runetrue spell.
     The only symbols that this spell empowers are listed below:

          Symbol:                     Protects From:

          pentacle                    Demons, demodands
          pentagram                   Devils, daemons
          magic circle                Spirits of Good
          magic (protection) circle   Undead
          thaumaturgic circle         Spirits of Nature and Neutrality
          thaumaturgic triangle       Elementals

     The wizard must still create the symbol manually, using anything
from a stick to gold inlay.


Waterproof  (Alteration)           Author:  Thom Watson

Level:  2                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  Touch                      Casting Time:  1
Duration:  1 hour + 1 turn/level   Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  Creature Touched

     This spell creates an invisibly thin membrane around the
recipient and any objects in his/her possession, through which water
may not pass, except at the mouth (water breathing, for example, is
not hindered if it is in effect, but it is not otherwise provided by
this spell). Its purpose is to protect and keep dry objects that could
otherwise be damaged or destroyed by water (e.g., spellbooks, torches,
tinderboxes, etc.), since precipitation merely beads and rolls off the
recipient and bodies of water do not penetrate the barrier. The spell
does not confer any special abilities to survive or breathe
underwater, but it will keep the caster and his/her possessions dry
while there.
     If used against a creature native to the Elemental Plane of
Water, the spell inflicts 1d4 points of damage on a successful attack
oll.
     The caster may affect an additional man-sized creature for every
extra level of experience. The material component of the spell is a
duck feather or a small square of oilcloth.

Chime  (Alteration)                Author:  Jim Gitzlaff

Level:  3                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  30 feet                    Casting Time:  1 round
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  one object

     This spell enchants an object such that, when a condition is met
(specified as in magic mouth), a reasonably loud chime/bong/ring will
sound from the item.  This chime is loud enough to wake a nearby
sleeper or be heard from a nearby room.  This behavior will continue,
functioning at most once per round, until the condition ceases, the
item is destroyed, or the dweomer dispelled.


Leap  (Alteration)                 Author:  August Neverman

Level:  3                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  Touch                      Casting Time:  1 segment
Duration:  Special                 Saving Throw:  N/A
Area of Effect:  Touched creature

     When this spell is cast the individual is empowered with the
ability to leap.  The distance the individual is able to leap is a
total of 20'/Level forward, backward or straight up.  Up to the number
(of levels of the caster) jumps can be made, the total of which cannot
exceed the above totals.  Also at the end of the leap the individual
will always land without falling damage.  Leaps must be completed
within 1 turn plus 1 turn/level after the spell is cast.
     An example: 7th level caster, individual affected can jump up to
a total of 140' in up to a total of seven jumps (i.e. 7x 20' jumps).


Telepathic Familiar  (Divination)  Author:  Thom Watson

Level:  3                          Components:  V,S
Range:  1 mile + 1 mile/2 levels   Casting Time:  1 round
Duration:  1 hour/level            Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  1 familiar

     This spell enables the caster and his/her familiar to communicate
mind-to-mind as though they were speaking with each other.  It
provides for greater understanding and depth of communication than is
enabled by the empathic link automatically conferred by the find
familiar spell.  If the caster and his familiar become separated by
a
distance greater than that allowed while the spell duration is still
in effect, the spell does not wink out but begins functioning again
if
the distance is closed.


Tomelore  (Divination)             Author:  Jim Gitzlaff
(reversible)
Level:  3                          Components:  V,M
Range:  touch                      Casting Time:  15 rounds
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  one book

     With tomelore, the caster knows whether a text is cursed, what
language it is in, its author, and other general information about its
contents.  Nothing specific about its safeguards, contents, or history
will be revealed, though.
     The reverse of this spell, Tomelie, makes all of the above
information seem to be other than it is when determined using
divinatory spells.  It lasts for one month unless dispelled.


Advanced Magic Mouth (Alteration)  Author:  Jim Gitzlaff

Level:  4                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  10'                        Casting Time:  4
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  one object

     This spell is identical to magic mouth except in that the maximum
activation range is only 10' and that it will continue to function as
instructed, over and over, until the object is destroyed or the
dweomer dispelled.


Delusion (Alteration, Phantasm)    Author:  August Neverman

Level:  4                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  1' per level               Casting Time:  20 minutes
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  see below
Area of Effect:  specific location

     This spell causes the affected character to be deluded into
thinking that one or more of his statistics or powers has been
modified (positive or negative).


Dheryth's Monomorph  (Alteration)  Author:  Jim Gitzlaff

Level:  4                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  0                          Casting Time:  4
Duration:  1 day per 3 levels of experience
Area of Effect:  The caster only   Saving Throw:  none

     This spell was designed to allow a wizard to look like something
s/he does not for an extended period of time.  It grants the
nonmagical locomotive powers, senses, and metabolic processes of the
race of creature whose form is taken.  However, a significant part of
the spell is dependent on the specific creature whose shape the caster
wishes to assume.  Thus, only ONE shape may be taken on by the caster
using this spell -- ever.
     When this spell is found (for instance, on a scroll or in another
person's spell book), it already was custom designed by some other
wizard to adopt a certain form (race, height, weight, hair color,
etc.), and nothing the finder can do will make it do otherwise.  This
is because the choice of creature vastly changes the structure of the
Monomorph, and thus the choice of shape may only be made when
researching the spell from the ground up.
     When this spell is independently researched by a wizard, s/he
gets to decide the specifics of the form the spell grants.

     If any wizard wants to "change" an existing Monomorph so that a
different shape can be assumed, s/he must head into a library and
research this change as if it were an entirely new spell.  The costs
for this, though, are at -25% because the wizard has a copy of the
other form of Monomorph as a model.  There is no reason why a wizard
with enough time and money could not possess several "versions" of
this spell.
     When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form
of
a single bipedal humanoid (human, demihuman, faerie, goblin, etc.)
with which race the caster is familiar, but not any quadruped (e.g.
centaur), wholly magical being (e.g. golem, demon), or other creature
not relevantly humanoid.  The wizard assumes the shape of one such
creature upon casting the spell, and retains that shape until the
spell ceases to function.  S/he may cancel the spell before it would
normally elapse, but may not alternate between the Monomorphed and
regular f
     Monomorph will allow changes as follows:

     CASTER     WEIGHT
     LEVEL:    MIN: MAX:      RACES:              AGE:
      7-8      -10% +10%      same as caster      no change
      9-11     -20% +25%      any known           +/-10%
     12-13     -30% +50%      any known           +/-20%
     14-15     -50% +80%      any known           +/-40%
     16-17     -70% +125%     any known           +/-60%
      18+      -90% +200%     any known           any

     The color of eyes, skin, and hair can be changed to any possible
value, as can hair length, sex, and other details.
     The body whose shape is assumed has the same physical statistics
as the caster, subject to all racial and age modifiers, minimums, and
maximums (of the form adopted, of course).  The new form will not
radiate magic, but it may be dispelled.


Fog Warrior (Conjuration/Evocation)
                                   Author:  August Neverman
Level:  4                          Components: V,S,M
Range:  30" + 1"/level             Casting Time:  1 round
Duration:  1 turn + 1 round/level  Saving Throw:  N/A
Area of Effect:  see below

     This spell creates a creature much the same in appearance of the
spell "Fog Phantom".  This creature can, however, do damage (ranging
from 1 to the level of caster in hit points of damage).  It can has
a
strength equal to the level of the caster; and has an armor class of
2 and can be hit only by weapons +1 or greater.  It has 10hp
+1 hp/level of the caster and cannot be dispelled by wind or fire,
although fire and ice will do damage to it.


Cantrip Permanency (All Schools)   Author:  Jim Gitzlaff

Level:  5                          Components: V,S,M
Range:  touch                      Casting Time:  1 hour
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  one object

     Unlike the 8th level spell permanency, Cantrip Permanency must
be
cast on an object to be effective.  The object must be appropriate to
the cantrip -- e.g. a cloth for Polish, a paintbrush for Color, a salt
cellar for Salt.  When complete, the duration of the cantrip (or the
number of times it may be invoked) is increased dramatically.
     There are two ways the spell may be used.

     Method 1: i)  [Cantrip spell]
               ii)  Cantrip Permanency

     Method 2: i)  Enchant an Item
               ii)  [Cantrip spell]
               iii)  Cantrip Permanency

     If method 1 is used, the duration of the cantrip is increased to
5-12 months (1d8 + 4).  In the second case, the cantrip is completely
permanent.
     If the cantrip is one that does not have a duration per se (e.g.
Exterminate, Polish, Clean), then the power of the cantrip may be

Dheryth's Stone Integrity  (Abjuration)
(reversible)                       Author:  Jim Gitzlaff
Level:  5                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  10 yards/level             Casting Time:  1 turn
Duration:  1 year                  Saving Throw:  None
Area of Effect:  20 ft cube/level

     This spell, cast upon a volume of rock, prevents the correct
operation of the Transmute Rock to Mud spell in the following way:

     1.   If the caster of Stone Integrity is a higher level than the
          caster of Transmute Rock to Mud, the latter spell
          automatically fails.
     2.   If the caster of Transmute Rock to Mud is a level equal to
          or higher than the caster of Stone Integrity, the former
          spell has a chance of correctly operating equal to 10% plus
          10% per level that the former caster is higher than the
          latter.  Furthermore, the area of effect of Transmute Rock
          to Mud, if it works, is reduced in area of effect to a
          percentage equal to its chance of working.  In other words,
          if the spell had only a 30% chance to work (and does), its
          area of effect is only 30% of normal.
     The spell grants no other immunities to the stone and may be
dispelled.
     The "reverse" of Stone Integrity is actually Earth Integrity, and
prevents the operation of the Transmute Mud to Rock spell in like
manner as above.


Kestrel's Skill Eraser  (Necromancy)
                                   Author:  Thom Watson
Level:  5                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  Touch                      Casting Time:  5
Duration:  Special                 Saving Throw:  Neg.
Area of Effect:  Person touched

     This spell completely removes a single weapon or non-weapon
proficiency slot from a character.  The character thus affected
forgets any knowledge about and loses any abilities granted by that
particular proficiency, and may elect either to relearn that
proficiency or to learn a new one.  This learning process, however,
takes the remainder of that character's present level; i.e., she will
basically gain a proficiency slot when she attains her next level.
Each application of this spell only affects a single proficiency slot;
e.g., if a character had specialized in a weapon, the first use of the
spell would erase the benefits of specialization but not proficiency,
and another use of the spell could then be used to erase the
proficiency.  Similarly, a proficiency requiring two slots (i.e.,
healing) would only be reduced to half its normal ability check
through a single use of this spell.
     Use of this spell on an unwilling recipient requires a successful
to-hit roll, and the subject still receives a saving throw vs. the
spell.  A clerical restoration spell or a wish can restore the lost
proficiency slot immediately.
     The material component is a leaf from a rubber plant, which is
rubbed on the person to be affected.


Dheryth's Energy Cloak  (Abjuration, Evocation)
                              Author:  Jim Gitzlaff
Level:  6                     Components:  V,S,M
Range:  0                     Casting Time:  1 round
Duration:  2 rounds/level     Saving Throw:  None
Area of Effect:  The caster only

     This spell makes the caster seem to be inside a varicolored,
shifting aura of light.  He is totally immune to all spells and powers
utilizing pure energy (eg. Energy Lance, Xag-ya, laser) and has a
magic resistance of 40% + 1% per level of the caster versus force
spells (eg. Wall of Force, Bigby's...Hand).  Unfortunately, if the
force spell is above the 4th level, the Energy Cloak is negated if the
resistance roll is made.
     Damage from all other sources of positive energy (eg. fire and
electricity) is reduced by one point per level of the caster per
round, up to a maximum of 5 times the caster's level in protected
points.
     Any successful attack by a source of negative energy has the
following effects:
     1.   Both the attack and the Energy Cloak are negated.
     2.   Both the attacker and the mage take 3-30 points of damage
          (no save, magic resistance, or other protection).
          The attacker is only damaged this way if the negative attack
          was by touch (of body, wand, or melee weapon).  Otherwise,
          see #3, below.
     3.   Everyone around each figure takes 3-30 points of damage
          minus 1 point per foot of distance between them and the
          wearer of the Cloak.

Dheryth's Energy Globe  (Evocation, Alteration)
                              Author:  Jim Gitzlaff
Level:  6                     Components:  V,S,M
Range:  touch                 Casting Time:  3 segments
Duration:  1 segment          Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  see below

     This spell requires a gem worth at least 50 gp each time it is
cast.  The gem's center becomes a minute gate to the positive material
plane, and the energies thus released slowly eat away at the gem from
the inside out.  When the duration expires or the gem is broken, the
gem explodes into a sphere of pure energy.
     Damage is as follows:    (range: S=1", M=2", L=3")

          Hit by gem or within 2':      3 points/level of mage
          2'-5.9':                      2 points/level of mage
          6'-10':                       1 point/level of mage

     If the gem is thrown against something, it must save as ceramic
versus normal or crushing blow, depending on what it is it hit.


Dheryth's Energy Lance  (Evocation)
                                   Author:  Jim Gitzlaff
Level:  6                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  10' + 1'/level             Casting Time:  5 segments
Duration:  instantaneous           Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  1 creature or object

     Note that the casting time is 5 segments, and not just an
initiative modifier of 5.
     This spell causes a gem-tipped wand (see material components,
below) to spew out a directional beam of intense positive energy at
a
single object or creature.  Damage is equal to 1-6 points of
damage/level of the caster, with no save allowed.  The maximum number
of dice which may be rolled are 14.  Additionally, if made the sole
target of the spell, object
will have a 6 inch diameter hole drilled through up to the maximum
range of the spell or out the back of the object.  Magical objects
must save versus disintigrate at +1 or suffer the same fate.
     Material components:  A 6-8 inch platinum wand (1000 gp value)
with a clear diamond or any opal (worth at least 100 gp in any case)
set on the end.  A loose 100 gp value gem is also needed - it will be
consumed during casting.  There is a 10% chance that the gem on the
end of the wand will shatter as well, reduced to 5% for a 1000 gp
value gem and to a minimum of 1% for a 10,000 gp value gem.


Dheryth's Spell Support  (Abjuration)
                                   Author:  Jim Gitzlaff
Level:  6                          Components:  special + V,S
Range:  special                    Casting Time:  special
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  special

     This spell is cast at the same time as any other spell which has
a duration (there are some exceptions -- see below).  It doubles the
casting time of the other spell and adds verbal and somatic components
of its own.  The effect of spell support is to make the other spell
totally immune to dispel magic for its normal duration.  The spell
support itself is not dispellable, and if it is cast in conjunction
with permanency, the net effect is to make the other spell both
permanent and undispellable.
     Certain spells may not be supported:
          1.  Anything wish or limited wish related
          2.  Prismatic wall and prismatic sphere
          3.  Otiluke's resilient and telekinetic spheres
          4.  Forcecage and forcecube
          5.  Anything gate related
          6.  Magic jar
          7.  Temporal stasis
     Spell support in no way reduces the efficacy of Mordenkainen's
Disjunction, nor does a single casting protect any additional spells
that may be active in the same space.
     On permanency, there is a 10% chance per year that the spell
support will fail, leaving the permanency intact but unsupported.


Dheryth's Energy Net  (Evocation)  Author:  Jim Gitzlaff

Level:  7                          Components:  V,S
Range:  10' + 1'/level             Casting Time:  3 segemnts
Duration:  instantaneous           Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  1 creature

     Note that the casting time of this spell is 3 segments, not just
an initiative modifier of 3.
     When this spell is cast, the mage spreads apart his hands, and
a
brilliant "net" of positive energies streaks forth to engulf the
target.  Damage is equal to 2-7 points per level of the caster, with
no save allowed.  Furthermore, the target is stunned for 1-6 segments.
The maximum number of dice is 16.


Cantor's Closed Cottage  (Alteration, Conjuration)
                                   Author:  Jim Sisolak
Level:  8                          Components:  V,S
Range:  special                    Casting Time:  8 rounds

Area of Effect:  special

     This spell creates an extradimensional space -- an improved form
of Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion.  It literally duplicates a
small, closed section of the caster's plane, creating a temporary new
demiplane.  The area of effect is a base 1 square kilometer per level
of the caster.  The duration is a base 2 hours per level, modified as
below:
     Each 1 square kilometer added to the base amount lessens the
          duration of the spell by 2 hours.
     Each 1 square kilometer subtracted from the area of effect
          increases the duration by 3 hours.
The caster can modify the terrain/plant features to a limited extent
when closing off the area.  The land, animals, structures, etc are
duplicated in the new planar space with the following restrictions:

     No magic items or magically protected structures are duplicated.
     Creatures of intelligence >2 are not duplicated.


Dheryth's Sanctum Sanctorum  (Abjuration)

Level:  8                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  10 yards                   Casting Time:  1 hour
Duration:  permanent               Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  27,000 cubic feet

     This spell seals an interior area (e.g. building, room, cave)
with a volume up to 27,000 cubic feet off from entry by teleportation
(including teleport, teleport without error, dimension door, and even
Drawmij's instant summons and succor) plane shifting (including color
pools, border ethereal penetration, and plane shift), and similar
magical effects.
     Any of these may be performed iff a password is known and spoken
during the attempted entrance.  There can only be one password at a
time, but it mat be changed by recasting sanctum sanctorum.


Elemental Gate  (Conjuration)      Author:  Jim Gitzlaff

Level:  8                          Components:  V,S,M
Range:  50 feet                    Casting Time:  1 hour
Duration:  special                 Saving Throw:  none
Area of Effect:  1 square foot/level

     This spell creates a small gate from an elemental plane.  It
allows the free passage of objects and creatures from the elemental
plane to the prime material only, and not the other way around.  If
the gate is free standing, it will only last for 2 turns + 1 round per
level of the caster.  It may be supported, though, by an ornate frame
that will make it last exactly as long as the frame itself.
     Air:      Silver frame
     Fire:     Brass frame
     Water:    Gold/Gilt frame
Also needed as a material component of the type of material the caster
wants the gate to open into.  For instance, if the mage wants salt
water to spew out of the gate, he needs to cast the water version with
a sample of saltwater.  This works similarly with the other planes --
air of the appropriate freshness, temperature, etc must exist as a
ample.
     The most common uses of this spell are listed below:
     Air:  May be used to ventilate rooms, provide breathable air, and
          maintain average temperatures.
     Fire:  Often used to heat places in cold climates or serve as the
          heart of a forge.
     Water:  Usually created to provide large quantities of fresh,
          drinkable water.
     If the supporting frame is magicked with a protection from
evil/good 10' radius or similar spell, the vast majority of elemental
creatures that might stumble across the gate will be unable to pass
through.

Acid Hands (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the first level mage spell burning hands
(q.v.), except that the caster's hands eject a corrosive acid. Damage
is one hit point per level of the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Acid Stream (Conjuration)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One target
Saving Throw: Special

The spell causes a thin stream of purplish, hissing acid to shoot forth
from the caster's outstretched hand, out to the maximum range of the
spell.  This acid causes 1d4 damage per level of the caster, up to a
maximum of 8d4.  The intended target may attempt a save vs.
petrification to dodge the jet of acid (save at -4 if size G, -2 if
size H, -1 if size L, +1 if size S, and +3 if size T), and if
successful the jet of acid will have been avoided, and will continue on
in a straight line out to the extent of its range.  Any creature in the
path of the acid must save as above or be struck by the spell.  The
Acid Stream can affect only one target in any event.  The material
component is a drop of any acid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Electric Arc (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes an arc of electricity to leap from the caster's
extended fingertip.  This electricity unerringly strikes one target of
the caster's choice, inflicting 1d4 damage, plus one point per level of
the caster (up to a maximum of +12), with no saving throw.  A target in
metal armour or wielding a large, mostly metallic weapon (e.g. any
sword, battle axe) must save vs. spells and, if the save is failed, the
bonus (i.e. per level) damage inflicted by the spell is doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Hunting Hound (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 10 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 12 turns + 6 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell calls a canine creature to be a helper and boon companion to
the spell caster for the duration of the spell.  The type of hound
summoned depends upon the caster's level, but the hound will always
understand verbal commands given it, so long as they are 12 words or
less and relatively simple.  The hound will further also be capable of
tracking as if a ranger of half the level of the summoner, and can hunt
sufficiently well to feed the spell-caster for one day, provided there
is game extant in the caster's area.

The type of hound summoned is as follows:

 1st -  3rd level: jackal
 4th -  7th level: wild dog
 8th - 12th level: wolf
13th +      level: dire wolf

If the caster takes a lower-level hound (or a dire wolf when 18th
level), it will have maximum hit points, be +1 to hit and on damage,
track at +1 level, and can understand even relatively complex commands
of up to 50 words in length.  The material component is a piece of
fresh meat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Sparkle Beam (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1' x 20' x 5' cone
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws upon the power of the Positive Material Plane and
calls forth a ray of golden light.  Anyone in the area of effect of the
spell must save vs. petrification or be blinded for 1 round.  The true
function of this spell, however, is its use against undead, creatures
of the Lower Planes, and those drawing power from the Negative Material
Plane or the Plane of Shadow.  Such creatures suffer 1d4 damage, plus
an additional 1d4 at every even level of the caster (e.g. 4d4 at 8th),
up to a maximum of 8d4.  These creatures may save vs. spells to halve
this damage.  The material component is a bit of crushed sunstone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starlight (Evocation, Illusion)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' square area per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell illuminates an area as a cloudless outdoor night sky filled
with stars.  This light is pale and wan, and dilutes vision mostly to
black and white.  Full visual acuity is possible only out to a range of
10 yards, but general identification can be made out to 20 yards.

Stationary figures can be made out at 40 yards, and movement detected
out to 80 yards.  Intervening cover will, of course, reduce sighting
distances accordingly.  This light does not interfere with infravision,
and there are ample shadows within the area of effect to hide in.  The
illusionary component of the spell creates the appearance of an actual
starry night sky.  The area of effect is stationary.  The material
component is a piece of black velvet and a few bits of glass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Wall of Darkness (Alteration)

Range: 60 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10' x 10' square per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings into being a wall of blackness which cannot
be seen through, even with infravision or ultravision.  It is dispelled
instantly by a light or continual light (q.v.) spell.  It has no physical
existence, and does not hinder nor harm those passing through it.  It
does, however, block the passage of sound from one side to the other,
assuming that the spell is not cast in such a way (such as in a field
of grass) which would otherwise allow sound to move around the edges of
the wall.  The material component is some pitch and soot, or a lump of
coal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Association (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Two surfaces
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell, the forensic wizard must brings two surfaces
into contact with one another. Possibilities include the surface of a
jewel and that of a safe, or the surface of an arrow and that of a
bow. If the two surfaces were ever before adjacent, the spell so
indicates, and if the surfaces were ever directly connected as a single
item, an even stronger reading results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cat Spirit (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: SM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

The cat form spell grants many of the abilities traditionally
associated with cats, though it does not significantly alter the
features of the recipient. The spell grants a +2 bonus to stealth, as
the recipient's tread will be absolutely quiet for the duration. The
spell also halves all damage taken from falls and allows the recipient
to land on his or her feet. Finally, it grants the ability to grow
claws, allowing each hand to do 1d3 damage. It does not, however,
improve singing ability. The material component is whiskers from a
cat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Poison (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the forensic wizard can determine if a corpse has been
poisoned. One corpse can be checked each round. The wizard can
determine the means by which the poison was administered and the place
at which it entered the body, and he has a 5% chance per level of being
able to exactly identify the poison.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electric Blades (Evocation)

Range: 
Components: VM
Duration: 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This spell must be cast with a metal blade of some sort in each hand.
Both blades then acquire a flickering blue glow.  When a hit by either
blade is scored it causes 1-4 more points of damage of electricity. If
both blades hit the same target in the same round the victim must save
versus petrification or be stunned for one round. Each blade only
shocks once and then is normal again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find Water (Divination)

Range: 1 mile, depth 10 feet per level
Components: SM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 20 times arc
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell, the diviner grasps two ends of a Y-shaped
twig. The remaining end twists around to point in the direction of the
nearest source of fresh water within the spell range. The branch can
twist but twenty degrees, and then the diviner will feel a tug in the
direction of the water. The diviner can specify a minimum amount of
water to seek (greater than the amount in a human body, for example).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flash (Evocation)

Range: 12"
Components: V
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Victims failing their saving throw are blinded for the next round due
to a flash of light that appears in their eyes. All to-hit rolls for
the next two rounds are made at -2 due to spots in their eyes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frost Hands (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the first level mage spell burning hands
(q.v.), except that ice is eje
of the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frost Touch (Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: VS
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell delivers 1d6 points of damage. In addition to this, you add
1 point of damage for every level above first. Cold based creatures are
immune to this, and fire based creatures take double damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guilda's Treacherous Tripwire (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 minute per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 tripwire
Saving Throw: Negates

One wire (up to 10' long) can be stretched across a hall, or such.  The
wire becomes camouflaged--undetectable w/o find traps.  The first
creature tO attempt to pass must save vs. wands (add dexterity
defensive adjustment) or be caught when the wire springs free.  The
wire will twine tightly about the ankles of its victim, tripping him.
It must then be tediously untangled (or sawed loose) which will take at
least 30 seconds under ideal conditions.  If hacked loose in combat, it
will take 1 round, and the victim will take 1d4 damage unless an
enchanted blade is used (which will cut without effort).  Note that the
wire is required, but not consumed. The material component is a small
spring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Torch (Evocation)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This spell causes the caster and all his clothing to become engulfed in
flames. These flames do not harm the caster or his equipment but cause
1d4 points of damage to anyone within 5' and an additional 1d6 to
anyone who actually touches him. The flames themselves are only about
as hot as a torch but the surrounding area will feel like a blast
furnace.

Inaudibility (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell completely masks all sounds made by the recipient: bodily
functions such as breathing and sleeping as well as sounds made by
striking another object (walking, for example). Any object held by the
recipient is likewise silenced. Objects thrown, dropped, or knocked
over by the recipient are not under the effect of the spell, however,
and these may make noise at the ends of their trajectories. An
unwilling victim receives a saving throw against this spell. The
material component is a bit of cotton.

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

When the forensic wizard casts this spell, he sees whatever the
recipient corpse saw at the very instant of death, with the intent of
learning the identity of the murderer, or at least the location of
death. If the recipient was killed by a gaze attack, the wizard suffers
this attack as well, but with a +4 bonus to his saving throw.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The caster of this spell can check one weapon per round to determine if
it was used to kill a specific corpse, of whom he has a blood sample. A
"murder weapon" is one which reduced the victim to zero hit points, or
delivered the poison which did so.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Painting (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 12"
Components: V
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 2"
Saving Throw: Negates

By the means of this spell the caster can create an illusion of
whatever he wants, as long as he concentrates and the illusion remains
in the area of effect. It is usually easy to recognise what the
illusion is supposed to be of, but any creature that can do so can also
recognise that it is an illusion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Chaos (Abjuration) Reversible

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to protection from evil (q.v.) except in its
purpose and intent; it keeps out chaotic, as well as summoned or
enchanted creatures. It acts as magical armour on the recipient; the
protection encircles the recipient at a one foot distance, thus
preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or summoned or
chaotic nature. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from
the protected being.

Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by chaotic creatures incur a
penalty of -2 from dice rolls to hit the protected creature, and any
saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected
being's dice. This spell can be reversed to become protection from law,
although it still keeps out enchanted or summoned chaotic creatures as
well.

To complete this spell, the mage must trace a 3 feet diameter circle
upon the floor/ground with powdered obsidian for protection from law
and powdered glass for protection from chaos; or in the air using
burning incense or burning dung with respect to law/chaos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Rain (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: SM
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

After casting this spell, the wizard will remain dry even if standing
in the midst of a torrent. The caster is protected from splashes and
falling drops, but he is not protected from more concentrated bodies
such as puddles. The water will simply bead and flow down an invisible
field which surrounds the caster and his clothing at a distance of
about one inch. An oiled leather rag is the material component of this
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quantas's Target Bow (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 2d4 + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One bow
Saving Throw: None

While this spell is in effect, any arrows fired from the bow (which may
not be a crossbow) are +2 to hit a specific target. The caster must be
able to see the target, and call his/her shot. The +2 only affects hits
on the target, not on someone/something that gets in the way.

If the target is in melee, the target gets a +2 to it's size rating
when the DM determines the odds of hitting the target as opposed to
those around it. For example, if firing on a size six giant who is in
melee with a size two elf, there would normally be a one in three
chance to hit the elf. With target bow in effect, the giant would be
raised to size eight, giving only a one in four chance to hit the elf.
Should the arrow go at the elf anyway, it would not get its +2 to hit
(since the giant is the target).

Note that the arrow fired from the target bow is in no way magical. The
material component is a feather from a bird of prey, rubbed against the
bow string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sand Skin (Conjuration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: caster
Save: None

By this spell, the caster will cover himself with sand that will repel
damage.  The caster will be able to cover himself with enough sand to
block 8 + 1 per level points of damage.  The type of sand used causes
the body to be slightly shaded to that colour.  The spell lasts until
all the points are used up.  Multiple casting only raises you back to
the maximum of a single casting.

The material components needed are: ground granite, sandstone, or some
other type of fine sand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skeleton (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: 1 corpse
Saving Throw: None

With t
skeleton. The skeleton may then be controlled as per animate dead. A
mage may only have in existence through us of this spell one skeleton
per level.  The material component of this spell is a salve that
requires 50 gp and 24 uninterrupted hours to create.

Hit points of the skeleton are determined randomly. Disposing of
skeletons with insufficient hit points is possible, if expensive. When
a skeleton created by this spell is damaged, the damage cannot be
repaired.

Casting Time: 2

exceptions: only one target is affected (the caster chooses the target
and the Fireball expands until the target is engulfed), damage is 1d4
per caster's level (up to a maximum of 10d4), and exposed items receive
a +2 on their saving throws. The material components for this spell are
a bit of burning incense, and any gem worth at least 5 GP; both are
consumed with the casting.

Range: 30 yards
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the mage to command a spirit or extra-planar
creature with a single word. The command can be uttered in a language
the creature can understand (or a language the creator could understand
if it is a summoned spirit). Spirits and creatures with 6 or more hit
dice receive a save; spells save at their caster's level (if the caster
is at least of sixth level).

Area of Effect: One full grown tree.
Save: None

By use of this spell, the caster will control a tree branch for the
duration of the spell.  The caster can make the branch wave, attack,
fan a small breeze, etc.  If the branch attacks, it does so as a
fighter of the same level as the caster and will do 2d6 damage.  This
spell works only on full size trees.

The material components needed are a tree branch, a verbal "SMACK" and
a swing of the arm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wither (Necromancy)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell kills all normal vegetation within an area of 100 square
feet per level of the caster, who determines the shape of that area at
the time of casting. Trees receive a saving throw of 11, and special
plants such as treants suffer but 1d6 points of damage. The material
component is acid, sprinkled over the whole area of effect. Casting
time is exclusive of this administration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wizard Glue (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: SM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 20 square feet per level

of the wizard, up to 120 pounds. Dispel Magic will end the spell, and a
strength of 10 or greater can break a 20-pound bond. A strength of 12
can break a 40-pound bond, a strength of 14 can break a 60-pound bond,
and so forth. If the item held by the glue is brittle, it may be
shattered in the separation. Honey is the material component of this
spell.

Acid Water (Alteration)

Range: 2"
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 gallon per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns water into an acidic substance. If a creature touches
this stuff, it takes 2d4 damage. If the acid is drunk, it will take 4d4
damage. The caster can do anything in or to the substance without
taking any damage.

Ahshay's Mystic Mutable Aura (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 object or person
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a magic aura around an object similar to the one
from Nystul's Magic Aura. However, it hides not the magic property, but
the alignment of the target. The caster can specify which alignment he
wants the object to radiate as well as the strength of the radiation.
The higher the level of the caster the more radical alignment he could
place on the object or person. Note that this aura does not change the
alignment (if present) of a person or object.

This spell foils such spells as Detect Good/Evil, a paladins Detect
Evil ability and the spell Know Alignment. It does not change the
effect of the Protection from Good/Evil spells. Note that the priest
version of True Sight or a gem of seeing will see through this spell.
If the object or person acts in a different way than is indicated by
the aura, other people will get a disbelieve check. A mage with the
true sight spell will now get a true reading off a detect evil.

The material component of this spell is a sheet of thin silk in an
appropriate colour to the alignment being cast. It is consumed
completely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Moonlight (Evocation)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' per level radius circle
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an area of soft blue-grey light, apparently coming
downwards from above. This light effectively washes out all colour, but
clear vision is certainly possible within the area of effect. Vision is
also possible out to 10 yards beyond the spell's radius, but such
vision is dim and shadowy at best. The moonlight does not interfere in
any way with infravision, but the nature of the light is such that
creatures adversely affected by bright light suffer only half the
normal penalties when within the Moonlight and none when within its
shadowy fringes. The Moonlight spell may be centered on the caster, in
which case it moves with him. Otherwise, the spell must be cast on an
area and is stationary. The material component of this spell is a
moonstone that has been exposed to actual moonlight for a full night.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Rainbow Beam (Evocation)

Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell draws upon the power of the Quasi-Elemental Plane of
Radiance and brings forth a beam of pure light. The colour of the light
making up the beam is normally randomly determined by a roll of a d8.
However, the caster has a chance equal to 5% per level of being able to
select the colour of the beam (the caster may NOT select a multi-hued
beam. Such occurs only as the result of an aberration in the magic).
The colours of the beams are as follows:

1   red (cold)          5   blue (electrical)
2   orange (heat)       6   indigo (holy water)
3   yellow (acid)       7   violet (force)
4   green (poison)      8   multi-hued beam - roll twice ignoring 8's

The beam does a base of 2d6, plus an additional point of damage for
each level of the caster (e.g. a 7th level caster would inflict 9-19
(2d6+7) points of damage). Any creature resistant to the attack form
indicated by the colour of the beam takes NO damage, while a creature
vulnerable to the specific attack form (such as heat vs. a yeti) will
suffer double damage. A saving throw indicates that the beam has
missed and the intended victim is unaffected. Note that the beam may
hit a target other than the one intended. Once the beam hits a solid
object, it stops, even if that object is transparent. Any creature
suffering damage from the spell must make item saving throws if
appropriate. The material component of the spell is a small clear gem
or crystal prism worth at least 50 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Spark Shower (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5' x 20' long x 10'
                base wedge shape
Saving Throw: 1/2

The caster extends his arms and speaks the spell, and a sheet of
sizzling purple sparks shoots forth from the caster's hands. These
sparks cause 1d4 electrical damage per three levels of the caster,
rounded up, to a maximum of 5d4. Those wielding metal weapons (swords,
etc.) or wearing partially metal armour (ring, scale, chain) save at -2
and suffer +1 point of damage per die. Those wearing full metal armour
(splint, banded, plate, etc.) save at -4 and suffer double damage. The
material component is a bit of fur, glass, and copper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Star Gaze (Evocation)

Range: 60 yards
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature per 2 levels
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a blazing white sheet of light to issue from the
caster's eyes. This sheet will envelop a number of creatures based on
the caster's level. Those who fail a save vs. petrification will be
blinded for a full turn. Those who do save are merely dazzled (-2 on
to hit and AC) for 1 round, having looked away just in time. Dark
dependent creatures such as drow and gray dwarves save at a -4 vs.
this spell, and the duration of its effects are doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starblades (Conjuration)

Range: 10' + 10' per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Up to 1 creature per 3 levels
Saving Throw: none

This spell creates one magical star-shaped bladed weapon for each three
levels of the caster, up to a maximum of seven. The caster may then
throw these as weapons, out to the spell's maximum range. They are
treated as Slashing weapons with respect to effectiveness vs. armour,
and the caster's to hit rolls with them are at +3, in addition to any
bonus for high dexterity. Each Starblade that strikes causes 2d4
damage, +2 vs. creatures with powers drawing on the negative material
plane or plane of shadow. The material component is a small silver
star.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bigby's Groping Fingers (Conjuration)

Range: 3"
Components: S
Duration: 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This spell allows the caster "grope" his/her target. This spell is
usually used by mischievous apprentices in bars and such... have fun!
(gee, I don't know if I'm hitting a copyright problem by using the name
"Bigby" in here but it just seems the most appropriate name to use, and
for all I care, if TSR wishes to claim this silly spell as their own,
so be it).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cause of Death (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

With this spell the forensic wizard can determine if the corpse has
received damage from any of the causes listed in the table below, and
which cause actually reduced him to zero hit points. This spell
involves dissection of the corpse, and the material components are a
magnifying glass and a set of scalpels. These are not expended by the
casting.

Cause                   Notes and secondary information
------------------      --------------------------------------------
Exposure                exposure to cold, fire, heat, or lightning;
                        drowning
Falling or hanging      height fallen from
Disease or old age      organs affected, parasites involved
Magic                   applies only to magic missile or necromantic
                        effects
Wound                   wound inflicted by bludgeoning, piercing, or
                        slashing

The DM may introduce a chance of failure if the body is greatly
decomposed, and he might give false information based on nature of the
trauma. A corpse swatted by a dragon's tail, for example, might show
the same indications as one which fell from a great height, and a
poisoned corpse usually looks like one which died of disease. The
prudent forensic wizard always detects poison just to be sure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cloud Walk (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level + 1d6 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creatures touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the recipient to walk on any form of fog, cloud, or
smoke as if it were solid. The recipient may move at normal movement
rate, plus the movement rate of the smoke (thus a rising column of
smoke from a fire might carry the recipient up at 12 movement rate).
The smoke must be reasonably thick, reducing visibility
significantly... This spell will not allow walking on fine mist. The
material component is a hair from a nightmare.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dancing Fire Light (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 6" + 1" per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Save: 1/2

This spell - except as noted - is the same as Dancing Light (out of
TSR's Player's Handbook). The lights are orange-like in colour and give
o
attack doing 1-3 points of damage per ball (4 balls maximum).  All the
balls must attack the same target in any given round.  Optionally, the
caster can form one mass that looks like a fire elemental and can
attack once per round and does 3-9 points of damage.  The heat can set
fire to flammables.

The material components needed are a piece of flint and either a bit of
phosphorus or withwood.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Death Armour (Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

While this spell is in effect, any creature who touches the caster with
exposed flesh (to cast a spell, for example) will suffer 1d8 points of
damage. The spell will not protect the necromancer from damage, nor
does it have any effect on an armed opponent, but it will affect
undead, and the death master adds one point to damage inflicted with
his bare hands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Chaos (Divination) Reversible

Range: 6"
Components: VS
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1" wide path
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar in all respects to the second level mage spell
Detect Evil/Good (q.v.), except that the mage is detecting for
Chaos/Law.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Magic II (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 6" +2" per level path, 2" wide
Save: None

This spell is just like TSR's Detect Magic spell except it is more
sensitive, has a longer range (6"+1" per level for the TSR version),
and the caster will be able to determine accurately what kind of magic
(alteration, divination, conjuration, etc.) is in effect if the magic
is within 6"+1" per level.  This spell will not blind or hurt or ...
someone if in an area of extreme magic, the caster will simply know
that stronger magic is in effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Spirit (Divination) Reversible

Range: 20 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: VS
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: None

Detects the presence of a soul spirit or mentality in any body or
object (enchanted swords, etc.), and whether or not the mind
controlling the body is its "native". Thus, it will not detect charming
or hypnosis but will detect possession. Only the fact of a mind is
detected, not its nature. If it is cast on a normally invisible spirit
(such as an Invisible Stalker or Unseen Servant), the caster can see
the creature as a visible force for one turn per level. The reverse,
Obscure Spirit, has a range of touch and conceals a single mind or
spirit from detection by this spell for 24 hours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dispel Silence (Abjuration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: SM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15' radius
Saving Throw: None

When cast, this spell automatically dispels any magical silence within
its area of effect. Furthermore, no silence spell will have effect
within the area of effect for the duration of the spell.

The casting of this spell requires a small silver bell, chime, or gong,
which must be struck twice, at the end of each segment of casting. The
device must be worth at least 50 gp., and is consumed in the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duck! (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 1"
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 (but takes up the entire round - see below)
Area of Effect: One creature
Save: None

By this spell, the caster helps the defence out on himself or another
creature.  If the caster sees an attack coming, the caster can cause
the creature to be suddenly moved out of the way so as to cause the
attack to miss.  This will only work against body (claws, bit, etc.)
or hand held weapons.  The creature that has been moved must then take
5 segments readjusting his position before it can attack again.

The caster must prepare for this spell, and must declare at the end of
the previous round that he is casting this spell.  The caster then
waits until the monster attacks, and throws the spell.

Creatures that have never had this done to them before must make a save
vs. petrification or be stunned for 2 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dust Warriors (Conjuration/Summoning, Necromancy)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2" by 2" square
Saving Throw: None

The material component for this spell is a full set of teeth from a
man-sized or larger carnivore which must be cast on an area of earth,
rock, raw stone, sand or gravel as the spell is cast. The spell
generates 1 skeleton + 1 per 2 levels which rise from the area. They
will fight for the caster until they are turned or destroyed, the
caster is slain, rendered unconscious or moves out of spell range of
the group, or the magic is dispelled. They last only while there is
someone to attack (including each other, if necessary) - any round in
which there are no targets available the skeletons will fade back into
dust.

If dragon's teeth are used as the material component, each skeleton
will have bonus hit points equal to the age category of the dragon
(count 4 HP = 1 HD for turning and attack purposes). Furthermore, they
will be immune to the attack type of the dragon's breath weapon. [ed.
note: we use second edition, so dragon's teeth aren't too easy to come
by]

Expose Magic (Divination)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell will inform the caster of all of the details of a single
spell cast within one round per level - including the destination of a
teleport, the target of a charm spell, the name of a spell without
obvious effect, etc. The spell does not invalidate illusion magic - the
spell will return an answer consistent with the illusion (i.e. that a
Fireball was cast rather than a Spectral Forces) unless the caster has
already disbelieved successfully.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exterminate II (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None (to negate: both victim & insects)

Exterminate negates Call Insect, protects one person against Insect
Plague, and gives +6 on saves vs. Summon Insects. Dispel Magic requires
a mage of twice the caster's level. Magic resistance applies only to
the creature touched.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guilda's Sneakabout Light (Alteration)

Range: 5'
Components: VSM
Duration: 10 minutes + 1 minute per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5' radius
Saving Throw: None

Creates a dim, floating light of variable intensity that follows the
caster.  At its brightest, it is enough to read with good eyesight, and
it can be extinguished and restored at will during the duration.  No
light produced by the spell escapes the 5' radius, preventing the caster
from being given away by his light--so this spell is ideal for
thieves.  Note that background light penetrates the area of effect
freely, so the caster is in no way concealed by this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Detect Magic (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: 
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: None

This spell acts like Detect Magic except it works out to hundreds of
yards range.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Identify (Divination)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This spell is the same as Identify except that the caster gets a 20%
per level chance of identifying the item and gets a +2 on any saves
versus a cursed item.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last Experience (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the forensic wizard re-lives the last minute of the
recipient's life. If the victim was conscious during this minute, the
wizard must make a system shock check or be knocked out for 1d4 hours.
The material components are a convex lens and a scalpel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lightservant (Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 turns per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 3" radius around caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a variation of the first-level magic-user spell Unseen
Servant. The servant created by this spell is visible as a vaguely
manlike form of glowing light, and is slightly stronger, being able to
lift 3000 GP weight and taking 8 hit points
destroy. The light provided by the servant is enough to allow normal
vision in a 1" radius around the servant. Except as noted above, and
that the material components of this spell are a live firefly and a
piece of thread, this spell behaves as Unseen Servant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Malta's Pattern Creation (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can create a pattern for use with the spell
Malta's Pattern Transport. The Pattern can be any image with any
colours, but it must include a circle which forms the outer edge. The
Pattern can be any inch radius, but the cost of making the Pattern is
dependent on the materials used - so bigger Patterns cost more. The
Pattern can be woven into cloth, painted onto cloth or a hard surface,
or inlaid into a hard surface. The Pattern must be at least one yard in
diameter with no maximum size. The cost to make a Pattern is equal to
the square yards of the Pattern times the amount below:

Material                Cost            Time            Save
----------------        --------        --------        ----
Painted on Cloth        5 Silver        1 hour          15
Woven into Cloth        1 Gold          10 hours        12
Woven into Rug          2 Gold          15 hours        10
Painted on Wood         1 Gold          3 hours         10
Painted on Stone        2 Gold          4 hours         8
Inlaid in Wood          3 Gold          12 hours        5
Inlaid in Stone         5 Gold          16 hours        2

Patterns cannot be repaired, they must be remade completely. Patterns
can be moved (assuming the material can be moved as one unit) without
damage. The saving throw listed is the save the Pattern must make when
used for transport (see Malta's Pattern Transport for details) - the
material saves normally for any other damaging situation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Malta's Pattern Image (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One Pattern
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can imprint the size and image of an
undamaged Pattern. This imprinted image can later be used by the caster
to create a matching Pattern of his own. The imprinted image can be
recalled by the caster for up to one month per caster's level (at
casting time). If this time is exceeded, or the caster creates a
matching Pattern (even if different size), then the imprinted image is
dispelled. This spell is necessary to create an exact size matching
Pattern if the original Pattern is not present for the creation of the
matching Pattern. The caster can have up to one imprinted image/size
per level at a time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mangar's Bloodfire (Necromancy, Evocation)

Range: 40 yards
Components: 
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 1/2 (check each round)

This spell engulfs a creature with blue fire that burns for 1d4 hp per
3 caster levels (or fraction thereof) on round 1, then loses 1d4 per
round until it goes out. The flames do not ignite flammable objects,
they just hurt creatures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Noise Filter (Illusion)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: SM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5 feet radius per level
Saving Throw: Special

All creatures within the area effect at the time of casting will have
their hearing muted - they will not hear anything unless they have some
other confirmation of its existence. Thus, you can only hear people
speak if you can see their face or know precisely what they will say;
background noise will continue if you know it should be there but
sudden noises from the next room will not be heard, etc. Once a
creature notices or becomes suspicious of the effect (by turning around
and seeing a large pile of broken crockery they did not hear break, for
example), it will automatically be dispelled with respect to that
creature. The material component is a pair of blinders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paldeggeron's Accurate Arrow (Enchantment)

Range: Special
Components: VS
Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When cast, Paldeggeron's Accurate Arrow minorly enchants one missile
weapon (i.e. sling stone, arrow, quarrel, etc.) to automatically hit
any target normally within the weapon's range.  Effective with "called
shots", and situations of that nature.  The missile's enchantment does
normal damage as it were an unaided hit of the same nature.  The
enchantment instantly wears off upon the arrival at the missile's
destination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Petition (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: Special
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 Creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is used to alert an extra-planar being that the caster
wishes to contact it. The spell does not allow further communication
(though the extra-planar being may then contact the caster through
other magic).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plane Source (Divination) Reversible

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature or item
Saving Throw: Negates

Reveals the Plane of origin of any one creature, object or magical
phenomenon in spell range, or the Plane reachable by the closest gate
or dimensional nexus point. Hostile or unwilling creatures save vs.
spells to avoid their origins being divined. The reverse obscures
detection by this spell for 24 hours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Enchantment (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell is partially immune to magical forms of
sleep, charm, and fear. He automatically receives a saving throw even
if one is not ordinarily permitted, and if one is permitted, he saves
at +4. Note that this spell will not free the recipient from any
enchantment already in force, nor will it protect him from natural
drowsiness or feminine guile. Also note that protection extends only to
actual charm spells, such as charm person or charm monster, not to
enchantment/charm spells as a class. The material component is a lapis
lazuli or more potent stone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Cold (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is identical to the first level
clerical spell Resist Cold (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Paralysis (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

For the duration of this spell, the recipient is immune to all forms of
paralysis, including gaze attacks, paralytic poison, and Hold spells,
but it does not negate paralysis already in effect. The material
component is a feather and an infusion of tea and ginger (to be
consumed by the recipient).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reveal Owner (Divination)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One item
Saving Throw: None

The caster of this spell receives a mental impression of the most
recent owner or owners of the recipient object. An "owner" is defined
as an intelligent entity who was in direct physical contact (i.e., no
gloves) with the object one hour, or who had the object upon his person
for 24 hours. These time requirements may be divided by the caster's
level, and for every 4 levels of the caster, one previous owner can be
identified. Thus an eighth level wizard, for example, could determine
the last two owners who carried the object for at least 3 hours each.

The information gained is sufficient that the wizard will recognise the
owner on sight, and he can uniquely specify the owner for the purpose
of such spells as legend lore. The material component of this spell is
a handful of dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shield II (Abjuration)

Range: 1"
Components: VS
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Save: None

This spell creates an invisible barrier in a hemisphere around the 
caster.  This barrier provides the equivalent protection of:

AC. 0   vs. hand thrown objects (daggers, dart, throwing axes, etc.);
AC. 1   vs. device propelled (arrows, bolts, etc.);
AC. 2   vs. everything else.

Against magic the caster gains +1 to saves vs. things that are
physically damaging, negates magic missiles, and decreases spell damage
by 1 point per level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonic Barrier (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: SM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an invisible, spherical barrier through which sound
cannot pass. The barrier remains centered on the caster, enabling an
assault group to move in absolute silence without giving up
inter-communication. However, sound cannot pass into the barrier
either, making the party deaf for the duration. The material component
is a glass globe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Lodestone (Divination)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the caster is able to determine the general direction
of a creature within the one mile, per every three levels of the
caster (i.e. two mile range at fourth level, three at seventh, etc.).
This direction sense last for the duration of the spell, regardless of
the movement of the caster, or the creature. If the distance between
the caster and the target should exceed the maximum range (target
teleports, etc.), the spell is broken.

If the caster comes within three feet of the object of the spell, he
gets a sharp headache. If the caster actually touches the object of the
spell, the spell is broken.

The material component of this spell is some item which was in contact
with the creature, up to the caster's level in turns previously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spider Climb II (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Save: None

By this spell, the creature can walk on any surface and not slip.  The
creature can walk on walls, ceilings, ice, etc. and not slip or slide
(feet are like suction cups to the surface).  The creature can also
have one jump like the spell jump from TSR's books (this is only one
jump, not three like the first level spell gives).

The jump does not include a safe landing, but by using this spell, the
creature can jump up on a wall and start climbing, or climb up some
wall and jump to a different wall.

The material components needed are: a piece of gum (tree sap, or some
type of sticky substance) and a small jumping spider (a grass hopper
leg and a piece of spider webbing can be used as a substitute).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summon Undead (Necromancy)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VS
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: None

The spell causes 3 HD of undead per 2 levels of the caster to appear
within range. They will obey his commands until slain, dispelled, or
the spell ends. The wizard may mix and match types as long as he does
not exceed his HD allotment.

The necromancer cannot summon a creature of more HD than his level.
Treat a +3 or better bonus to HD as the next die up, so a wight is
worth 5 HD and a wraith is 6, a mummy 7, spectre 8, and a vampire (the
toughest undead that can be summoned) is worth 9.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Veschiul's Shadowcurse (Alteration)

Range: 3"
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

The Shadowcurse can affect any creature of the world of light. The area
of effect is one creature for every two levels of the mage above first;
i.e. a third level mage can affect one creature, a fifth can affect
two, and so on. The effect of the Shadowcurse is to afflict the victims
with some of the vulnerabilities of a shade. The effects depend on the
light conditions, as shown on the following table:

Light           Abilities       Move            Maximum HP
--------        ---------       ----            ----------
Bright          -2              1/2             1/2
Average         -1              3/4             3/4
Twilight        -               -               -
Shadowy         -               -               -
Night           -               -               -
Darkness        -1              3/4             3/4

See the description of Shade in the MM II for exact descriptions of
these light conditions. The material component is a piece of pitch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Veschiul's Shadowbolt (Evocation)

Range: 12"
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The spell Shadowbolt allows the mage to mold a bolt of shadow from the
Plane of Shadow, and fire it up to 120' range. A to-hit roll is
required, but is made as a fighter at a level of 1.5 times the mage's
level, rounded up. The Shadowbolt does damage by impact: at ranges
under 40', the damage is 1d4 per level, at ranges between 40' and 80'
the damage is 1d4 per 2 levels, and at greater ranges the damage is 1d4
per 4 levels. The number of dice should be rounded down in all cases
(thus, a fifth level mage at 50' does 2d4 damage, but a sixth level
mage does 3d4). The creature must make a DEX check to remain standing,
adjusted by a -1 for every two levels of the mage (again, rounded
down), as well as by mass:

Mass (pounds)   DEX adjustment  Distance
-------------   --------------  --------
1 - 30          -8              25'
31 - 60         -6              20'
61 - 90         -4              15'
91 - 120        -3              10'
121 - 150       -2              5'
151 - 180       -1              -
181 - 210       0               -
211 - 240       +1              -
241 - 270       +2              -
271 - 300       +3              -
300 +           +4              -

The distance column indicates how far the target has been knocked away
from the mage if the modified DEX check was failed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wings (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration:  3 rounds + 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3 rounds to cast, 3 more for wings to grow
Area Of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the caster creates "wings" to appear out of the effected
creature's back.  The wings are magically attached to the back area,
but are not attached in the sense that the person can be wearing
clothing or armour.  They are not part of the creature.  The wings need
a +1 magical weapon to hit, have AC 7 and have 2-12 hitpoints before
being destroyed. The spell has no effect on creatures that already have
wings. If there is no room for the wings to grow, e.g. because of
clothing, the spell is lost.

The wings can support a total of 200 pounds + 20 pounds per level. They
give an airial manouver rating of C, and fly at a rate of 12".

The material component of this spell is a bird's feather.  The wings
appear to be the same color as that of the bird feather used in the
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wound Closure (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VS
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell closes the wounds of the recipient to prevent bleeding and
infection, incidentally curing 1-4 hit points of damage. All of the
victim's wounds will be closed by a single casting, but further
application is possible to increase the healing effect. The spell can
be used on corpses to disguise the cause of death, but it does not work
on non-corporeal or extra-planar entities.

Note: A recent posting suggested that mages be able to cast healing
spells using 1d6 instead of 1d8. I believe the above spell description
shows my opposition to that approach (see also DMGv2 p. 43), unless you
intend to do away with clerics as a PC class. From a game mechanics
standpoint, such an approach would destroy the balance between priest
and mage, but there is a campaign background reason as well:
Pseudo-medieval medical knowledge would be atrocious. Clerical healing
is a gift from God or the gods, relatively omniscient and omnipotent
fellows, but magical curing would depend upon the mage's understanding
of the body and its functions. Thus you might find a wizard who can
pull the edges of a wound back together, as described above, but you
could not find one who could stimulate the replication of tissue of
various injured organs, insure an increased blood supply to the
affected regions, metabolise fat and increase respiration to enrich
said blood, etc. You certainly could not find a mage to cure diseases
before any microbes are discovered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zombie (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: 1 corpse
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to Skeleton in most respects. Instead of
creating a skeleton, it creates a zombie. The caster may control a
number of zombies made by this spell equal to half his/her level, round
down. The material component is a salve that costs 100 gp. and 48 hours
of uninterrupted time.

Alpha's Comet (Evocation, Conjuration)

Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: none

This spell creates a flaming missile with a trail of superheated
noxious gasses.  The comet unerringly strikes one target, the impact
causing 3d6 damage and the flames an additional 3d6.  Furthermore, any
creature within 5' of the comet's path will suffer 2d4 fire damage.
All those within 5' of the point of impact will suffer 3d4.  Anyone who
suffers damage from this spell is also considered to have been engulfed
in the noxious fumes, and will be at -2 on all rolls (10% spell failure
chance) for 1-6 rounds due to coughing, choking, and blurred vision.
The material component is a ball of pitch mixed with sulfur and
phosphorus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Darklight (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15' radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly the same as the second level magic-user spell
darkness 15' radius (q.v.), except in that the caster can see normally
through the darkness so created as if in normal lighting conditions.
Alternatively, the caster can bestow the visual benefits to another
character by crushing the material component and sprinkling the dust
into the eyes of the recipient.  The material component is a piece of
coal or charcoal, which must be crushed and applied as above.  Note
that the spell only allows normal vision through the darkness caused by
the particular casting, and lends no benefit towards other darkness,
either normal or magical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Flames of the Faltine (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell sheathes the caster in hot yellow flames and blurs the
caster's features somewhat, causing them to assume a smooth and
somewhat indistinct shape, also turning a dark red colour.  The flames
will appear to be present even coming out of the caster's eyes and
mouth.  These flames give the caster no special protection, but they do
shed bright light in a 30' radius.  Furthermore, any creature striking
the caster with a claw, bite, or similar attack or a hand-held weapon
less than 5 feet long will suffer damage as though contacting a Wall of
Fire spell (q.v.) - 2d6 damage + 1 point per level of the caster.
Undead suffer double damage, and creatures especially susceptible to
flame may also take additional damage.  The caster may attempt a melee
attack to burn others with this fire, a successful blow causing 1d6
damage + 1 point per two levels of the caster.  Creatures passing
within a 5' radius of the caster suffer 1d4 heat damage.  By standing
still and concentrating, the caster may extend this heat radiation,
inflicting 2d4 within a 5' radius and 1d4 within a 10' radius, but this
falls back to the usual level if the caster stops concentrating or
resumes moving.  The caster can attempt to destroy inanimate objects by
touching them, requiring a save vs. normal fire to avoid destruction.
This may be attempted once per round, at a -1 cumulative penalty for
each consecutive round of handling.  Items on the caster's person at
the time of the casting of this spell are unaffected by the flame.  The
caster may end this spell prematurely if desired.  The material
component for this spell is a flask of oil, poured over the caster's
head during the casting of the spell, and an open flame of any size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Heat Lightning (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One Creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls down a bolt of reddish-purple lightning which strikes
a single creature within range.  The bolt inflicts 1d6 of damage per
level of the caster.  Cold or water-based creatures suffer an
additional 1 point of damage per die, while creatures resistant to heat
OR electricity suffer 1/2 normal damage (1/4 with a successful save).
All non-magical metal worn by the target must save vs. lightning (at +2
if the save was made, but at -2 if the save was failed) or be fused to
any nearby metal (sword fused to gauntlet, pieces of armour fused
together, preventing movement).  The material component of this spell
is a short glass rod, a bit of fur, and a bit of iron or lodestone.

Alpha's Ice Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 60 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the magic-user opens a small hole in the spatial
fabric into the supernatural cold of the para-elemental plane of ice.
It brings forth a shaft of solid para-elemental ice 6 inches thick and
10 feet long (the hole is opened for only a very brief time).  This
missile hits with great force, causing 3-30 points of damage from the
impact alone.  If the target saves vs. petrification, only a glancing
blow is dealt, and the victim suffers only 1-10 points of damage.

An additional save (also vs. petrification, and at +4 if only a
glancing blow was suffered) must be made, or the victim will be stunned
for 1-6 rounds from the force of the blow.

The ice absorbs heat from the nearby air, and this causes 1-6 points of
cold damage (no saving throw) to all within 5 feet of the bolt's path,
and within a 10' radius of the target creature.  The bolt shatters upon
striking its target, and the victim will suffer an additional 4-24
points of cold damage (2-12 if only a glancing blow was suffered).

Fire-using creatures take double damage from the cold caused by the
bolt, while those resistant to cold take none.  Both types of creatures
suffer full damage from the bolt itself.

Water-based creatures in liquid form will suffer only 1-10 points of
damage from the blow, and cannot be stunned, but they will
automatically be slowed for 2-8 melee rounds.

If the target creature is struck fully (i.e. fails the initial saving
throw), then exposed items on that side of the caster must make a save
vs.  crushing blow, and all items carried by the caster must save vs.
magical frost (note also that items on the side struck by the bolt must
save at -10, due to the cold and the blow).

The material component of this spell is a clear gem worth not less than
100 gp.

Alpha's Images of Ikonn (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15' radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the 2nd level Mirror Image spell (q.v.).  The
caster gains 1 mirror image for each level of experience, rather than
rolling randomly.  These images can appear anywhere within 15' of the
caster, and a blurring distortion effect occurs in the casting of this
spell and at the end of each melee round which prevents isolation of
the true wizard in the new melee round, even if the wizard was
successfully attacked in the previous round.  Area effect attacks
(Fireball, etc.) can still affect the caster even if his location is
not known.  As a final benefit, if one of the images is struck by an
opponent, the caster may make an unmodified save vs. breath weapon.  If
successful, the image will not be dispelled by the blow.  The material
component of this spell is a small carving or doll of the caster and a
broken mirror.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Lightwall (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10' x 10' square per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a wall of dazzling yellow-white light to come into
being at any point within the range of the caster.  Vision through the
wall by any means is quite impossible, though it is negated by a
darkness (q.v.) spell cast at it.  When the wall first comes into
being, all those within 10 feet of it who are not averting their eyes
(thus a mage could warn his companions that he was about to cast this
spell) must make a save vs. petrification to avert their gaze from the
wall in time to avoid being dazzled by its brightness.  This dazzling
results in a -2 penalty to hit, a 20% spell failure chance for spell
casters, and a -1 penalty on initiative dice rolls.  These effects
persist for as many rounds as the difference between the victim's die
roll and the roll needed for him to save.  These effects can persist
even after the duration of the spell has elapsed.  Naturally, blind or
sightless creatures are unaffected by this spell, but subterranean or
dark dependent creatures (e.g. drow, duergar, svirfneblin) suffer a -3
on their saving throw.  Further, they are not protected by their normal
magic resistance, as the spell is not cast directly at them.  They are
as vulnerable to its existence as any other creature would be.  The
light given off is equivalent to a continual light (q.v.) spell within
20', and equivalent to a light spell (i.e. normal torchlight) in an
additional 80' radius.  The Lightwall, if cast out of doors, can be
seen up to a mile away per level of the caster (reflecting the
additional size of a larger caster's Lightwall).  The wall can, of
course, be created smaller than the maximum size for the caster's
level.  The wall itself causes no damage to creatures passing through
it.  However, a character fighting someone with a Lightwall directly
behind him suffers a -1 on his or her chances to hit (note that this is
cumulative with t
the first level wall of darkness (q.v.) spell, sound is blocked by the
Lightwall, assuming that it does not allow sound waves to travel around
the sides of it (as when cast outdoors, for example).  It does not
absorb sound or prevent spellcasting, it merely does not allow sound to
pass through it (even if such sound is from a Horn of Blasting or a
Shout spell).  The material component is a clear gemstone or a sunstone
worth not less than 100 gp.

Alpha's Lucent Lance (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

There must be some ambient light available in order for this spell to
work.  The effectiveness of this spell is determined by the amount of
ambient light available.  The caster must concentrate for a full round
to focus the light into the Lucent Lance, after which its energy may be
released.  The power of the Lance is such that it can carve through
wood or soft metal up to 4 inches thick, stone up to 1 inch thick, or
hard metal up to .25 inch thick, this thickness multiplied by the
appropriate modifier on the table below.  Items carried by a living
creature are partially protected by that creature's aura, and gain a
save vs. magical fire (modified as below) to avoid being damaged by the
Lance.  Living creatures suffer a base of 1d6 damage, modified as
below, with a maximum upper limit of not more than 1d6 per level of the
caster.  The Lucent Lance coalesces as a ball of light around the
caster's hand holding the material component, and shoots forth until
maximum range is reached or until a sufficient thickness of material
blocks its progress.  The Lucent Lance may be traversed over an arc up
to 1' per level of the caster at its maximum range.  The caster's hand
glows brightly while the spell is being cast and while it is active.

Direct sunlight, Sunray spell                   x 12            -4

If the light source used is a fire of some sort, that fire has a 50%
chance of going out.  A permanent light effect (e.g. magical sword or
dagger) will lose its power to shed light for 1d10 rounds.  A spell
used as the light source will be automatically dispelled if it's a
1st-3rd level spell, and will have its duration cut by 25% if a higher
level spell.  The material component is a small, oblong corundum rod
worth at least 100 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Night of the Leonids (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 30 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast outdoors at night.  It calls down a number
of flaming meteorites to strike unerringly any targets within range.
The caster can call down 1d4 meteorites, plus another for every five
levels of experience (d4+1 at 5th-9th, d4+2 at 10th-14th, etc.).  Each
meteorite strikes a single target, though more than one may strike any
given target.  Each of these `Leonids' comes blazing down from the
heavens, striking for d6+1 impact damage and an additional d6+1 fire
damage. The material component for this spell is a bit of meteoric
iron.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Rolling Thunder (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5' per level radius circle
Saving Throw: Special

The caster need but throw his arms heavenward and a great rolling
thunderclap will sound directly overhead. All creatures within 10' of
the caster must save vs. petrification or be knocked prone, suffering
d4+1 damage, and are automatically stunned for 1 round and deafened for
d4+1 rounds. Those within one-half the radius of the spell (e.g. within
25' of a 10th level caster) but not within 10' must save vs. spells or
be stunned for 1 round, and are automatically deafened for d4+1
rounds.  All others in the area of effect must save vs. spells or be
deafened for d4+1 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Silverlight (Evocation)

Range: 60 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30' radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to the 2nd level Continual Light spell in that it
creates a very bright light (almost as bright as full daylight).
However, any creature within the area of light which is vulnerable to
silver (e.g. wights, wraithes, lycanthropes, devils) will suffer 1d6
damage every round that it remains in the area of effect, and will be
at -2 to on to hit rolls and +2 to be hit due to the intense discomfort
felt by such creatures while within the Silverlight. Alternatively, the
caster may throw the spell directly at a single target. Such a creature
must save vs. spells or be blinded for the duration of the spell. If
the save is made, the spell forms as per usual about one foot behind
the intended target, and its duration is halved. A creature vulnerable
to silver who is thus targeted need not save vs. blinding, but will
instead suffer d6+1 (2-7) points of damage per level of the caster, up
to a maximum of 10d6+10, and will be stunned for 1d4 rounds. A
successful saving throw vs. spells at -2 will halve the damage and
reduce the duration of the stun to a single round. If thrown thus at a
creature vulnerable to silver, the spell will not form normally,
regardless of the saving throw, as its magic is used up in the attack
on the creature. The material component is a bit of pure silver.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starfire (Evocation)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5' diameter column, 30' high
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a column of brilliant, blazing silvery-white
flames.  All within 10' of the column not looking away must save vs.
petrification or be blinded for 1 round and dazzled (-2 to hit, +2 to
be hit) for an additional 1d3 rounds.  Creatures adversely affected by
bright light (e.g drow, duergar) save at -3 vs. this effect.  Any
creature within the narrow column of fire (most likely only a single
creature) is automatically blinded and dazzled as above, and
additionally suffers 1d6 damage per level of the caster, up to a
maximum of 10d6.  A save vs. spells will halve this damage.  If the
spell is cast outdoors under a night sky, a bonus of +1 per die of
damage is added.  The material component for this spell is a bit of
silver and a shard of crystal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Astral Wall (Abjuration, Conjuration)

Range: 1 yard per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level 5' radius at first level
Saving Throw: None

This creates a wall (which can have any shape the caster desires,
including a sphere) which prevents physical effects which would pass
through normal walls, such as Teleport, Astral Projection, Monkish
"phase" ability, etc. Any such attempt by a character will fail,
leaving the character on the other side of the wall. It is, however,
possible to simply walk through an Astral Wall. If the spell is linked
to an existing physical wall (including one created by Wall of Stone or
Iron), the duration becomes one hour per level. The Astral Wall can be
disrupted by Dispel Magic cast from either the physical or astral
plane. The material component is a piece of parchment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brains (Alteration)

Range: 
Components:

The recipient of this spell gains a temporary increase in intelligence
as follows: 

Normal  Extra
Int     Points
------  ------
1-4     4
5-8     3
9-11    2

Burning Hands II (Evocation)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This spell is exactly the same as its namesake except that it does
twice the amount of damage and reaches 10' out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Charm Undead (Necromancy, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 30 yards
Components: 
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: Special

This spell works just like the Players' Handbook spell Charm Monster,
except that it only works on undead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conceal Magic (Divination)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

Cast it on a magic item and it permanently renders that item
undetectable by Detect Magic (great for hiding magical traps).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Charm (Divination)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VS
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature per round
Saving Throw: None

This spell will reveal whether or not a recipient is under the effect
of a charm spell, provided that the recipient fails his saving throw.
Up to ten persons can be checked before the spell wanes. The caster has
a 5% chance per level of determining the exact nature of the charm
spell (or spells) which affect the recipient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Teleport (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 24" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Aftering casting this spell the caster gets an impression whenever
anyone arrives via teleport, enters or leaves the prime material plane
in the area of effect. The spell lasts only while the caster
concentrates on it. The impression will not reveal the location within
the range in which the effect occurs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enhance Illusion (Alteration)

Range: 0                
Components: VS
Duration: 1 round per level  
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One illusion in a 3" radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell is one way for illusionists to add actual "substance" to
their spells.  Up to two rounds before casting an illusion (notably
phantasmal force, improved phantasmal force or spectral force), the
illusionist casts this spell on the area in which the illusion is to
initially appear.  Once cast, the illusion then does 10% of the actual
damage that it would do if it were real if the victim made a saving
throw against it, and is treated as normal with respect to armor class,
attacks, etc., if the victim failed the saving throw and doesn't
recognize it as an illusion.  The illusion also becomes armor class 10,
and gains 10% of the hit points it would normally have; however,
illusionary creatures may never have more combined hit dice than the
caster.

If the illusion is not cast in the enhanced area within 2 rounds the
former spell will be wasted.  Multiple enhance illusions on one
illusion will cancel each other.  This spell can also be used in
conjunction with shadow monsters, demi-shadow monsters or shades,
adding 10% more realism to that already inherent in those spells, and
lowering the perceived armor class by one point.

Enhance Illusion is attributed to the deceased illusionist Scaurlin
Oberlin, who died in a magical duel with a grey slaad he summoned and
subsequently released.  This is reputedly the only spell Scaurlin ever
wrote in his once-promising career.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Free Action (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the recipient the benefits of Protection from
Paralysis, and the additional benefits of being able to function
without penalty in a constricting environment (such as water, Web
spells, Entangle spells, etc). It does not affect paralysis already
existing, unless it is cast specifically to counter such in which case
it gives no further benefit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gaseous Form (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 1d6 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell allows the caster to turn the creature touched into a pink
cloud of gas, for the duration of the spell. If the creature touched is
an unwilling recipient of the spell, he gets a save, with a successful
save negating the spell.

The spells effects are identical to that of the Potion of gaseous form,
with regards to movement rates, and the effects of a Gust of Wind
spell, though the caster, if he casts the spell on himself, can turn
non-gaseous at any time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hang (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VS, see below
Duration: 3 days
Casting time: Special
Area Of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the next spell the caster casts will be held (will not
take effect) until either the duration ends or the caster says a
keyword that will set off the spell.  The Spell that is held must be
third level or lower, and a magic user can only have one spell hung at
any given time.  For those spells that require a direction or a special
action (like pointing a finger for lightning bolt), the caster will
have to say the keyword and point at that time.  It takes one segment
for the held spell to go off (no casting time, only initiative), and
the caster should be given a bonus of +2 (in d6 initiative system) or
-4 (in the 10 segment system).  When the keyword is spoken by the
caster, it is only letting go of stored energy.  The caster still has
80% of his activity left in the round:  the caster can make one attack
or cast one first or second level spell late in the round.

The spell to be held must be cast with extreme caution.  It will take
twice the casting time and twice the components it would normally take
to cast that spell.  If the caster tries to cast another spell while
another spell is hung, the hung spell will fizzle.

No material components are needed to cast the spell hang, but those
needed to cast the next spell after are doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hold Spirit (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 120 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 to 4 spirits in a 20' cube
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell paralyses creatures which do not come from the plane they
are on, including conjured spirits and spirits possessing another
creature. If the spell is cast at 3 or 4 spirits, each gets an
unmodified saving throw. If two are being enspelled, they save at -1.
If there is a single target, it saves at -3. Held beings remain aware
of events around them and can use abilities which do not require motion
or speech. The material component for this is a straight piece of cold
iron.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Armour (Conjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to the first level spell Armour although it
provides its wearer an armour class of AC 2. The Armour lasts until
dispelled or until it has received 16 + 2 points per level of the
caster worth of damage.

Note: The armour does not absorb damage nor is it ordinarily visible.
It will work with a shield (fighter/mages only), DEX bonuses, and other
magical protection devices, like rings and cloaks of protection,
although it will not protect a creature wearing artificial armour.
Artificial armour includes all manufactured armours, but does not
include skin or hides that are a natural part of the creature to be
protected.

The material component is a small piece of finely cured blessed leather
which the caster must rub all over his body while casting. Note: the
leather is reusable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jam Radio (Alteration, Divination)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 100' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell prevents all magical communication spells of first or second
level from crossing the boundary of its area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Prismatic Snowball (Conjuration, Alteration, Enchantment)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per 3 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature per snowball
Saving Throw: Special

When cast, this spell creates a pile of coloured snowballs at the
caster's feet.  The number of snowballs is equal to the duration of the
spell in rounds - 2 at 5th level, 3 at 6th level, 4 at 9th level, etc.
The caster can throw one snowball per round as if he or she were
proficient in snowball throwing.  Other characters can also throw
snowballs, but they will suffer a non-proficiency penalty for it
(unless they have taken a proficiency in snowballs).  The snowball has
a range of 30 yards, plus 10 yards per Strength point of the thrower
over 12.

The snowballs do no physical damage when they hit; however, they have
powers that vary with the colour of the snowball according to the chart
below.  In order for the snowball's magic to work, the target must be
hit with it (a successful "to hit" roll required).  The snowball's
power only affects the creature hit, even if the spell it duplicates
has a greater area of effect.  The snowballs are always picked up and
thrown in the order given, starting with red and ending (assum
spellcaster is high enough level) with violet.

Number  Colour  Save vs.        Effect
------  ------  ------------    ---------------------------------------
1       Red     Spell           Charm Person
2       Orange  Spell           Faerie Fire
3       Yellow  Poison          Taunt *
4       Green   Paralysation    Spook
5       Blue    Paralysation    Glitterdust
6       Indigo  Spell           Bind
7       Violet  Wand            Tasha's Uncontrollable Hideous Laughter

(*) If the yellow snowball hits on an unmodified die roll of 20, the
victim has been hit in the face and has eaten some of the snow.  It
must then make an additional save vs. poison at a -4 or be violently
ill (no attacks, armour class worsens by 4) for a number of hours equal
to the caster's level.

The material components for the spell are a small rainbow-coloured
marble.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Missile II (Evocation)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This improvement on the first level Magic Missile allows the caster to
fire 1 missile per 2 levels of experience.  Each bolt can be
individually targeted and does 1d8 point of damage. The spell fires
that number of missiles every round until the caster is hit or ends the
spell. After the initial casting the missiles have a speed factor of 1
each and the caster may move, or engage in any other action besides
spellcasting after the missiles fire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Malta's Pattern Transport (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can move himself and other materials from
one Pattern to another Pattern. The two Patterns must have the same
image and the destination Pattern must be at least as big in radius as
the source Pattern. Both Patterns must be known to the caster (current
locations) and they must be laid flat. The destination Pattern must not
be supporting any object (even partially). The destination Pattern must
also be uncovered such that there is room for the incoming
creatures/objects.

If all of the above conditions exist, then casting the spell will
transport the caster and any objects/creatures which are completely
supported by the source Pattern to the destination Pattern. All objects
transported will end up on the destination Pattern at the same ratio of
distance to the edge as on the source Pattern. That is, if an object is
halfway from the center to the edge on the source Pattern, then it will
be halfway from the center to the edge on the destination Pattern
(regardless of the size of the destination Pattern).

An object is considered to be completely supported by the pattern when
its weight is supported by the material inscribed in the outer circle
of the Pattern or by something which is itself completely supported.
That means that a person held in the air by another will be transported
only if the holder is completely supported. Flying creatures must not
be flying at the time of transport.

To cast the spell, the caster must stand in the center of an undamaged
Pattern and cast the spell. In the first round of the casting, the
Pattern will begin to glow (each colour of the Pattern will emit its
own colour). Over the next eight rounds, the Pattern brightness will
increase to approximately the same as outside on a sunny day. As the
last word of the spell is stated, the brightness of the Pattern doubles
and all completely supported objects/creatures are transported to the
destination Pattern.

If the destination Pattern is not available (see above), then the
transported objects/creatures are returned to the source Pattern after
one second (and the source Pattern's save is at -4). The source
Pattern is subjected to some heat and other energies in the course of
the transport. These energies cause the source Pattern to make a save
or be damaged (a single crack or burn mark will alter the Pattern and
render it unusable). The destination Pattern is not subjected to the
same amount of energy, so it does not need to make a saving throw.

The lighting conditions at the destination Pattern do not change, so
the transported creatures will have to adjust to the current lighting
(1-2 rounds, depending on lighting).

Some notes:

1) Tossing a rug over an inlaid Pattern prevents incoming transports.

2) Rolling up a rug/cloth Pattern prevents incoming and makes it easier
to transport the Pattern.

3) The only bi-directional Patterns are exactly the same size (hence
the Pattern Image spell).

4) The caster must remain in the middle for all of the casting, but
creatures/objects also transported only have to be on the Pattern in
the last segment.

Marty's Magic Bow (Evocation)

Range: 0 (arrow range as per normal bows)
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Touch
Saving Throw: None

Marty's Magic Bow causes a magical force to propel objects from the
caster's fingers much as a bowstring. With arrows, the effect is to
allow the caster to release one arrow per round, each arrow attacking
as a fighter of 1/2 level of the spellcaster. The advantage of this
spell is the fact that the arrow attacks are not magical: thus there is
no magical saving throw involved for the target, so if the caster makes
his to-hit roll (at 1/2 his level on the fighter table) he hits, even
if the target is, say, in an anti-magic shell, or in a Cube of Force of
Keeps Out All Magic, or if the target is magic resistant.

There's probably a material component (say, a length of string made of
silver thread, or something like that) but the arrows are not
components - i.e. they're not consumed, and you might be able to
reclaim some of them. Also, magical arrows would provide the
appropriate bonuses to hit/damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Molten Ground (Alteration)

Range: 20 feet
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: circle of radius 2 feet per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes an area of the earth to bubble up molten lava in its
area of effect. After the caster spends one round casting, using up
material components of sulfur and lava rock, the spell begins. In the
first round the ground tremors slightly, and those not wearing heavy
feet covering such as metal boots can feel a slight warmth.

In the second round of the spell the heat becomes very pronounced, and
will ignite paper, cloth, and dry vegetation touching the ground. If
the people in the area of effect did not announce that they were moving
in this round, they are going to be injured.

In the third round the ground becomes molten lava, wooden furniture
bursts into flames, and metals with low melting points start to soften.
Anyone in the area of effect takes 3d6 damage, 2d6 this round only if
wearing thick shoes. In each additional round spent in the area of
effect a person takes 3d6 damage, and any items carried by the person
must safe vs. fire or be destroyed.

The intense heat of the lava may cause structural damage to walls that
are near or in the area of effect. Wooden walls will be destroyed by
fire just like wooden furniture. Protection from fire will protect a
person but not his items from this spell. Note that lava rock is hard
to obtain in most medieval settings, and that the lava generated by
this spell will not work as a component for later casting (it's marked
by magic).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Chaos, 10 Foot Radius (Abjuration) Reversible

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10 feet radius sphere around creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the first level spell protection from chaos
(q.v.) except with respect to its area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rathe's Trigger (Conjuration)

Range: 3 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Up to 1 cube foot per level
Saving Throw: Special

The Trigger spell is designed as a defensive spell. When it is cast,
the caster defines a volume which must be at least 1/2 foot in every
dimension. This area begins to glow faintly. The caster then casts
another spell directly upon the Trigger's area. The Trigger's area of
effect must be touched by the caster when applying the second spell.
The glow then vanishes, but both spells remain. The second spell is
held by the Trigger until someone enters or touches the Trigger's area
of effect. At this time the second spell will go off.

If it is an area effect spell (e.g. Fireball, Web) it will be centered
on the center of the Trigger area. Other considerations (the dimensions
of the web, for instance) must be specified at the time of casting the
se
will be applied to the person who triggered the spell. A saving throw
is applicable only if allowed by the second spell. If the caster is in
or touching the Trigger's area of effect, it will not go off. This
allows the caster to escort others safely through the trapped area.

One possible use for this spell is two triggers overlaid in a corridor,
one with a Fireball, and the other, placed slightly behind the first,
with a wall of force. If a person enters the regions from the wrong
direction, the Fireball will go off, and the wall of force will
instantly restrict the blast to one direction. If a person enters the
regions from the other direction, the wall will trigger first and
shield him from the blast. The spells will last until triggered, but if
the second spell is not applied immediately, the trigger will only last
one turn per level of the caster. The material component is a black
pearl of not less than 500 GP value per level of the second spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reconstruct (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 pound per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell temporarily resurrects an item that was shattered, burnt, or
disintegrated, so that the forensic wizard may study it. He must gather
as much of the debris as possible, for otherwise the object can be but
partially reassembled, in which case it may be illegible or
unidentifiable. The object will be very fragile, but it may be the
subject of various divination spells such as identify or reveal owner.
The material component is a drop of honey.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Replay (Divination, Illusion)

Range: 60 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 400 square feet
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes past events to be re-enacted in the area of effect.
The replay will consist of a three-dimensional, transparent image
superimposed over the area of effect. The wizard can freeze the action,
reverse it, scan rapidly for a desired event, or skip to any time
within range of the spell, as given in the table below. An hourglass is
the material component.

Level           Spell Range
-------         -------------------
5 - 9           1 day per level
10 - 15         1 month per level
16 - 17         1 year per level
18+             1 century per level

The speed of the search is determined by the DM and limited by the
magnitude of the event in question. It would be easy to spot the
passage of an army, for example, even when scanning at a month per
turn, but spotting a pick-pocket would require a real-time search.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Electricity (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is identical to the 2st level druidic
spell resist electricity (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Fire (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is identical to the second level
clerical spell Resist Fire (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rhuva's Spellscan (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 4 hours + 10 minutes per level
Casting Time: 1 minute
Area of Effect: 10 yards per level radius
Saving Throw: None

Provided the caster is conscious and within the area of effect, he will
be made aware of any spell-casting conducted in that area.  The
particular spell cast is not made known, but the location of the wizard
is, precisely if the caster is familiar with the area, generally
otherwise.  The notification is sufficient to disrupt casting in
progress, unless it is consciously suppressed before casting (if
suppressed, caster does not realise the scan was triggered).  Material
component is a handful of crystal dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Snowball (Evocation)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2" radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

A snowball is an explosive burst of cold gas, which comes into being
with a loud "whoosh" and delivers damage proportional to the level of
the mage who cast it, i.e. 1d6 per level of the spell caster. The
snowball doesn't expend a considerable amount of pressure, and it will
generally conform to the shape of the area in which it occurs, thus
covering an area equal to its normal spherical volume. [The area which
is covered by the snowball is a total volume of roughly 33000 cubic
feet].

Besides causing damage to the target, the snowball freezes all liquids
within its radius. Items exposed to the spell's effects must make a
saving throw to avoid being affected. Items with a creature which makes
its saving throw are considered to be unaffected. The mage points his
finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the snowball
is to come into being. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and
unless it impacts upon a material body prior to attaining the
predescribed range, blossoms into the snowball.

If creatures fail their saving throws, they all take full hit point
damage from the spell. Those who make their saving throw manage to
dodge, fall flat or roll aside, and thus take only half damage from the
effect of the spell. The material component of this spell is a hollow
crystal filled with water; suspended in the water are tiny white quartz
flakes. [cf. Fireball]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Magic Tracker (Divination)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster is able to illuminate the tracks of any
being of which he has a some item that was in contact with the being a
number of turns equal to the caster's level previously. The item could
be anything from a shirt, to a scrap of hair, or drop of blood. The
tracks are only visible to the caster, and only tracks within the area
of effect are visible.

The spell only illuminates tracks within the spell's area of effect
(which moves with the caster), and will only illuminate tracks made on
a solid surface (i.e. if the being being tracked took to flight, or
dove into water, the trail would end there).  However, if the caster is
able to reach the spot where the trail was resumed (i.e. the being
being tracked wades out of a river at a certain spot), the caster may
resume tracking.

It is up to the caster to determine which direction leads to the most
recent tracks (i.e. which are coming and which are going), although the
spell does illuminate a "footprint" of the being which is being
tracked. The spell will allow the caster to track the being if it
climbed walls, and even if it tried to obscure its path, by throwing
dirt over it. Objects over 3" thick covering the path, however, do
obscure it.

The material component of the spell is some thing which had been in
contact with the creature to be tracked, up to the caster's level in
turns previously. Once the spell is cast, the caster need not carry the
item with him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Trance (Divination, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10 foot radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to mimic the actions of a creature,
provided the actions occurred within a number of turns equal to the
caster's level. During the casting of the spell, the caster must touch
some object which the target creature was in contact with for at least
a round, and that contact must not have occurred more than the caster's
level in hours previously.

Upon casting the spell, the caster goes into a trance, during which he
loses all control of his actions (save vs.  spells at -4 to break
spell), and begins mimicing the most recent actions of the target,
provided the actions occurred within the area of effect. The spell does
not allow the caster to mimic actions of which he is incapable, such as
climing walls, or broad jumping 20', and the caster merely imitates any
spells the target may have cast, and doesn't actually cast the spell
(although observers may recognise the spell he is attempting to cast).
If the target did something which would take it outside of the area of
effect, such as rapid movement beyond the abilities of the caster, or
teleportation, the spell is broken.

The caster must decide how far back in time he would like to begin
mimicing the actions of the target. The actions of the target may take
the caster beyond the original area of effect, but there is a 10'
radius sphere over which is determine
the area of effect.

The caster has the option of casting such movement spells as fly and
feather fall, prior to Trance, to facilitate movement such as climbing,
and even flying, and to take the pain out of such actions as falling
(if the target was a clutz). The target must be man sized, and
humanoid.

The caster's trance will be broken by such things as damage, slapping,
and other unpleasant stimuli.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soul Safe (Abjuration, Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the Necromancer stores the soul of the recipient in a
piece of jet, the material component. While his soul is thus protected,
a character suffers a penalty of -2 to attack rolls and saving throws,
he does not heal naturally, and magical healing functions on him at
only half normal efficacy. If the character is slain by undead while
under the effects of this spell, however, his soul cannot be corrupted
and forced to rise as undead itself (though the body can still be
animated as a zombie or skeleton). If the soul safe is destroyed, or if
the spell expires, the soul will return (across any distance) to its
body, unless that body is dead, in which case it will journey to its
final resting place. This spell affects only races with souls:
dwarves, halflings, and humans.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spirit Call (Conjuration/Summoning) Reversible

Range: 10 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This summons one incorporeal spirit of hit dice equal to one half the
caster's level from the astral plane. The round after it is summoned,
it will begin to perform services for the wizard. In its native form,
it is a powerful Unseen Servant which can go up to 100 yards from the
wizard, lift 50 pounds per hit die, and fly at 18". This form has a
punch for 1d6 damage, AC 0, and takes one point of damage from any
weapon blow.

Secondly, it may provide animating force to a body or statue, in which
case it uses whatever weapons or armour are available (a stone statue
will be AC 0, damage 2d6 or by weapon, move 9" unless affixed or
possessing wings).

Thirdly, it may attempt to take over the body of one enemy creature.
The being so affected is allowed a save, and the spirit will be forced
back to the astral plane immediately if the save is successful. If the
save fails, effects are as a Domination spell for the duration of the
Spirit Call, but the domination cannot force someone to use magic (the
Spirit would not understand the instructions). A spirit who has less
than 1/2 of its hit points left will be unable to possess someone.

The material component is a piece of candy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stren's Improved Floating Disk (Evocation, Conjuration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is an improved version of Tenser's Floating Disk. The big
improvement is the speed of the disk - now 30". The disk can also move
from 3' to 30' off the ground/water. The disk movement is based
relative to the caster, which prevents the caster from riding their own
disk. However, if two casters use this spell, they can ride each others
to travel. This travel can either be in the form of independent
movement (tricky to communicate since somebody else is steering yours)
or master-slave. In the master-slave travel, one caster steers a disk
while he rides on a disk which stays the same distance from its
caster.

S1 <---> S2 <---> M

Caster 1 is the master and riding in the back (caster 3's disk). Caster
2 is in the front riding on the master's disk - his own disk stays x
feet behind him. Caster 3 rides in the middle and his disk also stays
x feet behind him. Caster 1 steers the chain while the other two can
sleep, eat, cast spells, etc. I have this written down at home, but I
believe that all other parameters are the same as Tenser's Floating
Disk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

View Past (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: one hour
Area of Effect: a circle of radius 5 feet per level
Saving Throw: None

The spell is cast on an area, and allows the caster to create a
three-dimensional image of the past in that location. The caster
specifies the time in the past by the material component: one gold
piece equivalent of gold dust is used for each hour back that is
viewed. Thus if the caster uses 24 GP worth of dust, he or she can view
a period starting roughly 24 hours in the past through the duration of
the spell (a tenth level caster could view the period from 24 hours in
the past to 24 hours - 100 minutes, that is 22 hours and 20 minutes, in
the past).

After the spell has been cast, the DM rolls 1d20 - 10 to determine the
error in the time frame. Thus if the DM rolls 5 - 10 = -5, the time
viewed is actually N hours and 5 minutes in the past; a roll of 10-10 =
0 indicates exactly the right amount of gold was consumed.

The caster should roll 1d20 to determine the clarity of the casting. A
1 indicates that the scene comes through as shadows in a fog; a 20
indicates a crystal-clear picture. This roll can be repeated in
subsequent castings, and represents the difficulty of seeing through
time.

Events that were cloaked by spells that hide themselves from
Clairvoyance also mask out View Past, and can never be seen using this
spell.

                        Fourth Level Spells

========================================================================

Alpha's Acid Rainstorm (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 240 yards
Components: VSM
Durations: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' x 30' square
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell, which functions only out of doors, causes thin streams of
hissing violet acid to fall within its area of effect.  All within the
area must save vs. spells or suffer full damage.  The spell inflicts
1d8 per two levels of the caster (rounded up).  All exposed items in
the area must also save vs. acid or be destroyed.

Characters under heavy cover which is not destroyed by the acid are
fully shielded from the effects of the spell.  The acid, once it
strikes the ground, harmlessly disappears.  The material component for
the spell is a small vial of aqua regia and a strip of zinc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Acid Resistance (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the subject complete immunity to acid, up to a
point.  The spell's basic duration is 10 rounds per level of the
caster.  However, for every point of acid damage that would have been
suffered by the character (after saving throws and any other
protections have been considered), the duration of this spell is
reduced by one round for every point of acid neutralised by the spell.
This spell also protects the subjects equipment from needing to make
any Item Saving Throws vs. acid for as long as the spell is in effect.
The material component is a small glass vial containing lye and water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Ball Lightning (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: VS
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

The caster of this spell can create one to four spheres of glowing
electrical energy.  These spheres resemble Dancing Lights (q.v.), and
the caster can control them in the same way.  The spheres can be moved
up to 120' per round.  Each ball is about 5' in diameter, and any
creature(s) approaching within 5' will dissipate that ball's charge.  A
save vs. spells results in half damage, indicating that contact was
across an air gap.  Note that more than one creature approaching within
5' in a single round can be affected by the ball is that occurs.

The charge values are:

1 lightning ball        4d12
2 lightning balls       5d4 each
3 lightning balls       2d6 each
4 lightning balls       2d4 each

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Chill of the Void (Evocation, Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20' wide path, 5' per level long
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings forth a wave of supernatural cold, rolling forth from
the caster's outstretched arms to the maximum area of effect.  Its cold
vacuum kills all normal vegetation in the area except for trees, which
have a 50%-100% chance to survive (DM's discretion, based on size and
native environment).  This cold inflicts 3d4 damage and the vacuum an
additional 3d4 to all living creatures within the area of effect.
Vegetable and fungoid monsters suffer double damage from this spell.
The material component is a piece of ice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Elemental Form (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

Use of this spell enable the spellcaster to transform the matter of a
creature's body into the stuff of a particular elemental plane.  The
elemental form enables the character to engage in normal combat with an
elemental of the same or opposite form (i.e. water would allow combat
vs.  water or fire elementals), or an elemental creature, without
needing a magical weapon to hit.  It also provides protection vs. the
same element as if a ring of warmth (+2 on saves, -1 per die of damage,
regenerate 1 hp of elemental-caused damage per turn).  The subject can
also exist without danger on the appropriate elemental plane, and can
move normally there.  It does NOT empower the subject with perceptions
not normally possessed (e.g. seeing through the rock of elemental
earth), but it does prevent elemental damage.  A character possessing a
ring of elemental command who assumes Elemental Form of the same type
gains the cumulative effects of both, and IS empowered with senses on
the appropriate plane as if in normal air.

If this spell is cast on the prime material, the spell will last 1 turn
per level of the caster.  If cast on the appropriate elemental plane,
or in the border Ethereal of that plane, it will last 12 turns per
level.  If cast while on an elemental or para-elemental plane different
from the form assumed, start with the base of 12 turns per level and
halve the duration for each plane removed.  An Elemental Form in
opposition to the plane the caster is on (air vs. earth, fire vs.
water) cannot be assumed at all.

The material component is a small amount of the appropriate element on
hand (a handful of clay or earth or a torch flame will suffice).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Firefall (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is an improved version of the 2nd level Pyrotechnics spell
(q.v.), specifically the "fireworks" application of that spell.  That
portion of the spell functions exactly as the Pyrotechnics spell does
with respect to duration, area of effect, saving throw, and the
blinding effect created.  However, the "fireworks" created by this
spell are more along the lines of a geyser of brightly burning liquid
fire, arcing upwards approximately 60' into the air and raining down
within a 30' area surrounding the perimeter of the basic fire source.
All in this area of effect suffer 2d6 fire damage with no saving throw
allowed.  Further, a central prominence of flame is thrown upwards by
this spell, and the caster may direct this column of fire at a single
target within 60' of the fire source.  This plume of fire will inflict
4d10 damage to the victim, although a saving throw vs. breath weapon is
possible to halve this damage.

The liquid fire continues to burn during the following round, under the
same conditions as during the first round, although the fire is less
intense and causes only half the damage caused during the first round.
Combustibles in the area of effect must save vs. normal fire (if struck
only by the burning spray) or magical fire (if the victim of the
central plume fails his or her saving throw or if the central plume is
directed at an inanimate object) to avoid being set afire.  A creature
who is within the area of the spray who is targeted by the central
plume will not also suffer fire damage from the spray, as this minor
flame is all but lost in the fury of the central prominence.  The spray
does not fall within the area of the original fire source, but only
within 30' of the perimeter of the fire source.  An aerial creature
flying within 60' above the rising geyser of liquid fire is affected
just as a creature on the ground would be, and may also be targeted
with the central plume, if the caster so desires.  The material
component for this spell is a lump of pitch mixed with sulfur,
saltpeter, and magnesium, as well as an existing fire source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Flames of Falroth (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 10 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures an extra-dimensional black flame to surround a
single object or creature within range.  This fire has exactly the
opposite effect of normal fire, in that it restores creatures or
objects burned to destruction by fire or acid to their original state.
This will not restore life to a person slain by a Fireball spell, but
it will restore the body to full health, such that a Raise Dead spell
will bring the character back to full physical health (though an amount
of time equal to the time dead must be spent recovering from the
psychological shock).  Similarly, it will not restore enchantment to a
once-destroyed magic item, though a Limited Wish spell is capable of
restoring the lost enchantment to the item reconstructed by the Flames
of Falroth.

In order to restore an item or creature, the target must fail a saving
throw of the same type that resulted in its destruction.  Hence, plate
mail destroyed by the breath of a black dragon must fail a saving throw
vs. acid, and an adventurer felled by a Fireball must fail a save vs.
spells.  For effects against which there is no save (e.g. Wall of
Fire), assume the save to be as against breath weapon for creatures or
magical fire for items.  It is thus more difficult to restore items
that were more difficult to destroy in the first place.  One such save
may be attempted each round, and as many saves as desired may be
attempted during the use of this spell.  No object can ever be affected
by this spell after the spell has been used on it once, whether or not
it was successful.  Once the save is failed, the object will take 2
rounds to be fully reconstructed from its remains.  The Flames of
Falroth may be moved to another object or creature at any time during
the spell's duration, with 1 round of concentration on the part of the
caster.

The Flames of Falroth are very hostile to ordinary fire.  They may be
used as a fire extinguisher or sorts, and will extinguish a 10' cube of
normal flame every round.  Magical fire spells must be checked as per
Dispel M
of determining whether the target spell has resisted the effects of the
Flames of Falroth.  If this Dispelling attempt is unsuccessful, the
Flames of Falroth will vanish back from whence they came.

If cast at an elemental fire creature of any sort, the Flames of
Falroth will automatically cause 6d6 damage to that creature.  After
this initial attack, the target creature may make a save vs. spell at
-3.  If successful, the Flames disappear without causing further harm.
If failed, however, the Flames continue to attack the creature's very
substance, causing 3d6 damage every round.  A new saving throw is
allowed each round, the chance to save improving by 1 each round (-2
after the second round, then -1, etc.).  This continues until the
creature is dead, the caster moves the flames away (after which time
that creature will no longer be affected by the Flames of Falroth), or
until the spell expires or a save is made--in both of these cases, the
Flames disappear.

A fire-using or dwelling creature that uses fire but is not native to
the Elemental Plane of Fire (e.g. fire giant, red dragon, chimera) will
not be harmed by the Flames of Falroth, but any external fire powers
(fire breath, spells, immolation, etc.) will cause only half normal
damage, as their effectiveness is mitigated by the Flames.  The
material component is a bit of green wood, a handful of ashes, a smoky
quartz crystal, and a piece of obsidian.

Alpha's Hunting Pack (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons into the caster's vicinity a pack of canines who
will fight on behalf of the caster, if such is required.  The
composition of the pack will be as follows:

01-10   4-16 jackals
11-60   3-12 wild dogs
61-90   2-8 wolves
91-00   1-4 dire wolves

The pack will follow commands to the best of its ability, so long as
they are relatively simple (attack, return, heel, etc.).  If attacked
by the caster or his fellows, all creatures summoned will instantly
disappear.  The hounds can track as well as a 5th level ranger, and can
be commanded to perform this activity if it is requested of them (such
as by allowing them to smell an article of clothing from the creature
to be tracked, etc.).  The hounds will arrive 1-10 rounds after the
spell is cast.  The material components are a piece of fresh, uncooked
meat and a finely crafted silver or ivory hunting horn, worth not less
than 100 gp., which must be sounded during the casting of the spell.

Alpha's Rainbow Blast (Evocation)

Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1' wide beam
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is very much like the second level Rainbow Beam spell, but
is much more powerful.  Besides a slightly larger area of effect, and
the fact that a solid object will not stop the beam unless larger than
2' wide AND formed of solid stone or some such similar dense material,
i.e.  the beam is not stopped by mere flesh, even if armoured, but
would be stopped by a stone wall.

The spell does 2-7 (1d6+1) points of damage per level of the caster.
The swirling, coruscating tendrils of multi-hued light also have
properties as listed under the Rainbow Beam spell.  A target resistant
to one or more of these forms of attack takes -1 point of damage per
die per attack that it is resistant to.  The obverse applies for
creatures that are particularly vulnerable to a certain form of attack
(e.g. a frost giant is immune to cold, but is not particularly
vulnerable to fire, so it would take -1 point of damage per die.  A
green slime, vulnerable only to fire and cold, would take -5 points of
damage per die.)  The indigo (holy water) beam does normal damage
except to creatures affected by unholy water (paladins, lammasu, etc.,
who are considered as being resistant), and those affected by holy
water (undead, demons, etc., who are considered as specifically
vulnerable).

The victim is entitled to a saving throw, which, if successful,
indicates that the beam has missed.  It may hit another target,
though.  Also, if a target is struck by the beam, he or she must save
vs. petrification or be struck in the face and blinded for 3-6 rounds.

The material component for this spell is a small diamond worth not less
than 100 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Ray of Paralysis (Alteration)

Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

The caster extends his arm, points his finger, and speaks a word to
cast the spell.  A thin, light blue ray leaps from the caster's
finger.  The intended target must save vs. petrification.  If the save
is failed, then the creature is struck by the beam and, unless the
creature possesses some innate magic resistance, is paralysed for 2
rounds per level of the caster.  If the save is made, the pencil-thin
ray has missed its original target and continues on in a straight line
to the extent of its range.  Any creature in the path of the beam must
make the same saving throw or be struck and paralysed.  If the ray
actually strikes, there is no save vs.  its effects.  Size L creatures
must save at -1, size H at -2, and size G at -4.  Conversely, size S
creatures save at +1 and size T at +3.  The ray can affect only target
in any event.  The material component is a clear gem or a piece of
amber worth at least 100 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Shadowfire (Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1' diameter ray, 5' per level long
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls forth a seething black ray shot through with veins of
green fire.  All creatures in the path of the spell will suffer d4
damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 20d4.  A successful
save vs.  breath weapon will result in only half damage.  A creature
that is immune to fire or to energy drain will suffer only one-half
damage (one-quarter if a successful save is made).  If the damage
rolled exceeds a target's remaining hit points, that target is
disintegrated.  The material component is a black opal worth at least
500 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Sheet Lightning (Evocation)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 10' square area per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a very bright flashing jolt of sheet lightning
within the area of effect.  All those in the area receive 4d4
electrical damage with no saving throw.  In addition, those within must
save vs. petrification to avoid being blinded for 1d3 rounds and must
save vs. breath weapon to avoid being stunned for 1d3 rounds.  Those
carrying large, mostly metallic weapons (e.g. swords, battle axes) or
wearing partial metal armour (studded-chain) save at -2 vs. the
stunning and suffer +1 per die of damage.  Those in full metal armour
(splint or better) save at -4 vs. the stunning and suffer double
damage.  The material component is a bit of fur and a sheet of fine
crystal worth at least 50 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bergil's Fire Bolt (Evocation)

Range: 20 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

The spell creates a powerful bolt of plasma that in inflicts 1d8 points
of damage per level to anyone in it's area of effect (maximum damage is
12d8). This bolt is 60' long by 5' wide, it cannot be forked. It
streaks outward much like a lightning bolt. It does not reflect,
however. If the Firebolt hits a wall the plasma spreads out in 5'
radius hemisphere, anyone in the hemisphere takes damage. Thus it is
possible to hit someone standing near a wall twice with the Firebolt,
once with the bolt and once with the hemisphere. The Firebolt
automatically sets fire to anything combustible in the path or in the
hemisphere. The bolt has the same penetration ability as a lightning
bolt. The material components are: a stick, a bit of sulfur, and a dab
of royal honey. All are consumed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Branit's Backstabbing Surprise (Conjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 8 feet radius semi-sphere
Saving Throw: None or 1/2

This spell provides protection against backstabbing. When the recipient
of the spell is backstabbe
spell recipient which blows back and out to form a semi-sphere 8 feet
in radius. All within the area of effect, the recipient not included,
take 6d4 + 6 points of acid damage. Note that the backstabber gets no
save (due to surprise and proximity), all others receive half damage
upon successful save.

A backstabbing attack is any physical attack or combination of attacks
initiated from behind which causes damage equal to 1/5 or more of the
victims hit points at the time of the attack, assuming the attacker is
within 8 feet of the victim when the attack is initiated. The spell is
in effect until dispelled or discharged. This spell will work in
combination with other defensive spells.

The material component is 100 red ants which must be rolled in the
casters hands, the husks then thrown over each shoulder of the
recipient, and the juice rubbed into the recipients back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Broom (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 hour per level + 1d6 hours
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Broom touched
Saving Throw: None

A witch uses this spell to enchant her broom with the power of flight.
The broom flies with a movement rate of 30, minus 1 per 14 pounds above
182 pounds which it is carrying, and it can climb and turn at an angle
of 30 in response to the verbal command of its mistress. While the
enchantment lasts, the witch can summon the broom from up to 300 yards
away. The material components are a broom, which is not used up by the
casting, and a feather, which is. The long casting time is necessary to
set the command words, but if the spell is recast on an already
enchanted broom, it has a casting time of 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chaos Vision (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 1" per level
Components: VS
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: 1" radius sphere per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell offers some protection from teleport spells by constantly
shifting and shaping what an area looks like.  Thus a mage cannot use
information gathered previously to teleport to the effected area as the
surroundings will have seemingly changed.  Objects located in this
environment or entering it will be effected also, first appearing as
one object or animal and then shifting to another.

Another use found for this spell is as a trap.  Slimes, molds and other
creatures that don't need senses to attack can be placed in this
environment and effectively are invisible.

Any attacks on anything in the area of effect is hindered by a -4
modifier to hit.  Note that true seeing and similar magics that see
through illusions will likewise penetrate this one.  No damage will be
taken by being in the illusion. ( Unless from something else physical
also there of course! )  The main purpose is simply to constantly
conceal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Damian's Insulated Envelope (Abjuration)

Range: 0"
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

Due to his personal dislike of lightning the archmage Damian crafted
this spell to specifically counter its harmful effects. When cast, this
spell seems to cover the caster in a pale blue light resembling an
envelope. Once cast the caster gains 2 Benefits (much like fire
shield).

1) A save vs. lightning at + 2 indicates no damage to the caster. A
failed save merely indicates Half damage. If at any time the caster is
hit by any acid or acid spell the caster must save normally or take
double damage.

2) If any melee attacks are made on the caster, on a successful strike
the caster takes normal Damage but so does the attacker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deadthought (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This is essentially telepathy with a corpse, as the forensic wizard
probes the brain of the deceased for specific data. The dungeon master
must decide if the information sought is basic, well known, merely
known, or forgotten. The table below lists the chance of finding the
information and the amount of time required by the search (if location
is in fact possible), but the DM can altar these numbers if the body is
in a particularly advanced state of decomposition.

Type of         Chance of       Time
Information     Finding         Required        Examples
-----------     ---------       ------------    --------------------
Basic           96%             1 round         Name and profession
Well Known      70%             2-8 rounds      Relating to current
                                                mission
Known           30%             3-12 rounds     Relating to previous
                                                missions
Forgotten       2%              11-20 rounds    Overheard once

This spell will continue as long as the wizard concentrates, but on
every round there is a 1% chance of that he will go insane. The
material component is a pair of metal helmets, linked by a copper
wire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deja Vu (Divination)

Range: 20 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell throws the victim back to the location he or she occupied at
a pont in the recent past. It does not turn back time, it merely
teleports back along the victim's "time line." This restriction makes
the resistance that the magic must overcome much less than a full
"teleport other" spell would have to fight. Deja Vu sends the victim to
the position he or she occupied 1d6 hours in the past per level of the
caster.

If the victim would be placed inside another object or creature, the
victim is placed in a random direction along his or her time line until
an unobstructed location is found. The material component is a
time-keeping device which is destroyed at the time the spell is
memorised by the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enemy Blink (Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 300 yards
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 4-24 creatures
Saving Throw: 

Makes enemy blink if save failed. Otherwise like blink. Good for use if
enemy near cliff or large body of water.

Cannot make people save twice, ie, "I've got 12, I use them all on him,
have him save 12 times".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hand of Time (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VS
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5-8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

After casting this spell, the death master's hand will bear a baneful
curse, for the next creature he touches (possibly requiring an attack
roll) will instantly become 4d10 years older. The spell lasts for one
round per level of the caster or until discharged, and it cannot be
reversed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hold Person II (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 12"
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: one person
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is like hold person except as noted above and that the
saving throw is made at -6.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hydro Shield (Evocation, Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Personal
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the mage appears to be covered in a mist of
water. Variation A is coloured blue or green; variation B is coloured
violet or blue. Any creature striking the spell caster with body or
hand-held weapons will inflict normal damage upon the mage, but the
attacker will take double the damage so inflicted! The other powers of
this spell depend on the variation being used:

Version A: Any electrical attacks will be saved at +2 on the die, and
will do either half damage (if save is failed) or no damage at all (if
save is made). Acid based attacks are normal, but if the mage fails the
required saving throw, he sustains double damage! The material
component for this version is a bit of tree gum.

Version B: Any acid attacks will be saved at +2 on the die and will do
either half damage (on an unsuccessful save) or no damage (if save is
successful). Electrical attacks are normal, but if the mage fails to
make the required save he sustains double damage from that attack.

The material component for this version is an alkylaine substance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Magic Mouth (Alteration)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: one object
Saving Throw: None

Like Magic Mouth but can speak command words to activate magical items,
Stash spells etc. (but can not cast spells).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Greased Pig (Conjuration, Alteration)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature + 1 creature per 4 levels of the caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is a more powerful version of the third-level Haste spell,
with the first-level Grease spell thrown in 
spell is cast upon suffer none of the side effects of the grease (i.e.
they don't drop their weapons, they don't slip, etc.) but those that
try to attack or grab them will.  It negates special attacks by
creatures that inflict damage automatically every round after a
successful hit (i.e. stirges or executioner's hoods) - the creature
must roll to hit every round due to the slipperiness of the target.
Otherwise, it conforms to the normal Haste spell ( -2 on initiative,
double movement rate, double number of attacks per round, ages
recipient 1 year).  It is not cumulative with Haste or other Greased
Pig spells.

The material components for this spell are a bit of butter and an anise
seed for each recipient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Headless Flying Roasted Pig (Summoning, Enchantment)

Range: 60 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell summons a pre-prepared headless flying roasted pig. The pig
flies at a rate of 30, and is under the control of the caster (who must
give it his or her full attention).  The pig is magically funny; anyone
who looks at the pig (except the caster) must save vs. spell every
round that the pig is in his or her field of view or fall down laughing
until the pig leaves.  Laughing victims are at a -2 "to hit" until the
spell expires.

Victims with an Intelligence of 4 or less, and are meat-eaters, will be
attracted to the pig's delicious aroma and must save at a -6 or spend
the rest of the spell's duration trying to catch it.  If they are
vegetarians, they are unaffected.  Those with Intelligences of 5-9 save
vs. the laughter effect at a -4.  Those with Intelligences of 10-14
save at a -2.  Those with Intelligences of 15-19 save normally, and
those who are more intelligent than that are unaffected.

The pig cannot be caught or attacked; those attempting to do so
automatically succumb to the laughter.  The pig has no other attacks
besides its magical nature.  It can be Banished or Abjured; Dispel
Magic merely terminates the caster's control over it.  If the Dispel
Magic is successful, the pig will leave 50% of the time and stay 50% of
the time, the magical laughter effect will not be dispelled, and the
caster will become vulnerable to the laughter's effects.

The material components are a baked, spiced apple and a hummingbird
feather.  Additionally, a pig of no less than 50 pounds must be
beheaded, roasted and otherwise prepared ahead of time; this pig does
not have to be carried with the spellcaster but must not be eaten, as
it is consumed by the spell at the time of casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Morning After (Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Variable
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 intelligent creature 
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell takes effect after the victim has had a minimum of two hours
of sleep.  The victim looses all memory of events that occured between
the time the spell was cast and when he or she awoke.

The victim will remember the existance of any material components used
in the spell.

The effects of the spell last 1D6 rounds per level of the caster.  The
caster should not be told the duration of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jibril's Anti-Magic Shield (Alteration)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

The recipients of this spell are made more aware of the magic around
them and are also more able to affect it. They therefore have a magic
resistance of 5% per level of the caster.  A dispel magic is only half
as likely to dispel this spell.  Note: this spell only effects Mages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Justin's Mental Map (Divination)

Range: 1 mile
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Area of Effect: 1 mile radius
Saving Throw: None

Outdoors only, this spell gives the caster an aerial view of the
countryside within 1 mile of the caster.  Only large features visible
from above are noted, like rivers, woods, fields, large buildings, and
clearings, but not people, caves, small streams, or the like. Material
component is powdered pineal gland.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mimic (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 10 feet per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell forces some humanoid creature in the caster's line of sight
to begin mimicing his actions. The creature's actions will directly
reflect those of the caster, regardless of position or orientation. The
creature will be frozen momentarily at the onset of the spell, but
after that segment of inaction, the creature begins mimicing the
caster.

This can be potentially harmful for the target, if say for example, the
caster waves his hand in the vicinity of his neck, and the target
happens to be wielding a sword.

Once the spell is cast, the caster need not be able to see the target
for the target to mimic his actions. The target does get a second save
if forced to do actions that are obviously lethal, such as the
aforementioned hand waving example. If the target passes outside of the
range of the spell, the spell is broken.

The material component of the spell is a small ivory figurine, which is
broken to bits in the casting of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missile Multiplication I (Evocation, Alteration)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

Missile must be fired within the next two segments. Makes 3-18
missiles out of one. Only normal missiles are affected.

Stuff disappears one round after shooting, but effects stay. A nasty
assassin in my game used the fifth-level version of this spell with
sleep-poison darts to capture a PC.

You have to roll to hit for each missile, by the way. However, if your
first missile hits, you have a +3 on all thereafter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Negative Bolt (Evocation)

Range: 2" + 1/3" per level
Components: VS
Duration: 
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This combat spell projects a bolt of negative energy. Some
practitioners believe it to be merely energy from the negative material
plane... Said Spellcasters are wrong. The spell actually projects raw
anti-matter in a bolt of anti-energy. Materials affected by the bolt
tend to disintegrate and be consumed... Spell wards and defences tend
to dissolve also. Specific defences exist for the genre of spells
similar to this one but they are secrets kept for self-defence.

The bolt only does 1d3 per level of the caster but it also has the
effect of dispelling first and second level defensive spells. Spells
third through fifth need to make a saving throw based on that of the
caster to save and sixth level spells only fail on a 1. Though the
duration of any such affected spell is usually reduced on a ratio to
the level of the spell (GM decision as to what, though I wouldn't
suggest more than 1/2 duration).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Domination (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VS
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: one creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell protects the effected creature from all sorts of domination
attacks. This includes psionics and spells which do domination.

Rathe's Mage Lock (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 portal
Saving Throw: None

The Mage Lock spell is an advanced form of the Wizard Lock spell. There
are two main changes from the latter. First, while the spell is in
effect, the portal cannot be damaged or destroyed by any physical (not
magical) means short of an elemental. Note, however, that magical means
of destroying the door (e.g. Fireball, disintegrate, etc) still work as
normal, and if the door is destroyed, the spell is broken. If the spell
is dispelled or negated by any means whatsoever (even temporarily), the
portal will crumble into dust.

Second, the spell has another application; it can be placed upon an
object. The effect of this is to allow anyone wearing or carrying the
object to open any Mage Locks by the same caster. For example, if one
of Rathe's Mage Locked bracelets was worn, the wearer could open any
door Mage Locked by Rathe (but not by any other mage). The material
component is half a pound of iron filings for the first application and
100 GP worth of diamond dust for the second.

Resist Acid (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the third level mage spell resist electricity
(q.v.), except this spell provides some protection from acid and acid
based attacks. The material component for this spell is an alkylaine
substance.

------------------------

Rhuva's Counter-Scry (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20 yards radius
Saving Throw: Special

The caster will automatically detect any scrying attempt in the area of
effect.  The scryer must make a save vs spells to realise that the
scrying is being tampered with.  If he does not immediately terminate
the scrying, the caster of the counter-scry gets a clear image of the
spy and a general location.  He can cast any ranged spells through the
link at the scryer, who receives all normal saves.  The caster of the
counter-scry can also simply jolt the scryer, causing the connection to
be terminated.  The detection of a scrying attempt will interrupt
spell-casting.  (It is suggested that "detect scrying" be made a second
level spell, with a more limited duration and vaguer description of the
scryer.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rhuva's Tracker (Divination)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: Negates

The mage casts this spell, and hurls a small carved scarab at a target
within range.  A creature or object in a creature's possession gets a
save to avoid the scarab. It clings invisibly to its victim, noticed
only in a determined search.  The caster then always knows where the
victim is (distance & direction), provided it is within one mile per
level, and the target is not enclosed in lead.  The tracker can be
renewed each morning by recasting the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shadow Wall (Abjuration, Conjuration)

Range: 1 yard per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly like Astral Wall, except that it additionally
forbids magical or mystical sensing through the wall. Thus,
clairvoyance, detect spells, mystical detection abilities, a basilisk's
gaze, etc. will not be able to pass through a shadow wall. Other
effects (including the duration increase) are as Astral Wall. The
material component is a piece of paper with a Blindness Glyph of
Warding or Symbol inscribed thereupon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sleep II (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 60 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the first level sleep except as noted. All
creatures to be effected by the sleep spell must be within the 40'
radius sphere created upon completion of casting. The sphere must be
centered on a creature or object within sight and not an area; in
addition the area of effect can not be reduced, although the caster can
specify during its casting that creatures closest to the center be
effected first dependent upon the hit dice of those creatures.

The number of creatures that can be effected is a function of the
caster's level: for every 2 levels of the caster, 1d6 hit dice, rounded
up, can be effected. Example: A fifth level wizard could affect 3d6 hit
dice of monsters. Monsters with 6 + 1 hit dice or more are uneffected.
The center of effect is determined by the caster although the caster
may not be in the area of effect upon spell completion or risk its
effects. The creatures with the least hit dice are affected first
(dependent upon the casters wishes, additionally creatures below a
certain hit dice may be excluded), and partial effects are ignored.
The material components for this spell is a pinch of fine sand and rose
pedals, or a live cricket.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Animal Awareness (Divination, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One animal
Saving Throw: Negates

With this spell, the caster is able to take control any any small (size
Tiny) creature of less than 1+ HD in his line of sight. If the creature
is above animal intelligence, it gets a saving throw versus spells, a
successful save indicating spell failure. The creature is at -4 to save
if the caster has a good grip on it for the duration of the spells
casting. Those creatures of a non-magical nature of less then animal
intelligence do not get a save. Those of a magical nature get a save at
-4.

Once the caster has control of the animal, while concentrating he can
see, hear, etc through the animal's senses. He can also control the
animal's actions, even special movement, such as flying, swimming and
burrowing, although the if the caster attempts to get the creature to
attack something not below itself on the food chain, the animal has a
(75 - minus caster's level) percent chance of escaping the grip of the
spell. While concentrating on the animal, the caster is incapable of
any other action.

The caster can maintain control of the animal up to 100 yards away, per
level of the caster. Those seeing the controlled animal will notice any
strange behaviour it may be exhibiting, if they make the appropriate
perception checks (i.e. INT check, or save versus paralysation). The
spell is broken if the caster ceases concentration, or if the animal
takes more than 4 HP of damage. Otherwise, the spell lasts for a turn
per three levels of the caster (i.e. two turns at fourth, three at
seventh, etc).

The material component of the spell is a bit of food, which the target
animal would find appetising, which is consumed by the caster in the
casting of the spell.

Sonoric's Fly on the Wall (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a spying device out of an ordinary flying insect.
Upon casting the spell upon an insect, living or dead, the spell grants
the abilities of limited clairaudience and clairvoyance, centered on
the insect.  The mage, while concentrating on the insect, can hear any
noise within 15' of the insect. Clairvoyance through the insect,
however, is rather disorientating, and the mage is -2 to hit and AC for
three rounds after breaking concentration. The insect has a flying
movement rate of 6", and its movement is controlled by the
concentrating mage.

If concentration is broken before the end of the spell duration, the
fly drops to the ground, and there is a 75% chance that, if the mage
resumes concentration, it will be too damaged to fly again, although
the clairaudience and clairvoyance will still work for the remainder of
the duration. If the fly takes any damage during the spell, such as
being swatted or stepped on, the insect will no longer fly, but,
provided that at least half of the fly remains, the clairaudience and
clairvoyance will still work.

The material component of the spell is the body of a winged insect,
living or dead, which is slain in the casting of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spirit Skill (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell transfers skills from a specially prepared vessel into a
willing recipient. The material component is a symbol prepared using
Steal Skill, which must be carried by the recipient and disappears upon
completion of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steal Skill (Conjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets a wizard steal the class-related skills of a willing
humanoid victim and transfer them either to the wizard or to a special
container. The victim drops to first level, and regains levels at the
rate of 1 per four hours thereafter. The caster gains 1/2 the
class-related skills of the victim (if stealing from a fighter, the
caster will gain the ability to wear armour and attack with a THAC0
halfway between the fighter's and the default 20 with any weapon with
which the fighter is proficient; if stealing from a thief the caster
will gain thief abilities which are the average of the thief's
abilities and the base of 4; in no case will abilities go down because
of this). Abilities which are granted by a diety cannot be transferred
this way, nor can spellcasting abilities. The transferred abilities
fade after one turn per level.

The material component is a symbol of the class to be transferred,
specially prepared and costing not less than 10 GP per level of the
target. If the caster wishes, he or she may imbue the symbol with these
skills rather than using them at the time (in which case it will not
disappear). The primary purpose of this use is to provide the material
component for Spirit Skill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teleport Trace (Divination)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: S
Duration: 10 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

The wizard casts this spell on a character or creature who is likely to
teleport or employ similar magic in the near future. If the recipient
does cast teleport (or dimension door, word of recall, etc.), then 
wizard who placed the teleport trace will receive a mental image of the
target location. The caster of the trace will then know his location
relative to that of the teleporter, and he will be able to use his own
teleportation or scrying magic with maximum accuracy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time Warp (Alteration)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 40' cube, 1 creature per level
Saving Throw: Special

This is a combined haste and slow spell. At the time of casting, the
caster chooses which application to use. The effects, as well as range,
saving throw, and material components are as per the appropriate
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uldark's Conjured Fireball (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per 2 levels
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell duplicates the 3rd level spell fireball in most respects;
however, instead of shaping the fireball from magical energy as the
evocation version does, this spell actually conjures a ball of fire
directly from the elemental plane of fire.  When the spell is cast, a
small interdimensional connection opens between the plane of fire and
the caster's plane; the fireball enters through this opening and
strikes the targets as directed by the caster.  There is a chance that
an extraplanar creature may enter through the opening as well.  The
chance of this occurring is:  20% - 1% per level of the caster (to a
minimum of 1%).

This spell has the same effects (including damage) as the evocation
version, but it is slightly harder to produce these effects in this
manner; this is reflected in the higher spell level and the reduced
range and area of effect.

The material components for this spell are a piece of flint and a pinch
of sulphur.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uldark's Conjured Lightning Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 40 yards + 10 yards per 2 levels
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is similar to Uldark's Conjured Fireball except that it
conjures a lightning bolt from the quasi-elemental plane of lightning,
instead of a fireball from the plane of fire.  The chance that an
extraplanar creature enters the caster's plane is the same as that of
the Conjured Fireball spell.  The effects of this spell are identical
to that of the normal lightning bolt spell, but the area of effect is
either a bolt 30' long and 10' wide, or a bolt 60' long and 5' wide.

The material components of this spell are a small metal rod and the
skin of an electric eel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vander's Librarian (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 20 yards
Components: VS
Duration: 6 hours
Casting Time: 1 minute
Area of Effect: 1 minor spirit
Saving Throw: None

This spell conjures a minor knowledge spirit to search for books and
references for the wizard.  It can search for titles, specific
references, or general subject matter, finding books in the time it
would take a reasonably skilled librarian (depends on case).  The
wizard is freed to concentrate on more interesting matters, so this
spell roughly doubles a wizard's research efficiency.

5-Mile Carrier (Alteration)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: Special

Extends the range of any other spell up to 5 miles. Can shoot around
corners but not in a zig-zag shape. e.g. you could cast it with
Lightning Bolt to start the bolt on the other side of a hill 2 miles
away, but the size of the bolt is still the same.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Aurora Borealis (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1' per level radius ring
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a sheet of dancing, shifting light to spring up
around the caster, encompassing any area up to the maximum indicated by
the caster's level.  The Aurora will last as long as the caster
concentrates on it (concentration can be maintained while moving at
half-speed, but the caster cannot fight or cast other spells, though
speech is allowed), and for an additional 1 round per level after he or
she ceases concentration.

Any intelligent creature which views the shifting, dancing patterns of
light must save vs. spells or stand fascinated, watching the interplay
of colours and lights (cf. Hypnotic Pattern).  A maximum of 2 HD of
creatures per level of the caster can be so affected.

Any creature actually touching the Aurora will suffer 2-12 points of
damage, +1 point per level of the caster.  Fungoid monsters, undead,
and creatures native to the plane of shadow suffer 2-12 points of
damage, +2 points per level, from the effects of this spell.

The material component of this spell is a clear gemstone or crystal
prism worth not less than 100 gp., a glowworm, and a pinch of
phosphorus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Balefire (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 5' x 30' x 15' cone
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws upon a nearly colourless arcane effluvium from the
Plane of Shadow.  This mystical stuff burns very hot and is extremely
viscous, but rapidly dissolves in the thick substance of the Prime
Material Plane.  Those in the area of effect may attempt a save vs.
breath weapon to avoid being covered in the stuff.  If this save is
successful, they are merely splashed with it.  Even this small amount,
however, is sufficient to cause half damage for the initial round, but
it burns out in that single round.  Those that fail to save and are
struck fully by this ghastly stuff suffer d6 fire damage per two levels
of the caster (rounded up), up to a maximum of 12d6.  The Balefire
clings to these poor victims and continues to inflict damage.  The
damage is reduced by 2d6 each round, and the it burns until all damage
potential is exhausted.  This shadow-stuff burns with a colourless fire
that can only be extinguished by magical means (e.g. Wand of Flame
Extinguishing, Fire Quench, Dispel Magic, or a magical cold spell such
as Ice Storm, Cone of Cold, Wall of Ice, or Otiluke's Freezing Sphere,
although spells involving ice may also cause impact damage to the
would-be rescuee); even total immersion in water will have no effect on
it.  This flame is so hostile to natural (i.e. Prime Material) matter
that it will burn through one inch of wood or soft metal, one quarter
inch of hard metal, or one eighth inch of stone per die of damage that
it would inflict to living targets each round it is active.  Any
individual who is struck fully (i.e. fails to save) must make item
saving throws vs. magical fire for all exposed equipment in each round
that the Balefire clings to him, though these saves are at +1
cumulative for each round after the first.  Occasional dark green or
red flickerings can be observed in an active Balefire.  The material
component is a standard opal (not a black or fire opal) worth at least
500 gp. and a bit of pitch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Blue Blaze (Evocation, Conjuration)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Fan-shaped area 50' long,
                20' at terminus
Saving Throw: Special

By utterance and extending either arm, the caster causes a fan-like
sheet of heated, purplish, acidic vapours and blue flames to leap forth
from his or her outstretched hand.  Any creature in the area of effect
must save twice (once vs. the fire, once vs. the acid) or suffer 1d6
per 2 levels of the caster (rounding up) from each effect.

All exposed items must save vs. acid, regardless of the result of the
save.  Item saves vs. magical fire are only necessary if the a victim
fails his save vs. that effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Incantation of Elemental Domination (Abjuration, Enchantment)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

In the casting of this spell, the wizard must choose one element to
have dominance over.  Elementals of this plane cannot approach within
5' of the caster or attack the caster in any way.  The caster can
forego this protection if desired, and attempt to charm the elemental
(cf. Charm Monster), applying a -2 penalty to the save.  If this is
attempted, than this total ward against elementals is lost.

In any event, any elemental creature (water weird, xorn, etc.) is at -1
to hit and -1 per die of damage when attacking the caster.  The caster
makes all saves vs. their attacks at +2.  The casters own attacks are
at +4 to hit (or -4 to the target's save) and +6 to damage.  He can
further affect any elemental creature with any weapon, regardless of
its level of enchantment.

The caster may converse with creatures of the chosen element, and they
will respect him if alignments are similar, or fear (if the caster
appears strong) or hate and desire to slay (if the caster appears weak)
if alignments are dissimilar.

The spell's association with one element results in a saving throw
penalty to the caster while the spell is in effect, depending on which
element is chosen:

Air     -2 vs. fire;
Earth   -2 vs. petrification;
Fire    -2 vs. water or cold;
Water   -2 vs. electricity.

The material component is a substantial amount (at least 1 cu' foot) of
the element in opposition to the element the caster desires to
dominate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Lightningarmour (Abjuration, Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The subject of this spell cannot be wearing metal armour of any sort,
nor carrying a metallic weapon larger than a shortsword.  Bracers are
permissible.  The creature touched is completely protected from
electrical damage of any sort so long as the spell is in effect.  This
protection is not absolute, having a maximum absorption of 10 points of
electrical damage per level of the caster.  Damage is absorbed by the
Lightningarmour after saving throws and any other protections have been
taken into account.  The creature under the effects of this spell carry
a negative electrical charge, and skin-to-skin contact with another
creature will cause 1d4 electrical damage with no saving throw, as will
contact through a conductor.  Anyone striking the protected creature
with a conductive object must save vs. paralysation at +1 or drop the
object due to temporary numbness in the member holding the weapon.
Those within 5' of of a character with this spell in effect may catch
a faint scent of ozone and feel their hair standing a bit on end.  The
material component of this spell is a bit of copper wire and glass
thread wrapped in clay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Moons of Munnopoor (Invocation/Evocation, Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By the use of this spell, the caster calls upon the magical influences
of the other-dimensional Moons of Munnopoor.  The caster can call upon
the power of one, two, or all three of the Moons.  This spell always
creates an area of light equal to the Moonlight spell, centered on the
caster and moving with him or her.  However, the area of effect is only
50% that of the normal Moonlight spell if one moon's power is invoked,
100% normal is two moons are called upon, and 150% normal if all three
moons are utilised.  This Moonlight has all of the effects of actual
moonlight under a full moon, including effects on lycanthropes.  The
duration of this spell is also determined by the number of Moons called
upon:  if one Moon, the duration is 2 rounds per level of the caster;
if two, it's 1 round per level; and, if all three, it's 1 round per 2
levels of the caster.  Besides the light produced by the images of the
appropriate Moons appearing above the caster, each Moon provides a
specific magic-enhancing effect as follows:

Blue Moon:  All water-related (including fog-, ice-, and steam-related)
spells used by the caster gain a bonus of +1 per die of damage (though
not exceeding the normal maximum--e.g. an Ice Storm spell would inflict
3d10+3 damage, up to a maximum of 30) if the spell causes physical
damage, including the damage caused by summoned water elemental
creatures; applies a penalty of -4 to saving throws and -20% to magic
resistance to targets of spells which cause no hit point damage but do
affect an unwilling target in some way; or increases the duration of
other spells of this genre which do not fall into the above categories
(e.g. Water Breathing, Wall of Fog), doubling duration if a 1st-3rd
level spell, increasing by 50% if the spell is 4th-6th level.

Bright Moon: All spells relating to
astronomical phenomena are affected in the same way that water-related
spells are affected by the Blue Moon.

Silvery Moon:  All mind-controlling and influencing spells used by the
caster apply a -4 penalty to saves and a -20% penalty to magic
resistance checks by targets of such spells.

The material components for this spell are a white pearl or sapphire to
invoke the Blue Moon, a diamond for the Bright Moon, and a silver pearl
or moonstone for the Silvery Moon.  Whatever the combination of moons
invoked, the spell also requires a piece of black velvet along with a
crushed pearl and a crushed moonstone, and a pinch of diamond dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Saint Elmos' Fire (Evocation)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell ionises the air around the target of the spell, surrounding
him or her with a blue-white, glowing nimbus of electrically charged
air in a 5' radius.  The target of the spell may save vs. breath weapon
at -2 to avoid the spell.  This save is at an additional -2 if the
target is carrying large, mostly metallic weapons (e.g. swords, battle
axes) or wearing partial metal armour (e.g.  studded, ring), and at -4
if wearing full metal armour (scale or heavier).  If successful, the
target will suffer only 3d6 electrical damage as he or she dodges out
of the area of effect, and the spell will then dissipate that round
without a focus to coalesce about.  If the save is failed, the victim
will suffer 5d6 damage every round until a save vs. breath weapon
(with modifiers as for the initial save, but with a +1 cumulative per
round bonus) is successful, at which point the spell will dissipate.
Any creature entering the 5' radius nimbus suffers 1d6 electrical
damage with no save.  Any creature that touches or is touched by the
victim of the spell will suffer 3d6 damage with no save if the contact
was skin-to-skin, or 2d6 if it was through a conductor.  If the target
is in water, the electricity will inflict 3d6 damage with any contact,
2d6 within 5', and 1d6 within 15'.  The target of this spell may, if
desired, intentionally try to use the nimbus of electricity and the
personal electrical charge as a weapon.  The caster may end this spell
at any point, if desired.  The material components are phosphorus, a
bit of fur, amber, and a bit of cold iron.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Shooting Stars (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 5' per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates glowing missiles with flaming trails, one for each
six levels of the caster (dropping all fractions).  The victim of the
spell receives no saving throw, and suffers 4d6 damage from the impact
and 8d6 from the fiery blast that accompanies the impact.  All within 5
feet of the impact point are also in the blast radius, but they may
save for half damage.  The original intended target may attempt to save
vs. petrification to avoid being struck, this save at -4 if within 20'
and at -2 if within 40'.  If this save fails, he suffers as above.  If
he succeeds, however, the shooting star(s) directed at him continue on
in a straight line to the extent of their range, at which point they
explode in a fiery burst as above.  Anyone else in the path of the
shooting star(s) must save as for the original intended target, or
become the victim of the spell.  If the caster has more than one
missile, he may direct them at one or several targets as desired.
Anyone within 5' of the path of the missile will suffer 2d6 (save for
half) fire damage simply from the heat of the passage of the shooting
star.  The material component is a bit of meteoric iron and a piece of
igneous rock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Spectral Hound (Conjuration, Phantasm)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: 6 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings into being a quasi-real beast appearing as a war dog
with black fur, gray ruff and tail, milky gray eyes, and insubstantial
paws which make no sound.  The creature will have average (8-10)
intelligence and can converse with the caster in the common tongue.
The creature can fight, attacking as a 2+2 HD monster and inflicting
2-8 points of damage per hit.  It can, however, affect creatures struck
only by magical weapons.  The beast itself is AC 0, and can take up to
half the caster's full hit points (rounding up) before being
dispelled.

The Hound can track any creature known to the caster, provided the
caster concentrates on a mental picture of the figure for 2 full
rounds.  The Hound can follow the trail of such a creature with 100%
certainty, -5% per hour the trail is old.  The Hound also has
infravision to 90', can spot hidden (such as in shadows) things 80% of
the time, invisible objects 65% of the time, and astral, ethereal, or
out-of-phase things 50% of the time.  The Hound normally moves at 12",
though it can run at 24" for 3 rounds each hour.  Further, the Hound
may cross muddy or swampy ground, or even water, as if were solid, dry
ground.  The Hound leaves no tracks.

By concentrating for 1 full round, the caster can make use of the
Hound's sensory abilities for as long as desired, though this does not
allow communication beyond normal vocal range.

The Hound is unaffected by any spells which alter its form (flesh to
stone, polymorph, etc.) or restrict or affect its movement (haste,
slow, hold, etc.).  If a mind control spell is cast upon the creature
and it fails its save (saving throws of the Hound are as for the
caster), then it wills itself out of existence.  It is further immune
to poison and death magics.  The hound will speak only to the caster,
and, if the caster is killed, feebleminded, charmed, or otherwise
mentally incapacitated, then the hound will immediately cease to
exist.

The material components of this spell are three canine statuettes; one
of ivory or alabaster, one of silver or platinum, and one of jet, onyx,
obsidian, or ebony.  These statuettes must be worth at least 200 gp.
each, and, in the course of the spell, the three merge to become the
Spectral Hound.  When the spell ends, the Hound simply fades slowly out
of existence.

Alpha's Star-Powered Magery (Invocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast outdoors under a night sky where stars are
visible.  The spell requires 2 turns to cast for each level of spells
the caster is able to cast (e.g. a 12th level wizard can cast 6 levels
of spells, and so would require 12 turns).  Upon completion of the
spell, the caster's mind and body are refreshed and restored as though
the caster had rested a full day.  1-3 hit points, plus the caster's
CON bonus, if any, are restored if the caster is at less than full
health.  The power of the spell also allows the caster to memorise
spells in one-half the usual time, save for first level spells, which
may be memorised in a single round.  During the lengthy casting of this
spell, the wizard is suffused with a pale white glow, and is fully
aware of things going on nearby.  If the spell is interrupted, either
by being struck by an attack or voluntarily by the caster, then the
effect is wasted and the caster must sleep for spells as usual.  The
material component is a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starshield (Alteration, Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard's body is sheathed in a nearly
skin-tight magical screen.  This screen has the appearance of a black
night sky filled with stars.  Whenever a light-related spell of any
sort is cast at the creature using the Starshield, the spell will be
harmlessly absorbed and redirected back at the caster of the spell.
This includes such spells as Light (if cast so as to blind), Colour
Spray, Sunray, and Prismatic Spray.  An area-effect spell where the
caster is the sole target will automatically be reflected in this way.
Area-effect light spells in which others are also targeted have a
chance of being intercepted and redirected by the caster as above equal
to the caster's chance to negate the spell with a Dispel Magic spell.
The protected wizard will be unaffected by the spell in any event and,
if the spell is successfully absorbed, those behind the caster who
would have been in the area of effec
spell.  By making a successful check as if to Dispel Magic, the caster
may attempt to pass through a Prismatic Sphere or a Prismatic Wall.
Darkness spells (e.g. Darkness 15' radius, Nystul's Blackmote,
priest's Continual Darkness) will also be reflected, just as light
spells are, and the caster may attempt a saving throw vs. death magic
each round to attempt to see through any area of magical darkness
within normal vision range.  If outdoors under the night sky, the
caster can see as if in broad daylight, even through magical areas of
darkness, and also absorbs stellar radiation, regenerating 1 hit point
per round that the spell is in effect.  The material component for this
spell is a black sapphire and a star sapphire, both of which must be
worth not less than 1000 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Wizard Light (Evocation, Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 30' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a pearly-white globe of light equivalent to
Continual Light (q.v.).  Within the area of effect, all shadow and
darkness (even of magical origin) is dispelled, and all hidden or
invisible creatures or objects are outlined in a pale blue radiance
which lasts as long as the Wizard Light itself, even if the object or
creature so outlined moves out of the area of effect.  Further, all
glyphs of warding, symbols, and other magical writings and wards are
revealed, glowing a luminous blue, and the area of effect of such wards
is similarly outlined.  This spell does not reveal astral, ethereal, or
out-of-phase creatures, nor does it reveal purely mechanical traps and
secret doors, although traps or secret doors disguised by or utilising
magic will be revealed.  A mage using the Duo-Dimension (q.v.) spell
would appear as a thin line of blue radiance in mid-air.  This spell
does not reveal what an illusion is hiding nor the appearance of an
invisible creature (except for its outline), but merely reveals
reveals its presence and location.  Hence, a Cloak of Displacement is
useless within the Wizard Light.  The light does not "set off" magical
guards, but it does reveal the form of glyphs and such things for
possible identification and deactivation.  The material component for
this spell is a diamond worth at least 500 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auralon's Deflective Plates (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level (see below)
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Casting of this spell creates up to five glowing, circular plates of
force which hang in the air in a 3-foot radius around the spellcaster.
These plates move to deflect magical energies aimed at the spellcaster
of which the latter is aware. The plates are effective against magical
rays, beams, bolts and missiles from both spells and magic items. The
target of these offensive spells has only a cumulative 15% chance per
plate to be protected against totally accurate spells (such as magic
missile), but a 19% chance per plate of avoiding magic requiring a "to
hit" roll (such as lightning bolt).

Upon impact with the plates, the offensive magic is deflected at full
strength in a random direction away from the target (roll a d4 for
height: 1 or 2=same height, 3 or 4=up; and a d6 for direction relative
to the defender: 1=left, 2=left and front, 3=up in front or back at
rival caster, 4=right and front, 5=right, 6=either straight up or is
absorbed and destroys a plate). The plates can be brought down by
disintegrate or dispel magic, impact with a rod of cancellation or
shatter (destroys one plate), or a limited wish or wish. The plates do
not protect against non-magical attacks or magical attacks of a type
not listed above.

At the end of the spell's duration, the plates disappear two per round
until all are gone. The material components for this spell are tiny
disks cut from 50 g.p. gems, one for each plate to be invoked; the
disks are used up in the casting.

Auralon's Deflective Plates is a spell the wizard Auralon devised in
his spare time while serving under the Mageoclave, and before becoming
a member of that group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blizzard (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 5 feet radius per level (100' maximum)
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a blizzard to hit the area of effect, resulting in
the following: movement rate is cut in half due to drifts and wind, no
missile fire or flying due to wind, and all normal flames are
extinguished. This will negate a heat metal spell, and affects magical
fires as if they had been hit with a Dispel Magic. There are no saving
throws vs. these effects.

In addition, great chunks of ice and snow fall within the area of
effect, causing 3d12 points of damage per round to anyone caught
inside. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to 1/2
the normal amount. The material components required for this spell are
five acorns and any semi-precious gem worth at least 100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bone Splinter (Evocation)

Range: Touch 
Components: VSM 
Duration: 1 round per 5 levels 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 

Once this spell is cast, it will affect a single target that must be
hit in melee by the caster.  The target will suffer a minor bone
fracture when affected by this spell.  If the caster misses, additional
attacks may be made in following rounds, as long as the spell duration
allows.  The spell ends when a hit is scored, or when the duration
expires, whichever comes first.

The wizard uses his/her normal THAC0 with a +1 "to hit" bonus, but must
make a called shot (see The Complete Fighter's Manual for details) to
one of the hit locations listed below; the appropriate "to hit"
modifier must be applied to the combat roll.  Normal attacks are not
considered accurate enough to do any real damage with this spell.

The possible hit locations, along with their combat modifier,
restrictions, and effects are as follows:

                to hit
locat.  mod.    effects
------- ------  ------------------------------------------------------
head    -8      minor skull fracture:
                2d8 points of damage (save vs. spell for 1/2 damage).
arm *   -4      minor broken arm:
                -2 to STR & DEX when using this arm; -2 to hit, or
                shield worthless 50% of the time.
leg *   -4      minor broken leg:
                -2 to DEX when using this leg (i.e.  defensive
                adjustment); movement rate is at 3/4 normal.
ribs    -4      cracked rib:
                loss of 1d4 CON points and suffer 1d6 points of damage
                (no save).
spine @ -8      cracked vertebrae:
                save vs. spell or become paralysed for 2d10 rounds.
pelvis  -4      minor hip fracture:
                -4 to DEX when using legs; movement rate is at 1/2
                normal.

* if attacking from the side, only the nearest appendage may be
targeted.
@ the spine may only be targeted if attacking from the rear.

Multiple hits inflict cumulative damage.  A cure serious wounds will
heal one of these effects, but will not heal any associated hit point
loss (another cure spell is required to do so).  A cure critical wounds
will heal two effects, And a heal will fully restore the victim (unless
dead).

The material components for this spell are a bit of bone and a small
metal hammer, both of which are consumed when the spell is cast.

[author's note:  the requirement for called shots is simply for
convenience; if the DM wishes to compile a hit location chart, then
normal attacks may be used in addition to called shots.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chaos Magic (Alteration)

Range: 5 feet per level 
Components: VSM 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 foot radius per level 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates a sphere that has all the properties of a Forgotten
Realms (tm) wild magic area (see the FR Sourcebook for details).  The
area of chaos magic is permanent until destroyed (it may only be
destroyed as per a wild magic area).  The sphere of chaos magic is
non-mobile.

The material component for this spell is a pint of blood from any
chaotic magic-using creature.  The blood is consumed when the spell is
cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cone of Acid (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is much like Cone of Cold or Cone of Fire (q.v.), except
that it causes acid damage. Damage is 1d4 + 1, per level of the mage.
The material component is one citrus fruit per level of the mage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cone of Fire

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area of fire
originating at the mage's hand and extending outwards in a cone 1/2
inch long per level of the caster. It causes inflammable objects to
catch on fire, and great heat in nonflammable objects. Damage is 1d4 +
1, per level of the mage. For example, a tenth level mage would cast a
Cone of Fire causing 10d4 + 10 points of damage. Its material component
is a red garnet(s) worth at least 100 GP. [cf. Cone of Cold]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deflect Normal Weapon Attacks (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast, this spell creates an invisible, mobile forcefield around the
recipient. This barrier has an armour class of 4 and a number of hit points
equal to 5 times the caster's level. All non-magical melee and missile attacks
made on the recipient, are directed against the shell instead. Damage from
such attacks will not harm the recipient until the wall is destroyed. This
spell has no effect on any magical attacks, which inflict full damage on the
barrier and the recipient.

If an attack hits the barrier, the protected creature must make a
saving throw vs. spell. If this save fails, damage is rolled normally
against the forcefield (if the damage inflicted equals or exceeds the
remaining hit point total of the wall, it is destroyed, but any excess
damage does not affect the recipient at this time). If the save is
successful, the attack is deflected away harmlessly.

If an attack fails to score a hit on the barrier (i.e. misses AC 4),
the attack is reflected back at the attacker; the attacker must then
make normal attack and damage rolls against himself/herself. The
material component for this spell is a powdered black opal which is
consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greenfire (Evocation)

Range: 10" + 10" per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 segment per level
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

On casting the Greenfire spell, a bolt of green luminescence appears
from the mages fingers, and impacts on the target (a made saving throw
means the bolt missed, but it hit somewhere...) from this impact point,
a green sphere begins to grow, at the rate depending on the material
consumed. items in this area of effect must save vs. disintegration
every segment. Items that save halt the progress of the sphere until
they fail their save. Note: the spell expands for a set time, not to a
set radius. so an artifact that continues to save will halt the growth
of the sphere for the full duration of the spell.

Rate of growth:

2" per segment (yes, 20 feet) in air alone: (not an airial weapon), but
as soon as it hits something solid, it will take a segment to consume
it.

1' per segment in air/solid mix (cliff face, floor, person).

1/2' per segment in just rock (ordinary rock gets no save).

1/12' per segment in water (but draws everything to it like a Sphere of
Annihilation).

Note I: The sphere begins at a 1' radius, and does not appear until the
bolt either strikes something solid or reaches maximum range.

Note II: the point of origin of the sphere remains constant, even if in
midair.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-Energy Lightning Bolt (Evocation)

Range: 4" + 1" per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

Like Lightning Bolt but does 1d8 damage per level, maximum 20d8.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Fire Ball (Evocation)

Range: 20 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

As its name implies, this is an improved version of the third level
Fireball spell. It has one of two applications as chosen at the time of
casting: the first option mimics the Fireball spell in all respects
except that damage is 1d8 per level of the caster (up to a maximum of
10d8) and saving throws are at -1.

The second version of the spell has a 10 feet radius instead of the
normal 20 feet. Due to this reduced area of effect, damage is increased
to 1d10 per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d10) and saving
throws are at -2. It is like a Fireball spell in all other respects.

The material components for this spell are a pinch of sulphur and a
fire opal of not less than 200 GP in value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Armor Reversal (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell reverses the effects of armor worn (or lack thereof) on the
subject touched, in the sense that melee attacks that would have
normally hit the subject will miss, and melee attacks that would have
normally missed the subject will hit.  For example, an AC 5 mage that
has cast Armor Reversal on himself is attacked by a 10th-level
fighter.  The fighter would normally need a 6 or better to hit AC 5;
with this spell in effect, the fighter needs a 5 or *less* to hit AC
5.  Note that this spell is more useful as the amount of armor the
subject has on decreases!

All bonuses "to hit" that the opponent has work in the opponent's
favor, i.e. if the aforementioned fighter had a Strength of 17 (+1 "to
hit") and a +2 weapon, these would be *subtracted* from the die roll -
thus the fighter would need an 8 or less to hit AC 5.  Likewise,
penalties are added to the die roll, penalizing the attacker as usual.

This spell does not affect missile weapons at all, nor does it affect
spell saving throws or anything other than melee weapon attacks.  If
the subject of the spell is willing to have the spell cast upon
him/her, there is no saving throw; otherwise the subject saves as
usual.  The spell can be counteracted by the usual means (Dispel Magic,
et al.), by another casting of Armor Reversal, or by the 7th-level
spell Jamye's Improved Armor Reversal (q.v.).

The material components of this spell are a small magnet and a diamond
of not less than 100 gp value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Greased Lightning (Evocation)

Range: 40 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell differs from the third-level Lightning Bolt spell in the
following ways:

- the components and casting time are greatly reduced;
- damage done is d4+2 per caster level instead of d6;
- maximum damage is 15d4+30;
- the bolt is a vivid orange, with green "stripes" running through it.

It conforms to Lightning Bolt in all other respects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kalessin's Long Arm (Conjuration)

Range: 20 feet
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to cast various spells requiring physical
contact at range. The caster must have a clear view of the creature to
be "touched", and there can be no obstructions between target and
caster.

To use this spell, the caster first casts Long Arm, then whatever spell
he wants to do at range, in the following round. If the caster is
disturbed following the casting of Long Arm, the spell is ruined.
Disturbance could be anything from heavy jostling, to actually taking
damage. If the target moves out of sight before the caster can get off
the second spell, the the spell is ruined.  The target gets regular
saving throws for the second spell.

The material component of this spell is a jade tipped wand, which
disappears after casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meillikhom's Room of Seclusion (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 week per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 10' x 10' area
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can create an extra-dimensional room (5'
cube per level) with one side adjacent to an unbroken 10' x 10' area
(i.e. one that has no doors, windows, or other such openings).  The
surface area (which must be touched) now acts as a phase door into the
secluded room. The room can be of any shape and size up to the limit of
the spell but at least one side must be at least a 10' x 10' area.
Thus, the room could be rectangular, pyramidal, hemispherical, etc. The
room lasts for 1 week per level of the caster, or until dispelled.

The caster may bring any item, materials, etc. as he or she desires
into the room, so long as the object can fit through the phase door and
is touched by the caster (and only by the caster).

At the end of the spell's duration, anyone or anything still within the
room is now trapped in that extradimensional space. escape is only
possible through other extraplanar travel. This also occurs when a
dispel magic or similar magic is cast against the phase door area.

The phase door itself is detectable by any means available that can
detect magical auras, but the room itself can only be contacted through
extraplanar means. Spells such as clairvoyance and clairaudience would
not detect the ext
on the other side of the phase door surface.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missile Multiplication II (Evocation, Alteration)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

Missile must be fired within the next two segments. Makes 3-18
missiles. Unlike the fourth level version, the fifth level version of
this spell will multiply "abnormal" missiles, like poison darts,
Ballista bolts, catapult rocks and other such things. All other effects
are similar to the spell of fourth level. The possibility of using
lethal poison is at the DM's option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rathe's Contingency Trigger (Alteration)

Range: 3 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: up to 1 cube foot per level
Saving Throw: Special

The Contigency Trigger functions identically to the third level Rathe's
Trigger spell, with one exception: a condition may be applied to the
triggering of the spell (for instance, "trigger only if a man wearing
green enters the area", or "trigger if anything made of gold enters the
area"). Note however that the spell's "perception" is restricted to the
area of effect. The spell cannot perceive intangibles such as class,
level, or alignment. The material component is as the Rathe's Trigger
spell, but must be worth twice as much.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rhuva's Wizard Stomper (Divination, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 4 hours + 10 minutes per level
Casting Time: 5 minutes
Area of Effect: 10 yards per level
Saving Throw: Special

Designed to prevent the casting of spells in the area of effect, the
wizard stomper produces a nearly uncontrollable surge of energy into a
wizard who attempts to draw power for a spell.  The victim must save
vs. spells at -6.  Failure means the spell is aborted and the caster
takes 1d6 damage per level of the spell attempted.  If the save is
made, the spell can be cast at +1 on all damage dice, but at double
normal casting time.

If a wizard has been stomped before, and knows what to expect, the save
is only at -3.

Material component is a handful of ruby dust worth at least 25 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Illusionary Observer (Divination, Illusionism/Phantasm)

Range: 100 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: One turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates the illusion of a creature, up to Medium in size,
through which the caster gains the advantage of a clairaudience and
clairvoyance spell. The caster must determine the appearance of the
illusionary observer, during the casting of the spell. If it is a
creature the caster is not familiar with, observers of the illusion are
at +4 to notice it as such. If the caster has an accurate drawing or
carving of the illusionary subject, observers are at -4 to spot the
illusion. Those successfully noticing the illusion see it become merely
become translucent, it does not disappear. The illusion is incapable of
making any sounds, and is completely insubstantial, even if someone
touching it is unaware that it is an illusion.

The illusion has a movement rate of 30", and it is capable of passing
through solid objects, all save lead, the touch of which cancels the
spell. The caster must carefully concentrate on the illusion (i.e.
incapable of other action) to use the clairaudience and clairvoyance
powers, as well as keeping the appearance realistic. If the caster
breaks concentration for some reason, the illusion freezes in whatever
position it was in, until the caster resumes concentration or the
spell's expires.

The material components for this spell are a bit of fleece, and a
humanoid eye and ear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summon Warrior (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 40 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Within one round of casting this spell, the wizard conjurers 1d3
warriors to aid him/her. The summoned warriors will be of a level equal
to 1/2 the level of the caster (rounded down) up to a maximum of
twentieth level. They will perform as per monsters summoned by monster
summoning spells. Note that in certain, circumstances, adventurers may
be summoned (who will recall the details of their trip). The warriors
will appear anywhere within the spell range as desired by the caster.

The type of warrior summoned is as follows:

caster's level  fighter ranger  paladin
--------------  ------- ------  -------
15 and under    70%     20%     10%

component for this spell is a dagger of the finest quality, which is
consumed when the spell is cast.

Taint Alignment (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Special
Components: 
Duration: 1 day per level or special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: one humanoid creature on the same level of existence
                as the caster
Saving Throw: Special

Taint alignment has similar effect to a character as performing a deed
opposite to his/her alignment, except that this one shows. Casting it
requires knowing the Truename of the target, which knowledge can be
obtained by other magic. Casting the spell causes the target to make a
saving throw vs. spells with a penalty of 2 on die. If (s)he makes it,
the spell rebounds on the caster, who shall also have to save, but with
a bonus of 2 on die. The spell shall rebound between the two regardless
of distance until one fails a save, or both have made three saves, in
which case the spell fails. An affected TN character would get a random
alignment of the corner 4.

Effects vary depending on the alignment of the victim. If the affected
is a paladin, the effects thus far taken for granted are reversed:
laying on hands would cause damage, detect evil turns into detect good,
remove fear effect into cause fear. Yet, the paladin might have no idea
what's happening until he tries to ride his mount or draw his Holy
Avenger +5. For an anti-paladin, the same goes, reversed. A cleric
would instantly lose the ability to acquire spells, though not his/her
spell casting or scroll reading ability.

For any character, there's a number of standard effects:

- Know Alignment shows the reversed alignment.

- Detect Good/Evil work as for the new alignment.

- Bad dreams.

- Problems with other people. The Good emit fear, the Evil get liked,
Law be approached with caution, Chaos be felt as a sign of
responsibility.

- Temples of one's own religion feel bad.

- Temptation to truly switch alignment fully, which would have the
certain standard effects described in DMG, such as losing a level of
experience. a change in alignment can be felt by people in contact with
the affected. Not definitely, but more in the "I feel something's
wrong"-manner.

The curse cannot be magically removed with anything less than a Limited
Wish, until the time is full. Of course, the target wouldn't know that
the effect isn't permanent..

If a sign of faltering from the original alignment is done, then the
effect does become permanent. Slight faltering causes prolonged
duration, as the energy of the spell isn't as seriously tried as it
might be.

Tonguetwister (Alteration, Abjuration)

Range: 10 feet/level 
Components: VSM 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 target 
Saving Throw: Negates

When this spell is cast on an enemy spellcaster, it will cause the
target's tongue to twitch violently, thus disrupting any spell being
cast at the moment, unless the victim makes a successful save vs.
spell.  The level of the spell being cast by the target determines the
modifier applied to the save as follows:  save modifier = spell level -
5 (i.e. a 2nd level spell inflicts a -3 to the save, a 7th level spell
earns a +2 to the save, etc.).

The victim must be in the process of casting a spell with a *verbal*
component.  If no spell is currently being cast by the target, the
Tonguetwister has no effect.  If the opponent's spell goes into effect
at the same time as the Tonguetwister, the victim earns an additional
+2 bonus to the save.  This spell cannot affect a spell that has
already been cast, nor one that is to be cast in the future.

The material component of this spell is a tongue of any creature; this
is consumed when the spell is cast.

5' wide by 8' tall. The second door is invisible. Living matter up to
400 pounds or non-living up to 800 pounds may be transported from the

Range: 150 miles
Components: VS
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Caster + (-7000 GP + 1000 GP per level) additional weight
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to teleport himself and -7000 GP + 1000 GP
per level of additional stuff that he is carrying to a specified
destination at most 150 miles distant. The chances of error are the
same as for normal teleport, except that if the caster would normally
end up is a solid object, the spell will abort. The maternal component
is a map of the destination, which is not consumed.

Alpha's Firefountain (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to the 4th level Alpha's Firefall spell, but is
more powerful in two ways.  First, the spray of liquid fire burns for a
total of three rounds, inflicting 3d6 damage the first round, 2d6 the
second, and 1d6 the third.  There is no saving throw vs. the damage
inflicted by the spray.  Second, the caster is able to throw up one
prominence of flame (for 4d10 fire damage the first round, and 2d10 the
second, with a save vs. breath weapon to halve damage) for every six
levels of the caster (rounding off all fractions).  The material
component is a lump of pitch, sulfur, saltpeter, and magnesium and an
available fire source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Rainbow Warrior (Evocation, Summoning)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell invokes energy and the spirit of a creature from the Quasi-
Elemental Plane of Radiance.  The Rainbow Warrior has as many hit
points as the caster would at full health, and attacks as a fighter of
half the caster's level.  The Warrior has an armour class of 0, and can
only be struck by magical weapons.  It attacks with a spear of
radiance, which causes damage the same way as the 2nd level Rainbow
Beam spell if the target is struck.  As with that spell, the caster has
a 5% per level chance of selecting the colour of the spear, otherwise it
is random.  The Rainbow Warrior may fly at a movement rate of 24, but
it has no real substance and cannot touch nor carry any material
object.  Creatures dwelling on or drawing power from the Negative
Material Plane or Plane of Shadow suffer 1d6 damage every round that
they are within 20' of the Rainbow Warrior, as it sheds a bright globe
of light strongly infused with energy from the Positive Material
Plane.  The Rainbow Warrior is unaffected by poison, paralysis,
petrification, fire, electricity, gas, or acid.  Unholy water causes it
2d4 damage, and cold attacks do full normal damage.  Negative energy
attacks gain a bonus of +1 per die of damage, and any spells involving
darkness cause the Rainbow Warrior 2d6 damage per level of the spell,
though the darkness spell will then be dispelled.  Any darkness spell
coming into contact with the 20' globe of light surrounding the Rainbow
Warrior must be checked as if Dispel Magic was being cast at the level
of the summoner of the Warrior.  Only one such dispelling attempt is
possible for each darkness spell that could be affected, although the
Warrior can automatically dispel any darkness spell by touching the
area of effect, but it will suffer damage as if the spell had been cast
specifically at him.  Dark-dwelling creatures (e.g. drow, duergar) are
affected by the Rainbow Warrior's globe of light as they would be by
Continual Light.  The material component of this spell is a clear
diamond worth not less than 5000 gp.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starlight Citadel (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 30 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast in an area under star- or moonlight.  When
cast, it brings into being a deep blue-black tower of magical metal,
with many faint silvery gleams.  This tower is in all respects similar
to a Daern's Instant Fortress (q.v.) except that it grows slowly during
the course of the casting, and so no creature able to move could
possibly be harmed by its expansion.  The door to the Citadel is Wizard
Locked at the caster's level.  One creature for each level of
experience of the caster may be designated in the casting of the spell,
and such creatures may freely open the door, though the caster may
override this at any time by mental command.  The magic of the walls of
the citadel prevents the passage of any creature ethereal, astral, or
out-of-phase creature.  Teleportation into and out of the tower is
still possible.  This spell lasts until the first rays of direct
sunlight strike the tower, but it cannot last longer than 2 hours + 1
hour per level of the caster in any event.  The material component is a
star sapphire and a small steel carving of a tower.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Block Teleport (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 100' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell prevents anyone from teleporting into or out of the area of
effect while the spell is in effect. It will not effect homing teleport
spells (e. g. word of recall). It will also not effect gates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coradon's Cataclysmic Corinary (Invocation/Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: Touch 
Components: VS 
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels 
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special 

After this spell is cast, the wizard must make a successful attack in
melee to affect the target.  The wizard's normal THAC0 is used with a
+2 modifier to hit.  The spell will last until a hit is scored, or
until the duration expires, whichever comes first.  If a hit is made,
the victim suffers a massive heart attack and must make a successful
system shock roll or die.  Even if this roll succeeds, the target
suffers damage equal to 1d4 + 1 per level of the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copyright (Divination, Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 day
Area of Effect: 1 spell
Saving Throw: None

Cast before starting spell research. Spell can not be researched except
with permission of one who researched the spell or by the use of a
Limited Wish. A full Wish enables learning & ability to teach others
(variant of Secrecy spell). If mage dies, require speak with dead to
get permission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Ghast (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2 hours
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates up to one ghast per six levels of the caster, and
these ghasts will follow the commands of their creator to the best of
their ability. Each ghast is formed from the corpse of a human slain by
a ghoul or ghast who has not yet risen as a ghoul itself. These corpses
are the material components of the spell. As implied above, humans
killed by a ghast will rise as ghouls to follow the pack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hold Person IV (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 12"
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 5 people is a 20' radius circle
Saving Throw: Negates

This is like hold person except as noted above and all saving throws
are made with no modification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Wiley's Door (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is like that of Wiley's door except that there is no limit
to the amount of stuff that can be transported (except for the physical
problems of getting that much stuff through the door) and the second
door can be up to 20" distant. The second door must be somewhere that
the caster has seen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Justin's Skimmer (Evocation)

Range: 20 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1/2 hour per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 skimmer
Saving Throw: None

An improved form of Tenser's floating disc, the skimmer is designed as
a flying vehicle for the caster.  The wizard reclines in a molded seat
at the centre of the 3' radius disc.  The "wings" each have room for
one person, or a comparable volume of cargo.  It can lift 50 pounds per
level of the caster.  The skimmer can move at speeds up to 25 miles per
hour (this approximates move 70), and has maneuverability class A at
speeds less than move 21.  The caster is protected from acceleration,
passengers are not.  When stopped, the skimmer can rotate on a dime.
The caster has full cover from below.  The skimmer can take 5 HP per
level of the caster.  Ramming, it does (move/3)d6 damage to both itself
and the target.  Only the caster can control the skimmer; it hovers
motionless if he is unconscious.  The skimmer is a stable casting
platform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kalessin's Spell Load (Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster is able to "store" one spell for every
three levels he possess (i.e. two at fourth, three at seventh, etc).
The caster "paints" the spells around himself as runes, in effect,
casting them, a process taking one turn per spell. The spells are now
"hung" around the caster, and can be released by command, an action
taking one segment.

If the caster concentrates, glowing runes representing the remaining
spells in the load will appear about the caster, visible only to the
caster. The caster must specify in the casting of the load what the
verbal or somatic commands are to be for the release of each spell. The
caster also determines the appearance of each representative rune.
Detect magic will reveal the presence of the spell load, and True Sight
will allow the caster to see the rune representations of the spells in
the load.

A spell load gets two saves versus a Dispel
gets the mage's saving throw versus magic, and if that fails, it has a
100% chance of being dispelled, minus 5% for each level the spell load
caster has greater than that of the dispel magic caster.

Releasing the spells by command takes only one segment for initiative
purposes, and the caster can release two spells per round, although, if
two spells are released, there is a (50 - caster's level) chance that
the load spell will be broken, and they will all go off. No more than
six spells can be set into a spell load.

Material components are a diamond tipped stylus, worth at least 1000
GP, and an amount of molten gold, with which the runes are painted. The
gold is consumed in the casting of the spell, but the stylus is still
usable. The runes are visible to all during the casting of the spell
load, and they flare briefly when the spell they represent is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lich's Palm (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VS
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: one creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell actually grants the caster the ability to use the normal
attack of a lich. The mere touch will cause 1d10 damage of cold and be
paralysed (save applicable).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lorth's Stasis (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VS
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell was designed as either a sort of temporal stasis effect, or
as a way of removing enemies without killing them. The creature touched
is placed into its own extra-dimensional space, where no time passes.
After one turn for each level of the caster has elapsed, the creature
will be returned to the Prime Material plane in exactly the same state
it was when the spell is cast (including location).

If an object has been placed in the location from which the creature
was sent, the subject will be displaced the shortest possible distance
in any direction consonant with emerging in open space. For instance,
if the tunnel has collapsed since the spell was cast, the creature
might be displaced a few tens of yards up to the surface of the earth,
if this is the shortest displacement that will allow the creature to be
placed in an open area. However, if there should happen to be a cavity
in the debris blocking the tunnel, the subject would most likely be
deposited there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mage Lock (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This powerful dweomer causes the sealing of a thing with far greater
effectiveness than that caused by a Hold Portal or a Wizard Lock
spell.  The Mage Lock can only be cast on certain things:  Boxes or
chests made of iron, steel, or harder metals, or on doors made of the
same and set into a wall at least as hard as hard stone.

When the Mage Lock spell is cast, the Wizard chooses a single person -
other than himself - who is to be able to open the sealed box, chest,
or door.  When the spell is done the item is sealed and only the
individual who was named in the casting will be able to open it.  The
item will be unaffected by Knock spells, Chimes of Opening, or similar
magics, and will have a Magic Resistance of 25% with regard to other
magics, and a +2 on all saves.

If the person named in the spell should die before the item is opened -
for the spell holds only until the item is opened once - then the item
cannot be opened by anyone until the caster of the spell is dead.  If
the item has not been opened by the time both the wizard and the person
named die, the Mage Lock dissipates.

The material components of this spell are:  A diamond, worth no less
than 5,000 gp, 4 small iron cubes, and a drop of blood from the person
to be named in the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mass Teleport (Alteration)

Range: 1' radius per level
Components: V
Duration: 
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This spell is basically a higher level of the fifth level Teleport
spell. The main difference lies in the amount of mass that can be
transported by the caster. In addition to the caster, 1200 pounds per
level over level 10 may be transported. Basically, this spell is for
bulk rate transfers of material. The range simply refers to the maximum
radius outward from the center of effect (usually the caster) that
people and things can be to be teleported.

This was a very popular spell with parties of adventurers that had
lots of money to spend on transportation... As such, the mages who
could cast this spell tended to charge through the nose for it... It's
not an easy spell to find since it is very, very useful... Of course,
it's just a matter of time before somebody else (or a group of others)
break into the action by researching a similar spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minor Accursed Rite (Necromantic)

Range: Touch
Components: 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: one living creature, not necessary humanoid or even mammal.
Saving Throw: Negates

Turns victim into an undead, type selected randomly wight, ...,
vampire, partially controllable by the caster. Risky: each command
given is a chance for the victim to become fully a free undead of the
type, unless the caster also is a member of the same type of undead.
Free - until controlled by a spell, of course. The change takes place
over a period of two weeks of gradually worsening illness in which time
the spell can be dispelled by a Dispel Magic, Cure Disease, and Heal,
cast in any order any time during the two weeks, not necessarily one
straight after the other.

Note: the spell can create some quite weird undeads, such as vampire
snakes. Controlling requires a common language and sufficient
intelligence on the part of the target. The spell in itself doesn't
modify stats such as intellect, even if the undead strength of 18/00 on
a vampire does apply to non-humanoids as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retroactive Dispel Magic (Abjuration, Alteration)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

Lets you actually cast Dispel Magic to counter a spell thrown at you!
If you have the spell, you can cast it at any spell or spell effect
thrown that round, even if you have been killed or turned to stone, by
the vagaries of initiative and the like. It is assumed that you were
casting the Dispel Magic as the other spell was being cast. Acts as
Dispel Magic for chance of success based on level.

For example, you have Esmeralda cast Polymorph Other, which is lots
faster than Dispel Magic. She has Initiative all over Glamgon, the PC.
He declares that he wants to cast retroactive Dispel Magic, so
effectively as Esmeralda was gathering power for her spell, Glamgon was
trying to drain it away. Glamgon had better succeed, lest he truly
become a toad (the outcome of the polymorph other should Retroactive
Dispel Magic not succeed).

Note that this spell cannot be cast by a specialised Abjurer or
Transmuter, since it (also) belongs to his or her opposite school.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff of Light/Darkness (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the magic-user creates a powerful magical
weapon which only he can wield. Magic-users of Good alignment can
create a Staff of Light; those of Evil alignment, a Staff of Darkness;
and those of Neutral alignment (with respect to Good/Evil) can create
either form of the spell, but with reduced effectiveness. The verbal
component of this spell consists of but a single word, which creates in
the magic-user's hand a sphere of light (or darkness) a few inches in
diameter; the remainder of the casting time is then spent carefully
pulling and shaping this sphere into a full-sized staff. Spell duration
is considered to begin on the following round, so that the caster can
make at least as many attacks as he has levels.

The glowing Staff of Light will brightly illuminate a 30' radius, and
when cast by a Good-aligned magic-user this illumination will be
painful to supernatural Evil creatures such as undead, demons, devils,
etc. (these take 2 hit points of damage per round, saving vs. spell
each round for half damage). A Darkness spell cast in the area of the
Staff of Light will eliminate this painful effect for the duration of
the Darkness, but does not actually make the area dark, though the
illumination is reduced to the level of dim torchlight.

Whether cast by a Good or Neutral magic-user, the Staff of Light
strikes as a +2 weapon (for purposes of what can be hit by it; there is
no actual to-hit bonus) and does a base 
damage can be increased by 1d6 for each round of spell duration that
remains; every such increase shortens the duration of the spell by one
round. Intent to increase damage must be stated before the to-hit die
is rolled, but spell duration is not affected if the attack is a miss.
If the Staff of Light is used to strike a creature with a strong
Negative Material existence (wights, spectres, xeg-yi, etc.) there is a
50% chance that the remaining spell duration will be expended as damage
whether or not the caster wishes it.

The Staff of Darkness sheds deep shadows in a 30' radius, through which
only the caster can see clearly; Shades (the monster) and other
magic-users using Staff of Darkness spells are at -1 to hit when within
these shadows, and all others (even with infravision) are at -3 to hit
and +3 to be hit when in these shadows (note that two magic-users
within 30' of each other and each holding as Staff of Darkness will
both be at -1 to hit, but the effects of multiple staves are not
otherwise cumulative).

In addition, when cast by an Evil-aligned magic-user, this sphere of
shadow will affect supernatural creatures of Good alignment (shedu,
lammasu, devas, etc.) as if they were affected by a Stinking Cloud
spell (saving throw vs. magic reduces the effect to mild nausea, -1 to
hit and damage; this penalty is cumulative with the -3 to-hit penalty
for poor visibility). A Light spell cast in the area of the Staff of
Darkness will remove this nauseating effect and reduce the to-hit
penalty to -1 and the to-be-hit penalty to +1, but will not
significantly brighten the area.

The staff of Darkness strikes as a +2 weapon (for purposes of what can
be hit), doing 1d6 points of damage. For each round of spell duration
that remains, the caster can choose to inflict numbing cold on his
victim; this cold has a 5% chance per round of spell duration expended,
cumulative, of causing loss of use of a limb for 1d6 rounds, and
otherwise causes the victim to lose one point each of strength and
dexterity per round of duration expended, also for 1d6 rounds;
thereafter the lost strength and dexterity return at the rate of one
point each per round, or the limb becomes usable immediately.
Cold-resistant and cold-using creatures get a saving throw against this
effect, and its duration is halved for them in any case.

If the areas of radiance/shadow of a Staff of Light and a Staff of
Darkness intersect, the effects of both are negated in the overlapping
region. If the staves are within 30' of one another, both cease to shed
their light/darkness, but their powers are otherwise unaffected.
Neither Staff has any physical substance, and thus cannot be parried
except by another Staff of the opposite type or by a Rod of Force; a
Wall of Force, Forcecage, or similar force barrier will stop a Staff.
If two Staves of opposite type touch one another for any reason, both
are destroyed in an explosion of 40' radius causing 1d6 points damage
for each round of duration remaining in the two spells, cumulative. The
mages holding the Staves automatically take full damage, all others
within 40' save vs. spells to take half damage.

The material component of this spell is a pearl (a black pearl for the
Dark version) of not less than 500 GP value, which is held in one hand
when the command word is uttered. The pearl is transformed into a small
sphere of light or darkness; the somatic component is the stretching
and molding of this sphere into a staff. There is rumoured to be a
variant of this spell that allows the sphere formed from the pearl to
be hurled as a missile, but the specific details have been lost.

Teleport Trap (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 10 yard per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: Negates

All people or things teleporting in the area of effect are, upon
materialising, effected as if a paralysis spell had been cast upon them
(as in players handbook). Thus a mage wishing to leave sneak into a
place decides to teleport there.  He doesn't realise that a Teleport
Trap has been cast however around the spot he wishes to appear.  Upon
arriving he must save vs. spells or be paralysed.  Those leaving an
area under this spell will also be paralysed whereever they appear.

Material components are a gem of not less than 5000 gp worth smeared
with the ichor of some paralysing agent (ghoul's skin, etc).

                        Seventh Level Spells

========================================================================

Chaos Environment (Alteration)

Range: 1" per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly the same as Chaos Vision except that the
environment actually is changing uncontrollably.  The ground constantly
rolls and twists, objects from the casters mind appear and disappear.
All creatures in the environment are constantly polymorphing.  Note
that creatures polymorphed will need to save vs spells each round to
keep their former identity and not take on a new one.  All damage from
being crushed, attacked, and otherwise affected by the spell are real,
caused by real creatures and aberrations in the area.  I usually give
1d6 of damage/round due to constantly being battered and thrown.  DM's
can give whatever they like however as needed by the alteration that
caused the damage.

A person entering this environment had best carry nothing with him or
risk loosing it as it turns into some form which might not be
carryable.  People have to constantly make System Shock rolls every
turn also for the stresses will eventually tear even the mightiest hero
apart given time.

The material component of this spell is a Wild Magic area, which is
consumed by the spell.  The area of effect fills the area previously
formed by the Wild Magic area.

The one Chaos Environment in my campaign was formed to protect an
artifact that caused as much harm as good.  A lesser magic item would
have eventually been destroyed by the constant polymorphing and
impacts.  All objects will revert to their original form if they can
get out of the area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Mummy (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4 hours
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates one mummy from the corpse of a human of at least
seventh level fighting ability. The mummy follows orders to the limit
of its low intelligence, but it must remain within one mile of its
place of origin, so it is primarily useful only as a guardian. The
corpse of the potential mummy must be properly embalmed with the
appropriate proficiency (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Undead (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting time: 1 day
Area of Effect: One human corpse
Saving throw: Special (see below)

The material components of this spell are a human corpse (killed within
3 days previous), myrrh (500 gp worth) and a special balm made of
certain rare herbs, personally prepared by the necromancer. Ingredients
for this balm cost 500 gp, and one uninterrupted week spent by the
spell caster. The balm only stays good for 3 days.

This spell forces back the soul of the corpse, and turns it into either
a wight, a spectre, or a wraith. The caster has a percentage chance
equal to his/her level x 2 of choosing which is created. Otherwise,
roll on the following table, adding the level of the caster, plus a 5
bonus if the caster is a necromancer specialist. Also, if the corpse
was a 0-level person, subtract 30 from the roll (if the adjusted roll
is below 0, the spell fails and the corpse is destroyed).

1-60    wight
61-90   wraith
91-00   spectre

The corpse gets a saving throw vs. magic, at a level equal to the
corpses level before death, with the following bonuses:

person was good                 + 4
person was neutral              + 1
person was a not-good cleric    + 2
person was a good cleric        + 4

If the save is made, the corpse is destroyed and the spell fails. If
the save is failed, the undead is created. Said undead will be under
the control of the necromancer for one year, following any order that
is not obviously suicidal. At the end of the year, or upon such time as
the undead receives a suicidal order, it is freed from the
necromancer's control and gets a save vs. magic. If it fails, it must
leave and may never attack the necromancer unless attacked first. If it
succeeds, it becomes free-willed, and might attack the necromancer if
it was sufficiently mistreated.

Note that after the year is up, the undead may continue to serve the
necromancer, if it was sufficiently prosperous and receives a
sufficient bribe. This is a GM call.

A necromancer can only control 1 undead in this matter at a time. At
the end of the year, or when the undead dies or becomes uncontrolled,
the spell may be used again. Should this spell be used during the year,
it will work, but the fresh undead will immediately attack the
spellcaster.

Finally, a created undead starts out the same alignment as the corpse
from which it came. However, due to what these creatures must feed on
(i.e. people), an unstoppable shift begins towards the undead's normal
alignment. There is a 10% chance per month (cumulative) of the
alignment decaying one step. After a switch, the chance returns to 0
and begins building again.

Deflect Magic Weapon Attacks (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the fifth level spell deflect normal weapon
attacks with the following exceptions: the forcefield's AC is 2 and it
has 7 hit points per level of the caster. It affects all attacks made
via a magical or non-magical melee or missile weapon. A non-magical
weapon cannot affect or penetrate the barrier in any way. If a magical
weapon strikes the barrier, the target's saving throw (to determine
penetration or deflection) has a penalty applied to it equal to the
bonus of the weapon (i.e. a +2 weapon that scores a hit on the barrier
inflicts a -2 penalty on the protected creature's save). Also, if a
magical weapon is reflected back at the attacker (when the barrier is
not hit), the weapon bonus is not applied to the reflected attack.

In addition to its other powers, this spell may affect magic missile
attacks. It does not automatically negate them as a shield spell does,
but causes the attacker to make a "to hit" roll vs. the barrier. If the
attack succeeds, the barrier automatically takes damage (the recipient
earns no save); if the attacker fails to score a hit, the magic missile
has no effect. Other spells will pass through the barrier, without
affecting it. The material component for this spell is a powdered
black sapphire which is consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Delayed Blast Snowball (Evocation)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 2" radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a snowball (q.v.) with +1 on each of its dice of
damage. The spell will not release its burst for 1 to 50 segments
(1/10 to 5 rounds), according to the command upon casting. In other
respects, this spell is the same as the third level spell snowball [cf.
Delayed Blast Fireball]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eye of the Beholder (Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

In order to cast this spell, the wizard must have in his/her
possession, an eye stalk from a beholder. The stalk is pointed at the
intended victim(s), and after the incantations are complete, one of 10
possible effects shoot forth from the eye stalk towards the target(s).
The exact result (including saving throws, range, duration, etc.) are
determined at random from among the 10 functions of a beholder's eye
stalks, as given in the Monstrous Compendium. The eleventh eye
function (anti-magic ray) is never one of the spell results.

The only material component for this spell is the eye stalk, which is
used up when the spell is cast. In order to achieve different effects,
an eye stalk from a spectator, gauth, or an eye of the deep may be
substituted for the beholder's stalk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Flesh to Toast (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell turns the flesh of any creature affected into a golden-brown
piece of hot yummy toast.  Only the victim is affected; anything the
victim may be wearing (or non-organic items ingested) will not be
turned into toast.  The resultant toast is subject to any forces normal
toast is subject to (slicing, buttering, eating, whatever).  One cubic
foot of toast will satisfy the appetites of four humans, although they
may get tired of toast way before then.

The material components of this spell are a small pat of butter or
cream cheese, and 1 foot of steel wire.  The steel wire will not be
consumed in the casting.

Note that this spell is not reversible.  The effects can only be
countered with a Wish or Limited Wish spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Improved Armor Reversal (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level, minus 7 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is an improved version of the fifth level "Jamye's Armor
Reversal" spell.  With this spell, bonuses "to hit" by the attacker are
added to the die roll (thus working against the attacker) instead of
subtracted.  For example, a 10th-level fighter attacking an AC 5 mage
with Improved Armor Reversal would need a die roll of 5 or less to hit
the mage; if the fighter had a Strength of 17 (+1 "to hit") and a +2
weapon, she would now need a die roll of 2 or less (5 minus 1, minus 2)
to hit the mage.

This spell also affects missile weapons in the same way it affe
melee weapons, unlike the fifth level spell.  Also, whereas Armor
Reversal can be dispelled by a subsequent casting of Improved Armor
Reversal on the same subject, Improved Armor Reversal cannot be so
dispelled by the weaker spell.  If Armor Reversal is cast upon the
subject of a previous Improved Armor Reversal spell, the Armor Reversal
spell is wasted and has no effect.

The spell components for this spell are a small magnet, a piece of
black silk of no less than 20 gp value, and a diamond of no less than
250 gp value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Llewllynn's Wall of Force (Evocation)

Range: 1" to 3"
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10 square feet per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is equivalent to the fifth level mage spell wall of force
(q.v.) in all respects save one: the caster is able to manipulate the
force wall. The following variations are possible:

Version 1: The mage can cast the wall in a hemispherical or spherical
shape around himself with himself as the centre point. The mage can
then move about and the wall will move with him. This version is tinted
red.

Version 2: The mage can cast the spell as a wall (2-dimensional
barrier) and then move in a direction with the wall moving 1" to 3" in
front of him. The wall will always be in front of the caster, and will
turn as he turns. This version is tinted blue. Note that this version
cannot be cast horizontally.

The material component for version one is a pinch of diamond dust and a
pinch of ruby dust. The material component for version two is a pinch
of diamond dust and a pinch of sapphire dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Quench (Alteration, Abjuration)

Range: 5 feet per level 
Components: VSM 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 foot radius per level 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates a sphere that has all the properties of a Forgotten
Realms (tm) dead magic area (see the FR Sourcebook for details).  The
area of dead magic is permanent until destroyed (it may only be
destroyed as per a dead magic area).  The sphere of dead magic is
non-mobile.

The material component for this spell is a pint of blood from any
recently slain magic-using creature.  The blood is consumed when the
spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mind Find (Divination)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This is an extremely powerful version of true sight combined with a
form of clairvoyance. Like true sight, it allows the caster to exactly
locate people that are: displaced, invisible, polymorphed, change,
enchanted, or illusioned. However the spells effects the mind, not the
eyes of the caster, so the caster can in addition see through fog,
around corners, trees, etc. (anything within 100' radius).

About the only things that will block the penetration power are the
Non-detection spell (non-detection gets a save to see if the mind find
worked on him), Lead walls, or walls of force. The spell also confers
the ability to perceive minds in 360 degrees on all axis, X, Y AND Z.
Thus the caster could locate the mind of someone 80 feet above then and
behind them, needless to say backstabbing someone who knows exactly
where you are is impossible.

However, this spell cannot locate object or things without minds, thus
it could locate anything that had less than zero intelligence. The
drawback to this spell is that it makes the caster susceptible to
mind-effecting spells i.e. save at -2.

The material component of this spell is a whole mind flayer brain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearthia's Spell Vortex (Evocation)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

Once this spell is cast a faintly visible 7-10 foot tall vortex appears
around the caster, centered on his feet. The vortex is a container for
spell energy. It can store up to 1 spell level per level of the
caster.  The caster may place any spell he wants into the vortex. He
also has a chance equal to his magic resistance of catching a spell
cast at him with the vortex.

After the spell's energy is stored in the vortex, the caster may use
the energy to fire other spells from the vortex. He may only fire
spells he has "taught" the vortex though (the ones HE put into the
vortex).  Shooting a spell from the vortex may be accomplished once a
round, plus one may be fired at anyone who cast a spell at the Mage
that round. The caster may do anything except spell casting and still
be able to fire all his spells each round.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearthia's Combat Spell (Abjuration, Alteration, Divination)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This spell prepares the fighter/mage for combat. It provides the
benefits of the following spells:

Strength        Detect Invisibility
Shield          Minor Globe of Invulnerability
Fly             Protection form Normal Missiles

It also provides 25% magic resistance and 4 temporary fighter levels.
(ie +4 to hit and 40 hit points). This spell can only be cast by
fighter/mages (or tri-classed with both classes).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prismatic Beam (Abjuration, Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 7" long plane, 11/2" wide at end, 1/2" wide at base
Saving Throw: Special

Like Prismatic Spray but all 7 rays hit the same target. Great for
zapping dragons, demons etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stash (Alteration)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

Stores a large mass in hyperspace for an indefinite period of time
until a command word is spoken. The object(s) in hyperspace do not
experience passage of time so for example a small army with all its
weapons and equipment could be stashed in time of peace and recalled
when war started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summon Wizard (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 50 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Within one round of casting this spell, the caster summons 1d2 wizards
to aid him/her. The summoned wizards' level will be equal to 3/4 the
caster's level, rounded down, up to a maximum of twentieth level. The
wizards will appear anywhere within the spell range as desired by the
caster, and will serve the caster as per monsters summoned via a
monster summoning spell. There is an 80% chance of summoning a mage,
and a 20% chance of summoning a specialist (determine school randomly).
Equipment and abilities are determined randomly. The material
component for this spell is an ornately carved, gem-encrusted, wooden
staff (worth at least 100 GP), which is consumed when the spell is
cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zandare's Twist (Alteration, Enchantment)

Range: 10' per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

By means of this spell the caster changes the target creature,
effectively, inside out. The organs are outside the body and the skin
is inside. GM's insert your own really graphic descriptions here... The
spell caster must have a small leather pouch for the casting.  At the
end of the seven segments the caster thrusts his hand into the bag and
violently pulls the bag inside out.  Now the target is either painfully
turned inside out, or the caster looks like a total fool.  The spells
affects one medium size creature or two small creatures.  Large
creatures receive a +3 to their save.

Note that clothing, armour, etc. are in the inside also.

                        Eighth Level Spells

========================================================================

Jamye's Spell Reversal (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level, minus 10 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell affects the saving throws vs. spell of the subject in much
the same way that the fifth level spell Jamye's Armor Reversal (q.v.)
affects attack rolls, i.e. saving throw results that would normally
indicate success will fail, and results that would normally fail will
succeed.  For example, a 19th-level mage normally needs a 6 or greater
to save vs. a spell.  If he is affected by a Spell Reversal spell, he
will need a 5 or less (i.e. a failure under normal circumstances) to
save vs. a spell.  Protection devices, Wisdom bonuses, etc. all work to
the benefit of the subject, i.e. if the above mage had a Ring of
Protection +3 and a Wisdom of 16 (+2 magical defense), he would need an
8 or less to save vs. most spells (5 normally, +3 for the Ring) and a
10 or less to save vs. spells that would give him his Wisdom bonus.
Likewise, penalties to saving throws still work to the detriment of the
subject.  If the subject is willing, there is no saving throw;
otherwise, a normal save vs. spell (obviously, this is made before the
spell takes effect) will negate it.

There are certain special cases that apply to this spell.  It is not
affected by Spell Turning.  The only thing that can dispel it is
another Spell Reversal cast at the subject, who must make a save while
under the influence of the original Spell Reversal.  If the subject is
under the influence of another spell that grants invulnerability to
certain spells (Shield vs. Magic Missile, for instance, or any type of
Globe of Invulnerability, but *not* Anti-Magic Shell), the subject
takes full, maximum damage from that spell with no saving throw.  For
instance, a mage has both Shield and Spell Reversal cast upon him.  If
he is targeted for Magic Missiles during the time both spells are
functioning, he will take 5 points of damage - the maximum possible -
from *each* Missile that hits him.

The material components for this spell are a piece of amber worth no
less than 300 gp, and a doughnut made less than 24 hours previously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Life Leech (Necromancy) Reversible

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: +

This spell allows the death master to steal 2d6 years from a victim and
add them to his own life. The victim must be human and of a level equal
to or greater than that of the caster. If the victim is of lower level,
the number of years transferred is multiplied by the victim's level and
divided by the necromancer's. Since the victim must be in the center of
a pentagram at the completion of the casting, it is useful to have him
held or immobilised in some way. The reverse spell works in the same
fashion, except that the caster ages 2d6 years while the recipient
becomes younger. In either case, the material components are a black
candle, a white candle, a drop of blood from both parties, and a
specially prepared glass screen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-Range Carrier (Alteration)

Range: 100 miles per level
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: None

Long-Range Carrier is like the 5-Mile Carrier but the range is 100
miles per level of caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lorth's Sending (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: VS
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature per 2 levels
Saving Throw: Negates

The Sending spell was created by Lorth the Traveller as a more
versatile form of the Teleport spell. When the spell is cast, one
creature for every two levels of the mage (rounded down) is Sent to a
place defined by the caster as for a Teleport spell (the caster must
have a mental image of the place). The creatures must be touching the
mage, but "chains" are possible. The mage does not have to accompany
them, but he may if he so desires. There is no chance of error for
this spell.

If any of the creatures "sent" is harmed within 5 minutes of arrival,
all of them will be bounced back to the place from which they were Sent
(whether they want to go or not). Any damage incurred during those five
minutes, to themselves or their equipment, is erased. Note that this
does not allow the spell to be used as a quick and easy messenger
spell; anything dropped during the five minute grace period is returned
with its owner. This can be used as a fail-safe teleport. After the
five minute period elapses, the spell expires and the "protected"
individuals are on their own. The Sending will not work across planar
boundaries. Unwilling creatures receive a saving throw vs. magic to
resist this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1" diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the fourth level Minor Globe of
Invulnerability (q.v.), except with regards to casting time. This spell
prevents the function of first to fifth level spells passing through
and affecting the mage within the sphere, while allowing the mage to
cast spells through it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power Link (Necromancy)

Range: 10 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell creates a link between the caster and the victim through
which magical energy can flow. Thus the wizard can cast spells centered
on the recipient, as if he were a projected image. Also, the wizard can
route malevolent spell side-effects, such as magical aging, to the
victim. The material components of the spell are a chip of jet, an
herbal tea of spearmint and devil's dung, and a wooden disc. The
recipient must be an intelligent, living native of the wizard's home
plane.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stargate (Alteration)

Range: Infinite
Components: 
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

This spell creates a gate between the caster's current location and any
location which the caster has seen before. The gate can be freely
crossed in either direction and will last one hour per level of caster.
Range is not an issue (hence the name of the spell).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summon Wraith (Conjuration/Summoning, Necromancy)

Range: 10 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 10-foot cube
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to the fifth-level spell summon shadow, except
that it conjures up one wraith for every three levels the death master
has attained. These monsters are under the control of the wizard until
they are slain or until the spell expires, but if the wraiths are
turned, they continue to serve in any capacity which does not require
them to confront the cleric who resisted them. The material component
is a bit of jet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teleport Block (Abjuration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1000 cubic feet per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell prevents teleportation into or out of the region specified
by the caster, which may be of any shape and any size, up to 1000 cubic
feet per level of the abjurer. No character can enter or leave the
region by means of dimension door, teleport, or other-planar travel.
Teleportation within the region is not restricted, and teleport without
error has a chance of success equal to 1% per level of the caster,
though it has the same chance of failure as a regular teleport
attempted under normal conditions. A full wish will also provide
transportation across the boundary, as of course will walking, riding,
and flying.

Any attempt to teleport or dimension door across the block will
automatically fail; all memory of the spell will be lost; and the
caster must make a system shock check or be killed by the shock of the
rebound. Attempts at transplanar travel will also fail, but not in so
dramatic a fashion. The material component is a glass globe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teleport Warp (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10 yard per level radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes all creatures teleporting into or out of the area of
effect to arrive in a prepared area.  The area which the caster wishes
people to appear in must also be in the area of effect.

The space the caster wishes incoming teleporters to arrive at must be
open area, free from objects.  It can be in the air however, causing
incomers to fall.  Should a person teleporting into an area effected by
this spell be larger than the area he would be sent to, then he is
effectively blocked and would not be able to teleport at all to the
area.

Example:  Archmage Istle casts Teleport Warp on his tower.  He wishes
all people who unexpectedly arrive to be placed in his dungeon cell
which is 10' x 10' x 10'.  The cell is also in the area of effect, at
the bottom of his tower, which totally is under the spell.  Thus a
person who teleports to his tower will arrive in a dungeon cell instead
of the wizards guest chambers.  If Golstein the Chaotic decides to send
his 18 foot tall iron golem over to Istle's bed chamber, he will find
the

All forms of teleport magic are affected, thus Dimension door, Pattern
teleports and the like also would be warped.  This is a great spell for
the mage wishing to 'blockade' an area from outside aid coming in short
of all out planar travel.

Material component is a lodestone which must be placed in the location
the caster wishes teleporters to arrive.  It is consumed upon casting.

Bone Shatter (Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per 5 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This is a more powerful version of the 5th level spell Bone Splinter.
It is identical to that spell except that is has a +3 "to hit" bonus
and causes a serious compound fracture when a hit is scored in melee,
with the following results:

        to hit
locat.  mod.    effects
------- ------  -------------------------------------------------------
head    -8      major skull fracture:
                save vs. spell or die; else suffer 4d8 points of damage
                (no save for 1/2).
arm *   -4      major broken arm:
                arm is totally useless; it cannot be used to attack or
                defend with.
leg *   -4      major broken leg:
                leg is totally useless; movement is 1/2 normal.
ribs    -4      broken rib:
                loss of 1d6 CON points and 2d8 points of damage (no
                save).
spine @ -8      severed vertebrae:
                save vs. spell or die; else paralysed until
                healed/cured.
pelvis  -4      major hip fracture:
                -6 to DEX when using legs; movement rate is at 1/4
                normal; suffer 3d8 points of damage (no save).

* if attacking from the side, only the nearest appendage may be
targeted.
@ the spine may only be targeted if attacking from the rear.

A cure critical wounds spell is required to heal one of these effects
(except for paralysis, which must be cured by normal means) as long as
the victim is still alive, and a heal spell will fully restore a living
victim to full health.

The material components for this spell are an intact bone of at least a
foot in length, and a large metal hammer which are consumed when the
spell is cast.

Damians Mindswap (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 7"
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates

When this powerful enchantment is cast, the spell user attempts to rip
the target creatures soul from its body and temporarily place it in a
gem of not less than 15000 GP. At the same time the casters soul is
eased from his body and also travels through the gem. When, and if,
both souls are in the gem, they both proceed to the opposed bodies from
which they came. You'll note that this has two very noticeable
effects:

1) the caster and victim have essentially swapped minds (or bodies,
whichever you prefer), this has the effect that the caster now takes on
the physical attributes of that body (i.e. STR, CON, DEX and COM). The
caster still retains his own mental capacities and previous knowledge
(i.e. INT, WIS, CHR, hit points and level).

2) If the caster or victim can kill their old body (i.e. their swapped
body) then the others soul goes to its respective plane. Thus, after
completion of the spell, if the caster kills his old body then he can
never be displaced from his new, for in all intents and purposes it is
his body now. If neither is killed and at some later point in time a
cleric casts an exorcise spell at either body (both have to be within
7" of each other though) the caster of the original Mindswap must save
vs. death or return to his old body.

If the save vs. this spell is made it indicates that this persons body
will never accept the casters soul and need never fear this spell from
the same caster again.

Demonic Immunity (Abjuration)

Range: 
Components: 
Duration: 
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: 

Requires a demon's amulet of at least a type one demon. Renders you
invulnerable to all demonic powers. Does nothing for physical
attacks. You cannot be telekinesed, you cannot be charmed by a demon,
their unholy words don't affect you, etc. No demonic powers can harm
you.

The tougher the demons amulet, the longer it lasts, casting time one
round, amulet is destroyed, duration can be split between people.

Type 1, lasts 4 rounds. That's one round for 4 people, etc.
Type 2, lasts 6 rounds.
Type 3, lasts 8 rounds.
Type 4, lasts 12 rounds.
Type 5, lasts 20 rounds.
Type 6, lasts 50 rounds.
Any "named" demon, lasts 100 rounds.

Ding Shu's Marvelous Chopsticks (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 120 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell functions only in campaigns which use the optional rule
concerning hovering at death's door. It brings into existence a pair of
huge chopsticks, 30 feet long, which attacks all targets with the
caster's THAC0 as if they were AC 10 (dexterity modifiers do apply,
however). Victims weighing more than 2 tons are immobilised by the
chopsticks, while lighter victims are actually swept off their feet and
may be deposited, within the same round, at any point in the spell's
range. Those who successfully roll to bend bars manage to free
themselves, but they may suffer falling damage as a result.

Most probably, the caster will choose to deposit his victims in a
gargantuan mouth which appears above his head. This mouth can hold one
creature of size L, two of size M, or four creatures of size S. Each
round it "chews" its contents for 10 points of damage each, until they
reach a hit point total between 0 and -10. At this point it "swallows"
them into the astral plane, and is prepared to receive another victim.
Normally, persons reduced to such a hit point score would die in a
matter of minutes, but in the timelessness of the astral plane, they
may remain unconscious but barely alive for thousands of years.
Naturally, the material component is a pair of chopsticks.

Ding Shu's Draconian Holocaust (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 60 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 900 to 5400 square feet
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell has the same effect as a swooping Celestial Dragon, spewing
forth its fiery breath. The spell affects all within a swathe 30 feet
wide and from 30 to 180 feet long. All victims within the area of
effect receive 130 points of damage, reduced by 10 for every 30 feet
beyond the first 10. Thus a 180 feet swathe would inflict but 80 points
of damage to each character within it. Casting requires the scale of a
fire-breathing dragon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fenzill's Phantasmal Fingers (Necromancy)

Range: 40 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 target
Saving Throw: None

This spell is an enhanced version of the second level spell spectral
hand; it differs from that spell in the following ways: it can be used
to deliver a touch spell of any level and it gives a +3 to the attack
roll. It has an AC of -4, but it cannot be destroyed by any attack (it
may only be dispelled). Instead, any hit on the hand inflicts full
damage on the caster (although a successful save vs. spell reduces this
damage by half). The caster may end the spell with a single word.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Genocide (Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: 5 yards/level 
Components: VSM 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 9 
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius 
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell allows the caster to kill one or more creatures of the same
species; the caster chooses a creature as the initial target for the
spell, and after the incantations are complete, a black bolt shoots
forth from the caster's finger towards the chosen target.  If this
creature makes its saving throw vs. spell at -2 (or if it has 15 or
more HD) there is no effect and the spell terminates.

If the save of the initial target fails, the creature dies, and the
spell continues as follows:  if there are no more creatures of the same
species within the area of effect, the spell ends at this point.
Otherwise, the bolt will continue jumping to other targets. The bolt
jumps randomly from one target to the next; range is not a
consideration - as long as the target is in the area of effect, and it
is of the appropriate race, it may be hit by the bolt. Each creature
that is hit with the bolt must make a successful saving throw vs. spell
(with no modifiers) or die.

This spell will affect a number of hit dice equal to: 10 HD + 1 HD per
level of the caster (the number of creatures is not a factor). The
spell will terminate when one or more of the following occurs: the HD
limit is exceeded, there are no more potential targets in the area of
effect, or the bolt strikes a target with more than 15 HD (such a
creature is unaffected by this spell).  Each target hit with the bolt
counts towards the HD limit, whether its saving throw was successful or
not.

The bolt will never jump to a creature of a different species, or to
one that has already been hit (whether living or dead). Any creature
with more HD than the original target will not be affected by the bolt,
but its number of HD is still counted towards the HD limit of the
spell. If a target's HD would exceed the limit of the spell, it is not
affected (and the spell terminates).

The bolt will never jump back to the caster; in addition, the caster
may choose individuals to be unaffected by the spell simply by naming
them as part of the incantations (usually used to avoid killing friends
or allies).

Note that some races are closely related, but are not considered
identical species for purposes of this spell (i.e. goblinkind).
"Half-breeds" will be affected by this spell if either of their
parent-race is targeted, as well as when the cross-breed is
specifically targeted. However, if a parent-race is named as the
target, a half-breed of that race earns a +2 to its save. For example,
a half-elf is affected normally if hal
of this spell. They would also be affected if either humans or elves
were targeted, although they would gain a +2 to their saves in the
latter two cases.

After this spell is cast, the wizard must make a successful system
shock roll or fall unconscious for 1d10 rounds. Note that the DM may
wish to inflict other penalties on the caster due to loss of blood (see
material components below), especially if the spell is cast more than
once is a short period of time.

The material components of this spell are a pint of the caster's blood
and a figurine/statuette of the race to be targeted. The blood is
consumed at the time of the casting, and the figurine is also
destroyed, unless the caster makes a successful save vs. spell.

Lazzaro's Murderous Sword (Enchantment)

Range: 50 yards
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a version of Mordenkainen's sword, but with a twist. This
spell causes a shimmering aura to form around any sword. This sword
will then arise and be at the command of the spell caster. He may order
to attack, defend, guard, or whatever. The sword can respond to
moderately complex tasks like, "Let no one through this door unless
they say the word, ixitayal."

In combat the sword hit any AC on a 19 or 20, it has the same hit
points as a fighter of the level of the caster (18 con), has the same
AC as the caster, and fights like a fighter of the same level (i.e. 2
attacks per round, THAC0 whatever). It attacks as if wielded by someone
with an 18/00 strength (+3,+6). It also has it's own bonuses; it
requires a magical sword as material component. If the sword has any
special abilities these will also be used in the combat.

The sword acts independently of the caster (obviously) and requires no
concentration to maintain. However the caster must remain with 50 yards
of the sword or it falls to the ground, inert (with magic drained from
it). The ways to defeat the sword: render the caster unconscious, hit
it for loss of hit points, encase it in something, or successfully
dispel it.

As discussed above the material component is a magical sword, the magic
of which is consumed after the spell ends (gives high level mages a
reason to collect all those magic swords and destroy them in the
process). The other material component is a gem with the soul of
fighter trapped in it. This gem becomes embedded in the sword during
the spell. Each time the gem is used, it has a cumulative 5% change of
shattering, freeing the poor soul inside. Obviously the gem is not
consumed after the spell ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lichdom (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3 hours
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the wizard saves vs. Death. If he fails, he
becomes a lich, otherwise he dies. Should he be raised or resurrected,
he can try again. This spell makes clear why a wizard has to be 18th
level to be able to become a lich.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lorth's Translocation (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VS
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Lorth's Translocation is a the most advanced teleport-class spell ever
devised. Given a description of any sort, the caster is able to place
himself at the specific location. The description might be a detailed
mental image, a verbal description, a painting, "Thirty feet due east",
"The center of the room in which stands the Sceptre of AshkaMankh", or
anything else sufficiently precise. If there does not exist a location
such as the one described, nothing will happen. If the description is
insufficiently precise ("A field of grass", "The center of a forest"),
the spell will have no effect. If the location does exist, then the
caster will be placed there, no matter where it is.

This spell can transport the caster to any plane, any distance. Note
however that it is very, VERY difficult to describe a specific place in
planes such as the Astral or the Ethereal, due to the lack of good
landmarks. Of course, if there should happen to be a solid object in
the place described, the caster is slain instantly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Swarm (Alteration)

Range: Special
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The magic swarm spell is both a very potent, and a very unstable
spell. With this spell, the wizard may bind up to three attack-type
spells (those that cause any type of damage) together into one spell.
The caster begins the incantations of the magic swarm and then "loads"
the spells to be bound into the swarm (this effectively casts the
spells - the proper components are required, and the loaded spells fade
from memory; the magic swarm is the "target" for these spells). The
wizard then finishes the binding process by continuing the incantations
of the swarm. This entire process takes two turns plus the casting
times of the spell(s) to be bound.

When the magic swarm is actually cast, the bound spells are released
simultaneously (this has a casting time of 3). However, due the
unpredictable nature of this spell, there is a chance that some of the
bound spells may not function normally. At the time of casting, the DM
rolls 1d3; the result is the number of spells that work properly - the
remaining spells fizzle and are lost (the spells go off in the order
they were bound, so it is important to keep track of the order).

Due to the extreme exertion required to cast this spell, the following
penalties/stipulations are placed on its use:

- only one magic swarm spell may be memorised in any two day period.

- after a magic swarm is cast (actually cast, not after binding), no
further spell casting is possible for one turn (10 minutes).

- after the spell is cast, the caster temporarily loses 1d4
constitution points; if this brings the wizard's constitution score to
zero or below, a system shock roll must be made; if this roll is
failed, the wizard dies, otherwise he/she falls into a coma until
his/her constitution is restored to a positive value; it takes one hour
of rest to restore one constitution point lost in this manner.

- if the magic swarm is not cast in one hour per level of the caster,
the caster must make a saving throw vs. spell; if this save fails, the
swarm will discharge will full effect, centered on the caster (1d3 is
still rolled to determine how many spells actually go off and how many
fizzle); if the save is successful, the magic swarm simply fades from
memory and is lost (along with all bound spells).

The material component for this spell is a bag of holding (which
effectively "holds" the spells in the bound state). When the spell is
cast, the bag is destroyed unless the caster makes a successful saving
throw vs. spell at -2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mental Ledger (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell actually enables the wizard to record spells in an unused
portion of his brain, just as he would in a spell book. He can record
three spell levels per wizard level, and he must re-cast mental ledger
every time he wishes to change which spells are recorded. The material
component is a diamond worth at least 5000 GP. Casting time is one hour
per spell per level added to or deleted from the ledger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mezzalldam's Choking Fist (Evocation)

Range: 3 yards per level
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a disembodied hand similar to those of Bigby's
Hand spells, except it is much smaller (about the size of an ogre's
hand).  It will attack as directed by the caster (no concentration is
required to do so - the wizard simply chooses the target).  The hand
does not automatically hit, but will attack using the caster's THAC0,
with a +2 "to hit" bonus.

If a hit is scored, the fist closes tightly around the victim's throat;
it will continue squeezing until the target is dead, or until the hold
is broken.  Once per round, the fist's lock may be broken by making a
successful bend bars roll (the victim has a 10% penalty applied to this
roll); only one person may do this each round, due to the small size of
the hand.  Other party members who try to free the victim must devote
their entire attention to this for the round (i.e. no other action may
be taken, DEX bonuses to AC are lost, etc.).

Each round the victim is choked, a system shock roll must be made; each
additional round (pas
roll.  If this roll fails, the victim fall unconscious and if the hold
is not broken the following round, the victim dies.  While a victim is
being choked he/she may perform no other actions (other than breaking
the fist's hold) - all the target's efforts are required to fight the
effects of the constriction.  The fist will continue attacking until it
is destroyed/dispelled, or until the spells' duration expires; the
caster can also end the spell with a single word.

The fist may be destroyed by direct attack; it has an armour class of
-2 and as many hit points as the caster at full health.  The fist will
also break its hold on a victim every time it loses half its remaining
hit points.  Note however, that attacking the fist while it is choking
a victim is dangerous; if an attack on the fist fails to hit, another
normal attack must be immediately rolled against the victim, inflicting
any damage normally.  If the fist's hold is released or broken, it may
be attacked without fear of hitting companions.  If the fist is not
choking a victim, it may be attacked by anyone who beats the wizard's
initiative roll (or by anyone, if the fist fails to score a hit that
round).

The material components for this spell are a bit of bone and skin from
any constricting snake; these components are consumed when the spell is
cast.

Nuke (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: 
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 
Saving Throw: None

Creates a thermonuclear explosion of 2 kilotons power per level of
caster. Range is zero so unless used with one of the Carrier spells is
a suicide weapon.

Sarius' Endosmotic Zone of Magic (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: VSM
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell was researched by Sarius Mendlekine, Lord of
Telnorne.  It is actually used to create a magical rod (3' long and 1"
in diameter) that projects a continual zone of increased magical
potential in a spherical area of effect equal to a radius of 1" per
level, extended outward from the rod in all directions.  This spherical
zone makes magic function at its utmost effectiveness, normally.  But,
it can be used to travel to planes with reduced magical factor ratings
(MF) while keeping a MF rating of 0 within the area of effect.  On
planes with an increased MF the spell simply allows all spells of
9th-level or less to work optimally.  The zone will permeate any area
which is not totally enclosed in a lead casing or protected by an
anti-magic shell which withstands the dweomer.  All anti-magic shells
or effects that come within the zone react as though a dispel magic is
cast upon them each and every round.  Every round the two areas
interact the anti-magic zones have a chance of dispelling as though a
mage of four levels higher than the caster were trying to `Dispel
Magic' against them.  On  planes with a negative MF rating, everything
within the area of effect operates as though the MF rating were 0.  So,
someone with a ring of flying would fly within the zone, but exiting it
would cause them to drop like a rock!  On a negative MF rating plane
anti-magic shells are dispelled at the normal level of mastery or the
spell-caster and all spells cast by any class of characters, whether
native to the plane or not, operate at a normal MF rating of 0.

The spell's duration (from activation of the rod) is equal to a base 1
day per level in a Prime Material plane with a MF rating of 0.  On
negative MF rating planes, the duration is calculate as the total
number of whole days left for the rod to operate divided by the result
of the MF rating multiplied by -1.  For example, a 20th-level mage
activates the rod and hurriedly enters a gateway to an alternate Prime
Material plane with a MF rating of -5 (since the spell must be
initially cast on a plane with a MF rating of 0 or better).  The
duration would be determined thus: 20 days/(-5 x -1) = 4 days.  But, if
the mage had operated the rod (for more than 1 turn) before entering
the gateway it would have lost a days duration and be calculated as:
19/(-5 x -1) = 3.8 days, or 91.2 hours, or 547.2 turns, or 5,472
rounds.  If the wielder had travelled to a plane with a MF rating
greater than 0 the spell's duration would be calculated as the base
duration multiplied by the MF rating of the plane.  Whenever the rod
changes alternate Prime Material planes (even if they both contain the
same MF rating) its duration is recalculate with the current remaining
days of operation left used as the base for determining the duration of
the spell (disregard any remaining duration that does not equal a day
or more in length).  If the rod travels from a positive MF rating plane
to a negative MF rating plane the rod is totally disrupted in the
transferral as though the spell had ended, and vice versa.  Dispelling
magics will only affect the rod for one single round unless they are
cast by a Demi-Power, Lesser Power, or Greater Power, in which case the
a successful `dispel magic' will cause the device to become disrupted
as described below.

The rod is the only material component of this spell.  It is made from
the purest mithril and rune inscribing agents (costing at least 7,000
gp).  Then, 9 deep blue amethysts (1000 gp each) are inset to the side
of the rod among the various runes of power, and a large sapphire
(1,000 gp) is affixed to the top.  Once the rod has been fashioned (2
months creation time minus 1 day per level of mage working on the
inscribing of the runes down to a minimum of 1 month) this spell can be
cast upon it, empowering the rod with enormous magical potential.  From
this point, the rod remains dormant until its power is activated by
speaking the proper command word and willing the rod to function.
Until the rod is activated the casting mage loses a single 9th-level
spell casting slot because of the bond that he has established with the
rod's dormant power.  While this spell could be inscribed onto a scroll
it would still require the rod as a material component and the mage who
inscribed the spell would not regain the spell slot until the potential
of the scroll was released through copying it into a spellbook or
casting it onto the rod and activating the rod.  (Note: An apprentice
may be used to inscribe the runes upon the rod freeing the learned
master to further research).

Although almost any sentient creature may utilise the rod, in the hands
of the original spell-caster it will convey a personal magic resistance
equal to his level of experience (and cumulative to any other magic
resistance he may be employing).  On any Prime Material plane the rod
will also act as a Rod of Striking, conveying a +3 magical to hit bonus
and striking for 3d6+3 points of damage per round.  The rod may only
strike once in any melee round no matter if the creature wielding it is
capable of multiple attacks with weapons.  During the last turn of the
spell's duration the rod will begin to hum extremely loud (hearable in
a 1/2 mile radius.  During the last round of the spell's duration the
rod will glow with extremely powerful magical electricity, causing 1d20
hit points of damage to all that touch it, per segment of contact.  In
the last round is will flash with a bright light (causing all in the
zone to save vs. rods or be blinded for 1d20 rounds) and then cease to
function.  This last burst of energy transmutes the mithril rod into
pure lead, causes the runes to dissolve, and disintegrates the 10 gems
into a useless powder.

Sphere of Annihilation (Evocation)

Range: 4"
Components: VSM
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 12 hours
Area of Effect: One 2' diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None

This ancient and arcane spell was first found in the Libram of Tel'
Aknus the Mad.  It is used to create a sphere of annihilation.  The
mage must prepare a special magical device, which costs 15,000 gp to
construct, to house the energies required to bring the sphere into
existence.  The construct is made of the rarest or ores, adamantite,
and requires a full year of work by a master smith to fashion.  A
Master Alchemist must then fuse ten vials of Essence of Platinum, ten
vials of Essence of Gold, and ten vials of Essence of Silver, in this
order, into the construct (which looks something like a giant spider
when finished).  This will take two weeks per vial and the chance of
success is equal to the alchemist's chance of creating said essences
(checked for each vial fused to the structure) and any failure means
that the entire structure has been transmuted in the metal of the
current essence which is being fused into the construct.

Then the casting procedure can take place.  It consists of a highly
ritual ceremony requiring a black pearl of at least 1' in diame
being placed inside a magic circle and then calling forth the various
magics of the planes to instill the pearl with anti-planar power of a
sphere of annihilation.  The spell then temporarily doubles the current
hit points of the casting mage as it starts.  Every hour of casting
time instills the pearl with more and more power.  At the end of every
hour's casting the mage must roll a successful saving throw vs. magic
which is unadjusted by any means other than his current level of
mastery.  If successful, the casting continues for the next hour.  If
unsuccessful, the mage takes 1d20 points of damage for an unsuccessful
hour of casting and the casting time is extended for anther hour.  The
spell will only be successful if 12 hours of continual casting is
completed.  Remember that if the spell is successful the mage must
still attempt to bring the sphere under his control.  This spell in no
way gives any special bonuses for control attempts.

If the mage is reduced to zero hit points the pearl disappears (in a
harmless, but spectacular flash of light) and his strength and
constitution are reduced to 1 and he is thrown into a coma, losing
knowledge of all spells currently memorised.  These statistics and
normal hit points are regained at a rate of 1 point per day or total
rest unless some form of magic is used to increase healing.  Until the
mage reaches half of his original constitution score he is extremely
susceptible to diseases and will take 4x the amount of damage a disease
would normally inflict.  When half of his original strength is restored
he may save vs. spells each day to see if he comes out of the coma.
Failure means that he remains in the coma.  Once the mage comes out of
a coma he will be in a ravenous state and will not be able to regain
spells again till he has eaten and rested for as many days as he was in
the coma.  Success or failure notwithstanding, this spell will always
destroy the construct and the pearl used as the material components.
If the spell is successful, the construct and pearl are sucked into the
sphere, and if unsuccessful, the construct crumbles into a useless
crystal substance and the pearl disappears as mentioned above.

If the spell-caster is physically touched during the casting of this
spell by anything, including the power of another magic, and sustains
damage which subtracts from his hit points or any ability score or
level, the pearl will explode in a force of magic dealing out damage
equal to 1d20 per hour of casting time that has passed (rounded down)
in a radius equal to 1" per hour of casting time that has successfully
passed (again, rounded down and a unmodified saving throw vs. spells
will allow anyone in the area of effect to save for half damage).
Also, when this happens the extra hit points disappear (if they are
still present) and the mage takes damage from his normal remaining hit
points.  Death by this explosion means that the body has been
disintegrated, ruling out `raise dead' or `resurrection' spells for
bringing the victim back to life.

Symmetry (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: 
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 
Area of Effect: 10 mile radius
Saving Throw: None

Composed of 2 level 9 spells which have to be cast simultaneously.
Creates within a 10-mile radius a condition in which the symmetry
between the physical interactions which prevailed at the time of the
Big Bang is restored. Everything within the 10-mile radius is
instantaneously gone regardless of magic resistance, god or artifact
status etc. Everything for a couple of hundred miles around gets
burned, vapourised, melted etc. Note that like Nuke this has a range of
zero, so use of Long-Range Carrier is advised.

Telnorne Force Layer (Evocation)

Range: 1"
Components: VS
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One 10'x 10' area
Saving Throw: None

The source of this highly improved version of the `Wall of Force' spell
is the Telnorne Mageocrat.  It is used to create a barrier which cannot
be penetrated by any known spells or forces in the multi-universe,
including major powers, avatars, devils, or demon princes.

The casting time of 1 hour is standard, but the mage must also spend a
hour in contemplation, reviewing diagrams and/or charts of the area or
object to which the force layer is to be attached when memorising the
spell.  A force layer may cover an area of up to 10'x 10', and must be
attached to a localised gravity: either an object, a structure, or an
area.  Once cast, only spells of wish-like power may affect the force
layer.

A `Limited Wish' will effect the force layer as a 1/2 strength `Dispel
Magic', an `Alter Reality' will effect the force layer as a 3/4
strength `Dispel Magic', and a `Wish' will effect the force layer as a
full strength `Dispel Magic'.  The force layer may be attached to
moving objects, but only those which are of one piece and move in
conjunction to something else.  For example, a chest (with hinges)
could be covered, but the chest would still need to have a break within
the spell effect, so only the top or the bottom of the chest would be
affected.  Placing the spell on a wagon would effectively make the
wagon indestructible, but the wagon would never again roll since the
wheels are now locked in place.  But, if the wheels alone (and possibly
the axle if the mage was inventive) were protected the wagon would
still roll.  Of course, after the wheels eventually rotted away in a
few years the spell area would still be in effect and invisible wheels
would still roll.

When this spell is cast on the Prime Material plane the area of effect
extends into the astral and ethereal planes, although the force layer
will still be invisible.  Nothing will stick to the force layer except
for another force layer which is attached to a previously cast one.
Paint, dust, and powders will simply roll off its surface.  Only Dust
of Appearance will stick to the force layer, and then only for 1d10
rounds.
