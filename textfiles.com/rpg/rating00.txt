These files make up the Net.Ratings.Guide to TSR products.  They were
compiled from responses by the readers of rec.games.frp.dnd and ADND-L by 
Goth <brooks@odie.ee.wits.ac.za> from October 1994 through early 1995.

Not every single product is listed, as there had to be at least five votes
for a given product in order to include in on the list.  For a complete
list of TSR products for D&D, AD&D1, and AD&D2, see the TSR.Product.Guide.
