     Gruel is a thin, watery porridge that is the main food staple of
the lower class. Humanoids prefer the name of grub for their gruel.
Usually gruel is made of water, some grain, and some flour to thicken
it up. If one is rich, a little sugar is added for flavor, or maybe a
veggie or two and make it a thick soup.


Tomato Gruel

     Fry some tomatoes in a butter and sugar sauce until they seem
right. About three medium sized tomatoes sliced into 1/2 inch pieces
should do the trick. A tin of canned tomatoes will work but only the
rich can affored canned tomatoes and why would the rich want to make
greul.
     Put stuff in a pot, and bring to stirring temperature. Add a bit
of meat extract, a drop or 3 of Worchester sauce, a pinch of salt and
pepper, some fruit chutney and some ketchup (to taste). Also add
something else laying around the home thats been never tried before,
but not too much of it.
     Let the stuff "prut" for 10 minutes or so, to let all the flavours
mix thoroughly. Mix with some grain, rice, bread crumbs, and/or meat
chunks.
