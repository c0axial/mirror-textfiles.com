  The witch is a special type of powerful spell caster. Though similar
to the magic-user, it is not a mgic-user subclass, much in the same
way that the cavalier is similar to (but not a subclass to) the fight-
er. Thw witch has talents and powers normally associated with other
spell-casting classes, as well as its own unique abilities.
  Based upon the witch of fairy tale, myth, and fantasy, the class in-
cludes a number of distinctive abilities. Witches use herbs for heal-
ing and magic, somewhat in the manner of druids (to which witches are
distantly related). Witches combine cleric and magic-user forms of
magic, since they are essentially worshippers of forbidden religons
(generally evil in nature, but not always so). They specialize in
spells involving nature, the changing seasons, and sympathetic magic
(i.e. magic based upon the similarities between a spell-casting ritual
and the spells effect), and they are also very knowledgeable about
enchantment/charm spells involving humans and humanoids. The manipula-
tion and control of other beings is one of the hallmarks of witch
magic-a necessary step on the way to acheiving greater and greater po-
wer. Evil witches often specialize in curses and destructive spells.
  Witches gain new spells by performing ritual sacrifice and prayer to
deities-usually demon princes, archdevils, or the current oinodaemon.
If the deity is pleased, it sends a servant to teach the witch a new
spell appropriate to her level and ability. Because the witch must
learn the new spell as a magic-user does, her chance to know each
listed spell and her minimum and maximum number of spells are taken
from Table II on page 10 of Players Handbook. Witches always gain the
spells read magic and write, not having to check for knowing these
spells as they start in their class. Witches may use the latter two
spells to learn the spells used by other spell-casting classes, so
long as the spells learned are duplicated in the list of spells all-
owed to witches, and so long as the witch is of appropriate level for
the spell. For instance, a 4th-level witch who has found a scroll with
the 2nd-level cleric spell find traps may attempt to learn the spell
directly from the scroll, copying it down (in her own magical lan-
guage) for future use. All witches keep and use spell books, from
which they relearn their spells as do magic-users.
  If a Dungeon Master desires a witch with more variety, the restict-
ions on which spells may be learned by witches may be loosened. Spells
that summon beings from lower planes and bind them to certain tasks
are not likely to be taught to a witch by her deity's servants (wheth-
er they are good or evil), but nothing should stop the witch from
looking up such arcane knowledge on her own. Independant witches who
did not join a High Secret Order (see below) are the ones most likely
to make use of such spells-so long as the witches do not use them to
attempt to bind their own deity. Other spells, particularly those from
Unearthed Arcana may be added as well (see the general notes on spells
below).
  There are two orders of witches. Low Order Witches may progress to
16th level, and High Secret Order Witches may advance to 22nd level.
Witches may be of any alignment, though evil witches are the rule;
good and neutral witches are almost unknown. The prime requisites for
a witch are intelligence and wisdom, each of which must be 13 or high-
er. Only humans, elves (any sub-races from Unearthed Arcana), and half
elves can be witches; furthermore, only humans and dark elves (drow)
can be members of a High Secret Order. Other elves and all half-elves
are limited to no higher than 11th level as witches, but no male witch
of any race can rise higher than 9th level. No witch may be multi-
classed or double classed, due to the difficulties involved in learn-
ing and mainting ones magical powers. No earned bonus for experience
is gained for exceptional ability scores.
  Most witches are female, since this class attracts a disproportional
number of female humans, elves, and half-elves to its practice. This
situation is encouraged by the large number of evil male beings ruling
the lower planes, most of whom desire mortal consorts, and by female
deities (of any alignment) governing magic, who find worship among wo-
men in oppressive, male-dominated societies. Male witches are some-
times called warlocks, though this term invites confusion with the
title for 8th-level magic-users. Conversely, many female magic-users
are improperly called witches. As a generic term for a single witch,
the pronoun "she" is used in text.
  Witches have 4-sided hit dice and receive 1 hit die for each level
of experience up to and including 11th level. Thereafter, they each
receive one additional hit point for each level of experience-11+1 for
12th level, 11+2 for 13th level, and so on. Witches receive constitui-
tion bonuses as do magic-users, and they save either as clerics or as
magic-users, on whichever column is better against a given effect.
Weapon proficiences, allowable weapon types, attack tables used, and
attacks per round are all as per magic-users. They may wear no armor
whatsoever, save for magical protections such as rings, bracers,
cloaks, etc., and witches cannot use shields. They may use any magic
item that magic-users are able to employ. Oil may be used as a weapon
(though it rarely is), and poison is freely used by evil witches.
  Witches with above average intelligence receive bonus spells, simi-
lar to the procedure for a cleric with above average wisdom:
      Intelligence                 Spell Bonus
           13                    One first level spell
           14                    One first level spell
           15                    One first level spell
           16                    One second level spell
           17                    One third level spell
           18                    One fourth level spell
           19+                   One fifth level spell
  The spell bonuses are cumulative; e.g. a witch with a 15 intelli-
gence receives three additional 1st level spells. A witch must have an
intelligence of 16 to cast 8th level spells.
  Witches start out in the world with a variable amount of money, de-
pending upon how well they are liked by their deities. Multiply a
witch's charisma score by 10 and add a variable amount from 2-20 to
find the number of gold pieces given to a 1st level witch through a
servant of her deity. Thereafter, witches tend to accumulate numerous
useful magic treasures. NPC witches have an amount of magical treasure
equal in gold piece value to their level multiplied by 5, expressed in
terms of thousands of gold pieces. For example, a 2nd level NPC witch
would have about 10,000 gp worth of magical equipment-prehaps a single
ring of mammal control, potions of invisibility, and diminution, an
eversmoking bottle, and a rug of smoldering (used as a trap). The cash
reserve for an NPC witch is roughly equal to her amount of experience
points expressed as gold pieces, though "cash" may actually be in the
form of mundane items such as glassware, spell components, wall hang-
ings, furniture, and so forth. Each NPC witch's lair should be tailor-
ed by the DM to fit the campaign circumstances as seen fit. These
guidelines do not apply to PC witches (if they are permitted).
  Because of their close working relationship with their deities, wit-
ches regard themselves as superior to all other classes of characters.
Witches tolerate no masters, save their deities or high-level witches,
and they insist upon governing all underlings with absolute authority,
regardless of alignment. Witches who have become consorts of their
deities are especially dangerous and intolerant of all rivals.Anyone
who attempts to control or give orders to a witch invites disaster.
  When a witch reaches 9th level, she can attract 5-50 zero level
followers of the appropriate alignment if she establishes a place of
worship. Since witches usually worship forbidden gods, such a place of
worship must be kept secret, and it must also be cleared of wandering
monsters. The followers try to remain hidden from the outside world
except under extreme circumstances. A witch may also obtain the ser-
vices of hirelings in the normal manner and is allowed to consult with
sages if she desires.
  A witch may have as many as three apprentices in training at one
time. All aprentices are, of course, witches themselves and cannot be
of a higher level than one-fourth of the witch's experience level.
Thus, a 4th level witch can have 1-3 1st level apprentices and cannot
have a 2nd level apprentice until reaching 8th level herself (fract-
ions are rounded down).
  Apprentices can aquire experience points through normal means, and
can also receive the benefit of up to one-half of the witch's own a-
quired experience points. The awarding of a witchs experience points
to her apprentices can only take place when the points would not raise
the apprentices to a level more than one fourth the level of the witch
herself.
  Each major diety worshipped by witches maintains a formal organiza-
tion of the most powerful witches in a certain area. This organization
is usually known as a High Secret Order. High Secret Orders may have
members scattered over an entire world or across a small country, as
the situation permits; orders that have been decimated by magical wars
or which are just starting out may be highly localized. High Secret
Orders serving different deities and causes have been known to attack
one another in dreadful battles involving attacks by extraplanar crea-
tures and the use of awful spells,though-suprisingly-such orders are
rarely warlike. Even members of diametrically opposed orders prefer to
oppose each other in more subtle manners, weaving complex plots and
spreading their influence against one another in generations-long dan-
ces of rivalry and power. Kings, high priests, archmages, and dragons
may be drawn into these conflicts, serving as pawns in a greater game.
  Upon attaining 10th level, a witch must decide whether to apply for
membership in a High Secret Order. This application may be made only
by witches with at least a 16 intelligence and 16 wisdom. The witch
must also possess at least one of the following objects: any magical
crystal ball, any magical (non-cursed) broom, a mirror of mental prow-
ess, a mirror of life trapping, or one of these objects, depending on
alignment: libram of silver magic if good, libram of gainful conjura-
tion if neutral, or libram of ineffable damnation if evil. Unless ac-
cepted into the High Secret Order, a witch may not progress beyond
16th level. A witch who joins a High Secret Order may progress to the
22nd level of experience.
  Witches who join a High Secret Order are bound to even greater serv-
itude to their deities than before and take on additional responsibil-
ities to carry out their deities wills. Witches who choose not to join
such an order at 10th level cannot latter decide to join, but they
gain more personal freedom and have less complicated relationships
with their deities. Such "independant" witches are not well regarded
by other witches, even those of their own alignment and religon, and
High Secret Orders rarely go out of their way to assist these "un-
grateful renegades"
  High Secret Order witches, in addition to the spells aquired normal-
ly, recieve one additional High Secret Order Spell for each level they
have gained while in the High Secret Order. For example, a 10th level
witch receives one High Secret Order spell; at 15th level, she re-
ceives six High Secret Order spells; finally, at 22nd level she re-
ceives 13 High Secret Order spells.
  There is only one Queen of Witches and one Princess of Witches for
each High Secret Order. A princess who aquires enough experience
points to become queen must either remain at princess level (gaining
no additional powers or abilites) or plot agaist the current queen in
an attempt to overthrow her.
  A witch is taught certain special abilities by her deity and her
deity's otherwordly servants as she progresses in level. These abil-
ities, noted on the Witches Table at their appropriate levels, are
explained below. Note that spell-like powers are in addition to spells
already known by the witch.
  Brew poisons and narcotics (3rd level): An evil witch can brew one
dose of either a poison or a narcotic each day, providing she has the
necessary ingrediants. The mixtures cannot be used to coat weapons and
must be ingested by the intended victims. A witch learns how to brew
Type A ingestive poison at 3rd level (see pages 20-21 of the DMG).She
learns how to brew an additional type of ingestive poison for every
two levels she progresses beyond third level. Thus, at 11th level, a
witch can brew Type E poison. Saving throw applicable.
  A narcotic has the effect of a sleep spell on a victim with 8 hp's
or less if the saving throw is failed. A victim with 9-16 hp is
reduced to half dexterity and half normal movement for 12 turns; a
victim with 17-24 hp's loses one-third dexterity and one-third move-
ment rate for the same 12 turn duration; a victim with 25+ hp' loses
one sixth dexterity and movement for the duration of the narcotic's
effects. A successful saving throw halves the effects and duration
of a narcotic. Only humans, demi-humans, and humanoids are affected.
  Brew truth drug (4th): A witch may brew one dose of truth drug per
week. A victim who ingests a dose of the drug and fails a save vs.
poison falls into a stupor and is forced to answer 1-4 questions
truthfully. The truth drug can only affect an individual of an equal
or lower experience level (or equal or fewer hit dice) than the witch
who brewed the potion. The stupor (which reduces movement and strength
by half) lasts 2-12 turns. A dose of truth drug is potent for only one
day after being made. Only humans, demi-humans, and humans are a-
ffected.
  Brew love potion (5th): The witch can brew one special form of phil-
ter of love per week. The potion has all the effects of the usual po-
tion, save that the victim is affected only by the witch, the victim
gains a -4 to save against being charmed by the witch, and the charm-
ing lasts for 8+2-8 turns. This potion has a chance of affecting a vic-
tim of the same level (or with the equivalent hit dice) as the witch
who brewed the potion. Thus, a 9th level witch could brew a potion to
affect a fighter of 9th level or lower, but not a 10th level fighter.
Enamoring effects last until dispelled. Victims who save vs. spells
are not affected. Only humans, demi-humans, and humanoids are affected
  New Spell Descriptions and Explanations:
  Minor Quest: Range 2", duration 6 hours, area of effect 5" diameter
sphere. The spell affects up to 12 experience levels worth of humanoid
opponents, or up to 6 levels (6 HD) of monsters, with the lowest level
opponents in a group affected first. The caster must be able to verb-
ally communicate with her opponents for the spell to work. By using
this spell, the witch can send her attackers away from her on an ima-
ginary errand for themselves, such as going to town for supplies or
going to a nearby river to get water. If the intended victims fail a
it poses no threat to their safety or well being. There is a 20%
chance, plus 1% per level of the caster, that the quested forget about
the witch after the spell has worn off or after the quest is complet-
ed, whichever comes first.
  Seduction I: Range 6", duration 2 turns or until dispelled, are of
effect one man. This spell causes the affected man to cast aside all
weapons, armor, and clothing in an attempt to seduce the witch, leav-
ing the victim virtually defenseless against attacks from the witch or
any other character or creature. Immediately after the spell wears off
or is dispelled, the victim can retrieve one of his dropped weapons on
a roll of 11 or more on a 1d20. If the roll is 16 or more, the victim
can also retrieve a helmet or shield. Rolls may be repeated each round
until successful, as long as the victim stays within grasping range of
the weapon or other object to be recovered. The saving throw for this
spell is computed by adding the seduction spell level (1 through 8) to
the charisma score of the witch and subtracting the wisdom score of
the intended victim. The resulting number is used as a modifier (plus
or minus) to a roll of d20. The adjusted die roll must be equal to or
greater than a certain number depending on the class of the intended
victim, for the save to be successful. Barbarians need a 15 to save,
fighters and rangers need a 13 to save, theives and assassins 12, ca-
valiers and paladins 10, magic users and illusionists 9, and clerics,
druids, and monks need 8 to save.
  Nature Call: Range 12" radius around witch. The spell simmons from
1-10 small birds or mammals (up to the size of a squirrel or hawk) or
one creature as large as an eagle or wolf. The spell allows communica-
tion with the summoned creature, enabling the caster to give the crea-
ture one or two orders. The summoned creatures can be made to rush at
an opponent and fake an attack, causing confusion in monsters of ani-
mal intelligence or lower and causing more intelligent opponents to a-
ttack at -2 to hit for a duration of 1 turn. The summoned creatures
cannot be forced to rush at a character or creature from which they
would normally flee. Summoned creatures can also be made to act as
messangers, carrying an object their size permits them to carry for up
to three days.
  Pacify: Range 6", duration 4 turns +1 turn per level of caster; area
of effect 1" by 2". The spell affects from 1-8 creatures of 6 or fewer
hit dice, causing those who fail a saving throw to cease combat and
either leave the scene or lie down on the spot and rest (50% chance of
each). Pacified characters or creatures won't harm the witch or her
party as long as the pacified creatures are not harmed. A pacified
creature is allowed another saving throw each time that the creature
is attacked while under the influence of the spell. This spell does
not affect undead.
  Mystic Rope: Range 10", duration 2 turns +5 rounds for each level of
the caster above 6th level, or until the rope is destroyed or dis-
pelled. The spell creates a magical rope in front of any creature des-
ignated by the witch who is within range. The rope can be of any len-
gth desrired up to 100'. It unerringly carries out the witch's orders
to move about, attach itself to any solid object so that charactes can
pull on it, use it to climb or descend a surface, or ensnare up to six
small, three man-sized, or one giant-sized creature. In order to en-
snare second and subsequent opponents, the rope must first sucessfully
ensnare the creature upon whom the ensnarement is currently being at-
tempted. The rope can attack only one potential victim at a time. Any
part of the rope not being used to tie up a character can move at a
rate of 9" and drags an already ensnared creature around in an attempt
to tie up other victims. The rope is considered to have a strength of
19. Saving throws are allowed to any creature in danger of being tied
up, but a new savng throw must be made at te start of every round in
which the danger still exsists. Saving throws in the third and subse-
quent rounds are made at +2. Any creature being chased by the rope is
-1 to hit other opponents in that round. Actual ensnarement, once a
saving throw is failed, takes one full round, after which the victim
is rendered helpless until and unless the rope can be cut or untied by
the victim, or destroyed by an attack form which damages it. The rope
has 1 hp for each 4' of length, and has a saving throw number of 12
against all attack forms which can harm it. The rope can be destroyed
by dispel magic or disintegrate if it fails it save. The breath weapon
of a dragon, strong acid, and magical fire or lightning cause damage
to the rope, and it is destroyed and immediately disappears if its hit
points are reduced to less than one third of its original total. Nor-
mal weapons have no effect on the rope, but magical weapons can cut
through the rope in two rounds. The rope suffers no damage from such
blows, but simply becomes two seperate pieces of rope, each piece re-
taining the proper portion of the rope's current hit points. Any cap-
tive with strength of 18 or higher has a chance of freeing itself in
each round after becoming ensnared, but must save at -2 in the round
after becoming freed in order to avoid immediately being tied up a-
gain. The percentage chance for a victim to free itself is 5% for a
captive of 18 strength, 10% for 18/01 to 18/50, 15% for 18/51 to 18/
75, 20% for 18/76 to 18/90, 30% for 18/91 to 18/99, 40% for 18/00, 50%
for strength 19, 55% for 20, 65% for 21, 75% for 22, 85% for 23 and
95% for strength 24. A victim may make an attempt to free itself once
per round. Dragons or dragon-sized creatures have a constant 80% cha-
nce per round to free themselves from the rope, but the percentage
drops to 40% if the dragon is ensnared about the head, so as to render
its breath weapon useless. Dragons may attempt no offensive action
while trying to break an ensnarement about the mouth.
  Plant Entrapment: Range 5", duration 2 turns, are of effect 2" by
2". Tree branches, grasses, shrubs, and the like within the area of
effect, grab at and attempt to hold motionless all living and undead
creatures with their reach, and may attempt to disarm or strangle an
intended victim if the witch orders the attempt. If a victim fails to
save against the spell, there is still a chance for the victim to free
itself manually from the grasp of the plants, with the possibility of
sucess dependant on the size and strength of the plant life doing the
entraping.
