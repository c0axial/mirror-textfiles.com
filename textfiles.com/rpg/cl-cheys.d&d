Subject: AD&D fighter kit

I would like to have some input on a new class (or a fighter kit). It is based
on the Cheysuli from books by Jennifer Roberson.

Description:
The Cheysuli are a group of wilderness warriors that can shapeshift into the
form of a Lir (like a familiar for mages). The Lir is a wilderness preditory
animal ranging in size froma wolverine to Black bear to an Eagle or hawk. The
race is A tall dark haired race that look like a cross between Drow and Humans.
They have the feature of a human but the coloring of a drow (except for the
fact that they have yellow eyes). The warrior must have a 17 Str, a 14 Dex, 14
Cha, and an 18 Con (due to the rigors of shapeshifting)


Role:
The Cheysuli warriors are guardians and suppliers of their tribes. The type of
animal that the warrior binds to in no way influences his standing in the tribe
(except those that do not bind are treated os foresaken by the gods). A
warriors place in the tribe is determined by his battle prowess and wisdom.
Only by showing both does a member become Chief. Outside of his region the
Cheysuli seems to be very uncivilized (although not barbaric). Because of this
other civilized people often look down upon them.

Secondary Skills:
Any like Hunter, Tanner, Etc...

Weapon Prof:
Bonus-Ambidexterity
Required-none
Recommended- long sword, short sword, long knife, Long compound bow, spear
(these are the ones that the character can begin with) others as adventures
allow.

Non-weapon Prof:
Bonus-Bowyer/F;etcher, Survival (forest), Animal handling (as per lir)
Recommended- Hunting, leather working, Animal lore, Riding, Animal training,
tracking, Fire-building, and rope use.

Equipment:
A cheysuli warrior may only begin the campaign with leather armor. Later he may
upgrade to any armor upto and including chainmail. He may not use a shield.
Almost all warriors that use a sword will use a long knife in the other hand to
parry attacks.

Special Benefits:
The lir allows the warrior many benefits. These include the ability to
shapechange for 1turn/level/day 3xday, the ability to heal 2 pts/lvl of damage
outside of battle, and to move and hide like a ranger of the same level. There
is also a telepathic link between the Lir and warrior which allow normal
communication. Also like the beast rider the warrior gets a bonus when dealing
with animals that are like lir from his tribe. Lir are able to communicate with
eachother.
 To gain a lir a warrior must go through a rigorous ceremony. At first The
warrior must go into the wilderness with nothing but a dagger. With this dagger
he must kill an animal and use it hide to create a tent. In the tent the
warrior starts a fire and must stay within the confines of the tent for 3 days
to cleanse his sole. At the end of this time the warrior must bath in the blood
of another animal to remove the ash, then in a stream to remove the blood. At
this time he must seek out his lir in the forest (the lir will also seek out
the warrior at this point). When the come in contact the warrior and lir will
kill a beast and share the meal which begins with the still warm heart. After
all this is done the two are bound for life. The warrior at this point is
allowd to done the lir gold (earring and armbands which depict his lir in their
glory). At this point the warrior becomes a full member of the tribe (not just
a child).

Special Hinderences:
If a lir should die then the warrior must make a system shock role. If he fails
then he feels the anguish of his lir and also dies. If he succeed he feels a
renching of his being. He must then make a save versus Death Magic. If he fails
he will be insane for 1-4 weeks wandering the forest looking for his lost lir.
If he succeds he will be incapacitated for 1-4 days. After the required time
has passed the warrior is then able to seek out a new lir. A warrior is ony
allowed to have as many lir as he is henchmen (although it does not count
against that number).

A Cheysuli also suffers a -3 reaction adjustment from people outside of his
society due to the fact that he looks barbaric.


Wealth  Options:
The usual starting gold is allowed but see equipment above.

Races:
Special-see description (the Cheysuli are a race)

Note:
A cheysuli could become a thief character but modifications would be necessary
to the kit.



Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated.
