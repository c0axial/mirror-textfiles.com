                            THE NET PROFITS CATALOG

              Welcome, Netroamers!  We've got lots of new items this 
         year, including the Mark V cyberdeck from Hack & Decker 
         International and several new programs from the Legion of 
         Toon.
              For first-time customers, we offer easy payment plans to 
         fit any budget.  You don't have a job?  We don't care!  You 
         have bad credit?  We don't care!  You don't expect to pay us?  
         _Then we care!_  For further information on our credit 
         program, call our offices and ask for Rocco.

                                  CYBERDECKS
              Our line of cyberdecks is second to none!  This year, 
         Net Profits signed an exclusive contract with Hack & Decker 
         International for distribution of their hot new Mark V 
         "Panther," the most powerful cyberdeck available to private 
         citizens!  We also carry a full line of inexpensive decks for 
         home or office use.  NOTE: Modifying cyberdecks or using them 
         for criminal activity is punishable by fines, imprisonment, 
         behavior modication and long, boring lectures on Good 
         Citizenship.

         Mark I "Hawk"
              This deck is perfect for the beginner.  It has two 
         chipdips and a speed factor of 2.  It has a comfortable pinky 
         slot and weighs less than 3 lbs.  Cost is $200.

         Mark II "Mustang"
              With three chipdips and a speed factor of 3, this is a 
         good all-around deck for home use.  Includes "phone home" 
         circuitry that lets you communicate with Realspace from 
         Cyberspace via your home comlink.  Cost is $400.

         Mark III "Tiger"
              This is our biggest selling model!  Look at these 
         features and you'll see why: four chipdips, a speed factor of 
         3, _two_ pinky slots, phone home circuitry and a special 
         timer chip that can be set to shut off the deck at a 
         predetermined time!  Now on sale for only $700!

         Mark IV "Rhino"
              All of the features of the Mark III, but with _six_ 
         chipdips instead of four and the option of speaking to 
         Realspace directly through your own voice instead of 
         comlinks!  Cost: $900.

         Mark V "Panther"
              The new heavy hitter in the world of cyberdecks!  Just 
         look at these fantastic features: speed factor of 4, _nine_ 
         chipdips, _three_ pinky slots, _anti-Mindfry circuitry_ (good 
         versus attack rolls of 4 or less), direct voicelink with 
         Realspace, timer chip and a free _Dungeons and Toons_ 
         worldgram!  All for a one-time special price of $1,500!  
         Order _now_ to reserve yours!

                          PROGRAMS FOR ALL OCCASIONS!
              Net Profits is proud to offer a complete line of Program 
         Chips from NeuroSoft Technologies.  These chips come with a 
         full one-year, money-back warranty against defects when used 
         for _lawful purposes only!_
              Each program comes on a seperate chip which takes up one 
         chipdip on your cyberdeck.  So if you've got a Panther 
         cyberdeck, you can slot nine different programs at once... 
         but if you've got a Hawk, you can only use two.

         WORLDGRAMS
              The following popular worldgrams are all fully tested at 
         the factory to insure the minimum amount of anomolies.  
         _Warning: Tampering with worldgrams can lead to anomolies, 
         temporal paradoxes, mental disorders and possible Zeroing 
         Out.  It also voids the warranty._  Cost: $50 each.

         Dungeons and Toons
              This is our number one seller.  An exciting medieval 
         fantasy world complete with terrifying monsters and mighty 
         magic!  Armor, weapon and magic Shtick programs are 
         recommended and available seperately.

         Supertoon
              A big favorite with young deckers!  Superpowers make 
         programming fast and easy!  See our large selection of powers 
         under "Shtickgrams".

         Star Toon
              Explore interstellar space from your own cyberdeck!  
         This chip is now sold with a four-passenger scoutship 
         gadgetgram at _no extra cost!_

         Cream Pies and Private Eyes
              Investigate your very own cases like Magnut, P.I. and 
         Phillip DaTanc.  Be a private dick in the late 30's.  See our 
         "Buddygrams" for partners!

         WEAPONGRAMS
              Our weapongrams are now available in _variable_ mode. 
         meaning that you can change them from one form to another!  
         Get them now at the low price of $75 each!

         Low-Tech Weapons
              Just the ticket for creating pre-gunpwder weapons, like 
         rocks, spears and swords.  One program does it all!

         High-Tech Weapons
              Everything from a blunderbuss to a bazooka is right at 
         your fingertips with this chip.

         Ultra-Tech Weapons
              If you need a Plasma Cannon or a Light Saber, this chip 
         will do the job.

         ARMORGRAMS
              Armorgrams are sold according to the number of Hit 
         Points they add to the wearer.  The armor will be whatever 
         armor is appropriate to the worldgram being used.  Cost: $20 
         per Hit Point.

         SHTICKGRAMS
              Net Profits carries the largest selection of Shtickgrams 
         in the world!  We guarantee your complete satisfaction or 
         your money back.  Cost: $400 per Shtick chip at level 6; $200 
         for each point above 6.  Choose from the list of Shticks, p. 
         00.  (Animators: Since these Shticks work only in cyberspace, 
         they do _not_ cost character points.)

         BOOSTERGRAMS
              These very popular programs are now on sale for the low 
         price of $75 for the first bonus point for individual skills 
         and $400 for the first attribute bonus point.  Prices double 
         for the second point, quadruple for the third, and so on.
              (Example: Dixie Scatline wants to buy Fire Gun +2.  It 
         costs $75 for the first point and $150 for the second point, 
         for a grand total of $225.)

         BOGGLEGRAMS
              A very useful chip, especially when you need to slow 
         down a security program!  Bogglegrams cost $50 each and 
         Maximum Bogglegrams cost $150 each.  These programs are 
         variable and can resemble anything from a cream pie to a joy 
         buzzer or a bottle of seltzer!  Can be used over and over.

         CREATUREGRAMS
              Great for security programming, these are the well known 
         "Vari-Beast" chips that let you create any creature with Hit 
         Points and damage points at or below the program's maximum.  
         Cost: $10 per Hit Point and $10 per damage point.

         BUDDYGRAMS
              Why roam the Net alone when you can take a buddy along?  
         Our Buddygrams have a Smarts of 4, the highest legal level!  
         They can be programmed to do up to a dozen simple tasks and 
         have 10 Hit Points.  Cost: $500 each.
              Can't afford top-of-the-line?  No problem!  Talk to our 
         Construct-A-Buddy (tm) programmers and they will custom make 
         a Buddygram for you!  Cost is $100 per point of Smarts up to 
         4, and $10 per Hit Point up to 12.
              One of our most popular Buddygrams from Construct-A- 
         Buddy is the Friendly Puppy (tm) Buddygram!  Man's best 
         friend is now your Buddy too!  With a Smarts of 1 and 5 Hit 
         points, it can fetch, roll over, speak, and lick (with it's 
         built-in Bogglegram, this causes the target to sit in agony 
         while you can go about your business!).  A steal at $200.

         GADGETGRAMS
              This section was so large, we had to give it a 
         _separate_ text file!  Hundreds of useful items are listed 
         and all of them are on sale!  Note: Animators can decide what 
         gadgets to let the Netroamers have in cyberspace, and should 
         price them according to their usefulness.

         TRAPGRAMS
              One of the best security measures money can buy!  We 
         sell thousands of them every week.  Just the thing for 
         dealing with subversive Toonpunks!  Cost: $150 each.


                                   IMPLANTS
              Five years ago, Net Profits began offering high-quality 
         cyberware implants to the general public.  Today, we are one 
         of the largest implant dealers in the world.  All of our 
         implants come with free installation and a one-year 
         guarantee.  Below are just a few of our more popular 
         implants.

         ARMORSKIN
              Don't worry about getting knocked down by a single punch 
         -- wear Armorskin from Net Profits!  This lightweight armor 
         can really take a beating and still look _exactly_ like your 
         normal skin!  Price includes custom tailoring.  A steal at 
         $3,500.
              Note: Armorskin adds 25 Hit Points to your character's 
         total.  The armor is not affected by magnets.

         BUILT-IN CYBERDECK
              When we introduced this product last spring, the demand 
         was so high that we completely sold out of them in _two 
         weeks!_  Now they're back and the demand is sure to be even 
         higher!  Available in any model deck, with chipdips placed 
         either in your chest, arm, forehead or neck.  A huge seller 
         at $4,000 each, plus the basic cost of your deck.
              Note: A Built-In Cyberdeck allows you to plug into the 
         Net without using a pinky plug _or_ an external deck.  You 
         only need to be within 30 feet of a comline, computer, hair- 
         dryer or any other plugged-in device.  You can have extra 
         chipdips installed for $200 each.  While you are in 
         cyberspace, your physical body will just sit still with its 
         eyes shut.  If an implanted deck is _damaged_, the Animator 
         should be very creative with the problems it causes.

         CYBERSENSES
              Notice EVERYTHING around you!  Get that cybernetic edge 
         for detectives, or become really good at Where's Waldo!  This 
         cybernetic overhaul is expensive, but you can make all your 
         See/Hear/Smell rolls at +5!  Cost: $2,000.

         FINGERTOOLS
              Tired of not having the right tool for the job?  We were 
         too, so we had the people at Digit Tech design these handy 
         electric fingertools for us.  Your choice of drill, 
         screwdriver, sander, saw, cutting/welding torch, stapler or 
         hot glue gun.  Cost: $400.

         INSTANT WINGS
              You can fly!  When not in use, these wings fold neatly 
         into hidden slots on your back, but when you want, they pop 
         out into a beautiful set of wings.  You can jump into the air 
         and (if you make your roll) stay there.  If you roll your 
         shtick level or less, you can fly to any destination you want 
         at Speed 5.  The Animator determines how far your character 
         can fly.  No chartacter can fly to Outer Space.  If the roll 
         fails, you plummet to earth, taking damage according to how 
         far you fell (usually one die, or two dice for a really long 
         fall).
              Each time you try to change direction or do something 
         while flying (like taking something out of your Back Pocket, 
         or dropping a rock), make another shtick roll.  If this 
         succeeds, there's no problem.  If it fails, you remain aloft, 
         but the action fails.  You head in the wrong direction; your 
         pockets empty themselves onto the ground; the weight of the 
         rock drags you to earth; and so on.
              Cost: $2,000

         LASER EYES
              Why carry around a laser pistol around when you can just 
         shoot laser beams FROM YOUR EYES!  SeeYa Technologies ("We 
         see the future") lets you with Laser Eyes! The beams do 1d+1 
         damage per turn.  They will NOT melt a mirror (don't ask US 
         why, they just WON'T).  Instead, they bounce off in whatever 
         direction the Animator decides.  The beams have a range of 60 
         feet.  Sold singly or in pairs for just $750 each!

         MICRO EYES
              From those wonders at SeeYa Technologies comes Micro 
         Eyes!  Now you can get a really good look at really small 
         things!  Depending upon how powerful the Animator says it is, 
         these implants might let you see things as small as atoms!  A 
         steal at only $200 each.

         NIGHT EYES
              Tired of stumbling in the dark?  Like to go night 
         fishing, but keep stabbing yourself with hooks?  Fret no more 
         with SeeYa Technologies' Night Eyes!  See in the dark as if 
         it were daylight! Only $250 each.

         PINKY PLUG
              Lets you connect to a cyberdeck and enter the Net.  Each 
         character needs only one -- a cyberdeck with multiple plugs 
         can be used by several Netroamers.  May be istalled on a 
         finger, or anyplace else funny.  Cost: $100.

         SUCTION CUP HANDS AND FEET
              Can you imagine running UP the side of a building?  Our 
         Suction Cup Hands And Feet will let you do just that!  If 
         you're falling, these devices will let you grab hold of any 
         vertical surface you can reach and stop your fall.  If a 
         surface is wet, to remain clinging you must make a Shtick 
         roll every 60 feet you move.  If it's oily or greased, you 
         need to roll every 30 feet.  They're great for getting to 
         those hard-to-reach burnt-out light bulbs!  Any attack that 
         does MORE than 6 points of damage will knock you off.  If you 
         are trying to carry a heavy weight while clinging, you have a 
         chance of losing your grip on a roll of 4 or less.  Sold only 
         in sets of two hands and two feet.  Priced right at $900.

         TELESCOPE EYES
              SeeYa has done it again!  With Telescope Eyes, you can 
         see things for miles away!  To see a long way in the DARK, 
         you'll need our Night Eyes, too!  Sold singly or in pairs for 
         $300 each.

         X-RAY EYES
              Now YOU can see through solid objects!  Our top-of-the- 
         line cyberware eyes can switch from normal to X-Ray Vision in 
         a flash!  See up to 60 feet unobstructed!  Buy one or a pair 
         at our new low price of $600 each.  Sorry, they can't see 
         through lead.

                                   VEHICLES
         CARS
         (Rodder <i.e. Rigger> conversion 150% cost - Both Rodder AND 
                               stock 200% cost)

         HIGH-JUMP SNEAKERS
              Get the jump on the competition with these sneakers from 
         Reeverse.  Every leap is followed by a cushioning jet of air, 
         so you land as light as a feather!  You can leap 120 feet in 
         a single bound!  You can only leap in a straight line, but 
         you can turn and leap as soon as you land (on your next 
         turn).  If anything happens to you while leaping, you must 
         make your Drive Vehicle roll to land without being hurt.  If 
         you land on anybody or anything other than the ground, the 
         Animator decides how much damage you did to them.  Available 
         in black, white, red, blue, and gray at only $300 per pair.

         ROCKETPACK
              Fly with the eagles, thanks to your Net Profits 
         Rocketpack from Secord AviTech!  These new, improved 
         rocketpacks have a much greater speed and range than the 
         original version.  In addition, the problem of accidental 
         explosion has been _completely_ eliminated!  So strap on your 
         rocketpack and _really_ get on the fast track!  Cost: $1,200.
              Note: Treat as Instant Wings, but a Drive Vehicle roll 
         must be made _every turn_.  A failure can mean a runaway 
         pack, a crash, an explosion or all three, as well as anything 
         else the Animator likes.

         SPEEDY SNEAKERS
              Another breakthrough for Reeverse, you never have to be 
         caught in traffic jams again!  When you run, add 100 feet per 
         turn to your Speed score.  You have to roll against your 
         Drive Vehicle skill every turn you run.  Available in black, 
         white, red, chrome, and new flourescent pink!  Only $500 per 
         pair!

                              MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
         CHAMELEON CLOTHES
              Just the ticket for watching people without letting THEM 
         watch YOU!  These clothes let you blend into ANY background.  
         If you're standing in front of a brick wall, you'll be 
         colored like a brick wall.  Stand in front of a tree and 
         you'll be colored like bark.  As you move from one place to 
         another, your coloring changes (unless the Animator decides 
         otherwise).  When you wear these, all other PCs and NPCs must 
         make any skill roll that affects you, like Fight, 
         See/Hear/Smell, or other skills at -6.  Hide/Spot Hidden 
         rolls are made at -3.  Failed Chameleon rolls could give 
         others a BONUS to spot you!  Comes in many popular styles for 
         both men and women.  Cost: $500.

         HOLOPROJECTOR
              Use this handy item to project virtually any image you 
         choose in 3-D.  Why bother with huse plants, paintings or 
         even windows, when a holoprjector can simulate them all?  Now 
         on sale for only $400 each.
              Note: Holoprojectors create a very realistic _non- 
         moving_ illusion.  A See/Hear/Smell roll at -1 or an attempt 
         to touch the image will reveal that it's not real.  
         Holoprojectors have a range of 30 feet.

         OMNIMASK
              Want to see what your factory workers _really_ think of 
         you?  Just slip on an Omnimask and a pair of overalls and you 
         can mingle among them unnoticed!  Works great for industrial 
         espionage, too!  Only $250 per mask!
              Note: An Omnimask can look like anyone you choose.  It 
         can also create entirely _new_ faces.  The mask will retain 
         the face you want for 10 turns and then it will go blank 
         unless you reprogram it.  This mask _only_ changes the 
         wearer's face and head!  It has no effect on the body, so if 
         you are a mouse with a lions head, others will eventually 
         notice.

         ROBOTIC WATCHDOG
              Protect your home and family _and_ have a loyal friend 
         that doesn't _eat, shed, chew things, dig holes or perform 
         other canine acts!_  Available in all breeds and sale priced 
         at $1,000.
              Note: This dog acts just like a real dog, except that it 
         will always be loyal to you, takes half damage from energy 
         attacks, has 30 Hit Points, and does 1d damage with its bite.  
         Other than that, it's a dog.

                                   WEAPONS
         GENERO PISTOL
              Your standard, run-of-the-mill pistol.  It does 1d and 
         costs $25.

         GENERO RIFLE
              Again, your standard rifle.  It does 1d+3 and costs $50.

         BOGGLE BEAM
              This gun causes Boggling with every hit, along with the 
         1d damage.  Boggling occurs on a roll of 5 or less.  Cost: 
         $200 (plus $100 per level of Shtick).  For double the price, 
         you can do Maximum Boggling!

         COLD RAY
              Not only does this do the normal 1d of damage, but two 
         special effects also happen - One, when a target Falls Down, 
         he is encased in a block of ice!  Two, the temperature in the 
         immediate area drops considerably (snow starts falling, 
         penguins ski by, etc.) for 1 turn.  Cost: $600.

         DISCOMBOBULATING GRENADES
              When one of these grenades explodes, every living thing 
         within 50 feet becomes disoriented and confused.  _Any_ 
         action taken by a discombobulated character is at -2.  The 
         effects of this weapon last 3 turns.  Cost: $100 each.

         JOY BUZZER GLOVES
              These heavy leather gloves have small joy buzzers built 
         into the backs of the knuckles, so that every time you puch 
         someone, you get a chance to boggle them as well!  Boggling 
         will occur on a roll of 5 or less on your Fight roll.  Cost:
         $150.

         LASER PISTOL
              The old stand-by, it does the standard 1d, but it's 
         great fun with mirrors!  Cost: $100.

         MOLASSES GUN
              A gun that fires extra-thick, extra-sticky molasses.  It 
         has a 30-foot range and does 2 points of damage.  Characters 
         covered in molasses will lose 2 from their Speed and make all 
         Zip and Muscle rolls at -2.  This effect lasts until the 
         molasses is washed off.  Cost: $300.

         SMART GUN
              This gun fires a laser beam that does 1d+2 damage.  It 
         gets its ame because it has a little robot brain with a 
         Smarts of 4, and can answer simple questions.  It also gives 
         a +2 to the user's Fire Gun roll.  Cost: $300.

         NOT-SO-SMART GUN
              The same as a Smart Gun, but it only has a Smarts of 1, 
         and gives only a +1 to the Fire Gun roll.  Cost: $200.
