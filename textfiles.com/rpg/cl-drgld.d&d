        Dragon Lords.  These are NOT character classes.  Instead, it is a select
group that a character may become (it is usually recomened at most only one
character become a dragon lord).  There are 11  members of the group, one for
each true color or metal dragon (brass, green, gold, red, etc..) and one for a
pseudo dragon (NOT Tiamat or Bahamut).  They represent (to the best of my
understanding) a human
representative in the dragon world.  ?Each one gets a staff (or possibly other
weapon) that is extremely powerful, utilizing many of the abilities of the
dragon they represent (The pseudodragon staff has various defensive illusion
spells-most dealing with color and shifting patterns).  The dragon lords are
immune to attack from each other and any true dragon.  (The true dragons are the
color, metal, and pseudo dragons).  The pseudo dragon is included because it
represent the fulcrom between the two type (good/evil) as a neutral dragon.  The
dragon lords duties include watching over the birth of any true dragon (In the
world I play, dragons can only become extremely powerful (i.e. huge/ancient) if
they are born from Bahamut (father) and Tiamat (Mother).  There is a 10% chance
for any of the dragon type from this lineage).  The dragon lords are there to
make sure no dragon intereferes with the mating or the birth  (i.e. a blue
dragon might try to kill the baby if he saw it was a color it disliked).  The
dragon lords also have access to a plane all their own.  No time passes outside
while they are on this plane, although time passess normally for them.  They can
not bring anyone else to this plane.  In my world, a gnome illusionist companion
of mine is the pseudodragon dragon lord.  His staff can take over the
concetration of any illusion spell for him, is intelligent, can change shape to
become a wooden pseudodragon familiar, gets the pseudodragon tail sting when it
is used in melee, and as one of its various effects it acts as a robe of
scintilating colors (disco gnome).  That is all I remember right now.  Just
remember, while the dragon lords are forbidden to attack each other, that does
not mean they can't attack other party members, or use minions to get at another
dragon lord.

Subject: DragonLords...

Given all the various comments regarding DragonLords, I thought I'd
speak up and offer a slightly differing view... I've had people called
DragonLords in my campaign for a long time (long before DragonLance even),
and, although the idea has evolved a little bit and become something
original within the campaign, it's roots actually come from Ursula LeGuin's
Wizard of Earthsea Trilogy....
In essence, 'DragonLord' is not a class, nor a specific position... nor has
it ever been limited to a specific number of people nor does it have specific
rights and responsibilities....
rather, DragonLord is a title, earnable by extremely outstanding adventurers
(class doesn't matter, but power usually does...), usually granted by the
Dragons themselves, but still sometimes claimed by mortals and then accepted
by Dragons anyways...
In my world, Dragons (being highly intelligent creatures) do have a society of
their own, customs and traditions of their own, etc... and, naturally, see
almost all other creatures as being inferior to dragonkind... This being the
case Dragons do NOT respect most lesser beings....
A DragonLord is the title given to anyone whom the Dragons treat with the same
respect that they would treat another dragon with... Nothing more, nothing less
than the incredible (in dragon's eyes) respect of effectively being named an
Honorary Dragon (or at least being accepted as an Honorary Dragon)... As
previously noted, this respect is usually earned by raw power (one of the few
things that most dragons universally respect) and/or ability to defeat dragons
in combat (I have always made dragons as nasty as is now standard in 2nd ed,
anyways), usually combined with respect for dragon customs and traditions...
That is what makes a DragonLord, and what a DragonLord is in my campaigns...
