====================

From: John Davis <J.R.Davis@bnr.co.uk>
Subject: Stormbringer Rule Modifications
System: Stormbringer

Here is some stuff I did a while back, pretty much the set of house
rules I use for Stormbringer.  Some of the explanations are a bit
brief.

STORMBRINGER RULES MODIFICATIONS

Critical hits: 10% of chance to hit. Roll damage, and double. If
dodged or parried by a critical roll, no effect. If dodged normally,
normal hit only.  If parried normally, breaks weapon and inflicts
normal hit. Armour protects as normal.

Skill increases: Roll 1D10 for increase for skill up to 50%. Roll 1D6
over 50%.  At 90% or higher, add only one point to the skill. A skill
increase cannot take skill past 90% (e.g. 88% + 6% = 90%, not 94%).

Armour:

   Protection Cost
 Soft Leather D4-1    60 LB
 Rigid Leather D6-1   100 LB
 Ring mail D8-1   200 LB
 Barbarian D8-1   400 LB (or more)
 Partial Plate D8-1   400 LB
 Scale mail D8   500 LB
 Chain mail D6+1   600 LB
 Full Plate  2D6  1000 LB (Bulky and encumbering)

Helmets: If the wearer has no helm, any attack roll with a "1" on the
units percentile dice hits the unprotected head (and ignores armour
protection).

Survival luck roll: Characters who suffer a sudden fatality get a
single chance to roll their POW x 1 as a percentage.  If they succeed,
they will survive if the player or GM can think of a rational escape
possibility. (they may still be badly hurt, unconscious, or in a very
bad position).

Knockback: if rolled damage before armour is greater than the target's
SIZ, he is knocked back and must roll DEX x 5 as a percentage or fall
(modified as appropriate for surface, etc).

Damage bonuses:
 
 STR + SIZ Melee Missile
  2 - 10  -D6 -D4
 11 - 16  -D4 -D3
 17 - 24  nil nil
 25 - 32  +D4 +D3
 33 - 40  +D6 +D4
 41 - 60  +2D6 +2D4
 each +20 +1D6 +1D4

Subject: Plant Lore
System: Stormbringer

[this is the first of two articles that I've retrieved from the old
 Stormbringer mailing list.  This was the second set of Stormbringer
 Plant Lore rules that Loren proposed.  He said that he based it on
 Find Healing Herbs from the Chalana Arroy cult in Cults of Prax -sda]

HUNTING HERBS

I.   Depending on the terrain, the searcher has some number
     of attempts to find herbs per four hour period (the
     standard search time) with a chance of his Plant Lore
     or Search skill, whichever is higher.

     Terrain                            Searches
     woods                              5
     river bank                         4
     fields                             3
     cultivated land, oasis             2
     marsh, chaparral                   1
     tundra, above the timberline       1/2
     snow, desert                       0

     Note it is impossible to find Special plants within
     cultivated or grazed lands.

II.  Ordinary successes earn the searcher a D10 roll on the
     following table. Critical successes allow the searcher
     to choose which entry he wants (most will take choice
     10, and then roll 2D6 and add the highest class of
     Plant Lore which he is capable of using successfully.

     Plant Type
     Roll Type of Plant Found
     1    Inedible but useful (such as rope, preservative,
          insect repellant, sun block, or the like. use your
          imagination.)
     2-7  Edible (the lower the roll, the worse it tastes.
          the higher, the better.)
     8-9  Poisonous
     10   A special or unique plant. Imagine 4 leaf clovers,
          then stop being so ordinary and imagine the Young
          Kingdoms' equivalent to such freakish plants.
          That's what was found. It isn't a normal plant of
          its species; it has an extra leaf, or its root is
          in the shape of a human heart, etc. It is capable
          of being prepared many ways. Roll 2D6 and add or
          subtract any number of an absolute value up to
          Class on Special Plant Type table.

     Roll 2D6 on the Special Plant table, adding or
     subtracting any number of your choice (choose before
     you roll) of an absolute value up to the highest Class
     of Plant Lore mastered by your character. If the result
     is a plant of a class higher than you have mastered,
     then you lack the skill to use or save that plant.

     Special Plant Type
     Roll           Usefulness
     <= 4           Edible Plant (Plant Lore class 2)
     5-6            Poisonous Plant (Plant Lore class 3)
     7-8            Sorcerous Plant (Plant Lore class 4)
     9-10           Healing Poultice (1D6 Healing) (Plant
                    Lore class 5)
     11-12          Healing Potion (2D6 Healing) (Plant Lore
                    class 6)
     13-14          Infection or Disease Cure (complete
                    recovery in 1D6 days) (Plant Lore
                    class 7)
     15-16          Hallucinogens and Emotion Affecting
                    drugs (Plant Lore class 8)
     17-18          Attribute Affecting drugs, usually last
                    2D10 hours with 1D6 effect (Plant Lore
                    class 9)
     19+            Potion of Invulnerability (only in the
                    Forest of Troos) (Plant Lore class 10)

III. The searcher now makes his Plant Lore skill to preserve
     the plant he has found. It will be preserved (i.e. it
     will not spoil) for a number of hours equal to the
     margin by which the skill was made times the class of
     Plant Lore skill needed to use it. Preservative potions
     may be used to keep plants "fresh and lively" for an
     almost limitless time.

[Following are a couple of Examples of Special Plants that were
 included in another article by Loren -sda]
 
Quylstrey (a.k.a. My Cup Overfloweth)
Range: Oceanside in Melnibone, variant strains grow worldwide
Level: 9
Effect: key ingredient in a potion which raises Str, Con, and Dex
     up to 12 if they were below, lasts 3D8 hours per dose. Typical
     patches of Quylstrey supply 1D8 doses. Is highly poisonous if
     not combined with appropriate co-ingredients.

Angelwort
Range: Tall grass
Level: 5
Effect: Makes a good healing poultice. Typical growths supply 2D8
     doses.

Blessed Niritsine
Range: Mountains
Level: 6
Effect: Makes a good healing potion, healing 2D6 damage. Typical
     growths supply 1D8 doses.

Gumstave
Range: Tall grass
Level: 6
Effect: Makes a good healing potion, healing 2D6 damage. Typical
     growths supply 1 dose. It has been successfully cultivated.

Deadly Nightshade
Range: Deciduous forests
Level: 3 (level 1 poison)
Effect: 1D8 damage if ingested. May be prepared as a blade venom as
     well, which will do identical damage.

Eight Rare Plants from the Forest of Troos
Range: Forest of Troos
Level: 10
Effect: These eight rare species, when properly prepared and
     combined, may be formed into the Potion of Invulnerability.

Noidel
Range: Short grass and Scrub
Level: 8 Hallucinogen and poison
Effect: One of the plants which the Imryrrians used to influence
     their dreams, the Noidel bush is covered with "lush, poison
     fruit glimmering a purplish blue, a night-colour which even
     the light of day [does] not disperse."

Subject: Stormbringer rules for Passions
System: Stormbringer

[When Loren sent these to the Stormbringer list, he said they were
 a set of rules that the Gamemaster was thinking of implementing.
 I thought them somewhat interesting and odd, and thus they have been
 included here -sda]

PASSIONS

Gaining Raw Passion

Raw Passion is a measure of the suffering which a character undergoes
for his or her principles, whatever motives the character may have.

Every time a character must roll on the Major Wounds table, he gains
1D8 Raw Passion.

Every time a character is affected by a dose of hallucinogen or
deliriant poison, he gains 1D8 Raw Passion.

Every time a character's mind is invaded by demonic Telepathy or
Emotion Control or another means, or he is attacked by a demon or huge
(more than 3xSIZ) creature, he gains 1D8 Raw Passion (huge demons are
worth 2D8. huge mind invading demons are worth 3D8).

Every time a character loses permanent attributes he gains 1D8 Raw
Passion for each attribute point lost.

If a character tries and fails to become an agent or priest, or to win
to great political power, he gains 1D8 Raw Passion.

If a character attempts a Summoning and fails to summon, influence or
bind his target he gains 1D8 Raw Passion.

If a character kills or witnesses the death of a friend or companion
he gains Raw Passion. 1D8 for an acquaintance. 2D8 for a friend or
long-time companion / party member. 3D8 for family member, favorite
pet, or best friend.

If a character is insulted or embarrassed in public he gains 1D8 Raw
Passion.

If a character is strongly affected by a work of art he gains
1D8 Raw Passion.

If a character loses at love he gains 3D8 Raw Passion.

If a character acts against the Stormbringer genre, detrimentally to
the campaign, or in a notably bizarre fashion he will gain 1D8 Raw
Passion (GM's discretion).

Using Raw Passion

There are two sorts of Passions: Raw Passion, which is undirected
until it passes a certain level; and Passionate Traits, which are
Passion directed in a specific manner. It may help to think of Raw
Passion as an unspent pool of points which will eventually become
Passionate Traits.

Once a character has begun to accumulate Raw Passion, the player
should decide what Passionate Trait the character is developing and
mark this down on his character sheet.

If a character's Raw Passion exceeds his POWx3 and he earns additional
Raw Passion he must roll 1D100 against his total Raw Passion. If the
roll is a success then the developing Passion is now a full-blown
Passionate Trait; if the roll is a failure then there is no effect.
Call for player votes on how Raw Passion manifests itself. If the
other players agree with the player's own choice of Passion, i.e. if
the character has consistently pursued some goal or course of action,
make it his new Passionate Trait.  Otherwise there should be a popular
vote. As a last resort, the GM will pick at random. Record Raw Passion
as the magnitude of the Passionate Trait. Then subtract POWx3 from Raw
Passion.

Passionate Traits

Likely Passionate Traits for player characters include extreme
versions of ordinary roleplaying character behavior. Some examples, in
no particular order, are

     Doomed, Loyalty (Lord), Loyalty (Nation), Love (Family),
     Hospitality, Companionship, Honor, Fame, Loyalty
     (Religion), Hate (Religion), Love (Folk), Hate (Folk),
     Love (Individual), Hate (Individual), Love (Occupation),
     Hate (Occupation), Bloodlust, Berserk, Curious,
     Addiction, Leader, Joker, Compulsive (Behavior),
     Delusion, Gluttony, Money, Trust (Others), Jealousy,
     Relaxation, Lust (Sex), Pacifism, Paranoia, Phobia,
     Cruelty, Split Personality, and Love (Own Opinion)

To handle Passionate Traits, whenever a character is faced by a
situation where Passion might rule his response, have the player roll
against the magnitude of the appropriate Passionate Trait, and if the
roll is a success then the Passionate Trait must manifest itself,
otherwise the player may roleplay it. Roleplay the effect of
Passionate Traits. If a player does not roleplay his Passionate traits
the GM may give the character 1D8 Raw Passion.

Overcoming Passionate Traits

The Psychiatry skill is useful for overcoming, or rationalizing,
Passionate traits. Since this skill is not taught in the Young
Kingdoms one must bind a demon with the skill (or embody a virtue of
knowledge) in order to buy back Raw Passion or a Passionate Trait.
Each full week (48 hours of treatment) make a Psychiatry roll,
successful treatment will subtract 1D8 from Passion. Plant Lore skill
(Class 9 Potions) may also be able to overcome Passionate Traits
(Figure each potion will subtract about 1D8 Passion). In order for one
to progress toward overcoming Passionate traits, a character's raw,
unallocated Passion must be reduced to zero. Once the magnitude of a
Passion has been paid off, the Passion has been overcome and may be
marked off the character sheet.

The Lords of Law and Chaos may remove and change Passions instantly if
they wish.

Defeating enemies, and other happy moments, can avert the formation of
new Passions. Subtract 1D8 Passion points from each character's Raw
Passion (or Passionate Trait of choice if Raw Passion is already zero)
whenever an adventure is a success.  Special adventures may subtract
even more Passion points.

Rest and relaxation remove POW Passion points per year.

Each six months of a successful romance subtracts 1D8 Passion points,
first from Raw Passion points, then from other Passionate Traits in
random order, and allocates them towards a Passion of Love (Beloved).

From: "John W. Marvin" <jmarvin@us.oracle.com>
Subject: Point Based Character Creation
System: Stormbringer

[again, this is pulled from the old Stormbringer mailing list -sda]

I've evolved my character creation into a point based system (turning
away from Chaos, are we? :-), and would like to share it:

CHARACTER CREATION

1.  Each player starts with 82 attribute points, to be distributed
    later.

2.  The GM will give the player a choice of one or more nationalities,
    which should make sense based on where the campaign is at.

3.  The player rolls three times on the class chart for their nation.
    If they don't like their choices, they can gain another roll for each
    attribute point they spend.  After their fourth extra roll, spending
    another attribute point (a total of five have been spent) lets the
    player choose any class available to their nation.

4.  A character's base age is 25.  They can gain extra attribute
    points by trading experience for potential, or gain age by trading
    potential for experience.  For every year under 25, add one attribute
    point (max gain is 7).  STR, DEX, CON & SIZ may not exceed age.  For
    every two years over 25 (round in PC's favor), subtract one attribute
    point (max loss is 7).

5.  Further attribute points can be gained by giving the PC
    disadvantages.  These can come up naturally from play (tongueless
    slaves of Melnibone...), or can be fairly generic.  The GM may adjust
    as best fits their campaign:

     Chaos Lord hates you                   10 attribute points
     Lawful Lord hates you                  9
     Elemental Lord hates you               9
     Theocrat hates you                     8
     Major sorceror hates you               5
     Outlaw in one nation                   3 (+1 for each extra nation)
     Major figure hates you                 3
     Minor figure hates you                 1

6.  Player then distributes attribute points as desired, max 18, min 3.

7.  Player then rolls any nationality bonus (max may go over 18, min
    may not drop below 1, subtract from highest attribute if a low score
    would go to zero or below).  Priests roll for INT bonuses based on
    age.
