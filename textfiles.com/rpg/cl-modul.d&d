Moduli (NEW DRUIDS!)
 
 Moduli are a class of their own that specialize in a particular
 element. They are highly attuned with nature and the elements, and are
 quite well suited to living in the outdoors, actually preferring it to
 other alternatives. They have limited access to the priest spheres.
 They have the utmost respect for the forces of nature and they always
 attempt to preserve nature. They try to avoid personal combat as much
 as possible, relying on their magic to fight for them. However, when
 teh tiedes turn against them, they will fight ruthlessly, often
 employing poison. There are four types of moduli: Aerists (air),
 Eorthists (earth), Feurists (fire), and Wasserists (water). The
 opposing elements are earth=air and fire=water. They save and attack as
 clerics, and also have the same weapon and nonweapon slots and rates as
 a cleric. Moduli have access to the priest, general, and wizard
 non-weapon proficiencies. Moduli are aligned with their element. Moduli
 cannot own more than 10 magic items, and must donate 10% of their
 wealth to their temple.
