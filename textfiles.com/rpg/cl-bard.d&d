        * - the bard gains 1 2nd at 12th, 1 1st at 13, 1 3rd at 14th, then
            ceases gaining new spells
        ** - the bard gains a new weapon proficiency at 13th level, and
            again at 17th
        *** - the bard gains an additional non-weapon proficiency at every
            even level (12, 14, 16, 18, and 20th)
 
spell notes: the bard uses mage spells, but may only learn those of
        illusion or enchantment/charm. the bard is not considered a
        specialist mage for any reason. he may also learn druid spell
        not of a healing, necromantic, or divination nature, though
        they are treated as if one level higher.
special abilities: the bard can charm with his song at a chance of 10%
        per level, minus 5% per level or hit die of opponent (20% for
        undead). There is no save, but as soon as the bard stops singing
        and playing his intrument (lute, harp, duar, etc) the charm is
        broken, and previously charmed individuals will have the effects
        wear off in 2-5 rounds. The bard also is an accomplished musician.
        He begins knowing one intrument and singing, and learns all others
        at half cost. A bard, with a successful proficiency check, may
        raise morale of warriors that can hear his voice. Reciting poetry is
        good for a +1. Singing without an instrument gives a +2. Using voice
        and instument gives a +3. A bard may keep this up for a number of
        round equal to his level, then must wait ((18-con)/2) rounds before
        he can try again. Multiple bards may join in on the same song or
        (epic) poem, but each one over the first only adds 1/3 the normal
        bonus, and if a bard should make a failed NWP check, he provides a
        -1,-2, or -3, as appropriate (yes, this means your own bards can
        hurt your morale if not very skilled...)
