Greetings, AD&D Enthusiasts.


   Herein, I have compiled some ideas for Wizards' spells I had come up with 
during my many years of AD&D Role Playing. In that time, I saw almost every 
idea for a spell one could come up with. Still, I disagreed with some, or saw 
need for improvement in others. Therefore, I now bring this list in order to 
cover yet some more gaps and introduce new ideas to AD&D campaign. 
I would be honored, if you find these spells - some, if not all - worthy to 
add to your campaign.

 Wretch (Evocation)
 
 Level : 1                                     Components : V,S,M
 Range : 20 yards                              Casting Time : 1
 Duration : 3-8 rounds (1d6+2)                 Saving Throw : Neg.
 Area of Effect : 1 creature/2 levels

 This spell induces terrible nausea in any creature it is cast at (undead are 
 unaffected). The target may roll a saving throw to avoid the effect.
 If unsuccessful, it will immediately start coughing and gagging for a 
 duration of 1d6+2 rounds. During that time it will suffer a penalty of -2 
 to hit, all saving throws, AC, and initiative, due to wretching.
 The material component is rotten or moldy organic matter. 
 

 Sol's Firecrackers (Evocation/Invocation)

 Level : 2                                     Components : V,S,M
 Range : 5 yards/level                         Casting Time : 2
 Duration : 1 round/2 levels                   Saving Throw : Neg.
 Area of Effect : 3 x 3 x 3 cube

 This spell enchants an area to cause small, random, red-hot flashes of
 miniature fireballs. During each round, a number of 1d6+1 (re-rolled each
 round) miniature fireballs, each one 1.5 yards in diameter, flare away in 
 random places within the area of effect. These burst at random times, 
 without forewarning. 
 (to determine each fireball's timing, roll initiative for each fireball) 
 To determine the flare location of each fireball, roll 1d10:              
 (roll of 5 or 10 indicates center)                            :~~~|~~~|~~~:
 Each fireball causes 1d4 points of damage to all in the area, | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 nagated by a succesful save VS. spells. The wizard does not   |~~~|~~~|~~~|
 need to concentrate in order to maintain the spell.           | 4 |5/0| 6 |
 The material components are a pinch of iron powder and a      |~~~|~~~|~~~|
 pinch of sulfur, or some ready-made firecrakers.              | 7 | 8 | 9 |
                                                                ~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Flashpowder (Evocation/Invocation)
 
 Level : 2                                     Components : V,S,M
 Range : 10 yards/level                        Casting Time : 2
 Duration : Special                            Saving Throw : Special
 Area of Effect : 20-foot cube

 This spell is a variant of the Glitterdust spell. The difference is, that in 
 addition to the blinding effect, the spell also inflicts damage upon all in 
 the area of effect. 
 As in Glitterdust, all creatures must roll a saving throw versus spells. 
 Those who fail, are blinded (-4 penalty to all roles and AC) for 1d4+1 rnds. 
 In any case, all within the area take 1d4 + 1/level points of heat damage 
 (no saving throw). Unlike Glitterdust, this spell will not leave glowing 
 dust in the area, as the dust is consumed in the 'flash'.
 The material components are ground mica and a pinch of saltpetre.


 Trigger (Alteration)
 
 Level: 3                                      Components: Special
 Range: Special                                Casting Time: 5 rounds
 Duration: Special                             Saving Throw: Special
 Area of Effect: Special

 As Trigger is cast, the caster 'loads' any ONE spell of his choice (that he 
 has memorized) into the Trigger spell's pattern, thus effectively casting it, 
 using all components and requirements as usual. However, that spell is not 
 unleashed, but rather, is suspended indefinitely until the caster decides
 to unleash it, which he does by a simple verbal and/or somatic trigger 
 determined when casting this spell - It cannot be changed later. All variable 
 parameters (range, target, verbal suggestion, etc.) are set normally when the 
 spell is unleashed.
 Technically, activating the trigger has a casting time of 0, which means 
 that the wizard rolls initiative without adding the normal casting cost of 
 the suspended spell, thus rolling a natural 1d10, unless hindered by other 
 influences.  
 Also, since the trigger is actually a simplified gesture, it may be set off
 under conditions that would not normally allow spellcasting, such as Silence
 (if only somatic) or bound hands (if only verbal).
 (e.g. Frigidus has set a trigger for a Cone of Cold spell. In combat, when
 rolling initiative, Frigidus would not have to add 5 to the roll, as casting 
 cost of Cone of Cold. He would roll 1d10 naturally, with no modifiers.)
 A wizard is not limited to any number of triggered spells he may hold at a  
 time, except for the regular limitation of spells allowed. 
 Important to note, is that a trigger counts as TWO spells in the caster's
 memory - The trigger in itself, and the spell suspended. Therefore, when the 
 trigger is set off, both the Trigger spell AND the suspended spell are 
 cleared out of the caster's memory.

 
 Paranoia (Illusion/Phantasm)

 Level : 4                                     Components : V,S
 Range : 10 yards                              Casting Time : 4
 Duration : 1 hour/level                       Saving Throw : Neg.
 Area of Effect : 1 creature

 This spell induces paranoid delusions in the mind of an intelligent (Int.
 above 4) living being. The target may attempt a saving throw versus spells 
 to avoid the effects. However, if the target fails, the paranoia will take 
 effect. That is - He will think that everyone is against him, and will 
 especially suspect that his friends and the all the people close to him are 
 scheming and plotting against him. He might even attack and/or run away from 
 them if he sees them do anything menacing or threatening - By his 
 mis-concepted standards, of course. 
 The spell will last for 1 hour per caster's level. As the spell ends, the 
 target will snap out of the paranoia, knowing that SOMETHING has gone amiss.
 
 
 Power Word, Silence (Conjuration/Summoning)

 Level : 5                                     Components : V
 Range : 40 yards + 5 yards/level              Casting Time : 1
 Duration : 1 round/level                      Saving Throw : None
 Area of Effect : 1 yard/level radius

 As the name implies, this spell causes total silence in the area of effect.
 No sound can enter, leave, or be heard within the area of effect, thus
 prohibiting spellcasting and verbal/sonic attacks. Of course, all affected
 may leave the area, freeing themselves from the effect.

 
 Sol's Sonic Wave (Alteration, Evocation)

 Level : 6                                     Components : V,S,M       
 Range : 20 yards                              Casting Time : 6
 Duration : Instantaneous                      Saving Throw : Special
 Area of Effect : Special
 
 Upon casting this spell, the spellcaster emits a sonic-wave, shrill and high 
 pitched in the extreme, which affects a cone shaped area originating at the
 caster, where it is a yard wide, proceeding to a distance of 40 yards, where
 it is 20 yards wide. This spell cannot be blocked by walls or other solid
 obstacles, although a Silence spell would protect an area from it. Anyone 
 standing outside the cone can hear a low buzzing sound for a second's time. 
 The high pitch agitates all particles in the area of effect, and the victims 
 suffer sharp, penetrating pain, as the molecules in their bodies are shaken 
 violently. Everyone may attempt a saving throw VS. paralyze to avoid the 
 effect. Whoever fails, suffers 1d4+1 points of damage per two levels of the 
 caster, and is stunned for 1 round per every 6 points of damage suffered, due 
 to the racking pain. Crystalline creatures take double damage. Whoever makes 
 the saving throw is is only stunned for 1d2 rounds, due to disorientation 
 and shock. All crystalline and other fragile substances within the cone are 
 affected as by a Crushing Blow, and must roll saving throws to avoid being
 shattered. Magical items are immune to this shattering effect. 
 The material component for this spell is a silver tuning fork and a tooth 
 from a bat or dolphin, which is consumed. 
 
 
 Sol's Sonic Beam (Alteration, Evocation)
 
 Level : 6                                     Components : V,S,M 
 Range : 10 yards + 5 yards/level              Casting Time : 6
 Duration : Instantaneous                      Saving Throw : Neg.
 Area of Effect : One creature/object

 This spell is very similar to the Sonic Wave spell, as it also creates a
 high-pitched sonic wave, but instead of releasing it in a cone shaped area,
 it focuses the wave into a sonic beam, which can be fired at one creature 
 or object. As in Sonic Wave, anyone near the beam can hear a low buzzing 
 sound. Creatures targeted by the beam may attempt a saving throw versus
 paralyzation. A successful throw negates the effect. If failed the save, the
 victim would suffer damage of 2d4+1 HP per 2 levels of caster, and be stunned
 for one round per 5 points of damage taken. In addition to the damage, 
 crystalline creatures roll an additional saving throw versus death, or are 
 destroyed. The victim's possessions are unaffected, as only the victim 
 absorbs the beam.
 If the target is an object, it must make a saving throw versus Crushing Blow, 
 with a -4 penalty (a roll of 20 still indicates success), otherwise it is 
 shattered and destroyed. Magical Items are also subject to this effect, but 
 these receive a bonus of +3 to the saving throw. The object's maximum mass 
 is 10 pounds per caster's level.
 The material component for this spell is a silver tuning fork, which can be
 re-used, and a small piece of mica, which is consumed.
 
 
 Mutation (Necromancy)

 Level : 6                                     Components : V,S,M
 Range : Touch                                 Casting Time : 6
 Duration : Permanent                          Saving Throw : Neg.
 Area of Effect : One living creature

 This spell greatly alters the body of any one LIVING creature it is cast on.
 (undead have no metabolism, and are thus unaffected)
 The mutation is random, so the caster cannot control the mutation's exact   
 effect. A target is entitled to a saving throw vs. polymorph to avoid the 
 effects. If failed however, the creature immediately begins to mutate. 
 Roll 1d100 and consult the following table for the results : 
                         
   Die Roll:      Effect: 
   01-10          Creature sprouts 1d3 functional limbs (random location)
   11-20          Bones liquify - Creature turns into living flab.
   21-29          Creature's body bloats and coats with infectious tumors, 
                  loose flabs of flesh, and disgusting, pulsating arteries, 
                  writhing under its skin in a hideous dance of living gore. 
   30-35          Creature grows 1d4 vestigial appendages. (random locations) 
   36-45          Creature sprouts 3d6 additional ears. (amplified hearing)
   46-55          Creature sprouts 3d6 additional eyes. (360 deg. vision)
   56-60          Creature sprouts 3d6 mouth-like orifices.
   61-65          1d4 random limbs shrivel and become useless.
   66-75          A random organ is enlarged/reduced by 1d100 + 100% .
   76-80          Creature grows an additional head. There is 90% chance that 
                  it will become psychotically retarded and die in 3d8 turns, 
                  and a 10% chance that it will survive to live with the 
                  extra head (a very amusing situation indeed).
   81-100         Creature mutates horribly and dies in terrible agony.
 
 (of course, a DM may be creative and alter the list)
 For each mutation, the target must roll a system-shock check to see of it 
 survives at all. Each mutation causes 3d4 points of damage, -10% for 
 future system-shock rolls, and charisma drops by 2d4+2 (minimum 1).
 Mutation has no effect of oozes, molds, jellies, or other liquid creatures. 
 The mutation can be reversed with a Restoration spell or a Wish.
 The material component is living tissue (can be preserved).


 Power Word, Halt (Conjuration/Summoning)
 
 Level : 7                                     Components : V     
 Range : 5 yards/level                         Casting Time : 1
 Duration : Instantaneous                      Saving Throw : None
 Area of Effect : 3 yards/level radius

 When uttered, "Power Word, Halt" abruptly ceases all movement and inertia in 
 the area of effect. All material and even etheral movement (including magic 
 spells) is halted to a dead stop. This lasts for a mere microsecond, but the 
 movement in the area is NOT resumed!!! Thus, if this spell were cast over a 
 battlefield, this is what would happen : arrows in flight would stop flying 
 and fall, a charging soldier would come to a dead stop, and he would have to 
 re-initiate his charge, the arm of a catapult firing a rock would stop 
 prematurely, so the projectile would be a dud, and a spell-casting mage's 
 gestures would be interrupted, and he would lose his spell. 
 In short - all actions that are yet to happen at that round, would be lost, 
 so this spell is very effective if the caster rolls a low initiative roll. 
 
 * Authour's Note : From reactions I have encountered, I know that people 
   seem to discount this spell prematurely. Think twice of what it can do, 
   before disposing of it. It is a great spell to get creative with...It does 
   not necessarily have to be used for combat purposes.
 
 
 Subliminal Implantation (Enchantment, Illusion)

 Level : 7                                     Components : V,S
 Range : 1 Yards/level                         Casting time : 4
 Duration : 1 round + 1 round/level            Saving Throw : Neg.
 Area of effect : 1 Creature

 This is an insidious spell which implants a certain message in the target's
 brain. The massage cannot be much more elaborate than an instinctive 
 impulse - For example, a caster may implant the notion that the creature is 
 actually a life-long friend of his or a bitter enemy of one of its friends.
 The target can be made to think that it can perform something it cannot;
 e.g. flying or water-breathing - The target will believe he is flying while 
 plummeting like a rock, or breathing water while actually drowning!
 In short, this spell can totally alter the target's reality, in the eyes of
 the target creature, of course. A target cannot be directly commanded to die
 through this spell. Such a command would make it fall into a coma for the 
 spell's duration.
 Unlike other charm spells, this spell also works on unintelligent beings, as
 it appeals to their instincts. Undead are unaffected.
 The simpler the message is, the harder it is to resist - But that is at the 
 DM's discretion.

 
 Implosion (Alteration) 
 
 Level : 8                                     Components : V,S,M          
 Range : 40 yards + 5 yards/level              Casting Time : 8
 Duration : Instantaneous                      Saving Throw : Special 
 Area of Effect : Special

 This is a very destructive spell that causes matter to implode. That is, it 
 causes a molecular structure to explode, but to the inside. The spell can 
 affect up to 800 pounds/level of matter - organic and non-organic (including 
 undead). Either way, this spell may affect only ONE coherent mass, even if 
 the caster can technically affect more mass than the one targeted.
 A creature targeted by this spell receives a saving throw to partially avoid 
 the effect. If succesful, target is only stunned for 1d4 rounds. If 
 unsuccesful, the target's molecular structure folds in upon itself, meaning 
 the victim's destruction. The target seems to start convulsing, then it 
 condenses and bursts, spraying the nearby area with gore, or pieces of 
 organic matter. Note that victim's clothing and possessions are unaffected.
 The spell can also target non-living objects, such as structures, objects,
 even otherwise animated non-living substance, as golems. When used against
 these, the spell also breaks the molecular bonds of the target. If cast on
 breakable, hard material, as stone, ceramics, dead wood, etc., the material
 breaks down and crumbles. If cast on expandable material, such as almost
 any metal, it would not be destroyed, but the spell would condense the matter
 and alter its shape. Animated and magical materials receive a saving throw 
 versus Disintegrate.Thus, if cast on a building's foundations or even on one 
 wall, the stone would crumble and fall - obviously causing more damage as it 
 collapses the walls that support the structure. If targeting a golem, for 
 instance, it would receive a saving throw. If it succeeds, it would avoid 
 the effect. If not, the resulting effect still differs. If an organic golem, 
 as a flesh golem, it would suffer the effects as a living creature. If target 
 is a clay or stone golem, they would crumble. If an iron golem, it would be 
 considerably warped, due to the twisting and condension of its joints. 
 Magical items save VS disintegrate to avoid destruction. Non-corporeal 
 creatures, as ghosts and apparitions are not affected.
 The material component is a piece of moist clay and a fist-sized chunk of 
 lead, and both are lost after casting.
 NOTE: If caster cannot affect the full mass of a LIVING target, the target 
 is unaffected, with the exception of inanimate masses only, in which case 
 the caster would affect as much mass as he can.  


 Reversal (Abjuration, Alteration)

 Level : 8                                     Components : V,S,M
 Range : 0                                     Casting Time : 2 rounds
 Duration : Special                            Saving Throw : Special
 Area of Effect : The caster

 This spell creates an invisible shield around the caster that is able to 
 reflect all spells and spell-like effects targeting THE CASTER ALONE back to 
 the source. The caster is able to reflect a number of spell levels equal to 
 his own level. However, the caster can only reflect a spell under certain 
 conditions:
 * The shield can only reflect spells specifically targeted at the caster,
   such as Lightning Bolt, Finger of Death, Disintegrate, etc.
   Area spells, as fireball, fully affect the shielded caster, unless it was
   aimed DIRECTLY at the shielded caster.
 * The caster must make a succesful saving throw against the spell. If he 
   does, the spell will rebound back to the source, forcing the source to 
   suffer the effects (saving throw allowed). Otherwise, the caster is fully 
   affected, and no spell levels are drained from the shield.
 * The shield entitles the caster to roll saving throws against spells that 
   do not normally allow a saving throw, such as magic missiles. As stated, 
   if caster saves, spell rebounds, otherwise, the full effect is suffered.
 * If the shield contains less spell levels than a spell that is cast at it,
   the shield's bearer would suffer the full effects of that spell.
   e.g. - If there are 5 spell levels left in the shield, while a 7th level
          spell is cast at it, the shield would not reflect the spell, and the
          shielded wizard would suffer the full consequences of that spell.
 * The shield cannot reflect Wishes, Limited Wishes, Power Words, or 
   Sympathetic magic, like Clone or Simulacrum.
 * Cleric spells act on the shield as if they were twice the level they are.
 * If the caster is attacked with a touch-type spell which does not normally
   allow save, he may still attempt to save - See above. If he succeeds, both 
   he and the attacker suffer the same effect, and the shield is drained 
   appropriately. If not, he suffers normal effect.
 
 The caster may choose not to reflect spells cast at him.
 Each day, the shield loses 3 spell levels, until it expires, eventually.
 The material component is a silver mirror and a small diamond (500 gp), and 
 both shatter when the spell ends.

 
 Sol's ShockWave (Alteration, Evocation)

 Level : 8                                     Components : V,S,M 
 Range : 10 yards + 5 yards/level              Casting Time : 8
 Duration : Instantaneous                      Saving Throw : 1/2
 Area of Effect : 3 yards/level radius

 This spell releases an expanding wave of force originating at the center of 
 the area of effect. The shockwave also releases a thunderous sonic wave. All 
 within the area of effect must roll a saving throw VS spell. All victims are 
 blown out of the circle (unless they have a very solid anchor - HUGE size 
 creatures and up are immune to THIS effect ONLY), and deafened for 1d20 
 turns.
 The blast also inflicts 2d4+1 points of damage per 3 levels of the caster. 
 Any who save suffer only half of all effects, rounded up. Note that the 
 objects flying out of the area of effect - stones, debris, items, even 
 creatures, are spread in a huge grenade-like pattern and might injure those 
 who stand outside the circle - Outsiders may save VS wands to avoid that.
 The sonic boom forces all non-magical materials within the area of effect to 
 save VS. crushing blow, or be destroyed. Magical items made of crystalline 
 or other fragile material are affected, but receive +4 to the saving throw.
 Crystalline creatures in the area take double damage, AND save as magical 
 items to avoid destruction.
 The material components are a miniature gong and mallot, which are consumed 
 at the casting.


 Inferno (Evocation)

 Level : 9                                     Components : V,S,M
 Range : 50 yards + 5 yards/level              Casting time : 3 rounds
 Duration : Instantaneous                      Saving Throw : Special
 Area of effect : Special

 This is a fearsome and catastrophic spell, used for causing tremendous damage
 over a very large area. The caster affects an area of 500 square meters per 
 level. Upon completing the incantation, the caster unleashes a huge, 
 billowing sheet of roaring flames, 30 feet high, which expands very rapidly 
 (movement 240) within the area of effect, setting alight all flammable matter 
 exposed to it. Any creatures in the area of effect suffer immediate damage 
 of 3d10 +1 / 2 levels from the flames, in addition to later damage from
 burning environment. The creatures within the area may be entitled to roll
 a saving throw versus breath weapon to cut damage in half, but only if there
 is anything in the area that might serve as shelter (rock formation, etc.).
 This spell may be effectively used to raze a small village, or cripple an
 army. Note, that although there is a defined area of land that is affected
 by the spell, the fire might later spread further.
 The spell can be used on ANY non-gaseous surface, even water and ice. 
 The material components are a fistfull of phosphour, a ready source of fire, 
 and a flask of Oil of Fiery Burning (see DMG) - all of which are consumed.
