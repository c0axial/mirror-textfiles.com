                              INTRODUCTION

     Hi, my name is Richard Pugh, and I am the compiler of this fine
guide you have before you.  The work took approximately four months to
assemble, and consists of contributions from several individuals.
Some of the features I had planned for the work had to be eliminated
(things like the Grinder Raiders and the Octopus Club) because of
time, and because of TSR's release of Realmspace (tm), Greyspace (tm),
and Krynnspace (tm).  In short, they took away some of my fire.
     Anyway, I am more-or-less satisfied with the work as it stands,
and any comments would be greatly appreciated.  I would appreciate it
if everyone who has a copy of this guide refrain from placing it into
an FTP sight or file server.  This work is considered and anthology,
so several people are responsible for its contents.  To put this thing
into a file server or FTP sight would require the permission of each
one of us, and the logistics of that may be a problem.
     You may edit this work as you see fit, but please leave the
copyright statement and the acknowledgements in place, so credit will
appear where it is due.  Despite the slapdash appearance, this
represents a lot of work.
     I would also appreciate it if you refrain from tossing this guide
around like an over-used Tradesman.  I want people to use it, to be
certain, but only those people who will get some good use from it.
All I ask is that you use your better judgement when sending this
around.
     This work was created using Word Perfect 5.1, and if you set the
left and right margins at one inch and one-half an inch respectively,
everything should line up nicely.  You might have trouble with the
logo on page one, but with some tinkering even it will come together.
     There, I am now finished with boring business.
     Read on and enjoy!

                               NEW ITEMS

    All of the items presented here can be used to enhance the flavor
of a SJ campaign, and can introduce lots of role-playing
possibilities.  Most of the items presented here are magical, with the
exception of the first one, which is a "normal" item with abnormal
effects.


Spelljamming PanGalactic GargleBlaster (Liquor)
Made By: they won't tell!
Quality: Exceptional

Description: This exotic drink can only be found at Sun-nova Beach, an
extremely exclusive speakeasy on Cygnus-5. Also available at the time
of purchase is literature informing the customer of financing options,
and a list of organizations that can help the customer rehabilitate
afterwards.
     The recipe for the GargleBlaster has been passed down for years
at the 'Beach from one bartender to the next. The legend goes
something like:
     First pour in the juice of a bottle of the Ol' Manx Spirit, then
add a measure of water from the Seas of Santraal V (Oh, that Santraal
seawater! Oh, those Santraal fish!). Allow 3 cubes of Mantovin
Mega-Gin to melt into the mixture (make sure it's properly iced, or
the benzine will be lost!). Allow 2 1/2 liters of swamp gas to filter
through, and, over the back of a spoon, float a measure of Algorian
Mega-Mint, reminiscent of the Algor Regions...  sweet, subtle and
mystic. Finally, add the tooth of a Rakasta, watching it dissolve,
spreading the red flames of the Second Sun deep into the heart of the
concoction. Add an olive.   Drink... but...veeerrrryyy carefully.....

Game Effects: The effects of a Spelljamming PanGalactic GargleBlaster
have been likened to having your brains bashed out by a slice of lemon
wrapped around a platinum brick. Upon completion of the drink, the
character will have attained a state of Great Intoxication. A save vs.
Constitution will allow him/her to be escorted (dragged) to a sleeping
spot. ANY other action will result in violent illness (1 or 2 on 1d4)
or unconsciousness (3 or 4). If any additional alcohol is consumed
before the character rests, he/she must save vs. Poison or become
comatose. See guidelines for recovery. Stimulants will have no effect
on the recovery time from a GargleBlaster, but a limited wish will cut
the time to half. Upon recovery, the character manifests the
"Three-Spelljamming-PanGalactic-GargleBlaster Smile", which is almost
exemplary of being unsteady.

New Magic Items

DISPEL MAGIC GRENADE

Appearance:   This appears to be a small, 2-inch diameter globe of
              crystal with a milky-white substance inside.

Abilities:    This weapon may be used by any class.  When thrown
              (using the thrower's THAC0), the globe breaks upon
              impact.  The area of effect is a Ten (10) foot radius.
              All magic users and/or magical items must make a saving
              throw.  (Mages/Clerics: Save vs. spells.  Magical
              items: save vs. Magical Fire.  Magical bonuses are in
              effect {+1, +2, etc}.  Saving throw charts are found in
              DMG.)  If the save fails, one of the following effects
              occurs:
                 1.   Magic-using characters, NPC's, and creatures
                 with spell-like abilities lose all magical
                 abilities for 1 day (144 Turns).  Mages need to
                 study their spells to regain them.  Priests must
                 pray for more spells.  Others regain them at their
                 normal rate.
                 2.   All magical items that fail their save lose
                 their dweomers, and become normal weapons or
                 trinkets.  Items of exceptional quality
                 (Artifacts, +3 or better magical items, weapons
                 with more than 50 charges, etc.) merely act as if
                 under the clerical spell DISPEL MAGIC. (Cast at
                 12th level of ability.)

Limitations:  The sphere that holds the magical energy is extremely
              fragile.  Should any monster or PC carrying a sphere be
              forced to make a save versus Crushing Blow for whatever
              reason, the sphere will fail and shatter.  Also, if the
              to-hit is failed, grenade effect rules should be used as
              detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

History:      Nothing is known about this new and extremely
              dangerous weapon.  Where it came from and who created
              it is a mystery.  The first reported sighting of the
              grenade was on the world Oerth by a group of adventures
              exploring a lost castle.  The group met and defeated a
              strange, 7-foot tall alien which destroyed itself upon
              death.
                  Several of the globes survived it's death, and
              were taken by the Spelljamming Necromancer Devonshire
              Tawrn to his homeworld of Omni for study.  He surmised
              that the creature who used the grenade was not from
              Greyspace.  The monster was extremely dangerous and,
              Devonshire decided, was one whose world he did not want
              to explore.

XP Value:     None.  Method of creation unknown to PC's  (The DM may,
              at his discretion, assign a value to the using of the
              grenade, but the PC's cannot determine how to create
              them.

GP Value:     Unknown at this time.  There are but a handful of these
              globes known to exist, so they could very easily demand
              a king's ransom.



EVERMAP

Appearance:   An Evermap appears as a sphere about the size of a beach
              ball, with a smokey, transparent appearance.  A tiny white
              light is in the center of the sphere, and it represents
              the ship carrying it.

Abilities:    This Arcane built device only works in the phlogisin, and
              is designed to locate crystal spheres within a given
              radius.  In this case, the radius is given in terms of
              'standard spelljamming days' of travel.  The navigator
              gives a command to the Evermap, such as 'show me all
              crystal spheres within three days travel,' and the map
              responds by creating an appropriate, three-dimensional map
              in the sphere.  Any spheres within the desired range
              appear as miniature replicas of the actual spheres, about
              the size of a pea.  If a sphere has a distinct appearance
              known to the navigator, he or she will recognize it. With
              the use of this map, the navigator can then compute or
              confirm courses, and inform the captain and helmsman
              accordingly.

Limitations:  The device only works in the Phlogisin.  In Wildspace or
              on a planet, it becomes dormant, and will not function
              again until the ship enters the phlogisin.  It will not
              interfere with a Planetary Locator.

History:      The Evermap is similar, in many ways, to a Planetary
              Locator, and the Arcane developed the Evermap to
              complement the more complex Locator.  The Elven Navy
              started using evermaps after the first inhuman war, and
              have used them frequently ever since.

XP Value:     3000 points

GP Value:     Starting at 30000 standard gold.



NETWORK HELM

Appearance:   The nodes of a network helm can appear as any other helm,
              and are available in a variety of styles.

Abilities:    The Network Helm is an arcane design that combines some of
              the characteristics of a major helm and a series helm.
              The network helm is designed for large ships, especially
              those that get into frequent battles.  There is always one
              central helm, or node, in a network helm, and as many as
              four lesser nodes (for a total of five).  This central
              node is the focal point of the network and it must be
              occupied for the network to start up.  The spallcaster
              sitting at the central node can control the ship as if he
              or she were using a major helm.  If he or she is the only
              being in the network, then the ship can be considered as
              using a major helm.  For every other spellcaster in the
              net, however, the SR increases by one.  A fully manned
              network helm (five spellcasters) can create very high
              speeds, which are helpful in combat.  The other benefit of
              the network helm is that the secondary spellcasters in the
              network act as automatic backups for the main helm.  If
              for some reason the main helmsman is forced to leave the
              helm (injury, spelljammer shock, whatever), the network
              will automatically transfer power to the next highest
              spellcaster in the network.  The SR of the ship is then
              re-computed, and continues.  The highest level helmsman's
              spelljamming power is computed as if he or she were using
              a major helm, and then a single SR is added for each other
              person in the net.  These helms are very expensive, but
              come in handy on large ships.

Limitations:  Every spellcaster on a network helm looses their
              spellcasting abilities for the day, as with a minor or
              major helm.  Network helms are not recommended for small
              ships, because the high cost in both capital and
              spellcasting power is more than most small ships can
              handle.

History:      The helm was developed to enhance the SR of larger ships
              during the Second Inhuman war.  The technology was
              perfected a little too late to make a difference, but it
              is now available for those who have the means.  The
              Muldravian Empire sometimes uses them on Marlins, and the
              Elves have started installing them on Armadas.

XP Value:     None.

GP Value:     A network helm can be purchased for 300000 standard gold
              for the central node, and 50000 for each secondary node.



TACTICAL HELM

Appearance:   A tactical helm looks like a stripped-down minor helm.

Abilities:    These small helms are able to make a ship travel at
              tactical spelljamming speeds, as if it were using a minor
              helm.  Merchants who want to send cargo to opposite sides
              of a planet may find one of these a wise investment.

Limitations:  A tactical helm, as the name suggests, is not capable of
              spelljamming speeds.  For those who plan interplanetary
              voyages, the tactical helm is a poor choice.  For inter-
              stellar voyages it is unthinkable.

History:      The tactical helm, or devices similar to it, have been
              used by planetary travellers for centuries.  They have
              also been used to travel between asteroids in places like
              the Grinder and the Tears of Selune.

XP Value:     None.

GP Value:     100000 standard gold (variable)


----------------------------------------------------------------
BRACERS OF WILDSPACE
-This is an artifact, hence it being placed separately-
The following description comes from Lord Monitor, Imperium Arm
Magica, Of the Council of Nine of the world Tarrn, of Tarrnspace.
(As told to Eric F. Schetley, Copyright 1992)

     The Bracers of Wildspace are an artifact believed to be created
in the Omnispace crystal sphere, but reports have them appearing in
many spheres over the centuries.  The bracers, according to the rumors
and heresay, were originally something completely different, when they
were fashioned on the planet Omni in it's first Age of Magic (which,
sages believe, is some 3,000-plus standard years past).  Some of their
original abilities still exist, but most of the power has changed with
the passing of time.
     The bracers have changed in appearance, also.  Originally they
were fashioned from bronze with intricate runes carved into them.  For
reasons still unknown, the metal has changed into something which
resembles the same material which compromises a crystal sphere.  The
bracers are now completely black, and the runes which first adorned
them are now points of light.  These points of light are actually the
constellations of the sphere in which the bracers are in at the time.
For example, if the bracers were found in Krynnspace, the white
"lights" on the bracers would appear in the patterns of Krynnish
constellations.  Should the bracers found in the Phlogiston, the
bracers will appear completely black.
     The bracers are very powerful artifacts, yet only warriors may
wear them.  The reason for this is yet unknown.  Anyone else
attempting to wear the bracers will be unable to lock the bracers into
place.  The bracers, when worn, appear seamless, but if not found on
someone, are actually hinged!  The two halves lock into place around
the arm, magically growing or shrinking to fit the needs of the
wearer.  Any hinge or lock disappear once they are on someone.  No
harm befalls anyone not of the warrior class when attempting to put on
the bracers: they merely fail to lock into place.
     The Bracers of Wildspace have many powers.  It is rumored that
not all of the powers have been discovered.  To date, these are all
the known abilities of the bracers.
     (The Bracers of power, it should be noted first, grow in power as
the warrior grows in "level."  Role-playing abilities will be listed
first, while actual game statistics will be listed in parenthesis
afterward.)
     Depending on where the warrior is, whether it be in wildspace,
planetside, or in the phlogiston, the bracers have different
functions.  Their planetside abilities will be discussed first.
(Unless otherwise noted, the `planetside' abilities can be used in
wildspace or the phlogiston also.)

PLANETSIDE
~~~~~~~~~~
     The bracers, when placed on the warrior, first impart greater
strength.  The warrior, at first, is not accustomed to his new
strength, but soon grows used to it.

     (The following chart is to be used to determine the new Strength:

    Current STR Level             New STR Level
       3-16                          Add one level
       17                            18(roll for exceptional STR)
       18(18/01-18/00)               19
       19 and up                     add one level

          The PC suffers a -1 to hit penalty until he becomes used to
his new strength {1d4+3 days}.  After the PC gains advances to his
next level, make the PC roll a save vs. Polymorph.  Failure means that
the PC has gained extra bulk and must subtract 1 from his Dexterity.
Making the new throw means no penalty.)
     The bracers also reflect the character's alignment, by way of
emitting CONTINUAL LIGHT at will.  The glow from the bracers will be a
pure white for good characters, a dull beige for Neutral characters,
and darkness will come from the bracers for evil characters.
     (Please note: If a mage has cast a spell on the character to mask
his alignment, this will not affect the glow of the bracers.  They
reflect the "inner light" of the PC, and will not be affected by any
change.)
     The bracers act as magical armor for the warrior.  The bracers
provide a magical defense constantly for the warrior.  The bracers
will not provide these benefits, however, if the warrior wears other
forms of protection.
     (The bracers lower the AC of the warrior 1 point for every two
levels of experience.  For example, a 1st level warrior has an armor
class of 9, while a 20th level warrior has an AC of 0.  This benefit
is not activated if other armor is worn, either magical or normal.  A
shield will not affect this.  The bracers also confers a 5% Magical
Resistance for every two levels to the PC.  This cannot be turned on
or off at will: it works on spells whether they help or harm the PC.)
     Also, once per week, the bracers can locate Dimensional rifts.
Upon Mental command, the bracers begin to glow, then the warrior
begins to levitate (as per the spell: 1d10 feet.  Watch for low
ceilings) and spin very quickly.  After a few seconds, the glow
intensifies and "flies" from the warrior in the direction of the rift.

The warrior knows the direction and the distance of the rift, but not
where it leads.
     (This ability will not work in Wildspace or the Phlogiston.  Role
play this carefully: if the PC is indoors when he tries this, warn him
that he may bump his head on the ceiling.  Also, the "bolt" is the
color of the PC's alignment, as detailed in the Continual Light
paragraph.  The destination and location of the "rift" is up to the
DM.  Should the PC use this ability in the planes, then the PC may {at
the DM's discretion} choose their destination, with at chance of
5%/per level chance of success.)

WILDSPACE
~~~~~~~~~
     In wildspace, the Bracers become their most powerful.  Depending
upon the circumstances, they will help in combat or help escape,
whichever your needs might be.
     The Locate Dimensional Rifts ability does not function is
Wildspace.  Rather, the Bracers can locate portals in a crystal sphere
within a 1,000 mile per level coverage of the sphere.  Should a portal
be located, the warrior knows where it is and while passing through
it, the bracers will not allow the portal to close.
     (Pretty self explanatory, dont'cha think?)
     Should no portal be located, the bracers, once per week, can
Create a Portal in a Crystal Sphere!  The portal will be large enough
for the Warrior's ship to pass through, then close as soon as the ship
is through.
     (This takes one full turn of concentration on the PC's part to
open such a portal.  Should the PC's ship be part of a fleet, the
portal will not remain open long enough to let the entire fleet pass
through.  The portal will close as soon as the ships begins to pass.
Consider this a Ship Halved roll according to the Spelljammer Boxed
Set.)
     Should combat be required, the Bracers draw upon the inner
essence of the warrior and provide a powerful offensive weapon.  The
warrior, up to three times per day, can project a powerful Cone of
Force from the bracers.  The cone is powerful enough to cause serious
damage to either a ship or to it's crew.  The cone of force is
extremely powerful: if not careful, the warrior might be knocked off
his own ship!
     (CONE OF FORCE: In order to use this ability, the PC MUST be
braced up against something that will stand the shock of something 2
times his weight {A saving throw may be made by the DM if he/she
wishes}.  The cone, when projected, goes in one direction while
forcing the PC the opposite direction.  Even if a character is bracing
himself, and isn't against something, the PC will be forced back, more
than likely off the ship.
     The cone of force is projected in a straight line.  The distance
the cone can travel is determined by the PC's Level and the chart
below:

       Character's Level             Distance of cone (IN HEXES)
             1-6                           Same hex.
             7-10                          1 Additional Hex
            11-16                          2 Additional Hexes
            17-20                          3 Additional Hexes
             21+                           1 hex/ 7 levels

     The cone can be used two different ways, and the PC must announce
which method he intends to use before attacking.  If the PC is unaware
of the different attacks the Cone can make, then Attack mode 1 is used
by default.
     ATTACK MODE 1: Ship damage.  The PC must make a THAC0 roll, with
a -4 Called Shot Penalty.  If successful, the PC inflicts 1 Hull point
of damage per level.  If the ship is destroyed by the attack (I.E.,
the total number of points damage taken by the ship is more than the
ship's current Hull point total), the ship is permitted a saving throw
(whatever material it is mostly compromised of) versus Disintegration.
If it fails, the ship is destroyed and the Air envelop begins to
dissipate.  If the ship makes the save, the crew of the other ship can
"hold the craft together" long enough to hope for a crash landing
somewhere.
    ATTACK MODE 2: Ship crew attack.  This is more difficult.  The PC
must make a THAC0 roll with a double called shot penalty (-8).  This
is because the PC is trying to hit a ship someone on a ship a good
distance away from him.  I don't care how good the PC is, this ain't
easy.  Should the attack be successful, EVERY CREW MEMBER ON AN
EXPOSED DECK IS KNOCKED OFF THE SHIP.  THERE IS NO SAVING THROW.
     If the DM thinks that this is too powerful to use in his
campaign, then the second mode is optional.)
     PLEASE NOTE:   The Cone of Force will NOT work in the Phlogiston.
It only works in Wildspace.
    One other power the Bracers offer, whether it be in wildspace or
the Phlogiston, is a constantly regenerating air envelope.  Should the
warrior be forced off his ship, his air envelope will never foul: The
bracers will keep the air pure.
    (Of course, the PC will still be effected by Hunger, cold and
whatever else the PC needs.  Hey, he may starve before another ship
finds him, but at least the air will be clean!  This ability will only
work on one person:  it will not refresh the entire ship's envelope.
Should the air on a ship go deadly, the bracers will keep the PC's
personal air envelope fresh.)

PHLOGISTON
~~~~~~~~~~
     One would think that the Bracers would be less effective in the
Phlogiston.  While most of it's abilities will not function, it does
offer some protection.
     The bracers's ability of continual light will work in the
Phlogiston, as will the armor, the replenishing air envelope and the
ability to locate portals (The Bracers will not open a portal outside
a Crystal Sphere.)  None of the other powers will work.
     The Bracers do offer one special power in the Phlogiston that it
can't offer anywhere else: Protection from Fire.  Should (the greater
powers forbid) the warrior come near a fire while in the extremely
flammable phlogiston, an aura (the same color as the continual light)
will appear around the warrior and fire will not harm him.
     (This is involuntary.  The PC has no control over this power.
This power will not work outside the Phlogiston.  Anyone near or
touching the PC will not be protected by this ability.)

SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE BRACERS OF WILDSPACE:
~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~~~~~
     As with any artifact of power, there are some things, as the DM,
you should know about.  The first, and most important, is that once
the bracers are placed on a PC's arms, they can never be removed.
Thieves can find no locks to pick, not any hinges to loosen.  The
metal is considered Unbreakable (even a saving throw of a 1 will not
harm the metal!) and with an AC considered near -20.  Once a PC
acquires these, they're stuck with them.
     There are only two ways to remove the bracers: Cutting off the
persons arms or killing the person.  It is possible to remove the
bracers, but it is strongly advised against.  Only once, in all of
existence, has anyone tried to use the WISH spell on the Bracers.  The
mage, whose name has been long forgotten, was utterly destroyed in the
process, and the world under which they stood was blown apart.  The
man who wore the Bracers survived, but soon died of starvation.
     The Bracers, also, are a prized artifact, and most Wildspace
races seek them.  It is believed that they were once the possession of
Illithids, the Neogi, and the Reigar.  The Arcane and the Dolwar would
love to purchase them, but would never go to the bother of actually
killing someone for them.  They have, as far as these bracers go,
patience.  They know that someday the current owner will die and then
they will try for them again.  The Giff have no interest in the
Bracers, for reasons no Giff will ever relate.
     The Bracers are never apart; In fact, they will not work unless
one being wears both of them.  They are magically connected, and will
never be found more than 3 feet apart of each other.  Should two
warriors try to wear one each, the bracers will not lock and therefore
not function.
     Clerics, Thieves, Mages, and Psionicists cannot use the Bracers.
It is rumored that because they concentrate on one "art" rather that
the warrior, who is more likely to try nearly anything once, they
cannot work.  The bracers work on all races, with one notable
exception: Gnomes.  Myths tell us that the creator of the Bracers
hated Gnomes.  They even work perfectly on Dwarves, which has been
known to shock even the most seasoned adventurer.  Imagine a Dwarf,
tossing off Continual Light Spells and opening portals in Crystal
Spheres!








                              NEW SHIPS

     This section contains some new ships that can be used to enhance
a Spelljammer campaign, or simply to add color to a space dock.

Description: The ship looks like a squat circular spider (a map
follows), made from the black adamantium that drow are famous for.
There are magic spells that automate almost every aspect of the ship
(meals cook themselves, beds are made).  The galley automatically
produces food and wine, filling empty containers, etc. The ship itself
is covered with grotesque carvings which are highlighted by permanent
faerie fires, etc.  Additionally, the ship has been treated such that
exposure to the sun
does not adversly effect it.
     The crystal sphere the ship is originally from is one that has been
taken over by the drow.  It has one major planet, where the drow have taken
over.  They were able to do this by the uniting force of an Emperor, a devotee
of the drow god of thieves.  The society is more lawful and less matriarchal
than normal drow society.  On the main planet, there are scattered houses that
still worship Lolth, but discreetly, and also pockets of various humans and
demi-humans.  The drow have took over 100 years ago, and through the use of
mighty magics, closed the gate to the fire elemental plane that fueled the
sun.  Hence the entire sphere is only dimly lit (source unknown) and is next to
impossible to get around in without infravision.  The drow use this ship mostly
to track down rebels (worshippers of Elistraee) who have hidden themselves in
among the dust clouds and asteroids of the sphere.  The other major drow
mission is the extermination of all demi-humans.  The humans are allowed to
live in poverty, and a few of them are kept in menageries in the major cities
where, due to the short human generation, they have devolved quite a bit.
Humanoids, on the other hand, are plentiful on the surface where the low status
drow are building cities.  At this point there is no warfare, since the drow
have a whole surface to expand onto.  Within 400 years, population pressure
will probably fragment the empire, and pluge the sphere into civil war.
     The Mage Spider is frequently used as a battle cruiser or spy
ship.  The size of the ship, and the ability to land on planets,
allows for a variety of uses.  They are sometimes used as escort
vessels for a Jade Spider, when circumstances permit.  Exactly how a
Mage Spider is used depends on the will of the Drow Flotilla commander
in question.
     Crew consists of a priestess and 2-5 underpriestesses, a mage and
1-6 apprentices and crew men and women to fill the remaining spots.
The priestess is always of higher level than the mage, and wields
supreme authority.  Typically, the mage is of at least 11th level.
Rarely, suicide ships are found with an all male crew, but these are
sent only on desperate missions.
     The drow also have a creation that is used on these ships for long
voyages.  It is a golem, made of Drow body parts.  These golems tend to be only
5'6" in height, but otherwise have the same statistics as a flesh golem.  The
only other advantage is that the golem can pilot a ship, following directions
(go toward, go <direction>), or going to any place the golem has been using
some kind of inertial tracking or perfect recall.  The golem can fly a ship
with a SR of 1.
     The drow mages invented them to use for long trips, since they are the
only ones who ever fly the ships.  The priestesses consider it beneath their
dignity to actually sit in a spelljamming helm, and they also dislike losing
their spells.

Map of faernorbb -
Entry to the ship is by a ladder that extends from the mouth of the
spider at the will of the spelljamming mage.

                          \_/

     Rooms 1, 2, 3 and 4 all contain a ballista, and 20 bolts for the
ballista are in a closed box on the left side of the ballista.  The
ballista can pivot about 10 degrees in any direction, and points
toward a 'dark window', set in the section where the wall begins to
curve in all 4 rooms.
     The trapdoors lead to storage areas.  Small and usually empty.
The storage areas hold acid for dealing with regenerating creatures,
spare arms and armor, and some reloads for the weapons.  A careful
search might (5%) reveal an item enchanted to +2 (or better) of drow
adamantium, or a specific spells component (90% for level 1 spells,
-5% per level of the spell above 1 (valued below 100 gp, i.e. no large
powdered diamonds or the like)).
     Basically, the storage area is cluttered with junk.

                          \_/

     On this level the 'head' does not connect.  The head has a chair,
where the golem sits (the helm), and a table, with various maps and
charts.  There is a large 'dark window', giving a 135 degree view out
the front.
     The golem is a 6' tall flesh golem made from drow (i.e. black
skin, white hair) which can be used to pilot the ship.  The golem can
take the ship anywhere it has been, and can follow simple directions.
It moves the ship with SR 1.
     Rooms 1 and 3 are the bedrooms, 4 the barracks, and 2 the galley.

     Level 3-                   ___
                                |l|
                                | |
                                | |
                               /   \
                              |  C  |
                               \___/

     This level is set on top of the ship, but under a 'dark window'.
The window form a half circle arching over the passageway, and a
hemisphere over the catapult (C).  Rocks for the catapult are set in a
large closed box, at the bottom of the room.
     The 'dark windows' are a spell effect that is like a VERY dark
pair of sunglasses.  Drow can see through them like normal lighting,
since they have sensitive eyes, but humans and other surface dwellers
see only a flat grey landscape (or whatever).

Other Configurations: No variations on the Mage Spider have yet been
encountered. One was seen using a crew entirely composed of golems and
other magical creations, but the craft scuttled itself before its
mission could be determined.

Description: The Gnomestar is the ultimate nightmare in Krynnish Gnome
technology, surpassing even the Gnommish Dreadnaught.  Only three of
these monsters exist, and all of them perform The-Highly-Honorable-
Task-Of-Preventing-Dangerous-Beings-and-Those-With-Malevolent-Intent-
From-Landing-and-Disrupting-the-Social-Fabric-of-the-Good-Peoples-of-
Krynn.  Most other races call it planetary defence.  For their credit,
the Gnomestar is pressed to the rafters with every type of weapon
available, and the worst part is, they all work.  Gnomish soldiers
consider it a great honor to work on a Gnomestar, so they spend all of
their time cleaning, maintaining, and repairing the weapons.  Only
when a Gnomestar lands does it undergo modifications and
"improvements."
     The Gnomestar looks vaguely like a clipper with the masts
removed, and the bowsprit replaced with a blunt ram.  The ram is
covered with all kinds of chimes, bells, and whistles to tell an
opponent that they are about to be rammed.  The decks are filled with
weapons of all types (as many as the ship can physically carry),
including standard heavy weapons, bombards, magical devices, personnel
catapults (for boarding actions), and so on.  The armament of a
Gnomestar changes with each tour of duty.  A total of six sidewheel
houses are on the ship (three per side), with a hamster in each one.
The sidewheeler technology is not appropriate for a ship this size,
but as always, Gnomes found a way to make it work.  Nevertheless, the
ships rating is downright bad.  It can be raised from one too two, if
the Gnomes put a treat in front of the hamsters.  This causes them to
run on the treadmills faster, giving greater output of the engines.
This can only be done for three turns.  After that, the engine
overheats and breaks down is a spectacular display of smoke, sparks,
and flying parts.  When this happens the Gnomes drop everything and go
into a hilarious frenzy of repairs.
     Gnomestars stay in orbit above Krynn for periods of six months.
They work in staggered shifts, such that two are above Krynn at a
given moment.  The third is docked at Mt. Nevermind for maintenance,
upkeep, repairs, modifications, improvements...  Each Gnomestar has a
crew of 100 Gnomes (smaller beings require less air, so more can be
crammed into a ship) and eight giant hamsters.  The cargo area is full
of supplies, such as food for the crew, so space for other cargo is
rarely available.  Orders from the ground are relayed by a special
Yaul, powered by one of the hamsters.

Notes: No other race would be fool enough to want one of these.  If
you drop by Krynn and see one, send up the flag for "hello," politely
wave, and keep going.

Description:  The Great Tyrant is a new design used by one of the
beholder nations in its wars with the other factions of the race.  It
looks like a giant cinnamon roll, with six large crystals along the
rim, each 60 degrees apart. The inside of the ship is a honeycomb of
passages for the beholders, while the hive mother resides in the
center.  The orbi are in three small chambers just off the center one.
There is surprisingly little data on this ship, simply because it is
so rare.  Only three confirmed citings of the craft have been made,
and an comparison of the markings suggests that only two of these
ships exist, and they are both owned by the same nation.
     Most beholder ships are 50 tons or less because of the
restrictions of the orbus helm.  The Great Tyrant uses a special type
of helm that combines the characteristics of an orbus helm and a
series helm.  If five orbi are placed in one of these special helms,
they can give a ship of 50 tons or more, a SR of one.  The Great
Tyrant is equipped with three such "terminals," giving it a SR of 3.
The mere fact that the beholders have developed (or acquired) this
type of technology is rather disturbing.
     The crystals of the Great Tyrant are the same crystals that the
beholders use in their smaller ships, for pooling their magical powers
for use as a ship-to-ship weapon.  During battle, each crystal has 10
beholders and function as independent weapons.  It is also possible to
combine the power of every beholder on the ship and run it through one
crystal.  This makes the ship helpless for one turn, but the result is
devastating.  One witness, a tradesman crewed with humans and
halflings, noticed a Great Tyrant in the Grinder of Greyspace.  The
Tyrant was in the process of destroying a base used by another strain
of beholders, and when the bulk of the fight was over, the Great
Tyrant pooled all of its power to destroy the asteroid.  The asteroid
was the size of an Armada, and was reduced to small bits of rock.
That's when the tradesman fled.
     The Great Tyrant is a giant battle cruiser, and is designed to
destroy other ships.  That is all it is meant for, but it could be
used in other ways, such as a drop ship.  The ability to make both
hard and soft landings could make it a very versatile craft.  For this
reason, the Elven Navy considers the ship a threat.  If one beholder
nation was to gain supremacy over the others using these ships, it
could eventually threaten the elves, at least in some spheres.  For
the moment, the elves are watching and waiting, preferring to let the
beholders wipe each other out.

Keel Length:             200'
Beam Width:              20'

Description:   The Frilitary Man-O-War is clearly a variation of the
standard Man-O-War.  On a Frilitary, the distinct bend in the "back"
of the standard Man-O-War is absent, putting the entire fuselage on
the same plain.  Another difference is in the wing placement.  The
wings lie on a plane parallel to the body of the ship, somewhat like
those of an Angelship or Aracoccra Corbina.  The wings are placed this
way to allow planetfall, and to allow the grappling ram to function.
The "head" of the Frilitary has two bowsprits instead of one, and
these can be used as a grappling ram.  However, the grapple is only
effective against ships smaller than, or equal in size to the
Frilitary.  Hard landings are handled by a set of landing legs,
similar to those of a Damselfly.  The legs are made of very strong
metal (Mitheral is a common choice), and are grafted into the hull of
the Frilitary during construction.  Removing the legs destroys the
ship.
     In flight, the landing legs fall to the gravity plain of the ship
(folding up like those of a butterfly), and never interfere with
steering.  When a large gravity well is entered, the legs fall into
position, allowing the craft can be landed normally.  When the legs
are down, however, the ship does suffer a loss of maneuverability
(from C to D) and this loss will continue until the ship is free of
the offending gravity plain.  An asteroid or other small body is not
sufficient to pull down the legs.  To land on such bodies, the crew
must manually move them into place.  This is not easy (it takes two
turns), and fortunately it is rarely required.  Elven Armadas, and
major ports (like the Rock of Bral) typically have docking facilities
for standard Man-O-War ships, and these facilities are used whenever
possible.
     The Frilitary was introduced during the first Inhuman War, and
was used extensively during the second, as a drop ship for troops and
supplies.  Groups of them would descend on target areas, usually under
the cover of standard Men-O-War, or other allied craft, deposit their
quarry, and quickly leave.  In one noted case (during Inhuman War II),
a Frilitary was fitted with bombards, and the jettison was loaded with
greek fire.  This ship was used for strafing and bombing humanoid
ground targets, then landing to dispatch troops to secure the area.
Sometimes a single Frilitary was used as a command center for special
operations or commando missions: While on the ground, a ship can be
very difficult to find.  Since the close of the wars, however, the
Frilitary has fallen out of favor, especially since the Imperial Navy
is nervous about landing ships powered by major helms.  Still, the
navy maintains a handful in mothballs, and new ones are built from
time to time.  Simply put, a Frilitary can go places a standard Man-O-
War can not, and human built ships are not always available or
desirable.

Other Configurations: The only standard variation on the Frilitary is
the "Waterfly."  This version is built with a set of pontoons as
opposed to landing legs, and is designed to land on water.  This
variation is rarely used, even by elves, because the bloated pontoons
lower the armor rating of the ship by two places.  In the entire navy,
only one is in service.  When elves need to land on water, they prefer
to drop small boats from a standard Man-O-War or Armada.

Other Uses:  Military service is still the most common use for a
Frilitary, but it has a following in other circles.  Elven merchants
are very fond of the Frilitary. It is clearly an elven ship (something
they like), and the ability to make hard landings is very useful.
Free adventurers or all races are VERY fond of the Frilitary: The
grace and durability of a Man-O-War with the ability to land on
planets is an excellent combination.  The biggest problem with the
craft is finding one!

Description:  The Marlin-class battle cruiser, or "Warfish," is the
standard spelljamming ship of the Muldravian empire in the sphere of
Solaris.  It is large and ruggedly built, resembling the marine animal
for which it is named.  It is built along lines similar to a
Hammership, and it can be used in the same ways.  In fact, the
designers of the marlin derived the design from a hammership, with the
objective of finding ways to carry more cargo or passengers, without
making the ship bulky and clumsy, like a whale ship.
     A Marlin can be used as a warship, heavy freighter, troop
transport, and even as a mobile command center.  As noted above, the
Marlin can perform all of the tasks that a Hammership can, and in many
cases it can do them better.  It is unlikely that the Marlin will make
the Hammership obsolete for a long time, if ever.  The extensive sail
system of a Marlin is vital for the ship to maintain maneuverability,
and special training is required to handle them.  A special
proficiency is not necessary; anyone with the proficiency
"Spacemanship" can learn how to handle a Marlin if an expert is
consulted. Such experts are difficult to find, and when they are they
are either unwilling to help (claiming military secrecy) or charge a
very high price.  In short, the deck crew of a Marlin is difficult and
expensive to field.  In these cases most people would prefer to run a
simple, reliable Hammership, using a standard crew.  Another problem
is the cost of a Marlin's helm.  A Marlin requires a costly major helm
(or a newfangled Network helm) to operate.  A Hammership can operate
on a minor helm (however poorly), making it easier to afford.  Those
who have worked on a Marlin, however, swear by them.
     Marlins in military service typically travel in "pods" of three.
The Muldravian Empire has almost forty Marlins in service, and half of
them are on patrol within the Solaris sphere at a given time.
Occasionally, a single Marlin will leave the sphere on a specific
mission.  Such missions could be the pursuit of an enemy ship,
espionage, exploration, or political.  Outside of the Solaris sphere,
a Muldravian Marlin always has a specific mission objective.
     In combat, the Marlin is a formidable opponent.  It is
surprisingly maneuverable for a ship its size and it can withstand
large amounts of damage before breaking up.  It can easily defeat a
single Nautaloid, pirate Squid ship, even a Mindspider, and it can
usually prevail against a Hammership or Man-O-War, depending on the
crew.  A single Marlin with a full complement crack crew can even
defeat a Dreadnought, while two or three can defeat a Deathspider,
Jade Spider, or a renegade Armada.  Against such opponents, however,
high casualties are expected.  No Marlin pods have ever engaged a
Tsunami.
     While the external lines of a Marlin are sleek to the point of
elegance, the internal layout of a Marlin is very simple, and many
find it uncomfortable.  One commentator called it a "case study of
efficiency over ascetics."  There are many large open spaces with low
ceilings, the decks are connected by ladders as opposed to stairs, and
the main deck is dominated by the sailfin and shuttle cribs (see
below).  The large areas are provided for storing cargo, equipment,
and for use as crew barracks.  On combat and patrol missions, a Marlin
typically carries a full complement, with several mages and priests to
take turns at the helm, recharge the air envelope, and maintain food
and water supplies.  Solaris is an abnormally large sphere, so some
missions can run as long as eight months.  Espionage and politically
motivated missions (such as diplomacy with another sphere) typically
carry half complement.  Exploration missions also carry a full
complement, and sometimes the ship has additional rigging laced into
the sailfins to increase maneuverability (topping out).
     The main deck usually comes with two cribs for small shuttles, or
"skiffs."  They are usually stored with the mast removed, but when
assembled, these small ships look like sailboats with a fish-head
prow. They weigh about two tons, and can carry as many as six
individuals.  They are designed as landing craft only, and are powered
by a device similar to a "Rudder of Propulsion."  As such, they are
not capable of spelljamming speeds.

Other Configurations:  There are no standard variations on the Marlin
design, although custom designed ships exist.  Even though the Marlin
originated in the Solaris sphere, the design has began to appear
elsewhere, in a variety of uses.
     Merchant Ship: The most common alteration is for use as a
merchant vessel.  With the ability to carry more cargo that even a
Hammership, and with only a slightly larger crew, wealthy merchants
like the Marlin.  When stripped of its weapons, the Marlin can easily
make the transition from warship to tradership.
     Free Adventuring: Adventurers who have a lot of money sometimes
refit a Marlin for their own use.  Such adventurers typically need to
hire some crew to help handle the ship.  The Marlin is also a favorite
choice of mercenary companies, who sail between the spheres selling
their services where needed.  One such company operates openly in
Realmspace, and maintains an office in Waterdeep!
     Pirates: Sadly, pirates also like the Marlin.  Such groups tend
to be large and well equipped, often boasting several ships.  In these
cases, the Marlin is used as a command ship, while smaller ships do
the grind work.  Such is not always the case, however.  The piercing
ram can make short work of a Tradesman, and many pirates have
discovered this, much to their delight.  If you ever see a Marlin with
pirate markings, your best bet is to 'jam out of there as fast as your
helm will allow.
     Non-Human Crews: Though designed for Humans, the Marlin is also
used by Elves, often as a supply ship.  Halfling and Illusionist Gnome
crews are not uncommon either.  Krynnish Gnomes love the extensive
gear and pulley system for the sails, and often try to "improve" it.
Such ships usually end up impaled on an asteroid.  Illithids and other
"underworld" races dislike the ship, because of the large, open main
deck.  A company of Drow merchants are know to operate one, however,
and they have covered the main deck with an opaque net.


NAME:                    Seahorse
Built by:                Aquatic Elves
Used Primarily by:       Aquatic Elves, Tritons
Cost:                    45000 standard gold

Saves As:                Thick Wood
Power Type:              Major or Minor Helm
Ship's Rating:           As helmsman
Standard Armament:
   2 medium ballista, crew 2/ea, 1 port 180*, 1 starboard 180*
Cargo Capacity:          5 tons (see below)
Keel Length:             160'
Beam Width:              20'

Description:  The Seahorse is one of the few ships designed
specifically for an aquatic race, in this case Aquatic Elves.  The
Seahorse does not look like an actual seahorse, at least not at a
quick glance.  The lines of a Seahorse are similar to those of a
Dragonship, with the dragon masthead replaced with a seahorse head, in
a style similar to that of a viking ship.  The sails of a seahorse is
woven from a silky fiber drawn from kelp, and tend to shimmer in
starlight.  The hull of a Seahorse is often painted in a soft brown,
to resemble an actual seahorse.
     The entire lower deck of a Seahorse is flooded with water, and
acts as the crew quarters for the aquatic elves.  The extreme weight
of the water severely curtails the cargo capability of the Seahorse.
What cargo there is travels in the (dry) upper decks, and any
passengers the ship has will be there as well.  For any non-aquatic
race, a Seahorse is an unpleasant ride.  Everything is damp, and
seaweed tends to creep all over the ship.  Air can also be a problem,
because half of the ship is taken up by water.  The elves, being able
to breath both air and water, do not notice this of course.  When the
lower deck is drained of the water, a Seahorse has a cargo capacity of
seventeen spacial tons.
     In combat, a Seahorse is a fish out of water (pardon the pun).  A
substantial hull hit could cripple the ship, especially if the water
drains out.  The ship can hold its own for brief periods, but will try
to flee any combat it encounters.  To this end, major helms with
(relatively) high-level helmsmen are the norm.  The Seahorse is used
mainly as a transport vessel.  When cargo is to be transported, most
aquatic elves contract elven merchants (or members of other races,
depending on who is available) who use more suitable ships.  Aquatic
Elves rarely travel in space, but when they do, they use the Seahorse
when they can.  The only other race that has consistently made use of
the Seahorse are the Tritons, who use them as colony ships.  Lizard
Men have been know to use them on rare occasions as breeder ships, but
this is rare.  Most aquatic races find a trip to dry land a traumatic
experience, while a trip into space is more than most can bear.
Humans, humanoids and even other elves, pass up the Seahorse for other
ships.  Like the Arracocra Crobina, the Seahorse is simply not
suitable for anyone other that the race that builds it.








                       SPACEFLEETS AND NOTABLE GROUPS

     The fleets and groups noted here are minor powers on the grand
scale, but a GM could use them as diversions, or as a change from
larger, more established groups.


Illithid United Navy
     In a rather disturbing development, several of the Illithid
nations have recently united under a common banner.  The idea here is
to promote greater co-operation between the Illithid nations, which
would benefit all of them.  Non-Illithids have a more cynical
interpretation of this development.  If all of the established
Illithid nations united into a common unit, they could threaten every
space-faring race in existence, including the elves.  Typically, the
Illithid ships carry their own national colors, but also carry a
pennant representing the Illithid United Navy (IUN); this is a
practice similar to that of the Imperial Elven Navy.  The fleet
commander is an incredibly egotistical Illithid called Mind Sifter
(q.v).
     Fortunately, this federation of Illithid nations is still fairly
loose.  The member states do not openly fight one another, but they
don't always help each other either.  While the Illithid fleet is not
a major threat, it may one day become one.
     The fleet is known to operate in Realmspace, but they do not have
a lasting presence. They have also been sighted in Krynspace, but are
usually just "passing through."  Interpret that any way you want to.
In Greyspace the Illithids are a minor, but lasting problem.  They
maintain numerous bases throughout the system, but no central base has
been located.  Ships in Greyspace tend to take an offensive stance
when an IUN ship appears, and skirmishes are common.  The IUN has
recently began to explore other spheres as well. A recent spy mission
to the sphere of Solaris was foiled by a Muldravian commander,
Deliliah Ferrengal (q.v).


Li Shou
Solaris, Cartania, S'ing Ti L'ack
     Li Shou is similar to Shou Lung on Toril, and is one of the four
nations of Cartania that actively engage in spelljamming.  Li Shou
uses Dragonship vessels to bring back the treasures of other worlds,
but Li Shou also uses them as showcase vessels.  Even from a distance,
one can tell when a Dragonship is Li Shou (as opposed to Shou Lung or
privately owned).  The ship is covered with elaborate flags and
pennants that glorify the land from "The center of the Universe."  Li
Shou mapmakers believe that Solaris is the center of the universe, and
that Li Shou is the center of the Solaris sphere (at least from a
cultural standpoint).  When a Li Shou Dragonship sets down in another
land, it often makes a big display of itself as if to say "Look at me,
I am from Li Shou, center of the Universe." Trading is a secondary
concern.  The primary objective is to show off.
     Shou Lung captains find this cultural bravado rather amusing.  Li
Shou has passed up many good opportunities for trade because the other
peoples were "beneath them."  In such cases, Shou Lung wastes no time
in collecting what Li Shou was missed.  The elitist attitude has led
to a marked reduction in Li Shou spelljamming.  Since they have not
found many things that interest them in other lands, they are becoming
increasingly isolationist.  In fact, the Li Shou government is
actively trying to stop the use of Spelljamming technology, except for
those merchant vessels that use tactical helms to travel within the
empire.


The Missionaries of Celestian
Greyspace (based on Oerth)
     As the name suggests, the Missionaries are followers of
Celestian, God of the Universe.  They are somewhat different from most
followers of Celestian, in that they rarely sign on to other ships.
The Missionaries are a specific order of priests and paladins that
travel about on modified Barges of Ptah.  They actively search for
damaged ships, and when they find one, they immediately do what they
can to heal anyone on board who requires aid.  Failing that, they try
to get the injured party to a world or asteroid where better medical
facilities are available.  If even this is impossible (the person
dies), they make certain to grant the individual a burial in space,
with full honor.  To view a Missionary barge as a "hospital ship"
would be fairly accurate.
     This group is at odds with the followers of Ptah, as is to be
expected, but they do not fight.  In fact, the Missionaries only fight
other ships when they must.  The barges they use often have magical
devices or spells to increase maneuverability or armor rating.
     Most spacefaring groups let the Missionaries go where they will,
and NEVER attack them (even pirates let them pass).  The reason is
simple: you never know when you may need their help.  Those groups
that have offended the Missionaries in the past (the Tenth Pit for
example) have never received their aid, no matter how desperately they
need it.
     Sadly, many pirates have tried to take advantage of this "hands
off" attitude that most have toward the Missionaries, and have tried
to pass themselves off as members.  This has forced many leaders to
search the Barges before allowing them docking or landing rights.  The
most notable examples of this are the Kingdom of Ratik on Oerth, the
city of Waterdeep on Toril, and the Rock of Bral.  The Missionaries
understand this, but allow it to continue.  So far, the number of
pirate impostors has been quite low.


The Muldravian Empire
Solaris, Cartania, Chorrad'ek
     Of the four spelljamming nations of Cartania, the Muldravian
Empire is the most prominent.  This is to be expected, since it is
perhaps the largest single nation on the planet.  The Empire is
actually a highly co-operative group of small and medium sized states
that have pooled their resources for the common good.  Most of the
states are human, but there is a single halfling state that places
itself under the Muldravian flag, and one of the other states has a
significant Gnome population.  The Empire enjoys good relations with
several of its neighbors, allowing it to pursue other interests.
     About 250 years ago, a study was conducted on the capabilities of
"Sky Galleons."  Sky Galleons never traveled off-world (being powered
with Tactical Helms they couldn't get very far), but the belief was
that this was not always the case.  After several years, Spelljamming
Helms were re-invented, and the Muldravian Empire was the leader in
this endeavor.
     Of all the spelljamming peoples of Solaris, the Muldravians hold
the greatest presence, surpassing even the Elven Navy within the
sphere.  The Muldravian Stellar Navy (MSN) is about 100 ships strong.
Most of these are Marlin-class battlecruisers, with squid ships for
planetary defence.  The fleet is commanded from a Cuttle Command
(perhaps the only one is active service anywhere) that maintains a
fixed position over the Muldravian capital city. The Cuttle never
engages foes, however.  A small pod of squid ships is always present
to deal with intruders.  The Cuttle is jokingly called the "Muldravian
High Command."








                             NOTEWORTHY SHIPS

     These are specific ships, and can be used to "spice up" a given
adventure.  These ships are highly individual, and a history is
provided where appropriate.  They should create some wonderful
opportunities for role-playing.


THE IEN WANDERER
     The Wanderer is an elven Monarch armada, under the command of the
elven command center at Evermeet (Toril).  It carries a fleet of 20
flitters, and a single damselfly, as landing craft. It main mission at
present is to locate missing elven colonies, and try to re-establish
contact with them.  The Wanderer has been known to travel for two
decades at a time, looking for missing elves.  Should it be
encountered in an established sphere, it will either be returning from
a mission, or embarking on a new one.  If found in a backwater sphere,
it is carrying out its mission.  In these cases, the elves will be
glad to see people from the established spheres, claiming that the
wilderness can get lonely, even for an elf.  Visitors are never
permitted into the hull of the Monarch, but they are free to walk on
the flight deck and socialize with the crew.  The Monarch's captain,
Malath Resika (q.v) is an easy-going sort, who gets serious only when
he must.  When the Wanderer is forced into battle, he will use every
trick he knows.
     The admiralty at Evermeet maintains a continuous link with the
Wanderer, using a bewildering array of magical devices.  As such, the
Wanderer can be quickly recalled if needed (as was done for the Second
Inhuman War).


THE HAPPY VOYAGER
     At a first glance, the Happy Voyager looks like a standard Bardic
ship, looking like a huge mandolin.  When the ship is approached, one
can clearly see singing and dancing on the main deck of the ship,
while below decks there is an ongoing glut of liquor consumption, sex,
and all kinds of illicit behavior.  In short, the Happy Voyager is the
biggest party in the known spheres.
     In truth, it is a travelling hell.  The ship is cursed, much like
the Batship, such that anyone who boards the ship must make a saving
throw versus magic EVERY ROUND, or become captured by the ship.  Once
captured, the individual becomes compelled to join the party, and he
or she will continue to party until they fall to the deck in
exhaustion.  The character will sleep normally, noise level not
withstanding, and awaken normally.  For a few minutes after waking,
the character will be aware that they are on a cursed ship, and their
thoughts will be on getting OFF!  Sadly, this level of awareness ends
quickly and the character returns to the party.  This happens to every
person on the ship, and sometimes a few of them try to pull together
long enough to assume control of the ship and smash it into the
nearest asteroid (the only known way to break the curse is to destroy
the ship), but the curse reclaims them every time.  What's more, the
rest of the crew do everything they can to stop the "party poopers."
    The Happy Voyager was once an adventure ship, led by a bard.  On
one adventure, the party had some incredible luck defeating a some
rather loathsome humanoids.  They returned to their ship and started
to celebrate, no holed barred.  However, one of the humanoids had cast
a wish spell (probably from a ring) before expiring, condemning the
party to some type of eternal damnation.  The dietie who carried out
the wish had a "humorous" streak and decided that the upcoming
celebration should last forever.  Thus began the travels of the Happy
Voyager.
     The aging process is suspended while aboard the ship, so the
original crew is still on board, partying themselves silly.  As soon
as someone is forcibly removed from the ship, the character rapidly
ages to their normal, chronological age.  Should the ship ever be
destroyed, the original crew, and many of those who have joined since,
will age to death in a matter of minutes.
    The Happy Voyager has been travelling the known spheres for almost
a century. Others have joined over time, usually boarding out of
curiosity, and never getting off.  There are about 45 people on the
ship, and many races are represented.  There are humans, demi-humans
of all types, a couple of giff, a few humanoids, and even a neogi who
thought the ship would be an easy place to get slaves.  The neogi is
known for telling sick jokes.
    It can be considered a standard Iambic ship (Bardic ship), except
that the curse ensures that the air is always fresh, the larder is
always full of food, and the wine skins never dry up, and any injuries
suffered by the crew are healed as they sleep.  This party could,
literally, go on forever, and the crew can't do a thing about it.


THE GOODSHIP ORION
    At one time, the Orion was a pirate Hammership, but it has been
modified so much that the original owners wouldn't begin to recognize
it.  While still a Hammership is overall design, it has the following
modifications:
    a). It's wood and glass hull has been rebuilt from the keel up
with an Adamantium hull and Crystal portals.
    b). Boarding nets to delay the boarding attempts have been added.
    c). Additional Sails have been added to Improve the ships
maneuverability class (topped out).
    d.) The ships armament consists of 1 Heavy Ballista, and 2 Heavy
Catapults.
    At the bow of the ship rests a statue of a giant space hamster,
posed in an attack position, fangs bared, and rumor has it that the
ship flies as part of the Great Prince Andrew's Anti-Pirate protective
league (see below).  The ship is painted the darkest black, with a
blood red undercarriage.  When seen in port, its crew never seems to
leave the ship.  This may be just as well, because they are the
meanest looking bunch of lizard men and (believe it or not) elves ever
seen in wildspace.  Their captain is a truly terrifying man.  He wears
a full suit of plate mail, complete with helm which he is never seen
without.  While this might not seem very extraordinary, the fact that
from the back of the suit extends a pair of metallic wings, which
allows the captain to soar through wildspace, is.  Rumor has it that
he was a test subject of mindflayer experimentation.  What the truth
is, the world may never know.
     Alright, I'll call the above the player information.  As for the
DM, well now...
     The Great Prince Andrew is a human ruler of a space-faring
community known as Branalin.  Branalin is located on a small moon in
orbit around a gas giant.  It is also a city-state which depends
largely on trade.  While the moon is very high in valuable ore
content, it's incidently a terrible place to grow things, including
food.  Because of the frequency of these ores, and their products,
Branalin could have quite easily been susceptible to piracy.  In fact,
before Prince Andrews began his reign, piracy was a major problem.  To
combat this problem, he founded the Anti-Piracy league.
    To head this organization, Prince Andrews hired a former pirate,
Morgan Calamon.  While a very capable leader, Morgan's recruiting
style is more than a little harsh.  He believes in thoroughly testing
any prospective recruits, even before telling them about the secret
organization. His method of doing this is, basically, by setting them
up.  To further this ability, Morgan has gained a reputation as a
smuggler.  When he finds a band that seems capable, he hires them for
'a simple transport job.'
    While on the job, they are given a box containing a statue which
has a simple magic spell cast upon it so that it would appear
enchanted.  The recipient of the box is a beholder by the name of
Marinox.  Marinox is moderately senile, but still competent.  During
the trip, Morgan has the ship hijacked at least once.  If the team
succeeds with the mission, further such jobs are later assigned.
Gradually, Morgan prepares them to join the league.
    The crew of the Orion were the first such team Morgan hired.
While he did test them quite thoroughly, he went a tad bit too far.
For in the process of the testing, he accidentally convinced them that
he was their arch-enemy.  Needless to say, things went poorly.  The
crew ended up making a pact with a mind-flayer who used the ships
captain for some testing of experimental magics, in return for
protection.  While ultimately things did work out, and the crew does
now work for Morgan, the crew does have some strange personality
quirks as a result of the mind-flayer association.
    The biographies of the crew are sketchy, so they do not have full
entries in the "personalities" section.  There is reason to believe
that nobody wants to get close enough to interview them, but here is
what is available.
    The Ship's Captain is C'Sid Tcapmoc.  C'sid is a 14th level human
ranger, who has undergone Illithid experimentation.  Due to this
testing, C'sid is unable to remove his plate mail or helm.  However,
his plate mail also contains wings which allow him to fly at 30' with
a maneuverability class of A.
    The Ship's Chief Spelljammer is Pyro-Lite.  Pyro-lite is an
eccentric 16th level mage who has an intense fascination with
fireballs.  Basically, he tends to lob them toward any foes,
inconsiderate of where the ships fighters might be.
    The Ship's Secondary Spelljammer and Quartermaster is a priest of
the Stars known as Patriarch Rudolpho.  He's a 14th level priest,
who's not at all above using a mace when necessary.
    The next figure is one not commonly seen on spelljamming craft,
but one used by the Orion.  This is the ships 'Transporter Chief.'  A
Human Psionicist named Markos, whose specialty is Dimension Door.
Markos generally helps the boarding party to attack by opening a
dimension door across to the other ships deck, quickly transporting
10-15 members of the crew into the heart of the fight.
    Lastly, the ship's Sergeant at Arms is a 14th level Dwarven
Fighter named Ralth of Clan Arkfire.  Ralth's major quirk is that
after years of working along side Pyro-lite, he now hates mages.  He
passionately despises all those who use magic haphazardly, and thus
generally attacks anyone who starts making strange gestures in his
general direction.
    The normal members of the crew are all 3rd level Lizardmen and
Elves. The crew is well experienced and has travelled throughout
Wildspace, logging at least 14 different Crystal spheres.  The only
foe they truly fear would be a mindflayer or beholder ship, and even
these would be willingly fought if the situation arose.








                                TRAVEL LOG

     This section contains three worlds created by Ville Lavonius, and
can be used as an appendix to the "Practical Planetology" (tm) guide.

HETHLA

Hethla is a venus-sized Earth-world, but differs from the more usual
earth worlds in many ways. The planet's crust is so thin that in most
places the magma underneath has leaked through, forming great lava-
lakes, or an even better expression would be lava-oceans, since they
cover approximately 90 % of Hethla.  Consequently the surface
temperature is uniformly around 400 C, and doesn't much vary during a
day.

The sophonts of the planet (red-skinned, short and thin humanoids)
live on the few big (and high enough to provide shelter from the
scalding heat) basalt formations scattered around the hellish seas. In
addition to these human-like creatures, Hethla is inhabited by giants
living on immense ships sailing the lava. Animal life is pretty much
non-existent on the basalt plateaux, but the seas have a wide variety
of iron-based life. Also, circling high in the winds from the hot seas
float  bolha, jellyfish-like, transparent creatures that form an
important part of the humans' diets. The few species of wildlife  big
enough to pose a serious threat to most humanoids are all  very rare
(for example the 16-legged spider-like spinfishers  that prey on all
seaborne creatures). But there exists, however,  a dire threat to all
life on Hethla. Magmamen (usually shortened  as magmen), creatures
totally alien to the normal sapients, have  been attacking settlements
since times immemorial. Since it is  impossible to explore the depths
of the seas, it is unknown  wherefrom they come from. It has also been
proved fruitless to  reason with these 6' tall fiery brutes, parlay
(via telepathy or  some other means) has been successfully attempted
tens of times, but peace hasn't been achieved since there's absolutely
no  communication between the creatures themselves, they are nothing
but singular killing machines.

Of course, it would be very unlikely to have a species evolve all by
itself in such hostile conditions, and both the giants and the
humanoids (treated as humans in game terms) acknowledge their
blue-skinned gods as their only means of survival. These 'gods' are in
fact Arcane, who apparently have transported these men and giants to
Hethla (all epics have varying tales of voyages among the stars).
Every city has at least one Arcane, the biggest two (Raga and Mathluy)
both have five, and the tradecity atop the Spire has at least fifty.

And the Arcane take a very active role in managing Hethla,
spelljamming is almost routine an activity here, and the large fleet
has explored most of the sphere. The only reason why they haven't
spread around throughout the known spheres is the heat affinity of all
Hethla-folk, without a constant temperature of 40+ C, and elements of
the Hethlan food, they quickly begin to deteriorate, death is a matter
of weeks afterwards. And since there is no reasonable way to heat
ships in Phlogiston or preserve the foodstuffs, most voyages tend to
be short and confined to routes that they're intimately familiar with.

The airships are used to harvest the bolha, and to bring ice from the
polar regions back to the cities. Polar ice is another mystery of
Hethla, within a couple of miles the temperature turns from the
blistering heat to -20 degrees, without any temperate zone to speak
of. There are a couple of colonies on the north pole, whose
inhabitants live there a couple of months before returning to the main
islands to recuperate. The immense heat gets stored magically within
gigantic saws and these are used in separating the ice cubes from the
glaciers. The cubes measure 9 meters per side and are usually held in
the air while the ice melts, trying to land a ship carrying one of
these is quite risky.

The giants travel the seas in huge rafts carved from basalt.  Each
raft accommodates an extended family and they travel around the globe
nomadically, hunting the sea animals and preparing the few edible bits
ready for consumption and creating magnificent art objects off the
remaining parts of the bodies. The rafts are a very safe mode to
travel, the seas are almost never choppy, and usually the on board
navigator can detect disturbances in the convections beforehand. And
there are no animals in the seas that could attack the rafts, the only
hazard are the magmen, but they have learned that the giants are much
tougher customers in melee than humans, after all, spending your
entire life at 300-400 C, does make you quite resistant to heat. The
giants take to spelljamming much worse than the humans, needing the
high temperature to stay alive, at lower temperatures they quickly
'freeze' (ie. their metabolism and blood circulation are at least
partly based on liquid metals. They are very much saddened by this,
and feel a justifiable anger toward the gods who claim that they need
to find a way of keeping warm by themselves.  Some cynics might even
say that the Arcane don't even know if such a way exists, as it's
suspected that the giants' ancestors were quite different from the
modern ones.  Historical evidence has it that the giants were much more
like the men, and lived in the cities. What caused the transformation is
unknown, and all the history traditions and books are pretty hazy when it
comes to giants' history.

The cities on the basalt plateaux are commonly very big, there's no
need to have any villages around to provide food. They are usually
sited near a lava shore, but still respectably far from it (a high
cliff is an ideal place), the lack of earthquakes means that the
cities can be founded in most hazardous spots too. The main features
of the cities are the landing areas for the local airships (usually
10-20 per city) which are also used as common marketplaces. The
cities' populated areas are usually uniformly designed, most of the
citizens live in the same kind  of houses. There isn't any class
system on Hethla, the only people living 'above' others are the
priests, who in addition are in charge of justice too. All other folks
could be considered freemen in normal terms, slavery is unknown on
Hethla. Another very unusual thing is the importance of big
reservoirs, all cities have multiple artificial lakes within them. Not
only are they needed as drinking water, but as the main means of
defense against the magmen. Every city has several engineers who
contribute to the design of these, the most common method is to have
long hoses constructed of thousands of processed bolha skins, and
water bombs (capacity 10 l) are given out to every citizen leaving
town. Lately the engineers have been trying to cooperate with the
mages to create a 'water gun', but so far the experiments have been
more or less failures.

In addition to the nutritious and very light bolha, the humans eat a
specific kind of lichen growing only near the lava seas (the mean
temperature of the site has to exceed 100 degrees). It is collected by
scraping if off the basalt, it isn't that hard a work, basalt being
very smooth stone. The work is dangerous however, since the most
prolific sites are vertical, and collecting from ships isn't done very
often. The lichen contains a lot of nutrients, and therefore only a
small ration is needed daily, a collector easily collects lichen
enough to feed a hundred others in a normal working day. The plant
regenerates quickly and sites are harvested in two-month intervals. A
harvesting team consists of two men, the collector and a 'backguarder'
who carries a huge backpack filled with water to both make working
possible in such hot conditions and to provide a means to hinder any
passing magmen. These two foodstuffs are basically the normal Hethlan
diet, variety is given by the awesome array of spices and other
delicacies traded from the giants.

The gigantic basalt tower, popularly known as the Spire, is the main
concentration of foreigners on Hethla. The temperature on the top is
about 25 C, pleasant for the most travellers. The lack of heat is
caused by both the height (the flat top is 16 kilometers from the lava
surface), and there's also some gates to the elemental planes that
provide ice and water to chill the city. The gates were constructed at
great cost, when it was decided that the trade would pay off such
fortunes. And the trade has certainly brought a lot of money to
Hethla, and the Hethlon has grown rapidly to the point where the
foreigners actually outnumber the locals.

The main trade items exported from Hethla are minerals that are either
dug up in the recently opened mines or bought from the giants. The
mining is very hard work, and the yields have been disappointingly
low, the mining companies (all foreigners, the concept of mining for
minerals is unknown on Hethla) are trying to find a way to back off
without losing prestige. The giants do trade their findings too,
either they are collected from the animals they have caught or
collected in the rare deposits found floating on the seas. Hethlans
import all kinds of materials, especially new foodstuffs get a high
price here (the Hethlans seem to have a very adaptable metabolism).

Also a big pro to all the 'new folks' on Spire is the number of Arcane
working there, most of the diplomatic envoys or exploration parties
are here just to gain more information on these enigmatic creatures.
Why these creatures have populated this planet and been watching over
the inhabitants for several thousands of years is a mystery. One of
the main features in all the stories concerning the gods is that they
have never given anything to their subjects since the earliest years.
Everything since then has either been invented by the humans (like the
defense mechanisms against magmen) or bought at an outrageous price
(the spells to create the gates). It has been suggested in more than
once that the whole planet is just an experiment in creativity and
adaptation.

Hethla has two moons, which are named Small and Big, the inhabitants
aren't usually that laconic, preferring elaborate names for meals,
creatures and such, perhaps these names are relics from a much earlier
era. The moons circle the planet in a normal way (Small has a lunar
month of 11 days, the larger completes its' journey in 33 days)
causing eclipses frequently. Though the moons exert a powerful tidal
force upon Hethla, there aren't tidal waves in the seas to speak of,
perhaps once or twice a year there's noticeable waves, but that's
about it. The moons have been explored, both by Hethlans and many
others, but no signs of life have been found on either. The smaller
moon spins at such a rapid rate that it has cast its' atmosphere off
ages ago. The bigger is just an average young earth-world, there has
been talk with the Arcane that the Elves would get to build a local
navy outpost there, but nothing definite has happened in years.

As mentioned in passing above, Hethlans regard the Arcane as gods.
However, in addition to these local gods they also worship an entity
known as Mhola (the protector of the sphere, the rider on the waves of
heat, the luckgiver), and through this worship the clerics gain their
spells. The arcane are thought to be sons of this Mhola (a gigantic
female figure), and they are in charge of justice and order. Financial
details are entirely in human hands. The giants' only god is known as
Booola (the eternal wader, the untiring worker), and giants too have
clerics, who have somewhat different spell repertoires than human
priests (complete spell lists aren't given for either, they both have
the usual spells plus many dealing with magma, fire and earth.  The
giants also have spells used to control Physique, and humans possess
many spacefaring magics). The priests don't get any but the most basic
of spells outside their homesphere, and this is another reason why the
Hethlans haven't much explored the world outside their sphere.

There aren't many mages on Hethla, since the clergy usually grabs the
most promising youths. However, the few mages that there is, are very
much individualistic and left alone by the common folk. Only the least
powerful of mages live within the cities, the others carve themselves
a citadel out in the basalt flats. Why they all are escaping from
civilization is a mystery, there certainly isn't anything unusual in
the wilderness.

The Arcane and their priesthood wield the law-enforcement powers on
Hethla. The society itself is very law-abiding, due to the extremely
severe sentencing of criminals. The most common way to get rid of
unwanted persons is to shoot them into the lava using the huge
Catapult of Fate, there's one in every city.  However, the Hethlans,
having been conditioned to harsh justice throughout generations abhor
the thought of crime, especially violent.  As such, there are no
familiar thieves' guilds anywhere on the planet, and the foreign
organized crime families are very subdued on the Spire since most
cases of executions are foreigners.

Compared to life on normal planets Hethlans have it very easy.  Food
is easily gathered for large amounts of people, cities stay in shape
for centuries without extensive repairs, due to a global unity there
hasn't been any wars for the last two thousand years, there isn't much
work to be done (a couple of hours per day is sufficient). And there
seems to be no cloud behind this silver lining, diplomats living on
Hethla have discovered no hidden secrets about the planet.

Scenario ideas on or near Hethla:

-*- Smuggling a priceless giant artifact (as in art object, the giants
aren't very handy with magic) to an offplanet client. The giants have
memories of elephants and will never forget the deed. And every time
the culprit returns to this sphere, the giant-priests spells will
notice him and he'll be the target of various nasty magics (boiling
blood, heat metal, personal drought and various others).

-*- Of course some PC or NPC commits a horrendous social gaffe and is
to be executed at dawn. A raid to the local temple is necessary (don't
make this happen in Hethlon).

-*- Mardigris, an enterprising Thri-Kreen captain has invented a very
good source of money. His agents (one in every city) provide info on
criminals to be executed. On the day Mardigris' ship, Unseen Voyager,
equipped with a cloaking device found in an Ancients' base is waiting
over the sea. The catapults cannot be moved and he has calculated
where the victim will land. Just before he hits the lava, he's
teleported to the ship and replaced by an illusion of splashing lava.
These special effects are performed by Lairin Squithla, an ex-navy
elf, who has found this form of piracy very profitable. The victim is
then given a chance to arrange a huge amount of money in ransom or
he's sold to the Neogi.

However, one of his recent catches was Janz Skillings, a Waterdhavian
noble, whose family paid the ransom. Now the lad has returned to cause
trouble in the Sphere. Hethlan officials are trying to figure how the
guy was saved (and he's not the only one, there has been rumors of
some others returning from the dead). How they will convince the PCs
that they should be shot from the catapult is another matter.

-*- Another common occurrence are the magmen wars, no PC should miss
these. A flowing melee fought in some 60 C, using weird weapons is
something to amuse the players for half an hour.

-*- The PCs are approached by a smuggler who cheated the giants ages
ago. His contract with some crime boss or somesuch forces him to stay
in this sphere. And he's at least annually victim of such wonderful
spells as untiring worker (a boon for the giants, not such for a
human, duration 7 days), fly (no control), lose the path (effective in
space too). He begs the PCs to go placate the giants, he hasn't dared
to set foot on Hethla since his deed.

After this scenario, it could be hard to persuade the PCs to try out
the first scenario idea.

-*- A mining company executive notices the PCs (obviously star hicks
who know nothing of honest toil) and tries to sell them a 'salted'
mine. At a very low price, the PCs might buy it just out of curiosity.

-*- Another mining company is looking into the exploration of the lava
seas. The giants report having sighted huge metal deposits floating on
the surface.

-*- The town of Ryu gets a wonderful idea, why not capture a passing
comet using spells and save the trouble to go watercarrying every
week. The PCs are hired to explore and, if necessary, sterilize the
comet (what it does contain, lowlife, stray mindflayers, some disease,
is up to you). And do the spellcasters succeed in bringing the comet
safely on the surface. Do the PCs escape the comet in time, or do they
plummet toward Hethla inside it. And do the citizens of nearby towns
really wish to continue to freeze in the polar regions when they could
just fly to Ryu and come back with a big chunk of ice.

-*-A hauler snaps a rope and the ship falls on the very-quickly
melting ice cube in the lava. The PCs have to improvise their rescue
attempt.

-*- The PCs are helping with the ice-men on the pole when they stumble
upon an Ancient-base under the ice (if every planet really has to have
at least one dungeon in your universe).

-*- A group of 'Radical Thinkers', an atheistic conspiracy, hires the
PCs to grab some books (ledgers, diaries) from an Arcane. They are
trying to figure out various mysteries of Hethla (and how much cash
have the Arcane already swindled).

-*- The RT manage to slay the Arcane in Magnamund, and the civil
unrest spreads quickly.

-*- The RT leader is discovered to be a disguised dizantar when PCs
storm their stronghold in the wilderness.

-*- When trying to form a stronghold on a moon on the outermost planet
in the system, the PCs are hired to protect the elementalist who's
going to excite a local volcano. The ceremony is performed within an
old dwarfhold that's full of undead.  Also, the elementalist sees
notices of earlier volcano-god activity in the stronghold and decides
to have the whole place explored completely. Either the PCs placate
the elemental god, and gain the Hethlans a new planet, or they get a
real close view of a planetary explosion.

-*- The Arcane organize the big auction on the Hiver-ship. In a week
of mock-battles, diplomatic parties and at least one theft attempt
(the PCs follow, there's only a few thieves so that the whole arsenal
won't be used against their ship) the PCs are caught in a web of
intrigue. The PCs learn of the major fault of the ship (no protection
on the underside), what are they going to do with their knowledge,
sell it to the highest bidder, inform the arcane, or what.


Helthlan Ships:

Haulers are flat, quite unseaworthy (MC E) ships used to carry ice
from the polar regions to the cities. One ship can muster a maximum of
700 tons (metric) of water, carrying it using four sturdy metal-ropes
underneath. The ship travels through space, using only tactical speed
due to the great load. The helmsman is usually a mid-level cleric or a
free-lancing mage. The defense isn't very good, but the area around
Hethla is kept safe from space vermin by conventional warjammers. The
ships are quite useless on long journeys, most of the deck space is
sacrificed to winches, extra ropes, spare harpoons and as such they
possess very spartan crew quarters and next to nothing cargo space.

Masher is a variation of Hammership, built of stone, and having a huge
lava pool in the midship-area. For weaponry it carries three heavy
catapults and an aft-firing heavy jettison. The crew consists of
battletrained Hethlans and hired mercenaries. The main danger to other
ships' survival are the spellcasters on board who routinely have at
least a few turn rock to magma- spells that are used very effectively
on stones just after the launching. These ships are commonly used to
protect the ice haulers by having them circulate the planet
constantly.

Airships are the most common form of transport on Hethla. These 20 ton
ships running with minimal helms haven't got much in the way of
protection, but due to their huge sails they're very maneuverable
(MC:B). They are also used to catch the bolha floating in millions
over the hot seas. For that activity the two biggest sails are
replaced with nets. In combat airships are helpless, but as they stay
near the cities or fly at low altitudes, they aren't expected to be
attacked by other jammers.

Hiver is a recent addition to the Hethla arsenal, only one ship has
been built thus far. The hiver itself is a heavily armed slow battle
platform, but its' brood is much more dangerous. These 10 ton ships
use a minimal helm (maximum size 20 tons, max speed 2, calculated as
with a minor helm) and carry a lava-gun, operated by a priest of at
least 5th level. The rarity of such priests means that these ships
won't grow in popularity soon. The ship had its test in a big fight
against neogi two years ago, and the Arcane are planning to sell the
plans to the highest bidder in near future.

The main shipyard on Hethla is on a big flat plateau near the Spire,
it can accommodate over 200 ships easily and has a big wet dock too
(cost is high due to massive evaporation). The hethlan shipbuilders
and architects are constantly trying out new designs and pestering the
traders to bring more and more wood here, as they are quite fed up
with building basalt ships all the time. The newest project is to
build a huge (at least 3 miles in diameter) garden on the plateau in
the deep quarries, and that's why several ships have been hired to
transport soil from more normal earth worlds. They have also hired
several mages to explore the variations in Plant Growth spells, most
druids consider this gardening an abomination.


Hethlan monsters:

The plateaux are very barren of life and the depths of the lava oceans
have never been explored, so most of the monstrous encounters occur on
the surface or nearby the lava-seas. And most 'monsters' are just
animals whom the PCs stumble across, only the magmen are real enemies.

The magmen are already familiar (from which MC I've no idea, I have
only the first one) and most of the animal life is just normal animals
having excessively high body temperatures, weird diets and high armor
classes.

There exists, however, a wide variety of strange creatures that have
adapted to the extreme nature of Hethla and could easily become
dangerous foes to most parties. No stats are given, use your
imagination (or pester me enough to type these up properly :-).

Spinfishers were already mentioned, these are huge, about 5 meter
tall, very spindly daddy longlegs-lookalikes that have quick reflexes,
metallic bodies and slow minds.

Holeshooters are a species of worms (or perhaps snakes) that live in
long tunnels they've drilled into the basalt. A couple of times an
hour they shoot toward sky at sub-sonic speeds trying to capture bolha
flying overhead and are then returned to their holes by their
rubberous tails. A collision with a ship would be most unfortunate.
The Hethlans have mapped most 'shooter areas and avoid them
vigilantly.

A new variety of life (it was first observed only a few years ago) is
the lichenscraper. It is a 3' by 3' metal cube moving slowly across
the plateaux. It is able to move on almost vertical surfaces without
falling, and consumes all lichen that it goes over. It has been put
forward that the 'scraper could be just a magical food-gathering
machine or somesuch.

Feel free to think up new creatures, but DO mail me the most bizarre
ones !

How to use Hethla:

As you have seen, Hethla is quite far from the usual fare offered to
the space-faring PCs. The planet could either be used as a place to
have adventures every time the PCs come here, or you could easily have
a campaign where the PCs are working for the Arcane, many of the given
scenario ideas are most easily fitted into a campaign of this sort. Or
Hethla could be the target of a coup of enormous proportions (using
the Radical Thinkers as a lever), after all, replacing the Arcane with
another absolute ruler wouldn't be a big change for the inhabitants
who have gotten used to being led by their noses during the millennia.


ILDIRS

Ildirs is a flatworld, with a radius of some 6 000 kilometers. It is
tidally locked (it always turns the same side toward it) with the sun,
and as such its' two sides feature very different kinds of life. The
planet spins around its' axis slowly (completes a rotation in 1200
standard days), as this hasn't got any effect on the surface, the
inhabitants hadn't even discovered this. Ildirs has got one moon with
normal circulation.

The atmosphere is standard on the top, easily breathable by most
civilizations, on the backside all the gases in the atmosphere have
long since liquified.

The planet is quite flat, the only major mountain is the spike
standing in the exact center of the world (height 10 kilometers), the
other areas are merely hills compared to this.

Since the planet is so far from the sun, the topside doesn't get very
hot. In fact, its' weather is regarded as one of the most pleasant
known to spacefarers, the temperature is an uniform 27 throughout the
year, the rains are very light and the lack of big ocean areas
precludes strong winds. The prevalent terrain type is rainforest,
though there are areas of hills and some deserts.

The backside is quite different, temperature there is so close to
absolute zero that all gases have solidified. There are hundreds of
thousands of gigantic **jpuikko** all pointing away from the sun. The
backside hasn't been explored but very briefly and from the safety of
a ship.

The top side features a complete, if a bit slow-evolved ecosystem.
Most of the plants there are bright red or purple in color, as to
better capture the light from the sun. And there hasn't been any need
for the reptiloid/amphibian lifeforms to step away from the throne,
birds are non-existent and mammals occupy only a small support role.

The vast forests covering most of the world are an eerie experience
for the traveller for the most part they are silent and instead of
birds there are large butterflies swooning about in the sunshine.
Sometimes an explorer can spot a rare winged frog (very poisonous) or
become the victim of an ignorant spider-killer tortoise (who leap on
the spiders from the trees), there are also many other forms of
jurassic life never before seen on other planets. There aren't,
however, any standard-issue dinosaurs found on Ildris, the creatures
only rarely attain sizes in excess of 2 meters. Another group of
animals mysteriously missing are the fish, they have been completely
replaced by amphibians in the few lakes and rivers.

On the clearings in the jungle lives a race calling themselves the
Njigra, commonly thought as black-skinned elves. Each clearing (size
2-10 square kilometers) supports a single family of these humanoids,
they are very warlike, and regard any creature not from their tribe an
enemy and a potential meal (foreigners only, they aren't cannibals).
Since the clearings are separated by vast tracts of jungle it wouldn't
be very common to have huge wars, but the Njigra have bred a species
who can carry them aerially. This Ymbla, or jet-frog, is a peculiar
creature and the elves constantly hone their skills in aerial warfare.
Battles are fought high over the surface and the casualty rates in
these fights are high (most projectiles are coated with a variety of
poisons). However, the wars aren't an all-for-all affair, rather the
Njigrae practice a fine art of diplomacy, where treaties can last from
a few minutes to decades. And the wars are always fought 'gentlemanly',
away from the villages and never endangering the innocent (especially
females and the young).

The other sentient race on the topside are the amphibian Tasloi, who
rule the rainforests around the biggest lakes. The Njigrae hate them
thoroughly but have no effective means to fight with them (the tasloi
keep to the ground all the time, and are as much familiar with the
myriads of poisons as the elves themselves). The tasloi have a
planetwide kingdom, ruled much like the Aztec nation: lots of gold and
jewels, voluntary sacrifices, priests rule the whole kingdom, most of
the skills used in building the large ziggurat-towns have been
forgotten, mentions of spacefarers in legends. These towns are immense
in size, probably the some of the biggest structures built by
normal-sized humanoids, each city can easily accommodate 20 000 (over
100 000 when crowded) tasloi. Their god-king lives in a palace in the
midpoint of the kingdom, this palace is built of black marble (the
other ziggurats are of more 'mundane' stones) and every ceiling is
lined with gold. Gold is very abundant in the jungle-regions of
Ildris, and tasloi have once had far reaching mines under the nearby
hills, nowadays they are largely deserted. The tasloi worship an
obscure pantheon of diverse deities (Glu'kk the Scribe whose priests
double as historians, Mna'gt whose priests alter all history according
to their own whims), who apparently all require constant sacrifices.

There's a single spelljammer outpost on Ildris, this Whitehold
consisting nowadays of perhaps twenty buildings, was founded by a
priest of Mystara from Toril some thirty years ago. This patriarch
laid down the laws that every visitor on the planet must obey or be
expatriated very quickly: no aid whatsoever is to be given to a
Njigra-tribe, no animals are to be released into the jungles, the
Tasloi shan't be pestered (the last expedition was eaten). These laws
sound pretty harsh, and many have thought that by disobeying them they
could end the wars on Ildris quickly. The patriarch died three years
ago, before his death he had gained quite a big congregation that is
carrying on with his work. There are perhaps twenty ships permanently
stationed to Ildris, and usually there's at least a few outsiders on
vacation here. The clearing where Whitehold stands is surrounded with
a broad moat, which contains a large number of crocks and water
snakes. This is used both to protect the travellers from Njigrae (who
seem to have difficulties in honoring any treaties with foreigners)
and to prevent any animals from invading the jungles (not that they'd
have a high life expectancies there, but the jammers have learned
their lesson from the Marinas-disaster). Most of the NPCs stationed on
Ildris are persons of a religious persuasion who are trying to show
the Njigrae the advantages in taking up religion instead of spear. So
far they have been totally unsuccessful in their attempts, their tries
aren't helped by the fact that most priests won't get their full
allotment of spells on Ildris. And this is a fact that has brought the
normally not very close priesthood into amiably working with each
other. With the tasloi isn't much contact, they live so far from the
Whitehold and have responded violently to every attempt to build a
base near them / explore their dwellings. Neither race has shown any
particular interest in spelljamming, but the tasloan legends are full
of stories with blue giants in sky chariots (apparently arcane who
gave up with these creatures probably due to the bloodthirst).

The darkside is a totally alien environment for all travellers. But it
is not totally devoid of life. Some of the largest **jpuikko** have
been hollowed out and are inhabited by the hateful Zalathi, the ice
goblins. They spend centuries in hibernation, but when an unfortunate
ship or a kindori-sized animal comes too close to their home, they set
forth in their coneshaped ice-ship to capture them (treat the **jp**
as a 100- ton ship equipped with a piercing ram) at amazing speed (SR:
10 for short bursts, this is the fastest ship known). The ships then
return to the planet using some sort of ropes. The darkside hasn't
been explored at all, the few crews trying that have either returned
with severe frostbites or fallen victims to these iceships. And it
really is improbable that there would be anything found among the
**jpuikko**.

Scenario ideas:

-*- A priest runs away from the Whitehold and joins a tribe. His
bosses are eager enough to get him back to pay the PCs a handsome
reward.

-*- A Njigra-tribe tries to gain the upper hand in a particularly
nasty war by trying to capture the PCs ship. They succeed and the PCs
are given a creaking damselfly to get their own ship back.

-*- The Rourke's Rift scenario where the Njigrae storm the Whitehold
en masse.

-*- A new priest of Cheslor hires the PCs to accompany him on a
'conquistading' trip to the Tasloi. When it doesn't go so well, the
PCs are polymorphed into Tasloi and sent over to investigate the
cities.

-*- The PCs discover the uppermost stories of Tasloan ziggurats to be
space ships, their engines eating gold. 40 ton ships made of stone,
lousy maneuverability (E), quite slow (SR: 2), no weapons usable in
space. However, the tasloi start approaching all manner of travellers
willing to pay absurd amounts of gold for viable weapons.

-*- The Tasloan gods return, and they _aren't_ the standard issue
Arcane, but evil in nature. This would be a good followup to the
previous idea, perhaps discovering the ziggurat-tops' nature was some
sort of a cosmic test. And the tasloi would have soon dwindled into
oblivion without the PCs' aid...


FLIM-FLAM - the great gnomic starbase

This 'ship' circling the local sun on a close orbit is one of the
fanciest ideas the gnomes have got lately. A rich gnomeclan liquidated
all their assets and spent all cash on used ships on Rock of Bral,
Refuge and many other famous shipyards. Instead of equipping every
ship with a helm they bought a couple of major ones and transported
the ships to this location over a time period of a standard year. Most
of the clan remained here and together they have patched a truly
unique structure of the few score ships brought here. There are almost
as many gravity planes here as there are ships and walking is at best
awkward, at worst dangerous.

Why the gnomes gave up their pleasant mountain on Oerth and travelled
to this godforsaken place is a complete mystery. And no gnome
interviewed ever gives the same reasons, some claim that here they get
awesome suntans, others tell about the elmarin-hunting trips, yet
another fellow told spoke about how the 24-h days perk up their giant
hamsters, etc. The gnomes have indeed taken up many different pursuits
after founding the FF, there's indeed a three-ship elmarin hunting
company, another fleet boasts with their exploits on every comet that
ever comes near (two so far).

No matter that the whole structure is thoroughly gnomish in fashion,
all doors are only 4' high and there's no night here, the place is a
big hit among spacefarers. They come here from all spheres to meet up
with old friends and to gain new, the whole place buzzes with rumors
and stories. The gnomes are making a fortune by asking truly
ungentlemanly prices for the hotel rooms and meals, but no captain
dares to leave his crew to live on the ship and lose his face, he buys
the best (and it certainly isn't that good) food for all of them. The
reason to all this is an artifact possessed by the gnome chief (an
illusionist of 10th level), it projects an aura of general goodwill
that has made FF such a safe place, it affects most races, neogi seem
to be the only immune ones (not that this would be general knowledge,
only the chief and a few assistants know of the Ball of Jolliness'
existence.)

Lizardmen have lately been asking whether they could lease a wing off
the base. They think that this could be a perfect place to let the
eggs hatch, the local primary is one of the yellowest stars in the
known spheres and the FF is a much more stable structure than any of
their broodships. The other races have been spouting various
displeased comments upon the matter and the gnomes are on the verge to
say no to the lizards. Secretly to all the lizardmen have already some
ten eggs smuggled here (not a crime, but they want to keep it secret),
they are disguised as barristerheads on their luxurious Sznnn'gk
dragonship (the ship hasn't moved in 6 months, the eggs are expected
to hatch in a few weeks now). What the offspring will be like, is an
open question, the lizardmen themselves think that they're going to
see the future of the scaly race emerge from the eggs.

FlimFlam consists of perhaps 100 ships nowadays, its' tonnage exceeds
some of the biggest dwarfholds and it has never been attacked
seriously, their fleet isn't that big, but the base itself packs many
orthodox weapons and some new inventions to surprise the enemies. FF
has never been moved and no-one expects the gnomes to be able to do so
anyway, even though they've installed large Steering Rockets on almost
every level surface on the outside. These rockets apparently burn
powder, at least a dracon captain, whose ship was 3/4ths vaporized
during a test run claims so.

The FlimFlam isn't a nation and there aren't any embassies from the
various spacefaring nations. But individuals of many species and even
more races brush shoulders constantly in the myriads of shops, taverns
and hotels here. Due to the effects of the ball even the most hateful
enemies tend to behave themselves here, there's even a Beholderish
Racial Issues Committee based here that vainly tries to forge peace
between the warring clans. Pale elves (supposedly drow) and
mindflayers tend to avoid the place due to the merciless sunlight, but
they are indeed occasional visitors here.

-*- Not really suited to specific scenarios, just a Spelljammer
variety of the Floating Vagabond or something. Perhaps the PCs could
complete a serious night of carousing by going joyriding on the lizard
chief's ship.

-*- A criminal with a Brooch of Mind Protection comes over and begins
a one-man terror campaign against all inhabitants. The PCs face him at
the immense powder vaults, facing a combat against sparks and the
Ball's suggestions to "put down yer weapons and head down to Mike's
Meadland".

-*- After the PC's foil the criminal's attempts, the gnome chief asks
the group to lead 'the hugest ship convoy of all time'. In order to
double FF's size, the PCs shall buy tens of ships and helms and lead
the fleet here. As a reward they get a 'ship of their own choice', as
payment they carry well over three million gold coins to Refuge. Can
the PCs keep the cash from thieves, or do they succumb to their own
greed.

<Yes, incidentally, I _was_ listening to Black Sabbath (Planet
Caravan) and Deep Purple (Space Truckin') when I wrote this one.>








                          NEW MONSTERS

    The following monsters are intended for use in a Spelljammer
campaign, but they can also be used in standard "dirtside" campaigns,
with a little creativity.


ARATHAX              [  SPELLJAMMER  ]

Climate/Terrain:     Wildspace (asteroids, ring systems)
Frequency:           Very Rare
Organization:        Pack
Activity Cycle:      Not applicable
Diet:                Herbivore
Intelligence:        Low to Average
Treasure:            Nil
Alignment:           Chaotic Good

No. Appearing:       2-8
Armor Class:         4
Movement:            18", 48" fly (MC B)
Hit Dice:            4 + 2
THAC0:               15
No. of Attacks:      3
Damage/Attack:       1-10/1-10/1-6
Special Attacks:     Nil
Special Defenses:    Nil
Magic Resistance:    Standard
Size:                L (6' a shoulder, 16' wingspread)
Morale:              Average - High
XP Value:            450

Appearance:  The Arathax is a winged, reptilian creature about the
size of a small horse.  In fact, the head and body of the Arithax are
almost identical to that of a draft horse.  The wings and tail of the
creature are more like those of a bird than a reptile, having long
coarse feathers.  Arithax usually have and plain, metallic grey color,
while the wing and tail feathers boast a wide variety of colors which
vary with each individual.

Combat:  The Arathax fights with its forelegs and teeth.  When forced
to fight, they will do so in large numbers.  After the second round of
combat, there is a 10% chance per round, cumulative, that 1-6
additional arathax will come to help fend off attackers.  They will
generally avoid ships.

Habitat/Society:  The arathax are native to the asteroid clusters of
wildspace, and they have been encountered in many spheres.  In some
spheres, arathax have taken to living in the mountains of earth worlds
and in air worlds where floating islands are available, but these
cases are so rare that they do not warrant further discussion.
Sometimes a spacefaring human or elf will take an arathax as a mount.
The agreement will be a mutual partnership, however, as an arathax
will never act as a simple beast of burden.

Ecology: Arathax are similar to pegasi in their behavior.  They travel
within asteroid clusters feeding off the various lichens that grow
there.  The packs are nomadic, and travel wherever there is food.  In
general, they try not to bother humans and other space travellers.
The Rock of Bral would be a perfect place to find arathax, but the
creatures do not attempt to eat the vegetation on the Rock.  They do,
however, feed on the nearby ones.  An arathax has tight breath
control, and it can last four times as long as most creatures on its
own air envelope. They have excellent senses, and they always seem to
know if a given asteroid will have edible food and/or breathable air.



HOLOMATH           [ SPELLJAMMER ]

Climate/Terrain:   Wildspace, Air worlds
Frequency:         Varies
Organization:      Pod
Activity Cycle:    Variable
Diet:              Special
Intelligence:      Non-
Treasure:          Nil
Alignment:         Neutral

No. Appearing:     3-18
Armor Class:       8
Movement:          Fly 12" (MC E)
Hit Dice:          12
THAC0:             N/A
No. of Attacks:    Nil (see below)
Damage/Attack:     Nil (see below)
Special Attacks:   Cloudkill
Special Defenses:  Nil
Magic Resistance:  Standard
Size:              H (18' diameter)
Morale:            N/A
XP Value:          2500

Appearance: A holomath appears as a very large balloon or ball, with a
mouth-like opening in front.  They tend to be off-white in color, and
have very few distinguishing features.

Combat:  The holomath will never act on a foe until it is attacked.
When this happens, it will blow gas at the attacker, which functions
like a "cloudkill" spell.  The victim is allowed a saving throw, at -
2.  Failure results in nausea (as opposed to death) that lasts 3-18
rounds, during which time the character is unable to do anything other
than choke and wheeze.  Note that this will also drop the atmosphere
one place in quality (fresh to fouled, fouled to deadly).  A holomath
will also do this if a ship merrily bumps into it, so captains of all
races avoid them.

Habitat/Society: Holomath travel in groups, often around air worlds,
but they can be found anywhere in wildspace.  Phlogisin is deadly to
them, and they are never found there.

Ecology: The holomath feed on the trace gases that can be found in
wildspace and around air worlds.  They use their "mouth" to inhale the
gases, where they remain until the creature digests it.  By this time,
the holomath has shrunk to about two-thirds of its full size, and will
starve within two to eight days if no more food is available.  Hence
they remain within close proximity to an air world, and will drop into
the upper atmosphere if necessary.


ORBMAX             [  SPELLJAMMER  ]

Climate/Terrain:   Any
Frequency:         Very rare
Organization:      Small group
Activity Cycle:    Varies
Diet:              Omnivore
Intelligence:      High
Treasure:          Nil
Alignment:         Any

No. Appearing:     1-4
Armor Class:       3
Movement:          18" (MC A)
Hit Dice:          4
THAC0:             16
No. of Attacks:    1
Damage/Attack:     2-16
Special Attacks:   nil
Special Defenses:  nil
Magic Resistance:  35%
Size:              S (2' diameter')
Morale:            Champion
XP Value:          350

Appearance:  The orbmax is a mutant species of beholder, and looks
like a small version of the parent race.  Only four eye stalks are
present on an orbmax.  They can take on the appearance of any beholder
sub-species, but the orbmax do not have the hatred of one another that
the parent species has.  They float via levitation, like other
beholders.

Combat:  Orbmax prefer not to fight, but when they do they bite with
their large mouths.  Unlike most beholders, orbmax do not have any
magical powers in their eye stalks (except for levitation) in their
central eye.  However, the presence of five eyes ensures that they are
never surprised, and gives them infravision and ultravision of up to
60 feet.

Habitat/Society: The orbmax were developed as slaves for the
beholders. Those that fail to please their masters are eaten, so they
often look for ways to escape (beholders are strict masters).  Those
orbmax that have escaped and are now free, they still have a
compulsive need to serve a master, or to work as an employee for
someone else.  They were designed for that purpose, and simply do not
know any other way to live.  Once they escape their masters, they try
to find someone a little more lenient to work for.  In light of this,
they prefer to serve humans, demi-humans, and other friendly races.
Neogi are worse that beholders, and illithids like to eat their
brains.  They frequently act as servants for wealthy people, often as
a floating butler, maid, cook, or other skilled servant.  They can be
taught skills like any other character, and they can adapt quickly to
new challenges.  Some have signed on as crew members of ships, often
handling light tasks such as maintenance, cooking, or
clerical/administrative tasks.  One orbmax works for a Bral merchant
as an accountant, for instance.

Ecology:  Orbmax are omnivorous, and can in fact eat almost anything.
They can levitate up to thirty pounds of material at a time, and can
perform a variety of tasks simultaneously.  Orbmax that are
encountered by characters are either lone travellers without a master
to serve, or are serving a master of some sort.  Orbmax that are still
in the service of beholders are rarely brought on tyrant ships, but
can be found in beholder outposts.

Morale:           High
XP Value:         30

Preface: This creature originally appeared in the original Fiend
Folio, and to my knowledge it has not appeared anywhere else. I pulled
this together by special request, and I have since adapted it for
Spelljammer.

Appearance: The Tabaxi, or cat-men, are man-sized, feline humanoids.
They are quite lithe and move with the smooth-easy grace of cats.
They have human like faces and build, but with pointed cat-like ears,
and a tail.  They are covered with a coat of fur, whose thickness and
pattern varies from one group to another, but is usually tawny and
stripped with black, like that of a tiger.  They rarely wear clothing.

Their eyes are usually green or yellow, and are slit-pupilled.  They
have retractable claws.

Combat:  Tabaxi are very adept at using human weapons, and can learn
how to use them is a surprisingly short period of time.  They tend to
avoid complex weapons like crossbows, but will easily use bolas,
atlatls, and even blades if they are not overly heavy.  Typically, if
a weapon has no value as a tool or hunting weapon (ex: a two-handed
sword is strictly designed for killing humanoids) they avoid it.  If
armed with a weapon, a Tabaxi will use it as any human or demi-human
would.  If unarmed, they will fight with their fore claws (1-3 points
each) and their bite (1-3).  If the Tabaxi is pinned on its back it
will be unable to bite, but may be able to use one of its rear claws
for 1-4 points of damage.   In hunting, they usually take their prey
through quick surprise and ambush.  Two individuals will try to chase
prey into the claws of another. Like house cats, they may "play" with
injured prey before killing it.   They have a natural camouflage which
allows them to "Hide in Shadows" at 60%, and they can "Move Silently"
at 55%.  Finally, they are very good at seeing a trap for what it is,
so there is only a 10% chance of trapping a Tabaxi.

Habitat/Society:  Tabaxi live in isolated areas of forests and
jungles, keeping away from humans and other humanoids.  A pride
consists of two to eight adults (one to four males, and one to four
females), and perhaps one to three young.  Young have only one hit
die, and will typically avoid combat unless cornered.  Individual
prides usually do not associate with other prides, but rarely do they
fight one another.  Lairs can be in hollow trees, isolated thickets,
caves, or whatever is useful to them.  They hide their lairs and
themselves with scents and aromatic herbs.  They are tool users when
they find it useful or convenient.  Their tools are usually wooden or
bone, and are never complex.

Ecology:  Tabaxi are extraordinary hunters, and prefer a diet of meat,
especially small mammals and fish, which they usually eat raw.
However, in times of famine they will eat edible plants and nuts.
They will only deal with other races when it is convenient for them,
and they NEVER trade with others.  Such actions are considered
demeaning.  They have their own language, and some individuals can
speak common, and other regularly encountered languages such as Elven
or Dwarven, depending on who the neighbors are.

Variants:  The coat of a Tabaxi can vary tremendously, just like those
of house cats.  In colder temperate forests, their coat tends to be
quite thick, like that or a persian or himalayan cat.  This strain of
tabaxi is very rare, and tends to travel in larger prides of four to
twelve.  These prides often have a leader, often the strongest female.

History:  The Tabaxi are native to a distant, earth-like world.  The
world is currently occupied by an imperialistic inter-stellar empire
(you GM's can decide which one) that is attempting to subjugate it.
The native tabaxi are putting up quite a fight, and the invaders are
constantly on the alert for tabaxi raids.  Terrorism is even practiced
by some of the more fanatical strains.  Some tabaxi have been captured
and taken off-planet.  At one time the invaders captured entire groups
of them and sent them elsewhere, in hopes of breaking the resistance.
This has resulted in tabaxi colonies appearing all over the known
spheres.  Space faring Tabaxi (jokingly called "Space Cats" behind
their backs) are more civilized than their homeworld bretherin, and
freely mingle with the other space faring races.  They frequently sign
on with ships of human design, but are not known to have any ships of
their own.  They tend to dress in tunics and knee-high boots.

================================================================
Belieth the Benign
Race:          Half-Elven Female
Class:         Fighter/Mage, 8th/9th level
THAC0:         13
Armor Class:   4 (chainmail vest)
Age:           49
Height/Weight: 5'1" / 96 lbs
Homeland:      Muldravian Empire, Chorrad'ek, Cartania, Solaris
Alignment:     Chaotic Good
Str 17; Dex 15; Con 18; Int 18; Wis 16; Cha 15+; Cml 15

     Belieth the Benign (family name Dariman) is a typical half-elf
with shoulder-length dirty blonde hair, violet eyes, and a love-
goddess figure.  She is the illegitimate daughter of a landowner and
an elven merchant.  Her human mother was an alcoholic and abused her
frequently.  As a result, she doesn't like to talk about her
childhood.  She was ultimately raised by an uncle who taught her the
ways of magic, and otherwise prevented her from becoming a delinquent.
When her uncle died and his business closed, she signed on to an ocean
ship and effectively ran away.  She sailed around for a while,
eventually falling into the Silver Osprey Company, a group of good-
aligned, free-wheeling adventurers.  She has been with them ever
since.
     She can be found with any member of the Silver Osprey party
(usually her husband, Hall-ee-mor Dargess), often posing as a consort,
but really acting as a sword hand.  She has a biting sense of humor,
and is a natural for practical jokes.  These jokes are always
harmless, but hilarious.  Her jokes often mix well with Hall's
stories, so the two of them are great company at a gathering.
Belieth's cynical optimism (an oxymoron, but that's the best way to
describe it!) can raise the morale of the most distraught individual,
almost as well as any bard.
     In the spelljammer universe, she simply enjoys seeing new things
and meeting new people, so she can often be seen sight-seeing, or
milling around a tavern.  Her childhood was one of constraints, and
she is still enjoying the freedom to travel about.  Despite her past,
she is not haunted by it, though many still consider her a wildcat.
When combat starts she may revert to her old mind-set (fighting hard
and not at all fair).  She will generally use a crossbow before a
magic spell, and most of her spells are combat oriented.
     When she is at home on Cartania, she is co-manager of a busy
tavern in Maplegrove, that she and her husband own.  She relentlessly
teases Hall at every opportunity, but this does not hide the fact that
she loves him fiercely.

Dargess, Hall-ee-mor, the "Bard of Wildpace"
Race:          Half-elven Male
Class:         bard, 12th level
THAC0:         15
Armor Class:   7
Age:           50
Height/Weight: 5'8" / 132 lbs
Homeland:      Olvenholt, Chorrad'ek, Cartania, Solaris
Alignment:     Neutral Good
Str 18.90; Dex 18; Con 16; Int 14; Wis 18; Cha 16; Cml 15

     Hall was born in a run-down city in the Worldspine mountains of
Cartania, to a poor, but stable family.  By the time he was 22,
however, his mother had died in childbirth (to his younger brother),
and his father was murdered in his shop.  Hall and his younger brother
fled the city and enlisted in the Muldravian army.  Eventually they
were split up by assignments.  Hall's brother was reportedly killed on
some nameless battlefield, in a forgotten skirmish with some raiders.
     Hall left the army after ten years, looking for something new.
He worked as a scribe for a while, but found that too dull.  His
acquired skills caused him to eventually become a bard, especially
given his knack to synthesize different versions of tales into a
consistent, cohesive whole.  He became a founding member of the Silver
Osprey party, and now owns a tavern named in the party's honor.
     When the party re-formed and took up spelljamming, Hall jumped at
the chance.  He has a vivid memory, and he loves collecting tales from
all over.  His personal library of songs and tales is an envy to most
bards.  It can be argued that his knowledge of folklore is reaching
sage proportions, because his travels on different worlds has given
him knowledge of literally hundreds of events, people, and places.
When travelling, he is often carrying a small notebook, sketching
notes and listening to stories, to be used as material later on.
Sometimes, he whips out his mandolin and does an im-promptu
performance.  His performances are always a marvel to watch and hear.
     He is married to Belieth the Benign, and the two are never far
apart.  In fact, he can't imagine life without her.  Her teasing is
sometimes a cause for embarrassment, but he doesn't mind.

Droitian, Bagath
Race:          Human Male
Class:         Cosmitist Druid, 12th level
THAC0:         14
Armor Class:   -7
Age:           31
Height/Weight: 5'8" / 151 lbs
Homeland:      Waterdeep, Toril
Alignment:     Neutral Good (see below)
Str 11; Dex 11; Con 14; Int 11; Wis 18; Cha 15; Cml 15

     Bagath Droitan is a stocky man with a thin beard and moustache,
and with close-cropped, thick black hair.  He always wears the dark
grey robes of a Cosmitist Druid, which give him a mysterious air.  He
is a founding member of the Silver Osprey party, but he is not a
native of Cartania.  He hails from Toril, from a village near
Waterdeep.  His parents were Cartanian, however, and were Druids of
the same Cosmotist faith.  When Bagath was about eight, they embarked
on a pilgrimage to their home land.  Sadly, the ship was attacked by
neogi shortly after entering the Solaris sphere, and his parents were
killed before a patrol ship drove the neogi off.  He was taken to
Beacon, where some other druids raised and cared for him.  When he was
sixteen, he vowed to take his parent's ashes "home," and travelled
with some other druids to Cartania.  Once there, and with his personal
quest fulfilled, he remained on Cartania and took up a life of a free
adventurer.
     When he joined the Silver Osprey party, he never divulged his
true origin, keeping it a secret.  He was uncomfortable about leading
people into the stars, a realm he knew to be all too dangerous.  The
party always knew he was different, because he would stare at the
night sky for hours.  It wasn't until Tiegorus joined the party that
he felt the urge to explain his true origin, if only to her.  When the
group took to space, he told them all about his origins.  At first
they were hurt by his prolonged silence, but they quickly understood
his reasons.
     The Cosmotist faith is more of a philosophy (like the Path of the
Way) than a religion.  They believe that everyone is made from a
mixture of cosmic energy, and is placed in the universe to improve it
somehow.  At death, the energy reverts to the cosmos, and is
eventually re-mixed to form another being.  As such, they believe that
if you can't improve something, that you should leave it as it is.  It
also places great emphasis on stewardship in nature.  Hence, Cosmotist
priests are treated as druids for spells and point advancement, but
they can be of any good alignment and there is not a restricted number
at the upper levels.
     Bagath has a deep hatred for undead (especially liches), because
he considers them a travesty of the universal order: their energy
should be sent back to the cosmos where it belongs.  He is married to
Tiegorus of Maplegrove, and often acts as her conscience.

Ferrengal, Deliliah: Commodore MSN, CO "Plight of Andromeda"
Race:          Human Female
Class:         Fighter, 15th level
THAC0:         5
Armor Class:   -2 (plate +3, shield, ring of protection +1)
Age:           47
Height/Weight: 5'11" / 145 lbs
Homeland:      Muldravian Empire, Chorrad'ek, Cartania, Solaris
Alignment:     Neutral Good
Str 18.36; Dex 17+; Con 14; Int 15; Wis 13; Cha 16+; Cml 14

     Commodore Ferrengal is a rather tall woman in her mid-forties,
with a full head of red hair (usually tied into a braid or bun).  She
is a very well-respected officer, and the High Command has considered
promoting her to Rear Admiral.  Many doubt she would accept the
promotion, however.  Ferrengal started out in the surface navy at age
sixteen.  After one tour, she vanished for three years, and joined the
MSN at 23. She has never disclosed where she was during those three
years, and people have given up asking.
     Her current command is a Marlin, the "Plight of Andromeda."  This
ship contains a full complement of crack deck crew, a highly trained
marine force (for boarding actions), and several priests and mages.
One point of interest is that Ferrangal's ship is entirely crewed by
women.  Ferrangal claims that mixed-gender crews are a distraction for
all on board, which in turn causes a break-down of military
discipline.  This practice has fostered some very nasty rumors about
Ferrangal's personal life.  At any rate, many of the Muldravian
commanders agree with this "single gender" philosophy and practice it
themselves.  The practice is an issue of great controversy.
     The "Plight of Andromeda" has become one of the most feared ships
in the Solaris sphere.  Ferrengal is efficient to the point of being
ruthless, and this shows in the performance of her crew.  If you
decide to pick a fight with her, reconsider while you still can.
     Ferrengal has commanded the "Plight" for eight years, and during
that time she has proven herself one of the best tacticians in the
MSN.  Her most recent achievement was a one-on-one battle with an
Illithid Deadnaught, the "Bringer of Nightmares."  Ferrengal and the
Illithid commander engaged in a lengthy battle of wits.  The two ships
chaced and darted about the Cumara nebula in Solaris space for almost
two months, neither one being able to catch the other.  The Illithid
commander made a subtle mistake in trying to break the stalemate,
however.  His Dreadnaught was cloaked in an illusion to look like part
of the nebula, but since the ship was opaque, the stars on the far
side of the nebula could not be seen through the "cloud."  Ferrengal
swerved her ship at the Dreadnaught, and the two ships played out a
fight that lasted over four hours.  In the end, the Dreadnaught was
pierced twice and most of the Illithids on board were killed, while
the "Plight" suffered surprisingly low casualties.  Five Illithids
were taken prisoner, as were ten human mercenaries.  About fifteen
slaves were freed.
     Recently, Ferrengal has been accepting missions outside the
Solaris sphere, mostly of the search-and-pursue type.  The Muldravian
Empire has been sending ships into other spheres to spy on the United
Illithid Fleet.  Recently, the "Plight" and its sister ship, "The
Arrow of Rigel," have been seen in Realmspace, investigating rumors of
Illithid bases in the Tears of Selune.

Mind Sifter, Grand Admiral, United Illithid Fleet
Race:          Illithid
THAC0:         14
Armor Class:   2 (ring of protection +3)
Age:           56 (assumed)
Height/Weight: 6'0", 140 lbs
Homeland:      Oerth (assumed)
Alignment:     Lawful Evil
Str 12; Dex 11; Con 18; Int 19; Wis 19; Cha 12 (18 for Illithids); Cml
9
Special: Mind blast, suggestion, charm person/monster, hypnosis, ESP,
levitate, astral projection, plane shift.

    Even among his own kind, "Mind Sifter" (his mental label
translated into Common) is considered to be the most arrogant,
conceited, meglo-manic, and dangerous Illithid alive.  His Illithid
name is impossible for non-Illithids to even attempt, so only his use
name is presented here.   Mind Sifter has worked the space lanes for
over twenty years, and shows no signs of slowing down.  When the
Illithid nations decided to form a united fleet, Mind Sifter
immediately volunteered to act as the chief admiral.  Several other
volunteered as well, but all of them vanished within a few days of
announcing their intentions.  Mind Sifter has built up a personality
cult of sorts, such that he always has at least seven Illithids
bodyguards with him, all of them ready to die for him.  Furthermore,
several Illithids have been trained to imitate him both mentally and
physically, so as to mislead assassins.
     Mind Sifter listens to no one except the directors of the
Illithid fleet, and then only when it suits him.  In Greyspace, his
greatest area of activity, the elves have clashed with him on a number
of occasions.  A truce is always drawn, but Mind Sifter breaks it as
soon as it is convenient to do so.  It has gotten to the point where
the elves are considering an all-out strike on the fleet.  The trouble
is, they can't find out where the base is.  Mind Sifter himself never
stays with one ship, so it is impossible to know where he is at any
one time.
     Fortunately, the Illithid fleet is currently more interested in
securing trade routes and protecting the mutual well-being of the
member states.  Mind Sifter claims that this is his primary concern as
admiral, and that he is only doing what is necessary.  In truth, he
sees the Illithid fleet is his means to conquering worlds or even
entire spheres.  Some of the Illithid nations are prepared to support
him in this endeavor!       His meglo-mania aside, he is a competent
admiral.  His performance during the Vodani War proved that.  He never
takes unnecessary risks, and always has five or six back-up plans for
any action he undertakes.  His uncanny ability to plan and anticipate
multiple outcomes, and always come out on top regardless, is the
reason why he has survived in such a high position.  He is perhaps the
most dangerous Illithid alive.

Raleigh, Garadin
Race:          Human Male
Class:         Rogue/Swashbuckler, 10th
THAC0:         16
Armor Class:   3 (leather armor +4)
Age:           36
Height/Weight: 6'0" / 155 lbs
Homeland:      Unknown
Alignment:     Chaotic Good/Neutral
Str: 13; Dex 17; Con 12; Int 17; Wis 14; Cha 16; Cml 18

    Garadin Raleigh is the archetypical dashing scoundrel.  Examples
of this type of character include: Captain Okona (from Star Trek: The
Next Generation, "The Outrageous Okona"), Han Solo, and Lando
Calrissian (from the Star Wars cycle).  His ship is a modified
Tradesman called "The Elusive Damsel," and it has been magically
altered so that he can operate the ship at full efficiency alone, AND
he has equipped it with spells and devices that lower the armor rating
and increase the maneuverability.  He frequently takes on a few hired
hands to operate the balista, however, just in case.  He never hires
crewmen for more than one voyage at a time.  That way, people can get
out any time they want, and he can dismiss someone when he wants.  He
doesn't like owing people anything, and he doesn't want people to owe
him either.
     His history is very sketchy, and he tries very hard to keep it
that way.  What is known is that he has been in space for most of his
life, and has visited at least fifty different worlds in seventeen
crystal spheres.  He has a good head for business, and his efficiency
as a cargo carrier is never questioned.  He has a contact in every
sphere he has visited, and can always find work through them.
Sometimes he needs their help to hide as well.
     He is better known for his flamboyant style and prowess with
women.  He always buys the best food, stays at the best inns, and
visits the best places wherever he goes.  He believes in living life
to the limit of human endurance, because he is convinced that every
trip he makes will be his last.  He is almost always in the company of
a woman, and he sometimes claims to be going for some kind of record.
Any female character can expect to be approached by him, especially if
they have a high charisma, and are members of the human, half-elf, or
elven races.  Most intelligent women see him for what he is right out,
but still think he is a lot of fun.  An evening with Garadin Raleigh
is never dull.
     Sometimes he gets caught up in things that he takes personally.
He hates neogi, for instance, and will go to great lengths to mess up
one of their schemes.  He never fights them directly.  He considers
sabotage and tampering more effective.  He is very adept at getting to
places that other people can't, and some diplomats have even booked
passage on his ship.
     The Rock of Bral is one of his favorite places, and he can often
be found there, "between jobs."  He is never unemployed for long; his
services are always in demand.  When his silver and brass Tradesman
docks at Bral, many freight handlers are happy to see him, as are many
of the single women of Bral.
     The Elusive Damsel can be considered a tradesman in terms of
physical layout, but the hull has been given a layer of thin, magical
wood, and metal plating, that collectively raise the armor rating one
place.  Also, he has a device similar to an elven "Rudder of
Maneuverability" that raises the maneuverability class from D to B.
The entire ship is gilded with silver, brass, and copper highlights,
and screams of money.  Raleigh is paid very well for his work.

Resika, Malath. Commanding Officer, IEN Wanderer
Race:          Elven Male
Class:         Fighter/Mage (12th, 10th)
THAC0:         10
Armor Class:   0 (+2 plate)
Age:           486
Height/Weight: 5'5" / 118 lbs
Homeland:      Evermeet, Toril
Alignment:     Neutral Good
Str 16; Dex 14; Con 12; Int 17; Wis 13; Cha 15; Cml 13

     Rear Admiral Resika is the archetypical explorer.  Throughout his
entire career in the Imperial Navy (over a century) he has been fond
of exploring new areas, and seeing new things.  When the admiralty of
Evermeet offered him the "Wanderer," he jumped at the chance.
Currently, the Wanderer is assigned to travel the spheres looking for
lost elven colonies.  Resika has indeed found many lost colonies, but
he has also initiated peaceful contact with several planet-bound races
on a variety of worlds.  He isn't exactly like Jean-Luc Picard from
Star Trek: The Next Generation, but he is close.
     Resika is surprisingly friendly for an elf of his rank.  When a
strange ship appears, he tries to talk peacefully with them. He has a
modified flitter that he sometimes takes to visit other ships, or land
on worlds, to initiate peaceful relations.  He never, under any
circumstances endangers his ship.  The welfare of the Wanderer is as
important to him as his mission, and he would rather die than let his
mission be recalled on account of a damaged ship.  Rumor has it that
the Wanderer has been modified to match his personal specifications,
which are far above the standards demanded by the Imperial Navy.
    Resika is one of the good guys, without a doubt.  He tries to look
at everyone with an open mind, and he always tries to find a peaceful
solution.  When options are low, he tries to uncover more options!
Despite his military calling, he dislikes war.  Anyone who
encounterers Resika will find him a great conversation, and actually
very friendly (in an aloof, elven way).

     Seko is a frail, elderly, Oriental man who once worked on a Shou
Lung dragonship that had the misfortune of crashing on Cartania.  He
survived the crash, but his body was permanently damaged.  He can
still move around normally, but his physical skill are gone.  He was
considered one of the best navigators in the Shou Lung fleet, and his
skill as a navigator is never questioned.  He currently works for the
Silver Osprey party, and they never question his advice.
     He is a wealth of knowledge for all aspects of spelljamming, and
he has been compiling a library of the worlds and spheres he has
visited.  He has accelerated his work on this collection of books,
because he fears that his life will end soon, and he does not want his
life's work to go unfinished.
     Seko is an enigma.  He rarely speaks, but when he does he can
give a book's worth of advice and almost any aspect of life.  What's
more, the advice is meaningful.  After spending many years of his life
on Cartania, he is glad to be in space again.  However, he has passed
up numerous opportunities to return to Shou Lung.  He has found planet
life to constrained, and fears that if her returned to Shou Lung, the
emperor will make him remain as an advisor to his admirals.  He wants
a simple life, and he wants it in space.

Special:       Immune to 1st and 2nd level Illusion/Phantasms

History: Cherrylyn Serianna Tiegorus, or Cherry was born on April 16,
1182 (Cartanian Calendar).  Her father was human, her mother half-elf.
She is proportionally small, like an elf, with reddish-brown hair and
blue-green eyes. She was a triplet, but only one of her sisters is
still alive.
     At the age of ten, after showing a natural talent for magic, she
was sent into an apprenticeship with a group of reclusive magicians.
She completed her studies at eighteen, and promptly took up a very
flamboyant adventuring career, filled with dilettante style living,
whirlwind romances, and lots of parties with her adventuring
companions.
     This first phase of her life ended abruptly when a war broke out
in her homeland, and of her family only an uncle and one identical
sister survived.  She left her party and spent several years trying,
unsuccessfully, to find them. She has never truly given up on this
quest.
     The years of frustration in trying to find her uncle and sister
made her very distraught, and she underwent a type of "mid-life
crisis." She wandered about Cartania, trying to find a place to settle
and become a "real wizard."  She never stayed long in one place,
however, claiming that the place wasn't right somehow.  In truth, she
didn't know what she wanted, knew it, and was very close to hating
herself.  She was near suicide at one point, and only the intervention
of an old friend (a member of her original party) stopped her.  Her
friend, by this time wealthy and established, took her in at that
point, and she started to put her life back together.
     Her life changed radically with the discovery of an old tome
describing and order of wizards called the Nimar.  She had heard of
this order, credited with protecting Cartania in ages past, only to be
banished at the end of the Magic Wars (a period of wanton magical
hell).  This book described what the Nimar actually were like.  Much
of the knowledge they used had been lost after the Magic Wars, and she
decided to find it.  She encountered a group of characters of similar
power (the Silver Osprey Party), and joined with them.  Since she had
a purpose in life again, she began to "loosen up" and become more like
her old jovial self.
     Her life changed again when the Silver Osprey Party encountered
the most powerful foe they ever encountered: Drogatha the Everdragon
(Natives of Greyhawk know of him).  Drogatha defeated the party hands-
down, and the survivors (about half) had to grant Drogatha some
concessions.  Cherry has given a curse/quest: compile a spell library
of 1000 spells before the end of her natural life.  At that time,
Drogatha would come and collect them.  If she failed to complete the
task, or trick him in any way, he would turn her into a lich, and she
would forever be his consort.  The Osprey Party partially disbanded at
that point, with many of the characters feeling that their luck had
finally run out.
     As for Cherry, she has tried desperately to find a loophole in
Drogatha's terms, because they spell a fate truly worse than death.
So far, she has found only two routes out of it: she can use power
from the Negative Material Plane to destroy her own soul, leaving
Drogatha with nothing to transform (and destroying her own essence in
the process); OR, she can become an Arch-Lich (a very rare, Good
aligned Lich) under her own power before Drogatha can come to make
good on his promise.  Neither option is appealing, but they exist.
     As a result of this curse, she sometimes retreats into a silent
melancholy, as she considers her own future, and the possible fate of
Cartania, or any other world for that matter, if Drogatha had a
library as large as 1000 spells.  However, it does not dominate her
life.
     She still enjoys what life has to offer, especially good friends
and natural beauty.  She is now married to Bagath Droitan, a Cosmotist
Priest (something like a Druid with Neutral Good alignment), and a
former adventuring companion.  She is still searching for knowledge
about the Nimar, and her studies have taken her all over Cartania.
     In fact, her quest has taken her outside Cartania.  She now knows
that the Nimar were not restricted to Cartania, though that was their
greatest concentration.  She has taken up spelljamming, and was
instrumental in re-uniting the Silver Osprey party as a spelljammer
group.  She had a modified Damselfly Ship, called the Oridia, but it
recently became the victim of an unfortunate accident...  Now, she and
her companions book passage on other ships to travel.  She is
currently set on purchasing a new ship.
     Most of the time, she and her companions are "dirtside," looking
for knowledge about magic and/or just seeing what there is to see.
Because of this, she can be encountered in any standard game world.
Because of her travels, she has access to spells from all over the
known spheres.  Any spell from virtually any world could appear in her
library, so one should hesitate before challenging her in combat,
since her magical skills are an unknown quantity.
     She has a pseudo-dragon familiar, Nigerio, who has been with
Cherry for most of her career.  He is a personable creature, enjoying
philosophical writings, exotic food, and stimulating conversation.  He
has proven an invaluable assistant to Cherry on numerous occasions.
     Cherry has the following magical items: A Robe of Eyes, a Ring of
Wizardry (2nd level spells), and her personal Staff.  Her staff is a
by-product of her accumulated research.  It is made of rare wood, is
about 4'6" long, and with a star-shaped tip holding a gem that
continuously changes color.  Cherry is NEVER without this staff.  It
is similar to a magi staff, and can perform the following:

Powers that drain no charges:
     Read Magic, Detect Magic, Light, Feather Fall, Shield*
Powers that drain one charge:
     Invisibility, Web, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, ESP, Tongues,
     Magic Missile, Levitate, Dispel Magic, Ray of Enfeeblement,
     Suggestion.
Powers that drain two charges:
     Telekinesis, Cone of Cold, Wall of Fire, Conjure Elemental,
     Wizard Eye, Teleport, Passwall.
Arcane powers: Absorb spells to recharge, Store ten levels of
     spells (as a Ring of Spell Storing), Astral Projection
     (drains five charges, lose 1-6 strength points upon return.
     Strength returns at a rate of 1 point/hour).

If the staff is ever broken it will perform a retributive strike, as a
Magi Staff.  Normally, it performs all spell functions at two levels
below Cherry (10th at present), and it can strike creatures hit only
by magical weapons.  However, it has no "to hit" bonus and is
considered a normal weapon in calculating damage. Finally, though the
"Shield" function drains no charges, it can only be used as many times
in a twenty-four hour period as there are charges in the staff.  Like
most staves, this one can hold 25 charges before becoming "full."
Overloading it will result in a retributive strike.
     For the record, the construction of this staff took a LONG TIME:
about two years to construct the formula, another year to gather the
ingredients, and eight months for actual construction.








                          LEGENDS AND LORE

    Here are some legends and stories to enhance the flavor of a
Spelljammer campaign.  It is up to you to decide weather or not they
are true!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The currents of the Phlogistin, by Terrigimar.
   (Those of you who have read "Skull and Crossbows" know of
Terrigimar, the space faring lich.  Terrigimar conducts research on
the Phlogistin from his modified Dragonfly ship.  His vessel was last
seen in the flow near Realmspace).

   There is reason to believe that the crystal spheres move about in
the flow, like corks floating in a tub of water.  After consulting
with historical maps and other records, I do not believe this to be
the case.  Instead, I believe that the crystal spheres are stationary,
at least in relation to one another, and that the currents of the flow
are what change.
   For as long as historical records have been kept, there have been
currents connecting the three spheres of Realmspace, Greyspace, and
Krynspace.  At present, transport between Greyspace and Krynnspace is
very difficult, but several centuries ago (at about the time of
Krynn's Cataclysm) Greyspace and Krynspace shared a strong two-way
current.  Now, such a current exists between Realmspace and Greyspace.
   According to conventional wisdom, Greyspace "moved" to a different
location, and the two-way current moved with it. However, if this were
the case, the three-way connection between the three spheres would
have been lost.  If, on the other hand, the flow current moved for
some reason, but the spheres remained stationary, the three-way
arrangement would have changes, but would still exist.
   My research has concluded that the spheres themselves rotate on an
internal axis, and that this rotation is very rapid.  People inside
the sphere are unaware of this, because they are all moving together
with the sphere's gravity well.  Upon entering the flow and breaking
free of a sphere's gravity well, one on the ship may notice their
portal moving away at an alarming rate.  Simply put, the surface of a
crystal sphere is always moving.  This is why portal searches are
required to enter a sphere.
   All of the spheres rotating create turbulence and eddies in the
flow, which allow the currents to exist. The current between Greyspace
and Krynspace was lost shortly after the Cataclysm.  I believe that
this sudden change in Krynspace caused the sphere to rotate in a
different direction, which destroyed the current.  These changes in
currents also allowed a new current to develop between Greyspace and
Realmspace.  To travellers, however, this movement is impossible to
track.  All they notice are slight changes in landmarks.  In the past,
these changes were attributed to the movement of the crystal spheres.
In truth, it is because the currents of the flow are always changing.
As a result, each trip through the flow is unique; the same exact
route is never used twice.
   I intend to continue my research on this theory, and with the
centuries of undead life before me, I expect to gather large amounts
of data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Incident of Farbay: Cartania, 865 standard years past.

     This account adds yet another contradiction to the legend of the
great ship "Spelljammer."  The most disturbing aspect of the tale is
that it ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  Some elves were eye witnesses, and some of
them still live.  The following account is from the memoirs of a human
historian who lived in Farbay at the time:

    "The reign of Dark Magic was at last coming to an end, and the
cursed Nimar were assumed soon to be gone, but before they left they
brought one more moment of fear to the people of the Land.
     The last of the Nimar, twelve of them to be exact, came to Farbay
in a majestic Sky Galleon.  Upon their arrival, the good people of the
city descended on the ship and destroyed it, but the Nimar, who
escaped the destruction, exhibited no concern.  It was as if the loss
of the sky ship meant nothing to them.  They went to one of the small
islands in the bay and created an enormous fire of green flame.  The
flame formed a pillar, that rose to the height of a small mountain.
The people of Farbay were terrified, and many wanted to travel to the
island and destroy the Nimar at once.  But, since the flame posed no
immediate danger to the city, and since most of the people were
frightened beyond words, they were left alone.  The flame ended most
mysteriously.  Instead of dying like a normal fire, it formed a long
shaft and flew into the clouds like a spear.  It was as if the Nimar
had been searching for a great game bird, and released an arrow once
they had found it.
      The flame must have contained a magic too terrible for a simple
one like myself to understand.  After one phase of the red moon
[Irania, the second moon of Cartania], the summons was answered.  It
was no game bird that answered the Nimar's summons, but a huge flying
manta ray, with a long tail like a scorpion, and a small city mounted
on its back!  It blotted the sky at dawn, and glided above the surface
of the ocean without effort, finally coming to rest in the bay,
resting peacefully on the calm water.
     The people of the city were expecting the great creature to
destroy the city, it not the entire world.  Yet, the beast just sat
quietly.  The Nimar, still on the tiny island, itself smaller than the
enormous creature, boarded a small boat and paddled toward the beast.
One brave soul mounted a griffin and flew above the winged beast.  He
reported seeing many people within the city, many belonging to races
he had never seen.  Oddly, they all appeared to be asleep.  When he
attempted to land on the beast, his griffin was prevented from doing
so by two smaller versions of the great beast, who drove him back to
the mainland.
     The Nimar however, boarded the craft without incident.  Just
before nightfall, the beast took wing again, with the last of the
Nimar on board, travelling into the sky with a speed greater than the
finest sky ship.  For days the people waited for the beast to return,
but it never did."

Commentary and analysis, by Tiegorus of Maplegrove:
     Those who have studied the lore of Wildspace know this vessel to
be the "Great Wanderer," or "The Spelljammer" as it is more commonly
known.  They will also know the two craft that engaged the griffin
rider as some type of Smalljammer.  I have verified the authenticity
of this event through magical spells and speaking with aged elves
native to the area.  The event has acquired the proportions of an epic
myth in the eight centuries since, but the above account can be
considered accurate.
      One should note that this is the only confirmed instance, in all
of the worlds I have visited, of the Spelljammer actually LANDING, in
this case on water.  The ship does not land because doing so would
break the spell it uses to hold its many passengers, which is sent
though the ship's atmosphere.  The fact that all of the passengers
were asleep when the ship landed suggests that the craft must take
extreme measures to land (put everyone to sleep!) and therefore avoids
it.
      Many less informed historians offer this story as proof that the
humans of Cartania built the Spelljammer at the onset of the Magic
Wars.  That is simply not true: Accounts of the Spelljammer in other
spheres predate the earliest phases of the Magic Wars (2500 standard
years past) by several centuries.  Furthermore, though the mages of
Cartania eventually harnessed sufficient magic to create such a craft,
it was not until the final phases of the Magic Wars that such powers
were available, and even then were used only sparingly.
     I will accept a different theory, that the Wanderer was built by
a group of humans, sometime in the past, and that some (or even all)
of these humans established a settlement on Cartania.  These would
naturally be the Nimar (on other worlds this ancient order of
spellcasters may have different names).  The descendants of these
humans were the ones who summoned the great ship to Cartania.  As for
where it was built, I can only make suggestions drawn from Arcane
records.  The level of magic required to create such a craft has only
existed on a few documented worlds, and in each case it is currently
lost, the world no longer exists, or the knowledge is otherwise
unaccessible.
     Be that as it may, the fact that the Wanderer came to Cartania,
landed, and "personally" carried the Nimar away, indicates that the
Nimar (by whatever name) had something to do with the creation of the
ship, and that the ship was "returning a favor" when it arrived.  It
is highly unlikely that the Great Wanderer, who does not involve
itself with the affairs of groundlings, would respond to any summons,
no matter how compelling, unless its "conscience" required it to do
so.

Translator's notes: This tale exists in several forms, and on several
worlds (including our own "real" world).  Hall-ee-mor Dargess is
renowned among bards for his ability to synthesize fragments of
stories into a cohesive whole.  He spent several months working over
the various forms of this tale, and the resulting epic (presented
here) is a marvel to hear.  Sadly, I lack the literary ability of the
renowned bard, and much of his wonderous poetry has been lost in the
translation.  I have concentrated on preserving the imagery of the
tale, presented here in a prose format.  Unlike most bard songs, this
one is not meant to be sung, but recited, possibly with musical
instruments in the background.  Hall-ee-mor Dargess performs this tale
in that manner.  If you ever visit the world of Cartania, and find a
village called Maplegrove, be sure to visit the Silver Osprey tavern
(Dargess and his wife operate the place), and request a recital of
this tale.  You will never forget it.

              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                           Stanza the First

     The old man in tattered armor approached the festhall where a
grand celebration was in progress. Three individuals, a Wizard, a
Warrior, and a Lady Sage approached the hall to partake in the joy.
The old man called to the Lady Sage.
     "Hold," he said, and the Lady came to him.  "I am a Spelljammer,"
he said, "who has travelled to more worlds than you can imagine.
Please listen to me."  The Warrior and the Wizard entered the festhall
leaving their companion with the Spelljammer.
     "Why detain me?" the Lady Sage asked.  "I have never travelled
off-world and never plan to do so.  Speak to one who would relish your
tale, and allow me to join my companions in celebration."
     "Mine is a tale not to be relished, and not to be told to one of
narrow mind.  I can see wisdom in your eyes. Hear me," the Spelljammer
insisted.
     For an instant the Lady Sage was entranced by the look in the
Spelljammer's eyes.  They appeared to be as deep as space itself, yet
sorrow and longing filled them as well.  Inside the festfall, the
sounds of celebration suddenly grew louder.  Lady Sage hesitated for
another moment.
     "Tell me your tale," she whispered.

                           Stanza the Second

     In a soft voice, the old man began to speak.
     The vortex carried the ship far beyond they limits of the finest
maps, to where the rainbow currents of the flow had grown thin and
cold.  They were trapped, unable to move more than an arm's length.
Their death seemed imminent.  From nowhere a dragon of radiant colors
appeared and made a wide circle around the ship.  The ship made a turn
toward the dragon, and a current began to carry it forward!  The crew
rejoiced!  The dragon had saved them from certain death.  The current
would certainly help them find a path to safety!  Such was not the
belief of the Spelljammer, who slew the dragon with a single balista
bolt.  One of the slain dragon's scales fell to the deck of the ship,
and the corpse floated out of sight.
     "Curse you Spelljammer!" cried the crew, "for slaying the radiant
dragon!  Such was a sign of good omen!"  The cries continued as the
ship moved slowly through the current.  Gradually, the current grew
stronger, and the ship moved faster.  At that the curses ceased, for
clearly the dragon was preventing the ship from reaching the flow
current that would take it home.
     "Hail to thee Spelljammer!" cried the crew, "for slaying the
radiant dragon and setting us free!"  The ship moved away quickly, and
all appeared well.  For days the ship travelled, but no familiar
worlds did it find, and rest for the crew was possible.  The space
around them was larger than the sky, but nowhere was there a breath of
air!
     The lungs of the crew began to feel pain as the ship's air ran
low. "This is the spirit of the dragon taking revenge!" cried a crew
member. "Aye!" cried another, "we have been led to a death in deep
space!"
     "Curse you Spelljammer! This is your doing!  Carry your guilt to
the grave!"  Again the crew turned on the Spelljammer.  One crew
member took a length of silk chord and fashioned a harness.  With it,
the scale from the slain dragon was slung around the neck of the
Spelljammer, and with magic was it made stationary.

                           Stanza the Third

     The ship continued to drift; no worlds on which to land were
found.  The crew grew week and sleep began to overtake them.
Suddenly, in the distance, another ship was sighted.
     From the aftcastle came: "Ship port astern!" "But how?!" the crew
asked.  "There is no current to move it!  How can such a craft move?"
A closer look revealed a ship in the shape of a Kraken, slowly
approaching.  It's color was white as death, for death itself was on
board.  Two figures, were poised on the main deck of the ghostly ship.
One was a woman wearing tattered robes over a skeletal form, and two
red lights for eyes.  The other was a black specter, with no
discernable form at all.
     The crew became terrified, and begged the helmsman to carry them
free, but the ship would not move.  The ghost ship came along side,
and the two figures threw dice to the floor below them.  The specter
regarded the dice and shrieked "The crew is MINE!"  His shadow form
enveloped both ships and the crew fell dead to the floor.
     The Lich came to the Spelljammer, the only one left alive, with
the dragon scale still around his neck. "And you," she hissed, "are
mine."
     At this the Lady Sage interrupted the tale: "Must you fill me
with fear, Spelljammer!?" she cried. "Leave me in peace!"
     "Endure," he said, "I implore you."  After a moment's hesitation,
he continued.
     The Lich regarded the Spelljammer for a moment, then returned to
her ship.  The ghost ship vanished, leaving the Spelljammer alone with
his tattered ship, and the bodies of his slain companions.  He was
alone in deep space.  No one would ever find him, no one would ever
hear him cry for help.  In anguish he drew his sword and impaled
himself upon it.  Yet, the wound closed at once.
     "Curse everything that lives!" he cried. "I despise you all!  I
can no longer live, and yet, I can not die!  If some divine power can
hear me, grant me death!"  But no answer came to him. His agony would
last forever, and rage was all he could feel.
     After a long voyage, a world appeared.  The tattered ship landed,
and the Spelljammer walked among people who could not see him.  They
were happy people, who know about love, beauty, and grace.  As he
returned to the stars, memories of his former life began to stir, and
the rage within him softened.  Finally, a divine answered his plea.
The dragon scale fall to the deck and dissolved into dust.  The spell
was broken; he was free again.

                           Stanza the Fourth

     Sleep claimed the Spelljammer, and he was awakened by a soft,
soothing breeze.  For a moment, his spirit flew with the wind.  He saw
his tattered ship, the rainbow currents of the flow, and a hundred
worlds in an instant.  In a sudden frenzy of light, the ship was
restored, and life returned to the crew.  The Spelljammer is amazed
and overjoyed, but confusion overtook him when he viewed the bodies of
the crew.  They were not restored as he had thought.  Angels had
inhabited the bodies, not the souls who once used them.  A star
appeared from behind a nearby planet, and the angels began to sing.
The song was lovely beyond words, yet haunting and sad.
     The ship entered the flow and moved without a current.  It was a
group of Demons that moved the ship!  They wanted revenge for the
death of the dragon, but the Angels would not allow them to achieve
this as they would have wished.  In frustration, the Demons allow the
Angels to sing.
     Finally, the Angels agreed that the Spelljammer must perform
penance, and that they would chose an appropriate manner.  The Demons
were satisfied with this, and departed.  The Angels placed the
Spelljammer in a trance, and the ship began to move faster than any
ship ever had.  A thousand Spheres passed by in a heartbeat.  When it
stopped, the Angels departed, and the Spelljammer's penance began.  He
looked about at his lifeless crew, and saw only space around him.  His
ship worked only for him now.  No helmsman would ever be needed.
     Still confused about his situation, the Spelljammer saw his home
world before him.  He feared that he is dreaming, and expected his
world to vanish, but it remained.  Quickly he moved the ship toward
his home, and dreamed of the village he grew up in. "Never again will
I fly through wildspace," he said to himself.
     His flight was interrupted by a huge, black form.  From the dark
side of his home world came an enormous ship in the shape of a manta
ray, with a long, back-curling tail like that of a scorpion.  His ship
stopped abruptly.  Only in legends had he heard of a craft like this,
legends he had never believed until know.  Before him, between himself
and his home world, stood the legendary Great Wanderer: The
SPELLJAMMER.

                           Stanza the Fifth

     In the presence of the great ship, the tiny craft broke apart.
The Spelljammer was spared from death by landing safely on the huge
ship.  From a small deck above one of the great ship's eyes he looked
out at his home world and suddenly realized that he could never truly
return home, that in fact he could never remain in one place, ever.
He looked at the citadel on the great ship's back, and recalled the
legends that described the craft as a sentient being, very powerful
and very wise.  He cried out:
     "Great Wanderer, hear me!  What is to become of me?  Why has this
happened to me?!"  No answer came from the great ship.
     "Please, help me!" he cried out again.  A sudden awareness filled
his mind, and a voice spoke to him.
     "I hear your plea," it said quietly, "but your fate has been
decided by one more powerful than I.  I can not change it, but I can
explain it, and make you understand."
     His fate was sealed.  Nothing could reverse it.  After moments of
agony, he finally asked "What must I do?"
     "You must travel the spheres forever," the voice answered,
"recanting your tale and teaching others love and reverence to all
that holds beauty and grace."
     He looked behind him, to see his ship restored, waiting for him.
Slowly he boarded it, and turned toward his home world.  He looked
behind him to see the SPELLJAMMER vanish into the vastness of space.
He took his ship to his home world below, and began his eternal
mission.

                           Stanza the Sixth

     The Spelljammer took his leave of the Lady Sage, and vanished
into the crowded street.  She in turn entered the festhall, deep in
thought.  Sleep did not come to her that night.  Early the next
morning she spied a small ship ascending into the sky, to find another
world, and another being to hear the tale.
     "Fare well, Ancient Spelljammer," she whispered.  She then
returned to her companions, themselves still joyous from the previous
night.  Lady Sage however, was not joyous.  She was sadder, but wiser.









                              ERRATA

The mysterious *jp* or *jpuikko* entry in the Ildris world-description
was a leftover from the writing. I couldn't remember what 'jpuikko'
(icicle) was and didn't bother to check it from the dictionary.

                             COMMENTS

Well, for starters, it was intimidatingly BIG :-)
And the ASCIIzation of the Sj-logo was nicely done.

1.   New Items:

Gargle buster == SJ meets the Hithchiker's guide, eh ?

Evermap and DM grenade are very nice, and are going to be added to my
campaign pronto.

The new helms seem OK, even though I dislike the Sj economy (capture a helm
and get more ca$h than an average dragon has in Switzerland), in my campaign
the sales prices are those that the Arcane subject planet hicks to - in space
they are cheaper (usually the ship costs more than the helm, why would anyone
otherwise buy lousy ships to save a measly tenth of the price). I have not
looked at the prices seriously, but they seem seriously screwed and I intend
to replace them with a pricelist of my own.

2.   New Ships:

Good material again. Most of these beat the new TSR's ships (in the WC's boxed
set) hands down by actually making sense and being logical.

3.   Space groups & noteworthy ships:

More quality stuff - much more usable than the lame adventuring companies in
the Greyspace accessory.

4.   New worlds:

Well, be brutally honest in your assessments...

5.   New monsters:

Arathax - very re-usable, and perhaps usable as food too. The asteroid
     fields need a lot more non-combatant native life and this
     species is a good start.
Holomath - nasty special ability, perhaps some sort of magic 'fouling
     grenades' could be constructed from the gas/corpses.
Orbmax - Beholder: The Next Generation :-) I think most PCs will blindly
     attack it since "it has only four stalks, must be easy prey".
Tabaxi - A classy adaptation, instead of just another insectoid/reptilian
     new race. Since Tabaxi are a sentient race, they ought to have
     god(s) and priests. But they are a new race and letting them have
     an 'own' kind of ship would be pushing credibility.

6.   Characters:

I just skimmed them through. No real commentary, but this Rogue's Gallery's
bound to be of use.

7.   Legends & Lore:

Stuff like this is always in demand. Thanks.

8.   Rhyme:

Nice - perhaps I finish my spelljammerization of Deep Purple's "Stormbringer"
some day.

                            ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

At this time, I would like to give credit to the following
individuals, who helped make this tome possible:

The Mage Spider ship comes curtesy of Chris Bickford (Endral Caine),
who used this fearsome piece of hardware in a PBeM game.  Thanks Chris!
Cbickford@ucs.indiana.edu / Cbickfor@iubacs.bitnet

Reid Bluebaugh (author of the famous "Guide to Sex in AD&D") brought
us the PanGalactic GargleBuster, for those of you who want a stiff
drink after a hard day in space.  In most establishments, one is the limit.
C2mxblu@fre.towson.edu

Vicki L. Domanski, also known as Morgaine, discovered Ville Lavonius's
exotic worlds in an equally exotic place called rec.games.frp.adnd.
Happy hunting!

John Dunn, the Arkangel, brought us the Goodship Orion and her merry,
monstrous crew.  Fly safely!

Ville Lavonius created the three worlds featured in the Travel Log
section, complete with descriptions of inhabitants and adventure
ideas.  Neat stuff! lavonius@kruuna.Helsinki.FI

Eric F. Schetley, the Psionic Samauri, brought us the Bracers of
Wildspace (Too bad I'm not a warrior...) and the Dispel Magic Grenade
(really too bad I'm not a warrior!)

I would also like to acknowledge Lawrence Schick, who created the
original Tabaxi for the first edition Fiend Folio.  If you are out
there, thanks for the really neat monster.  I hope it appears in one
of the new compendiums (if it has not already).


Richard J. Pugh, editor/compiler.
