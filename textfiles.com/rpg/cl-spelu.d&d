THE SPELUNKER/CAVERNIER

DESCRIPTION:  The Cavernier makes his/her living in underground
caverns and catacombs.  The Cavernier is modeled after the modern
day cave explorer (spelunker).  A Cavernier protects the creatures
of the underground, and protect the underground from harm.
      Their main attributes are speed and stamina, so high scores
in deterity and constitution are prefered.  Since speed and
stamina are of the essense he needs at least a 14 in both his
dexterity and constitution.

ROLE:  The Cavernier is a protector of the underground caverns,
and the creatures that live there.  Some of them may receive jobs
as: guides, miners, and even cave explorers.  The Cavernier cares
for all underground caverns and the creatures that live there,
and it is their duty to protect the two from any harm.

SECONDARY SKILLS:  If your DM is using secondary skills then the
character can select any of the following secondary skills:
Jeweler, Limner/Painter, Mason, and the Miner.  The character can
have any two of the four.

WEAPON PROFICIENCIES:  The prefered weapons of the Cavernier are
the: Battle axe, light crossbow, dagger, shortsword, and the
warhammer.  After he becomes proficient in his prefered weapons
he may become proficient in any weapon of his choice.

NONWEAPON PROFICIENCIES:  Cavernier's bonus proficiencies:
(General) Direction Sense, and Blind-fighting  Recommended:
(General) Animal handling, animal training, fire building,
mining, riding land-base, and rope use; (Warrior) Animal lore,
endurance, mountaineering, survival, and tracking

EQUIPMENT:  The Cavernier may buy any equipment that he deems
necessary for thier survival in the underground caverns.  They
can not wear any armor heavier than chain, and can not employ
shields.  The Cavernier at the most only carries 5 weapons.
Those being a battle axe, light crossbow, dagger, shortsword, and
a warhammer.  Arrows, bolts, and quarrels are not considered
weapons so to speak.

SPECIAL BENEFITS:  Caverniers are miners of great skill.  While
underground they can detect the following informatiom when within
10 feet of the particular phenomenon (but they can determine
their approximate depth below the surface at any time).  The
Cavernier receives these mining skills at the first level and they
do not increase.

  Detect grade or slope
    in passage                         1-4 on 1d6
  Detect new tunnel/passage
    construction                       1-4 on 1d6
  Detect sliding/shifting walls
    or rooms                           1-3 on 1d6
  Detect stonework,traps,pits
    and deadfalls                      1-2 on 1d6
  Determine approx. depth
    underground                        1-2 on 1d6
* Note * That the Cavernier must deliberately try to make these
determinations, the information does not simply spring to mind
unbidden.  Races that already posess these skills use their own
tables and get a bonus of +1 to each of these mining skills.
      Since the character spends his life in the underground he
receives a +1 to hit against a creature of his choice, but when
in sunlight or a well lit area the character suffers a (-2)
penalty to hit creatures.
      The Cavernier at tenth level gets the nonweapon proficiency
of animal empathy, and also at 10th level the Cavernier can
distinguish whether or not a rock formation is a stalactite or
the creature know as a piercer.  * Note * The character must have
choosen the mining nonweaproficiency to get this ability

SPECIAL HINDRANCES:  The Cavernier can be any alignment, enless
the character is a ranger or paladin.  The Cavernier does not get
the 10% bonus to earned experience.
     Each Cavernier pack is governed by a set of laws determined
by the Pack leader or so called Grand Cavernier if he fails to
follow his packs laws, he is cast.  He may reenter the pack by
serving penace given by the Grand Cavernier.  * Note * The
Cavernier receives no experience after being cast out, he only
receives experience when he decides to abandon the pack, or
repetitions and then he must do penace before earning experience
again.
      The Cavernier gets the nonweapon proficiency of Animal
Empathy only if he has the nonweapon proficiencies of animal
handling, animal lore, and animal training.
      The Cavernier must have the nonweapon proficiency of mining
at first level to get his mining skills.  * Note * Races that
already have these skills, do not lose them, but they do not get
their bonus if they do not have the mining nonweapon proficieny.

WEALTH OPTIONS:  The Cavernier receives the usual 5d4 x 10gp
starting gold.  The Cavernier may not have more money than he can
carry, so in this case bag of holding could be very useful.

RACES:  The Cavernier is open to all humanoid underground races,
and these are some of them: the dwarf, gnome, minotaur, etc. and
also humans.  Plus whatever other races the DM will allow.
Nonhuman characters are limited to the level of there choosen
class.
     If the DM is using the Dragonlance dwarves then he
automaticly is able to handle the glass spear and control the
creature known as the Horgar.  * Note *  The character must have
the animal handling proficiency, and also must be proficient with
the spear.  And the character has the same difficulty as listed
in the description of the creature called the Horgar.

NOTES:  The Cavernier is available to all of the warrior classes
if they choose to be one, but is just recommended for the fighter
although a paladin or ranger may be one.
     A character can become a Grand Cavernier, when he has
reached the approtiate level of his choosen class, and then he
must leave the pack, and find a cave of his own, and then his
followers will come, as per the followers per their choosen
class.
