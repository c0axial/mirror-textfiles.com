Warrior Kit: Weapon Master

Description:
The Weapon Master is based upon the character 
Garet Jax, from the novel "The Wishsong of Shannara" by Terry 
Brooks. The Weapon Master has devoted him/herself totally to 
the art of personal combat - nothing else matters. Weapon Masters 
are monks of a sort, they follow a strict training schedule that 
leaves them no time for anything else. 
Because of the strength of will necessary to follow 
this career, Weapon masters require a wisdom and intelligence 
of 14, and they must be lawful. Because of the complexity of 
the skills they learn, a dexterity of 16 or higher is also 
required.
Also, only Fighters may become Weapon Masters. Paladins 
and Rangers cannot devote the time necessary, they must also
concentrate on their class skills (Tracking, Turning, Spell 
Casting, etc....)

Role:
Weapon Masters fill a unique niche in society. They 
serve no man, and are not a member of any standing army. They 
are not mercenaries: money means very little to them. They have 
no time for politics, and so they never become involved in petty 
squables.
Weapon Masters have only one goal - to improve themselves. 
This becomes increasing difficult over time, and many Weapon 
Masters become cynical after many years. They tend to side with 
the underdogs of combat, because it is more challenging.
Most Weapon Masters do not advertise their skill, they 
have no desire to be accosted by apprentices or people who "need" 
their help.

Secondary Skills:
If you are using the Secondary Skills system, the Weapon 
master must choose from the following list: Bowyer/Fletcher, 
Weaponsmith.

Weapon Proficiencies:
See Special Benefits.

Non-Weapon Proficiencies:
Bonus Proficiencies:  Blind Fighting, Ambidexterity. 
Recommended: (General) Direction Sense, Fire-Building, 
Fishing, Swimming, Weather Sense, (Rogue) Jumping, Tumbling, 
(Warrior) Bowyer/Fletcher, Endurance, Hunting, Running, Set 
Snares, Survival, Tracking, Weaponsmithing

Equipment:
The Weapons Master has less gold to spend than other 
fighters (see Wealth Options, below), but may spend it on anything. 
However, note the special hindrances given below.

Special Benefits:
The Weapons Master is throughly skilled with weapons. They 
gain one extra weapon proficiency every level - this includes levels 
in which they would normally get no weapon proficiency. They can also 
use their non-weapon proficiencies as weapon proficiencies.
Weapon Masters cannot wear armor (see Special Hindrances, 
below), however, their combat ability improves in such a way that 
they are able to block many attacks. A Weapon Master is able to 
AUTOMATICALLY parry any one melee attack - however, this uses up one
of their attacks. They can do this without declairing their intentions 
to do so at the beginning of the round, and they can do this any number 
of times in a round (up to the number of remaining attacks). If using 
a polearm, they can also use this ability to block attacks not aimed 
directly at them.
Weapon Masters have bonus attacks - they use the following 
table to determine the numbe of attacks per round. If they completely 
specialize in a weapon (by spending the points), they gain an 
additional attack bonus of one row on the table:

Weapon Master Attacks per Round:

LtHvThrThr
LevelMeleeXBowXBowDagDartOther
1-53/21/11/23/14/13/2
6-102/13/21/14/15/12/1
11-155/22/13/25/16/15/2
16-203/15/22/16/17/13/1
21-257/23/15/27/18/17/2
26-304/17/23/18/19/14/1
30+9/24/17/29/110/19/2

Weapon Masters slowly gain the ability to affect creatures
that are normally affected only by magical weapons. This is summarized 
in the following chart:

LevelCan Hit 
5-9+1
10-14+2
15-19+3
20-24+4
25++5

These bonuses do not affect the actual roll to hit, nor do they 
affect damage rolled.
If an optional fumble system is being used (usually, a natural 
one rolled on a to hit roll), the Weapon Master makes a dexterity check 
when one occurs. If the Weapon Master makes the check, the fumble does 
not occur.
Finally, a Weapon Master gains a +2 reaction with Warriors - 
they are impressed by his/her fighting prowess.

Special Hindrances:
With all of these impressive abilities, Weapon Masters have 
many hindrances.
Weapon Masters are wanderers, and never stay in one place.
Thus, they can only keep possessions that they can carry on their 
person. They cannot store items in other places, nor can they use pack 
animals (or NPCs) to carry items/wealth.
Weapon Masters are not good conversationalists. They have a -3 
on all reaction rolls with people who are not Warriors.
Weapon Masters cannot wear any armor or use any shield.
Weapon Masters spend almost all of their time learning weapons, 
and so they do not have thhe time to pick up non-weapon proficiencies. 
As a result, they pay one extra proficiency slot for each non-weapon 
proficiency picked except for the following: All Warrior Skills, Jumping, 
and Tumbling. Note that this slot is in addition to any slot that is 
required because of selecting a non-warrior non-general skill (i.e., it 
would cost a Weapon Master 4 slots to learn Herbalism).
Weapon Masters concentrate on skill and technique, rather than 
brute bashing. As a result, they do not get to use strength modifiers 
for to-hit rolls or damage - either their own or strength granted by 
magical item or spell. 
Weapon Masters cannot gain followers (even though many may offer 
to join with a Weapon Master, he/she does not have the time to deal 
with such henchmen).
Weapon Masters cannot be multi-classed. If a Weapon Master 
should happen to become a dual-class character, they lose all of the 
Weapon Master benefits, becoming normal fighters. They do, however,
keep all of the previously learned proficiencies/specializations.

Wealth Options:
Weapon Masters are not as concerned with wealth as other 
characters are - they start the game with half the funds that a normal 
fighter would possess (5d4x5 gp).

Races:
Halflings cannot be Weapon Masters - they do not possess the 
drive that is neccessary to become one. All other races are acceptable.
