Subject: Dwarnoi Character Class ( LONG! )

                     The Dwarnoi - Dwarven Stone Mages
 
    This is a new character class open to dwarves only. Stone is to the
Dwarnoi as nature is to the druid. The Dwarnoi use the magic within
stones to protect and serve their race, and are well regarded by other
dwarves.
 
Requirements
    A Dwarnoi, besides having to be a dwarf ( the DM may even wish
to limit the class to Mountain Dwarves ), must have an Intelligence of
at least 10 and a Wisdom of at least 12. The latter is a prime requisite.
    Dwarnoi use the same table for level advancement, hit dice and
saving throws as do priests. The level limit on the class is 14th, which
few Dwarnoi have ever attained.
 
Weapons Allowed
    Dwarnoi may wear any type of armor and shield, and any weapon
allowable to dwarves. They attack on the same table as priests.
 
Spells
    Dwarnoi have access to spells regarding stone in both priest and
wizard classes, with some additional spells unique to their class. A full
list is given below.
 
Granted Powers
    The Dwarnoi have a secret language consisting of stone-tapping. It
is rudimentary, at best, but is sufficiently developed to transmit simple
messages. Like all secret tongues, it is jealously guarded.
    The Dwarnoi are resistant to earthquakes, and run no risk of being
swallowed by them, natural or otherwise.
    The Dwarnoi receive a +2 saving throw against petrification attacks,
and any such attack becomes ineffective after the 7th level.
    The Dwarnoi is at a +1 to hit and damage when employing a
hammer only.
    Additional powers are gained at the following levels.
    - At 3rd level, the Dwarnoi can automatically perform all the
detects on page 21 of the PHB with 80% + 2%/level accuracy.
    - At 3rd level and beyond, he can turn stone-related creatures (
Gargoyles, Margoyles, Umber Hulks, but this is to the DM's discrtion )
as if they were undead on the priest turning chart. The Dwarnoi can turn
them as if he was a priest two level lower.
    - At 5th level, he can converse with any creatures that make their
homes within stone.
    - At 10th level, the Dwarnoi can call for an earthquake, but with
dire consequences. He is stripped of all spell-casting and rune-carving
abilities for a month at least, and till that time must not step foot within
a Dwarnoi sanctuary. To do so is to run the risk of being killed by
members of its own sect.
    - Dwarnoi cannot turn undead.
 
Proficiencies
 
    The Dwarnoi use the priest table for both WP's and NWP's. They
must take the proficiency of stonemasonry initially, and mining by 3rd
level. They can take on craftsman skills from the warrior table ( armorer
and weaponsmithing ) without paying the double cost in slots.
 
Ethos
    The Dwarnoi respect the mountains and stones, and the treasures
they conceal within. They consider these metals to have been placed in
stone to be shaped, and carved into new and wonderful works. Mining
solely for profit is detested by the Dwarnoi, though they will avoid
entangling in such affairs.
    The holy symbol of the Dwarnoi is simply a piece of stone. As an
acolyte, the Dwarnoi receives his stone from the mother rock. This is a
boulder from which all members gain their holy symbol from. As time
goes by and the caster rises in level, the rock becomes more smooth and
well-rounded. Losing the stone require a penance of some sort; probably
some minor quest if the loss was due to a good reason, a major endeavor
if not.
 
Sanctuary
    The Dwarnoi center of worship is typically set apart from the rest
of a dwarven stronghold. The dwarnoi may have a location near to the
rest of their kin, but this is used mainly as a location where the Dwarnoi
can create or smith items.
    The actual Dwarnoi temple can be reached only by members of the
sect through special doorways, similar to permanent phase doors.

stone environments only, while Spe: refers to a special conditions for
Dwarnoi whilst using the spell.
 
New Spells
1st lvl:
    Break Fall ( Alteration )
    R       : Special                  Comp: V,S
    Duration: Special                  CT  : 1/10th seg
    AOF     : Special                  ST  : N/A
This causes the floor ( if rock or stone ) beneath the Dwarnoi to become
soft and cushion his fall. He will only take 1/4 of normal damage from
such impact.
 
    Sharpen ( Alteration )
    R       : Held                Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: 6 months / lvl      CT  : 1 turn
    AOF     : 1 weapon            ST  : N/A
This keeps a sharp edge on any one weapon for at least the time period
specified.
 
 
2nd lvl:
    Strengthen ( Alteration )
    R       : Touch               Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: 10 yrs/lvl ( spe )       CT  : 1 week
    AOF     : See below           ST  : N/A
This enables the Dwarnoi to carve a special rune on some structure, a
wall, well, or other stone design, that will keep it sturdy and strong for
the duration specified. About 250 cubic feet of stone per level can be
affected. Earthquakes will not damage the structure.
After the 10th level, the spell becomes permanent until dispelled.
The material components for this spell are a piece of chalk, and a set of
arches constructed of steel. The Dwarnoi must analyze the structure
beforehand, to place the spell appropriately.
 
    WarStone ( Alt )
    R       : 0                    Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: Special                   CT  : 4
    AOF     : Special                   ST  : N/A
This spell enchants up to three small pebbles, which can be no larger
than sling bullets. They can then be hurled or slung at an opponent. The
warstones have a +3 to hit and damage, and are considered to be
enchanted for purposes for determining if a creature can be struck.
Upon striking, the stone shatters and flings shards in a 5'radius, inflicting
1-3 points damage. The stone will still shatter if it misses. ( Less if
smaller than sling bullet sized ).
The material components are three unworked stones.
 
3rd Level:
    Stone Bridge ( Alt )
    R       : 10'                      Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: 1 turn/level                   CT  : 6
    AOF     : Special                        ST  : N/A
This creates a bridge of up to 50 square feet + 25 sq ft /lvl, across any
gap the Dwarnoi desires. It is sturdy and safe to walk across, and can
bear the weight of an elephant.
The material component of this spell is a piece of rope, which should be
knotted together when the spell is cast.
 
4th Level:
    Dwarf Golem ( Conj / Summoning )
    R       : 0                        Comp: V,S,M
    Duration: Perm                     CT  : 3 months
    AOF     : Special                        ST  : N/A
This enables the Dwarnoi to construct a dwarf sized stone golem with the
following stats. ( AC 2; MV 6"; HD 10; HP 45; #AT 2; Da/At 4-10/4-
10; SA Hurl Rocks for 2-8 points damage; SD None; MR Special; AL
N; Sz S ).
This golem is immune to all spells that stone golems are. It can produce
rocks from its body and throw them up to a 30' range. It can not take
any other actions this round if it decides to do so, however.
The golem costs 8,000 gp to make, and after casting, the Dwarnoi must
make a d20 roll and add 2 to it. If the score is above his level, the spell
fails and all the gold is used up. If it is less or equal, the spell succeeds.
 
    WarBoulder ( Alt )
    R        : 0                             Comp: V,S,M
    Duration : Special                 CT  : 1 turn
    AOF      : Special                 ST  : N/A
This creates a similar enchantment as the WarStone on a single boulder
( up to large catapult size ). The Dwarnoi can then make this boulder
hurl itself up to a distance of 10'/level, doing damage as if hurled by a
catapult. Upon striking, the boulder shatters and inflicts 2-h damage in
a 30' radius.
