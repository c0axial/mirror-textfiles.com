    Blademages automaticly have the following spells:
 
Sharp
Level:  1
Range:  Touch
Duration:  special
Casting Time:  1 turn
Area of Effect:  1 weapon
Componets:  V, S, M
 
   This spell will quickly clean, mend, and sharpen a edged weapon.
The sharpness will grant a +1 for 3 rounds of combat.  This spell
is not effective on maces, staves, etc, and does not confer a bonus
if the weapon is magical or enchanted by any means.
Charge
Level:  1
Range:  Touch
Duration:  special
Casting Time:  1 seg + special
Area of Effect:  Weapon Wielded
Componets:  V
 
   This spell allows the caster to channel the 'energy' of
another spell into the weapon.
   Take Janus, a 3rd level mage.  He cast _Charge_ on his
staff.  After that, he channels the power of another 1st level
spell into the staff.  The staff now does an additional 1d6 points
of damage to the first target hit.  If Janus had channeled the power
of his newly earned 2nd level spell, the staff would be do 2d6
additional points of damage.
