The Pirate (A Fighter Sub-Class)
By Aaron Brown
Copyright Oct. 12 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                Pirate (Fighter/Thief)
The Pirate is a sub-class of fighters and thieves and
therefor have both abilities.  To become a pirate you must
have a 17 strength, a 12 constitution, and a 17 dexterity.
The prime attributes are strength and dexterity, for a
Pirate.  A Pirate must spend the first 5 levels of his life
using fighting abilities only (to train).  But from levels 6-
8 he/she must use thieving abilities only (also to train).
Finally, at 9th level, a Pirate becomes a full Pirate and
gains all fighting abilities and all thieving abilities, and
can use both of them.

A Pirate can be a Hafling, Human, Dwarf, or Elf, but racial
restrictions still apply.  A Pirate when studying to be a
thief is considered to be a thief, so use ALL THIEF tables
and descriptions and only them, the same applies to when the
Pirate is training as a fighter.  Once they are 9th level
Pirates they can wear up to chain mail armor and can carry no
shield, and can use thief weapons.  A Pirate uses fighters
height, weight, combat, and gold tables, and a Thieves saving
throw and age tables, but use the tables below for other
purposes.  Pirates can use any magical things that a thief or
a fighter can use.  Pirates use 8 sided dice for Hit points
and have a 35% chance of getting a small ship from their
family.

Character has not been tried out yet so i'm not sure if it
sould be a NPC or PC.  I also don't know if it should be a
AD&D charcter or a D&D character.  Please feel free to adjust
this character as you wish, but I do ask that you send a
message to AARON BROWN.
