EQUIPMENT
    2 or more people, pencils, paper, graph paper, and a few six sided dice.
One of the people will be the GameMaster or GM, the rest are the "players".

HOW TO PLAY
     First thing read booklet. Second make characters (one for each "player").
Third have GM construct maze. Fourth "stock" maze. Fifth play.

     Playing in this game means the GM describes the environment the characters 
are in or can see.  In turn the characters ask questions,move,perform actions, 
fight monsters,collect treasure, and most of all have fun.  Then the process 
repeats itself over and over till the Maze or "Adventure" is finished.

     In construction of maze sertain tables may have a general skill modifier 
placed on roll done on that table. There is four"skill levels" that are 
suggested they are Beginner, Novice, Expert, and Difficult.

     Those tables with a preceeding @ sign may be decreased and those tables 
with a preceeding ! may be increased.
     Beginner        No modifier 0
     Novice          +1
     Expert          +2
     Difficult       +3
     Results that go off the table use the lowest or highest accordingly.

     Using "miniatures" adds a lot of fun to the game.  You can use a 
chessboard or vinyl mats for the grid.  The GM simply redraws or exposes that 
portion of the maze that the characters can see or are in on the playing 
board.  In combat  place the monsters strategically and place the characters at 
the point where the characters first "see" the monster/s.  Commence movement as 
each square = 10' so the movement rolls = number of squares the participants 
can move.  Example if Goerge the fighter rolls a 6 then Goerge moves 6 squares 
(60') and may attack.  You may use the rule that no 2 characters can occupy the 
same square at once and fight or cast.

Character Descriptions

     CLASS...

Wizard: The mighty manipulator of magic, This dude is a thinker not a fighter 
thus s/he is restricted to the armor and weapons they can use. All wizards 
start out with 5 spells and 1 prayer and may choose from either list.

Conjurer: To this dude its who he knows not what he knows that helps Him/Her 
out of a jam. Conjurers start with 3 kinds of summonable monsters and 1 spell 
for back-up.

Magician: This guy/gal studies magic but also believes in self defence.  
Magicians start with 3 spells and better chances in fighting. 

Ranger: This is the dude that loves having friends and getting into fights. 
Rangers are able to use two weapons at once as if having 4 hands.  Rangers also 
have a "pet" monster/animal as a friend and may select another pet every odd 
level.  So its what s/he has and who knows him/her that's important.

Fighter: This dude is a fighter not a thinker, Fierce in battle and hard in the 
head. This dude's foes quickly end up dead.

Martial Artist: This dude "hits" foes 3 ways; Hard, Fast, and Repetitively. 
This one is a lean, mean, fighting machine. Martial Artists get 1 heal spell 
per day.  This dude is his/her weapon they will use certain weapons but may 
only improve on his/her own moves.  Martial Artists also get 3 more ACTS every 
other (odd) level.

Robber: This rogue is crafty, cunning, resourceful and a downright scoundrel. A 
robber can pick anything locks,chests,doors, and even pockets so watch your 
wallet or purse. 

Knight: This is the knight of old, heroic brave and true; none-the-less an 
expert with weapons. Knights start out with a magical +1 weapon given them due 
to their chivalrous deeds.

Paladin: This Holy warrior is thee best with weapons.  Paladins Start out with 
1 prayer and 2 Healing Abilities and may select more prayers/heals. 

Cleric: This good man/woman like the mage believes in self defence. Clerics are 
pretty picky when it comes to weapons, they don't like blades. Clerics also 
have an arsenal of 4 prayers and 3 Healing Abilities.

Holyman: This "brother/sister" is like the wizard a thinker not a fighter and 
uses few weapons if any. This monk/nun however, is well armed with 5 prayers 
and 4 Healing Abilities.
     RACE...

     ELF.  These pointy eared humanoids extremely quick and innately magical.  
Elves start out with 1 spell and may not select another (unless a class using 
magic) so they make good Magicians.

     HOBBIT.  Hobbits are short humanoids like halflings but more hairy.  They 
all start with the healing ability due to their knowledge of the land.  They 
also make good Fighters and Clerics.

     HALF-ELF.  This is a cross between an elf and a human.  Slightly faster 
than a human and pointy eared but not magical like a full elf they none-the-
less make good Fighters.

     HUMAN.  Self explanatory!

     HALFLING.  These are the same little persons of today strong, intelligent 
but slow.  They make good Fighters and Robbers.

     DWARF.  Dwarves are the underground dwellers that are slightly taller than 
a halfling but shorter than a human.  These short men make quality weapons and 
any character may select a magical +1 weapon thus make great Knights (may 
combine the +1 weapons to make a +2 weapon.)

     GIANT.  These "Goliaths" are nothing more than tall (7'-9'(1d3)) humans.  
Very strong and fast runners, giants make great martial artists and fighters.  
Giants also can punch for 3d6 damage.

     SMART MONSTER.  This is the weirdness "Mother Nature" sometimes comes up 
with.  This weirdness results in a "mutant like" monster both intelligent and 
strong. Roll up a monster keeping Class and gaining monster's abilities.  Note 
the monster character is considered a "good guy/gal" and may or may not get 
along well with other characters.  Have fun and use some common sense!
ADVANCEMENT

     On the character type table There is a column titled Lev Req. It should 
contain two numbers separated by a dash. The first number is how many monsters 
the character MUST defeat/kill/conquer to go up a level.  The next number is 
the amount (in thousands) of gold piece value the character has collected/owns/ 
possesses in treasure taken to go up a level. Any time the character satisfact-
orily obtains any of the two the character advances to the next level.

     When the character advances s/he has one choice to make on improving 
his/her's character. Here is the choices ( ACCORDING TO CLASS ).
A. Add 1d6 to Hit Points
B. Subtract 1 from To Hit
C. Add 1 to Is Hit
D. Add 1 ACT/action per round
E. Select one additional Spell, Prayer, or Martial Art Move

I. Increase a spell's/prayer's Effect/range by 1 Target/10'r/10'sq accordingly
J. Increase a single prayer's #x/day by 1

                                   C O M B A T
     When characters engage in battle the action takes place simultaneously but 
in M&M battle is split up into rounds (15 sec.).  This makes it possible to 
resolve battle fairly and ensure the seriousness of it.  This is how combat 
proceeds.
1. Initiative : Who goes first?  Every player and monster (if more than 5 
monsters then roll once for all) rolls 1d6 where the highest goes first.  In 
cases of ties roll again (keeping the tie) 1d6 then the highest of that roll 
becomes ahead the loser.

2. The "First" then declairs what s/he is going to do. Here is some choices
     A. Fight/Strike/etc.
     B. Cast spell/prayer
     C. Move all rolled spaces.
     D. Move 1/2 and fight 1/2 ACTs (those with 1 can't do this)
     E. Use an item
     F. Move 1 space and fight ACTs -1 (those with 1 can do this)
     G. Run away; roll move then double it. If adjacent foe gets 1 free attack.
     H. Dodge/Block/Parry uses all ACTs
     I. Surrender (this usually means death/torture thus "THE END")
     J. Defend (wait for an attack) lets you attack first if attacked.
  Then the next person declairs and so on and so forth.
3. Resolve Movement those that want to Roll 2d6+ racial modifier then move.
     Legal "moves" Forward,Left,Right, or Back. -NO DIAGONALS-
4. Casters/Item Users/Archers; Select "Targets" self/characters/monsters/ 
     empty spaces/etc.
5. First fighter/caster/user strikes by rolling 2d6 add to it any bonus + from 
weapons/spells/etc. if the result is >or = to the characters To Hit(TH) then 
attacker "HITS" (if result is >12 then damage is critical. see crit table) if 
the result is < TH then the attack misses (if 2 is rolled then it is fumbled. 
see fumble table).  Casters "never" miss when it comes to magic but 2d6 is 
still rolled where 2=Spell/Prayer fumble and 12= Spell/Prayer critical.

6. If attack "HITS" then the defender may opt to spend 1 ACT to parry/block/ 
dodge the attack by rolling 2d6 + any modifiers if that result is < or = to 
defenders IH then the attack is fended off.  Magic however, is resolved 
differently.  First some Spells/Prayers have an asterisk * before the name 
those may be saved against by rolling 2d6 where 9 or better has no effect. 
Those that don't have a * or a # before the name do not get a "saving throw" 
they hit.
7. If attack is successful ("HITS") then attacker rolls the damage according to 
his/her weapon/spell/prayer/item + any modifiers then that number is subtracted 
from (-dam) any armor/spell/prayer/item the difference is then subtracted from 
defenders Hit Points If HP reaches 0 then defender "DIES"(if defender has no 
armor then full damage is taken from HP).
8. Then the next one attacks and so on and so forth
9. Continue combat (step 1-9) until there is a "victor".
10. End combat 
11. Take/kill/torture/interrogate/leave prisoners
12. Bandage/Heal/Resurrect casualties
13. Roll for and/or Search for/ Treasure
14. Divide treasure
15. Advance to next level (if possible) any characters that have earned the 
next level.

Treasure is wealth,weapons,and items of magic.  In the monster listings there 
is a column TREA this determines if that monster worries about treasure and if 
any treasure is possessed by said monster.  There listed is (y)es,(m)aybe,(n)o, 
and (y)es *(times)#.  
     Yes = Roll once.
     @Maybe = Roll 1d6; 1-5 = none,6 = roll once
     No = Do not roll, no treasure.
     Yes*# = Roll # times.

     MAZE DESIGN
     First roll for the type of maze and then how many levels up and down.  
Proceed next to what type of entrance it is and the width and heigth of the 
passages.  Next roll passage direction and contents going to the proper 
tables.  Repeat this step until that level is complete.  When stairs is rolled 
determine what kind and how high/low the "stairs" go.  When the passages have 
been made for each level continue till the number of levels originally rolled 
is met.  Mazes made this way can be real short or extremely extensive.  Proceed 
then to number the rooms, passages, and levels.  After the maze is numbered and 
completed fill/"Stock" the maze full of interesting details, monsters indicated 
as well as treasures, and special occurrences and letter each one until done.  
When completed write small paragraphs on each letter and number.  Furthermore 
figure out some objectives or plot for going into the maze.  Voila maze 
complete.  This may take time, patience, and some getting used to but all the 
fun from playing can make it all worth the while.
