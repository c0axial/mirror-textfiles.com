001-"Let's go in."

002-"Let's not go in."

003-"I follow them."

004-"I stab the dragon and tell it to get off me."

005-"I drink the bottle marked POISON on the off-chance that it's the
     extra-healing potion."

006-"I kill it."

007-"Let me handle this."

008-"Whaddya mean, a pentagram only has FIVE sides?"

009-"What a useless scroll. It just says, HASTUR HASTUR HASTUR over and over
     again..."

010-"I though YOU brough the food!"

011-"Why is your torch flame turning blue?"

012-"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH"

013-"Trust me."

014-"I never get lost."

015-(A corridor ahead is full of brown mold)
   "I cast Fireball down the hall, then send my fire elemental to investigate."

016-"Dammit, this thing won't die!"

017-"I bet without Mjolnir you're a real wuss."

018-"He hit me for HOW MUCH?????"

019-"They're only kobolds!"

020-"Hey, this chest just bit me!"

021-"I try to move silently in plate armor..."

022-"I didn't find any traps !!"

023-"Wonder what this button does ?"


024-"Don't worry, he is probably just first level."

025-"This 250' wall has so many holes, it should be easy to climb."

026-"I'll just close my eyes and walk up to the dracolisk holding up my mirror"

027-"Can I eat this green slime?"

028-"I'll just walk up to the dragon invisibly"

029-"Why is this man speaking in sign language?"

030-"This type of undead can't drain levels"

031-"I'll open the door, sneak up on him from behind and backstab him!"

032-"We are in luck! The dragon is sleeping"

033-"That's only a statue"

034-"There is no trap on the door, so let's open it"

035-"Look, behind you!!!"  Said by a gnome(pc) to an ogre as a disliked
     parttymember crept up.  End of the other member.

036-"I have this dungeon at home, I know where everything is!"

037-"Don't worry, the DM won't hose me"

038-"We'll untie the prisoners and lock them in the closet."

039-"Why can't we take Clarissa (Disguised evil high priestess) with us?"

040-"How much will you give me for this idol I found (cursed)?"

041-"I'm not powerful enough, can't you just give me second level."

042-"Don't I get the farie fire bonus on my parry."

043-Star Wars:"Stormtroopers can't hit a Wampa at this dist..."

044-Traveller:"Who took the battery out of my grav belt?"

045-"They're wearing blue robes?  They must be Druids.  Roll for initiative,
     suckers."  (At which point the polymorphed Bone Devils ate him.)

046-"I see HOW MANY wights?!"  (from the crypts of Ravenloft)

047-"Don't worry, wyvern don't attack unless they're provoked."

048-"You watch the door, I'll take out the Gas Spore (Beholder) that's guarding
     the treasure."

049-"A Nightmare, huh?  I'll attack for one round and prepare to run."

050-"I'll take off my armor so I'm silent and slip past the dragon."

051- "They need a twenty to hit me, I'm invincible"

052-(While trapped in a dungeon..) : "Don't worry, I have a plan!!!"

053-"I bet that without Mjolnir you're a real wimp."

054-"Who's the bitch with the spiders?"

055-"We killed all monsters on this level."

056-"I've been here before. There are no traps in this section."

057-"What do you mean 18 meter long crocodile--you just said crocodile."
 
058-"Well ...., I'll touch it again"

059-"I attempt to disbelieve"

060-"I cast a fireball" (into a 10'x10'x10' room)

061-"I know if I draw a card I'll get the VOID."

062-GM:"You're very lucky, you all don't know how lucky you are! Save or take
        210 points of damage"

063-GM:"You don't get your +5 for being a dwarf, because it's special bodak
        power"

064-" It's OK, I trust her..." ... *BOOM!!!!!!*


065-"Stand back you wimps.  I'll kill it." 

066-"Oops."

067-"OK! I moon the Balrog!"

068-"My first arrow MISSED the magic-user pointing at me?? OK, I shoot again!"

069-"Where'd that thief go now?"

070-"Trap? What trap?"

071-"So what?"

072-"Don't be silly.  If this was really the ship's "Self-Destruct Button",
     do you think they'd leave it lying around where anyone could press it?"

073-"Hmmm...the sign on the door says, "AIRLOCK".  I wonder what's inside."

074-"You're all a bunch of wimps!!  I'll prove to you myself that an entire
     orc stronghold is no match for your average barbarian."

075-"All right, we're in an unexplored dungeon in total darkness with no
     light sources or infravision...Hey, I know!!  Let's yell and scream a lot 
     so we can locate each other by sound!!"

076-"I'm going to kill our captives anyway, and I don't give a damn whether
     the other goody-good PC's like it or not."

077-"Y'know, since our druid's been so obnoxious, it would probably serve him
     right if we set his precious forest on fire."

078-"A clever bluff, Agent N42, but not clever enough.  You see, right away I
     recognized your `pistol' as a cleverly disguised cigarette lighter."

079-"A creature with two BABOON heads on a scaly REPTILIAN body?  With
    TENTACLES for arms?  Hunh.  Must be some stupid wizard's magical construct.
    Let's kill it."

080-"Yes, it's true I humiliated the DM in front of the debating team
     Wednesday, but he's much too broad-minded to take it out on my character."

081-"OK, O Mighty Odin, as long as you're not gonna answer my prayers, I'm
     gonna tell ya what I REALLY think of ya!"

082-"I drop trough and expose myself to the arch-mage as a gesture of contempt."

083-"Well, guys, I'm sorry my activities in the last town got us all tarred
     and feathered, but you're not going to hold that against me, are you?"

084-"No, I'm sure there's some stipulation that says a disintegrate spell
     won't work if the spellcaster casts it on himself.  Here, I'll prove it."

085-"Oops, I spilled flaming oil on my beard.  I'd better wash it off after
     we kill this fire lizard."

086-"Well, we know he's LAWFUL evil, so he should keep his word when he
     promised not to betray us."

087-"So I'm safely across the pit?  Whew!  For a minute there I was worried
     that you might remember my encumbrance penalties."

088-"Well, as long as I've stumbled into Princess Savitra's bedroom, I might
     as well try to seduce her."

089-"Thank God!!  A hobgoblin camp up ahead!  Maybe they can help heal our
     wounded!"

090-"Don't worry!  The chances of me blowing a climb walls roll twice, at my
     level, are infinitesimal."

091-"All right, I jump...Now on the way down, I activate my ring of feather
     fall...no, wait, didn't I lend it to Jim?"

092-"So you're Tiamat, huh?  Are you evil?  Yes?  Would you like to convert?"

093-"I cast a `gate' spell and gate in the Iraqi Air Force."

094-"Well, *I* trust our party thief, and if he says this door isn't trapped,
     that's good enough for me."

095-"Well, I didn't much like this character, anyway...Here goes nothing..."


096-"I swing the Toxic Avenger's mop at the grenade so I can bat it across the
     room at the aliens...Wait!  Isn't that grenade Contact Fused ???"

097-"All right, I guess Toronaga's right.  There can't possibly be anything on 
     the other side of this airlock.  Why not open the damned thing."

098-"Whistling sounds?  Naw, they can't have a grenade launcher!"

099-"Okay, there's nothing guarding the bridge.  I go through the door and find
     the helm."

100-"They can't possibly outflank us.  We have a multi-scanner!"

101-"Come on!  Arrows versus Kevlar?"

102-"What do you mean Tsu Han's pilotting the shuttle?  Does he even have
     Insystem Pilot?  WHY ARE YOU SMILING AND SHAKING YOUR HEAD?"

103-"So that giant fell into the pit?  I'll jump over it and get his treasure."

104-"Oh, that sorceress looked a little pale when she examined the mirror which
     has the pentagram in front of it on the floor.  I think I'll break the
     mirror."

105-"It's not trapped, you just want it to yourself."{He still got it for 
     himself.}
     
106-"Me first Me first."

107-"Dinosaur? Hey, no problem, right Balinor?"

108-"You call yourself a barbarian, you son of a witch ?"

109-To powerful demon:  "Try me sh*t breath!"

110-To sleeping dragon: "Oops, sorry...didn't mean to disturb you."

111-"Come on, we haven't found any traps so far."

112-Ranger: "What do I see?"
    DM:"Do you remember the trap that killed Indy's guide in Raiders of the
        Lost Ark?"

113-"Diamonds ... Gold... Saphires !!! Terry! Terry, we're rich, we're
     rich, we're fabulously wealthy !!!!  ...Terry .....  Terry ??"

114-"Let's walk this way."

115-"Hey folks, follow me, I remember the way to the dungeon exit."(Lost)

116-"I never get to have any fun!"

117-"You mean they get to use the critical hit chart too?"

118-"Hey, I know a dragon when I see one."

119-"What do you mean the whole room we're in detects as a trap?"

120-"Hey you! Frost Giant! How's the weather up there?"

121-"Just watch, I bet I get the one item that's cursed."

122-"I'm invincible!"

123-"Don't worry.  I know what I'm doing!"

124-"Stop!"

125-"A sign labeled `pit'?  I walk up to it."

126-"No problem.  That's easy!"

127-"Hey, I found it.  I'm keeping it."

128-"I think we'll have to reason with him."

129-"Hah! I'm not dead yet.  I still have five hit points."

130-"Oh, no.  We're being rescued.  How embarrassing!"

131-"Yeah, I know it's dangerous, but think of the experience points."

132-"I stand right underneath the Fire Giant and point my wand straight up."

133-"Don't worry.  I've got a plan."

134-"They can't see me.  I'm invisible!"

135-"I wonder what's in here?"

136-"He wouldn't try that trick again!"

137-"Trust me, guys."

138-"Just because you're a dragon doesn't mean you can push ME around."

139-"They don't look so tough."

140-"I'm SURE there are no traps."

141-"I actively disbelieve!"

142-"What do you mean trolls regenerate!?!"

143-"Here kitty, kitty, kitty..."

144-"I'll open it."

145-"It seems easy enough"

146-"I think he can be trusted."

147-"Those noises are probably nothing."

148-"I'll pull the lever."

149-"Money!"

150-"Magic is for wimps."

151-"Oh.  He'll miss.  Just look at my AC."

152-"Oh no!  Let's go help them!"

153-"Run away!"

154-"I want to kill something."

155-"All clear, guys."

156-"Gummy werebears? They should be cake to kill once they turn human."

157-"Wait a minute, didn't the old man say something about a curse?"

158-"Hey, where'd all the big spiders come from?"

159-"Okay, Ed, your underwear explodes!"

160-"Bob, you have any grenades left? Throw me one..."

161-"AGAIN!?!?!"

162-"He shot out my eye? Okay, I tear out my other eye and throw it at him
     as a gesture of defiance."
163-"I pull the metal ring out of the sphere."(Recognize a Holy Hand Grenade?)

164-"This is a push-over dungeon."

165-"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea."

166-"I'll use my taunt skill."

167-"Your mother was a Gully Dwarf."

168-"My God will protect me."

169-"You wouldn't dare!"

170-"Hey, we're out! We're safe!"

171-"I'll try it on."

172-"C'mon!  We're a team!"

173-"You don't look like a mage!"

174-"It'd be stupid to trap this!"

175-"I'll kick the door in!"

176-"It could be dangerous!"

177-"Here, hold this rope while I go down."

178-"I thought you brought the food!"

179-"Well, if you didn't belch, who did?"

180-"Isn't there anything exciting in this dungeon?" (said to GM)

181-"Uh guys? Hello? Anyone?"

182-"Dragons give you a lot of Exp."

183-"I know an illusion when I see one."

184-"Who's the bitch with the spiders?" (ahhh! the infamous Lloth)

185-"I sit on the pale lady with the funny teeth." (Ahhh! the infamous vampire)

186-"Mysterious shadows in the room? I'm not scared --- you can't spook me!"

187-"There's a smell of gas, huh? Well, my lantern is hooded. It ought to be
     safe."

188-"Take off my armor and try to swim? Forget it --- I worked hard to get this
     +3 plate mail. Besides, the DM never lets anyone die --- he wouldn't
     let me drown, would he?"

189-"I cast a lightning bolt at the ochre jelly."

190-"Lightning bolts don't ricochet off stone walls, do they?"

191-"A ballista? What's that? How many dice of damage does it do?" {Twenty.It's like a
     crossbow, only MUCH larger.}

192-"So what if he calls the guard? A backwater town like this can't have
     a very big militia."

193-"Only six inches long? Ha... Wait, you don't mean six _scale_ inches,
     do you?" {said in miniature-figures-game. Character itself was 3/4" high.}

194-"...and then I... Uh, guys? Why are looking at me like that? Guys?"
     {After using a spell called "Polymorph Other" }

195-"What do you mean, `It doesn't work' ?" {Item with no more charges left.}

196-"Oh these, I've fought them before..."

197-"Then I'll hit him back!" {spoken at the start of a bar brawl.}

198-"I'm bored..."

199-"Quick!  What did that scroll say ?"

200-"How did he dissappear like that ?" {About a hostile warrior with a ring
     of invisibility and two attacks per round.}

201-"I'll try to pick his pockets." {Pockets belonged to a level 30 mage.}

202-"Maybe we should just kill him."

203-"Read it to me." {It was a fireball scroll.}

204-"You mean there's more ?" {About undeads which entered the room}

205-"MAGIC ITEMS!"

206-"He looks like a sunburnt elf?  Huh."

207-"I'll light a fire." (In the woods at night (attracted bears)}

208-"You'd have to be a GOD to smile after that hit!"


209-GM:"You DID take the swimming skill?" (to a player when character fell
       overboard.)

210-"I'll stand guard." (Didn't want to enter orc cave.Orcs were out. Orcs
     came back.)

211-"What do you mean I hear water?" {in a tunnel}


212-"I bar the door!" {Door opened inward.}

213-"I'll cover you!"

214-"Take out a Beholder's eyes, and Bingo!"

215-"I can't possibly miss..."

216-"Don't worry, I can hit him!  I can hit him!"

217-"Shut up, bird!" {to a parrot who happened to be repeating the True Name of
     a demon which subsequently exterminated the party}

218-"But he has to be our friend!"

219-"How would you like to have this sword?"

220-NPC:"Take this ring as a token of my esteem." {This party no longer accepts
	 gifts from unknown NPC's.}

221-PLAYER:"BEGONE THINGS OF EVIL!!!"  REPLY:"Begone thing of good."

222-"I go through the door... Wait, I check for traps!"

223-"Don't be silly. That kind of monster NEVER follows you."

224-"I run up to the monster, throw my magic net over it, and try to take the
     jewel from around its neck." {But nets don't stop creatures from biting.}

225-"Hmmm... odd-colored walls. Well, I touch one." {turned to stone}

226-"I wonder what the black-and-yellow striped ring above the seat does?"
     { Ejection Seat. No atmosphere and no vacc-suit.}

227-"What do you mean, vacc-suit proficiency? I thought it was perfectly
     straightforward, like wearing clothes..."
     [From a character attempting to fight hand-to-hand in one.]

228-"But the directions SAID to `pull pin and throw' !"
        [From a beautifully role-played traveller character from a non-
         technological world. He was given a scout ship survival pack,
         which among other gimcracks, contained concussion grenades.
         When he got in trouble, of course, he pulled the pin out of
         one and threw it ("it" being the pin, naturally)...]

229-"Uh, what does 'explosive decompression' mean?"

230-"Why the hell do you always put `Graf' before your name? Is that this
     backward planet's equivalent of `Duke' or something?"

231-"Don't worry - I have Pilot-7."

232-"What do you mean `energy weapons are illegal' ?"

233-"DO NOT OPEN"

234-"Easy kill."

235-"I've got you now!"

236-"Is this one really able to breath fire?"

237-"Trust me. I know what I'm doing"
