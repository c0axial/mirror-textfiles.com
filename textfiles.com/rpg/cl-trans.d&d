The Transgressor

Description:  The Transgressor makes his living battling and
destroying all things of good.  They are modeled after the racist,
their prejudice being against things that are good by nature.
     Their main attributes are strength and speed, so high strength
and dexterity are prefered, so they need at least a 14 in both.  A
high constitution is also important.

Role:  The Transgressor is a believer that all good things must
die.  They will fight paladins to the death, and any other good
creatures.  The Transgressor can find jobs as a Dark Knights,
Murderers, Tax Collectors, and Assassins of good.

Secondary Skills:  If your DM is using secondary skills the
character can select any of the following secondary skills:
Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Weaponsmith .  The character can have
any one of the three.

Weapon Proficiencies:  Required: Battle axe, lance (any),
bastard sword (one or two-handed), longsword, shortsword, and
the trident.  The Transgressor must become proficient in these
weapons before gaining proficiencies in any other weapon.

Nonweapon Proficiencies:  Bonus nonweapon proficiencies: Blind-
fighting.  Recommended (General): Animal Handling, animal training,
blacksmithing, direction sense, riding land-based, rope use;
(Warrior): Animal lore, armorer, bowyer/fletcher, hunting,
tracking.

Special Benefits:  The Transgressor has the a skill known as
Pugilism: This ability give the him a +1 bonus to hit and to damage
against creatures and things with good alignments.
     The Trangressor has the theif abilities of a Moving Silently,
and Backstabbing.  This ability is equal to that of a thief with
the same level.

Special Hindrances:  The Transgressor must be any evil alignment,
and does not recieve a 10 percent bonus to earned experience.
     The Transgressor has a code to follow known as "The Code of
Shadow", stating: Mercy is never due the opponent.  Always fight to
the death.  All good things must die.
     The Transgressor will not use any weapon bigger than size
medium.  Their is one except the Transgressor may use a lance.  He
only recieves his thief abilities while wearing chain or lighter
armor, and backstabbing against good.  The Transgressor must
follow his code if he fails to do so he looses his thief abilities
and will be considered a normal fighter.
     The Trangressor only recieves his Pugilism ability against
creatures, or people of good, and he must choose a weapon of choice
at first level.

Wealth Options: The Transgressor recieves the usual 5d4 x 10gp
in starting gold., and will spend on the equipment he deems
necessary for his survival.
     While the Transgressor can have any monetary amount of
treasure, they cannot have more treasure than they can carry.
So in this case a Bag of Holding is very useful.

Races: Any race that enjoys destroying things that are good and
holy can become a Transgressor, but it is only recommended for
humans.  Nonhuman characters are limited to their racial
restrictions of their choosen class.

Notes: The Transgressor is truely an evil person in every
respect, but he still has some respect for the church, and so he
will not defame a House of any god.  It is believed that the
Transgressor was once a man of peace and one with god, but has
fallen from grace and has become twisted an evil.  Rumors say
that someday the Transgressor may someday rejoin the church, and
when that day comes the world will be in perfect harmony.
     The Transgressor will prefers not to use missile fired
weapons or hurled weapons.  He believes that such weapons are for
cowards.  The DM may wish to change this rule for his or her
campaign.
