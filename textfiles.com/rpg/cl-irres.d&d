Re: THE IRRESOLUTER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Irresoluter

Description: The Irresoluter is a minion to undead or unholy
creatures that walk the night.  They serve their undead masters in
hopes for power, and the ultimate goal of immortality.  They are
modeled after the cult worshippers, and those believing in
supernatural forces.
     Their main attributes are strength and influence, so high
strength and chrisma are prefered.  Since strength and charisma
are of the essence, they need at least a 14 in both.  A high
constitution is also important.

Role: The Irresoluter is a minion to the undead, serving their
master, and doing jobs that can not normally be done by the
undead themselves.  They work in the shadows of darkness, and
will oppose those that attempt to slay undead.  The Irresoluter
can find jobs as a Darkling Lords, Undead Minions, Servents of
the Undead, and Assassins of all that is good and holy.

Secondary Skills: If your DM is using secondary skills the
character can select any of the following secondary skills:
Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Weaponsmith .  The character can have
any one of the three.

Weapon Proficiencies: Required: Battle axe, dagger, any sword,
quarterstaff, and the sickle.  The Irresoluter must become
proficient in these weapons before gaining proficiencies in any
other weapon.

Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus nonweapon proficiencies: Blind-
fighting, Direction Sense.  Recommended (General): Animal

languages, reading/writing, religion, spellcraft; if a (Wizard):
same as the priest; if a (Rogue): Appraising, disguise, reading
lips, ventriloquism.

Special Benefits: The Irresoluter has a Fear Aura that surrounds
him, and recieves this ability at the 9th level at that time his
reputation is known.  All within sight of the character will stand
motionless do to fear for 1d4 +1 rounds.  A person may save versus
Paralyzation for half the ammount of time.
     The Irresoluter has the thief ability of Hiding in Shadows.
This ability is equal to that of a thief with the same level.
The Irresoluter also recieve a bonus of +1 to hit an to damage
with a weapon of choice.

Special Hindrances: The Irresoluter must be any evil alignment,
or that of his undead master.  They do not recieve a 10 percent
bonus to earned experience.
     The Irresoluter's Fear Aura only affects people or creatures
that are lower in level than that of the Irresoluter.
     The Irresoluter only has his thief ability at night.  The
Irresoluter must also choose his weapon of choice at first level,
failure to do so will result in a loose of the bonus.

Wealth Options: The Irresoluter recieves the usual 5d4 x 10gp in
starting gold., and will spend on the equipment he deems
necessary for his survival.
     While the Irresoluter can have any monetary amount of
treasure, they cannot have more treasure than they can carry.
Excess treasure must be exchanged into a more portable form or is
given to their undead master.

Races: Any race that is willing to serve the undead and unholy can
become an Irresoluter, but it is only recommended for humans.
Nonhuman characters are limited to their racial restrictions of
their choosen class.

Notes: The Irresoluter is truely an evil person in every respect,
serving an undead lord.  And doing his bidding, for example: the
removing of a cross or holy symbol from an area.  They will
destroy those that attempt to destroy the undead, and since they
are living, they are not affect by turning undead abilities.  Since
the Irresoluter is evil, rangers and paladin can not take this
kit.  Some Irresoluters have been know to break from the undead
lords, and become vindicators, or aid vindicators.
     The Irresoluter is open to any class.  Mages will study spells
from the following schools of Magic: Alteration, Conjuration/
Summoning, and Necromacy.  Priests will select spells from the
following spheres: All, Combat, Necromantic, and Protection.
Thieves will prefer the following abilities: Open Locks, Find/
Remove Traps, Move Silently, Hide In Shadows, and Detect Noises.
He has even distribution among the other abilities.  Remember the
ultimate goal of the Irresoluter is to become undead themselves.
