Hi there!

The file WFRPINTO.ZIP contains a scenario for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.
This adventure, called ~Into the Mages' Coffin~ is about an old wizard
who was trapped into a chest. To get a good idea on the adventure, read
episode 4: History of Nomagionysos.

I hope to breath some life into sharing adventures and am putting up a
'good example'. Have fun with it!
