------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just thought i would post a "new" class that was designed for
our campaign world.  We were wondering just what kind of a reaction
we could get from folks out there in netland. Admittedly, not all of 
the ideas contained within are original.  In fact, the Warlock/Witch
is a compilation of ideas/concepts from several books, and a movie, that
has been supplemented by a lot of our own ideas on what a Warlock/Witch
should be.  True enough, the class presented here can be a powerful and
deadly character class, but only if in the hands of a competent roleplayer.
However, if the other characters, be it PC's or NPC's, are competently
playing their classes a game balance can still be easily maintained. (IMHO)
In the trial runs in our campaign, there have been two Warlocks (1st and 9th
level) and a Witch (13th) played.  At any level Warlocks/Witches can be
loads of fun. :^)

Be honest, but please be gentle... first posting you know. ;^)

And now, with lots of fanfare...       

WARLOCK/WITCH

The warlock is a subclass of the Priest class. The Warlock (witch if
female) is a person who is an advocate and devout worshiper of Demonic
Forces. They receive both Priest and Mage spells, at a limited rate and
have several special abilities to boot. Unfortunately with such power
comes several restrictions. 

Ability Requirements: Wisdom 13
                      Intelligence 13
                      Constitution 9
Prime Requisites:     Wisdom and Intelligence
Races Allowed:        Human, Elven, Half Elven
Alignment Restrictions: Any Evil

    Warlocks receive a 10% Experience point bonus if they have both
Wisdom and Intelligence scores above 16.

 (Note:  We didn't figure there would be any great need to

    One of the least common type of Priest is the Warlock. The Warlock
embraces the dark forces of Demonic Powers. In return for their evil
service, Warlock's are granted certain powers beyond those of the normal
mortals. They are both granted spells by their Demonic masters as clerics
receive spells from their deities, and study 'black' magics as the mage.
So the Warlock must both study and pray to be at his full magic
potential. Warlocks may study Mage spells in the Schools of Necromancy,
Greater Divination, Conjuration/Summoning and Enchantment/Charm.
Warlocks may receive spells from Demon masters from the following spheres
Necromantic (major), All (major), Charm (major), Divination (major),
Astral (major), Summoning (major), Healing (minor), Protection (minor),
Thought (minor), Time (minor) and Wards (minor). Warlocks with high
Wisdoms receive bonus spells as does the Priest, but according to the
following table:
  
    Wisdom    Spell Bonus
     15        one 1st
     16        one 1st
     17        one 2nd
     18        one 3rd
     19        one 2nd 

     Warlocks are restricted to the following weapons : Blowgun, Dagger,
Staff, Sling, Sickle, Whip and Throwing Knives. Warlocks may not wear
any armor (with the rare exception of Elven Chain) or imploy shields,
but they may use bracers. They follow the THAC0 progression of Priests.
     Warlocks start off with 2 initial weapon proficiencies and 4
non-weapon proficiencies. They receive another weapon prof. every 4
levels and additional non-weapon prof. every 3 levels. Their penalty for
employing weapons they are not proficient in is -4. Warlocks may choose
non-weapon proficiencies from all Groups except the Fighter Group.
warlocks start off with Spellcraft and Religion as free initial
non-weapon prof. 
     Due to their covert, dark dealings, Warlocks have developed several
Theiving Skills. They have the below base scores, adjusted for Race and
Dexterity and gain an addition 15 points to allocate to these scores 
(with no more than 5 going to any one score per level) per level. 
NOTE: 5 points per level must go to Read Languages, and no score, with
the exception of read languages, can ever be increased to above 80%

Theiving Skill Base Scores
  
  Move Silently    10% 
  Hide in Shadows  10% 
  Detect Noise     10% 
  Read Languages   10%

     Due to the total dedication they give, and the sacrafices they make
to their Demon masters, Warlocks have been granted certain special
abilities. These abilities are listed below:
     
     - Warlocks gain +4 to all saving throws vs. Necromatic spells
     - Warlocks affect undead as evil priests of 2 lvs below their
       actual ability
     - Warlocks radiate a personal Protection from Good (as spell) aura,
       which may only be detected by Paladins  
     - At 3rd level Warlocks may Bestow Curse (as spell) once per week
       per 4 levels of ability
     - At 5th level Warlocks may utter a Word of Fear (as Mage spell)
       once per week per 3 levels of ability
     - At 7th level of ability, Warlocks can brew poisons, and attract a
       Familiar (as Mage spell)
     - At 9th level Warlocks may Change Self (as spell) once every 3
       turns
     - At 13th level, a Warlock may summon a Minor Demon for a period of
       666 turns as a personal guardian/servant. This may only be attempted
       once per month with a 5% chance of success per human sacrafice involved
       in the ceremony. The ceremony takes 3 turns plus 1/2 turn per human
       sacrafice and involves about 500sps worth of preperation.
     - At 17th level a Warlock may call for a unholy steed. This occurs
       in the same manner as Paladins with the exception that the steed is a
       Nightmare.
     - At 21st level the Warlock may Bestoy a Major Curse. This is the
       same as the 3rd level clerical spell except that it lasts for 6-24 
days.
       This may be done once per week per 6 levels of the caster.
     - Finally, at 25th level, the Warlock may summon a Major Demon, as
       per the 13th level ability, but every time this is done, the Warlock
       runs a 35% chance -1%/level of the Warlock of having the Demon take
       the Warlock's soul in return for the service. 

     Warlocks may gather in covenants (groups of three) to increase
their spell casting ability. When gathered the highest level member of
the covenant may cast spells as if he was his own level + 1/2 the level
of the next highest level member + 1/4 the level of the third member.
This only applies to Clerical Spells and is only in effect so long as
the three remain together. Unfortunately, when gathered in a covenant,
any damage done to one member is also done to the other two. Gathering
in a covenant requires a special ceremony lasting 3 turns and requiring
no less than 3 pints of fresh blood. If the blood is from a non human
(or demi human) the covenant has a 25% chance of not working.

    Warlocks have the following restrictions:
    
    - Warlocks may not tread upon consecrated (Holy) ground. To do so
      causes the Warlock 2d6+2 points of damage/round 
    - Warlocks are affected by Holy Water as Anti Paladins
    - Warlocks can only heal themselves. If they are healed by Priests
      of any good or neutral faith, they take damage in the amount they would
      have been healed. If healed by evil priests, they only get 1/2 the
      normal amount healed
    - All natural animals, with the exceptions of creatures of the night
      and darkness (serpents, black cats, ravens, etc), are unfriendly towards
      Warlocks, and will back away from them if at all possible. If cornered
      by a Warlock, they will attack the Warlock to the best of its ability.
    - Weapons and items of cold wrought iron do double normal damage to
      Warlocks
    - If fresh blood of a Warlock is obtained , and a special 'Compass'
      of brass is constructed, a Priest can track a Warlock so long as the
      Warlock is within 1/2 mile per level of the Priest and so long as the
      blood does not dry up. This 'Compass' requires about 4 days to make and
      the materials cost about 150 sps.
