Mage Spells and Cantrips    Level:1


Catfeet (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  Cantrip			Area of Effect:  1 pair of feet
   SOURCE:  Dragon			Casting Time:  1/6 SEG

Explanation/Description:  This personal cantrip, enacted by making a stroking motion with the 
fingers of one hand, acts upon the caster (and cannot be made to affect another person) for 1 round 
(plus per level of the caster).  Movements or weight (tread) of the caster's feet, regardless of the 
surface being walked upon or climbed, are rendered silent.  This does not cloak other sounds.  In 
addition, the caster will land, balanced and unwinded, on his feet, from a fall of any height 
suffered while the cantrip is in effect (and a modifer of -1 from each die of falling damamge 
suffered applies).  The dewomer also lends some surety of traction and movement; a -15% chance 
of slipping or falling in damp, greasy, or otherwise slightly slippery conditions underfoot. Note 
that this does not enable the caster to climb or walk upon walls or ceilings unless other magic is 
employed (such as a spider climb spell), but will reinforce all such magics to lend increased 
safety in hazardous conditions.


Horn (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  Cantrip				Area of Effect:  Special
   SOURCE:  Dragon				Casting Time:  Special

Explanation/Description:  A haunting-sound horn cantrip causes the sound of a non-existent horn 
or trumpet being winded to be heard within 2" (6" if loud).  The pitch, volume, apparent distance 
(echo and muffling), and the length of note (only a single call is permitted) are all controllable by 
the caster.  The caster faintly or inaudibly hums a tone to set the pitch, and then opens his mouth 
into an O-shape while cupping the fingers of one hand over it.  The trumpet call will last as long 
as the mouth is opened in an O.  The volume and steadiness of the tone are controlled by the 
fingers (which flare open to increase volume, and pinch shut to mute it) and can be shaken to give 
a tremulous note.  A caster practiced in the use of this cantrip can imitate horn blasts perfectly.


Listen (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  Cantrip				Area of Effect:  1 creature
   SOURCE:  Dragon				Casting Time:  1/10 SEG

Explanation/Description:  A person-affecting listen cantrip enables the caster to attract the 
attention of a target creature within 6".  The cantrip is activated by the caster's pointing at the 
target and then at himself, while simultaneously saying, "Ahem." The target will be alerted to the 
message subsequently (beginning within 1 segment of the casting) spoken by the caster.  The 
cantrip does not act as a message spell; there must be no barriers to sound between the caster and 
the target, and the cantrip does not improve the target's hearing or the volume of the caster's voice 
- nor does it capture the target's full concentration, so it will not ruin or delay spellcasting.  If 
the message is spoken in a language not understood by the target, the cantrip does not translate it.  
The cantrip is ideal for alerting a friend to the presence of the caster.  A listen cantrip will never 
be cast on the wrong target due to movement during the caster's pointing; the caster's view of the 
target determines the target.


Scorch (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  Cantrip			Area of Effect:  1 object            
   SOURCE:  Dragon			Casting Time:  1/3 SEG

Explanation/Description:  This reversed cantrip, despite its name, creates neither flame nor heat.  
Instead, by magically exciting the molecules on any non-living object (of up to 100gp weight), it 
causes the object to char without noise, smell, or smoke. The caster must touch the object (to hit 
roll required if another creature is attempting to protect the object or keep the caster from it), 
and the object is allowed a saving throw vs. magical fire.  If the save fails, the object is comsumed.  
This cantrip will readily destroy magicial writings such as spellbooks and scrolls.  The verbal 
components is a hissing noise; the somatic component is merely touching the object to be affected.


Snatch (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  Cantrip			Area of Effect:  1 person            
   SOURCE:  Dragon			Casting Time:  1/6 SEG

Explanation/Description:  This person-affecting cantrip causes a brief, violent jerking force to 
act upon a body portion or limb of a subject creature.  This force has little strength, but may 
serve to cause a running being to stumble or turn about, or cause someone to fumble or drop small 
objects.  A saving throw determines whether such objects are actually dropped, or a fall or mishap 
actually occurs or whether the snatch spell merely delays the subject for 1-3 segments. The 
snatch is a brief tug, not an unseen servant.  The caster hisses softly at the subject being, and 
simultaneously makes a jerking motion wiht a hooked finger, visualizing the location and percise 
direction of the desired snatching, to enact the cantrip.


Spark (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  Cantrip			Area of Effect:  Special             
   SOURCE:  Dragon			Casting Time:  1/2 SEG

Explanation/Description:  This personal cantrip is enacted by the caster snapping his fingers and 
making a popping verbal noise simultaneously;  this causes a large, powerful blue spark to come 
into being at any precise location (familiar, or unseen and merely chosen by the direction and 
distance) within a range of 1"/level of the caster.  The energy of the spark will be transmitted by 
any conducting material it contacts, but the spark does not require the presence of electrical (or 
any other) energy, and is not affected by dampness or other atmospheric conditions.  If the caster 
is 6th level or higher, the cantrip will produce 2-5 sparks in the same spot, in rapid succession.


Level 1:


Bigby's Bookworm Bane (Evocation)
   LEVEL: 1					SOURCE: GHA

enemies of the mage:  the bookworm.  When cast, the spell creates a disembodied hand that will 
search through 100 books or scrolls per round, seeking out bookworms with a 95% chance of 
detection.  Once a worm is found, the hand will pursue the bookworm relentlessly, attacking with 
the skill of a fighter equal in level to the caster.  A successful hit by the hand means that the 
bookworm is instantly crushed to death.  The hand possesses a strength of 8, so it can move aside 
books and scrolls in pursuit of the fleeing bookworm.  The hand is incapable of performing any 
other functions ot combatting any other foe.  Bigby uses the spell periodically to safeguard his 
valuable library.  The material component is a child-sized glove made of tough leather.


Bigby's Feeling Fingers
   LEVEL: 1					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 20'					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 1 hr + 1 TN/LVL			Casting Time: 1 SEG
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell calls into existence a disembodied hand under the caster's 
command.  The hand cannot hold, grasp, or carry, but it does have an amazingly sensitive sence of 
touch.  The hand's sense of touch is so fine that it can note miniscule cracks, seperations, or 
openings in a surface, and thus detect the presence of a secret or concealed door with a 50% 
chance of success.  The hand con search a 10 foot by 10 foot area each turn.  The hand connot be 
destroyed by physical attacks, but it can be dispelled if dealt four or more points of magical 
damage. The hand can trip a nonmagical trap if the location of the trap is known.  The material 
components for the spell are a child-sized silk glove and a swan's feather.


Drawmij's Beast of Burden (Alteration)
   LEVEL: 1					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 30'					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 2 hrs/LVL				Casting Time: 1 MR
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell partially lightens goods placed upon a single mount.  The 
effective encumbrance of all objects on the mount, including riders, is reduced by one-half, in 
effect doubling the amount of weight the mount can carry.  A mount that suddenly finds itself 
carrying one and one-half its maximum load without the spells protection cannot walk, slowly 
sinks to the ground, and stands a 50% chance of going lame.  A mount suddenly burdened by twice 
its maximum load collapes to the ground, suffering 1d6 points of damage and automatically goes 
lame.  The material components are a lodestone and pinch of metal filings.


Drawmij's Light Step (Alteration)
   LEVEL: 1					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: Touch					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 5 MRs/LVL				Casting Time: 1 SEG
   Area of Effect: One creature			Saving Throw: None

Explantion/Description:  This spell gives a creature a very limited form of levitation.  The 
creature walks normally over any surface, but walks so lightly that no tracks are left behind.  If 
the creature breaks into a charge or run the spell ends immediately.  The creature can also move 
across a fluid as well as a solid surface, but the movement rate is reduced to one-half the 
creatures normal walking rate, as the creature must step carefully.  The light step spell will not 
enable a creature to walk across turbulent water or ocean waves, however, since the chaotic motion 
of the fluid disturbs the levitation field.  The spell actually makes the creature unable to activate 
pit traps.  It doesn't allow the creature to leap higher or jump safely from a cliff, only to walk 
with a lighter step.  This spell will also increase the creature by 50% for the duration of the 
spell.  The material components are a bit of fur taken from a cat's paw and a ducks feather.


Flare
   LEVEL:  1				SOURCE:  Dragon #123
   Range:  0				Components:  V,S
   Duration:  1 SEG			Casting Time:  1 SEG
   Area of Effect:  Special		Saving Throw:  None

streak of intense light that shoots straight up into the air from the caster's index finger and remains 
visible for one full SEG  It is equally visible in daylight or darkness, and can be seen from as far as five 
miles, plus one mile per LVL of experience the caster has attained.  A FLARE may be used to indicate the 
position of the mage and his party, or it may be used to transmit simple messages.  Since the flare's 
color is controlled by the caster, a simple code may be devised for signaling between an army and its 
scouting parties.  For instance a red FLARE might indicate that an enemy is near, a yellow might mean 
that the enemy is retreating, etc.


Mordenkainen's Protection from Avians (Abjuration)
   LEVEL: 1					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: Touch					Components: V,S,M

of the spell.  The material component is a feather from any bird wrapped with a strip of tough 
leather.

brightness of a light spell to the dim glow of a candle.  The werelight can flit about from place to 
place as the caster directs, as long as it stays within the range of the spell.  The werelight could 
be called upon to hang over the caster's head as a convenient reading light. The werelight spell 
cannot be attached to an object or creature.  It can only exist as a mote hanging in the air. The 
material component is a live firefly.

Those who make their saving throw are merely dazed for 1d4 rounds, suffering a -2 penalty on all

Explanation/Description:  This spell summons into the caster's hand a small crystalline sphere 
filled with gray, hazy mass.  The smoke sphere can be thrown as far as 60 feet away from the 
caster as a grenade-like missile.  The sphere shatters when it hits, filling an area 10 feet in 
radius with harsh, irritating smoke.  Unless a save verses poison is made, all creatures within the 
area of effect will suffer a fit of coughing, gasping, and choking for 1d4 + 1 rounds. The affected 
creatures attack and make saving throws with a -2 penalty until the fit passes, and any spell with 
a verbal component has a 30% chance of failure when cast by a coughing spellcaster.  The smoke 
cloud disperses and becomes harmless after one round.  The sphere must be used within three 
rounds of casting or the substance becomes inert and useless, and the crystal sphere

would negate (no saving throws allowed) any SILENCE cast on him or about his person, and prevent such 
SILENCE from occurring or returning for twelve consecutive MRs after casting.  DISPEL MAGIC will in 
turn destroy a DISPEL SILENCE dweomer, but SILENCE will not return unless cast anew, or if of a

in the mage's hand for one round, building up power. The caster can do nothing else during this

a battering ram with a clenched fist as the ram's head.  The force assumes a cylindrical shape 12 
feet long by 2 feet in diameter, but the caster can shorten its length to 3 feet in order to fit in a

one hit, a reinforced door with three hits, a stone door with five hits, and has a 50% chance to 
destroy a metal door (the spell is destroyed in the gauntlet fails).  Only one attack can be made 
per round, as with any ordinary battering ram. Used against a smaller physical obstruction, such 
as a dungeon door or metal grate reinforced with magic, a saving throw is made for the door at the 
level of the mage who cast the reinforcing spell on the door.  If the save is successful, the gauntlet 
spell is destroyed.  If the save fails, the gauntlet spell begins working on the door. Against a 
living target, the ram has no effect.  The caster must always remain within 60 feet of the ram or it 
will disipate.  The ram cannot be damaged by physical attacks, but it can be destroyed by magical 
damage if it suffers one-half of the number of hit points of the caster.  Dispel magic or

darkenbeasts.  The animals to be transformed must all be within a 20-foot-diameter circle.  The spell

round (usually at the rate of one creature or person per segment) can enther into a zone of nil-
space by passing through the doorway. When the door is closed behind the mage, the mage and all 
those with him in the nil-space zone are teleported to a random location within 250 yards of the 
door.  If the door is not closed before the end of the spell's duration, then the door slams shut 
automatically at the end of the round.  The door disappears when closed by the mage or after it 
shuts itself.  The party has no control over where they will be teleported, and there is a 5% 
chance that the spell will malfunction and dump the party into the ethereal plane.  To determine 
where the mage and his friends are sent, consult the DM map, track back along the path of the 
party, and place them in a random area where they have been before.  This spell cannot send the 
party into an unknown territory.  The material component is a miniture silver door decorated with

colored vapors shoots upward, and from behind this screen of clashing, misty smoke steps an ogre-like

Nchaser's Glowing Globe

   Range:  Touch			Compenents:  V,S,M
   Duration:  Permanent			Casting Time:  4 SEGs
   Area of Effect:  Special		Saving Throw:  None

By the use of this spell the caster creates an effect identical to a CONTINUAL LIGHT spell centered 
within a transparent object, but with the brightness of the light under the caster's mental control.  
Continuous control need not be maintained;  the caster can merely exert concentration to change the 
current luminosity of the globe, and it will continue to emit the desired amount of light until a new 
mental command is received (unless, of course, it should be destroyed).  Mental control may be 
maintained over a globe from a distance of 9" per LVL of the caster (plus 4" per point of intelligence 
over 15).  Control of a globe cannot be wrested from another except by means of a WISH or LIMITED 
WISH or upon the death of the owner, whereupon the expectant owner must touch the globe to take 
mastery over it.

   Range: 10'/LVL				Components: V,S,M

Material Plane for an instant.  Those within the area of effect seffer 1d4 points of damage per 
level of the caster, or only one half damage is a save vs. death magic is successful.  Affected 
creatures who fail their save will also be slowed (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds.  Creature from the 
Positive Material Plane or upper outer planes take an additional point of damage per level of the 
caster, and the saving throw is made at -2. Such creatures who fail their save will also be stunned 
for 1d4 rounds, rather than slowed.  There is always a 10% chance that the mage will lose control 
of the spell and be affected by its attack, as a ray from the area of effect bounces back to strike 
the caster.  Undead are never affected by the spell.  The material component is a bit of earth taken 
from the grave of a ghoul or ghast.


Nystul's Grue Conjuration (Counjuration/Summoning)
   LEVEL: 4					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 60'					Components: V,S,M

   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell, which is actually a group of four risky spells, will summon 
one grue - harginn, ildriss, chaggrin, or varrdig - from one of the four elemental planes:

   Air		Incense
   Earth	Soft Clay
   Fire		Sulfur
   Water	Sea Water

These material components must be used when summoning the grue desired.  The type of grue to 
be summoned must be decided before the caster memorizes the spell.  Grue are notoriously 
untrustworthy and difficult to control, so the caster must rely on more than just concentration to 
keep the grue under his command.  As soon as the grue is summoned, it will demand a payment 
from the caster for its service.  The payment offered must be at least 500 g.p. worth of goods of 
interest to the grue, or the grue will be angered and immediately attack the caster.  If the grue is 
satisfied with the offer, it will grudgingly perform one service for the caster for the duration of 
the spell.  The grue will try to subvert or openly disobey the caster's orders if the grue finds 
them unpleasant.

saving throw.  Creatures without eyes cannot be blinded.  In addition, all undead, creatures from 
the Negitive Material Plane, or beings from the lower outer planes within the area of effect take 
1d6 points of damage per level of the caster.  Such creatures suffer only half damage if they make 
their saving throw, but all undead make their save at -2.  The material component is a small, solid 
gold orb worth 500 g.p., it is destroyed after the spell dissipates.

   Range:  60'					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 MR/2 LVLs			Casting Time:  4 SEG
   Area of Effect:  30' rad globe		Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a small crystalline sphere filled with hot steam in 
the caster's hand.  The mist within the sphere will remain active for three rounds.  The sphere can 
be hurled up to 60 yards away from the caster.  When the sphere hits a solid surface, it instantly 
shatters, freeing the contents and filling an area 30 feet in radius with thick steam.  It does 4d4 
points of heat damage per round of exposure to the steam, with no save permitted.  The steam 
totally obscures vision, reducing visibility to only 30 feet in front of an affect creature.  
Creatures within the area of effect of the steam bath will also be disoriented, making it difficult 
for creatures to find their way out of the steam bath.  Each round a creature is within the steam 
cloud, the creature must make a save versus spells to escape from the cloud.  A creature who saves 
will emerge from the steam bath in a random direction; Imagine a clock face and roll 1d12 to find 
the direction in which the creature escapes.  If the saving throw is failed, the creature stumbles 
around in the steam bath for another round.  The material components are a few drops of pure 
water, a pinch of dust, and a bit of sulfur.

Explanation/Description:  This spell will create the sound of oppressively loud war drums in a 
large area, filling all creatures in the area of effect with feelings of dread and despair.  The spell 
will cover an area at the direction of the caster, so a 10th-level mage could affect an area 200 feet 
by 20 feet, 100 feet by 40 feet, or 50 feet by 80 feet.  All affected creatures will be -2 on all 
attack, damage, and saving throws, and will suffer a -2 morale penalty.  Creatures of 2 hit dice or 
less are not entitled to a saving throw to avoid the enchantment. Creatures of 2+1 to 4 hit dice 
make their save at -2, and creatures of 4+1 hit dice and higher roll an unmodified save.  The 
material components are a pair of miniature bronze drums with onyx decorations, worth 1,000 gp 
in materials and workmanship, that vanish after the spell is cast.
The reverse of the spell, `Otto's rousing anthem', produces a loud trumpet call that raises the 
spirits of all allied creatures in the same-sized area of effect.  All affected creatures will be +1 
on attack and saving throws, and NPCs will receive a two-point bonus on morale checks.  The 
material component for the anthem is a set of four miniature silver trumpets trimmed with lapis 
lazuli, worth a total of 5,000 gp, which canish after the spell is cast.

   Duration:  2 MRs/LVL			Casting Time:  4 segments
   Area of Effect:  The mage		Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  When this spell is cast, the mage's voice takes on an enthralling sing-
song tone that instantly catches the ear of any listener.  Anything said by the caster will sound 
very convincing, as if the mage had a 19 charisma (+40% reaction adjustment).  Any half-truth 
spoken by the caster has a 75% chance of sneaking past the notice of a listener using a `detect lie' 
spell and an outright lie has a 50% chance of not being discovered by `detect lie'.

knowledge of how to cast spells unless a saving throw is made.  Clerics and druids make their

effectiveness, as if the spell were cast by a character two experience levels lower for figuring 
spell range, area of effect, duration, or damage.  The material components are a sitar string and a 
crystal mallet (1,000 gp), which vanish after the spell is cast.

instrument.

   Range:  60'					Components:  V,S
   Duration:  Special				Casting Time:  1 MR
   Area of Effect:  One creature		Saving Throw:  Neg.

Explanation/Description:  This more powerful version of the `forget' spell allows the mage to 
actively alter a part of a creature's memory.  The portion of memory the caster can affect is 
limited to one specific event in the creature's life.  The memory of a real event can be altered as 
the caster wishes.  The mage could replace real facts about the event with false ones, or even place 
a completely new memory into the creature's mind, causing the creature to remember an event that 
never happened. The caster, however, is unable to remove a memory of an event in its entirety.  
There is no time limit on how far into the past an event can be altered.  The creature is entitled to 
a save versus spells to avoid having his memory changed.  A heal, restoration, or wish will correct 
any alterations made to a creature's memory.

study (allow save vs. spells), and all beginning with the fifth round.  The caster may learn of a 
creature's dreams, supressed memories, or primal desires.  One major fact or subject can be 
learned or studied per round of deep probing.  The limits on which topics can be probed are the 
same as for the ESP spell.

a -2 penalty to all saving throws made against the spell.


SPENDELARDE'S CHASER

   Range:  Touch			Components:  V, S, M
   Duration:  1 TN/LVL			Casting Time:  8 SEGs
   Area of Effect:  One creature	Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell negates the adverse effects of all drugs (including alcohol) in the 
recipient creature.  Dexterity and mental impairments are instantly "cured", leaving the recipient 
clear-headed and free of pain, able to undertake complex tasks requiring intense concentration, such as 
spellcasting.  The pain of even mortal wounds will be removed, although the Chase in no way heals any 
damage extant in mind or body.  If the condition has not righted itself by the time the spell wears off, 
its effects will return.  But, natural body processes continue while a creature is under the influence of 
the CHASER, so that a hangover or other temporary discomfort may well vanish before the spell 
expires.  The CHASER will have no effect on insanity or magical conditions (such as FEEBLEMIND), but 
does give a +4 saving throw versus any poisons present in the recipient at any time when the spell is in 
effect.  (If a saving throw versus the poison has already been failed, application of the CHASER will 
permit a second, unmodified saving throw:  it will not be at a +4 bonus, but will not have any 
subtractions, either. ) The material component of this spell is a drop of holy water, touched to the 
tongue or skin of the recipient (the spell may be cast on oneself).


Tenser's Giant Strength (Alteration)

	13th					  18/75
	14th					  18/90
	15th					  18/00
	16th +				     19

Those with strength already greater than the spell's effect get one more point of strength.  Neither 
permanency nor a wish can make the strength permanent.  The material component is a bit of hair 
from a giant or a titan.


Tenser's Flaming Blade (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  4					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  2"					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  3 MRs + 1 MR/LVL			Casting Time:  4 SEG
   Area of Effect:  One dagger			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell will endow a dagger with the power of flame or frost, as 
chosen by the caster.  Each power has an effect as described below.

Flame:  The blade ignites like a torch, casting light in a 30-foot radius.  The flame will ignite any 
combustibles which the blade contacts.  The blade gains no magical bonuses, but will inflict an 
additional point of damage in melee.  The blade does three additional points of damage against a 
cold-based creature, so a flaming dagger will inflict 1d4+3 damage to a yeti.
Frost:  The blade glows with a cold blue aura that sheds light in a 10-foot radius.  The blade has 
no magical bonus, but will do one extra point of damage against a fire-based creature, such as a 
salamander or fire grue.  The blade can also freeze up to one cubic foot of water per round when 
the blade is in contact with water.This spell will have no effect on a weapon that already has a 
flame or frost capability.
The material component for the spell is phosphorous to produce a flame blade or quartz crystla to 
create a frost blade.


Tenser's Master of Arms (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  4					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  Touch				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 TN/LVL				Casting Time:  4 SEG
   Area of Effect:  Fighter touched 		Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell, when bestowed upon a fighter, improves the fighter's skill 
with one melee weapon.  A weapon with which the fighter is not proficient becomes a weapon of 
proficiency in the character's hands.  A weapon of proficiency is treated as a weapon of 
specialization.  There is no double weapon specialization allowed with the spell effect.  The spell 
will only affect fighters and fighter sub-class characters.  The material component for master of 
arms is a feather from a crane.


Tenser's Running Warrior (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  4					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  60'					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 TN/LVL				Casting Time:  4 segments
   Area of Effect:  One person			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell will improve a person's ability in a running battle.  First, 
the person is granted a movement rate of 150 yards, regardless of the encumbrance of armor or 
goods carried by the character.  Second, no matter how far the person moves during a melee 
rounds, the person is still entitled to the same number of melee attacks as he or she normally 
receives.  If the character was entitled to 2/1 attacks per round, the fighter could now move 60 
yards, attack one foe, move another 90 yards and attack a second creature.  The material 
component is a bit of fur from a live wolf.
 

Tenser's Staff of Smiting (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  4					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  0					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  2 MRs/LVL				Casting Time:  4 SEG
   Area of Effect:  The mage's staff		Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell increases the effectiveness of the caster's staff when used in 
melee.  The spell will work only on non-magical staves.  The spell adds a +1 bonus to hit and a +4 
on damage rolls. The material component is a small iron bar.


THUNDERLANCE
   LEVEL:  4					SOURCE:  Dragon, Dec 1985, p. 35
   Range:  Touch				Compenents:  V, S
   Duration:  See Below				Casting Time:  4 SEGs
   Area of Effect:  One creature		Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  Casting this spell brings into being a thin shaft of faint grey, shimmering 
force extending 2" from the caster's pointing finger.  This "lance" is weightless and intangible, but if 
any creature touches or passes through any part of it, the lance vanishes with a loud clap of thunder, 
and the creature struck is dealt 4-24 hit points of damage.  The lance may be willed out of existence by 
its caster at any time without and discharge or harm to the caster (although the spell is lost and 
disappears in any event if the caster dies, loses consciousness, or begins to cast another spell).  The 
caster can employ the THUNDERLANCE in many ways -- held steady as a barrier against some 
creature's passage or as a tripwire at ankle height to stop a pursuer.  It is also highly effective when 
wielded as a weapon;  the caster can move his arm and finger about to strike with the lance.  In any 
combat situation against a THUNDERLANCE, potential victims are regarded as having a base armor class 
of 10 (before any dexterity adjustments), the blow of the lance is transmitted through armor and 
shields, and the presence of such protection does not benefit the target of a THUNDERLANCE attack.  
However, the bonuses of magic armor are not negated, and will improve a target's effective AC by the 
amount of the bonus.
  The damage of the lance is a physical blow, as opposed to (for instance) a discharge of electricity.  It 
is fully effective against creatures that are resistant or immune to either blunt weapons or edged 
weapons (since the lance is actually neither of those).
  The touch of a THUNDERLANCE destroys a SHIELD spell, a WALL OF FORCE, or MINOR GLOBE OF 
INVULNERABILITY, but the lance itself discharges (vanishes, without damaging anyone) upon such 
contact.  Stronger protective spells (such as ANTI-MAGIC shell) will also cause the lance to discharge, 
but will themselves withstand the shock of its strike and remain in existence.  A lance penetrates fire, 
water (including ice and snow), and electical discharges of natural or magical (e. g. , WALL OF FIRE, 
WALL OF ICE) origin without discharging, and thus the caster may strike through such phenomena at an 
enemy.
  Any wielding a THUNDERLANCE (i.e., spellcasting is complete, but the lance has not yet discharged) 
cannot be harmed by MAGIC MISSILE spells, regardless of what direction this strike from -- their force 
passes harmlessly through the lance wielder to be absorbed by the lance, increasing the damage it does 
(by 2-5 hp per missile) when it discharges.  This will not occur if the lance wielder has some other 
magical protection against MAGIC MISSILEs.  A lance does not confer any protection against other 
forms of magical attack, nor can it be passed to any other creature without discharging it --- an ally of 
the caster cannot wield the lance on the caster's behalf.


Torture
   LEVEL:  4					SOURCE:  Undead suppliment (RA)
   Range:  25 ft. + 5 ft./LVL			Compenents:  V, S, M
   Duration:  1 MR/2 LVLs			Casting Time:  1 SEG
   Area of Effect:  1 Person			Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  By using this spell, the caster can physically cause wounds of TORTURE.  This 
spell only works on one man-sized or smaller humanoid per casting.    Each MR the victim takes 1D8 
points of damage, half damage if the character saves vs.  Spells.  If the victim fails to save, the quick, 
sharp and unexpected pains will make it necessary for him to save vs.  his constitution.  If he fails this 
save, the victim has a -5 to hit and damage.  The save vs.  constitution must be made every MR the 
spell is in effect.  Any time a character takes over half of his hit points in cummulative damage while 
the spell is in effect, he will offer to surrender, or attempt to flee if the surrender is not accepted.    
The material component is a knife, which is used to make a small cut on the thumb tip of the caster.  
Concentration is not required to continue the spell after the first round.


Tulrun's Tracer
   LEVEL:  4					SOURCE:  FRA
   Range:  1"					Compenents:  V, S, M
   Duration:  4 MRs/LVL				Casting Time:  8 SEGs
   Area of Effect:  Special			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  When this spell is cast, the TRACER - a continuous, luminescent pathway akin 
to a LIGHT spell - comes into being within a 1" radius of the caster.  It shows the most recent path of 
any single creature whose path the caster wishes to trace, described verbally by the caster over the 
material component (a pinch of phosphorus or a glowing life-form such as a fungus or glowworm).  The 
creature must have been present in the 1" radius area about the caster within a period of 1 day per LVL 
of the caster for the TRACER to appear.  The TRACER will show the route of the creature within the 1" 
area, and then expand (at a rate of 60"/rnd) along the route taken by the creature, moving in that 
direction for the duration of the spell.  Once beyond the 1" initial radius, it will only show the path of 
the creature - who need not have been seen by, or be known to, the spellcaster - as long as it remains 
in physical contact with the gMR.  PASS WITHOUT TRACE and similar magics will not confuse the 
TRACER, and it will follow the creature's route through physical barriers (i.e. doors) and across gaps 
(i.e. the results of a JUMP or DIMENSION DOOR, or purely physical acrobatics) of up to 14".  It will not 
otherwise show aerial travel, but will shine in and under water.    The path will end when the target 
creature is reached, when the spell expires, or at any place to which the target creature TELEPORTed, 
left the plane of the caster, or embarked upon a mount or conveyance such as a cart, ship, or Carpet of 
Flying.  In the latter case, an individual reaching the path's end will receive a clear mental picture of 
the destination travelled to, even if on another plane.  If the target creature took a mount or 
conveyance, the mental picture will be of the act of doing so and not of the destination reached.  
Portions of the TRACER can be negated by DISPEL MAGIC, CONTINUAL DARKNESS, and the like, but it 
cannot be physically disturbed (i.e. a GUST OF WIND would not shift it).  When the spell expires, the 
TRACER will have slowly faded into nothingness;  no one not having reached its end will receive any 
mental picture of the target's destination.  The TRACER is intangible and cannot be walked upon.  It may 
be passed through or travelled within without harm and does not activate magic upon contact or distort 
magic or physical phenomena passing through it.



Level 5   Mage Spells



Ballant's Stonestrength (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  Dragon #145
   Range:  20'					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  3 TNs + 2 TNs/LVL			Casting Time:  6 SEG
   Area of Effect:  Special			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  Ballant's stonestrength causes any single stone structure, no matter 
what its size, to increase in structural value by 10% per level of the spell-caster.  For example, a 
13th level mage casting this spell on his stone gatehouse increases its structural value by 130%, 
from 120 to 276.  The stone becomes tougher and more resistant to chipping and cracking.  Any 
damage done to it is first subtracted from its magically gained structural points (so even if 
greatly battered, it may escape uninjured at the spell's expiration). Since the spell affects only 
stone, it cannot fully buttress a structure composed of both stone and, say, earth or wood.  A DM 
may either figure out how each piece of strengthened stone affects the structure as a while, or 
simply figure the new structural value as a percentage (e.g., if a wall is 40% stone, the spell is 
40% effective).   Ballant's stonestrength completely repairs any stone-composed creature (e.g., 
stone golem, xorn, galeb duhr) it is cast upon, though this vigor is limited to the spell's duration.  
When cast upon a petrified character (having suffered the effects of a medusa or `flesh to stone' 
spell), this spell provides virtual immunity to incidental chipping and breaking.  It may be cast 
in conjunction with a `wall of stone'. The material components of this spell are a small granite 
wedge and a pinch of powdered iron, which is sprinkled over the wedge during the spell's casting.  
When the spell is cast, both components disappear.


Bigby's Fantastic Fencers (Evocation)
   LEVEL: 5					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 60'					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 1 MR/LVL				Casting Time: 1 SEG
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates one hand for every three levels of the caster, each of 
which holds a long sword.  Each hand fights with the skill of a fighter of one-half the experinence 
level of the caster.  Each hand has an AC of 2 because of its small size and speed, and each can 
sustain 15 points of damage before being dispelled.  Each fencer is capable of disarming an 
opponenet and does so on a roll four greater than the roll needed to hit.  A fencer likewise 
disarmed is despelled automatically.  The caster need not concentrate on the fencers to keep them 
functioning, but only hos to give them orders as if they were henchmen.  The material component 
is a small, silver amulet shaped like a mailed gauntlet holding a gem-encrusted sword, worth at 
least 1,000 g.p. (this vanishes when the spell is cast).


Bigby's Superior Force Sculpture (Evocation)
   LEVEL: 5					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 30'					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 3 TN + 1 TN/LVL			Casting Time: 1 MR
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell is a more advanced form of the 4th level force sculputure 
spell.  THe object or objects formed from the force can be more complex, composed of large, moving 
parts, or have an edge or point, but still must be fairly rigid.  A wagon, quiver of quarrels, shovel, 
sword, or water wheel could all be simulated, but not a mechanical timepiece, crossbow, or spring.  
Fine details can be worked into an object, provided that the caster has kill as an artisan or 
sculptor.  Fine details take 2d4 rounds to place on an object, but remain for the duration of the 
spell.  Up to 8 cubic feet of matter per level of the caster can be simulated.  The duration of the 
spell is also longer than force sculpture.  Superior force sculpture is otherwise identical to the 
4th level spell.  The material component is a lump of clay with diamond dust mixed into it.


Bigby's Strangling Grip (Evocation)
   LEVEL: 5					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 10'/LVL				Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 2 MRs				Casting Time: 5 SEG
   Area of Effect: One creature			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a pair of disembodied hands that will seek out a 
creature's throat and strangle the creature with the same effect as an attack with a garrote.  The 
hands must make a successful attack roll to grab the creature's throat, attacking with a +4 to hit 
on the mage's usual attack roll, because of the speed and ferocity of the attack.  The strangling 
grip will strangle its victim to death by the end of the next round unless the creature is freed of 
the hands.  The victim can break the grip if he makes a successful roll to bend bars.  THe grip can 
also be released if the mage's concentration is broken. The limits on which creatures can be 
affected by the spell are the same as the restrictions on the use of a normal garrote.  The material 
components are a pair of gloves sewn into a clutching grip around the neck of a bottle.


Bubka's Superior Identification (Diviniation)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  City of Greyhawk
   Range:  0					Components:  V, S, M
   Duration:  1 MR/LVL				Casting time:  5 MRs
   Area of Effect:  1 item			Saving throw:  Special

Explantion/Description:  When this spell is cast, one item may be examined by the mage so that he may 
identify the nature of the enchantment.  The item need only be hand-held or touched, not worn or used in 
any way.  The following information can be obtained:
   (1) One basic magical property of the item (or the fact that it is not magical) is always revealed to 
the mage.  This takes 1 MR.
   (2) There is a chance that a second magical property will be revealed.  The mage will know in 1d4 
MRs if there is a second such
property, and will need a further 1d3 MRs to identify the nature of this enchantment.  The chance for 
successfully identifying a second magical property is (LVL + INT) x 3 (90% in Bubka's case), to a 
maximum of 95%.  Failing this check indicates that, as far as the mage can determine, the item does 
not possess or contain any additional enchantments.
   The spell may be repeatedly cast on the same item to inquire about third and subsequent magical 
properties (if there are any), with the same [(LVL + INT) x 3] chance for success.  However, attempts 
to confirm earlier detections will always reveal the same result (even if that finding was in error).
   Exact properties are revealed by this spell, such as the fact that a weapon is a sword +1.  (If the 
weapon was also of the "flame tongue" variety, this could be discovered as a second property. ) In the 
case of charged items, the number of charges is treated as a second property and, if the mage makes 
the [(LVL + INT) x 3] roll, there is still a 25% chance that the number of charges is overestimated or 
underestimated by 2d10% (equal chance for over or under, but the number estimated will never be less 
than 1, or more than the number of charges possible).
   Unlike the first LVL IDENTIFY spell, casting of this magic does not subject the mage to a loss of 
Constitution.  However, the spell cannot be cast more than once every two hours due to the intense 
concentration it demands, or else the mage repeating the spell will at once suffer a severe headache 
lasting 1d4 hours and be unable to memorize spells for a further 12 hours after the headache subsides.  
The material components for the spell are the same as for the IDENTIFY spell, except that the pearl 
must be of high quality (at least 250 gp value).


Drawmij's Flying Feat (Alteration/Enchantment)
   LEVEL: 5					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 10'					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 3 TNs/LVL				Casting Time: 1 MR
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This special flying spell is not cast unpon a creature but an object.  
The enchanted object gains the power to fly up to 180 feet per round under the caster's direction.  
A broom, chair, table, carpet, wagon, or hut could be made capable of flight.  The mage can affect 
up to 500 g.p. weight per level of the caster, and the object can carry twice that amount of weight 
in passengers or freight if the object is large enough and sufficiently strong to support the weight 
under normal circumstances.  An 18th level mage could lift a 9,000 g.p. weight in passengers and 
up to 18,000 g.p. weight in cargo, for example.  The caster must concentrate upon the flying object 
to direct its motion and maintain its flight.  If the caster is knocked unconscious, stunned or 
slain while directing the flying object, the object will immediately begin to plummet earthword as 
a falling object.  The material component is a wing feather taken from a roc.


Hold Vapor
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  FR4 The Magister (p. 5)
   Range:  1"/LVL				Components:  V, S, M
   Duration:  Special				Casting Time:  5 SEGs
   Area of effect:  2" + 1"/LVL  radius globe 	Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  This spell allows a magic-user to halt or prevent the movement of any visible 
cloud(s) or vapor in a given area distinct from the air aMR, such as a breath weapon, pyrotechnics, fog 
cloud, cloudkill, or incendiary cloud.  Such enforced immobility may be continued for as long as the 
caster continues to chant and concentrate on holding the vapor.  If such a hold is ever lost (through the 
caster being silienced for an entire MR -- the chant can be interrupted for short periods -- or rendered 
unconscious, or ceasing concentration to cast another spell) it can never be regained except by use of 
another spell;  the hold is broken and the magic expires.  The hold prevents the gas cloud(s) from 
altering shape, breaking up, or moving about in any way.  Oxygen (i.e. the "air") may pass freely 
through and about such vapor, dissipating it if its formative magic expires, and allowing, for example, 
a flammable vapor to burn or explode if it is held by a hold vapor and attacked with fire.     The hold is 
absolute, even in the face of natural gales or magical gusts of wind (unless these affect the chanting 
mage, not the vapor, enough to break the hold, as described above).  If the gaseous form is that of an 
intelligent creature who is normally in control of personal movement, such as a wind walking cleric or 
a vampire in gaseous form, the affected creature receives saving throws as follows:  The hold is 
absolute in the first MR of its existence, a saving throw versus spell at -6 is allowed on the second 
MR, at -5 on the third MR, and so on up to a maximum of +6 on the 14th MR and any MRs thereafter.  If 
such a saving throw is successful, the spell ends instantly and the creature is free to move.  Until the 
spell is broken, a gaseous-form creature cannot move, nor can it change to a non-gaseous form even if 
it normally has the ability to do so.  Note the spectral, etheral, and insubstantial forms (such as those 
of many undead) that are not gaseous cannot be affected by this spell.  This spell cannot be used to push 
or direct a vapor, or control it in any way, but only to halt and hold it.     The material component of 
ths spell is a balloon or bladder into which the caster blows.


Mordenkainen's Faithful Phantom Defenders (Summoning)
   LEVEL: 5					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 60'					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 1 MR/LVL				Casting Time: 5 SEG
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell summons a set of phantom beings seen as shimmering 
outlines of violet light. The defenders do their best to keep between the mage and his adversaries, 
providing the caster with enough time and space to defend himself with spells.  To most creatures 
the phantom defenders are solid, seemingly real entities.  To the mage, the defenders are 
completely transparent and noncorporeal, so any attack spell cast by the mage has no effect on the 
defenders.  The mage's spells can be cast through the defenders to strike enemy creatures.  If the 
defenders are caught within the area of effect of the caster's spell, the defenders suffer no harm.  
One of four sets of phantom defenders can be summoned by the mage, but the caster must decide 
which set will be called forth when the spell is memorized.  Each set is best suited for a 
particular environment.  The four sets are:

Three faithful phantom soldiers:  AC 4 (phantom chain-mail and shield);  Move 9"; HD 4; hp 24; 
#AT 1; Dmg 1d8 (phantom long sword); THAC0 15; AL N; SA able to hit creatures which are hit 
only by +1 magical weapons.

Two faithful phantom centaurs:  AC 5; Move 18"; HD 4; hp 28; #AT 1; Dmg 1d6 (phantom light 
lance); THAC0 15; AL N; SA able to hit creatures which are hit by +2 weapons.

Eight faithful phantom giant bats:  AC 8; Move 3"/18"; HD 2+2; hp 12; #AT 1; Dmg 1d4; THAC0 16; 
AL N; SA able to hit creature hit only by +3 or better weapons.

Five faithful phantom sharks:  AC 6; Move 24"; HD 3; hp 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1d4+1; THAC0 16; AL N; 
SA able to hit creature hit only by +1 weapons.

The material component is a small lead crystal figure depicting the type of defender to be 
summoned and a 1,000 g.p. emerald for each creature summoned.  The emerald vanish when the 
spell is cast.

Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum (Alteration-Abjuration)
   LEVEL: 5					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 0					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 1 hr/LVL				Casting Time: 2 TNs
   Area of Effect: One room			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell is used to insure privacy in a room of up to 1,600 square 
feet in area.  All windows in the room become dark and misty as seen from outside, preventing 
creatures with normal vison, infravision, or other special vison from looking into the room.  Those 
inside can still look out normally.  X-ray vision will note be able to penetrate into the room, as if 
the room were completely enclosed in a lead shield.  No sound, no matter how loud, can escape the 
room, so a thief cannot eavesdrop from outside.  Scrying attempts, such as ESP, claraudience, 
clairvoyance, or crystal balls, cannot penetrate the protected room, and a wizard eye cannot get 
inside.  THe mage can freely leave the room without the protection being dispelled.  The material 
components are a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered 
chrysolite.

Nystul's Enveloping Darkness (Evocation-Alteration) Reversible
   LEVEL: 5					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 0					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 5 MRs + 2 MRs/LVL			Casting Time: 5 SEG
   Area of Effect: 20' rad globe		Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a zone of impenetrable darkness around the mage 20' 
in radius. Although the caster can see in and through the zone of darkness without trouble, all 
others cannot see through the envelope, not even with infravision or ultravison.  In addition, a 
distortion exists within the globe, appearing as if the caster has the power of displacement as a 
displacer beast.  The caster is attacked at -2, in addition to the darkness penalty.
Nystul's Instant Daylight will negate the spell.  The material components are a drop of pitch, a 
whisker from a black cat, and a bit of fur from the coat of a displacer beast.

Nystul's Radiant Arch (Alteration)
   LEVEL: 5					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 10'/LVL				Components: V,S,M
   Duration: Special				Casting Time: 1 MR
   Area of Effect: One creature			Saving Throw: 1/2

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a glimmering rainbow of light that arches bewteen 
the caster's open hands.  Once the rainbow takes form, the caster can choose to fire a ray 1 foot 
wide from the rainbow, aimed at one creature up to 10 feet away per level of the mage.  The ray can 
take the form of one of the seven colors of energy drawn from the quasi-elemental plane of 
radiance.

   Red:		cold energy (+1 damage to fire-based creatures, no damage if cold-based)
   Orange:	heat energy (+1 damage to cold-based creatures, no damage if fire-based)
   Yellow:	acid damage (save vs. spell to take no damage)
   Green:	neutral poison (per cleric spell)
   Blue:	electrical energy (+10 damage to metal armored enemy)
   Indigo:	undead specific (only undead harmed)
   Violet:	vegatation specific (only plants harmed)

The ray will inflict 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, of a type corresponding to the 
color of the ray.  If the creature make its save, only half damage is suffered. The mage must 
concentrate to keep the radiant arch active, so any attack that breaks the caster's concentration 
will dispel the rainbow and prevent the caster from lauching a ray.  The material components are 
a crystal prism (which breaks after the spell) and a small black board with a pinhole through the 
center.


Otiluke's Dispelling Screen (Evocation-Alteration)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  5'/LVL				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 MR/LVL				Casting Time:  5 SEG
   Area of Effect:  20' square			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a shimmering screen of violet energy. As with other 
such screens, the dispelling screen can be shaped as the caster wishes.  Any creature passing 
through the screen is affected by `dispel magic' with the same level of effectiveness as that spell 
cast by the mage, and is affected by `dispel illusion' as if cast by a mage two levels of experience 
lower than the caster.  Thus, creatures possessing some form of enchantment who passe through 
the dispelling screen often come out weaker than when they started.  The material components are 
a sheet of fine lead crystal and a chysolite gemstone worth 1,000 gp, which vanish after the spell 
is cast.


Otiluke's Electrical Screen (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  5'/LVL				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  5 MRs/LVL				Casting Time:  5 SEG
   Area of Effect:  20' sq/LVL			Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a shimmering screen of electrical energy that can be 
shaped into a wall, hemisphere, or sphere, with a 20-foot diameter, as the caster wishes.  It is 
always immovable.  Any creature passing through the electrical screen will suffer a strong shock.  
Unless the creature makes it save, it will suffer 1d4 points of damage, lose any dexterity bonuses 
for 1d4+1 rounds due to numbness, and suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls for an equal amount of 
time.  Creatures who make their saving throw take no damage and suffer no penalty on their 
dexterity, but are mildly numbed and hit at -1 for 1d4+1 rounds.  Creatures wearing metal armor 
save at -4 when passing through the screen.  The material components are a bit of fur, a glass rod, 
and a thin sheet of fine crystal, all of which vanish after the spell is cast.
 

Otiluke's Polar Screen (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  5'/LVL				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  5 MRs/LVL				Casting Time:  5 SEG
   Area of Effect:  20' sq/LVL			Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a misty, bluish-white screen of energy that can be 
shaped to form a wall, hemisphere, or sphere dimension. Any creature passing through the polar 
screen will be affected as if the creatures suddenly passed through a freezing blizzard.  Any 
creature who fails a saving throw versus spells will be coated with ice crystals for 1d4+1 rounds 
until the crystals melt away, during which time the creature suffers one point of cold damage per 
level of the caster.  The creature is also severely chilled, suffering a -4 attack penalty until the 
ice melts.  A creature who makes the saving throw is only affected by the ice crystals for one 
round, but is affected in the same way as those who fail the save.  A melt spell will dispel the ice 
crystals from a creature's body, while a fireball, but no other flame, will destroy the polar 
screen.  The material components are a thin sheet of fine lead crystals and a few bluish-white 
quartz crystals, all of which vanish after the spell is cast.


Otiluke's Radiant Screen (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  5'/LVL				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  2 MRs/LVL				Casting Time:  5 SEG
   Area of Effect:  20' sq			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a screen of energy drawn from the quasi-elemental 
plane of radiance.  The screen can bbe up to 20' square, and can be shaped into a wall, 
hemisphere, or sphere as the caster orders.  The radiant screen can be one of the seven colors of 
the rainbow, each color exhibiting a different form of energy identical to the colors of Nystul's 
Radiant Baton.

Red baton:		cold energy (+1 damage to fire-based, none if cold)
Orange baton:		heat energy (+1 damage to cold based, none if fire)
Yellow baton:		acid damage (save vs. spells or take +2 splash)
Green baton:		neutralize poison (per cleric spell)
Blue baton:		electrical energy (+10 damage to metal armored enemy)
Indigo baton:		undead specific (only undead harmed)
Violet baton: 		vegetation specific (only plants harmed)

The screen will affect anything passing through it as if the creature were being attacked by 
energy or matter of the type determined by the screen's color.  The caster can change the color of 
the screen from round to round at will, but only one color per round can exist.  The radiant screen 
will inflict two points of damage per level of the caster.  Cold-based creatures will take three 
points of damage per level of the caster when passing through the orange screen, while fire-based 
creatures will suffer three points of damage per level from the red screen.  The material 
components are a crystal prism, a beryl gemstone worth at least 500 gp, and a thin sheet of fine 
crystal colored the seven colors of the rainbow, all of which vanish after the spell is cast.


Otto's Gong of Isolation (Enchantment/Alteration)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  10'/LVL				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 TN/LVL				Casting Time:  5 SEG
   Area of Effect:  One creature		Saving Throw:  Neg.

Explanation/Description:  When this spell is cast upon a creature, the mind-numbing sound of an 
extremely loud gong fills its mind.  If the creature makes a saving throw at -2, the creature is 
only stunned for one round.  But if the save fails, the creature loses all sensory input into the 
mind. The creature cannot see, hear, feel, taste, or smell, effectively making the creature helpless.  
If the creature engages in melee, all attacks are made at -6 to hit, but the creature has no idea 
what it is attacking even if the attack succeeds.  Telepathic communication with the creature is 
still possible, and the creature might receive information about the world through such a link.  A 
wish, heal, or restoration spell will completely cure the condition.  The material components are a 
miniature gold gong and tiny gold striker with a jade stone at its head, together worth 7,000 gp in 
materials and workmanship, which vanish after the spell is cast.


Rary's Mind Shield (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  Touch				Components:  V,S
   Duration:  1 hr + 1/2 hr/LVL			Casting Time:  1 MR
   Area of Effect:  Creature touched		Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell is used to protect a creature from intrusions into the mind.  
Spells or mental powers that can probe a mind have no effect on the creature.  The creature makes 
its3 saving throw at +2 against all enchantment/charm magic that can affect thoughts, memories, 
or behavior -- charm, suggestion, quiet, emotion, fascination, or others.  The mind shield allows a 
saving throw at -2 to avoid a geas spell.


Rary's Replay of the Past (Divination)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  0					Components:  V,S
   Duration:  Special				Casting Time:  1 TN
   Area of Effect:  Special			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell enables the caster to read the residual psychic impressions 
in a room or area, replaying a past event as an illusion that everyone in the area can clearly see.  
When an especially unusual or violent event occurs, it leaves behind psychic vibrations that can 
remain for years.  The more important the event, the stronger the psychic residue and the longer 
the impressions last. When the mage casts the spell, the strongest impressions currently in the 
area enter the caster's mind.  The event that produced the psychic impressions is replayed in the 
caster's mind in real time, so the replay takes as long to complete as the original event.  The 
replay in the mind is crystal clear, so the caster can readily identify persons, creatures, or 
objects.   If the spell is cast again in the same area, the event that created the second strongest 
psychic impressions will be replayed.  The caster can continue replaying past events, reading the 
weaker and weaker psychic impressions, until all psychic residue in the area has been reviewed.


Rary's Superior Spell Enhancer (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  Special				Components:  V
   Duration:  Special				Casting Time:  1/6 SEG
   Area of Effect:  Special 			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  The spell enhancer increases the amount of damage caused by a spell 
cast by the mage.  The one-word spell enhancer is cast first, followed by the attack spell to be 
enhanced.  When the attack spell is launched, all saving throws versus the spell are made at -1. 
The spell inflicts an additional point of damage per die of the spell, so a fireball inflicts 1d6+1 
points of damage per die.  When a magic missile is cast after the spell enhancer, each missile does 
1d4+2 points of damage.


Rary's Telepathic Bond (Divination-Alteration)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  2"					Components:  V,S
   Duration:  2 TNs/LVL				Casting Time:  1 MR
   Area of Effect:  Two or more creatures 	Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  With this spell, the mage can forge a telepathic bond between two or 
more creatures with an intelligence of 6 or higher. The bond can only be established between 
willing creatures.  The creatures involved need not all speak the same language to communicate 
via the bond.  The telepathic bond can be placed upon one creature for every three levels of the 
caster, so a 16th level mage can forge a link among five creatures.  Once the bond is formed, the 
creatures can stay in contact only if they remain on the same plane.  No special power or 
influence is conferred through the bond.  A permanency spell does not have the power to make a 
telepathic bond a life-long link, but a wish spell does, although no more than two creatures can be 
permanently bonded together in this way.


Tenser's Primal Fury (Enchantment/Alteration)
   LEVEL:  5					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  20'					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 MR/LVL				Casting Time:  5 SEG
   Area of Effect:  One fighter only		Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell temporarily endows a fighter with a surge of rage and energy 
rivaling that of a berserker. Magical fear will not affect an enraged fighter.  The fighter also 
receives a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, and gains an extra attack every other melee round, 
so an attack routine of 3/2 becomes 2/1.  The fighter also gains a temporary endowment of 4d4 hit 
points, from which any damage is subtracted before the character's permanent hit point total is 
reduced.  The spell does carry a risk, however, because the berserker rage is maintained 
throughout the duration of the spell.  If all of a fighter's opponents are defeated before the spell 
expires, then the berserk fighter will turn on the nearest living creature, and continue attacking 
without regard for friend or foe until the spell expires.  A `dispel magic' spell will immediately 
return a berserk fighter to his normal state.  The material component is a bit of fur from a 
wolverine or a grizzly bear.



Level 6 Mage Spells



Ballant's Stonesplit (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  6					SOURCE:  Dragon #145
   Range:  Touch				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  Permanent				Casting Time:  6 SEG
   Area of Effect:  1000' cube of stone/LVL	Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  The wizard who casts this spell cleaves the next stone object he 
touches, the force from his fingertips manifesting in a spray of light and a thick, winding crack 
that appears in the stone with considerable force.  The crack reduces an amount of stone to rubble 
equal to the spell's area of effect, but it does nothing to clear the rubble away.  For example, a 
12th level wizard touching a 100'-long by 10'-thick by 30'-high stone wall cracks to rubble a 
40'-wide section.  Rubble fills the gap to a height of half that of the original wall and sloping 
away from each side at al 45 degree angle.  There is a three-segment delay between the mage's 
touch and the full extent of the spell's damage, which is usually enough time for a mobile caster 
to escape being crushed by his own spell.  A successful `dispel magic' during this interval 
negates `Ballant's stonesplit'.  If this spell is cast on a stone floor, a fissure opens and the rubble 
settles quickly, dropping the floor 1-4' and causing 1-4 hp damage to all in the area of effect.  
The devastating effect of this spell when cast on a stone ceiling is limited both by its range 
(touch) and by its three-segment delay (enough time for the caster to get out of the was is enough 
time for anyone else to get away).     `Ballant's stonesplit' causes great damage to stone-composed 
creatures (such as galeb duhr) -- 1-8 hp damage per level of the caster, or half is a save vs. spells 
is made -- although the caster must first score a hit in melee.  This spell automatically 
obliterates a petrified character.  Magical items composed of stone are allowed to save (at -4) vs. 
disintegration to avoid destruction.  The material component for this spell is a single diamond-
tipped chisel worth at least 1,000 gp, which disappears when the spell is cast.


Bigbys Besieging Bolt (Evocation)
   LEVEL: 6					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: Special				Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 1 MR/2 LVLs			Casting Time: 1 MR
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell is similar to magic missile.  When the spell is cast, the mage 
is able to fire one magic siege bolt for every two levels of the caster. The bolt will behave as a 
given siege engine missile in range and effect.  The type of siege missile the bolt mimics depends 
on the caster's level.

Magic-user's Level       Seige Engine Missile Mimicked
   12th 			catapult, light
   14th 			catapult, heavy
   16th				trebuchet

The bolts must be launched at the rate of one every two rounds in succeeding rounds.  During this 
time the caster can do nothing else.  If the spell is interrupted, no additional bolts can be 
launched.  The bolts strike their target unerringly.  The material component is a small stone 
sprinkled with diamond dust.


Drawmij's Beneficent Polymorph (Alteration)
   LEVEL: 6					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: Touch					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 1 TN/LVL				Casting Time: 6 SEG
   Area of Effect: Creature touched 		Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell endows the touched and willing creature with all the 
benefits of a polymorph self spell.  The creature affected does not need to make a system shock 
roll to survice.  While the first form taken by the creature is choosen by the caster, the creature 
is totally in control of its form changes for the remainder of the spell's duration, and can change 
form as often as it wishes, abiding by all the limitations of polymorph self.  The spell does not 
bestow any special abilites of a polymorphed form. The spell does not affect the creature's mental 
state in any way.  When the creature returns to its original form 1d12 hit point are restored.  The 
material component of the spell is a soft, silk caterpillar cocoon.


Drawmij's Merciful Metamorphosis (Alteration)
   LEVEL: 6					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 10'/LVL				Components: V,S,M
   Duration: Permanent				Casting Time: 6 SEG
   Area of Effect: One creature			Saving Throw: Neg.

Explanation/Description:  Drawmij developed this spell as a merciful way to get rid of an 
adversary.  The spell polymorphs an opponent into another creature as does polymorph other, but 
the target's save is made at -2.  The target can only be polymorphed into a natural animal no 
larger than a typical herd beast.  The polymorphed creature does not need to make a system shock 
roll to survive the spell.  The polymorphed creature automatically assumes the mental state of the 
animal, forgetting all knowledge of its previous self.  The animal does not radiate magic or the 
creature's original alignment aura, so there is little evidence the animal was anything other than 
what it appeared to be now.  If returned to its original form by dispell magic or a wish, the 
creature will be quite bewildered, suffering the effect of a confusion spell for 2d4 rounds. After 
the confusion passes, the creature gradually recovers its previous knowledge and memories over a 
period of 1d4 days.  The material component is a cocoon soaked in a balm of honey, powdered 
yellow-white moss agate worth 500 g.p., and powdered emerald worth 700 g.p., all of which vanish 
with the casting of the spell.


Mordenkainen's Faithful Phantom Guardian (Summoning)
   LEVEL: 6					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: Special				Components: V,S,M
   Duration: Special				Casting Time: 3 TNs
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell summons a faithful phantom being to watch over and protect 
the mage for one day.  The guardian will remain an undetectable observer, watching the caster 
from the ethereal plane.  The guardian can see what is happening within 60 feet of the caster, and 
can spot invisible, out-of-phaze, duo-dimensional, ethereal, or astral creatures within the area 
around the mage.  If the guardian spies any creature about to launch a surprise attack on the 
caster, the guardian will instantly materialize to intercept the attacker and defend the mage. The 
faithful phantom guardian:  AC 2; Move 15"; HD 6; hp 36; #AT 1; Dmg 1d10 (phantom two-handed 
sword); THAC0 13; AL N; SA able to hit creatures which are hit only by +2 magical weapons.  The 
guardian will fight up to one round per level of the caster or until it is destroyed.  The mage also 
has the option of summoning the guardian to his side at any time.  The guardian will appear in one 
round and fight under the same time limit.  Once the guardian has spent its time on the prime 
material plane, it has completed its mission and will no longer watch the caster.  The guardian 
appears as a shimmering outline of violet light.  The phantom guardian cannot speak, so it cannot 
shout a warning to the mage if he or she is attacked.  The material component is a 1,000 g.p. 
diamond, which is sent to the guardian when the spell is cast as payment for its service.


Otiluke's Diamond Screen (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  6					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  5'/LVL				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  2 MR/LVL				Casting Time:  6 SEG
   Area of Effect:  20' sq			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a glittering screen of energy of any color chosen by 
the caster.  All creatures passing through the screen will be attacked by a multitude of razor-
sharp blades made of substance drawn from the quasi-plane of mineral.  Each creature suffers 
3d20 points of damage no matter what its armor class.  The spell can be shaped into anything the 
caster wishes.  The material component is a collection of sharp diamond chips worth at least 5,000 
gp, and these vanish after the spell is cast.
 

Otiluke's Excruciating Screen (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  6					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  5'/LVL				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  3 MRs/LVL				Casting Time:  6 SEG
   Area of Effect:  20' sq/LVL			Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a misty grey screen which can be shaped into a wall, 
hemisphere, or sphere, within the designated dimension, as the caster directs.  Any creature 
passing through this screen is affected as if the creature were momentarily transported to one of 
the four negative quasi-elemental planes.  The plane which will affect creatures touching the 
screen must be chosen when the spell is memorized.  Any creature passing through the 
excruciating screen must make a save versus death magic.  Those who fail will be stunned for 1d4 
rounds and suffer 4d4 points of damage due to the shock and pain. Creatures who make the save 
suffer a -1 on all saves for 1d4 rounds. The four planes that can be simulated by the screen and 
the screen's particular effect are described below.

   Vacuum:  The shock caused is due to asphyxiation.  Creatures who do not need to breath are 
unaffected by the screen.
   Salt:  The shock is the result of the body moisture drawn from the creature.  Creatures without 
body fluids will not be affected,
such as golems, undead, or beings from the elemental planes of earth, fire, or air.
   Ash:  The shock is caused by a loss of the creature's body heat.  Undead and cold-based 
creatures are unharmed by the screen.
   Dust:  The shock is produced by having part of a creature's solid body mass dispersed.  
Creatures of a gaseous or liquid form will not be harmed by this screen.

The material components are a crystal sheet and a hollow sphere, lump of salt, pinch of ash, or bit 
of dust, depending on the type of screen.


Otiluke's Orb of Containment (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  6					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  30'					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  Special				Casting Time:  1 MR
   Area of Effect:  Special			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell is used to create a useful container for very dangerous 
substances.  When the caster has an object or substance to be contained, the spell can be cast to 
create a crystal sphere 6 inches in diameter, up to 30 yards away from the caster.  The crystal orb 
will surround the object or part of a semi-liquid substance and hold it securely.  The interior of 
the orb has the hardness of adamantine steel, so even the most volatile or corrosive of substances 
will be held safely.  Time within the orb is frozen, so the substance will not age.  The orb cannot 
be shattered by physical force or most magical attacks, although a dispel magic or disintegrate 
spell can destroy its contents.   The orb of containment will exist for one day, after which it fades 
out, freeing the contents.  If the spell is cast again before the orb fades, the spell will be renewed 
and the orb will continue for an additional day without disturbing the contents.  The material 
components are a diamond worth 1,000 gp encased in glass, both of which shatter when the spell 
is cast.


Rary's Protection from Scrying (Abjuration-Divination)
   LEVEL:  6					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  Touch				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 hr + 1/2 hr/LVL			Casting Time:  1 TN
   Area of Effect:  Creature touched		Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell will protect a creature from all scrying attempts or 
intrusive divination.  Clairaudience, Clairvoyance, ESP, empathy, telepathy, crystal balls, or a 
magic mirror will not succeed in locating, detecting, or studying the protected creature.  The 
creature will immediately become aware of the attempt, no matter how great the distance between 
scryer and creature.  If cast on himself, the mage has a 5% chance per level to divine the location 
of the scryer after one round of concentration.  The scryer must save versus spells immediately or 
his identity will be revealed.  `Detect good/evil' and `know alignment' will also not work on the 
affected creature.  The material component is a star sapphire worth 5,000 gp, which must be kept 
on the creature for the duration of the spell (and which vanishes after the spell).


Rary's Urgent Utterance (Alteration)
   LEVEL:  6					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  0					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  Up to 24 hours			Casting Time:  1 TN
   Area of Effect:  One spell			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell empowers the mage to specially prepare another spell for 
quick casting in an emergency.  Urgent utterance is cast first, followed by the spell to be readied, 
except for the last word of the spell.  When the mage needs to cast the readied spell, the caster 
need only utter the final word of the spell.  The utterance of the final word only takes one 
segment, saving much time on most spells.  The readied spell will stay in the caster's mind for 
only one day before it atrophies and fades out of memory.  No more than two readied spells can be 
in the caster's mond at any time.  Almost any spell of level 6 or less can be readied for quick 
casting, except the following:  find familiar, magic mirror, conjure elemental, contingency, 
enchant an item, ensnarement, guards and wards, legend lore, Tenser's transformation, limited 
a sapphire worth 1,000 gold pieces, which is crushed when the spell is cast.


Tenser's Fortunes of War (Abjuration)
   LEVEL:  6					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  Touch				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  Special				Casting Time:  1 TN
   Area of Effect:Person Touched		Saving Throw:  None
                  (Fighters Only)

Explanation/Description:  This spell grants one fighter a bonus of special luck in battle.  The 
fighter is given one chance to avoid any one attack that would reduce the fighter to zero or fewer 
hit points, or against magic that would remove the fighter from battle by turning to stone, 
paralyzation, petrification, sleep, charm, fear, disintegration, death, power word, or any other 
effect.  The fighter is entitled to a saving throw to avoid defeat, even if a prior save failed.  The 
fighter must make a saving throw versus death magic at -2.  If this save succeeds, then the fighter 
miraculously avoids defeat.  A damage attack that would normally reduce the fighter to zero hit 
points or less instead reduces the fighter's hit point total to one-half its current level; that is, a 
fighter with 17 hit points who takes 17 points of damage is reduced to 9 hit points.  Any other 
attack which would cause instant defeat takes no effect if the death magic save is made.  
Regardless of the result of the save, the fortunes of war spell is immediately dispelled after the 
attack.  The material component is a valuable sacrifice made to the fighter's patron war god, worth 
at least 5,000 gp in goods desirable to the diety.





Level 7 Mage Spells



Monster Summoning V (Conjuration/Summoning)
   LEVEL:  7
   Range:  7"					Components:  V S M
   Duration:  6 MRs + 1 MR/LVL			Casting Time:  6 SEGs
   Area of Effect:  Special			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell summons 1-2 fifth LVL monsters and they will appear in 1-3 MRs.  
See MONSTER SUMMONING I for other details.


Mordenkainen's Penultimate Cogitation (Alteration)
   LEVEL: 7					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 0					Components: V,S
   Duration: Instantaneous			Casting Time: 1 MR
   Area of Effect: Spellcaster			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This permits the mage to call to mind one spell from one of the caster's 
personal spell books, provided the appropriate spell book is within one mile of the mage.  The 
spell must by one that the caster knows, as explained in the Players Handbook.  The spell cannot 
be called from a scroll or another mage's spell book. The call spell can by any of the 1st to 6th 
level.  Only one spell can be called by casting of the penultimate cogitation.  The called spell can 
be cast on any succending round.  There is always a 10% chance that the called spell will be 
magically erased from the mage's spell book.


Otiluke's Death Screen (Evocation-Alteration)
   LEVEL:  7					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  5'/LVL				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 MR/LVL				Casting Time:  7 SEG
   Area of Effect:  20' sq			Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  This spell calls into existence a grey, misty screen shaped as the 
caster wills.  Any creature passing through the screen will suddenly find itself trapped in a 
mysterious zone of nil-space where the creature is subject to anti-energy drawn from one of the 
four negative quasi-planes.  For every round the creature is trapped it will lose 25% of its 
current hit point total, dropping to 0 hit points at the end of the 4th round if the creature fails to 
escape. The creature will be dead with -10 hit points at the end of the 5th round.  For every round 
a creature is trapped, it is entitled to a saving throw versus death magic.  Success indicates the 
creature escapes back into the prime material plane, emerging from the side of the screen 
opposite the side entered.  The saving throw to escape is made at -1 in the 1st round, -2 in the 
2nd, -3 in the 3rd, and -4 in the 4th round.   If the spell ends before a creature escapes or dies, 
the creature is released onto the material plane as the screen disappears, as if the creature had 
escaped on its own.  A creature re-emerging onto the prime material plane, injured but alive, is 
stunned for 1d4 rounds as it recovers from the effect of the life-draining zone.  Those imprisoned 
in the zone may heal themselves or use other magics, but can't escape unless they make saving 
throws for the zone.  The material components are a sheet of lead crystal, earth from a vampire's 
coffin, and a hollow sphere (for vacuum).


Otiluke's Fire and Ice (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  7					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  50'					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  Instantaneous			Casting Time:  7 SEG
   Area of Effect:  30' rad globe		Saving Throw:  Special

Explanation/Description:  When the spell is cast, a red crystal sphere immediately appears 
before the caster, then flies away at great speed toward an area targeted.  A split-second later, a 
blue crystal appears and follows behind the red sphere.  When the red sphere reaches the area 
chosen by the caster, it explodes in a fireball 30 feet in radius, inflicting 4d4 points of fire 
damage to all within the area of effect. A successful saving throw will reduce the damage by one-
half.  A split-second later, the blue sphere explodes in the same area of effect, causing 4d4 hit 
points of cold damage to all within a 30 foot radius.  Those who made the save versus fire will also 
take only one-half damage from the cold blast, but those who failed the save take full damage from 
the cold.  The greatest effect of the one-two attack combination is the tremendous shock inflicted 
on inanimate objects by the radical change in temperature.  All items in the area of effect must 
save as non-magical items.  Failing this save will probably cause the materials to crack or shatter.  
The material components are a pinch of phosphorous and a small quartz crystal.


Otiluke's Siege Sphere (Evocation)
   LEVEL:  7					SOURCE:  GHA
   Range:  Touch				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  1 TN				Casting Time:  1 MR
   Area of Effect:  Special			Saving Throw:  None

Explanation/Description:  This spell creates a large, boulder-sized sphere of force that can be 
fired by a catapult.  The siege sphere will last for one complete turn before it fades out of 
existence, so it must be fired within one turn of the spell's casting.  The siege sphere can take 
several different forms, and the type of spell to be created must be decided when the spell is 
memorized.  The siege sphere is as hard as adamantine steel before it is launched, and can only be 
destroyed by a wish, dispel magic, or disintegrate.  After the sphere is fired, it will take on a 
different form that depends on the attack type of the sphere.  Regardless of the form that the 
attack takes, the siege sphere is dispelled after it completes its attack.  Different types of siege 
spheres are described below: 

Liquid Fire:  When the sphere strikes its target, it instantly shatters, spraying a mass of liquid 
fire over an area 30 feet in radius.  All combustibles in the area of effect will be ignited.  Any 
creature struck by the liquid fire will take 2d4 points of damage per round for 2d6 rounds unless 
the fire is doused or the burning fluid is washed off.  The amterial components for this form are a 
drop of pitch, a bit of phosphorus, and a pinch of diamond dust. 
Crystal Shards:  This siege sphere splinters apart 30 feet above the ground, raining down crystal 
shards in a 20-foot radius circle.  Each creature in the area affected will take 5d6 points of 
damage regardless of its armor class.  The material component is a sample of sharp diamond 
flakes.
Wrecking Ball:  Upon nearing its target, the sphere's density dramatically increases so it strikes 
with three times the impact (and damage) or a heavy catapult.
The material components are a lodestone and a pich of diamond dust.

Level 8:



Bigby's Most Excellent Force Sculpture (Evocation)
   LEVEL: 8					SOURCE: GHA
   Range: 30'					Components: V,S,M
   Duration: 6 TNs+ 1 TN/LVL			Casting Time: 1 TN
   Area of Effect: Special			Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description:  This spell is the most advanced form of the force sculpture spells.  The 
object formed can be highly complex, containing many moving parts, such as a siege machine or a 
sailing ship.  Parts of an object simulated could be as flexible as a rope or the wood of a bow, so a 
large net, ballista, rope bridge, or a collection of crossbows could be formed.  As with lesser force 
sculptures fine or accurate details require an additional 2d4 rounds to form, along with the 
sufficient skill as an artist or artisan.  Up to one cubic yard of matter per level of the caster can 
be simulated.  With the exceptions noted above, the spell is otherwise identical to the 4th level 
spell of the same type.  The material component is a lump of clay mixed with 1,000 g.p. worth of 
diamond dust, which vanishes when the spell is used.

got hit.  If an object is hit, save at +4 vs.  Electricity.  Everything in the area builds up a huge static 
charge, with blue electrical fire dripping from corners, noses, and fingertips.  Undead take 1d6 of 
dammage/SEG  Any creature killed by sunlight must save or die.   Area of effect is limited by any 
physical barrier, Including wall of force, but not wall of Ice.  Magic resistance must be made against 
each effect;  (LIGHTNING, FAERIE-FIRE, and sunlight/dammage. )

			Mercury	Sodium	Neon		Chlorine
   Primary Color	Purple		Yellow		Red		Green

The material components are a 3' gold rod, topped with a glass ball filled with rarefied gas.  The type of 
gas used affects the colors of the effects.


Spell Engine (Abjuration/Alteration)
   LEVEL:  8					
   Range:  0					Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  Special				Casting Time:  1 TN
   Area of Effect:  1" rad.sphere/LVL		Saving Time:  None

Explanation/Description:  This rare and powerful magic does not come into operation until 
another spell is cast within its area of effect.  When that occurs, a huge shining wheel or vertical 
disc of glowing white light will instantly appear (some inches above any ground or floor that was 
there at the time of casting, or is there at the time of activation) where the caster stood while 
casting the engine (even if that spellcasting occurred centuries before).  It will begin to turn, 
with a gentle rushing noise, and will absorb the energy of all spells cast within its area of effect - 
so that they are wasted and do not work, but serve instead to power the turning wheel.  The wheel 
does nothing expect turn, light up the area, and benefit magic-user and illusionist wiht a curious 
side-effects:  Its sound and energies aid magical concentration, and spell memorizing times for 
spellcasters who study in the area of effect are halved.  Once activated, an engine will not 
disappear until dispelled; if starved for magical energy, it will merely turn more and more 
slowly, and gradually grow dim, until it hangs motionless, translucent and ghostly.  A spell 
engine cannot be dispelled by dispell magic (which it will absorb), not affected by normal weapon 
(which pass through it as though it does not exist).  A wish, limited wish, or alter reality spell, 
properly worded, will destroy it, as will contact with any magical item or artifact which causes a 
magical explosion doing 1-20 point of damage to all within 1" (1-8 to those from 1"+ to 2" away), 
and destroys a magical item; an artifact must make a saving throw.  If such an artifact is not 
destroied, there is a 75% chance that it will be shifted (with or without the creature wielding it) 
into another plane of existence.  Magic mouths, glyphs, symbols, and a spell engine; thus, a 
doorway can be guarded by a symbol, and a spell engine cast in front of the doorway will prevent 
the symbol from being dispelled.  Detect magic will reveal the presence and shape of an 
unactivated spell engine; the whell is typically 12' in diameter and 2' thick, standing upright on 
edge, although it will grow marginally larger if charaged by many spells and the surroundings 
permit such growth (its area of effect remaining unchanged).  It is often cast in a narrow 
passageway before a door.  Until activated, the wheel of a spell engine has no physical existence 
and cannot be touched.  A disintegrate spell will have no effect on an unactivated spell engine, 
but will destroy an activated spell engine, with an explosion identical in effect to that caused by 
contact between a spell engine and a magical item or artifact.  Note that a spell engine's area of 
effect extends through rock and void alike in a perfect sphere; it cannot be easily avoided by use 
of a passwall, dig, or phaze door.  Living creatures not possessing magical items can pass through 
the area of effect without effect; it doesn't drain spells from the mind.  Inactive spell engines 
cannot be cantacted by a living creature, magic items, or artifacts, and thus cannot be so 
activated; nor will the presence of a functioning spell, psionic effect, or magic item function 
activate a spell engine - it is only the actual casting of a spell that activates the engine.  The 
material components for this spell are a small disc of fine polished ivory, bone, shell, or marble; 
a drop of water or one of the caster's tears; and a gem (any type) of at least 1,000 gp value.


Level 9 Mage Spells



Aster's Fiery Sphere of Teleportation
   LEVEL:  9					SOURCE:  
   Range:  Sight				Components:  V, S, M
   Duration:  Instantaneous			Casting time:  2 MRs
   Area of effect:  1"/LVL radius sphere	Saving throw:  Special

Explaination/Description:  When cast, all creatures within the area of effect are engulfed inside of a 
fiery sphere and are teleported to anyplace within the mage's sight.  All creatures in the area of effect 
must make two saving throws.  If the first saving throw fails, the victim takes full damage from the 
fire.    If it succeeds, he will only take half.  The second save is made at -3 and is used to determine if a 
creature is actually teleported.  If the save is made, the creature remains in his current position, 
otherwise he is teleported to destination within the mage's sight.  Note that the caster cannot teleport 
different individuals to different locations.  All affected creatures must be teleported to the same 
place.  Damage from the fire is 1D6 per LVL of the caster.


Dismind
   LEVEL:  9					SOURCE:  Dragon, Jan 1983
   Range:  Touch				Components:  V
   Duration:  Special				Casting Time:  2 SEGs
   Area of effect:  One creature		Saving Throw:  Neg.

Explanation/Description:  This spell consists of a phrase spoken while the mage touches the recipient 
(the spell may be cast on oneself, serving as a "last resort" escape from certain death, torture, or 
mental damage), causing the recipients mind to fly from his body.  The body instantly undergoes a 
curious transformation:  It remains in the position it was when the spell was cast, surMRed by a 
glowing aura of force that allows nothing to touch the body, stopping a physical attacks, crushing, or 
probes.  The limbs of the body can be shifted by pushing on the invisible armor of force, but when 
released will slowly drift back to the original position.  Magical attacks, fire, poisons, and corrosive 
and disease producing substances (including ochre jelly, green slime, rot grubs, and the like) cannot 
reach the body to do it harm.  The bodily processes of a DISMINDed person are totally suspended, so 
that the body does not age or breathe.  DISMINDed persons have a vacant stare.  They cannot use any of 
the senses of the body they have abandoned, nor can they return to it without aid.  The freed mind 
wanders behind mental defenses of its own making, immune to all forms of magical, psionic, and other 
mental contact or attack.  A wandering mind is not detectable by any known means, and never leaves 
the Prime Material Plane.  It cannot control where it goes and what it observes, and typically retains 
little memory of its visions and speculations.  (A DM should describe 1-6 scenes or phrases of thought 
without giving any explanations. ) A wandering mind cannot deliberately pray, study, or research 
spells, or choose to observe any particular event, locale, or individual.    A wandering mind can be fully 
restored to its body by an ALTER REALITY, LIMITED WISH, or RESTORE MIND (the reverse of this spell).  
The reverse can also be used to cure insanity and all mental disorders, FEEBLEMINDedness, and physical 
brain damage.  It will end any mental controls (including QUEST, GEAS, and magical CHARMS cast by 
spell or creatures such as nixies or vampires) of any form upon a recipient mind, totally freeing the 
mind from the influence(s) without causing the individual any harm -- but it cannot restore lost psionic 
powers.  A delirious, drunken, exhausted, or drugged creature can become clearheaded and mentally 
alert by means of this spell.  A saving throw applies to both spells, and if successful against a RESTORE 
MIND (regardless of the wishes of the DISMINDed recipient creature), the spell will have no effect.  
Such a failure does not mean the mind cannot be restored, but only that the particular spell cast at that 
time did not work.


Hellfire
   LEVEL:  9					SOURCE:  Dragon #123
   Range:  Touch				Components:  V,S,M
   Duration:  Permanent				Casting Time:  1 rd
   Area of effect:  One creature		Saving Throw:  None

Description/Explanation:  The Arch-Mage Avissar is also said to have personally devised this deadly 
enchantment;  further, it is said that the Arch-Mage met his end on the vengeful point of the sword 
wielded by the brother of the spell's first victim.  Thus, the spell is often referred to as "Avissar's 
Bane. " HELLFIRE may be cast but once per week due to the strain placed on the spell-caster.  It 
requires that the spell-caster touch his victim (as a hit in melee), and it may affect any single 
creature, subject to the following conditions:  It will not affect creatures which may be hit only by 
magical weaponry;  fire-based creatures, undead, and creatures from planes other than the Prime 
Material Plane cannot be affected;  and, the victim's hit dice/LVL may not exceed the spell caster's 
LVL.  There is no saving throw vs.  HELLFIRE;  however, magic resistance is effective.

The victim of HELLFIRE suffers the following effects:

1.  The victim's hit point total is reduced to 1 permanently; 
     thus, any wound results in unconsciousness or death.
2.  The victim is in constant agony;  he feels as if he is being
     burned alive, and he sweats continuously.
3.  The victim is exhausted and any fighting is done at -4 on "to
     hit" and damage rolls.
4.  There is a 15% (noncumulative) chance per hour that the victim
     will be overcome by pain and become unconscious, only to
     waken 1-4 hours later, still in agony.  This chance
     increases to 40% if the victim engages in combat or other
     strenuous activity for more than 15 minutes of any hour.
     Each time this occurs, there is a 1% cumulative chance per
     MR thereafter that the victim dies.

These effects are permanent and will end only with the death of the spell's victim.  The effects of 
HELLFIRE cannot be negated, save by an act of the gods, a WISH spell, or by the will of the mage who 
cast the spell.  The material components are a drop of oil, a pinch of sulfur, a powdered ruby of at least 
5000 gp value, and the horn of a greater devil.

The casting of this spell is considered an evil act, as it draws negative heat energy from the Nine Hells 
directly into the victim for purposes of causing suffering.  Use of this spell might entail severe 
consequences if alignment is violated.


Phezult's Sleep of Ages (Alteration) Reversible
   LEVEL: 9					SOURCE: FRS
   Range: 1"/LVL				Components: V,S,M
   Duration: Permanent				Casting Time: 3 MRs
   Area of Effect: All living creatures 	Saving Throw: Neg.
                   in range

Explanation/Description:  By means of ths spell, a stasis field is created about the spell focus, 
radiating outward in an expanding sphere through solid rock and other physical or magical 
barriers. (Only anti-magic shell, prismantic shere, or closed-cube or spherically shaped wall of 
force will stop its effects.)  It expands 2"/round until it reaches a maximum spherical volume of 
1" radius/level of the caster. All living creatures within this field, except the caster and any 
protected as noted above, must save vs. spells or be placed in suspended animation (whether they 
wish to be or not). Creatures of level or hit dice equal to, greater than, or up to three levels or 
dice less than the spellcaster save normally.  Creatures of 4 to 7 hit dice or levels save at an 
additional -1 penalty for every level less that seven below the caster's.  The body functions of 
affected creatures virtually cease, but they do not die as a result of this state - nor will they grow 
older as the years pass.  If the creature in stasis is slain by another means (physical attack, 
crushing or burial or drowning due to environmental changes around their body, and the like), 
stasis ends instantly, and the bady will decay normally, for the assaulted creature only, not all 
others caught in the stasis.

The spell requires at least nine drops of the caster's own blood smeared into an unbroken ring of 
a radius not more than the overall length of the caster's hand (wrist to fingertips), into which are 
placed at least six gems (any type) of 500 gp value.  This is the spell-focus referred to above.  
When the spellcasting is complete, four of these gems vanish, consumed int he act of releasing the 
spell's power.  The rest fuel the stasis field and thus dwindle slowly as time passes.  Roughly one 
year of stasis is yielded per 10 gp of gem value.  Removal of any gemstone from the circle, or the 
breaking of the ring itself, will instantly end the stasis effect as will using up all the gems.  
However, any number of gems can be added to the inside of the ring to increase the period of 
efficacy, by "refueling" it.

The stasis can be lifted from individual creatures without harm (and without releasing other 
creatures under the same stasis) by casting temporal reinstatment (cf. temporal stasis) or 
Phezult's Awakening (the reverse of this spell) is cast on the spell focus, rather than on 
individual creatures, the stasis field shrinks gradually to not at the same rate at which it 
originally expanded, freeing any creatures as it does so, and no further gemstone material is lost.  
(The awakening does not require any gems or blood, but merely drops of pure or holy water.)

Creatures entering the field after it has reached its full extent (even decades or centuries after 
the spell was cast) must save vs. spells to avoid falling into stasis.  The penalties for their level 
or hit dice apply as described above, but so does a +3 bonus to the save for any creature arriving 
in the field after it has stabilized at full extent.  Such a save must be made each time a creature 
enters the stasis field, even if it has entered and been uneffected before, but each creature need 
save only once per exposure to a particular Sleep of Ages stasis field (i.e. not per each round of a 
single exposure).
