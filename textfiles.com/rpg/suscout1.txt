The scout--a "thief" without the thieving

    The scout class is presented for players and DMs who
dislike using thieves or assassins in an AD&D(R) 1st Edition game
campaign. It either takes the place of the thief class or stands
on its own if the DM still allows thieves. Scouts are not a
subclass of the thief class. Scouts use many of the abilities
inherent to the original thief class while adding a few skills
from other classes.
    Scouts have been called "rangers of the dark" because their
functions and abilities lend themselves to leading parties
through underground caves, dungeons, and so on. Scouts tend to be
quiet and intense, well knowing the amplifying effects of caverns
and hallway echoes. They love to explore underground realms,
though some have been known to operate briefly aboveground,
usually in wilderness areas having canyons, mountains, and other
rocky areas with climbable surfaces.
    Parties prefer to travel with scouts as opposed to thieves or
assassins whose ways are usually misunderstood (or are understood
all too clearly). Good-aligned characters such as paladins,
cavaliers, and clerics are wary of thieves and assassins, so the
former usually employ scouts for their adventuring needs.
    Scouts are often mistaken for thieves at first glance, as
most of them wear the same type of armor and are of the same
stature and build (often short, wiry, thin, and not very muscular
but still in good shape). However, a character's eyes usually
give him away. Thieves have shifty eyes that examine other people
and their purses and valuables. Scouts evaluate their
surroundings, not people, always searching for deadfalls, traps,
and places to which they can safely climb.
    There are no scout guilds or scouting organizations. But a
scout can usually be found near any civilized area, as most make
their living from guiding adventurers or sightseers underground.
The only people scouts abhor are assassins, a cowardly lot that
often lurks in the dark waiting for the advance members of
adventuring parties, which often are scouts.

<Abilities and skills>
    A character must have at least a 9 dexterity to become a
scout (a scout with a dexterity of 16 or better gains a 10% bonus
to his experience points). A scout can be any alignment, as all
alignments make use of them. Any character race can be a scout,
and there are no level limitations for any of the races. Use the
same method to roll up scouts that you would use for any other
character.
    Scouts are not restricted in their use of poison, oil, or
magical items (other than restrictions defined by the magical
item itself or those laid down in this article). They never use
shields and may wear only leather, padded, studded leather, or
elfin chain mail armor, opting for maximum maneuverability. Their
weapon choices are limited only in that scouts cannot use weapons
longer than 3.5', nor can they use two-handed weapons such as
polearms, pikes, staves, spears, battle axes, bastard swords,
bows, crossbows, lassos, etc. Swords are preferred, and hand
axes, daggers, and hammers are also used (doubling as tools).
Scouts can use slings and hurled weapons such as javelins,
throwing axes, daggers, and so forth. Scouts attack once per
round and receive two initial weapons' proficiencies. Scouts gain
one weapon proficiency every four levels. The weapons'
nonproficiency penalty is -3 to hit.
    Scouts use the to-hit and saving-throw tables for thieves,
and have six-sided hit dice (as stealth is preferred over direct
combat). Scouts advance in experience as thieves, as shown in
Table 1; the only difference is that a scout gains 3 hp per level
beyond the 10th, not 2 hp like a thief. Scouts do not pay for
their training past 10th level.
    Unlike a thief, a scout gains no bonuses for back stabbing,
though he has normal bonuses for attacking from behind or with
surprise. Scouts also cannot pick pockets or set traps, and
stealing is neither their specialty nor purpose. They usually
avoid doing anything that might allow someone to track them,
leaving everything just as they found it (doing otherwise only in
rare cases).
    The scout's functions of opening locks, finding and removing
traps, moving silently, hiding in shadows, hearing noise, and
climbing walls are as per the thief abilities described on page
27 of the AD&D 1st Edition [Player's Handbook], but their
progression is slightly different and is given on Table 2 (with
modifiers on Tables 3-5). Scouts also have functions similar to
the thief-acrobat's tightrope walking and tumbling-falling, as
described on pages 23-24 of [Unearthed Arcana]. The
distance covered by the fall at any given level is listed in the
Table 6. Scouts do not have a separate language like thieves'
cant and have no extraordinary ability to read languages. Any
scouts may gain the nonweapon proficiencies given in Table 7.
They start with three nonweapon proficiencies, then gain one
every four levels thereafter.
    The scout class can be combined with any other class in a
multiclassed or dual-classed roll except with an assassin,
barbarian, cavalier, monk, paladin, or thief. A scout never takes
on followers, henchmen, or hirelings, and he may build an abode
only within sight of a town (the source of his income).
    Scouts have certain other special abilities, as follows:
    [Surprise]: A scout's surprise function operates under
the following conditions: If operating by himself, or 30' away
from a party, or in a party composed entirely of scouts, a scout
surprises foes on a 1-3 on 1d6, and is surprised on a 1 on 1d6,
as per a ranger. If the PC is a ranger/scout mixed class, then he
surprises opponents on a 1-3 on 1d6 if in unfamiliar terrain, or
on a 1-4 on 1d6 if in familiar terrain. He is surprised on a 1-2
on 1d20 if in unfamiliar terrain, or on a 1 on 1d20 if in
familiar terrain.
    [Underground tracking]: When following opponents in an
underground setting, a scout can track as well as a ranger of two
levels higher (use the information on outdoor tracking in
[Unearthed Arcana], page 21). If the PC is a ranger/scout,
he tracks underground as a ranger four levels higher than his
highest class. A scout tracks outdoors at one-half his normal
chance; a ranger/scout can track outdoors normally as allowed by
his ranger level.
    [Back protection]: At 4th level, a scout gains the
back-protection ability of a barbarian ([Unearthed Arcana,
]page 19). Back protection allows the scout to sense an
attack from behind, as from a thief or assassin, and the back
attack then loses all bonuses to hit and damage. Unlike the
barbarian, however, the scout is not allowed to strike back if he
has completed normal melee for that round. The scout gains a 20%
chance to detect back attacks at 4th level, then gains 5% per
level thereafter.
    [Detect secret doors]: At 6th level, the scout can
detect secret doors. The scout can detect concealed or secret
doors by merely passing within 10' of them and rolling a 1 on a
1d8. If he is searching for such doors, he has a chance to find a
secret door on a 1-2 on 1d8, and a concealed portal on a 1-3 on
1d8.
    [Detect illusions]: At 8th level, the scout can detect
illusions. He begins at 8th level with a 20% chance to determine
that some sight, sound, or other sensory phenomenon is actually
an illusion/phantasm spell. This ability gets better at a rate of
7% per level. This detection requires one round of concentration
on the illusion. Regardless of level, the chance to detect such
spells may never exceed 75%.
    Scouts offer an option that has long been lacking for
adventuring parties: a "thief" who won't pick your pocket. The
scout offers excellent investigative abilities and survival
skills useful to everyone. Even thieves might like to have a
scout around to check the corridor ahead for monsters!


NOTE: The following tables appear rather messy, but we don't have
a quick, nice way of setting them up (our time is limited). You
should take the time to set up each table as best you can, using
the original article (and common sense) to set it aright.

<Notes>
* This category applies when wearing [bracers of defense
]or a cloak, but no large or bulky protective devices.
Dexterity bonuses always apply to scout abilities when wearing
any scout armor. Any scout armor worn can be covered by another
garment. Elfin chain mail can be worn under normal clothing, but
studded leather and padded armor are stiff and can only be
covered by a full body cloak.
