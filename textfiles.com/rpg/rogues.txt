                        The Net Rogues' Gallery

 Have you ever been running a game of AD&D and suddenly find you need an
NPC to help your players out of a sticky situation when you haven't prepared
any? Or turned up for a gaming session and found you've left your character
sheets at home? Or needed an arch-villain to give the game your running an
unexpected twist?
 If the answer to any (or all) of these questions is yes then this work might
be of some use to you. 
 A "Rogues' Gallery" is a collection of NPCs available for a DM to use in
his/her game to help or hinder the players. Many companies produce them for
use in theirs and other peoples game systems. This one was put together by
me using the contributions of some of the members of the AD&D discussion
list (AD&D-L@UTARLVM1.UTA.EDU) and my own "old" PCs and NPCs. 
 The major differences between the Net Rogues' Gallery and other similar
publications are that: 
 A, this one is made up of material provided bt players and DMs of AD&D, not
    games designers.
 B, this one will be up-dated upon on a regular basis (provided people keep
    contributing to it), which the others don't.
 C, its completely free and copies can be passed out to your friends free of
    charge, ever heard of a gaming company allowing you to do that!

 Of course there is still one thing to remember. If you wish to change any of
the entries within this work then it is recommended that you contact the 
owner of that entry for his/her permission (the ones with no name or e-mail 
address associated with them belong to me) before doing so.

 If you wish to contribute to the NRG, complain about it, or point out any
"errors", then please e-mail me at the following address.

Background
==========

 Alzandra is the daughter of a rich merchant from the city of Candanus. 
As a child she was somewhat spoilt by her parents, indulging her every whim;
including training in the use of weapons and combat.
 Alzandra grew up into a attractive looking woman of statuesque appearance.
However, she was also arrogant, aloof, and refused to behave in the manner in
which a woman of her station should. Her father berated her constantly and in
the end threatened to send her to a convent of the church of Jesunkhil.
 That day she sold most of her jewelry, bought a suit of chain mail, a broad
sword, provisions, and a horse and left the city for the capital city.
 Once there she joined a mercenary company, with which, until recently, she 
was still adventuring with.
 However, she is still arrogant and aloof.

Arrinoth Cutblade - Cleric
==========================

AL    : CN
AGE   : 49

WEAPON PROF.: HALBERD, THROWING AXE
NWP: R/W COMMON, SPELLCRAFT, RELIGION.

MAGIC ITEMS: HALBERD +1
NONE-MAGIC ITEMS: BANDED MAIL, WEAPONS OF PROFICIENCY, HOLY SYMBOL OF RUSLAN

APPEARENCE: JUST YOUR AVERAGE MIDDLE+ AGED GENTLEMAN. (MEDIUM HEIGHT, MEDIUM
BUILT, GRAY HAIR, BLACK EYES, A LOT OF WRINKLES)

BACKGROUND: He was born in the capital-city of his country, to a family of
wealthy merchants. Wealthy, that is, until he decided he just HAD to study
the arcane art of magic. He wasn't very good, so he had to go through magic
school 3 times. This nearly impoverished his parents, who just couldn't say
no to their only son. At last, at age of 25, he became a wizard. After
several years of working in the local guild, he decided that casting
IDENTIFY spells for passing adventurers is  just fu#$%king unintersting.
So, our hero decided to go out and see the world. He joined a party of
adventurers, and for some time, all was going well: they fought monsters,
won a fair amount of treasure and excitement (he got to level 4 in the
process). UNTIL, one cursed day, they had the misery to find GERIZAG, the
fabled city of undead. In the city's largest palace, the party was attacked
by a spectre. The creature was in a frenzy of destruction, after they
mistaskingly released him from his grave. Almost all party members lost
life levels in that fight. Arrinoth was the unlickiest. He was struck
twice, and reduced to level ZERO. His surviving companions carried his
almost lifeless body home , beyond Blue Moon Mountains. But Arrinoth
didn't die. His exceptional health (well, it WAS exception before his
little 'accident') helped him to recover, 6 month later. In a shock ,
he discovered, that he lost ALL his magical talent, for wich he worked
for years. Others would break down, but not him. As soon as he could
walk , he went to the nearest temple of RUSLAN THE MIGHTY (deity of war),
and simply said to the high priest :'I want to learn how to defeat undead.
Teach me, please.'. The high priest decided to put him through a test.
He said :' If you are willing to sacrifice what used to be most precios to
you, RUSLAN will receive you. Hearing this, Arrinoth went home, brought
his spellbook, and before the eyes of the priest, burned it. The temple
was filled with unnaturally bright light. "THE MIGHTY ONE agreed to
receive you" - said the high priest. And so in was. Arrinoth studied
hard to make his way through the church hierarchy, waiting for a day
when he could use his skills to turn or destroy that spectre.
(He is , in fact +1 on all turning attempts, +2 vs. spectres, and +4 vs.
THAT PARTICULAR spectre - because of his immence hatred to undead). He
soon will begin gathering a party of adventurers to cross the Blue Moon
Mountains again, and face his old enemy. He will not reveal the nature
of Gerizag to his fellow-party-members, nor will he warn them of the
monster awaiting them in the palace (He doesn't want them to be scared
and run away). He just wants to beat the sh%t out of the spectre, and
he doesnt really care if he or anyone else gets hurt.


BTW: In my world, the god of war allows his clerics to use any large
cutting weapons. if your campain is differnt, adjust his weapons
accordingly.

Appearance:
~~~~~~~~~~~
 Azaghal is about four feet and eight inches in height and weighs about
170 pounds. He is stocky as is usual for a dwarf. He has deep blue eyes,
and dark brown hair, and a long dark brown beard which he keeps immaculately 
tidy and clean, and is of noble bearing.
 Over his sparkling plate mail, he wears a bright Royal Blue surcoat, and
wears a bright red cloak/cape.
 All he carries in the way of weapons are his Great 2 handed Battle Axe, and
a smaller hand axe by his side.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personality/History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Outwardly he appears as a normal dwarf, but in reality, he has taken on 
qualities of other races. Like a sense of humour (albeit warped), a like for 
magic, and lost the dwarven dislike of the forest. He keeps these feelings to 
himself mostly, and to his closest friends.
 He  has a great love of music and singing. He even has developed a liking for
elven verse and song.  But he doesnt tell any-one.
 At times, Azaghal has taken on a manner closest to that of a Human Paladin. 
And thus, in some lands Azaghal is known as the Dwarven Paladin.
 Azaghal has travelled widely, been on many adventures. One adventure of note 
was the rescueing of Queen Yolande's daughter, and bringing her back safely to 
Celene.  For which Azaghal was allowed to build a church for Moradin within the
capital, Enstad.  Azaghal also was given a title for within Celene.

***********************************************************************

    Bansca's mother was a wood-elf and a ranger, his father was a druid.
Bansca is an incredibly handsome, witty and charming lad who is
currently a special envoy (and occaisional spy) for the Grand Druid. He
travels the world (teleport ring) keeping an eye on things and reporting
back regularly to his master. He is resigned to the fact that he will
never achieve greatness in the druidic hierarchy, and he has a wonderful
singing career to console him.
                 Bansca often pretends to be just a Bard, especially
when on a mission where being a druid is unhealthy. He is allways
cheerful, and will start singing at the slightest provocation. Among the
allies on which he can call at need is Khementh, an Old Bronze Dragon
who lives under an island off the coast of (Gwal on my world) and is
an ally of the sea-elves. ( Your normal bronze dragon with 115 hp.)
Use Bansca to involve the PC's in druidic plots, or simply as the
unintentional starter of a barroom brawl. (Picking up the wrong girl
again. :)  )

Background

 Caleaxia is a half-drow outcast. Her mother was raped by a member of a drow
raiding party and was then beaten until her attacker thought her dead.   
 However, Caleaxia's mother was not dead and recovered, but found herself to
be pregnant by her attacker. Caleaxia was born many months later and was lucky
enough not to have only inherited the white hair of her attacker and a swarthy 
cast to her skin; similar to that of Cabritsian traders. However Caleaxia, in
accordance with the laws regarding children of rape, was taken several miles
outside the city to the Temple of the Needy; a group of priests of various 
deities who devoted their lives to the help of those less fortunate.
 Here Caleaxia was raised and tutored by the priests, learning to read and
write and learning of all the deities of the various pantheons.
 Caleaxia grew to love all the priests as surrogate fathers, but was 
especially fond of an ancient elven priest called Ev'reban. It was Ev'reban 
who taught Caleaxia of the elven gods and especially of his god Rillithane 
Rallathil. At 18 Caleaxia asked Ev'reban to make her an initiate of the temple
of Rallathil.
 When Caleaxia was 23 Ev'reban died of old age and Caleaxia left the Temple of
the Needy and journeyed to Tulamein in search of her mother. Unfortunately,
Caleaxia's mother had left Tulamein many years previously; driven away by the
other people of the town for allowing herself to be raped by a drow and live.
 Caleaxia went in search of her mother but never found her. Instead she took
up a life of adventure, but one day plans to journey into the depths of the 
world in order to make the drow pay for the rape of her mother. Caleaxia hates
the drow with all her heart.

Background
==========

 Callumas was born in the sleepy homlet of Salbrij, where his itinerant 
parents were spending the winter. Callumas is the son of a travelling elven    
healer and his wife, an elven mage. As a child he was bright and happy if a 
little lazy and workshy, doing what pleased him not others. He learnt his 
basics in magic from his mother during his childhood. 
 When his mother thought he was ready she sent Callumas to Gulmarsh to learn
the proper craft from his mother's own teacher, Tavarint. Tavarint took
Callumas in as his apprentice and began instructing him in the principles and
discipline of magic. Callumas soon began to tire of this, wanting to start
using magic rather than reading and writing about it. He also started to
frequent the inns and public houses of Gulmarsh, drinking and gambling away 
what money he had. Soon Callumas was heavily in debt and was forced to trying
to steal money to pay his debts. 
 His activities came to the attention on the local thieves guild, but rather
than killing or maiming Callumas they offered to let him join them. The guild
had just lost one of their two mages to the gibbet and needed a replacement.
 Callumas spent the next few months learning magic from Tavarint during the 
day and working with the thieves guild, and picking up their skills too, at 
night. 
 Eventually, Callumas's apprenticeship to Tavarint ended and he began to 
work full time for the guild. However, he soon bored of this and set out 
looking for adventure, fame, and more to the point, wealth.
 He is still looking for the latter two.
Callumas is called Ice-eyes because of his very pale grey eyes.

History :
~~~~~~~~~
 Casxio was born in the region of Miyarn, a small fishing village on the west 
coast. His grandfather was a Ranger, and would take the young Casxio out into 
the woods and show him the skills needed to carry on a family tradition.
 The task fell to him as his father had been killed when he was 10, fighting 
to protect the village against the giants which occasionally attacked. Upon 
taking up his adventuring life when 15, he travelled the realm, but favoured 
the sea, and longed to travel across it. This he did, when hired by a mage 
for protection during his quest to find components for a new spell he was 
working on. During the voyage, Casxio came to appreciate the work involved in 
being a mage, and was interested in the working of the spells. Upon the end of 
his hire, he asked the mage to take him on as his apprentice. This he did.  
 From that point, he stayed with the mage, and they worked on many spells 
together, selling those they could and using them to help impoverished 
villages. However, it was when travelling that he uncovered a plot to kill 
the mage.  A death warrant had been issued by a colletion of evil thieves so 
the mage would stop his good work.  Casxio implored one of the most powerful 
thieves guilds in the area to intervene. The master thief asked a high price 
for the service.  The indenture of Casxio to the guild, and his agreement to 
train in the arts of the thief.  This he agreed to to save the life of the 
mage.  He initially begrudged the training, but then came to find a natural 
flair, and liking for the life of a thief, which he has decided is his life 
quest...to be master of his own guild.

Long Sword +1, +2 versus Magic Using and Enchanted Creatures

History :
~~~~~~~~~
Dante's mother was a prostitute in a small town on the Wild Coast.  He never 
knew who his father was, and earned his keep begging in the streets of the 
town (town was Elredd). Dante  had to live off the streets with his cunning 
and wits. This was made easier due to his surprising strength, intelligence,
and ruthlessness.  Some would even accuse him of cold blooded cruelty.
 Eventually, he came to the notice of a person who had contacts with the
assassin's guild (he was an assassin).  Dante was 16 by now and had
established himself as somebody to be feared and avoided by most people who 
knew of him.  This person, who's name was Gart, convinced Dante to try the 
life of an assassin.  Dante finally agreed, as it seemed a way to make a 
living, and killing didn't worry him at all.
 Dante was brought into the local guild, and given training in the arts of 
murder and deceipt.  His natural ability shone through and he was recognised 
as a potentially great assassin.  He killed quite a few people, too, finally 
reaching 3rd level.
 It was at this stage that Dante was given the job of killing a priest. This 
priest was a worshipper of the God of forests, but had made enough enemies to 
warrant an assassin's poisoned blade.
 Dante went to the priest and made the attempt, but was set upon by ogres
before he could attack the Priest (whose name was Peyel).  He was almost 
killed by the ogres, and tortured horribly.  He woke to find himself with the 
priest he was sent to kill, who had healed him and saved his life.
 For the first time in his life, Dante faced a moral dillemma.  He was still 
too weak to move much, so he and Peyel talked much, about life, beliefs and the
way of things.  Dante, through these conversations and guilt, began to see his
past life in a different way - he realised he was truly not happy with his evil
ways, and repented his many murders.  Evntually, he told Peyel the truth; what 
he was, and what he had come to do.  Peyel forgave him and blessed him.  This 
was the final straw for Dante.  He decided to give up his evil ways, and leave 
the assassin's guild.  Peyel offerred to help, and introduced him to the ways 
and beliefs of good.
 He also introduced him to a friend called Mark, a ranger, offerring Dante an 
alternative life.  Dante accepted, and began his life anew as a ranger.  
Through all of this, he never forgot or forgave the fact that ogres had 
tortured him and left him for dead.
 Finally, Dante returned to his old guild to take his leave of Gart. When Gart
discovered what had happened, he went into a rage and attacked Dante.  Dante 
fought back and ended up killing Gart, but not before being discovered by the 
rest of the guild.  Dante fled and escaped the guild, and wandered until he 
was picked up by Lirdium for the quest of the talisman at the Rock.

Description & Notes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Do is a perfectionalist and a grumbler, who is incredibly bright to boot.
He is usually mumbling and complaining about something, and occaisionally
that mumbling contains brilliant thought in it.  Unfortunately his brother
Gilim, isn't really bright enough to catch the brilliance, so a lot gets
missed.  He is far too individualistic too fit in with his clan's legacy of
military service, therefore he has gone out with his brother to see how the
rest of the world lies. He doesn't believe in any religion.  He is a fanatic
about keeping his equipment clean, and gets really upset at himself when he
doesn't preform well.  He hates melee combat and his concept of tactics is to
simply retreat to cover and then fire his crossbow if at all possible.  He
is perfectly happy to fire into a crowd, having utter confidence in his
ability to hit what he aims for.  In game terms, he has to make a wisdom
check to keep from firing anytime there is a 50% or greater chance
of hitting an ally.  This roll is modified by -1 for every time he hits an
ally in that melee.  In addition, if he makes three sucesfull shots in a
row, he will start making called shots until he either passes a wisdom check or
misses three straight times.

History :
~~~~~~~~~
 I was found by monks outside the Temple of Blessed Tranquility when I was 
about three.  Father Dameon was always kind and good hearted and honest.
When I was found, there was a pouch hanging around my neck, with a note,
elegantly written, requesting that the monks raise me in the ways of peace.
The writer described how my father had been murdered in a battle far away
from the temple, and that the warring tribes about my homeland (which was
also left unnamed) would seek my harm.  I was dressed in silk robes and had
a golden meddalion around my neck.  It was inscribed with the likeness of a
woman on one side and a man on the other.  Also in the pouch was 30 platinum
pieces.
 The letter had explained that the monks should use the money in my education.
This is exactly what my mentor, Father Dameon, did.  He instructed me in all 
manner of law, and all the responsiblities of the order.  He was a peaceful 
man, who demonstratively lead us in the ways of our God.  I was taught self 
defense, using the quaterstaff.  He even taught me how to read and write the 
common tongue.  I was also instructed in the ways of healing and herbalism.
 Father Dameon treated me as if I was his own son, and injected with me
with respect for all creatures.  I eat no meat, and thank animals for any
produce I have from them.  Yet, the greatest thing Father Dameon taught me
was respect for myself.  He held for me all these 15 years the pouch and
medalion and on the anniversary of my discovery, he handed me the pouch, with
the 13 pp that it still contained, and the note and medalion.

  "Eli, my son," his sun spotted hands clasping mine,"you are now a man
I am sure."  With that he looked up and down my form.  "You have been nurtured
here in the bossom of our sweet God these 15yrs.  I have loved and cosseted
you as if you were my own.  But now you must decide.  Will you take the final
vows of our temple, or will you search out your heritage?"

    "My father," I cried,"please advise me!  My heart is heavy with the burden
of the years and who I am is entrenched in this shrine.  Please do not send me
off without your blessing or advice."

"My son, I think you should seek out your mother, if she still lives.  You
should find who you are, so that you may feel secure in your future.  If, when
you know who you are, you wish to return, then my aging heart will love to
confirm your commitment to our God in hearing your vows of celebacy.  But, if
you are a noble born, and the gratuity left you suggests this may be so, then
your destiny may lie in producing a future generation to rule wisely over some
kingdom.  However, once you take these, the last commitments of this temple,
you will be bound by your word to remain here. 
"It could be possible that it was the God himself that brought you here.  He
may be calling you to bring peace to the troubled realm that the note tells
of.  So my son, I bid you go.  Take all that we have taught you and live in
peace.  If our God permits,  I hope to hear from you before the time that he
calls me home."

I took some bread, and a robe, and then walked to the nearest town where I
bought supplies and asked about the woman on the medalion.  I felt that she
was my mother, for when I looked at her I could see the same face staring
down on me, bending to kiss my forehead.  I could feel that she was my mother
in the odd way one can sometimes feel ones memories.  But where to look?

Ring of Elemental Control (Earth)
Druid Staff (20 charges)

        The druid staff is a shaft of oak with a head carved in the shape
of a wild animal, usually a boar, wolf, deer, or eagle. The staff allows
the user to perform several special functions.

        It can be used to summon animals of the type carved onto the staff.
At a cost of two charges, the user can send out a call. All animals of the
appropriate type within 12 miles hasten to the druid as quickly as
possible. Once they reach the druid, they act as if under an animal control
spell. 
        The staff can also be used to cast animal control on any animal
within sight of the staff, at a cost of 1 charge.

        The staff functions as a magical weapon, with a +2 bonus to attack,
inflicting 1d6+2 points of damage on a successful hit.

        The staff also functions as a python staff, with the
characteristics of the staff of the serpent as detailed in the DMG. This
includes the destruction of the staff if the snake is killed. Using the
staff as a snake costs one charge.

        At a cost of two charges, the staff can be used to cast one of the
following spells:

        Call Lightning             Plant Growth
        Dispel Magic               Cure Disease
        Cure Serious               Speak With
          Wounds                    Plants

        Once per month, with no cost in charges, the staff can perform one
of the following greater abilities:

        Wall of Fire               Insect Plague
        Transmute Rock to          Wall of Thorns
          Mud
        Conjure Fire               Conjure Earth
          Elemental                  Elemental

        The Staff can be recharged.


History :
~~~~~~~~~

Finovar,  was  born  son  of  a  Ranger  helping  with  the war against the
Humaniods in Vesve forest.  Shortly after his birth, his parent were killed
during a major battle defending their home from humanoids in the service of
Iuz.

Miraculously  surviving  the attack, Finovar wandered off, and was found in
the  woods  by  Lharave, a Dryad living in the forest.  She brought him up,
showing  him  the  ways  of  the  forest,  and protecting him from the wars
within the great forest.

Taking  the  forest  as  his own, he has helped in the wars against Iuz for
many  years, and has continued climbing the Druidical hierarcy.  Until now
he  is  the  Great Druid of this area.  Upon hearing about the treasures of
Iggwilv, Finovar realised that he must make sure that the treasure is found
and that Iuz or his followers didnt get it.

Finovar  is  about  five  feet  and  nine inches tall, and weighs about one
hundred  and forty pounds.  Finovar is slim, attractive and looks very much
accustomed  to wilderness travel.  Finvar appears young, with black hair,
blue  eyes  and  a short, black beard.  He carries very little, having just
some brown robes, a hornlike sword, and a grand wooden staff.  Also, he has
many pouchs that carry many herbs, and spell components.
 Alongside Finovar is his companion Ben, a large Grizzly bear. He has 
other  animal  friends,  but  only  brought  Ben.  He has been trained as 
a guard, and as a protector.

Background
==========

 Not much is known about Galain. He refuses to tell anything of his
background; where he comes from, his family, or even his religion. It is
obvious, however, that he is on a mission of some sort; though he will not 
admit to it.
 The only thing known about Galain is his recent background. Five years ago
he arrived in Canandas looking for a place in an adventuring company. Since
then he has travelled with several groups, though never staying with one for
more then two or three "outings". Every now and then he will disappear for
several weeks and then turn up again as if nothing untoward had occurred.
 His nickname of Iron-heart is partly due to the fact that he never flees from
an enemy, and from the fact that he never makes friends with any of his fellow
adventurers.

 (DM's can fit any background they wish to this character to provide whatever
subplot they want to their campaigns, etc.)

Description & Notes
===================
Gilim is a pragmatist, always acting in the most rational if not the most
ethical manner.  As Do's big brother he sees himself as Do's protector,
and doesn't give Do credit enough to be able to protect himself.  This can
lead to some interesting brotherly combat.  Gilim's pragmatism is
undermined by his lack of intelligence, so what he percieves to be perfectly
rational may be flat out stupid due to some obvious oversight on his part.
However, he will not charge into combat without weighing the odds first.
When he does go, he is a master with his battleaxe.  He primarily worships
Kador the Dwarven god of war although lesser gods of strength and others are
worshipped.  Often says hearty things like "Dwarves always buy the first
round!"  His normal morale is 14, he has infravision to 60ft, and his
birthday is Numont the 16th.  His kit is the fighter's Axe For Hire kit as
decribed in the Complete Book of Dwarves.

Game History
============
For many years Gilim followed his clans legacy of military training and a
career in the Dwarven army.  When he learned his brother Do was going to
go explore the world, Gilim ended his gainful employment in the armed forces
and went with him, to keep him out of trouble.  Do and his brother Gilim were
approached by Kae in a quiet pub in the town of Penhaligon.  Kae offered
them employment as support personnel for the main party and they accepted.
After  several months of adventuring with the group, Gilim had clearly
established himself as the deadliest of the lot in melee.  Often defeating
the strongest of the party's foes singlehandedly Gilim was ready to advance a
level.  Before this could occur, the party embarked on a seemingly easy
mission, wherein his brother Do was slain by a poisoned bolt.  As the Dwarven
priests cannot raise dead, Do was lost forever, and Gilim is in a deep
period of depression and mourning as he has failed in protecting his brother.
He knows he must return to Rockhome to tell his parents of Do's death and
ask their mercy for his failings.  He is becoming quite spiritual and
contemplative in these recent days, and could possibly become a priest
upon returning home.

History :
~~~~~~~~~
Only son of Fred and Martha Nile of Barovio he was disowned by his parents
when he refused to become a high priest in the church. He drifted around the
countryside doing farm work and other forms of hard labour before he met
Hasloth who became his mentor and began to train him in the fighting arts.

Godfire is now on a quest to win his way back into his family and the church
through 'good deeds'.

Godfire of course is a huge hulking man whose need for acceptance clouds his
mind somewhat. He has the subtlety of a flouresent musical rock and the
gentleness of a sharp spike inserted up ones anus.

The Cloak of Eleven Kind is a special order.  Not only does it act
    as an improved Cloak of the Eleven Kind.  It can change its
    colors to match Greymoons whims, usually dark Brown or Khaki.
    Greymoon NEVER lets this cloak out of his sight or reach.
    The cloak also has magical compartments that hold the
    following:
            Two handed Sword +5
            100gp, 100sp (In secret pocket)

            Blaster Pistol - full charge (In a Special pocket with
            2 batteries)  These High Tech weapons are from the
            adventure Expedition to the Barrier Peaks.
            The cloak has an emergency teleport spell that will let
            Greymoon teleport without error once (Then it must be
            recharged)  If Greymoon is not conscious or seriously
            wounded (near 10 hp) the Cloak will teleport him
            without error back to Massmorphius's castle (Then it
            must be recharged).

  3 potions of Extra-healing

  1 pair Gauntlets of Ogre Power
 
Description:  Greymoon has brown hair, cut short with an efficient
look.  He has eyes are plain brown, but can call upon a piercing
gaze that will look right through a person.  He has a mid sized
nose and a strong Jaw.  He looks strong but not overly muscled.  He
always stands straight and tall, when possible.  Greymoon does not
wear armor anymore relying on magic instead.  He wears lose fitting
clothes.  Greymoon usually wears a light brown shirt with a lose
collar, dark khaki or black pants, high dark boots of Elevenkind.
He often wears a special cloak of Elevenkind, which when not
keeping him invisible can either be colored black or khaki.
Greymoon does not often look imposing to other, until called to do
some heroics and then look out.  He can radiate power with the best
of them, with magic items and nasty looking weapons at his command.
 
History:  As a young child Greymoon was orphaned.  His parents were
killed by Orcs and he was found by a group of Half-lings and raised
there until he was 10, when he was to big for the tunnels.  He was
passed off to a group of Elves, who began his training as a
fighter.  They never taught him their language, but he did learn a
bit of Lizard Man (from a nearby civilized tribe) and Red Dragon,
while studying with the other children.  He was forced out of the
tribe at eighteen to make a mark for himself in the world.
     Unfortunately Greymoon met up with a bad crowd, a group that
included a very evil halfling fighter-thief Massmorphius.  Greymoon
was not very stable after losing his parents and then being
shuffled from one group to the next.  He spent the next few years
taking his frustration out on the world.  With Massmorph, he
traveled widely and first helped in clearing out of a dungeon near
the borderlands of an empire.  He then was part of a group that
destroyed a plot by the Giants of the east to invade the empire.
His group did well in dispatching the giants only to find the signs
of a larger plot to disrupt the surface world.  By this time
Massmorph had all but taken control of this group of adventurers
with his leadership skills, height charisma and experience.
Everyone in this group was now very powerful with many magic items.
After a long journey in the underworld, the group detected and
defeated a Drow plot to the surface world.  The group did not care
much that they were doing good, only that they would not be
punished for their deeds, once they returned to the surface world.
Their adventure took them to other realms where they defeated
Lolith Demon Queen of Spiders.  They captured her ship and treasure
for use in paying for further adventures.
     Once they returned to the real world this group that included
Greymoon heard of a fallen star that held great power.  The trip to
the great Barrier Peaks was quite an adventure.  They found not an
ancient fallen star but some strange building.  This strange
building had light without flame or magic.  Strange monsters,
unusual weapons, and armor of great power.  Full of power from
their adventures this group successfully challenged the mage of the
valley near the crash site and forced him out.  They took control
of the Valley of the Mage and constructing a large wall across the
entrance to the valley.
     Having become little more than a fancy bodyguard, Greymoon
became disillusioned with his life and began to wander the world on
his own.  He has had enough of intrigue between nations and
controlling small armies.  He was no longer the angry youth of the
past.  He became more stable, but with many enemies stalking him he
has never had a chance to rest.  He may at any time be called back
to the service of Massmorphius who is now very close to being a
demi-power.  Which can be good since Massmorphius will lend
Greymoon his most powerful weapon on request.  This magical
footman's mace has been enchanted with mighty magics.
     Greymoon was most recently seen in the Sojourners Inn, but
most of the time he will be found wandering the world looking for
a little adventure and hopefully some inner peace.

History :
~~~~~~~~~

                Before adventuring Career...
        Bernard Hallonan, or Grimm as he now calls himself, is the son of a
moderately wealthy merchant who traded in wines, the second of four brothers.
His aptitude for magical study was recognised early and an entry exam (plus a
suitable bribe) assured him a place in the academy of magic. During his first
few months, however, an accident during an attempted summoning caused a large
explosion and a momentary extraplanar rift which only he is known to have
survived. This was due to the influence of a demon alerted when the rift
opened, and who saw the potential for mischief in the apprentice. Dazed and
unnoticed in the confusion, Bernard wandered right out of the city and into
the forest, and was presumed dead (or worse) by the academy authorities.
Wandering in the wilderness, his mind somewhat unhinged by the incident,
Bernard was contacted by the demon for the first time. Awed by the presence
of the being and the promises of great power it offered, he accepted the
tutelage and proceeded to become a warlock skilled in the art of necromancy.
It didn't take long, though, before he began to rebell against the demands
placed upon him, and the constant intrusion into his thoughts and actions
made by the fiend. Eventually he broke free of its direct influence, but is
still harrassed by the demon's attempts to regain control of its "investment".
He took with him magical knowledge, a figurine of wonderous
power and a ring of the ram, all bribes by the demon to retain his confidence
and devotion.
        Lost in the forest with no skills to protect himself, Bernard would
probably starved to death if he had not stumble across a log cabin, the final
resting place of a retired adventuring thief (one of the few who die
peacefully). Although the place had already been emptied by enterprising
vandals, he managed to find a ring on the corpse which proved to be a ring of
sustenance and a silver necklace which he later sold for what little money he
has now and his few possesions. It was obvious to him that he had nowhere
near as many qualms about dealing with the dead than the earlier thieves had,
but then again, that's what being a necromancer is all about...
                The present day...
       Grimm's streak of luck continues to preserve him from his own belief in
immortality, although he has become a little bit more world wary. He tries
now to keep a good stock of defensive spells (just in case) and sometimes has
mood swings into the paranoid that can mean disaster for his travelling
companions. His speciality combined with his uncooperative attitude has
earned some attention from various authorities, though most are prepared to
dismiss him as a minimal threat to society. Indeed, his hunts for undead have
earned him occasional praise, as he restores the balance against those who
would cheat death - and any who stand in his way.

        Grimm is more than a little stressed by the life he has led so far, in
fact he's bordering on crazy. Surviving the accident, the demon and wandering
lost in the wilderness has led him to think that he may be destined never o
die. Combined with his learnings in necromancy and general society's
rejection of him, he is fast heading toward the belief that he is death
incarnate, an elemental force not to be denied, which is reflected by the
name he now choses to be known by. His monthly visits by the demon tend to
contradict this, which gives him all the more reason to hate it. It is ironic
that he would give anything to be rid of the true source of his power, and
just about the only thing at the moment that prevents him from become a
raving nutcase. He has little memory of his family, and has no desire to
associate with them again.

Description
        Lithe and muscular of build, Hnaef has the archtypical Northern
look, blond, ruddy, and dangerous.  While his friends know him as a quiet
joker, most strangers are more than a bit put off by his less than civilized
appearance. With his dog Holgar and a halting command of the common tounge,
Hnaef is generally assumed to be much more dangerous than he actually is.
Although he posseses all the skills and talents nessecarry to sucess in
combat, Hanef's companions learn quickly that he is smitten with ill luck
in combat and should not be counted upon.

Background
==========
        Born to Bercilak and Margan Scylding (who died giving birth) of
the Ozerfold clan on their steading, in the Soderfjord Jarldoms  in the
Northern Reaches.  There is minimal agriculture and food sources are
mostly derived from hunting and trade, in your region.  Berilak was greatly
affected by the loss of his wife and spent much time away from the stead on
long hunting trips in the surrounding mountains and hills.  While his
father was away, Hnaef was under the care of his Uncle Ofeig, and elder brother
Sven.  They taught you to wield the longsword, as well as train the
wolf-dogs that are used as guards on the steading.  Eventually his father
began to take him on the hunting trips, where Hnaef's ranger skills were
acquired.  At the age of 19 he obtained the permission of Vandrad Horiks
on, his clan head, and set forth by ship from Whiteheart, to explore the
world.

Beliefs instilled in upbringing
===============================
% Loyalty lies with family, clan and friends, and anyone who does not
  defend their honor is a coward.
% Hospitality and generosity are to be valued and respected.
% Wealth in itself is not a virtue.
% Courage is honorable, it is dishonorable to whine or complain.
% The gods determine fate, and wit and humor in bad times is to be valued.
% Forgiveness is a sign of weakness.
% Long discussions are pointless and should be avoided at all costs.
% One's word is binding, but to mislead by clever speech or omission (not
  lies) is neither dishonest or immoral.
% Exaggeration of ones deeds is acceptable to a point.
% Merchants, thieves and especially wizards are to be accorded little
  respect as they are sneaky, evil and dangerous, yet timid in combat.
% Priestly magics are acceptable and virtous.
% Nature is to be respected, revered and protected, and must be allowed to
  coexist with other life.

Game History
        Hnaef is most famous for his utter failure as a combat machine, to
the frequent disappointment and frustration of his player.  He never did
anything truly heroic (partially because his player was often absent) and
never really lived up to his ancestry and training.

Bolt of Tracking
Wooden Knife
Sword +2, Idrenal
elven chain +3

-=-=-=
Sword +1, Idrenal

Idrenal is a specially made +1 shortsword. In the hands of a thief, it
becomes +2. Furthermore, when Idrenal is used for a backstab attack, it
advances the thief an additional step of multiplier (i.e., x3 instead of
x2, etc.) normal to their level.

-=-=-=

Wooden Knife

It is magical knife of elven design made of magically hardened wood.
It will disregard all inorganic armor when it is
used to hit.  It will pass through plate mail, chain, any metallic armor
(but without causing the armor any damage either).
Upon the thiefs command, once per day the knife can also cause an
additional 1d6+4 magical damage to the target, whether thrown or used
in melee.

-=-=-=-=
Bolt of Tracking

 An enchanted Bolt.  No bonuses to hit or damage but if fired at a target
 & missess, instead of falling to the ground, it stays aloft & turns around
 to try again (NOTE: it could be a back attack this time).  This continues
 until either a successful hit is made or d4 tries have been attempted (not
 counting the initial to hit roll for firing the  bolt).The  bolt locks on
 one target (whether dead or alive). If a 1 is rolled on a to hit roll, a
 mis-lock occurs & the person who fired the bolt  is now the acquired
 target. Other than turning around, this bolt  does not avoid obstacles.
 As such, hitting a solid object will stop the bolt.

History :
~~~~~~~~~
        As a student at school, he persevered the fine art of magic
especially those in the way of invoker spells, but also learning the
best form of defense is offense.  An only child, he was brought up as
little spoilt as he comes from a fairly rich family.
        He is furthering his career and powers to one day return and
confront his one time best friend but now enemy ands show he was not
brought up like a coward.

        Your background is this : Leaving the school of magic when you had
graduated from a novice to a first level mage, you decided to set out on your
own and make your fortune, and leave your mark on the world.  You lived in the
Free City of Greyhawk, with wealthy parents, who were quite angry and
disapointed that you had left the security and prestige ofthe school of magic.
 You won't be able to expect much help from them...
        Before anybody new of your immanent departure from the school, you
experienced your first betrayal.  Jealous of your rise to power and eager for
your position in the school, your best friend, a novice named Jehovic, tried
to have you killed.  He bungled the attempt, and fled into the slums.  You
would have pursued him and avenged yourself, but you had made arrangements to
travel with a caravan heading south east, which was leaving the following
morning.  Saying goodbye to those you knew, you joined the van and left the
safety and comfort of Greyhawk.
        You soon became bored with the caravan, nothing exciting occured at
all, so when the van stopped at a mansion in the midle of the woods, you put
the word around the mansion servants that you were looking for adventure.  As
luck would have it, an adventuring party was staying in the Manor at this very
moment, and were planning to set off to the Hold of the Sea Princes in the
morning.  To quickly gained an audience wit hthe master of the manor, a chap
named Lirdrium Arkayz, and asked him if he could pass on the message to the
adventurers that you wished to join them.  It appears they have agreed, and a
servant has just informed you that you are being waited on at the front gates.

militant arm of the temple, initially to train as a temple guard. However, 
it was noticed by his tutors that Pellaeus had both honesty and virtue as 
well as a natural flair for the sword. 
 He was thus apprenticed to Sir Tinandis, a Knight of Guldur, who was to 
instruct Pellaeus in the codes of honour, law, combat, and ettiquette, as 
well as holy scripture. Sir Tinandis and Pellaeus rode upon many missions for
the church, and never once did Pellaeus disgrace himself or his church.
 At the age of 21, Pellaeus was formally knighted and entered into the ranks  
of the Knights of Guldur. 
 Since that time he has travelled in several adventuring companies, always
fighting for the poor and unjustly treated and spreading the word of Guldur
where it would be heard by those who would listen.

Quentin Dorvard - Bard

NON-MAGICAL ITEMS: CHAIN MAIL, WEAPONS OF PROFICIENCY, SET OF FINE

color spray, feather fall, floating disc and wall of fog)

APPEARANCE: Standing 6'11"(1.81), at weight of 74 kg(dunno how much it's
in lbs.), you may say Quentin has a light body frame. His brown hair
(he keeps it long - up to his shoulders ) nicely underlines the tanned
color of his skin, and suits his blue eyes well. He is just FILTHY HANDSOME.

Every teen-aged-girl wet dream. Everywhere he goes, they just swarm around
him. There's nothing he can do about it. His true and only love, however
(besides women, other people's pockets, and music) is STORIES. He can sit
in a tavern for hours, telling old travel and war tales (in a very charming
and interesting way). Although he presents all of them as personal
experiences, this is (as you may have guessed) false most of the time.
The audiences don't mind, as long as the tales are entertaining. He also
likes to listen to other people stories (so he can tell them later). He's
what you might call a social chameleon. His greatest weakness, however, is
his almost childish naiveness (just check his low WIS). He is utterly and
completely gullible, and is likely to be used by the simplest con-men.
He is also notorious for participating in a theft or other illegal act,
and then just going around telling his friends (and others) about it.
He just likes socializing, no matter the cost. Until now, he managed to
stay out of jail and other troubles, partly because he's  so charming,
and partly just by shear luck.

Current Adventure:
                    Temple Of Elemental Evil/Village Of Homlet ++
A lot of this adventure remains. We still haven't proceded to enter
the temple itself.

Background:

Rumpeltstiltskin was born on the 30th of November 16 years ago.
Shortly after his birth, his father died a tragic death, leaving him
in the care of his big sister, Virga, who later turned out a priest of
Torm. Not very typical for a Torm follower, Virga was a real bitch of a
half-breed (charisma of 6). We do share the same mother, who is
also a bitch - literally, although her father is the mayor of Vlac -
an elf. Nothing really interresting happened to Rumpeltstiltskin
during his childhood, apart from being one of the great wizard,
Kalkaryn's, students. Kalkaryn is not really all that smart, but
Rumpy thinks he is. Rumpeltstiltskin was of course very tired of the
way his mother behaved, so he along with his sister and some friends
headed off to Homlet to meet Rumpy's good childhood friend (yes, he
has some friends) Roger, a bard, to seek out fame and fortune.......

Background
==========

 S'questr'n was born to one of the minor noble houses of Menzoberranzan, but
was forced to leave or be killed at an early age.
 Similar to many of her kind born to a noble family she was trained in the 
arts of combat, magic, and religion.
 Unlike many of her kind she did not choose a single profession once she'd 
completed her basic training; instead S'questr'n decided to continue to 
practice all three arts. This incited the wrath of the high council and she
was ordered to either choose or die. S'questr'n instead decided to flee. She
travelled from drow city to drow city, learning from masters of each art along
the way. 
 Eventually, S'questr'n wondered into the new outpost city of Aluth-Kyorl.
She was tired of wandering and decided to settle there and continue her 
studies. 
 The council of the city was fairly inexperienced and its leader completely
out of her depth. After many botched raids and failed "crops" the city began
to run short of food. S'questr'n saw this as a chance to seize power and 
using her arts to the full gain entrance to the council chamber.
 The victory was surprisingly easy as many of the council decided to settle
old scores whilst S'questr'n fought their leader and her leftenants. 
S'questr'n then went on to kill those that remained of the council.
 Once the battle was over S'questr'n declared herself leader of the council
and appointed a new council of nobles.
 S'questr'n has survived many attempted coups and has put each down with such
easy ruthlessness that none have been attempted for many years.

Background
==========
 Sanas was born in Kinsholm, a small village near one of the forests of the 
wood elves and one of the few places of man that they visit.
 Sanas was born of an elven father and a human mother. His father left his
mother once he found she was pregnant. His mother died after his birth. Sanas 
was raised by his uncle, who ran the inn in Kinsholm.
 His childhood years were not that happy. His uncle blamed him for the death
of his mother and treated more as a servant than as his nephew. The people of
the village hated him for being a half-breed and a bastard, and the children
of the village bullied him and ridiculed him because of his elven looks.
 At the age of 15 Sanas fled Kinsholm in search of his father, whether for
vengeance or recognition no-one knew. With him Sanas took his maternal 
grandfather's sword and shield; which he still carries today.
 Sanas journeyed into the forest and was promptly captured by the elves ,who
believed him to be either thief or spy, and were about to kill him when he 
told them of his quest for his father. Sanas was taken to one of the elven
tree-villages, where he was put into the custody of his father's family.
 They told him of how his father had gone on a trading mission to one of the
border cities and had not come back; that had been two years ago. His 
father's family believed his father to be dead and urged Sanas to give up his
search. Sanas would not and left the forest two weeks later heading for the
city of Candanus.
 That was three years ago and Sanas's search for his father has lead him all
over the Kingdoms, but he knows his father is at least alive.

Name : Keldin Linsiber
Race : Human
Class : dual thief/cleric
Level : 7/4

Personality : Dry, laconic wit, holds no-one and nothing in awe, is
rarely impressed by anything anybody does.  Very cynical, and has a
tendency to overdrink, when he becomes very bitter.  Otherwise he is
usually quite joking.

Equipment : magic shortsword
            ring feather falling

Appearance : Wear's dull clothing basically, mostly greys, and leather
armour.  Very, very quick, and seems to be extremely wise with some of
his observations.  He has a face which is not ugly, but has permanent
wrinkles from his cynical frowning, and his eyes are quite dark.

Misc : Keldin is a cleric of Trithereon, God of Liberty, Justice and
Retribution.  Sometimes to your amazement, Keldin has taken damage
that would kill any normal man, yet gets back on his feet within
minutes...you are beginning to suspect something is going on.

History :
~~~~~~~~~

I was born in Veluna, to moderately wealthy parents.  (bottom of the upper
class), and grew up there. I had no other siblings. I was a solitary child,
never having any friends or ever associating with the other kids at all, I
always got on better with older people, but preferred solitude. I was always
fascinated by magic, and when I was old enough, attended a magic school in
Grayhawk City. It was there that I discovered Necromancy, and at the first
possible chance, left the school to become the apprentice of a Necromancer
living outside of Greyhawk. (ie .. in the wilderness outside Greyhawk, far
enough away to be a typical Necromancer's solitary dwelling.) My mentor wasn't
overly kind, but still wasn't overly cruel. He made me earn my keep, but
didn't overwork me. Eventually, when I became skilled enough in my Necromancy,
I left my mentor, and started adventuring.

PERSONALITY.

Telieq is a VERY controlled person. He exhibits NO show of emotion at all,
though this doesn't mean that he doesn't have emotions. As with most
Necromancers, he is withdrawn, but not humourless, however rarely shows his
sense of humour because of his high value of self control. Because of his
great control, Telieq doesn't suffer from the bouts of depression that so
many Necromancers are prone to. As with most Necromancers, Telieq prefers to
be alone, and speaks very little. Telieq dislikes having to trust and/or rely
on other people, he likes to be as self sufficient as possible.

History :
~~~~~~~~~
Tweck began life as being the 3rd son of the village leader. Not being the
eldest Tweck was not expected to become leader of the village but earned a
high standing by become the local ranger. But such a perfect tale had its
tarnished areas because Tweck was also a cleptamaniac! This may have been
seen as him trying to gain acceptance with the poorer folk, but it turned
into an even worse situation! Tweck started to enter the city at night and
commit even more daring robberies... soon he became to be know as the shadow
of Fellfurn! Greatest burgerler of the whole of Fellfurn county, robs froms
the rich and returns it if he feels like it, a very cunning theif who even
deliudes Tweck, the county ranger who is constantly on his trail...

Tyrus Wolfenbane - Fighter/Thief
================================

From: Robert Andrew <roband@au.edu.monash.cc.monu6>

Name : Tyrus Wolfenbane
Occupation : Assasains Guild Contact Man. Tyrus is one of those responsible 
for organising meetings and "hits" for the Assasain's guild in freehold. As 
such he commands a large salary and several personal guards.
Description : Tyrus is a well built man in his late 30's, standing around 6' 
tall he wears a dark beard and long black, braided hair. Often when meeting 
with "contacts", he wears a dark brown leather cloak, large balck boots and 
a dark blue or green brigga. His weapon of choice is a hand crossbow with 
poison tipped bolts. Tyrus is a strong willed man, used to giving orders 
(from several years in the Ducal Guard). He has an abrasive personality that 
irritates many people, many of whom are forced to put up with it to continue 
hiring the Guild. Tyrus is one of the few contact men who prefer meeting 
contacts in the street, often meeting in a crowded market with his guardsmen 
all around him (but unseen to the contact).

AC 7 hp 55 MV 12" Att 1 Dam 1-8 + poison (RNG:5/10/15) Thac0: 12

Tyrus' Bodyguards.
Grug - A minotaur -- the ultimate in shows of strength. Well over 8' tall 
and a wall of muscle.
Level 4 Fighter
AC 3 hp 45 MV 12" Att 2 Dam 1-8 + 3/1-8 + 3 Thac0: 12
Grug carries two hand-axes and wears chain mail over his normal hide. He is 
powerful and to all appearances stupid, but he actually is quite intelligent 
and cunning.

Mythor - A dwarf -- seemingly a merchant.
Level 3 fighter
AC 4 hp 32 MV 6" Att 1 Dam 1-10 + 1 Thac0:17
Mythor often hangs around Tyrus attempting to sell him goods, this ruse is 
used to keep him close to Tyrus but above suspicion. He carries a battle axe, 
normally kept in a stall nearby.

History :
~~~~~~~~~
Uriah was born on the island of Markesh.  His parents Elahb and Amaryiah were
merchants of high standing.  An old drifter came through the town and took a
room at the local inn.  At night, around the communal fire he took to telling
stories of far away lands, and adventures he had had in his youth.  These
stories stirred Uriah into asking the drifter, by the name of Heape, if he
could accompany him when he left the village.  The old man replied that he
could.  Two weeks later Uriah and Heape left the village.  Heape died one year
later, after passing on his starting knowledge of the fighting, healing and
arcane arts which he had picked up during his journeys.  Uriah, whose last
name was originally Tahr, took the old mans name in honour of his teachings.
He also took the two handed sword which the old man always carried with him,
and that he had bequithed to Uriah.  Uriah now carries on the old mans dream
of seeing as much as the world has to offer.

Appearance: Small tattoo of dragon on left upper chest, scar from friends
mistress on right side of groin, long dark hair and olive skin.
Quirks: Prefers the two handed sword in battle, but, if the need arises, will
fight with two handed with long and short sword .

Uriah is an outgoing chap.  He enjoys the company of friends.  In his village
he had many good friends.  However, due to the closeness of family and friends,
 he also had those that envied him, and hated him because of this.  One such
man was Chiross.  Chiross and his clan were part of the heirarchy of the
village.  However, they felt that the people were giving the leadership, and
their alliances to the Tahr clan.  Trying to disrupt this state of affairs,
Chiross sent his daughter Uma to first seduce Uriahs best friend, and then
Uriah himself, in an attempt to split them up, and discredit Uriah's family.

However, Chiross's son Jiren was not as evil as the rest of his family, and
truly wanted the village to be at peace, no matter who was in power.  So he
warned both Uriah and his friend Erale.  The lads decided to have a bit of fun
with Uma.  When she did come to seduce Uriah, he said nothing to her.  After
they had had sex, she told Uriah that she would leave Erale for him, but Erale
would have to be "gotten rid of".  Uriah told her in no uncertain terms that
he knew of her plan, and that she was as exciting to him as a dry corpse.  In
her rage, she bit him on the side of the groin, leaving him with a permanent
scar.  Uriah made the plan known to the village, and Chiross and his family
were publicly disgraced.

The Tahr clan was asked to take power in the village.  This they accepted.
Uriah, not wishing this for himself (but happy for his family), took the
option of leaving with Heape when the opportunity presented itself.  Jiren
stayed with the Tahr clan, and last Uriah heard, he had been adopted by them.

As for Chiross and his clan (including wife, daughter and other sons), Uriah
has not heard of them since the incident.

The tattoo he earned while travelling with Heape.  "The Dragons" are a misfit
clan of fighter/clerics who wander the world in search of adventure.  Uriah
saved the leaders son Maxx, and was given honarary status within the band,
which is signified by the tattoo.
