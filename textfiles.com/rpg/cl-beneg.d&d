The Bene Gesserit
 
Required stats for a Bene Gesserit are strength 15, intelligence 14,
wisdom 16, dexterity 17, constitution 16, charisma 16, and comliness 13.
The Bene Gesserit are a organization of females whose permenant mission
is the preservation of the demihuman races. This is done by their own plans and
memories. This group is highly dependent an a clear blue liquid, "Spice". They
have stockpiles of this substance but are always intrested in gaining more of
it. Bene Gesserit tend not to trust anyone other than those who passed the
test of pain. All Bene Gesserit must endure the Gom Jabber or test of pain
before they are allowed into the order.
The Bene Gesserit is set up much like a sisterhood of nuns. With each
chapterhouse having a Reverend Mother and sisters in charge of different
functions of the house. Also each chapterhouse has acolytes who do the menial
labor.
All Bene Gesserit are extensively trained in muscle control, emotion sight
reading, and extensive martial arts. As an acolyte the Bene Gesserit is
confined to the chapterhood until she has been attained the level of sister at
which time she is either given special training in one or more of the following
specific subjects :
 
  Assassination Combat
  Genetic   Government (a specific type)
  Library Science   Medecine
  Religion  Sexual Control (for mating)
 
The steps of the Bene Gesserit training are demanding, numerous and quite
complex. (for more info concerning training see next few pages) If a female
character has good enough stats
 
Acolyte training.
