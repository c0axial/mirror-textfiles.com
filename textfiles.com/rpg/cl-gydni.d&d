Re: CHURCH KNIGHTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
GYDNIAN KNIGHT

Ability Requirements: Wisdom 11, Strength 9
Prime Requisiste:     Wisdom
Races Allowed:        Dwarf, Half-elf, Human, Tesper (halfling)
Alignment Tendency:   Good

  DESCRIPTION:  The Gydnian Knights are the most recent addition to the
militant orders of Terron.  The militant orders are the strong arm of the
Church, and are sword to her service, fighting the forces of evil in whatever
lands they may be found.  Church Knights are not clergymen, but are trained in
both devotions and in arms.  They are the armed and armoured soldiers of the
Church, able to spread the blessings of Torl and do His bidding wherever they
may be.  Gydnian Knights are the most secularized and independent of the four
orders.

  REQUIREMENTS:  A Gydnian Knight must be of good and honourable ethics.  He
must have a wisdom score of at least 11 and a strength of 9.  Good constitution
is also a boon.  Church Knights use the XP, HP and THAC0 of priests.

  WEAPONS/ARMOUR ALLOWED:  Church Knights may use any armour, although they may
have problems preforming miracles and blessings while using a shield.  The
formal armour of Gydnian knights is black plate mail, although they may wear
whatever armour they wish outside of formal occasions.  All knights are
required to learn the use of a three-headed flail in combat, after the fashion
of their god [Torl is said to possess a 3-headed flail, you can modify this as
needed].  This is a Gydnian knight's main weapon, although he may also learn to
fight with knives, daggers, one-handed swords (for duelling) and lances.  A
knight is expected to use his flail at all times in battle, except when
duelling, charging on horseback, or in tight situations where a flail would be
impractical.

  DIVINE BLESSINGS:  Not all Church Knights are given the gift to bestow
blessings and miracles in Torl's name at the same rate.  There is a 20% chance
per level of the knight being given the gift.  Frequent devotions and
meditations can increase this chance as the DM wishes.  The check is made
cumulatively every level, but regardless of the result the knight cannot begin
to advance in his miracles until his ordination at 3rd level (ie.  a novice
that can bestow blessings at 1st level will stay at that ability level until
reaching 3rd level, upon which he will begin to advance).  The chance of
gaining the gift cannot exceed 90%.  Regardless of the level the knight
receives the gift he begins casting spells as if 1st level and proceeds from
there.  Torl's worshippers do not need to state at the beginning of each day
which miracles they intend to bestow.  Instead they may choose them as needed,
though Torl will only grant them a certain number per day, and may refuse to
bestow the blessing if He wishes.  [Now, I have my own specific spell list made
up for what clerical spells Church Knights have access to, but it's too lengthy
to print.  To use the sphere method, I would suggest giving knights Major
access to War, Guardian and Protection, and minor access to healing and Law.]
  GRANTED POWERS:  A Church Knight is surrounded by Torl's blessing, which
gives him a +1 bonus to his armour class against supernaturally evil beings
(demons, undead, etc, but not your average orc).  A bonus of +1 is also given
to saving throws versus attacks by evil creatures.  This takes effect as soon
as the individual enters the knighthood as a novice.
  As well, a novice Church Knight can attempt to turn undead by calling upon
Torl.  This power increases as the knight gains in levels, and it is often
aided by the use of a silver pendant received during initiation.

  The Knights of the Church are immune to charm spells cast by a creature known
by the knight to be evil or hostile.
  Upon reaching 3rd level, when the novice takes his oath and becomes a fully-
fledged knight, the following powers are gained:
  The strength of Torl's blessing increases, giving both the knight and any
within 10 feet of him the +1 bonuses against evil creatures noted above.  This
replaces the earlier blessing and is not cumulative with it or the blessings of
other church knights.
  Upon their ordination, Church Knights gain the ability to sense supernatural
evil within 60 feet.  Normally the knight must state when he is wishing to use
this ability, and all that can be gleaned is the relative strength and general
direction of the evil.  In some cases however, primordial beings of extreme
evil may become evident to the knight without his needing to concentrate.  THis
sense takes one round to use.
  At 5th level, a Church Knight -may- be given the responsibility of training
1d4 novices.  These novices obey the knight without question, though the knight
cannot order them into life-threatening situations.  Because they have not yet
taken their oath to sacrifice their lives if necessary, it is the
responsibility of the commanding knight to keep them out of serious danger.
The knight does not pay the novices, but is expected to provide for their
lodging along with his own.  It is normal for novices to share in bounty
accumulated from adventures, but it is not required.  The novices will stay
with the knight for only a few adventures, and then will leave when it is time
for them to take their oath.  Knights who mistreat their novices will have to
answer to the governor of their chapterhouse or the preceptor of the order.

  At 8th level the knight may be given 1d4 newly-ordained knights as aides.
The knights act like henchmen, and will generally pay for themselves, although
they expect a fair share of bounty.  The 1-4 aides have taken their oath and
will follow the knight to the death if necessary.  Though they are sword to
obey a superior they can question his actions and may report him to the
preceptor if there are problems.

Hmm.  I'm out of time on this call, have to finish this later.  Sorry to break
in the middle.
