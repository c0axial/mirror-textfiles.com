THE CRUSADER(Paladin)

DESCRIPTION : The Crusader is the front-line of defense of the
holy order (of their particular Diety). He is modeled after the
Paladin but instead can be of any alignment and of any Diety.

    Requirements to be a Crusader are : 12 Strength, 14 Wisdom, 12
Dexterity, and a 14 Constitution.

ROLE : The Crusader's duty is the guarding of religeous objects,
protecting sacred grounds and spreading the range of his holy order.
Any additional duties may be placed on the Crusader depending upon
his diety.

SECONDARY SKILLS : If Secondary Skills are used then a Crusader
generally will have either Armorer or Bowyer/Flecther.

WEAPON PROFICIENCIES : If the Crusader is a Fighter then the
initial wepon is the Longsword. If the Crusader is a Cleric then
the initial weapon is a  WarHammer or Mace. Additional weapons
include : Flail, MorningStar, Shortbow, Lasso. As to specialization
see the Special Hindrances section.

NONWEAPON PROFICIENCIES : Bonus proficiencies: Religeon,
Blind-Fighting Recommended: Warrior- Tracking General-
Riding Land-Based, Direction Sense.

EQUIPMENT : A Crusader starts out with the weapon of choice (IE The
first chosen proficiency), a suit of Chain, a shield and 1d8x10
gold worth of supplies issued by his order.

SPECIAL BENEFITS : If the character is a fighter then the character
recieves the spell abilities of a Priest 1 level lower. If the
character is a cleric he is able to specialize in a weapon at
double the normal cost.

SPECIAL HINDRANCES : If the character is a Fighter then weapon
specialization costs double the normal slot cost. A fighter also
may not select any other bladed weapons after the first sword. If
the character is a cleric then he casts spells at 1 level lower
than normal.
   General Restrictions : No weapons other than the preferred
weapons may be selected. Twenty-five percent of all gained moneys
must be donated to the church when on a mission, only 10% must be
given when adventuring "on his own".

RACES : Any race with an actual diety may be a Crusader, including
demi-god dieties.

NOTE : Only Fighters and Clerics may be a Crusader. Normal racial\class
restrictions still apply. IE Halflings can not be clerics, so only
Halfling fighters may be Crusaders. Clerics cannot use edged weapons
so a cleric Crusader may not use a sword or edged arrows.

  Also, Crusader's are rarely called this and the name varies from
diety to diety. For example, Guardian is the name of the Halfling
Crusader of Avoreen. (NOT official folks!)
