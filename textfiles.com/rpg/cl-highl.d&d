Highlander

There are a few changes that have to be made in this, but this is the basic
idea....
Originally in a local D&D campaign a player decided to "convert"
the AD&D cavelier to D&D and when succeding in doing this he
promptly named it the Highlander (Based on the fact that we had
just recently seen the movie of the same name.)
As much as the class had against it, the name stuck. So I became
determined to rewrite the class entirely so that it was worthy of
it's name. Here goes.....
The Highlander is a clan oriented fighter. Trained from early on
in his life to properly wield the clan weapon and often how to
forge it. The honor of the family name is proudly shown on almost
all weapons and on all armour and shields. Their skill with the
clan weapon exceeds most experinced men early on. The Headmaster
of each clan brandishs the symbol of his power in battle. It is
known only as the Kinsweapon (no matter what clan it is.) This
weapon, is the symbol of the clan and the most valued item of the
clan.
 Clans often intermarry with most distant relatives or with other
clans.
Bloodfueds occasionally errupt between opposing clans which often
end with the extinction of an entire clan. The only other
alternative is to acquire the Kinsweapon of the opposing clan.
GM Notes:
The Highlander is a specialist fighter. He only need have the
minimum ability scores for a fighter, no others. Outside of that
there are a few restrictions that the character MUST adhere to in
order to remain anything other than a normal fighter. It is  the
code of the Highlander.
1: The character MUST specialize in one of the melee weapon
proficiencies as per the chart listed below in this document.
Only a Dagger proficiency may be taken as an additional MELEE
weapon. A bow may be taken as an additional proficency but only
if it used ONLY for hunting.
   Clan Weapon
  The clan weapon is chosen as per the chart below.
   3d10        Weapon
   3- 7       Battle Axe
   8-10       Warhammer
  11-12       Mace
  13-15       Pole Arm (any)
  15-22       Sword (Includes Sickle. Choose 1!)
  23-24       Spear,Javalin,Trident
  25-27       Flail, Morning Star
    28        Paired (One Handed) Weapon (no negatives)
    29        Weapon and Shield (Addtional +1 to shield
                      bonus if in use.)
    30        Choice
2: The character must NEVER use a weapon that is not that of his
clan. (The weapon chosen to meet the above condition is his clan
weapon.) Violating this will result in a loss of face in the clan
which can only be regained in the same manner as a paladin must,
that of a quest assigned by the head of the clan.
3: Always respect the Elders of a Clan. Whether or not a
Bloodfeud is in effect can influence this. Traditional clan
enemies occasionally are treated with spite but still with some
respect.
4: Never refuse a call to bloodfued. Many times throughout
history decade long wars have occurred between opposing clans.
Failing to acknowledge a call to Bloodfued is a self-banishment
from the clan. If a character refuses to acknowledge a call he
becomes a Wanderer with all GAINED abilities retained but from
that point on he gains no more and progresses as a normal
fighter. However he must still retain the code of the Highlander,
even if he changes classes.
5: Cannot keep more treasure than can carry (or invest in his way of
living. I.E. A new farming mule)
For adhering to this code the character gains the following
abilities.
1: Uses any armor or weapon that a fighter can use.
2: Saves and attacks as per a fighter of the same level.
3: 1 addtional attack every third round (repeating) for every
third level starting at one. (Note that the additional attacks
are spaced out. For example an 11th level Highlander with 4 bonus
attacks would have 3 attacks first round, 2 second and 2 third.)
4: Fighter exceptional strength and constitution bonuses.
A Highlander gains levels as per the chart below.
Level      Hit Dice     Experience
  1          1d10          0 - 1850
  2          2d10       1851 - 3700
  3          3d10       3701 - 7400
  4          4d10       7401 - 18500
  5          5d10      18501 - 37000
  6          6d10      37001 - 74000
  7          7d10      74001 - 138750
  8          8d10     138751 - 259000
  9          9d10     259001 - 536500
 10          9d10+2   536501 - 814000
  It is recommended that in your campaign that this class be limited to a
particular race in a specific part(s) of your gaming world.
