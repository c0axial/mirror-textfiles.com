Figured I'd also send you the Meistersinger, 'cause it might fit well
into the rural background T'lyse has...

Specialty: Pied Piper/Animal Charmer.
Qualifications: Standard ability scores. Elves can become Meistersingers
    and reach 15th level.
Introduction: <upon request: if you get me an address,
                   I can snail it all>
Description: Meistersingers wander the woodlands, mountains, and
    deserts, seeking out hose who will listen to their songs. Unlike
    other bards, Meistersingers rarely perform for humankind. They
    tailor their music to the tunes of nature. Their audiences are the
    birds, the bees, and the behemoths.
         Meistersingers have wandered unsettled lands sinc ethe dawn of
mankind. Loremasters tell tales about how the ancient dryads and nymphs
would find lost human children and teach them the ways of the forest.
Others were taken in by druids. Over the years, these children of nature
have evolved into a definable class of character -- the Meistersinger.
Whether these tales are true or not, Meistersingers do exist.
    The concerns of Meistersingers center around nature, especially
animals. Lawful neutral, true neutral, and chaotic neutral
Meistersingers see themselves as one with nature (although each views
the structure of nature differently). They protect animals as humans
protect those of their society. Neutral good Meistersingers look upon
animals as innocent children who should be isolated and protected from
the harsh and uncaring realms of civilization. Neutral evil
Meistersingers see animals as subjects to be controlled and exploited.
They use animals as some lords use slaves. True neutral Meistersingers
are closest to druids in the way they look upon animals.
    ROLE: Meistersingers are the mortal enemies of ruthless and
profiteering hunters, trappers, and fishermen. They believe such
activities should occur only when the game is needed for survival and no
part of the animal is wasted.
    Forests, deserts, and mountains are the typical arena for the
adventuring Meistersinger. Rarely does a Meistersinger adventure
anywhere unless animals are somehow involved -- as moutns, as
companions, or perhaps as captives who need to be set free.
    SECONDARY SKILLS: <nobody uses these, do they?>
    WEAPON PROFICIENCIES: The following are forbidden: harpoon, lances,
mancatcher, polearms, and trident.
    As a hunter and woodsman, they must maintain a variety of weapons.
At 1st level, they must select one melee and one missile weapon. EAch
add'l slot must be spent in the following repetitive sequence: hurled,
melee, missile.
    NON-WPN PROFS: Bonuses: Animal Lore, Musical Instrument, Singing,
Survival.
    ARMOR/EQUIPMENT: Standard.
SPECIAL BENEFITS
    Song of Companionship: At 1st, 5th, and 10th levels, a Meistersinger
can play the Song of Companionship, which lasts for 2d12 hours. An
animal companion will appear and stay with the character until slain.
The death of either can kill the survivor. If the Meistersinger loses a
companion, and doesn't die, the Meistersinger will go into deep mourning
for 101 days, during which adventuring stops. Replacements may be gained
after level advancement.
    Song of Sanction: This song envelops the Meistersinger, creating a
nearly magical barrier of good will around him. Any attacking animal or
monster must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation with a -1 penalty per
three levels of the Meistersinger or ignore the Meistersinger and those
within one foot per level of him for as long as the song is played. The
effect of the song is ended if the Meistersinger attempts to move or if
anyone in the protected area attacks.
    Animal Charm: If the Meistersinger concentrates, he can attempt to
charm one animal within view by his singing. Only an animal of Hit Dice
equal to or less than the Meistersinger's level can be affected.
Furthermore, the total HD of all such charmed animals accompanying the
character cannot exceed twice his level.
    The song takes 1d10 rounds, but the animal is held temporarily
spellbound during the performance, as long as no hostile advances are
made upon it. After 1d10 rounds, the monster rolls a ST vs. plz. w/a -1
penalty per three levels of the Meistersinger. If it fails, it is under
the effects of a Charm spell. If it succeeds, it is unaffected and acts
normally. If the roll was a natural 20, the animal is enraged and
immediately attacks the character.
    Influence Reactions: As the True Bard's ability, but only on
animals.
    SPECIAL HINDRANCES: Meistersingers do not gain followers, nor do
they build typicaly strongholds. Their animal companions serve as their
followers, and they tend to build several small cottages or huts
throughout the lands they patrol...
