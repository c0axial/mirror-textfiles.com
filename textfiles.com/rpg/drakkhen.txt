1> EQUIP YOUR CHARACTER!  You start the game with equipment, but none of
it is readied.

2> Enter the very first castle you see.  One of the red symbols will turn
off the force fields.  Touching the wrong one will cause monsters to
appear.  If you win the combat, leave the castle and save the game.  You
will be able to aquire experience this way.  Explore the castle and you
will find better armor and weapons.

3> Up the stairs and to the left you will find the Prince's apartments. 
When you enter each room, be sure that you are not in "auto-attack" mode,
or the Prince will walk all over you.  The Prince will give you a message
to take to his sister, and directions to the castle.

4> Go to the Princess of Earth's castle, and the return to the Prince of
Earth.  He will give you (bad) directions to the next castle, the Prince
of Water's.

5> Use the "unlock" spell to hold the drawbridge open.  Go thru the
castle, and you will pick up some AWESOME armor and weapons.  If you find
that you cannot survive in here, you need to either TRAIN or VISIT THE
WEAPONSMITH (see note below).

6> From this point, I had no clue what to do, but stumbled across it
anyway.  From the WeaponSmith's go north to the Prince of Air's castle. 
You should recieve a ring that will lead you to the Princess of Air's
castle (due west, in case you have trouble finding it).

7> In the Princess of Air's castle go thru the first door to the right, and
the continue along until you find the Princess of Earth.  She give you her
gem, and tell you to go to the Princess of Water's castle (which until this
point has been impossible to enter).  From this point the gameflow was very
easy to follow.


8> Visit the Princess of Water, and she will tell you to go kill the
Prince of Earth (he's a weenie. piece of cake, really), and give you a
real nice weapon and some cool armor to help you.

9> Kill the Prince of Earth and take his gem.

10> Return to the Princess of Water.  She will give you her gem, and
direct you to the Princess of Fire's castle (again, you should not have
been able to enter here yet... I was able to, I assume this is a bug). 

11> At the Princess of Fire's castle you will get yet another gem. And you
will meet the Prince of Air, who will instruct you to kill his sister, the
Princess of Air.

12> Kill the Princess of Air and take her gem.  (Another easy combat,
compared with what is to follow...)  On leaving the castle the Prince of
Air will meet you and give you his gem.  He will note that you do not have
the Prince of Water's gem (real swift ain't he?), and tell you to go get
him.  Also he tells you that the armies of the conspiracy surround the
Prince of Fire (go team go! :-).

13> Go to the Prince of Water's castle.  You will find him where there,
even though he was not there the last time you entered.

  This is currently where I am at.  This dude is one TOUGH cookie!  All my
characters are level 8 or 9, and he keeps hitting them with 100+ point
fireballs!  Talk about a quick combat!  So far my most successful tactic
was to cast "paralyze" on him and then attack him with a shield-ed,
invisible character (protection = 104).  No dice as of yet.


NOTES:

TRAINING- When you are low level, you can increase your experience by
deliberatly touchiing the wrong elemental symbol in the foyer of any
castle with symbols, and then killing them.  Over, and over, and over....

WEAPONSMITH- Following the road north from the Princess of Earth (or the
Princess of Water), you will find the WeaponSmith's.  This is a good place
to visit if you find yourself getting killed a lot.  He will sell you some
improved armor and weapons over what you start with.  If you play your
cards right, you can get MUCH MUCH better equipment than the WeaponSmith
has from various castles.

AUTO-ATTACK- Unless you are certain that you are in a hostile castle (like
the Prince of Water's), it is a good idea NOT to have "auto-attack" on. 
When you meet a new creature, hit the greet button.  If it responds with
something like "You seem to be glorious warriors..."  or "Hello.."  or
something that does not seem terribly unfriendly, leave them alone and
they won't bother you!  This is EXTREMELY important when dealing with the
Dragon Princes!
