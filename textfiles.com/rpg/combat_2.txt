	THE REVISED COMBAT SYSTEM FOR ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
	                 by Kevin L. Seachrist
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have uploaded to MPGN (ftp.mpgn.com) a copy of a major combat system 
revision I've been putting together over several months.  I posted it 
on the ADND-L mailing list and received quite a bit of feedback in the 
months following.  Dragon Magazine is currently considering its 
publication

Combat II is a unified system which successfully integrates physical 
combat, movement, and spell/psionic use on one time scale.  It assumes 
the use of miniatures as well as the playing group's concerns for 
better "realism" and battle tactics than what the Players Handbook 
offers.

Coupled with the Phase Initiative System, at the heart of Combat II is 
the
Magic System (which incorporates two versions of mana points).  You 
will also find some miscellaneous rules concerning several integrated 
"critical hit/miss rules."  The files may be FTP'ed from mpgn 

	Look for the file COMBAT_2.ZIP  under /Games/AD&D/Rules.

The zip contains the WinWord 6.0-formatted version of all the rules, as 
well an Excel 5.0 version of the System's accompanying character 
records. 

I can E-mail a text copy of the system upon request.  While the hours 
of painstaking formatting are lost in the text version, you'll still 
get the lowdown from your E-Mail copy.

Just another set of house rules?  Have a look...
