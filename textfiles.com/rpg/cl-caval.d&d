        Here is the Cavalier Kit!  If I can't be one I'll be a Paladin.

DESCRPITION:
        The Cavalier is the Ultimate Mounted Warrior of civilized
cultures, especially those of Middle Age technology and outlook.  In a
campaign, he's the shining knight who leads his fellows on a eternal
quest for truth, justice, and the elimination of evil.  To the world at
large, he's a mighty hero.  To his friends and allies, he's a staunch
friend, a tireless cheerleader, and often an overentusiastic pain in the
neck.
        This is a good Warrior Kit for Paladins to take.  It can be
argued that paladins look something like this already, but that isn't
nessecarily so: Only paladins of cultures resembling medevil Europe
would look like this (a paladin of Japanesse culture, a paladin of a
Polynesian-like culture, and a paladin resembling a later Renaissance
Europe would all be different from a Cavalier).  Therefore, a Paladin
who wants to look every inch like a shining knight would take this kit.
        The Cavalier kit ressembles the Noble Warrior kit (I don't need
to post that one) in that both are Noblemen Warrior is primarly
interested in defending the rights and maintaining the status quo of his
social class, while the Cavalier pursues loftier goals.
        To be a Cavalier, the character must be of good alignment
(chaotic good, neutral good, or lawful good) and have atleast the
following minimum ability scores: Strenght of 15, Dexterity of 15,
Constitution of 15, Intelligence of 10, and a Wisdom of 10.
        Also the character belong to the noble class in the campaign.
It's up to the DM to determine whether this is possible. If the campaign
uses a random die-roll to determine who's nobility and who isn't, then
the character must first successfully roll to be noble in order to be a
Cavalier.  If it's more of a role-playing exercise in the campaign, then
any character takes the Cavalier Kit is made nobility (That doesn't mean
that he has the money; it's quite likely he belongs to an impoverish
noble family, one with lot of honorable traditions, but no money to show
for it).
        Fighters and Paladins may be Cavaliers; Rangers may not.  Only
humans, elves, and half-elves may be Cavaliers.

ROLE:
        In his own and similar cultures, the Cavalier is a mighty hero
who has the respect of the majority of the population (the criminal
classes and evil character expected).  He has the good-will of the
people (reflected as bonuses to his reaction rolls), but the people also
make many demands of him.  When there's danger, when someone is in
trouble, the people turn to the Cavalier for help.  This character does
not get much time for rest and relaxation.

WEAPON PROFICIENCIES:
        Required: Lance (any; player's choice) and sword (any; player's
choice). Recommended: All other Lances, all other swords, all Horsemen's
weapons, Dagger, Spear, Javelin.

NON-WEAPON PROFICIENCIES:
        Bonus proficiences: Riding-Land-Horse, Etiquette.  Recommended:
Animal Training, Dancing, Heraldy, Musical Insturments, Reading\Writing,
Blind-fighting, Endurance.

EQUIPMENT:
        The Calvalier must start play with (i.e. spend his inital gold
on) at least two weapons including a lance, and a sword, and then must
buy the most expensive set of armor he can still afford.  After those
expentures, whatever remains of his gold can be spent on items of his
choice.

SPECIAL BENEFITS:
        The Cavalier enjoys many special benifits including:
              * At 1st level, he gets a +1 to hit with any lance he has
                proficiency, when using the lance from horseback.  This
                goes up 1 with every 6 levels (so he'll get +2 at 7th
                level, +3 at 13th level, ect.).
              * At 3rd level, he gets a +1 to hit with any one type of
                sword (his choice from among those he has proficiency
                with; most common are broad sword, long sword, bastard
                sword, and scimitar).  This goes up +1 every six
                experience levels (so he'll be +2 at 9th level, +3 at
                15th, etc.).
              * At 5th level, he gets a +1 to hit with either horseman's
                mace, horseman's flail, or horseman's pick (his choice
                from among those he has proficiency with).  This goes up
                +1 every six experience levels (so he'll be +2 at 11th
                level, +3 at 17th level, etc.).  These pluses to dit do
                not add to damage, and don't allow the Cavalier to hit a
                monster that can only be hit by magical weapons.
              * The Cavalier is completely immune to the fear spell.
                Because he is so brave, he inspires others to courage,
                and so, while he is fighting he actually radiates an
                emotion spell in a 10' radius.  This emotion spell
                radiates courage (see the writeup for 4th-level wizard
                spell emotion), but only to the extent that it negates
                fear, it does not bestow the berserk fury that the
                actual wizard spell provides.
              * The Cavalier is +4 to save vs. all magic which would
                affect his mind, such as the wizard spells charm person,
                friends, hypnotism, sleep, irritation, ray of
                enfeeblement, scare, and geas, and the clerical spells
                command, charm person or mammal, enthrall, cloak of
                bravery, and symbol.
              * The Cavalier starts play with a horse which he does not
                have to pay for.  This will be either a Heavy Warhorse,
                Medium Warhorse, or Light Warhorse
