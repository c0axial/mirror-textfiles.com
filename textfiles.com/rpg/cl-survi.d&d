Subject: The Survivor
 
Hello again!  Here is the next New Class I am posting for you people: The
Survivor!  Now, you are asking yourself "What is the Survivor?  Who is this
schmuck?"  Well, the schmuck is me, Marshall Ryan Maresca, Penn State Student,
creator of new AD&D classes.  As for the Survivor, well, first I'll say this.
When you roll stats, and you get an 18, how do you decide where to put it?
Well, this is usually an easy decision: Strength if you're a fighter, Dexterity
if you're a Thief, Intelligence if you're a mage, and Wisdom if you're a
Priest, right.  What about Constitution and Charisma.  There are no classes
specifically for those two.  Well, Charisma I'll do later, but for Constitution
there is the Survivor!  So.......
Requirements: Con 9
Prime Requisite: Constitution
Fights as a Rogue, Saves as a fighter.
hit dice: d12 (+3 after 9th level)
Armor Allowed: Up to chain mail, but no shields.
Weapons Allowed: Any Non-missle weapon.  Weapons that can be hand weapons as
well as thrown weapons suffer the Non-proficiency penalty when thrown.
Special Abilities:
  +2 to Saving Throws
  Fighter Constitution Hit point bonus
  Magic Resistance: The Survivor gets Magic Resistance at 5% per level, which
becomes a maximum of 90% at 18th level.
  Damage Resistance: On each hit against a Survivor, he can resist some of the
damage from the hit.  No matter what, he always takes 1 point of damage from
the hit.      Level               Damage Resisted
                1                     1-4
                3                     2-5
                5                     1-6
                7                     2-7
                9                     1-8
               11                     2-9
               13                    1-10
               15                    1-12
               17                    2-16
               19                    1-20
  At this point, it should be stated that Survivors are NOT Warriors!  Do not
think of them as such.
  As for races, Dwarves, Half-Elves and Gnomes can all be Survivors.  It can
also Multi-class in those races.
  Here is the experience point table for Survivors.

          1                       0

          3                    4000
          4                    8000

         10                  500000
         11                  750000
         12                 1000000
           and another 250000 per level.
  Well, enjoy the Survivor!  Next Class- The Demagogue: Talk your way out of a
tough situation!
