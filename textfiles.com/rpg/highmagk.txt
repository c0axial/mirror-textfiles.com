I took the time to reformat this for 70 columns... hope it helps.
I know you already did this once, but some of the columns were still a
little skewed... oh well.

==============================
The System of Correspondencies
==============================
You want high magic? Here's high magic for you.  This is the system I
use.  It's based on extremely ancient and accurate systems.

How to use the System of Correspondencies: every corresponding element
you use while casting your spell adds one bonus (whatever system);
every opposing element present at the time is one penalty.  Every
object six units away is considered an opposing element (i.e.  tin
opposes gold and mercury, because both are six away).

Example: you want to cast a healing spell.  Healing comes under the
auspices of Taurus.  What time of the year is it? What time of the day
is it (and wait until 5:00 or 6:00 if possible for maximum effect)?
What planet is in ascension at the time? (apply bonuses and penalties
as necessary).  Now, a copper rod would add a bonus; a hornbeam rod
wrapped in copper is better still.  Including mint, thyme or tansy
into the potion or incantation (mixed into a muddy (earthen) paste,
NOT boiled because Water is the opposing element!).  Apply black runes
to the head.  Repeat six times.  Offer a cow in sacrifice, and perform
the ritual in a field if possible.  Et cetera; you get the idea.
