There are many different kinds of SCA events, and going to your first
event can be a bit scary.  You might wonder what the event will be like
and what things you will need to bring.  In general, there a indoor
events (Coronation/12th Night) and outdoor events (Tournaments).  ther
are, of course, other events that don't fit these general categories
(Game tourneys, picnics, The Festival of the Rose, etc.).  Check the
Newsletter for information about the day's activities; call the Autocrat
if you have any questions.

Outdoor events:

Planning:  Check the schedule for the event.  Most SCA Tournaments last
all day, from set-up in the morning to Closing Court in the (late)
afternooe and on to a Revel in the evening.  What do you need to plan
for? Something youSonething to wear, a place to sit during the day, lunch
and some activity that interests you.  Something to wear-- the basic
tenet of the SCA is that everyone makes an attempt to wear a medieval or
renaissance costume.  For a Tournament this can be as fancy or as simple
as you wish. Clothing for outdoor events is often termed Field Costume or
Field Garb. This means the outfit is easily washable but can range from a
simple tunic through Elizabethan.  Simple costumes for your first event
can be obtained from Gold Key or you can construct your own.  There are
costuming articles in the Known World Handbook as well as in the Compleat
Anachronist pamphlet series.

    A Place to Sit-- In some parks, all you need is a blandket to spead
out under the trees; in others you will need some type of a sunshade an
your own chair (a director's chair is pretty standard).  Find out if
there are others going to the event who will let you share their sunshade
or pavilion.  If not, a simple sunshade with aluminum poles can be
cheaply purchased.  Eventually you will want to replace the poles with
wood poles or replace the sunshade with a more period pavilion.

Lunch:  occasionally there is food for sale at at Tournament but usually
you will need to provide lunch for yourself.  A satisfying lunch can be
made form lunch meats, bead rools, cheese, raw vegetables, dessert and
something to drink.  All of this can be purchased in a market and carried
to the event in a small cooler or ice chest (Covered!-C).  Of course,
more elaborate meals can also be planned (see the Known World Handbook
for articles)  You will also need some basic utensils; a plate, goblet,
bowl and eating utensils.  These can be obtained at Cost Plus and other
similar stores at a reasonable cost (C:- a local chain akin to Pier One
Imports).

Activities-  While you may be perfectly content at your first event to
sit and watch, you may also want to bring something to do during slow
moments.  You may want to bring some type of needlework to work on or
other type of handwork (leatherwork, macrame), a game board such as
backgammon or chess, or a sketch pad.  You may also wnat to get involved
in the events going on. Volunteer to help the Mistress of Lists, learn
Field Heraldry, be a Marshall in Training, offer to help the Autocrat.

Opening Court-- This is when the King and Queen (and/or Baron and
Baroness) address the populace, announcements for the day are made,
awards given out and presentations are done.  Everyone should attend
court and should be as quiet as possible out of respect for the Crown
and in order to hear what's going on.

Lists-- this is a term you will see in the schedule for the day.  It has
several different (but connected) meanings.  it is another term for the
fighting competition, as in 'fighting in lists' or 'the winner of the
lists'.  It also refers to signing up in order to fight in the
competition as in "Lists will open at 9:00' and 'Lists are now closed'.
Lastly, it refers also to the order of combat in the competition.

Fighting begins--  The fighting portion of the Tournament starts.
Tourneys are generally double-eliminations (which means a fighter has two
deaths before he or she is eliminated from the competition) and are held
in rounds.  Often there is an opening general melee in which all the
fighters participate.

Closing court--  At the end of the day, after the final round of the
fighting portion of the day, closing court is held.  Again the King and
Queen (and/or Baron and Baroness) address the populace, announcements are
made, contest winners are named and generally the winner of the fighting
is honored.

Revel-- this is an SCA-style party.  It is usually held several hourse
after the end of a Tourney, giving people time to go out to dinner.  The
revel is often held at a separate site away from the Tourney location.
There may be dancing, entertainment, contests, a bardic circle, and
evening court and light refreshments. It's a wonderful time to meet new
people, talk and relax.
