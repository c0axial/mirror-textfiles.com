Renavated class -- Monk

A monk character is in a class by itself. All monks must practice
rigorous mental and physical training and discipline to achieve their
powers. Therefore they must always be lawful in alignment. A monk who
for any reason loses this lawful alignment loses all monk abilities
and must begin again as a first level character. To become a monk, a
character must be human, have a strength of not less than 13, a
minimum dexterity of 16, a constitution of 11 or more, and not less
than 15 wisdom (Monks may have the exceptional strength and the
additional constitution adjustment of fighters.). If a monk has both
dexterity and wisdom in excess of 16, he or she gains the benefit of
adding 10% to the experience points awared by the Dungeon Master.

Notes Regarding Special Abilities:
Each special ability is designated by a capital letter.

 A.At level 3, a superior sense of balance is learned. A bonus of +20%
 (+4 saves) vs. factors that would throw a monk off balance (ie. dex
 checks vs. falling off a cliff or better AC vs. being thrown by
 another monk).

 B.At 4th level, the monk may begin studies of the anatomy of other
 species, at the rate of 1 attempt per 2 levels (ie. another species
 at levels 6, 8, etc). The anatomies of standard races can be learned
 automatically (ie. dwarves, elves, gnomes, hal-elves, halflings, and
 half-orcs). Chance for learning the anatomies of other species
 depends on their frequency. The base chance for common monsters is
 80%, 70% for uncommon, 45% for rare, 5% for very rare, and -10% for
 singular entities, plus 1% per point of the monk's wisdom.

 C.When a monk is brought to 0 hit points, he does not lose
 consciousness, although he continues to lose 1 hit point a round and
 is subject to furthur damage. A 5th level monk can continue to act
 until down to -1 hp. This decreases by 1 per level (-2 at 6th, -3 at
 7th, etc) until a minimum of -10 at 14th level. As soon as the monk
 reaches his minimum, consciousness is lost. As soon as -10 hp is
 reached, the monk dies. While still conscious, the monk may still
 attack, run, even drink healing potions or bandage his own wounds so
 that when he loses consciousness, he will be returned to the hit
 point total at the time he first bandaged himself, and not lose
 anymore hit points. However, additional damage (ie. from enemies)
 must be subtracted from this total. To hit, AC, saves, damage rolls
 (down to 0), and movement rate all suffer a penalty equal to the
 monk's hit point total (ie. a 14th level monk at -4 hp gets a -4
 penalty on everything). This power results from the almost
 super-human endurance that the monk has learned against pain and
 shock.

 D.Self-induced catalepsy to appear dead by lowering body temperature
 and heart rate for a number of turns equal to twice his level (ie. 12
 turns at 6th). In addition, multiple attacks vs. slow moving (ie.
 armor-clad) foes. At 6th level, 1 bonus attack per round vs. those
 with 6" movement. 2 attacks vs. 3" movement at 7th level. 3 attacks
 vs. 1" or immobile at 8th. A direct result of the incredible speed of
 the monk, both in running and with open-"hand" attacks.

 E.Ability to heal damage on own body, 1d4 +1 hit points a day. 1d4 +2
 hp at 8th level, 1d4 +3 hp at 9th, etc. Or heal half that amount on
 someone else (round up). Also, when dodging, 1/2 damage if save is
 failed (ie. vs. fireball); does not work vs. ie. petrification.

 F.Sixth sense fighting. Even when other 5 senses fail (ie. deaf and
 blind), can still continue combat, but must parry. Parry is at -2,
 but may follow up with no penalty to hit.

 G.18% resistance to ESP, psionics, and other mind affecting spells
 (ie. those where wisdom affects saves). Resistance increases 7% per
 level thereafter, until a maximum of 95% at 20th level. Saving throws
 apply if resistance fails.

 H.In the follow-up disarm after a parry, ability to smash weapon.
 Must roll (bonuses apply) 5 over the minimum number needed to disarm.
 Magical weapons are allowed saving throws vs. crushing blow, with
 each plus counting as a save bonus (ie. a sword +1 saves at +1).

 I.Diseases and poisons do not take affect less than 12 hours after
 exposure. Before that time, the monk may meditate one hour to cure
 his disease, or two hours to cure all poisons. Through meditation,
 able to survive extreme temperatures (not fireballs, etc; only desert
 or arctic like condidtions), hunger, thirst, or lack of air of a
 number of days equal to twice the monk's level. Can only walk or swim
 slowly during this time. Exertion (ie. running or combat) has a 10%
 cumulative chance, per round of continuous exertion, of causing loss
 of consciousness for one hour (but will survive if no creature
 attacks or the like).

 J.A 12th level monk is allowed one roll on the Table of Psionic
 Disciplines - Minor Devotions. This ability is performed at the
 monk's current level, with 20 pseudo-psionic strength points usable
 only for this ability.

 K.Through uninterrupted meditation for an hour, the monk will achieve
 ethereality for a number of turns equal to his level. During this
 time, he may act freely (ie. pass through walls, exit the dungeon,
 leave jail cells and chains). He may then find a safe location to
 materialize, which he may do by himself or when the ethereal duration
 ends. Note, all the monk's possessions, however, do not become
 ethereal, so the monk must retrieve them when he is solid.

Armor: none. Shield: none. Weapons: bo sticks, club, crossbow, dagger,
hand axe, javelin, jo stick, pole arms, scimitar, spear, staff.
Oil: no. Poison: ?

Monks are masters of unarmed combat. Centuries of knowledge have
passed from teacher to student, from across the realms, modified and
combined, until the monk has become the greatest mind trained in the
art of battle. Most monks shun weapons as the last resort of the weak.
In melee, often the first action the monk takes is to disarm his
opponent. Monks are well trained in the art of self-defense. Many of
their attacks are more effective when their opponents initiate the
blow, for the monk is able to redirect the force of impact and use an
opponent's weight against itself. Monks are practised in a variety of
attack methods. Before the start of each round, the monk must decide
upon his actions: parry, disarm, throw, dodge, or attack normally.
Monks gain a bonus on parrying, disarming, or throwing charging
opponents and lunging weapons/attacks (ie. spears and rattlesnake bite
attacks). This bonus is +1 per four levels of experience (ie. +2 at
fifth level) up to a maximum of +4 at level 13. This is accomplished
by exploiting the momentum of the attacker as the monk redirects it.

A major OFFENSIVE action is the monk's parry, which may be performed
as many times a round as the monk has attacks, but must be stopped as
soon as the monk follows up. To parry an attack, the monk must roll to
hit his attacker. If the parry is successful, the monk may immediately
follow up in the same round with one disarm, throw, or attack attempt.
The second attack form of the monk is the disarm, which may be
attempted as many times a round as the monk has attacks (as with parry
and throw, see below). Thus the monk may disarm more than one adjacent
opponent a round. Monks must roll to hit their opponents, adding to
the roll their reaction/attacking adjustment due to dexterity. Success
means that the weapon has landed 1d10 feet in a random direction.

The throw may be attempted many times a round, but after the first
successful throw, no more attempts can be made (thus, the monk cannot
throw more than one opponent a round). The monk must roll to hit the
opponent. Success means that the opponent has lost its balance and has
fallen. Immense or strange creatures (ie. red dragons or gelatinous
cubes/will-o-wisps) of course cannot be thrown. The maximum size
affected is 6'4" +4" per level and 300 lbs +100 lbs per level, up to a
maximum of 12' and 2000 lbs at 17th level. Quadrupeds and giant
arthropods (plus other many-legged creatures) are difficult to
unbalance, thus the monk is at -4 to hit, but is at +2 against flying
(with wings, not just hovering like the djinn) creatures. Neither the
monk nor the victim may act for the rest of the round after a throw.
The victim must spend the next round regaining its footing (winging?).
Unless it is part of a parry, the throw allows the victim +2 to hit,
if it is able to attack before the throw or if the monk failed to
throw, due to the fact that the monk is no longer trying to avoid the
opponent.

Dodging is a defensive action in which the monk attempts to use
feints, tumbles, and rolls to completely avoid contact with all
attackers. Monks get an AC bonus of +1 per two levels, up to a maximum
of +8 at level 15. During this round, all damage from weapons, not
spells, which allow the dexterity defensive adjustment in saves, are
at -1 per die, to a minimum of 1 each. When dodging, the monk will
sustain no damage if a save if made. The monk may disengage and break
off from melee during this time without incurring the free attack
routine from opponents. Movement is at normal walking pace. During
this time, the monk exposes little of his vital areas to attack and
many blows glance off.

Due to their study of the human anatomy, monks gain +1/2 per level
bonus on damage in open hand battle against other humans (round up).
At higher levels, monks may learn the anatomies of other species
(note, dragons are not one species; a color/metal/gem/etc must be
specified). Armor of chain mail and better, however, prevents use of
this knowledge, because pressure points and vulnerable areas (such as
the temple, kidney, groin, solar plexus, armpit, etc) are covered up.

Normal open hand attacks have affects of their own. An opponent is
stunned by a monk for 1d4 rounds if the score of the monk's "to hit"
roll exceeds the minimum number required for a hit by 5 or more and
the monk knows the anamony of the oppoent. This roll must be natural
(ie. not affected by strength or striking from behind). Monks can only
stun opponents that they can normally throw. Once stunned, the victim
has a 1% chance per level of the monk of having broken a bone (ie. an
arm, leg, wrist, but not neck; roll randomly).

The rear kill attack can be performed only when the victim is
completely unaware of the whereabouts of the monk. The victim must be
relatively montionless (ie. not running or engaged in melee). The monk
must approach undetected from behind, suddenly grab the victim's head
(roll to hit, +4 because of surprise), and wrench it quickly to snap
the neck. Damage done is 10%, +3% per level of the monk, of the
victim's present hit point total, up to a maximum of 70% at 20th
level. Damage inflicted is not less than the maximum damage the monk
can do with one successful open hand attack, counting all bonuses (ie.
a 1st level monk will inflict a minimum of 4 hp of damage). The victim
cannot be over 5/4 the height of the monk. This attack affects only
creatures with a spinal cord and neck (or equivalent) that can be
broken (Cf. Vorpal Weapon).

Monks have the following abilities which they perform at identical
level of experience to that of a thief: move silently, hide in
shadows, climb walls. Because of intense mental training and mastery,
the monk has developed an extremely acute mind and a sort of sixth
sense. The Sense Movement abiltiy is identical to that of the thief's
Hear Noise ability in percentage per level. The monk must spend one
round in intense concentration. Success indicates that the monk has
detected movement beyond a portal, around a corner, or within a room.
Only its general direction can be known. This ability even allows
detection of invisible creatures, but not ethereal or out of phase
ones. Due to their intense mental discipline, psionic monks gain a 10%
bonus to their defensive points, while non-psionic monks gain a +4
save vs. psionic blast attacks.

At 4th level, a monk can fall up to 20' if he or she is within 1' of a
wall. At 6th level, 30' within 4' of a wall. At 13th level, any
distance within 8'. The monk must have an opportunity to periodically
make contact with the wall to slow the fall. Any surface (wall, tree,
cliff, etc) may be used. (Note, if a 13th level monk falls 5 miles,
the last mile of which is near a wall, he or she falls the equivalent
of ONLY 4 miles.) Monks can also perform vertical leaps of half their
movement rate in feet, without injury (ie. a 1st level monk can leap
7'6" straight up). They can also make forward leaps equal to their
movement in feet (ie. 15' at level 1).

Monks save on the thieves table and attack on the cleric table. They
may use all magic items usable by thieves. In all other respects
(whatever is left), they are treated as a subclass of fighters. Monks
never attract followers.

Although they are trained to be specialists in combat, monks are
different from other fighters because they favor unarmed battle. Thus,
when they use weapons in melee, monks lose many abilities: parry,
disarm, throw, dodge, stun, bonus damage due to knowledge, rear kill,
multiple attacks per round, and bonus attacks vs. slow opponents. If,
because of encumbrance, a monk cannot move at his full rate, the
leaping, bonus attacks vs. slow opponents, and dodging ablilities are
lost.

Note: When fighting a monk of higher level, certain penalties occur.
Parry and throw are at -2 to hit. The bonus dodging AC is cut by half
(round up). Stunning requires a roll of 7 over the minimum to hit.

Starting gold: 5d4 gp. Initial weapon proficiencies: 1.
Non-proficiency penalty: -3. Added proficiency in weapons per level:
1/3 levels.

From: "DON'T CALL ME TINY. - SULU, ST:TSFS" <TL7141A@DRAKE.PRINCETON.EDU>
Subject: AD&D LIST:  my shot at a 2nd ed. monk

Here's another version of a 2nd edition monk.  I felt the one posted
a few days back was not sufficiently different from 1st ed to notice.
Hopefully I've kept the class' flavor and charm while making the rules
simpler and more codified into 2nd ed. format.
Enjoy!
 
MONK
MINIMUM SCORES:  Strength 15, Wisdom 15, Dex 15, Con 11
RACES:  Human, Half Elf (max level 10)
ALIGNMENT RESTRICTIONS:  must be Lawful (Good, neutral, or evil)
 
 
  When creating a monk it is almost impossible to roll one up using
the 3d6 method, and is equally difficult using other methods.  Monks are
extremely rare and should not be common place, especially in a gajan campaign.
Although the monk has very high ability scores, they do have weaknesses.
First the monk my never wear armor of any type (except bracers, rings of
protection and magical cloaks).
 
  Hit points are now rolled with a 2d6 at first level and 1d6 for each and
every level there after up to 10th.  See Table 1 (below).

 +300,000       +1      +1 hp   Grand Master of Flowers (RET)
*A number in parenteses denotes the number of this rank in a guild, see below
**(RET)  In LG guilds the Grand Master of Flowers remains as a figurehead, but
is no longer a leader of the guild.  A Grand Master of Flowers reigns for one
year in a LG guild then retires.  In LN and LE guilds The Grand Master of
Flowers may reign until overthrown (see below) or until retirement.
 
  In any guild their may only be a certain number of members in a given rank.
When a character obtains the experience necessary to obtain the tenth level
(Master), he gains the abilites thereoff but must defeat one of the members of
that rank within two months.  If he loses the challange, he also loses enough
experience to drop him one level, or when challenge for the position of
superior master and higher, a loss substantiates the loss of 100,000 exp, and
the loss of all new abilities.  (example, Ti Lin gets 1,900,050 exp, enough to
move up to the level of Master of Autumn.  She must find the current master
[whose location is always known] and defeat him in hand to hand, unarmed
combat.  She lost and therefore losses all of the skill of a Master of Autumn.
She cannot fight the current master again until she gains enough exp).  All
chalenge in LG and LN monestaries are not to the death, but usually until a
certain condition is met, usually until blood is shed (usually 1/4 of a persons
hit points).  In LE monestaries, the challenge is always to the death.
 
  Proficiencies are the same as a thief, as are saving throws.  They may
select nonweapon proficiencies from the General, Rogue, and Psionicist
groups.  Monks automatically have one bonus weapon proficiency (which must
be used for martial arts) (see Table 2) and one special maneuver
(if the Oriental Adventure martial art sustem is used--it does not
cost a slot)--they may also specialize in an unarmed combat style (probably
martial arts) if the OA system is not used.  Monks may use any martial art
weapon, pole arms, staffs, quarterstaffs, short sword, long sword, dagger,
bo stick, jo stick, but at higher levels monks are more potent with unarmed
attacks.  >>At level 12, the monk's hands and feet are +1 weapons when
determining what can be hit.  At 18th level, they are +2 weapons and at 21
level, they are +3 weapons.<<  Concerning this, look up the rules about
high HD monsters hitting other monsters only hit by magical weapons and
apply these rules to humans and demi-humans, as well, when they are
fighting without a weapon.  When fighting size L and larger creatures,
unarmed damage is halved.
 
Table 2:  Monks Ability Table.
  Movements three times as fast as anyone else is capable of?  I admit "masters
of mind and body" may train and be able to run fast, but not that fast.
  Five attacks per round doing damage that good?  You hack at somebody with
a big sword and it doesn't do that much, and they get to do it five times
compared to a specialized fighters 5/2?  NOT!

SPECIAL ABILITIES
 
  I was thinking, since monks get so many special abilities relating to
psionics (since they ARE masters of mind and body), heck, let's just give
them some minor psionic powers.  They gain sciences and devotions and defense
modes just like psionicists, but at a slower rate.  They may take any they
please (from the disciplines of Psychometabolism and Telepathy--if they run
out of devotions to choose from, the DM may wish to open up Psychokinesis or
Psychoportation to them) when given the opportunity, unless their choice
is dictated by the below (they must take the power said below at the
level that power is gained).
 
A:  The ability to feign death, as the spell once per day per level.
B:  Must take psionic ability Mind Bar.
C:  Speak with animals as the spell once per week per level.
D:  Must take psionic ability Cell Adjustment.  Also +2 to saves vs. natural
    diseases and haste and slow spells.
E:  Must take psionic ability Body Equilibrium.
F:  Must take psionic ability Empathy.
G:  Must take psionic ability Invisibility.
H:  +1 to save vs. breath weapons.
I:  +1 to saves vs. spells of the enchantment/charm school or Charm sphere.
J:  Retarded aging, as a phylactery of long years.  +1 to save vs. poison.
K:  Must take psionic ability Body Control.
L:  Quivering Palm-(a favorite of players) this is the ability for a monk,
    on a successful hit to set up a deadly vibration within a living creature
    unless a saving throw vs death magic is made.  On a failed roll the
    hit creature will die.  This ability may be attempted once per week.
    A successful hit is required to set up the vibrations.
M:  +1 to save vs. paralyzation and poison.  (Total of +2 vs. poison)
N:  Speak with plants as the druid spell, once per day per every three levels.
O:  Activating Mind Bar never fails except on a roll of 20.
P:  +1 to save vs. petrification and polymorph.
Q:  +1 to save vs. death magic.
R:  +1 to save vs. rods, staves, and wands.
S:  A premonition of death or serious harm occurs to the monk 1-4 rounds
    before the harmful event.  90% of the time.
T:  The psionic abilities Tower of Iron Will and Intellect Fortress have a
    power score equal to the monk's WIS and have twice the listed range.
U:  +1 to save vs. spells.
V:  Infravision at will
 
  A monk has the thief skill Move Silently, Find (but not remove) traps,
hiding in shadows, hearing noise, and climbing walls.  The monk uses the
base theives ability scores but starts with 25 discretionary points and 10
additional points per level.
 
Penalties:
 
  The monk class also has downfalls.  The first is the lack of the ability to
wear armor.  The second is the number of weapons usable.  Monks must also
maintain a lawful alignment and MUST NOT stray from it.  Penalties usually
amount to banishment from the order.  Monkish orders also follow taboos which
are determined by the DM.  Below is a list of common taboos, and more may be
found in the Oriental Adventures Handbook.
        Must not eat meat
        Must fast during certain periods
        Must always wear a certain color
        Honesty
        Must eat fish
        Must never build fire (I don't know where this one came from?)
        Silence
        etc.
  One final note, monks may only keep enough money to maintain simple standard
such as food, clothing, and shelter (and not castles either!)  Monks may keep
only 4 magic items, one of which must be a weapon. And one must be a
miscellaneous magic item, potion, scroll, or ring.  Monks can use magic items
limited to theives and those items available to everyone.
 
  Monks get fairly decent hit dice (better than thieves, except at very high
levels when the 2/level final passes up that extra hit die they got).  They
get an awesome number of barehanded attacks/round and do awesome damage
that way.  Their weapon selection is at least as good as a clerics, and
they get psionic powers AND thieving abilities, plus a whole lot of little
bonuses on the side.  I'd say this is a very powerful class yet, even though
I've toned it down some and tried to make the rules more compatible with
2nd ed.  The penalty of not wearing armor is not a big deal, for most
campaigns eventually come across something for those wizards to have, so
what's hard about finding one more for the monk?  And besides, thieves
are only going to have an AC only two better, most likely.  Maybe monks
must use all their high scores in things other than CON, but since I've
removed the restriction about not applying DEX bonus (who's good idea was
that, anyway?)  Give monks all the bonuses applicable due to high ability
scores--why *shouldn't* they get them?
  One thing that was missed is starting cash.  How about 5d6 gold?
