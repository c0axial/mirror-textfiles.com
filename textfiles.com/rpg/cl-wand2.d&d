Subject: Coincidence WANDERER!!

I am SIMPLY AMAZED I have a wanderer also (I also threw in the Benegesserit)
of course I got the idea from DUNE but it could add a whole new aspect
to just about any game (even if they are only used as NPC's)...
 
  The Wanderer
Minimum: Str 15
 Int 15   Initial weapons of proficiency - 3
 Wis 13-16Gained prof. per level - 1/2
 Dex 16
 Con 15
 Cha 17
 Com 12
Table 1 :
   See
Level Experience  Below
----------------------------------
  1   0 - 7,500 A
  2   7,501 -15,000 B
  3  15,001 -31,000 C
  4  31,001 -63,000 D
  5  63,001 -   125,000
  6 125,001 -   250,000
  7 250,001 -   500,000

A.  Must Learn all three good alignment languages before advancing
to second level!
 
B.  At this level the wanderer gains the ability to get information
out of a crowd that would not normally be available. The percent
chance that the wanderer will get the info. is: 100% - 2*(level of
informant) + the level of the wanderer.
 
- also at this level the wanderer gains a protection from evil
  aura, with a radius of (level - 1)''
 
- At this level the wanderer also begins to emanate a field of
  protection from fear (level - 1)''

alcohol (gains Level*10 as base percent for "throwing-off" the
effects of alcohol).
 
C.  At, and after, this level the wanderer is immune Domination,
Hypnosis, Beguile, Possession, Charm, Hold, Magic Jar, Sleep,
Suggestion, and Psionic Blast,
 
- The ability to detect evil as a cleric of 1/2 the level of
the wanderer. This ability works ONCE a day.
 
- At this level the wanderer gets a very special ability, the
ability to shape change to a particular animal form, similar
to the Druid ability. The wanderer can, at this time, change
to this form at will, he or she will henceforth under stand
the language.
 
D.  At this level they may summon a steed if they do not already have
a steed.  Which is psionicaly linked (similar to "familiar").
 
As described in (C) the Wanderer assumes any one of the following
forms:  Wolf - Timber; Coshee - Elven; Bear - Black,
Panda, Kodiac, Brown; Stag - horse; Cat - Panther,
Mountain Lion, Tiger.
 
Note: List may be append
 
The Wanderer gains all the abilities of the Ranger - many
Barbarian abilities - many Paladin/Cavalier abilities including Parrying.

This character class came about from a rathar interesting campaign where
a "good" aligned character decided to make his own "class" and tried his
utmost to learn ALL THREE alignment languages (That is a story unto
itself)  They are powerful BUT HARD TO PLAY.  Most other characters will
be at 3rd to 6th level before this character even gets done learning all
three alignment languages.
 
Any ideas on playing with Augies Wanderer?  (oh I don't know which of us
came up the with the wanderer first, but its kinda "neat" that more than
one person has the idea...  Maybe that means WE CAN CREATE A NEW CLASS!!!!
 
What about moving the abilities A to 2nd level B to 4th and so on or
breaking them up...
