THE VINDICATOR
By: John Givler

DESCRIPTION: The Vindicator is a battler of the undead, ghost,
and the like creatures.  He is designed after the modern day
ghostbusters, and vampire hunters, but this kit covers the whole
range of the undead.  The Vindicator will always be the first to
attack an undead creature, and will not try to help a creature
that is undead.
      The requirements to a be a Vindicator are at least a 13 in
strength, a 13 in dexterity, a 14 in constitution, and a 14 in
wisdom.

ROLE: It is the Vindicator's duty to rid the world of undead,
ghost, and the like creatures.  Most Vindicators are mistaken as
being a priest or a paladin, these classes can be a Vindicator.
Some people are scared of the Vindicators and his unique, and
unknown powers to battle the undead.

SECONDARY SKILLS: If your DM uses secondary skills then you may
select from the following.  The Vindicator gets the Hunter, and
Scribe secondary skills if your DM uses them.

WEAPON PROFICIENCIES: The prefered weapons proficiencies of the
Vindicator are the: longsword or scimitar, dagger, crossbow or
shortbow, ax (usually hand), and the quarterstaff.  Once the
Vindicator has recieved all of his prefered weapon proficiencies
he may become proficient in any weapon he chooses.

NONWEAPON PROFICIENCIES: Bonus proficiencies: blind-fighting.
direction sense.  Recommended: Warrior- animal lore, set snares,
(for non rangers) tracking. (General) rope use, dancing, singing,
and blacksmithy.

EQUIPMENT: The character when he spends his starting gold, may
not buy armor heavier than chainmail armor, and they cannot
employ shields.  * Note * The Vindicator is given a Vindicator
Survival Kit by the organization he donates money to.  This kit
consist of: 1 mirror (3" x 3"), 4 wood stakes, 1 mallet, holy
water (1 pint), garlic (5 balbs), and a silver dagger.  This kit
comes in a leather backpack and is recieved at first level.  The
character should buy weapons made of silver or silver dipped, and
the character does not have to pay extra for these items.

SPECIAL BENEFITS: At first level the Vindicator has the thieving
ability of Hear Noises and this ability increases each level.
* Note * See the Thief Progression Table on page 23 in the
Dungeon Master's Guide (2nd Edition).  They can also turn undead
as a paladin.  The Vindicator get a bonus +1 to hit the undead.
The Vindicator gets two unusual skills at the first level and they
are:
      Undead Lore (Busting): This is the art of knowing what it
takes to kill undead, ghost, and the like creatures.  Optional to
include how to kill demons and devils.
      Modified (Ghost) Tracking:  Vindicators have noticed that
undead creatures have a Death Arua around them, and this arua
also leave a footprint where they have been and where they are
going.  So the Vindicator is able to follow the undead in this
manor.  * Note * The Death Arua can only be seen by the trained
eye of the Vindicator or a necromacy priest or wizard with the
detect magic spell.
      At tenth level the Vindicator gets the Energy Drain
Protection: This ability gives the Vindicator a saving throw vs.
Death Magic and if the saving throw is made the character suffers
half the normal energy drain from undead, ghost, or like
creature.  * Note * If the character makes his save then he only
suffers half the normal energy drain damage, but if he fails his
save then he suffers the full energy drain as any other character
would.

SPECIAL HINDRANCES: Vindicators must donate 10% of their money to
the church or some organization, and they can not have more
treasure than they can carry.  If the Vindicator does not choose
an organization to donate money to, then he does not get the
Vindicator Survival Kit, and can not buy weapons made of, or
dipped with silver.
      The Vindicator may not wear armor heavier than chain, and
they can not employ shields, and he can not possess more than 10
magic items.  Furthermore, these may not exceed one suit of armor,
and five magic weapons, and four other magic items, but he can
carry any ammount of non magical items he deems necessary for his
survival.
      The Vindicator is solely trained as a fighter to battle the
undead and the like creatures, so when battling living things he
suffers a -2 penalty to hit.
      At first level a Vindicator must choose regular tracking as
a nonweapon proficiency otherwise he does not get the Modified
(Ghost) Tracking, but when he does gets the regular tracking he
must spend 2 nonweapon proficiencies slots to receive the Modified
(Ghost) Tracking.
      The Vindicator must choose which undead he wants to receive
his bonus to hit against at first level, and this determines which
undead he get the Energy Drain Protection against at tenth level.
If he does not choose an undead at first level then, the abilties
can never develope.  * Note * The player should consult with the DM
as to choose an undead he may battle.

WEALTH OPTIONS: The Vindicator gets the usual starting gold of
(5d4 x 10 gp), but he must donate 10% of this to the church or
organization that he chooses.

RACES: The Vindicator Kit is open to any race, but non human
characters are limited to what ever the restictions are of the
warrior class that the character chooses.  * Note * If there
are no racial limits to the level of non human characters then,
they are limited to the 9th level.  The DM may choose not to use
this rule.

NOTE: If the Ranger or Paladin chooses this kit, then instead of
the usual spheres of clerical spells they choose from, they must
choose spells from any of the three following spheres:  All,
Necromantic, and Protection.  The Vindicator uses the
restrictions of the class that he has chosen.
     Optional Note to DM'S:  The Energy Drain Protection maybe
dropped if the DM desires to do so.  This kit can also be used for
other classes as well.
