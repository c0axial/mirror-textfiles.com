This is a description of the values of the various tags which are used in 
the book of plots.

One tag has the form <tag>...</tag> like in HTML. It is case-insensitive. 
If you have to use more than one tag than use the form

	<tag>content1</tag>               /* correct */
	<tag>content2</tag>

instead of

	<tag>content1, content2</tag>     /* not allowed */

	
The Plots

Each plot is of the form:

<title>Title of the Plot</title>
<author>Author's Name
<email>if no email, then ommit this tag</email>
</author>
<length>only one tag allowed</length>
<setting>any number of tags allowed</setting>
<genre>only one tag allowed</genre>
<type>any number of tags allowed</type>
<plot>
The plot begins here.

Paragraphs are denoted with empty lines between them. Like this one.

If you need dividers between bigger portions of text then use any number 
of dashes, e.g.:
-----------
The dashes should start at the beginning of the line. You can also use 
other characters for dividing lines, e.g.:
=================
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

If you need to emphasise a word then enclose it in "*", "_", or "+". For 
example: You see a *big* tower with a _huge_ door and a +strong+ 
porticullis.

If you want to specify a list then use the "list" tags:
<list>
* This is the first element.
* You can specify unnumbered lists while using "*", "+", or "-" as the 
first character of a list item, optionally followed by a ")" or ":"
* you can specify numbered lists while using either a number [0-9] or a 
character [a-zA-Z], followed by a ".", ")", or ":"
</list>

If you need to preserve line feeds then use the "stats" tags. For example 
if you have a small map like

<stats>
              +-------+
			  | o     |    <- Hole in Floor
			  |       |
			  |       =    <- Door
			  |    m  |    <- Monster
			  +-------+
</stats>

If you have descriptions of villains you can use the "villain" tags. All 
descriptions are put together in a section at the end of the plot.

<villain>
This is the description of the bodyguard of the mighty wizard.
<stats>
Name: Hulk Hogan
Strength: 20
Intelligence: 5
...
</stats>

He likes flowers but hates men who are bigger then himself.
</villain>

Note that you can also use lists and stats within a villain section.

Intrigue 
      Vendettas, politics, nasty tricks, take-overs and such like. 
Investigation 
      There is mystery to be solved.  (unknown killer, a puzzle etc).  The 
      flavour of the mission will be finding clues and piecing them together (for 
      the most part).
