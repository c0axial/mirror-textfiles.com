Subject: The Demagogue

Hello hello hello!  It is me, once more, with another class for your perusal.
First we had the Warlock, an odd type of spellcaster, and next there was the
Survivor, based on Constitution.  And now.... The Demagogue, the class based on
Charisma!  (riotous applause from the crowds)
 
The Demagogue
Requirements:  Cha 9
Prime Requisite: Charisma
Demagogues make saving throws as priests but have their own THAC0 table.
LVL    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
THAC0 20 20 19 19 19 18 18 17 17 17 16 16 15 15 15 14 14 13 13 13
     If you go through the trouble of the basic math, you will see that this
improves on a 2/5 scale, which is slightly worse than Rogue, but slightly
better than Wizard.
     The Demagogue is an Orator, a Debator, a Leader, a Diplomat, a Fast Talker
and a controller of the masses.
     The Demagogue is not a strong combat character, however.  They have no
armor restrictions, due to the fact that they need to look impressive on
occasions, and wearing the right armor is one way to do that.  They do have a
limited weapon choice, however.  They can use Staff, Dagger, Dart, Knife,
Sling, Staff Sling, Short Sword and any Fencing Blade.
     Demagogues are used to dealing with mind changing tactics, therefore
the have partial immunity to Enchantment/Charm spells (10% + 3% per level),
Psionics using telepathic powers against them suffer -2 to their power score
rolls, and they recieve a +3 bonus against the Fast Talking of swindlers and
other Demagogues.
     Demagogues have Hypnotism powers.  Their percentage chance to hypnotize is
their Charisma + 5% per level.  Thus a 7th level Demagogue with a 17 Charisma
would have a 52% chance to hypnotize.  Hypnotism CAN be used on an unwilling
victim, but they get a saving throw versus Pet/Poly.  The hypnotized person
must be within line of sight and in hearing distance (however telepathic
communication will work).  With hypnosis, visual and audial illusions can be
implanted in the mind of the victim.  If the percentile roll is made at a -5%
penalty, a suggestion can be placed in the victim.  This suggestion must be
immediate, however.  Post-hypnotic illusions and suggestions can be made with a
roll made at -25%.  These require some form of trigger, which is set at the
hypnosis.  Hypnosis can remove curses or bestow curses that affect the mind if
their hypnotism roll is made at -30%.  Other types of curses can't be affected,
such as curses that change someone's form.  With a Hypnotism roll made at -50%,
the Demagogue can Geas or Remove Geas on the victim.  The Demagouge can make
the victim forget about the hypnotism session with another successful roll.
     Demagogues get the Fast Talk proficiency or the Ettiquette proficiency for
free (player's choice).
     At 4th level, the Demagogue gets either Incite Beserker Rage or Soothing
Word as the Priest powers (again, player's choice).
     A Demagogue can influence reactions with his speechs, changing the
reactions of the listeners one rank (same as Bards- see in the PH).  They can
also do Crowd Control once per day per three levels and can make the crowd feel
or do what the Demagogue wants them to. This,
however, requires using the psycholgies that are only applicable in crowds, so
it requires more than 20 people listening, and they get a group saving throw
against it (however DM's may give specific PC's and NPC's personal saving
throws).  Note that Crowd Control cannot make crowds do something that they are
completely and fundamentally against (like make Druids burn down forests), but
DM judgement should be used... apply penalties or bonuses to the saving throw
as you see fit.
     When a Demagogue is travelling in a party, his Loyalty Base is added to
all NPC morale checks in the party.  When one is leading an army (or is at
least a figure head in it), morale checks for that army have his Loyalty Base
doubled added to it.
     Demagogues have one power that is useful for combat: Confuse.  With this
power, the Demagogue simply yells confusing statements at a single enemy very
quickly, which can make the enemy stand confused for some time.  This acts as
a stun for 1d4 rounds.  For this, use the same table that Priests use for
Turning Undead, using the Hit Dice of the creature.  The creature must have at
least Low Intelligence and speak the language the Demagogue is speaking.
Creatures with high Wisdom can add their Mental Save bonus to what the
Demagogue needs to roll.  A T result means the creature is stunned for 2d4
rounds and a D result means the creature is stunned for 4d4 rounds.
     Note: Hypnotism CAN be used in combat, but it takes a full round.  If the
Demagogue is struck any time during that round, the Hypnotism is ruined.  Note
also that the Demagogue must stay still and concentrate on his victim when he
does this, so his AC is penalized by three and he is easily backstabbed.  If he
gets through the round and the victim fails his save, then the Victim stops
doing anything until the Demagogue instructs him.  He will follow the
Demagogue's commands.
     The Demagogue must have some form of Neutral Alignment, and has the same
experience table as Paladins.  They roll d8 for hit points (+2 after 9th level)
     Demagogues have their own NWP table, which has Fast Talk, Read/ Write,
Modern Languages, Local History, Ancient History, Gaming, Religion, Diplomacy,
Local Customs, Military Tactics, Cultural Identification and others.  Write if
you want more info on that.
     Well, I hope you enjoyed the Demagogue!  More classes will come later!
