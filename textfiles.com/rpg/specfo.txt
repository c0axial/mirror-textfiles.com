     The Special Forces are those elite military personel used to
enter the battle in the face of great odds.  These men and women
are of the highest caliber of military soldiers and some even
rival the elit commando units such as the Death Commandos and the
DEST Commandos.  These soldiers are the equivalant to the seals
and the black Berets of the late 20th Century.  They are trained
to drop from high altitudes and infiltrate enemy bases and create
as much havoc as possible.  These soldiers are also trained to
repair as take out mechs using satchel charges and landmines.

This is a description of some of the new skills and equipment
associated with these new archtype.

High Altitude Drops:  This is a type of combat drop in which the
soldier is dropped from the dropship while still in atmosphere. 
The soldier sits tucked in a fetus position in a ceramic cocoon
which drops toward the earth.  Upon reaching a specified altitude
the pod decentegrates and the soldier glides to earth on a
parachute.

Anti-Mech combat:  This is the form of gurilla warfare in which
infantry use special weapons to either destroy or incapacitate a
battlemech.  Some of these tactics include planting satchel
charges in the knee joint of mechs and planting mines in the path
of an oncomming mech.  This type of warfare is extremely
dangerous and takes specific training to accomplish.


High Altitude Bubble:  This is the bubble in which the soldier
sits during a high altitude drop.  The bubble is made of a high
strenght ceramic to withstand the heat of going through the
atmosphere.  A small computer is embedded in the side of the
bubble, which tells the soldier his altitude, the heat of the
bubble as well as an approximate location from the designated
landing zone.  The bubble can withstand temperatures up to 5000c
as well as having 50 points of armor to protect the soldier from
any attack on the way down.


Satchel Charge:  This device is used by Anti-Mech Soldiers to
render a mech inoperative.  The unit consists of a 1ft x 1ft x
4in cloth bag in which is placed a large quantity of plastic
explosives.  The bag is placed in a joint(usually the knee) and a
string is pulled as the soldier jumps from the mech.  The string
starts a fifteen second fuse and explodes the plastic explosives. 
      Damage: 4pts to the leg in which the satchel was planted on
as well as an automatic roll on the criticle hit chart.  These
babies can be very usefull in the hands of trained professionals
or very deadly in the hands of fools.
