Re: THE GENDARME KIT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Gendarme

Description: Gendarme are policeman, and guards working for the
government, or an aristrocrat.  He is a protector of the innocent,
prosecurator of the guilty.  The Gendarme is a crime stopper and
will do this within the limits of the law.
     The main attributes are strength and dexterity.  Charisma is
also an important factor..  Any character choosing to be a Gendarme
needs at least a 14 in both strength and dexterity, and at least
a 12 in charisma.

Role: The Gendarme is a defender of the law, and it is his job to
protect the innocent, and bring criminals to justice.  It is his
job to stop thieves, murderers, and other crimes.  Some often
wonder what are the Gendarme's legal issues.  The Gendarme are the
law, whether they uphold this in a good or evil manner is no
concern, because it is their job to defend the law.

Secondary Skills: Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Gambler, Hunter,
Limner/Painter, Navigator, Weaponsmith, are the prefered secondary
skills for the Gendarme.

Skill Progression: The only skill not favored by the Gendarme is
Pick Pockets, but the character is evenly distributed among the
remaining skills.

Weapon Proficiencies: The Gendarme may be proficient in any weapon
that the thief class is allowed.  The prefered weapons of the
Gendarme are the: hand crossbow, dagger (normal & throwing),
longsword, and the quarterstaff.

Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus proficiencies are: Tracking, and
Reading lips.  Recommended: (Rogue) Blind-fighting, disguise,
jumping, set snares, tightrope walking, tumbling; (General)
Direction sense, etiquette, riding land-based, rope use, and
swimming.

Equipment: The Gendarme uses equipment that will aid in his
survival, and to help him capture thieves.  They need the usual
lock picks, and the other prefered weapons.  The Gendarme will have
over a dozen crossbow arrows or bolts, and a number of throwing
daggers.

Special Benefits: The Gendarme gets many benefits that are not
available to a normal thief.  The Gendarme recieves the fighter
exceptional strength bonuses.  Also the Gendarme gets multiple
attacks per round.
                     Level      Attacks
                      1-6          1
                      7-13        3/2
                      14+          2

Special Hindrances: The Gendarme only recieves his multiple attacks
per round, and fighter exceptional strength bonuses, with two
weapons one of which must be the hand crossbow.  The other is the
characters choice.
     The Gendarme must be either Lawful Neutral, or Lawful Good.
Most of the Gendarme are Lawful Neutral, so that may get away with
some of their action, in the attempts to stop crime.  The Gendarme
does not recieve the 10% bonus to earned experience.
     While the gendarme can have any monetary amount of treasure,
they cannot have more treasure than they can carry.  Excess
treasure must be converted to a portable form, or donated to a
worthy institution (an NPC group, not a player character.)

Races: Although almost any race can be a thief, the Gendarme is
only recommended for humans.  The DM may wish to change this rule
since crime is in almost every civilization.

Notes: As stated earlier the Gendarme is an anti-thief, and a
crime stopper.  So it goes to say that thieves do not like them,
and attempts may be made on the character's life.
     The Gendarme should not be mistaken for a fighter, or a thief.
Although it may have some of the abilities of both classes, it is
different, and is a kit for the thief class.  The main goal of the
Gendarme kit is to stop thieves, because there is to much crime and
chaos going on in the world, and something must be done to stop it.
That is the Gendarme's job.
