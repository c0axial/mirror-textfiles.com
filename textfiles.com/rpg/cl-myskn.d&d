MYSTIC KNIGHT (Knight of the Star Order)

The Mystic Knight is a mixture of a mentalist and a fighter.  The knight 
undergoes intensive training with one weapon, as well as developing and using 
some mental powers.  The first Mystic Knights were trained by a rogue mentalist
to help provide him with protection.  The mentalist was able to hire weapons 
trainers to instruct the individuals in weapons skills.  A special type of sword
is used by all Mystic Knights, which clearly makes them stand out (NOTE:  The
weapon they use is called the Star Saber and was designed specifically for this
class. The Star Saber can be used either one-handed or two-handed. While
retaining about the same mass and size as a long sword, the Star Saber's design
makes it perfect for defesive manuvers such as disarming, while at the same
time slightly increasing damage. One-handed S/M 1d8+1 L 1d10+2. Parry value 3.
Two-handed S/M 1d8+2 L 1d10+3. Parry value 4.) The Mytic Knights are rare in 
themselves and usually have a devotion to aid the Order of Psi (In our campaign
world, a secretive Psionic organization and the only group with detailed 
knowledge of the workings of psionic powers).

The Mystic Knight powers are mentalist powers, but they are classified in a 
different manner.  The powers are defined in the Psionics Handbook. In
addition to the above powers, they automatically get the powers Contact,
Mind Thrust and Mind Blank, because of the sheer number of times they
have been trained to use these abilities.  In addition, the initial cost of
Contact have been changed as follows: 

1-5   levels or HD    2 PSPs
6-10  levels or HD    6 PSPs 
11-15 levels or HD   10 PSPs 
16-20 levels or HD   14 PSPs

Mystic Knights gain approximately 1/3 the PSPs of a mentalist.  To find the
characters inherent Psionics Strength Points, look up the characters's Wisdom 
score on the PSP table and record the base score.  Then look up the character's
Constitution Score on the table and add the modifier to the base score.  The 
final score is the character's inherent potential.  For every level of 
experience the knight gains, the total PSP's are increased.  The character
will gain 3 PSP's per level plus the modifier on the PSP table that corresponds
to the character's Wisdom.

     Mystic Knights gain weapon proficiencies at the same rate as fighters,
but they must use two of their initial Weapon Profic. slots on Star Saber
specialization (While the Star Saber is their primary, specialized weapon,
mystic knights DO NOT gain the pluses to hit and damage. They only gain the
weapon attack advancement). In addition they may only gain a maximum of
of 3 additional weapon proficiency slots in addition to their initial weapon
proficiency slots. They get Non-Weapon Profic. as per Cleric of equal level
except they get Jumping and Tumbling as free Non-Weapon Proficiencies. They 
can choose non-weapon proficiencies from Warrior, Priest and General groups.  

     Mystic Knights start off with 4d4 x 10 silver pieces for initial funding.
     Mystic Knights have the same saving throws as Thieves.

     With the exception of their "specialization" with the Star Saber
(with which they fight as an equivalent level Warrior), Mystic Knights
have the same combative abilities as Priests (ie. with the Star Saber their
THACO is a per fighter, while with all other proficient weapons their THACO is
as per Cleric of equal level). Their training with the Star Saber is so 
intensive, and their instinct with this weapon so great, that they get 
additional combative abilities with it beyond those of normal fighters. These 
special abilities are based around disarming an opponent and self-defense as 
the taking of life unnecessarily is against the code of the Mystic Knight. 
These abilities, and the levels they are gained at are detailed below.

NOTE: These abilities only apply when the Mystic Knight uses a Star Saber

LVL       ABILITY
1         5% chance/Lv of being able to deflect all visible missile
            weapons within reach
          -6 to hit for a disarm
3         Ability to lower AC by 2 places for every attack given up in
            a given round (this is in addition to normal parrying rules)
4         -4 to hit for a disarm
6         2 attacks per round
8         Ability to lower AC by 3 places for every attack given up in
            a given round (not cumulative with the LV 3 ability)
9         +1 additional to hit and on damage
11        5/2 attacks
12        -2 to hit for a disarm
18        Ability to lower AC 4 places for every attack given up in a
            given round (not cumulative with the LV 3 or LV 8 ability)
20        3 attacks per round
22        +2 additional to hit and on damage (not cumulative with Lv 9
            ability)

     Mystic Knights, in addition to the above abilities, have three innate
abilities which they develop by 1st level. The first of these abilities
is the power to form a field of mental force around his Star Saber. This
plane of force, which can not be formed around Sabers that have been
magicked, gives the Saber an additional +1 to hit and +2 on damage.
These bonuses go up to +2/+4 at 8th level and finally to +3/+6 at 15th
level. This plane of force can be raised and dropped at will, taking
only 1 segment to lower and raise, and can be maintained for a total
number of rounds(or parts thereof) per day equal to 1/2 the Knights Wisdom
(rounded down) plus 1 per 2 levels of the Knight. This field does allow the
mystic knight to hit creatures that are normally only hit by magical weapons,
assuming the creature to be hit does not exceed the knight pluses to hit
ability.

     The second of these powers is the ability to sense "Presence" in
other creatures. Presence is the ability of a creature to use Psionic
Abilities. The Knight can sense which creatures possess Presence, and
how strongly they possess it. The sensing range is 100 yards per level of
the Knight. 
     The final special power of the Mystic Knight allows the knight to 
return the Star Saber to the knight's hand.  The knight is only able to use 
this ability on the Star Saber, when the weapon can be seen.  The telekinetic 
movement of the saber requires 1 PSP per segment the saber is moved.  The 
knight is able to exert 10 lbs. force per level on the saber.  As well as 
increasing force with the level of the knight, the movement rate of the saber 
increases with level.  At 1st level the knight can move the saber at a rate of 
10' per segement.  A movement rate of 20' per segment is achieved at 8th 
level.  The rate finally increases to 30' per segment at 15th level.  No power
checks for this ability are required.
     Mystic Knights do have several limitations to counter their
extraordinary abilities. First, because large quantities of metal
interfere with their mentalist abilities, Mystic Knights may only wear
non-metallic armor.  Also due to the manueverability their combative
abilities require and the fact that they often use both hands on their
Saber, Mystic Knights shun the use of shields and will never use them.
    Mystic Knights are also the slowest of the class to progress. In
addition to this Mystic Knights may not multi-class, but dual classing
is possible.  
    Finally, as mentioned above, all of the special combative abilities
of the Mystic Knight are based around the Star Saber, his primary
weapon. This sword like weapon is unique to the Mystic Knight and is
composed out of a special composite steel. So rare and difficult to
forge is the Star Saber, that if a Mystic Knight (who starts off with a
Star Saber for free) were to loose his Saber, it would require a master
weaponsmith ten weeks and a cost of about 750 sps to replace. Star
Sabers are unusually strong and gaining +2 on all of their saves. Because
magic interferes with the field a Knight can place around his weapon,
very few magical Sabers exist.
