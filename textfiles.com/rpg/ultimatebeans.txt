                       THE ULTIMATE BAG O' BEANS

     This bag, constructed of heavy cloth, is about two feet wide and
four feet long (the size of any large bag or sack). A character who
opens it will find several large, pebble-like objects inside. If dumped
out of the bag, these objects explode for 5d4 points of damage each.
All creatures within a 10 foot radius must successfully save vs. spell
or suffer full damage. To be removed safely, the beans in the bag must
be taken out by hand - telekinesis won't prevent them from exploding,
nor will working them out with tools. If placed in dirt and watered,
each pebble-like bean will "sprout". Only a few beans are beneficial
most are dangerous or useless.
     Just roll 1d100 to get a bean. If the bean rolled has already been
picked then use the one after it or the one before it.
     Unless noted otherwise, all items and beings created by a bean are
permanent and can be destroyed or slain normally. Also, the beans will
always be destroyed unless noted otherwise.
     A wild magic mage has a 50% chance to control the bag. Thus,
he/she can pick the bean he/she wants. Page 5 of the TOME OF MAGIC
discusses wild mages and has the rule of the random objects used by
wild mages.
     Some DMs may want the bag contain less than 100 beans since a bag
probably had previous owners who no doubt used some of the beans.
Therefore, the number of beans in the bag should be 75-100 (5d6 + 70).
The DM will have to decide which beans should be removed from the bag.
     In every case, the DM may make any adjustments to these results he
feels is appropriate.

1.  A tree grows from the ground. Roll on A for size. Roll on B for
type. There is a 25% chance that the tree begins to spew seeds within a
50 foot radius. These seeds grow into trees within 1 round. These trees
spew seeds as their parent and more trees grow. This process continues
for 59 rounds. If this process isn't stopped, a forest of tress could
span approximately 2950 foot radius from the original tree.

3.  The bean turns into a gem in 1d4 rounds. Roll on Table A to get the
class and value of the gem.
     There is a 30% chance that a bird flies down out of the sky,
snatches the gem, and flies off. Unless the DM has a specific bird in
mind with its own stats, then the bird is a normal bird (AC 8; MV 4 FL

4.  Gas pours out of the ground where the bean was planted at a rate of
1 cubic foot per round. (There is a 25% that bubbles containing gas
pour out of the ground instead of just gas.) Roll on Table A for

     If the sound is from a person(s), the race of the person(s) making
the sound can be determined using the random languages table in the
DMG, p. 102. The language is generally difficult to understand, but the
content may be determined by the DM as desired.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.  After the bean is planted, it will wiggle back up out of the
ground. It radiates powerful magic, and could easily be confused when
under detection spells to have amazingly beneficial powers (DM's
choice, of course) if planted and allowed to sprout. The trouble is
that beans won't grow unless planted, and this little sucker just won't
stay put!  The bean will never grow into anything. The only magical
power is its ability to boar to the surface. The fun is watching
characters (and players) tearing their hair out trying to figure out
how to make the #!$* bean sprout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.  A 5' X 5' horizontal portal of shimmering, glittering, rainbow
light appears on the ground above the location of the bean. The portal
is a gateway to another place/plane (75% chance of it being one-way).
Roll on Table A to decide where it leads to. The duration of the portal
is the DM's decision.

9.  A 3' X 3' wooden door appears on the ground. The door is locked and
a thief has -20% of picking it. If open, the characters will see stairs
leading downward. The stairs lead down to a dungeon. The information on
the dungeon is left up to the DM. Since most DMs have a surplus of
useless dungeons that have no purpose and are completely random, this
bean is away to get rid of the DM's library of these dungeons. This
also allow a DM to do anything he wants in a dungeon without worrying
about background, plot, story-line, or anything else that is time-
consuming. Also note that Appendix A on page 169-173 of the 1st edition
DMG is a random dungeon generation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

10.  The bean changes the fertility of the soil in a 1d4 mile radius
for 1d2 years. Roll 1d100. A roll of 1-50 indicates that the area
around the bean becomes completely infertile. All vegetation will die
within a few weeks and turn the land into a virtual wasteland. A roll
of 51-100 indicates that the area around the bean becomes extremely
fertile. Vegetation will grow in abundance within a few weeks and turn
the land into a virtual rain forest. To help speed up the growth
process, the DM may allow a plant growth (as in spell) effect to
stimulate the area of effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.  The bean transmutes the natural rock around the bean into another
substance. Roll on Table A.


TABLE A: What Happens? (1d4)

     1: Natural rock of any sort within a 100 cubic foot area of the
bean turns into an equal volume of mud. Creatures unable to levitate,
fly, or otherwise free themselves from the mud sink at the rate of ten
feet per round and suffocate, except for light-weight creatures that
could normally pass across such ground.
     2: Natural rock of any sort within a 100 cubic foot area of the
bean turns into an equal volume of fresh water thus creating a lake 100
feet deep.
     3: Natural rock of any sort within a 100 cubic foot area of the
bean turns into an equal volume of air thus creating a canyon 100 feet
deep.
    4: Natural rock of any sort within a 100 cubic foot area of the
bean turns into an equal volume of manure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

12.  EARTHQUAKE !!! A local tremor of fairly high strength rips the
ground. The shock is over in 1d4+1 round. The earthquake affects all
terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in its area of effect.
The area of effect of the earthquake is circular with a diameter of
roughly 1 mile.
     Solidly built structures with foundations reaching down to bedrock
sustains one-half damage; one-quarter damage if they score above 50% on
a saving throw. An Earth Elemental in the area of effect can negate 10%
to 100% (roll 1d10 * 10) of the effect. Other magical protections and
wards allowed by the DM may also reduce or negate this effect.
     After the quake, there is a 50% chance that an Earth Elemental
(AC 2; MV 6; HD 12; hp 96; #AT 1; Dmg 4-32; THAC0 9; MC1) comes up
through a nearby crack to seek revenge on those that irritate the
earth. The elemental will be relentless in its task to destroy the
planter of the bean and anybody who engages in combat with it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

13. TWISTER !!! A tornado rises from the ground. Winds are in excessive
of 300 MPH. It has a duration of 5-50 hours. The DM must make the
decision if the tornado will dissipate or continue based on the
environment its in. One inch of precipitation will fall per hour. Only
strong stone buildings will be undamaged. Travel is impossible. The
range of normal and infravision vision is cut by 3/4. No tracking is
possible. There is a +40% chance of getting lost if in unfamiliar
territory. No missile fire is permitted. All non-magical weapon attacks
are at -3 to hit: 20% per attack that any weapon will be torn from the
wielder's grip by the wind. Dexterity bonuses to AC are cancelled. No
creatures can fly, except those from the Elemental Plane of Air.
     There is a 50% chance that an Air Elemental (AC 2; MV FL 36 (A);
HD 12; hp 96; #AT 1; Dmg 2-20; THAC0 9; MC1) follows the tornado out of
the ground to seek revenge on those that summoned it. The elemental
will be relentless in its task to destroy the planter of the bean and
anybody who engages in combat with it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

14.  A nice windy updraft flies out of the ground which will hurl
matter upward upon passing over the bean. Consult the following:

     500+ lbs        no effect
     300-500 lbs     up 10' then outward
     200-300 lbs     up 20' then outward
     100-200 lbs     up 40' then outward
     020-100 lbs     up 80' then outward
     000-020 lbs     good luck finding it again!

Option: Loosely tied/held objects need to be treated separately.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

15.  A magic mouth appears and asks the planter of the bean, "what item
do you wish?" After the character makes a wish, an exact duplicate of
the character will come into being, and this opposite will immediately
attack the character. Note that the duplicate will have all items and
powers of the original (including magic), but upon the defeat or
destruction of either, the duplicate and its items disappear
completely. The only exception is the item that the character wished
for. It is carried and used by the duplicate and will remain after the
destruction of the duplicate. Note that the item can not have an
experience point value above 10,000.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

16.  Wooden spears with extremely sharp heads randomly shoot up from
the ground within a 1d10+10 radius. All creatures within the area of
effect must save vs. paralyzation to avoid the spears or suffer 1d6
points of damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

17.  A sphere of a magical power (Table A) covers the area around the
location where the bean was planted. The sphere will be partly above
ground and partly below ground. The top hemisphere will be above ground
and the bottom hemisphere will be below.
     Note the bean no longer exists. (Some characters may try to find
the bean in hopes of carrying it around with its special ability). The
magical power is unique to the area where the bean was planted.


TABLE A: Effects (1d8)

     1: A permanent 50-foot radius sphere of continual light
immediately appears. The light is as bright as full daylight and lasts
until negated by magical darkness or by dispel magic power. DMs may
want to give the light a certain color to jazz it up.
     2: A permanent 50-foot radius sphere of total, impenetrable
darkness immediately appears. Infravision is useless. Neither normal
nor magical light unless it is a light spell or dispel magic power.
     3: A permanent 50-foot radius sphere of invisibility immediately
appears (or should it be vanishes). Absolutely everything in the sphere
is totally invisible. For example, the characters can't see the ground,
rocks, trees, or themselves. Not even combat will make people appear.
Nothing can break this invisibility except for dispel magic powers.
     4: A permanent 50-foot radius sphere of complete silence
immediately prevails. All sound is stopped: conversation is impossible
and no noise whatsoever issues from or enters the area. Dispel magic
powers will disperse this magical effect.
     5: A permanent 50-foot radius sphere of complete protection from
evil immediately prevails. See Protection From Evil spell for effects.
Dispel magic powers will disperse this magical effect.
     6: A permanent 50-foot radius sphere of complete protection from
good immediately prevails. See Protection From Evil spell for effects.
Dispel magic powers will disperse this magical effect.
     7: Roll twice ignoring this result and 8.
     8: Roll thrice ignoring this result and 7.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

18.  Within 1d12 seconds of planting the bean, two 1-inch diameter
rainbow orbs fly out of the ground and will land with 10d10 feet apart.
An ellipsoid will be formed with the two spheres as the foci of the
rotated ellipse. The ellipse is formed as if drawn on the ground and
the axis of rotation is the line which passes through the two foci. The
formed force cleaves though all things in its path. The ellipsoid of
force and all things within it are rotated 180 degrees and set down.
The force then disappears.
     This strange force is named after Sophlereli, the first person to
encounter this phenomena. Sophlereli was a little slow in grasping the
applications of this force (i.e. transportation across huge distances,
movement of forces in battles, creation of mountain passes, destruction
of castle walls and even killing of large creatures).
     A small problem with these spheres is that the radius is varying.
The field of force may extend from 10 to 100 yards beyond the foci.
This pretty much ensures the planter will remain inside of the field.
Sadly Sophlereli was killed when he attempted to plant a bean and run
for the border of the field. He was cleaved in lengthwise and one of
his halves was transported via the field a distance of six miles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.  A 10-foot radius ring of grass will grow surrounded by mushrooms.
The mushroom have magical effects on persons who eat them. A DM may opt
to make all mushroom have the same effect or have each mushroom be
individual in its effect. For those that must have percentages make the
choice a straight 50-50 chance. Roll on Table A to get the result of
eating a mushroom.


TABLE A: Results (1d4)

     1: If a person eats this mushroom, he will be delighted in its
wonderful steak-like taste. The mushroom will be equal to eating one
full nutritious meal.
     2: If a person eats this mushroom, he will be beset by visions and
must roll a save versus poison or go insane.
     3: If a person eats this mushroom, he must save vs. poison or
become totally passive, unable to do anything. The affected person only
observes; he is unable to perform any action even if attacked. The
duration if this effect is 1d15 rounds.
     4: This mushroom, if eaten, has a wonderful curative property, and
can cure most diseases as a cleric casting Cure Disease of 12th level.
     5: This mushroom, if eaten, will heal 1d10 points of damage that a
character may have.
     6: This mushroom, if eaten, will cause violent hallucinations to
the eater if he fails a save vs. poison. The hallucinations last 1d15
turns. Hallucinating creatures react a follows (1d20):
     01-10   Cower and whimper
     11-15   Stare into nothingness
     16-18   Flee shrieking in a random direction
     19-20   Try to kill the closest creature

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.  A 6 foot tall rod grows out of the ground. The rod shimmers with a
bright, blue, florescent light and will do 1d6 points of electrical
damage to those that touch it. The light summons a cloud of normal
insects to attack all beings within 300 feet of the light. The insects
will arrive in 1d4 rounds. The exact insects are bees, biting flies,
hornets, wasps, mosquitos, etc.. The attacked creatures sustain 2
points of damage if they do nothing but attempt to flee or fend off the
insects during the time they are attacked; they suffer 4 points of
damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, a victim fights
with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor
Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll should be
made for the insects to see if the damage occurs before the insects
arrive. If it does, the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell
is lost.
     Insects will disperse if the victims enter thick smoke or hot
flames. Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm
might possibly be outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body
of water. If the insects are killed, they will return in 1 turn, and
add 2d6 hours to the total. Otherwise these nasties will remain for
2d20 hours in the area of effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

21.  Building materials start to fly out of the ground to create a
building-type structure. Roll on Table A to get the type of structure.


TABLE A: Structure (1d4)

     1: A 50 foot high, 20-foot radius circular tower with 5 stories
appears. The tower's occupant are 24 mean goblins (AC 6; MV 6; HD 1-1;
hp 7; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (by weapon); THAC0 20; MC1) who wish to protect
their home. The DM should stock the tower with various appropriate
items. A DM may opt to add more deadly monsters.
     2: A permanent 100 ft. Leomund's Secure Shelter as in the spell
appears.
     3: A brick outhouse appears. The hole in the outhouse is 20 foot
deep.  In the bottom of the hole there is a mushy muddy mixture that
resembles crap but is a gold compound worth approximately 1000 gold
pieces.
     4: Deep, dark clouds appear within 4 rounds. Then an extremely
solid, cubical, steel 10' X 10' structure appears. The prisoner within
is a vampire (AC 1; MV 12, FL 18(C); HD 8+3; hp 67; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10;
THAC0 13; MC1). He will be very deceitful in attempts to escape his
confinement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

22.  A 5 cubic foot area where the bean was planted becomes vary
sensitive to pressure. Whenever more than 50 pounds of pressure is
applied in the area an effect something happens. Roll on Table A for
the effect.


TABLE A: Effects (1d6)

     1: It tells the weight that is on it. For example, a person stands
on the area and it says, "Your weight is 250 pounds." DMs may add extra
remarks like "You're fat!"
     2: It continuously screams, "Owwee, owwee, owwee!"
     3: It screams, "Hey, get the hell off me!"
     4: It throws everything out of the area.
     5: It says, "Don't tread on me."
     6: The area blows up like a land mine and causes 5d10 points of
damage to those in the area.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

23.  This dangerous bean, when planted, will burrow 20 feet per day
straight down - without stopping - right through everything (bad news).
It creates a hole with a diameter of about 6 inches. It doesn't burrow
sideways if it is put on the side of a mountain; it seeks the center of
gravity, and once it is there (ex. the center of the planet), it
retreats away from it.
     This could be interesting in "gravity planes" on some other planes
of existence or in a Spelljamming environment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

24.  The lucky person who pulls this bean out of the bag never gets to
plant it. In fact, it will abhor him to even think of burying this
beautiful object in the ugly, dirty ground. The puller of the bean
becomes completely enraptured by it. It becomes his favorite object --
he will never part with it. He must have it with him at all times, even
when sleeping (which could become a problem if he is *ahem*
accompanied). He values no person, deed, or possession over this bean
(paladins watch out). He will often be found simply holding his bean
lovingly and staring at it.
     He is offered no saving throw, and effects are immediate. The
effects are broken by either a remove curse spell, or if the bean is
planted. For it to be planted, someone else must steal the bean from
the owner (no small task for something so precious) and plant it in
soil. However, once watered, two very perturbed hell hounds (AC 4; MV
12; HD 7; hp 56; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10; THAC0 13; MCII) appear, and they're
hungry. If not watered, the original owner of the bean will feel
resentment and hatred for the person who stole and buried it (no remove
curse will help here) until the bean is watered. Just to clarify, the
stealer of the bean is not effected because the effects only occur when
the bean is pulled from the bag itself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

25.  A brilliant rainbow shoots out of the ground where the bean was
planted. It illuminates the area within 30 feet. The illumination is a
luminous glow, equal to sunlight. See the light spell (PH, p. 127).
     The rainbow also affects everybody within 30 feet and lasts for
1d6+4 turns. Roll on Table A to get the additional effect of the
rainbow.


TABLE A: Effects (1d4)

     1: Color spray. A vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors
springs forth from the rainbow. All creatures in the area of effect are
effected. All creatures above 6th level or 6 hit dice are entitled to a
saving throw vs. spell. Blind or unseeing creatures are unaffected.
    Creatures not allowed or failing saving throws, and whose hit dice
or levels are less than or equal to 12, are struck unconscious for 2d4
rounds; those with hit dice or levels of 13 or 14 are blinded for 1d4
rounds; those with hit dice or levels of 15 or more are stunned
(reeling and unable to think or act coherently) for one round.
     2: Shimmering arrow-shaped missiles fire from the rainbow. All
creatures must make 1d6+1 dexterity ability checks. For each failed
check, the creature will suffer 2d6 points of damage.
     3: The rainbow turns into a glowing, rainbow-hued band of
interweaving patterns. Creatures in the area of effect may become
fascinated and gaze at it as long as the effect lasts. Each creature
gets a save vs. spells to negate the effect otherwise it is hypnotized
for 1d6 turns.
     4: Everybody within the area of effect is cured of blindness
(normal or magical), cured of all poisons, cleansed of any curses, and
healed of all damaged.
     5: The other end of the rainbow will land approximately one mile
way. At that end will be a pot of gold containing 10000 gold pieces.
Vindictive DMs may have a clan of leprechauns waiting there as well.
     6: The rainbow is normal and has no effects except for its natural
beauty.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

26.  A modified clone of the planter appears. He will be 1d10+10 years
older and 1d6+6 levels higher than the planter. In all other aspects he
is identical (including possessions, experiences, personality, and
thought). Roll on Table A to get the clone's purpose.


TABLE A: Clone's Purpose

     1: The clone wishes to destroy the planter and take the planter's
place in society. He will not be open about his plans. He will carry
out his plans in a clever, subtle fashion over a period of time so as
not to arouse suspicion. His alignment is evil in respects to good,
neutral and evil; he will remain lawful, neutral or chaotic depending
on what the planter is.
     2: The clone offers to serve the planter in exchange for a vow,
such as "Never kiss a beautiful girl," or "Never drink anything in a
public place," or "always give a 10% tithe to charity," etc.. If the
planter disagrees to the condition, the clone leaves and vows to seek
revenge on the planter someday. The clone could be a pivotal NPC for
clever DMs.
     3: The clone leaves the planter in hopes to seek his own fame and
fortune (or whatever the planter's hopes and dreams are).
     4: The clone considers himself equal to the planter and will
become close friends with its twin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

27.  A small sapling grows where the bean was planted -- the wood type
is unidentifiable. It is very straight, and the tree will never grow
more than 2' tall. If the sapling is made into an arrow shaft, it will
be an Arrow of Slaying.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

28.  A small sapling grows emerges. It is of animal intelligence and
after one week may move about. It is a baby treant, and will grow to
maturity over the next decade (about 3 to 5 times as fast as it
should). DMs should consider that it will make an interesting recurring
NPC, or a strange PC.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

29.  A tree resembling a maple tree springs up. The blooms of the tree
will open in 1d4 rounds, they will smell like a fruity alcohol. The sap
of the tree will be alcoholic and have a fruity taste. Drinking the sap
will put a person into a state of great intoxication (reference The
Complete Guide To Alcohol). The sap can only be gather by making a hole
in the tree and letting the fluid flow out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

30.  A bean plant springs from the ground; nothing else. It just sits
there. It radiates magic from its growth. The bean plant grows at a
magically accelerated rate, but is otherwise normal. If the characters
harvest it, the beans can be used to make a heckuva good pot of chili
(or baked beans, or whatever).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

31.  When planted the bean will grow a very simple tiny plant with one
flower. It is a simple dull flower, though if enough love is given to
the plant the flower will turn into a beautiful flower. If this flower
is given to a person of the opposite sex, it will cause the person to
fall in love with the one who gave love to the plant. The plant
radiates slight enchantment/charm magic if looked for.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

32.  A small plant with blue flowers grows from the bean. The plant is
three feet tall, has 1d8 buds, and 1d6 open flowers. Each time a spell
is cast, a charge from an item is used, a innate ability which is a
defined spell, or a scroll is read within 60 feet of the plant, the
plant absorbs the energy. The magic fails to happen, but one flower
drops off the plant and the plant increases in height by one foot.
     Each round, 1d2 buds open. Each time a bud opens, it casts a
random wizard or priest spell of level 1d6+1. If the spell is to be
cast vs. a creature, a random creature within 50 feet is picked. If it
is area effect, it is cast at ground zero to the plant but the plant
itself is unaffected. All creatures that are mentally controlled by the
plant are ordered to protect it and help it grow (by using magic). Each
time a bud opens, it becomes a flower, and another bud forms.
     The plant is immune to all physical attacks, is immune to all
magic (it absorbs), and has no mind (no mental attacks). It cannot be
pulled from the ground, burnt, frozen, etc.. If the dirt around the
plant is dug up, the plant can be moved however (but digging
automatically opens 3d4 buds). The plant can be destroyed in two ways
- if all the flowers fall off or it dies. If it reaches 20 feet, it
falls over and dies. The plant's parts can be used as components in any
spell which requires appropriate plant matter as a material component.
The spell will function at x2 effectiveness in all respects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

33.  A classic beanstalk with a 25-foot diameter rips out of the ground
and grows straight up into the air. Characters that are above the 25
foot area will be lifted into the air on top of the beanstalk. They
must make a dexterity check to keep from falling off. The beanstalk
grows at a rate of 50 feet per round to maximum of 1000 feet. The DM
has a few options. He may opt to let the characters relive the Jack-
and-the-Beanstalk story (or a variation*) if he wants to take the time
to create the castle in the clouds and its occupants. A variation, an
Air Elemental city would also be very exciting. For the DM that doesn't
want to take the time, he can just have the characters looming 1000
feet in the air with no hope of getting down easily.

* Here is some suggestions for a RPG variation of the Jack & the
Beanstalk story.
     As the climbing characters pass through the clouds, they see a not
just a large castle, but actually a giant-sized one, seemingly resting
on the clouds. The characters find that they can walk on the cloud as
if it were solid, and there's even a giant-sized forest growing out of
the clouds.
        If the characters enter the castle (and why wouldn't they if
they've just climbed a very big beanstalk?), they find that it is the
domain of an extra-powerful Cloud Giant (or not so extra-powerful if
it's a lower-level party). They may also find golden eggs (each worth
200 gold pieces) laid by an unusual goose, and maybe even a talking
harp. If they run into the giant, well, you can figure out what he says
(Fee, Fie, Fo, Fum...).
        The beanstalk can be cut through by normal weapons in 50 rounds
(1 round per foot). Other, faster ways of destroying the beanstalk are
also possible. Once the beanstalk is completely severed in one place,
the castle, cloud, forest, etc. disappear.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

34.  The bean instantly grows into a small bush. On this bush are small
roughly 1d20+10 berries. Roll on Table A to get the type of berries on
the bush. Note that the DM may opt to make a variety of these berries
on the bush and roll for each individual berry.


TABLE A: Results (1d4)

     1: The berries are goodberries. These berries either enable a
hungry creature of approximately man-size to eat one and be as well-
nourished as if a full normal meal were eaten, or else cure 1 point of
physical damage from wounds or other similar causes, subject to a
maximum of 8 points of such curing in and 24-hour period.
     2: The berries are rotten badberries. These berries appear
wholesome but each actually delivers 1 point of poison damage (no
saving throw) if ingested.
     3: The berries are Mr. Yech green berries. Anyone who eats even a
single berry must save vs. poison at -2 or become addicted, and attempt
to eat all the berries on the bush. Obviously, if several people become
addicted, there could be problems. Some may even try to cultivate the
bush and create many bushes with these addictive berries.
     4: These berries are Smurf berries. Other than being real yummy,
the only effect they have is making the eater feel flighty. In fact,
the eater may start singing a "La la la la la la" song.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

35.  A bush grows from the ground. It grow beautiful flowers and 4d4
colored fruits. The fruits taste bad but give a lot of color. For
example, if you eat a blue fruit your whole mouth will turn a beautiful
blue. The colored effect will eventually wear off in 1d4 weeks. A more
useful use for the fruit is to smash them. Smashing these fruits will
give a beautiful creamy paint which can be applied as make-up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

36.  A small thorn bush grows from the bean. In five rounds, the bush
begins to grow very rapidly covering 10 cubic feet per round. The
result is a thicket of thorny wood that entwine and entangle
everything. The thicket has a strength of 10 for purposes of bursting
through doors, walls, etc.. Creatures suffer 1d6 points of damage from
thorns once the thicket entangles them. Creatures must hack and slash
through at a movement rate of 10 feet per round (or 20 feet per round
for larger-than-man-sized creatures). The thicket will continue to
expand until it reaches a water source of at least 10 gallons or it
can't reach a source with 24 hours (ex. the thicket fills up a dungeon
searching for water but can't escape the dungeon; thus it dies in 24
hours). Once it comes in contact with water it will never grow again.
It will continue to live if a supply of water is present but otherwise
will die.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

37.  Vines grow out of the ground at a rate of 5 feet per round. They
attempt to entangle all creatures with 50 cubic feet. Any creature in
the area of effect is subject to this entanglement. A creature that
rolls a successful dexterity check can escape, moving at only 10 feet
per round. He must make a check each round until out of the effected
area.
     Besides immobilizing creatures, the vines have 5-20 rot grubs (AC
9; MV 1; HD 1; hp 1; #AT 0; Dmg Nil; THAC0 Nil; MC2) that attack
creatures entangled.
     Also, when the vines are cut, they will begin screaming and
wailing. After getting out of this messy situation, creative characters
may attempt to cultivate these vines into a wonderful alarm system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

38.  Many rubbery, black tentacles grow out of the ground and grow to a
length of up to 30 square feet. A tentacle has an armor class of 4 and
requires 30 points to destroy. Any creature within 30 feet is subject
to attack. The target of a tentacle attack must roll a successful
dexterity check. Success indicates that the target suffers 1d4 points
of damage from contact with the tentacle, and then the tentacle is
destroyed. Failure indicates that the damage inflicted 2d4 points, the
ebon member is wrapped around its subject, and damage will be 3d4
points on the second and succeeding rounds. Since these tentacles have
no intelligence to guide them, there is the possibility that they
entwine any object - a tree, post, pillar - or continue to squeeze a
dead opponent. A grasping hold established by a tentacle remains until
the tentacle is destroyed by some form of attack or until it disappears
in 10 hours.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

39.  As soon as the bean is planted, a small rain cloud appears 30'
above the ground (or lower, if the ceiling is too low). One round
later, it releases a lightning bolt for 8d8 damage to anyone standing
within 10' of where the bean was planted. It then pours down rain for
1d10 rounds, before disappearing without a trace.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

40.  A cloud gushes out of the ground and rises to a position above the
where the bean was planted. After completing its forming which takes
1d6+1 rounds, the cloud spans a 20-foot radius. From the cloud it rains
(so to speak). Roll on Table A to see what it rains. The rain lasts for
1d10+20 rounds.


TABLE A: Rain (1d4)

     1: One-hundred, small, multi-colored, rubber balls fall per round.
All in the area that attempt to move must make a successful dexterity
check or trip and fall. The balls remain, causing further checks every
round until they are removed.
     2: 1d20+10 cats and dogs fall from the cloud per round. All in the
area must make a successful dexterity check or suffer 1d10 points of
pet damage. Note that the animals are of a variety of types and can be
quite a bother in the end.
     3: Great hail stones pound down. All in the area will suffer 3d10
points of damage.
     4: Sleet falls from the cloud. The sleet blinds creatures within
its area for the duration. The ground in the area becomes icy, thus
slowing movement by 50%, and making it 50% probable that a creature
trying to move in the slips and falls.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

41.  A tombstone springs up from the ground. The only writing on it is
"Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust". Heavy dark clouds form in the sky, a
brisk wind begins to blow, and a loud deep-sounding bell resonates
throughout the area. The DM should assign a number to all creatures
with above animal intelligence that are in a 50 foot radius of the
tombstone. Then he should roll a die or dice that will randomly pick
one of these creatures.
     Within three rounds of the tombstone's emergence, a skeleton with
a hooded black robe appears beside the tombstone. The skeleton says in
a deep voice, "For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee!" and points
to the tombstone on which the picked creature's name appears. The
skeleton cannot be harmed or touched, it will only stand there in
silence waiting until the soon-to-be-fought battle is over and then
fade away. (Note that everybody hears the skeleton in their own native
language.)
     One round later, a venerable Shadow Dragon (AC -10; MV 18, FL
30(D), Jp 3; HD 18; hp 144; #AT 3+special; Dmg 1-6/1-6/3-18; THAC0 19;
MCGA) dives out of the sky. It will focus its attacks on the creature
that has been marked for death. The dragon will fight until the death
of itself or the marked creature. If the dragon kills the marked
creature, the marked creature (and all its possessions will disappear)
and the dragon will vanish after making a dramatic exit. If the dragon
dies, the marked creature's name fades from the tombstone and the
dragon vanishes. All magical effects that the tombstone created will
dissipate. The only thing that remains is the tombstone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

42.  A stone 6' X 6' column rips out of the ground where the bean was
planted, and rises to a height of 33'. Thirteen 6' X 6' columns raise
to a height of 13' and form a circle around the larger center column.
     At sunset the next day, the columns will shatter, releasing EVIL
demons. The main column holds a Nabassu (AC 4; MV 15, FL 15; HD 5; hp
42; #AT 3; Dmg 2-8/2-8/3-12; THAC0 15; MMII p.40) and the thirteen
smaller columns hold Type III Demons (AC -4; MV 9; HD 10; hp 80; #AT 5;
Dmg 2-12/2-12/1-3/1-3/2-5; THAC0 11; MM p.18).
     The demons will not necessarily attack the people in the immediate
area preferring to get on with their destruction/conquest of the Prime
Material Plane. Its all up to the DM. The characters may decide not to
worry about the demons if the demons avoid them, but the DM should make
them feel guilty and responsible for releasing such terrible evil into
the world.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

43.  A small wooden sign pops up out of the ground. It reads, "Look
Up!" Whenever anybody looks up, an item will fall on him no matter
where he is standing. This effect will happen to anybody within 500
feet. Also, nothing will happen after an hour goes by. Roll on Table A
to see what item falls and what damage it will cause.


TABLE A: Falling Item (1d6)

1:  egg                  none
2:  pillow               none
3:  cream pie            none
4:  small table          1d6
5:  big rock             2d20 and constitution check for unconscious
6:  anvil                10d10 and constitution check for unconscious

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

44.  A bright flash of light temporarily blinds everybody for 1 round.
When they recover their sight, everything they see is in black and
white. Also, a sharply dressed man with an articulate voice stands in
front of them. He is from another dimension - not just a dimension of
sight and sound but of mind, the characters next stop is The Twilight
Zone. This man (referred to as Rod Serling) has no substance, he is
merely an image. He greets the characters and gives them an excellent
introduction to where they will be taken.
     The place they will be taken is another dimension. Everything they
see will be in black and white. The place will have boundaries and
limitations, but this will become obvious to the DM because the
characters are entering... TV Land. The DM can pick the show he wants
the characters to enter. Preferably, the show will be one that the DM
is knowledgeable about, and of course it must be in B&W. Table A lists
a few suggestions that the DM may consider. The DM can have the
characters enter an actual plot from one of these shows or he can just
let them roam around and soak it all in... whatever the DM wants, after
all this is The Twilight Zone.
     The DM can leave the characters in the dimension for as long as
he wants. When they return though, they will only have been gone for 30
minutes.


TABLE A: Television Shows

1  The Andy Griffith Show          6  Leave It To Beaver
2  I Love Lucy                     7  My Three Sons
3  The Lone Ranger                 8  Bewitched
4  Dragnet                         9  Gilligan's Island
5  Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.            10  Perry Mason


NOTE: Some of the shows can be found in color. In fact, in some the
majority of shows were in color, however early shows were in black and
white and are therefore listed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

45.  A wishing well springs up out of the ground. A wooden sign on it
states, "one copper per wish". Any character that throws a copper piece
in the well receives a wish as per the wish spell. DMs should be
mischievous and twist the wish into something that the characters don't
expect. The well will lose its magical ability to give out wishes after
4 wishes have been made.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

46.  A magnificent table, chairs, service, and a great feast that
serves 1d10+5 people fly out of the ground. The feast take one full
hour to consume and the magical effects do not set in until after this
hour is over. Roll on Table A to get the type of feast. Roll on Table B
to get the magical effect of eating the feast. Everything remains after
the feast except what was consumed.


TABLE A: Type of Feast (1d2)

     1: A normal feast of normal food and drink.
     2: The feast is a bean feast (i.e. everything has a basis of
beans). Some of the foods are baked beans, bean dip, soybean burgers,
bean curd, jelly beans dessert, chili, bean pie, and bean salad. Some
drinks are bean wine, bean milkshake, and bean juice. Besides the
magical effect from Table B, the eaters will have a terrible (and
noisy) gas problem.


TABLE B: Magical Effects (1d4)

     1: Just a normal feast, but an hour later everybody is hungry.
     2: Those partaking of the feast are cured of all diseases, are
immune to poison for 12 hour, and are healed of 1d4+4 points of damage
after imbibing the beverage that is part of the feast. Also, the feast
raises their attack dice rolls by +1 for 1d6 hours. Furthermore, during
this same period, the people who consumed the feast are immune to fear,
hopelessness, and panic.
     3: Those partaking of the feast will SWELL up to the maximum
weight for their race and gender (like the bratty kid who ate the
blueberry stuff in Charlie and Chocolate Factory and swelled up into a
big blueberry). Dexterity is lowered by 5, strength by 3, and
constitution by 1. They could either lose the weight by exercise,
fasting, or a Remove Curse spell.
     4: The participants in the feast are poisoned and must save vs.
poison or suffer 5d6 points of damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

47.  The ground immediately swells, then gives birth to a 20 foot
radius sphere of Earth. The miniature planet is identical to Earth.
Currently it is as it was billions and billions of years ago. If
characters watch carefully, they should see the evolution of the Earth.
     Among other things, it quickly turns green with tiny vegetation.
Then, it has tiny lizards (dinosaurs) slithering around and eating each
other. Then, the planet covers with ice then the ice melts. To
continue, miniscule versions of the known races come to cover the
planet, having wars, etc.. Then, tall square buildings pop up all over
the land. Machines take orbit and little missiles fly all over the
planet and burst into tiny fireballs over the entire globe.
     The DM can have the planet demise if he wants. Of course, some
players may want to miniaturize their characters and let them visit
this new world. This world can be just something fun to watch for a
while or it could lead to a lot of exciting adventures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

48.  A golem (Table A) rises up, wearing the bean on a necklace. Roll
on Table B to find out what action the golem will take.


TABLE A: Type of Golem

     1: Flesh Golem (AC 9; MV 8; HD 9; hp 40; #AT 2; Dmg 2-16(2-8)/2-
        16(2d8); THAC0 11; MC1)
     2: Clay Golem (AC 7; MV 7; HD 11; hp 50; #AT 1; Dmg 3-30(3d10);
        THAC0 9; MC1)
     3: Stone Golem (AC 5; MV 6; HD 14; hp 60; #AT 1; Dmg 3-24(3d8);
        THAC0 7; MC1)
     4: Iron Golem (AC 3; MV 6; HD 18; hp 80; #AT 1; Dmg 4-40(4d10);
        THAC0 3; MC1)


TABLE B: Action (1d4)

     1: The golem is devoted and under the command of the planter.
     2: The golem attacks the planter and anybody who combats it.
     3: The golem wanders off because it has no true master and thus
has no direction or purpose.
     4: The golem has intelligence of 12 and will act accordingly. The
golem could become a PC or henchman if the DM allows it. The golem is
probably more suited as a unique NPC.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

49.  A residence grows from the ground. It grows in stages.

Stage 1:  Within one hour, the bean grows into a nice lean-to capable
of holding three people.

Stage 2: After 1d4 hours, it transforms into a 10' X 10' bamboo hut.

Stage 3: After 1d6 hours, it transforms into a small, comfy bungalow.

Stage 4: After 1d8 hours, it transforms into a a delightful large home.

Stage 5: After 1d12 hours, it transforms into a pleasant manor.

Stage 6: After 1d20 hours, it transforms into an extensive villa.

The transformations will not harm people and items. People and items in
the area of effect will just end up inside the residence. Vindictive
DMs can populate the residences with nasty things. Interesting
scenarios can develop if the characters claim ownership, especially if
it is on somebody else's land.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

50.  Jelly Bean. Within a round after the bean is planted, a hole
appears in the ground approximately one foot in diameter. One round
later, an ochre jelly (AC 8; MV 3; HD 6; hp 48; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12; THAC0
15; MC1) gushes up from the hole.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

51.  Pinto Bean. This Bean causes the sudden appearance of a pinto. The
soul owner of the pinto is the planter, the certificate of ownership
will be with the pinto(s). Roll on Table A for the type of pinto.


TABLE A: Pintos (1d6)

     1: A fine, white with brown patches, pinto horse named "Pinto"
gallops over the horizon to the planter.
     2: A merchant ship with "Pinto" carved in its side flies from the
sky and plops down beside the planter. Note that the ship is normal and
will not be able to fly after its arrival thus the planter must
somehow get the ship to water if he wants to use it properly. A flag on
the mast states in golden letters "Columbus is a weenie!".
     3: A mysterious glass & steel horseless carriage drives up to the
planter. Unfortunately, after its arrival the fuel gauge indicates
empty (its out of gas) and the planter will probably not be able to get
gasoline in a medieval setting. Vindictive DMs may have the vehicle
spontaneously combust in 1d20 rounds, treat as Delayed Fireball.
     4: A normal pinto bean falls from the sky. Then another and
another until a rain shower of pinto beans fall from the sky. This
shower will last for 1d4 hours.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

52.  Refried Bean. After this bean is activated, the temperature of the
50' X 50' square plot of land around the bean increases by 30 degrees
per round for five rounds. After this, the ground cools at the same
rate to normal. This cycle repeats three times (thus the name).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

53.  String Bean. Truly sadistic, this bean emits string-instrument
music at a punishing volume. All within 50 feet save vs. fear or flee
for 4d6 rounds. The DM should make the music his favorite song keeping
in mind that it must be from all string instruments. It is suggested
that "Duelling Banjos" would be very, very effective.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

54.  String Bean. A many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar
to spider webs but far larger and tougher fly out of the ground. These
masses anchor to solid and diametrically opposed points. The web covers
an area of eight 10' X 10' X 10' cubes and the webs are at least 10
feet thick. Creatures caught within the webs, or simply touching them,
become stuck among the gluey fibers.
     When the webs shoot out of the ground, everybody in the area of
effect must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If
successful, he jumps free. If unsuccessful, he is caught.
     Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through one
foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break
through two feet per round. Also note that the webs are flammable.
     See the Web spell for more information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

55. String Bean. 1d4 rounds after the bean is planted, a small bush
will grow out of the ground. The bush will produce a continuous rope
(Table A) at the rate of 1d4 feet per day. Cutting the rope will not
affect future rope growth.


TABLE A: Type of Rope

1  Hemp Rope
2  Silk Rope
3  Nylon Rope
4  Twine

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

56.  Green Bean. The planter's skin takes on a dark green hue. Roll on
Table A the duration.


TABLE A: Duration (1d4)

1  1d8 week                        3  1d6 months
2  1d4 years                       4  permanent

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

57.  Garbonzo Bean. An egg pops up and immediately hatches. The chick
(1/10th hit point) from the egg naturally thinks the planter is its
mother and will act accordingly. Good-aligned characters may have a
responsibility to keep it alive! (And try keeping it quiet and fed!)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

58.  Snap Bean. A Bonesnapper (AC 4; MV 6; HD 4; hp 32; #AT 2; Dmg
1-8/1-4; THAC0 17; MCGA) emerges from the ground and roams around. Of
course with adventurers, combat is sure to ensue.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

59.  Coffee Bean. This bean causes everything in a 40 cubic foot area
to move at double their normal movement and attack rates. They also
gain a -2 to initiative. This haste effect last 10 rounds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

60.  Chili Bean. A cone-shaped area of extreme cold that originates
from the ground and extends outward in a cone five feet long and ten
feet in diameter. It drains heat and causes 1d4+10 points of damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

61.  Baked Bean. A fireball bursts out of the ground. It flies around
in a low roar and will strike the planter within 1d4 rounds. Roll on
Table A to get the result of the fireball.


TABLE A: Results (1d4)

     1: Upon contact, it does 10d6 points of damage (save for 1/2
damage) to everybody (including the planter) within a 20-foot radius of
the planter.
     2: Upon contact, it explodes doing no damage but leaving a large
(20-foot radius) cloud of black, sulfuric smoke. The smoke is harmless
unless contained in a small environment (ex. dungeon) where it can't
disperse in which case characters could suffer inhalation damage (DM's
prerogative).
     3: Upon contact, it explodes into a large pile of bat guano. No
damage will be inflicted on the people affected, but to be covered with
bat guano shouldn't be exactly pleasant for the characters.
     4: Upon the non-damage contact, a Fire Elemental (AC 2; MV 12; HD
12; hp 96; #AT 1; Dmg 3-24; THAC0 9; MC1) appears. He cannot return to
his home plane until the planter or he is destroyed. The elemental will
be relentless in its task to destroy the planter of the bean and
anybody who engages in combat with it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

62. Kidney Bean. Roll on Table A to get effects of this bean.


TABLE A: Effects (1d4)

     1: A big sack of kidney beans pops out of the ground.
     2: A 10th level fighter with 80 hit points and 19 strength pops
out of the ground. His only form of attack is a kidney punch that does
5 points of damage with a 5% chance of a knockout.
     3: 10d10+10 actual kidneys from actual creatures start falling
from the sky. Accept for being really disgusting, nothing special
happens (of course some characters may want to cook them).
     4: A platinum kidney stone passes out of the ground. The value is
approximately 100 gold pieces.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

63. Red, Black, Green, or Navy Bean. This bean creates an illusion of a
dragon. Roll on Table A to get the type.


Table A: Bean & Dragon

1  Red     Adult Red Dragon
2  Black   Adult Black Dragon
3  Green   Adult Green Dragon
4  Navy    Adult Blue Dragon

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

64.  Lentil Bean. A billowing mass of nauseous vapors rises from the
ground up to 30 yards into the air with an area of effect of 20-foot
cube and lasts 1d10+10 rounds. Any creature caught within the cloud
must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be reeling and unable
to attack because of nausea, for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the cloud.
Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without
suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must
continue to save each round. These poisonous effects can be slowed or
neutralized by appropriate magic. The cloud duration is halved in a
moderate breeze (8-18 m.p.h.) and is dispersed on one round by a
stronger wind.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

65.  Jumping Bean. Roll on Table A to get effects of this bean.


TABLE A: Effects (1d2)

     1: Everybody within 20 feet of where the bean was planted begins
to dance, complete with feet shuffling and tapping. This dance makes it
impossible for the victim to do anything other than caper and prance;
this cavorting worsens Armor Class by -4, makes saving throws
impossible except on a roll of 20, and negates any consideration of a
shield.
     2: Everybody within 20 feet of where the bean was planted can leap
for 1d4+10 rounds. Leaps can be up to 30 feet or straight upward or 10
feet backward. Horizontal leaps forward or backward have only a slight
arc - about two feet per 10 feet of distance traveled. Note that
landing can be very dangerous.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

66.  Jumping Bean. After the bean is planted, it will wiggle back up
out of the ground. Then, it will begin jumping around from six inches
to eight feet off of the ground. The jumping bean will follow the
planter of the bean around bouncing and bobbing being a nuisance. Roll
on Table A to get the duration. There is a 25% that the bean has verbal
capabilities. If it does then the bean will gripe about the planter,
loudly complaining about him, and being generally obnoxious.


TABLE A: Duration (1d4)

1  1d12 day
2  1d8 week
3  1d6 months
4  1d4 years

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

67. Jumping Bean. In 1d6 rounds, a small quivering bush appears with
several beans on it. Once removed from the bush, a bean will bounce 1-2
inches from the ground. This effect will last forever.
     If eaten, a bean gives the eater powers just like Boots of
Striding and Springing for 1d10 turns.
     There will be 2d6 such beans on a bush. If the bush can survive in
its environment, it will produce 2d6 beans every year.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

68. Bean Pole. Roll on Table A to get effects of this bean.


TABLE A: Effects (1d2)

1: A 10d10 foot pole emerges from the ground. Roll 1d6 on the following
to get the material the pole is made of:

     6  ice
2: A tall, slender, skinny, human appears. Details are left to the DM.

        special; THAC0 16; MC2 "Plant, Carnivorous")
     6: REROLL

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

70.  Beanstalk. An Invisible Stalker (AC 3; MV 12; HD 8; hp 64; #AT 1;
Dmg 4-16; THAC0 13; MM p. 55) rises from the ground. It's mission is to
destroy the planter and anything or anybody that interferes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

71.  Beanstalk. A strange beanstalk grows, but not the classic story
type.  The beanstalk grows to 10d10+100 feet high. Roll on Table A to
get the type.


TABLE A: Type of Beanstalk (1d4)

     1: The beanstalk grows to be a very strange colored stalk. Roll
1d6 on Table B to get the color. The bean will bend towards magnetic
north.
     2: The top half of the beanstalk is an illusion. Characters
climbing higher than that point will suddenly find themselves "without
a grip" and must make a successful dexterity check or fall back to
earth. The illusion remains as long as the beanstalk is alive.
     3: The beanstalk has an elevator in it. It will take its
occupants to the top and back down.
     4: The beanstalk whips around in the air at extraordinary speeds.
Things in the air should make a dexterity check or be hit.

        THAC0 17; MC1)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1  up                    3  east             5  north
2  down                  4  west             6  south

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

75.  "Bean seeing you." Random people (DM's decision) become invisible
as in the spell Improved Invisibility for 3d4 rounds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

76.  "It's bean a long time." A time-stop field is created within a 10
foot radius for a duration from Table A. This field stops time in the
area, nothing ages or moves in this field. Anything that enters the
field will halt as well.


TABLE A: Duration (1d8)

1  1d12 rounds                     5  1d8 turns

     1: All magic within a 30-foot cube is neutralized or negated as
the dispel magic at 12th Level.
     2: A green ray sweeps a 10-foot cube area and disintegrates all
physical non-living material.
     3: The planter must save vs. spell or turn into a bean. As a bean,
he will still be the same size, abilities, and powers. He will just be
a big bean with arms. legs, and a face. A remove curse or wish will
remove this effect.
     4: The planter becomes his formal self of 1d10 years ago. In other
words, however the planter was 1d10 years ago is what he is now. For
example, if he was a 1st level character before, then he is transformed
to that level once again. Also, his age, attributes, etc. will change.
All current possessions remain, only he personally changes, not
material things.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

78.  "You've been beaned." Three-foot orbs fly out of the ground (one
for each creature). They automatically hit. The effect each orb has is
separate.  Roll on Table A to get effects of each orb.


TABLE A: Effects (1d4)

     1: This orb cause 4d4 points of damage on impact.
     2: This orb causes the victim to be held (like a hold spell) for
        1d10 hours.
     3: This orb slimes the victim with a disgusting bean slime.
     4: This orb bursts into colorful lights that say "Eat at Joe's".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

79.  "Beans always give ya gas." A jet of natural gas shoots up from
the place where the bean was planted for 1d20 rounds. Note that the
natural gas has no order but this gas will have that disgusting smell
that is added to natural gas in the "real" world. If in a closed area,
the gas will suffocate everyone in 2d6 rounds. Also, any fire will
ignite the gas. BOOM!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

80.  Honey Beeeeeeean. After planted, the bean will grow into a bee-
hive cone. Roll on Table A to get the contents.


TABLE A: Contents of Cone (1d4)

     1: The cone contains normal honey. It is excellent food and equal
to iron rations.
     2: The cone contains royal jelly. It is equal to 2-5 potions of
extra-healing with a side of effect of cure disease for each. It also
can be made into sufficient unguent to treat aging. The unguent
preserves a youthful look for up to 1 year and 2-5 such preparations
can be made from royal jelly. Charisma will remain unaffected by age
when the unguent is used continually without interruption.
     3: The cone contains 4d4 golden beans. Each bean will sustain a
consumer for one day, equal to one day's worth of food & water. The
bean will not make any difference with stamina (i.e. if one is tired
and eats it, he'll not be hungry or thirsty, but still tired).
     4: The cone contains mad bees. Roll on Table B to get the type of
bees.


TABLE B: Bees  (1d4)

     1-2: 1d10 worker honeybees (AC 6; MV 9, FL 30; HD 3+1; hp 25;
          #AT 1; Dmg 1-3+poison; THAC0 17; MMII page 17)
     3:   1d4 soldier honeybees (AC 5; MV 12, FL 30; HD 4+2; hp 34;
          #AT 1; Dmg 1-4+poison; THAC0 17; MMII page 17)
     4:   1d4 bumblebees (AC 5; MV 6, FL 24; HD 6+4; hp 52; #AT 1;
          Dmg 1-6+poison; THAC0 15; MMII page 17)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

81.  Beans! Beans! Beans! Beans! Beans! Beans! Beans! Beans! BEANS!
     When this bean is planted, a flowering bush will grow immediately.
Then, after one day, it will grow ripened fruits. The fruits have a
hard shell, but when cracked open they contain 2d4 more beans inside.
If these beans are planted, more of the pretty, flowering bushes will
grow bearing more fruits. This can cause some real havoc if these beans
are continually planted given there fast reproductive rate.
     If one of the beans is consumed, the following effects will occur.
(Note the beans are much tastier if cooked over an open fire with some
brown sugar and water rather than eating them dry.) The eater of the
bean begins to fluctuate prolifically. Gas erupts from their
hindquarters at least once per minute, starting 3 minutes after
consumption. Charisma is reduced by 6 until effects are removed. All
attacks are made at -1 to hit because of the violent jolts (it's a bad
case of the butt hiccups). All reaction results also have a -3 penalty.
This affliction can only be removed by a remove curse, or the cure
disease ability of a Paladin (the cure disease spell will not work).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

82.  Bigbean's Hands. 10d10+10 hands from 5 feet to 15 feet (1d10+5 for
each hand) long rise up from the ground within 100 square feet. Each
hand has an armor class of 0 and hit points of 2d10+10. A hand vanishes
when destroyed and otherwise is permanent. Note that hands have a
reach/range of 10 feet when attacking. Roll for each hand on Table A to
see what the hand does.


TABLE A: Hands (1d6)

     1: The hand does nothing.
     2: The hand only makes a gesture by making a clenched fist and
        raising its middle finger.
     3: The hand waves.
     4: The hand punches nearby targets causing 4d6 points of damage
        and stunning the victim for three rounds.
     5: The hand grasps any nearby target and squeezes the victim.
        During the 1st round the victim suffers damage of 1d10 points,
        2nd round & 3rd round 4d10, the 4th and beyond 4d10 points.
     6: The hand begins to snap its fingers and crack its knuckles. the
        sound is magically enhanced, causing everybody within 15 feet
        to go deaf for 1d4 rounds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

83.  Trouble with Tribbles. When activated, tribbles (from the Star
Trek show) begin popping up from where the Bean was planted. They
surface at the rate of six tribbles per round. In addition, those on
the surface immediately begin eating any available plant matter, and
these tribbles asexually reproduce at the rate of one per round per two
tribbles.
     There are only two known ways to stop this process. One way, dig
up the bean and quickly devour it (gulp!) thus exposing the bean to
stomach acid. The second option is to scream in the vicinity of the
bean "Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a botanist!"
     No monster record sheet is necessary for the tribbles just watch
Star Trek to learn about these nasties. Tribbles are multicolored
4-inch diameter furballs. They reproduce for as long as they are alive
and plant matter is available. The existing tribbles have an armor
class of 10 and 1 hp each, but continue multiplying.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

84.  A factory-type whistle pops out of the ground and blows really
loudly for 1d10+10 rounds. The whistle will not cause any permanent
deafness but everybody will not be able to hear one another until the
whistle stops blowing (though they may have a slight ringing in their
ears for a few days). The whistle summons a monster(s). The DM should
roll on his favorite Monster Summoning Table to decide what monster(s)
appear. For those that want specifics, roll 1d8 to decide what monster
summoning level should be used. The monster(s) will arrive in 1d10
rounds and will attack everybody except the planter (unless the planter
engages in combat).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

85.  An old, wooden coffin comes out of the ground. If a character
doesn't open it within 5 rounds, it will slowly open on its own. It
contains an undead creature. Roll on Table A to get the type.
     To make things a little more exciting (especially for high-level
characters), the DM can have 1d10+10 coffins pop out of the ground
within 100 square feet.


TABLE A: Undead

01  zombie                         07  ghoul
02  shadow                         08  wight
03  ghast                          09  wraith
04  mummy                          10  spectre
05  vampire                        11  ghost
06  lich                           12  special*

* Choose a unique undead not listed or a creature from the Lower
  Planes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

86.  Upon planting the bean, the earth begins to shake. Three rounds
later, out of the ground steps Merlon Olsen. He is holding a bouquet of
roses with a card that says FTD. He walks over to a random person and
says "These are for you from (planter's name)". He then disappears.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

87.  Upon planting the bean, the earth begins to shake. One round after
the bean is planted all unsheathed weapons (includes rods, staves,
wands) become Jello Pudding Pops (magical weapons get a saving throw).
Three rounds later, a really nice black man with a 1d6+4 kids emerges
from the ground. They sing jello songs, tell jokes, laugh, and ask if
the party like their jello pudding pops. Eventually they will wonder
off in search for Willy Wonka and Candyland (the DM might want to turn
this into an fun and elaborate adventure if the characters follow).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

88.  Upon planting the bean, paperback novels begin to grow from the
ground within a 100 mile radius. Roll for each novel a person picks up
on Table A to get the kind of novel it is.


TABLE A: Type of Novel (1d4)

1  Western
2  Detective
3  Sci-Fi
4  Fantasy
5  Love
6  Adventure


Novels continue to grow until the entire area of effect is completely
covered. All of the books are truly poor-reading novels and the only
way to stop the growth is to pick one up and read the entire thing
(ugh!). Whomever reads a paperback novel must make a saving throw vs.
magic or permanently lose 1d4 points of intelligence.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

89.  After the bean is planted, a large red and white tent begins to
grow out of the ground. It is a square tent of the typical marketplace
type. After a full round, the tent is fully erected. Anyone looking in
the tent can see shelves full of all sorts of wondrous items, rare,
beautiful, magical, and antique.
     Seconds later, a tanned face appears with a long dark moustache,
and a puffy white turban around his head. He greets the characters
saying, "Greetings most worthy sirs and madames, my name is Omalar!
What magical delight may I serve thee today?" He smiles broadly and
rubs his hands expectantly.
     The adventurers may then ask for and purchase any magic item that
the DM offers. The DM is advised to sell only non-violent magical items
or those that have a small experience point value. Also, artifacts
should be excluded. A DM should be careful not to allow to much power
to fall in the hands of the characters.
     Each item costs double the price listed. Vindictive DMs may take
half of the experience point value of the item and subtract it from the
purchaser's experience.
     Note that the shop cannot be entered. If the shopkeeper is
attacked or molested in any way that is even partially unfriendly, the
shop instant-aneously disappears and Omalar the Wondrous Shopkeeper
turns into an Yagnnodaemon (AC 1; MV 18; HD 13+13; hp 117; #AT 1; Dmg
1-10+12; THAC0 7; MMII p.31) or other lesser demon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

90.  A bunch of material flies out of the ground to form a nice
campsite. The center of the campsite contains a fire (it will need fuel
after the ten hours).
     The fire is surrounded by 1d4+4 tents. Each tent contains a
bedroll, four day's worth of iron rations, a novel of excellent
quality, one bottle of excellent wine, a jug containing two gallons of
excellent ale, a barrel containing two gallons of excellent beer, a new
random weapon, a change of clothes (shirt, pants, socks, underwear), a
lantern, and an extra wool blanket.
     Oats for 1d4+4 horses is in the campsite. There is also a stack of
wood good for ten hours of burning.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

91.  This bean produces a rich mineral vein in the ground. Roll on
Table A to get the type of mineral vein. The vein will yield
approximately 100d10 bars of the mineral. A typical bar is equal to 100
pieces based on the mineral (as in gold pieces, silver pieces, etc.).


TABLE A: Type of Mineral Vein (1d6)

1  Gold
2  Silver
3  Copper
4  Lead

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

92.  This bean grows into a small beanstalk (1 foot). The beanstalk
will uproot and follow the planter as a dog would follow its master.
The beanstalk (AC 10; MV 4; HD 1/2; hp 4; #AT 1; Dmg 1 bite; THAC0 20)
has a bipedal form and animal intelligence. It must be watered once
every two days for approximately two hours or else it will die. Also,
the beanstalk has a bond with the planter. If the planter takes more
than 5d10 points of damage (roll once), the beanstalk will immediately
wither and die.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

93.  This bean causes a a 100 cubic feet area to be strangely effected.
Roll on Table A to get the strange effect that has taken place in the
area and roll on Table B to get the duration of the effect.


TABLE A: Strange Effect (1d6/2 round up)

     1: Time Stop. The flow of time is stopped in the area of effect.
All creatures (except for those of demigod and greater status or unique
creatures) and everything else are frozen in their actions, for they
are literally between ticks of the time clock. Nothing can enter the
area of effect without being stopped in tome also.
     2: Magic Dead. The area of effect is magic dead. No magic will
work. It won't destroy things like magic items or memorized spells,
these things will just not work in the area of effect.
     3: Wild Magic Zone. The area of effect is a wild magic zone (see
Tome of Magic). In addition, 1d4 times per day a random spell chosen
from the Wild Magic school (mage) or the Chaos sphere (priest) affects
the area.
     4: Blessed/Sacred Ground. The area becomes holy land. Any acts of
violence done in the area of effect will cause the offenders to suffer
1d10+10 points of damage. There is a 25% chance that the land may gain
the attention of a good deity.
     5: Cursed Ground. The area becomes cursed land. Evil creatures are
attracted to the area. The chance of encountering evil creatures is
quadrupled. There is a 25% chance that the land may gain the attention
of a evil deity.


TABLE B: Duration (1d4)

1  1d20 hours
2  1d12 day
3  1d10 week
4  1d8  months
5  1d6  years
6  1d4  centuries

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

94.  After being planted and watered, the bean will sprout and grow
within 1d4 rounds into a rather large bush with beautiful flowers and
round colorful fruit the size of grapefruit. The entire bush (including
leaves, flowers, and fruit) is completely edible, being entirely made
of a sweet candy like substance(s) rather reminiscent of the "plants"
in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The plant will continue to
produce fruit, leaves, etc. as long as it is watered (preferably sugar
water).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

95.  When the bean is planted and watered, a 10 foot long, 3 foot
diameter metallic rod grows from the ground. The rod attracts all metal
within a 100 foot radius. A strength of 18+ is the only thing that
could keep metal from flying to the rod.
     The rod drips an acidic-fluid to dissolve the metal it attracts.
Magical items get a saving throw.
     The rod will continue to function until it receives 100 points of
damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

96.  The bean grows into a normal looking bean plant with one
abnormally large pod. When the pod splits open (in one turn or by a
person), there is a six month old child inside. Roll on Table A to get
the race of the child. Roll on Table B to get the gender of the child.


TABLE A: Race (1d6)

1  Dwarf
2  Elf
3  Half-Elf
4  Gnome
5  Halfling
6  Other (Orc, Goblin, Demon, etc.)


TABLE B: Sex (1d2)

1  male
2  female

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

97.  A thick, white, swirling fog rises from the ground and spans a 100
foot radius. Vision is reduced to 3d4 feet. Roll on Table A for the
effect of the fog.


TABLE A: Effects (1d4)

     1: Within 5 rounds after the arrival of the fog, sounds of a
coastal region can be heard. Among other sounds, there is a fog horn,
sea gulls, and the clanking of bells. Searching through the fog finds
nothing and is uneventful, there is only the sounds.
     If the party is high level, vindictive DMs may have a pirate,
ghost ship appear containing an undead crew.
     The fog will dissipate in 1d6 days.

     2: The fog will choke all living creatures. Each creature will
suffer two points of damage per round unless they leave the fog. The
fog will dissipate in 1d100 rounds.

     3: The fog is the mystical fog synonymous with Ravenloft. The
Ravenloft plane is reaching out for the characters. And so a new
adventure begins in a new land.
     DMs not familiar with Ravenloft may have the fog teleport the
characters somewhere else like another continent, the Outer Planes, the
Lower Planes, etc..
     The fog dissipates once the characters are trapped in Ravenloft.

     4: All creatures in the fog will start hallucinating. Each person
perceives their friend and comrades as their enemies or some dangerous
monsters (ex. minotaurs, lesser demons, lesser devils, demons). This
can cause some serious problems if everybody engages in combat. When
somebody is attacked, they perceive the attack as a natural/normal
attack of the attacker (ex. a fighter may be viewed by a friend as a
troll, when the fighter attacks, his attack will be viewed by the
friend as a troll's clawing attack).
     DMs should handle the combat so that the players don't know they
are fighting each other. The DM might tell the players that the party
seems to have magically separated in the fog and now each character
stands before a number of enemies/monsters (equal to the number of
other party members of course). The DM must fake combat rolls for the
"enemies". Also, he must me manipulative with the presentation of
damage to the characters so that the players won't realize what really
is going on. For example, if character A just hit an enemy (really
character B) for 6 points of damage, then the DM can't just yell out
that character B receives 6 points of damage from his enemy (character
A) because what really is happening will be obvious.
     The fog dissipated in 1d10+10 rounds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

98.  A faerie(s) pops out of the ground. Roll on Table A to get the
type.


TABLE A: Type of Faerie (1d4)

     1: A Spelljamming ship of the Elven Armada (DM's choice).
     2: 2d10 faerie elves (AC 10; MV 12; HD 1+1; hp 9; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10
        weapon; THAC0 19; MC1).
     3: A homosexual, human male. He will fall in love with the first
        male (any race) he sees.
     4: 100 beautiful butterflies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

99.  A 5 foot long, thin metal rod grows from the ground. Suddenly,
thunder booms through the sky. 1d4 rounds later, lightning strikes all
living beings for 1d6+4 points of damage each.
     In addition, lightning randomly strikes the ground. The lightning
leaves 1d6+10 Javelins of Lightning.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

100.  Bean Bag. A bean bag falls from the sky. Roll on Table A to get
the type.


TABLE A: Type of Bean Bag (1d6)

     1: A bean bag (50 foot radius sphere) falls from the sky and
causes 1d20+20 points of crushing damage to anybody under it.
     2: A small paper sack falls from the sky. It contains 100 jelly
beans of various colors. Yum! Yum!
     3: A huge bean falls from the sky and causes no damage. The bean
is not edible. It is quite soft and manipulative. It could be quite
easy to use the bean as a comfortable chair.
     4: A burlap sack containing normal eatable beans falls from the
sky. The DM may have the bag hits somebody on the head for 1d10+10
points of damage.
     5-6: Another Bag O' Beans identical to this one (except its
completely full) falls from the sky.
