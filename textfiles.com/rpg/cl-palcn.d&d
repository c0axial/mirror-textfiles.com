THE CHAOS KNIGHT

 
 The Chaos Knight is a "paladin" dedicated to disrupting
Order and bringing Chaos to the universe.  He believes that Order
makes society stagnate and that he must preserve the balance by
instigating disorder.  Chaos Knights are always Chaotic Neutral
and oppose the Lawful Neutral Lyans.  The pay homage to a group
of seven faceless powers known collectively as the Lordes of
Chaos.  These Lordes are suspected to abide in the outer plane of
Limbo.  Chaos Knights may begin as humans, but must stop
advancing at 6th level or must attempt the transformation into a
Chaos Lord (see below) (NOT the same as a Lorde of Chaos).
 
 The Chaos Knight can wear only chain mail and lighter armors
because freedom of movement is required for his spellcasting and
thieving abilities.  He may not use a shield.  The Chaos Knight
may use any weapon.  He uses the THAC0 and attacks of a fighter
and may specialize in any melee weapon.  He gets a d10 for hit
points and gets 2 hp per level after 10th level.  He uses the
paladin/ranger table for level advancement.
 
 The prime requisites of the Chaos Knight are Dexterity,
Intelligence, and Charisma.  He receives no bonus spells for high
Wisdom.
 
 The Chaos Knight begins with three weapon proficiencies and
four non-weapon proficiencies.
 
 The special abilities of the Chaos Knight are:
1. The use of the thief functions: Backstab, Pick Pockets, Open
Locks, Hide in Shadows, and Move Silently.  He uses the thieving
bases adjusted for race and dexterity then gets 30 percentage
points to distribute between these abilities.  Every time he goes
up a level, he gets 15 points to add his abilities.
2. He may Detect Law (includes lawful monsters, creatures from
Outer Planes, lawful human(oids), etc.) within 20' for every
level of experience he has (up to 400').
3. He gains a bonus to his saving throws vs. Lawful magic; +1 for
every three levels of xp he has.
4. The Chaos Knight may use Chaotic Neutral holy swords (see
below).
5. Spell casting abilities beginning at second level (see below).
 
 The Chaos Knight also has several restrictions:
1. He must be Chaotic Neutral.
2. He must follow his Ethos: to destroy Law wherever he finds it.
3. He will not voluntarily associate with Lawful people, but may
do so if planning to destroy these people or if his life depends
on it.
4. He cannot keep more treasure than he can carry and must donate
10% of all treasure to a random charity or individual.
5. He cannot own more than 6 magical items at one time.
 The Chaos Knight has fairly potent spell-casting powers
beginning at second level.  He uses the 2nd edition bard spell
casting ability progression table.  He may use spells from the
mage schools Invocation/Evocation, Abjuration (Protection from
Law replaces Protection from Evil), Alteration,
Enchantment/Charm, and Illusion/Phantasm.  He may learn priest
spells from the Elemental sphere.   One additional spell is
detailed below.  This spell, in the form described below, is
usable only by Chaos Knights.  To use spells require no material
components for the Chaos Knight, he needs only to point his
finger at the target and say invoke the powers of Chaos to cast
the spell.  He does not need to keep a spellbook, but does need
to "memorize" spells [if you use memorization; if not, he will
have spell points or whatever else you use].
 
Magickal Chaos
Alteration, Enchantment
Level: 3
Duration: 1 round/level of caster
Range: 10 yards/level of caster
Area of Effect: one opponent or 50' radius
 This spell reproduces the effects of Wild Magic, as it is
known in the Forgotten Realms.  If the target is a person, as
opposed to an area, that person is subject to Magickal Chaos for
the duration of the spell.  Whenever casting a spell, using a
magic item with charges (including potions and scrolls), or using
a miscellaneous magic item, the target must roll on the Magical
Chaos table (from FR Adventures book) to determine the actual
effects of his spell, item, etc.  If cast on an area, everyone
within that area is subject to Magickal Chaos until they leave
the area (or the spell runs out).
 
 
The Chaos Blade
(The Orange Razor)
Intelligence 17  Ego 30 Chaotic Neutral
"Entropos"  "The Rusty Avenger"
 This is the legendary Chaos Blade, a five foot long bastard
sword +3/+5.  Under ordinary circumstances, the blade looks
decrepit and is covered with rust.  The hilt is iron with cheap
gold paint partially covering it.  Basically, the thing looks
like shit.  But upon entering combat with a creature of Law, the
rust flakes off, exposing a awe-inspiring blade of shimmering
colors.  The hilt turns to a pure silvery metal and the sword
starts laughing its ass off.  After undergoing this
transformation, the sword will function as a weapon of speed (as
scimitar of) and will have a random effect whenever a natural 20
is rolled.
Random Effects Table (1d10)
 1-2  Double damage
 3-4  Triple damage
 5Disruption
 6Venom
 7Sharpness
 8Life stealing
 9Vorpal
 0Roll again twice, all effects are cumulative
There are very few of these swords, maybe half a dozen in any
given campaign world.  NO ONE besides a high level (10+) Chaos
Knight will be able to use the sword's special powers.  It will
simply be a rusty, poorly balanced (-2 to hit) eyesore.
