         Chapter 3:

                                  NETROAMING


                           CYBERSPACE AND NETROAMING

              Any character can travel through Cyberspace by using a 
         gadget called a cyberdeck (see p.00).  The character must 
         jack into the cyberdeck by a headset or pinky slot.  The 
         deck, in turn, must be connected to anything that plugs into 
         the wall.  If you don't have a computer handy, just jack into 
         the toaster.  It's all part of the Net.
              Why go to cyberspace?  Because it's the "place" that 
         connects all the phones and computers in the world.  When you 
         call your buddy in another city, neither of you moves, but 
         you meet in cyberspace.  With a cyberdeck, though, you don't 
         just send your voices -- you can see!  Basic cyberspace looks 
         like the inside of a gigantic neon jungle-gym.  There are 
         bars of light in all colors and shapes.  Each character, 
         place and program is represented by a different splash of 
         color, which is constantly changing.  It can be very 
         confusing.  Make a Smarts Roll any time you see something, to 
         understand what it is.  If you roll a 12, you're 
         automatically Boggled.
              Therefore, all but the most experienced Netroamers use a 
         Worldgram (see p.00).  This is a chip that makes cyberspace 
         look and act just like an "ordinary" TOON world.  Characters 
         look (sort of) like themselves, programs look like buildings 
         or animals, attack programs look like weapons, valuable data 
         looks like money, and so on.
              Netroamers must follow the rules of the worldgram that 
         they are in -- unless the Animator decides otherwise, or 
         creates a worldgram with no rules.  No matter what program a 
         Netroamer has, they must blend in with the worldgram unless 
         the Animator thinks they'd be funnier if they didn't.

         GETTING AROUND IN A WORLDGRAM
              Once in the Net, just act as though everything you see 
         is real.  It is... kind of.  You can buy special programs 
         (see p.00) to serve you as weapons, armor, and so on.
              The things that you see are metaphors for the things 
         that are really happening in the Net.  The Animator tells you 
         what you see and you have to figure out what it means.  Some 
         Skills will help; when in doubt, make a Smarts roll.  For 
         instance, suppose you're raiding the Skratchanichi Megacorp 
         to swipe a data file of suspected Toonpunks, and replace it 
         with a file of chicken jokes.  You're using the Dungeons and 
         Toons worldgram.
              When you plug in, the first thing you see is a deep, 
         dark forest (the Net).  You figure out the way to 
         Skratchanichi and start walking.  Soon you are attacked by 
         wolves (random defensive programs).  You defeat them and go 
         on.
              Before long, you see a great black tower (Skratchanichi 
         Megacorp).  In front is a huge dragon (the main defense 
         program).  Maybe you try to fast-talk it to let you by; maybe 
         you fight it (good luck!), or maybe you walk around to look 
         for a back door (which netroamers call a "back door."  Go 
         figure).
              Once you're past the guardian, you explore the rooms of 
         the castle (the different Skratchanichi computers).  Every so 
         often you may be noticed by a castle guard or a monster (more 
         defense programs).  Deal with them quickly, or they may give 
         the alarm (setting off lots of security programs).  Programs 
         which Fall Down won't bother you again on that run.
              Eventually you find the room you want.  There are no 
         guardians, but the door looks funny.  Looking closely, you 
         see a string (a Trapgram!)  With a Set/Remove Traps roll, you 
         get past it.
              Inside the room, the high-security databank is 
         represented by a strongbox with a funny lock (another 
         trapgram).  You fail your Set/Remove Traps roll, and a spear 
         pops out, doing 4 points of damage to your cyberbody.  (When 
         you take all the damage you can to your cyberbody, it Falls 
         Down and yu get booted from the Net by a large steel-toed 
         work boot.)  But you get in and grab the huge, musty book 
         (the data file).  In its place you leave the bag of bats 
         (your joke file).  Perhaps you grab a few jewels (other 
         interesting information) while you're at it.
              Now you've got to get out again.  If you just "unplug", 
         you'll be safe, but you won't have your loot.  So you have to 
         get past the guardians, out of the castle, and back to the 
         place where you entered the Net.
              But as you leave the strongroom, you see a huge, shadowy 
         form -- a gigantic tiger in black armor, holding an enormous 
         broadsword.  It's Yugota Skratchanichi himself!  Uh oh...

         SKILLS AND SHTICKS IN CYBERSPACE
              A Netroamer keeps his normal attributes and skills, and 
         can even get program chips (p.00) to improve them!  He does 
         not get to take his Shticks into cyberspace.  But he can buy 
         Shtickgrams to replace them -- or to give him new Shtciks -- 
         as many as his deck will hold!

         EXTRA ACTIONS
              Time passes faster in cyberspace than it does in 
         realspace, so once a Netroamer plugs in, he gets more than 
         one Action per turn!  How many Actions he gets is based on 
         what type of cyberdeck he's using.  See p.00.


                                  PROGRAMMING

              In cyberspace, you can temporarily change an existing 
         program by making a Fast-Talk roll (to convince it to 
         change).  So, when you hack a security program, you can talk 
         it out of attacking you -- at least right then!  A failed 
         roll will usually cause problems.  Outside of cyberspace, 
         just programming on an ordinary computer, make a Read roll to 
         make a small change.
              To make a big change, or to create a brand-new program, 
         requires the Weird Science Shtick (p.00).  Everything on the 
         Net is by definition Weird.

         THE DENIZENS OF CYBERSPACE
              Everything in Cyberspace looks like something else -- 
         something normal to the worldgram.  The skills 
         See/Hear/Smell, Hide/Spot Hidden and Identify Dangerous Thing 
         will be very useful for avoiding booby-trap programs 
         (including those that look harmless but aren't).
              Most of the creatures in Cyberspace are really programs, 
         there to protect Corporate secrets.  This will mean that most 
         of them have Resist Fast-Talk scores of 9 or better.  They 
         will also have fairly high Fight rolls.
              A Netroamer might also encounter:
              Other Netroamers.  They may be friendly, hostile or just 
         silly.  They may have programs that disguise them!
              Cops.  A cop in the Net may be a total poser, or he may 
         be very skilled, able to Boggle you and track you home.
              AIs.  An AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a computer 
         character.  Max Playroom (p.00) is an AI.  An AI won't have a 
         real body outside the net (Max is an exception, but he's 
         special.)  But an AI will have high Netroaming skills, and as 
         many programs as the Animator wants to give it.
              Natives.  Nobody knows where these folks came from, but 
         there are creatures actually living in cyberspace.  Sometimes 
         they get irritated with Netroamers...

         THINGS TO DO IN CYBERSPACE
              A good Netroamer can get into any computer anywhere.  Or 
         any toaster, washing machine, electric toothbrush... anything 
         that's plugged into the wall... and make it do whatever he 
         wants.  (Look out, because if it's unplugged while you're 
         inside, you're Boggled.)
              Inside a computer, you can get it to do strange 
         things... read, change or delete data files... insert new 
         files, including interesting virus programs... anything to 
         shake up those serious Corps.


                                NETROAMER STUFF

         CYBERDECKS
              Cyberdecks are small, black boxes that allow a Netroamer 
         or Programmer to interface with the Net, either in Program 
         Mode or in Cyberspace.  Decks are rated by their speed factor 
         and the number of chipdips they have, as well as how many 
         optional features they have.  A deck with a speed factor of 2 
         lets you do 2 actions per turn, while a speed factor of 4 
         allows _4_ actions.  The Net Profits Catalog lists several 
         types of Cyberdecks, from stripped-down cheapies to state-of- 
         the-art, fully-loaded, luxury models.

         PROGRAMS
              There are 12 basic kinds of grams, or programs, 
         available to the public.  Their cost depends on how reliable 
         they are and what they do.  Each one is contained on a little 
         chip.  These don't count against any limit on possessions; 
         you can have as many as you can get your hands on.
              Some programs, like Shtickgrams, reqire a die roll to 
         use.  The normal off-the-shelf chip has a skill of 6.  
         Programs that are created or stolen might have a higher die 
         roll, but no program can be better than 11.  The basic types 
         of programs are listed below.

         Worldgram
              These generate a specific world in cyberspace.  Without 
         a worldgram, cyberspace is different every time you enter it 
         and always very strange.  Worldgrams are usually pretty 
         cheap.

         Weapongrams
              You use these to fight your way into databases.  
         Weapongrams have no intelligence and must be actively used by 
         the Netroamer.  This means if your weapongram is a gun, you
         must use the Fire Gun skill to use it.  The price of 
         weapongrams depends on how much damage they do.

         Armorgrams
              These simulate armor, force fields or whatever 
         protection the worldgram allows.  These programs are also 
         unintelligent, but you don't need to concentrate on using 
         them.  Cost depends on how much protection you get.

         Shtickgrams
              Since your natural Shticks don't come with you into 
         cyberspace, you need these to replace them.  If you want, you 
         can buy Shtickgrams that are different from your normal 
         Shticks.  Basic Shtickgrams don't cost too much, but if you 
         want a better level than 6, you'll have to pay more for it.

         Boostergrams
              Your attributes and skills _do_ come with you into 
         cyberspace, but you can improve them.  A boostergram gives 
         you a plus on either a single skill or an attribute.  As you 
         probably guessed, boostergrams for one skill are much cheaper 
         than attribute boostergrams.  Of course, +1 also costs less 
         than +2.

         Bogglegrams
              Bogglegrams don't do actual damage, they just boggle 
         things.  They cost more if they do Maximum Boggling (see p. 
         00).  Bogglegrams are often found as defensive programs, 
         linked to Trapgrams.

         Creaturegrams
              This is the intelligent version of a weapongram.  Once 
         you tell them what to do, they will do it until they've 
         accomplished the goal or been destroyed.  Price is based on 
         the type of creature.

         Buddygram
              With a buddygram, you have a travelling companion that 
         can help you out by doing simple tasks.  Buddygrams aren't 
         very smart, but they can be very useful.  Buddygrams are 
         pretty expensive.

         Gadgetgrams
              You can't take gadgets into cyberspace, so these 
         programs do the job of simulating them.  You can buy a 
         gadgetgram to reproduce anything from a ping pong ball to a 
         starship.  Some gadgetgrams can be dozens of different 
         things, but they're generally all of the same type.  The more 
         complex the gadget, the more expensive the gadgetgram.  The 
         cost of gadgetgrams is up to the Animator.

         Trapgrams
              These programs are designed to do something to other 
         programs, databases, hardware or even someone using a deck.  
         Netroamers will usually encounter them as part of the 
         defenses when they attack a Megacorp system.
              An Identify Dangerous Thing roll will spot a Trapgram; a 
         Set/Remove Trap roll will let you get past it.  If you fail, 
         _something awful happens_.  It may call creaturegrams or live 
         Netroamers.  It may cost your cyberbody Hit Points (it can't 
         hurt your real body).It may throw you out of cyberspace.  It 
         may Boggle you or do something silly to you.  The worst ones 
         can Mindfry you or even Zero you Out.
              All Trapgrams are very expensive.  The worse the 
         results, the more costly they are.  An Animator who is 
         concerned with realism (what's that) will have only a few of 
         the really nasty trapgrams, and they'll be right at the heart 
         of the megacorp's defenses.
              They are often combined with one of the other types of 
         programs or even a _virus_.  A turn or two after the main 
         program activates, the Trapgram goes off.  Only a few 
         Trapgrams are legal.  All the rest are both illegal and 
         dangerous.

         Gigglegrams
              Gigglegrams cause all sorts of problems, but none of the 
         damage is really bad.  One example is a gigglegram that 
         causes a series of "knock knock jokes" to flash onscreen 
         during an important speech by a Corp executive.  Another 
         might have the machines that build car bodies make them in 
         the shape of bananas.  They would still work, but they'd look 
         really screwy.  It goes without saying that all gigglegrams 
         are _highly illegal!_  Despite this, they are fairly 
         inexpensive on the Street.

         Viruses
              A virus is a very special program designed to duplicate 
         itself inside a deck, database or program and then move 
         through the Net looking for others to infect.  A virus can 
         contain one or more other programs and can set them off in 
         any order the programmer wants.  Viruses are even more 
         illegal than gigglegrams and are a lot more expensive and 
         harder to find.
