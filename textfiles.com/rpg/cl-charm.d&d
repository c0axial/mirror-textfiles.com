Re: Charmer Kit & Spell

I had this real good concept for an Enchanter PC that I wanted to run
in 2nd ed AD&D which I would like to share with y'all.

Basically this is a PC who believes that everybody should be their
friend.  Of course what this person thinks what a friend should be
could be considered a master-slave relationship.

The role of this Enchanter is that of an adventurer who travels around
finding interesting or powerful NPCs so that she or he may 'collect'
them and add that NPC to her or his group of 'followers'.

This enchanter severely hates (but will never show it) anyone who can
resist her/his charms, magical or otherwise, or any other person who is
exactly like this enchanter.

This kit can work with:
  - any Mage, specificaly the Enchanter specialist, who enjoys using
    Charm Person extensivly for their own benefit,
  - any Specialty Priest who's god emphisises charm spells and/or
    grants the Charm/Facinate ability, or
  - any Psionicists who routinely use the Telepathic Devotions/Sciences
    like Domination.

The alignment of the charmer can be any non-Good, as taking possesion
of people just because the charmer thinks that its their right-by-
beauty/power/charisma/etc. is not commonly known as a nice thing to do.
The most workable PC alignments would be True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral,
and Lawful Evil.

Anyway, here it is:

NEW KIT (Charmer):
 + Bonus Nonweapon Proficiency: Ediquette.
 + Charmer gains the comliness characteristic, which is fully described
in the Unearthed Arcana, at base 14.  [ Or 1d8 + 10, whichever the
DM considers more fair ]
 - Any creature fighting for the Charmer gains (read: sucks) a full
share of the party's experience points.

For those of you without Unearthed Arcana, here is a paraphrase:

"Comeliness:  Comliness reflects physical attractiveness, social
grace and personal beauty of the character.  It is used to
determine initial reactions to the character, and characters with
a high comliness may affect the wills and actions of others.
While charisma deals specifically with leadership and
interactions between characters, comeliness deals with
attractiveness and first impressions."

[ I never really liked how this was used in 1st edition but I
thought that the higher point effects were particually well
suited for the Charmer kit since this is a person who
specifically works for it. ]

Charisma and race will affect comelines as follows:
  Charisma:    Comliness adj:      Race adjustments:     COM adj:
  less than 3       -8               Half-orcs:                -3
      3             -5               Dwarves, Gnomes:          -1
    4 or 5          -3               Halflings, Humans:         0
    6 to 8          -1               Half-elves, sylvan elves: +1
    9 to 12          0               Gray elves, high elves:   +2
   13 to 15         +1
   16 or 17         +2               The racial adjustment only
      18            +3            applies when the character is
  more than 18      +5            dealing with other races.

[ Charmer mages will routinely use the Friends spell to boost
their charisma so that comliness will also be enhanced. ]

Quick description of effects:  (Read UA for more detail)

14 to 17:  +3 on reaction rolls; opposite sex will be Facinated
(see below) unless target's wisdom is greater than or
equal to half of comliness score.
18 to 21:  +5 on reaction rolls; opposite sex will be Facinated
unless target's wisdom is greater than 2/3 of
comliness score; same sex will be Facinated unless
target's wisdom is greater than half of comliness
score.  Rejection by the charmer will make the target
react very negativly or hostile toward the charmer.
22 to 25:  +9 on reaction rolls; any person who's wisdom does not
equal or exceed 2/3 of their wisdom will be Facinated;
opposite sex targeted by the Charmer will be Facinated
unless wisdom is 18 or greater. Rejection is as above.

FACINATION:     If the intended target has failed the appropiate
wisdom check, he still gets a saving throw vs spell.
If he fails that, then he will be captivated by the
Charmer, and treat him or her as a trusted friend,
mentor, and companion.
                Facinated creatures will follow the orders of the
charmer, provided a roll of 3d6 [ I'd say a d20 would
be more appropiate ] does not exceed the comeliness of
the character.  Requests that are not in the best
interest of the creature get a +1 to the die, while
