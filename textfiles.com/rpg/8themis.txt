ok well all of you guys are part of a
guild...the guild is sort of like a
buissnes...it employs all of you to do
things the guild is hired to do...

news has spread across the planits of
an evil man named yazar...he is as
roomered to be a cult leader...his men
go to town and ships to take all of
the people from them and bring them
back to his planit to be burned in a
sacraficing ritual...

well the government of the planit
yes the entire planit of which you
live(the 'Anthe' government) hired the
guild to go out and kill yazar...

it has been discovered that yazar
doesn't really have followers but he
hires all of his men...so there plan is
that if he is killed his men will just
leave...

his men wear a purple suit with a seven
pointed star on the front...some poeple
also want him dead because of his taste
in clothes...

you have one night before the guild
ship will leave on its way to the
city yazar on the planit yazar...he is
also very conceated...

you also notice that about half the
guild members decline the mission
because of superstisious reasons...
about 40 men are left...

if any of you decided to go to the
weapons shop here are the prices of the
things there...
you have a couple of days to decide
what you want I am going out of town
for 3 days be back on mon.

equipment up except for the laser
pistol and vibro knife.  He has the
laser pistol connected to his 20 seu
powerpack.  He hides the weopons in his
skein suit just in case.  He will just
wander around and see if he can foind a
steam bath(dralasites are fond of them
ya know) and/or talk to people he
meets.

68807088735
     (Another stupid questionHas the
space ship left the ground yet) Well I
say we should go down there and take a
look.  I'll head up the group since I
still have all my weapons with me the
rest of you follow in whatever sort of
order comes handiest.  If the coridors
are wide enough we can try making two
of us head up the line.  Bubba and
whoever else put their weapons away get
out anything you might need and follow
the rest of us.

     Damn!  I wanted to get some chow
but I guess I'll go unlock my weopons
and prepare them for battle and follow
Doomer(whats your guys name) to kick
some ass!  And after the ass kicking I
will go to the restaurant for some
breakfast lunchwhatever and then see
about that steam bath.  I am side by
side with doomer so I can get 1st shot
at the scum.

will strap it on  my belt for now (powered OFF that is..) and the knife goes on
my belt too my 5 remaining credits will stay in my credit card (which happens
to be IN my wallet on me) (just in case I wander into a pay-toilet area) I'm
going to look for money or mabue steal something small from the cargo bay.. I
will be heading there..

ok well everone excluding
cronus(sp) runs out of the room...

well the few in front hear a yell and
well they as a natural reaction
decide to look behind them(where the
yell came from) and you see Timehopper
has been grabbed by a man dressed in a
purple suit and a large seven pionted
star on it...the man is holding
timehopper with a vibro knife to
his(timehoppers) neck...

oh and timehopper you do happen to
notice that you are being held buy a
man that has a knife to your neck and
has extreamly bad BO!!!

you also notice a man a little to the
left of timehopper with a auto mattic
pistol...he is yelling 'drop you guns
and follow us to ar' ship or we will
kill him(timehopper)'...

insidently all of you are about 15 feet
away fron them...this is excluding Krte
KD he is about 5 feet away...and
skecks because of his enormously slow
speed he is 9 feet away...

                     KP
