Subject: Vampires

Some time back I was going to alter the D and D system of races to
make each into a sort of "class" so that a character could advance
both in their profession and their race. This would open lots of
"monster" races up to player characters and allow for more diversity
among encountered beings. All of these races would start out on a low
power level before working up same as a class. A character ussing
one of these races would off set the bonus of having the races
abilities and powers have by a higher exp total to meet for each
level of advancement (exp. as with a Mulit-classed character would
be split evenly among the race and any classes. This would give
explination to a problem that I have with long lived races such as
elves advancing through the class level at the same speed as humans.
The only race that I ever did was the Vampire. I present it for any
who are intrested.
 
The Vampire:
Requirements:
Str 13, Int 10, and Cha 16
Characteristic Increase:
+1 Str per 2 weapons proficiencies gained after initial
+1 Dex per 5 levels if Wizard or Preist, per 4 levels if Warrior,
           per 3 levels if Rogue
+1 Int per 100 years of existance
+1 Wis per 250 years of existance
 
Hit Points:
1d8 per level to 8th and then +3 pts per level beyond. Con Bonus do
not apply to the Vampire's Hit Points. Nor does a Vampire gain a Con
Bonus when calculating the Hit Points of their other class(s).
 
Number of Attacks per Round:
1 for 1 or as per their other class with the option of bitting for 1d6.
 
Exp per Level:
Same as a Wizard (all exp must be halved between the Vampire class
and the character's other class)
Base Armor Class:
10 initialy -1 per 5 levels to a max base AC of 0.
 
Saving Throws:
As per the character's other class.
 
Weapons and Armor usable:
 
As per the character's other class.
 
Alignment:
Any Evil with NE as the rarest.
 
Abilities and Restrictions:
-To become a Vampire a System Shock check must be made or the
 character just dies. A similar check is made each time the
 Vampire is to advance a level. Failure of this roll causes the
 character to drop to half way above the last attained level.
-The Vampire has two forms a "normal" form and a Vamperic form.
 It takes one round to enter or emerge from the Vamperic form and
 it can only be done be done at night. In the
 following the asterisked powers and abilities can only be used
 in Vamperic form. When in Vamperic form that character casts
 no reflection and direct sunlight causes 3 pts. of damage per
 round.
-A Vampire must drink the blood of one human sized creature per
 per week per 2 levels of experience in the Vampire class with no
 more that one feeding necessary per night. If feedings are missed
 the Vampire begins to show its true age and corpse like visage.
 Further 3 hp are lost per feeding beyond the first that has been
 missed to a minimum of 1 hp. These are recovered instantly when
 next the Vampire feeds.
-When ever a Vampire sees blood there is a chance that he or she
 will enter into a blood lust and revert to Vampiric form against their
 will. (This can only happen durring the times when a character
 can make the change for the moment only at night.) A Vampire can
 resist the change with a Con/- roll (modified -3 per missed feeding,
 +? for recent feeding DMO) Bloodlust forces the Vampire into a feeding
 frenzy when it must feed. Durring a Bloodlust the Vampire acts as
 though it were one level higher as a vampire in all reguards. To get
 out of a Bloodlust the Vampire must roll Con and Int check, or come
 out of it naturaly after gorging itself on the blood of 1d4 + 1
 human sized beings. (The Vampire will go after any one around to get
 this blood.) Vampires need no other sustinance than blood though
 they can eat "normal" food if they wish.
-Direct light causes a Vampire sever pain and minuses to hit while in
 either form:
 Sunlight causes -4 to hit, Lamplight -3, Torch or Candle light -1
 
-A Vampire must be invited to cross the thresh-hold of the race which
 it used to be. A human Vampire would need to be invited into the
 a human home. If the Vampire is not invited in he or she will be power
 -less to harm those under that roof.
 
-Vampirers do not like running water and will avoid it if at all
 possible, full immersion causes 1 Hp per level reguardless of what
 form the Vampire is in.
 
-The great enemy of the Vampire is fire which does +1 pt of damage
 per die to them. Further their save vs. any sort of fire is at -3.
 A Vampire if he or she regenerates will regain Hp lost to fire at
 half normal rate.
 
-A vampire may be killed with a stake through the heart but with its
 removal the Vampire can again return to plague the living if it is
 regenerating. (see below) It is DMO on permanent destroyers of Vampires.
 
-Animals sencing the aura of death about the Vampire will react badly
 when in their pressence.
