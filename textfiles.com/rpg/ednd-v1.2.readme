           EDND - Version 1.2 - Readme File - August 19, 1993
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

      EDND, or Enhanced Dungeons & Dragons, is the name I have given to
my collection of house rules for the AD&D 2nd Edition game (TM, (C), and
whatever).
      They include sections on rolling ability scores, character races,
character classes, the proficiency system (which is linked to the 
new hit die system), equipment, magic& spells, and combat.
      Appendix A details (9 pages) the Commander, a new character class
I have made; Appendix B gives the info on the use of Life Energy Levels
in my campaign (undead shouldn't drain experience levels IMHO).

      The EDND rules are available both in ASCII format, and as a 
postscript file for those who like nice tables with gray-shading and the
like. Both files have been compressed with PKZIP 2.04 on a PC. Unzipped,
ednd-v1.2.txt (the ASCII file) is 90k, while ednd-v1.2.ps (the postscript
file) fills 427k (and 21 pages).

      These rules will also be included in the Complete.Net.Handbook, and
the Commander character class will appear in a traditional AD&D (so not
EDND; i.e. with races allowed and level limits) format in the TOME of
Vast Knowledge.

      If you have remarks, suggestions or criticisms (flames will be frozen
for later use), then mail me at: ezra%users%lw@cc3.kuleuven.ac.be

      Enjoy,
