
                           THE NINJA CLASS
         Ninja  are a highly specialized breed of individual who 
   are taught the arts of fighting nearly from the day they  are 
   born.   Each  Ninja has undergone EXTREME rigorous  training.  
   This  training requires equal if not greater discipline  than 
   that  required  to learn the skills of the monk.   Ninja  are 
   taught to do one thing,  to kill,  and to do it  stealthfully 
   with  such quickness that legends describe their abilities as 
   magic.
         To  become a Ninja a character must have at least a  15 
   in strength, dexterity, and constitution.  The character must 
   also possess at least a 14 in intelligence and wisdom.
         ALL   Ninja  are  absolutely  neutral   in   alignment.  
   Variation   from  this  neutrality  would  be  a  breech   of 
   discipline and a threat to clan honor.
         Many  Ninja  skills are similar to that of  monks,  and 
   like monks Ninja are skilled in open-hand combat.   Any open-
   handed  strike  struck by the Ninja 5 better  than  what  was 
   required  'to  hit'  has a percentage equal  to  the  Ninja's 
   assassination chance to stun that creature for 1-6 rounds.
          Though  skilled  in unarmed combat,  Ninja mastery  of 
   this technique is not equal to that of monks.
         Ninja  mastery is centered on defensive  and  offensive 
   weapon combat.  Ninja have developed the skill of dodging and 
   parrying  attacks  to a level far beyond other  classes.   In 
   combat  a Ninja may completely avoid damage from a blow  that 
   would have struck damage.   Ninja can avoid one such blow for 
   every  three  levels  of  experience  he/she  possesses.   To 
   prevent damage from a blow,  the Ninja must make a successful 
   save to parry at his/her level (See Ninja ability chart).   A 
   successful  save indicates no damage was taken from the blow.  
   (Note:  Magical  save,  dexterity,  or any other  adjustments 
   except  those  listed  below effect the  parry  roll.)   This 
   attempt  to  avoid  damage can be made  in  addition  to  the 
   ninja's  regular  attacks.   If the ninja chooses to make  NO 
   attacks for the round and do nothing but parry then then  the 
   ninja  will  get both strength,  dexterity,  and weapon  plus 
   bonuses  to  the  parry roll.   (The  bonus  for  specialized 
   weapons is also included),  if a shield is employed then  the 
   +2 bonus plus any its bonuses are also included.   This means 
   generally  that an inoffensive ninja is almost impossible  to 
   hit.   Of  course  no actions or extra movement  are  allowed 
   during such a parrying phase.   
         Like monks,  Ninja can dodge missiles cast at them.   A 
   successful  save versus paralyzation is required to  dodge  a 
   missile, and if the save is made, no damage is taken.  If the 
   Ninja  is  in  possession of a shield,  +2 is  added  to  the 
   Ninja's saving throw to dodge the missile.   If the shield is 
   magic,  and  additional  +1 is added to the Ninja's save  for 
   each of the shield's pluses.   Unlike monks,  Ninja can  only 
   dodge  one  missile per round for each of his/her  levels  of 
   experience.   If  the  Ninja  possesses  a  shield,  2  extra 
   missiles may be blocked per round.
         Ninja  can dodge certain spell effects like monks on  a 
   successful  save  versus paralyzation.   These  effects  are: 
   Flame  strike,  blade  barrier,  trip,  ray of  enfeeblement, 
   lightning  bolt,  cone of cold (at closer than 30Ft range  to 
   caster),  otilukes freezing sphere.  Ninja can also dodge the 
   spell  like  effects of certain items as  follows:  The  ball 
   lightning  and shooting stars effects of a ring  of  shooting 
   stars,  the  ray  of a wand  of  negation,  paralyzation,  or 
   polymorphing,  and  any  effects not listed which apply to  a 
   narrow  area of effect no more than 5 feet to either side  of 
   the Ninja.
         Ninja  combat  effectiveness is  nearly  without  peer, 
   Ninja fight off the fighters chart and save as clerics.   For 
   every level of the Ninja,  he/she inflicts and extra one-half 
   point of damage with the weapons he/she uses.   When fighting 
   with  a  weapon,  any blow struck by the Ninja 5 better  than 
   required  'to  hit',  has  percentage equal  to  the  Ninja's 
   assassination chance of inflicting double normal damage.   On 
   a  hit  of  natural  20,  the Ninja  has  a  chance  off  the 
   assassination chart to instantly kill.
         Ninja  completely  shun the use of armor unless  it  is 
   used  in a disguise they are wearing.   Ninja will NEVER wear 
   any  armor heavier than chainmail.   The shield is  the  only 
   armor  a  Ninja will utilize outside of  a  disguise.   Ninja 
   depend on their speed,  parrying ability, and natural agility 
   to  serve  as  their armor.   Ninja unlike  monks  get  their 
   dexterity bonus to their armor class.   All undisguised Ninja 
   are armor class 10 not including their dexterity bonus.  This 
   may  be  lowered  to 9 or below by a shield  or  any  magical 
   analogue,  such  as a ring or bracers.   Ninja will not  wear 
   cloaks because it impairs their movements.
         Ninja  are proficient in two weapons at first level and 
   thereafter   become  proficient  in  one  new   weapon   each 
   succeeding   level.     Ninja   who   specialize   (use   two 
   proficiencies on one weapon) get increased attacks and combat 
   damage  (see Ninja ability table),  specialized weapons  give 
   the Ninja +2 'to hit' and damage with that weapon in addition 
   to  any  other  bonuses  the  Ninja  may  have.    Ninja  may 
   specialize in only up to three weapons.  Ninja may NOT double 
   speacialize.
         Ninja may disguise themselves as well as assassins, and 
   Ninja's  of  the  sixth level and better  can  change  simple 
   disguises in a matter of only 3 segments.
         Ninja  perform  as a thief one level below  their  own, 
   except  for moving silently and hiding in shadows which  they 
   perform  at two levels ABOVE their own.   Ninja back-stabbing 
   ability is equal to that of thieves.
         Ninja, though they only recieve a d4 for hitpoints, are 
   entitled to the hit-point bonus restricted to fighters.
         Ninja  do not use oil in combat,  as it is a  dangerous 
   item to carry, and to bulky when carried properly.
         Ninja  possess a silent language spoken by Genin  level 
   Ninja  and  above,  different sects of  Ninja  had  differing 
   versions  of  this 'tongue'.   Ninja are also  conversant  in 
   thieves Cant, though it is one rare occasion they utilize it.
         Ninja  can  use any magic item that is UNRESTRICTED  to 
   other  classes,  and  those  items  usable  by  fighters  and 
   thieves.   Ninja though they do not shun magic,  feel it is a 
   weakness to depend on magicks.   They therefore utilize items 
   of  this nature only rarely.   Ninja  however,  highly  prize 
   magic  weaponry,  and such is highly sought after,  these and 
   magic shields are the only FAVORED magicks.
         Ninja are limited in magicks as followed.  No Ninja may 
   possess more than three magic weapons,  excess will be  given 
   to the Ninja's Jonin for distribution to worthies.  One magic 
   shield,  and  no  more  than  4  miscellaneous  magic  items.  
   Protection  items worn by ninja only give half their bonus to 
   armor  class  (round up) this only applies to  A.C.  but  not 
   saving throws which remain uneffected.
                     SPECIAL COMBAT SITUATIONS
                     ------------------------- 
         It  is inevitable that Ninja and Monks will meet sooner 
   or later.  The clash of their aspects will almost always come 
   to a combat situation.
         The  combat style of the Ninja is known to monks as  it 
   is to other Ninja and this system is provided to relieve  the 
   tension and apparent superiority of Ninja to monks.
         In a direct confrontation in open-hand combat, or armed 
   combat  a  Ninja's  ability to parry blows is changed  to  an 
   armor  class.   Subtract the Ninja's save to parry  from  20.  
   Take the result and subtract it from 10,  this is the Ninja's 
   armor  class (to the Monk only!) in a mixed combat  situation 
   the Ninja will retain the ability to parry the blows of OTHER 
   characters besides the monk.   For the determination of armor 
   class  versus the monk,  DO NOT add in the Ninja's  dexterity 
   bonus.   (Example:  A 10th level Chunin is about to do combat 
   with a monk.  His save to parry is 11.  Subtract this from 20 
   and  the  result  is 9.   Subtract 9 from 10 and you  get  1.  
   Armor  class  1 is about the same armor class as  an  uprated 
   monk of the same level.)
         In weapon combat the Ninja WILL NOT add one-half  point 
   of damage per level against the monk.  The monks knowledge of 
   this   style   of   fighting  will   negate   this   ability.  
   Consequently,  the  monks  weapon  damage  bonuses  are  also 
   negated by the Ninja's familiarity with the combat style.
         If the Ninja utilizes a shield in combat, his/her armor 
   class  will  be bettered only by 2 regardless of the plus  of 
   the  shield.    His/her  saves  to  dodge  missiles  will  be 
   uneffected however.
         The resulting combat will now be more even.   The Ninja 
   having a hit point and possibly hit point  superiority.   The 
   monk having damage inflicting superiority.

  ----------------------    -----      -----------    -----------


                    NINJA ABILITY EXPLANATIONS
   A)    At first level Ninja are able to do a standing vertical 
   leap  of  50%  of their height,  +5% for  every  level  above 
   second.  (A six foot Ninja could jump 3 feet [50%] vertically 
   at  first  level with NO running start.)  A Ninja  can  do  a 
   running  vertical  leap EQUAL to their own  height,  +5%  per 
   level above second.
         Ninja  can  do  a standing long jump equal to  125%  of 
   their height,  +5% at second,  and +10% for every level above 
   5th.  Ninja can do a running long jump equal to 300% of their 
   height, +20% for every level above second.
   B)     At second level,  Ninja gain the ability of  VIBRATION 
   DETECTION,  this  ability  is similar to thieves  hear  noise 
   ability.   Base  chance of success at second level is 25%  to 
   detect moving bodies or object within a 60 foot range indoors 
   or up to 100 yards outdoors.   This ability increases 3%  for 
   each level above second.
         Also at second level the Ninja is only surprised 16% of 
   the  time.   For every other level above second the chance to 
   surprise the Ninja goes down by 1%.
   C)     At third level the Ninja gains the ability to  concoct 
   poisons.   The  Ninja  learns to make one poison  of  his/her 
   choice  at third level and thereafter learns to make one  new 
   poison  at odd numbered succeeding  level.   Typical  poisons 
   will  take from 2-8 hours to concoct,  provided the materials 
   are  on hand.   Deadly poisons will usually require rare  and 
   hard to find ingredients.
   D)     At fourth level the Ninja gains the ability  to  blend 
   into the landscape.   For this ability to work the Ninja must 
   be in a natural surrounding or near cover of some kind.   The 
   Ninja needs one turn to prepare and then he/she may hide with 
   an 85% chance to be undetected, even in broad daylight.  This 
   ability increases 5% for every level above 9th.  This ability 
   generally  uses  dirt,  shrubbs,  rocks,  ect.  to cover  the 
   Ninja's  presence.   This  ability  was  primarily  used  for 
   ambushes.
         The  fourth level Ninja can fall up to 20 feet  without 
   taking  damage  if he/she is within 1 foot of  a  substantial 
   substance from which they can slow their decent.
   E)     The ability to draw a weapon and strike in one  motion 
   is  gained at fifth level.   Ninja who are NOT surprised  may 
   initially draw AND strike with a weapon in the first  segment 
   of combat.   Ninja may change weapons during the attack phase 
   of combat within 1 segment.
   F)    Charm and Fear spells have on a 40% chance of effecting 
   a  sixth level Ninja.   At each level above 6th the chance is 
   reduced by 3%.
         A sixth level the Ninja can fall upto 30' if he/she  is 
   within 4 feet of a surface.
   G)     At seventh level the Ninja gains the ability to detect 
   life within a creatures body,  even the slightest traces will 
   be noted by the Ninja's keen senses.   This ability can  only 
   be practiced at ranges of 1 foot or less.
   H)     At  eighth level a Ninja gains a mind masking  ability 
   similar  to that of  monks.   E.S.P.,  empathy,  and  related 
   mental  effects  have only a 50% chance of affecting  an  8th 
   level Ninja.   The chance of effecting the Ninja goes down 5% 
   for every level beyond 8th.
   I)     Missile assassination ability is gained at 9th  level.  
   The  Ninja  gains  the  ability to make  a  back-stabbing  or 
   assassination  attempt  with  any missile  weapon  he/she  is 
   specialized with.   To assassinate,  the Ninja must  surprise 
   the victim,  all missile assassination attempts are made at a 
   -25%  penalty to the Ninja's assassination roll.   To make  a 
   backstabbing   attempt,   the   ninja  must  make  a   normal 
   assassination roll to inflict the damage multiplier  elsewise 
   the damage is normal.
   J)     At tenth level,  Ninja become immune to haste and slow 
   spells as do monks.
   K)     At eleventh level Ninja cannot be Geased  or  Quested.  
   Ninja of this level can pass without trace and move at normal 
   speed  through  overgrown areas as if he/she were a druid  of 
   seventh level ability.
   L)     The  ability  to recognize toxins is  gained  at  12th 
   level.   A  12th  level  Ninja  has a   base  75%  chance  to 
   correctly  identify a toxin,  this ability increases  5%  for 
   every  level  beyond 12th.   Ninja of 12th level  can  create 
   poison  anti-dotes for any poison they RECOGNIZE.   The anti-
   dotes  effectiveness  is  equal  to  the  Ninja's  chance  to 
   identify the toxin.  Anti-dotes will take 3-12 rounds to make 
   with all the proper materials at hand.
   M)     At 13th level Ninja can attack more  effectively  with 
   his/her specialized weapon.   A strike with this weapon doing 
   more  than 50% of an opponents emaining  itpoints has a base 
   50% chance to STUN, or incapacitate that opponent.  For every 
   level  of the victim above the Ninja the chance is  decreased 
   by  5%,  the  chance is increased by 5% for every  level  the 
   Ninja has above the victim's.
         At  13th level a Ninja can fall any distance if  he/she 
   is within 8 feet of a surface.
   N)    At 14th level the Ninja gains the ability to open locks 
   and free bars in absolute silence.   This ability also allows 
   the  14th  level Ninja to open locks in 50% of  the  time  it 
   takes  a  normal thief.   At 15th level the time required  is 
   40%,  at  16th level it is 30%,  and at 17th level the  Ninja 
   need  take only 20% of the normally required time to  open  a 
   lock or free a bar.  It is rumored that 17th level Ninja need 
   no tools to open locks.  The ability to quickly open locks is 
   an extension of the Ninja's sensitivity to vibrations.
   O)     At  15th  level the Ninja becomes semi-immune  to  all 
   poisons including gases,  ingested,  or otherwise  insinuated 
   into  the body,  acting as a slow poison at half the  ninja's 
   level  (round up).   This gives the ninja time to complete  a 
   task and then seek out medical aid before dying.   This is an 
   extension of the Ninja's ability to control his/her body.
   P)     At  16th level of ability the Ninja leaves  no  trace.  
   Ninja  of the 16th and 17th level of ability move so  swiftly 
   and  lightly  that  they leave no discernable  trail  on  ANY 
   surface.  It is said the Ninja of the 16th and 17th level can 
   walk on water and cross bogs without being  hindered.   Treat 
   this  as body equilibrium (the psionic ability).   The  Ninja 
   can  practice this for up to 1 hour per day ( For purposes of 
   walking on water an such). 
   Q)    Master Jonin can recieve a mortal blow and by force  of 
   will  continue to remain conscious and function as if  he/she 
   still  retained 1 hitpoint.   If the blow does not take  them 
   more  points negative than they possessed at first level then 
   he/she may continue to function for up to 1 turn for every  4 
   constitution points he/she has.  (Example: A master Jonin who 
   had 15 points at first level could survive being knocked down 
   to -15 hitpoints and still remain conscious.)  The Ninja must 
   immediately  seek medical attention because if at the end  of 
   his/her  conscious  time  the Ninja has not  been  healed  to 
   positive hitpoints he/she will lapse into unconsciousness and 
   thereafter  be  treated  as any other  character  brought  to 
   negative  hitpoints.   Even  if a Ninja survives  an  ordeal, 
   he/she must spend a weeks time in uninterrupted meditation to 
   restore the lost vital energies.
