combat system largely left unrevised since the "Advanced" was tagged to
the "Dungeons & Dragons."  Combat II is not a new game: existing
modules, monsters, character kits, etc. can be easily updated to C2
rules.

              CHANGING THE SYSTEM: An Argument
________________________________________________________________

>From the First Edition rules on, a round has always contained three
major components which cannot easily be reconciled on the same time
scale:  physical attacks, with Speed Factor (SF ); spellcasting, with
Casting Time (CT); and movement, with movement bases and current speed
(I'll use the abbreviation MV).  The question of who begins and ends an
action first could be answered easily when comparing similar actions (a
CT 3 spell goes off before a CT 4, etc.) but not when dissimilar types
of actions compete.
     How long is the time interval between CT 9 and one full round?  In
the mist-shrouded First Edition rules, the Casting Times were in
SEGMENTS (6 seconds each,  10 per round), so a CT of 9 is one segment
shy of a full round.  The present rules eliminate segments, keeping the
round as the sole (lengthy) unit of time measurement for a combat.  The
PLAYERS HANDBOOK now states that when no label is given next to the
casting time, it represents the number added to a combatant's
initiative roll, thereby keeping weapons and spells on the same
relative time scale.  However, despite SF's and other initiative
modifiers which can exceed 10, the 2nd ed. PH never give a CT above 9,
except for those measured in rounds or turns, suggesting that a CT of
10 would in fact take a full round.  Segments work fine for Casting
Time, but weapon speeds cannot possibly be measured in 6-second
intervals--how could multiple attacks or fire rates above 1/round occur
for weapons with SF greater than 5?  By this logic, Speed Factor and
Casting Time are incompatible scales: almost all weapons SHOULD strike
faster than most spells, particularly spells requiring close to the
entire melee round to cast.
     As the 1st ed. rules had it,  a weapon  makes continual
combinations of attack/ parry/ recover, but only one of its attack
motions has a chance to pierce the opponent's defenses.  What other
explanation applies to an experienced swordsman who could conceivably
make a slash or thrust almost every SECOND of a melee round?  Casting a
spell, on the other hand, requires intense concentration, and typically
also calls for precise vocal inflections and body gestures.  We already
know that any physical or magical hit against the caster automatically
foils the attempted spell once begun.  Watch any Kurasawa samurai film,
then ask yourself what a swordsman is assumed to be doing against a
stationary spellcaster who cannot break concentration long enough to
dodge a single blow.  How many seconds does it take to cast a CT 9
spell?  More than is healthy.
     The initiative system suggested in the Player's Handbook adds an
appealing, but problematic, random element to the issue of who does
what and when, representing how either individuals or entire groups can
determine and execute their actions a bit more quickly than their
opponents.  The combatant with the lowest d10 roll (with adjustments)
attacks first, then the next lowest, etc., cycling back to the lowest
again if any attacks per round remain.  This  begs the question of just
how long a melee round should continue--for a finite period of time or
until all combatants get a chance to do everything the rules tell them
they can?  Also, the d10 becomes more of a regulator of who goes first
that is the strategic choice of spells or fast weapons.
     The present rules further assume all actions for the round are
declared up front (no significant change of plans allowed) and all
opponents are already within striking distance.  What happens when an
orc with a short sword (SF 3) needs to close 40' in order to hack a
Longbowman (SF 8) who is already targeting the orc?  What if a mage
must wait for allies to clear an area before evoking a FIREBALL?
Finally, what can combatants who attack quickly do while waiting for
the round to end, beside stand still and defend?
     Under present 2nd ed. rules, movement is scarcely addressed.   A
warrior may move up to his full allowance in a round, but only if she
foregoes all attacks.  On the other hand, an archer may move up to half
his allowance and still fire one arrow (p. 96).   What if the warrior
need only run half her movement allowance in order to engage in melee?
If she is normally allowed two attacks, must she lose both?  Outside of
game constraints, she'd be slashing away the moment she closed.
     It's time these considerations were accounted for properly under
combat rules.  The old system did serve the purpose of keeping things
simple, but it also forced the DM to make continual judgment calls
concerning how much combatants could get away with in a round.  What
follows below is a system designed to combine a greater "realism" in a
combat by reconciling the timescale discrepancies as much as possible,
but without compromising smooth, rapid playability.  The impact on the
combat round will be immediate and far-reaching, creating a dynamic
combat environment, placing a premium on battle tactics over lucky
dice.

                            SECTION 1:
       A PHASE-BASED ROUND: INTRODUCTION TO PHASE SYSTEM I
________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________


     A PHASE-BASED INITIATIVE SYSTEM:  This system, and its variant
Phase System II, assumes the use of miniatures for marking combatants'
positions.  It also assumes that the playing group seriously considers
issues such as weapon or casting speeds in a round, rather than using a
simple unmodified group initiative roll, which is faster, but less
realistic and dynamic.
     A Phase System I round has a real-time beginning, middle, and end,
though much can happen within it.  The round is divided into several
discrete opportunities for movement, melee and spell casting: the
combat PHASES.   Each phase permits a SLIGHT speed advantage to the
side winning initiative for the round (the "winner" column vs. the
"loser").  As you can see from Table 1, the phases are subdivided into
HALF-SEGMENTS, a series of brief increments which  helps distinguish
slow attacks from fast ones.  Casting Time SEGMENTS alternate between
active and inactive half-segments depending on the caster's "winner" or
"loser" initiative status: one caster can get the drop on the other
even if their spells have the same CT, but a lower CT would
automatically discharge faster.
     While the group of four phases allows several opportunities for
casting, movement, and physical attacks, it is also unforgiving for
missed or delayed action.  As table 1 illustrates, in each phase of the
first three phases a combatant may do ONE of the following:
      --move up to 1/3 MV (may accelerate/decelerate first)
      --make one attack (one per phase up to normal number of
           attacks per round)
      --begin to cast a spell, or continue casting one from a
           previous phase.  Only one spell may be completed each
           round.
      --perform a brief miscellaneous action such as re-string a
           bow or gather material components.
Therefore a combatant with one attack per round has three opportunities
to make her attack before the round ends, but may still perform other
actions in the remaining phases, including movement.  A combatant with
multiple attack routines may use whichever combination of eligible
phases best suits his purposes, combining attack phases with movement
phases, up one attack per phase.  To return to the earlier example of
the archer and the orc, if an orc must move into position , he has to
wait until the next phase to actually swing an axe, while a stationary
archer 40 feet away could wreck the monster's whole day before it takes
a step.  Along the same lines, a fighter with multiple attacks per
round will still only have one attack opportunity during the round if
he needs to spend the first two phases closing with the opponent
instead of attacking.
     Built on the assumption that casting time is measured in portions
of a round (i.e. 6-second segments) and weapon speeds are relative, the
phase system gives a distinct advantage to both natural and fabricated
weapons over spells with long casting times, effectively reducing the
SF time for any physical attack to approximately three segments of CT
or less.  A caster choosing a 1-3 CT spell is therefore still
formidable even in the midst of battle.

________________________________________________________________
BASIC PROCEDURE OVERVIEW:
------------------------

A.  GROUP ROLL FOR INITIATIVE: Each group of characters rolls a d10,
    with the lowest roll winning initiative.
B.  INDIVIDUAL MODIFIERS: Each individual modifies group roll by
    Reaction Adjustment for DEXTERITY.  A high dexterity may put a
    "loser" onto the winner's track, while a low DEX may do the
    opposite.  "Winners" receive no further bonus, nor "losers" further
    penalties.
C:  PHASE 1 BEGINS: STATE INTENTIONS.  Starting with initiative losers,
    each combatant must state if they intend to move, attack or cast,
    or engage in some miscellaneous activity.  Winners may take this
    into consideration when stating their own intentions.
D:  DM BEGINS COUNTING HALF-SEGMENTS.  All actions listed across row
    are simultaneous.
E:  CASTING/PHYSICAL ATTACKS: Read each half-segment row as the order
    of events for both initiative winners and losers.  All actions on
    the same row are simultaneous and cannot preempt the completion of
    actions by other combatants that half-segment.
F:  MOVEMENT/ MISCELLANEOUS ACTION.  Simultaneous, but resolve any
    conflicts by allowing initiative winners a slight advantage.  See
    below for specifics of how movement is resolved.
G:  REPEAT FOR PHASES 2 AND 3.
H:  PHASE 4 (ENDPHASE):  No movement.  Complete all 1 round spells.
I.  NEW ROUND BEGINS.



________________________________________________________________

BASIC PROCEDURE EXPLAINED:
-------------------------

A. GROUP ROLL FOR INITIATIVE: Roll for each significant
   group.  This system assumes a party generally fights as a
   group and moves roughly as a unit.  From a DM's perspective,
   this is an attractive alternative to rolling separately for
   massive numbers of forces.  If a party is separated on the
   battlefield by a significant distance, each subgroup may roll
   separately.  In the case of a multi-sided attack, low roll is
   the initiative winner, all others are losers.
B. INDIVIDUAL MODIFIERS: The rationale behind allowing
   individual modifiers is simple.  Some combatants are not
   affected by the confusion or hesitation of a group, others are
   slower in getting started than a fast acting group.
C: BEGIN PHASE.  STATE INTENTIONS.  In each phase, a combatant
   may do one of the following: begin a spell and/or finish a
   spell with less than 4 remaining CT units (assuming it was
   initiated earlier in the round), OR make one attack routine OR
   move up to 1/3 MV.  Initiative loser state intentions first,
   allowing winners that split second chance to second guess
   their opponents and react accordingly.
       IMPORTANT: Each combatant planning to cast or attack must
       declare a target.   The figures for combatants planning to
       move should be oriented prior to attack rolls.
D: DM BEGINS COUNTING HALF-SEGMENTS:  Both the DM and each of the
   players should have a copy of table 1 so they can readily
   follow the ongoing sequence and their characters' places in
   it.  All actions read across the row are simultaneous.  Speed
   factors are grouped in small ranges both to speed up the
   sequence of attacks and to simulate the simple truth that few
   kills are instantaneous (a slightly slower weapon might still
   connect before the wielder dies).
E: CASTING/PHYSICAL ATTACKS: The initiative losers declare
   whether or not they will begin a spell and also which
   opponents will be targeted for physical attacks.  After they
   do so, the winner does likewise, adjusting to the loser's
   plans as necessary.  As the DM begins to count off each half
   segment, casting begins and weapons make their respective
   wind-ups, with a slight speed advantage given to the
   initiative winners (refer to the winner/loser columns of table
   1).  Initiative therefore becomes the ability to anticipate
   the opponent, and to get a small but important lead in
   actions, but not to gain the sudden ability to perform time-
   consuming feats while the opponent stands and gawks.  Killing
   an opponent on a half-segment prior to the opponent's attack
   preempts the attack.

      CALCULATING SPEED FACTOR: As per the Fighter's Manual and
      the Player's Handbook, Adjusted Speed Factor is based on
      the following formula:
         (Base SF - Magic bonus - Style specialization)

      NATURAL ATTACKS: Look at table 2 for natural attack Speed
      Factors based on size (these numbers are a modification of
      initiative modifiers for size found in the Player's
      Handbook, p. 94). These adjustments speed up the monsters
      somewhat for natural attacks, but penalize them
      appropriately for their ponderous size when using weapons.
      If the monster uses a weapon apart from its natural attack,
      always use the weapon SF instead, modified by the new size
      adjustment for weapons.  I recommend these size adjustments
      affect PC's as well when they use weapons while ENLARGED or
      DIMINISHED.

               Table 2: Speed Factor Based on Size
          SIZE     SF FOR NAT. ATT     SF ADJ. FOR WEAPON
          Tiny               0               -1
          Small              2               -1
          Medium             3                0
          Large              6               +1
          Huge               8               +2
          Gargantuan        10               +4

      Speed Factor Modifiers: Table 55 of the PH may be directly
      translated to speed factor modifiers (p.94).

      SIMULTANEOUS ACTIONS: All actions taking place on the same half-
      segment are considered simultaneous--dying or other forms of
      incapacitation occur AFTER actions are performed.  Declared
      targets may not be changed once the moment of impact has arrived,
      though the action may be canceled; however, a checked swing or a
      voluntarily interruption of a spell still constitutes an attack
      or the casting for the round.  All "to hit" rolls for attacks
      against a particular target should precede damage calculation
      (see Overkill rule below).
F. MOVEMENT: After attacks and spells have been resolved, all movement
   is conducted for those who did not otherwise engage.  In a phase,
   each combatant may move up to 1/3 his current MV (a walking knight
   with a 12 MV can move 4 per phase).  All movement is, for the most
   part, simultaneous, but if two or more combatants are attempting to
   race towards the same goal at the same speed, a slight advantage
   should go to the initiative winner.
G. REPEAT FOR PHASES 2 AND 3:  The casting of long spells continues
   according to the CURRENT phase's winner/loser track (beginning a
   spell on the winner track does not guarantee casting it as a
   winner).  Note the second, third and fourth columns of CT times
   within the CT tracks.  If the spell is begun during the second
   phase, its maximum CT cannot exceed 6, or 3 for the third phase.
   The caster needs to plan accordingly.
H. PHASE 4 (ENDPHASE): 1 round spells are finished at this time.  Units
   are assumed already to be in final position for the round--no
   movement or physical attacks are permitted.

Under the four phase round, combatants with multiple attacks per round
have three distinct chances to take their best shots, but movement
constraints may not allow them to do so.  Furthermore, the advantage
given to the initiative winner is not an unfair one: a blindingly fast
weapon in the hands of an initiative loser is still faster than an
ungainly one wielded by the winner, but both are quicker than a CT of 4
or more--if a mage wants to cast long spells unmolested, he'd better
get behind the grunts.

                           SECTION 2
                         ADVANCED RULES
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Now let's look at the system refined further with a few special
considerations.

A.  SPELLCASTING
----------------
Only one successful casting per round is possible due to the necessary
time spent regaining concentration and allowing residual energy to
dissipate.   If a caster physically attacks an opponent, he cannot cast
in the same round and vice-versa unless the spell requires a melee
attack (see Touch Spell rule below).  Material components must be in-
hand at the beginning of a casting phase, or else one phase must be
spent readying them.

REPOSITIONING MOVEMENT:  At the start of the phase prior to beginning a
spell, the caster may move a step or two (max. 10') but must then add 1
to CT.

TOUCH SPELLS: The actual touch may be attempted during the attack
portion of the next phase or later.  If the touch attack occurs in a
subsequent round, however, it counts as the attack for the round (i.e.
no casting, no further attacks unless normally allowed more than one
physical attack).

MOVEMENT AND SPELLCASTING:  A caster MAY shift position slightly (up to
10') while casting if the spell has no somatic component, but receives
no dexterity bonus towards AC during casting (he is NOT considered a
stationary target, though).  If the spell requires no somatic
component, If the spell is designated to go off during the half-
segments corresponding to movement, the caster may not move at all that
phase if the spell has a somatic component.  Initiative winners may
elect to release a spell before, after, or at midpoint of the loser's
movement.  Losers automatically cast their spells at the end of all
movement.  Winners casting spells at other winners do so at midpoint of
winner's movement.

CASTER TAKES DAMAGE: If a spell is being cast during the current phase,
the spell is ruined if the caster takes damage.  The caster may then
defend and move for the remainder of the round but may not begin a new
spell.  If the caster is hit PRIOR to the phase in which he will begin
a spell, the casting phase is not forfeited, but will be delayed one
extra phase if the caster fails a CON check.

HOLDING A SPELL:  This is a rule option popular in my playing circle.
A caster may choose to temporarily contain the mystical energies of a
cast spell, effectively increasing the CT by one or more before
releasing the magic, perhaps allowing allies to clear the area or
opponents to enter it.  The maximum hold time is 6 CT (roughly 2
phases) which may increase the effective casting time to over 10, which
puts the balance into the next round.  If the caster takes a hit while
holding a spell, the spell is still ruined.  If the spell is held into
the next round, it counts as that round's casting (no new spell may be
started).  The caster may move freely while holding a spell.


________________________________________________________________

B. PSIONICS
-----------
Consider psionic actions as spellcasting with a CT of 1 unless
otherwise specified.  Some psionic abilities enhance physical blows and
should allow subsequent physical attacks in later phases.  Others
preclude physical engagement in the fashion of magic use.  SPECIAL
OPTION: Tangents may be established at one per phase (our group allows
up to 3 per round instead of the normal two to allow the psionicist to
take advantage of contact next round).


________________________________________________________________

C. PHYSICAL ATTACKS ( MELEE AND MISSILE FIRE)
---------------------------------------------
REPOSITIONING MOVEMENT:  Before a physical attack the combatant may
take a step or two (max. 10') but must then add 2 to his SF for that
phase.

RETARGETTING: If an intended target falls in melee during a half
segment PRIOR to the attacker's hit attempt (someone else took it out
first), the attack attempt may be delayed until a later phase, or a new
target WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE may be declared in the same phase with
a +3 SF penalty to the attack.

OVERKILL: Few battlefield kills are instantaneous, let alone instantly
verifiable.  If several allies are hammering away on the same opponent,
an extra blow or two might fall before they realize that the opponent
is dead.  Therefore, targets may not be re-declared during the half
segment the attacker's hit attempt actually occurs (i.e., the weapon
has reached point of contact), nor may the attack be delayed until
later once the critical half-segment has arrived--the combatants do not
have enough time to ascertain that the opponent is already beginning to
slump.  Again, to simplify this rule, all "to hit" rolls during a half-
segment, or at least all those directed against a single target, should
take place prior to damage rolls.  If a combatant anticipates his buddy
will be more than a match for a wounded troll, perhaps he should move
on instead of wasting an attack.  Feigning the gravity of one's wounds
suddenly becomes an attractive option.

MULTIPLE ATTACKS:  Fighters and some monsters may be allowed to use
their weapons or physical attributes more than once in a combat round.
This does not imply that the combatant can attack faster; rather, given
that both natural and manufactured weapons are constantly in motion
seeking an opening anyway, he attacks BETTER.  Instead of additional
attacks occurring at the end of the round, they may be made during the
attack portion of any later phase instead UP TO 1 ATTACK PER PHASE.
Should a creature actually be allowed a total number of attacks greater
than the total number of opportunities (i.e. more than 4), he may
double-attack within a phase, adding his weapon's SF to the half-
segment of the first attack.  Fighters gain such a rapid attacking
capability when fighting creatures below 1 HD.

MULTI-PART ATTACK ROUTINE (including two-weapon style).  Use the SF for
the slowest component if the SFs vary.  Attacker must declare IN
ADVANCE a target for each component--including multiple attacks on the
same target.  All attack components--including those aimed at a common
target--will follow-through within the same half-segment and therefore
may not be redirected even if the first part of the sequence kills the
target (see Overkill rule).   There is no real reason given under the
AD&D rules why a two weapon routine should not mirror the simultaneous
strikes of a creature's claw/claw/bite sequence, which may be likewise
dependent on the first blow to help position an immediate follow-up
(like the boxer's one-two combination).  Note that this rule also
breaks from the number of off-hand attacks allowed by the Player's
Handbook: each weapon may attack to the maximum applicable attacks per
round, but only in paired fashion (one part of the routine may not be
"saved" until later).  The same rule applies to monsters with multi-
part routines--all attacks are made together, with unattempted
component attacks lost for that routine, perhaps for the round.
     If the weapons used by a combatant yield different numbers of
attacks per round (perhaps she is specialized only with one of the
two), she may then attack with the favored weapon as a single-part
attack in a later phase.
Example: a 7th level fighter uses a long and short sword, but is
specialized only with the longsword.  Her attacks per round are
therefore 2 and 3/2 respectively.  She first attacks with both at a SF
of 5--the longsword's, which is slower by 2--and in a later phase
attacks with longsword only, also at SF 5.  Next round she would get
two attacks with the short sword, so she could make two paired
attacks.)

    OPTION: Separate distinct attack forms, such as paired claws from a
    bite, so that a creature may best position itself for each
    component attack.  The creature may only use one attack form per
    phase, or, if the number of forms exceeds three (such as with a
    dragon or tarrasque) no more than two per phase.  This option is a
    bit trickier to moderate but more realistic.  Keep in mind that
    like-attacks as part of a form are still simultaneous (i.e. both
    wing buffets, both horns, both claws)

STATIONARY, DEFENSELESS TARGET:  A defenseless target unable to move
out of the way of a blow is at +4 to its AC, receives no dexterity
bonus, and may be attacked each phase.  This category includes
spellcasters when invoking magicks requiring somatic components.

________________________________________________________________

D.  MOVEMENT
------------
After attacks have taken place, a combatant may move up to 1/3 of his
current MV IF unimpeded by opponents (see withdrawing / fleeing rules
below).

CLOSING MOVEMENT:  If a combatant comes within melee striking distance
of the opponent (typically within 5' or so), the opponent may choose to
withdraw or flee but may not continue to move away normally (he instead
engage, of course).  An exception to this would be parallel movement
coupled with simultaneous attacks, such as by two mounted figures
engaged while riding in the same direction.

WITHDRAWING / FLEEING: As with the existing rules, a retreating
character must further cut movement to 1/3 MV base in order to withdraw
from combat (making a 12 MV into just over 1 per phase).   A FLEEING
combatant may make a normal move, but is still a ripe target for a free
attack.  EXCEPTION:  the initiative winner may outrun the free attack
if the opponent has struck earlier in the SAME PHASE and has a MV no
greater than the one fleeing (the opponent was a bit off balance from
the last swing and the winner sees the opportunity to scram).   Of
course, the loser is free to pursue.  If another party member can
interpose himself, a combatant may flee unmolested.

CHANGE OF CURRENT  MV:  At the beginning of the movement phase, a
combatant may announce a speed change.  The change is effective
immediately, though it must be within the proportional limits listed
below:

ACCELERATION:  Movement from standstill to walking speed (base MV) is
automatic.  Additionally, a combatant may further accelerate up to 2x
base MV per phase (reaching maximum movement of 5x MV in two phases).
Apply the new rate immediately, after using PH rules for chances for
success based on Strength (p. 120).  Constitution checks are made each
round, based on top speed attained during the round.
DECELERATION: A character moving at any speed may decelerate by 2
factors immediately, and may come to a full stop by the end of a phase.
If, after the 2 factors have been subtracted from current MV, the
combatant is still moving at an accelerated rate, he must move at least
half his current MV per phase due to momentum.  If the runner wishes to
slow in a shorter space, he must roll vs. dexterity with a -1 penalty
for every 10' of slowdown distance he wishes to reduce, or fall prone
for 1d4 phases (no attacks, no dexterity bonus, opponents receive +4
bonus to hit the fallen figure).    Example: a human character running
full speed (base 12 x 5 = MV 60 or 20 per phase) wants to slow to a
walk.  She subtracts two factors of movement immediately, slowing to
36, or 12 per phase.  She must move at least 6 (half of 12) during the
phase and may then safely stop or slow to walking.  If she wishes to
"stop on a silver piece," she must pass a DEX check at  -6.

CHARGING: This is a special attack form taking place during the
movement portion of a phase after attacks are normally already
resolved.   Several considerations must be made:
      --The combatant must announce a charge and target at the
           beginning of a phase.
      --He may not attack during the normal attack portion in order to
           ready his weapon.
      --The attacker must be facing in the approximate direction of the
           target prior to movement, and must accelerate or already be
           accelerated to effectively charge (minimum of jogging speed,
           or base MV x 2).
      --After reaching the target and making the hit attempt, the
           attacker must continue to move past the target the full
           remaining movement for the current phase, but may then slow
           to base speed or less if desired.  The exception to this is
           if the charging character actually seeks to barrel headlong
           into the opponent, causing each to make both a Dexterity and
           Strength check to avoid falling, perhaps falling together.
           The charger may also attempt a rapid slowdown with the
           chances described above under "Deceleration."
      --The opponent is allowed a simultaneous return swing if he has
           stated that he is readying his weapon to receive an attacker
           in lieu of actually attacking this phase (see below).
           Otherwise the attacker rolls for damage and applies it
           BEFORE the defender can respond (perhaps killing him before
           he can do so).
      --A defender may not respond if it has already attacked within
           the phase or met its maximum number of attacks per round.
      --The attacker loses AC bonus from Dexterity while charging, but
           gains -2 bonus if mounted.
      --Since the charging attack takes place during movement, the
           opponent's own movement may have an impact on the success of
           the charge.  Evasion is an attractive foil to a charge.
      --A thief may make a charging backstab if previously unnoticed
           and if he makes a successful "move silently" check.

     EXAMPLE:  a mounted paladin charges a troll.  The horse is spurred
     to triple movement--48--in order to reach the troll within the
     phase.  The paladin will cover 180 yards during the phase.  The
     troll is only 130 yards away, so the paladin must overrun his
     target by the full remainder of his movement (180 - 130 = 50
     yards) because of momentum.  Since he spent the attack portion of
     the phase readying the lance, he attacks at the moment he closes.
     if the troll survives, it gets to counterattack before the paladin
     moves out of range--only if it has not yet attacked this phase.
     note also that the troll would receive its normal movement during
     the phase, and so might make a judicious decision however unlikely
     for a troll to get out of the way.

SETTING WEAPONS/READYING DEFENSE:  In lieu of attacking for a
particular phase, the combatant may choose to stand his ground or lay
in wait for the arrival of an opponent.  During the movement phase, the
opponent is subject to attack as soon as he moves into a defended area
if he is accelerated, caught unaware, or unable to respond. Normal
unconcealed closing movement between combatants receives no special
readying bonus--the exchange of blows takes place as normal in the next
phase.  The following are considered a readied defense/set weapon:
    --covering a small area such as a path, an open doorway, etc., with
         a missile weapon.  Likely to be caught unaware by the sudden
         missile fire, the opponent may only respond AT ALL if he has a
         missile ready also, and may only complete movement if he
         passes a surprise check.  Even so, the combatant covering the
         area shoots or throws first.
    --setting the butt of a polearm against an unyielding surface to
         receive a charging creature (does bonus damage if successful).
    --taking a stand with weapon poised to attack a charging/swooping
         figure (any weapon will do).  The speed factor is considered
         to be already counted as part of the readying, so the attack
         occurs as soon as the foe closes.
    --Ambush preparation: This form has its own special considerations.
         The opponent will ideally enter the area unaware, therefore he
         must pass a surprise check in order to counterattack.  Note
         that if a battle begins with an ambush scenario, use the rules
         for Surprise instead (see below): the ambush is then
         considered as occurring in the attack portion of the first
         combat phase with all ambushing weapons striking with an SF 1.

     A ready state may be maintained from phase to phase until an
     attack is made.

     EXAMPLE: in the previous example of the paladin and troll, the
     beast would have been able to simultaneously attack regardless of
     whether or not the paladin's lance killed it if it poised itself
     to receive the charge instead of attacking another target.  Since
     the paladin needed to state charging intentions during the attack
     portion of the phase, the dm might rule that the troll could
     figure out where the shiny human and horsy were heading).


MOVEMENT OPTION: HALF-SEGMENT INCREMENTAL MOVEMENT:  Movement can get
confusing under my "everybody who gets to move moves at the same time"
present suggestion.  While playtesting the system, one player claimed
his PC could safely reach cover before the obviously casting enemy
priest could have gotten off the spell, but because movement is done
last in the phase, the PC got whammied.  We took another look at things
and came up with the following.

Movement occurs in 10' units divided evenly over each of the half-
segments of a phase.  See the chart below.  I call the listed units
"squares" after the markings on our battlemat, but miniatures aren't
restricted in direction of moves (i.e. any angle is possible, and we
usually settle for a reasonable guess rather than measuring each
increment of movement.  Spell or Missile Range is another matter, often
requiring precision).

This way takes longer for combats involving many participants, but
offers precise location of figures as the fight would naturally
progress.  If precise movements aren't necessary, move figures their
full movement during the last half-segment of each phase, just to speed
things up.

Again, with the exception of a charging attack or short repositioning
movement, a combatant MAY NOT move and attack (by weapon or spell) in
the same phase.

________________________________________________________________

E.  MISCELLANEOUS PREPARATION
--------------------------------
By foregoing the attacks and movement, a combatant may do one of the
following:
     --sheath a weapon and draw another (DROPPING one and drawing
          another is allowed as part of an attack, with a delay of +3
          SF).
     --ready material components or other items about the combatant's
          person.
     --re-string a bow (if string is already in hand).
     --set a weapon to receive a charge or otherwise ready it in
          anticipation of a foe.
     --take a moment to survey the ensuing battle and plan a course of
          action.
Some actions may be performed while moving, at the DM's discretion.
Both players and DM's need to apply common sense to when such
preparations are allowed and how long they will take to perform.  Can
an archer re-string a bow if an enemy has already closed?  Not likely.

________________________________________________________________

F.  SURPRISE
------------
The idea of a surprised individual standing dumbfounded for an entire
round is unlikely, barring some sudden bump on the noggin.  Under the
phase system, a surprised individual loses one full phase, and
combatants moving up to a surprised individual may attack at the
completion of their movement, rather than leading off the phase with an
attack as normal.  In the event of an ambush occurring during a combat,
the bushwhacked combatant must pass a surprise roll in order to return
the attack.  This rule adds an interesting twist to a combat round:
surprise can occur at any time, should a sudden change of events occur.
The surprised individual is taken aback for a moment while those around
him adjust to the new circumstances more readily.  A caster should gain
a +1 to die rolls if currently in the midst of an incantation due to
the mental focusing involved in casting.
________________________________________________________________

And so we see how the phase system of initiative modifies the combat
round.  The phases place time constraints on the wide array of possible
actions within a one-minute period, and keep in perspective the
difference between methodical incantation, rapid weapon strokes, and
time-consuming movement through hostile areas.  In the form just
presented, this system may be incorporated into existing campaigns
without a substantial reconsideration of how combat operates.  In the
final section below, I introduce a much more radical departure from the
traditional combat "round".  For Phase System II, combat is divided
into phases only, not rounds, and actions such as casting complex
spells may be begun in any phase.  Number of attacks per round
translates to phase delays between attacks.


________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________

                             SECTION 3:
              PHASING OUT THE "ROUND": PHASE SYSTEM II
________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________


     This departure from the traditional combat round began with a
nagging question my players frequently posed regarding their
spellslingers: "What if Finchfingle Fuschafeather wants to cast a long
spell in the middle of a round?  Why should he have to stand there
until the next round begins?"   What would impede a caster from
beginning any spell at any time?  In both real-world battles and their
fictional counterparts, no bell sounds to signal the end of a "round."
Combat is a continuous frenzy of possible actions unnecessarily limited
by one-minute dividers.
     The idea of continuous, or rolling, combat is far from
incompatible with the current system.  The phase sequence for System II
is pared down to a continuous cycle of 3 identical phases with letter
designations A, B, and C.  Actions such as movement and casting may
"spill over" into the next phase--and those continuing beyond the end
of phase C are picked up in the next phase A, and so forth until the
battle ends.   Opportunities for physical and spell attacks are not
lost or inordinately delayed because the combatant is out of position
at the beginning of the round: he attacks as soon as he is able.
     Any three consecutive phases are equivalent to one round for
purposes of marking duration (of spells or various other effects).   As
with System I, each phase allows a combatant  to attack, move, cast, or
perform a miscellaneous action.   After an attack is performed, the
combatant must wait a certain number of phases (typically 2) before
again attacking or casting, though other actions may be performed.  In
the case of physical attacks, this delay represents the time necessary
for combatants to find the next opening in the opponents' defenses--no
weapon is motionless however.  For spellcasters, the phase delay equals
the time needed to regain composure in the aftermath of containing and
manipulating powerful magical energy. TABLE 4: PHASE SYSTEM II:

Most of the rules for Phase system I apply to system II, with the
following exceptions:

A:      SYSTEM II INITIATIVE ROLL
---------------------------------

Roll for initiative at the beginning of each A phase.  Initiative
determinations remain in effect through the end of phase C.  This is
the closest this system comes to marking off new rounds.  Since actions
or sequences of actions need not be contained in a round, the
occasional problem will arise of a combatant gaining his first attack
as an initiative winner and the second as a loser if it occurs during
or after the next A phase.  Similarly, a caster may begin a long spell
as a winner and end on the loser schedule.  Such are the uncertainties
of war--these delays represent merely a moment's hesitation.


B.     SYSTEM II SPELLCASTING
-----------------------------
As previously stated, casters gain the advantage of being able to start
long spells at the beginning of any phase, and may continue for the
appropriate number of CT segments.  If a spell has a one round CT (10
seg) it goes off after all other actions (including movement) at the
end of the third phase of casting.

SPELL DURATION:  One complete cycle of three phases equals one round.
Spells remain in effect until the end of the appropriate phase
(example: if a spell cast in phase B lasts one round, it expires at the
end of the next phase B after all movement and combat has been
resolved).  This system thereby allows greater precision in determining
how long lasts.

CASTING DELAY:  Upon completion of a spell, the caster must wait two
phases before casting again or attacking physically.  This represents
the time necessary for residual magic energies to dissipate from his
person, and for the caster to regain composure.  During this time the
caster may certainly gather new spell components or perform other non-
attack actions.

Optional Rule: Some players may argue that this version of the phase
system treats casters unfairly, particularly since they will only
maintain a one spell per round pace if their spells are less than four
segments (i.e. the whole spell may be cast in a single phase, followed
by a two phase delay).  One way to counter this limitation is to allow
the delay between spells to decrease at higher levels, much like the
weapon delay factor for fighters-- the difference being that the attack
itself (the spell) may take more than one phase to perform.

TABLE 5: CASTER DELAY SCHEDULE

CASTER LEVEL               DELAY SCHEDULE
 1-6                 cast spell, delay 2 phases
 7-12                cast spell, delay 1 phase
 13+                 cast spell, cast spell, delay 1 phase

Example: a 10th level caster begins a CT 5 spell on phase C.  Three of
its casting segments occur in C, but it is not completed until A.  The
caster delays only during phase B (being 10th level), then can begin
casting again on phase C.

A caster using 1-3 segment CT spells would effectively cast more than
once per "round" at higher levels, giving fighters even more incentive
to close quickly, or else polish up on missile weapon skills.  This
enhancement to spellcasting more than compensates for the advantage
given to weapons within a particular phase.  If either a priest or mage
wishes to physically attack after casting, the delay is automatically 2
phases.

C.     SYSTEM II PHYSICAL ATTACKS
Level of expertise determines the length of delay between attacks for
fighters.  All other classes attack once per round.  Note that missile
fire rates occur on the same schedule as the identical number of melee
attacks.  The sequence may begin on any phase.  In the event of an
unexpected or even voluntary phase delay, the sequence starts over with
the next attack.

                         6          - 2 attacks each phase

Note that casters MUST delay two phases after a physical attack
regardless of their delay time between spells.

MISSILE FIRE: The fire rates listed in the PH assume one attack per
round as the combatant's base.  This number increases as the base
number of attacks per round increases.  Multiply the fire rate by
number of attacks per round to determine the number of missiles fired
per "round."  Use this number to determine the delay schedule based on
phases.  This system gives a great advantage to high level combatants
employing missile weapons: at mid to high levels, missile users attack
at least every phase.  The English Longbowman again becomes the terror
of the battlefield--and the bane of all spellcasters who might suddenly
find themselves pinned down by a rain of arrows.

MULTI-PART ATTACK ROUTINES:  All portions of a routine occur within a
heartbeat of each other as per Phase system I.   If the optional rule
of splitting up like attacks is employed, begin the routing on the 1
attack per round schedule (attack, delay, delay) but allow subsequent
attack forms to substitute for delays.

TABLE 7: ATTACK FORMS AND DELAYS
# ATTACK FORMS  SEQUENCE OF ATTACK/DELAY PHASES
     1           1 attack form, delay, delay
     2           1 form, 1 form, delay
     3           1 form each phase
     4           1 form, 2  forms, 1 form
     5           2 forms, 2 forms, 1 form
     6           2 forms each phase

In the event of a discrepancy in number of attacks for two weapon
routines, use the schedule of the FAVORED weapon, alternating between
two weapon and single weapon attacks.

   EXAMPLE: a 7th level short-sword specialist also uses a dagger.
   according to table 7, as a specialist she attacks on the schedule
   "attack, attack, delay."  She therefore attacks with both weapons on
   the first phase, then with the short sword alone on the second
   phase.  The third phase is her normal delay.  The next phase begins
   the sequence anew).

This second form of the phase initiative system is by far the most
dynamic of the two.  By using phases instead of rounds, combat is
broken into smaller, contiguous units, allowing combatants greater
flexibility in decision making, including the ability to wait for a
moment or two to see how the combat progresses before deciding a course
of action, including the initiation of a long spell that normally would
have to be started at the beginning of the round.

                PHASE SYSTEM SUPPLEMENTAL RULES
________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________

             INTRODUCTION: NEW ABILITIES, NEW RULES
________________________________________________________________

First a few notes concerning the Phase System.

You may wish to remove the accompanying quick reference sheets and
character record and copy them.  I suggest placing each copy in a sheet
protector so notes may be made over them during combat using a dry
erase or water washable marker.

A few elements of these pages need comment.  Consider them as more
options under Combat II.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY WEAPON CHART: this should be updated each time a
character switches weapons.

PHASE NOTES: a player may check off each half segment or make a note
into the future phases of such details as next attack, spell
expiration, etc.

MOVEMENT SQUARES:  Each "square" is the equivalent of 10' of movement
and implies a gameboard featuring a grid sectioned off in 10'
increments.  The right column is number of squares per phase based on
the movement per round rate (left column).

References to the primary abilities are standardized as STR, DEX, CON,
INT, WIS, and CHA.  However, my playing circle has adopted two extra
abilities described below:

AGILITY: (AGI)
--------------
Dexterity has been divided into two separate abilities.  Agility
defines the overall quickness of a character, including his ability to
evade blows and area-effecting spells.  Dexterity (DEX) is the
character's manual quickness and steadiness.  A classical violinist has
phenomenal manual dexterity but may not be able to do a backflip.   On
the other hand fast feet do not guarantee hand-eye harmony--can every
gymnast shoot an arrow with precision, or even PAINT all that well?
Refer to the PH as a starting point for figuring both AGI and DEX
modifiers.  Under Combat II, the following new rules apply when using
AGILITY.

     AGI determines "Defensive Adjustment" for both AC and saves.  It
     is also used to modify the party initiative roll  (using the
     "Reaction Adjustment" score).

     DEX determines "Missile Attack Adjustment."  Additionally, use
     "Reaction Adjustment" based on the DEX score to further modify a
     weapon's speed factor (SF).  The new formula for computing
     adjusted SF is then

     (base SF) - (Magic bonus) - (Two-Handed Spec Bonus) - (AGI bonus)

AGI bonus to initiative equates to the speed at which a character may
react to a situation, and position herself for actions.  DEX bonus
translates to the speed at which she can bring her weapon itself to
bear.

Use the normal method of determining DEX to determine AGI.  Allow
racial modifiers to affect both scores.

THIEF ADJUSTMENTS: Skills are modified by either DEX or AGI.  Use Table
28 of PH.  Read "Dexterity" as the applicable ability.

AGI:  Move Silently, Hide in Shadows, Climb Walls (AGI 9 = -10%, 10 = -
5%, 17 = +5%, 18 = +10%, 19 = +15%)
DEX: Pick Pockets, Open Locks, Find/Remove Traps

APPEARANCE: (APR):
------------------
It's funny how often players transform their characters from magnetic
leaders into beautiful people as the occasion warrants.  Hitler is an
example of the former; Marilyn Monroe of the latter.  From classic
literature: Richard III and Helen of Troy.  In each case there is
clearly little overlap between compelling leadership qualities and sex
appeal, but Charisma lumps them together.   APPEARANCE is basically the
"Comeliness" of the UNEARTHED ARCANA tome.  The ability only has one
category: "Reaction Adjustment" and is used only when physical appeal
determines an NPC's impression of the character.

CHARISMA: A NOTE
----------------
This has traditionally and unfairly remained the "least important"
score for most characters (tied with Wisdom in some cases).  Normally
CHA's reaction adjustment is used in business dealings or encounters,
particularly with individuals not potentially attracted to the
character in a sexual way (in which case APR is used).  Charisma is
also the controlling factor in the relationship between PC's and
followers (MOST employees get past the physical thing quickly).  When a
character is generated, Charisma should receive at least a fair score
if the character has aspirations to be party leader or esteemed
advisor.  Could a character with only average CHA give effective orders
when push comes to slash?

PERCEPTION
----------
Combining the average of INT and WIS with a bonus of one point per
level, this grab-bag ability is a character's overall chance to
perceive any miscellaneous items, occurrences, or phenomena which fall
outside normal detection parameters.
     Option:  Thieves gain +2 per level.  Various demi-humans might
     also earn a bonus at the DM's discretion.

________________________________________________________________

                 CRITICAL HIT AND MISS TABLES I
________________________________________________________________

Many groups have implemented one form of critical hit/miss system or
another.  The following one is matched to the Phase System (either
one).  I shied away from a hit location scheme because the normal list
of AD&D healing spells are designed to restore hit points, not heal
localized wounds PER SE.  To use such a system begs the hit point
system itself to be broken down into points per area, etc.  More tables
always equals slower combat rounds.

SEVERE HIT
----------
This rule began at the insistence of some players that some bonus be
given if the number needed to hit a particular AC is exceeded by a
significant margin.  Here is the rule:
If the roll to hit exceeds the roll needed by 10 OR MORE, roll all
damage dice twice and take the best score.  Opponent is dazed for
remainder of phase. (-2 to attack rolls, +1 to AC).

CRITICAL HIT
------------
On a natural 20, roll a d10:
1-4  DOUBLE BASE DAMAGE.  Reroll all minimum rolls.  Opponent is DAZED
     until end of phase.  (-2 to attack rolls, +1 to AC).
5-6  DOUBLE BASE DAMAGE.  Roll all damage dice twice and take best
     score.  Opponent is DAZED until end of following phase.  (-2 to
     attack rolls, +1 to AC).
7-8  DOUBLE MAXIMUM  BASE DAMAGE.  Opponent STUNNED through the
     following phase (no attacks, +4 to AC.)
9    DOUBLE MAXIMUM TOTAL DAMAGE.   Opponent STUNNED through the
     following phase (no attacks, +4 to AC).  Attacker allowed 1
     additional attack immediately (include opponent's +4 AC penalty).
10   DOUBLE  MAXIMUM  TOTAL DAMAGE.   Opponent stunned through the next
     2 phases (no attacks, +4 to AC).  Attacker allowed 1 additional
     attack immediately PLUS one free attack next phase (in addition to
     regular attacks).


CRITICAL MISS
-------------
Automatic loss of remainder of attack sequence.  If Crit Miss delay is
LESS than regular delay, complete regular delay instead before next
attack.  Roll d10:

1-4  MISSTEP: Lose movement this phase (opponent may retreat
     unhindered).  AGI check or suffer +2 SF and -1 to hit next phase.
5-6  FUMBLE: Lose present phase movement.  DEX check failure = weapon
     dropped or skewed.  AGI check or "misstep" next phase (as above).
7-8  FALL TO KNEES:   Lose further attacks  through next phase, AC +2.
     Roll DEX-1 to avoid dropped or skewed weapon.
9    PRONE:  Attacker is stunned.  Lasts 2-3 phases.  Roll DEX -2 to
     retain each item held.  No attacks, no movement, AC +4.  AGI check
     at end of prone period to regain upright position.  Failure
     indicates "Fall to knees" result.  CONSIDERED STATIONARY AND
     DEFENSELESS FOR FIRST PHASE.
10   SPRAWLING WEAPON FLING:  lasts for 3-5 phases.  No attacks or
     movement, AC +4.   All held items automatically tumble away 1d12
     feet in random directions.  AGI check at end of prone period to
     regain footing.  Failure indicates "Fall to knees" result.
     Considered stationary and defenseless for first 3 phases.

MW   MISSILE WEAPON: thrown weapons drop within 1' of combatant.  Bows
     or Crossbows: 50% chance of string breakage.  50% chance of
     missile breakage due to misfire.

________________________________________________________________

          CRITICAL HIT AND MISS II: SEVERITY RULES
________________________________________________________________

No tables are necessary for this variant, and the only decisive roll is
the "to hit" itself.

SEVERE HIT:
PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING DAMAGE:  That this system bases bonus damage
on the attack roll, with each point rolled above the necessary number
"to hit" equal to +1 hp damage.  Specialization, magical plusses, and
strength bonuses all adjust THAC0, and therefore adjust the POTENTIAL
damage bonus by lowering the minimum needed to successfully hit.  These
are NOT automatically added in full with a successful hit.

STRENGTH:  Subtract the "to hit" column from the "damage" column for
each STR level (keeping +1 or below as is).  This is the new "damage"
modifier to be added to a successful hit.  2nd ed gave a lower "to hit"
bonus, but allowed ALL of the STR bonus to be applied to every hit.
     EXAMPLE: a fighter with 18/99 strength would get +2/+5 under 2nd
ed rules.  Under my rules, he'd get +2/+3 (5 - 2).  The +3 is
automatically added to damage, and the +2 "to hit" will help to ensure
that his "to hit" roll allows more damage as well (most likely giving
him at least the equivalent of his old +5 anyway, but not guaranteeing
it).

CREATURES WITH LISTED DAMAGE BONUS ONLY:  Larger humanoids get such
bonus damage without a "to hit" bonus (giants being a prime example).
Either apply this bonus in full with any successful hit, or apply half
of it (round down) to the creature's thac0, and the remainder as bonus
damage.  This would make hits more likely, but would not guarantee full
listed bonus damage unless the hit roll is several points over what's
needed.  The latter allows the possibility for more of a glancing blow
from even a giant's damaging hits.

SPECIALIZATION:  The first extra weapon proficiency slot expended
grants the wielder +1 to hit and allows all Warrior subclasses extra
attacks as per 2nd edition rules.
    CONTINUED SPEC: Each subsequent slot expended increases the "to
    hit" by 1, but does not affect the number of attacks.
     --ANY class may single specialize to gain the "to hit" bonuses
       (not the accelerated attacks).
     --All weapons, including missile weapons, follow this rule.
     --The "point blank" attack of bow weapons is now an independent
       form requiring 1 slot.

MISSILE WEAPONS:  For weapons allowing strength bonus (custom bows, all
thrown weapons) use the GREATER of the combatant's STR "to hit" bonus
OR his DEX adjustment.  Add the new STR damage bonus to the damage
roll.  Apply only the DEX adjustment for crossbows or normal draw-
weight bows (no STR damage bonus).

DAMAGE CAP:  No damage cap.  Any argument I make as to why there should
be a cap invites a counter-argument that even a small weapon can kill
or seriously damage a large opponent with a well placed hit.  Besides,
with the adjustments above, damage gains the additional possibility of
doing LESS than the minimum die roll plus all bonuses.  There is
balance.

CRITICAL HIT
------------
On a natural 20, the base damage roll is automatically maximum.  This
is in addition to whatever severe damage bonus a roll of 20 would
cause.


SEVERE MISS
-----------
Coming close to the number needed to hit will not unbalance a combatant
for the next attack; however, if the number rolled to hit is 5 OR MORE
LESS THAN the number needed, add 1 point to the SF of the weapon for
it's next strike PER POINT, up to a maximum penalty of the weapon's
BASE speed factor.
     EXAMPLE 1: a mage needs a 17 to hit with a quarterstaff (sf 4),
and rolls a 10.   Anything over 12 would have been at no penalty, but
in this case 2 points are added to the next attack's sf.  If a 6 were
rolled, the penalty would nevertheless not exceed +4.
     EXAMPLE 2: A thief attacks with a +2 longsword (it's sf adjusted
downward from 5 to 2, counting dex bonus of +1 and magic of +2).
Despite the sf 2, a penalty of up to +5 may be incurred, raising the
weapon to its slowest speed of sf 7.

Maximum duration of the penalty is 3 phases.  Thereafter it may be
assumed the combatant has regained normal balance.

CRITICAL MISS
-------------
In the event the combatant rolls a natural 1, follow the Severe Miss
rule above, but there is no maximum penalty to SF.  Additionally, the
combatant loses Agility bonuses through his or her next attack, or
through the next 3 phases, whichever is completed first.

                COMBAT II SUPPLEMENTAL MAGIC RULES
________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________


                 MANA: MEMORIZATION IS FOR KEEPS
________________________________________________________________

     Having left his keys in the castle, Arthur turns to Merlin only to
     hear this dismaying reply: "Sorry, m'lad, all outta KNOCK spells."

Both priests and wizards need to memorize the rituals and incantations
which constitute their spells.  They need to learn which components to
select (and which to carry in abundance) as well as which spells will
be useful in particular situations. The caster is a lightning rod for
magical energies, and, as he or she progresses in levels, these
energies become less taxing to manipulate: more can be focused and
channeled each day after proper rest and mental preparation. When a
fantasy spellcaster discharges a spell, only in AD&D does the caster
suddenly fall prey to amnesia.

Many playing circles have long since adopted some form of mana or
spell-point system to allow a caster access to the full list of spells
he or she has available, rather than requiring the caster to second-
guess upcoming events before selecting spells.  Below are two good
systems used in my group's campaigns, as well as their related rules
governing learning spells and point recovery.


________________________________________________________________

                     SPELL POINTS: MANA SYSTEM I
________________________________________________________________


This system offers maximum flexibility for a spell user to choose
spells as the need arises.  Use the applicable Spell Progression table
from the PH as a starting point.  Convert all spells a caster  may
memorize (under the old system) to a point total: one point per spell
level per spell.  Each spell conversely draws a number of points equal
to its level from the collective pool.  Example:  A fifth level priest,
barring bonus spells, can cast three first, three second, and one third
level spell.  His total mana points would equal twelve:
                    (3 x 1) + (3 x 2) + (1 x 3) = 12
When fully powered with mana, the priest could cast four 3rd level
spells, twelve 1st level spells, six 2nd level spells, or any
combination equaling twelve points.  The priest may not cast spells of
a higher level than the PH progression charts allows.
     A priest's bonus spells for Wisdom are kept track of in two
possible ways:

1. The caster adds the point value of the bonus spells to the mana
   total.  Bonus "spells" then indicate simply how Wisdom modifies the
   base mana.
2. The player places a number of boxes corresponding to his number of
   free spells for each level next to the mana tally.  The first spells
   of the day of the appropriate levels are checked off from the boxes
   instead of their points drawing from the mana pool.  Only when the
   caster exceeds the number of free spells does he mark off mana.

STARTING MANA
-------------
As an optional means of aiding low level casters, rather than using the
point score normally yielded according to the rules above, the caster
gains a number of points equal to her constitution divided by 3 (round
up).  Instead of a mage's third level total of 4 points, he could
conceivably have as many as 6 with an 18 constitution.  If the CON
total is less than the base, use the base instead.  Once the base
exceeds this number, use the base instead.  This accurately simulates
the way magic works in much fantasy fiction.  A novice may only
manipulate a certain amount of mystic energy before being both
physically and mentally drained, with hearty individuals able to
withstand a bit more.  As the novice progresses, his manipulation of
magical energies becomes less taxing for ever increasing amounts of
mystical power.
     Option 1: CON bonus is ADDED to the base mana total regardless of
               level.
     Option 2: use average of CON plus the caster's prime requisite
               (Wisdom or Intelligence depending on the type of magic,
               rounded down) to determine bonus mana or initial mana
               (rounded up).

The table below lists the base mana totals by level for any caster
based on Mana System I.  It does not account for free spells or extra
spells gained by specialists, nor does it account for the Constitution
adjustment for low-level casters.  Specialists gain a separate mana
pool dedicated to their specialty bonus spell total (since this mana
MUST be used for specialty spells)

Caster Type:

Level     Priest    Wizard    Ranger    Paladin
-----     ------    ------    ------    -------
1         1         1         --        --

20        165       162       9         9

*Indicates a new castable spell level.


MANA RECOVERY
-------------
A caster still must rehearse incantations and clear her mind in order
to replenish her mana.  Prayers must be offered to the gods, mental
alertness exercises must performed, etc.  The flat amount of 10 minutes
per spell level (point) regained may be used as per PH p. 81.  It would
therefore take a 20th level mage 27 hours to completely regain his
spells (realistically, another night's sleep must be added to this
time).  As an option that allows higher level casters to recover single
points faster, the following formula may be used:

13 - highest allowable spell level = number of minutes per point.

This assumes a full night's rest of 8 hours.  If the caster gets less
than eight hours, for any reason from insomnia to hot pursuit by
enemies, add 1 additional minute per spell point  PER HOUR'S REST BELOW
8.  If the caster gets less than 4 hours sleep, no points can be
regained.

BONUS SPELL POINTS: received automatically each day, provided the
priest sleeps at least 4 hours.  Specialist points are recovered at
half the required time per point (round up after totaling the minutes
required).

RECOVERY LIMIT: A caster may not regain a total number of points
greater than his or her casting total within a 24 hour period (i.e.
they may not replenish all points, use a few, and then regain some
more).  A spell recovery session may not be interrupted for more than
one 2 hour period.  If it is, any further recovery is delayed until
after the next normal rest period.

________________________________________________________________

             SPELL SLOTS PER LEVEL: MANA SYSTEM II
________________________________________________________________


Some players and DMs might convincingly argue that the "points"
represented by the particular spell are not the same across levels: a
WISH is more than nine times more powerful than MAGIC MISSILE but is
approximately the same magnitude as the 7th level RESURRECTION for
priests.  A way to solve this dilemma produces a mana system as easy to
manage as the above System I.  Under System II, the PH Spell
Progression charts are used directly to represent the number of spells
a caster may use for each level: but the caster chooses from his total
list for that level as the situation demands.  A check box system
should be set up on the character record sheet.  Be sure that the
caster record differentiates between bonus, specialist and normal spell
slots, though.

RECOVERY: Use one of the time options for System I with one exception:
the caster may elect which spell slots to recover.   Slots gained for
specialized spells may be recovered at half the normal rate.


________________________________________________________________

          LEARNING NEW SPELLS (AND FORGETTING OLD ONES)
________________________________________________________________

Mages have the unfortunate task of building a list of useable spells
instead of receiving a completed one via their deity.   Since no spell
is forgotten under the new rules, such powerful knowledge comes at an
additional price: 1/2 day of research per spell level for each new
spell added to the list if an arcane library and workshop is available;
1 full day per level otherwise.  Spells gained as part of class level
advancement are accounted for in the time spent training.

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SPELLS PER LEVEL:  As in the standard 2nd edition
rules, this restriction serves the purpose of preventing a mage from
playing a checklist game of what spells he still needs to have them
all.  Under the new Mana rules, maximum number of spells represents the
list of currently memorized spells for a particular level.  Once the
spell is "in memory" it stays there by daily review and practice.  Can
a mage continue to learn new spells once the "maximum" is reached?
Yes, by losing the knowledge of an existing spell at that level.  The
DM rolls for a random spell to drop off the list of ones memorized.
Exception: the player marks off five spells used most frequently (and
therefore the most memorable) as exempt.  Since the spell would still
be included in the caster's ever-growing spell book, it may be re-
learned later (bumping another spell off the memorized list).


INNATE SPELLS
1)  The easy answer to innate use of spells is "Keep them as is."
2)  A method more consistent with the use of mana is as follows:  If
    a monster has a particular list to draw from in which each effect
    matches exactly the equivalent spell from the Priests' or Wizards'
    lists, then do the following:
       I.  MANA SYSTEM I:  total all its possible points for the day
           based on each spells point value and allow it to cast any
           combination of the list's spells at their normal cost.
      II.  MANA SYSTEM II: reserve a slot for each spell based on its
           level.  These slots may each be used by any of the spells of
           that level which the creature has the ability to use.

If the creature is allowed spells at will or per hour, account for
these separately.

The Phase System rules under Combat II limit casters' effectiveness in
melee situations by slowing their casting times relative to weapon
speeds.  The Mana System (I or II) more than makes up for it by giving
spell users enormous flexibility in choosing spells as the need arises.

To Donald & Corinna Carver, Eric Weiss, Wulfgar & Andrew Wood, Lyall
Herr, and Mark Bishop for their previous combat methods which I used
for models, and for  both playtesting the C2 system and integrating it
as our new standard.

To the following members of the ADND-L Internet mailing list for their
questions, suggestions, and criticism:
Attilla (Brad Samek), Christopher Possanza, Scott Spetalnik, Madrac
(Ron Owen),  Aerlevar (Adam Darlow),  Nemesis (Paul Tiseo), and Sir
Gwalchmei (Jason Cunningham).

Special thanks to Charlotte the UK Vampire for her persistent questions
and insights.



                   DRAGONSHADOW THANKS YOU ALL.
