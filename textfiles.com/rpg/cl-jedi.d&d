    The Jedi are a class of specially trained ninja/psionicists.  The Jedi need
to follow the following requirements:

Intelligence of 13 or greater
Wisdom of 15 or greater
Dexterity of 15 or greater
Constitution of 13 or greater

Good Jedi:
Must not kill except in preservation of other life.
Must not act by dark side feelings (hate, anger, fear, etc.)

---

    A Jedi starts out with a Lightsaber.  It does 2d8 points of damage, is at a
+3 to hit, and can attack as a +5 weapon (if it's required to damage the
monster -- it's still, however, only +3 to hit and 2d8 points damage).  Due to
its powerful nature, it does not take strength bonuses.  At level 3 and greater
it will, however, allow dexterity to contribute to the "To hit" roll (i.e.
instead of +3, for a character with a dexterity of 13 it would be +4).  In
addition, on a natural roll of 20 any creature that has any limbs will lose a
random one automatically, such as a vorpal sword.  One that doesn't will merely
be sliced in half.  The lightsaber may count as "lightning damage", "fire
damage", or weapon damage, depending on how the DM uses it.  I prefer "weapon
damage", because of the fact that no enemies take more damage, and none are
even partially resistant.

    A good jedi needs the following amount of XP per level:

(Fighter XP)+(Cleric XP)+(Magic User XP)/2

    An evil jedi needs the following amount of XP per level:

(Fighter XP)+(Magic User XP)/2

    A good jedi may advance to unlimited levels, no matter what race.  An evil
jedi may only advance to 25th level (although this is a much higher level than
would ordinarily be in a campaign).

    A Good jedi MUST be Lawful Good, no exceptions.  An evil jedi must be evil,
but it may be neutral, lawful, or chaotic.  Neutral jedi simply does not exist,
although any good DM may put it in their campaign with no arguments from me.

    The jedi gain 1d8+1 hp per level up to 9th, then an additional +2 hp per
level, plus constitution bonuses.

    A jedi does not start with any weapon proficiencies, acting as though all
four were spent on the lightsaber.  I know this may be unrealistic, but it's
fair.

    A jedi uses a "spell point" system, and gains 2d4 spell points per level up
to 9th, then an additional 2 sp per level afterwards.  As for the spells, well,
I'll get to them later, or DM's may create some for their campaign now.

    Hafun!

In a message posted <19 May 92  18:52:56>, Thomas Head writes:

  In the spirit of both the Star Wars and AD+D rpg, I suggest that you  DON'T
feel obligated to start out Jedi PC's with lightsabers.  Lightsabers were no
longer produced by the time of the movies and were rare enough that the sight
of any would be legendary.  Instead I would suggest that a lightsaber could be
woven into a quest for a would-be Jedi testing both his bravery and concience
to the limit in the process.

  AS a (mostly former) AD+D gm, I have a prejudice against limb severing
weapons being an automatic part of the class despite the justifiable
background.  I would suggest that you use the wand of force from Unearthed
Arcana which was no doubt inspired by the SW lightsaber.  The wand of force
which is described has havin a handle-like design has 3 functions although the
third was only usable by a magic-user with certain spell knowledge.

   1) +5 bastard sword 1 charge/ turn of use

   2)  act as disintegrate if touched to a wall of force or similar
manifestation, regaining one charge in the process

   3)  Cast a wall of force provided user was a magician who had the spell in
his book.

   I concede that my suggestions would jibe with what others consider "true"
Star Wars gaming.  But I would counter that that would be better served with
the Star Wars RPG and if translated literally would ill-fit an AD+D campaign, I
try to propose a compromise.

   Another consideration might be Jedi kits for various classes for more
variety.  A Jedi wizard would be a variant on the Militant Wizard kit, whereas
a Jedi Psionicist could be very much like a young Yoda figure.  Instead of
Jedi's facing Darth Vader, why not the forces of the divine Vecna or the
Emperor Ming.  Revise an AD+D Jedi in the context where the Force isn't the
only magical force available and you can have something that can fit
harmoniously within AD+D especially if you use Spelljammer.  Try too much for a
literal fit, and you'll be asking for trouble.

                         The Jedi Knight
               (Condensed, First Edition version)

                        by Nancy McCaskey


Stats and hit dice: As Monk.
Races allowed:      any
Alignment:          Lawful Good only.  Lawful Evil (Sith) Jedi have
                    switched alignment from Lawful Good.
Armor allowed:      As Monk.  The D.M. may rule that the Jedi have
                    the same armor class bonuses as monks.  The
                    D.M. may allow armor to be worn for emergencies
                    and/or until the Jedi reaches 3rd level if the
                    campaign or dungeon is particularly rough.
Weapons allowed:    any; light saber always preferred.  See the
                    next section, "The Light Saber Revisited" for
                    full information.

Jedi hit and save as Fighters, due to their special abilities in
tuning in to "the Force."  this ability gives them an intuitive
understanding of where and when to hit, as well as where their
opponent is likely to strike next.  Because of this ability and
their training, Jedi have no minuses on their "to hit" rolls due to
blindness, darkness, or invisible opponents.

Restrictions:       Material possessions restricted as Monk.  Must
                    endure rigorous and highly disciplined
                    physical and psionic training.  May not attack
                    an opponent first (see TLSR for details).
                    Uses the Monk Experience Chart, but with a
                    15th level maximum.

Benefits:                Gains one Minor Discipline per level and
                         one Major Discipline every three levels.
                         *Telekinesis* will be learned as soon as
                         possible.  Starts out with one Attack and
                         one Defense mode and gains one or the
                         other, alternating, every level.  Held in
                         high, almost mythical, regard by most
                         Lawful Good societies.  Levels of Psionic
                         Mastery are standard.  A first-level Jedi
                         starts out with 100 + 11d4 psionic
                         points, then gains 10 points per level
                         until the species maximum is reached.  He
                         or she can "recharge" faster than normal
                         by entering a trance (see TLSR for
                         specifics).  To attain the rank of Jedi
                         Master (15th level), a Jedi must seek out
                         and defeat a Jedi Master.  Unlike monks,
                         the loser will not lose a level; if the
                         player character fails to win the duel,
                         (s)he is free to try again in a year.
                         Good Jedi won't fight each other to the
                         death.  An Evil Jedi can either kill or
                         subjugate his opponent.  A Jedi cannot
                         advance beyond 3rd level unless (s)he is
                         under the tutelage of a Jedi Master.
                         Characters with the potential to become
                         Jedi are rare, Jedi Masters even more so.
                         A Jedi who takes time out from his/her
                         acetic schedule to marry (or reproduce,
                         in societies without marriage) will
                         probably choose a partner with high stats
                         in the hopes of producing another Jedi.
=================================================================

                     Light Sabers Revisited
                    (also by Nancy McCaskey)

     Light sabers are specialized swords used by Jedi Knights and
their fallen brethren.  An inactive light saber resembles a rod;
when activated, a long blade of light appears.  The light will glow
blue-white for Good Jedi and a dull red for Evil ones.  If a light
saber has been separated from its owner for more than 1 week, only
another Jedi will be able to reactivate it.  A 0-level Jedi will
intuitively know how to recharge his/her light saber, which drains
2 psionic points from both Attack and Defense for each round it is
used.  Light sabers only operate when hand-held; if fumbled or
dropped, it will turn off immediately.  A Jedi may only own one
light saber at a time.  No additional magical properties can be
added to a light saber.

     Light sabers are a focus for the Jedi to use his/her psionic
points in combat.  Jedi will prefer a light saber over any other
hand weapon.  D4 weeks after obtaining a light saber, the weapon
will be bonded to its owner.  Bonding will have the following
effects:

     1.        No Jedi of opposite (Good/Evil) alignment will ever
               be able to use that weapon.

     2.        2d4 charges will remain in the light saber for
               emergency use, provided that the Jedi puts these
               points into the weapon in the first place.   If the
               light saber is separated from (not in physical
               contact with) its owner, these points will
               dissipate at the rate of 1 per day.

     3.        The owner will be able to use telekinesis to bring
               the weapon into his/her hand at a distance of 10
               feet per level, with no drainage of psionic points.
               The owner must already have *Telekinesis* as a
               discipline, however.  Certain spells and psionic-
               dampening materials can block this power.

     4.        If the light saber is permanently lost or
               destroyed, the owner will suffer the same
               consequences as a magic-user killing his/her
               familiar.

     Good Jedi are allowed to fight only in self-defense or in
defending Good creatures from Evil.  The base psionic cost for
using a light saber in combat is (10 - opponent's armor class).
Please keep in mind that two negatives make a positive, so trying
to hit AC -10 will yield (10 - - 10) = (10 + + 10), or 20 points
from Attack AND Defense.

     If the Jedi wishes to make the light saber the equivalent of
a magical weapon, (s)he must spend 10 psionic points for each plus
desired.  Unmodified damage from a light saber is 2-8 vs. all sizes
of opponents.

     If the Jedi misses a "to hit" roll with any number other than
a 1, (s)he may spend (20 - unmodified number rolled) psionic points
from Attack and Defense to make the roll a hit.  Critical hits are
*not* allowed with this method.

     Light sabers can cut through flesh, stone, and metal, provided
enough points are expended.  Some magical spells, notably *Wall of
Force*, can block a light saber.  Light sabers in a high-tech
campaign can deflect lasers.  The D.M. will have to rule whether
they can also block magical energy directed at the Jedi (Magic
Missile, Color Spray, etc).

     In other words, a Jedi can hit hard and fast, but can't keep
it up for long!  Under First Edition rules, the maximum psionic
points possible for a human are 144.  (Yoda's were higher...anyone
who can levitate a SPACESHIP without breaking a sweat...!).  Jedi
can recharge their psionic points at twice the Sleeping rate by
entering a trance state, but this requires, at the very least,
physical immobility and secure surroundings.

     Light saber duels between Good and Evil Jedi involve both
physical and psionic combat.  A trick particularly favored by Evil
Jedi is to slide their light saber along their opponent's, hoping
to catch their foe unawares and slice off a hand.  They
deliberately injure, rather than kill, if they are trying to turn
their adversary to the Dark Side (Lawful Evil).  A Jedi who
reclaims his/her light saber to continue the fight runs the risk of
having the OTHER hand amputated, essentially rendering him/her
temporarily useless.  Many a young Jedi, suffering from pain and
shock, as well as the trauma of losing his/her light saber, has
either turned or chosen to suicide if (s)he can't find a way to
escape.  (Note:  the D.M. should leave this choice up to the
player--it should never be determined by rolling dice).  Once a
Jedi attains the rank of Jedi Master, he or she cannot be turned.
