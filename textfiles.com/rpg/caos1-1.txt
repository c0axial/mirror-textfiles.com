Editor's Note:

For this first two digests, I've pulled a handful of articles from a
Stormbringer list that I tried to get running a bit over a year ago.
The list unfortunately went belly up, but some of the articles are
still of interest.  Also, I've included a few things I wrote up as
well as the first two articles I received from subscribers.  Thanks
much to John Davis and Eric Rowe.

Subject: More Feast Events
System: Pendragon

Here's more fun things that can happen at a feast.

[this can be used as an alternative to the table on page 114 of
 Knights Adventurous -sda]

1: Someone chokes on a bone. First aid to save. Fumble leads to death.
   Failure means person took 1d6 damage.

2: Messenger arrives with important announcement.  Good scenario
   lead-in.

3: A player notices another knight abusing a serving maid verbally.
   Did she deserve it? Or is he just an uncouth fellow. Just/Arbitrary.

4: One of the entertainers makes a serious blunder. Do the players
   insult him? Or do they applaud as if it had not occurred?
   Merciful/Cruel

5: The feast goes on late into the night. Do you stay or insult the
   host by leaving?  Energetic/Lazy

6: Someone challenges a player to a game between courses. His skill is
   3d6.  He wagers 10d on the outcome.

7: A player gets a terrible case of gas.  Does he leave and offend the
   host?  Or does he stay and offend his neighbors? Courtesy or
   Modest/Proud

8: A rumor is going around besmirching the reputation of a lady.
   Intrigue to find the source. Do the players know the lady? Is the
   rumor true? Does her honor need defending?

9: An attempt at assassination by a servant. Awareness. Who is the
   target?  Who is behind the attempt? Why?

10: An event of religous significance. Perhaps a vision or the
    appearance of a stranger. Religion. Is a quest called for?

Subject: Two New Round Table Knights
System: Pendragon

Following are two former player characters from an old Pendragon
campaign that I ran last year.  They were both rather interesting
fellows who became Knights of the Round Table very shortly after it
was founded.  They might make interesting NPCs for other people's
Pendragon campaigns.

BACKGROUND & PERSONALITY

Amlyn first gained a name for himself when he defended a crone against
a knight she had once ensorcelled.  He stood bravely against that
knight, despite the fact that he had no sword and no armor.  Since
then, he has often taken to removing his armor when the most serious
battles are upon him.  Men who recognise Amlyn quake in their boots
when they see him taking off his armor, for they know that death or
mortal wound are likely soon to follow.  Arthur was impressed by
Amlyn's reckless bravery, and it was for that that he made him a
knight of the round table.

middle bottom of the shield, below the Chevronels, is a flower, gold
and silver in color.

BACKGROUND AND PERSONALITY

Michrulan is a valorous knight who was knighted the same year that
Arthur was first made King.  In his first days as a knight, he served
Arthur loyally, fighting in many of Arthur's early battles.  From the
start, Michrulan was known by all for his two great passions, his
loyalty to his horse, Bleucephus, and his amor for the Cymric farming
girl, Adwin.  Guenevere was impressed by Michrulan's great love for
the girl Adwin, despite her low status, and it was for this reason
that she convinced Arthur to appoint him to the Round Table.

Here's a list that I've constructed of most of the products that
Chaosium has put out over the years.  There are a few gaps, so I'm
clearly missing a few things from this list, but it's moderately
complete.
