	Here's how we do bow damage in the two AD&D campaigns we are running.
"Matt's system" operates on the principle that bows (and especially x-bows)
should do a buttload of damage.  It includes the mini-ballista, the Mauler
Crossbow:

Matt's System:
	
Type		 Weight		Size		SF	FR		DMG
								   S-M	     L
Mauler Crossbow   20		 5'		15	1/3	   4d6      4d6
Heavy Crossbow	  14		 4'		10	1/2	   3d6      3d6
Light Crossbow	   7		 3'		 5	1/1	   2d6	    2d6
Hand Crossbow      3		 1'		 3	1/1	  1d6+1     1d6

Comp. Longbow	   4		 4'		 3	2/1   FA   2d4	    2d4
							      SA   2d6	    2d6
Longbow		   3		 6'		 4	2/1   FA  1d6+1    1d6+1
							      SA  1d8+1	   1d8+1
Comp. Shortbow	   3		 3'		 2	2/1	  1d6+1	   1d6+1
Shortbow	   2		 2'		 3	2/1	   1d6      1d6


	With everything else as listed in the PH2.

	My system works on the principle that the best reason to use a crossbow
is that any 0-level moron can use it.  I reflect this in a bonus "to hit" with
the weapons.  I also have them do a bit more damage.

Jim's System

Comp. Shortbow	    +2		1d6+1	     2	    3	 2/1	6     12     20
Shortbow			 1d6	     2	    4	 2/1	5     10     15

	* DEX check to make second shot

	Short Range -- No penalty to hit or damage
	Medium Range -- penalties -2 to hit, -1 damage (min of 1)
	Long Range -- penalties -5 to hit, -3 damage (min of 1)


	And, as a laughing happy bonus, here is my weather generation table!




			
			JIM'S WEATHER GENERATOR
			-----------------------
			
	Start with whatever precipitation and wind conditions you wish,
	then roll d% at the start of each day for the change in weather
				conditions:

01-03	5 steps better			Precip.			Wind
04-07	4 steps better
08-15	3 steps better			Clear			Calm
16-24	2 steps better			Ptly Cloudy		Breeze
25-39	1 step better			Mostly Cloudy		Lt. Wind
40-60	same				Cloudy			Windy
61-75	1 step worse			Misty/Drizzle (*)	Heavy Wind (***)
76-85	2 steps worse			Rain/Sleet (**)		Gale (+)
86-93	3 steps worse			Thunderstorm/Snow (***)	Cyclone/Tornado
94-97	4 steps worse			Deluge/Blizzard (+)		(+++)
98-00	5 steps worse			Hurricane/Monsoon (++)

* Maximum Duration 14 days
** Maximum Duration 10 days
*** Maximum Duration 6 days
+ Maximum Duration 3 days
++ Maximum Duration 1 day
+++ Maximum Duration 6 hours; also fast-moving phenomena

Obviously contradictory results (Clear + Tornado, Misty + Gale) are always 
	decided in favor of precipitation.  That is, the wind conditions
	are re-rolled or a suitable wind selected

If a change would place a condition off the scale (say, 3 places better than
	Partly Cloudy) the change is re-rolled.  If the re-roll is still
	impossible, treat as "same".

Severe weather conditions can only persist for their maximum duration.  At the
	expiration of that duration, the weather immediately improves one place.
	For the next three days, subtract 20% from all change rolls.
