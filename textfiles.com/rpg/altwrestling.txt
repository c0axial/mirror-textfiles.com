                          THE NEW AND IMPROVED

                      ALTERNATIVE WRESTLING SYSTEM


INTRODUCTION

     Wrestling is the most basic of combat skills, unknowingly
practiced by almost all children as they rough and tumble with each
other. However, there exists a fine art of wrestling that only
professional wrestlers use. Thus, the Alternative Wrestling System
exists for those characters who are willing to spend a weapon
proficiency slot to learn and master the AWS.


COMBAT

     Before the player makes an attack roll, he should roll the
percentile dice (1d100) and consult Tables B-G for the results. If the
die result is on table B, C, D, E, or F then the player is attempting
to do a standard, lifting, strength, agility, or illegal hold. If the
character meets the appropriate requirements given for the hold that
was rolled, then the player can make a normal attack roll to see if the
hold is successful.
     Table G contains special items that require additional rolls on
the tables or no attack rolls whatsoever.

Notes for Requirement Section of Tables

     MP refers to the maximum press of the character as defined by his
strength. W refers to the opponent's weight. Oppt's is an abbreviation
for Opponent's.


Damage

     Damage for the holds are given as hit points loss. Thus, a person
who receives a chop suffers 1 hit point of damage.
     In the case of a few lifting holds where damage is listed as W,
the victim of the hold suffers an amount of damage equal to his weight
divided by 20. For example, a man who weighs 200 pounds gets body
slammed.  He suffers 10 (200/20) points of damage from the devastating
move.
     In the case of a few strength holds where damage is listed as
1/rd, the hold is a continuous hold. Until broken, the victim suffers 1
hit point of damage per round. To continue the hold, the character
cannot do other moves or actions. Of course, the character may opt to
voluntarily break the hold. The hold can be broken if the character is
successfully attacked by an outside force.


Modifiers

     If a character is attempting to wrestle in armor, the modifiers on
Table A are used (these are penalties to the attacker's attack roll).
Normal modifiers to the attack roll are also applied.


TABLE A: ARMOR MODIFIERS FOR WRESTLING

Armor                              Modifiers
Studded leather                       -1
Chain, ring, scale mail               -2
Banded, splint, and plate mail        -5
Field plate armor                     -8
Full plate armor                     -10


     Penalties for being held or attacking a held opponent do not apply
to wrestlers. Wrestling involves a lot of holding and twisting as it
is, and the damage resolution system for wrestling takes this into
account.


BEING PROFICIENT

     Upon spending the 1 weapon proficiency slot for AWS, the character
must create a specialty hold that would be used in the case of a roll
of 98-100 on the tables. The specialty hold can be almost any type of
hold within reason. The only requirement is that damage done by the
hold doesn't exceed 4 points with the exception of a Lifting Hold that
does damage depnding on the oppenent's weight. Players are encouraged
to make an exciting and imaginative hold. GM's should make sure that
the hold has reasonable requirements.


WRESTLING SPECIALIZATION

     A player can spend another weapon proficiency slot to specializing
in the AWS. Any character of any class can specialize in wrestling.
Although other rules may state otherwise, any character of any class
can specialize in wrestling in connection with a specialization in
punching or martial arts.
     When a character specializes in wrestling, he gains the following
benefits:

     - He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with wrestling.

     - He gains a +1 bonus to all damage rolls for a successful high
impact maneuver.

     - He gains a +1 chart bonus with all wrestling attacks. The chart
bonus is a reflection of the character's superior accuracy with
wrestling. As already known, when the character successfully hits, the
roll itself determines which maneuver was used. But the specialist can
modify the result. With the +1 chart bonus, he can choose the maneuver
one higher or one lower on the chart.

     - He gets to choose a strike, hold, and high impact maneuver that
becomes his own personal attacks. When his personal attacks are rolled,
double damage occurs.


CONTINUING SPECIALIZATION

    Although other rules may state otherwise, any character of any
class may continue to devote slots to wrestling. For every additional
slot devoted, the wrestler gets the following benefits:

     - He gains an additional +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with
wrestling.

     - He gains an additional +1 bonus to all damage rolls for a
successful high impact maneuver.

     - He gains an additional +1 chart bonus with all wrestling
attacks.
