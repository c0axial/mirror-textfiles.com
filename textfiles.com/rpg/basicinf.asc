Introduction

Striker is a set of rules for science fiction ground combat using
miniature figures. The rules are presented here in a form which can be used
with only a map, some paper, and pencils. This allows players to use these
rules with Megatraveller adventures, or as a stand alone combat system. If
you are interested in miniatures see the section at the end of the rules
titled 'An Introduction to Miniature Gaming'.

The science fiction background of Striker is drawn from the universe of
Traveller. All weapons and military technology described in Traveller and
Megatraveller are included in Striker. These rules may be used in
conjunction with Traveller or by themselves; no familiarity with Traveller
is required.

In Striker, as in Traveller, technology is rated by tech levels; these
rules cover weapons and equipment ranging from tech level 5 (about World
War I) to tech level 16 (the level of Traveller's Imperium). Present-day
Earth is about tech level 7 or 8.

The rules of Striker are divided into introductory and standard sets. The
introductory rules, presented here, are intended to introduce players to
the concepts, and procedures used throughout the game. The standard rules
will expand upon these to detail all areas of conflict resolution. Ground,
air, naval, space, and small scale skirmish actions will be covered in
lavish detail. Campaign rules to allow players to integrate Striker into a
Megatraveller campaign or to fight an extended miniatures campaign, and
rules for designing vehicles and heavy weapons will round out the standard
rules.

Task Based Action Resolution

In the introductory game there are only two actions that require a dice
roll to resolve success. These are hitting a target with direct fire, and
checking a unit's morale. Both  of these use a simplified version of
Megatraveller's task based action resolution. Briefly the procedure is as
follows:

Tasks are shown thus;
Difficulty, offensive modifiers, defensive modifiers

Difficulty: This gives the modified dice roll (two six sided, or 2D6)
required to achieve the desired results. The possible difficulties are;
simple: 3+, routine: 7+, difficult: 11+, formidable: 15+, and impossible:
19+.

Sometimes this value is variable, such as with the to-hit roll. Here the
value varies with the range to the target, movement of the firing unit, and
the number of troops firing. At other times there is a modifier to the
difficulty base. With morale a DM of +1 is applied to the dice roll before
any other modifiers apply.

In all cases a table of modified dice rolls and the results obtained from
the rolls will be given. Where there is a modifier such as in the case of
morale this is not added to the roll before consulting the table. The table
has the modifier built into the results already.

Offensive Modifiers: These are modifiers based on conditions occurring at
the time of the roll. They are added to the dice roll resulting in an
increased chance of success.

Defensive Modifiers: These are similar to offensive modifiers but are
subtracted from the dice roll, thereby decreasing the chance of success.

Rule 1:Basics

The introductory Striker rules assume an Earth like environment, a
breathable atmosphere with the same pressure, temperature range, surface
gravity, and approximate planetary size. Advanced rules will deal with the
effects of different planetary characteristics on the game.

A: Game Scale: Striker uses the following scales.

1. Soldiers: Each soldier is considered as a separate entity. Where
miniatures are used each miniature represents one soldier, or weapon.

2. Distance: All distances are given in meters.  Work to the scale of the
map if one is being used.  A superimposed grid on the map or game surface
of 50 m, (square or hex) can be used to help aid movement and distance
calculations. If English measurements are more convenient to use,
multiplying distances given in meters by 0.04 will give the value in inches
at a scale of 1:1000.
3. Time: One turn equals 30 seconds of real time.


B: Die Rolling Conventions

1. Required Throw: If only a number is stated, it must be rolled exactly. A
number followed by a plus (such as 8+) indicates that that number or
greater must be rolled. A number preceded by a minus (-6) indicates that
that roll or less results in that effect. Two numbers separated by a dash
(#-#) or stated as # to # indicate rolls in that range give the result.

2. Number of Dice: A dice throw uses two six sided dice.

3. Dice Roll Modifier: (abbreviated DM) are always preceded by either a
plus or minus. Thus the notation DM+3 indicates that three is added to the
die roll before it is compared to the required throw. When a die roll
modifier is called for, the dice are rolled and the modification made to
the die roll before consulting the appropriate table.


C: Scenario Set Up: The scenarios provide you with a map of the
battlefield, forces involved, and playing time. The grids on the maps
represent 50 m intervals.

Rule 2:Battlefield

A: Terrain

1. Clear is open ground presenting no blocks to line of sight.

2. Hill contour lines represent 3 m elevation changes.

3. Forests are areas of undergrowth with trees up to 12m high.

4. Buildings Each floor is 3 m high, sloped roofs add one floor high for
line of sight purposes. When using miniatures buildings represent built up
areas.

5. Water obstacles, such as rivers or lakes, are blocks to movement for
foot troops unless stated in the scenario. However,they are treated as
clear for line of sight and movement of Grav equipped units.

6. Roads: Roads are improved paths through other terrain types.

Rule 3:Game Management

A: No Referee: The introductory game assumes no referee.
1. Limited intelligence: Troops that  have not yet been spotted are held
off the map/table (see hidden & concealed, rule 7A2,3). Their positions are
indicated by using counters to represent each fire team. The counters are
1/2" square, and marked (on the back) with the unit ID.  Dummy counters
equal in number to real units are also given to each player. When the unit
is revealed by detection remove the counter. If it represented an actual
unit, that unit is placed on the map/table. At times, it may be useful to
roll dice to determine if an unrevealed unit has been hit by fire, in order
to avoid giving the firing player any information about the enemy unit.

B. Sequence of Play: Each turn is divided into five phases. At the
beginning of the game, one player (or group of players) is designated the
first player, the other is the second player.  Throughout the rules, the
terms friendly and enemy phase (movement phase or fire phase) are used. For
the first player, the friendly phases are the first player movement and
fire phases (phases 2 and 3), and the enemy phases are the second player
movement and fire phases (phases 4 and 5). For the second player the
opposite is true.
Each turn consists of the following phases:
1. Command Phase: In the introductory game the only activities in this
phase are rally checks (rule 8C5)

2. First Player Movement Phase: The first player moves his teams. (rule 6)

3. First Player Fire Phase (rule 8)

a. The first player's troops which did not move may fire.
b. The second player's morale checks.
c. The second player's teams fire *
d. First player's morale checks.
e. The first player's teams fire **
f. Second player's morale checks

* Increase the difficulty profile if the team moved last turn. No fire is
allowed if it moved and is using heavy recoil weapons or if it failed
morale in step b..
** No fire if the team failed morale in step d. Increase the difficulty
profile if the team moved in phase 2. No fire is allowed if it moved and is
using heavy recoil weapons.


4. Second Player Movement Phase: The second player moves his teams. (rule
6)

5. Second Player Fire Phase (rule 8)

a. The second player's troops which did not move may fire.
b. The first players teams check morale.
c. The first player's teams fire *
d. Second player's morale checks.
e. The second player's teams fire **
f. Second player's morale checks

* Increase the difficulty profile if the team moved in phase 2. No fire is
allowed if it moved and is using heavy recoil weapons, or it failed morale
in step b..
** No fire if the team failed morale in step d. Increase the difficulty
profile if the team moved in phase 4. No fire is allowed if it moved and is
using heavy recoil weapons.

Note: The fire steps in a fire phase are not simultaneous, if a team is
affected by the results of the previous fire, or morale check step, the
results are applied at the end of that step.
Rule 4: Forces

A. Composition: The basic building block is the infantry fire team. It is
composed of four soldiers, any number of which may be members of a weapon's
crew. Teams are organized into higher level units, as outlined below. Where
a team contains an officer or NCO, that trooper is considered to be the
first member of the team, and the team is called a 'leader team'. If the
first trooper of a leader team becomes a casualty, that team is no longer
considered a leader team for all purposes.

A team's morale is its ability to stand up under fire. Poor quality troops
average about 4, very high quality troops can go to 13. Its initiative is
an indicator of degree of motivation of its troops. In the introductory
game there is only one quality level of force (it corresponds roughly to
conscript value in the standard game).

1. Unit Organization:

a. Squads: Three teams make up a squad. Two have morale values of 5 and low
initiative. The third team has average initiative, a morale value of 7 and
contains the squad NCO, making it a leader team. The two low initiative
teams are under the command of the average initiative team.

Types of teams may be mixed within a squad. For example; a squad might
consist of two infantry teams, and a team with weapon crew of two and two
infantry men.

b. Section: Two squads combine to make a section. One of the two average
initiative leader teams is considered to contain the section NCO. That team
is in command of both squads.

c. Platoons: For every two full sections you get an additional team, for a
total of 13. This one has the platoon officer. It has high initiative, a
morale value of 9, and commands the other twelve. One of the two section
NCOs is considered the platoon senior NCO, and should be noted as such. If
the platoon officer is lost the platoon senior NCO may command the platoon.

d. Company: A company consists of from two to five platoons and has a
command group of one team for two platoons, and an additional team if over
two. The first of these has the company commander. It has high initiative
and a morale of 11. It commands the entire company. The other contains the
company senior NCO. That team has average initiative, a morale of 11 but
only may command any single section (or platoon if that platoon's officer
is lost). That section is still under the command of its' platoon officer.

B: Unit Cards: After a player's force is organized, its characteristics
should be recorded on cards for easy reference during the game. One card
contains the information for a platoon. The card contains an entry for each
trooper in the team, their position if a leader, weapons crewman, or radio
operator, the weapon they are carrying (including ammunition type), and the
armor they are wearing. In addition, the morale, initiative, and
identification code of each team appear on the card. The information
provided for weapons, and armor  is copied in the section at the bottom for
ready reference. If a trooper becomes a casualty the easiest method is to
draw a line through their entry. A master card is provided in the pullout
section. It may be copied as needed. Each scenario provides information on
the forces involved. The information provided should be copied onto the
cards.

Rule 5: Command Control & Communication

A. Command & Control: In the introductory game low, and average initiative
troops must be led by teams designated as their leader (see rule 4A1) in
order to perform as the player wishes.

1. Requirements: In order to lead, a leader team must

a/ be in communication with the soldiers being led (see 5B).
and
b/ have a line of sight (see rule 7A1), or be within the command range to
the soldiers being led (see below).


2. Command Ranges:
a. NCOs
Squad: Teams within a squad must be less than 100 meters from their leader
team. This applies even if the leader is also a section or platoon NCO.

Section: Section NCOs have a command range of 200 meters to the other NCO
in the section. The same applies for platoon NCOs when they are considered
as section NCOs. Section NCOs may still lead all teams in their section if
those teams are within 100 meters.

Platoon: Platoon NCOs have a command range of 400 meters to the other
section NCO. They may lead all squads in the platoon if the squad NCOs are
within 200 meters. Individual teams may be led directly if within 100
meters of the platoon NCO.
The intent of this rule is to allow senior NCOs to take command of troops
whose normal leaders have become casualties or gone out of sight or range
of their superiors. To lead troops they must normally be under the NCO's
command. Section NCOs command all troops in their section, platoon NCOs can
lead any teams in the platoon.

For example; If the squad NCO is lost, any leader wishing to take command
of the squad must be within 100 meters of the remaining stands. If the
section NCO is lost, the new leader must be within 200 meters of the
remaining squad NCO, and 100 meters from the teams the section NCO had in
their squad.

b. Officers: Officers have a command range of 400 meters. This applies to
subordinate officer and NCO teams (platoon and/or section). Officer teams
may lead any team but an officer senior to them.

c. Effect: If low initiative troops are not being led, the only actions
they will perform (and must perform) is i/ fire at any enemy troops in LOS
and within 100 m, and ii/ perform actions mandated by adverse morale check
results. Average initiative troops, and low initiative troops within 100 m
of them, are treated the same but may fire upon the enemy at any range, or
not, as they desire. High initiative troops may move and fire without
restriction. Because of these restrictions each side in a game must have at
least one high initiative (officer) team, even if they don't comprise a
full platoon.

B. Communication: In order to control their forces, officers and NCO teams
must be in communication. Teams can signal the presence of the enemy,
allowing other teams to react, if they are in communication. There are
several means possible.

Teams cannot react to events they can't see unless they are in
communication with ones who can. For example, if a team does not have LOS
to an enemy unit moving along a gorge it cannot move to a position where it
would unless it is in communication with both a) a team which can see the
enemy and b) its own leader. Even if the team wishing to move was a leader
team it would still have to be in communication with the spotting team as
it cannot 'read minds'. Note if the team sighting fires non-laser or gauss
weapons (since these are silent), other teams (friendly or enemy) can react
to that, and move to investigate, etc.

1. Direct Verbal Communication: This includes hand signals and verbal
commands. Any two teams which are touching are always in communications;
any two teams connected by a chain of touching teams, up to 250 m long, are
in communication. Finally, any two teams which can see each other and are
within long range (250 m) of each other are in communication.

2. Radio: teams equipped with radios are in communication with each other
as long as both are within the stated range of each other's radios.At tech
level 5 each company has one radio , usually with the company commander. At
tech level 6 each platoon officer also has a radio. Between tech levels 7
and 8 section NCOs also have a radio, and above tech 8 each soldier has
their own radio.

Rule 6: Movement

Teams move and conduct various movement-related operations during their own
movement phase. All teams have an allowance expressed in meters which may
be used for movement or related operations. Movement operations are;
movement, setting up heavy weapons, changing concealed/ hidden status.

A. Movement Allowances

1. Personnel: Infantry has a movement rate of 50 m per turn if walking, and
100 m per turn if running. In the introductory game only troops in battle
dress (powered armor) may run, and may do so every turn.

2. Grav: Infantry wearing grav belts move like grav vehicles. They have
three listed speeds: maximum, cruise, and NOE (nap of the earth), and three
flight modes: high, terrain following, and NOE. Maximum speed is 300 kph or
2500 m per turn. Cruise speed is 225 kph or 1875 m (round to 2000 m) per
turn. NOE speed is 40 kph or 333 m (round to 350 m) per turn.

a. Maximum Speed: This is the fastest speed a team may travel. It may use
this speed only in high mode. A team traveling at maximum speed may not
make any changes of direction.

b. Cruise Speed: This is the fastest the team may travel in terrain
following mode. While traveling at cruise speed the team may turn as much
as it desires. However each turn regardless of the size of the turn
consumes 10% of the team's movement allowance.

c. NOE Speed: This is the fastest the team may travel in NOE mode. When
traveling at NOE speed teams may turn without limit.

d. High Mode: A team in high mode is at least 10 meters above the highest
terrain feature on the battlefield.

e. Terrain Following Mode: A team in terrain following mode is following
the contour of the land, and is always 10 meters above the terrain feature
(ground, trees, building, etc.) which is directly beneath it.

f. NOE Mode: A team in NOE mode is flying close to the ground, dodging
around terrain obstacles rather than flying over them. It is considered to
be 4 meters above the ground.

g. Popup: A grav team which is stationary in it's movement phase may
execute a popup. It rises straight up to whatever altitude it wants and
drops back down in the same turn.

B. Terrain Effects on Movement: Terrain affects the movement ability of
teams differently depending on the terrain type and mobility type of the
team, as noted below.

1. Clear flat terrain has no effect on movement.

2. Hill Contours:  For every three contour lines infantry crosses in a
movement phase subtract 10 meters of movement. Grav equipped troops in high
mode are unaffected. Movement is deducted after the third contour line is
crossed. This allows some teams to just cross a contour line. Movement is
lost going up-hill only. Slopes where the contour lines are less than 3m
apart are considered prohibited to foot infantry movement, either going up
or down.

3. Forest: Personnel, whether on foot or wearing grav belts move through
forest at double cost. Grav teams are unaffected when flying over forest in
terrain following or high mode.

3. Water Barriers: Streams, rivers, lakes, and pools of water constitute
water barriers. Personnel on foot may cross water barrier only at bridges
and fords. Movement at fords is 10 meters per turn. Personnel with grav
belts are unaffected when flying over water barriers.

4. Buildings: Units adjacent to buildings may enter  in their next movement
phase. Units may ascend or descend one level (floor) in each of their
movement phases. Teams exiting buildings may move up to their full movement
allowance that phase. Only grav equipped units may exit a building at
levels other than ground level.

5. Roads: Roads are treated as clear terrain for movement purposes. Hill
contours still affect movement, however.
C. Movement Effects on Fire: Whether a team moves may have an effect on its
ability to fire in subsequent fire phases (see rule 8).

D. Other Movement Actions: These include setting up weapons (see 8A1ii),
and changing status (7A3).

1. Crew Served Weapons: Some crew served carried weapons require time to
ready them for firing. This is the SET UP value  listed for the weapon, and
is the number of friendly movement phases required. No movement or fire is
allowed while a weapon is setting up. The same amount of time is required
after a weapon has set up to ready it for movement again. If a weapon has a
set up value of three, it is ready after having spent three friendly
movement phases in the same position. It is treated as moving for combat
and spotting during those phases.

2. Personnel and light weapons in concealment may choose whether they  are
hiding or concealed. The decision is made in a team's movement phase and
applies until its next movement phase. Teams which are hiding may not be
spotted. If already spotted before becoming hidden, their position remains
known  as long as they do not move; use a 'live' counter. Hiding teams may
not spot, fire, or perform any other activities requiring observation of
the area; they are keeping their heads down. If a team is concealed and
becomes suppressed, it immediately hides.


E. Movement Markers: It is often necessary to remember whether a team moved
in order to determine movement effects on firing and spotting; the easiest
way to maintain a record is by using a small marker placed on or beside the
team. The marker is placed at the end of the  phase the team moved in and
remains until the beginning of the next friendly movement phase. Markers
may be made from half-inch cardboard squares (boardgame counters are useful
for this). Markers indicate a team's movement status, and flight mode; NOE,
terrain following, high flight, popup if grav equipped. The simplest course
is to make a marker only when it is needed.

Rule 7: Detection

A. Visual: Due to constraints imposed by weapon ranges and time, the
primary limitations on visibility will be blocks to the line of sight, and
target concealment. With miniatures a ground scale of 1:1000 does not allow
many gaming tables to cover an area more than 3000 meters long, well within
normal visibility ranges. Visual sighting is also called spotting.
1. Line of Sight: A team, in order to be able to see another  team, must
trace an unblocked line of sight. The line of sight is a straight line from
one team to the other. It is interrupted by any terrain feature directly
between  and of a greater height than both teams. If the teams are at
different heights a terrain feature higher than the lower team will not
block line of sight if; the feature  is closer to the higher team than one
quarter the distance between the teams.

Example: the distance between the two teams is 400 meters, one team is on a
hill 15 meters high, the other in the second story of a building and is
therefore 6 meters high. Any terrain feature greater than 16 meters high
will block the line of sight. Any terrain feature whose height is equal or
less than 15 meters will not block the line of sight if it is within 100
meters of the team on the hill. Finally, any terrain feature less than 6
meters high will not block LOS.

The actual game heights of teams and obstacles are listed in rules 2 and 8.
Most of the time, whether the line of sight is blocked can be determined by
examining the teams on the battlefield.

The following features may affect the line of sight, either by blocking it
or by determining the altitude of a team.

a. Teams: Teams do not block line of sight.

b. Hills: Hills block the line of sight as above.

c. Forests: Forests block the line of sight, with certain modifications.
Targets in the outer 30 m of forest or within 30 m of other teams in
forests are in concealment terrain. Targets further in are hidden. Teams in
forests are protected from observation from above.

d. Buildings: Buildings block the line of sight. Troops in buildings may be
able to see over obstacles because of their higher positions.  Buildings
are 3 meters tall per story; a soldier on the third floor of a building
would therefore be 6 meters above the ground.

2. Concealment: Personnel and light weapons are concealed if they are in a
forest, or building. Concealment reduces the ranges at which targets may be
seen. Teams in concealment may still spot.

3. Hidden Teams: Personnel and light weapons in concealment may choose
whether they  are hiding or concealed. The decision is made in a team's
movement phase and applies until the next movement phase. Teams which are
hiding may not be spotted. If already spotted before becoming hidden, their
position remains known  as long as they do not move; use a 'live' counter.
Hiding teams may not spot, fire, or perform any other activities requiring
observation of the area; they are keeping their heads down. If a team is
concealed and becomes suppressed, it immediately hides.

4. Spotting Procedure: Targets are seen automatically at certain distances.
These are based upon the status of the target, and whether the sighting
unit moved or not. No team may be spotted beyond the maximum range for
targets of its size. For infantry and light crew served weapons this range
is 5 km (plus appropriate signature modifiers). Teams which have not been
spotted by the enemy may be kept off the board; their possible positions
(and movements) should be indicated by using markers on the battlefield in
place of the team. The players should also have a number of dummy markers
at least equal to the number of 'live' ones to confuse the enemy. If an
unspotted team wants to spot it cannot be a dummy, and is identified as
real. Unless it is spotted it does not have to reveal itself.

Rule 8: Combat

All combat is divided into three steps. First, determine if the target is
hit. If a team was hit what was the effect. Finally if casualties were
suffered check the morale of troops affected by them.

A:To Hit

1. Direct Fire: Direct fire is aimed at targets the firing team can see.

a. General: Check to see if the following apply to the attack.

1. Who may be attacked: In order to be attacked, a target must be in the
line of sight of the firing team(s). It must also be spotted before the
current fire phase although it may presently be hidden or concealed. In a
team's friendly fire phase, it may fire and be fired upon at any position
(or positions) it occupied during its movement. In the enemy fire phase, it
fires and is fired upon at its current position. Teams that don't move but
elect to change status from concealed to hidden are considered hidden for
all fire. For example a team executing a popup fires and is fired upon from
its highest position in the friendly fire phase and from its NOE position
in the enemy fire phase.

2. Allowed number of attacks: During the course of a single fire phase,
most weapons are capable of engaging only one target. One target is a
single fire team of troops. Each member of a team must fire at the same
target(s). Multiple teams may and should fire at a single target. The range
is from the farthest firing team to the target.

Some weapons with high rates of fire are capable of engaging more than one
target in a phase. The number of targets each weapon can fire at in a
phase, if greater than one, is listed in the weapon data section. All
targets must be within an area referred to as the danger space. One dice
roll is made for each target. The distance for all fire is that from the
most distant firer to the farthest target.

The procedure is as follows. Choose one team as the prime target. The
danger space is an area 20 m wide between the target and the firer. Attack
all teams, up to the weapon's 'targets' characteristic. Start with the team
nearest the prime target, then the next closest and so on. Friendly teams
are treated the same as enemy. Teams which passed through the danger space
in the previous movement are also attacked. Unspotted, hidden and concealed
teams are also attacked.

Some weapons have two rate of fire settings, single shot and automatic. For
the introductory game use the greater number of targets and the automatic
fire bonus.
3. Movement Effects: The effects of the attacking troops' movement.

a. Infantry: If troops moved at all in their previous movement phase, they
fire in the next two fire phases with a reduced chance of hitting. Some
infantry weapons are designated heavy recoil weapons; troops armed with
these, if they move may not fire until after spending the next friendly
movement phase stationary.

b. Crew Served Weapons: Some crew served carried weapons require time to
ready them for firing. This is the SET UP value  listed for the weapon, and
is the number of friendly movement phases required. No movement or fire is
allowed while a weapon is setting up. The same amount of time is required
after a weapon has set up to ready it for movement again. If a weapon has a
set up value of three, it is ready after having spent three friendly
movement phases in the same position. It is treated as moving for combat
and spotting during those phases.

4. Grenades: Grenades may be thrown, or fired from a grenade launcher or
rifle. Hand grenades have an effective range of 20 m, and a long range of
50 m. They may engage one target.

5. Recon by fire: Generally, teams may not fire at enemy teams that have
not been spotted. However, players may direct fire at an unspotted marker
or hidden team. Fire is resolved  as recon-by-fire against an unspotted
target and with a defensive target DM against a hidden one that was
previously spotted. If the result is a hit and there are troops present,
the hit is resolved and the troops are spotted. If there are no troops
present, and the shot would have hit; the marker is removed. If the shot
misses the target is not revealed.

6. Ammunition: In the introductory game, for the sake of simplicity, all
weapons are assumed to have an unlimited supply of ammunition available.
Small arms which are capable of firing more than one type of ammunition
must have the single type that they will use written down before the game
begins.

b. Procedure: First all attacks for the step are announced, the troops
firing and their targets are identified. Then one roll is made for each
attack using the Hit Table. Each trooper in an attack must have the same
type of weapon. If the teams firing have more than one type of weapon, then
one attack is made for each weapon type. If troops are participating in an
attack, others from the same team may only attack the same target, or not
make any attack at all.
Up to one section (6 teams) may attack a single target. If more than one
team from a section is attacking the same target, they must combine in a
single attack for each weapon type. Section A1a must apply to each team
firing.

The general procedure is to first determine the difficulty profile. Then
roll two dice. Modify this roll for offensive and defensive conditions.
Compare the modified roll with the difficulty profile on the to hit table.
The number where the two values cross is the number of hits the target team
sustains. If the target takes a hit or there is a 'M' in that position the
target team also takes a morale check.

1/ Determine the difficulty profile: The difficulty profile is based upon
the range, and modified for firer movement, and number of teams firing.

a. Range: The range is considered to be the range from the team firing
farthest away from the target to the target. Measure from the center of
both firing and target teams. This is then compared to the weapon's listed
ranges to determine the range used to resolve the fire. The ranges are
divided by the difficulty of the shot. For example; at 250 meters the range
for a 7mm ACR using DS rounds is 'routine'.

b. Movement: If the firing team moved in its previous movement phase the
difficulty profile is increased by one level (one column to the right,
difficult would become formidable). If the weapon being used is
gyrostabalized and the firer moved, the dice roll is subject to a +2 dice
roll modifier after the difficulty profile is increased (only once not
twice).

If the weapon being used has a high recoil no fire is allowed until the
unit spends one enemy movement phase stationary.

c. Number of Firers: Total the number of troops firing in the attack and
divide by four (the number of troops per stand), round down. Decrease the
difficulty by one if more than two stands (8 troops) are firing. Decrease
the difficulty profile by an additional one if more than four stands (16
troops) are attacking.

2. Roll two dice and add the modifiers listed below.

a. Offensive Modifiers: The following are offensive modifiers and are
positive DMs (are added) to the dice roll

i. Trooper Skill: Use the highest initiative level of all the teams firing
at the same target. If that team is high initiative add two to the dice
roll. If it is average initiative, add one to the dice roll. If it is low
initiative no DM is applied to the dice roll.

ii. Automatic fire: Certain weapons receive an automatic fire bonus, as
indicated by a plus sign and a number following the penetration number on
the data table. Add this number to the dice roll. If the weapon also has an
asterisk after the autofire bonus number double the autofire bonus.

b. Defensive Modifiers: The following modifiers are subtracted from the
dice roll.

i. Target Status: If the target is concealed (see rule 7A2) subtract 1 from
the roll. If the team is hidden subtract 2 from the roll. If executing
recon by fire the dice roll is reduced by 4.

ii. Target Movement: If the target moved at speeds up to and including NOE
speed (350 m) subtract 1 from the roll. If it moved faster reduce the roll
by 2.

3. Compare the modified dice roll to that listed under the column headed
"2D6 roll". The number to the right under the column corresponding to the
difficulty profile arrived at above is the number of hits the target team
receives.

4. Hit Assignment: The hits on a team are distributed evenly, with uneven
numbers of hits distributed randomly by die roll. For example, if five hits
were received by a team, each soldier would be hit once and a die roll
would determine which received the fifth hit.

5. Explosive Rounds: With explosive rounds, the to hit roll made is for a
contact hit. It is directed against the intended target team. If it hits,
one soldier randomly chosen, is attacked using the contact penetration.
That soldier will not be subject to a fragmentation attack. Explosive
rounds, and non personnel high energy weapons, have a burst size listed. If
it is 0 m ignore the following. If the burst size is 1 m only the target
team is affected. All teams (including the target team) whose distance from
the target is less than or equal to the burst size (regardless of whether
it was hit) are subject to a fragmentation attack. The distance is measured
from the center of the team. Make one roll with a difficulty profile of
difficult for each target team and apply a offensive  DM of +1 for each
soldier remaining on the stand.

Example; Three teams (12 troops) firing at formidable range, moved last
phase with gyrostabalized weapons. One team has high initiative and their
weapons have an autofire bonus of +2. The target is concealed and
stationary.

The difficulty profile is formidable. Since there are more than two teams
firing the profile is reduced by one to difficult. The firing teams moved
so the profile is increased to formidable, but as the weapons are
stabilized there is an additional +2 added to the hit roll.

The player rolls a 10. Add 2 for stabilized weapon equals 12.
Offensive modifiers add 2 for a high initiative team in fire, and add 2 for
the autofire bonus for a total of 16.
Defensive modifiers subtract 1 for a concealed target. Final roll is 15.

A modified dice roll of 15 with a difficulty profile of formidable gives a
result of 1 hit on the target team.

B. Damage Effects: Once  targets have been hit, it is necessary to
determine what, if any, damage was done.

1. Procedure: Compare the weapons' penetration at the range firing with the
armor value of the target. If the penetration is greater than or equal to
twice the armor value of the target, the target trooper is a  casualty. If
the penetration is at least equal to the target's armor halve the weapon
damage (round down). If the damage value is greater than 0 the trooper is a
casualty. If the penetration is less than the armor the shot has no effect.

2. Cover: If the target is hidden, it may not fire, nor attempt to spot,
but all hits against it strike the cover. If the team is concealed, it may
fire and observe normally. Calculate the armor level of the target using
its hidden or concealed value and the effects of multiple armor below.

COVER TABLE

Cover                  Armor Value
:                 hidden     concealed
building            8            4
forest              7            3

3. Multiple Armor:

Multiple Armor: If a shot hits a hidden or concealed team it receives the
benefit of the cover's armor value as well as its own armor (for example, a
hidden soldier who is also wearing battle dress). Since armor value is
determined on a logarithmic scale, the two armour values are not simply
added together. Consult the armour thickness table; convert the armour
values to their equivalent thicknesses in cm of hard steel. Add these two
numbers together then convert the sum back to an armour value not exceeding
this sum.

Armor Rating Table

Value  cm     Value  cm     Value  cm
1     0.25     8    2.00     16   4.20
2     0.50     9    2.25     17   4.59
3     0.75    10    2.50     18   5.00
4     1.00    11    2.75     19   5.45
5     1.25    12    3.00     20   5.95
6     1.50    13    3.25     21   6.48
7     1.75    14    3.54     22   7.07
_             15    3.86

For example, suppose a concealed soldier is in a building (armor class 4)
wearing battle dress of armor class 10. Armor class 4 equals 1 cm, armor
class 10 equals 2.5 cm. The sum is 3.5 cm. Armor class 14 is 3.54, this is
too large so armor class 13 at 3.25 cm, is used.

4. Types of Wounds: In the introductory game the effect of any casualty is
the same for all; the soldier is removed from play.

5. Recording Casualties: Casualties should be marked on the player's team
card and shown on the figures as well.  Casualty caps, washers, gummed
paper reinforcing rings, or any of a variety of means are available to
designate which soldiers on a team have been hit and removed from play.
6. Effects of Casualties: Each casualty suffered by a team reduces its
morale by 1. The team's initiative is not affected unless the casualty was
a leader (the first trooper in a leader  team). If an leader is eliminated,
the team is no longer capable of the functions of a leader (leading and
rallying other teams), and the initiative is reduced by one level.

If a soldier or gunner is eliminated, another soldier may use his weapon.
This occurs during any movement phase. Fire in the following phase is
subject to a -2 DM. If a weapon crew member is eliminated other members of
the team must man the weapon or it can not be used, however, there is no DM
for movement. The weapon is available immediately after the next  movement
phase (unless the gunner was also a casualty and not replaced).

If a team manning a weapon is reduced so there are insufficient soldiers to
meet crew requirements, another team may switch places (or combine if there
are a total of four or fewer troops), if within one move's distance. This
is done in a friendly movement phase. Treat as firer moved if the gunner
was involved. A combined team for this purpose uses the lower morale and
initiative values from the two teams.

C. Morale: Morale checks occur when dictated by combat results,  whenever
casualties are suffered, or if a leader stand routs within 200 meters and
in LOS of a team. Each team has a morale value number. This represents its
general ability to stand up under the stress of battle. At various points
in the game teams will be required to take morale checks.

1. Conditions Under Which Morale Must Be Checked: Morale checks must made
if the team took casualties that fire phase, was within 50 m of a team (and
can see it) which suffered a casualty that phase, is required to by a
combat result, or was within 200 meters of a leader stand which routed.

Morale checks are made at the end of each fire phase. A team will never be
required to check morale more than once in a fire phase. Thus, if a team
took casualties, or is required to check morale, from several sources in a
single fire phase, it would check morale at most  once after all fire is
resolved.

2. Procedure: The player rolls two dice, adds the teams current morale,
(after effects of casualties if they apply) and applies the appropriate
modifiers. Compare this roll to the table. The die roll must be greater
than or equal to fourteen for it to pass the check, and to perform as the
player desires. If the number rolled is less, it will suffer adverse
results. If the roll is between nine and thirteen  the team is suppressed.
If the roll is less than nine the unit routs.

a. Roll 2D6

b. Add offensive modifiers: Add the  team's current morale number and
modifiers for the presence of friendly commanders, and concealment status.

i. leaders: Whenever a leader team is required to check morale, that check
is conducted before the checks of any teams it may be influencing. If it
fails the check, its morale modifier becomes an unfavorable modifier for
all teams visible within 100 m (the number is subtracted from the
subsequent rolls).

Officer teams provide a modification to any troops, but an NCO team may
provide it only to  teams normally under his leadership. An officer/NCO
team may influence the morale check of a subordinate leader team.

Visible leader teams within 100 m will cause a DM. Each NCO adds 1 to the
morale roll, and each officer 2. A company commander, if in the game, adds
3.

ii. cover and concealment: If the team is concealed add 2 to the roll. If
it is hidden add 3.

c. Subtract Defensive Modifiers: The only modifiers are for casualties.

i. Casualties this phase, not in the team, subtract one each from the dice
roll. Casualties suffered by the team affect the permanent morale (see rule
8B6).

d. Permanent Modifiers: These alter a team's morale number, and should be
recorded on the team card. A team has its morale reduced by one for each
casualty the team suffers, and each time it is routed.

4. Morale Results: Three results are possible from a morale check. If the
modified dice roll exceeds thirteen the team functions normally. If not
the following two results are possible depending upon how high the dice
roll was.

a. Suppressed: The team may not fire, move, nor attempt LOS checks. This
effect lasts for one complete turn (from the step it failed the check in to
the end of that same step in the next turn). Place a suppressed counter
on/near the team. Use a suppressed 3 counter if it was suppressed in the
first player's fire phase and a suppressed 5 counter if it was suppressed
in the second player's fire phase.

b. Routed: The team does not fire and will move away from the enemy each
movement phase until it leaves the game board or is rallied. Its first move
is as soon as it fails the morale check. It does not move in its next
movement phase, but is considered to have moved for fire purposes. If a
team routs off the battlefield it is removed from play.

5. Rallying: Teams which rout will continue to retreat until rallied.

Officer/NCO teams will check morale each turn in the command phase. If it
passes the check, it has rallied; it may not move or fire in the turn but
returns to its normal capabilities in the next turn. If it fails the check
it remains in its previous condition.
In order to rally troops, an officer/NCO team must be visible and within
100 m of them during the command phase. Neither the rallying team nor the
troops being rallied may move or fire during the turn. No die roll is
required, and the teams return to their normal capabilities in the next
turn.

An Introduction to Miniature Gaming

The original Striker was designed to use 15mm miniatures. There has not
been a large number of science fiction miniature vehicles and infantry made
available in this scale. That combined with the costs of this scale has
limited its appeal. Because of this I have designed this version of the
rules around the 'micro' scale (1:285, 1:300, 5mm or 6mm). A wide variety
of micro scale figures and vehicles are readily available from a number of
manufacturers in a range of periods. With careful selection and a little
conversion work these can be used to fight science fiction battles.

When using miniatures our suggestion for ground scale of one millimeter
equals one meter or 1:1000 gives a good feel for gaming purposes at 'micro'
scale. Four figures mounted on a common base 12.5 mm; 1/2 inch square is
used to represent a team.

List of Counters Required

During playtesting we have found a need to record some items of
information. It is required to be readily available during a game as it
affects the course of play. Since most of the information is basic we make
use of counters (1/2" cardboard board game style) to record and display it.
The following is a suggested list you will find handy to make before or
during a game.
live
firer moved
Altitude (NOE, terrain, high)
routed

The following are recommended as front/back of a single counter.
hidden/concealed
suppressed F/suppressed E

To indicate turns of Set Up we recommend a series of counters with numbers
on them. Generally lots of 1s and 2s are required decreasing in amount with
the largest numbers equal to the longest set up times listed for weapons in
use in your games.

fire teams                 within 100 m of the squad NCO

Note: Units may alternately be within the range stated of a higher level of
superior. Example: Fire teams within 200 m of the section NCO, or 400 m
from the platoon officer, or senior NCO are considered under command and do
not have to be within 100 m of their squad NCO (if say that leader was
lost).

  Type: Treat all weapons as light crew served weapons except as noted below.
    1. These weapons are treated as individual infantry weapons.
    2. This weapon uses a magazine like any infantry weapon, therefore it 
    requires only one crew.
    3. All these weapons are the same basic weapon. The differences are the 
    weapon mount and ammunition supply.
    4. All these weapons are the same basic weapon. The differences are the 
    weapon mount and ammunition supply.
    5. These weapons are treated as high recoil individual infantry weapons.
    6. these weapons are heavy crew served weapons.
  Mounts: Except as noted below all weapons weight include mounts for fixed, 
  main or cupola only.
   To use them as infantry, flexible, pintle, or open requires a weapon mount 
   as listed below.
