[LTUAE - the game, Part 3]

                        Secondary Goals.

The secondary goal of LTUAE is to acquire net.friends and
charisma.  The person with the most net.friends (when Gerry
finally goes mad) wins the game.  In the case of two or more
players getting the same number of net.friends, the person with
the least number of net enemies will win.  Similarly, if multiple
players have the same highest number of net.friends, and the same
number of net.enemies, then the person with the most charisma
will win.

If you lose too much charisma, you lose net.friends, and gain
net.enemies.  A person with no charisma is unlikely to have any
net friends.

You can also battle against other players rather than just 'The
Gerry' - each person has their own 'sanity points' [100 each],
and they are rendered insane/impotent if their sanity count
recedes to between 3 and 11 points [randomly chosen].  A person
who has lost more than 75% of their sanity points will no longer
be allowed to use addons/powerups.  The rules are similar to
those governing 'The Gerry', except that the 'I'm leaving!' rule
will immediately and permenantly wipe out a player - who will be
confined to his or her room until the game is complete.  Players
who wipe out other players may collect all unused bonus points,
but any addons the defeated player had, are not available to the
victor.


       Bonus Points, Addons, Power-ups and Saving Throws.
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The game is made somewhat easier with the addons and power-ups.
Unfortunately, as a raw newbie, you don't have any addons
available, and you must amass bonus points in order to purchase
them from the regional Fidonet coordinator.

Bonus points can cascade around your ears, or be as elusive as
unicorns.  The way you play the game *will* affect how well you
fare in collecting bonus points.

Bonus points can be cashed in for addons at the start of a day's
mail session.  Addons do not appear until the next mail session,
when they are available for immediate use.

Current addons and power-ups include

                                those messages out.  Minutes can
                                make the difference between a
                                coup and a complete flop!

Bamboozler -     5bp            Enables you to infect up to five
                                messages in any one day with
                                'Bamboozle magic'.  Each
                                bamboozled message will reduce,
                                or rend inappropriate, a response
                                from any computer simulation.
                                Doesn't affect 'The Handlinger'
                                or 'The Rimmer'.

   TNT 
Registration    20bp            With the registered version of
                                TNT, you're able to quote better,
                                and your individual message
                                length limit it upped to
                                12Kbytes.  Your session limit is
                                also increased so that you can
                                call twice per day!  This
                                power-up lasts the entire game
                                (Unless pinched by by The Dac)

UUENCODER/      3bp             Most useful for sending encoded files
UUDECODER                       to net.friends, and similarly
                                clued up froods. Stops 'The
                                Heppell' dead in it's tracks.
                                Has been rumoured to cause
                                consternation with other
                                simulants too!

Macquarie 
Dictionary      3bp             Stops pedants.  Only useful for
                                newbies, and actively reduces the
                                number of messages that oldbies
                                can post, by 10% per day.

Friend of    10bp               Allows you to get the Sysop to
The Sysop badge.                screen your messages for a single
                                day, and avoids unpleasant
                                confrontations - you get to
                                decide which messages you won't
                                get.  Limited to 10 messages in
                                any one day, and only has a 1/3rd
                                chance of working when invoked.

Dupechecker     10bp            Excellent for when the
                                MessageMonster comes to town.
                                Can cut the MM down to size in a
                                single day.  Once used against
                                the MessageMonster, it is
                                rendered useless.


Zen Mysticism  100bp            Allows you to see the stats of up
                                to ten players in a single mail
                                session.  Check out their
                                net.friends, net.enemies, sanity
                                points, bonus points, addons, and
                                their current message stats.
                                Reusable until revoked.  This is
                                a very useful item, and almost
                                compulsory to win the game!

Capricious       5bp            Cancel someone elses message.
Cancellation                    Can only be used once, and the
                                message writer is informed that
                                their message was destroyed.
                                (But not who did it!)
                                Cannot be used to destroy any of
                                the standard LTUAE simulations
                                messages, but can destroy
                                messages addressed TO those
                                simulations.  Excellent value for
                                money.

Chicanery Star   5bp            Send a message as another user to
                                any other user!  Other players
                                cannot detect any difference
                                between your forgery and the real
                                thing - but the computer LTUAE
                                simulations aren't fooled by
                                these messages.  Excellent for
                                stirring up a dull game, or
                                getting your own back after
                                middling defeats in energetic
                                arguments.

6 Pack of       12bp            These are phantom players who are
Coruscating                     designed to be complete lamers, whom
Newbies!                        you, with your inner knowledge,
                                can set up, and slaughter without
                                fear of retribution.  Just the
                                thing for building up your
                                echo-presence, and working up to
                                Oldbie status.


14" Rotary       2bp            A spellchecker for those times
Debugger                        when only 'perfect' will do.
                                Single one-shot usage, definitely
                                no refills.

Sensayuma        4bp            Stops 'The Rod' in his tracks.


There is a limit to how many addons and power-ups you can have at
any one time.  This limit is essential random, but you'll know
when the computer sez 'Tshk, too much cheating', and your least
expensive addon/power-up is vaporised.

Saving throws are made with a six sided die.  1-3 means failure
to connect. A four or a five is success, and a six entitles you
to roll again.  The computer has the die [ROLLDIE.COM, in C:\],
and each roll result will be posted echowide for all to see.



                Some notes on the MessageMonster.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Sandy can invoke the MessageMonster, in fact, she invokes it
everyday, whether or not she wants to, and loses 30% of her
incoming mail, and 30% of her outgoing mail.  She can direct the
MessageMonster onto any other player, including other computer
simulations.  The MessageMonster, once sicced upon your computer,
will cause between one and ten days worth of complete havoc.  You
have no control over what the MessageMonster will do, and the
best course of action is to lay low for a while until the Monster
leaves.  A small MSDOS utility program called 'AMISAFE.COM' is
available to inform you if your computer is currently infected.
WARNING, the MessageMonster can, and regularly does, infect
multiple players at the same time!  Watch out you don't pull out
of an alliance due mainly to the antics of the unpredictable
MessageMonster.  Owning a Dupechecker will remove the
bad old MessageMonster in a day, but that day's mail [incoming
and outgoing] is still likely to be affected.  Be prepared.


                Some notes on EmilyPostNews
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
The concept is a direct-rip-off from David Brin's _Earth_.  A
group of hackers concoct a style-daemon which sends reprimanding
messages to posters of ill-formed, or ill-meant messages.  In
LTUAE, EmilyPostNews is weiled by The Val, and causes any
affected player to lose mail posting ability for two turns.


                Acquiring Bonus Points.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write nice fairy-floss messages to 'The Byrne' a lot, and do
things that attract the attention of The Heitman.  Notice the
inbuilt limitation of The Byrne, and the catastrophic affects of
overtaxing the resource - The Dac really does remove all addons,
and that can be a crushing blow to sycophants of The Byrne.

Get stuck into 'The Gerry', it is the one 'enemy' you know you
can trust to do the wrong thing.  Manouver, wheedle, cajole, and
generally hassle the simulation as much as you can.  Thirty
messages from one person is far more effective than a similar
number of messages spread out between many users.  And be wary of
having too many users attacking the Gerry at once - its attention
seeking algorithm will start to strengthen its resolve to
persevere.

If you think you can counter the questions of The Handlinger,
then you may want to challenge it.

Those who attack Spewbabe unprovoked are just looking for
trouble.

Most of the simulations should begin posting within the first 14
days of the game, excepting _The Rod_, but that isn't a great
loss. 

It is rumoured that there is another simulated player in the
game, called the HVG persona.  It's behaviour is largely unknown,
and you would be well advised to sit back and observe, before
rushing into an encounter where you come off second best.

Take special care to note the Statistician's messages; with
judicious application, the figures will prove invaluable to your
quest.  

TWILTUAE and The Solo perform important functions, and should not
be taunted.  Undefined results can occur if these usually benign
simulations are attacked.
