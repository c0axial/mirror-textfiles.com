                     The Illusionist/Mentalist
                        by Nancy McCaskey

Illusionist/mentalists are a subclass of illusionist.  A character
will need a minimum Intelligence of 16, a Dexterity of 16 or
better, and a Charisma of at least 14 to enter this class.
Illusionist/mentalists are exactly like illusionists in regard to
weapons and armor allowed, experience points., etc., except as
noted below:

     1).  Illusionist/mentalist illusions take place in the mind(s)
          of targeted creature(s).  Each spell cast by an
          Illusionist/Mentalist can affect intelligence points
          equal to the I-M's Intelligence score times his/her
          level.  All illusion immunities due to very high
          intelligence apply; wisdom saving throw bonuses also
          apply.  A Mind Blank or similar psionic defense mode
          allows 2 saving throws vs. an I-M spell; if either save
          is made, the spell has no effect on that creature.
     2).  Illusionist/Mentalists are allowed to employ magic items
          with psionic abilities--for example, a Medallion of
          E.S.P., a Helm of Telepathy, a Crystal Ball with
          Clairvoyance, Ioun Stones, etc.

Explanation/description:  This spell allows the
illusionist/mentalist to determine the following for all creatures

time:  3 roundsDurati
larger than 1' by 1'~

Explanation/description:  This spell allows the Illusionist-
Mentalist to project his/her thoughts (especially images) into a
specially prepared mirror.  The images will have no sound, but are
useful in describing places and people the I-M has seen.

UPLINK:

Level:    2~Components:    SRange:    6"~Casting time:  1
segmentDuration: 1 rd

Explanation/description:  When used in conjunction with a
Phantasmal Force of some type, this spell allows the victim's mind
to subconsciously direct the illusion, freeing the I-M to do other
things.  The victim will save vs. Uplink first; if (s)he fails,
(s)he will save vs. the Phantasmal Force at -2.  If the victim
successfully saves vs. Uplink, the Phantasmal Force will be normal
and under the Illusionist-Mentalist's control.  A Mind Blank or
other psionic defense will successfully block an Uplink spell.

FAINT:

Level:    2~Components:    V, S, MRange:    6"~Casting
time:  3 segmentsDuratio

Explanation/description:  A creature that fails its saving throw
will lose consciousness for d6 rounds.  No means will revive the
victim until the spell expires.  The material component is a vial
of smelling salts, which is broken as part of the casting.

THIRD LEVEL

Infravision as 3rd level magic-user.


ALTER OTHER:

Level:    3~Components:    specialRange:    Touch~Casting
time:  specialDuratio
willing participants do not need to save
   Area of effect:  1 creature~

Explanation/description:  This spell allows the I-M to permanently
polymorph another, within species limits.  Hair, eye, and skin
color can be outside such limits.  The I-M could, for example,
change a short person into a tall one, a blonde into a brunette, or
a homely person into an attractive one (the Comeliness score, if
used, would be altered).  It can remove the outer signs (but not
the diseases or disabilities) of old age.  It will not cure wounds
or regenerate any body parts other than hair, but it will remove
scars from previously-healed wounds.  The I-M must cast a
Phantasmal Force showing how (s)he wants the recipient to look
before proceeding with Alter Other.  This spell was developed as a
money-maker, since nobles (particularly noble ladies) want to be as
attractive as possible.  System Shock roll vs. this spell are at
+20%.  The typical fee for an Alter Other is 1,000 gold
pieces/caster's level.

DUPLICATE MINOR DISCIPLINE:

Level:    3~Components:    V, S, MRange:    6"~Casting
time:  3 roundsDuration:

Explanation/description:  This spell allows the I-M to duplicate
the effects of a minor psionic discipline.  Duration, saving
throws, and area of effect will be identical to the discipline
chosen.  The discipline to be duplicated must be selected at the
time the spell is memorized; level of mastery is equivalent to 1/3
of the I-M's level, rounded down and subject to normal maximums.
No more than four of these spells may be taken per day.

GHOST:

Explanation/description:  This spell creates a semitransparent
illusion, complete with clanking chains, groans, etc.  Since this
illusion exists only in the victims' minds, the Ghost will seem to
pursue them until the spell duration expires.  Targets who fail
their saving throw will believe they've aged 10 years; those who
save successfully will still "see" the illusion, even though they
disbelieve it.  a Ghost spell projects mild fear.  The material
component is a bit of marble from a tombstone.

recent one cast on a creature will be the one in effect.  It can be
used on the self.

is completely drained of all psionic points.  This spell cannot be
used on the caster.  The reverse, Psionic Devastation, will drain
10 points per level and may actually reduce the target to negative
psionic points.
