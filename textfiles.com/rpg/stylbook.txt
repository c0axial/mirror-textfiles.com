                  Rules Modifications For Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0.
                                   Draft II

         INTRODUCTION-------------------------------------------------
         by Edward Webb

              "There's a rule for negotiations called Ninety-Ninety.  
         The first ninety percent of the deal takes ninety percent of 
         the time, and the last ten percent takes ninety percent."
                                                        - Rogue Trader

              Cyberpunk.  It's not just a game, it's an adventure.  
         Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. improved a great many flaws from the 
         original version, but some inconsistances still crept in.  
         This suppliment covers the "house" rules from our Cyberpunk 
         campaign in one manual; easy to read, fun to devour, and 
         equally servicably as training papers for the puppy.  Some 
         rules are ours, and some are from other Cyberpunk gamers who 
         want to make the world a better place with new rules.
              For your added reading pleasure are a handful of quotes 
         from our campaign.  Cyberpunk can be a very humorous game, 
         when looked at correctly...
              Don your mirrorshades, load your Minimai, and enjoy this 
         entirely unofficial rules suppliment!

         CHARACTER POINTS---------------------------------------------
         Edward Webb and Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. rulebook

              "Never fuck with anything more than twice your size."
                                                          - Jake Starr

              On page 15 of the Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. rulebook you will 
         find a few methods of determining character point totals.  
         Cyberpunk is a rough, nasty game, and I personally have felt 
         that the PC's should be just as rough and nasty to handle it.  
         Sure, people die in Cyberpunk, but most should die from 
         stupidity, not bad dice rolls.  I have found in my four years 
         of running Cyberpunk that 75 points is good to make an above- 
         average character, but it will keep players from becoming 
         power-gods.
              Thus, the Style Rule for Character Points: All player 
         characters will be based on 75 point totals.  Other GM's may 
         differ, but this makes all characters more-or-less equal to 
         start.  It's your call.


         LUCK---------------------------------------------------------
         Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. rulebook

              "My forged corporate pass is fracked, my Avante's been 
         pissed on, and I'm stuck half-naked in a Nomad drifter with a 
         hysterical woman.  Isn't life grand?"
                                                        - Rogue Trader

              One important stat that many Cyberpunk players and GM's 
         alike forget about... Luck.  This is not so much a rules 
         modification as a re-iteration.  From "Statistics", pg. 16 of 
         the 2.0.2.0. rulebook:
              "Your luck represents how many points you may use each 
         game to influence the outcome of a critical event.  To use 
         Luck, you may add any or all of the points of luck a 
         character has to a critical die roll (declaring your 
         intention to use Luck *before* the roll is made) until all of 
         your Luck stat is used up.  Luck is always restored at the 
         end of each game session."


         MONEY--------------------------------------------------------
         Jeff Vogan and Edward Webb

              "How much for this one?"
              "Two hundred."
              "You gotta be kidding me!  I brought 'im here in one 
         piece!"
              "Yeah, but arms and legs would be nice..."
                                            - Conversation at bodybank

              Money.... the green paper that makes the world go 
         'round.  The starting money in Cyberpunk seems a little slim 
         for being a character's life savings, and we ALL need a bit 
         of extra spending money, right?  To reflect a character's 
         ability to save money, and not just give players large 
         amounts of money by increasing the number of months they 
         worked, try this formula:

                       (INT + COOL) / 4 x Monthly Salary

              This will give more money to characters with enough 
         smarts and willpower o save up, while those who aren't will 
         have a bit less....  (Editor's Note:  The beauty of the 
         system is, since stats cannot be below 2, the absolute LOWEST 
         amount of money a character can have is one month's salary, 
         reflecting that month's pay sitting in his hand as he decides 
         where to spend it at!)


         COOL AND STAT ROLLS------------------------------------------
         Kevin Csubak and Edward Webb

              "Rowan, calm down.  Rowan.... calm down....  SHUT UP 
         ROWAN!"
                                                - Said by nearly every
                                                  one of our PCs at
                                                  one time or another

              Page 31, "Giving it your Best Shot", explains briefly 
         about the concept of using a Stat solely in a roll, but it 
         leans more towards an attitude of "what-to-do-when-you-need-
         to-pick-that-lock-but-you-don't-have-a-Pick-Lock-skill".  
         What if you need to keep your Cool?  What if you want to know 
         if someone can remember the capital of Puerto Rico?  You need 
         to make a roll AGAINST your Stat, not WITH it.
              Thus the Stylebook has come up with Stat Rolls (clever 
         name, huh?).  If you wish to make a check against a 
         character's stat, roll a D10, add the Stat, and try to beat a 
         10.  The rule of 1 and 10 still apply.
              Example: Rowan is trying to keep her Cool whilst being 
         taunted about her 4'11" frame by Blood Razors.  Blowing up at 
         a boostergang is BAD, so Rowan must try to remain cool.  She 
         has a Cool stat of 2 (good luck), and rolls a 7. 2+7=9, and 
         she starts cussing out the heavily cybered gentlemen.  (See 
         above quote for the other PC's responses...)
              If Rowan had rolled a 10, she would have easily beated 
         her quota, but she gets to roll again (2.0.2.0., pg. 32, 
         "Critical Success") to she just how cool she really was.
              This system was changed from our original one of rolling 
         BELOW your Stat, because the Rule of 1 and 10 was out, and 
         anyone with a 10+ Stat automatically succeeded and 1- 
         automatically failed.  This way, there is always SOME success 
         or failure....
              Style Rule on Stat Rolls (a.k.a. The Rowan Rule) - Roll 
         a D10 and add your applicable Stat (Target Number 10) to test 
         against your Stats.


         PICKUP SKILL POINTS------------------------------------------
         Jeff Vogan and Edward Webb

              "Knock yourself out."
              "Yaa....okay!" (Pow!... thud)
                                         - Mok taking Babette's orders
                                           a little too literally

              One of the strange things about pickup skills is that 
         there's no accounting for the wisdom of age.  If you've been 
         kicking around for 16+2D6 years, you're bound to learn 
         something.  Thus are two new formulas for calculating Pickup 
         Skill points; choose which one you like.

               REF + INT + Number of years in Lifepath after 16
                                      or
                  2D6 + Number of years in Lifepath after 16

              Either one of these formulas gives a little more account 
         for The School Of Hard Knocks: Life.  Style Rule on Pickup 
         Skills: Age has it's privledges.


         NEW ROLES----------------------------------------------------
         Edward Webb and When Gravity Fails Sourcebook

         WRITE UP NEW ROLES, BUD!  Stripper is one


         REPUTATION AND REP-------------------------------------------
         Jeff Vogan, Edward Webb, and Kevin Csubak

              "There are certain words and phrases you do not use 
         around Jake.  `Columbian Drug Runner' is one of them."
                                                        - Rogue Trader

              Rep.  Biz.  The Word.  On the Street, you're nothing if 
         noone knows who you are and what you've done.  Your Rep can 
         frequently make you or break you, as can a lack of it.  But, 
         like it or not, your Rep is always changing.  One day, you're 
         top dog, and the next you're eating kibble next to the Night 
         City Pound.  A C-Punk's Rep is his life.
              Pgs. 44-45 ("Reputation") in 2.0.2.0. explains 
         Reputation roughly, but reflects little game usage.  Thus, a 
         new kind of experience, REP, has been created.
              Starting REP is figured as Your Special Ability Score 
         times 5.  This is a percentage score of people who know of 
         you.  So instead of rolling Reputation or less on a D10, you 
         roll REP or less on a D100 to see if any character has heard 
         of you.
              But how well does this character know you?  Compare your 
         roll to the REP:

              ROLL MADE BY                     RESULTS
              Failed Roll         "Never heard of 'im.  Get outta my
                                   face!"
                00 - 05           Character has heard the name.
                06 - 10           He knows a bit about what you've
                                   done.  GM call as to what he's
                                   heard.
                11 - 20           He knows quite a bit of what you've
                                   done, and even knows a bit about
                                   you.
                21 - 30           He's been keeping up with you, and
                                   knows as much as anyone could
                                   reading the Screamsheets and
                                   researching.
                31 - 40           He has access to private/personal
                                   information about you.
                  41+             "We know all about you, Mr. Bond..."

              MODIFY ROLL BY                     REASON
                   +5             Same Role
                   +5             PC is Rockerboy or Media
                   +5             Character is Media or Netrunner
                   -5             PC/Character is new to area
                   -5             PC recently biosculpted
               -Roll made by      Successful Disguise Roll
                  +-??            GM's decision

              Now what about facedowns (pg. 45, 2.0.2.0. Rulebook)?  
         The original formula was: 1D10 + COOL + REPUTATION, highest 
         roller wins.  The implimentation is the same, except the roll 
         is now:

          1D10 + COOL + (REP / 10, rounded down), highest roller wins

              The GM assigns REP points like he would IP.  A 
         reccommended system is 1/10 of the IP awarded goes to REP, 
         rounded down.

              So, Style Rule on Reputation: REP replaces Reputation.  
         It is 5x your Special ability at start, rolled as a 
         percentage.  You are awarded and docked REP similarly to IP.


         NPC REACTIONS------------------------------------------------
         Edward Webb and Night's Edge Sourcebook

              "Does Jake take bad news well?"
              "Oh yeah, about as well as a monkey to a braindance.  
         Albeit, the reactions are very similar."
                                                 - Alt and R.I.P.roar

              The flip side of Reputation is how well other people 
         react to you.  Having a 75 REP is useless if the Cyberpsycho 
         in front of you still wants to tear your head off.  So here 
         is a reprint of the Reactions Table from Night's Edge, with a 
         few modifications of our own:

              Roll on the table below for reaction results upon the 
         first encounter between any character and NPC, with the 
         modifiers below influencing the reaction.

                                REACTIONS TABLE

         Roll  Results
         ----- -------
         01-05 Blind Hatred: The NPC hated the character and will act
               in the worst possible way.  No cooperation is possible.
               Will attack if possible.

         06-15 Hatred: The NPC hates the character and may betray the
               character if possible.  80% chance of attacking if
               possible.

         16-24 Strong Dislike: The NPC may act against the character
               if profitable, but otherwise will ignore the character.
               30% chance of attack if possible.

         25-35 Dislike: The NPC is not impressed, but may help the
               character if profitable.  However, if possible, he may
               betry the character.

         36-69 Neutral: The NPC doesn't really care ne way or the
               other.  Basically uninterested.  May or may not help.

         70-80 Like: The NPC is a little impressed by he character
               and may help if not too difficult.  Probably won't
               betray the character.

         81-95 Strong Like: The NPC really likes the character and
               will try to help as much as possible within reason.  He
               will be very loyal.

         96-00 Love: The NPC, if opposite sex, will fall in love with
               the character.  If same sex, will strongly like the
               character.  In either case, the NPC will do practically
               anything for the character.

                               REACION MODIFIERS
         -20%...........................In combat situation
         +5%............................Character seems very powerful

         +5%............................Per 1 Character's ATT > 8
         -5%............................Per 1 Character's ATT < 4
         +5%............................NPC is opposite sex

              "Can I bring my frags?"
              "What is there about NO that you don't understand?"
                            - Lt. Lucas "Mutt" Micro K9 LEDiv and Jake

              Page 101 of the 2.0.2.0. Rulebook discusses explosives.  
         The Stylebook offers an explination of how to apply damage.
              Replace the last sentence starting with "Damage is 
         applied..." with the following:
              "Damage is applied to each body part individually.  The
         damage rolled is divided by 6 and added against each body 
         part, accounting for armor and BTM."
              Example: Babette Desade gets caught in a massive 
         explosion.  The total damage is 30.  She divides it by 5 
         (30/5=6), and applies it to each body part.  She has 18 
         points of SP covering everything except her head, which is 
         unprotected.  So she takes 12 points of damage to the head 
         (remember double damage), and promptly drops to the edge of 
         CRITICAL.
              Style Rule on explosives: Total damage from explosives 
         divided by 6, applied to each body part.

              Also, here's a new explosive for ya:

              THERMAL NITRO-NINE (N9): Comes in 16 oz. units, usually 
         made in labs and put into aerosol cans.  Each unit does 15D10 
         damage.  Street value is $2000 per unit.  Takes a CHEMISTY 
         roll of 30 to concoct in a lab.  Note that N9 is extremely
         unstable...

              Question: What's a Cyberpunk game with more drugs?
              Answer: Ask Chemtech Inc.

              Cyberpunk is violent.  Cyberpunk is sexy.  Cyberpunk is 
         Rock.  But Cyberpunk is, more than anything, escapism.  And 
         what better way to escape than drugs?  They're cheap, common, 
         and maybe even safe (if you believe the corps).  In this 
         section we cover new drugs and new drug rules.
              (Editor Note: We at Monday Night Gaming do not advocate 
         drug use in any way, shape, or form.... because we've found 
         out how badly they fuck up our characters, so we don't wanna 
         know what they will do to us....)

              First, the new highs:

         TRI-PHETS
         Type: Stimulant
         Strength: +1
         Difficulty: 40
         Duration: 1D6+1 hours
         Cost: 1000
              Blue, triangular tablets of Triphetamine.  This drug 
         increases COOL by 1 as well as filling the user with 
         incredible energy, giving him a bonus on all Endurance 
         checks.  Physiologically addictive, this drug can cause 
         severe nausea and vomiting.  It carries with it the side 
         effect of Negative Physical Reaction (see below).

         RPM
         Type: Hallucinogen
         Strength: +3
         Difficulty: 4
         Duration: 1D6+1 minutes
         Cost: 100
              RPM stands for I. ribopropylmethionine.  This drug 
         usually comes in a small, square, plastic derm.  It can be 
         applied anywhere on the skin.  Few people willingly take this 
         drug; it creates horrifying hallucinations which get steadily 
         worse for duration.  Not only that, but with every use the 
         drug gradually burns out the user's central nervous system.  
         For every use roll a D10.  On a 1 the user loses 1 point of 
         REF permanently.


         ROLE MODIFICATIONS-------------------------------------------
         Jeff Vogan and Kevin Csubak

              "Scuba... How intreging!"
              "Doc, those chips take three days to learn, and we've 
         only got two hours."
              "Ah, but you see, I am a very quick learner."
                             - Dr. Simon "R.I.P.roar" Belfast and Jake

              So your Solo wants to learn how to Rock, eh?  Or your 
         Cop wants to run the Net?  Can't do it because your Special 
         Ability won't let you?  Now you can.
              First, look at the skill package for the Special Ability 
         you want.  Got it?  Good.  You have to buy up four of those 
         skills at +3 before you can put points into the Special 
         Ability (180 IPs!), and then, if that wasn't bad enough, you 
         have to buy the Special Ability as if it were a skill with an 
         IP multiplier of 2!
              Let's give an example, shall we?  Jake Starr is a Solo.  
         Just a Solo.  But now Jake wants to play the guitar and 
         become a Rockerboy.  So he decides to buy Play Instrument at 
         +3, Wardrobe & Style at +3, and Perform at +3.  (He already 
         has Awareness/Notice at +7).  After spending all those IPs, 
         Jake spends a final 20 points to buy Charismatic Leadership 
         at +1, and he's on his way!
              Hey, choomba, nobody said that gaining a new special 
         ability was going to be EASY...


         NEW GANGS----------------------------------------------------
         Edward Webb and Kevin Csubak

              "Lemme light that cigarette for ya..." (Flamethrower 
         ignites)
                                    - Mutt interrogating a Blood Razor

              I was overcome with joy when the ideas of doing a little 
         of "nastyboys" creation.  Gangs are a part of punk and these 
         guys aren't supposed to be the type of people you throw out 
         as cannon fodder at various intervals.  Gangs RULE territory 
         and take what they want, so don't send them whimpering into 
         combat like clay pigeons on Smash.

              Gangs are at least slighty organized and they always try 
         to claim superiority.  These following streetwise Punks 
         should give your PC's headaches and/or nightmares.

              ROADKILL:
              Territory: Highways
              History:  During the year 1994, a large criminal element 
         took to the road for fun and profit.  Most of them were 
         Biker's with a really twisted view on life and all they 
         basically did was minor muggings, car & motorcycle jackings, 
         and an occasionally assault or homicide, but the highway 
         patrols kept them under wraps until the declaration of 
         martial law in the United States a year later, and the lack 
         of foodstuffs being produced.  Even then the gang called "The 
         Brotherhood of the Road" was inneffectual until 1998 when the 
         escaped cannibalistic killer John McConnell took over the 
         reigns of the boosters after an "extremely messy" encounter 
         with them.  Due to his extremely tall, thin but incredibly 
         strong frame they called him "Troll."  They staked a claim on 
         a canyon area they called "HellHole" and that remains their 
         base of operations to this day due to its inaccessibility 
         from large or airborne vehicles.  Every member owns at least 
         one cycle with extremely good knowledge of motorcycle 
         mechanics and are "rumored" to be cannibals.
              TROLL
              Type:Solo
              Int: 9  Ref: 12  Body: 12  Tech: 8

              BuzzHand {2d6+3/turn}, interchangable shoulder mount

         SEX IN CYBERPUNK---------------------------------------------
         Jeff Vogan, Kevin Csubak, and Edward Webb

              "What the hell happened?"
              "I just made love to you."
              "Is that why I feel so shitty?"
                                                      - Rowan and Jake

              Sex is fun.  Sex is deadly.  Sex is a good way of 
         getting information or a way of screwing up your character 
         for life.  So of course it's Cyberpunk.
              Here are some rules and GM tips on how to handle 
         fornication.
              NUMBER ONE: Unless you are a really perverse or lonely 
         player, you really do not need to go into details.  If your 
         players do NOT know what you mean, they should go back to the 
         game with the happy elves and sunshine...
              The actual parlay between two characters can really add 
         to a gaming session and to characterization, but there's no 
         reason to "act out" or roleplay or elaborate at great length 
         (unless you want a three hour session by Doctor Ruth).
              NUMBER TWO: Well, since it's bound to happen...  For 
         actual game results and characterization (and possible comic 
         relief), here are a few suggestions of stats and skills for 
         that Big Moment... 

         "Performance":

              This will be the most useless part of this section, but 
         we're doing it anyways... Applicable stats & skills would be:

                       (APP + EMP / 2) + Seduction + D10

              The higher you roll the better you were!

                              PERFORMANCE RESULTS
         Roll  Result
         ----- ------
         0-4   ZZZZZZZzzzzzzz ...
         5-9   That's the wrong hole!
         10-14 It was OK.
         15-19 Mmmm... That was nice.
         20-24 Wow!  I didn't know you could do *that*!
         25-29 O God!... O God!!... O God!!!
          30+  Did you feel the earth move, too?

         Modifiers:
              Virgin: -5
              Mr. Studd/Midnight Lady Sexual Implant: +1
              Common Sexal "Tastes": +1 to +5
              Had This Partner Before: +Number of Encounters up to 5

         CONCLUSION---------------------------------------------------
         Edward Webb

              Before we get sued, I'd better do some explaining:
              No, this is NOT an official R. Talsorian suppliment, nor 
         do we pretend to be.  This is a fan-produced suppliment for 
         other Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. gamers.  We did not ask permission 
         to reproduce any part of the mentioned gaming suppliments.  
         They were added for clarity, to illustrate a point, or 
         because they were particularly useful.
              Why no new skills or 'wares?  In draft one of the 
         Stylebook, there was.  But then I thought, "Do I *really* 
         want to write Chromebook III?  And aren't there enough skills 
         in the world to have to create more?" I said no, and left it 
         at that.  But the new roles were ones I thought you all would 
         like to incorporate.  One (the Stripper class) was supposed 
         to be in When Gravity Fails, but somehow got mysteriously 
         deleted, so I pieced it together from clues in the sourcebook 
         and added a few patches to present it as a role.  So in a way 
         I *did* add a few more skills... silly me.
              After a great debate, I left out the Interface magazine 
         article about Split Roles.  That, in combination with my 
         special ability purchasing rules, made REALLY powerful 
         characters after a while.  It's got to be one or the other.  
         If you know what article I mean, do yourself and your GM a 
         favour, and don't even try to play a Solo/Corporate with 
         Authority (Cop).  I will personally shoot you if you do.  
         (Hehehehehehehe...)
              I also trimmed the quotes a bit.  When I realized that 
         the quotes were taking up half of the bloody Stylebook, I 
         *knew* something had to go...

              Now comes the big question: Why?  Why have I spent 
         almost a year of my time compiling, editing, and re-editing 
         this thing?
              Because I love Cyberpunk.
              I always will.
              But it has a FEW flaws and is a bit weak in areas and a 
         tad disorganized in others.  This is my contribution to the 
         game I love.  I guess that writing rules for Cyberpunk comes 
         naturally to me after I wrote "house" rules patches for the 
         original Cyberpunk 2013 (and boy were there a LOT of patches 
         to be made to that!).  So, in a way, the Stylebook was 
         started way back when I wrote the rules for Sledgehammer, a 
         program that I thought needed to be covered in Cyberpunk 
         2013's Netrunner.
              That was in 1988, two weeks after the game was released.  
         Five years later, I sit here in the glow of my computer 
         monitor, typing the conclusion to the Stylebook.  How time 
         flies.
              Cyberpunk, and R. Talsorian, has been with me for five 
         years now.  Hopefully they'll be with me for five more, when 
         Colorado Springs gets the Rock.
              And just remember this: Cyberpunk 2013 talked aboutthe 
         corruption of mid 90's corporations before the BCCI scandal 
         ever happened.  Maybe that's why I love Cyberpunk.  It's so 
         close to our potential reality that it almost hurts.  Almost.
