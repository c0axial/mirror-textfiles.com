+------------------------------------------------------------------+

This spell system is based on Spell Points system. The attributes in AD&D
presently have only a minute bearing on magical ability. Also the present
systems leave lower level magicians weak and near useless. The lower levels
should be useful in helping to define a character. I have this system presently
set up so that a DM can meet the Magic-Users, Druids, Clerics, whatever...and
take them through a brief apprenticeship so that they will be more in touch
with the magic system and how it works(it is really simple). This apprenticeship
is optional though, it is just added so that the characters gain a little more
"flavor." Actually, all these rules are optional. I tested them successfully
and this is the latest version, and seems to work the best. It also permits a
logic behind your magical experimentation. So, without further a due. Here is
my system of magic. Hope you find that it speeds up your games as much as it
has mine. :)

                        N E W   A T T R I B U T E S

       This spell system uses a few new attributes for characters. I will
name them, describe how they are calculated, and explain their usage.

MAX SPELL POINTS(MSP):
 Calculated by adding Intelligence, Constitution and 5 times the level of
magic use. Intelligence is needed to retain the rules of manipulating such
energies. Constitution represents the life-force and endurance of the body.
This is needed to indicate how much energy can be retained. You may want to
create your own calculation that brings Wisdom into play also.

RATE of REGAINING SPELL POINTS(RRSP):
  This value represents the number of spell points the caster will get back
in a day without actively attempting to regain spell points. There are other
methods which require the caster's concentration that will enable a person to
gain spell points back more rapidly.
  This value is calculated as one half Constitution added to Level of Magic
Use. Thus, a caster with a Constitution of 10 at 5th level would regain
5 + 5 = 10 Spell Points per day. This is important. The Spell Points are the
only thing that govern how a person can cast spells, and how many.

WILL FORCE(WF):
  This value represents how much force of will the character has. All creatures
have a will force. It is calculated by adding Level, Wisdom, and Charisma.
This value is used when a caster attempts to do something that requires the
over-powering of another being's mind. Example would be a demonologist summoning
a demon and attempting to bend that demon to his will.

EQUATIONS:

MSP = Intelligence + Constitution + (5 * level of Magic Use)

  NOTE: Level of magic use applies to EXPERIENCE level as Magic-User, 
        Cleric, Druid, etc. It does not apply to fighter and non-magic
        related EXPERIENCE levels.

RRSP = (Constitution / 2) + level of magic use

WF = Wisdom + Charisma + Level(Hit Dice)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT MOTIVATED USING A SPELL POINT SYSTEM:
  The major thing was the weakness of low level magic-users. Low level magic-
users should not be weak, but they should be more likely dangerous to themselves
because they do not know the system as well. 
  I have studied many texts in the "Real World" concerning ancient magical
rites, runes, rituals, languages, etc. It runs in my family. In none of these
systems does some mystical force wipe the spell from your head after you have
cast it. I think this is a pretty stupid representation of magic. This is an
opinion, because I am aware some people like the present system. Instead I
propose this.
  The spell point system should be treated as representing how tired and
exhausted a person becomes as they cast more. The spells themselves are never
forgotten, though if they are not practiced in a certain amount of time, the
caster may have to go study them again. The higher the level of the spell the
more time it takes to learn a spell, and likewise the time for relearning
the parts that may be forgotten increases. The magic-user knows the spells
like a Physicist knows his formulae. The magic-user can cast any spells which
he has practiced in a recent time, as long as he has the spell points to
cast it. The caster may also opt. to over-cast, but then the stakes get high,
and life becomes a dangerous thing.
  Using spell points also makes a whole range of new spells, traps, and
magic items available, that would not be viable in campaigns with other spell
systems.

LEARNING TIME, LOSING TIME, and SPELL POINT COST:
 These are things that should be computed on studying a spell.
 I will also throw in a spell level type that you can use if you like. It is
used by a friend of mine, so in order to make sure all views are represented
I present you with the spell level MINOR, which falls between Cantrips and
1st level. It was developed by David Gery.

CANTRIPS:
 Learning Time: 1 Day     LOSING TIME: 4 months      Spell Point Cost: 1
MINORS:
 Learning Time: 3 Days    LOSING TIME: 4 months      Spell Point Cost: 2 or 3
LEVEL SPELLS:
 Learning Time: 1 week * Spell Level (5th level = 5 weeks)
 LOSING TIME: 4 months - 2 weeks/level  (6th level = 4 - 3 weeks or approximate
                                              3 months and 1 week)
 Spell Point Cost: 5 * Spell Level (4th level = 20 spell points)


LEARNING TIME is how long it takes to learn the spell.
LOSING TIME is how long you can go without using the spell before you have
  to relearn it. If you use the spell before this time then it is considered
  as if you have practiced your spell, thus you get the same LOSING TIME
  as if you had just learned the spell.
SPELL POINT COST: this enables 1st level mages to cast higher level spells
  than normal, they are just limited to how many times they can do this, and
  how long it takes them to get enough spell points back to do so again.

HOW DO CLERICS FIT IN?:
  I see the gods as beings of power. When a person/entity believes in you,
then that is all the more energy a god has. I say for each worshipper of a
diety they probably receive around .5 -> 1 spell point. Thus, a god with
millions of worshippers would be strong indeed. Mainly, I see the gods as
planting the instructions for clerical spell casting within the cleric's
head. It is up to the god on how many spells he gives and which ones the
cleric recieves. In special circumstances you may want to consider if the
god will grant a cleric bonus spell points. This may be a common thing for
clerics of high power who worship a mighty deity. This, is entirely up to
you, but I think you can think of ample ways to do this.

WHAT ABOUT DRUIDS?:
  I view druids more of a magic-user class than a cleric/priest class. Afterall
they worship nature and the balance of thing. Therefor they will not worship or
affiliate themselves with a deity. Doing so would shift the balance. I view them
as specialized magic-users who specialize in nature spells and divination. This
is my system to be sure, but research the druids and you might see that this
is closer to how they actually were. Actually, the majority of druids in history
knew or practiced no magic at all. They were statesmen, and high ranking figures
in soceity. The magical druids were called Uathis What you do is entirely your
own decision, the main thing is that your players enjoy themselves. I have
noticed that the more realistic you can make it seem, and the more you can give
the player the BEING THERE feeling, then the more fun and interesting it will
be for everyone concerned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      DEITIES & HOLIDAYS, POWER TIMES:
                      ================================

DEITIES:
--------
   Deities exist due to the vast amount of energy that goes to them. Some are
so ancient noone remembers how they got there. Other times a deity may be born
due to the vast amount of energy accumulating. A deity gains its powers from its
believers. Every worshipper who spends a day or more worshipping a diety causes
.5 -> 1 spell point to gather in an accumulative energy bank about the deity.
The deity cannot tap this energy until it enters his being. This is what happens
on holidays.
   The deity has several powers that can be used if he has sufficient power
available to do so. These will be explained in Table V. 
   The deity can grant spell points to a cleric that worships him/her/it. The
choice of who will receive these points usually goes to the high ranking. The
diety is also responsible for revealing how a spell works to his followers.

HOLIDAYS:
---------
   On holidays all the power that has been accumulating about a deity suddenly
enters its being and is now available for that deity to use. Thus, on these
special occasions the deity has a vast amount of spell points and usually is
more generous with his/her/its followers. These are the days that a needy cleric
is most likely to recieve spell point aid, and/or new spells.

POWER TIMES:
------------
   During some special times power is available to people who are receptive to
these times(ex. Full Moons, High tide, etc.). These are times when backlashes
from all the planes build up in special bundles which can be tapped by things
which are receptive to them. These build ups are the results of conflicts,
excess energy dribbling, or death of deities before they are able to harvest
enough energy to save themselves. 
   NOTE: if a deity dies and then sufficient ENERGY becomes available to be
born again(so to speak) then that diety will return. Though it takes a lot of
energy for a deity to be born.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 FAMILIARS:
                                ============

-Contributed by Jeff @  <WFREEMAN@UA1VM.BITNET>

Under 1st ed. ADND rules(the only system this ain't a-gonna-buy-the-same-books-
I-already-got heretic is familiar(pardon the pun) with), a mage gets to add the
familiar's HP to his own. For purposes of this system, the mage can also add the
spell points of the familiar (i.e. 5xHP) to his own. These can be used the same
way as normal spell points. Yes, this does mean that the mage suffers a loss of
spell points as well as HP when the familiar is killed. (Although an idea I use
and recommend to other GM's is that a restoration spell will fix this). This
only works with the non-special familiars, for the reasons I stated previously.

Optional Ideas:
1)  Those special familiars that add one to the caster's effective level add
    5 spell points.
2)  The mystic bond between familiar and caster allows the caster to heal the
    familiar using spell points as he can himself (perhaps at double normal
    cost?).
3)  Through a ritual requiring the (temporary) expendature of ten times the SP
    the mage gets from the familiar, the link between familiar and magician can
    be safely broken(i.e. no ill effects to the character or familiar).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           S A C R I F I C E:

ONE POSSIBLE WAY TO DEAL WITH SACRIFICE:
	Sacrificing may be viewed as the act of working the spell energy 
out of an object through directed mind intent, and often physical acts.
There are several types of sacrifice. These types being Animate(living),
Inanimate, and self sacrifice. To briefly describe these types...
Animate object sacrifice, is the taking of something of value from a 
living object. Usually it is the objects life, or blood. Sometimes 
however it is a physical characteristic of the object(e.g. Deflowering
the virgin). Now the inanimate object. The inanimate object is usually
something magical, valuable, or of religious signifigance. The object is
usually destroyed, but in some cases is given away(e.g given to clerics
of the diety for which the sacrifice is intended). Self sacrifice is a
different type of sacrifice from the others. It symbolizes giving 
something of yourself to a cause, or purpose. It can be religious in
nature. Here are several examples. Coming of age rituals(circumscision,
piercing, sun dance(hanging by pierced breasts from ropes), etc.), 
energy rituals(a woman gives herself to a man during the hunt on Samhain
(pronounced: Sauwin.), etc. All these rituals are used to aid in the
production of some powerful effect. They are usually personal, or
religious sacrifices. Note, sacrifices can only be done, if they are
within the realm of your alignment.

Animate (Personal):
   Killing the sacrificial victim- target for benefit from sacrifice
     receives a surge of 5 spell points per level of victim. With the
     following modifications and considerations.
     +20 spell points for a baby
     +15 spell points for a virgin    (E V I L  O N L Y)
     +10 spell points for a child(4 -> 14 years of age).
     NOTE: This will sometimes attract the attention of evil creatures 
	of significant power(often the goal of the sacrifice).
   Drinking Blood of a Victim(not neccessarily killing)- Drinker gains 1
     spell point for every 2 spell points of damage inflicted.
   Stealing of a Physical Attribute- Destroying a physical attribute of 
     the victim.
     DEFLOWERING THE VIRGIN(cooperative): 5 spell points to the virgin, 
	and 5 spell points to the person commiting the act.
     DEFLOWERING THE VIRGIN(rape, evil only): 10 spell points to the 
	rapist.
     CASTRATION: 5 spell points to the castrator.(evil only)
     RITUAL SEX: 2 spell points to each participant.
ANIMATE (Religious, in dedication to a diety):
     Killing the victim- 10 spell points go to the diety. The diety will
       most likely respond by granting something to those involved in 
       the sacrifice. Often some dieties will require multiple-
       sacrifices before responding.
     Blood of victim given(not neccessarily killed):- 1 spell point 
       given to diety per 2 hit points of damage. SEE KILLING THE VICTIM.
     DEFLOWERING THE VIRGIN: This only has religious significance if done
       by a high ranking priest. The priest will invite the diety to
       be as one with the priest during the sacrifice(often high powered
       clerics will be possessed by their diety). The Diety is given 8
       spell points, the cleric is given 2, and if the victim was not
       raped...is given 5 spell points.
INANIMATE (Personal): 
    Magical: there is a 5% chance per level of sacrificer that the 
	magical item when sacrificed(destroyed) will give the sacrificer
        10 spell points per(+ of the weapon, 1 potion, 1 scroll, 1 charge, etc.)
        The item will be destroyed, and this chance represents the 
        sacrificers chance of focusing mind intent quickly enough to 
        harvest the freed energies.
    Non-Magical: This is purely an emotional thing.(e.g. the child 
        burning his favorite blanket to show that he is ready to pass
        into adulthood.) This can be important to character development.
        Experience probably should be awarded for such sacrifices.
INANIMATE (Religious):
        The object sacrificed will usually be stored in a treasurey in
        dedication to the diety. However it is not unheard of for the
        diety to personally(or send minions) collect especially valuable
        objects. These sacrifices increase the dieties awareness of the
        minion who sacrificed.
SELF-SACRIFICE (Personal): Also see INANIMATE (Personal).
        Any sacrifice in this vein is usually one to show that you are
        ready for something to happen, or you have learned something and
        are willing to make a sacrifice to further that knowledge. A
        character should probably receive some experience points for 
	making sacrifices.
SELF-SACRIFICE (Religious): 
        This is an act whereby a follower of a religion sacrifices
        something of themselves to show that they are faithful to
        the religion. Sometimes this must be done in certain religions
        before the diety will teach a cleric certain spells. Common
        folk will often sacrifice something of value to themselves in
        the name of religion(e.g. The maiden offering her virginity to
        the diety, the priest swearing to always remain clean shaven,
        the priest being castrated, etc..DM's discretion). The diety
        will often gift the sacrificer for particularly rare sacrifices.
        There should also be some experience awarded.

ALL THIS IS OPTIONAL(DM's use it if you like, or use parts of it...whatever
        you see fit.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         R U N E     M A G I C

RUNE MAGIC: Rune magic is the practice of inscribing symbols onto 
something. These symbols are secrets that are guarded well. The symbols 
are shapes that naturally attract energy and cause it to flow in certain
forms. There are several ways in which rune magic is KNOWN to be used.
These are Rune Yoga, Storage Device creation, wards, seals, magic item 
creation, and runes inscribed in the air. I will briefly explain some
ways in which a DM might handle these types of magic.
RUNE YOGA: Rune yoga is the mental and physical practice of mentally 
picturing a rune while simultaneously standing in a stance 
representative of that rune and making a sound symbolic of that rune. At
first during practice nothing unusual will be noted. This will train
one to manipulate energies better as well as open new sensations to the
practitioner. The DM might optionally want to use this field in his/her
campaign. An idea for how to handle it might be one of the following.
#1.) Allow regaining of spell points at an accelerated rate.
#2.) Give the practitioner a heightened alertness to certain types of 
     unusual activities. (e.g. 5% x level + #hours rune yoga today 
     chance of sensing the fact that something magical is occuring 
     nearby. Or perhaps a chance to feel as though someone was watching
     him/her when they are being scryed.)
#3.) As long as practiced an hour a day...Will Force will be raised
     by 2.
STORAGE DEVICE CREATION: see TABLE IV.
WARDS: Runic Wards represent hours(perhaps days or weeks) of 
concentrated work. A Runic Ward is usually created to prevent something
from being able to pass a certain area. Sometimes they are designed to
do things like alert guardians, explode, etc. The DM should make the
construction of such things a difficult task. Generally the more runes
used...the more powerful the ward. An example of a ward would be
the seal of Soloman, or the magic circle of protection. Here is one
idea for a system of Ward Construction for DM's to use. Feel free to
create your own.
Hit Dice of Creature that it can ward against is directly proportional
to the number of runes in the ward.
Drawing a rune takes a minimum of one hour per rune, and the inscriber
must make an intelligence check to see if the rune was inscribed 
properly. If a rune is inscribed with a flaw, that rune will be inactive.
The Wards will slowly gather energy themselves at a rate of 1 spell 
point per rune...per hour. This magic is very difficult to personally
tap into, because of the nature of attraction of the runes. Also, you
would not want to tap this energy...since that is how the runes work
their effects. The caster can inject the runes with energy to speed
the process up. A rune can hold a maximum of 5 spell points. These
spell points are used to errect the barrier.(See Demonology)
SEALS: These are the same as Wards, but generally smaller. They are used
  to prevent the passing of portal by a certain individual. The runes
  usually will have the truename of the target creature/being inscribed 
  among the runes of the seal.
MAGIC ITEM CREATION: Magic Item creation usually requires the use of at
least one or more runes(See Table IV). Sometimes these runes will not be
visable to the naked eye(though often to a Detect Magic). Every rune 
moves the energy in its own ways. Through years of study a caster can 
learn ways in which these movements can be harnessed to create a magical
effect. The DM's discretion/ideas should be used here.
AIR INSCRIBED RUNES: These runes are usually drawn with a wand, a staff,
a rod, or the casters finger. Every rune has its own way of manipulating
energy. If the caster is immensly familiar with the movements of a rune,
he/she can often use it to make a strange effect. Some ideas for effects
might be an energy vacummn(cyphoning 1 spell point from a given 
direction and giving it to the caster), a gesture that causes a person 
to experience a head rush type sensation as the energy is disturbed in
his/her area, etc. Really, the only limit is your own imagination. 
FINAL NOTES ON RUNES: Runes are a rare thing. People tend to guard them
more avidly then they do spells themselves. They cannot just be copied
from a magic item or ward. They must be inscribed in a certain order
(e.g. left to right, top to bottom, north west to south east, etc.) They
usually have many different direction changes also, so there is no easy
way to copy a rune. Though, you might allow a caster to spend a week or
two trying out all the possible combinations until he/she gets it right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        D E M O N O L O G Y

DEMONOLOGY: This is the practice of summoning/attracting/controlling/banishing
an extra planar being(almost always evil in nature). The caster does 
this usually for reasons motivated by desire for power. They ask 
questions, and/or send the being summoned on tasks. This is an 
incredibly dangerous occupation. The slightest slip up can mean that you
are dead. Sometimes even worse than that.
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: 
Something to attract the being
SUGGESTED REQUIREMENTS:
A ward of some type(will explain simple wards later on)
TrueName of the being
Something belonging to the being
A gift/appeasment for the being
WHY ARE EVIL CONJURATIONS MOST COMMON?: Evil beings love responding to
conjurations. 90% of conjurations result in the conjurer losing 
something(soul, body part, sanity, life, etc.) Evil beings often gain
twhat they consider luxuries through dealing with a foolish 
conjurer/demonologist. Good/other alignments usually do not benefit all
that much from responding to a conjuration.
THE PROCESS:
The demonologist readies whatever precautions can be made. For example,
constructs ward, readies gift, studies TrueName, practices Rune Yoga,
has a defensive scroll ready, steadies nerves, etc. Then the 
demonologist attempts to attract the being. The base chance of 
attracting the being are as follows.
5% * level of caster
if the true name is known the chance increases by 50%
if a gift of blood is made to an evil being +10%
if a human/demi-human sacrifice is made to evil being +20%
if the demonologist has a belonging of the being  +25%

If the caster does not know the true name either/or have a belonging of 
the being trying to summon. A being will just arrive. 80% evil 5% good 
15% neutral.

The first thing to do is this.
Calculate the will force of the creature (Wisdom + HD + Charisma).
Calculate how many Hit Dice the ward will protect against(if you have a 
ward).
Calculate the Caster's will force modifiers:
knows creatures true name +5
has something that belongs to creature +2

Compare the Wards Resistance against the creatures hit dice. If the
Ward has no inperfections and it is stronger than the creature, then the
creature cannot attack the caster. This does not mean that the creature
will cooperate. Though, the creature cannot leave until it is banished,
or uses a gate, astral spell, etc.

If the caster wishes to force compliance/information/task from the 
creature....the caster must force the creature by entering a battle
of the wills(this is a must, if the creature was conjured...and no
wards are present). If the caster has a stronger Will Force then the
creature, then the creature will be under the casters influence for
a number of rounds equal to the casters level. This does not mean the
being will do whatever the caster says. The being will answer basic
questions(often twisting truth to his purpose), and possibly it will
agree to a task if an agreeable compensation is determined(sell your
soul, sacrifice, blood, etc.)
If the casters Will Force is weaker the following chart must be 
consulted.

How much Weaker|  50% Action of evil being    |  50%
==========================================================================
 1 - 2 points  | Demon will flee to home plane| Demon will bargain
 3 - 4 points  | Demon will flee to home plane| Demon will demand a gift
 5 - 8 points  | Demon will attempt to subdue | "                      "
               | the caster as the caster was |
               | attempting to do.            |

               | the caster.                  | can do what it wants.
=========================================================================

DM's use your imagination...and be cunning in your bargaining. The Demon
will always try to get the very most possible. Use guile and 
persuasiveness, even twist the truth some.

SIMPLE WARDS:
Simple wards are wards designed without the aid of runes to assist in
protecting against extra-planar beings.
Ward Type    | against Elementals  | Chaotic Evil | N or L Evil | Good

FALSE MAGIC: Depending on how common powerful magic is in your campaign 
world is, the chance for charlatans...and magicians is always possible. 
These people will practice such things as Slight of Hand, Juggling,
Tumbling, Illusion(through physical means), bluffing, hypnotism,
persuasion, and scandals. They are often good story tellers, and are
often scoundrels that pass through towns briefly and trick people
out of their money. Sometimes they are entertainers. Inn Keepers
tend to prefer this type of entertainment to that of a real magic casting
person, since it is less likely to backfire and also less likely to
frighten/offend the paying customers. These types of people can make
some interesting encounters for your party if you plan them well. It
may also give you DMs another way to lighten the amassed gold that your
characters have acquired. Afterall, you don't want the campaign to be
too easy do you?

WILD MAGIC: Wild Magicians are people who began to inheritantly sense 
the presence of magic in their youth. Through accidents(e.g. during 
intense emotional change) things would happen. Wild Magicians usually
have mastered a few spells, and the rest of the time they just wing it.
They guess and try....this can sometimes produce wonderful effects,
and new spells but, it often backfires. The strength of the spell, or
backfire is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended on
these spells.
You can use(should if you like it) the 2nd edition Wild Magician rules,
but if you keep it simple like these here...it ebnables the DM to be
more creative, and keep hitting the party with things they have never
heard of or read about before.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        T R U E   N A M E S

TRUE NAMES: Everything has a true name, though usually the object of the 
name does not know its true name itself. The true name is recquired for 
some spells, and in some cases it will give you more power.

YOU AND YOUR TRUE NAME: I do not usually reveal the true name of a 
caster to themselves. It is not something to easily come by, since it 
takes lots of study and observation to come by. A caster will usually 
have to come by his true name by obtaining it from someone else. This is
so becaues, a caster will often not see qualities in himself that other
people see. These qualities must be included in the true name. I say 
this...it is 95% likely that the magic user who trains the caster will
know the caster's true name by the end of the training. There are 
several things the teacher might do with that knowledge.
#1) Tell the caster if he/she askes.
#2) Tell the caster that he does not need to know his own true name, 
    because it will be safer that way. Then people will not be able to
    torture it from him/her. Or magically pull it from memories.
#3) Will automatically tell the caster on completion of his/her 
    training.

LEARNING A TRUE NAME:
A true name can be learned in several ways. The easiest is to find 
mention of it in a book or scroll, or have someone tell you. The other 
way is by studying and observing the being for which you wish to gain 
the true name. It takes a minimum of one week to learn a true name.
This is how you work it. 
chance of learning true name =
%50 - (2 x Hit Dice of individual)
-20% if cannot physically observe the individual during that week.
+1% per piece of literature describing aspects of the individual.
+1% per week of study.
You check once a week to see if the caster successfully learns the true 
name.

APPRENTICE GIFT OF TRUE NAMES: I often have the teacher of the caster
during the apprenticeship grant the caster 1 -> 4 true names on 
completion of the training.

MANUFACTURIN MAGIC ITEMS: Ideas on this topic are spread throughout this
paper. See Rune Magic, Table IV, and the Apprenticeship for more 
information. Basically use your imagination and do what works for you.

ALCHEMY: The manufacturing of potions, powders, and chemicals with 
astounding magical properties. I do not plan to say much actually about
how you should go about handling your alchemists. I just want remind
people of a few things that make alchemists important figures in the
FRPG soceity. These are some things you may or may not have considered.
Alchemists are responsible for making things such as Soap, Perfumes, 
Glues, Paints, inks, etc. These are all important things in a town, or
city. Thus, having an alchemist is an important thing to have in a city
to make it more believable. They also manufacture magic potions, but
they should only know how to make a few. They usually know how to make
minor healing potions also.

These can be some very interesting NPCs.
Again a way to relieve your characters of some of their gold.

MINIMUM TRAINING TIME:300 - (2 X Intelligence) days

LESSON #1:  Fundamental Energy Types
------------------------------------
Explain the following to the apprentice.

SPELL POINTS: Spell Points are similar to electricity, but smaller and with
  more attraction. They effect the laws of the planes. They are considered to
  be free floating micro-energies. They have a tendency of attracting other
  energy.

LIFE ENERGY(Hit Points): Life energy is special in that it is a net of
  interlocked spell points. Five spell points make up one hit point. They
  are also surrounded by a containing field of unknown purpose. There are some
  chemicals in your body that effect the configuration of the life energy(DNA).

                               O
                              /|\
                             O-O-O    5 Spell points interlocked into 1
                              \|/     hit point.
                               O

SOLID MATTER(Earth): Matter is a packet of spell points formed into a structure.
  The density, gemetric configuration, and ammount of spell points determine
  the properties of the matter. The bonds formed between spell points are very
  strong.
              O------O
             O+O----O+O     2 matter elements bonded.
              O------O

AIR(Gas): Air elements are geometrically combined linear or planar groupings of
  spell points that can glide past each other. The properties are determined by
  geometry and density.

               O--O
              O  O  O
             /   |   \      <-- 4 Gas elements (Density = low, Geometry = line)
            O    O    O

WATER(Liquid): Water is similar to air, but there are no restrictions to
  geometry. Also similar to matter, but only weak bons exist between the
  elements. Properties are determined by density, geometry, and the number
  of spell points per element.

       O-------O
      /O\     /O\       <--- 2 liquid elements (density = low, Geometry =
     O---O---O---O                              pyramidal, #SP = 4)

FIRE: Fire is a chain reaction process triggered by proper introduction of a
  catalyst element into another energy form. It is a breakdown of energy and
  various effects as it passes from one type of energy to another, or from
  one geometry to another. The common side effects are heat, light(plasma),
  gas(smoke), liquid(melt), and matter(ashes).

PLASMA(light, heat(infared)): Plasma is a spell point traveling at high velocity
  with a field similar to the one found around life energy.
  (DM'S NOTE: some spells will be visable to infravision!! Also Ultravision!)

ELECTRICITY: Electricity is a group of colliding plasma elements. Often a
  strange effect chains plasma together(photon) within a larger field. This
  causes contained collisions which produce electricity.

                          LAWS OF ENERGY:
                          ===============
I.  Energy cannot be destroyed, it can only be transformed.
II. Conversion of standard energy intyo life energy requires 5 spell points to
    produce 1 hit point. Life force can be converted into one standard energy,
    because 4 become plasma in the breaking process. (A person over-casting
    will have a slight glow)
III.Life force is a net which can contain standard energy. Too much energy can
    cause a disruption(see TABLE II- Too much power). Standard energy(Spell
    points) is usually what we tap into during a magical process. Only in
    severe emergencies should the caster attempt to tap the life energies.

THOUGHT(Mind Intent): Thought is the most powerful force in all of the planes.
  With it all forms of energy can be manipulated. Gestures, incantations, etc.
  are just used to focus the mind intent in the proper way. Range of thought
  usually extends only to that which can be seen, or is known really well.
  This reasoning is based on the fact that it is easier to focus on something
  you can see.

LESSONS/TASKS for #1:
=====================
I.   Use Law I. and mind intent to change air temperatures.
     (DM's discression...   2 degree change per spell point?)
II.  Learning
     A. Learn simple telepathy...This enables magic-users to vaguely detect
       when focused mind intent is at work nearby.
     B. Simple telekinesis(prelude to PRESENT and POP-TOSS)
III. Learning law II, by learning healing(it is very taxing for magic-users).
IV.  Learn law III by draining all expendable Spell points(Spell Points=0).
     Then make the apprentice take the test so that they learn and will never
     forget how dangerous it is to over cast.
V.   Teach BLUE LIGHT cantrip.

	Sample of how one might describe the BLUE LIGHT CANTRIP:
        --------------------------------------------------------
    1.) Act as if holding a small sphere in the palm of hand(this will
        help to focus the mind intent).
    2.) Blow into the sphere imagining your breath as a stream of plasma.
    3.) Reinforce mentally that IT IS A SPHERE.
    4.) Move 1 spell point into the sphere to excite the plasma.
    5.) Voila BLUE LIGHT....contained and colliding plasma elements.

VI.  PRESENT CANTRIP:
     Keep practicing telekinesis until it becomes a reflexive thing.

END OF LESSON #1

--------------------------Journeyman Apprentice---------------------------------

MINIMUM TIME:100 - Intelligence Days.
LEVEL: Journeyman Apprentice

LESSON #2: ENERGY TRANSFERANCE:
-------------------------------

Standard Energy(spell points) is easily movable.

LAWS OF TRANSFERANCE:
---------------------
I.   Energy in the non net-work form moves from location to location.
II.  Mind intent can be used to control the movement of energy.
III. A structure can be caused to act as a container for other types of
     energy.

MAGIC LESSONS/TASKS FOR #2:
---------------------------
I.   Learn to detect the rate of flow of spell points through an area.
     Rate of flow = Energy per round.
     Chance of detecting = Rate of flow x 10% + magic use level X 2
     (see TABLE III  - Determining rate of flow)
II.  CHANNEL MAGIC: Learn to give someone else energy and to take energy
     from someone else. MAX RATE OF FLOW = Level of Caster +1 spell point
     per round. If the caster is sucking energy from the environment then
     MAX RATE OF FLOW cannot exceed the environmental rate of flow. NOTES
     of player to player energy exchange. If a person is the unwilling
     victim of energy syphoning(Psychic Vampirism) the person may choose to
     pit his will force against that of the attacker. In such a circumstance
     two things can happen. #1.) the contact will be broken. #2.) The flow
     of energy goes towards the strongest will force. A person can syphon/give
     energy from up to a distance of 1 foot per level of magic use.

END OF LESSON #2

----------------------------Master Apprentice-----------------------------------

MINIMUM TIME:400-(Intelligence X 10) Days
LEVEL: Master Apprentice

LESSON #3: FUNDAMENTAL:
-----------------------
  Many structures tend to gain standard energy pockets over time, especially
  matter and plant life. This energy can be tapped.

MAGIC LESSON/TASK #3:
=====================
  DRAWING RITUAL: This ritual is optional. The wizard who is training the
apprentice must make it known, that this ritual is extremely dangerous and
has a high amount of people who end up either dead, insane, or maimed. If you
wish to attempt this ritual then you will most likely excell beyond the common
mage. If you do not attempt it. You will still make a good living. The choice
is yours.

  LEARNING THE DRAWING RITUAL: By use of mind intent the caster opens a small
access portal to the Negative material plane, and the positive material plane.
Then he/she inserts his/her hands in the portals. This is in effect like turning
yourself into a battery. If the person learns how to do this...he/she can
regain 5 spell points per hour(1 TURN) of performing this ritual. The only time
it is extremely dangerous is on the first attempt. After that, there is a 5%
chance per usage that a Negative Material Plane being will enter the plane of
the caster through the portal.

Chance of success= Intelligence + Constitution + Wisdom%

If failure consult this table

41-50        | Major Insanity sets in....(DM be creative in determining type
             |                            of insanity)
51-70        | Minor Insanity sets in    "                                "
71-90        | Not sure what happened...maybe it will manifest at a later date.
             | (DM think of something that could result. Preferably horrifying)
91+          | No ILL Effects.

This can be attempted more than once.

TABLE IV.   - Magic Storage Devices:
------------------------------------

  These are common alternative magic items in my campaigns. The main thing to
remember is to not make them too powerful. They make it possible for a low level
magic-user to have access to a lot of spell points. So make them rare enough to
where they are just back-up. Another thing. The person must know how to direct
spell points(channel magic) in order to recharge the device.
  The devices usually involve a rune or two. Runes are rare, and the secrets
to runes are guarded more adamantly than spells themselves. Why? Because these
devices require runes most of the time, and each rune on the device must be
different from the others. To find instructions explaining how to make a rune
is a treasure indeed!.

STINGER: Cause 1 point of stinging damaghe to target within 10'

OBSCENITY: Causes target to shout a short obscenity.

POP-TOSS(By David Gery): This is the reverse of present...rather than pulling
                        something to you. You push it away.
CUP SPRAY(By David Gery): This allows you to cause the contents of a cup or jar
                        to spray outwards from you..up to 6' away.
FLAGELATE: Self explanatory *grin*  works well with belch.

CATALYST BOLT:
Level: 3rd                     CASTING TIME: 1 segment
Range: 10' + casters level     Target: 1 target
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The caste fires a green glowing energy bolt at the target. The target must
save vs. magic or be automatically hit. The spell does 2d4 damage.
Each round there after the target must make a saving throw. If the target
makes a saving throw...then the spell ends. If the target fails its saving
throw, takes 1-2 points of green fire damage and loses 5 spell points. This
spell is fueled by the target's own spell points. If the target reached
0 spell points then the spell ends.

HOST OFFERING: (the blackest and most vile evil magic)
Level: 4th                     CASTING TIME: 1 day - (1 hour/ 2 levels of M-U)
Range: Touch                   Target: 1 dead humanoid
Material components: 1 dead humanoid, preferably fresh and without severe
                   body damage. 1 hit point worth of blood from a self inflicted
                   wound.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            The caster approaches the dead body while pronouncing an incantation
to an evil deity. The caster stores 10 spell points in the body. Then the caster
chants some more and promises great destruction in return for the deities help.
Then the caster empties the blood into the mouth of the body. Final the caster
invites an astral entity to inhabit the body. The caster then gives a gift of
5 spell points to the evil deity. The total spell point cost for this spell is
35 spell points. The entity will then inhabit the body, and will have all the
attributes of the host body except for what follows.
Hit Dice: 1  / # of Attacks: 1 / Damage attack: as host / 10 spell point max
STR: hosts  INT: 6  WIS: 6   DEX: hosts   CON: Hosts  CHR:5  COM:hosts
                                                                 -1 per day
WILL FORCE: 12

The entity can cast the following spells:
Stinger(cantrip), Present(cantrip), Obscenity(cantrip), fire finger(cantrip),
and burning hands(1st).
NOTE: The entity will practice psychic vampirism when possible. It can steal
  2 spell points per hour of contact, or 1 spell point per hour if within
  5' of victim.

The host will serve the caster as long as they are given 1 spell point per day.
They automatically use 1 spell point per day to stay alive. They will die
when either they reach 0 hit points, or they reach 0 spell points. They will
also slowly decay.
