Re: THE AVIATOR KIT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Aviator

Description: The Aviator makes his living on flying steeds, and
is a master at aerial combat.  They are modeled after the modern
day flying aces, and have been adapted to work with this game.
     Their main attributes are strength and stamina, so high
strength and constitution are prefered.  Since strength and
stamina are of the essence; he needs at least a 14 in both.  A
high dexterity is also important.

Role: The Aviator is a protector of the skies, and spends most of
his time flying on his steed.  It is the Aviator's duty to try
and find the safest passage for travels, and to help wounded
flying animals.  The Aviator can find jobs such as: guides,
flying guards, and air-combat warrior on ships.

Secondary Skills: If your DM is using secondary skills the
character can select any of the following secondary skills:
Bowyer/Fletcher, Limner/Painter, Navigator, and Teamster/
Freighter; the Aviator may choose anyone of the four.

Weapon Proficiencies: Required: Throwing(axe or dagger), hand
crossbow, javelin, lance, longsword, and the whip.  The Aviator
must become proficient in these weapons before choosing to become
proficient in any other weapon.

Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus nonweapon proficiencies:
Navigation, riding land-based.  Recommended (General): Animal
handling, animal training, direction sense, riding airborne, rope
use, weather sense; (Warrior): Animal lore, blind-fighting,
endurance, survival.

Special Benefits: The Aviator is a master at aerial combat, and
does not suffer any penalties in combat situations will fighting
in the air.  The Aviator recieves a bonus of +1 to hit and to
damage, will in mounted combat.
     The Aviator has the flying ability known as Aeronautics:
This ability gives the Aeronaut increased manueverability, a
steads rating will be increased by 1, while the Aviator is flying
on its back.  Thus a creature with flight class D, will be, will
be increase to flight class C.  Also the character's flying
abilities are so inhanced that he does not need to make a
proficiency check while making aerial manuevers.
      The Aviator receives the thief ability known as Hear
Noises, and their ability is equal to that of a theif of equal
level.

Special Hindrances: The Aviator can not wear armor heavier than
chain, and can not employ shields while in mounted combat.  This
gives them better manueverability, and it does not weigh him or
his steed down.  The Aviator does not recieve the 10 percent
bonus to earned experience.
     The Aviator only recieves a bonus to hit and to his damage
while flying, and he must choose a weapon, from his prefered
weapons list, at first level to gain these bonuses.
     The Aviator must have the nonweapon proficiencies of Riding
airborne, and animal handling at first level so that he may
recieve his Aeronautic ability, and also to keep him from
suffering penalties for trying special maneuvers while engaging
in mounted combat.

Wealth Options: The Aviator recieves the usual 5d4 x 10gp in
starting gold., and will spend on the equipment he deems
necessary for his survival.
     While the Aviator can have any monetary amount of treasure,
they cannot have more treasure than they can carry.  So in this
case a Bag of Holding is very useful.

Races: Any race that enjoys riding airborne may become an
Aviator, but it is only recommended for humans.  Nonhuman
characters are limited to their racial restrictions of their
choosen class.

Notes: A flying steed can not be bought, the Aviator must find
one, raise the animal, and train it.  It can be assumed that an
Aeronaut has found such animal already and is in the process of
training it.  The training of the animal fails under the normal
restrictions of the nonweapon proficiency animal training.
     The DM may choose to make an adventure out of the character
finding and training a stead, or he may choose to make the
character part of a group of flying guards, so he would already
have a trained animal.  But that is entirely left up to the DM's
imagination.
      Aviators are often refered by the type of steed they fly.
For a example a character flying a griffon would be called a
griffonier, while someone flying a eagle would be called an
eagletor, and while a someone flying a pegasus would be called a
pegator.
