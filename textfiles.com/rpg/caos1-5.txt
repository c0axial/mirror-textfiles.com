The Adventure of the Holy Sword  (Shannon Appel)  PENDRAGON
Pendragon Character List  (Eric Rowe)  PENDRAGON

--------------------

From: Shannon Appel <appel@erzo.berkely.edu>
Subject: The Adventure of the Holy Sword
System: Pendragon

What follows is an adventure that I ran in my last Pendragon campaign.
It was originally set right around the start of the Pendragon saga, in
490 or 491.  The story centered around a young Roman Christian knight
whose father had "been missing for 2d6 years" as per result 20 of the
Father's Survival Table.

INTRODUCTION

This story concentrates on the quest of a young Roman Christian
knight.  His father had been a great knight, renowned for all of the
virtues of Christianity.  Unfortunately he disappeared several years
ago while erranting about the countryside.  Two companions disappeared
with him.  To this day, no one has actively searched for the player's
missing father.  Thus, when the player becomes a knight, it will
surely be one of his first priorities.

However, the adventure will not simply be a quest for a player's
father, but also a search for a family heirloom.  The player's father
disappeared carrying Sanctgladius, a holy sword which had been in the
family for many generations.  It is said to be a holy weapon which
could only be wielded by the best of God's knights.  The player knight
will probably want to recover the family heirloom even if he learns
that his father is dead.

THE SEARCH BEGINS

The player's father was last seen riding North from Cirenchester on
the King's Road.  The trail is many years old, but the player's father
was sufficiently glorious that even after all these years, the visit
of him and his companions will be remembered by some.

As the players ride North, they will probably be stopping in the many
villages and cities along the King's Road, seeking information.  A
selection of Mundane encounters are included before, representing some
of the meetings with the many denizens along the King's Road.  They
are meant to provide a good introduction to some of the varied
encounters that Pendragon knights may expect to meet.

CIRENCESTER

Within the city of Cirencester lies the luxurious home of the Duke of
Clarence.  Years ago, the player's father began his quest here, and
thus the players will be likely to begin their own quest by speaking
with the duke.  Unfortunately, the duke is a PROUD man, and the
knights, being his lessers, will have troubles getting in to see him.

An appointment with the duke may be had by speaking with the Duke's
Castellan, Amig of Cricklade.  In order to get an appointment, the
knight speaking with Amig should make a Courtesy roll.  This skill may
be modified by player's glory / 1000.  Additionally, the roll should
be modified based upon the way that Amig is treated.  Amig is
COWARDLY, and thus very susceptible to threats.  If he were
threatened, however, the knight in question would be challenged within
a day to a joust by an ORDINARY KNIGHT.

Even if tge Courtesy roll is successful, the players will still find
themself in for a bit of a wait before the Duke sees them.  An
ordinary sucess will mean that they will be given an appointment to
speak with the Duke in one week's time, while a failure means that
they will have to wait for several weeks.  Only if the Courtesy roll
is a critical success shall the player's be able to see the Duke
quickly.

If the players are willing to wait until their appointed time, this is
a sign of their MODESTY.  They should receive a check in that
personality trait.  However, the Duke will think less of them, for
they will have confirmed his initial assessment of their status.  The
Duke will be abrupt and perfunctory in his meeting with the players.

On the other hand, if the players are angered by the time that they
must wait, and agitate constantly over it, they will receive an
earlier appointment within a day or two.  However, the will also
receive PROUD checks.  When the players meet with the Duke, he will
have considerably more respect for them.  Beyond simply supplying
information, he may even help out any poorly equipped knights, by
providing them with adequate horses or armor.  If any knights are
extremely poorly dressed, he will also be willing to buy them a Librum
worth of clothing.

If the players do decide to wait at the Duke's court, they will have
the opportunity to involve themselves in a variety of activities.
They may GAME, look for eligible women, challenge the Duke's knights
or do any number of other things.  How the knights comport themselves
at the court may affect what the Duke thinks of the characters when he
finally meets them.  Again, it should be rembered that the Duke
respects PRIDE and derides MODESTY.

WHAT THE DUKE KNOWS

The Duke will remember the player's father fairly clearly.  Several
years ago, some ferocious beast was rampaging across the Duke's lands.
The player's father answered the Duke's call for help, taking two boon
companions with him to aid against the monster.  The three knights set
out North, heading for Bourton, where the creature had killed several
villagers just a few days before.  The three knights never returned,
but within a few weeks, the attacks upon the Duke's lands stopped.

BOURTON

The town of Bourton is held by the Duke of Clarence.  It lies along
side a river, just off of the King's Road.  The town is uniformly
SUSPICIOUS of the knights when they arrive.  The villagers will hide
within their filthy shelters when the knights arrive, and do whatever
they can to avoid notice.  Depending on how the knights treat this
abject terror, personality trait checks may be appropriate.

If the knights are able to gain the trust of the peasants of Bourton,
they will learn that the land is the fief of a knight named Sir
Cervidus, a NOTABLE Roman KNIGHT.  He is renowned for his CRUELTY, and
the lands that he has gained from the Duke of Clarence bear the mark
of his iron fist.  Sir Cervidus works his peasants terribly, so much
that some of the older men have died early deaths.  Worse, he has had
several young men executed, claiming that they were conspiring against
him.

Clearly, Sir Cervidus is not acting MERCIFULLY, yet, what he does is
well within his rights as a knight and the fiefed Lord of Bourton.
Thus, JUSTICE is upon his side.  If the players do decide to do
something about Sir Cervidus, they will be ARBITRARY, yet MERCIFUL.
If they ignore the plight of the peasants, they shall be CRUEL, yet
JUST.  Sir Cervidus lives in a manor house several miles East of
Bourton.  Given sufficient time, he could raise eight knights to help
defend his lands.  This would take several weeks to accomplish,
however.

WHAT THE PEASANTS KNOW

Even if the player knights ignore the plight of Sir Cervidus'
peasants, it is likely that they will still be able to gain the
information they seek from the peasants.  The peasants will claim that
several years ago, there was a huge dragon threatening their lands.
The player's father, with his two companions, investigated the area
for awhile, and then travelled North, still following the beast.  They
thought that its lair was near Brandon, a town considerably North
along the King's Road.

BRANDON

The players last stop along the King's Road will likely be the city of
Brandon.  During Phase 1, Brandon is a free town, for the Baron of
Lambor, Blamore de Ganis, has not yet come to Britain.  The peasants
of Brandon will go to great extents to hide this dark secret.
Usually, they will claim that their Lord is a Sir Antonio, a reclusive
knight who lives to the West.

Externally, the peasants of Brandon will be constantly polite, doing
whatever they can to please or appease the knights.  They will provide
everything they know about the knight's father.  If, however, they
believe that the knights might have learned their secret (and, they
are relatively suspicious in this regard), they will extend their
fullest hospitality to the knights, and then try and slay them while
they sleep.

WHAT THE BRANDONIANS KNOW

The player's father and his two companions came to Brandon several
years ago, seeking a snake as big as a horse.  The people of Brandon
had several times seen such a creature in the Forest Sauvage, a deep,
primeval place that lies to the East of Brandon.  The three knights
went into the Forest Sauvage, leaving extra horses and equipment with
the people of Brandon.  They never returned for it.  (If the players
ask, the people of Brandon will say that they carefully kept the
equipment and horses until a year ago, when it was stolen in the
night.  This is a lie.  In truth, when they decided that the knights
would not return, they sold the items for their own profit.  This is
yet another sign of the incorrect independence of these people.)

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE THREE KNIGHTS

When the Three Knights went into the woods, they knew that they were
seeking a creature which they had dubbed the Three Colored Serpent.
They were certain that together they could overcome it.
Unfortunately, each of the three knights had a fatal flaw which was
his downfall.

Sir Gwyn, the first of the companions was SELFISH.  Thus, on the first
night, when he killed a great black bear, and found a valuable gem
within its skull, he abandonded his two friends, afraid that they
would try and take his treasure from him.  Today, he lives in Logres,
a very rich man.  Both Eleri and the Forgetful Knight know Sir Gwyn's
dark secret, and might be willing to tell it to the player knights.

Sir Gaidon, the second of the companions was COWARDLY.  When he and
the player's father finally met the three colored serpent, Gaidon
turned and fled, leaving his friend to the serpents mercies.  He
watched the battle from afar, and went mad when it ended.  Since, he
has wandered the woods, now the forgetful knight.

The player's father was RECKLESS.  Together with Sir Gaidon, he had a
fair chance against the serpent.  To fight it would have been quite
VALOROUS.  To fight it alone was RECKLESS, however, and he payed the
final price.  The three colored serpent defeated the player's father
and ate him.  However, in the battle, the serpent was badly wounded,
and thus is stopped its attacks upon civilized lands for a time.

ADVENTURES IN THE FOREST SAUVAGE

The final search for the player's father, and the Holy Sword
Sanctgladius depends heavily upon the material on the Forest Sauvage
that is presented in the Boy King.  Following is a list of meetings
which might occur in the Forest.  Boy King scenerios are referred to
several times.

THE RED FEATHERED KNIGHT (The Boy King, pg.25): The Red Feathered
Knight is one that wanders the forest, never able to escape it due to
an ancient curse.  However, the nature of Red Feather's curse is
slightly varied from the one presented in the Boy King.  This Red
Feathered Knight hunted the White Stag of the Forest Sauvage.  Such
creatures are said to be very mystical, and in certain way each the
heart of the wood they live in.  The Red Feathered Knight found and
slew the White Stag of the Forest Sauvage, and so he greatly hurt the
woods.  Thus, the druidess Eleri cursed Red Feather, so he would never
be able to leave the woods.  Red Feather is good and chivalrous, but
he is also PROUD.

THE DRUIDESS ELERI: In a small, tidy house, nearby a pleasant stream
lives the druidess Eleri.  Eleri considers herself the protectress of
the Forest Sauvage and will always do what she can to preserve the
woods and punish those that harm it.  She understands the cycle of
life, and that some things must die so that others may live, but
wanton slaughter for its own sake is something that she will never
accept.  Eleri would be willing to forgive Red Feather and release him
from his curse if he was remorseful, and willing to try and undo the
damage he had done.  Unfortunately Red Feather's PRIDE will make it
hard for the player's to convince him to accept this.  If Red Feather
does apologize and spend a year planting trees and helping to defend
the forest, Eleri will release him from his curse.  Eleri knows
precisely what happened to the player's father.  Perhaps she will tell
the players if they do her some favor (see THE RAVEN WITCHES below).
Eleri could take the players straight to the serpent, but would do so
only if the knights could convince her that they meant it no harm.  If
Eleri were for some reason attacked, she has magical powers including
personal transformation powers (to nearly any woodland beast), and
powers of control over beasts of the wild.

SIR BALIN (The Boy King, pg.25): Balin knows the Forest well, and he
might be able to provide many bits of useful information.  He probably
knows of Eleri, as well as The Forgetful Knight.  Perhaps he might
even know the general direction in which the Three Colored Serpent
lives.  Balin will probably impress the knights as a good person.  He
might be the player's first introduction to the true knights of the
Arthurian legends.  This encounter should only happen in Phase 1.

THE GALLOPING DEVIL (The Boy King, pg.30-31): The adventure of the
Galloping Devil and his Dandy Dogs may be used almost exactly as it is
written in the Boy King.  One night, while the knights are within the
woods, he will attack.  The Devil's specific reason for attacking will
be that he hopes to scare off the Knights, ending their quest for
Sanctgladius.  If the player's seem unable to drive the Devil off, the
Red Feathered Knight might come to their aid and do so.  This would
put the players deeply in Red Feathers debt, and make them much more
likely to aid him in becoming free of his curse.

THE RAVEN WITCHES: Within the Forest Sauvage is a coven of three Raven
Witches (see stats on PENDRAGON, pg. 189).  They will have an
appropriately sized band of warriors and thieves, of similar types to
the Warriors of the Raven Witches in Pendragon.  These witches have no
great tower, but simply meet nightly in a certain glen, plotting evil.
Although the knights could randomly stumble upon these witches, it is
most likely that Eleri will send the knights to deal with them (for
they do her forest evil), in return for some knowledge or favor.
Eleri simply wishes the witches gone from her forest, although the
players may yet decide to slay them, for if they left, they would
clearly do evil elsewhere.  The players will face somewhat of a
dilemma, however, for the Raven Witches know of the quest that the
players are upon, and their magical power is great enough that they
could successfully scry the location of the player's father (or more
correctly, his bones).

THE FORGETFUL KNIGHT: The forgetful knight is a madman.  He remembers
very little of his past, before the battle that he fled.  With some
work, however, the knights might be able to make some sense out of his
ramblings.  Eventually, the Forgetful Knight could tell the players
almost everything that happened upon that last trip into the Forest
Sauvage.  In addition, he can take the players straight to the lair of
the Three Colored Serpent.

CONFRONTING THE SERPENT

Fighting the three colored serpent would be a very dangerous task
which might result in the death of several knights (see his stats in
THE BOY KING, pg. 25).  If the serpent is attacked in his lair (which
either Eleri of the Forgetful Knight could lead the players to), he
will fight to the death.

Another option might be to ask Eleri to pacify the serpent.  She can
do so easily, allowing the players to search his lair.  If the players
tried to attack the serpent at this point, however, they would have
both Eleri and the serpent to contend with.

The serpent's lair is a cave, fairly large in size.  Bones and rubbish
are scattered about.  When searching the rear of the cave, two things
of great import will be found, namely a shield bearing the marks of
the player's father and the sword, Sanctgladius.  In addition, twenty
Librums of various valuable treasure may be looted [not the two
hundred Librums mentioned in the Boy King].

SANCTGLADIUS

Sanctgladius is a Holy Sword, which bears the personal blessing of the
Lord.  It can only be wielded by a CHRISTIAN KNIGHT, however (any
other can not pull it from scabbard).  When a good Christian wields
Sanctgladius, it will do normal sword damage plus 1D6.  If
Sanctgladius is wielded by one who has 20s in all of the Christian
traits, it will do +2D6.

QUEST'S END

Although the final fate of the character's father has been discovered,
there are several more possible adventures.

* If the player is not the oldest son in his family, he should give the
  sword to his oldest brother, as family inheiritance.  However, since this
  oldest brother never tried to seek his father, clearly he is not worthy
  of the blade.  Perhaps he is a GREEDY merchant, who would try and sell
  Sanctgladius, or a PIOUS monk, who would never use it.  How will the
  players react to this?

* The Druidess Eleri might later ask for more aid.  Perhaps knights are
  have begun to chop down trees throughout her forest, or some malicious
  agency is slowly corrupting the woods.

* Sir Gwyn, who left the player's father to his fate lives in luxury.  Will
  the players declare war upon him, subtly begin to intrigue against him,
  or leave him alone?

* If the characters succeeded in freeing Red Feather from his curse, in a
  year or so, he will need help in becoming adjusted again to civilization.
  Will the players aid?
