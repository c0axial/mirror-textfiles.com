crossbow, dagger (normal or throwing), dart, shortsword, and the

of the easier ones to conceal, and the Swindler must become
proficient in these weapons before gaining proficiencies in any
other weapon.

because he has been caught cheating.
     The Swindler does not recieve the 10 percent bonus to earned

starting gold, and will spend on the equipment he deems
necessary for his survival.
     While the Swindler can have any monetary amount of treasure,
they cannot have more treasure than they can carry.  So in this
case a Bag of Holding is very useful.  Unless the Swindler has
some sort of secret hid out to stash his loot.

Swindler, but it is only recommended for humans, and half-elves.
Nonhuman characters are limited to their racial restrictions of
their choosen class.

Notes: Most warriors or thieves build strongholds when they reach
the 9th level, and start to attract a bodies of soldiers.  But
since a Swindler spends his time gambling he will build a
stronghold outside of some town, and run a casino, drug house, and
prostitution ring out of it, because the Swindler is into making
money.  Although the people that come to his club do not realize
this, all of his games will be designed so there is no winner.  The
Swindler will also attract a body of soldiers, and these men will
be loyal to him, and help him run his casino, and defend his
stronghold.
