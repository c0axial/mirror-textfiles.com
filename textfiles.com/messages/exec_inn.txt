First- that telenet 30154 works great. Just like pcp, same speed and all.
One thing- dont post it around anymore, please. Enough people have it, and
if it is going to last (i think they are going to catch on eventually) you
have to preserve it.
 One final word- when dialing out of that , use the following:
*D (dial..)
9k1npa-#

You just have to preceed the # by 9k.. so, chill, have fun, and call
around.

(The media will probably get ahold of this and explode it out of
proportion:
     Teen hackers break into high security Network
or something of the like.. geez..)

pursuit,id,password   (something like that...) anyway,  here are some
numbers  that you can bug the hell out of...

department of the army:(202)-545-6700
pentagon(dept. of defense):(202)-697-0101
white house:(202)-456-1000
executive office of the president:(202)-456-7639
marine department(ask for oliver north or his lawyer's
number):(202)-694-1610  (202)-694-1516...

all of these numbers are in washington d....  from here you can ask the
operator for the number to casper winburger, george bush, ect... just ask
for the autobon #... later..

Thisn't is the base for code talk either.. Pick the right bases for your
information..

ON that Idea for a Shell Script UNIX BBS, Disk Jockey have you figred it out..
And have you decided on completing your 'code hacker' off a UNIX. That would be
incredibly awesome

    So what's everyone up to?  Did everyone catch the UNIX system in the
203 NPA that had no passwords for anything?  (it might have been here,
maybe somewhere else -- I can't remeber).  Well, anyway, even though you
can't log on as root from a dialin, you can very easily do an su and do all
sorts of things (mod /etc/passwd file, for one.... hehe)  But anyway -- I'm
fairly certain that it will be p/w'd very soon... as soon as they find a
couple of us, so I'm puttin out a request....  can anyone get the sources
for login.c for SysV rel 2?  If you can, please leave me a message.... we
might be able to get a permanent backdoor in this place...  I love it.
     I have a number for a DoD non-secure Vax 11/780 that will be going up
in about a week.  I'll put it up when it goes up... that'll be nice (it's
inside a PBX too...  I have some codes for it, and it'll do autovon, a WATS
outdial, and normal local calling.... nice)

login:root

I got into this one system before by Overflowing the buffer... And it let me
in(Vax)... It alowed me to dialout and it had a Dialing directory with some
pretty interesting numbers in it...it's (301)428-1479 or 0540.

You can only logon locally as root
so once in using one of the various
accounts posted use "su root" to
give you superuser...
