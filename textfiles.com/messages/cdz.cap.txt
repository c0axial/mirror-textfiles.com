Ok, well, most of those are safe.  The 476-3636 traces ON HACKING ATTEMPTS. 
Uh, as far as I know, 0266s are still safe, although there is a rumor going 
around that they're busting...  That codeline at 444-5620 is invalid.  Don't

 . . are in a group called Extenders, that include 1-800's, 1044's, 0488's, 
and almost any other number you use with a code. Telephone companies own them 
and people pay to have codez that they can use on the Extenders. They pay for 
these codes because using them in the long run costs less when calling 
long-distance. That's where phreakerz come in, they obtain these codez (all in

good natured fun of course, hehe) and charge them with a shitload of bills, 
all in good fun. I would advise in not using any 0266's unless you know what 
your doing, cause they have ANI (kind of tracing) on them now. I definetly 
recommend reading some text philes , INPHRK-1/2 are a few of the good ones 
I've seen. Here are some \/mb's  :

 . . . that's about it. About that system Steve, it's an RSTS-E, don't know 
anything about DEC. Don't have to kill yourself finding info, just see what 
defaults there could be . . maybe you'll find one I haven't tried. I think 
posting these vmb's is better than posting codez, this way you can get them 
direct (in a way). That leaves the message base free for discussion and 
questions!!! Anywayz, where are you TOOL? What about that 1007, I need some 
info like should I hack it at hour intervals, what codes you've gone through, 
and stuph like that . . . . anywayz  . . talk at ya . . .

Laughing Swede was the one that wanted to get into a manhole.  All that
hardware shit is beyond me . . well Falstaff, most vmb systems, like computer
network systems, have default password #'s for empty boxes(accounts).  You
don't want to hack a box that someone has already or they'll just complain and
have you off in a day or s Look for an empty box (ya, manually).  Then you 
usually press * or # to input the pass code.  The default pass-code is usually
the number of the box, or somthings for e.g.:  box 1234, 1234, 12341234, 4321,
43214321, 1111.  I don't have my own box though (yet), I need to get a couple
hours free, anywayz, you should ask NIL, he gave me these tips, and he has his
own box (1-800-333-4933, box 6721).  Still looking for some telenet fiends to
chat with . . .  talk at ya

Ok ok ok.... Well, first... VMB's--- It is usually best to scan out a virgin
system.. They are the easiest to hack... Also, many virgin systems just plain
don't have passwords assigned, YET.. So you find an unused box and can give it
a passcode... If they all do have passwords, then you should go looking for
defaults.. On Aspen systems, the passcode is usually just the box #... On AT&T
audix type systems, the default is usually the box # backwards... On that
other system with the bells, the default is sometimes NO passcode, or box # it
is really easy, guys....

Second.. Do 0266's trace and bill, or is that a rumor... I have been using 
them with no diverter for a while...

Third.. I am looking for a east bay local pbx... If anyone wants to keep it 
private, just call my box 18003334933 #6721 (that box has fucking lasted just 
about forever!!! amazing!! Too bad it has such short greetings.....)

I have 1 east bay pbx, and can't for the life of me hack it.. It may not even 
have a dialout... I do local scanning quite a bit, but can't ever come up with
much....

Tool : Thanks for uploading Cheese... It is minimal, but it will work for 
now... The main prob is that it only has 1 destination carrier.. The better
ones have slots for about 50, since this is one way that telcos detect 
hacking... (same destination number on bad codes)...

Ok ok.. I am also looking for some local diverters... I really don't trust 
1800 diverters all that much... I really don't trust 1800 anything all that 
much..  Hmmmm..

Telenet.. I used to have a lot of telenet shit lying around, but it was pretty

useless to me... Does anyone know how to use an outdial on telenet?

nil....
soul is a hamhock in your cornflakes

NIL, 0266's do have ANI, I think it all depends on if you are caught when the
code has been really abused and then you use it, or if the customer starts
complaining to the telco about some of the charges. Thanx for the tip about
the Aspen system, I just found one (hehehe). BTW, I though you could use a
outdial by sending in the same commands you would give your modem, can't rely
on text philes though . . . do ya got on hmmmmh-hmmmmmmm, no codez here, I got
