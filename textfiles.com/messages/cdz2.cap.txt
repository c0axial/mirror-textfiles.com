Subject :Pacific Bell VMB's
DateTime:12:14 am  Mon Dec 11, 1989
Pacific Bell now runs a Voice Mail service that people can subscribe to for 
$20 per month.  It's just like the ones run by answering services.  The fact 
that they are the phone company doesn't make it anything special.

I don't know anything about the Bay Area version, but a friend of mine in L.A. 
subscribes to it.  The boxes seem to be in the range of phone numbers from 
213-891-4100 thru 4199, and I am sure there are other prefixes and other 
ranges.  The great thing about them is that they assign a default password to 
each box that is the same as the phone number.  So if you find a vacant box, 
or one where the user was too lazy to change his password, you can get in.

The access sequence is a little funny.  You dial the phone number of a box, 
then when you hear the outgoing message, press 01, then the password followed 
by #, then the 4-digit box number followed by #.
For example, if the box at phone number 213-891-4199 was virgin, you could 
access it by dialing that number, then dialing 01 8914199#  then 4199#.

Follow the prompts and you can change the password, change the outgoing 
messages, and create up to four guest boxes for your box.

Get yourself a good book on elementary electronics, or better yet build some 
heathkits, or any other electronic kits.  That will get you familiar with the 
parts and how to connect them together, and then you would understand the text 
files on how to build the box yourself.

RE: Blue Box 

that you use a few 950's through an extender. . .there's not much that is safe 
anymore. . .find a 1-800 dialup or two for some of the 950's. . .those while, 
not terribly safe, are safer than the 950 itself.
The only one I have is

1-800-733-5000   =  950-1523

If you find some more send em up.

  Is anyone here from SF?  Havent they gone ISDN already?  I thought this was 
one of the test sites for LASS.  If is has, go ahead and build that blue 
box.hehehe.

If you're gonna phreak on them 0266's, why not sweep 'em for safety first?

Use the code to call (617) 890-9900.  If you hear 2 full whistles, it's clean.

what makes you think that 1-800's are any safer than 950's.. the flat out 
truth is that if you use codes for long enough, you WILL get busted..

For a decent article concerning fraud on private swithboards (including 
pbx's), see the business section of the NY Times sometime last week.. go to 
the library..

anyway, some guy from sprint or one of the biggies said something to the 
effect of "Dont think that just because you are making fraudulent phone calls 
through a switchboard that you are safe. The truth is that we WILL catch you."

the other thing about this is that the corporations get stuck with the FULL 
cost of all phreak calls made through their company... So, it is definitely in 
their interest to put their legal department to work and BUST.. See, by the 
time they discover that they are being ripped off, they have already lost tens 
of thousands of dollars.....or more...

well, see ya...

RE: anybody . . 

I've got plans..  From what i've read of how to do it, it's basically tweasy 
oscillators that mix between each other and simulate that beep sound of 
dropping $$$ into a tel booth.  I'd build one.. for.. Hmm.  Depending on how 
difficult it is to find the electronic parts .. probably from $40 to .. shit.. 
if i had to go to texasto find them.. $65,000.Naw, seriously.  I think 
i could probably build one in a few hours and i've got a place pretty close to 
my house and i could build one.. for, $50.  Interested?

Hey, does anyone else have a second opinion to back up Nil regarding the 
safety of those 1-800's?  I always thought they were much safer than 950's.
I'd like to see if everyone agrees or what.

    Ok well - from what I know, it's really rather hard to build a RED BOX - 
even though everyone talks about using them ... you need some good electronic 
exuiptment... ossiliscope and tweaking the frequencies is hard... but why not 
just get one of those little tape recorders... not a mini-cassete but like one 
of those walkman types and then finding a pay phone that beeps rather loudly 
and recording a bunch of quarters dropping in? Then use that?

Also if it's loud enough and there are two pay phones right next to each other 
you could just put the reciever of one to the mouthpiece of the other...

As for 800's They are real dangerous... that's why everyones using 950's 
now... I remember a few years ago - everyone - everywhere was using 800's and 
I think what happened is they got smart, and fucking put ANI on all of them... 
I know they have software to detect code scanning... and I bet that they bust 
people often for using those.... and I bet the same farkin thing is going to 
happen with 950's - they are getting smart... I justthink that the volumn of 
the code abuse is so great that they don't go after everyone... or pick 
certain abusers and bust them... I don't know.. all I know is that they are 
getting mighty dangerous... I have heard all sorts of shit about codes, like 
that they keep a backlog of traced numbers that they don't prosecute... until 
they trace them the second time... shit like that...

But... since P'rat - you live in a dorm... I think they would have a hard time 
getting you. See.. Also - if you use them inmoderation you probably wont get 
nabbed... but I think that's right - If you use all the time, you will get 
caught.

The safest ways that I have phreaked... is 1) Diverters. and 2) Outdialing 
Modems from Telenet... but codes are fukin irresistable... fuuckk doods.
