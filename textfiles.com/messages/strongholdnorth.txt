[Date] Mon Mar 24  9:54:48 Pm

Hello Gentlemen,
 I have a book called "How to Get
anything on Anybody" it gives a list of
NCA #s for all 50 states..most of these
are out-dated (the book came out in
'83) they do give a address of a
company that will supply us with the
up-to-date #s. It is $25. I can't
afford that right now but I am willing
to go in with someone if they are
interested. How to Get is published by
Paladin Press,if you know hwo they are.
It also gives great tips on getting
information from telecos. It's $30 a
book. I also have Get Even: a complete
guide to dirty tricks if anyone wants
to borrow it..you're welcome to it..as
long as I know I'll get it back.

    WOMAN WATCHER: YOU MUST MEAN THE CNA LIST, NOT NCA. NO BIG DEAL THERE,
BUT, A 1983 LIST WOULD BE EXTREMELY OUTDATED. AND IF THEY DO SELL SOMEONE THE
NEW UPDATED LIST, WOULD IT INCLUDE THE AUTHORIZATION CODES ON THE ONES THAT
REQUIRE THEM(NEW YORK, NEW ENGLAND, AND OREGON)? ALSO THE CALIFORNIA CNA'S
WERE ALL CHANGED 2 WEEKS AGO, AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY HARD TO COME
BY. AND I DOUBT I'D FIND ANYTHING IN THE BOOK I DON'T ALREADY HAVE. IF YOU
NEED A CNA, LET ME KNOW. ALL FOR NOW,

ME: Yes, can I have the CNA for the

<Pause>

OP: That's 402-580-2255

*BUT*

Here is a conversation with an Operator
from 818.

ME: Dialed 818-555-1212 (thru MCI)

ME: Yes, can I have the CNA for the
    area code 818 please?

OP: What?

ME: CNA for 818 please?

OP: I need a name, sir.

ME: CNA- Customer Name and Address!

OP: I'm sorry, what is that?

ME: It's a service that the phone
    company issues to the public.

OP: Well all I give you is phone #'s
    out of the white pages.

ME: Look, I just got it from area code
    612, that's Minnesota.

OP: Well, California has different laws
    and I don't know what you're talk-
    ing about.

ME: Ok, do you know where I can call to
    get the number?

OP: No I don't sir.

ME: Well ok, you're some dude. <Click>

Well that proves that it's not as easy

[From] The Hackmaster
[Date] Tue Mar 25 11:24:32 Pm

Dennis,

  There is a whole hell of alot eaiser way to do it..  Just do this.

]FOR X=1 TO 7:INVERSE:?"H";:NEXT:NORMAL
<INVERSE>HHHHHHH
NOW TYPE:
10 REM<ESC><And now trace over the inverse H's and then type your text!>

Simple!

As for saving a program with no dos booted, there is two ways yo can do that.

First you can move it into an area of memory that is safely gaurded when
re-booted. After this move note the pointers and re-boot.  Now move the basic
prgram back into the proper area and reset the pointers.

The second way to do this is to load dos off the cassette. This is a whole hell
of alot eaiser.

[Subj] Blue Dragon- Go away
[From] Dark Cavalier
[Date] Tue Mar 25  1:27:39 Am

If you don't know how to do something,
then don't try and act like you do.  As
one of your previous postings said "Uh,
turn off the modem so it will chain
with your computer and not the user's!"
God, that does not happen PERIOD when
you are running a board and dealing
with answer/originate.  And then you go
on to try and confuse the dude?
Mr. Processor- What your main problem
is, is that Chain loads up into a part
of memory which the driver is using. I
am not sure which, but probably $300,
which telecat uses for it's character
buffer or so.  You'll have to do some
experimenting to see just how to get
past that, but the only things that pop
into my head is 1) to reposition chain
if possible, 2) after loading module
II, immediately reload the driver, and
poke into $300 (768) what was there
before chain... make any sense?

And by the way, Mr. P, I killed you &
took your weaps and armor..

  heh..

But that is exactly what I had to do

that to, but if the other person has

[From] Apple Commander
[Date] Tue Mar 25  5:16:39 Pm

DC is right... The ONLY way it could
*EVER* try to run chain on his
computer, would be if he was calling
thru firmware, and in basic (why would
anyone do this?) and your system wasn't
in chain (the first thing chain does is
change those vectors, so all that stuff
you said about changing the vectors
before chain is bullshit), and you did
a ctrl-d"LOAD CHAIN", then it would try
to do it in his computer, but other
than that it could never happen, NEVER
with a term program, and he too has an
apple-cat...

And you don't *EVER* have to mess
around w/$3D0, or CALL 1002, because
that just disconnects the modem I/O,
and that would make no sense, you want
to restore the vectors to what they
were before it went to chain...

Now that we have Mr. Processor all
screwed up, I can't wait to hear his
reaction!
