
 ULTIMA VI: THE FALSE PROPHET

 The latest and greatest game in the ULTIMA series -- ULTIMA VI: THE FALSE
PROPHET -- has arrived! (This review is based on the IBM-PC version.)

 When you first boot the program, dazzling VGA graphics fill your screen. A
movie-like introduction acquaints you with what has happened since ULTIMA V.
Animated scenes accompanied by a stunning soundtrack depict the return of the
Avatar to Britannia. After this initial intro, the main menu appears, offering
options for creating or transferring a character (from ULTIMA IV or V).
Surprisingly, there's also an option called "Introduction." From there, the
introduction continues, becoming even more captivating. However, introductions
alone do not make a game, nor does a great musical score.

 The enhanced graphics system, innovations in the combat system, an interface
that lets you do virtually anything, and a novel-quality plot make ULTIMA VI a
CRPG of epic proportions. New players will take an immediate liking to the game;
ULTIMA veterans will be stunned by the improvement on the old awkward (but
lovable) design. An icon-driven interface and mouse support have been added. In
addition, support of 256-color VGA (320x200) graphics offers a vast improvement
over the old 16-color landscapes.

 The graphic detail of ULTIMA VI rivals that of most games currently on the
market. Thanks to 256-color graphics, Britannia now looks like a real place. No
longer are towns and monsters represented by icons on the map; they're a part of
the map. Player/NPC interaction has also gained a new twist: Every time you look
at a person or special monster, or attempt to talk to them, a lifelike portrait
appears in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. (This is very helpful for
locating people later, since they're identified by more than a name and an
icon.) The graphic quality alone would make this a stunning game, but there is
much more.

 Besides a graphically detailed map and true-to-life character representations,
interaction with objects has also changed. With this new interface, you can pick
up virtually anything, no matter how worthless or valuable. You can carry slain
bodies of foes or friends to be resurrected, or take any item appearing on the
map. Items also hold true to their characteristics. When you drop a glass
bottle, or attack a wooden door with an axe, they break. If you light a powder
keg near a steel door, the explosion destroys the door. If you use a crank
attached to a draw bridge, the bridge lowers or raises. There are countless
other examples, but you get the idea: The interface is very realistic.

 Along with the incredibly detailed graphics is a sophisticated plot that adds
to the excitement. As always, the story ties in well with previous ULTIMAs
(especially IV and V, with which this game forms a trilogy): The landscape is
familiar, as are many characters, but new players will enjoy exploring the land
and interacting with characters for the first time. And the plot itself? Well,
once again a peril has emerged to threaten Britannia, and guess who's been
called to stop it? That's right, it's up to _you_ to solve the mystery of the
Gargoyles. More then just a new group of monsters, they're an ancient,
intelligent race rooted in the mysterious underworld. Never before have I
encountered as well-written or as captivating a game plot. Naturally, I can't
reveal details; suffice it to say that ULTIMA VI is much, much more than another
one one of those ubiquitous kill-the-villain-of-the-month CRPGs.

 The combat system of ULTIMA VI has also been overhauled. In order to achieve
greater realism, the process of engaging the enemy has been simplified. In
previous ULTIMAs, groups of foes (as well as friends) were depicted as single
icons on a map that expanded to a battle screen when engaged. In ULTIMA VI,
everything takes place in the "real world." Groups of monsters appear as just
that, and you engage them directly. No combat screen is loaded, and movement is
unlimited. During combat you can go anywhere, and do almost everything can do in
non-combat.

 Along with the graphic element of combat, a new strategic element has also been
incorporated. Party members may now be controlled by the computer, and their
strategies controlled by you. You have the following options for each character:
Assault, Frontal Attack, Flanking Maneuvers, Rear Attack, Berserk Attack, and
Command Mode for direct control. Some gamers argue that this combat system is
ineffective, but Command Mode should satisfy them; I think the new system is a
great improvement.

 Unfortunately, Version 1.7 of ULTIMA VI is _very_ buggy; many problems have
been discussed in The Gamers' Forum and elsewhere. Since ULTIMA VI's commercial
debut, a new version (3.2) has been released. (Although Version 3.2 cleared up
the bugs on my system, some players are still reporting bug-related problems
with Version 3.2. For example, the infamous "boat bug," which randomly trashes
your game, is still present. You can avoid the problem by placing no more than
four characaters in your boat.) Origin offers an upgrade for Version 1.7 owners:
As soon as you obtain your ULTIMA VI package, run the game and enter CTRL-V to
check the version number. If it's Version 1.7, a call to Origin will get you the
later release.

 ULTIMA VI runs on IBM-PC, Tandy, and 100%-compatible machines, and requires
640K of RAM; a mouse and hard drive are recommended. The program supports
256-color VGA, MCGA, EGA, CGA, Tandy 16-color, and Hercules graphics modes.
Sound support is provided for Roland, Ad Lib, CMS Game Blaster, Innovation,
Tandy 3-voice, and Covox products. Program files are distributed on seven 5-1/4"
copyable diskettes, and can be easily installed on a hard drive. (If you require
3-1/2" diskettes, you may obtain them by mailing in $10.00, the 5-1/4"
diskettes, and the included exchange coupon.) The program does require off-disk
documentation checks at key points in the game.

 Despite the bugs, ULTIMA VI is a truly great CRPG worthy of the ULTIMA name.
Because its elements include aspects of both role-playing and adventure games,
ULTIMA VI will appeal to a broader audience. The realistic interface, incredible
graphics, moving soundtrack, and great plot all contribute to make ULTIMA VI a
highly worthwhile investment.

 ULTIMA VI: THE FALSE PROPHET is published and distributed by Origin.
