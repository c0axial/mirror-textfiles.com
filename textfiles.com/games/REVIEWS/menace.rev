
 MENACE

 There are two things of which I am certain upon opening a new game from
Psygnosis: First, the graphics and animation will be superb. Second, when I play
the game, I'm going to lose. MENACE falls right in line with my expectations.
(This review is based on the Amiga version; Commodore 64/128 version notes
follow.)

 MENACE is a sideward-scrolling, arcade shoot-'em-up that deserves a place on
any creature-killer's shelf. The graphics are the closest to coin-op caliber
I've ever seen: They have that quality of appearing to float several inches in
front of the monitor.

 While you're guiding a small-armed craft down the center, over sixty different
kinds of aliens either come at you from the opposite side, or ghoulishly detach
themselves from the scenery lining your path. The aliens attack in small groups.
When an entire group is destroyed, a 1000-point icon appears. This icon can be
picked up to earn the points, but I wouldn't recommend it. Instead, you should
blast it at least five times. The icon then becomes a close-range, rapid-fire
cannon that attaches to your ship. Or, blast another five times, and you have a
long-range laser. The icon will continue these mutations and make available a
super-fast engine, a pair of outboard combat droids, an energy force field, and
extra power to prolong the life of your ship.

 Combat in MENACE takes place in six very different zones. At the end of each
zone is a guardian. These guardians are as nasty as they are spectacular. It is
necessary to defeat each one in order to move to the next zone. If your ship is
destroyed, you are given the option of starting the next game within the same
zone. It is helpful not to have to go back through the earlier levels, although
you will be without any of the weapons you may have picked up along the way.

 I must apologize for having typed this review with my feet. This is because my
fingers and hands have become numb and useless. By the time I was able to put
MENACE down, I could only fire my weapon by repeatedly banging my head against
the joystick button. In brief, I don't think I've ever come across a more
demanding action game. This is particularly true near the beginning of the game,
when you're restricted to the use of a single-fire weapon. I would have advised
the game's designers that an option for starting out with better weaponry would
have diminished the game's addictiveness not one bit. It might also have given
me a chance to win.

 The MENACE disk is copy-protected, and must remain in the drive during play. If
write-enabled, it can save high scores. The documentation notes that some of the
program's graphics are only available on the Amiga; other versions wil be
slightly less spectacular. The Amiga version requires 512K of memory and a color
monitor.

 MENACE is challenging, entertaining, and addicting. Extra appendages are, of
course, recommended for successful play.

 COMMODORE 64/128 VERSION NOTES

 The C64/128 version of MENACE is every bit as entertaining and addictive as its
Amiga counterpart.

 There are two points worth noting about MENACE: the "Virus Warning," and the
programming. Apparently, paranoia about viruses has reached epic proportions in
England. The MENACE instruction manual suggests that users turn their computers
off and leave them off for 30 seconds before booting, because a virus residing
in the machine will destroy the program. It's safe to assume Psygnosis is
serious, especially since it guarantees the MENACE disk to be free of viruses.

 MENACE illustrates the quality of game that can be created by programmers who
are not seduced by the siren song of coding tricks. The Amiga version looks like
a coin-op game; the C64 version, if nothing else, fits well within its hardware.
We have David Jones and Tony Smith to thank for this.

 The instruction manual was written with the Amiga and Atari ST versions in
mind; there is no C64 reference card. The only differences are the C64's use of
a function key to pause the game, and the inability to restart on the current
level after your ship's been destroyed.

 The less than perfect arcade quality of the C64's graphics and sound won't
hamper your enjoyment. MENACE plays well on the Commodore, and it's interestin
and frustrating enough to be addictive.

 MENACE is published and distributed by Psygnosis, Ltd.
