 After reading with envy all the initial comments in The Gamers' Forum about
Microsoft's newest version of its ever popular FLIGHT SIMULATOR (FS), I finally
managed to get my hands on a copy. I picked it up on my way home from work, then
giggled with anticipation the whole way -- a curious sight for more than one
passing motorist. Even more curious was the fact that I'd just finished three
days of milk-run-type flying, and here I was looking forward to more of the same
using my computer. Unfortunately, weekend chores and a couple of minor household
emergencies delayed takeoff until the evening hours, and even then, I was
limited to a brief local flight out of Meigs Field. (This review is based on the
IBM-PC version.)

 My first reaction to the new software was disappointment. If FS 3.0 was lame,
then FS 4.0 seemed to be in even worse shape. While sitting on the button of
runway 36 checking out FS 4.0's avionics, "Ace McCool" in a blue and white
Cessna cut right in front of me and jerkily accelerated down the runway (jerk
being the key word here). By this time, I had realized that at least I was in
familiar surroundings; nothing of consequence on the panel had been moved or
rearranged from the previous version. I decided it was time to get "these
laughter silvered wings up there into the tumbling mirth."

 With full throttle applied, the engine was developing only 2358 RPM. Were the
new flight equations causing this sluggish performance, or were the reduced revs
indicative of my struggling 8088 CPU running feverishly at 8Mhz, trying to keep
up with the graphics? I decided to beat it around the circuit and land as
quickly as possible. The pattern was flown roughly, and my over-corrections
caused the aircraft to wing-walk all the way. With some difficulty, I managed to
get the "thing" around the patch and back onto the ground. (Notice I did not say
"runway.") At least it didn't tend to climb like a homesick angel each time I
rolled on more than a few degrees of bank, as it did in FS 3.0.

 At this point, I went to my bed mumbling that this inexpensive program would
end up costing me thousands. I was not about to give up on FLIGHT SIMULATOR, but
was I ready to spring for a 20Mhz screamer, just so I could do on my spare
evenings what I get paid to do at work?

 The next day, my first stop was the control tower, where I spent twenty minutes
watching the dynamic scenery do "its" thing using the full screen tower view.
The "Jerk" was still out there flying his blue and white Cessna, along with all
the other traffic in the circuit. Admittedly, I was already being won over. In
fact, I was fascinated.

 Before attempting a few circuits in the generic Cessna, from the Views menu I
turned off the dynamic scenery and activated the four-small-dot axis indicator.
(I usually fly with these dots activated: Once you get used to them, they help
compensate for the lack of depth perception common to all versions of FLIGHT
SIMULATOR.) By keeping the dots in the touchdown zone, I'd been able to land
pretty much on the money with a good deal of regularity. However, that was not
the case this morning. The Cessna still seemed to lack the stability I was
accustomed to. In addition to my obvious excessive control inputs, the torque of
the engine kept causing the nose to swing to the left. On final approach, a
higher than normal body angle made my axis indicator useless as a landing aid,
and the power required to maintain an acceptable glide path exaggerated the
torque swing. It was obviously time to go back to the drawing board.

 The aircraft design module included with FS 4.0 is the highlight of the
package. In no time, I was able to whip up my SIMSTAR-88 design and test it to
my complete satisfaction. I now had a much more stable and familiar platform
from which to fly. It might be my imagination, but it seemed to work better with
the dynamic scenery turned on, as well. Several attempts were required to
correctly size the tail and build in the proper dihedral in order to partially
counteract the torque swing, but a cross-country test flight from Chicago to
Cincinnati (SCENERY DISK #9) indicated dramatically improved handling
characteristics.

 At last I was satisfied that, yes, I could live with this new product. In fact,
I was beginning to like it...until I started to taxi to the ramp: Brake failure!
No, not really. As in previous versions, if you touch almost any other key while
applying the brakes, brake pressure will be immediately released, and you'll
have to re-apply them. Unfortunately, brake effectiveness and radius of turn
have been degraded in FS 4.0, making ground operations a totally "ham-fisted"
operation. An old rule of thumb from the early days of aviation states, "Never
taxi faster than a man can walk." This is especially true in FLIGHT SIMULATOR V.
4.0. If you taxi too slowly, though, somebody in an A-310 or a Lear Jet will
come speeding down the ramp and run you over. Those turkeys have no respect for
the rules of the air! (They exceed 250 knots below 10,000 feet, too.)

 The IBM-PC version of FLIGHT SIMULATOR 4.0 requires an IBM PC, XT, AT, Personal
System/2, or compatible. CGA, EGA, VGA, PS/2 Graphics System, and Hercules
Monochrome or InColor Card are the graphics modes supported. You'll need at
least 384K of RAM for CGA graphics, and perhaps more memory for other adapters
(in an amount that the program will specify when it begins). FS 4.0 runs on at
least one floppy disk drive (double-sided, low- or high-density); it's not
copy-protected, so you may install it on your hard drive, and make backup
copies. Note that when you register the program, you'll receive the free
navigation charts.

 Just one day of testing this new version of FLIGHT SIMULATOR is not enough to
fully explore its quirks (or to find many of its pleasant surprises), but I've
made a few observations, most of which are positive. The dynamic scenery and
weather add realism to the program environment, as do improved runway lighting
systems. However, the impact of these improvements is diminished by the fact
that a relatively fast '286 or '386 machine is required to fully exploit a
simulation program that allows you to fly through polka-dot clouds on an ILS
approach to a fully-lighted grass runway (like those at Chicago O'Hare).

 Some flight characteristics have been improved, and some have been degraded.
Fortunately, the aircraft design feature allows you to modify most of these
characteristics to suit, and this alone makes FS 4.0 well worth the purchase
price. There is enough in this program to keep any avid flight simulator pilot
delightfully occupied for many hours. However, if you're a beginner at flight
simulation, or if you're running one of the slower machines, you may want to
stick to an earlier version until you're comfortable with the basics. In any
event, I'm sure that CompuServe's Gamers' Forum, as well as the anomaly reports
of the Computer Pilots Association of America, will be full of discussion for
months to come.

 As for me, well, I'll be flying my SIMSTAR-88 around FLIGHT SIMULATOR 4.0
territory until something better comes along. It _is_ an improvement over FS
3.0, and I've already put in my order for a 20Mhz '386 screamer. I sure hope
Santa is feeling flush this Christmas!

 PROBLEM REPORT

 The following descriptions of operational problems have been compiled by Rick
Lee, GAMERS' Flight Simulators Section Leader:

 -:- Taxiing is unrealistic and very difficult: The turning radius of the plane
is huge, the brakes are not very effective, and there is no ground friction.

 -:- There is still room for only six Scenery Disks in the menu.

 -:- Access to the modes is very awkward. (You should at least be able to scroll
backwards through the list.)

 -:- The joystick sensitivity adjustments for the Throttle and Rudder on
Joystick B are mislabeled: The labels are reversed.

 -:- The plane tends to bank a very small amount to the left, and drift to the
left about one degree every 40 seconds. There has been a lot of discussion as to
whether this was supposed to simulate torque, swirling prop wash, or P-Factor;
but since it happens on the jets also, it's usually attributed to a bug. (This
will not happen until the ailerons have been moved after taking off.)

 -:- The Elevator Trim feature still does not work with a joystick. The trim
movements are canceled by any joystick movement.

 -:- The joystick sensitivities are not loaded automatically on startup. Hitting
PrintScreen will load the sensitivities.

 -:- The Multi-Player Function is still very buggy. The program will often
freeze up for no reason while in the MP menu. The plane pauses while the user is
typing a message. This may have been intentional, but most serious users want to
do a lot of formation flying, which means that messages cannot be sent without
spoiling the formation. Often, when landing after a trip, the two planes are
seen at different altitudes. Your own plane will be on the ground, but the other
plane may be seen floating ten feet off the ground, or even under the ground
level.

 -:- The Auto-Pilot Nav1 Lock does not function properly.
