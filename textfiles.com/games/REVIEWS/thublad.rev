
 THUNDER BLADE

 The package says THUNDER BLADE was an arcade hit. I'll take Sega's word for it,
because I've never played the arcade version...and if it's anything like the
home computer version, I don't really want to. (This review is based on the
IBM-PC version of the game.)

 Basically, THUNDER BLADE is a helicopter shoot-'em-up with the potential to be
a good game of its type. There are a variety of different "stages" or scenarios,
theoretically enough to keep you interested and coming back for quite a while.
In reality, however, the game left me yawning.

 Start with the minimal documentation: a single sheet of paper, 8-1/2" x 11",
with two folds. Read it thoroughly; it takes about 30 seconds, and you won't
find any mention that the game can be installed on your hard drive, despite the
fact that the two 5-1/4" diskettes include Install, HDInstal, and Uninstal
programs. Obviously, this is but a mere annoyance if the game turns out to be
worthwhile.

 Graphics? Well, the box says the game supports CGA, EGA, and Tandy 4-color
modes if you have 512K of RAM, as well as MCA, VGA, and Tandy 16-color modes if
you have 640K. Although I booted the game with no TSRs or drivers loaded, I was
unable to display anything resembling the screens on the rear of the box; EGA
seemed to be the best I could get. Sound is a few bars of music repeated over
and over, along with a few tinny explosions.

 The opening scenario has you looking straight down at your copter, which proves
confusing. Although the size of the targets on the ground changes slightly with
altitude, more often than not I wound up on the ground and sat there, thinking I
was a hundred feet in the air. Stage 2 has you looking at your copter from
behind; this gives you a better idea of where you are, but your view of anything
approaching you is effectively blocked.

 Controls are rudimentary. The copter is armed with missiles as well as bullets,
but the same fire button controls both types of weapons; which one gets fired
depends on how long you hold the button down. It takes some practice to swoop
down on an enemy tank and fire a bomb instead of a measly bullet. Combinations
of joystick movement and fire button #2 control movement of the helicopter --
which, even on a 20MHz 386, is rather sluggish.

 The documentation indicates mouse support, but when the joystick was plugged
in, the program seemed unaware of the presence of the mouse. Frankly, it didn't
seem worth the effort to reach around to the back of my computer and unplug the
joystick just to see how the mouse performed.

 On the back of the THUNDERBLADE box it says, "Find out why it's taking the
nation by storm." Maybe because we live in a country where "America's Funniest
Home Videos" gets higher ratings than "60 Minutes"?

 THUNDERBLADE is published and distributed by Sega.
