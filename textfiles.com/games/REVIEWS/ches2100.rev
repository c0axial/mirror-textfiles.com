 If you're a PC user and play chess, the chances are excellent that
you have at least heard of -- and quite possibly may own -- 
CHESSMASTER 2100 from The Software Toolworks. The program's
popularity isn't hard to understand, considering it offers a
plethora of features, plays a respectable game (even on an XT), and
can usually be found selling for less than $50 (and occasionally
under $25!) in most software stores. (This review is based on the
IBM-PC version.) 

 Probably the most appealing aspects of CM2100 are the many features
accessible via six pull-down menus. You may specify a
three-dimensional set, the ability to design your own pieces, a
voice that announces the openings and provides running commentary
during the course of the game, and a teaching mode. 

 Each of the folowing six headings has its own menu: GAME (Save, 
Load, New Game, etc.); PLAY (choose a playing level, from
"Newcomer" through "Championship"); ACTION (Switch sides, Take
Back, Hint, Offer Draw, etc.); BOARD (standard Staunton pieces in
either 2-D or 3-D); CHOICES (Sound, Commentary, Colors, etc.); and a
WINDOW that appears on demand showing one of various functions, 
including recommended variation and CM2100's analysis of the current
position. 

 To accomodate a wide range of user abilities, navigation of the
program is accomplished via six pull-down menus. However, in my
opinion, the number of menus -- and the titles of each -- only serve
as a source of confusion. I found it difficult to remember which
features were listed on each menu, since only "Board" is
self-explanatory. For instance, "Play" actually refers to the skill
level (most other chess programs refer to it simply as "level"); 
"Choices" is a collection of sight and sound options; and "Game" is
the file menu. Until I became familiar with the terminology and use
of the features, I was spending as much time learning how to use the
program as deciding on a move! 

 The playing strength can be adjusted via numerous settings -- 
again, maybe too many. But curiously, only the "Championship" level
need be selected for CM2100 to play its strongest game. There is a
significant drawback to choosing that level, though: Most other
features are disabled, including such mandatory conveniences as the
"beep" when the program moves, and the ability to force a move when
necessary. 

 The majority of players will find CM2100's playing strength to be
challenging. On my XT, playing it on "Championship" at three minutes
per move, I would judge the program to be the equivalent of about a
1600 U.S. Chess Federation (USCF) over-the-board rating, slightly
better than an average (1500 USCF) tournament chess player. CM2100
seems to be very time-sensitive. Although all programs (and humans, 
too!) play better the more time allotted per move, there seems to be
a noticeably steep decline in the quality of CM2100's play when time
is reduced. (I suspect the difference may be much less obvious on a
PC AT, however.) Secondly, I did notice a definite difference in the
program's play when set to the three-minutes-per-move
"Championship" level, compared to selecting "Advance/Best Style/Deep
Thinking" and gaining access to the vast array of features. 

 It should also be mentioned that I experienced repeated problems in
prompting CM2100 to make its move upon resumption of a saved game. 
CTRL-F would seem to instantly force it to make any legal move, 
regardless of quality. When I "switched sides" and took back moves
(to get CM2100 to try again to make a move), the program would
crash! 

 The 14-page manual adequately explains each of the features, but
does not contain a macro-key summary page. Included is a separate, 
56-page addendum providing an explanation of the movement of chess
pieces, the history of chess, 10 problems, and a description of each
of the 110 "Classic" games that come loaded into the program. 

 CM2100 runs on IBM PCs (XT/AT) and compatibles, including Tandy. It
supports Hercules graphics or better, as well as mouse input. The
game requires 512K of RAM, and is distributed on both 5-1/4" and
3-1/2" diskettes; there is no copy protection. 

 Despite the fact that CM2100 is beginning to show its age a bit (I
understand that the Software Toolworks people are currently working
on an upgrade), it can still be a very satisfying program for most
anyone who plays chess. I strongly suggest that the less experienced
player give it a hard look, especially in light of the low price tag
and the multitude of features it contains. 

 CHESSMASTER 2100 is published and distributed by The Software
Toolworks.
