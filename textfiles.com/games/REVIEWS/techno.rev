 TECHNO COP is a strategy/arcade thriller from Epyx and U.S. Gold (HEROES OF THE
LANCE) that will surely go down in the annals of software history as one of the
cruelest and bloodiest ever. This intense, R-rated, right-wing, law-'n'-order
fantasy offers fabulous graphics, animation, and sound, eleven skill levels,
high-speed car chases, buckets of blood, sick humor, lots of special effects, a
save-game option, and joystick control. This review is based on the Atari ST
version.

 Despite the game's melodramatic exaggeration and cartoon violence, it would be
best to warn parents right away that TECHNO COP is not entertainment for, say,
children under ten years of age. Kids over ten know what a special effect is,
and therefore aren't likely to have adverse reactions -- other than the aches
caused by excessive laughter and joystick twiddling. If we overlook the graphic
violence and black humor, TECHNO COP is a top-notch game, brimming with slick
details and wild action.

 As the Techno Cop, you're a member of the Enforcers, a group of futuristic
crime fighters. You're equipped with V-MAX, a hot, turbo-charged road machin
with an impressive lineup of weapons: machine gun, wheel rams, rapid-fire
cannon, and yes, even low-yield nuclear devices. In your personal arsenal is a
net to capture criminals, and an .88 Magnum to erase them from existence.

 Your opposition is a gang of criminals, thugs, and hit men known as DOA, an
acronym for Death on Arrival.

 Inside V-MAX is a mini-computer that clues you into the details of the most
recent DOA activity. The goal of each level is to get to the crime scene (which
is a timed event), search the halls of tenements and warehouses for a DO
mastermind, and capture or kill him (also a timed event). Along the way, you'll
have to deal with civilians, rats, and elevators, as well as punks and killers
scraped from the bottom of the DOA barrel.

 Failing to beat the time limits doesn't end the game. It continues with another
report of DOA activity to which you must respond; only points are lost. Of
course, getting hacked up by an axe-wielding DOA goon means the end of the
Techno Cop, regardless of time or points.

 The Atari ST screen display is two-fold. You start inside V-MAX, which you
pilot to a crime scene; on reaching the scene, the Techno Cop exits V-MAX and
heads for a building. V-MAX consists of a dashboard and a window, outside of
which you'll see a scrolling road and scenery, other cars, trucks, and
motorcycles. The dashboard consists of speedometer, tachometer, damage and gear
indicators, current score, and the crime computer.

 Although information and small, digitized pictures of wanted DOA bosses appear
on the crime computer, all that really matters is speed. You have a finite
amount of time to reach a crime scene. DOA hit men in other cars and motorcycles
will slow you down. Dangerous curves, trees, and road signs can cause damage to
V-MAX, slowing you down further. V-MAX starts with a machine gun, and weapons
are upgraded as you beat the V-MAX clock.

 On arrival at a crime scene, Techno Cop exits V-MAX, and strides with great
purpose into a run-down building, outside of which children play and grannies
walk around very slowly. The upper two-thirds of the ST screen consists of the
halls and rooms of the building. The lower portion is a wrist command console on
which are the crime computer, radar, clock, life counter, health and strength
indicators, and Gun/Net indicator.

 A net completely encases a thug alive in a cocoon. A couple of shots from the
Magnum throws gallons of blood onto the screen; the thug's eyes bug out, and his
limbs twitch. Depending on your orders, you'll either have to capture or kill
the DOA boss. The radar indicator on the wrist console points you toward the
boss's location within the building. Along the way, you'll have to battle thugs
and hit men, avoid rats and explosive devices, and leap over holes in the floor.

 The current mission ends when you've dealt with the DOA boss, or when he
escapes, or when time runs out. At that point, you head back to V-MAX for the
next assignment. Your performances earn ratings -- from low-level Grunt to big
cheese Techno Cop.

 TECHNO COP is controlled with a joystick. When driving, the stick accelerates,
stops, steers, and accelerates while steering; the button fires V-MAX weapons.
When you're pounding the beat, the joystick walks Techno Cop left and right,
puts him into a crouch, jumps him left or right, and lets him enter elevators.
The spacebar toggles between Net and Gun, either of which can then be put into
use by a button press.

 TECHNO COP is one of the best games of the year. It looks great, sounds great,
and plays great. The graphics are bright and clear, and the animation is
wonderful, realistic, and occasionally hilarious. The thugs toss bombs and shoot
at you; they crack whips and throw axes. One of them is wearing a hockey mask;
this is either a joke, or Jason is branching out into new areas. The rats are
very large, and at least one DOA boss is in a wheelchair. Torture victims hang
by their heels from the ceilings; a punk with a nifty hairdo leaps from a truck;
the buildings are seedy and loaded with graffiti; and you can shoot the
civilians, although you'll lose points.

 TECHNO COP is sleazy and realistic, which is interesting because it is also
exaggerated and cartoonish. It's available in many versions. Buy it immediately,
but keep it away from small children.

 TECHNO COP is published and distributed by Epyx.
