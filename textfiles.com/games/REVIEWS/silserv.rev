 Several years ago, MicroProse released its first submarine
simulator, SILENT SERVICE. Aimed at the 8-bit machines of the time, 
SILENT SERVICE delivered a solid simulation, and some tense moments
for players. Since that time, technology has marched on. 16-bit
machines are the norm, with more memory, graphics, and sound
capabilities than ever before. MicroProse has turned to its classic
sub simulator for inspiration in creating a new game that takes
superb advantage of today's technology. SILENT SERVICE II provides
enormously enhanced graphics and sound, along with significantly
expanded play options, to deliver the best World War II sub
simulator on the market. (The IBM-PC version is the basis of this
review.) 

 In SILENT SERVICE II (SS2), you take the helm of one of several
U.S. subs that patrolled in the Pacific theater during World War
II. You may take a boat out on a single mission, a war patrol, or
embark on a complete war career. There are several missions to
choose from, all of which are drawn from actual historical
encounters. The war patrols allow you to choose a sector in the
Pacific theater to patrol. You encounter enemy ships more or less at
random, leading to a series of "missions" within a patrol. 

 The war career is new with SS2. In the war career, you pick a start
date, a sub type, and a home port. You play until the actual end of
the war (August, 1945), or until you are killed (a distressingly
common way to end the game). During the war, you choose patrol
areas, and then execute a standard war patrol. Each time you return
to port, you may choose a new sub and/or a new patrol area. 

 You may also switch ports as the war progresses. Your choice of
home port determines which areas you may patrol. Also, the available
ports change as the war progresses, following events as they
actually occurred. Finally, ports under different commands receive
new subs and equipment at different times. 

 As mentioned earlier, the course of the war affects the encounters
that you have. Encounters around major battle areas (such as the
Solomon Islands) usually involves well-escorted warships. Encounters
along shipping routes will likely involve supply ships and tankers. 
The quality of the Japanese ASW efforts also varies as the war
progresses, reflecting historical alterations in skill and
strategy. 

 Of course, all of this strategic maneuvering is really just
frosting on the cake. The heart of the game is the tactical
maneuvering within an encounter. As the sub captain, you are given
several screens to use in controlling your sub. This portion of the
game bears the closest resemblance to the original SILENT SERVICE. 
You have several screens that you move among to control various
functions of the sub. 

 The Map screen shows an overhead view of the area with four levels
of zoom. You can see your sub and the enemy ships you currently have
a lock on. Tracks are displayed to convey direction of movement and
relative speed. You'll use this screen to maneuver into a good
ambush position. 

 The Periscope provides a view of the surface, as long as you are no
more than 55 feet deep and the periscope is raised. Four levels of
zoom are supported here as well, and a close-up view of a nearby
Japanese Battleship is nothing less than spectacular. You may use
the TDC (targeting computer) on this screen to acquire targets. 
Generally, you will fire your torpedoes from this view. 

 The Bridge screen is available only when surfaced. It provides a
slightly wider view than the periscope, and also supports four
levels of zoom. You control the deck gun from this screen and may
also fire torpedoes. Note, however, that fighting the Japanese from
the surface is a sure way to cut your career short. 

 The Gauges show you vital data concerning your sub, including its
current speed, depth, the depth under keel, fuel and battery
levels, and torpedo load-out. The Damage screen details the
condition of each major sub component, as well as the total damage
to the sub. 

 Finally, there is a Captain's Log that provides information about
your sub and the current situation. This data includes the time of
day, the visibility, and the depth of water in the area. 

 As in the original SILENT SERVICE, your job is to be as sneaky as
possible, exercising caution and patience in prosecuting your
attacks. The impetuous go-for-broke Captain is likely to end up in
Davy Jones's locker for his efforts. Of course, some daring is
required, but SS2 rewards Captains who are selective in their
bravery. 

 In a typical SS2 mission, you'll try to position your sub ahead of
the enemy convoy. Then you'll submerge (if you haven't already) and
wait for the convoy to approach. Most convoys consist of escort
ships (Destroyers and Patrol Craft) and the primary targets
(non-escorts). Patience (and some nerve) is required as the convoy
escorts steam by. Then you raise the periscope and let the torpedoes
go. 

 This is usually followed by a crash dive, hard turn, and
acceleration to flank speed as the escorts turn back to your
position. At this point a game of naval cat and mouse ensues as the
escorts steam on the surface in rapid search patterns. If you are
unlucky (or inept), they will spot you and drop migraine-inducing
depth charges. These may cause small damage, or knock out a major
component, such as an engine. And, of course, they may actually sink
the sub straight off. 

 Unlike its predecessor, SS2 lets you use the thermal incline to try
and evade surface ships. In addition, a much greater variety of
Japanese ships is represented, with everything from Super
Battleships (like the Yamato) all the way down to small Patrol
Craft. In fact, one of the new challenges in SS2 is to prosecute
attacks against fast convoys that can simply steam away from you. 

 Japanese convoys tend to be a little smarter as well, using a
varied zigzag pattern and aggressive search patterns by the
escorts. Surface gunnery duels are now heavily slanted in favor of
the surface ships (as they should be). 

 The keyboard controls have been completely redesigned, and a
keyboard template is provided that maps all of the commands. New
commands include locking the TDC; rotating the periscope quickly, 
slowly, or 180 degrees; steering to view (and vice versa); and
rising to periscope depth (55 feet). The revamped controls should
feel much better to players of the old game. And players of other
MicroProse games (such as RED STORM RISING) should feel right at
home. 

 One note: The "time-lapsed replay" feature advertised on the game
box is not actually present in the game. It was left out due to
memory considerations. This feature would've been nice, but its loss
doesn't affect actual gameplay. 

 The graphic enhancements are simply stunning in VGA. Photographs
were taken of scale models of each type of Japanese ship. These
photos were digitized, and the images used with a 3-D algorithm to
realistically portray angles and degree of detail. Different levels
of visibility are realistically depicted: Players will find
themselves squinting through the murk trying to pick out enemy ships
at night, much as real sub Captains had to do at the time. 

 Some new animation has been provided, but the time to load and
display these is intrusive, so I always toggle them off before
play. Acceleration of game speed is now supported in _eight_ 
levels. This helps alleviate the tedium of those long end-arounds as
you maneuver your sub in front of a convoy. 

 The sounds have also been enhanced, with support for AdLib and
Roland boards. The disk-based copy protection has been eliminated
and the game employs a document-based scheme. Note that there is an
error in the manual, wherein the pictures for the large and small
freighters have been switched. SILENT SERVICE II supports VGA
(320x200x256), EGA (320x200x16), CGA (320x200x4), and Tandy graphics
modes. The joystick is supported, along with the keyboard. 

 SILENT SERVICE II comes on either 5-1/4" or 3-1/2" disks. The game
may be installed to your fixed disk, and in fact, you won't want to
play SS2 without a hard drive. One of the few negative features of
the game is a protracted loading cycle that takes about 3-5 minutes
on my 8Mhz machine. Fortunately, MPS coded a percentage-loaded
algorithm, so you can see that you're making progress (and not
merely locked up). 

 SILENT SERVICE 2 requires a full 640K, with 580K or more of
_available_ RAM if run in VGA mode. It will run in less, but minus
the ship pictures -- a definite problem. Many players will need to
create a clean boot disk to run SS2. 

 I found SS2 to be a delight to play. It captured what was fun in
the original, adding enough substance and style to grab my
interest. The addition of the full war career and various sub types
really raised the game to a new level. The manual by Arnold Hendrick
is superb, with plenty of background material and play description. 
Gameplay is tense and exciting, and the enhanced visuals pull
computer sub captains into the simulation like few other games can. 
I love the game, and recommend it to anyone with even a passing
interest in submarine warfare. 

 SILENT SERVICE II is published and distributed by MicroProse.
