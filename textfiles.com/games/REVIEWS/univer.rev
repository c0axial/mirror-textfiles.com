 UNIVERSE III is the second sequel in the UNIVERSE series from Omnitrend
Software, and it does not rely on either the heavy space-flight science of
UNIVERSE, or the job-oriented reality of UNIVERSE II. U3 is an adventure game
that offers fine graphics and animation, digitized sound effects, 70 areas to
explore, lots of characters and interaction, mouse/keyboard control, a save
option, and no copy protection. (This review is based on the Atari ST version.)

 The plot of U3 concerns a mission to Earth, which has not had a visitor from
the isolated Local Group in 300 years. As Captain Alexander Seward, you must
pilot the FWS Union to Ambergris in the Local Cluster, establish diplomatic
relations, and execute your mission orders. The problem is that there is a
traitor on your ship. An important passenger is murdered early on, and you're
next on the list.

 The ST graphics display consists of an animation window, where character
interaction, movement, and combat take place; a text window for descriptions and
information; and a series of function icons that provide directional movement,
inventory, and character status. There is a verb list, and an icon for using
ladders. There are four ways to move your character through the corridors and
rooms of the game: click on the directional arrows, trace a path, jump from room
to room, or use an object (such as a key).

 The thirteen verbs (Examine, Read, Ready, Wear, Enter, Order, etc.) allow
interaction with objects and other characters. Ten objects can be taken and
carried, used, or dropped; some need to be magnified before being used. A
mouse-click on certain shipboard devices or other characters brings up pictures
and more detailed text descriptions.

 U3 is controlled using either mouse or keyboard. Click the left button on a
function icon to invoke that function; a right click opens and closes doors, and
displays pictures of zoom-able characters or zoom-able items through either the
Inventory icon or the action screen. If your character is alone in a room or
corridor, you can trace a path for him to follow by: 1) holding the left button
down; 2) moving the pointer; and 3) releasing the button. The character then
moves promptly to the end of the path, which can also be traced around a corner.

 Keystrokes can be substituted for any of these mouse-invoked actions, and each
of the ST's ten Function keys has a use, such as Save Game, Toggle Sound and
Animation, and Exit.

 The UNIVERSE III package comes with two 720K disks that you can back up or copy
to a hard drive. A double-sided drive and color monitor are required. The brief
instruction manual brings the UNIVERSE story up to date, explains some things
about your mission (other important details are revealed in the game), and
describes all mouse and keyboard functions.

 UNIVERSE III is a solid and playable program, competently written; it's also a
welcome departure from the previous games in the series. The screen displays are
not as spectacular as in FIENDISH FREDDY or BATTLE CHESS, but they're well done
nonetheless: Items look like items, the characters are distinct individuals, and
anything not immediately comprehensible can be made so with a mouse-click.
Combat is animated, the text is spiced with dashes of humor, and there's a
running joke about robots and ghosts from a television program -- "Idiots in
Space" or something. The digitized sounds are effective and used sparingly.
Gameplay with either mouse or keyboard is effortless and easy to learn.

 The shipboard killer can be unmasked without much hassle, but the threads of
the plot really start to fray at the murder scene. Other characters are
necessary to solve certain puzzles. The game is smoothly paced, and punctuated
by bursts of action. There's nothing like a good mystery, and that's exactly
what UNIVERSE III is.

 UNIVERSE III is published and distributed by Omnitrend Software.
