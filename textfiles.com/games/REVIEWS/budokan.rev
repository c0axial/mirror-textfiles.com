 Electronic Arts has indeed captured the spirit of martial arts in BUDOKAN: THE
MARTIAL SPIRIT, combining all the elements needed to produce a fine game.
BUDOKAN brings practice, skill, cunning, and the true feel of competition to the
world of computers. (This review is based on the Sega Genesis version.)

 In BUDOKAN, you're a student who's studying four of the most deadly martial
arts. Mastering karate, bo, nunchaku, and kendo takes much time and patience.
Each art has over 25 unique moves that you can learn. At the start of the game,
you find yourself in the middle of the courtyard. Surrounding you are the dojos
in which you can practice the martial arts skills to be mastered. Every art has
its own dojo. While in the dojo, you have the option of practicing the moves
alone, or against a teacher. If you're sparring against a teacher, the teacher
will back off when he senses that you're growing tired. The instructors never
try to push you too far; remember, they're here to teach. At the end of each
sparring match, Tobiko-Sensei gives you helpful advice on your technique and
ablities. He often recommends ways in which you can improve your skills.

 When you tire of sparring with your teachers, you may go to the upper left of
the courtyard, where you'll find the free-spar mat. You can now face fellow
students of the same or different arts. Students will not be as easy as your
instructors: They do not back off if you tire. At the free-spar mat, you may
also spar with another player. This is a feature I really enjoy in the game.
Playing against a human opponent can be much more gratifying (at times) than
playing against the computer. When you're beaten, some words from the wise
Tobiko-Sensei might help to soothe your mood. At the top of the courtyard are
the Sensei's living quarters, where you may speak with him. Sensei will recount
numerous Japanese philosophies to you. This adds to the overall flavor of the
game.

 What is all this training leading up to? As you walk through the gates of the
dojo, you will board a train and be taken to the Budokan. Here at the Budokan,
you must show what you have learned in the dojo. People from around the world
gather at the Budokan to demonstrate what they know, and to see who is the most
skilled in the martial arts. There are several different arts you will find at
the Budokan. Most of the participants use weapons you have never seen at the
dojo. Tonfa, shuriken, and naginata are just a few of the arts you will come up
against.

 BUDOKAN comes with a very well-written manual. It offers you a brief history of
all the martial arts, including the ones you'll encounter at the Budokan. The
graphics and sound don't set any new standards in computer art and music, but
they work well with the game.

 Gameplay is wonderful: This is a program that should keep you busy for quite
some time. Controlling the character consists of occasionally _very_ complex
set-direction key moves and button pushes. Thus, I wouldn't recommend BUDOKAN to
someone who lacks good eye-hand coordination: Mastering the moves in each art
can be very difficult. (It takes practice, but it can be done.) All in all,
Electronic Arts has done a great job of capturing the martial spirit in BUDOKAN.

 BUDOKAN is published and distributed by Electronic Arts.
