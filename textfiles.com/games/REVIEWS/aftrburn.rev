 AFTER BURNER -- from Sega's "Arcade Hits" series -- takes just a
few seconds to figure out. Fly your plane, press one button for
bullets, another button for homing missiles, and keep firing. Anyone
can be a champ within minutes, which is probably why it was an
arcade hit. However, in this era of complex computer simulations
like THEIR FINEST HOUR: THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN and FLIGHT SIMULATOR
4, AFTER BURNER ranks as pretty simple stuff. (This review is based
on the IBM-PC version of the game; Amiga version notes follow.) 

 Basically, you get one view -- the rear-end of your F-14 jet
fighter -- which, I suppose, is where the name of the game comes
from. You have a square-shaped sight for firing bullets, and a
second sight appears when your radar has locked onto approaching
planes. Firing a homing missile when this sight appears practically
guarantees a hit. The targets are approaching enemy fighter jets and
radar planes. Beyond this, the main challenge is ducking oncoming
bullets and missiles. Speed is awkwardly controlled by holding down
both joystick buttons while pushing forward or pulling back on the
joystick. There is also a brief sequence for refueling and
restocking weapons. 

 AFTER BURNER comes on two copy-protected 5-1/4" diskettes. The game
can be installed on your hard disk, but since it uses the annoying
"key disk" copy protection scheme, you'll need to insert Disk "A" 
whenever you boot up the game. Documentation is minimal -- a single
sheet of 8-1/2" x 11" paper, folded in thirds. 

 The game supposedly offers support for CGA, MCGA, EGA, Tandy
16-color, and VGA (also only 16 colors). I couldn't spot any
difference between EGA and VGA modes. The screens on the rear of the
box accurately depict the game. 

 There's no support for any sound cards, but sound is limited to a
choice between some curiously inappropriate theme music and weak
explosions. Game play can be either with a joystick or from the
keyboard. 

 AFTER BURNER represents a good translation of a very basic arcade
game. Those who are looking for no more than that, or who find
today's state-of-the-art flight simulation programs too complex, 
will be satisfied with their purchase. However, gamers looking for
the feel and sound of the "real thing" are advised to look
elsewhere. 

 AMIGA VERSION NOTES 

 AFTER BURNER, an arcade hit, takes advantage of many of the Amiga's
capabilities. This is key when purchasing an arcade blockbuster
ported to the Amiga: Do the look, feel, and sound of the game come
reasonably close to the arcade version? If so, it's for the Amiga, 
and AFTER BURNER passes that test. 
  
 The colors are rich and full, the animation acceptably smooth, and
there is pleasant stereo theme music. The sound effects could be a
little better, but they aren't bad. On the arcade version of AFTER
BURNER, a voice screams "Firing!" when you squeeze the trigger, 
followed by the thunderous explosion of a direct hit. There aren't
any voice sound loops in the Amiga version, but all the other sound
effects seem intact, including nicely done explosions and a tone
that alerts the pilot to the presence of a "locked on" target. 

 The game is so easy to start and play that a seven-year-old can
manage it without tips from his parents or consulting the
brochure-sized documentation. There isn't any off-disk copy
protection, although there is on-disk protection. The game will run
on A500s, A1000s, and A2000s with at least 512K of RAM. 

 AFTER BURNER is as basic a game for the Amiga as it is in the
arcade. It's a simple shoot-'em-up, and although the game is well
done for the Amiga, it's unlikely that AFTER BURNER will hold the
attention of many gamers above age ten or so. 

 AFTER BURNER is published and distributed by Sega of America.
