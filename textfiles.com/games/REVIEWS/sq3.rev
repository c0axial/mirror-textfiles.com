
 SPACE QUEST III: THE PIRATES OF PESTULON

 When we last left our hero, Roger Wilco, he had just succeeded in foiling the
treacherous Sludge Vohaul's plans to flood the universe with Insurance Salesmen.
(Play SPACE QUEST II for all the details.) After dispatching Vohaul and
terminating the launch of the Salesmen, Roger outfoxes the merciless
Marrow-matic and reaches an escape pod. As the asteroid containing Vohaul's
headquarters self-destructs, our brave little janitor hurtles spaceward,
relaxing in the knowledge that the Universe is safe once more. And with his
extraordinary adventures seemingly at an end, Roger falls into a deep sleep.
Deeper than he'd probably anticipated: The escape pod's circuitry puts Roger
into suspended animation. The pod drifts aimlessly, lost in space....

 But the adventure has only just begun. A passing garbage freighter vacuums up
the pod, and Roger comes back to consciousness in the hold of the enormous ship.
And as SPACE QUEST III: THE PIRATES OF PESTULON begins, Roger is faced with the
prospect of permanent entrapment. Meanwhile, in other parts of the galaxy, a
malevolent finance company begins to search for our hero. And The Two Guys from
Andromeda, game authors and really swell fellas, are kidnapped by the pirates of
vicious Scumsoft (a software firm). All these events will tie together in
Roger's silliest, weirdest adventure yet. (This review is based on the IBM-PC
version; Atari ST and Amiga version notes follow.)

 SQ3 is also Roger's easiest adventure, at least from the player's standpoint.
If you're not familiar with the workings of a Sierra animated adventure, the
format is simple. You control an on-screen character (in this case, Roger Wilco)
as you move him from room to room. In each room, there are things to be explored
or manipulated, which is accomplished by typing in your commands. The program
will respond either by carrying out your command, or commenting on it with
phrases such as "There's no need to do that." At times, you'll find yourself
with apparently nothing left to do; that usually means you've missed an
opportunity somewhere along the way. You'll die a thousand deaths, but you can
save and restore your games-in-progress, eliminating the need to restart every
time you play. A running total of your score gives you an idea of how you're
doing.

 Actually, this is a marvelous introduction for newcomers to Sierra's games.
There are few objects to be manipulated, and since some puzzles have more than
one solution, there's little likelihood you'll find yourself hopelessly stuck. I
usually consider Sierra games quite difficult, needing a couple of weeks (or
more) to finish a KING'S QUEST, POLICE QUEST, or SPACE QUEST. But I completed
SQ3 in under 8 hours, and would have taken even less time if not for the
numerous arcade sequences. Most Sierra titles have at least one such mandatory
arcade segment; SQ3 has several, and they're tougher than usual. So tough, in
fact, that non-fans of arcade games may find themselves in trouble. One of the
three is not strictly necessary for finishing the game, but it's a major source
of points for those who like to complete their games with a full score.

 At the same time, SQ3 is a striking cinematic experience. The fourth game to be
released in Sierra's higher-resolution SCI graphics (320x200 in 16 colors), SQ3
offers dozens of animated sequences, close-ups, and other delightful visual
touches. Highlights are the dramatic spacescapes, such as the scene in which the
colossal garbage freighter snags Roger's ship during the prologue, the volcanic
backgrounds of the planet Ortega, and the approach to Monolith Burgers ("A
finite number served"). On the flip-side, there are many wonderful close-ups --
the Terminator's grim face as a monitor's display is reflected in his
sunglasses, the comical aliens who work at World O' Wonders and Monolith, and
Roger himself. Other wonderful visual details: The quivering green Jell-O used
by Scumsoft's security devices, the accounting department at Scumsoft, and the
superb incorporation of shadows -- especially in the junk ship.

 Another cinematic aspect of the game is the incredible music score by Bob
Siebenberg of the rock group Supertramp. On an IBM-PC equipped with the Roland
MT-32 sound card (available through Sierra or other Roland dealers), the music
is phenomenal: rich, exciting, atmospheric, and plentiful. The card also
enhances Mark Siebert's sound effects. Other sound configurations, such as the
AdLib Music Synthesizer and the IBM-PC Music Feature card, will yield a less
complex soundtrack. Using the default sound (IBM's standard speaker), the music
was sometimes minimally effective, but more often than not, it was grating: The
barnyard music of the Astro Chicken arcade sequence, for example, was amusing
for the first 30 seconds or so, and then became wretchedly tiresome. But other
occasions, such as the squawking World O' Wonders theme song, are deserving of
repeat play just to hear the music.

 The program's vocabulary and parser represent an improvement over past SPACE
QUESTs, but both still need work. For example, SIT or SIT ON SEAT may not be
understood, but GET ON SEAT is. The program also lacks the ability to help you
rephrase; if your input isn't understood, you may not have a clue as to what to
try next. Often, the more vague the command you use, the better the chances are
it'll work. I found that a command such as "USE LADDER" worked better than more
explicit commands, such as SET UP LADDER, PUT UP LADDER, or STAND UP LADDER.
There's also some confusion early on, when you're in a number of screens jammed
with assorted junk. If you don't know what an object is, you're at a
disadvantage when it comes to EXAMINING that object. Sometimes EXAMINE OBJECT
works, sometimes it doesn't. There are other commands that only work on specific
screens.

 While SQ3 is clearly technically outstanding, it may not provide you with quite
as much entertainment as other Sierra games. Because there are relatively few
puzzles, you can expect to finish the game quickly. You may want to review and
retry certain amusing sequences, and if you have a sound card, you might play it
through numerous times just to enjoy the music. But if you prefer a complex,
challenging quest on the order of a KING'S QUEST game, SQ3 may prove a little
thin for your tastes.

 The IBM-PC version of SQ3 includes both 5-1/4" and 3-1/2" disk formats, an
installation guide for IBMs, a manual with more game information (and an
assortment of computer-specific details), catalog, and sound card brochures. The
game is not copy-protected and can be installed easily on a hard drive.

 If you've never played one of Sierra's SCI games, be forewarned that PCs and
XTs may have trouble running them at an acceptable speed: 8 MHz or more is
strongly recommended. Your IBM, Tandy, or MS-DOS compatible will need 512K and a
CGA, EGA, VGA, Hercules, Tandy Graphics, or MCGA (PS/2) card. PCjrs can
apparently run the game if the system has 640K. Mouse and joystick are also
supported, but if you're a good typist, the keyboard is just as good as other
peripherals for total control.

 There's a lot to enjoy in SQ3, but you'll spend more time being an amused
spectator and less time tearing your hair out. For me, it was a welcome change;
Sierra's games tend to drive me to distraction. SQ3 is the easiest Sierra game
since LEISURE SUIT LARRY IN THE LAND OF THE LOUNGE LIZARDS, but it's also an
audio-visual feast -- a charming and wonderful piece of entertainment. So far,
there's been no announcement of a SPACE QUEST IV. But based on Mark Crowe and
Scott Murphy's work on the SPACE QUEST series, I'll take a chance on anything
they produce -- SPACE QUEST or otherwise.

 ATARI ST VERSION NOTES

 The Atari ST version of SPACE QUEST III: THE PIRATES OF PESTULON looks great,
sounds great, is not particularly difficult, and, like all Sierra programs, is
as much fun to watch as it is to play. The graphic and animation displays on the
ST are of cartoon quality, and it's safe to say that Sierra knows how to use
film devices.

 You'll need 512K and a double-sided disk drive. SQ3 is not copy-protected and
can be installed on a hard drive. This device significantly speeds up the
loading of new screens -- a process that is nearly interminable from a floppy
drive. If you have a single-sided disk drive, you can get single-sided disks
from Sierra, but you'll have to buy the game first. Even then, it'll cost you
$10 and the coupon from the package.

 SQ3 offers MIDI support for Casio CZ-101 and Roland MT-32 synthesizers. I
tested the MIDI option with a Casio 230S (an enhancement on the CZ-101), and it
certainly livened up Bob Siebenberg's musical score.

 Visual and audio wonders notwithstanding, this is a relatively easy Sierra
adventure. Veteran gamers could bypass SQ3, save $50, and not miss a great deal.
ST users who are new to their machine and to Sierra's excellent work, will be
thrilled by the superb graphics and sound, as well as delighted with the
silliness of those "Two Guys From Andromeda."

 AMIGA VERSION NOTES

 Sierra has finally finished its SCI system for the Amiga. This means we can
expect a rapid release of all of Sierra's latest games now, starting with SPACE
QUEST III, the first SCI game to be released for the Amiga.

 The disks (four of them) can be copied, and are easily installed on a hard
drive. In fact, if you don't have a hard drive, I recommend you exercise caution
when purchasing the new generation of Sierra products. There are many disk
swaps, and the games are not designed to take advantage of anything other than
the internal floppy drive and the hard disk. If you don't mind the constant disk
swapping, the game interface is otherwise identical to the IBM-PC version.

 Compared to the typical Amiga release, the graphics are nothing spectacular,
and the sound is about average. However, the linking of sound effects and music
to scene and animation sequences is thoroughly and effectively executed.

 The menu/mouse interface is easy to use, but unusually slow; it's clear this is
a direct conedition of the IBM-PC version's interface. And it seems that
virtually nothing has been done to make special use of the Amiga's unique
windowing abilities.

 Recently, there's been a dearth of adventure games for the Amiga. Sierra's
products are unequaled in depth, wittiness, and originality. Even though SPACE
QUEST III is one of Sierra's shortest adventures, the gameplay is excellent. The
Amiga version of SPACE QUEST III offers no ground-breaking technological
goodies, but there's plenty to get excited about in terms of Sierra's reentry
into the Amiga marketplace.

 SPACE QUEST III: THE PIRATES OF PESTULON is published and distributed by Sierra
On-Line, Inc.
