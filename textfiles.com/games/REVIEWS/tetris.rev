
 TETRIS

 Detente lives! At least in the form of Spectrum HoloByte's TETRIS (The Soviet
Challenge). TETRIS, which has been described as the "Rubik's Cube" of computer
games, is brought to us through the combined efforts of AcademySoft in Moscow,
Andromeda Software Ltd. in London, and Spectrum HoloByte in the USA. This review
is based on the Macintosh version; Apple II/IIgs and Atari ST version notes
follow.

 One might very well suspect our Russian comrades of ulterior motives in
releasing this game to the West, because its addictive properties were enough to
make my brother forgo his weekly fix of "L.A. Law" in an effort to beat my high
score. Quick fingers and a quick mind are required to succeed at TETRIS.

 You could call TETRIS something of an animated jigsaw puzzle, but it's much
more than that. The parts of the puzzle are little four-square pieces that range
in size and shape from 2x2 squares, to 1x4 rectangles, to more complicated
configurations. As the game begins, these pieces fall from the top of the
screen, one by one. Before they reach bottom, you must manipulate them so that
they interlock without leaving any gaps. Using the keyboard, you can rotate the
pieces and move them to the left or right in an attempt to fill the remaining
gaps.

 Whenever you succeed in filling an entire row without gaps, that row drops off
the bottom of the screen. As soon as you have completed a certain number of
rows, you advance to the next level. Should you fail to fill any rows properly
(or fail to fill them quickly enough), the pieces will continue to descend until
there's no space left on the screen for new pieces to fit. At this point, the
game ends.

 As you see, the premise of the game is fairly simple, but this rather dry
description fails to convey the true tension and challenge of the game. As your
level increases, so does the speed at which the pieces fall. By the 10th level,
you're pretty much at a loss, unless you have the manual dexterity of a
professional pianist. Speaking of music, the Russian folk tunes and compositions
that accompany each level are incredibly well done. (Listen to them through an
external speaker to fully appreciate the music!) As your speed increases, so
does the tempo, which definitely adds to the fast and furious pace of the last
few levels.

 The background graphics are painstakingly detailed, and a wonder to behold on
the Mac II's color screen; even on a plain Mac Plus they're terrific. The
alternating scenes depict various aspects of Russian life, from farming and
hockey to the manned space launches.

 There are a number of game options that offer more challenging variations, such
as Advanced Mode, and the ability to increase the number of rows present on the
opening screen. In addition, there's a Tournament Mode, in which the computer
keeps track of the exact sequence of falling shapes so that each competitor can
play under equal conditions, with the exact same pieces.

 The game package also includes a TETRIS desk accessory. Although the DA lacks
sound, background graphics, and a few other features, the puzzle is identical in
all other respects. Now you can play a quick game of TETRIS while...ahh, waiting
for your...um, spreadsheet to...uh, let's see...recalc! (Yeah, that's the
ticket.)

 During gameplay itself, I could detect no bugs. However, there were a few times
when the scoreboard would "forget" certain high scores I had previously entered.
I tried to get Spectrum HoloByte to comment on the anomaly, but as of this
writing, they hadn't responded. This is a rather minor problem, though, and it
doesn't in any way interfere with my enjoyment of the program.

 TETRIS is a great game for anyone who enjoys addictive puzzles, excellent
graphics, fast-paced arcade action, and Russian music -- not necessarily in that
order!

 APPLE II AND IIGS VERSION NOTES

 Spectrum HoloByte was extremely considerate: They included versions of TETRIS
for all Apple II series computers in one package. The 5-1/4" disk comes with a
hi-res version for the old II and II+, and a double-hi-res version for the 128K
IIe and IIc. The 3-1/2" version is for the IIgs.

 The lower resolution versions lack sound; otherwise, all Apple versions play
exactly like the Macintosh program, with one addition: You can use a joystic
Personally, I preferred the keyboard.

 TETRIS on the IIgs makes me glad I have my computer. Wonderful music, superb
background pictures, and adherence to "human interface" standards result in an
outstanding game -- it's addicting!

 A word of caution: The IIgs version I received had some bugs. The game wouldn't
support desk accessories, occasionally crashed when "Quit" was selected, and
crashed spectacularly when the Tournament option was engaged. One other
difference: There is no TETRIS Desk Accessory in this version.

 Overall, this game is as good on a IIgs as on a Macintosh (in my humble
opinion). Give it a 9 out of 10 and a permanent place on my hard drive --
especially since it's not copy-protected!

 ATARI ST VERSION NOTES

 Although the Atari ST version of TETRIS differs in minor ways from other
versions, one thing remains unchanged: the game itself. The Russian music and
the graphic pictures of Soviet life are fine, but are so completely unnecessary
that they vanish. All that matters is TETRIS, which is one of the most addictive
puzzles you're going to find...in any country. The game is so incredibly easy to
grasp and becomes such an obsession, that it simply _must_ be a subversive trick
of _glasnost_.

 There is no desk accessory in the ST version, and the disks are File and
Options Menus, which can be effected with keystrokes. The keystrokes needed to
control the game are but a handful, and they work perfectly.

 The ST version runs on any ST with 512K (including the Mega series) and a color
monitor. A second disk drive is supported. Although the bells and whistles are
useful for nothing more than a price increase, ST owners cannot afford to bypass
TETRIS. It's too good to miss.

 TETRIS is published and distributed by Spectrum HoloByte.
