 For a 14-year-old, finding just the right game can be a very tough job,
especially on a limited budget. While browsing through SDA's online catalogs
recently, I noticed the oddest title I'd ever seen: TONGUE OF THE FATMAN. I'm
glad I took a chance and ordered the game, because when the package arived, I
discovered what must be one of the most unique game packages yet. (This review
is based on the IBM-PC version.)

 TONGUE OF THE FATMAN is an action/arcade game from Activision that introduces
you to the Intergalactic Wrestling Federation. Set well into the future, the
scenario involves an Intergalactic "Fight Palace," where various alien creatures
battle for profit. This particular Fight Palace is ruled by an extremely large
creature known as Mondu the Fat. You're a newcomer pitted against ruthless
opponents who are controlled by the computer (or a friend, in two-player mode).
Eventually, if you're good enough, you'll face Mondu himself.

 As you load the game, Mondu appears on the screen in all his fantastic graphic
glory. You then select your character from three distinct beings. (There are ten
beings in all, but you have to defeat a few opponents before you can send out
the more unique and distinctive characters.) Each being employs unique styles of
punching, kicking, and jumping; also, each one has a Special Move, ranging from
"The Pea Shooter" to "The Gasser." Next, a second delightful graphic display
presents you with a Gremlin-type creature who allows you to place your bets
and/or change the odds. You make money in TONGUE by betting on how long it'll
take you to beat your computer- or human-controlled opponent. In order to help
defeat your rival, you can then visit Dr. Kadaver's, where various weapons and
gadgets are for sale -- from the MultiMax Steroids that increase the power of
your Special Move, to Grasfur Slug Eggs to keep your opponent down on the
ground. After you're satisfied with all selections, you're off to the Arena.
 The "combat system" in TONGUE OF THE FATMAN is not particularly sophisticated,
which means it's designed for beginning and expert action/arcade gamers alike.
As the battle begins, both combatants stroll to the center of the Arena. On the
bottom of the screen are displays that monitor your character: Three colored
bars represent the extent to which you're winning (offensiveness), how many "hit
points" remain, and how much damage you inflict with each blow. There is also an
indication of which weapons you possess and whether they're currently in effect.
Your characters can execute a wide range of moves to use in conjuction with
their weapons: forward flips, throws, back flips, punches, and more. If you
defeat your opponent, you'll automatically receive a purse that contains the
winnings from your wager. Then it's on to another opponent and yet another
battle....

 The IBM-PC version of TONGUE requires 512K RAM and a color monitor. It supports
CGA, EGA, VGA (256 colors), MCGA (256 colors, requires 640K), and Tandy 16-color
graphics. VGA or MCGA is recommended, but the EGA screens also look good. Roland
MT-32 and Ad-Lib Music Cards are supported, as well. A joystick is optional.

 TONGUE OF THE FATMAN is a great game for fans of arena combat, wrestling,
arcade games, and all-around weirdness. The graphics are absolutely stunning and
keep pace very well with the action-packed animation of your creature. Some of
the game's Special Moves are downright hilarious -- as are some of the
characters themselves. Sound effects intensify the action, providing a realistic
background for your agressive moves: You'll hear a distinct "crunch" as you
throw your opponent to the ground and stomp on his head (or whatever that is),
and a curdling "ARRRGGGGHHHH!" when you deliver the final blow that seals your
opponent's fate. Regardless of your gaming preferences, you're sure to find this
one a winner!

 TONGUE OF THE FATMAN is published by Activision and distributed by Mediagenic.
