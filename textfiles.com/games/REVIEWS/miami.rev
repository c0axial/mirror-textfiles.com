
 MIAMI VICE

 MIAMI VICE is an action/arcade game designed and programmed by Richard
Leinecker, and published and distributed by IntraCorp under the Capstone label.
Based on the formerly trendy TV series, VICE offers fine graphics and animation,
eight scenarios, four levels of difficulty, joystick control, and copy
protection. The Atari ST version requires 512K and a color monitor, and is the
basis of this review.

 VICE is really two types of games. In the two-character games (Warehouse, Dock,
Stiltsville, Final Assault), you'll control both Crockett and Tubbs, who must
battle villains and obstacles as you guide them to an exit; in the vehicle games
(Car Chase, Boat Chase, Plane Chase, Parachute), you'll control the vehicle, and
attempt either to withstand or avoid various kinds of attacks. You'll be dealing
with Dobermans, bombs, high-speed cars and boats, obstacles in Biscayne Bay,
other planes and weather balloons, and lots of criminals from the drug trade.

 Each scenario must be completed before moving on to the next. Assuming you
complete all eight, you'll be awarded a Medal of Service and begin again in the
first scenario, at a higher level of difficulty.

 The ST graphics display consists of action screen, lives-remaining icons (for
two-character games) or damage graphs (for vehicle games), score, and three
blank shields, each of which becomes a Medal of Service when you've completed
the eight scenarios.

 In VICE, all characters and vehicles are controlled by the joystick. The stick
alone moves them left and right, lets them climb ladders, kneel, stand, and aim
their guns (which the button will fire); the Spacebar toggles joystick control
between Crockett and Tubbs. In the vehicle games, the stick accelerates,
decelerates, and moves the car and the speedboat left and right; on the plane,
the stick is used for left/right movement and altitude adjustments, rather than
speed control.

 The MIAMI VICE package comes with two copy-protected disks, an instruction
manual, and a Code Card used as an additional form of copy protection.

 In stark contrast to Crockett's pastel fashion statements and the sunny climes
of Florida, the noir-ish "Miami Vice" TV series was bleak and dismal, populated
by scumbag characters and unsavory rock stars on hiatus from vid-studio
lip-synch sessions. VICE looks good on the ST, although the bright and cheery
visuals seem at odds with both the bleakness of the TV program and the game's
drug-drenched plot. This is merely an observation, not a complaint; the graphics
are just fine. The animation routines are good, too -- if a bit jumpy at times.

 In theory, patience and determination can solve the most difficult game (even
the incredible NEVERMIND). In reality, MIAMI VICE takes the
patience/determination maxim and rips it to pieces, making for a game that's
impossible to play well. The graphics and animation are competent and well-done;
there are neat onscreen details, the action-packed storyline that drives the
scenarios is straight from the tube, and the joystick is the right controller.
So what's the problem here?

 Good question. I simply could not get anywhere with this game; what's more,
when I did get somewhere, I felt as though I'd used up each and every ounce of
game-iness that's in me. No one's perfect at the arcade every day, but I booted
VICE and fumbled through it so many times that I don't think my poor performance
was the result of ineptitude (although that certainly is a possibility).

 The way to beat a screen is either so obvious that it blew right past me, or so
clever that it's out of range of whatever it is that inspires me. In other
words, MIAMI VICE seemed far more difficult than it should have been, especially
since there are thirty-two levels. In fairness to programmer Richard Leinecker
and IntraCorp, VICE is a decent game and I won't suggest that you avoid it. A
playtest, however, is a must.
