
 STARFLIGHT

 When I first played STARFLIGHT, I was awed. Even after multiple restarts,
mistakes (on my part, I assure you!), and calamities, the game has never
frustrated me. Indeed, the level of playability is astounding. At last, here is
a computer role-playing game that doesn't force you to resort to hack-and-slash
to gain knowledge and experience. Quite the contrary: You're encouraged to deal
peaceably with beings you encounter, for they hold vital clues that aid you in
your quest to save Arth and the surrounding star systems. (This review is based
on the IBM-PC version; Amiga version notes follow.)

 Something has caused the sun of your solar system to become unstable, and its
explosion is imminent. The plot of STARFLIGHT is based on exploration and
discovery. Your initial mission is to locate Endurium (starship fuel), and
habitable planets for your doomed home planet to colonize. As the story unfolds
and the urgency to leave Arth increases, you're sent to locate minerals to
supply Arth's spaceship builders with the raw materials they need. Strange
messages are intercepted and passed to you regarding lost civilizations, alien
activities (both hostile and benign), artifacts, and strange "fluxes" in the
fabric of space.

 The further you dare to venture into the surrounding systems, the more
information you glean, until you suddenly realize that all the solar systems'
suns are becoming unstable! And only by learning to deal with the alien beings
you meet will you learn the secret behind this disturbance, and how to stop the
destruction of the known universe.

 You manage a six-man crew whom you select (from a menu of six races), name, and
train in various capabilities. You are equipped with the bare essentials and
12,000 credits with which to buy an initial fuel supply, make moderate ship
improvements, and perhaps train a crew member or two. A visit to the Bank (which
pays interest!) lists your transactions and balance. Communications has
important information regarding goals, missions, discoveries by other star
pilots, etc.

 The beauty of STARFLIGHT is in its playability. Whether you do or don't save
Arth, you may continue exploring the star systems (as long as you're able to
find Endurium). And if you do manage to solve the game, your rewards from a
grateful civilization allow you to play ad infinitum!

 All input to the game -- including communications with the aliens you meet --
is handled through menu selections. Movement is controlled by the arrow keys.
Because of the ease of play, you won't even need to read the instruction booklet
that comes with the game. If you're like me, you'll just want to get started on
STARFLIGHT and read the documentation later. Sooner or later, though, you ought
to read the manual to learn more about this fascinating game; in fact, you can
obtain some necessary insights into the different races only by doing so.

 STARFLIGHT's graphics are very good. I played the game on both a color and a
monochrome PC; there's no degradation in detail when the game is played in
monochrome, although it's a bit difficult to discern topographical map details.
There are sound effects you can toggle. My monochrome PC doesn't have sound
capabilities, but I didn't find the sound effects necessary.

 STARFLIGHT is distributed on two floppy disks, one of which is completely
filled. Small wonder, too: STARFLIGHT seems huge. With over 800 planets to
explore, you really _do_ feel as if you're exploring the entire universe!

 The program is not copy-protected (a plus for hard drive owners). Off-disk
protection is handled via a Codewheel and a random set of parameters that
generate a number code. It's easy, simple, and it works. If you take a stab at
entering the number code when it's asked for, you can still leave the starport,
but all sorts of nasty things will happen to you in a short while.

 Game saves take a long time on a floppy system, due to the fact that you have
to copy both diskettes. Playing from a hard drive, though, the saving is a bit
faster, since you simply copy your STARFLIGHT sub-directory to your Save
sub-directory. Note also that you cannot stop the game without going through the
save game routine. Doing a simple "Quit" destroys the current game, at which
point you'll either have to start from scratch or restore a previous game. This
is the only drawback I've found in STARFLIGHT, but there have been reports of
the game hanging up during planetary operations. By the time you read this,
Binary Systems may have corrected these and other problems reported by
STARFLIGHT players.

 The game package includes two floppy diskettes, documentation booklet,
Codewheel, and a full color Starchart for interstellar navigation. Full color is
supported on composite monitors, but you'll see only the typical four-color
palette in CGA mode. There are patch files available in the library of The
Gamers' Forum that allow you to invoke a full 16-color CGA palette.

 I highly recommend STARFLIGHT to everyone, including WIZARDRY and ULTIMA fans.
Binary Systems: Encore!

 AMIGA VERSION NOTES

 The Amiga version of STARFLIGHT is well worth playing. It isn't a traditional
CRPG perhaps, but it's a very intriguing and rewarding Star-Trek-type of
adventure. You literally _do_ go "where no man has gone before."

 STARFLIGHT is primarily a game of search and discover. It includes some rather
slow graphic displays of the planets you may land on, but this feature can be
turned off, which improves game speed considerably. Do watch this scenario at
least once: The fractual display of a revolving planet, and the planet's
features that come into perspective, are well worth seeing -- despite the time
involved.

 I understand that there've been no graphic improvements over the IBM version,
but I was favorably impressed anyway. The opening title screen and accompanying
music are more than adequate. Starport, where you begin the game, is a very
pleasant method of performing "housekeeping" chores (creating characters,
getting messages, repairing and supplying your ship, buying and selling trade
items, etc.).

 You maneuver a well-drawn, spacesuit-clad animated figure around a nicely
depicted circular star port. The doors all lead to different "housekeeping"
options. The center of the starport is a transport to your ship. You watch (and
hear) the character (representing your team) dissolve in the transport.

 When you land on a planet, you maneuver a terrain vehicle (overhead view of an
icon on variable-colored terrain) over mountainous regions (white), water
(blue), etc. STARFLIGHT can be played exclusively via the mouse, and although
some of the control features are not common in Amiga games, you'll adjust
quickly, finding the interface very pleasant to use indeed. For example, "Cruise
Control" allows you to click on the direction in which you want your spaceship
to travel; the ship will head that way automatically until you turn off the
control.

 This version runs on the Amiga 500, 1000, or 2000; it requires 512K of RAM and
a color monitor. There's no on-disk copy protection, but you do have to refer to
an included code wheel. You'll also need a blank diskette in order to make a
copy of the master disk.

 Although the middle section tends to bog down a bit (while you're exploring
without knowing where to go), STARFLIGHT on the whole is very enjoyable, and I
recommend it to all who enjoy quests of exploration and discovery.

 STARFLIGHT is published by Binary Systems and distributed by Electronic Arts.
