DRAGON LORD: IBM VERSION NOTES

     The IBM version of Dragon Lord is an overall success.  The VGA graphics
definitely live up to the Amiga screen shots, and the Ad-Lib soundtrack is
impressive (though not overly so).  The interface for the most part is smooth,
provided you use a mouse or joystick.  (I highly recommend using one of them
rather than the keyboard)

     The IBM Version of Dragon Lord supports Hercules Graphics, CGA, EGA, Tandy
16-Color, VGA, Ad-Lib, Joystick, and Mouse.  512K is required to run the game
which comes on either four 5 1/4 disks or two 3 1/2 disks.

     The Game comes with the original Dragon Lord manual with game instruction
and Amiga information.  An small sheet is included with the technical
information on the IBM version.  Besides the manual and tech reference card, a
fold out chart of spell effects, and a spell book is included.

     The copy protection is in the simple form of a question, which you need the
spell book to answer.  (Enter page X, Line Y, Word Z of the Spell book)  However
the one annoying aspect of it is the fact that if you fail 4 times, it freezes
your system; forcing you to re-boot.  The spell effect tables are also needed at
all times if you are going to successfully play the game, a major part of it
being the creation of new spells.

     The optional arcade sequences for the most part are smooth enough, but
joystick control could be a little more sensitive.  The IBM version for the most
part is very good, and lives up to the reputation the Amiga and Atari ST
versions have earned.

DRAGON LORD was created by Palace Software and is distributed by Cinemaware.
