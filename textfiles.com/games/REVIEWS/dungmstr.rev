 Have you ever felt that some computer role-playing games with
extensive graphics put too much into the graphics and not much into
the game? Yes, they looked pretty, but became boring quickly, as
there was little relationship between how nice the pictures looked
and how well the game played. If you've shared this feeling, relief
is here in the form of DUNGEON MASTER from FTL Games. A computer
RPG, DUNGEON MASTER was initially released for the Atari ST (the
version upon which this review is based; Apple IIgs version notes
follow). 

 The plot of DUNGEON MASTER is relatively simple. You are the
Theron, apprentice to the Grey Lord, sent by your mentor to find the
Firestaff hidden within the dungeon. You, as Theron Lord, first must
enter the Hall of Champions (the first level of the dungeon) and
find four champions to be your party. The champions are pre-created
characters who are in mirrors in the Hall. There are 24 champions in
all. Each champion has a name, at least one class, and several
physical attributes. You can resurrect a champion, which means that
the champion comes into your party exactly as shown, or you can
reincarnate a champion, meaning tht you can give the champion a new
name and optional title. The champion won't have any skills if you
reincarnate him, but he will have better physical attributes. The
available classes are Fighter, Ninja, Wizard, and Priest. The
champions can be neophytes, novices, apprentices, or journeymen in
any of the classes. Most champions start with more than one class. 

 The dungeon contains monsters, traps, doors, levers, and an
assortment of other items to work with while you are exploring. You
can map or not, as you like. Mapping will make your journey easier, 
but will slow game play. Also (at least on the upper levels), there
isn't a way to find out exactly where you are in the dungeon. 

 The dungeon graphics are simple, but important (you actually SEE
keyholes in the walls). Using the mouse, you can take a key from a
champion's pack and insert it into the keyhole. 

 The mouse is used extensively throughout the game: to transfer
items between characters quickly and efficiently, to move around
(although the keyboard can be used to do this, too), and for
combat. 

 Combat is in real time. When you see monsters in the square in
front of you, you can select a champion's weapon from a menu and
then choose the action the champion will take (usually Parry, Chop, 
or Melee). The monsters attack while you make your selections, so it
pays to be quick with the mouse. There is no set combat sequence; 
everyone fights when able to do so. The monsters can run from you, 
and you can run from the monsters. "Hit and run" tactics work well, 
as monsters don't regenerate points they've lost when you attack, 
retreat, and re-engage. They will chase you, however, so you need to
retreat to a truly safe place to rest. 

 DUNGEON MASTER's magic system is unique. Instead of a spell list, 
there are magic symbols that are combined to create spells. Priests
can cast spells into potions for later use; wizard spells dissipate
as soon as the spell is cast. Scrolls scattered about the dungeon
tell which symbols create which spells, and you can also experiment
with the symbols to create your own spells. Most characters have
"mana" (spell points) that are spent when casting spells and that
recover through time. 

 Game play is excellent. You feel as if you are actually in a real
dungeon, instead of just plugging away at a computer. FTL has done
everything possible to minimize the computer interface. Because of
the real-time combat and graphics, tactics (such as hit and run) 
that you can't use in other computer RPGs are possible here. The
puzzles are interesting, and become tougher as you go deeper into
the dungeon. The graphics are excellent, although DUNGEON MASTER
doesn't offer the number of pictures that other games for the
68000-based machines do. The game is of limited scope (there's only
the one dungeon), but the one dungeon is very well done. Highly
recommended! 

 APPLE IIGS VERSION NOTES 

 The Apple IIgs version of DUNGEON MASTER works exactly as above, 
and offers superb sound and graphics. Game play is sluggish, and the
animation of attacking monsters is choppy, but this game is _far_ 
better than any other dungeon RPG ever published for the Apple. 
There is a strong feeling that you're looking through a window, 
rather than at a monitor screen. 

 FTL games has pushed the IIgs flat out to provide a stunning
experience. Origin, Sir-Tech, New World Computing, Interplay: This
is how it should be done. I give DUNGEON MASTER a 10 out of 10 and a
standing ovation! 

 DUNGEON MASTER is published and distributed by FTL Games.
