 BATTLETECH is one of Infocom's new generation of games. Previously
limited to a selection of about two dozen text adventures (usually
of exceptional quality) and a smattering of others, Infocom has
turned to graphics and role-playing scenarios as a means of
expanding the company's stagnating customer base. 

 I awaited the release of BATTLETECH (reviewed here on the IBM) with
much anticipation; upon playing it, I was simultaneously impressed
and disappointe Named for the RPG of the same title, BATTLETECH is
not the deluxe, ground-breaking type of game many of us have come to
expect from Infocom. Nevertheless, it is a good introductory CRPG
and offers many pleasing features. 

 One of the more noteworthy aspects of the game is the BattleMech, 
an enormous, articulated warrior robot available in many different
configurations. Each BattleMech (called a 'Mech) seats two; they
look much like the robots featured in Japanese animation, and indeed
there is a definite Japanese influence present throughout the
program. The story itself is presented in a literate and
entertaining manner. 

 You are cast in the role of Jason Youngblood, the last of the
Youngbloods (pioneers in the history of the galaxy). As the
adventure begins, you are about to begin your training as a 'Mech
warrior. Part way through the training course, something goes
terribly awry...the planet is taken over by an enemy race, the
Kuritans, and you barely manage to escape with your life. As a
Youngblood, of course, you'd make a rather nice head for the wall of
the chief Kuritan's den. Thus, cast out from the safety of the
fallen Citadel, you begin your trek to repel the invaders and, 
incidentally, to uncover the truth about the mysterious death of
your father, a legendary 'Mech warrior. Your plan: to find a number
of 'Mech rebels and launch a counterstrike on the invaders. But you
have no 'Mech, and your chances for survival (let alone victory) are
slim. 

 All is not lost. If you're lucky, you didn't escape the Citadel
penniless. Suitably disguised, you can roam the cities of Pacifica
and go about your business. You may have even escaped in your
training 'Mech, which gives you an immediate advantage. Your father
left some allies behind, as well as a few clues to a secret cache of
'Mech arms and supplies. If you can find and penetrate this cache, 
your goal of liberating the planet just might be possible. If you
play correctly, you can locate the cache, as well as another
surprise or two. 

 BATTLETECH doesn't present much challenge for the experienced
CRPG'er. There's a lot of overland exploring to do, and a fair-sized
bunch of cities requiring brief investigation. There's only one
"dungeon" (actually a maze) to be explored, and there's no threat, 
no enemy present anywhere in this maze. Thus, it's a matter of
mapping and patience, not of any particular skill (certainly not
combat, and precious little problem-solving). The chief puzzle of
the maze is really just a big game of MasterMind, as certain
combinations of colors and numbers are required to plumb the depths
of the complex. There is only one moderately tricky area, and once
all has been accomplished, the game ends abruptly. 

 One of the reasons BATTLETECH offers little challenge is the
presence of a stock market. With the stock market and some
patience, you can build up enormous sums of money. When I finished
the game, I had over 24 million credits...yet 200,000 or so will buy
you just about everything you need to speed through the game. And
you can earn that much while you're still in the training phase, 
before the game's even truly begun. 

 Another disappointment is the size of the party. I finished with
four characters -- quite a difference from the game pictured in
progress on the back of the box, which shows a party of 9 on foot
and 4 'Mechs, for a total of at least 13! An Infocom representative
admitted, "Yes, that's a bit misleading." That's not to say that
_every_ party will be as small as mine. Some elements of BATTLETECH
are random; party size is one of those elements, as are the names, 
talents, and locations of the other potential party members. But the
game can be completed with as few as 4 party members (no fewer, 
according to Infocom). 

 By now, you may have gotten the impression that I didn't think very
much of BATTLETECH; I did, however, enjoy the game quite a lot. The
Japanese-style animation, used at various random intervals during
combat sequences (and other dramatic junctures), is amusing and
evocative. The interface is extremely easy to use, and even combat
-- which looks intimidating in the manual -- is quick and easy to
learn. And unlike certain other CRPGs, using the quick combat
methods (available in several convenient modes) usually doesn't put
the player at a disadvantage -- you don't necessarily sustain more
damage than you would if you were directing combat. 

 In other graphic respects, BATTLETECH is delightful. A window in
the upper left corner of the screen displays "first person" views
from time to time, in addition to the cartoon-like animated cut
scenes. The bulk of the screen, during the entire game including
maze and combat screens, is presented in the same aerial view as
QUESTRON II and the outdoor ULTIMA sequences. Its resemblance to
QUESTRON II is, in fact, more than skin deep: The game was
programmed for Infocom by Westwood Associates, the company that
programmed QUESTRON II for SSI. The detail is quite good, and the
combat screens are exciting to watch. Lasers cut through the air, 
torpedoes whirl towards their targets, and in the wake are torn
hulks of wasted 'Mechs and tiny splotches of red where once humans
stood. 

 There are numerous options available. The small animated graphic
clips can be set to appear very frequently, frequently, or rarely, 
but cannot be disabled entirely. During combat, you can choose to
have the computer conduct your party's actions, or you can do it
yourself. In either case, you can set the program to display the
entire battle in all its graphic glory, or you can choose one of
several methods of abbreviating the battle by displaying less
detail. I thought this was a terrific feature; I used all the
different settings, depending on my mood. 

 Other switchable options include the length of the party's stride
(another very friendly touch). You can cover a lot of countryside
quickly by changing from one step to two or four steps per
keystroke. An automapping overhead view is always available, even in
the maze (though it should be augmented with an item Jason can
purchase). And, of course, sound can be turned on and off. 

 The IBM version of BATTLETECH supports PC/XT/AT, PS/2, Tandy, or
compatible running MS-DOS 2.1 or higher. You'll need 384K to run the
program and either CGA, EGA, MCGA, VGA, or Tandy graphics. CGA will
give 4-color output; the others will give 16-color output. If you're
playing from floppy disks, you'll need a couple of blank disks to
make working copies. 

 BATTLETECH comes with both disk formats in the package: two 5-1/4" 
disks and one 3-1/2" disk. The disks are not copy protected, but the
game requires information that can only be found in the
documentation. The game can be easily installed on a hard drive, 
using the included installation program. 

 Up to six games can be saved and restored at any time in the game
except in the midst of combat. This includes the maze sequence. If
you're playing from a floppy, you can weasel around the six-game
save limit by using alternate play disks and switching them just
before invoking a save (or restore). 

 The IBM reference card included in the documentation is fairly
complete in outlining the technical considerations (including
troubleshooting). There is no support for joysticks or mice, though
my mouse did work somewhat to move the character around the screen. 

 As the MS-DOS version of BATTLETECH is the initial release, I
expect there will be some refinement in future ports. Nevertheless, 
I found the game remarkably easy to use (nearly as easy as an
Infocom text game in terms of save/restore flexibility), thus
contributing appreciably to my enjoyment. 

 I completed BATTLETECH wanting more...which is preferable to the
feeling one sometimes gets that a CRPG went on a little (or a lot) 
too long. Then again, BATTLETECH is priced the same as those massive
CRPGs, so in effect you do ge less for your money in terms of play
time. BATTLETECH offers neither the breadth nor depth of the ULTIMAs
or WIZARDRYs, but if you're looking for a CRPG that will provide an
enjoyable weekend's worth of adventure, or if you're new to CRPGs
and you want to start off on a small scale, BATTLETECH is an
excellent choice. 

 BATTLETECH is published by Infocom and distributed by Mediagenic.
