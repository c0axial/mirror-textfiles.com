 FIREZONE is the second of three strategy games in the Wargamers Series from PSS
and Datasoft. A game of tactical combat in the 21st Century, FIREZONE offers
good graphics, nine pre-set missions, a game generator for custom scenarios, a
two-player mode, and simple keyboard control. The Commodore 64/128 version is
the basis of this review; Atari ST and IBM-PC version notes follow.

 Scenarios which can be completed in less than an hour make FIREZONE a combat
game for people with that active, microwave-oven lifestyle. Although PSS
includes a save-game option, it is unnecessary: You don't play FIREZONE at your
leisure; you play it when you're in a hurry, when saving a game is an
intolerable annoyance. Strategy consists of "Let's play now and ask questions
later"; tactics consist of move and shoot. There isn't a whole lot to FIREZONE,
but what there is really swings.

 The combatants in 2160 A.D. are The Pacific Combine and The European League.
The human battle elements are plasma-armored, laser-armed infantry. The weapons
are nuclear nova guns, "Empire Strikes Back" landstriders, fast grav tanks, slow
heavy tanks, and the Leviathan: a battalion of tanks combined in one large
chassis -- which is really something, if you think about it.

 Combat turns are twofold: a Combine Round and a League Round, each of which is
divided into Movement and Combat Phases. You move your infantry and weapons;
both sides fire at whatever enemy is in range. Your opponent moves its infantry
and weapons, and again both sides fire. Turns continue in this manner until one
combatant has been routed or eliminated from the battlefield, a condition that
automatically declares the victor.

 The C64 screen display consists of a scrolling map made up of hexagons. Terrain
features include woods, marshes, water, and ruins, as well as urban, rough, and
clear areas. Units can be hidden or not. Above the map are Game Information
(turn, terrain type, current victory points) and Mode Indicator (Scan, Move,
Fire). When the cursor highlights a unit, Unit Information (name, side,
strength, and attack and defense ratings) replaces Game Information.

 In Scan Mode, you can move the square cursor anywhere on the map. In Move Mode,
you can move a unit a designated number of hexagons.

 FIREZONE is controlled by a small group of keystrokes: You may toggle between
Scan and Move Modes; toggle between units that are stacked; and end the Movement
Phase. Assuming you've moved into firing range, you may also select a target and
commence firing.

 The program disk contains nine ready-made scenarios. The plots of three of
these are described in the instruction manual; the other six scenarios are
surprises. Obviously PSS doesn't realize that 21st-century wargamers on the go
don't have time for surprises.

 The Game Generator lets you alter a ready-made scenario and save it for later
use. A new scenario can be created from the map on up, and the game package
contains a sheet of blank hexagons for just this purpose. Like the game itself,
the Generator operates with a minimum of keystrokes.

 Compared to the strategically deep ANNALS OF ROME (another entry in the PSS
Wargamers Series), FIREZONE is simplistic and superficial -- since 1989 is
superficial, it seems likely that 2160 will be, as well. What's more, the nova
gun is a computer-controlled, self-sighting, self-automated weapon that fires
150 nuclear shells a minute: How long could a battle possibly last?

 Despite its austere nature, FIREZONE looks okay. Playing it is as easy as can
be, and a game won't take 9000 hours to complete. The Game Generator is equally
simple to use, although designing a new scenario is always a major project. If
you've never played a wargame before, FIREZONE would be the perfect place to
start.

 ATARI ST VERSION NOTES

 The Atari ST version of FIREZONE is just as simplistic and superficial as the
C64/128 version. Although it looks and sounds better, the ST version is as
fast-moving and easy to use.

 There are differences in the keystrokes used to control the game. Function keys
have been designated for cursor movement; different keys switch from Move to
Scan Mode, and from Scan to Move; and a different key ends the Movement Phase.

 That's it. FIREZONE is perfect for beginning wargamers, as well as for more
experienced player who have no time to waste. Goldbrickers and sofa spuds need
not apply.

 IBM-PC VERSION NOTES

 The IBM-PC version of FIREZONE is basically the same as the Commodore and Atari
ST versions. It comes with both 5-1/4" and 3-1/2" disks, and is not
copy-protected. The game will run in either CGA or EGA mode; its CGA graphics
are better than average.

 The controls are just as simple as in other versions, but if you have a mouse,
there's an added benefit: Instead of having to move the cursor hex by hex, a
mouse allows you to quickly scroll the map. This is a great help when many units
are scattered around the map and you want to quickly check their status.

 While the controls are uncomplicated, the game itself is not simple, nor is the
computer opponent easy to beat (at least, not at first). You must develop and
use good tactics based on types of units and terrain. Otherwise, you'll end up
losing troops and battles that you could have won. Generating your own scenarios
keeps the game interesting, even after hours of playing. FIREZONE for the IBM
offers good entertainment value.

 FIREZONE is published by PSS and distributed by Datasoft.
