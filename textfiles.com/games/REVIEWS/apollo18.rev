 The distinction between simulators and arcade games is often
blurred. On its face, Accolade's APOLLO 18 is a simulation of the
entire Apollo 18 mission: the launch of the Saturn V rocket, 
maneuvers, moon landing and walk, spacewalk, and re-entry. But to
label this program a simulator would be to overstate the case. 
APOLLO 18 is an arcade game; or, rather, a series of small arcade
games that serve to move the plot along. (This review is based on
the IBM-PC version.) 

 A good simulator (such as FLIGHT SIMULATOR or ORBITER) teaches the
mechanics of controlling the simulated vehicle. It illustrates the
way the systems interact and permits you to test, control, and push
the limits of the simulator. It may even allow you to explore new
terrain and apply your own techniques. APOLLO 18 offers none of that
flexibility. Instead, the Apollo 18 mission has been broken down
into discrete segments, each of which follows the next in a totally
linear fashion. Most of the segments require the completion of an
arcade task; botch a segment, and your mission is aborted, 
shortened, or fatally terminated. Some segments require only that
you input number or flick a few switches. No actual knowledge, no
careful planning of trajectories is required to run this mission
from start to finish. And the whole game reflects this bogus
authenticity; during the moonwalk, random numbers flash by on the
periphery of the display. It's all window dressing and no
substance. 

 The arcade tasks, while simple to learn, are often very difficult
to execute. Moreover, they're not particularly interesting. You can
improve your performance in some of them (the moonwalk and the
spacewalk); others are matters of pure reaction time. Can you hit
the button the instant the counter starts to tick away? Can you keep
the crosshairs centered even though they're being jiggled randomly? 
These tasks will quickly bore adults. 

 Part of the problem is that the tasks draw your attention away from
the graphics (which are not phenomenal, merely interesting at
times). Because you're concerned with precisely performing the
arcade tasks -- or risk ending the game there and then -- you have
little time or attention to devote to enjoying the scenery. 

 The game does provide some educational material regarding the
mission. You learn when stages are separated and what sorts of
physical changes the ship undergoes during the voyage. You
experience a sense of movement in space and on the moon during the
walks. And you find out how long various parts of the mission took
in real life. But it's all pretty elementary, not esoteric info such
as how long you'd need to burn your retros to give you a degree of
pitch. 

 The manual has a couple of problems. Certain items are found under
the wrong headings or not found at all. For example, at one juncture
you need to keep an eye on your approach velocity as you land on the
moon. You're told by the manual to keep your speed "below -004." Yet
the velocity generally maintains itself at around +002 or +000, and
this is apparently satisfactory. Yet lower the number to -005, and
the warning buzzer goes off. What does -004 refer to? Why is -005
faster than -004? None of these details are ever explained. Very
little technical information is offered other than the bare
mechanics of performing the tasks. A bibliography refers you to
other sources of information. 

 Accolade has produced quite a number of excellent programs; 
unfortunately, APOLLO 18 isn't one of them. This program may appeal
to children who have an interest in the history of space
exploration, but there's little action (compared to most
space-oriented games), and the arcade aspects are too tiresome for
adults. 

 The IBM/compatible version of APOLLO 18 requires 356K and an IBM
PC/XT/AT, a PS/2 30/50/60, or a Tandy 1000 series/3000/4000. A
joystick is recommended (the keyboard interface was sometimes
dreadfully unresponsive). The game comes on a single, copy-protected
5-1/4" disk; for an extra $5.00, you can obtain a 3-1/2" copy
(backups are a ludicrous $10). There are two IBM versions: one with
MGA, CGA, EGA, and Tandy 16-color, and another with improved EGA
640x350x16 graphics. The standard EGA graphics are 16-color, but
320x200. You have to send for the special EGA version (an additional
$5.00), but it's included on the 3-1/2" disk, so if you upgrade to
that format, the hi-res EGA version is included. I would say the EGA
upgrade is of questionable value. If you're going to buy the game, 
play it for a while before you spend another $5.00 to make the
graphics better.
