					CONTINUUM

        At first glance, Continuum by Data East doesn't seem to be anything
special.  Soon after a glance at the manual, a boot of the game will proves
your first glance wrong.  The smooth movement, combined with the mood enhancing
areas and soundtrack make the game very worthwhile.

        What is exactly is Continuum like?  In Continuum you control a vehicle,
called a Mobile.  It is essentially a glider with the ability to propel itself
horizontally, but not vertically.  Vertical movement is attained through the
use of platforms whose function is similar to that of a trampoline.  The object
of the game is up to you.  You can either play it simply to explore the
different areas of the maze that makes up Continuum (refered to as 'emotion'
mode), or you can play a game (action mode) in which the object is to find 32
objects scattered throughout the 256 room maze all within time limits for each
area.

        Each room in tha maze of Continuum has a different force of gravity, so
navigation is never exactly the same in any two rooms.  Besides having varying
gravity, the laws of physics that we are used to are not always present in all
the rooms.  You will find some rooms in which movement of the mobile generates
unexpected results.  There are even some rooms with reverse gravity.  All of
these serve to enhance the fun of the game.

        I found the emotion mode provided the most enjoyment, but the action
mode was fun too.  In the emotion mode, you are allowed to select one of 12
areas of the maze which are named after different human emotional states.
(Dream, Motivation, Orientation, Stimulate, Energize, Relax, Adapt, Awaken,
Develop, Concentrate, Stamina and Meditate)  According to the designers, "the
color sound and nature of the rooms in each particular regions have been
scientifically proven to stimulate the particualr area of the human psyche
designated by the region's title."  It is no joke.  The moods set by each area
really do effect you.  (without use of an Ad-Lib, Sound Blaster, or at least a
Tandy with 3 voice capability, the effect is greatly decreased)  I found the
relaxation and meditation areas especilly effective in producing a calming
effect.
        In action mode you are allowed to roam the entire maze, going from
region to region in search of the objects you need.  A time limit is given, and
if you fail to find a room which gives extended time before the timer runs out,
the game is ended.  The action mode is very challenging, and will take a long
time to complete.

        Another feature which makes Continuum so appealing are the variety of
display options.  You can alter the way the background is dispayed, as well as
the use of wire or filled shapes for objects.  The camera (point of view you
see things from) can be locked or unlocked, can be given a vertical slant, and
set from the perspective of the mobile or an observer.  What these options
essentially allow you to do is custom tailor the game to the perspective you
like best, as well as allowing you to make the game more or less challenging.

        Continuum also allows you to rotate the camera up and down during
gameplay.  Since you only need to control horizontal movement, vertical
movement of the joystick (or arrow keys) adjusts the camera angle of the game.  It is possible to see from underneath, above, behind the mobile, or varying degrees inbetween.

        The graphics of contimum are polygon filled graphics (similar to those
in most flight simulators) and are not that impressive.  But the smooth
movement, music, and moods of the game more than make up for what it lacks
graphically.

        Continuum supports joystick or keyboard control, but in my opinion the
game is a waste if not played with a joystick.  I also hightly reccomend that
you have EGA or VGA, and a sound board; in order to enjoy the game to its
fullest.

	All in all Continuum is a very unique, enjoyable game...
