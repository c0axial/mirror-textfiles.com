 The complete title of this package is JACK NICKLAUS' GREATEST 18 HOLES OF MAJOR
CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF. The game was designed and programmed by Ned Martin and Ken
Moore of Sculptured Software, and is published by Accolade. It offers 18 holes
from several famous championship courses; two complete 18-hole courses based on
real-life designs by Jack Nicklaus; beginner and expert difficulty levels; eight
computer opponents; provisions for a foursome; and joystick control. The
Commodore 64/128 version is the basis of this review.

 JACK NICKLAUS' GOLF, in and of itself, is a fine sports simulation -- fine
sports simulations being what Accolade does best. Then again, this is Accolade's
second golf game; the first was MEAN 18 ULTIMATE GOLF. If we overlook the
courses on which the games are played, JACK NICKLAUS' GOLF might just as easily
have been titled MEAN 18 ULTIMATE GOLF II.

 The 18 holes come from famous courses on pro golf's championship circuit: the
12th at Augusta National, the 8th at Pebble Beach, the 18th at Muirfield, and
the 18th at Oakmont. The two full courses are based on the designs of Jack
Nicklaus: Castle Pine Golf Club in Castle Rock, Colorado, and Desert Mountain
Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona.

 After choosing a course, you'll see an overhead view of one of the 54 holes
available for play. Here you'll have to give your eyes a workout: The 54 holes
are duplicated (sort of) on the Jack Nicklaus Course Sheet, and you need to find
the one shown on-screen and enter the corresponding number. The Sheet is black
on burgundy, presumably so it'll be a washout on the Xerox machine. It's
certainly a washout to your eyeballs.

 Following this illegal-play protection routine, you'll reach the Main Scree
where you'll set up a game based on these player options: You can be male or
female, and you can play against any of eight computer opponents (including Jack
Nicklaus). You enter a name for your player, set a skill level (Beginner or
Expert), and select either Pro, Men's, or Ladies' tee position.

 There are four selections on the Game Option Screen: Play a Round, Practice a
Hole, Driving Range, and Practice Green. Before teeing off, you'll see an
overhead view of the hole; it can be recalled later with a keystroke.

 Beginner level has automatic club selection based on distance only, although
you can override it. Expert level selects driver, sand wedge, and putter, in the
appropriate circumstances; other shots require that you select the club. A
Scorecard and a Statistics Screen appear at the conclusion of each hole.

 The C64 screen display consists of whichever part of the fairway or green you
happen to be on. To the left is a Power Bar divided into swing increments. Each
shot is a threefold process: Tap the joystick button to start a swing, t the
button a second time for distance and the start of the downswing, and a third
time to actually hit the ball.

 The Power Bar is calibrated according to the distance inherent in each club;
each division of the Bar indicates 10% of the distance. Therefore, a 50% swing
on the Power Bar represents half the maximum distance of a particular club. It's
best to remember that a club's potential distance is calculated under optimal
environmental conditions.

 Environmental conditions become less than optimal when the wind is blowing,
when the fairway has hills, slopes, or rough, and when the breaks off the green
are radical. You'll have to compensate for the wildness of the environment with
close study of the hole in question, proper club selection, and proper use of
the Power Bar. And therein lies the game of golf.

 Below the fairway display are wind (or break) indicator and club selection.
Aiming a shot is accomplished by moving the tee and ball at the top of the
screen. The game is controlled with a joystick. On selection screens, moving the
stick highlights a choice and the button selects. On the fairway or the green,
the button controls a swing in the threefold manner mentioned above. The game
package comes with a clearly written instruction manual, which also includes
plenty of golf tips from Jack Nicklaus.

 JACK NICKLAUS' GOLF looks very good on the Commodore 64. A fairway and a green
appear as they're supposed to, complete with trees and sand traps and water
hazards. Players are smoothly animated. Although Accolade's claim that this
product "...is unquestionably the most realistic and visually stunning computer
golf game ever made" vaults beyond hyperbole, the game does look good, and it
plays extremely well.

 If you don't already own a golf simulation, JACK NICKLAUS' GOLF is as good a
place to start as any. MEAN 18 from Accolade is fine, too. So are WORLD TOUR
GOLF (Electronic Arts) and LEADER BOARD (Access). They're all well done. Why we
need another one is anybody's guess.
