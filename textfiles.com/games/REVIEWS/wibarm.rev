 WIBARM is a combination role-playing/arcade game from Broderbund, and it's a
very good one. WIBARM successfully mixes arcade and role-playing features, and
easily sustains the player's interest for literally hours on end. (This review
is based on the IBM-PC version.)

 The role-playing part of the game is both the weakest and the strongest point.
The weak aspect is the fact that there is only one character. In most
role-playing games, there are several characters, each of whom has a different
ability needed to successfully complete the adventure. But here, there's only
one character, Eizel Cloud, who's in charge of his transformer, WIBARM.
Therefore, the only choices to make involve which weapon to use and which way to
go next. However, since these two very important decisions must be made over and
over again, the effect of the limitations is lessened somewhat.

 The player is represented by a transforming robot that has three forms. The
most common form is the plane, since it's necessary in order to travel to some
of the buildings. Once part of a building is mapped, the plane also makes
traveling easier, since it will continue forward without using controls. The
robot form is used a great deal, as well, because it's the only one present in
the arcade sections. The final form is a car, necessary for reaching certain
areas.

 The main function of the role-playing is to break up the arcade action. You
have to travel through buildings and caves on several different levels in order
to find messages and powerful weapons. Of course, to reach the messages and
weapons, you must fight various monsters. Defeating monsters increases your
ability to fight, making it possible to beat more powerful monsters.

 As you go through the buildings, there is an auto-mapping feature to keep track
of where you've been. One nice touch occurs when you take a certain amount of
damage: The auto-mapper stops functioning. This can make finding the repair
factory interesting, to say the least. If this happens before you find the
repair factory, you may be better off starting over.

 The arcade action continues throughout the game. It alternates well with the
traveling during the role-playing mode, and it's not difficult to get the hang
of fighting. You can choose from among three weapons, each of which achieves
varying efficiency in damaging the monsters, according to the ability level of
the robot. While fighting, it's necessary to keep track of energy usage, damage
to the robot, and damage to the monster. This is in addition to keeping track of
the location of both the monster and the robot. After a few fights, this all
comes automatically, but it's still possible to lose track and die -- especially
since the monsters are also becoming more powerful.

 The IBM version of WIBARM requires 256K of RAM, one floppy (either 5-1/4" or
3-1/2"), and MS-DOS 2.0 or higher. It supports CGA 4-color, EGA 16-color, Tandy
16-color and Hercules graphics modes. Control is via joystick or keyboard.
WIBARM is not copy-protected; it uses a security code sheet from which you must
cross-reference two Japanese characters to determine the correct number code.
The code sheet is the type of purple paper that's impossible to photocopy. This
also makes the sheet difficult to read in low light, but at least it's not
necessary to use your original disks. Two disk drives are slightly more useful
than one when starting up the game, but are not a great advantage overall. And
for those players with 3-1/2" drives, both formats are included in the package.

 The graphics are good, and reflect the Japanese origin of the game. The
interiors of the buildings appear in a 3-D mode that's very convincing. The view
drops off realistically in the distance, and the movement is very animated and
wide-ranging. The limited colors are somewhat disappointing, but they do not
detract from the game, and are combined in a pleasing manner. The keyboard
controls are easy to use, and it's quite possible to get through the game
without the use of a joystick. In fact, some players will prefer the keyboard
controls.

 WIBARM is well worth purchasing. It provides a variety of situations and
actions for you to choose from, and offers a great deal of entertainment value.

 WIBARM is published by Arsys Software and distributed by Broderbund.
