 SORCERIAN is a Japanese import from Sierra On-Line. Unlike most of Sierra's
titles, SORCERIAN is not an adventure, but an action role-playing game. (This
review is based on the IBM-PC version.)

 In SORCERIAN, players assemble parties of up to four characters to tackle the
15 different adventures included. Characters have ability ratings, classes,
equipment, and experience, just as they would in a normal role-playing game. The
difference in SORCERIAN is that in the adventures, the party moves as a group in
real-time across the screen. In fact, play in SORCERIAN bears a strong
resemblance to the various scrolling graphics games popular in arcades and home
video games (e.g., SUPER MARIO BROTHERS).

 Players who relish a pure role-playing experience may be put off by this form
of presentation, and by the arcade nature of combat. However, underneath its
arcade skin, SORCERIAN is a true RPG, and a clever one at that. Players will
find that each quest has a plot and a set of puzzles to be solved. Clues must be
found, and objects collected and manipulated in the correct order to get through
each adventure, just as in any other role-playing game.

 Play in SORCERIAN is very simple. Once players have selected their characters
and assembled a party, they can choose an adventure to play. The 15 adventures
are broken down into three scenarios of five loosely linked adventures. In
general, players will want to play the adventures in order, as characters with
some experience are required to complete the later numbered adventures.

 In the adventure, the party moves as a single group in a line across the
screen. The perspective is strictly two-dimensional in a cut-out view. Players
use the keyboard to move the party and to have the party attack or use their
weapons or magic. To look at an object, enter a door, or pick up an object,
players must have the characters jump directly in front of it. While this is odd
(indeed, rather comical), it is straightforward.

 An interesting twist in SORCERIAN is that much of the complexity of play occurs
_after_ the adventure. In town, players must determine what training to give
their characters. This training takes both time and money, but is required if
characters are to reap the benefit of new experience levels. Potions may be
purchased, or mixed for a fee from herbs collected during the adventure.
Finally, players can have magic placed on their items.

 The magic system in SORCERIAN is both complex and unique. As mentioned above,
players may have their items enchanted. However, items are not given a simple
spell. Instead, players must choose which of seven gods to have enchanted in the
item. Several gods must be added in combination in order for spells to be cast
using the item. The seven gods may be combined in nearly endless ways, each
combination providing different spell-casting abilities. The entire system is a
bit bewildering, but mastery and use of magic is essential in the later
adventures.

 The graphics in SORCERIAN are reasonably sharp, if unspectacular. Much of this
is due to the two-dimensional perspective. In addition, the graphical style is
that of Japanese animation, with characters resembling children, and the
monsters having a decided cartoonish look. Fans of Japanimation will enjoy this
style; role-players who prefer a more realistic look to the graphics may not.

 SORCERIAN supports VGA/EGA (640x350x16) graphics mode only. It requires 512K
RAM and may be installed on a hard disk. An 8MHz processor is recommended. There
is no copy protection. The interface is keyboard driven, though a joystick may
be used. Roland, AdLib, GameBlaster, and IBM music card sound modes are
supported. SORCERIAN comes with both high-density 5-1/4" (1.2 MB) and 3-1/2"
disks. Double-density (360K) 5-1/4" disks are available.

 The interface is straightforward, allowing players to concentrate on their
quest. The puzzles are usually of medium difficulty and require considerable
traversing of the territory in each adventure. This can get a bit old,
particularly since the layout of the screens makes it somewhat difficult to keep
track of where your party is.

 On the plus side, I liked the relatively short adventures that allow players to
feel a sense of accomplishment more often than in most games. In addition, this
permits players to try other adventures when hopelessly stuck in the one they
are currently playing. Another nice feature is that players may choose to have
their characters re-play an adventure in order to gain further experience before
tackling the next level. The penalty for doing this is that each time the
characters go on an adventure, a year of time passes, and age will eventually
have detrimental effects on characters' abilities.

 With 15 adventures, gamers will find that SORCERIAN offers outstanding value.
Players will have to decide, though, whether a psuedo-arcade style role-playing
game with two-dimensional graphics suits them. I found SORCERIAN to be a
refreshing break from other, lengthier quests, with the ability to play
individual adventures a definite plus.

 SORCERIAN is published by Falcom and distributed by Sierra On-Line.
