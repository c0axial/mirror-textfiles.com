 A lot of boxing simulations have attempted to achieve various levels of
authenticity. LOW BLOW reaches out in another direction altogether: We now have
a boxing game in which (how shall I put this?) you and your opponent can kick
each other where it _really_ hurts. (This review is based on the IBM-PC version
of the game.)

 There's a lot of action and detail here. If you're playing against the
computer, it will automatically select your opponent for you. Study his past
performance (wins, losses, "Boxing IQ," and the number of times he has relied on
a "dirty hit"), and train for a bit with your sparring partner. Your manager has
already scouted out your opponent, and he'll have tips on which combinations of
punches will be most effective.

 Now, it's time to fight. The EASN announcer, Coward Headswell (who looks and
talks suspiciously like Howard Cosell), hypes the coming action. The bell
sounds, and the action is fast and furious. Two status bars for each boxer keep
you informed of punching power and stamina. Your arsenal includes jabs, crosses,
uppercuts, and the Low Blow. The trick is to deliver the deadly groin kick
without the judges spotting it. They never seem to spot it when you're on the
receiving end, but they're pretty good at picking it up when you've socked it to
your opponent. His mouth protector goes flying and he stands there whimpering,
knees shaking, and holding himself. If you get caught, it's three warnings and
then automatic disqualification.

 At the end of the fight, you'll not only get the judges' decision and
Headswell's wrap-up, but you can read the headlines of the sports section. Then
it's on to your next opponent, who is either stronger or weaker, depending on
whether you won or lost your previous battle.

 You can also play against a friend. (How much of a friend he'll be after you
deliver a few swift kicks to his nether region, you'll quickly find out.)

 The IBM version of LOW BLOW comes on three 5-1/4" diskettes (with two 3-1/2"
diskettes available separately) that can be copied onto your hard drive. From
there, Electronic Arts relies on manual copy protection. The game can be played
either from the keyboard or with a joystick; I found using the joystick much
easier.

 Graphics support is provided for CGA, EGA, and Tandy modes. The shots on the
back of the box faithfully represent EGA graphics, which are colorful and
detailed. Animation is a bit on the jerky side, but smooth enough so that it's
not distracting.

 While it's not noted on the box, audio support is here for the Roland MT32 and
AdLib sound boards.

 LOW BLOW is a lot of fun. Even if you're not much of a boxing fan, as long as
you have a serious sadistic streak, you'll have a ball delivering those kicks
between the legs.

 LOW BLOW is published and distributed by Electronic Arts.
