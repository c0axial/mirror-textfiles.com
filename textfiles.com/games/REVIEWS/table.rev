 TABLE TENNIS SIMULATION is a ping-pong game written by Starbyte Software (of
Germany) and published and distributed in the U.S. by Star Games. TTS offers
excellent graphics and gameplay physics, two-player mode, unlimited practice, 20
World Cup opponents, mouse/joystick control, and copy protection. The Atari ST
version (for which you'll need 512K and a color monitor) is the basis of this
review.

 Promoted as a family game, TTS occupies the unique position of being the only
ping-pong simulation on the planet. (My knowledge of existing software markets
does not extend as far as, say, the Acobamba Abyss, so I could be mistaken.) If
we take the Star Games press release at face value, then TTS shall always be
unique, because not only is it a one-of-a-kind program, it's perfect, too.
Although TTS is a fine package, the labels "family game" and "perfect" are,
unfortunately, not altogether true.

 The TTS main menu offers Practice and Competition. Practice takes place in a
basement, where a machine cranks out shot after shot; speed, slice, and
direction can be adjusted. Your returns are unimportant -- no points are
involved -- but you'll be able to work on mastering the rackets and the
different return strokes. Competition can be a single match or the World Cup
tournament.

 In single-match competition, you can play against any of the 20 computer
opponents whose numerical rankings correspond to difficulty level. You'll have
to specify an opponent, a racket, the racket's controller (either mouse or
joystick), the number of sets to win a match (1-3), the number of points to win
a set (11 or 21), and whether to switch sides after each set.

 The ST graphics display in Competition mode features a ping-pong table and two
hands (each of which holds a racket), along with grinning ping-pong fans in the
bleachers. (Practice mode displays the ball machine, no appendages.)

 TTS can be controlled via either joystick (for beginners) or mouse (for
experts). The stick automatically moves into the path of a serve, but you must
pull the stick back and release it to return. Push the stick left, right, or
forward, and then release to effect different returns. Serving, which is
accomplished by pushing the button and moving the stick back, is erratic at best
and demands luck rather than skill.

 The mouse is directly connected to the hand/racket: Move the mouse, move the
racket. A serve is accomplished by pressing the button (which tosses up the
ball) and keeping the racket steady -- far easier to describe than to do. Simple
block returns are automatic, as long as you position the racket in the path of
the ball.

 The mouse buttons invoke different return strokes whose relative effects depend
on how long you hold the button(s) down. Press and hold both buttons for a very
high speed return; press and hold the right button for a return with high speed
and topspin. As with serving, these trick returns are easier explained than
executed, and their performance is erratic at best. You're going to have to
spend some time in that Deutschland basement.

 Using the joystick and mouse in the two-player mode led to weirdness: Each
device took turns controlling the other racket. What's more, the manual is
mistaken about the controller ports. TTS considers the ST's ports (which are 0
and 1) as 1 and 2. This would be okay if it were only a numerical error: In a
one-player game against the computer, you must select Port 2 (which is actually
Port 1) or nothing will happen. Using two joysticks (in a two-player game) means
you'll have to replace the mouse with a second joystick. ST users know what this
entails.

 Twelve human players can be added to the World Cup Tournament roster. World Cup
matches continue until only the champion remains; the world rankings are then
updated. The TABLE TENNIS package comes with one copy-protected disk and an
instruction manual written in English and German.

 TTS's graphics are excellent, but its best feature is great physics. You can
make the ball spin, slice, take off like a cannonball, skim the net, or head for
any point on or off the table. Although these things can be done, there is no
guarantee that they _will_ be: Potential is not reality, a truism that seems
inherent to TTS.

 Serving, returns, and basic mouse control all demand precision handling, which
more or less eliminates kids under 12 and anyone with an itchy trigger finger.
The joystick's auto-positioning makes things a lot easier for youngsters; then
again, serving and trick returns are lost causes. Despite its controller
problems, TTS is a fine-looking game. To prevent yourself from melting into a
lump of goo, and to counteract the urge to head for the local arcade for a few
rounds of DOUBLE DRAGON (I or II), it's best that you have your local dealer
serve up a playtest.
