 PROJECT NEPTUNE is a strategy/arcade game from Infogrames and Epyx. It offers a
topical plot, excellent graphics, realistic animation, three skill levels,
sharks and an octopus, underwater battles, "Top Secret" documentation, and
joystick, mouse, or keyboard control. The color-only Atari ST version is the
basis for this review.

 NEPTUNE concerns Richard Douglas Klein, code-named "Yellow Shadow," who is more
than inexpressibly ugly. He also controls an undersea mining operation, the
product of which (uranium) will eventually be sold to terrorists. As Rip Steel,
you'll be airlifted to the North Sea to rendezvous with the HMS Remora, a
one-man attack submarine, and head out to sever the links that connect Yellow
Shadow's bases, thus destroying his operation.

 Obstacles to this goal include defense, worker, and warrior patrols, floating
mines, kelp, and the rock formations of the sea's bottom, as well as Yellow
Shadow, who constructs new bases as fast as you sever the links between them.

 The Remora is equipped with torpedo launchers, acoustic decoys, and timed
Underwater Concussion Devices (UCDs). You can drop UCDs from the sub, or you can
climb into your scuba gear (complete with spear gun) and deliver them
personally. Also on the Remora is a laser-armed Propeller Driven Platform (PDP),
which you'll need for battles with the Shadow's patrols.

 The ST graphics display consists of four screens. The main screen is the
cockpit of the Remora: viewport, compass, clock, warning monitor, and several
status and selection icons. SASMAP is an acronym for the Satellite/Aircraft
Symbolic Map; on activation, it replaces the cockpit and provides details of the
surrounding seascape, including Allied supply bases and Shadow mining bases and
patrols. This display also controls Remora's auto-pilot.

 Selecting the SCUBA icon dresses you in your underwater apparatus and sends you
out for a swim. Selecting the PDP icon does the same, except that you'll be
strapped to a swift-moving, highly maneuverable undersea sled armed with lasers.

 Either mouse, keyboard, joystick, or all three can be used to control the
action: Rolling the mouse moves the Remora, PDP, or you (when you're a frogman);
the left button fires weapons. The joystick performs the same functions. When
using the keyboard, the arrow keys effect movement, and the spacebar fires
weapons. Function keys F1-F3 select the difficulty level. The ESC key returns
you to the cockpit after scuba diving, piloting the PDP, or consulting the
SASMAP.

 NEPTUNE comes on two copy-protected disks. There is occasional disk access, but
only one swap. One game at a time can be saved, and any subsequent save will
overwrite the previous one. The documentation is stamped "Top Secret." It
consists of a bunch of loose pages that could have been stapled together and
stamped "Manual," but weren't: Shuffling through these pages is mildly confusing
at first, but the game is so cool and so easy to play once you get the hang of
things, it doesn't matter.

 Graphics, animation, and sound effects are consistently excellent throughout:
Kelp sways with the currents, sonar "pings," air escapes from the Remora with
its unique sound, and the undersea artifacts waver and appear distorted outside
the viewport. Scuba diving, swimming, and the movement of the sharks and
octopuses are perfectly lifelike. Color sometimes seems drab and washed-out, but
the longer you play, the more natural it becomes.

 PROJECT NEPTUNE is an outstanding game: It's tense, suspenseful, and cinematic;
it looks and sounds great; it plays perfectly no matter which control device you
use. Of course, Infogrames (led by Eric Mottet) -- whose programmers do some of
the best animation work around -- knows all about producing outstanding games:
CRASH GARRETT, CAPTAIN BLOOD, and HOSTAGE RESCUE MISSION. Their latest effort is
too good to miss.

 PROJECT NEPTUNE is published by Infogrames and distributed by Epyx.
