
 MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR V. 4.0B

 We all find it easy to complain, even if "...nobody listens anyway." If it is
fair to complain, it is equally fair to praise above-average performance,
particularly when the party concerned has actually taken the time and effort to
listen to, and address complaints made by, users of their product. Microsoft
Corporation of Redmond, Washington is certainly deserving of such praise for its
recent release of a maintenance update for the ever-popular FLIGHT SIMULATOR
program. (This review is based on the IBM-PC version.)

 Last year, I reviewed version 4.0 of Microsoft FLIGHT SIMULATOR for THE
ELECTRONIC GAMER. My prediction at that time has certainly proven true: The
Flight Simulator section of The Gamers' Forum (GO GAMERS) on CompuServe has been
alive with comments and activities pertaining to version 4.0 ever since its
release. The message section has been buzzing with questions, hints, complaints,
suggestions, and general chat concerning this fine program. Other recent
activities in the forum have included a "Demo Contest" that had forum members
using the "Demo Recorder" function of FLIGHT SIMULATOR to produce and share
recorded versions of their flying adventures, as well as what was probably the
first ever "Computerized Aviation Fly-In," utilizing the multi-player function
of the program. Both events were highly successful and will no doubt become
annual or semi-annual events. (High praise has indeed been earned by Section
Leaders Rick Lee and Jeff Horrocks, who organized and orchestrally conducted the
events.)

 Of course, the star of the show was FLIGHT SIMULATOR V. 4.0, without which none
of this could have taken place. Many participants' experiences were enhanced by
the fact that they were flying the new version of the program: 4.0b.

 In the background of all the activity that followed the release of FLIGHT
SIMULATOR V. 4.0 (in the fall of 1989) lurked representatives of the Bruce
Artwick Organization and Microsoft, who jointly produce the program. In response
to issues addressed in the forum, and comments from users in general, they made
an updated version available to all registered users of FLIGHT SIMULATOR V. 4.0
in February of 1990. In the paragraphs that follow, I will briefly highlight the
modifications.

 PC pilots whose computers use DTK BIOS will be particularly pleased with
release 4.0b. A lack of true IBM-compatibility prevented the program from
recognizing the keyboard when the DTK BIOS was present. Although this did not
indicate a fault within the FLIGHT SIMULATOR product, it was a matter that
warranted attention. Release 4.0b is compatible with DTK BIOS.

 Users of version 4.0b are finally able to taxi around Flight Simulatordom with
relative ease by comparison to the ham-fisted operation required by version 4.0.
The aircraft now slows realistically when power is reduced to idle, and the
turning radius has been decreased sufficiently to allow 360-degree turns within
the confines of most runways. I must admit that the difficulty experienced while
taxiing was my biggest complaint about the earlier version, and the fix has been
most successful in restoring any lost enthusiasm for this program.

 The tendency of the aircraft to constantly experience heading drift to the left
has been corrected, despite the fact that it could easily have been brushed off
as a consequence of torque. Not so easily brushed off was the previous lack of
power available on the generic Lear Jet. Happily, the Lear now has power to
spare.

 Many users offered unfavorable comments concerning the severity of the
turbulence generated by the "Weather Generator" option, and the horizon that
jumped about while doing carrier approaches in spot view. Both of these
anomalies have been corrected.

 In addition to the major corrections, several lesser anomalies have been
addressed. Many of these may have gone unnoticed by most users, but I will
mention them in the interest of completeness:

 Joystick interaction with keyboard elevator trim has been improved, and an
editorial change has been made to the "Joystick" menu option. Another nice touch
is the loading of non-default joystick sensitivities, which may be associated
with the "Startup Mode."

 Creation of a new "Startup Demo" previously corrupted the former startup demo,
rendering it unusable. This has been corrected.

 The mode library list no longer defaults to the first page when invoked. It
remains at the last page selected by the "See more modes" key sequence.

 COM2 is now available to multi-player users, who may also notice that CONNECT
functionality has been improved.

 A misuse of the system clock that caused unwanted changes to the logbook dates
has now been corrected.

 Version 4.0b elevates FLIGHT SIMULATOR to a standard that perhaps should have
been achieved in the release of version 4.0. More important than the content of
the release is the commendable manner in which Microsoft addressed the concerns
of its users. At a time when the software industry is so rapidly expanding, such
a display of good faith and user support is refreshing. Microsoft FLIGHT
SIMULATOR is still the de facto standard in PC-based flight simulation software,
and release 4.0b places Microsoft's level of customer support at the top of the
heap, as well. Bravo!

 If you are a registered owner of FLIGHT SIMULATOR V. 4.0, you may obtain your
copy of the update by calling Microsoft Customer Service at (206) 882-8088. You
will be expected to comment on at least one of the problems associated with the
original release. They will then require your name and address as listed on your
registration card, and the disk format you prefer.

 For CompuServe subscribers, an alternative method of getting the new release is
to leave a message to the Customer Service Representative (76701,267) in the
Microsoft Applications Forum (GO MSAPP). Be sure you include the information
mentioned above in your message.

 Microsoft is now shipping version 4.0b to its distributors. There are no
package markings to distinguish this version, and there are probably quite a
number of packages containing the old software still on the shelves. If you are
about to purchase Microsoft FLIGHT SIMULATOR V. 4.0, it might be a good idea to
ask your dealer how long the package has been sitting on the shelf. The dealer
may even allow you to check out the software before you take it home. The
easiest way to ascertain the version number is to place the diskette in an
appropriate drive, and at the DOS prompt, type "VOL" <ENTER>. The volume label
should read "FLTSIM V40B."

 System Requirements remain the same as for FLIGHT SIMULATOR V. 4.0:

 o IBM Personal Computer, XT, AT, Personal System/2 or compatible.

 o At least 384K of RAM for the IBM PC with CGA. Other graphics
   adaptors may require more memory. If so, the program will specify
   this requirement when you begin.

 o At least one floppy disk drive (double sided, low- or high-density).

 o Color Graphics Adaptor (CGA), Enhanced Graphics Adaptor (EGA), Video
   Graphics Array (VGA), Personal System/2 Graphics System, or Hercules
   Monochrome or InColor Card.

 o Appropriate monitor for your graphics adaptor.

 o MS-DOS PC-DOS (version 2.0 or later).

 Optional equipment:

 o Hard disk drive.

 o Mouse.

 o One or two joysticks or a control yoke, and an IBM-compatible Game
   Control Adaptor Card.

 MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR V. 4.0B is published and distributed by Microsoft.
