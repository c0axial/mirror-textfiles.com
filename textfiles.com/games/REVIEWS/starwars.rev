
 STAR WARS

 STAR WARS, Broderbund Software's hit arcade adventure, has been released for
the Macintosh. If you played the arcade game, then you know what to expect:
wire-frame graphics, and a fast-paced action game for your home computer.

 STAR WARS is compatible with the Mac 512e, Plus, SE, II, IIx, and IIc. The game
is copy-protected using the key-disk method. It can be copied to and played from
your hard disk, but you must still insert the original disk in order to play the
game.

 You use a mouse for maneuvering your ship and guns around the screen, firing at
various screens full of enemy ships. Eventually you make it to the famous trench
on Deathstar (as seen in the movie), and search for the exhaust port. Shooting
it causes the Deathstar to explode.

 The documentation is brief, but then there is very little you need to know
about playing the game. Maneuver the mouse and press the mouse button. Simple
but effective. If your reflexes are fast enough, you'll get through all the
screens and blow up the Deathstar.

 If this is what you want and enjoy in an action game, you won't be
disappointed. But if you prefer solid-filled, animated graphics, and dazzlin
special effects, STAR WARS is not for you.

 STAR WARS is published and distributed by Broderbund Software.
