 A BOY AND HIS BLOB has all the makings of a great action
adventure. First, it was written by David Crane, the designer of
many top arcade games (including the blockbuster PITFALL). 
Secondly, it features rocket ships, mazes, hidden treasures, caves, 
aliens, and a blob who likes to eat jellybeans.... 

 In this wacky Nintendo game, you're a young boy who befriends a
small white blob in need of help. During your adventure to save
Blob's home planet (Blobolonia), you must feed your gooey friend
jellybeans to transform him into various helpful items. Each flavor
of the candy turns the blob into a different, far-out object -- from
a bubble that can carry you under water to a ladder that allows you
to reach high places. 

 You begin the game on Earth, where you must collect treasures and
extra jellybeans hidden in a system of caves under the local subway
station. When you have all the materials you need, just toss a
special jellybean over to Blob and he'll turn into a rocket that'll
transport you to his planet. 

 When you arrive in Blobolonia, you'll know you aren't "in Kansas
anymore." For one thing, there are bouncing marshmallows that can
squash you, giant candy machines that block your way, and a
wonderful assortment of other lethal goodies loaded with sugar! If
you're able to use Blob's special transformations to help you, then
you might make it past the terrible tempting treats that await you. 

 The graphics and sound are excellent on the Nintendo's 8-bit
system. The music (resembling the theme from "Raiders of the Lost
Ark"...with a cup of sugar added) matches the feel of the game
perfectly. The graphics are highly detailed and the animation is
smooth and colorful in the tradition of GOONIES II (available for
the same system). In fact, A BOY AND HIS BLOB contains some of the
best graphics I've seen on the NES. Whether you're running from
exploding fruit or subway snakes, the presentation is entertaining
and pleasing. 

 David Crane's latest creation is almost sure to become an instant
classic. Whether you're a kid, a kid at heart, or just someone who
craves sweets, BLOB will definitely hit the spot! 

 (By the way, you don't think the designer had Ronald Reagan in mind
when he invented the blob, do you? Nah....) 

 A BOY AND HIS BLOB is published and distributed by Absolute
Entertainment.
