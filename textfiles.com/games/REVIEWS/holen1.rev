 HOLE-IN-ONE MINIATURE GOLF is a four-player, mini-putt simulation from DigiTek
Software. This family-oriented program offers fine graphics and excellent
gameplay, two 18-hole courses, 2 levels of difficulty, foolproof mouse control,
and the DigiTek promise of additional course disks. The Atari ST version is the
basis of this review; at the time of this writing, IBM-PC, Amiga, and Apple IIgs
versions have also been released.

 Although HOLE-IN-ONE is not nearly as graphically detailed as the
highly-acclaimed ZANY GOLF (Electronic Arts), it is certainly more like
real-life miniature golf. Each hole has a 3-shot overstroke limit, but you can
still complete the first 18 holes regardless of how many strokes you use. What's
more, the graphic displays of the holes, even the special-effects holes of
Course Two, are tied directly to the physics of play, rather than being
marginally related to elaborate, slow-mo animation routines. The creators of
ZANY GOLF exercised their programming talents; the programmers of HOLE-IN-ONE
created an wonderfully realistic game.

 Course One features obstacles, sand and water hazards, and topographical
contours that cause the ball to roll weirdly. Each hole is seen from above in
its entirety, and each can be thought of as an individual pool table, especially
since you must pay close attention to angles and bounce vectors.

 After making it through Course One at or under par, you'll be able to play
Course Two, which is spiced up with trick holes: There's more than one
labyrinth, a pinball machine, and a bizarre cityscape. Curved borders replace
the sharply-angled borders of Course One, and the marvelous Cave hole is
upside-down or inside-out or something. Par for these holes is naturally higher.

 The ST graphics display consists of a single hole. A Menu bar above the hole
tells you its name, par, and how many shots you've taken. From the Project menu,
you can select Score, which tells you everything about the game up to that
point. Replay lets you rerun your last shot, and Retry lets you do the last shot
over. The Contour menu allows you to view a hole and its topograhical features
from different perspectives.

 The mouse controls HOLE-IN-ONE, and it works perfectly. A click places the ball
on the tee; the white line that extends from the ball indicates direction and
the relative power behind a putt; a second click does the actual putting. Expert
Mode, when selected from the Options menu, eliminates the white line.

 HOLE-IN-ONE is special in that it is family-oriented (families being the user
group most often neglected these days). Anyone can play it, and be entertained
without melting into a mass of neurotic, quivering goo. The game is a snap to
learn, the mouse works like a charm, and it's hard to imagine anyone becoming
bored.

 The graphics are not great, at least not in the same sense as those of ZANY
GOLF, but they are very good and have not been slighted in a game where the
physics of play is the salient feature. HOLE-IN-ONE doesn't dazzle or distract
with color or animation. It entertains at a basic level, that of clean family
fun (a rare commodity), and it does so without resorting to car chases,
explosions, or bouncing hamburgers. Assuming sales warrant it -- which I hope
they do -- DigiTek plans to release additional course disks.

 For once, the review blurbs on a game package are accurate. HOLE-IN-ONE
MINIATURE GOLF is a jewel glittering in the sand.

 HOLE-IN-ONE MINIATURE GOLF is published and distributed by DigiTek Software.
