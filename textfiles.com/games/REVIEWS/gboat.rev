
 GUNBOAT

 Straddling the categories of simulation, tactical, and arcade game, Accolade's 
GUNBOAT proves a pretty interesting mesh of these three genres. Combine that 
with an original design incorporating both solid-fill 3-D animation with 
bit-mapped imaging (one of the first pieces of software to use this technique 
in ways that are quite different from those found in Origin's WING COMMANDER), 
and you have a ground-breaking game on the technical front. (This review is
based on the Amiga version.)

 Released a year ago for the IBM, GUNBOAT builds upon Tom Loughry's design of 
STEEL THUNDER to provide an interesting simulation of a Navy PBR (Patrol Boat, 
River). The details provided in crewing the boat make for a varied experience 
once familiar with the system, and the three included scenarios are absorbing. 
Separate piloting and gunnery stations on the boat will leave your hands full 
once you get into the thick of things, and the included maps as well as 
control of things like guns, spotlights, boat jets, and crew command keys help 
flesh out the simulation.

 I have inadequate experience with the real thing to confirm or deny the 
claims, but the manual indicates that GUNBOAT is "accurately modeled after the 
actual stations on the PBR Mark III boats currently in use by the U.S. Navy." 

 As the captain of your boat, you get a chance to engage in both the piloting 
and gunnery aspects of the simulation. Piloting involves checking views, 
radar, fuel, and rpm gauges, and searching for targets through careful 
maneuvering of the PBR along the river in one of the three scenarios included 
(Vietnam, Panama, and Colombia). From the pilot's station, you can maneuver the 
boat using the joystick (forward and back control speed, side-to-side control 
the water jets for turning). Radar can be turned on and off, to help find 
targets. Gunners can all be commanded simultaneously to open fire or cease 
fire on any identified targets (the computer then essentially runs the 
gunners, and will continue to fire until a command to cease fire is initiated. 
They will only fire at enemy targets while visible, however, thus avoiding 
needless waste of ammo). 

 You can switch out of the piloting role at any time, and man any one of three 
gunner's stations as well. Each station has different capabilities, and the 
PBR in total has five different kinds of weaponry, from .50 cal heavy machine 
guns to 60mm mortar launchers. All except the mortar launcher can be 
automated; the latter must be manned by the player to be useful. Different 
gunners can take hits while you're away from their stations, and loss of a 
gunner locks you out of being able to use his station. Gunners can also use 
spotlights to reveal targets (simultaneously revealing the gunboat's location 
to enemy targets within visible range as well). Guns all have to be aimed 
before firing when in manual mode, making for real challenge when it comes to 
targeting. From the gunner's station, you can ask the pilot to perform turns, 
to speed up or slow down, or even to reverse course. In other words, the 
piloting of the boat becomes automated while you're concentrating on shooting,
and vice versa.

 Each scenario features at least nine different types of targets, including 
non-combat items like trees and water buffalo, which makes for further variety 
in play. Graphics and sound are both fully adequate to the style of 
representation Accolade has gone for here. The out-the-boat river and 
shoreline is all done in 3-D solid-fill animation, but both boat stations and 
targets are done entirely in 2-D bitmaps. This makes for an interesting 
combination of elements that's nowhere near as exciting as the wrapping of 
bit-mapped images _around_ solid-fill 3-D modeling, but is certainly an 
improvement on the entirely two-dimensional bit-mapped designs of Accolade's 
earlier simulations (such as GRAND PRIX CIRCUIT or THE CYCLES). 

 The game comes with a number of accessible views, both from within the boat 
and outside of it. A view map is always available, which does a nice job of 
plotting the boat's location within the scenario, thus helping you identify 
the locations of various targets for future reference. It's also very useful 
when you start to feel lost. Frequent accesses of the map view also help to 
contextualize the simulation effectively. A chase boat view is included, which 
makes for a more arcade-ish gaming experience. Mission assignments are always 
given at the start of play, but are available at any time during the mission 
for review as well. Finally, a damage screen is accessible with a single 
keystroke, to give you a sense of how well you're doing.

 As with all such simulations, a certain amount of time can be spent just 
getting from one place to another. The designers have provided a very useful 
time compression command to prevent the boredom of rolling down the river with 
nothing to do (the AI speeds up along with the rest of the simulation, though, 
so this can bring targets down on your boat long before you're ready for them. 
Careful use of TC is advised). 

 The nicest thing about GUNBOAT is that it's complex enough to require some 
real tactical thinking during play. Running the boat fast is running it noisy, 
so learning how to sprint and drift, in order to gain best awareness of the 
presence of targets without being spotted, is the first order of the day. 
Aiming a gun from a moving boat can be really tricky; combining boat maneuvers 
with careful aiming becomes a real art, as the boat will pitch and roll when 
moving, thus throwing one's aim off. Targets aren't always stationary, either, 
so learning how to lead one's target becomes another important skill.

 GUNBOAT comes on two copyable disks, and is playable on Amiga 1000s, 500s, 
2000s, or 2500s. It requires one megabyte of RAM minimum to work, and can be 
run from the keyboard or by combining joystick use for maneuvering with 
keyboard use for issuing other kinds of commands. The game is hard-drive 
installable, and comes with a complete instruction card outlining all 
installation procedures in careful detail. A codewheel is used for copy-
protection.

 All in all, GUNBOAT is a fascinating, original simulation with real 
depth. Many aspects of the STEEL THUNDER design have been improved upon here, 
and while GUNBOAT may not function visually in the same way that most air 
combat simulations do, the visual design is nevertheless just perfect for this 
kind of game. The combination of bit-mapped and solid-fill graphics used here 
prevents GUNBOAT from slowing down, and allows for all the necessary detail 
both on the boat and on-shore. The modeling of the boat and its environs is 
sophisticated enough to allow the imagination room for play. And finally, the 
range of included mission assignments in three different theatres of operation 
insures variety and replayability. If you want a break from air combat, but 
still prefer simulation-style fun above all else, GUNBOAT is for you.
