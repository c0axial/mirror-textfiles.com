
 STUNT TRACK RACER

 STUNT TRACK RACER is a futuristic racing simulation published by Microplay and
distributed by Medalist International, a division of MicroProse Software. This
fast-moving game offers superb three-dimensional graphics and race animation,
four racing divisions, eight elevated tracks, practice mode, simple joystick or
keyboard control, modem support for two players, save option, and copy
protection. The Atari ST version (which requires 512K and a color monitor) is
the basis of this review.

 Geoff Crammond, the designer and programmer of STR, is also responsible for THE
SENTRY, one of the more original strategy/arcade games, as well as REVS PLUS, an
outstanding racing simulation that you still may be able to find for your
Commodore 64. In STUNT, Mr. Crammond has combined souped-up 21st-century
vehicles and elevated rollercoaster tracks with the ST's great graphics and
animation capabilities to create a game that'll wire your brain to the screen
and your hand to the controller.

 Having served your racing apprenticeship on Formula 1 tracks that were shut
down in 2006 for safety reasons, you now yearn to hit the Stunt Tracks. It's the
year 2008; you've bribed all the right people, had all your injuries repaired,
and made it to the Stunt circuit, where the tracks sometimes reach heights of
500 feet. There are four divisions, each with two tracks: Little Ramp, Big Ramp,
High Jump, and Drawbridge are self-explanatory.

 Your vehicle is turbo-charged: a cross between a dune buggy and a rail that
sports a titanium alloy suspension system, special extra-sticky tires, and
nitrous oxide fuel that propels you from a standstill to 60 mph in two seconds.
The chassis has been reinforced to withstand the bone-rattling impact of a 50
mph landing.

 The goal of the game is to become the top driver in each division, beginning in
Division 4 and heading toward Division 1. Assuming you become the Division 1
champ, you can then enter the Super League competition: The overall goal is the
same but your opponents are much tougher and all vehicles have been further
modified to handle even higher speeds. Points are awarded for winning a race and
for the best lap time.

 The ST screen display consists of a large arena and the track you've selected,
as it might be seen from a high vantage point. You can rotate a track through
several different views. When you're ready, a crane picks up your vehicle, drops
it on the track, and it's off to the races.

 Each track is solid-modeled and three-dimensional, which you'll see from the
driver's POV: If you think of a rollercoaster -- one of those theme park
monsters, for example -- and imagine yourself in the lead seat, you'll know
exactly what you're in for. You have to drive fast, handle the bumps and dips,
and hit the jumps and ramps at the right speeds and/or accelerations, so that
you land in a way that minimizes the damage from the impact.

 The dashboard of your vehicle consists of lap indicator, lap time, speedometer,
and a readout (in meters) of the distance between you and the nearest opponent.
There is also a readout for boost, which is a limited supply of a special fuel
used for greater acceleration.

 There are keystrokes available, but STUNT is best controlled with a joystick:
Left and right steer the car, forward accelerates, backward brakes, and the
button adds boost. One neat feature is that when you push the stick forward and
then release it, the car will accelerate by itself until you hit the brakes.
When you're not using the stick (or the keyboard), auto-alignment steers the car
in the direction of the track -- except when you're not on it, of course.

 The difference between the stunt tracks and a real rollercoaster (other than
the obvious one) is that a rollercoaster doesn't come unhinged from the rails
(not usually, anyway). On a stunt track, you have to steer the car through the
turns, across the ramps, and up and down the hills and gulleys: Hit a ramp at
the wrong speed and you'll land too harshly; time a jump poorly and you'll miss
the track completely and crash into the supports.

 The STUNT TRACK RACER package comes with one copy-protected disk and an
instruction manual that includes a 25-page article called "The History of Motor
Racing, 1895-2008." The two-player option requires a modem and another STR owner
with an ST or an Amiga.

 STUNT TRACK RACER is an outstanding game, one that was certainly informed by
REVS PLUS, Geoff Crammond's previous race simulation. The graphics are superb
throughout, the race animation is realistic enough to make you lose track of the
outside world, and joystick operation is extremely easy to learn and use. The
banked and elevated tracks dip and rise (more so than in any race or driving
game you've ever played, and enough to make your belly flip over), and the gooey
tires keep the vehicle on the surface -- except when you're airborne, which is
often.

 If you're looking for the speed and thrills of a rollercoaster ride, and the
tension and excitement of competition, you needn't look any further than STUNT
TRACK RACER.

 STUNT TRACK RACER is published by Microplay and distributed by MicroProse.
