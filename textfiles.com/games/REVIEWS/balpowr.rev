 BALANCE OF POWER, 1990 Edition, is an update of the original
BALANCE OF POWER computer strategy game published by Mindscape and
designed by Chris Crawford. The IBM-PC version is the basis of this
review; Atari ST version notes follow. 

 The program requires Microsoft Windows (2.0 and above), 640K
memory, and a hard disk. If you don't have Microsoft Windows, you
can order a special run-time version from Mindscape for $15.00 that
allows you to run the program. I played the game on a Blackship (IBM
compatible) 386 machine with EGA. The (91-page) manual recommends at
least a 286 machine. 

 When you boot the program, a standard Windows interface appears: 
Pull-down menus appear across the top of the screen, as well as a
map of the world (at least 80 of the countries are shown). I
recommend using a mouse, since the program is designed specifically
for one; keyboard control can be enabled, but I found it to be
clumsy and time-consuming. The only other graphics consist of a
group of four advisors who pop up whenever you must make a decision
about your opponent's actions. 

 The rules are well-devised. The manual opens with an invitation to
experiment with different menus and to examine the types of
information available. Next, the manual walks you through a brief
example or two of the flow of play. Then, the Basic Game is
explained. You're advised to master this level before moving on. The
Intermediate, Expert, and Multi-polar levels are detailed in
discrete chunks. A Reference Guide to Commands and Appendices (which
describe game design tradeoffs) are also included. In this version
-- unlike previous ones -- the disks are _not_ copy-protected. 
Instead, after the first turn, you're asked if your papers are in
order; you must look for a phrase in the manual and type it in to
continue the game. 

 At the beginner's level, the game flows very well. The number of
decisions is limited, so decision-making is streamlined. As the
levels rise, the game slows down. You're given an immense amount of
information at the higher levels; thus, you have much more to
consider with each decision. The increasing complexity is somewhat
mitigated by practice, as you soon learn which information is
relevant to each type of decision. The rules are written to enhance
the learning curve. If you master each level, you'll find the next
one to be similar, with only a few new pieces of information to
absorb. 

 I found no inconsistencies or mysteries in the rules, which are
very complete. It only takes about five minutes to get into the
game; it took me about two hours to really master the rules. Written
in a narrative style, with good illustrations, the rules aren't
intimidating. An average playing time, barring nuclear war, is about
ninety minutes; an extremely long playing time might be four hours. 
This is basically a solitaire game, although it is designed to
handle two-player mode, as well. 

 BALANCE OF POWER 1990 is a simulation first, and a game second. As
a game, it is more of a cerebral than a physical exercise. The
information base is immense: You can learn an incredible amount
about living conditions in various countries, as well as other data
more germane to the game, such as amounts of military and economic
aid, numbers of soldiers stationed around the globe, and areas with
degrees of unrest -- from terrorism to civil war. I found the
reference data to be one of the more rewarding aspects of the
program, and recommend BALANCE OF POWER 1990 to people who are
interested in simulations, history, political science, and current
events. 

 As a simulation, the basic game is too simplistic; however, the
basic game is intended as a learning process, not a complete game. 
Players can select an appropriately challenging level. The beginner
level is straightforward (though not necessarily easy), and the
multi-polar version is intricate. I found the advanced game to be a
good simulation of the state of the current world; the multi-polar
version is an excellent representation of our world. 

 If you're looking for an excellent simulation, with plenty of
mental work required, BALANCE OF POWER 1990 should be high on your
list -- even if you have to pay the extra $15.00 for the run-time
Windows package. 

 ATARI ST VERSION NOTES 

 The Atari ST version of BALANCE OF POWER 1990 looks and operates
more or less the same as the IBM version described above, and will
run on any ST with 512K and a double-sided disk drive. Since BOP
uses the ST's built-in GEM interface -- which is closer in look and
feel to the Macintosh version -- you won't need special hardware
setups or extra-cost run-time packages. 

  The 720K program disk is not copy-protected, although Mindscape
still has a problem with the exact meaning of no copy protection. 
The game disk can be copied to a floppy or to a hard drive, but
booting from a hard drive caused a system crash more often than
not. 

  The BOP game screen is in four-color, medium resolution mode, 
which makes for a less colorful (though more detailed) graphics
display. As usual with GEM, screen redraws are less than
instantaneous; there will be waits during disk access and while the
computer responds to your policies. You'll be thinking about the
game, however, so no time is wasted. 

  Despite the tradeoffs that are necessary between reality and
simulation -- Mr. Crawford describes some of them in the
well-written and indispensable 91-page (Mac) manual -- BOP is
probably as close as we'll get to global politics, at least until
the Pentagon decides we're all to be trusted. BALANCE OF POWER 1990
is an exceptional piece of work.
