 Another release in Cinemaware/Spotlight's budget "European games" series,
AIRSTRIKE USA fails to intrigue either as an arcade game or as a flight
simulator. A hybrid product that features stripped-down elements of both game
genres (as well as some minor strategy), AIRSTRIKE USA is likely to satisfy no
one. (This review is based on the Amiga version)

 The first, most apparent aspect of the program is that it's clearly an attempt
to make money from the success of MicroProse's F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER. The premise
is the same -- you're in control of a "21st century advanced tactical fighter"
-- and the screen layout is a rudimentary imitation of the one featured in F-19.
There are three Multi-Function Displays (MFDs), each of which can be altered to
display one of four different kinds of screens; other controls and visuals also
resemble those found in F-19.

 However, the huge difference between AIRSTRIKE USA and F-19 is that the former
features almost _no_ real strategy or tactical simulation. True, there are a
number of different maps available to fly across, each featuring a different
layout of targets and enemy planes; and the plotting of your course to avoid
interception takes a little planning. But the actual missions consist of nothing
more than following an HUD cursor to the target, choosing air-to-air,
air-to-ground, or cannon weaponry, and firing away as soon as "lock on" appears
on one of the MFDs.

 A "report" on the progress of the war occurs at the end of each mission, but
this consists of nothing more than a tally of how many enemy vs. friendly items
have been destroyed during the mission, and an overall tally of which side is
winning. None of this really matters much while playing the game, and serves
mainly as an elaboration of the usual High Score table presented at the end of
the average arcade game.

 The flight simulation, as well, is absolutely minimal. At best, the plane is
really a warmed-over AFTERBURNER jet; air-to-air combat consists of little more
than the same kind of mindless firing at enemy aircraft. The scrolling,
checkerboard ground terrain is smooth, and the terrain-following computer makes
for a nice, bouncy ride, but terrain bumps serve only as opportunities to crash
the plane. Both the player's plane and the enemy aircraft are small, bit-mapped
2-D images onscreen, and reflect a lack of imagination in either drawing or
control. Little in the way of flight simulation is apparent, as the plane has a
very narrow limit in terms of vertical movement (again, like AFTERBURNER).

 Even as an arcade game, AIRSTRIKE USA fails to impress. There are many arcade
games available for the Amiga that feature more complex, interesting animations,
more challenging gameplay, and more variety in the targets, terrain, and control
features. Air-to-air combat is limited to steering the plane to the right or the
left of the screen until a target is locked on, and then pressing the fire
button. Nothing happens fast enough to excite.

 AIRSTRIKE USA comes on one copy-protected floppy disk, and also requires a
document check before the game can begin. Control is via the joystick and/or
keyboard, and the game runs in 512K on any 68000-based Amiga. The copy-protected
disk must be write-enabled in order to save any progress made in the game.

 I recommend this program to no one: There's just nothing going on that could
conceivably entertain you in any way. It's a shame that Digital Integration, the
company responsible for one of the better, more realistic air combat simulations
on the market (F-16 COMBAT PILOT), has given its name to AIRSTRIKE USA. It's a
mystery why anyone at Cinemaware/Spotlight wanted to import the thing.

 AIRSTRIKE USA is published by Digital Integration and distributed by
Cinemaware/Spotlight.
