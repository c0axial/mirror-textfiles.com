 Excuse me for a second...I'm trying to get my pulse down to something vaguely
approaching normal. You see, I've just played another few rounds of SKYCHASE,
easily the fastest jet combat game this computer jet-jockey has ever
encountered. (This review is based on the IBM-PC version of the game.)

 SKYCHASE is a one- or two-player simulation designed for speed and accurate jet
performance. Although this means the graphics consist of three-dimensional grid
patterns rather than detailed images of jet fighters, the game is nothing short
of intense. And with eight customizable planes, six missions, and five enemy
computer pilots to choose from, Maxis definitely did not skimp on options.

 First, select your jet from a list that includes a McDonnell Douglas F-18
Hornet, a Grumman F-14 Tomcat, the F-19 Stealth Fighter, and five others --
including a deceptively named "Paper Plane" that turns out to be the most
advanced of the lot.

 Next, customize your plane: radar or heat-seeking missiles, number of bullets,
amount of fuel, tolerance to G-forces, etc. Note that some options are only
adjustable when playing against another human. There are six increasingly
difficult missions, and five computer "pilots" of varying skill to fight
against. Now that you've girded your loins (so to speak), set forth and do
battle!

 Whether you play against the computer or a human opponent, the screen is
essentially split in half. Feel free to risk a bit of dizziness by looking not
only out of your cockpit, but out of your enemy's cockpit, as well. (This way,
at least you'll know for sure when he has you in his sights.) Alternatively, you
may "hide" the enemy window.

 There are three smaller squares indicating the jet's heading, pitch, and roll.
A larger square features an instrument panel with all of the expected read-outs,
including G-force. (If this value rises above nine Gs, the cockpit window goes
dark, simulating your "blackout.") You also have a computerized "Heads Up
Display" to help you aim the missiles.

 The IBM-PC version of SKYCHASE includes two 5-1/4" diskettes and one 3-1/2"
diskette. Broderbund relies on the manual copy-protection scheme, so the program
can be installed on your hard drive easily. It supports Hercules Monochrome,
CGA, MCGA, EGA, and VGA graphics modes. You can play from the keyboard, or from
either analog or switch-type joysticks.

 Despite the number of features, it's relatively simple to become airborne in
SKYCHASE, but this doesn't mean it's an easy game to master. The game itself
moves at lightning speed, while the planes are amazingly responsive to even the
slightest tug at the joystick. Learning to accurately control the movement of
the jet fighter is no small feat, and it'll probably take you more than a few
rounds to score your first hit. However, SKYCHASE is the kind of first-class
simulation that'll keep you coming back until you can defeat the computer _and_
humiliate all of your friends.

 SKYCHASE is published by Maxis and distributed by Broderbund Software.
