
 OREL HERSHISER'S STRIKE ZONE

 If you're looking for real-life stats, all-time great players, in-depth
managers' strategy and intense league play, then look somewhere else. But if you
want one-on-one pitcher/batter confrontations without complicated fielding
commands, then OREL HERSHISER'S STRIKE ZONE is the game for you. This is a
near-perfect implementation of the popular arcade game by Tradewest (reviewed
here for the IBM PC).

 The game runs in two distinct operating modes: "Strike Zone" and "Home Run
Derby." In "Strike Zone" mode, you're playing a normal game of baseball. As you
begin the game, you're asked to enter your initials and date of birth. The game
keeps track of stats for the top batters and pitchers using initials and
birthdates (presumably to distinguish between players who have identical
initials).

 A "Hall of Fame" screen is presented next, allowing you to view the leaders in
each category, if desired. If not, simply wait a few seconds and the game will
begin. Stat compilation is both ongoing and automatic; when you start a new
game, you'll see your current cumulative batting average and ERA on the
scoreboard.

 For batters, STRIKE ZONE tracks: At Bats, Hits, Batting Average, Doubles,
Triples, Homers, Slugging Average, Runs, Runs Batted In, Walks, Strikeouts, On
Base Average, Hit into Double Play, Stolen Bases, and Caught Stealing. For
pitchers, it records: Wins, Losses, Won/Lost Percentage, Complete Games, Innings
Pitched, Runs Allowed, Earned Run Average, Shutouts, No-Hitters, Hits Allowed,
Walks, Strikeouts, and Home Runs Allowed. Additionally, slugging stats are
accumulated from the "Home Run Derby" mode: Number of Pitches Taken, Home Runs
Hit, Home Run Percentage, Average Distance of Home Runs, and Longest Home Run.

 The screen is divided into two sections. On the left side, you're viewing the
field from the batter's point of view, with the scoreboard visible behind the
pitcher. On the right side, your view is from behind the pitcher, facing the
batter. As a pitcher, you can control the location of the pitch, the degree of
the curve, and the speed of the throw. As a batter, you can determine the power
and the height of your swing.

 Fielders react automatically and professionally, and runners advance one base
when the ball is hit. You must control movement to try to "take the extra base."
During the course of game play, an announcer talks to you in digitized speech.
The voice is very clear, and one of the finest examples of digitized English
I've ever heard on the tiny IBM speaker. However, one can listen to "Strike,"
"Ball," "Foul Ball," "Out," "Next Batter," and "Home Run" only so many times
(even though "Home Run" sounds pretty funny): Thankfully, the sound can be
toggled off.

 The only strange quirk in "Strike Zone" mode comes at the end of the game --
or, at least, what should be the end. If the home team is ahead after the top of
the ninth, it's allowed to bat anyway! I suppose this was carried over from the
arcade version, in which players paid their quarters and wanted to play their
innings; it really has no place in the computer version.

 The "Home Run Derby" mode is very simple. You're given twenty pitches in which
to hit home runs. If you fall short, it counts as nothing; if you hit a home
run, it's added to your lifetime "slugging" stats. This is a great way to learn
how to hit those pitches, and to get in a little practice before facing a
computer or human opponent.

 The graphics and animation in STRIKE ZONE are superb for EGA, VGA, and Tandy
16-color screens. In fact, they're identical to the arcade version. The CGA
screen is difficult to use, though not impossible. MCGA and Hercules modes are
also suported. A joystick is optional, and the game is not copy-protected. One
or two players can play.

 OREL HERSHISER'S STRIKE ZONE takes a basic approach to computer baseball,
concentrating on pitching and batting -- the core of the game -- rather than
stats and strategy. It's a fine game for the casual computer baseball player,
and an interesting diversion for the hard-core league player who just wants to
"smack a few" or "whiff 'em by some guy."
