 Avantage is Accolade's line of low-priced games, of which MENTAL BLOCKS is one.
(The others are HARRIER 7, SHOOT 'EM UP CONSTRUCTION KIT, and FRIGHTMARE.)
Modeled after TETRIS, MENTAL BLOCKS is an expanded version of Spectrum
HoloByte's popular puzzle game. It comes on a "flippy" disk (C64/128,
IBM/Tandy), includes four puzzles, and offers fine 3-D graphics and game play,
joystick and keyboard control, a two-player mode, and copy protection. (This
review is based on the Commodore 64/128 version; IBM-PC version notes follow.)

 Unlike Avantage's HARRIER 7 (which was hardly worth playing, much less actually
purchasing), MENTAL BLOCKS is a fine game. Both the C64 and IBM versions look
good and play well. The $14.95 price tag refutes the "you get what you pay for"
adage, providing justification for the Avantage lineup of games, and making the
package an excellent bargain in the process.

 The names of the puzzles are Mental Detector, Fits and Pieces 2D, Fits and
Pieces 3D, and Shapes Happen.

 Fits and Pieces 2D is TETRIS, more or less. Blocks fall in groups of four, and
each group must be manipulated -- rotated, moved left and right -- in order to
form a complete row. When a row is filled, it disappears. The incomplete rows
atop it drop down, and the blocks fall faster. When the playing area is filled,
the game ends.

 Although Fits and Pieces 2D is drawn to appear three-dimensional (TETRIS is
completely "flat"), the blocks can be flipped over and moved left and right in
only two dimensions. Shadows highlight the playing area beneath the block as it
falls, giving you an extra aid for positioning.

 Fits and Pieces 3D is TETRIS taken to the extreme. The blocks can be rotated in
three dimensions, and the shadows move to reflect changes in the three axes. To
makes things even tougher, you still have to move the blocks left and right,
toward you, and away from you -- none of which has anything to do with the X, Y,
or Z axes. The 2-D version is tricky; the 3-D version is incredibly tricky.

 Mental Detector displays a "folded" cube with three visible sides at the top of
the screen. Below are four unfolded cubes, all six sides of which are visible.
Before the 30-second timer runs out, you have to fold the bottom shapes in your
head and determine which one will form the cube when folded.

 In Shapes Happen, at the top of the screen there are three shapes (squares,
circles, polygons, etc.) and a question mark; below are four shapes. You have 30
seconds in which to select from the bottom shapes the one that replaces the
question mark and completes the sequence.

 Both Mental Detector and Shapes Happen offer Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty
levels. The Easy levels are far too easy to bother playing, although the Hard
level makes up for them.

 MENTAL BLOCKS on the Commodore looks good and plays fine. The graphics --
especially in Fits 3D -- are clear, colorful, and large. The joystick controls
all games. In Mental Detector and Shapes Happen, moving the stick in a cardinal
direction makes your selection. In Fits 2D, moving the stick forward and
backward rotates the falling block; moving the stick left and right moves the
block likewise; the fire button forces the shape to drop faster. In Fits 3D, the
stick and button function the same as in Fits 2D, while Function keys F3, F5,
and F7 perform the X, Y, and Z axes rotations.

 The MENTAL BLOCKS package comes with a "flippy" disk (copy-protected on both
sides) and an instruction manual for both versions. To abort a game in progress,
the manual suggests pressing the "Resume" key followed by a double-press of the
fire button. Since there is no such key, press the "Commodore" and "Run/Stop"
keys instead.

 While I greatly admire Spectrum HoloByte's TETRIS, part of its charm was
derived from the Russian folk music, colorful background screens, and extra play
features, all of which served to crank up the price. If you enjoy puzzles and
you're on a limited budget, MENTAL BLOCKS will substitute nicely.

 IBM-PC VERSION NOTES

 The IBM-PC version of MENTAL BLOCKS is at least as good as its Commodore 64
counterpart. Although play is identical, the games look much better, graphically
speaking.

 On the IBM, you'll need 256K of RAM. The program supports IBM PC/XT/AT and
compatibles, PS/2 models, and Tandy 1000 Series, 3000, and 4000 machines. Four
graphics modes are available: Hercules monochrome, CGA, EGA, and VGA color. I
played the game on a VGA monitor only, but since CGA and Commodore graphics
resolutions are more or less the same, you can assume that any of the supported
color schemes will look just fine -- VGA certainly did, and let's not quibble
over fifteen bucks.

 There are other differences, as well. The IBM version is totally
keyboard-controlled, whether or not your machine has a joystick port. Also, in
Mental Detector, the "folded" cube at the top of the screen can be rotated left
and right, making all but one side visible. The falling block configurations of
Fits and Pieces 3D are controlled with the arrow keys, the spacebar, and the
"D," "S," and "F" keys.

 The MENTAL BLOCKS package comes on one 5-1/4" "flippy" disk, copy-protected on
both sides (a 3-1/2" disk is available for $3), and an instruction manual for
both versions.

 Unlike HARRIER 7, MENTAL BLOCKS is a decent package. Both versions look fine,
and both offer easy play. For $14.95, you can't go wrong, especially if your
personal budget won't allow for the higher-priced TETRIS.

 MENTAL BLOCKS is published by Avantage and distributed by Accolade.
