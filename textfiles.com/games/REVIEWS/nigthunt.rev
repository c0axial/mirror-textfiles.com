NIGHT HUNTER: IBM VERSION NOTES

      Night Hunter.  A new unique game concept.  A game which allows the player
to take the role of the vampire, rather than the vampire hunter.  A game which
should have shed a  dark, new, and entertaining light on things.  Unfortunately
the IBM version of Night Hunter is a flop.

      The graphics for the IBM version are of inferior quality, the animation
is average at its best, and joystick control leaves much to be desired.  Night
Hunter does not support a sound board, and the 'HAIR-RAISING sound effects'
promised on the back of the box are little more than the average bleeps you are
accustomed to from your PC speaker.  All in all the game is nothing more than a
sub-standard arcade game, based on a great concept.  Were it free-ware, perhaps
it would merrit mention, but being a commercial game it is definately inferior.

      To play the IBM version of Night Hunter supports CGA, EGA, and VGA, as
well as Keyboard or Joystick control.  640K is also required to play the game,
and it comes on four 5.25 disks.  Night Hunter is made by UBI SOFT
Entertainment Software.
