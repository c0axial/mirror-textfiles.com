 Even among the most sophisticated and well-heeled, murder (as
Shakespeare would say) will out. And someone, somewhere, will seek
to solve the perennial mystery: Whodunit? 

 Murder -- and the solution to murder -- is what CLUE MASTER
DETECTIVE is all about. CLUE MASTER DETECTIVE is the computer
edition of the famous Parker Brothers boardgame that originally
appeared in England in 1946, and became one of the most popular
boardgames ever. (This review is based on the IBM-PC version; Atari
ST version notes follow.) 

 CLUE is basically a "whodunit" type of game. Using your logical
ability, your deductive skills, and -- most of all -- your memory, 
you try to determine who the murderer is, which weapon he used, and
where he committed the crime. Every time you play the game (board or
computer), the combination is different. Is the culprit Madam Rose
in the carriage house with the poison? Monsieur Brunette in the
trophy room with the horseshoe? Or perhaps Colonel Mustard in the
library with his revolver? 

 The computer edition of CLUE is from Leisure Genius/Virgin
Mastertronic, a company responsible for bringing several other
boardgames to the computer. The successful creation of a computer
version of a popular boardgame is a formidable task; fans of "the
original" tend to ferret out the slightest deficiency. But Virgin
Mastertronic has done a superb job with CLUE, and the computer
edition is an accurate rendition. The only boardgame feature that's
missing is the inclusion of little tokens (which always got lost, 
anyway) -- guns, knives, ropes, and pipe wrenches. 

 CLUE MASTER DETECTIVE allows you to play against two or more
computer opponents. Two, three, or more human players (with
additional computer opponents) may also play. You can select the
level of your computer opponents' ability. The game requires that
you have a good memory, decent thinking skills, and a willingness to
take some notes. But this simply adds to the challenge. 

 The IBM-PC version supports both CGA and EGA graphics modes. EGA
graphics are excellent; CGA graphics are good. The colors are
appropriate, the detailing is fine, and during some segments of
play, you "zoom" in for a better view of the "on-board" action. (A
Hercules monographics-compatible version is available for $5.00 by
mail from the company.) 

 The program offers pull-down menus, so a mouse or joystick is
helpful (although optional). However, keyboard play isn't
difficult. The IBM-PC version includes sound, the ability to print
out information about the game, and several other nice features
designed to augment play. The only (very minor) glitch I encountered
occurred when I quit the game: The computer rebooted instead of
returning to DOS. 

 CLUE requires 512K of RAM and DOS 2.1 or higher to run on the IBM
PC/XT/AT or compatibles. The game also runs on the Tandy 1000; the
Tandy graphics card and music device are supported. No other music
or speech cards are supported. The program is not copy-protected in
any way, and is easily installed on a hard disk. 

 ATARI ST VERSION NOTES 

 The Atari ST version of CLUE MASTER DETECTIVE looks good and plays
at least as well as the IBM version reviewed above. The basic
"board" graphics are fine, as are the animated scenes of suspects
entering rooms. The murder scene that opens the game is so colorful
and clear, it's downright startling -- even for the ST. It could've
come directly from an Amiga or an IBM with a VGA card; that's how
good it is. 

 The ST version requires 512K and a color monitor, and except when
you change a suspect's name, CLUE is completely controlled via the
mouse and pulldown menus. Also, there are print functions: Print
Note provides a list of the ten suspects, the twelve locations, and
the eight possible murder weapons; Print Game provides a printout of
all suggestions and accusations made by all players up to that point
in the game. 

 Player comments can be toggled. The Fast Game option toggles the
animated scenes of characters entering rooms, and all players can
see the notesheets that the computer keeps track of. The package
comes with one copy-protected disk and an instruction manual. 

 Leisure Genius has brought us SCRABBLE and MONOPOLY, as well. 
Although SCRABBLE is the best of the lot, CLUE MASTER DETECTIVE is a
faithful translation of the popular boardgame, and a really good one
-- even without the tokens. 

 CLUE MASTER DETECTIVE is published by Leisure Genius and
distributed by Virgin Mastertronic.
