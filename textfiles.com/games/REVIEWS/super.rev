 SUPERMAN: THE MAN OF STEEL is an action/arcade game published by First Star
Software and distributed under the Capstone label by IntraCorp. It offers
excellent graphics, sound, and animation; eight scenarios; mouse or joystick
control; and copy protection. The Atari ST version, for which you'll need 512K
and a color monitor, is the basis of this review.

 According to IntraCorp, the SUPERMAN storyline depends on the computer you're
using. In this ST version, it concerns a pact between two of Superman's
perennial enemies, Lex Luthor and Darkseid, who are using a geo-disrupter to
destroy Planet Earth. This heinous conspiracy has been uncovered by Professor
Corwin of S.T.A.R. Laboratories.

 As Superman, you make your way through eight games. Each scenario must be
successfully completed before the next can begin, and each further unravels the
plot, pushing it (and Superman, and you) toward the final battle: the
destruction of the geo-disrupter. Enroute to the Darkseid/LexCorp space station,
you'll battle the fireballs and concussion clouds of the Parademons, rescue
Governor Lee and Lois Lane from terrorists, journey through asteroid and
Kryptonite storms, and withstand heat-seeking missiles and robot defenses. Enter
the inner core of the space station, destroy the geo-disruptor, and you'll have
saved the day.

 The retaliatory powers at your disposal are Flight (standard in all scenarios),
Super Punch, Heat Vision, Telescopic Vision, Super Breath, and Super Kick. Not
all powers are available in all scenarios. You'll have three chances to finish
each game, and there is no save option.

 The ST screen display consists of a mini-comic book, which introduces each
game, followed by the colorful and smooth-scrolling graphics of the current
scenario. Appropriate powers are selected from the "Icon Bank," below which is a
strength bar that shrinks as Superman uses the power you've selected. A
diminished power can be replenished by not using it, and you can use a different
power while the depleted one regenerates. Complete a scenario and a new
mini-comic will get you properly pumped up for the next game. Lose the three
Super-lives before completing any scenario and the game ends, which leads to a
emotionally feeble (but great looking) scene in the Fortress of Solitude.

 Superman can be controlled via either mouse or joystick. Moving the mouse
directionally moves Superman likewise, and is identical to moving the stick. The
left button (or the joystick button) uses the current power; the right button
(or the Spacebar) cycles among the powers in the Icon Bank.

 The SUPERMAN package comes with two copy-protected disks, a Code Card used as
an additional form of copy protection, and an ST/Amiga instruction manual.

 The three-dimensional graphics and animation of SUPERMAN are excellent, and
both mouse and joystick are effective controllers. Overall, though, THE MAN OF
STEEL is much like MIAMI VICE (also from IntraCorp). So is my reaction: The game
is nicely designed, looks great, and plays fine, but I can't get anywhere with
it. Superman is only slightly more effective than MIAMI VICE's Crockett and
Tubbs (who, of course, are media stars, not superheroes), and no more effective
than Spider-Man and Captain America in DR. DOOM'S REVENGE, which is to say, all
five of them should be sent immediately to the nearest rest home.

 Not including TRUMP CASTLE, all IntraCorp games have given me major problems.
They simply come off as more difficult than they should be: These are supposed
to be games, not jobs. Nevertheless, SUPERMAN: THE MAN OF STEEL does look good,
and it does have the potential to play well. It'd be negligent to dismiss it
abruptly. Like MIAMI VICE, SUPERMAN deserves a pre-purchase playtest.
