 Bountiful, Utah is the location of Access Software, publishers of LINKS: THE
CHALLENGE OF THE GAME. The clear, clean air of Bountiful must've had a positive
effect on the folks at Access Software, because they've produced a fine golf
simulation. (This review is based on the IBM-PC version.)

 LINKS, however, is not for everyone. To begin with, it can only be played on
machines equipped with a VGA monitor. Secondly, to really enjoy the game, you
need to play it on a _very_ fast machine: Anything less than a 20MHz 386
computer with a 16-bit 512K VGA display is not a whole lot of fun, due to the
awfully slow screen redraws. If you do have this type of equipment, or if you
can stand to wait 10 to 15 seconds (or so) between screens, then LINKS may be
the golf simulation you've been waiting for.

 LINKS offers some attractive features not found in other computer golf
simulations -- most notably, the realistic scenery and views of the course. In
terms of raw detail, LINKS displays more things onscreen than any other golfing
program.

 The game also includes the most comprehensive set of variables that has ever
faced a computer golfer. You may adjust your stance (opened, closed, and many
combinations in-between), and you may play the ball either forward, or more
toward your right foot (only a right-handed golfer is simulated). Other features
include: variable wind speed and direction; a clubhouse option (in which you can
select the types of clubs to carry); unlimited mulligans; forward and reverse
angle replays; various types of swings (chip, draw, fade, etc.); realistic
nature sounds (as well as some humorous comments from your imaginary playing
partner); and the absolutely best digitized golf swing anywhere.

 LINKS uses a "swing arc" instead of the "swing bar" that most golf sims rely
on. The swing arc is a good idea, and more realistically represents the golf
swing motion. Unfortunately, it is somewhat confusing, in that the start/stop
keystrokes are different from the other strokes when you are putting.

 LINKS also features an "aiming bar," or pole, to line up shots, an improvement
over other simulations that use 2-D aiming devices. LINKS' 3-D aiming bar is a
little harder to use effectively, but it affords the skilled golfer greater shot
control.

 Some of LINKS' greatest strengths are also its greatest weaknesses. For
instance, in order to be as graphically accurate as possible, LINKS draws every
object, no matter how far away it appears. With LINKS, it doesn't matter that a
tree is 500 yards away, and that no golfer on the face of the earth could
possibly hit it; the tree is still drawn. This has two major drawbacks: First,
it significantly increases the amount of time it takes to completely draw each
screen; secondly, the increased detail tends to clutter the screen, making it
difficult to see where you are (or are supposed to be) aiming. For example, it
is extremely difficult to see the flagstick on approach shots. Most times I have
to squint at the screen and try to guess whether I'm looking at the flagstick or
part of the background.

 My biggest beef with LINKS is not so much the wait time between screen redraws,
but the lack of clarity onscreen. What good is graphic detail if you can't tell
a tree from a flagstick? Since I'm very familiar with JACK NICKLAUS' UNLIMITED
GOLF AND COURSE DESIGN from Accolade, I wanted to get an objective opinion from
someone who didn't have any previous biases. I asked a friend of mine who has
never seen or played either JACK NICKLAUS UNLIMITED (JNU) or LINKS to look at
the scenery of both games and tell me what he thought. My friend said the
graphics on JNU are better, since they're easier on the eye.

 Ultimately, there is a fine line between detail/realism and
clarity/playability. Everyone would like to see scenery as clearly and
distinctly as on "The Masters" television show. But to achieve such super
accuracy and clarity, the simulation would need to run on something like a Cray
super-computer. Therein is the rub.

 Many of the features that make JNU and PGA TOUR GOLF from Electronic Arts such
fun simulations are missing from LINKS. PGA TOUR GOLF comes with three courses
(more planned), and JNU has literally hundreds of courses available (thanks to
the course-designer feature). But LINKS has only one. I hate to sound so
negative, but the course included with LINKS (Torrey Pines) is really boring.
There's hardly any water to jazz things up, and since that's the only
course...well, you get the picture (yawn).

 Besides the occasional (sometimes not-so-occasional) initial release bugs, it's
the grid overlay that really bothers me. LINKS allows you to overlay a grid when
you putt. This is a great help in lining up putts. The problem is that after
each and every putt, you must turn on the grid. Since I routinely three-putt,
that becomes rather irksome. I don't know why Access didn't make this a toggle
on/off option.

 Monitoring various BBS discussions around the country regarding LINKS, I was
quite surprised by the number of people who were wholly unsatisfied and had
returned the game. While I don't think LINKS is as bad as that, it has a long
way to go to catch either JNU or PGA TOUR GOLF, currently the two best golf
simulations around.

 LINKS has no statistics function to speak of: It doesn't even keep track of the
best rounds, let alone the longest drive, closet to the pin, etc. The wealth of
statistics in PGA TOUR GOLF put to shame what few stats LINKS does include.

 Access Software has plans to enhance LINKS by providing (over the next year or
so): additional courses; female and black male golfers; a caddy; Match, Skins,
and Best Ball Play; more animation and sound effects; 386 support; tournament
and modem versions; a CD-ROM version with aerial fly-bys and Points of Interest
graphics; a course architect; and more.

 To Access's credit, the company has been very responsive to user input. In
fact, it has posted several updates to the software [GO GAMPUB] since its
initial release. It's this kind of commitment to customer service that will keep
a loyal following of LINKS owners coming back for more. This is important, since
additional revenue can be generated by selling extra course disks. And only
through additional courses can Access hope to keep interest alive in its golf
simulation.

 I just can't help but assume that Access Software released LINKS much sooner
than it would have preferred, just to get the cash flow going. The manual
included with LINKS is pretty bad; it looks like it was hastily slapped
together. Access should have taken notice of the fabulous job Accolade did with
the manual included with JNU, and made its documentation similar. If Access had
waited until some of the more basic features of golf sims (Best Rounds,
Statistics, more courses) could be included, or until some advanced features
(e.g., computer players and a course designer) were added, then LINKS might have
set the computer golf world on fire.

 LINKS runs on IBM PS1/PS2/AT/286/386 or compatible computers. It requires VGA
or MCGA, 640K, and a hard drive; a mouse is strongly recommended. The software
supports extended and expanded memory, RealSound, AdLib, Soundblaster, IBM PS/2
Speech Adaptor, Msound, mouse, and joystick. Fortunately, the game is not
copy-protected in any way.

 No doubt about it: Access has laid a solid foundation upon which a great golf
simulation can be built. It will take some time and many enhancements, but the
basic "golf engine" is there. Access just needs to add a lot of bells and
whistles so that LINKS can reach its potential as a premier golf simulation.

 LINKS: THE CHALLENGE OF THE GAME is published and distributed by Access
Software.
