 SKATE WARS is a futuristic sports simulation written and published by Ubi Soft
and distributed by Electronic Arts. A combination of soccer and hockey, SKATE
offers fine graphics and animation, 50 levels, two-player mode, joystick or
keyboard control, save option, and copy protection. The Commodore 64/128 version
is the basis of this review.

 Ubi Soft has taken the less-is-more approach to SKATE WARS by using only the
most basic elements of soccer and hockey: an ice rink and a soccer ball (you
can't get more basic than that). The rules of SKATE take the less-is-more maxim
and rip it to pieces by using an approach that can only be described as
few-are-way-too-many. This sounds primitive, and indeed it is, but this
simplicity makes SKATE a speedy and exciting game that's fun to play.

 SKATE is played on a hockey rink. Each team has four players: a goaltender, a
striker, and two substitutes. The striker is the player who handles the ball,
and he's under your control; when he's killed, one of the two substitutes will
replace him. When all substitutes are dead and gone -- both teams earn an
additional substitute after every fifth level -- the game ends.

 The object of a one-player game is to reach and finish level 50. When either
team scores five goals, the match is over and both teams move to the next level.
If you destroy the computer team, you'll get a point bonus. A new
computer-controlled team will take the ice, and the game will then continue.

 In a two-player, you'll select a level (1-10), on which you'll remain until one
team or the other is destroyed. The object is to score as many goals as possible
and make sure you're the last player on the ice.

 The C64 screen display consists of the Controller Menu, where you select a one-
or two-player game, keyboard or joystick control, and which player will use
which control device. The Main Menu follows, and from it you can select the
players on your team, study their vital statistics, toggle sound and music,
toggle the scoreboard (it appears after each goal), and change team names.

 The game screen consists of a hockey rink that scrolls horizontally according
to player movements. You must guide your striker around the ice and put the ball
in the goal, as well as use whatever tactic necessary to prevent your opponent
from putting the ball in your goal. Level 1 is just the rink and the players,
but subsequent levels add hazards, such as crevasses, holes, disintegrators,
pillars, spiked balls, ramps, and bumpers: These are the only things that kill
strikers.

 SKATE is controlled with a joystick or the keyboard. The stick moves the
striker in all directions; the button will, depending on what you're doing at
the time, kick the ball or jump the striker over obstacles. Keystrokes Z, X, K,
and M substitute for stick actions; keystroke C replaces the button. In a
two-player game, at least one player must use a joystick.

 The SKATE WARS package comes with one copy-protected disk and an instruction
manual. The Commodore key pauses the action, at which point the F1 function key
will bring up the Save and Load function, for which you'll need a
previously-formatted disk.

 SKATE WARS is a nifty game, well-suited to the C64 (although it would be
equally well-suited to an ST or Amiga). The graphics are very good, animation is
smooth and glitch-free, and both controllers worked fine. Since only the
obstacles can kill a striker, you're more or less free to kick, trip, and
otherwise lambaste your opponent: Whatever you have to do to get the ball is
legal. SKATE WARS is a neat C64 game, easy to learn and easy to play.

 SKATE WARS is published by Ubi Soft and distributed by Electronic Arts.
