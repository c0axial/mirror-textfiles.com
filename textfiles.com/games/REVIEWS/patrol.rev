
 THE LOST PATROL (IBM VERSION NOTES)

 The IBM version of THE LOST PATROL comes on six 5-1/4" floppies (3-1/2"
diskettes available separately), which can be copied onto your hard disk. A
batch file is provided to simplify the process, if you prefer. Keep those
original diskettes handy, though, because THE LOST PATROL uses the key disk
method of copy protection. DOS 3.3 or later is required, as is a full 640K of
RAM.

 Once you've booted the game, you're greeted with a series of configuration
menus. First, select the language (French and Spanish are available as well
as English). Next, select keyboard or joystick control. Finally, select the
graphics mode: VGA, EGA, or Tandy 16-color modes (note no support for CGA or
Mono). VGA mode seems to represent EGA emulation; the more detailed screens
only offer 16 colors. Audio is limited to sound effects here and there, and
no audio boards are supported.

 THE LOST PATROL offers a still-frame intermission screen after each move.
Since there are a limited number of these, it quickly becomes repetitive.
There's no way to disable this "feature," nor does there seem to be a way to
speed it up. You'll just have to sit there and count to ten after each move.
Another, perhaps more important, problem with THE LOST PATROL is that there
is no way to save a game in progress. With a lengthy, multi-character game
such as this, one would think that this would be an essential feature.

 There's a small error in the manual, which lists the Control-Escape key
combination as a way to quit the game. Hitting these keys merely restarts the
game; the only way to quit is to reboot.

 THE LOST PATROL is published and distributed by Ocean Software.
