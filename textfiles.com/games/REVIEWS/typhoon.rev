 TYPHOON OF STEEL is an advanced level tactical simulation of World War II unit
actions, and it comes from Gary Grigsby and Strategic Simulations, Inc. Mr.
Grigsby wrote WARSHIP, KAMPFGRUPPE, and MECH BRIGADE (and many other SSI war
simulations); TYPHOON is considered a sequel to PANZER STRIKE! The Commodore
64/128 version is the basis of this review; Apple II version notes follow.

 With seven historical scenarios and a campaign game, the incredibly detailed
TYPHOON encompasses three theaters of battle: Asia, Europe, and the Pacific.
What's more, it qualifies as a construction set as well: New scenarios can be
constructed, either by the computer or from the specific terrain features of a
personally-designed map.

 The scenarios in the Pacific are Iwo Jima and Okinawa's Kakazu Ridge; the
scenarios in Asia are Kamper in Central Malaya and Kohima in Burma; and those in
Europe are D-Day's Omaha Beach, Brittany's Bocage Waltz, and Peiper On Point in
Belgium. For a Campaign game, the computer generates several scenarios, and
creates missions and objectives. A Campaign game spans years of the World War II
conflict, and can cover more than one theater of battle.

 The C64 screen display consists of a scrolling map that can be as large as
60x60; each block represents 50 square yards. During play, the on-screen
Tactical map is 20x10; at the Strategic level, the map is 40x20: These maps can
be toggled, by way of the "Z" key, at any time during a game.

 TYPHOON is controlled entirely with keystrokes. Number keys (1-8) move the
block cursor around the screen. Single-letter keystrokes allow you to perform
the following functions: access units; clear away units to reveal the terrain;
change facings; inspect enemy units; display objectives; set target squares;
turn control of selected units over to the computer; toggle map displays;
commence combat; cancel orders; and an awful lot more.

 There are two phases to a game: Orders and Combat. During the Orders Phase,
you'll give all movement and combat orders to the units under your control. The
Combat Phase will attempt to carry them out. Each Combat turn is made up of
three pulses. Pressing the "O" key at any time during a turn will abort combat
at the end of the third pulse, allowing the introduction of new orders. If you
don't give new orders, the game will pulse away until all turns have been
exhausted and the scenario comes to a halt.

 In addition to interrupting the combat flow to give new orders, during the
Combat Phase you can toggle the following: sound effects; unit symbols and
terrain features; tactical and strategic maps; and game pause.

 After each Combat turn (assuming you've pressed the "O" key to halt the
pulsing), you'll have the option of saving the game. You'll need a blank disk
for this, and it can be initialized from within the game.

 Building a Scenario (from the Main Menu) allows you to create a completely new
battle. The computer will generate a map and select the forces, or you can build
a map using the available terrain features, such as woods, buildings, open
fields, hills, roads, swamps, sand, and cities.

 The size of a battle and the time period must be selected. A newly-created map
can be re-sized; you or the computer can select the necessary forces, and
computer-controlled enemy units can be edited; forces can be deployed by the
computer, or you can do it yourself. When all units have been deployed, you can
save the newly-created scenario, after which you will enter the first Orders
Phase.

 The TYPHOON OF STEEL game package comes with two double-sided disks, an
Instruction Manual, and a Briefing Manual. The Instruction Manual is organized
with typical SSI clarity. TYPHOON operates more or less identically to PANZER
STRIKE!; any changes are highlighted. The Briefing Manual lists all kinds of
unit and formation data, weapons and terrain effects charts, and short notes
concerning the scenarios. Although the disks are not copy-protected, the game
checks occasionally to see if you have the Briefing Manual.

 Like its predecessor, TYPHOON's incredible detail flirts with unruliness. There
are a zillion weapons, including mines, large guns, flamethrowers, and bazookas;
there are all kinds of tanks and artillery. The Manuals, especially the Briefing
Manual, help immensely with the task of understanding all the factors involved.

 Scenarios -- even the long Campaign game -- are enjoyable, thanks to the
precision and ease with which the SSI play system works. Should you decide that
any function you might be executing from a given menu is less than desirable,
you can abort it. The computer will build a new scenario quickly -- the
equivalent of an endless supply of scenario disks. Designing a scenario yourself
is a major project that requires lots of time.

 The advanced level TYPHOON OF STEEL is as detailed and excellent as PANZER
STRIKE!, in whose battle trenches it follows. It is not for novice wargamers,
but it will definitely give veterans plenty to do.

 APPLE II VERSION NOTES

 As far as gameplay is concerned, the Apple II version of TYPHOON OF STEEL is
identical to the Commodore 64 version. The difference lies in the quality of
quality of the screen displays which, on the Apple, are not very good; in fact,
it would be better if play were possible from the pictures on the back of the
package. On an Apple-compatible Laser 128, the graphics quality is marginal.

 Like the C64 version, TYPHOON is controlled with keystrokes. The Apple version
supports a second disk drive. The two double-sided disks are not copy-protected,
but you'll have to use a commercial program to make backups, because SSI uses a
non-standard DOS.

 Most Apple II programs I've seen look crummy; in some cases, "crummy" is
putting it mildly. TYPHOON OF STEEL looks okay when compared to most Apple
programs. Because it is a top-notch simulation that plays easily (due to the SSI
game system and not anything that has to do with Apple hardware), I recommend
it. But it'll help if you can play with your eyes closed.

 TYPHOON OF STEEL is published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. and distributed by
Electronic Arts.
