 Fans of arcade games are a lot like action movie buffs. They expect every new
release to be more powerful and grandiose than the last one, with plenty of new
bells and whistles. But not every new release can be a blockbuster, and such is
the case with Fanfare's EYE OF HORUS. (This review is based on the Amiga
version).

 Don't get the wrong idea: HORUS, with its good soundtrack and smoothly
scrolling graphics, is a nicely engineered game. But the competition in the
arcade genre is cutthroat, and HORUS doesn't quite deliver the "cutting edge
arcade action" that the back of the box promises.

 HORUS has a bizarre but interesting story line that should hold the attention
of most gamers, particulary those who enjoy fantasy-filled adventures. As Horus,
you are the son of an Egyptian king named Osiris, and you are bent on avenging
your father's death.

 The king was killed by his evil half-brother, Set, who tore his corpse into
seven pieces, and then scattered them throughout an Egyptian tomb. You, Horus,
must place your father's spirit at ease by finding the scattered bones and
defeating Set. Of course, there will be many obstacles along the way, and you
must conquer them, one by one.

 Such an interesting plot is one of HORUS's highlights, and it helps make up for
the cumbersome copy protection, which seems too extensive for a game that's only
above-average. You are requested to enter a six-digit code from a four-page
manual. That seems easy enough, but the manual is printed on dark burgundy paper
designed to discourage photocopying. The paper is so dark, and the black code
numbers so hard to read, that you'll have to hold the manual under a lamp to see
what you're doing.

 Without meaning to be harsh, I find this a deplorable method of copy
protection. I simply cannot agree with any form of copy protection that
encourages eye strain, and that is the case here. As if that weren't enough,
there is also on-disk copy protection that prevents you from making a backup,
and only the IBM version can be installed on a hard disk! (HORUS, which comes on
a single disk, runs on A500s and A2000s with at least 512K of RAM. A joystick is
required.)

 Fortunately, nothing else is aggravating about HORUS, and it's really quite
enjoyable. Move the joystick up and you can move about in the tomb as a hawk;
move it down and you're in human form. In either case, you'll be able to fire
bullets, darts, and other weapons at your many attackers.

 As you go about, zapping everything in sight, you'll discover items (such as
keys to locked elevators) to place in your inventory, in order to make winning
easier. And of course, you'll stumble upon the needed seven body parts.

 All this talk about body parts and tombs may make HORUS seem morbid, but it
isn't. It's a nice little game with a different story line, but although the
colors are rich and full, the game does not break any new ground in graphics,
sound effects, or playability. Catch this one after it has been marked down a
few dollars.
