 Origin's SPACE ROGUE is a spaceflight combat simulator that blends role-playing
and arcade features. It's similar in many ways to ELITE and UNIVERSE II. (This
review is based on the 64K Apple II version; Commodore 64/128 and IBM-PC version
notes follow.)

 A joystick and color monitor are recommended. The disks are not copy-protected
(although the game is "manual-protected"), and you are encouraged to play from
copies.

 The single role-playing attribute is "repute," i.e., your reputation as a
combat pilot. Each victory in combat increases repute, and when your repute
increases, you're given missions that aren't assigned to a neophyte pilot.

 You begin the game on board a trading ship, but while you're investigating an
abandoned scout ship (via EVA), Manchi ships suddenly attack, destroying your
home vessel and leaving you stranded on the scout.

 Your first challenge is to pilot the scout to a Space Station (you cannot land
on planets), where you can buy trade goods and improvements for your ship.

 While exploring, you meet people whom you can interview. Their information
helps you survive and directs you to additional missions. Initially, you have no
specific goal, outside of exploration, interviewing, and survival. Survival
methods include trading, piracy, and bounty hunting.

 In every Space Station, you can play an arcade game called HIVE! The game
involves fighting the Manchi (an insect race) on their home world. If you can
survive four levels -- it's difficult to make it through two -- you receive a
prize.

 There are only eight solar systems to explore. You travel between systems via
"Malir Gates" which lead to "worm holes." Each solar system has from one to four
of these gates. It's helpful to map your destinations from gate to gate, and to
keep track of the prices of goods in each of the solar systems. Buying goods
cheap and selling dear is one of your primary objectives. But be careful: Some
goods (like radioactives) don't last long.

 SPACE ROGUE's graphics are limited, but 64K is adequate. (Of course, the
graphics would have been much improved by using double hi-res. Is there anyone
who owns an Apple who isn't able to play a game with double hi-res?)

 The advertising for SPACE ROGUE stresses its role-playing aspects, but players
who are more comfortable with traditional CRPGs will not appreciate the game's
"stick happy" arcade/simulation facets. Because your advancement depends on your
ability to win battles via joystick controls, your arcade skills must be up to
snuff. I've enjoyed the interviews, and mastered traveling through the worm
holes and docking at Space Stations...but space combat still eludes me. The game
is certainly worth completing, but the learning curve is steep. (This was also
true of Paul Neurath's previous game: DEEP SPACE.) Nevertheless, CRPG fans who
relish arcade action should definitely consider SPACE ROGUE.

 COMMODORE 64/128 VERSION NOTES

 The Commodore 64 version of Origin's SPACE ROGUE operates much the same as the
Apple II version described in the main review above. Having seen the generally
bad Apple II graphics (double hi-res doesn't matter, and neither does the
particular game...all Apple II graphics are horrible), it's easy and correct to
assume that the Commodore's are better. Indeed, they're very colorful and
completely legible, and the 3-D POV animation effects are fine work.

 In order to save games in progress, you must make a backup copy of the boot
side of the program disk, an action that eventually leads to a documentation
check. The SPACE ROGUE package comes with one double-sided disk, the "Sunracer
Owner's Guide and Navigation Manual," "Stars of Opportunity" (a short story by
Neil Shapiro), an advertisement for HIVE!, a large map of the game's eight solar
systems, a piece of cardboard that can be folded into a pair of starships, and a
C64/128 Reference Guide.

 Like the Apple II version, the C64 program suffers from too much spaceflight
physics. Flying anything in SPACE ROGUE is terribly frustrating and soon turns
into a tutorial explaining why we can only be shuttle passengers, never shuttle
pilots. In great contrast is the CRPG aspect, which is as good as any around:
Eight solar systems provide more than enough places to visit, and there's lots
of exploration and character interaction. There's even a physics test.

 Spaceflight combat, however, is a lost cause that blunts any pleasure derived
from role-playing. Perhaps flight simulator pros will do better. Also, SPACE
ROGUE (and, by association, Origin) points out that HIVE! is the arcade game of
the century. That's incorrect: GAUNTLET II is the arcade game of the
century...but I understand why it wasn't mentioned.

 IBM-PC VERSION NOTES

 The IBM version of SPACE ROGUE takes good advantage of the machine's power.
Required is an IBM-PC/Tandy or 100% compatible, and 384K (512K if you have a VGA
card and wish to invoke the game's VGA/MCGA capabilities). A joystick is
recommended. Only one disk size is included in the box; be sure to read the
label on the side of the box to ensure that you're getting the correct disk
format.

 This is Origin's first conversion for the IBM that does not require a key disk
as copy protection; however, in lieu of a key disk, the manual is required for
certain portions of the game. Origin is to be commended for -- and encouraged to
maintain -- its move away from disk-based copy protection.

 The wide variety of graphics options supports all modes except Hercules
Monochrome. The VGA/MCGA modes are by far the most attractive, present in both
animated and non-animated sequences, and displaying 32 or more colors. In fact,
because VGA makes for quicker, smoother animation, the game runs significantly
faster and more fluidly in VGA than in EGA mode. You can force any mode you wish
when booting the game, as long as your graphics card supports it.

 With simple keyboard toggles, you may choose between mouse, keyboard, and
joystick for input. Be certain to read the reference card, which does an
excellent job of covering all the controls used in the game. Note that the
overall instruction booklet does _not_ mention specific keystrokes, so there's
no translating necessary between Apple II instructions/screen appearances and
their IBM counterparts. I was able to locate every command on the reference
card, except one: exiting the game!  Frustration yielded surprising results:
CTRL-ALT-DEL will remove you from the game and dump you at the nearest DOS
prompt.

 SPACE ROGUE can easily be installed on floppy or hard drive; you may specify
which hard drive to use if you have more than one, but the installation routine
always creates a subdirectory named SR. (Thus, be sure you don't already have an
SR subdirectory.) I had no problems copying and moving the game files once
installed, so there are no conflicts with disk defragmenters, etc.

 Taking into account the wise caveat in the main review -- that this CRPG
depends heavily on your space flight simulator skills -- SPACE ROGUE is a superb
hybrid game with elements of role-playing, strategy, and fast action. Origin did
a top-notch job porting it to the IBM, omitting only sound card support. I
recommend it most highly to the IBM gamer who enjoys a very eclectic and
challenging space adventure.

 SPACE ROGUE is published and distributed by Origin.
