 HERZOG ZWEI is one of the most innovative cartridge-based games I have ever
seen. It can best be classified as an arcade/war/strategy game. The world is at
war, and you play the part of either General Balsaga or General Ludwig. As
Ludwig, you are the rebel leader, trying to get through the forces of Herzog
Eins, the Supreme Commander. As General Balsaga, you lead Herzog's forces
against the rebels. (This review is based on the Sega Genesis version.)

 The battlefield is one of eight; each battlefield has a different layout and
terrain type. Throughout the battlefield there are bases. When you start the
game, most of the bases are neutral, depending on which battlefield you choose.
You and the other player have a main base, and you can take as many neutral
bases as the other player will let you have. From these bases, you deploy
troops. The troops consist of armored cars, tanks, anti-aircraft tanks, boats,
supply trucks, stationary cannons, infantry soldiers, and motorcycles.

 When the troops are deployed, you can give them orders. There are seven
different orders available. The more bases you are able to take control of, the
more money you will have in order to purchase troops. In the game, you are an
attack jet that can change into an air transport or an infantry soldier. You can
take an active part in the battle by changing into a soldier. Unfortunately, the
jet cannot attack ground forces; the attack jet can only be used to do battle
with the enemy jet. Changing into a soldier allows you to attack the enemy units
that have been deployed. After you have caused some destruction, you can change
back into the attack jet and head for the base. You must return to a base to
repair any damages, and to refuel.

 The innovative part of HERZOG is the way it mixes war/strategy into an arcade
environment. You must fly your jet over a base, or over the troops to pick them
up. This may not sound like much, but quick reflexes can help you get the units
deployed faster. Also, if you get into a dog fight with the enemy, you'll need
some rapid moves to get him off your back.

 Strategy is required in this game, too. You must know what kind of unit to
deploy and where to deploy it. You can only deploy a maximum of 50 units, so
knowing which goes where comes in handy. Also, you need to have a good idea of
which orders to give your troops, because this will affect the outcome of the
game. There are also some fairly interesting strategies you can think up
yourself.

 On the field of battle, the troops you have deployed carry out their
instructions. Hopefully, you can defend your bases well enough so that the enemy
cannot take them or destroy your main base. To win the game, you must destroy
the enemy's main base.

 HERZOG ZWEI is wonderful. The graphics are stunning, and the sound works well
with the game. HERZOG can be played with either one or two players. If you make
it through all the single-player-mode battlefields, you'll be greeted with a
beautiful ending. Make sure you play the entire game through for both the red
and blue sides. Each side has a different ending that will surely be a delight.
The only problem I noticed with the program is the slowdown that occurs when you
approach the maximum amount of troops. I don't think gameplay is hurt by this,
though.

 HERZOG is for any arcade gamer with a strategic side, or any strategist who
just wants to have fun!
