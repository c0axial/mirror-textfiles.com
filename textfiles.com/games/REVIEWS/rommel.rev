 ROMMEL: BATTLES FOR NORTH AFRICA, published by Strategic Studies Group of
Australia and distributed by Electronic Arts, is a tactical desert-warfare
simulation from Roger Keating and Ian Trout. Mark Holman, Phil Niven, and David
Freer worked on the scenarios. This review is based on the Commodore 64/128
version; Apple // version notes follow.

 Other than a bogus glitch in the tutorial of an otherwise excellent instruction
manual, ROMMEL is yet another in a continuing series of "easy to learn, tough to
master" wargame simulations from SSG and the Keating/Trout design team. The game
features eight scenarios (including a hypothetical Invasion of Malta); SSG's
slick, easy-to-use, menu-driven game control (based on the play system that
first appeared in BATTLEFRONT); Warplan, for scenario design; and Warpaint, for
design and color control of the icon and terrain symbols.

 The C64 screen display consists of a scrolling map constructed of hexagons; the
ground scale is approximately 1 kilometer per hex. Icons represent the various
terrain features, such as ocean, foothills, cities, towns and villages, salt
marshes, and cultivated areas; icons also denote the various battalions and
items, including three types of infantry, artillery and assault weapons, mines,
parachutes, armor, and cavalry. The screen maps of the eight scenarios can be
viewed off-screen on a large, glossy, four-color map, which is included in the
game package.

 Like all SSG simulations, ROMMEL uses the gameplay system that first appeared
in BATTLEFRONT; like all SSG simulations after BATTLEFRONT, this gameplay system
-- although essentially identical to its predecessors -- has been modified to
reflect scenario differences more accurately. Regardless of these modifications,
play remains the same: All activities in ROMMEL are accomplished through a
series of interconnected menus. You can escape from each menu by pressing a
function key; orders can be aborted and redone (RUN 5, which starts the
simulation, is the sole exception).

 The ROMMEL system allows complete control of all aspects of play: Forces can be
studied and orders given; the whole map can be scrutinized for terrain features,
communications, objectives, and units of both sides. The C64's arrow keys cycle
through a menu's choices, highlighting each in turn; selections are made with
the RETURN key. As noted earlier, a function key lets you exit from the current
menu and return to the previous menu -- a process which can be continued back to
the Game Master menu.

 Once you've studied all the reports and given all the orders, RUN 5 sets the
simulation into motion. A battle turn is fought, movements are performed by the
computer, the results (in terms of victory points) are tallied and shown, and a
new turn begins.

 Major or minor handicaps are available to either Axis or Allied forces, which
is a way of altering the historical aspect of a given scenario. Should you
desire to observe and study rather than play, the computer can be set to run
both sides.

 Warplan is a series of Scenario Design menus with which you can alter an
existing scenario, either on your own or through the use of information provided
in SSG's wargaming magazine, RUN 5. An entirely new scenario can be designed
from the ground up, i.e., right from the size and terrain of the hexagonal map.

 Intimately tied to Warplan is Warpaint, a graphics/color editor for altering
the icons used in ROMMEL. The icons from one scenario can be transferred and
stored in another scenario; they can be altered and saved, or cleared and
forgotten.

 The Save-Game menu is used to format save-game and save-scenario disks. It also
lets you save and reload games in progress, save altered/new scenarios, and save
new or altered icons created with Warpaint.

 The ROMMEL game package consists of the game disk, a pair of menu cards, a
scenario map, and save-game labels. The instruction manual is utterly clear and
complete, with this exception: The first turn of the Tebourga Gap scenario, as
it's presented in the tutorial, is out of whack. The manual states that the
scenario begins on turn 2 of 11 turns; the screen shows that it's turn 3 of 11.
Subsequent manual information is in no way consistent with what's happening on
the screen.

 Whether or not you're familiar with SSG simulations, this won't be a major
problem. The tutorial itself, as it takes you through the turn, is accurate,
even if the results of the turn aren't.

 RUN 5, SSG's quarterly magazine for wargamers, is loaded with information, as
well as new scenarios. Using the magazine in conjunction with Warplan and
Warpaint leads to a better understanding of SSG game design.

 ROMMEL: BATTLES FOR NORTH AFRICA is a fine game, and a worthy addition to SSG's
ever-increasing lineup of excellent products. The menu-driven play system is as
easy to learn as ever, and everything works perfectly. Warplan is complicated in
the handling of scenario information, but it is also as simple to use as the
gameplay system. Warpaint is just plain fun.

 Another good one from the boys down under.

 APPLE // VERSION NOTES

 The Apple // version of ROMMEL is all but identical to its C64 counterpart.

 Having reviewed nearly all SSG war simulations, I didn't think it was possible
for me to encounter a problem. Needless to report, perfection remains elusive,
even in the computer world.

 The Apple // version of an SSG simulation allows the user to make one backup
copy of the master game disk. Once this has been done, the option is no longer
accessible, which I'd say is reasonably fair. Unfortunately, the Backup Master
routine of ROMMEL turned out to be a dismal failure.

 Furthermore, the scenarios can be backed up any number of times: again, a
dismal performance. After three tries I gave up. SSG reliability makes me think
I came across a disk with a bum routine.

 Since backup copies are alien to me, not having any for the Apple isn't so
horrible.

 In any case, ROMMEL for the Apple // plays just fine.
