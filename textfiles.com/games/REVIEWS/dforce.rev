 D.R.A.G.O.N. FORCE
 
 The IBM version of D.R.A.G.O.N. FORCE plays much like the Amiga version
described in the full review. The programmer of the IBM version obviously
wanted to keep the interface in each version consistent, even copying file
selector boxes used on the Amiga and the Atari ST.
 
 D.R.A.G.O.N. FORCE (which requires 640K) supports CGA, EGA, and VGA
graphics. The VGA graphics are clear for the most part, but they were not
amazing. (The Atari ST screen shots on the packaging are, in many respects,
better than the VGA graphics.) However, the EGA graphics use dark,
poorly-contrasting colors on several screens that were difficult to read,
although the commonly-used screens (such as those during the missions) were
easier on the eyes. There is no music aside from at the title screen, and
no sound card support.
 
 The game comes with three 5.25" low-density (360K) disks, although there is
an offer to exchange for 3.5" disks. The game is "use-protected" (as
Interstel calls their off-disk copy-protection). To start, you must go
through the common procedure of entering a word from the manual.
 
 D.R.A.G.O.N. FORCE can be installed to either additional floppy disks or a
hard drive. The installation program was a little strange in that it asks
for a directory for installation, and then creates a new DRAGON subdirectory
within the directory you specify. Since most installation programs create
the directory that you name, I had a little trouble figuring out why the
program refused to accept my choices.
 
 Other than slight problems getting the program to run with TSR's (when there
was more than enough free memory), D.R.A.G.O.N. FORCE ran without any
problems. Although it is probably not suited as a mass-market product, it
should provide plenty of excitement and challenge for the more dedicated
gamers.
 
 D.R.A.G.O.N. FORCE is published by Interstel and distributed by
Electronic Arts.
