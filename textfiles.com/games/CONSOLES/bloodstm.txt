NOTE: THIS GUIDE IS INTENDED FOR MACHINES WITH VERSION 2.10 ROMS INSTALLED.
      MANY MOVES AND DESCRIPTIONS IN THIS GUIDE ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE 1.x
      ROM RELEASES.  ALSO, THERE ARE A FEW ITEMS (SPECIALLY MARKED) THAT
      ARE FOR 2.20 ROMS ONLY AND WILL FAIL SILENTLY ON 2.10 ROMS
 
      EVEN WITH THE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR THIS GUIDE,
      ERRORS MAY EXIST.  THESE ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED AS SOON AS REPORTS
      ARE RECEIVED AND THE INFORMATION IS CONFIRMED.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE
      INFORMATION IN THIS FINAL GUIDE CAME FROM STRATA DOCUMENTS DIRECTLY,
      IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ANY ERRORS WILL EXIST.

This FAQ is also available via FTP thanks to the generosity of Andy Eddy of
GamePro magazine.  To access it, FTP to ftp.netcom.com and go to the
pub/vi/vidgames/faqs directory.  It'll be labeled quite obviously...I hope.
 
I have also put it in my FTP directory: pub/zi/zio  (same site)
 
Also, you can always mail me directly at zio@netcom.com and I'll mail you a
copy directly.  However, this may take a few minutes....or a few days....
depending on when I find your request.  If you have problems with braindead
or crap gateways that eat large mail, **let me know!**... this thing is 90K+
in this form!!!

C7 (IR1)
 
First Internet Release
 
 
C8 (IR1a)
 
MAJOR corrections needed!  <sigh>  Had some codes mixed up, missed a whole
section, etc.  Whatta mess.  I think I got this out in time to prevent
many people from getting c7...
 
 
C9
 
Mainly an aesthetic rearrangement.
 
 
C10
 
This was going to be IR2, but just before I was ready to post...
 
 
C11 (IR2)
 
2 new BIG HEAD characters confirmed, Ratchet bug found like Wraith bug,
and a few minor details corrected.
 
C12-C19
 
Another BIG HEAD, some aesthetic rearranging, and a vacation I decided to
stick in there somewhere.... :)
 
C20
 
This was going to be IR3...but a day before I was ready to release it, I
got mail from Richard Ditton (that's God as far as BLOODSTORM players are
concerned...) saying to watch my mail...
 
C21
 
No mail....I added a few more touches to the FAQ, and was going to send it
out, and suddenly...
 
C22
 
WHAM!!  I get this binhexed (argh) pile from Richard Ditton...unpack it
with no less than 7 binhex handlers to find one that interpreted it right,
found none, took the best one of the bunch, cleaned it up, and found the
COMPLETE Strata Bloodstorm Codes Reference in my hands (electronically,
that is...  I edited for days...
 
C23
 
And days.... (argh....too much stuff, and I'm creating a typeset version
of this that needs to be 100% re-engineered.  Aiiiieeeeeeee....!)
 
C24 (IR3 - FINAL!)
 
DONE!  Finally!!!  As far as I can see, I got everything in there!

C25
 
Oops... the 2-part format was a bit too big for some gateways, and I saw
a typo, so I fixed it.  :)  I decided not to split the thing up, because it
just became a living hell managing the complete version and the split parts.
So, I just labeled the TOC, and sent it out.  Also, like an idiot, I didn't
paste in the Elements Concept documentation for the nice new formatted Trash
Talk List section (D).  Fixed.  Also, in a moment of genius (?) I realized
that the Joystick Representation could use a little something extra... like
the buttons. :)  Fixed.  (Why the hell did I never do this before?!?)

The Story...
 
  The Mega War, fought centuries ago, left the earth in global ruins.  The
destructive nuclear horrors unleashed upon the planet and its population
created uncountable amounts of death and devastation.  In the wake of this
sweeping havoc arose the planet itself to retaliate against the violence
forced upon it.  Polar shifts and massive earthquakes swallowed entire
continents.  From seething seas and walls of water arose angry volcanoes,
spewing flame and death into the sky.  Hungry fires, searing blizzards, and
brutal storms ran rampant across the planet's surface for years, in an attempt
to wash away the man-made horrors that it was forced to endure.
 
  At last the earth settled into a new pattern, starting to find some
semblance of balance and peace.  The global changes had left a much harsher
planet, and the remaining life forms adapted slowly to the new environment.
The Earth's land masses, altered by man-made weaponry and ended through
elemental means, had evolved into ten isolated provinces.  The remaining
populations within these new provinces found life difficult at first, but
slowly evolution and natural selection allowed the human race to adapt and
once again gain control of their destiny.  Some of the provinces had strong
natural forces, exposed through the abrupt upheaval, and the resourceful
post-humans began to master these new powers.  Other provinces continued to
develop through the use of science and technology, creating elaborate life
support systems and protection against the harsh environments.
 
  As the years progressed, eight of the provinces began to communicate and
trade together.  An alliance was formed and a global quasi-government was
established.  The social structure evolved into a mixture of medieval
practices, hybrid technology, and barbarism and barter.
 
  Centuries have passed and the present day Earth finds mankind again at the
brink of savagery and destruction.  Life is now a series of hardships,
deceptions, and lies for the members of the Provincial Alliance.  The frozen
tundra of Polaria and the volcanic Scorch are very close to all out war,
halted only by the desolate, radioactive Death Zone that separates them.  The
Death Zone, once a founding member of the Planet Alliance, has remained silent
for almost two centuries, hiding behind the mysterious and deadly red mists
that define its borders.  Obsel, the desert province, has been taken over by
desperate and brutal female terrorists.  The Ebony Coast, known for its trade
and bartering systems, is now led by a mysterious and greedy leader whom no
one trusts, yet all must tolerate.  The people of Cyberia, a land inhabitable
only through technological means, have re-engineered their population, and are
losing their humanity to the machine.
 
  With tensions running high, the Planet Alliance is beginning to falter and
the provinces are no longer considered allies.  And now the High Emperor, the
one guiding force that all provinces had agreed to abide by, has been
mysteriously and horribly murdered.
 
  The ancient Provincial Agreement declares that a new ruler must be chosen
through combat between the rulers of each province.  Each province will come
prepared for battle with their own Gauntlet of Ascension, a gloved weapon that
only those in power may don.  These ancient gauntlets are treasured and
revered by their people, for they are the foremost symbol of power and honor
each province can have.
 
  But it is painfully clear that this tournament will not have the honor of
previous BloodStorm contests.  There have even been rumors that the combatants
will bring back the Sunder Attack, a brutal combat move that separated the
opponent's legs from his body without killing him.  This horrible and
humiliating maneuver has never been officially banned from the BloodStorm
contest, yet it is so brutal and degrading that no honorable combatant has
used it for centuries.  However, these champions from radically different
provinces are blind to the mysterious evil that surrounds the High Emperor's
death, and instead only see their opportunity for personal gain, provincial
expansion, or race domination and will do anything to achieve their goals.
 
 
                     The BloodStorm is about to begin!

BASIC DEFINITIONS
=================
 
JOYSTICK AND BUTTON REPRESENTATION : This is based on player facing opponent
                                     to the right, as usual.

       DOWNAWAY     |     DOWNFORWARD
                   DOWN
 
 
 
CIRCULAR MOVES : Many special moves in BLOODSTORM involve circular moves not
                 common in other fighting games.  In order to differentiate
                 between them, here are the definitions used in this guide:
 
Quarter Circle :                Curve from down to forward
                                (down, downforward, forward)

                                (down, downaway, away)

                                (up, upforward, forward)

                                (up, upaway, away)
 
Half Circle :                   Curve from away to forward via down
                                (away, downaway, down, downforward, forward)
 
Reverse Half Circle :           Curve from forward to away via down
                                (forward, downforward, down, downaway, away)
 
Upper Half Circle :             Curve from away to forward via up 
                                (away, upaway, up, upforward, forward)
 
Reverse Upper Half Circle :     Curve from forward to away via up 
                                (forward, upforward, up, upaway, away)
 
 
OTHER TERMS :
 
rep <button> :              Press a button fast and repeatedly.
                            E.G. : rep FRONT LEG
charge <direction/button> : Hold a direction or button for a certain length of
                            time to 'charge it up' for use in a special move.

Passable Powers :        Hellfire, Freeze Escape
Special Death Move :     CHAR DOG
 
Life in the searingly hot Scorch Province is one of constant warfare.  Located
South of the Death Zone, Scorch is at the planet's equator strewn with
volcanic activity.  Over the years, the inhabitants of Scorch have developed
an immunity to heat, and have the ability to store heat and release it at
will.  The Death Zone separates Scorch from Polaria, the frozen Province, and
these two radically different races are consumed with hatred for each other.
HELLHOUND is the fiercest fighter and most feared leader in the Scorch army,
and has recently proclaimed himself as the official diplomat and spokesperson
for the country.  He has reluctantly agreed to a number of peace summits and
trade conferences with the ritualistic Ice people, but has taken great
pleasure in turning these talks into pure chaos and violence.  HELLHOUND has
sworn to lead his people to total domination over the Ice province.

FREON
 
Home Province :          Polaria                    Gender :    M

Gauntlet Special Power : Ice-A-Rang                 Weight :    219 lbs
Passable Powers :        Ice Morph   
Special Death Move :     BLOODY SLUSHY
 
The fiercely cold Ice Province, Polaria, is North of the Death Zone.  The
people who inhabit this portion of the planet have become cold blooded and
require no heat to survive.  FREON is the sovereign ruler of the oppressed Ice
people, and is convinced that he is destined to be the ruler of the entire
planet.  FREON's arrogant nature has demanded a great deal of pomp and
circumstance in his life, and his subjects treat his wishes as Law.  FREON has
attempted many times to find his counterpart within Scorch, the Province that
warms the south, to accept his offer of surrender and domination.  However,
his regal demeanor is lost on HELLHOUND, who has concluded all talks of
subjugation with unpredictable chaos.  This lack of respect for his nobility
has pushed FREON to his limit.  He will have respect from the barbaric Fire
people if he has to destroy every last one of them.

FALLOUT

Gauntlet :               The Mephitic Fist          Height :    5 ' 11 ''
Gauntlet Special Power : Toxic Quills               Weight :    205 lbs
Passable Powers :        E.R. Cannon 
Special Death Move :     CRITICAL MASS
 
The Death Zone is a desolate, radioactive wasteland that separates Polaria and
Scorch.  Little is known about the Death Zone, as those who enter its borders
never return.  Although a founding member of the Planet Alliance, the Death
Zone has not been an active member for many centuries.  When the call to the
provinces went out announcing the BloodStorm Contest, the Death Zone was
forgotten.  As the contest day neared, a figure emerged from the toxic mists.
FALLOUT, the most feared quasi-leader of the Death Zone, demanded his rightful
place in the competition.  Although his participation in the tournament is
strongly protested by the rest of the Planet Alliance, FALLOUT is allowed to
fight through a centuries-old document created at the inception of the
Alliance.

Passable Powers :        Grenades, Land Mine 
Special Death Move :     OBICULARIS BOMB
 
MIRAGE is the militant leaser of Obsel, a harsh desert world where life has
become a continuous battle for survival.  For years the troubled race waged
fierce civil wars, until finally the male population was dangerously reduced
in numbers.  The female population, horribly oppressed by their male
counterparts, banded together and overthrew the weakened male-dominated
government.  MIRAGE is the direct descendant of the leader of the Great Female
Uprising.  She continues to uphold the new laws that enslave men by cutting
off their feet at birth and raised in pens to be kept alive solely for
reproduction and nourishment.  MIRAGE has plans to lead her cannibalistic
women warriors and their terrorist lifestyles into the outer reaches of the
world, proving dominance over all men.

TEMPEST
 
Home Province :          Nimbus                     Gender :    F
Gauntlet :               The Windigo                Height :    5 ' 9 ''
Gauntlet Special Power : Windshift                  Weight :    114 lbs
Passable Powers :        Storm Shield
Special Death Move :     EXORCISM
 
TEMPEST is the daughter of the now dead High Emperor.  TEMPEST's ancestry was
controlled and crafted by the Royal Gene Matrix, to create the perfect human
specimen.  Her genealogy has also allowed her to develop the ability to
control concentrated air masses at close range.  Her early years were spent as
a pampered and catered Princess, until she was seduced by the handsome and
mysterious RAZOR.  The Gene Matrix, violently opposed to the affair, convinced
TEMPEST that RAZOR had secret plans to usurp the Crown and destroy the Royal
Family.  TEMPEST, her heart broken and trust betrayed, vowed never to be a
victim again.  She has dedicated herself to mastering all forms of personal
combat and controlling her elemental powers.  TEMPEST is a swirling mass of
emotions over the mysterious death of her father, the High Emperor.  She does
not feel a tournament should be held until her father's death is avenged.  Her
contempt for the other BloodStorm contestants is obvious, as she feels
strongly that she is the rightful heir to the throne.

RAZOR
 
Home Province :          Ebony Harbor               Gender :    M
Gauntlet :               The Natator                Height :    6 ' 4 ''
Gauntlet Special Power : Vorpal Disc                Weight :    240 lbs
Passable Powers :        Optic Laser
Special Death Move :     MEAT GRINDER
 
Years ago, the handsome and crafty RAZOR managed to seduce a young TEMPEST who
is the daughter of the Emperor.  The torrid love affair ended in scandal,
however, when the Royal Gene Matrix accused RAZOR of plotting the deaths of
the Royal Family as a means to attain the Crown.  During his first year of
torture in the Nimbus prisons, RAZOR was sold to TALON and taken back to
Cyberia.  There TALON experimented on RAZOR, replacing his arms and eye with
cybernetic technology.  Finally RAZOR managed a daring and desperate escape
from the Cyberian laboratories.  His escape led him back to the dark and
gritty underground of Ebony Harbor, his home province.  As the years went by,
RAZOR has managed to gain power by creating the underground Black Market
Network.  The often shady trading and supply system has become an established
necessity for all of the Provinces on the planet, and RAZOR, the enigmatic and
hardened ruler of the Ebony Coast, has had dealings of many kinds with all of
the leaders of the various Provinces.

Cyberia is the technological capital of the planet, and for decades all new
equipment and weaponry originated from there.  Unfortunately, the pollution
from the hundreds of manufacturing plants caused a horrible disease that
destroyed cell tissue at an alarming rate.  Having no medical experience, all
of the technological resources were turned internally to find a cure for this
affliction.  The result is a race of cyborgs, who have replaced most of their
biologicals with cybernetics.  TALON is the cold, unfeeling cyborg ruler of
the Cyberian Province.  TALON's original bio-programming had him dedicated to
finding a cure for the techno-virus.  This led him to other Provinces, where
he would kidnap healthy "bios" and perform unspeakable experiments in an
attempt to find a cure.  Among TALON's victims was RAZOR, who is the only
survivor of these heartless tortures.  Through his unfeeling and cruel
experiments, TALON has deduced that cyborg physiology is superior to that of
"bios", and that the Cyberian race must devote itself to converting the planet
to unfeeling, unthinking technobots.  For this reason, the rulers of all of
the Provinces hate and fear TALON and what he will do if he gains the throne.

Gauntlet Special Power : Earth Blaster (see GSP)    Weight :    426 lbs
Passable Powers :        Earthquake

TREMOR is the strongest and wisest of the long-lived Earthians, from the
Subterran Province.  These creatures are few in number but have lived for
centuries, nurtured by the mystical elemental forces that protect Subterra.
For years the Earthians lived underground, oblivious to the destruction and
waste that pervaded the other areas of the planet.  TREMOR was the first to
emerge from the mystical depths and become aware of the planetary strife and
destruction.  He traveled across the globe, offering ecological solutions to
hunger, strife, and pollution.  Unfortunately the rulers of the Provinces have
become jaded and suspicious, and no one would change their destructive ways.
TREMOR is completely frustrated by the blind resistance he has encountered,
and has started to feel that the only hope for the planet is to force his
changes upon the people of tthe world.  TREMOR sees the BloodStorm contest as
a chance to destroy the sickness and disease and bring a much needed cure to
the planet.

     This section explains the special requirements for getting to the eight
Secret Enemy Agents of Nekron hiding in BLOODSTORM.  All of the Agents fight
very well, and are tougher to beat than the regular fighters.  The good thing
is that even if you lose to them, you don't lose your game!  (Except for Sin,
who is really not hidden, and comes up when you beat all of the regular
fighters).
 
     When you have beaten all of the regular fighters, and all of the hidden
agents, you will get to see the credits, and at the end of the credits a code
is given to you.  Write down the code and the fighter you used, and the
telephone number it gives.  Ask for Leif, and give him the info.
 
You may appear in BLOODSTORM 2 - NEKRON STRIKES BACK!
 
     Also, remember that you can only get to any of these hidden characters
when you are playing a one player game.  OK, Here we GO!
 
 
                                    ======
                                    SHADOW
                                    ======
 
Origination Screen :    Any
Agent Location :        The Shadows
Accessibility :         Easy (depending on skill w/o block button)
 
     Shadow is a special agent of Nekron, who has the ability to render
himself invisible.  Through techno-elemental means, Shadow has the ability to
focus his mind, causing light to bend around his body, and become completely
invisible to the naked eye.  No one is sure who Shadow is, where he came from,
or how he manifested his extraordinary abilities.  The most popular theory is
that Shadow was once a particularly warped and powerful demon bounty hunter.
The demon was standing very near the spot where Nekron first appeared within
the pocket dimension after the Mega Bomb was detonated.  It is most likely
that the bounty hunter's body was disintegrated by the blast, but it may be
that the mystical energies that created Nekron also were absorbed by the
powerful assassin.  By sheer force of will, the demon was able to reassemble
his form, yet not enough to make himself visible.  Nekron's new powers,
however, allowed him to see this wounded soldier, and trained him to control
and master his new found abilities.  Shadow now waits within the shadows,
awaiting orders as to who to attack next.
 
     Shadow can be found from any background.  All you have to do is defeat
your opponent 2-0 (no round 3 allowed, folks....without using the Block button
in any match, and do the fatality on BOTH rounds.  You are then transported to
The Shadow World to fight Shadow.  Note that you cannot reach Shadow by
defeating a secret character in this way, unlike Blood.
 
Hint:   Sending the opponent into the Toxic Marsh counts as a fatality, so be
        sure to work this into your battle plan...
 
 
 
                                    =====
                                    GOLEM
                                    =====
 
Origination Screen :    Subterra
Agent Location :        Golem's Lair (in Subterra)
Accessibility :         Difficult
 
     Golem was created from the rotting carcasses of the local demons
slaughtered by Nekron.  Through the techno-magical powers Nekron gained
through high exposure to the Mega Bomb, he reconstructed and reanimated a
terrible and menacing creature from the victims of his experiments.  This
single-minded monstrosity now stalks the limitless underground passageways
within Nekron's lair, seeking an exit that will allow Nekron safe physical
passage back to his home dimension.
 
     In Subterra (the background with the cliffs on either side), there is a
spike hanging down from the ceiling, suspended over the cliff.  If you can
knock down the spike, it falls into the pit.  Then you just jump into the pit
and you will not get spiked, you will stand on top of the fallen spike and
enter through the door!  To knock down the spike, you need to hit it twice
with either your gauntlet or a projectile.  Simply jump into the air and do
the normal gauntlet throw move or whatever your projectile move is. Usually
your gauntlet will hit the spike and bounce back.  Sometimes it misses and
falls...bad news.  Remember, to pick up your gauntlet again go near it and do
AWAY+FA.  Fireballs, ice freezes, slime shots, tornadoes and rocks work too
(maybe more?) so you don't have to necessarily take a chance of losing your
gauntlet (although the gauntlet is easier).  Just remember to do them in the
air so they hit the spike.
 
Hint:   It is FAR easier to hit the spike with a projectile if you can sunder
your opponent.  If you can get their arms off as well, even better! (just
don't kill them in the process)  Then, get them as close to the edge as you
can, jump, and throw the projectile at the spike.  A very popular approach is
to fight someone who loses their arms easily - Razor loses arms with no
trouble!  Do a simple waiting game, perform a two hit combo (like D+BA and
then standing FA) twice.  This usually results in the loss of the back arm as
well as putting the opponent in danger of stun.  Then do the sunder.  (This
usually results in Razor losing not only his legs, but the front arm as well.
In otherwords, he's helpless!)  Push him to the end, step back one step, jump,
throw your gauntlet, then go back, pick up HIS gauntlet, and throw it at the
spike.  Jump over the mess and off the edge.  Easy.)
 
 
 
                                   ========
                                   DIMENTIA
                                   ========
 
Origination Screen :    Obsel Desert
Agent Location :        Triax
Accessibility :         Easy
 
     Dimentia is a demonic agent chosen and mind-bent by Nekron to do his
bidding.  Her natural psi-powers, including her potent third eye blast,
combined with her superb fighting skills made her a perfect candidate for
Nekron's army.  Dimentia has been the main instrument with which Nekron has
controlled events on Earth.  Using her powerful psi-mind from within the
portal of Triax, Dimentia has subtly altered decisions and perceptions of key
events throughout the planet.  These alterations have escalated tensions and
suspicions between the provinces to the boiling point, causing irrational
violence and a weakened alliance.
 
     In the Obsel desert, on the ground, amidst all those symbols, there is a
circular figure with five lines in it, like dividing a pie into five even
wedges.  Once the round begins, throw your gauntlet.  You can jump and ditch
it away, even.  You won't need it.  Move to the circular figure, and do the
move to pick up the gauntlet (BACK+<FA>).  The character will bend down and
touch the ground.  When the character touches the circular figure, a portal is
activated and the character is transported to Triax, to fight Dimentia.  The
portal isn't exactly on the circle.  If you are facing right, stand EXACTLY on
the circle and hit the left line of the birthday cake (?).  If you are facing
left, hit the circle.
 
Hint:  Of course, you may want to fight the opponent for a while, to weaken it
       enough that you can safely attempt the portal activation.  However, the
       procedure should be no problem...
 
 
                                   =======
                                   CRANIAC
                                   =======
 
Origination Screen :    Black Armada
Agent Location :        Catwalk
Accessibility :         Moderately Easy
 
     When Nekron first tested his new power against the population of his
prison dimension, he destroyed half of the demonic race, including their
greatest leaders and toughest fighters.  Nekron later used his
techno-elemental power to graft the brain of a demon stealth assassin, whose
body was destroyed beyond repair, to a techno-organic battle suit.  The result
is Craniac, a maniacal and dangerous warrior assassin.  Craniac's assignment
has been to subtly influence tensions and suspicions between Provinces by
damaging and poisoning goods and services within the Global Trade Network and
the Black Market Network.
 
     Craniac is a robot creature with an exposed brain that has a metal jaw
attached to it. You get to him from the Black Armada background.  (This
background is the one with a catwalk in the distance.)  Getting to the back
platform is the key. Hold BLOCK and move UP two or three times to jump back to
the far away platform.  Moving left or right makes you switch sides, down
keeps you still, and up or center makes you come right back to the front.  To
get to Craniac, jump back to the platform three times and hold down each time
you get back there, in order to get as much time back there as possible.  5
seconds after returning from the third trip, a small Craniac will fly onto the
platform.  While he is there (he doesn't stay very long), jump back there
again to be with him, holding down to wait there.  The game will freeze and a
message will come up stating that you will fight Craniac!  The background then
scales up and you fight full size!
 
Hint: Do NOT go back to the catwalk after the third trip UNTIL YOU SEE CRANIAC
      ON THE CATWALK.  Craniac MUST land on the catwalk before you.  If you go
      back a fourth time before Craniac lands, you will have to come to the
      front and jump back again.  Since Craniac does not stay very long on the
      catwalk, it is very possible that he'll leave before you can retry, and
      he will NOT come back that round.
 
 
 
                                    ======
                                    WRAITH
                                    ======
 
 
Origination Screen :    Scorch HQ
Agent Location :        Southern Abyss
Accessibility :         Very Easy (after victory at Scorch HQ, that is...)
 
     Wraith is clever and devious, and even Nekron cannot completely trust
this unreadable assassin.  Wraith was recruited from the small group of elite
demonic rulers that governed the pocket dimension.  When it became painfully
obvious that Nekron would soon take control of their world, Wraith turned his
back on his people, and offered his services to Nekron.  Although Wraith has
followed orders to the letter and has always been a loyal agent, his cold
silence and stealth-like demeanor give the impression that he has ulterior
motives all his own.  Wraith monitors the ongoing tensions between the Fire
and Ice people, and in countless subtle ways has helped to escalate the bad
blood between races.
 
     Wraith is found from the Scorch HQ background.  You get to Wraith by
entering a 'trash talk' password (more on those in Appendix A) after you win a
match on this background. 
 
The password is UP UP UP Block.
 
When you enter the correct password, WRAITH SUMMONED appears on the screen.
You will be taken to the Southern Abyss, a screen where you fight Wraith on a
wooden bridge over lava pits.
 
Hint:   Do NOT enter a "Travel Code" after summoning Wraith, unless you like
        the idea of fighting Wraith on the Character Selection Screen with a
        10 second time limit instead of 90...
 
 
 
                                     ===
                                     SIN
                                     ===
 
 
Origination Screen :    After completing all 8 main battles
Agent Location :        Chamber of Pain
Accessibility :         n/a
 
     Sin is the only agent to be virtually unchanged by Nekron's ascension to
power in her home dimension.  Even before Nekron's arrival, Sin was doing what
she does now...killing.  Sin is completely uninterested in politics or power,
and cares not who is giving the orders, as long as she has victims to torture
and kill.  Rarely if ever leaving her cherished Chamber of Pain, Sin waits for
her daily ration of victims that will satisfy the blood lust within her.
Nekron, amused by this single-minded, cold-blooded killer, keeps Sin happy and
satisfied by giving her the weak and the traitorous from his kingdom to do
with as she pleases.  It is said that no one will ever combat Nekron, for they
must face Sin first.
 
     Sin isn't really hidden, but she is listed in the handbook as an Agent of
Nekron, and she is also on the Agent screen at the end of the game.  When you
beat all of the regular eight fighters, you will fight Sin in the Chamber of
Pain.  The Chamber of Pain has moving walls that slowly close in on you as you
fight.  Sin has a whip that is very long, and she is VERY quick.  She is
wearing a skimpy black leather outfit and a leather mask.  Also, if the walls
get close enough together, spikes will shoot out of the walls and run you
through!   Sin is not hurt, but YOU die.  The clock is at about 20 when the
spikes come out.
 
 
 
                                   =======
                                   RATCHET
                                   =======
 
 
Origination Screen :    Nimbus
Agent Location :        Eye of the Bloodstorm
Accessibility :         Difficult
 
     Ratchet is a mechanical construct designed by Nekron to be the perfect
killing machine.  His artificial life force has been programmed with only
thoughts of death and destruction.  Having the ability to think, but with
limited free will, Ratchet is jealous and hateful of the soft mortals that
surround him.  He is fortunate that his programming calls for the eventual
destruction of all mankind, for that is what he longs to achieve.  Although
completely loyal to Nekron and his schemes, Ratchet is secretly impatient and
longs for the day when he can execute his prime directive.  Ratchet has been
stationed within the Eye of the Bloodstorm, a place where no mortal can
withstand for long.
 
     On Nimbus, note the far left side of the platform...there is a line that
separates the small edge part from the rest of the platform.  This is the key.
On the winning round, you must defeat the opponent so that either you or your
opponent stays fully to the left of the line, in the edge part.  Then, you
enter a 'trash-talk' code.
 
The code is:  while holding joystick left, ( 4 FRONT LEG , BLOCK )
 
When you do the code, the clouds will turn red - You have been teleported to
the Eye of the Bloodstorm and will fight Ratchet soon.
 
Hint:   Do NOT enter a "Travel Code" after activating this teleportation,
        unless you like the idea of fighting Ratchet on the Character
        Selection Screen with a 10 second time limit instead of 90...
 
 
                                    =====
                                    BLOOD
                                    =====
 
 
Origination Screen :    Any
Agent Location :        n/a - Agent teleports to your current screen
Accessibility :         Easy (but variable, depending on skill w/perfect)
 
     Blood was created as a result of an experiment performed by Nekron
to create a living robot with all organic components.  The result is Blood, a
robot made completely from living tissues and organs grown and cultivated
within a laboratory.  Because of the strange nature of these living organisms,
an inordinate amount of blood is needed to keep the creature functioning
properly.  Blood has been programmed by Nekron to fight and kill and has no
mind of his own.  He is the only special agent who can withstand a direct
transportation jump from Nekron's lair to anywhere on Earth.
 
     Blood, like Shadow, can be found from any background.  The difference is
Shadow takes you to his world, and Blood is fought on the background you are
currently on.  To fight Blood, you need to have a perfect round, and then win
the match.  Note that if you get a Perfect in the first round, Blood will not
appear until the match (win 2 out of 3) is over.  If you do this, the dead
opponent explodes and Blood comes alive!  He is all red and has a blob of
oozing blood for a head.  He has Nekron's gauntlet, and therefore a very
extended reach.  He also shoots fireballs, like Hellhound.

THE BOSS:
 
                                 ===========
                                 N E K R O N
                                 ===========
 
Location:   Unistat
Height:     12'  0''
Weight:     Unknown
Gauntlet:   The Hand of Death
 
 
   Unknown to any of the Provincial population exists a hidden land, cloaked
by technology and protected by a dark elemental force.  NEKRON, the evil
entity who rules this hidden kingdom, is responsible for the death of the
Emperor and has forced the strife and tensions on the planet to the boiling
point.
 
   Centuries ago, during the Mega War of the 30th century, NEKRON was the
techno-scientist who created the Mega Bomb.  This device attempted to combine
technological weaponry with elemental forces, allowing its user complete
control over the planet.  As NEKRON was making his final adjustments to his
creation, an allied attack bombed his laboratory and set off the Mega Bomb
prematurely.  The power that was unleashed caused such destruction and
planetary upheaval that the human race was nearly destroyed.  NEKRON, who was
at the epicenter of the blast, was somehow transported to a pocket dimension
that kept him alive.  There the techno-elemental forces transformed him into a
bizarre and frightening creature of immense power.
 
   Trapped in this pocket dimension for centuries, NEKRON has plotted for the
day when he will escape his hidden lair and rule the entire planet.  NEKRON
has created ten mysterious agents that have helped him to orchestrate events
across the planet for centuries, causing tension and suspicion to build
between the various races.  He plans to let the world's leaders kill each
other off in the BloodStorm contest, knowing that their petty hatreds and
personal desires will keep them from looking for the truth about the High Lord
Emperor's mysterious death.  When the Provincial leaders at last destroy each
other, the winner will be spirited to NEKRON's hidden lair.  NEKRON will
defeat the final world leader and the provinces will be left helpless before
his power.  Then NEKRON can use the corpse of the dead champion as a gateway
that will allow NEKRON to re-enter the world and conquer the planet.

          | Appendix A - Trash Talk and Special Programmer's Codes |
          `--------------------------------------------------------'
 
YOU REALLY GEORGED THAT ROUND.
 
WAS YOUR JOYSTICK WORKING?  I COULDN'T TELL...
 
MOST PATHETIC.
 
SORRY BUDDY, THIS IS A REAL FIGHTING GAME.
 
NO STYLE  NO CLASS
 
GRONK YOU
 
EAT MY SHORTS
 
ROTFLMAO
 
MOST IMPRESSIVE ... NOT
 
     As if it weren't enough to have all this nonsense happen in the arcade
between the players themselves, now it is possible to have the game itself
spew messages like these to the now-defeated opponent.  However, this isn't
all that the feature does...hidden among all the possible messages are things
that actually DO something besides talk trash.  These special codes are
explained here.
 
     "But what is all this?  How do I make it an integral part of my game?"
 
     Well, if you have actually completed the game (in other words, gotten ALL
the goodies, defeated all the secret agents, got the end-credits, etc...),
then you have already done this in two places.  When you battled at Scorch HQ,
in order to get to Wraith, you had to enter UP UP UP BLOCK after the battle.
When you battled at Nimbus, the code was LEFT+(4x FRONTLEG , BLOCK).  These
are two very special parts of the set of Trash Talk codes...in that these only
work at these specific places.  The rest of the trash talk codes work any time.
(or at least, we haven't found any other site-specific codes...if we do, this
will be updated)
 
    For starters, let's get comfortable with four very simple codes:
        UP UP BLOCK
        LEFT LEFT BLOCK
        RIGHT RIGHT BLOCK
        DOWN DOWN BLOCK
 
     In simpler terms, two hits of a direction, followed by block.  The block
key is used as an ENTER key for all codes.
 
     This cannot be stressed enough...ALL CODES MUST END WITH BLOCK.
 
     Anyhow, the four example codes put up four different messages.  I won't
mention them here...you can quite easily see them for yourself in the complete
Trash Talk codes section...they are in the [2 elements] section...the easy
ones. :)  The reason I mentioned these easy codes is: If you ever make a
mistake, and a code does not result in something, IMMEDIATELY do one of these
codes.  If you make too many mistakes, you will be locked out of the Trash
Talk system and will have to wait until the end of the next battle.  If you
had one of the special codes that needed to be put in as the last code, it is
too late.  Entering an easy code 2 or 3 times resets the mistake sensor and
lets you work with things for a while longer.
 
     "Ok, so how about explaining the purpose of some of these Special Codes?"
 
 
Taxi Codes:
 
     Have you ever thought...'Damn...if I could just get to the Obsel Desert,
I could get to Dimentia...but I'm four screens away from there, I only have
two fighters left, and I STILL need to get Shadow!!  I'm screwed...'
 
     How would you like to, in effect, wave your hand at the end of a battle
and yell, "YO!  TAXI!!", and a taxi pulls up and takes you to Obsel Desert to
fight the next battle?
 
     Now you can...with a special set of codes which we'll call the Taxi Codes
just for reference.  Taxi Codes are all an easy-to-remember standard form, and
can take you to any of the 15 battle screens.  Note that you cannot use the
travel code for Triax in order to immediately battle Dimentia.  Rather, you
would combat the next fighter on your agenda there!  Imagine...fight Tremor in
the Shadows, or Mirage on the CatWalk...  But even more important, you can go
to the screens that contain the necessary elements to complete the game!
 
Example: You have 2 fighters left, and still need to defeat Wraith in order to
         have completed all eight secret agent battles... but Scorch HQ is 4
         screens away!  You'll never make it!!  Unless......YO!  TAXI!!   Enter
         the code for Scorch HQ, and you are on your way via the express lane!
         Now you have it made in the shade...
 
     You can even do this in 2 player games - when you defeat your opponent,
you can select your favorite screen to do battle in.  You can even play the
'Hometown Kid' style, and always pick your home screen. (Talon would always
pick Cyberia, Tempest would pick Nimbus, etc.)  Add a whole new dimension of
fun to competitions.
 
     "OK!  Sounds great!  Now what are the codes?"
 
     My, my....impatient, are we?  :-)  Fine, Here is the code format.
 
     The Taxi Codes have 4 parts to them:
        2 or 3 RIGHT
        UP or DOWN
        An Attack Button
        ...and BLOCK to enter it. (of course)
 
     So, a combination such as: RIGHT RIGHT DOWN BACKLEG BLOCK is a travel
code.  In fact, this is the travel code for Subterra, the access point for
Golem.
 
     All 15 Taxi Codes are on the next page.  The codes are in list form, as
well as a handy chart format.  Developing a good battle plan with your travel
sequence planned out is the key to an easier victory.
 
     Example: Tempest has devised her battle plan as follows: First, take care
of the three secret agent battles that do not require the defeat of a fighter.
These are Craniac, Dimentia, and Golem.  Also, achieving Blood via Golem is
not too hard, so try to work this sequence in as often as necessary.  Then,
take Wraith and Ratchet in no particular order.  Finally, get Shadow via the
Toxic Marsh.  Sin follows soon thereafter.  Take special note that Fallout
will make getting to Golem a pain due to an annoyance in the 2.1 programming,
and Mirage makes life in the Toxic Marsh far too annoying.  Deal with these
annoyances elsewhere on the planet if possible.
 
 
And now...the Taxi Codes!

Note: Scorch HQ is listed both as R R D FA and R R R D FA, because the only
      the last two R's are noted in this case.  There is no true location for
      R R R D FA, since there are only 15 destinations, and they had to turn
      one code off. (Ed.- I would have invented THE VOID - no background at
      all...that would have been interesting!  Or how about THE ARCADE...have
      a bunch of generic (or maybe even STRATA) videogames, with players all
      around, cheering wildly?  Maybe in BLOODSTORM II...)
 
By alphabetical order of screens, with useful activities for completion noted:
 
STANDARD SCREENS:
Black Armada    R R U BA  Path to Craniac
Cyberia         R R U BL  Uppercut opponent into fans, otherwise useless.
Nimbus          R R D BA  Path to Ratchet
Obsel Desert    R R U FA  Path to Dimentia, repeatable
Polaria         R R D FL  Throw opponent on spikes, otherwise useless.
Scorch HQ       R R D FA  Path to Wraith
Subterra        R R D BL  Path to Golem, repeatable
Toxic Marsh     R R U FL  Send opponent into marsh, easy path to Shadow.
 
SECRET SCREENS:

Golem's Lair    R R R U BL
Shadows         R R R D FL
Southern Abyss  R R R D BL
Triax           R R R D BA
 
The seven secret screens are marked (useless) because they are totally devoid
of activities.  What's more, many of the screens are of fixed width and
position.  Whether this is of any interest depends on your intentions.
However, they will not help you in any way to complete the game.
 
 
Morph Codes:
 
Another scenario:  You start a game, and....@*&^%#!!!  You chose the wrong
character!  You entered your password with all your powers (and if you have
defeated Nekron before, you have his gauntlet) but you are (for example) a
Tempest player, and you just accidentally selected Talon!  Aiiiieeeeeee!
 
But wait!  All is not lost.  You struggle through the first battle using
Talon, then immediately after the battle go backstage and confer with some
fantastic makeup artists and trainers.  PING!  You are now Tempest!!  Life is
wonderful again.
 
Sound crazy?  Well, that's debatable, and besides....is it any more crazy
than yelling for a taxi? :-)  It's here, and it can really save your a$$ets,
and the freaky part is: You can even morph to six of the special agents!!!
 
By now, you are surely familiar with the fact that every Special Agent is an
alteration of a regular fighter.  This plays a vital role in remembering how
to work with the codes.  Each Morph code consists of three parts:
 
        Either Left/Right, or Right/Left
        4 buttons in circular order
        ...and BLOCK to enter it (of course)
 
The circular order thing is very important.  Note the positions of the attack
buttons.  You must press each button in a circular pattern for each of the
codes.  Example: BA FA FL BL, FA BA BL FL.  Another very useful way to think
about this is by letters of the alphabet which the patterns resemble.  If you
trace a line from the following points: BL BA FA FL . . . you will note that
it looks like the lowercase 'n'.  I have called this the 'N' code in the list.
Reversing that list results in the same shape, just drawn in reverse.  I
called this 'revN'.  (Yes, I DID include the buttons for you too.... :-) )
 
Shape     Buttons                 L R                     R L
                            (Secret Agents)       (Regular Fighters)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
N         (BL BA FA FL)         Sin                     Mirage
revN      (FL FA BA BL)         Golem                   Tremor
U         (BA BL FL FA)         --------                Freon
revU      (FA FL BL BA)         Ratchet                 Razor
D         (BA FA FL BL)         Craniac                 Talon
revD      (BL FL FA BA)         Dimentia                Tempest
C         (FA BA BL FL)         --------                Hellhound
revC      (FL BL BA FA)         Wraith                  Fallout
 
Note that Blood (derivative of Hellhound) and Shadow (derivative of Freon) are
NOT available via this method, nor are Gargoyle/Chainsaw and Nekron.
 
Golem has become the local favorite to play....that horn-rush move has the
rolling ball beat hands down, being fully combo-able.
 
 
NEW: -STARTING- as a Secret Character WITHOUT using a Morph Code:
 
Yes, you can start the game with one of the REAL secret character entries
now!  However, these codes are PASSWORD codes...you can't do this with your
own code.  They are done like the Big Head Codes that are explained later.
 
 Dementia     h:UP + (<BL> <BL> <BL> <BA>+<BL>)
 Golem        h:UP + (<BA> <BA> <BA> <BA>+<BL>
 Wraith       h:UP + (<BL> <BL> <BL> <FA>)
 Sin          h:UP + (<FA> <FA> <FA> <FA>+<FL>)
 Craniac      h:UP + (<FL> <FL> <FL> <FA>+<FL>)
 Ratchet      h:UP + (<BA> <BA> <BA> <FL>)

 Blood        h:LEFT + (<FA> <BA> <BL> <FL>)     <-----  2.20 ROM ONLY
 Gargoyle     h:RIGHT + (<BA> <BL> <FL> <FA>)    <-----  2.20 ROM ONLY
 Nekron       2x(top2, left2, right2, bottom2)   <-----  2.20 ROM ONLY
 
I -know- that Nekron one is going to cause EVERYONE some problems!  Hit the
top two buttons at the same time, then the left two buttons, then the right
two, then the bottom two, and repeat that sequence again.  Each pair counts as
an element, and this is an 8 element code.  Got it?  I hope so.  (All these
are 8 element codes, really.  For an explanation on the elements concept, go
to the Trash Talk Compendium in the final section.)
 
Unfortunately, though, you can't be Shadow, even in the 2.20 ROM...but
Gargoyle? (aka Chainsaw)  This should be interesting!
 
 
Gauntlet Codes:
 
Have you ever, for some strange reason, felt that the gauntlet your beloved
people gave you, well, to put it in the most polite way possible....sucks??
 
Now there is a way you can do something about it.....borrow someone elses
gauntlet!  How?  With a Gauntlet Code, of course.  Simply walk backstage at
the end of a battle, deposit your gauntlet, and press the buttons of the
gauntlet you want.  PING!  A fresh new perspective on life!  Tempest with a
Mephitic Fist Slime Gun, Freon with a Cyber Claw Taser.....the possibilities
are endless!  And yes, if you are a secret character this works too!  Simply
do the Gauntlet Code after the Morph Code.  (If this is starting to look like
Design-A-Character to you, you are not alone. :-) )
 
All of the Fighter gauntlet codes start with FRONT ARM.  The Secret Gauntlets
of Nekron and his Agents are both  'do stuff while holding BACK LEG'  style.
 
Gauntlet codes, in alphabetical order by Owner name and by group:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fallout's Gauntlet:     <FA> DOWN LEFT RIGHT <FA> Block
Freon's Gauntlet:       <FA> <BA> <BA> <BA> Block
Hellhound's Gauntlet:   <FA> LEFT DOWN LEFT <BA> Block
Mirage's Gauntlet:      <FA> RIGHT RIGHT LEFT LEFT <FA> Block
Razor's Gauntlet:       <FA> RIGHT DOWN RIGHT <BL> Block
Talon's Gauntlet:       <FA> RIGHT DOWN RIGHT <FA> Block
Tempest's Gauntlet:     <FA> DOWN RIGHT LEFT <FL> Block
Tremor's Gauntlet:      <FA> (hold <BA>) DOWN DOWN (release <BA>) Block
 
Agent's Gauntlet:       (hold <BL>) DOWN DOWN <FL> (release <BL>) Block
Nekron's Gauntlet:      (hold <BL>) UP DOWN <BA> (release <BL>) Block
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
For information on the names of the Gauntlet Special Powers for each gauntlet,
consult the Information Sheet of the owner of the Gauntlet.
 
 
------------------------------
Instant Power...just add code!
------------------------------
 
     Have you ever walked up to a new machine and thought, "Damn...I have to
start ALL over again, and get all my powers....what a pain."
 
     How does getting all powers in one battle sound?
 
     That's right....ALL powers.  All 8 powers, and all 3 secret upgrades.
 
     Just remember this magic formula: U R D L D R U (Block)
 
     This code at the end of any battle gives you everything you need.  Then,
just enter the code for Nekron's Gauntlet, and you are ready to shred!!
 
 
VULGARITIES! (Hide the children!  Alert the censors!!! :) )
 
The following three (rather difficult to do in my opinion, but I did them, and
yes, they work on 2.10 ROMS) Trash Talk Codes, all result in the word
VULGARITY displayed on the screen.  However, listen closely...instead of the
>BONGGGG!!< sound you usually hear on a code, you hear the phrase listed
below:
 
Burn In Hell  [L+(<BA+BL> <FA+FL>) rel, R:(<FL>), rel]
You Suck      [U D L+(<FL>) rel R+(<FL>) rel]
Bitch         [Hold R, add BL, press BA twice, rel BL, rel R]
 
See?  I told you they were complex. :)  I'll go through them step by step...
 
Burn In Hell: Hold L, and press BA and BL together, then release the buttons
              (STILL HOLDING LEFT) then press FA and FL together.
              Then, hold R and press FL.  Release all, and press BLOCK.
 
You Suck:     U, D, hold L and press FL, release everything, hold R and press
              FL, release everything, BLOCK.
 
Bitch:        The most difficult of them all, I'll break this down completely:
              Hold R
              Add BL to the hold
              Press BA Twice
              Let go of BL
              Let go of R
              BLOCK
 
If you make sure you do the holds and then release them in proper order,
you'll get it.  Programmers may note it sort of looks like nested loops. 
Think of it that way, and you're sure to get it right.  I hope.  :)
 
==============================================================================
 
                   .--------------------------------------.
                   | Appendix B - General Area Strategies |
                   `--------------------------------------'
 
General Strategies on Screens:
 
     The special screens (where the secret agents are) are all totally useless
so we shall only concentrate on the standard eight areas.
 
                                 BLACK ARMADA
                           ( Taxi Code: R R U <BA> )
 
     The main feature of this stage is the big catwalk in the background.  It
can be used as a means of escape and repositionment.  To go to the catwalk,
the move is: BLOCK+two UP. (It is best to hold block and just keep hitting UP
until it works)  Once there, if you do nothing, you will immediately bounce
back.  However, if you hold DOWN, you will stay there for a couple seconds.
If you move LEFT or RIGHT, you will jump in that direction and immediately
jump to front in that new position.
 
     This screen is the access point for reaching Craniac.  To reach him, you
must go to the catwalk three times, holding DOWN each time in order to stay
there as long as possible.  You may move left or right back there as well, but
only after having held down to stay there for a while.  After returning from
the third trip, WAIT!  Craniac will appear on the catwalk 5 seconds later.
Then, go back to the catwalk immediately, holding DOWN again while you are
there.  You will then battle Craniac on the catwalk.  Remember, if you don't
succeed in defeating Craniac, return immediately to Black Armada via the Taxi
Code.  Since getting to Craniac does not result in the death of a fighter, you
can return as often as needed until you have defeated Craniac.  Once you have
defeated Craniac, however, the Black Armada screen is useless.  Go on to
bigger and better things...
 
                                    CYBERIA
                           ( Taxi Code: R R U <BL> )
 
     At first glance, this looks like a totally useless stage.  In fact, if
you look at the big picture, it is.  However, hidden in this stage is an
entertaining set of ceiling fans.  Uppercut a stunned opponent into the
ceiling fans for some serious carnage.  Unfortunately, as of version 2.1, this
no longer gives you full credit (head+arms).  It now only gives you credit for
the head.  Strata apparently thought it was giving the players easy stats.
They were right.  :-)  However, the bugs that they allowed to slip into 2.1
make for even more sickeningly effective stats-building opportunities...
 
                                    NIMBUS
                           ( Taxi Code: R R D <BA> )
 
     Nimbus has only one purpose: pathway to Eye of the Bloodstorm, where
Ratchet is.  To achieve this, you must make sure that on the winning round,
either you or your defeated opponent has fallen COMPLETELY to the left of the
line at the far left edge of the stage.  Then, enter the following secret
code:  While holding LEFT, press FL FL FL FL BLOCK.  Ignore any double clicks
on the buttons...this is normal, and was apparently added to confuse us.  The
clouds will turn red, and you will be transported to Eye of the Bloodstorm, to
face Ratchet.  If you fail to defeat Ratchet, return here via the Taxi Code,
but be warned: you killed a fighter to get to Ratchet.  Failing again may very
well ruin your chances of completing the game.  When you have defeated
Ratchet, this screen becomes useless.  Go on to bigger and better things.
Speaking of which...
 
                                 OBSEL DESERT
                           ( Taxi Code: R R U <FA> )
 
     This screen is very dull.  Or so it may seem.  All it looks like is an
endlessly long platform in both directions.  However, the writing is on the
wall...or in this case, the ground.  Take note of the circle that is cut into
five wedges.  If you are not carrying your gauntlet (HINT: get rid of it!!)
and do your pickup move so that you hit the circle, a portal appears, and you
take the portal to Triax, in order to fight Dimentia.  If you fail to defeat
Dimentia, you can return to Obsel Desert via the Taxi Code and activate the
portal again.  Even better, due to a bug in the programming, you can return
and redo this even after you have defeated Dimentia.  Take advantage of this
and your stats can be stratospheric (or is that STRATA-spheric? <rimshot>) in
no time.
 
                                    POLARIA
                           ( Taxi Code: R R D <FL> )
 
     Another useless screen with an entertaining diversion.  On each side of
the screen there is a demon head with horns sticking out.  You can stun your
opponent at the edge of the screen, get between your opponent and the end
wall, and throw your opponent backward into, and onto, the horns, complete with
screaming, twitching, and all that.  Sound like fun?  Maybe...except for the
fact that you get absolutely NO credit for this in the heads and arms stats.
Stay away from this stage if at all possible.  (If it sends you here in the
first screen, try for Blood or Shadow...)
 
                                   SCORCH HQ
                           ( Taxi Code: R R D <FA> )
 
     Another totally featureless screen, except that the path to Wraith starts
here.  Defeat your opponent any way you like, then enter the following secret
code: UP UP UP BLOCK.  You will battle Wraith in the lava pits of the Southern
Abyss soon.  If you fail to defeat Wraith, you can return here via the Taxi code,
but just as with Nimbus and Ratchet, this stage requires killing a fighter, and
having to return too often can ruin your chances for completion.  Once you have
defeated Wraith, this screen is totally useless.  Go on to bigger and better
things.
 
                                   SUBTERRA
                           ( Taxi Code: R R D <BL> )
 
     The first thing you will notice is that there is a nice long drop on the
sides with a nice large pointy stalagmite sticking up.  Fall over the edge and
you are a kabob.  Unless, of course, you activate the secret path to Golem.
To do this, note that there is also a stalactite hanging down from the
ceiling...  Hit it with a projectile twice, and it falls.  You can then jump
into the pit and you will land on the platform created by the knocked-down
stalactite, and go inside the passage to fight Golem.  If you fail to defeat
Golem, return to Subterra via the Taxi Code and try again.  Even better, like
Obsel, you can activate this secret again even after you have defeated Golem.
It is well known that Dimentia is easier to get stats from.  However, Tempest
can dart back and forth with well timed jumping front-leg kicks and get Golem
stunned without being damaged herself, then go in for the easy kill, thereby
qualifying for Blood if she hadn't already.  Since Golem is infinitely
accessible, it is just a matter of repeating the procedure until successful.
WARNING:  If Fallout is your opponent in Subterra, then things get REALLY
annoying.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to get a projectile past Fallout, unless he is
sundered with BOTH arms gone. (he has a 100% block with his front arm gauntlet
and we do not know why)  This is a known bug in the programming.
 
                                  TOXIC MARSH
                           ( Taxi Code: R R U <FL> )
 
     See platform.  See slime.  See fantastic opportunity.  Drop a mine onto
the gap line in the middle of a bridge segment, and it disintegrates.  Next
person there falls in and....ick.  This is an easy round to get Shadow on.  No
blocking necessary...just drop mines and wait for the stupid computer to fall
in.  WARNING: If Mirage is your opponent, you could have big problems.  Not
only does she have mines, she can teleport to the other side of you and send
you into the hole you OR she just made.  Be EXTREMELY careful.
 
==============================================================================
 
                     .----------------------------------.
                     | Appendix C - Big Head Characters |
                     `----------------------------------'
 
     Ok...unless you are totally clueless, you have seen how Strata has poked
fun at Midway's MORTAL KOMBAT games, and in many cases 'borrowed' ideas from
it.  Pit screen from MK1, form of death on Polaria spikes just like Baraka's
StabLift fatality, Portals, and of course, let's not forget the Trash Talk
message: WHO CARES WHERE GORO IS?
 
     Well, they've zapped Midway again, this time with an idea from NBA JAM:
 
                            Big Head Characters!!
 
     From information given by a programmer on the Bloodstorm team, there are
18 Big Head characters.  Each of the normal characters apparently have a
counterpart in the roster with a Big Head (in more ways than one?).  Some
characters have multiple entries (see chart).  You achieve a Big Head
character by inputting a special Character Select password after selecting a
character.  It does not matter which character you select because the Big Head
Character password you enter does a special override of the character you
selected.
 
     What I want to know, is that if this is true, why the hell are there
only 17 of the 18 Big Head characters listed in the master file?  Oh well. 
Here are the 17 that we know, and be warned: Some of them are VERY complex,
and show obviously why we never found them before!!  Just be thankful I
transcribed all this stuff into an easy-to-read format!!  The format I was
given was how the MACHINE thought of the moves...element by element.  Very
informative, but IMPOSSIBLE to just look at and understand.
 
All have been FULLY VERIFIED on 2.10 ROMS
 
The [E] column is how many elements are contained in the password.  This is
IMPORTANT, especially if it is less than 8!  Any code with less than 8
elements that involves a held combination requires you to HOLD that last
element combination until the character appears  This will be noted with an
asterisk (*) next to the number, as well in the special notes below.

Notes, in alphabetical character order:
 
BENJAMIN      Head of: Benjamin Ditton
              Fighter: TALON
              Not complex, but requires a HOLD and an ADD on the last element
              combination. 5 downs, Hold Block, add FA, and don't let go of
              these two buttons until BENJAMIN appears.
 
CHAINSAW      Head of: Scott Morrison
              Fighter: HELLHOUND
              This is a complex code that requires a HOLD on the last element
              combination.  The breakdown: While holding block, do BL BL U,
              but DON'T LET GO OF UP!  If you let go, it will put a 7th
              release element in...bad news.
 
CHAINSAW JR.  Head of: Scott Morrison
              Fighter: TALON
              Quite easy.  U D U D, BLK, U D.  No problem.
 
CHRIS         Head of: Christopher Ditton
              Fighter: TALON
              Not hard, but needs to be done right.  U, D, Hold block and hit
              BL then BA (individually, not together!), and release block.
 
DALE          Head of: Dale Kerkman
              Fighter: RAZOR
              Very very simple... :)
 
DR. POISON    Head of: Ralph Melgosa
              Fighter: FREON
              Simple one...think U, D, BLK, rev:U
              (see Morph Codes for explanation on rev patterns)  
 
ED7           Head of: Kyle Johnson
              Fighter: FALLOUT
              Fairly easy here... 6 blocks, 2 FA's.  No problem.
 
KELLEY        Head of: Kelley Marwede
              Fighter: MIRAGE
              4 downs, block, and then hold BA and FA until KELLEY appears.
              DO NOT let go of BA+FA, or it won't happen!
 
LEIF          Head of: Leif Pran Marwede
              Fighter: TREMOR
              A complex code, involving holds, adds, and a held element
              combination at the end.  Whew!  To break it down:
              BA, FA, BL, then press and hold BA, add FA, release them.
              Finally, press and hold BL+FL together until LEIF appears.
              DON'T let go of BL+FL, or you have blown it.
 
MR. MURDER    Head of: Alan Noon
              Fighter: TALON
              Hold block while doing the four lefts.  You will notice that
              when holding BLOCK, the joystick movements click TWICE - once
              when activated, and once when let go, as they are individual
              elements...but since the code ends on the 8th element with a
              left, you really don't need to think about this code at all.
              Just hold BLOCK, do a bunch of lefts, and it will change to
              MR. MURDER easily enough...
 
NAGEL         Head of: Bob Nagel
              Fighter: FALLOUT
              Not too hard, just note that the paired buttons must be hit at
              EXACTLY the same time and let go EXACTLY together.  Mess that
              up, no NAGEL for you.
 
ORION         Head of: Orion Derose
              Fighter: RAZOR
              A very complex one, involving additions to hold sequences.  To
              break it down: Press and release BA.  Press and hold BL, add BA,
              and release those two together.  Press and release FA.  Press
              and hold FL, add FA, and release those two together.  End it all
              with 2 blocks.
 
QUEEN BEE     Head of: Elaine Ditton
              Fighter: TEMPEST
              Easy.  3 up, BA, 3 up, FA.  No problem.
 
RADBO         Head of: Richard A. Ditton
              Fighter: TALON
              Utterly simple.  4 rights, BL, FL.  No problem at all.
 
SENLEIB       Head of: Senator Lieberman  (Hello, Senator... :) )
              Fighter: HELLHOUND
              7 lefts and a block.  Easy.  Just don't do 8 lefts...
 
SKULL         Head of: Luis Mangubat
              Fighter: FALLOUT
              Just do it. :)  Nothing hard here...
 
TURBO         Head of: Jeff Morrison
              Fighter: FALLOUT
              Again, just do it.  U D, R L R L, block.  Even easier.
 
 
NOTE:  If you don't like any of the derivatives of the characters we have on
       the list, you can always use a Morph Code (from Appendix A) and the Big
       Head will be automatically transferred to your new torso.  This only
       works in one player games, though.  In two player games the image
       system is reset upon character selection.
 
==============================================================================
 
            .--------------------------------------------.
            | Appendix D - COMPLETE Trash Talk Code List |
            `--------------------------------------------'
 
To truly understand the codes system of BLOODSTORM, the 'elements' concept
must first be examined.
 
Any time a joystick switch or button switch changes state (on or off), the
system scans to see what exactly is on at that time.  If there is anything
on, this is noted by the system as an element.  For example, pressing a
button signals a change, the system senses what is on, sees that it is that
one button, and puts that in its element list.
 
However, it is not always that simple.
 
Note some of the codes that you have done in the process of completing the
game, particularly the ones that have you hold something while you are doing
something else...these register more elements than you may think.  Take the
following example of a password I once used for saving my character:
 
Format: L+[<BA> <BA>] <FA> <FL> <FA>
 
Process: While holding left, press BA twice, release L, then FA, FL, FA.
 
You might think of this as a 6 element code: L BA BA FA FL FA... It is
actually a full 8 elements.  Here is the breakdown of how the system treats
the adds and releases of this password in its code handler:
 
METHOD                     ACTION         STATUS
While holding left...      ADD L          L         (1)
Press BA Twice...          ADD BA         L+BA      (2)
                           REL BA         L         (3)
                           ADD BA         L+BA      (4)
                           REL BA         L         (5)
Release left...            REL L          -----     ---
Press FA...                ADD FA         FA        (6)
                           REL FA         -----     ---
Press FL...                ADD FL         FL        (7)
                           REL FL         -----     ---
Press FA.                  ADD FA         FA        (8)
                           REL FA         -----     ---
 
Every change is noted, except for changes that result in no active switches.
This adds a greater need for being careful with codes, but also results in
extreme versatility in code construction.  A truly sick combination code that
involves multiple add-ons and releases of certain buttons at certain times
makes for impossible-to-guess codes, as you have no doubt seen with a few of
the Big Head codes.
 
Most of the Trash Talk codes are simple, but a few are this complex style.  I
have grouped the complex codes at the end, to bring their special nature to
the attention of the player.
 
Note: ALL Trash Talk Codes are completed with BLOCK at the end.

                                BL before pressing block, since it is not
                                necessary, and you might trigger a sixth

CREDITS
 
The original (informative, but fairly limited) list was supplied to me by a
Compuserve user who wishes to remain anonymous.  Then I, and five others on
the net got together and went crazy, gathering everything we could get our
hands on, the result being this monstrosity. :-)
 
This group of six sickos are: 
 
zio@netcom.com                  (That's me! :-) )
 
eric@parcplace.com              (an operator at the arcade...VERY helpful :) )
 
gregory@Garg.Campbell.CA.US     (One of my main associates at the arcade.
                                 Got me hooked on Tremor.)
 
PicketFent@aol.com              These three are responsible for more than half
dsulfrid@waco.tstc.edu          of the Programmer's Codes in this FAQ.  MEGA
ITECHNO@delphi.com (exists?)    thanks!  This would be nowhere near the utter
                                spammage it is without yaz!!  Not only that,
                                it was PicketFent that went the extra mile or
                                twelve and got Richard Ditton's attention. :)
 
donald18@ix.netcom.com          Submitted info on the Ratchet access bug
                                (works exactly like the Wraith access bug).
 
...and an uncountable number of other players at Galaktican, most of whose
names I can't recall (and don't have any EMail addresses) for finding the
occasional code here, a combo there, and for putting up with what has turned
out to be, as one player put it, "...the damn game with more secrets than
Watergate!"
 
And of course, a MAJOR thank you to STRATA and Incredible Technologies for
producing this game, to Galaktican Arcade in San Jose, CA for having one, and
to Andy Eddy (vidgames@netcom.com) of GamePro Magazine for giving this, and
many other FAQs, a home.
 
AND LAST, BUT CERTAINLY NOT IN ANY WAY LEAST...
 
An unbelievably big **THANK YOU** on behalf of all the BLOODSTORM players in
the world goes to Richard A. Ditton, who sent me the ENTIRE master list of
passcodes with which I was able to make this FAQ -finally- complete, with only
3 days to spare!  (Galaktican pulled it. :(  I won't even mention the pile that
they put in it's place...)
 
Enjoy the info!!  Barring any mailbox jarring reports or error notifications,
this is, indeed, the final revision of this BLOODSTORM FAQ.  Thanks to
everyone for making this an enjoyable, though maddening at times, project, and
let's keep a lookout for BLOODSTORM II - NEKRON STRIKES BACK!  I can't wait!!
 
And PLEASE...if anyone has trouble deciphering any of the really weird stuff,
email me at the address below, and I'll try to mail you as detailed an
explanation as I can of whatever code or procedure is perplexing you.  This
may be my last revision, but it isn't the last anyone will hear from me, and
I'll always support my products.  How many software manufacturers can say
that, eh? :) :)
