                                =======

  Machine requirements:  IBM compatibles/XT-AT Class (384K required)


INTRODUCTION
============
With the popularity of the consoles for various game machines, it has 
become increasingly difficult to determine which cartridge images came 
from which machine.  There are two good utilities presently available 
to identify the images, but both are command line driven (you have to 
type each of the image file names after the program name to see what 
they are).

If you store most/all of your images on your hard drive (and quite 
possibly in separate directories) and send them to your console, it is 
very easy to spend a great deal of time trying to identifying each 
image.  CART_ID allows you to identify several files during one 
session.

*NOTE: This version of CART_ID only supports the Super Magicom and the 
Game Doctor family of cartridge images.


GETTING STARTED
===============
To use CART_ID, simply type CART_ID at the DOS prompt and you will be 
presented with a list of all the files that are present in that 
directory.  CART_ID will automatically detect whether a color or a 
monochrome video card is present in your machine and it will 
automatically switch into the appropriate mode.


DIRECTORY SORT
==============
If you wish to change the way in which the files are displayed, you can 
press the "S" key and you will be allowed to choose how you wish to 
have the files in the file directory displayed. You can sort the files 
by file name, file extension, modification date or file size.


IMAGE CONVERSION
================
With the number of consoles available, there are no standards as how 
the image needs to be stored on diskette.  CART_ID can to convert 
images from one format to the other.  If you have an image that you 
wish to convert, simply highlight the file name and press the "C" key.  
CART_ID will determine the existing format and will automatically 
choose the alternate format to convert the file to.

The converted file will be given the same name as the original file but 
the extension will be changed to reflect the difference. (e.g. You want 
to convert an image called BIG_GAME.SMC from the Super Magicom to the 
Multi Game Doctor format; after the file has been converted, your Multi 
Game Doctor file will have the name of BIG_GAME.MGD).


IDENTIFY
========
To identify a file, simply highlight the file name and press the ENTER 
key.  You will be shown the information particular to that file.


COMMAND SUMMARY
===============
The following is a quick list of commands that can be used:


Keys            Action
====            ======================================================
 S              Sort the file directory by name, size, extension or 
                time in either ascending or descending order.
ENTER           Display information about the highlighted file.
 C              Automatically convert an image from one console format 
                (Super Magicom, Multi Game Doctor or binary are 
                presently the only supported formats) to another.
ESC             Quit CART_ID and return to DOS.


QUESTIONS
=========
Questions/comments/complaints/bugs/etcetera - Contact Guido Sarducci 
via any of the fine boards listed at the end of this documentation.

If anyone knows how to get ahold of R. Bubba Magillicutty, please have 
him contact me (via Spatula City or the Skull Factory) or leave me a 
message (again via Spatula City or Skull Factory) where I can contact 
him.  I have a few questions I *NEED* to ask him about images/sending 
files via the parallel port.


HISTORY
=======
Version 1.00 - (09-11-92) Initial version.
               This version was never released. In-house use only.

Version 1.01 - (09-13-92) Fixed a couple of typos  - nothing critical.
               Initial release.

Version 1.02 - (09-14-92) Cosmetic changes made. Fixed a bug in the
               monochrome mode that would turn the image info screen
               colors on computers using certain BIOS types.

Version 2.01 - (09-15-92) Major modifications made to throughout the 
   thru 2.04   entire program.  More stable identification of images, 
               MAJOR speed increases due to tighter code. These 
               versions were never publicly released.

Version 2.05 - (09-17-92) Added ability to convert files from one file 
               format to another (Super Magicom, Multi Game Doctor and
