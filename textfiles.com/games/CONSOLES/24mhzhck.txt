                  +----------------------------------------------+

    Last month we told you about the 24MHz Lynx. I didn't have enough time to
   translate  the manual  for it.  As it was  written in German,  and neither
   English or German being my native language, it took some time. But here it
   is.

   (KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS DESCRIPTION IS FOR THE LYNX I ONLY ! WE HAVEN'T
   TESTED IT ON THE LYNX II YET (HAVEN'T OPENED IT UP YET).
   NEITHER  PORTABLE ADDICTION OR THE  INTERNATIONAL LYNX CLUB IS AT FAULT IF
   WHEN YOU BRAKE SOMETHING WHILE DOING THIS)

    1) Take cartridge and batteries out of your Lynx.
    2) Take out the 4 skrews on the underside of your Lynx.  
    3) Lay down your  Lynx with the screen  down and remove the  back of your
       Lynx. 
    4) You will now  see the cartridge holder.  Underneath it you  will see a
       metal plate. It covers the RAM's, Mickey, Suzy and the quartz.
       The metal  plate is soldered.  Use soldering iron to remove it.  While 
       doing this  you will automatically  remove the metal protection on the
       other side of your Lynx.
    5) Turn your Lynx around and take off the top half  (NOW, DON'T TOUCH THE
       SCREEN !!!).
    6) The 16MHz quartz is directly under the cartridge holder.  Take it out.
    7) Now take the 16MHz and 24MHz crystal and connect them in this way: 

   Connection with mass         
      .  Quartz 1          ....:----------------> }  Connect these with the  
      .   |----|          |.|...|  Switch         }  points where you took
      .   |    |           |   |                  }  the 16MHz quartz off.
      ....|----|           |   |                  }
      .    |  |            |   |                  } 
      .    |  :------------:   |                  }
      .    :-------------------;--------------->  }
      .    |  :----------------
      .    |  |      
      ....|----|        
          |    |
          |----|
         Quartz 2
        
    8) You need to make a mass, else the quartz will be disturbed by the rest
       of the Lynx electronics.
    9) You can now fit the quartzes with  double sided tape somewhere in your
       Lynx. We suggest you stick them on the back of the battery compartment.
   10) To use the switch, you have to punch a little hole in your Lynx. 
       Why  to use  a  switch was  explained by  Stephen Landrum in  Portable 
       Addiction # 09.
