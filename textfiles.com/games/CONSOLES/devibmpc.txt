                    Assembly language development systems.
                     For Famicom, Super Famicom, GameBoy.

The new Developers ToolBox series of assembly language development systems is
designed to give the professional programmer all the tools necessary to create
the demanding applications required by todays software consumers. Each system
contains a full screen, multiple file editor, a high speed assembler, a fully
costomizable source level debugger, and all the upload and download utilities.

The ToolBox systems are written in highly optimized 8086 assembly language for
speed and are designed to be run from an IBM PC, AT or PS/2 compatible host
machine. Communication with the target machine is via a high speed link using
the hardware and software included with each ToolBox. All ToolBox software and
program source files are stored and manipulated on the host machine, leaving
the target completely free for program testing.

All program source files are standard MS DOS text files and can be edited with
any standard text editor, allowing programmers to use their choice of editor.
No previous knowledge of MS DOS is required to use the ToolBox systems.



THE ASSEMBLER
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

All ToolBox systems are supplied with a powerful, high-speed, single pass
assembler capable of assembling all standard and most non-standard syntax
for the target systems are rates of up to 500,000 lines of real-life code
per minute on a 33MHz machine. Each assembler can support all the different
processors in any target system, giving much smoother operation when assembling
codes for multi-processor targets.

      -   Simple to use multi-processor support built into one assembler
          program, accessed by a single assembler directive (.proc {cpu})
      -   Standard and non-standard syntax are supported to ensure comp-
          atibility with practically all other assemblers.
      -   Full 32 bit expression evaluation as standard.
      -   Extensive macro capabilities.
      -   Full conditional assembly control.
      -   Infinitely nested directives (i.e., DO...LOOP, IF...ENDIF, etc.)
      -   Local labels
      -   Full utilization of LIM EMS memory if present.
      -   Extensive listing controls.
      -   80386 version of assembler for greater assembly speeds.


THE DEBUGGER
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The debuggers supplied with all ToolBox systems are highly sophisticated
program testing and analysis tools. Each is written in a special high-livel
language (MDPL) and can be configured to any extend (even totally re-written
if necessary) to suit the user.

      -   Fully overlapping windows under mouse control.
      -   Symbolic and source level debugging.
      -   Conditional break points.
      -   Reapeat a set of commands.
      -   Full expression evaluator can use assembly time symbols.
      -   Disassembly to either screen, printer or disk, Disk files can
          be re-assembled. 
      -   Full program trace facility allows single-stepping, quick-tracing,
          follow memory pointers, and show stack.
      -   All usual monitor/debugger commands to examine and modify memory,
          manipullate blocks, etc.

And now, using the new ROM emulation technology, these further features
become available:

      -   Hardware breakpoints, can be set anywhere within the ROM space,
          where you can break on an address or any bit address combination
          with don't care bits.
      -   Hardware break point on data access, with don't care bits.
      -   Re-vector addresses, i.e. force re routing of NMI, IRQ's etc.
      -   Halt program execution using above method, no extra wiring!
      -   Auto reset the system after a download.
      -   Emulate up to 16MBit of ROM space.
      -   Debug memory completely invisible, and will not take any part of
          the program address space.


THE EDITOR
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The editor supplied with ToolBox systems is now stand-alone, but can be
integrated to a large extend with the assembler and debugger.

      -   Full overlapping windows controlled by either the mouse or keyboard.
      -   Can use project folders specifying up to 128 files to be edited,
          each in a seperate window.
      -   Error tracking across multiple source code files.
      -   Ultra-fast keyboard response and screen updating can keep up with
          even the fastest keyboard repeat rates.
      -   Instantaneous block operations such as copy, move, delete, change of
          case, and read from or write to from disk.
      -   Unique key recorder and playback system can remember a sequence of
          keystrokes and replay them at the press of a key.
      -   Totally flexible string search and replace facility. The search
          engine can compile a list of successful matches showing the lines
          containing the search string. The list can then be browsed through 
          and the required occurrence selected to be viewed in it's file.
      -   Special label search allows for all occurrences of the label under
          the cursor to be search for.
      -   Auto Caps Lock facility automatically sets uppercase for instructions
          and lowercase for comments and text strings.
      -   Auto indent ensures the current line is indended to the same position
          as the previos line.



                              SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
                            ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

All ToolBox systems are designed to run on IBM PC, AT or PS/2 compatible
machines running MS DOS 3.0 or later.

The minimum system resources required are 512k of RAM, a hard disk drive,
a monitor and at least 1 free 8-bit expansion slot. In addition, 1 free printer
port is required if you are planing to use the RAMBOY.

Any additional system resources will be utilized, such as more memory (either
Conventional or Expanded), a colour monitor and a mouse.


                                DISCOUNT SYSTEM
                              ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

For multiple purchases of ToolBox development system a discount system is
available. For the second and third systems bought there is a discount 
of œ1000. For a fourth system bought there is a discount of œ1500.
(Note, for the GameBoy system this is œ500 and œ800 respectively)


                              ADDITIONAL HARDWARE
                            ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

      -   The Video Boy hardware is available as a separate product. This
          package provides the Video Boy interface with a modified GameBoy
          and all interconnecting leads. The GameBoy cartridge slot is free
          and hence any game/development cartridge can be plugged in.
      -   œ550.

It's a flexible, but integrated development system. It can be combined to give
the integration of the classic PDS systems, or split so that it can be used
with your own familiar tool.... what more could you need?
