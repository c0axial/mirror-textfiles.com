COPIERS INFORMATION                                 00:58  SATURDAY  28-DEC-91
===================                                 UPDATED   SUNDAY 08-MAR-92

                  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
                   > Q U E S T I O N S  &  A N S W E R S >
                  ///////////////////////////////////////

A  lot  of  people have been asking me lots of questions on ordering the above
copiers...

First  off, the units are LEGAL to buy!  I'm not sure what the situation is on
you USING them..

The  prices  given  are  what  they cost YOU!  I can't offer huge discounts to
anyone  for "special reasons" as, with import duty (Customs take my profit) my
margins  are cut by 28-30% (depending on the NT$-US$ rate).  If you think that
is  bulls**t,  call CUSTOMS & EXCISE and ask them yourselves how much they add
on COMPUTER HARDWARE!  - Exactly!

(SPECIAL  PROTECT TRACK PARAGRAPH REMOVED, YOU NO LONGER REQUIRE SPECIAL DISKS
PURCHASED FROM US, YOU CAN USE **ANY** DISK)

There  are  10 HIGH DENSITY disks enclosed.  You can buy more disks from us at
competitive  rates,  and  they  come in proper plastic cases, in 10's and with
labels.

You  can  also  of  course use LOW density disks.  However, one 8 megabit game
would  normally  fit  on a HD disk, and then allow a 4 megabit game too!  With
2DD  you  get  JUST  ONE  8  megabit game on TWO disks!!

BOARD ALREADY GOING
===================

     ULTIMATE  The first board to start the console scene off! Supporting the
        DREAM  Super Magic Drive, Super Magicom & Magic Super Griffin. It is
               also the main board to order the hardware, offering payment
               by credit card, cheque or bank transfer. Orders can be posted
               or FAXed. Full details on +44 (0)222 495919. (ALPHA FLIGHT)

     TREASURE  This board has been down for some months. The sysop,
       ISLAND  Executioner is now using Ultimate Dream (see above) to take
       * UP *  orders for the copiers. It should hopefully be up again at the
       *SOON*  end of the month and will probably be dominated by console
               software (with Amiga files). +44 (0)992 451191 (INDEPENDANT)

        GHOST  Running currently for I.C.S. This board offers files for the

GETTING STARTED ON THE CONSOLE SCENE  --  Written by Executioner/Mr Scarface
====================================

Well I hope this file is useful to all those of you out there that want to get
started on the console scene.

To  get started you will need a copying device.  There are a few available but
the ones we supply are:

Sega Megadrive/Genesis - SUPER MAGIC DRIVE (supplied with drive & 10 disks)

Nintendo Super Famicom/SNES - SUPER MAGICOM (supplied with drive & 10 disks)

PC-Engine/Super Grafx - MAGIC SUPER GRIFFIN (supplied with drive & 10 disks)

         To order these call TREASURE ISLAND BBS on +44 (0)992 451191
      Check all the details in the first place, if you haven't already!


KILLING THE RUMOURS
===================

There  have been people going around saying that the Super Magic Drive is crap
because  it does not offer compatibility with other copiers.  Infact no copier
is compatible with any other copier..  there is no reason to be.

However  any  copier  that  saves the game out as an image file is most likely
able  to  have  a coversion program coded to make the file a Magic Drive, Game
Doctor  or  Super Mega Twin etc..  compatible file.  (This is being looked at)
(NB:  THE SUPER MEGA TWIN IS NOW DISCONTINUED, THE MAKERS WENT BUST!)

##############################################################################
** NEWSFLASH ** THERE IS NOW A CONVERTER FILE FOR GAME DOCTOR--MAGIC DRIVE! **
** SOON TO BE UPGRADED FOR MAGICOM AND PC-ENGINE FILES. ALSO CONV TO BINARY **
**                      AVAILABLE ON AMIGA & IBM FORMATS                    **
##############################################################################

Rumours  have been stating that the Magic Drive is not upgradeable..  Erm, not
correct.   DOS  3.1 (and soon 3.2) is supplied on ROM, but you can boot in any
ROM  via disk.  The latest DOS allows you to format 1.6meg disks, which allows
1  8mbit game & 1 4mbit game..  or 6 2mbit games on ONE DISK!  No other copier
allows  this!  Some only allow 1 game per disk, regardless of size!  LAME!  On
the Famicom copier (and others soon..  probably by the time you read this) you
even have a built in disk copy function, that copies ANY format disk!

You  can expand the RAM to 16mbit, which is more than enough to cater for some
new  generation  12mbit  games.   No 16mbit games exist, and probably wont for
some  time  to  come.  **FAMICOM** Street Fighter II is the first game 16Mbit,
and our copier will do it!
(GAME DOCTOR CURRENTLY DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO COPY ANY GAME OVER 8MBIT)

The main reason these rumours were started is because some boards only support
their  copier (quite understandibly), and so want everyone to buy THAT device.
After  all,  if  everybody  purchases the Super Magic Drive (and Magicom/Magic
Super  Griffin)  then  they  will  lose out.  However it is not fair to spread
false  stories  which will confuse people a great deal when the scene is being
born.   **UPDATE**  now  with conversion programs becoming available hopefully
things will be better now.

We  will  not  be  spreading  false  stories about the other copiers, but only
stating  the  facts  about our own.  We let YOU decide what to purchase.  Just
remember  though, before you purchase a copier, that what you buy will be what
you will then have to use - think of it as a new computer..  you don't want it
becoming obselete.

Finally,  it  is interesting to note that when we offered the MEGACONV utility
to  the  distributors  in Taiwan, they said "What for, the Game Doctor is shit
and  doesn't  sell in our country and Hong Kong.." - They were quite surprised
when we said it is selling in the US!!


GETTING DOCUMENTATION
=====================

Mr  Scarface  of  Crystal  has  offered  to  start  typing  documents of Super
Famicom/SNES  titles  in  the  near  future.  So keep a look out on the boards
listed above.  Mr Scarface has also begun giving cheats for games on the Super
Famicom/SNES as well as information of the latest releases.

We  are  also  looking for people to type documents on other consoles.  And if
anyone can translate Japanese then that is even cooler!

We  will  be  distribute your documents with our files as we release them, and
full credit will be given accordingly.  Contact Executioner on Treasure Island
+44 (0)992 451191 or Ultimate Dream +44 (0)222 495919.

CONFUSION OVER CONTACTING EXECUTIONER?
--------------------------------------

Some people have asked how to easily contact me..  well I am sysop of Treasure
Island  BBS +44 (0)992 451191..  but as that has been down for some time, I am
also  using  Ultimate  Dream  +44 (0)222 495919 where I am co-sysop.  Ultimate
Dream  has a cool console section and I am pleased to be asked to help run the
console  side  of  that  board.   So  if you ever need to contact me, Treasure
Island is the main board..  but Ultimate Dream is just as good to get me!

Hopefully everything is now 100% clear! Catch you later dudes!

                                                            CONSOLE.MAR/080392


                                 THE LAST BIT
                                 ************

                    THE CONFUSION OVER TRANSFERRING GAMES

To use the 8mbit games (or bigger) - you will need access to a computer with a
HIGH DENSITY disk drive, eg.  a PC.

You  can  of  course download 99% of the games to the Amiga, and transfer with
Cross-Dos  (Supplied as standard with Workbench 2.1) to the PC for unarcing to
disk.   However,  some games are over the 720k allowed on a PC disk..  you can
either  download  straight to the PC, or connect your Amiga to a PC via serial
link.

However,  at  time of writing this it was discovered that CrossDos 5.0 will be
supporting  the  new  High  Density  disk  drives now being installed with all
A3000/A3000T  systems  in  the  USA.  These drives SHOULD soon be available to
replace  the  drives  in the Amiga.  It will also include a new package called
CrossPC,  which  is  a software based IBM emulator, that claims to support the
Serial  and  Parallel  ports  -  this  therefore  MAY allow you to control the
console through the Amiga.  Release date is unknown, but hopefully it will hit
the boards very soon from the release of this text file.

Alternatively  to  all  of  the  above  methods - you could use a IBM emulator
(Commodore  Bridgeboard  etc.)  and connect the console straight to the Amiga.
However  you  can  only  use  an  emulator/bridge  that allows FULL use of the
Parallel, and not emulation through the Amiga.


                                FINAL WARNING
                                -------------

Certain  versions  of  ZIP  on  the  IBM and ZIP on the AMIGA do not like each
others compressions

To be safe - use LZH or LHA compression!

Otherwise  we will start to see corrupt console files on the boards - and this
is not wanted!
