
The AtariLink Directory - Last updated 27 Feb 1995 

This file is not maintained by, overseen by, endorsed, or otherwise
associated with Atari Corp. or any of its subsidiaries.  It's a
listing of Atari users maintained by myself only. I also didn't
even write this warning or the Jag logo, they're from R. Jung's
Jaguar FAQ.  =)

The list just got a big shot in the arm after I added Lloyd Evans'
"phone list" of Jaguar owners.  It turns out we were keeping similar
lists without knowing about each other.

Anyhow hopefully the increased number of entries will help
some of you to get a deathmatch JagDoom game going, as that's the
only networkable Jag game so far.  =)

BTW, the names comprising the "box" are simply titles that I'm 
pretty sure are going to use the network and/or modem, but I
could be wrong, you know.

"What is the AtariLink Directory?"

One of the greatest features of Atari's line of products is their
link-ability.  The Lynx allows up to 8 players to compete
against each other simultaneously.  The Jaguar has the ability
for players to compete via networked game or over the modem.
The AtariLink Directory is a way for anyone with e-mail access 
to hook up and play.  For networked games all you need to do is 
look for someone on the list who lives in an area near you (or an
area you'll be visiting) and drop them an e-mail message to set up
a time and place to get together and Link up!  Modem games are even
easier as they're only a phone call away.  You don't have to
give out any personal information, just your e-mail address and
what area you live in.  Mail you get about Linking up can be
handled in any way you want, including ignoring it if you're 
in a bad mood.  =)

TO ADD OR UPDATE YOUR ENTRY:

Just send e-mail to btribble@ocf.berkeley.edu and include your
e-mail address, name, and area that you live in.  If you want
to include some line of text I can include it under your entry.
Users of outside services that can access Internet mail such
as CompuServe, America Online, GEnie, etc. are welcome to join.  
For friends who want to join but don't have an e-mail address, 
include your e-mail address for referrals.

The latest version of the directory can be viewed by fingering
"btribble.link@ocf.berkeley.edu".  A copy of a recent version
of the list is also at Andy Eddy's (vidgames@netcom.com - an
extremely nice guy, BTW) FTP site at ftp.netcom.com in
pub/vi/vidgames/faqs.  If you are looking for a FAQ chances are
it's there.  Also, here's the plug for his magazine - read
Gamepro!  =)


MISC:
Some things I'm wondering about are:
Does one need the Atari voice modem to play modem games, or can you 
use a regular computer modem as a substitute?  I have a USR 14.4
Sportster external, so that's mainly why I'm asking here... =)

Can one play modem games over the Internet, allowing savings of
long-distance phone bills?
The main problem with this is that the Jaguar has no terminal
program (so far =) and I don't know what connecting through a 
PC, unscrewing your cable, and attaching it to your Jag would
do.  There's a lot of if's here, and actually I doubt this would
work, but it's neat idea...

This paraphrased from the Doom FAQ -

How can I play DOOM (a modem game =) over the Internet?
=============================================
Enter IHHD -- the Internet Head to Head Daemon designed by 
Jim Knutson.  Your host needs to be running UNIX as its operating
system.  The IHHD software is available via anonymous FTP at 
"cactus.org" in the "pub/IHHD/src" directory as the file
"dialer1.6.4.shar".  After you've successfully retrieved the 
"dialer1.6.4.shar" file from the FTP site, you need to prepare the 
IHHD to run on your UNIX system.

(1) mkdir IHHD
(2) mv dialer1.6.4.shar IHHD
(3) cd IHHD
(4) sh dialer1.6.4.shar
(5) make

You should now see a whole mess of files in the IHHD directory, most
importantly "dialer", "tcpdialer", "tcpanswer", "call", and
"showlog". If there's an error, try the above steps again,
re-retrieve the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file from "rex.pfc.mit.edu" using
the instructions above, or call for help.

To get connected using IHHD, set up a time to play with another
Internet modem player, ideally using E-mail to make the prior
arrangements. Make sure you and your opponent use the same baud rate
and line settings for your modems.  Make sure data compression, error
correction, and hardware flow control on your modem are off. (Just
for DOOM?) Start your favorite terminal program, call up your
Internet host and login normally. Contact the other player by sending
a short E-mail message indicating that you are on the net and ready
to play, and return to your UNIX prompt. Type "cd IHHD".  You may
have to type "terminal download," if you do not have it	activated
already.

Type "dialer opponent's.host" to start the IHHD connection. Another
way to connect is to type "tcpdialer opponent's.host" while your
opponent types "tcpdialer -answer".  Regardless of which method
you use to connect, type short text messages followed by a carriage
return until you see your opponent acknowledge you. Unless you have
"local echo" set to ON in your serial settings, you will not see the
text you type.  Exit by hitting CTRL-C if something goes wrong.
If your connection looks fine, exit your terminal program and
change to your DOOM directory and start a game with the "modem
already connected" setting. You can now proceed to play DOOM as if
you were connected via a regular phone line.

Unfortunately, sporadic delays and warping may occur with your IHHD
connection, depending on the quality of the connection and on what's
going on on the Internet at that particular times.  Then again, you
might just have a cruddy Internet connection.

To gauge the quality of the connection, type "ping -s
opponent's.host" at the UNIX prompt. You should get a listing of
"ping times", which you may stop at any time by pressing "CTRL-C".
Try pinging some other hosts you know to get an idea of how much ping
times vary, and use this data to guesstimate the quality of your
connection.

Another way to judge the quality of your connection is to simply look
at the other player.  If he's jumping all over the place, you've got
a cruddy connection.  If he's relatively smooth and steady, you've
got a good connection.

The End!
