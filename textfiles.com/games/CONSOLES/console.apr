COPIERS INFORMATION                                 03:06  TUESDAY   07-APR-92

                   > Q U E S T I O N S  &  A N S W E R S >
                  ///////////////////////////////////////

A  lot  of  people have been asking me lots of questions on ordering the above
copiers...

First  off, the units are LEGAL to buy!  I'm not sure what the situation is on
you USING them..

The prices given are what they cost YOU!  No hidden charges!

You  can  use  ANY disk!  Older versions of our copiers needed special tracks,
this is now NOT the case!

There  are  10 HIGH DENSITY disks enclosed.  You can buy more disks from us at
competitive  rates,  and  they  come in proper plastic cases, in 10's and with
labels.

You  can  also  of  course use LOW density disks.  However, one 8 megabit game
would  normally  fit  on a HD disk, and then allow a 4 megabit game too!  With
2DD you get only get 6 megabits on the disk total!

                                   DELIVERY
                                   ========

Everyone  has their order added onto a waiting list!  As we are now shipping a
large  amount  of  units, it is meaning there are backlogs of orders.  However
this  means  everyone  waits  the  same amount of time.  We take deliveries at
least  once  a month.  Adding 10% ensures courier delivery to lessen the total
waiting time.

NB:   Overseas  orders will normally be shipped courier delivery for insurance
purposes.

Therefore  if  you order now, you will get your copier a lot quicker - waiting
until  we take our delivery is not advisable as we will most likely already be
oversold by that stage.

If  you do not have sufficient funds at the time, we are willing to buy a unit
for  you  by  taking  a  50% deposit, the rest to be paid before shipping.  We
cannot ship the goods COD (Cash On Delivery) as the value and insurance is too
high  and the Post Office will not allow their personnel to collect such large
sums of money.

GETTING STARTED ON THE CONSOLE SCENE  --  Written by Executioner/Mr Scarface
====================================

Well I hope this file is useful to all those of you out there that want to get
started on the console scene.

To  get started you will need a copying device.  There are a few available but
the ones we supply are:

Sega Megadrive/Genesis - SUPER MAGIC DRIVE (supplied with drive & 10 disks)

Nintendo Super Famicom/SNES - SUPER MAGICOM (supplied with drive & 10 disks)

PC-Engine/Super Grafx - MAGIC SUPER GRIFFIN (supplied with drive & 10 disks)

         To order these call TREASURE ISLAND BBS on +44 (0)992 451191
      Check all the details in the first place, if you haven't already!


KILLING THE RUMOURS
===================

There  have  been people going around saying that our copiers are crap because
it  does  not  offer  compatibility  with  other copiers.  Infact no copier is
compatible with any other copier..  there is no reason to be.

However  any  copier  that  saves the game out as an image file is most likely
able  to  have  a coversion program coded to make the file a Magic Drive, Game
Doctor  or  Super Mega Twin etc..  compatible file.  (This is being looked at)
(NB:  THE SUPER MEGA TWIN IS NOW DISCONTINUED, THE MAKERS WENT BUST!)

**  There  are  now  conversion utilities for Game Doctor files to Super Magic
Drive/Super Magicom & vice versa.  **

Rumours  have been stating that the Magic Drive is not upgradeable..  Erm, not
correct.   DOS 3.1g (and soon 3.2) is supplied on ROM, but you can boot in any
ROM  via disk.  The latest DOS allows you to format 1.6meg disks, which allows
1  8mbit game & 1 4mbit game..  or 6 2mbit games on ONE DISK!  No other copier
allows  this!  Some only allow 1 game per disk, regardless of size!  LAME!  On
the Famicom copier (and others soon..  probably by the time you read this) you
even have a built in disk copy function, that copies ANY format disk!

You  can expand the RAM to 16mbit, which is more than enough to cater for some
new  generation  12mbit  games.   No 16mbit games exist, and probably wont for
some  time  to  come.  **FAMICOM** Street Fighter II is the first game 16Mbit,
and our copier will do it!
(GAME DOCTOR CURRENTLY DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO COPY ANY GAME OVER 8MBIT)

We  also release all the new DOS files on all boards that support our copiers,
plus  we  offer  24  hour  support by VOICE, FAX or BBS!  We will also soon be
offering  our  new  Voice  mail  system,  so you can dial in and get the exact
information just by using your Touch Tone phone!

The main reason these rumours were started is because some boards only support
their  copier (quite understandibly), and so want everyone to buy THAT device.
After  all,  if  everybody  purchases the Super Magic Drive (and Magicom/Magic
Super  Griffin)  then  they  will  lose out.  However it is not fair to spread
false  stories  which will confuse people a great deal when the scene is being
born.   **UPDATE**  now  with conversion programs becoming available hopefully
things will be better now.

**APRIL  UPDATE**  Yes,  now  the conversion utils are available, everyone can
convert  successfully  ALL  Game  Doctor  files to Super Magicom & Magic Drive
formats.   However, at present the util to convert Super Magicom files to Game
Doctor does NOT work.  Therefore that makes another reason to get ours!

We  will  not  be  spreading  false  stories about the other copiers, but only
stating  the  facts  about our own.  We let YOU decide what to purchase.  Just
remember  though, before you purchase a copier, that what you buy will be what
you will then have to use - think of it as a new computer..  you don't want it
becoming obselete.

Finally,  it  is interesting to note that when we offered the MEGACONV utility
to  the  distributors  in Taiwan, they said "What for, the Game Doctor is SxxT
and  doesn't  sell in our country and Hong Kong.." - They were quite surprised
when we said it is selling in the US!!  -- THIS IS THE REAL TRUTH AND NOT SHIT
STIRRING.


GETTING DOCUMENTATION
=====================

Mr  Scarface  of  Crystal  has  offered  to  start  typing  documents of Super
Famicom/SNES  titles  in  the  near  future.  So keep a look out on the boards
listed above.  Mr Scarface has also begun giving cheats for games on the Super
Famicom/SNES as well as information of the latest releases.

We  are  also  looking for people to type documents on other consoles.  And if
anyone can translate Japanese then that is even cooler!

We  will  be  distribute your documents with our files as we release them, and
full credit will be given accordingly.  Contact Executioner on Treasure Island
+44 (0)992 451191 or Ultimate Dream +44 (0)222 495919.

We  are  now  also  receiving hints/tips/cheat files from Quazar of Quartz for
Super  Famicom, and these will be available on Treasure Island, as well as his
own BBS - Madcap +44 (0)234 365828.


CONFUSION OVER CONTACTING EXECUTIONER?
--------------------------------------

Some people have asked how to easily contact me..  well I am sysop of Treasure
Island  BBS  +44  (0)992 451191..  I am co-sysop/console editor on a number of
different  boards,  including  Splatter  House,  Ultimate  Dream, Ghost, Toxic
Insult, Reign In Blood & Madcap.

Ultimate  Dream  has  recently  had  a lot of problems with the system and has
therefore  been  slightly low on console files.  However I still call at least
once  a  week  to  check on my mail.  Obviously to get a guaranteed answer you
should  leave  a  message on Treasure Island BBS, as with so many boards it is
quite likely it will take a long time to get a reply, or never replied at all!

Hopefully everything is now 100% clear! Catch you later dudes!



                                 THE LAST BIT
                                 ************

                    THE CONFUSION OVER TRANSFERRING GAMES

To use the 8mbit games (or bigger) - you will need access to a computer with a
HIGH DENSITY disk drive, eg.  a PC.

You  can  of  course download 99% of the games to the Amiga, and transfer with
Cross-Dos  (Supplied as standard with Workbench 2.1) to the PC for unarcing to
disk.   However,  some games are over the 720k allowed on a PC disk..  you can
either  download  straight to the PC, or connect your Amiga to a PC via serial
link.

However,  at  time of writing this it was discovered that CrossDos 5.0 will be
supporting  the  new  High  Density  disk  drives now being installed with all
A3000/A3000T  systems  in  the  USA.  These drives SHOULD soon be available to
replace  the  drives  in the Amiga.  It will also include a new package called
CrossPC,  which  is  a software based IBM emulator, that claims to support the
Serial  and  Parallel  ports  -  this  therefore  MAY allow you to control the
console through the Amiga.  Release date is unknown, but hopefully it will hit
the boards very soon from the release of this text file.

Alternatively  to  all  of  the  above  methods - you could use a IBM emulator
(Commodore  Bridgeboard  etc.)  and connect the console straight to the Amiga.
However  you  can  only  use  an  emulator/bridge  that allows FULL use of the
Parallel, and not emulation through the Amiga.

MEGACONV (MEGADRIVE)
--------

Megaconv  is  the  utility  needed to convert Game Doctor files to Super Magic
Drive..   it  is  simple  to  use, but does have a bug which means it does not
create  the  correct  header for files.  However by editing the file in a util
such  as  NewZap  or  Cygnus Ed, you can make the file work 100%.  Details are
given on the various boards, or if not, ask the sysops of the BBS you call for
your  console  files  for  help!   Hopefully by the time you read this a fixed
version will be released.

SUPERCONV (FAMICOM)
---------

Superconv  is  currently  bugged,  and like stated above, by the time you read
this a fixed version should be released.

There  is  however another easier way of getting files to work, and that is by
joining  the  header file (Amiga) that the Super Magicom requires - ie.  a 512
byte  header is JOINed, to the Game Doctor file.  This can then be transferred
to  disk  and  run as normal.  On the PC, you can simply run a batch file that
does  all  this  automatically.  The file is available on Treasure Island, and
most others.

PC-ENGINE
---------

No  convertor  util  is  currently  available.   But  there are loads of games
available on Ghost BBS for the Magic Super Griffin.

JOINZ & SPLITZ
--------------

These  commands  are  supplied  as  part  of  the  package with ART DEPARTMENT
PROFESSIONAL   2.1,   and   allow   you   to   SPLIT   the   files  on  either
AMIGA/PC/PC-WINDOWS  or APPLE MAC.  and then join then back together on any of
the  mentioned  computers.   Here  is an example of what we do for undoing the
8mbit Famicom games - that are in Game Doctor format....

LHA E FILENAME.LHA RAM:
(Undo game file)

JOIN 8MBIT.HEADER RAM:SFXXXX.XXX AS RAM:FILENAME.SMC
(converts Game Doctor file to Magicom format!)

Then  run  SPLITZ  - and split it into TWO parts, one as 720k and the other as
304k - to 2 PC disks.

Take  onto PC, and JOINZ back to 1meg file, and copy to 1.44 meg (or 1.6meg if
using FDREAD.EXE, our own util that allows you to read/write 1.6meg on the PC)
disk.

Take to Famicom, load and game works!

(4MBit  games are even easier, just join the 4mbit header, and copy to 720k PC
disk (with CrossDos etc.) and load straight on Famicom!)


                                FINAL WARNING
                                -------------

Certain  versions  of  ZIP  on  the  IBM and ZIP on the AMIGA do not like each
others compressions

To be safe - use LZH or LHA compression!

Otherwise  we will start to see corrupt console files on the boards - and this
is not wanted!

       WHEN UPLOADING FILES TO BOARDS, REMEMBER TO STATE THE FOLLOWING:

GAME TITLE
FORMAT (Multi Game Doctor or Super Magic Drive/Magicom etc...)
WHAT CONSOLE IT IS FOR (Yes this sounds obvious but so many dudes forget!)
FILESIZE (In megabits, eg. 4 or 8mbit)
LANGUAGE
