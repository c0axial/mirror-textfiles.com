Ok everyone, this is the 1st edition of the newsletter, and I'll appreciate
input from everyone. I will keep it going, so long as I have some support 
for it. So, mail me what ever you've got, and I'll add it. The paper will be
released once per week, on Sundays. I'm also looking names, version #'s, 
and locations of the best, and most essesntial console utilities, so, for
instance, send me a note with something like..


Name   : VGS - Video Game System
Author : Front Far East
Purpose: Send/Backup/Etc Files To/From SWC-DX via parallel 
Version: 94-11-19

something to that effect anyhow..

I will accecpt submissions of ftp/fsp sites for warez/utils, articles 
on anything of interest to console users, ie: programming, patching, etc. as
well as ad's for console dealers, BBS's, and reviews of console units. 

Anyhow, let's get on with it...

Ok, well that's it for sites, I hope to get some decent contributions for the
next edition.


Now, an article I stole (read: I DID NOT WRITE THIS), about different backup
units, too bad there wasn't a decent review of SWC-DX !!


=======================================================================
The Double Pro Fighter X (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis) 24M min./32M max.

Abbreviated DPFX

Parallel interface option is optional.  DSP option is optional.

1. DPFX  copies  both  SNES and Genesis videogame cartridges.  You need a
SNES  to  copy  SNES  videogame  cartridges.   You need a Genesis to copy
Genesis videogame cartridges.  With other systems such as the Game Doctor
SF  VI,  Pro  Fighter X, Super UFO Super Drive Pro.7, and Super Wild Card
DX, the unit copies only SNES videogame cartridges.
2. DPFX  has  Gameboy copier option.  With other systems such as the Game
Doctor  SF  VI, Super UFO Super Drive Pro.7, and Super Wild Card DX, this
feature is not available.  To the Pro Fighter X's credit, this feature is
optional.
3. DPFX  has  DSP  option, so that DSP-enhanced videogames can be played.
On  other systems such as the MGH, this feature is not available.  To the
Game Doctor SF VI's credit, this feature is optional.  To the Pro Fighter
X's  credit,  this  feature  is  standard  equipment.  This option is not
applicable to Genesis videogames.
4. DPFX  has  parallel  interface  option.   On the Super UFO Super Drive
Pro.7,  this  feature  is  not available.  To the Pro Fighter X's credit,
this  feature  is optional.  To the Game Doctor SF VI and Super Wild Card
DX's credit, this feature is standard equipment.
5. DPFX  has  artificial  intelligence  to  defeat  copy protection.  The
following  copy-protected  videogame cartridges can be copied by the unit
without the need for a patch:
  CLAY FIGHTER
  DEMON'S CREST
  DISNEY'S ALADDIN
  EEK! THE CAT
  FINAL FIGHT 2
  GREAT CIRCUS MYSTERY STARRING MICKEY & MINNIE, THE
  HAMMER LOCK WRESTLING
  MIDWAY NBA JAM
  ROCK N' ROLL RACING
  SUPER MARIO ALL-STARS
  TETRIS 2
  YOSHI'S SAFARI
6. DPFX  supports  two  (2)  languages:  English and Chinese.  It can use
alphanumeric (uppercase) characters in filenames.
7. DPFX has disk functions:
  RENAME FILE
  DELETE FILE
  FORMAT DISK (720K DS/DD, 800K DS/DD, 1.44M DS/HD, 1.60M DS/HD)
  COPY FILE (single copy)

========================================================================3
The Game Doctor SF VI (Super Nintendo)                 16M min./128M max.

Abbreviated GDSF6

Parallel interface is standard equipment.  DSP option is optional.

1. GDSF6  has  memory capacity expandable to 128M, available right now in
this  configuration.   You  do  not  send the unit back to the dealer for
memory  upgrades  under  most circumstances, as the unit utilizes plug-in
modules.  With other systems such as the Double Pro Fighter X, Profighter
X,  Super  UFO  Super Drive Pro.7, Super Wild Card DX, etc., the unit has
memory  capacity expandable to only 32M and you send the unit back to the
dealer for memory upgrades.
2. GDSF6 can load multiple videogames into memory and switch between them
with the Y and X buttons at the main menu.  Load your favorite videogames
into  memory and play them whenever you want, without the need to re-load
from disks each time.  The number of videogames the unit can load depends
on  memory  capacity  M,  and  is  equal to M/8.  For example, a 32M unit
(M = 32) can load 4 videogames (M/8 = 32/8 = 4).  With other systems such
as  the Double Pro Fighter X, Pro Fighter X, Super UFO Super Drive Pro.7,
Super Wild Card DX, etc., the unit can load only 1 videogame into memory.
3. GDSF6  can  maintain  memory  contents  even  when  SNES is off.  This
feature  is  particularly  useful  in  conjunction with feature #2 above.
Large videogames such as Super Street Fighter II (32M, 4 disks) require a
long  time to load.  With other systems such as the Double Pro Fighter X,
Pro  Fighter X, Super Wild Card DX, etc., the unit cannot maintain memory
contents  when  SNES  is off and you re-load every time you turn the SNES
on.   To  the  Super  UFO  Super  Drive  Pro.7's  credit, this feature is
available as standard equipment.
4. GDSF6  can copy up to M/8 (M is as defined above) videogame cartridges
without  disks.   The copies are maintained in memory as long as the unit
remains  plugged into the power supply.  Write the videogames to disks at
YOUR  convenience.   With other systems such as the Double Pro Fighter X,
Pro Fighter X, Super Wild Card DX, etc., the unit cannot copy a videogame
cartridge without disks and you must have blank disks ready at all times.
To  the  Super  UFO  Super  Drive  Pro.7's  credit,  the  unit can copy 1
videogame cartridge without disks.
5. GDSF6 has superior error-handling.  For example, you are copying a 32M
videogame  cartridge  onto  4  disks.  While writing on disk #4, the unit
reports  "Verify Disk Error !"  No problem!  Simply replace the disk with
another.   With  other  systems  such  as  the  Double Pro Fighter X, Pro
Fighter  X,  Super  UFO  Super Drive Pro.7, Super Wild Card DX, etc., the
unit has inferior error-handling.  The entire process aborts and you have
to start over with disk #1 again.
6. GDSF6  can  suspend  a  task when working with multiple disks, perform
other operations, and resume the suspended task afterwards.  For example,
you  are  copying  a 32M videogame cartridge onto 4 disks.  When prompted
for  disk  #4,  you  realize  that disk #4 is not formatted.  No problem!
Press  the  SELECT  button  to  suspend  the process.  Format disk #4 and
then  resume  copying  at disk #4.  With other systems such as the Double
Pro  Fighter  X,  Pro  Fighter X, Super UFO Super Drive Pro.7, Super Wild
Card  DX, etc., the unit cannot suspend a task when working with multiple
disks, and resume afterwards.  You have to start over with disk #1 again.
7. GDSF6  can  anticipate  your needs and responds accordingly.  Insert a
disk and turn on the SNES.  The unit will load the first videogame on the
disk  with no intervention on your part.  It will run the first videogame
in memory if there is no disk with no intervention on your part.  It will
run  the  videogame  cartridge  if  there is a videogame cartridge in the
unit,  no  disk,  and no game in memory.  It is a joy to use.  With other
systems  such as the Double Pro Fighter X, Pro Fighter X, Super UFO Super
Drive  Pro.7,  Super  Wild Card DX, etc., the unit cannot anticipate your
needs.  You have to navigate the menus.
8. GDSF6 can copy a videogame cartridge's BRAM (battery-backed-up RAM) to
its  internal BRAM, so if you have a cool save game stored on a videogame
cartridge,  you can transfer it to the unit's BRAM and use it with a copy
of  the  videogame.   The  unit  can  also  copy  its  internal BRAM to a
videogame  cartridge's  BRAM.   With other systems such as the Double Pro
Fighter  X, Pro Fighter X, Super Wild Card DX, etc., the unit cannot copy
a  videogame cartridge's BRAM to its internal BRAM or vice versa.  To the
Super  UFO  Super  Drive  Pro.7's  credit,  this  feature is available as
standard equipment.
9. GDSF6  can  test  its  memory,  BRAM, ROM, and disk drive for defects.
With other systems such as the Double Pro Fighter X, Pro Fighter X, Super
Wild  Card  DX,  etc., the unit cannot test its memory and disk drive for
defects.   To the Super UFO Super Drive Pro.7's credit, the unit can test
its ROM and memory for defects.
10. GDSF6 can be hooked up to a CD-ROM drive.  With other systems such as
the Double Pro Fighter X, Pro Fighter X, Super UFO Super Drive Pro.7, and
Super Wild Card DX, the unit cannot be hooked up to a CD-ROM drive.
11. GDSF6  has DSP option, so that DSP-enhanced videogames can be played.
On  other systems such as the MGH, this feature is not available.  To the
Double  Pro  Fighter  X's  credit,  this feature is optional.  To the Pro
Fighter X's credit, this feature is standard equipment.
12. GDSF6  has  parallel  interface option.  On the Super UFO Super Drive
Pro.7,  this  feature  is not available.  To the Double Pro Fighter X and
Pro  Fighter X's credit, this feature is optional.  To the Game Doctor SF
VI  and  Super Wild Card DX's credit, this feature is standard equipment.
You  can  transfer  videogame,  BRAM,  and  Gold Finger code data in both
directions.   With  other systems such as the Double Pro Fighter X or Pro
Fighter  X,  you  can  transfer  only videogam  data TO the unit.  To the
Super  Wild  Card DX's credit, you can transfer videogame, BRAM, and real
time save data in both directions.
13. GDSF6  has  artificial  intelligence  to defeat copy-protection.  The
following  copy-protected  videogame cartridges can be copied by the unit
without the need for a patch:
  CLAY FIGHTER
  DEMON'S CREST
  DISNEY'S ALADDIN
  EEK! THE CAT
  FINAL FIGHT 2
  GREAT CIRCUS MYSTERY STARRING MICKEY & MINNIE, THE
  HAMMER LOCK WRESTLING
  LAMBORGHINI AMERICAN CHALLENGE
  MEGA MAN X
  MIDWAY NBA JAM
  ROCK N' ROLL RACING
  TETRIS 2
  YOSHI'S SAFARI
14. GDSF6  supports  three (3) languages: English, Chinese, and Japanese.
It  chooses  filenames  automatically.   It can use numbers, alphanumeric
(uppercase),  and  space  characters  in  filenames.   A  portion  of the
filename is fixed and cannot be changed: The first two characters must be
"SF"  and  the eighth character must either be a space (single-part file)
or A, B, C, or D (multiple-part files): "SF_____x" where x is a space, A,
B, C, or D.
15. GDSF6 has disk functions:
  Format Disk (720K DS/DD, 1.44M DS/HD, 1.60M DS/HD)
  Delete File
  Copy File (single, multiple copies)
  Copy Disk (single, multiple copies)
  Rename File

========================================================================4

========================================================================5
Super UFO Super Drive Pro.7 (Super Nintendo)            16M min./32M max.

Abbreviated SUFO Pro.7

Parallel interface is not available.  DSP is not available.

1. SUFO  Pro.7  has built-in X-Terminator codes (manufacturer claims over
2,000)  for  hundreds of videogames.  On other systems such as the Double
Pro  Fighter X, Game Doctor SF VI, Super Wild Card DX, etc., this feature
is  not  available.   To  the  Pro  Fighter  X's  credit, this feature is
standard  equipment (built-in Gold Finger codes; manufacturer claims over
200).
2. SUFO  Pro.7  can  use  X-Terminator  codes.  X-Terminator is a feature
comparable  to Game Genie and is compatible with Pro Action Replay codes.
X-Terminator  codes  can  be saved to the disk.  On other systems such as
the  Double  Pro  Fighter X, Game Doctor SF VI, Super Wild Card DX, etc.,
this feature is not available.
3. SUFO Pro.7 has controller test program.
4. SUFO Pro.7 has sound effects (annoying; can be disabled).  
5. SUFO Pro.7 identifies videogame while loading videogame from disk.
6. SUFO Pro.7 reads videogame files generated by:
  UFO
  G.doctor
  P.fighter
7. SUFO  Pro.6 can maintain memory contents even when SNES is off.  Large
videogames  such as Super Street Fighter II (32M, 4 disks) require a long
time  to  load.  With other systems such as the Double Pro Fighter X, Pro
Fighter  X,  Super  Wild  Card  DX, etc., the unit cannot maintain memory
contents  when  SNES  is off and you re-load every time you turn the SNES
on.   To  the  Game  Doctor  SF VI's credit, this feature is available as
standard equipment.
8. SUFO  Pro.7 can copy a videogame cartridge without disks.  The copy is
maintained  in  memory as long as the unit remains plugged into the power
supply.   Write  the  videogame to disks at YOUR convenience.  With other
systems  such as the Double Pro Fighter X, Pro Fighter X, Super Wild Card
DX,  etc.,  the  unit cannot copy a videogame cartridge without disks and
you  must  have  blank  disks  ready at all times.  To the Game Doctor SF
VI's  credit,  the  unit  can  copy multiple videogame cartridges without
disks.
9. SUFO  Pro.7  can  copy a videogame cartridge's BRAM (battery-backed-up
RAM)  to  its  internal BRAM, so if you have a cool save game stored on a
videogame  cartridge,  you  can transfer it to the unit's BRAM and use it
with  a  copy of the videogame.  The unit can also copy its internal BRAM
to  a  videogame cartridge's BRAM.  With other systems such as the Double
Pro  Fighter  X, Pro Fighter X, Super Wild Card DX, etc., the unit cannot

Game  Doctor SF VI's credit, the unit can test its memory, BRAM, ROM, and
disk drive for defects.
11. SUFO  Pro.7  has  artificial  intelligence to defeat copy-protection.
The  unit is capable of making NTSC SNES appear to be PAL and vice-versa,
so  foreign  videogames  designed  for  PAL SNES work properly.  On other
videogame cartridge copiers such as the Double Pro Fighter X, Game Doctor
SF  VI,  Pro Fighter X, Super Wild Card DX, etc., the unit is not capable
of  making  NTSC  SNES appear to be PAL nor vice versa.  The unit is also
capable   of   over-riding  videogame  cartridge  configuration,  as  the
configuration  may  be  falsified for copy-protection purposes.  On other
videogame cartridge copiers such as the Double Pro Fighter X, Game Doctor
SF  VI,  Pro Fighter X, Super Wild Card DX, etc., the unit is not capable
of over-riding videogame cartridge configuration.

  LIST FILES

===============================================================================




Ok, enough of that, i guess, until I get some input, as to utils, etc to
add, there isn't much more. What I'd like to do also, is post an up-to-date
list of all the warez that were released in the previous week, so, every
time you find a new release, mail me with a brief description of it, and I'll
add it to the "This Weeks Warez" section. I'm also considering a reviews
section, but, as I bite at doing a decent review, I'd be willing to to take
some offers for a writer of that section. Any other ideas would be greatly 
appreciated. Don't forget, to continue to recieve the newsletter, you must
mail something of value, ie: site, review, etc.
