          This is a notes file that I maintained on my Mac as I played B&T.
        I really didn't intend this to be a walk-through description, but
        it may provide one with hints crucial to those (too frequent)
        B&T situations where one finds oneself totally in the dark as to how
        to proceed next.

          Unlike an earlier Chip's Challenge notes file [*] that I put
        together last May, this file is done in pure ascii text, including
        the maps.

          My advanced apologies for not really attempting to clean up this
        document. Any corrections or additions to this document will
        be highly appreciated.

==============================================================================

Egypt 1700 BC

        - Find 16 notes, gold nugget. Give gold nugget to guard. Go to
          ancient Egyptian who gives you scare stone. He wants you to find
          staff. With the scare stone, head back to the phonebook and
          go to Egypt 1500 BC.

        - Royal Ankh at lower right. Wade through non-wavy water to get to
          small island. Need the ankh to ride the boat in Egypt 1500

        - Give the True staff back to egyptian. He gives the following message:
                "Thank you. We shall remember this. Here is your reward.
                 This royal flute is known to lessen the danger from wild
                 animals. Also, our wise men have seen a strange star
                 fall to the northeast."
                  Password at this point: A6TF.TB01.D4YI.0ERJ

          Enabling flute at upper right part of world scares lions away. But
          you must keep activating it to have effect. There are 16 notes
          at the upper right, which gives you access to Rome 60bc.



Egypt 1500 BC
        - Activate the scare stone. Find the 2 obelisks, which tells you
           "Hey Dudes, It's us! The staff is in the large pyramid. But the
            first staff you will see is bogus!. Remember to hide this
            message for us earlier, dudes.). Back to Egypt 1500 BC and hide
          the note.

        - Holy boat at lower right. Ankh from Egypt 1700 BC lets you ride
          this. Navigate through the current maze: '*' is starting point of
          boat. 'O's indicate valkid one step movements. '-' is the dock.
          '#' are blocked-off paths. '$' is concrete docking point. 'X is
          the temple entrance

                                   ##
               OOOOOOOOOOOO  OOOOOOOO#####
        _  OOOOO     O#####  O####  OOOOOO# ###         $      #
        *OOO         OOOOOO  OOOOO# O##### #OOOO        OOOO# #OX
                     O#   OOOO   O##OOOOOOOOO##OOOOOOOOOO  OOOOO
        ===================================================

        - You can take boat the the concrete dock and enter tomb.
        - In the Large pyramid tomb, there's a maze with:
                - 4 red squares which look like you have to step on all of
                  them to activate other doors in the maze.
                - Red key
                - Fake staff
                - Blue key hole. Which leads to room with red key hole.
                - Red key hole which leads to room with lions. Lead the
                  lion out of the little chamber. I got one to follow me out,
                  but then I was killed. Later I returned back to the chamer
                  and found the True staff. I think you need to have the
                  harp to see the staff, because I was here before, without
                  discovering the temple and harp, and saw no staff.
                - Blue key

        - In the temple, there's a blue maze, which looks unsolvable, but
          there's a place in the wall with a hidden secret door. At the
          right hand corner, there's a  harp.

Rome 60 BC
        - Initial password: P000.0001.XJ6C.0G0K
        - 4 notes in arena. The others are in the dungeon. This brings total
          to 64.
    Dungeon
        - Dungeon on left has maze with:
                - 4 blue doors
                - 1 blue door wih lion. Behind lion is black door. When the
                  door opens, the lion doesn't chase you. It just roams around.
                - 1 blue key which opens 3 doors with 3 noes
                - Black key at lower right part of maze
        - Once you have obtained Caesar's Lyre and given it to him, it
          becomes just a "Lyre" in the inventory. Open the door to the
          lion-guarded room with the blue key. Now activate the Lyre before
          entering. Enter. The lion will leave at this point. Unlock the
          door with the white key. You'll get a Page for Texas 1880. When you
          exit this room, activate the Lyre again to make the lion move
          away.
        - After aquiring the page: Password: KA33.7L02.TG71.0HGL
        - Once you have the Texas 1800 page, and you get to the booth and try
          to activate it, a message will appear saying:
                "Heinous, Dude. Time Paradox!"
        - Ceasar wants you to find his lyre.
        - I guess with 64 notes, you can leave Colosseum (bottom of arena)
          to the Town

        - (starting password L8ZV.R505.GGPH.6N0S) This is strange. After I
          obtained the harmonica, and explored San Dimas 2691 thoroughly,
          I went back to Rome 60 BC and picked up the black key that was at the
          lower right cell of the dungeon. It was actually a gold key!
          Password: 9ADS.PS05.JGRB.6NSF. I had 112 notes before picking up
          this key, and as soon as I picked the key up, I was up to 128!.


    Town
        - 1 person in the garden tells you: "Follow the statue dude."
        - Another preson tells you "The fountain is in pieces."
        - Another persone tells you "The fountain is broken".
        - There is a statue whose arm points northeast. Around the statue,
          there's four corner pieces. Push all of these diagonaly into the
          statue and the statue disappears, and the blocks spread apart
          again. Repeat and step where the statue was, and you'll get
          transported to Courtyard 1

    Courtyard 1
        - Z7P0.ZN02.8M2P.0HCH
        - 4 notes in this area.
        - Door is locked to the outside of the Courtyard. When you get
          killed though, you get kicked to Outside of Courtyard
        - I saw an instrument towards the top of this screen. Perhaps a Lyre.
          It's protected by a wall of bushes. There's a path to the instrument
          that comes out of the back of a building

    Building
        - Contains a bunch of guards walking. Need the Pipe Organ (picked
          up in Building of Europ 1700, in order to walk through. With the
          Pipe Organ in hand, the guards will be spinning. Walk to the
          back of the building, across the path and get Caesar's Lyre.
          A funny thing though. As soon as I got the Lyre, my Apple
          disappeared from my inventory!
          After obtaining Caesar's Lyre: Password: B7A9.AB02.PG55.0FLG
        - Return the Lyre back to Caesar and he says:
                "My Lyre! Dudes, Here is your Gift Wrapped Reward!
        - Caesar gives you a Lyre

    Outside of Courtyard
        - A hidden phone page just south of the door, surrounded by trees.
          It's a page for Europe.
        - A guard who says he's hungry. Give him the apple found in the
          Maze Building. He'll let you enter the Town.
          Password: J1YS.FJ02.AP4T.0HR1
        - 2 notes at left side of screen surrounded by trees
        - 3 notes in the canyon (Makes a total of 80 notes

    Maze Building
        - A building with a hidden-path type maze, which leads to an apple
          'O's are valid one-cell path. 'A' is the apple. 'X' is the
          entrance/exit to the building

                before getting apple

                O  OAOO
                O  O  O
                O  O OOOOO
                O  OOO
                O    OOOOO
                O O      O
                O OO OOO O
                O O  O   O
                OOOOOOOO O
                  O    O O
                  OOOO O O
                    XX OOO

                I ended up making a new map after getting apple. It seemed
                the previous map no longer was valid

                  OOO A
                    O OOOOOO
                    O    O O
                   OOOOOOO O
                   O O   O O
                  OO OOO O O
                  O  O O O O
                  O      O O
                  O OOOOOOOO
                  O      O
                  O OOOO O
                  OOO XX O

        - After leaving the courtyard, password: H1YS.FJ6R.CNGV.0IDZ

Europe 1700 A.D.
        - Password: L1YS.FJDF.GP8B.0HMG
    Building
        - You enter a building with floor tiles are composed of primarily of
          red dots. Make sure to walk to the green dotted tiles. Going
          from the 1st to 2nd green dot, I headed first to the left then up.
          Before going from the 2nd to 3rd, Make sure all three moving
          objects are to the right of you. Position them by quickly joggin
          below then back up to the green dot. When the coast is clear,
          head up the the hallway with the pulsating silver tiles. Step on
          these tiles when they're silver to avoid dying.
        - Found a white key. Password: H7JF.A2DF.KQY7.0GR1
        - Step lightly across the paths, beyond the swinging axe (step across
          when it has completely stopped when it points towards you). Work
          your way towards the top, where you'll exit the building
        - Password: H7JF.A2DF.KRCQ.0GBI
        - Use the black key to open the gate.
        - At the upper right of the building, there's a pipe organ. Just before
          this, it seems as if ths shifting tiles is unpassable. It is
          possible Use speed to quickly skip the tiles. Apply the magic
          wand to the organ, to shrink an add it to your inventory. Also,
          it doesn't seem like it's possible, but the path back to the entrance
          of the building can be completed, with timing.
          After: Password: 7B1Q.6MDF.QFLE.0FBQ

    Cemetery.
        - There's a red key at upper left of the cemetery.
        - A building at the upper left with a read lock. (Can be opened by
          the red key. This building contains a maze with:
                - a vampire
                - a bat
                - a magic wand.
                - what looks like a box. I believe it is a coffin that the
                  vampire emerges from, when you enter the building. I applied
                  everything I had against it including the wand, but I was
                  unable to pick it up or effect it.
                - Leaving building: password: H88W.9DDF.KDL9.0GIF
        - A building at the upper right with a gold lock
        - Going back to the building, I noticed that the shifting tiles would
          not work to bring me back to the entrance to the building. I wandered
          around some more in the cemetery, looking for the yellow key,
          but got nowhere. I decided to get the password and reset the game
          with:
                F88W.9DDF.KEPY.0FER <- this password brings you back to Europe
                1700 at the front of the first building with guitar, 80 notes,
                scare stone, harp, flute, blue key, white key, apple,
                black key, magic wand.

    Building with gold keylock:
        - A mandolin at the upper left of the maze. This area, by the layout,
          of this building looks very similar to the other building in the
          cemetery. Current passowrd GAFB.79K7.UGZU.6PCD
        - After picking up the key and the building, I ofund 6 notes in
          the cemetery. This brings the total up to 134.
          Password HAGS.6ZDi.Ti5K.6NNR
        - With the mandolin, I went back to San Dimas 2691


Rome 70 BC.
    Colosseum
        - You'll end up transported into the same colosseum as Rome 60 BC
        - At the south end of the Colosseum, there's a guard that says:
          Sorry, Dude. You're Staying!
        - After coming back from Texas (and having acquired the San Dimas page,
          come back to the Dungeon. There will be 4 notes here.
        - Coming back from texas, and getting all the notes, there will
          be a total of 112 notes. Password: W8TR.RBDH.U01I.6NVN
        - This is weird with the password above, I start at Texas 1800
          with 112 notes, and I can now go to San Dimas and avoid the
          Time paradox. My inventory with this password: Guitar, 112 notes
          scare stone, harp, flute, blue key, lyre white key, pipe organ
          magic wand, train ticket. I'm confused. i thought I had a gold
          nugget also. Down in the dungeon I grabbed the Texas 1800 page
          (again) and tried to go for the black key, but was unable to
          remove either. I went back to Texas to check if I had previously
          grabbed the gold coindsthat was to the left of the train station.
          The skull wasn't there, and now I can't remember whether I picked
          up both gold coins or just the one below the booth, oh well.

    Dungeon
        - Deliver the black key to the room at the lower right where it was
          originally found. This allows you to use the Texas 1800 page,
          bypassing the time paradox. Password after: 88P6.8Z03.796T.6KM5.
        - After coming back from Texas (and having acquired the San Dimas page,
          come back to the Dungeon. There will be 12 notes here.


Texas 1800
    Cactus Area
        - Cactus walls and scorpions
        - A gold coin beneath a cattle head skeleton at lower right of this
          area
        - A note? or a phone page for San Dimas 2691 under a cattle head
          skeleton in the area below the boot. Password: K8QP.RFDG.ZB4S.6P23

    Steve's Saloon
        - A bartender who says:

        - A cowboy behind the desk who says:
                "Buy tickets at the station!"

    Rick's Stable
        - A cowboy who says:
                "Say hi to Billy the Kid!"

    Sheriff station:
        - Billy the kid who says:
                "Long time Dude! Bust me out, and you'll get my harmonica!"
        - Acquire the Dynamite! from San Dimas 2691 and stuff it into
          Billy's jail cell. He'll say:
                "Excellent, Dude!  Let's blow this joint! Back up and duck!"
        - You'll end up with a harmonica in your inventory, and the Dynamite
          is gone. Password at this point: L8ZV.R5Di.A0X5.6QFA. Nothing
          to happens when you go back to his cell.

    Ticket Station
        - Someone says:
                "Tickets cost money, Dude!"
        - Exchange the gold coin (from the lower right of the Cactus Area
          for a Train Ticket. After: password: S2UC.0ZDG.ZAL3.6MM7

    Hand crank train
        - Need to apply ticket to get on
        - Use to get 2 notes, gold coin to the left of the station, and
          1 note to the left of the station.
        - To the left of the train station, there's another cattle head skill
          with another Gold Coin beneath it. Need to get

San Dimas 2691
        - Password when I first arrived: Y8TR.RB05.1DSZ.6NH0
        - Dynamite! at lower left island
        - After getting Dynamite: password: 99i7.QM05.1E1F.6P24
        - Near the top left there seems to be land, which you can't move
          further across unless you have the Harmonica from Billy the Kid
          from Texas 1800, or so it seems. Last time I was here, without
          the harmonic activated, I got inundated by ghosts and bats.
        - Exploring the top part of this land, I see a vampire that's
          beneath a blue wall. There are shifting tiles that lead to
          him though.
        - Activating the mandolin (see Europe Gold lock building, I went
          near the top and entered the vampire's domain. He says:
                "Play my game if you dare!"
          Use this password to start  with 128 notes and next to
           the phonebooth: BAGU.A005.YL8G.6HTG

        - After some fruitless searching (see Approach #1), I think that the
          order in which you obtain the next 16 notes are crucial.

          Approach #1, which I tried first left me with 14 notes (142 total),
          and left me at a complete dead end (or maybe I didn't look hard
          enough?)

          Approach # 2 was successful. Either way, I think it's very crucial
          to learn how to jump from one tile to a second, and then back again,
          at the same time scanning the route ahead of you. This shuffling
          will be needed, especially at the final shifting tile screen after
          one obtains "The Babes"

          Approach #1
                - Note  1 - at platform to entrance
                      2,3 - at bottom left. Screen changes after 3rd note
                        3b ?  - at bottom middle
                        4 - at bottom left corner. Next need to push blocks
                            to upper left corner. This leads to path which
                            runs left to right to upper center rest area.
                        5 - at upper right quadrant
                        6 - at bottom right. Screen will change after picking
                            this up
                        7 - at bottom right
                        8 - at top right. Head towards rest area at top middle
                        9 - just above two girls. Screen changes.
                        10 - at far left
                        11 - at top left. Theny you'll need the 2 blocks from top
                             left and bring down to far middle left
                        12 - just to the SW of the two girls
                        13 - at far bottom
                        14 - at far upper right corner

                        [ after much examination, I declared this situation
                          to be a DEAD END. I could see a 15th note, but there
                          was no way to reach it, the way the shifting tiles
                          were moving. Sigh.]

          Approach #2

                - Note  1 - at platform to entrance
                      2,3 - at bottom left. Screen changes after 3rd note
                            Head down to far bottom.
                        4 - At bottom right corner
                        5 - At bottom left corner
                        6 - At upper right quadrant. Screen will change after
                            picking this up. Killed self. Landed back in
                            previous screen. Headed back to bottom right.
                            Screen changes when reaching the tile where the
                            5th note was found.
                        7 - At bottom right
                        8 - At top right.
                        9 - Just above two girls. Screen changes. Killed self.
                            Screen changes to previous. Headed back down to
                            lower right corner. Landed on tile where the
                            7th note was. Screen changes.
                       10 - At bottom right quadrant. Head towards top middle.
                       11 - At upper right corner
                       12 - At far left corner
                       13 - At top left. Bring the 2 blocks from this area,
                            to use in the lower area.
                       14 - Just to the left and below the princesses
                       15 - At far bottom. Screen changes after this. Head
                            to far right corner and starting from here,
                            head left towards the princesses. Pick up the
                            princesses. "The Babes" will be added to your
                            inventory. When I checked I had 144 notes! I
                            don't know where the 144th was picked up. The
                            Screen changes

                        Getting to the exit:

                        Starting at the lower right tile of the 4 tile that's
                        in the center:
                                - Right 4 tiles
                                - Down 3 tiles
                                - Left about 7 tiles until an upside down L
                                - Head all the way until the top row of tiles.
                                  You'll be situated very close to the
                                  exit. This is a red herring.
                                - Hang a left and work your way counter-clockwise
                                  around the perimeter of this room
                                - Near the exit, alhough you're close to the
                                  exit - careful, this is another red herring.
                                  You'll need to head down, jog left, then
                                  head up again. Time it correctly so you
                                  land on the 4 tile platform.

        - Choose the mandolin in order to get back out. At this point after
          I exited the shifting tile room. I hoppped over to the right
          to get back to "land", and once there, I found my movements urely
          orthogonal - I couldn't move diagonally. Couldn't maneuvur through
          the cave entrances withouth moving diagonally. I headed back to the
          entrance of the shifting tile room (where the vampire is), killed
          myself, and then found myself back on "land" again, with my
          diagonal movements resotred.
          password at this point: 6B4S.6K05.ZMQZ.6g82

        - I headed back towards the phone booth - I still had my mandolin
          activated. At the front of the booth, next to Ted, was the vampire.
          He blocks the way into the booth. Activate your guitar and ram
          the vampire. He'll say "I LOST!" Password: 6B4S.6K05.ZMUH.6g4J.

        - Enter the phone booth, choose San Dimas as a destination and
          an end screen showing Bill and Ted playing guitars, with
          the Two Babes hugging them appears. The following message scrolls
          up:
                        "...AND THIS, BY
                           RESCUING THE
                          BABES FROM THE
                          CLUTCHES OF THE
                            GRIM REAPER,
                            BILL AND TED
                            RETURNED TO
                          THEIR HOMES IN
                           SAN DIMAS AND
                          COMPLETED THEIR
                          MOST EXCELLENT
                            ADVENTURE



                            THE END ? "

        - The status screen shows up at this point. Password is
          8B4S.6K06.0MUH.6g4i. Hitting the "A" button gets you back to the
          end screen and end message. Funny thing - I tried entering this
          password, and I end up back at the start of San Dimas 2691, with
          128 notes, and no Princesses - looks like you'll have to do the
          whole damn shifting tile room all over again. Most heinously bogus!
