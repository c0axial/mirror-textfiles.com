Do you have the GAME HUNTER? Do you want those protected files?  Don't
worry, the adapter is now out for the Game Hunter/Game Boxer! The adapter
fits right in the slot where the Hunter sits now on your SNES. The adapter
also is upgradeable when new protection comes out all you have to do is
buy the chip not the whole adapter! Right now the adapters are going for
$75.00 (plus shipping)  In the future as chips come out they will run only
a few bucks.

NOW APPEARING ON CONSOLE MADNESS:
The following files were copied by the Game Boxer and will run/play on the
Boxer _OR_ your Game Hunter (both machines are made by the same company).
However be advised you DO need the adapter to play these files:

THESE are NOT the FIG files these are for the GAME HUNTER/GAME BOXER.

THE ADAPTER.

    /____/    \____\ PReSS Console Division presents...

         Information on the new file format BOX...

	  Files with the BOX description were copied off of a Game Boxer and 
   are binary format only playable on a machine with a "Copy Card" or 
   DSP chip upgrade installed.

        We could have released some of this stuff over a month ago, but we
wanted to wait until the copy cards were released....  We know Magical has
released some of the games, but since there are currently no file
converters between Boxers and Fighters, we decided that people want to
play these games NOW!
   All of the games have been tested on an MGH for incompatabilities.

        Multi-Game Hunters, Game Boxers, and Copy Cards are available NOW!
        from your favorite console dealer...  

        NOTE:  All games except Mario Kart, Pilot Wings, and Dungeon Master use
   the same Copy Card!  The Copy Card is NOT game specific!
