=======================================================================

Q-1:  How many levels are there in Donkey Kong Country?

	There are 33 "normal" levels, 67 bonus rooms, and seven boss
	areas.  There are also six each of the "friendly" areas
	(Candy Kong, Cranky Kong, and Funky Kong).

	The first six bosses do not count towards the percentage total.
	The remaining 101 areas (33 levels, 67 bonus rooms, and
	the very last boss in "Gangplank Galleon") each count as 1%
	towards the completion total.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q-2:  How can I tell if I've found all of the bonus rooms in a level?

	On the map screen, a level is marked with an exclamation point
	once there are no undiscovered bonus rooms remaining in it.

	(e.g., "Ropey Rampage" becomes "Ropey Rampage!" when all of its
	bonus rooms are found.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q-3:  How can I jump for extra distance (horizontally)?

	This question and Q-4 are related, because the same technique
	covers both.  The trick is that the Kongs can jump upwards out
	of a cartwheel (Diddy Kong) or barrel-roll (Donkey Kong), just
	as if they were standing on solid ground...  even if they
	happen to be in mid-air at the time.

	Example:

	In "Jungle Hijinks," there is a red balloon above the group
	of trees is just past the [K] icon.  There is a second red
	balloon over the next group of trees beyond that, and if you
	move quickly you will find a green balloon over the third
	group of trees.

	But the trees are spaced too far apart for Diddy to jump from
	group to group, even with a running start.  Also, the second
	and third sets of treetops can't be reached from the ground.

	How do you collect the second and third balloons?  By rolling
	off a tree, and then jumping from mid-air... which increases
	the total horizontal distance which can be covered in a single
	jump.

	In detail:

	(A) Position Diddy on the right-hand edge of the first group
	    of trees, where you collected the first red balloon.

	(B) Press "right" on the control pad and the "Y" button
	    (approximately simultaneously), and Diddy will cartwheel
	    off the tree towards the right.  

	(C) At any time before Diddy finishes the cartwheel move, (the
	    later, the better), press and hold the "B" button to jump
	    as high as possible.  (Don't forget to continue to hold
	    "right" on the control pad so that you jump to the right!)

	If your timing is good, you will land on the left edge of the
	next group of trees just in time to jump up and collect the
	second red balloon (before it floats away).

	With practice, you will be able to jump these large gaps quickly
	and easily.  This technique comes in handy later in the game --
	there is at least one bonus room that I can't reach without it,
	and at least one more that is far easier to reach with this
	technique.  But it is not stricly necessary to be able to
	cartwheel-jump, to get to the end of any level (or "win" the
	game with less than 101%).

	Unrelated note:

	This example, incidentally, is a good way to pick up lives very
	quickly.   In "Jungle Hijinks"... pick up the balloon in Donkey
	Kong's tree-house and then these three treetop balloons, for a
	total of five quick lives.  Then quit the level with pause-
	select (and re-enter to repeat as ofter as desired).  I'm able
	to earn extra lives more quickly this way than with the "DYDDY"
	controller code (which is discussed later in this file).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q-4:  How can I grab things out of a pit without falling to my death?

	This question and Q-3 are related, because the same technique
	covers both.  The trick is that the Kongs can jump upwards out
	of a cartwheel (Diddy Kong) or barrel-roll (Donkey Kong), just
	as if they were standing on solid ground...  even if they
	happen to be in mid-air at the time.

	Example:

	In "Stop & Go Station", the golden letter [O] icon sits just
	below the level of the surrounding land, in a pit which kills
	Diddy or Donkey Kong should they fall into it and off the
	screen.

	How do you go about getting the [O] without losing a life?  By
	cart-wheeling (or barrel-rolling) into the pit, falling partway
	down (far enough to collect the [O])... and then jumping upwards
	out of the roll in mid-air, to get back onto solid ground.

	In detail:

	(A) Position Donkey Kong (or Diddy Kong) at the left edge
	    of the pit, facing to the right.

	(B) Press "right" on the control pad and the "Y" button
	    approximately simultaneously, and Donkey (Diddy) will
	    barrel roll (cartwheel) to the right and slightly 
	    downwards into the pit.

	(C) Once Donkey (Diddy) touches the [O] and collects it,
	    press and hold the "B" button to jump up to the ground
	    level on the opposite side of the pit.  (Don't forget to
	    continue to hold "right" on the control pad so that you
	    jump to the right!)
	    
	This is a move which requires some practice, but it isn't too
	difficult once you get the hang of it.  

	Again, it is not strictly necessary to be able to do this in
	order to "win" the game, but you can't get "101%" or pick up
	some of the interesting items (e.g., also the [K] in "Forest
	Frenzy", and many other letter icons and bananas, especially
	in the later parts of the game) without it.

	Unrelated note:  Not every item in a pit requires this
	strategy.  Sometimes an item in a pit, especially a vertical
	line of bananas, is a hint that there is a hidden barrel
	cannon off-screen.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q-5:  What's the "Diddy controller code"?  How does it work?

	It is a controller sequence that leads to a special bonus
	room,  which always contains three golden icons of each animal.
	This allows repeated play in any of the animal bonus games
	(as Enguarde, Expresso, Rambi, or Winky).

	The code is "DYDDY" (down, Y, down, down, Y).  Enter that
	exact sequence of directions and buttons on the controller,
	during the introductory screen that shows Cranky Kong turning
	the handle on a record player.

	In order to collect lives in this special area and then take
	the collected lives into a game, it is necessary to perform
	one extra "setup" step before entering the special bonus room:
	first get the "GAME OVER" screen by losing your last life IN
	A LEVEL THAT IS COMPLETED.

		(For more information on the meaning of "COMPLETED",
		 see [NOTE 1] below.)

	When the "GAME OVER" screen is displayed, press "start" once
	to dismiss it and return to the game's opening sequence.  Wait
	for Cranky Kong to show up.  When he appears, enter the "DYDDY"
	code to get to the special bonus room.

	       (In a two-player game, the player who died last must
		press "start" to dismiss the "GAME OVER" screen;  then
		"Player #1" -- the player using the controller plugged
		into the left-hand side of the unit -- must enter the
		"DYDDY" code, play the bonus games, and exit.)

	When the special bonus room is entered in this way -- following
	a "GAME OVER" screen that is due to losing your last life in a
	"COMPLETED" level -- it is possible to exit the special bonus
	room with start-select.

		(For more information on start-select, see
		 [NOTE 2] below.)

	When you exit the special bonus room in this manner... you will
	be returned to the game that you died in, on the main map
	screen at the level where you lost your final life.

	The main map will not "forget" any of "unsaved" progress that
	was made before your death.  Also, you will still have all of
	the lives and spare animal icons which you collected in the
	special bonus room.

		(If you think you are following the instructions
		 and still cannot get out of the special area,
		 see [NOTE 3] below.)


	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

	[NOTE 1]	Dying in a "COMPLETED" level

	A "COMPLETED" level is one where you have reached and walked
	through the exit door.  Any "COMPLETED" level is marked with
	Diddy or Donkey Kong's head on the map screen, while any
	non-complete level is marked with a Kremling's head.

	->  It is not necessary that you find any or all of the bonus
	    rooms in the level.

	->  It is not necessary that you die in the level which you
	    completed the most recently, or a level which you completed
	    since starting your current game.  (i.e., it can be a level
	    which you completed long ago, saved in a completed state,
	    and had not revisited until you went in there and died.)

	->  It is not necessary that the completed state of the level
	    be saved.  (i.e., even if it IS a level which you have
	    completed since the last "save," and it will revert to
	    "uncompleted" status if you reset the game, it still counts
	    as completed for the sake of returning from the special
	    bonus room.)


	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

	[NOTE 2]	How to use start-select

	Press "start" to pause the game.  Wait a second or so, then
	press "select".  (If you press "select" too quickly following
	"start", "select" is ignored.)

	This is the same controller sequence which is used in both
	this game and Super Mario World, to exit a level which you
	have previously completed.  The sequence allows you to exit
	from anywhere in a level, even from inside its bonus rooms.

	If you aren't sure you are using start-select properly, try
	playing the game and using it to exit any completed level.
	If you can exit an already-completed level with this sequence,
	then you are doing it properly and should be able to exit the
	special bonus room in the same way (...providing that you had
	set-up your entry to the special bonus room properly).


	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

	[NOTE 3]	Still can't get there?

	Are you still having trouble exiting from the special bonus
	room and carrying your lives back into the game?  Try the
	following four things:

	[A]  Be sure you are trying to exit from the special bonus room
	     itself.  "start-select" is always disabled while playing
	     any of the animal bonus games... so it is never possible
	     to exit from them.

	[B]  Be sure you are using start-select properly.  Test yourself
	     by using it to successfully exit from a "COMPLETED" level 
	     while you are playing a normal game (see [NOTE 2]).

	[C]  Be sure you are dying in a "COMPLETED" level to get the
	     "GAME OVER" screen before entering the special bonus room
	     (see [NOTE 1]).

	[D]  If all else fails... try following the steps below, exactly
	     and carefully, to test yourself and/or your cartridge.
	     These steps reproduce a situation which is known to permit
	     many different people to exit the special bonus room:

	     1. Erase one of the three saved games, and start that
		game as a one-player game.  (This resets the game to a
		known state.)

	     2. Finish "Jungle Hijinks" by walking through the exit
		door, so that the level is marked with Donkey/Diddy
		Kong's head instead of a Kremling's.  (It does not
		matter whether you visit any of its bonus rooms.)

	     3. Backtrack to "Jungle Hijinks" and re-enter it.  (If you
		have not done so yet, this is a good place to test your
		ability to exit a completed level with "start-select".)
		Kill yourself off.  Keep re-entering "Jungle Hijinks"
		and killing yourself, until you lose your last life in
		"Jungle Hijinks" and then see the "GAME OVER" screen.

	     4. Press "start" once to dismiss the "GAME OVER" screen,
		and wait for Cranky Kong to appear.

	     5. When Cranky appears, enter the "DYDDY" sequence to get
		to the special bonus room.

	     6. After winning at least one life in the various animal
		games, use "start-select" (see [NOTE 2]) when inside
		the special bonus room, to exit it.

	     Following Step 6... you should be returned to the map area,
	     back in your brand new one-player game.  "Jungle Hijinks"
	     should still show as "COMPLETED", even though you didn't
	     "save" the game between completing that level and getting
	     the "GAME OVER" screen.  Your "life counter" should show
	     all of the lives that you collected in the special bonus
	     room.

	     (If this sequence does NOT work for you, contact me via 
	      E-mail at "stassen@alc.com", and we will decide what to
	      try next.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q-6:  Where are the special "2x" icons?

    In each animal bonus area, there is a special extra-huge icon that
    doubles the quantity of golden icons collected so far, making it
    possible to get as many as eight extra lives in a single run.  
    (Actually, I've been told nine is possible, but haven't been able
    to do it.)  These icons are located:

    Expresso -- at the extreme right-hand end of the level, beyond
	where the level appears to end.  (Go to the third (last) area
	to the right, stand on the last step on the right-hand wall,
	and jump as high as possible AND flap once for extra height,
	to get through an off-screen break in the wall.)

    Enguarde -- in a hidden room at the bottom-center of the area.  It
	is straight down from Enguarde's starting position.  (Go through
	an apparently solid wall.)

	Incidentally, there are three other hidden rooms in Enguarde's
	area.  (One in the top-center, straight up from Enguarde's
	starting position;  one at the left-center, straight left from
	Enguarde's starting position;  and one at the right-center,
	straight right from Enguarde's starting position.)  These
	rooms contain groups of the golden enguarde icons.

    Rambi -- at the extreme right-hand end of the level, beyond where
	the level appears to end.  (Jump on top of the entrance door,
	stick to the highest ledges while moving across the whole level
	to the right, then jump over the right-hand cliff and head down
	into the special area.)

    Winky -- at the extreme left-hand end of the level, beyond where 
	the level appears to end.  (Cross to the left-hand side, climbing
	up to the top of the level, and jump over the left-hand wall.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q-7:  Are there any ways to bypass parts of some levels?


    - Barrel Cannon Canyon

	To skip some of the first half of the level:  Walk up above the
	entrance (bounce off the "Kritter" to get up on top of the
	doorway) and jump into the barrel cannon hidden at the extreme
	left.  Jump into the overhead barrel cannon of the tree that it
	deposits you on.  You'll be transported to the last barrel
	cannon sequence before halfway point of the level.

	To skip most of the second half of the level:  just past the
	continue barrel, use Diddy to bounce consecutively off a few
	purple "Kritter"s (in the vicinity of the second bonus room)
	and then off a green one while he is still standing on a small
	hill at the extreme right-hand end of the land area.
		After hitting the green "Kritter", bounce left and
	up as high as possible, to land on a nearby treetop.  From
	there it is possible to jump into a high (usually off-screen)
	"barrel cannon", which blasts into a horizontal sequence that
	ends just short of the exit.


    - Mine Cart Carnage

	To skip nearly the entire level:  Jump over the barrel cannon
	that's just beyond the entrance (the one which blasts you into
	the first mine cart), and fall down as far to the left as
	possible (against the cliffside).  You'll fall into an
	off-screen barrel cannon that deposits you in a mine cart
	shortly before the exit (there is one "Krash" cart coming the
	other way that you'll have to jump).

	[Source:  Dave Kilman <dkliman@panix.com>]


    - Stop & Go Station

	To skip nearly the entire level:  Walk back through the entrance
	door to be transported to a few screens short of the end of
	the level.


    - Snow Barrel Blast

	To skip most of the second half of the level:  in the barrel
	cannon sequence that is just past the golden Rambi icon (which
	is above a rotating barrel cannon with two "Zinger"s), blast
	straight down from the third barrel cannon.  You'll land in a
	sequence of horizontal-blasting barrel cannons which kick you
	up and out just short of the exit.


    - Slipslide Ride

	To skip about two thirds of the level:  on the ledge above
	the entrance (where the first bonus room is located) there is
	a barely-visible on-screen barrel cannon above the entrance
	to the bonus room.  (It is hard to see because it is the same
	color as the background.)  When you jump into it, you will
	emerge a short distance before the end of the level.


    - Poison Pond

        To skip a few sets of mincers:  head straight to the left
	after picking up the [N], past a single side-to-side mincer
	and then a "room" with three rotating mincers.  Go straight
	across this room and through the left-hand wall.  Upon
	entering a hidden room, go through its left-hand wall to
	appear in the middle of the last vertical shaft before the exit.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q-8:  Does the ending change depending on the percentage of completion?

	Not in any significant way.

	Upon winning the game with less than 101% complete:  just at
	the start of the endgame sequence, Cranky says a few lines
	about being sure there are some things you haven't found yet.

	Upon winning the game with 101% complete:  at the same point
	of the endgame, Cranky will instead congratulate you for
	finding everything.

	All of the rest of the endgame stays the same.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q-9:  Is the original "Donkey Kong" game hidden within DKC?

	There have been a couple of rumors to this effect -- probably
	because one of Cranky Kong's sayings at his cabin is that
	he is leaving to play the original Donkey Kong game.

	There have not yet been any solid reports in r.g.v.n about
	how to get there, and I personally doubt that it is present.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q-10: Are there any "warps"?

	There are three warps in Kongo Jungle.  They occur at each point
	where a path between levels bends.  To activate a warp, press
	the "B" just as the map screen's marker reaches a bend in the
	path.

	Note that it must be a accomplished with a single press of the
	"B" button at exactly the right time (I have not been able to
	get into the warp by constantly and furiously pressing "B").

	The only paths with bends in the whole game are:

	1) between "Jungle Hijinks" and "Ropey Rampage" (warps to about
	   the middle of "Orang-utan Gang")

	2) first bend between "Cranky's Cabin" and "Reptile Rumble" 
	   (warps to the middle of "Ropey Rampage")

	3) second bend between "Cranky's Cabin" and "Reptile Rumble"
	   (warps to just past the middle of "Orang-utan Gang")

	If you successfully warp beyond the levels which you have
	completed (e.g., you warp to "Orang-utan Gang" but have not
	yet reached that level without the warp), the levels in 
	between are NOT marked as completed.

	Once you have warped, it is not possible to get back to
	the early levels of the game -- except by winning the entire
	game, which returns you to "Jungle Hijinks".  (Since the
	intervening levels are not marked as completed, the "flight
	path" from "Monkey Mines" to "Vine Valley" is never made
	available.

    Q-11: Are there any Game Genie codes?


	Note:  There are two different versions of this game.  If the
	first code doesn't work on your cartridge, try the alternate
	one.

	----------

	Lives:

	C2C9-4E2C  [Works on both versions]  Infinite lives

	D568-C34D  [Alternate: D568-C33D]  Start with 8 lives
	DC68-C34D  [Alternate: DC68-C33D]  Start with 11 lives
	DE68-C34D  [Alternate: DE68-C33D]  Start with 16 lives
	FB68-C34D  [Alternate: FB68-C33D]  Start with 26 lives
	7468-C34D  [Alternate: 7468-C33D]  Start with 51 lives
	0868-C34D  [Alternate: 0868-C33D]  Start with 76 lives

	----------

	Invincibility:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		BR-1.  Kongo Jungle bonus rooms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Jungle Hijinks

  * First right-hand wall after the Rambi crate.
	LEVEL:  red balloon

  * Right-hand wall in the pit under the tree with [G].  It's just
    after a big hill -- or just about where the first bonus room
    exits, if that route was taken instead.
	MATCH:  Rambi, Expresso, Winky, Enguarde icons


- Ropey Rampage

  * Low off-screen barrel cannon, just to the right of the tree with
    [O].  (Walk to the right off of the [O] tree, fall straight down
    into the barrel cannon.)
	LEVEL:  [N]

  * Low off-screen barrel cannon, just left of the red arrow signpost.
    (Fall into the pit just before the red arrow sign.)
	FIND:  red balloon


- Reptile Rumble

  * Right-hand wall, immediately below [K].
	LEVEL:  red balloon

  * Visible barrel cannon above and left of a "DK" barrel on a hill,
    between [K] and [O].  (The barrel cannon is only visible when
    standing on the hill.  There is a second similar hill after the
    continue barrel, which does not have a barrel cannon nearby.)
	LEVEL:  only bananas

  * Right-hand wall of two-"Slippa" pit, just past the continue barrel
    and the [N] icon.
	LEVEL:  only bananas

  <None>


- Barrel Cannon Canyon

  * Hidden doorway on the cliff-side just past [O].  (It is not possible
    to get to the doorway carrying a barrel.  It is necessary to blast
    straight into the cliff-side -- intentionally missing the moving
    "connecting" barrel cannon -- immediately after collecting the [O]
    icon.)
	BLAST-SIDEWAYS:  DK barrel and red balloon

  * Right-hand wall of the pit that is between the 2nd and 3rd purple
    "Kritter"s after the continue barrel.
	BLAST-UP:  top off-screen prizes:  Enguarde icon on the left,
	red balloon in the center, and a bunch of bananas on the right.

    past the steel-rim barrel that can be picked up.
	BLAST-AROUND:  only bananas

  * High off-screen barrel cannon at LEFTmost position the first movable
    tire can reach (the left edge of a wide, shallow pit with three
    "Klaptraps").  The path up to the barrel cannon is marked with three
    bananas in a vertical line.
	BLAST-UP:  top off-screen prizes:  bunch of bananas on the left
	and in the center, and Enguarde icon on the right.


- Millstone Mayhem

  * High off-screen barrel cannon above the entrance door.  (Use the
    tire to bounce up on top of the entrance, then jump upwards from
    there.)
	BLAST-UP:  top off-screen prizes:  DK barrel on the left,
	bunch of bananas in the center, and [K] on the right.

  * Visible barrel cannon over 3rd millstone.  (Get the movable tire

    right.)
	SPELL:  "RARE" for Enguarde icon

  * Right-hand wall below the fifth millstone.

    line.
	SPELL:  "KONG" for Expresso icon

    a barrel cannon and two "Necky"s;  before the continue barrel.
	JUMP:  2 blue "Klaptraps" for red balloon

  * Left-hand wall beside a single coconut-thrower on stair-step "hill."
	BLAST-SIDEWAYS:  DK barrel, red balloon

  * Visible barrel cannon up and LEFT of entrance.  (Can get high enough
    by having Diddy bounce off Gnawty.)
	MATCH-KONG:  red balloon

  * Low off-screen barrel cannon in the second barrel cannon sequence
    past the continue barrel.  (From the last of the three barrel
    cannons, blast low sideways at the lone banana, instead of trying to
    blast high to land on the platform.)
	BLAST-UP:  top off-screen prize:  only [N] in the center.


- Forest Frenzy

  * Barely visible barrel cannon at bottom edge of screen when hanging
    on a moving rope.  It's early in the dodging-flying-"Necky"s part
    that's shortly before the end of the whole level.
	FIND:  Rambi icon

  * Last left-hand wall before exit.  (There is a barrel that can be
    used to open the wall, available at the extreme left end of this
    same chunk of land.)
	LEVEL:  Enguarde icon

  [Thanks to: "Big Bad Harvey" <wnl100@psu.edu> for help with one bonus room]


- Temple Tempest

  * Right-hand wall after the first pit.  The first millstone will stop
    covering this entry.  (The millstone can be made to vanish if it is
    in the way, by walking to the right until its clicking sound stops.
    Upon returning to the left, the millstone will be gone.)
	LEVEL:  Expresso crate

  * Low off-screen barrel cannon - straight down off the middle of
    three ropes.  Just past the continue barrel and before the hidden
    [N], there's a downward-pointing arrow made of bananas marking it.
	JUMP:  one blue "Klaptrap" for Rambi icon


- Orang-utan Gang

  * Open off-screen doorway under the vine where the level begins.
    (Use Expresso to fly left from the low-lying land level where the
    first DK barrel is found.)
	SPELL:  "WINKY" for Winky icon, then "RAMBI" for Rambi icon,
	then "ENGUARDE" for Enguarde icon, then "EXPRESSO" for Expresso
	icon.

  * Right-hand wall under vines past the [N] icon.  (Use Expresso to fly
    to the right from [N], under vines.  At the rightmost point, there
    is a cliff-side with the hidden door, and a barrel which can be used
    to open it.)
	LEVEL:  bounce off of tire to reveal DK barrel

  * Left-hand wall in a small pit, under the last vine before the exit.
	LEVEL:  bounce off of tire to reveal only bunches of bananas

  * Right-hand wall past the small pit with the entry for the previous
    bonus room, just before the cliff that ends under the last vine
    before the exit.
	LEVEL:  bounce off of tire to reveal [G]

  * Right-hand wall immediately before red arrow signpost.  (The barrel
    just before the last vine can be used to open every one of the final
    three exits.  They are all in the same area, and the barrel returns
    after going through a bonus room.)
	LEVEL:  Expresso crate and red balloon

  [Thanks to: "Big Bad Harvey" <wnl100@psu.edu> for help with one bonus room]


- Clam City

  <None>


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		BR-4.  Gorilla Glacier bonus rooms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Snow Barrel Blast

  * High off-screen barrel cannon directly above entrance.  (Stand on 
    the entrance and bounce off the slow "Necky" when he gets near.)
	FIND:  Winky icon

  * Low off-screen barrel cannon in the pit a short ways left of the
    continue barrel.  (Watch carefully:  an earlier barrel cannon will
    blast the player past this area and onto the continue barrel -- it
    is necessary to backtrack from that point.)
	BLAST-UP:  top off-screen prize:  only [O] in the center.

  * Low off-screen barrel cannon on ledge, below the barrel cannon with
    three bananas and a yellow "Zinger" -- the last one before the land
    area with the Rambi icon.  (Blast down from the "Zinger" barrel
    cannon, and head to the right, along the ledges.)   On the way to
    the bonus room, the player is blasted through the [N], picking it
    up automatically.
	BLAST-SIDEWAYS:  only bananas


- Slip Slide Ride

  * Left-hand wall at top of the very first blue up-rope nearest the
    entrance.  (Have Diddy bounce off a "Kritter" to reach the rope.)
	MATCH-KONG:  red balloon

  * Left-hand wall at bottom of first red down-rope.  (There's a barrel
    halfway along the down-rope, in a small alcove on the right.)
	SPELL:  "NINTENDO" for red balloon

  * Visible barrel cannon at top of a blue up-rope.  It's the third rope
    in the group of four that are found a short distance past the
    continue barrel.
	LEVEL:  Expresso icon


- Ice Age Alley

  * High off-screen barrel cannon on a ledge;  follows a string of
    "Necky"s which sit beyond the landing point from the first set of
    ropes.  When continuing along the ground level, it is possible to
    see the bottom of the barrel cannon's ledge when passing under it.
    (Use Diddy to bounce off the "Necky"s and over to the barrel cannon.
    It is also possible to get there with Expresso, but necessary to
    dismount him in mid-air in order to get onto the ledge.)
	LEVEL:  Expresso icon, Expresso crate

  * High off-screen barrel cannon on a ledge;  the ledge is above the
    series of downward ledges with "Klaptraps" that follow the peak
    with a steel barrel.  When jumping down the "Klaptrap" ledges as
    usual, it is possible to see the bottom of the barrel cannon's
    ledge when passing under it.  (With Expresso, fly to the right from
    the very top of the steel barrel peak.)
	MATCH:  red, green, or blue balloon


- Croctopus Chase

  <None>


- Torchlight Trouble

  * Right-hand wall just past the continue barrel.  (There is a barrel 
    that can be used to open the wall, sitting directly on top of the
    wall with the hidden door.)
	BLAST-AROUND:  Expresso icon  (Expresso crate at bonus room exit)

  * Left-hand wall just before the exit.
	JUMP:  one blue "Klaptrap" for Rambi icon;  the [G] icon is
	also in the room.


- Rope Bridge Rumble

  * Visible barrel cannon in center of the second pit.
	LEVEL:  Winky crate

  * Off-screen barrel cannon above the second tire beyond the red arrow
    signpost.  It is marked by a single banana at the very top of the
    screen.
	MATCH:  Rambi, Enguarde, Winky, and Expresso icons


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		BR-5.  Kremroc Industries, Inc. bonus rooms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Oil Drum Alley

  * Off-screen barrel cannon under the first flaming oil drum.  (Blow up
    the drum with the TNT barrel that is available by jumping off the
    rope very near the entrance.)
	BLAST-UP:  top off-screen prize:  only a red balloon in the
	center.

  * First left-hand wall after the [K], a very tall wall.  (Open the
    door with the barrel that is available from jumping down off the
    top of the tall wall.)
	MATCH:  banana, bunch of bananas, Winky icon, red balloon

  * Right-hand wall of the previous bonus level.  (Match the single
    banana in that bonus level, to get a barrel which can be used for
    breaking the wall.  Have Diddy carry the barrel and jump against
    the wall.)
	SPELL:  "DONKEY" for red balloon, then "KONG" for green
	balloon, then "COUNTRY" for blue balloon.

  * Right-hand wall of the pit under the first mid-air flaming oil drum.
    It is shortly after the second "Manky Kong" following the continue
    barrel.  (Manky Kong has a useable barrel sitting behind him on his
    platform... which is useful for opening the area if the player does
    not have Rambi.)
	BLAST-SIDEWAYS:  [N]


- Trick Track Trek

  * Visible barrel cannon under the wooden ramp at the midpoint, just
    before the continue barrel.  (Use Diddy and cartwheel-jump from
    the left as the first-half moving platform falls away.)
	LEVEL:  only bananas

  * Visible barrel cannon up beside a platform with two "Gnawty"s.
    The platform is about halfway between continue barrel and end.
    (Jump to the "Gnawty" platform while the moving platform is still
    left of it and on a higher section of track;  then jump from there
    to the barrel cannon.)
	JUMP:  one purple "Klaptrap" for red balloon

  * Off-screen barrel cannon below the Manky Kong on the exit platform.
    (Once he is killed, just walk past where he was sitting -- off the
    edge to the right -- without jumping up to the level of the exit.)
	MATCH:  red, green, and blue balloons


- Elevator Antics

  * Off-screen open door, reached via the first rope that is just to
    the right of the entrance.  (Use Diddy to jump left from the second
    rope, which can be reached from the ground.  The second rope moves
    slowly back and forth a short distance -- jump when it is at its
    leftmost point.)
	MATCH-KONG:  red balloon

  * Off-screen open door in a hidden off-screen hallway, up and to the
    right of a three-rope segment with one ascending/descending "Zinger"
    along each rope.  It's the next-to-last multi-rope segment before
    the continue barrel.  (Jump up and to the right from the top of the
    third rope -- landing on an off-screen ledge.  Continue to the
    right while off-screen, to get to the bonus room.)
	BLAST-SIDEWAYS:  [O], Expresso icon, green balloon

  * Off-screen open door, reached via the last "elevator" before the
    exit.  (Stay on the elevator and ride it down below the level
    of the exit.  Jump off into a small alcove on the right-hand side.)
	BLAST-UP:  only bananas


- Poison Pond

  <None>


- Mine Cart Madness

  * High off-screen barrel cannon at gap in bananas on upper track.
    (Reach the mine car on this high track via the rope.)  It's
    shortly before continue barrel, I think.
	LEVEL:  Rambi icon, red balloon

  * Visible barrel cannon just past the big downhill which follows the
    [N] icon.  (Jump from the mine car while it's still up the hill a
    ways, to reach a mid-air tire;  bounce to the barrel cannon.)
	MATCH:  Rambi, Expresso, Enguarde, and Winky icons

  * Visible barrel cannon under the peak of the big hill immediately
    before the exit.  (Jump from the mine car on the downward part of
    the hill, or jump to the left from the exit platform, to reach any
    of three mid-air tires under the track;  bounce up and left to
    the upper-leftmost tire, and then to the barrel cannon.)
	LEVEL:  only bananas


- Blackout Basement

  * Low off-screen barrel cannon under the last falling platform -- the
    fourth of a group of four -- beyond the continue barrel.  It is
    marked with a low banana.  (Just stand in the center of the platform
    as it falls.)
	BLAST-AROUND:  [N]

  * Left-hand wall, the last one before the exit.  (Easiest way to get
    here: ride the steel barrel that appears upon exiting the first
    bonus room, and never get off.  The steel barrel will automatically
    bounce off the right-hand wall before the exit, open the opposite
    left-hand wall, and send the player into the bonus room.)
	FIND:  red balloon


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		BR-6.  Chimp Caverns bonus rooms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Tanked Up Trouble

  * Off-screen barrel cannon below the first vertical track section.
    (Avoid the first fuel can and stand in the middle of the moving
    platform as it runs out of fuel and falls off the track.)
	FIND:  red balloon


- Manic Mincers

  * Right-hand wall of a pit with a single "Krusha", shortly after the
    continue barrel.
	JUMP:  three blue "Klaptraps" for red balloon

  * Right-hand wall under a stacked pair of stationary mincers, which
    are just before the exit.  (It is possible to get a barrel to carry
    by going up and through a doorway shortly before the mincers.  I
    don't think the upper-doorway-to-get-the-barrel counts as a bonus
    room, but it acts like one in some ways -- for example, when
    "dying" in there, the player is returned to the level without
    losing a life.)
	FIND:  red balloon


- Misty Mine

  * Open off-screen door beside the bottom of a long rope.  The rope is
    just past the continue barrel, and its path crosses a DK barrel.
    (Climb down to near the bottom of the rope and wait until it stops
    moving.)
	LEVEL:  [K], [O], [N], [G], and Expresso crate

  * Right-hand wall near the end of the level -- the first right-hand
    wall beyond:  the Expresso icon, a tire jump over a high wall with
    a "Klaptrap" drum halfway up, and a TNT barrel.  (Carry the TNT
    barrel to the right, being careful to avoid enemies, over to the
    first right-hand wall.  Unlike some other levels, the drums won't
    spit out anything while the player is standing on them.)
	MATCH:  Rambi, Expresso, Enguarde, and Winky icons


- Loopy Lights

  * Off-screen barrel cannon in the first pit after the entrance.  The
    pit is marked with some bananas in a vertical row.
	BLAST-SIDEWAYS:  [K]

  * First right-hand wall after the coconut-throwing "Necky".  (Carry
    the barrel that is directly under "Necky", avoiding coconuts which
    could shatter it, down the steps to the right;  jump one pit, and
    avoid the one "Klaptrap" just in front of the wall.  Alternative:
    carry a DK barrel from earlier in the level, to kill the
    coconut-throwing "Necky" so that he can't destroy the barrel which
    you will use to open the wall.)
	LEVEL:  Expresso icon, [N]


- Platform Perils

  * Visible barrel cannon underneath the entry walkway.  (Once the
    moving platform has moved about its own length, jump from it to
    an off-screen moving platform that is directly under the starting
    position of the visible moving platform.)
	MATCH-KONG:  red-balloon

  * Off-screen barrel cannon underneath the exit walkway.  (Jump as
    far to the right as possible from one of the moving platforms that
    is near the exit and just below its level.  The lower walkway
    doesn't stick out to the left nearly as much as the exit walkway
    does.)
	FIND:  Enguarde icon

		BR-7.  General notes and strategy hints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Entries to all bonus rooms are:  (1) doorways -- either needing a
  barrel to break a wall to expose them, or ones which are already
  open but not visible because they aren't usually on the screen; and
  (2) barrel cannons, which may or may not be visible on the screen.

+ The skill of putting down a barrel (other than TNT, which explodes
  after a while when set down) is helpful because it lets enemies
  be dispatched without losing the barrel.  To set a barrel down:
  press and hold "down" on the control pad before releasing the Y
  button.

+ If it is necessary to carry a barrel (especially a TNT barrel) a
  long ways, it's easiest to go ahead and kill the enemies first,
  then backtrack and pick up the barrel.  (Providing that it is
  possible to backtrack in the level, of course.)  Then there are
  no worries about losing the barrel by touching an enemy while
  carrying it.

+ Since Diddy carries barrels low and in front of himself, they will
  automatically break when he brushes up against a breakable wall.
  When having trouble finding a breakable wall, go through the level
  once to kill off everything, and then backtrack and have Diddy
  carry a barrel around.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		BR-8.  Sample description interpretation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The description of the first "Ropey Rampage" bonus room reads in part:

	"* Low off-screen barrel cannon, just to the right of the tree
	   with [O].
		LEVEL:  [N]"

	This should be read as:

	The first bonus room is entered via a barrel cannon that's not
	visible because it's off the bottom of the screen.  It is
	immediately to the right of the tree where the golden letter
	"O" icon is found.

	The type of bonus room is a "LEVEL" (see Section 9 for a
	description of different kinds of bonus games and the names
	I've assigned to them).  This bonus room contains the golden
	letter "N" icon.  

	It also probably contains some bananas -- but bananas are so
	easy to find, they are present in so many of the bonus rooms,
	and they are worth so little... that they aren't mentioned
	specifically in this list.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		BR-9.  Kinds of bonus rooms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

BLAST-AROUND - four or eight rotating barrel cannons in a square (if
        there are four, they are arranged as the corners of the square;
	if there are eight, they are arranged as a tic-tac-toe board
	excluding the center square).  There are various objects in
	between that can be picked up by blasting from barrel cannon to
	barrel cannon.  (There may be an exit platform in the bottom
	right-hand corner of the room, which may also have something
	useful to pick up.)

	There are three BLAST-AROUND bonus rooms, one of which has
	an Expresso crate on the exit platform.  Two of the three
	have something other than bananas to collect.


BLAST-SIDEWAYS - a horizontal line of barrel cannons that blast
	left-to-right, with various things in between that can be
	picked up.  For those barrels which don't rotate when the player
	is in them, it is possible to zip through the levels collecting
	everything, by quickly and constantly tapping the "B" button.

	There are six BLAST-SIDEWAYS bonus rooms, five of which have
	something more significant than bananas to collect.  (One
	has a letter icon, an animal icon, AND a green balloon -- but
	it is a very tricky one where the barrel cannons rotate very
	quickly.)


BLAST-UP - starts with the player in a barrel cannon at the bottom of
	the screen;  the barrel cannon may be sliding back and forth,
	or spinning, or both.  There are bananas on the screen, and up
	to three hidden objects just off the top of the screen (left,
	center, right).  These objects can be reached by blasting
	straight up (when the barrel cannon is at the left, center, or
	right).

	It isn't always possible get all three top items -- only one
	at a time can be collected, and the player must fall back into
	the barrel cannon or the bonus level is over.

	In some of these rooms, the control pad does not affect the
	player's flight at all, and in others you can only move a
	little left or right on the way back down.  Generally, only
	blasting up in the center allows the player to easily return
	to the barrel to try again.

	There are eight BLAST-UP bonus rooms.  In most cases, the
	most desirable top object (if any) is in the center, so that
	is the way to go.  (In the few cases where the desired object
	is to the left or right, you'll see where it is on the first
	try, and usually be able to collect it on the second.)


FIND  - an object flashes among four barrels; once it stops flashing
	around and vanishes, pick the barrel in which it last appeared
	(by jumping up to touch that barrel).  Upon guessing correctly,
	the object is awarded to the player.

	For those "FIND" rooms which award balloons, I find it easier
	to watch the white "string" at the bottom of the balloon, than
	to try to watch the balloon itself.  In many cases, the contrast
	between the string and bonus room background is greater than the
	contrast between the balloon and barrel.

	There are eight "FIND" bonus rooms.  Four award red balloons,
	and the remaining four each give a different reward:  a green
	balloon, a Rambi icon, a Winky icon, and an Enguarde icon.


LEVEL - a mini-level (generally not-reused for any other bonus rooms)
	in which there are various things to collect.

	There are 20 bonus rooms which have been designated of type
	"LEVEL", but as a group they do not really have much in
	common.  This is really a catch-all label for those bonus rooms
	which do not match any of the eight other common types.


JUMP  - bounce on one or more "Klaptrap"s (the mini-alligators with
	big mouths).  They spit up bananas when hit, and also move
	more quickly after each hit.  The bunches of bananas stay on
	the screen for only a few seconds, then disappear.

	The first bunch PICKED UP will be worth one banana, the second
	worth two, and so on.  The object of the bonus game is to pick
	up ten bunches (the last being worth ten bananas), at which
	point the "Klaptrap"(s) vanish.  Then the player is rewarded
	with something more significant.

	There are five "JUMP" bonus rooms.  Three of them give red
	balloons for completing the game, and the other two award
	Rambi icons.


MATCH - objects flash on three barrels in a rotating sequence (e.g., 
	banana, bunch of bananas, banana, Winky icon, banana, red
	balloon, [repeat]).  Each barrel freezes on what it is
	displaying when touched by jumping up against it.  If all three
	barrels are frozen displaying the same object, that object is
	awarded to the player.

	There are eight "MATCH" bonus rooms.  Four match any animal
	icon (Enguarde, Expresso, Rambi, Winky).  Two match red,
	green, or blue balloons (one, two, or three extra lives).
	The two others match a single banana, a bunch of bananas, a
	Winky icon, or a red balloon.


MATCH-KONG - similar to MATCH, except there are four barrels and the
	rotation is [K]-[O]-[N]-[G]-banana.  The object of the bonus
	game is to spell "KONG" across the four barrels.

	There are four "MATCH-KONG" bonus rooms.  All four award a
	red balloon for winning the game.


SPELL - jump and hit the flashing letter from among several letters
	that are flying around in a circle;  the sequence of letters
	spells a word.  If the letters are hit in order without error,
	a reward is given (which may be related to the word).

	There are five "SPELL" bonus rooms, each with a different
	reward.  Three of the rooms play the spell game for only a
	single word and a single reward (Enguarde icon, Expresso icon,
	red balloon).  Of the other two, one gives the player up to
	three words for each of the three colors of balloon (though
	any error in any word terminates the level), and the other
	gives four words for each of the four animal icons.

    the top of the hill;  bounce off the movable tire onto the extreme
    left-hand edge of the hilltop to expose Enguarde.)

  * Hidden "DK" barrel on the right-hand side of the second big hill.
    (You need either Expresso or exit from first bonus room to get to
    the top of the hill;  bounce off the movable tire onto the extreme

- Croctopus Chase

  * [O] is in a hidden room through the right-hand wall just beyond the
    first set of barrel cannons.  (After exiting the cannons, move through
    the right-hand wall below and right of the cannons.  Go up and over
    to the left to collect a "DK" barrel and the [O].)

  * Enguarde icon in a hidden room near the top of the first vertical
    shaft beyond the continue barrel.  (Go through the left-hand wall
    just short of where the "Croctopus" stops at the top of the shaft.)

  * Winky icon at the bottom-right corner of a loop a short distance
    past the Enguarde icon.  (The third "Croctopus" after the continue
    barrel chases you to a four-way intersection and goes straight
    through it.  You should go up, let the "Croctopus" pass, and follow
    him to the right and down to collect the Winky icon.)

  * Enguarde crate and a red balloon in a hidden room in the tunnel
    off of the area where the first "Croctopus" past [N] chases you.
    (Near the top of the third vertical shaft after the [N], go
    through the left-hand wall;  you'll enter a hidden room with a red
    balloon in the top center, and the Enguarde crate at the lower
    left.)

  * [N] is in the last bonus room.

  * Hidden [G] shortly before the exit.  (Jump down and to the right off
    the big oil drum that's at the extreme left-hand edge of the
    platform with the exit, to expose it.)


- Trick Track Trek

  * Off-screen Winky icon on the right-hand side of the platform that is
    beside the barrel cannon which leads to the third bonus room.


- Elevator Antics

  * [O] is in the second bonus room.

  * A visible Expresso icon is also in the second bonus room.

  * [N] is on a ledge way down off the screen, against the left-hand
    wall of the second set of elevators past the continue barrel.
    (From the continue barrel, pass the first pair of elevators to
    get to a steel barrel on a small land area.  Walk off the right-hand
    end of this land area and fall against the left-hand wall of the
    pit, to land down on the [N]'s ledge.)


- Poison Pond

  * Enguarde crate in a hidden room that is just left of the entrance.
    (Go through the left-hand wall from the starting position, to
    enter the hidden room and pick up Enguarde.)

  * A second Enguarde at the extreme right-hand edge of the area that is
    directly to the right of the continue barrel.  (From the continue
    barrel, head right past two mincers, then continue to the right where
    a trail of bananas heads upwards.  Head downwards shortly afterwards,
    under two mincers, and then upwards to the Enguarde crate.)
 
  * Rambi icon in a hidden room in the second half of the level.  (From
    the continue barrel, pass two vertically moving mincers then head
    upwards.  Pass one horizontally-moving mincer in a horizontal shaft,
    then head upwards.  At the top of a vertical shaft, there is a "room"
    with three mincers rotating in a big circle.  The top center of this
    room has a fake wall which permits entry to the hidden room with the
    Rambi icon.)


- Mine Cart Madness

  * Visible Rambi icon in the first bonus room.

  * Off-screen Enguarde icon on a low track.  Immediately after passing
    the [O] icon, do not jump out of the cart at the next break in the
    track.  The cart will fall down to a hidden track, and you'll go
    right through an Enguarde icon.


- Blackout Basement

  * Visible Enguarde icon at the bottom of the screen, under the highest
    of a set of three small platforms a distance past the [K].  (I don't
    know how to collect it without dying.)

  * [O] is hidden in the platform immediately before the continue barrel.
    (You can bounce high off the tire to the left of the platform, in
    order to land hard and expose the [O].)

  * [N] is in the first bonus room, which is below a set of four falling
    platforms most of the way to the end of the level.

  * There's a steel keg hidden in the floor on the last platform of the
    level (just past the first bonus room entrance), but it can only be
    exposed by exiting the first bonus room.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		OB-6.  Chimp Caverns hard-to-find or hidden objects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Tanked Up Trouble

  * Enguarde icon suspended high in mid-air just before the continue
    barrel.


- Manic Mincers

  * Rambi crate a short distance beyond the [K].

  * [G] is at the end of the level inside the open doorway a short
    distance before the exit.  (It's on the side of the hill which
    has a "DK" barrel and TNT barrel.)


- Misty Mine

  * Visible Rambi icon below a drum, about 1/4 of the way through
    the level.

  * [K], [O], [N], and [G] (all four) are located in the first bonus
    room of the level.

  * Visible Expresso crate at the end of the first bonus room of the
    level.

  * Visible Expresso icon near the exit of the first bonus room (on
    the second land area past the continue barrel).


- Loopy Lights

  * [K] is in the first bonus room (entered via a barrel cannon in a 
    pit a very short distance beyond the entrance) between the last
    pair of horizontally-blasting barrel cannons in the bonus room.

  * [N] is in the second bonus room, on the third platform that you
    can jump to in the dark.

  * Visible Expresso icon in the second bonus room on the next platform
    after the [N].


- Platform Perils

  * Off-screen Winky icon on the middle of three falling platforms 
    that are under a long platform between the [K] and [O].

    (From the [K]:  head to the right until you reach the second adjacent
    pair of short stable platforms, on a slightly different level from
    each other.  They are the fourth and fifth non-falling/moving
    platforms beyond [K].  To the right of this pair, there is a falling
    platform followed by a "Necky", and then a long stable platform with
    a barrel on its left-hand edge.
	Jump onto (or past) "Necky", but do not land on the platform
    with the barrel.  Instead, fall under its left-hand edge.  You'll
    land on a falling platform a short distance below.  Jump quickly to
    the right to the next falling platform, which is where the Winky
    icon is located;  and then jump to a third platform which will take
    you upwards, back onto the long stable platform above you.)
