OCF's Donkey Kong Country Game Genie Codes
by Orlando C. Fernando (ocfernan@mailbox.syr.edu)
SNES Version 2.0
Last Updated: 2/12/95
		
Codes have been tested under the 1 player mode.  Additional "safe" 
effects may be possible.  Question marks indicate possible other stages 
where the code may take effect.  Names in brackets indicate a bulleted 
commentary or "side note" from that person. "CPU Partner" refers to the 
Kong you are not controlling when you have two kongs on screen. These codes 
primarily work with the alternate (or some call "bad") version of the game 
since I have derived these codes on an alternate version (the explanation has 
been mentioned in the Galoob published codes for DKC, as well as from people 
over the INTERNET video game newsgroups).  Some codes MAY work on both 
versions, which you may want to investigate.  Can someone test these codes 
out on an original version and try to derive code equivalents if it is 
not compatible?  This is not one easy game to derive codes for, so take 
advantage of these codes as you struggle or enjoy this well-acclaimed 
platform game!


SINCE LAST VERSION (1.0):

	-29 new functional codes added (indicated by ! beside code).
	-new findings on Codes 39 and 51.
	-"barrel-riding" expression changed to "keg-riding".
	-codes definitely functioning with both game versions indicated by #.

		stops falling)

WARNING: When experimenting with new codes yourself, you should keep a 
good-standing game in the 2nd or 3rd save bank.  Some bad combinations I've 
tried in the past HAVE erased my 1st save bank!  :(  You were warned!
