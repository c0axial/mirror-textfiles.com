1)  A NOTE FROM KING KUNG
    Thank you for downloading King Kung's DKC FAQ! For those of you that
don't know, I, King Kung, was the author of an outrageous FF3 FAQ. With
my fellow creators, Wizard 201 and JonN2000, we made a FAQ that covered
the entire game of Final Fantasy 3! It was my first MAJOR FAQ, and I've
just now decided to start on this one. With hard work, toiling research,
and meticulous plotting, I've come up with a file that can help you when
you're stumped, yet can be downloaded for FREE!
    After I completed my FF3 FAQ, I sat down and started playing a new
game, Donkey Kong Country. Captivated by the awesome graphics and sound,
I played for hour upon hour, until I had finally discovered every bonus
room in the game. "I now know what I must do," I said. "I must make the
ultimate players guide for DKC!"
    Because of the hours of work that have been put into this file, it
should be known that I will not tollerate my FAQ being used without my
permission! In other words, you can't take any part from my FAQ and say
that you, or somebody else, wrote it! I will, however, allow you to give
this FAQ to anyone that you wish, as long as it is unaltered in any way.
Violators will be punished!
    This is the first version of this FAQ, and is available on AOL at
keyword: video games, in the Hints, Tips, and Tricks section. It will
also soon be available on other services. If you would like to upload it
to another site, please E-Mail me first for the latest version of this
file.
                        And remember:
"If you feel like vommiting, do it in a bag stupid!"

-----------------------------
3)  SPECIAL TECHNIQUES          
Both Donkey Kong and Diddy have special techniques. Some can be used by
both, while others work only for one of them.
ROLL:   By pressing Y, both Donkey Kong and Diddy can launch into a roll.
        During this roll, any enemies in their path will be killed! The
        more enemies you go through without stopping, the faster you go.
        Remember: some of the tougher enemies can't be defeated with this
        technique, and may have a defense that can inflict pain!
CARRY BARRELS:   When in front of a barrel, both Donkey Kong and Diddy
        can hoist and carry it by holding down Y. Do to Donkey Kong's
        strength, he can lift them high above his head, while weak little
        Diddy has to hold them out in front of him. DK's method protects
        from enemies above him, while Diddy's blocks frontal attacks. 
        Just because Diddy's method looks weaker doesn't mean it is less 
        useful. He can uncover many hidden areas by carrying barrels up 
        to walls!
THROW BARRELS:   While holding a barrel, either Kong can release the Y
        button to throw it. Steel-rimmed barrels will kill any enemies in
        their path, while regular ones are good for use only. If a barrel
        (other than the steel keg) hits a wall, it will break. To drop a
        barrel without breaking it, press down and Y. DK can do this to
        uncover hidden areas in walls! Remember: DK can throw barrels
        farther than Diddy.
BOUNCING:   When either Kong lands on an enemy, they can hold down the B
        button to bounce even higher! This technique also applies when
        land on a patch of ground that is hiding an item. By landing from
        a high jump, you can uncover items, such as bananas and tires!
MID-AIR JUMP:   Both Kongs can roll off of a cliff, and jump in mid-air!
        This can be used to reach out-of-the-way items and areas. Be sure
        to jump before you fall out of roll stance.
RIDING KEGS:   After throwing a steel keg into a wall, you can jump on
        it to ride through several enemies. Press down and Y to pick it
        up before you fall into a pit!
GROUND SLAP:   As DK, you can slap the ground by holding down and Y. This
        will kill most enemies, leaving behind a banana to add to your
        hoard! Slapping in certain places has the same effect as landing
        from a high jump, uncovering hidden items. If you want to uncover
        everything, use this move!
STRENGTH:   DK's strength puts him at an advantage in certain areas. He
        is heavy and strong, allowing him to throw barrels farther and
        defeat most enemies in a single stomp!
SPEED:   Although Diddy is smaller than DK, this puts him at an advantage
        speed-wise. He can run faster, jump higher, and roll farther than
        DK. His small stature also lets him slip easily between enemies,
        making him the best of the two to use in water areas.
-----------------------------
4) CHARACTERS
THE GOOD GUYS (Yay!)
Donkey Kong: The star of this game, Donkey Kong is the son of the first
        video game ape. Angered over the disapearance of his bananas,
        he has set out to fight the Kremlings and find his hoard! His
        size will make the evil critters run to safety!
Diddy Kong: The other star, he's a DK wanabe. He'll do anything to be
        like DK, and follows the big ape wherever he goes. Perhaps he'll
        be the next generation of the DK family?
Funky Kong: The Valley Gorilla <G> of the Kong family, he runs his own
        flying service: Barrel Flights! When you find him, you'll be able
        to visit areas that you've already beaten. Despite his gorilla
        stature, he'd rather get a tan than go out on an adventure!
Candy Kong: The beautiful Candy Kong is the love of DK's life. While
        DK won't admit it to anyone, he'd love to marry her, just not
        yet. She has a stand in every area of the game in which you may
        save your game. Do this at every oppurtunity, otherwise you'll
        have to repeat areas that you've beaten!
Cranky Kong: The grouchy monarch of the Kong family, he was the original
        Donkey Kong, back in the early days of video games. He often talks
        about how gaming was in his day, and can get on everyone's nerves.
        However, he also knows a lot about the world of DK Country, and
        can clue you in on secrets.
THE BAD GUYS (boo, hiss!)
Kritter: This is the average Kremling drone. While they aren't powerful,
        the more evolved ones pose a threat.
Klump:  Stronger than the Kritter, his hat protects him from Diddy's jump
        attack.
Krusha: These powerful Kremling's will shake off most attacks, and some
        can only be killed by barrels!
Rock Kroc: Taking the form of a rock while the light reads Stop, beware
        of there sneaky attack!
Klap Trap: Its giant teeth will injure you if you roll into it.
Slippa: A snake that is easy to dispatch, and hides in crevices.
Necky:  A flying vulture that sometimes throws coconuts at you.
Mini-necky: The baby Neckys can spit out coconuts!
Army:   This strong armadillo rolls up into a ball to attack you.
Zinger: This bee's spikes should be avoided without Winky.
Manky Kong: The DK rejects, these orangutangs like to throw barrels.
Fishy:  A simple fish. Easy work for Enguarde.
Chomps: Avoid these sharks without the help of Enguarde.
Chomps Jr: A miny version of Chomps.
Squidge: A jellyfish that likes to block your progress.
Clambo: An invincible clam that spits out pearls.
Croctopus: An Octopus that chases you when underwater.
King K. Rool: The commander of the evil Kremlings.
-----------------------------
5) ITEMS
Bananas: These are what you need to find! Collect 100 for an extra life.
Banana Bunches: Worth multiple bananas.
K-O-N-G Letters: Spell KONG in a level for an extra life.
Balloons: Worth extra lives. Filled with helium, they float upwards fast.
        Red ballons yield 1 life, green ones 2, and the rare blue ones
        give you 3 lives.
Animal Tokens: Collect three of each icon to go to an animal bonus round!
Barrels: The many barrels can be used as weapons or for transportation.
        Regular barrels break when thrown, while steel-rimmed ones roll
        through enemies. Jump into floating barrels and press B to shoot
        out. Floating ones with a blast symbol are automatic, and some
        take you to a bonus area. Star barrels work as half-way marks.
        Use the steel keg to wipe out hoards of baddies. TNT can be used
        to open up doors and kill enemies. Use it to destroy Oil Barrels.
Lifts:  Once jumped on, these continue along a set track. If there's a
        light in the middle of it, you must find fuel to keep it moving.
Fuel:   Grab these cans of fuel to keep certain lifts moving.
-----------------------------
6) TYPES OF BONUS AREAS
Blast-around: Four or eight rotating barrels in a square (if there are
        four, they are arranged as the corners of the square; if there
        are eight, they are arranged as a tic-tac-toe board excluding
        the center square). There are various objects in between that
        can be picked up by blasting from barrel to barrel. You may exit
        using the lower-right platform, which may have a prize on it.
Blast-sideways: A horizontal string of barrels that blast left-to-right,
        with various things in between that can be picked up.  For those
        barrels which don't rotate when the player is in them, you can
        zip through the level collecting everything by quickly pressing 
        the B button.
Blast-up: Sarts with the player in a barrel at the bottom of the
        screen; the barrel may be sliding back and forth, or spinning, or 
        both. There are bananas on the screen, and up to three hidden 
        objects just off the top of the screen (left, center, right). 
        These objects can be reached by blasting straight up (when the 
        barrel is at the left, center, or right). Keep in mind that you
        won't always be able to get every item in the area.
Memory: An object flashes among four barrels; once it stops flashing
        around and vanishes, pick the barrel in which it last appeared
        (by jumping up to touch that barrel). Upon guessing correctly,
        the object is awarded to the player.
Level:  A mini-level (generally not-reused for any other bonus rooms)
        in which there are various things to collect.
Bounce: Bounce on one or more Klap Traps (the mini-alligators with big 
        mouths). They spit up bananas when hit, and also move faster after

        each hit. The bunches of bananas stay on the screen for only a few

        seconds, then disappear. The first bunch picked up will be worth 
        one banana, the second worth two, and so on.  The object of the 
        bonus game is to pick up ten bunches (the last being worth ten 
        bananas), at which point the Klaptrap(s) vanish. Then the player 
        is rewarded with something more significant.
Match:  Objects flash on three barrels in a rotating sequence (e.g., 
        banana, bunch of bananas, banana, Winky icon, banana, red balloon,

        [repeat]). Each barrel freezes on what it is displaying when 
        touched by jumping up against it. If all three barrels are frozen 
        displaying the same object, that object is awarded to the player.
Match-KONG: Similar to Match, except there are four barrels and the 
        rotation is [K]-[O]-[N]-[G]-banana. The object of the bonus game 
        is to spell "KONG" across the four barrels.
Spell:  Jump and hit the flashing letter from among several letters that 
        are flying around in a circle; the sequence of letters spell a 
        word. If the letters are hit in order without error, a reward is 
        given (which may be related to the word).

7) Level Secrets and  Bonus Area Locations
                 KONGO JUNGLE AREAS
Jungle Hijinks
    From the beginning, jump back up and re-enter the house to find an
extra life. Jump back to the right and onto a tree, then, instead of going
down where the arrow points, to a mid-air jump far to the left. Keep goint
to the left with mid-air jumps to collect a ton of extra lives! Go back to
the right, fighting your way allong. Be sure to get Rambi, then make your
way through the rest of the level (don't forget the bonus areas). Before
you go through the exit, take Rambi above it, and go as far right as you
possibly can. Jump straight up, and press A in mid-air. You should land on
a tire. Bounce on it to collect 5 lives, then exit the level!
1.  First right-hand wall after opening the Rambi crate.
        Prize: Red Ballon
2.  Right-hand wall in the pit under the tree with [G]. It's to the right
    of the first bonus room's exit.
        Match: 3 Rambi, Expresso, Winky, Enguarde icons

Ropey Rampage
     Climb on top of the entrance, and jump over to the right. You should
land on a tree. To a mid-air jump to the right, and you should find some
bananans. Continue right, and climb the rope. There are a lot of bananas
that can be found in this level with DK's Ground Slap, so use it often.
At the end, jump onto the exit and work your way back left on the trees.
You'll find a hoard of bananas.
1.  Low off-screen barrel cannon, just to the right of the tree with
    [O]. Walk to the right off of the [O] tree, fall straight down
    into the barrel.
        Prize:  [N]
2.  Low off-screen barrel cannon, just left of the red arrow signpost.
    Fall into the pit just before the red arrow sign.
        Memory:  red balloon

Reptile Rumble
    Other than bonus areas, this level only has banana hoards that can be
found with DK's Ground Slap. Move the first tire you find back to the
beginning of the stage. Use it to bounce over the entrance for a Rambi
icon. Be careful not to lose barrels by getting hit, as this may keep you 
from finding every bonus area in one try.
1.  Right-hand wall, immediately below [K].
        Prize:  red balloon
2.  Visible barrel cannon above and left of a "DK" barrel on a hill,
    between [K] and [O]. The barrel cannon is only visible when
    standing on the hill. There is a second similar hill after the
    continue barrel, which does not have a barrel cannon nearby.
        Prize:  only bananas
3.  Right-hand wall of two-snake pit, just past continue barrel and [N].
        Prize:  only bananas

Coral Capers
    When you see an arrow of bananas near the beginning, follow it to
rescue Enguarde. At the half-way mark, go up to collect a letter and some
bananas. You'll pass another Enguarde box, which you should leave alone.
Next, go up a corridor with sharks every so often. Test the right walls
for hidden passageways. You should be able to get through the rest pretty
easily.
  <No Bonus Areas>

Barrel Cannon Canyon
    From the beginning, you can bypass the entire first half of the stage
by going above the entrance and jumping straight up. You can do this again
  
when you reach a blast-up barrel surrounded by 2 Kritters. Bounce of the
left Kritter's head to land on the palm tree to the left, then jump up.
1.  Hidden doorway on the cliff-side just past [O]. It is not possible to 
    get there carrying a barrel. It is necessary to blast straight into 
    the cliff-side - intentionally missing the moving "connecting" barrel 
    - immediately after collecting the [O] icon.
        Blast-sideways:  DK barrel and red balloon
2.  Right-hand wall of the pit that is between the 2nd and 3rd purple
    Kritters after the continue barrel.
        Blast-up:  top off-screen prizes: Enguarde icon on the left,
        red balloon in the center, and a bunch of bananas on the right.

Boss: Very Gnawty
    This boss should be a cinch! Just jump on his head 4-5 times.
                 
                 
                 MONKEY MINES AREAS
Winky's Walkway
    Make sure that you pick up Winky near the half-way mark. Bounce off
of a few heads to reach his crate. Remember that Winky can jump on the
Zingers, making it easy to get by them.
1.  Visible barrel cannon above Necky, just after continue barrel.
        Prize:  [N]

Mine Cart Carnage
    This can be a very tricky stage. While the first half isn't very hard,
The secon one's a doozy! Just be sure to jump at the very last moment, and
a little earlier if there's a mine cart in front of you. You'll halve to
jump a little earlier to get the red balloon and the [N].
  <No Bonus Areas>

Bouncy Bonanza
    Be sure to carry a barrel with you. Remember: DK barrels can also
be used to open up hidden levels. You should use the tire before the half-
way point to take the upper of two routes. Don't miss the cave where the
two routes join that contains Winky!
1.  Right-hand wall of the pit under a pair of Zingers, between the [K]
    and the [O].
        Match:  banana, bunch of bananas, Winky icon, red balloon
2.  Visible overhead barrel cannon, above the moving platform that is
    between [G] and exit.
        Blast-up:  only bananas

Stop & Go Station
    If you're in a hury to get out of this level fast, simply walk back
through the entrance to end up near the exit! Otherwise, when you hit the
stop and go barrels, be sure to hurry to the right as fast as possible.
1.  First right-hand wall after continue barrel.  It's a short distance
    past the steel-rim barrel that can be picked up.
        Blast-around:  only bananas
2.  High off-screen barrel cannon at left-most position the first movable
    tire can reach (the left edge of a wide, shallow pit with three
    Klaptraps). The path up to the barrel is marked with three
    bananas in a vertical line.
        Blast-up:  top off-screen prizes: bunch of bananas on the left
        and in the center, and Enguarde icon on the right.

Millstone Mayhem
    This level can be difficult to pass. Just be patient.
1.  High off-screen barrel cannon above the entrance door. Use the tire 
    to bounce up on top of the entrance, then jump upwards from there.
        Blast-up:  top off-screen prizes: DK barrel on the left,
        bunch of bananas in the center, and [K] on the right.
2.  Visible barrel cannon over 3rd beaver wheel. Get the movable tire
    between the first and second wheels  by using the barrel cannon
    hidden in the pit to knock out the tire from the spot to its
    right.
        Spell:  RARE for Enguarde icon
3.  Right-hand wall below the fifth millstone.
        Memory:  green balloon

BOSS: Master Necky
    To finish this boss off, bounce over the nut he spits out, then bounce
again onto his head. Do this 4-5 times to defeat him.


                 VINE VALLEY AREAS
Vulture Culture
    The game begins to get a little bit more difficult.
1.  High off-screen barrel cannon at the right edge of the land area
    with a coconut-thrower sitting on a movable tire. The path up
    to the barrel is marked with three bananas in a vertical line.
        Spell:  KONG for Expresso icon
2.  Left-hand wall in the land area that is just past a sequence with
    a barrel cannon and two Neckys; before the continue barrel.
        Bounce:  2 blue Klaptraps for red balloon
3.  Left-hand wall beside a single coconut-thrower on stair-step hill.
        Blast-sideways:  DK barrel, red balloon

Tree Top Town
    Be ready for a lot of barrel blasting in this stage. Remember: lone
bananas in awkward places can mean something.
1.  Visible barrel cannon up and left of entrance. Reach it by bouncing
    off of a Gnawty or Necky.
        Match-KONG:  red balloon
2.  Low off-screen barrel cannon in the second barrel sequence after the
    continue barrel. From the last of the three barrels, blast low
    sideways at the lone banana, instead of trying to blast high to land 
    on the platform.
        Blast-up:  top off-screen prize: only [N] in the center.

Forest Frenzy
    At where the first bonus area is located, you can continually bounce
on Neckys. After bagging 8 of them, you'll start earning extra lives!
1.  Barely visible barrel cannon at bottom edge of screen when hanging
    on a moving rope. It's early in the dodging-flying-Neckys part that's 
    shortly before the end of the whole level.
        Memory:  Rambi icon
2.  Last left-hand wall before exit. There is a barrel available at the 
    extreme left end of this same chunk of land.
        Prize:  Enguarde icon

Temple Tempest
    Reminicent of Millstone Mayhem, the hidden areas are once again
difficult to find. Finding Expresso is helpful, as you can simply glide
over most of the hazards.
1.  Right-hand wall after the first pit. The first wheel will stop
    covering this entry. The wheel can be made to vanish if it is in 
    the way, by walking to the right until its clicking sound stops.
    Upon returning to the left, the wheel will be gone.
        Prize:  Expresso crate
2.  Low off-screen barrel cannon - straight down off the middle of
    three ropes. Just past the continue barrel and before the hidden
    [N], there's a downward-pointing arrow made of bananas marking it.
        Bounce:  one blue Klaptrap for Rambi icon

Orang-utan Gang
    From the beginning, walk to the left, pick up the steel keg, and throw
it against the wall. You can ride it through most of the first half. When
you find Expresso, be sure to go all the way back right to find the first
bonus area.
1.  Open off-screen doorway under the vine where the level begins.
    Use Expresso to fly left from the low-lying land level where the
    first DK barrel is found.
        Spell:  WINKY for Winky icon, then RAMBI for Rambi icon,
        then ENGUARDE for Enguarde icon, then EXPRESSO for Expresso
        icon.
2.  Right-hand wall under vines past the [N] icon. Use Expresso to fly
    to the right from [N], under vines. At the rightmost point, there
    is a cliff-side with the hidden door, and a barrel which can be used
    to open it.
        Prize:  bounce off of tire to reveal DK barrel
3.  Left-hand wall in a small pit, under the last vine before the exit.
        Prize:  bounce off of tire to reveal only bunches of bananas
4.  Right-hand wall past the small pit with the entry for the previous
    bonus room, just before the cliff that ends under the last vine
    before the exit.
        Prize:  bounce off of tire to reveal [G]
5.  Right-hand wall immediately before red arrow signpost. The barrel
    just before the last vine can be used to open every one of the final
    three exits. They are all in the same area, and the barrel returns
    after going through a bonus area.
        Prize:  Expresso crate and red balloon

Clam City
    Be sure to search the walls for hidden rooms, especially near the
start. After being shot through a few barrels, there's another hidden room
to be found. Be careful about dodging the pearls that the clams shoot.
  <No Bonus Areas>

BOSS: Queen Bee
    When you hit the Queen Bee with a barrel, she'll turn read. Avoid
her during this time, as she is invincible to attacks. When she turns
yellow again, throw another barrel. Repeat until she dies.

I can answer your gaming questions!
                 GORILLA GLACIER AREAS
Snow Barrel Blast
    Shortly after the start, you'll see three Necky's flying. Bounce off
of each of them to reach an extra life. Be careful on the slippery 
terrain. One false step and you're history!
1.  High off-screen barrel cannon directly above entrance. Stand on the 
    entrance and bounce off the slow Necky when he gets near.
        Memory:  Winky icon
2.  Low off-screen barrel cannon in the pit a short ways left of the
    continue barrel. Watch carefully: another barrel will blast the player

    past this area and onto the continue barrel - it is necessary to 
    backtrack from that point.)
        Blast-up:  top off-screen prize: only [O] in the center.
3.  Low off-screen barrel cannon on ledge, below the barrel with three
    bananas and a yellow Zinger - the last one before the land area with 
    the Rambi icon. Blast down from the Zinger barrel, and head to the 
    right, along the ledges.  On the way to the bonus room, the player is 
    blasted through the [N], picking it up automatically.
        Blast-sideways:  only bananas

Slip Slide Ride
    This stage may take a little practice! Near the end, you'll reach two
ropes that both are too slipery to climb. So what are ya gonna do? :)
Try leaping back and forth between both of the ropes. You'll move upward!
This can also be done using one rope later in the area to get the [G].
1.  Left-hand wall at top of the very first blue up-rope nearest the
    entrance. Bounce off a Kritter to reach the rope.
        Match-KONG:  red balloon
2.  Left-hand wall at bottom of first red down-rope. There's a barrel
    halfway along the down-rope, in a small alcove on the right.
        Spell:  NINTENDO for red balloon
3.  Visible barrel cannon at top of a blue up-rope. It's the third rope
    in the group of four that are found a short distance past the
    continue barrel.
        Prize:  Expresso icon

Ice Age Alley
    From the start, go to the left (yeah, not right, left). Jump off the
cliff to find some bananas and Expresso. Use Expresso to reach the first
bonus area (you'll get him back). The most difficult part is keeping
Expresso from being damaged. If you can do this awesom feat, you can
reach the second bonus level!
1.  High off-screen barrel cannon on a ledge; follows a string of
    Neckys which sit beyond the landing point from the first set of
    ropes. When continuing along the ground level, it is possible to
    see the bottom of the barrel cannon's edge when passing under it.
    Bounce off the Neckys and over to the barrel. It is also possible 
    to get there with Expresso, but necessary to dismount him in mid-air 
    in order to land on the ledge.
        Prize:  Expresso icon, Expresso crate
2.  High off-screen barrel cannon on a ledge; the ledge is above the
    series of downward ledges with Klaptraps that follow the peak
    with a steel keg. When jumping down the Klaptrap ledges as
    usual, it is possible to see the bottom of the barrel's ledge when
    passing under it. With Expresso, fly to the right from the very
    top of the steel barrel peak.
        Match:  red, green, or blue balloon

Croctopus Chase
    Water! So, where's Enguarde? Unfortunately, you want find him until
near the end of the stage. When you see a crack in the left wall WAY after
the half-way point, enter for an extra life and Enguarde. The rest of the
stage should be a cinche.
  <No Bonus Areas>

Torchlight Trouble
    Don't miss Squawks the Parot near the beginning. With him to guide
you, this stage shouldn't be that difficult.
1.  Right-hand wall just past the continue barrel. There is a barrel 
    sitting directly on top of the wall with the hidden door.
        Blast-around:  Expresso icon, Expresso crate
2.  Left-hand wall just before the exit.
        Bounce:  one blue Klaptrap for Rambi icon; the [G] is also in the 
        room.

Rope Bridge Rumble
    Be sure to keep winky throughout the stage. He's helpful in dealing
with the many dangerous enemies.
1.  Visible barrel cannon in center of the second pit.
        Prize:  Winky crate
2.  Off-screen barrel cannon above the second tire beyond the red arrow
    signpost. It is marked by a single banana at the very top of the
    screen.
        Match:  Rambi, Enguarde, Winky, and Expresso icons

BOSS: Really Gnawty
    This is a variation of the first boss, Very Gnawty, only... THIS ONE
JUMPS! After you jump on it, dodge it's hopping attacks. It'll hop faster
after every succesive hit. No problem beating this bum!


                 KEMROC INDUSTRIES, INC. AREAS
Oil Drum Alley
    The third bonus area is probably one of the hardest to find in the 
game. Jump in the first pit after the half-way point to find Rambi. He
can help you find the remaining bonus and clear the level. When you
reach floating oil drums in pairs that flame on and off, wait until the
flame goes for a long time, then jump!
1.  Off-screen barrel cannon under the first flaming oil drum. Blow up
    the drum with the TNT barrel that is available by jumping off the
    rope very near the entrance.
        Blast-up:  top off-screen prizes: only a red balloon in the
        center.
2.  First left-hand wall after the [K], a very tall wall. Open the door 
    with the barrel that is available from jumping down off the top of the

    tall wall.
        Match:  banana, bunch of bananas, Winky icon, red balloon
3.  Right-hand wall of the previous bonus level. Match the single banana 
    in that bonus level to get a barrel which can be used for breaking 
    the wall. Have Diddy carry the barrel and jump against the wall.
        Spell:  DONKEY for red balloon, then KONG for green balloon, then 
        COUNTRY for blue balloon.
4.  Right-hand wall of the pit under the first mid-air flaming oil
    drum. It is shortly after the second Manky Kong following the
    continue barrel. He has a barrel on his platform, which can be
    used to open the area if the player does not have Rambi.
        Blast-sideways:  [N]


Trick Track Trek
    This is the first track lift area in the game. This has some tricky
bonus areas that may be easily missed. Remember that holding B when you
bounce on an enemy will give you the height you need to land back on the
platform.
1.  Visible barrel cannon under the wooden ramp at the midpoint, just
    before the continue barrel. Use Diddy and mid-air jump from the left 
    as the first-half moving platform falls away.
        Prize:  only bananas
2.  Visible barrel cannon up beside a platform with two Gnawtys. The 
    platform is about halfway between continue barrel and end. Jump to 
    the Gnawty platform while the moving platform is still left of it and 
    on a higher section of track, then jump from there to the barrel 
    cannon.
        Bounce:  one purple Klaptrap for red balloon
3.  Off-screen barrel cannon below the Manky Kong on the exit platform.
    Once he is killed, just walk past where he was sitting - off the 
    edge to the right - without jumping up to the level of the exit.
        Match:  red, green, and blue balloons

Elevator Antics
    Elevator go up, elevator go down! Your eyes will be crossed by the
end of this level! :) Some of the hidden areas are well hidden, so
try everything before you give up all hope.
1.  Off-screen open door, reached via the first rope that is just to
    the right of the entrance. Jump left from the second rope, which 
    can be reached from the ground. The second rope moves slowly back 
    and forth a short distance - jump when it is at its leftmost point.
        Match-KONG:  red balloon
2.  Off-screen open door in a hidden off-screen hallway, up and to the
    right of a three-rope segment with one ascending/descending Zinger
    along each rope. It's the next-to-last multi-rope segment before
    the continue barrel. Jump up and to the right from the top of the
    third rope - landing on an off-screen ledge. Continue to the
    right while off-screen, to get to the bonus room.
        Blast-sideways:  [O], Expresso icon, green balloon
3.  Off-screen open door, reached via the last "elevator" before the
    exit. Stay on the elevator and ride it down below the level of 
    the exit. Jump off into a small alcove on the right-hand side.
        Blast-up:  only bananas


Poison Pond
   Yet another water area! Use Diddy so that your hit range is smaller,
and, when you have to swim between several Chomps, hold down and tap
Y to move upwards slower.
  <No Bonus Areas>


Mine Cart Madness
    Here we go again! In this mine car level you jump out of the cart
instead of with it! This can lead to some hair-raising deaths! 
1.  High off-screen barrel cannon at gap in bananas on upper track.
    Reach the mine car on this high track via the rope. It's
    shortly before the continue barrel.
        Prize:  Rambi icon, red balloon
2.  Visible barrel cannon just past the big downhill which follows the
    [N] icon. Jump from the mine car while it's still up the hill a
    ways, to reach a mid-air tire; bounce to the barrel.
        Match:  Rambi, Expresso, Enguarde, and Winky icons
3.  Visible barrel cannon under the peak of the big hill immediately
    before the exit. Jump from the mine car on the downward part of the 
    hill to reach the platform at the right, then bounce up and left on 
    tires to the barrel.
        Prize:  only bananas

Blackout Basement
    The difficulty here comes from unreliable lighting. The lights go on
and off, leaving you in the dark as to where to go next. Stop when the
lights go out, and wait for them to come back on. Try to remember what
the scenery looks like before the lights go out.
1.  Low off-screen barrel cannon under the last falling platform - the
    fourth of a group of four - beyond the continue barrel. It is
    marked with a low banana. Just stand in the center of the platform
    as it falls.
        Blast-around:  [N]
2.  Left-hand wall, the last one before the exit. Easiest way to get
    here: ride the steel barrel that appears upon exiting the first
    bonus area, and never get off. The barrel will automatically bounce
    off the right-hand wall before the exit, open the opposite left-hand
    wall, and send the player into the bonus room.
        Memory:  red balloon

BOSS: Dum Drum
    This boss is VERY easy! Just dodge him when he falls, then defeat the
enemies that it drops. Dum Drom will eventually kill itself!


                 CHIMP CAVERNS AREAS
Tanked Up Trouble
    Use the fule canisters to keep the platform moving. To reach the last
fuel can before the half-way mark, jump straight below it. You'll be shot
out of a barrel, collecting the fuel on the way up. Stay on the platform
to collect an Enguarde icon.
1.  Off-screen barrel cannon below the first vertical track section.
    Avoid the first fuel can and stand in the middle of the moving
    platform as it runs out of fuel and falls off the track.
        Memory:  red balloon

Manic Mincers
    Beware the spinning, spiky mincers! Jump over them! However, be sure
that there are no other mincers to the other side of it, ready to shred
you to pieces! :-O====
1.  Right-hand wall of a pit with a single Krusha, shortly after the
    half-way point.
        Bounce:  three blue Klaptraps for red balloon
2.  Right-hand wall under a stacked pair of stationary mincers, which
    are just before the exit. It is possible to get a barrel by
    going up and through a doorway shortly before the mincers.
        Memory:  red balloon

Misty Mine
    This long level is much easier when you have Expresso. However, you
must dismount from your feathery friend to find the second bonus area.
1.  Open off-screen door beside the bottom of a long rope. The rope is
    just past the half-way point, and its path crosses a DK barrel.
    Climb down to near the bottom of the rope and wait until it stops
    moving.
        Prize:  [K], [O], [N], [G], and Expresso crate
2.  Right-hand wall near the end of the level - the first right-hand
    wall beyond: the Expresso icon, a tire jump over a high wall with
    a Klaptrap drum halfway up, and a TNT barrel. Carry the TNT
    barrel to the right, being careful to avoid enemies, over to the
    first right-hand wall. Unlike some other levels, the drums won't
    spit out anything while the player is standing on them.
        Match:  Rambi, Expresso, Enguarde, and Winky icons

Loopy Lights
    This should remind players of Reptile Rumble, back in the beginning
of the game. However, the barrels here control the status of the lights:
turning them on when they are off.
1.  Off-screen barrel cannon in the first pit after the entrance. The
    pit is marked with some bananas in a vertical row.
        Blast-sideways:  [K]
2.  First right-hand wall after the coconut-throwing Necky. Carry the 
    barrel, avoiding coconuts which could shatter it, down the steps to 
    the right; jump one pit, and avoid the one Klaptrap just in front of 
    the wall. Alternative: carry a DK barrel from earlier in the level, 
    to kill the coconut-throwing Necky so that he can't destroy the 
    barrel.
        Prize:  Expresso icon, [N]

Platform Perils
    Aack! Another moving platform level! The area past the half-way
barrel is especially tough, as you must kill the Krusha's there with
barrels! So don't be in a hurry to dispose of your weaponry.
1.  Visible barrel cannon underneath the entry walkway. Once the
    moving platform has moved about its own length, jump from it to
    an off-screen moving platform that is directly under the starting
    position of the visible moving platform.
        Match-KONG:  red-balloon

2.  Off-screen barrel cannon underneath the exit walkway. Jump as far 
    to the right as possible from one of the moving platforms that
    is near the exit and just below its level. The lower walkway
    doesn't stick out to the left nearly as much as the exit walkway
    does.
        Memory:  Enguarde icon

BOSS: Master Necky Sr.
    Unlike the first Master Necky, this one spits out several nuts at
a time. Wait for it to stop, then use the tire to bounce onto Sir Necky's
head. Repeat until he dies.

FINAL BOSS: King K. Rool (or... King KUNG Rool?)
    When you arrive on Gangplank Galleon, be ready to jump over the King.
Don't touch his spiky crown. When he throws his crown across the room,
stomp on his vulnerable head. He'll begin running. Repeat the first step
until he jumps to the other side of the room, and cannon balls fall from
the sky. Run under the balls, then, when King K. throws his crown, bounce
off his head. Repeat until you se some odd credits come up. THIS ISN'T
THE END! When King K. gets up, stand next to him so that he jumps over
you. When he reaches the other side, he'll throw his crown, which is your
cue to jump on him. He'll start jumping again, so run underneath him.
Repeatedly run under him and jump on his head untill he REALLY dies.
Congratulations! You conguered Donkey Kong Country!!!

8) CODES, WARPS, AND ANIMAL BONUSES
                        The "Diddy" Code
This code allows you to play the bonus areas, and collect enough lives to
easily complete the game. On the screen with Cranky Kong playing an old
phonograph, enter the following controller code:
         Down, Y, Down, Down Y
You'll hear a noise, and enter an area with columns of three animal icons.
Now you can explore the animal bonus areas! If you wish to take all of the

lives you earn into a saved game, start up any regular game. Lose all of
your lives in an area you've already completed, and put in the "Diddy"
Code. Earn as many lives as you need, and press start, then select to
begin the game with a ton of lives!

                      The "Darby Day" Code
This code lets you listen to the fantastic must of DKC... without needing
to buy a CD! Highlight the "Erase" selection on the saved game screen,
and enter the following controllor code:
         Down, A, R, B, Y, Down, A, Y
Press select to listen to a different piece of music. You can listen as
long as you want!

                            Warp #1
The first warp can be found between the very first two areas of the game.
You must be controlling a single-icon character (aka: only 1 Kong, or the
Jumbo Barrel). As you move between the first and second area, repeatedly
tap the Y button. When it works, you'll end up near the end of the
Orang-utang Gang area of Vine Valley!

                            Warp #2
To find the second warp, control a single-icon character and move between 
the second and third levels. As you pass between them, rapidly tap the Y
button. You'll find another excellent warp, although you won't go as far
as with the first one.

                      Enguarde Bonus Stage
The Enguarde Bonus Stage has 4 seperate hidden areas. If you go up, left,
or right from the start, you can go straight through the wall, uncovering
a hoard of little Enguarde Coins! After you collect all of these, go down
from the start to find the large Enguarde Coin, which doubles your coin
collection!

                        Rambi Bonus Stage
To find the large Rambi Coin, jump onto the igloo entrance, and to the
right. Jump right from platform to platform, and over the final wall to
the right. Keep running to find the Big Rambi Coin!

                        Winky Bonus Stage
Stay near the top of this level, and jump to the left from platform to
platform. Jump over the left wall, and work your way through the hoards
of coins down to the large Winky Coin.

                      Expresso Bonus Stage
From the start, jump and flap over the left wall to find a ton of coins.
Return to the start and work your way left. Keep going until you reach a
large wall. This can be jumped over, revealing the large Expresso Coin.
