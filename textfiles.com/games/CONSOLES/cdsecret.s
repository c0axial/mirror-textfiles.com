SEGA CD Game Secrets
Version 6
January 1, 1994

This list contains various secrets (easter eggs) for Sega CD games.  I 
have maintained a similar list for the Sega Genesis since October 20, 
1991.  I started this list on January 30, 1993.  New versions of this 
list include every valid secret I have received, so please do not mail 
me requesting "back issues."

Enjoy this list, and please help me out by mailing new secrets to me.  
I am mostly looking for undocumented features that can not be 
discovered through normal play, such as level selects, invincibility, 
and so on.  Because I am not familiar with every Sega CD game, when 
submitting a trick please use the current format and describe it 
fully.  Also, since I can not test all of the secrets, if you notice a 
mistake in one, please mail me the correction (preferably rewriting 
the trick completely).  Thanks.

			SEGA CD Game Secrets

BATMAN RETURNS (1993)
( Stage Select ) Select "Options" from the "Batman Returns" title 
screen.  Change the game type to "Platform Only".  Now, enter the 
following code on the control panel by holding Left on the control pad 
and pressing B while Batman's finger is over each number in this 
order:  1, 7, 1, 6, 7.  Note that by holding Left and pressing B, you 
don't change the status of that item on the screen, but you do enter 
the number.  You should hear a louder beep when you enter the last 
number to indicate that the stage select code is in place.  Set up the 
game options any way you like, then point to the number of the stage 
you wish to start at.  Hold Left and press B to start at that stage.  
Please be aware that choosing 7 as your starting stage will send you 
back to the title screen, since each of the thre game types consists 
of five stages plus an ending sequence.

( Skip Stages ) Set the Game Type to "Driving Only", then hold Left 
and press B at each of the following numbers:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  You will hear a beep.  Start the game, and you can 
skip stages by pressing the C button while the game is paused.

BLACKHOLE ASSULT  (199?)
( Secret Game ) Play the game with your name entered as AZY (with no 
period).  A secret game called Blackball Assult then comes up.  It is 
a two player pong game with a couple variations and a great 
soundtrack.

( Kill Opponents Instantly ) Play the game with your name entered as 
BIGNET.  When you push the start button on controller 2, your opponent 
will die immediately.

( See All Cinema Displays ) If you play the BHA Game as FOMA, Japanese 
characters appear.  It is apparently a menu allowing you to select an 
animation sequence from the game to watch.

( Invincibility )  Enter the name MUTEKI and play the BHA game.  You 
will notice now that the computer can not do damage to you, but you 
can still damage him.  However, the last boss can still damage you 
sometimes, especially when the timer reaches zero.


COBRA COMMAND  (199?)
( Training Mode ) Press start at the title screen.  When you see the 
words "Game Start" and "Config Mode," press Up, Down, Left, and Right 
[and Start?].  You'll hear a short explosion sound.  You will now be 
able to use the "Training" difficulty setting, which will let you 
continue at the point you had reached when you were killed instead of 
being sent back to the beginning of the stage.  This also apparently 
adds several other new difficulties.

( Stage Select ) Press START at the title screen.  When you see the 
words "Game Start" and "Config Mode", press Up, Down, Left, Right, 
Right, Up.  You should hear an explosion sound the first time you hit 
Right in this sequence (you've enabled training mode as described 
above).  You'll hear another explosion when you finish the sequence.  
When you reach the screen that says "New York -- Stage 1", you should 
be able to press Right and Left on the control pad to change your 
starting level.  Once the action starts, you can skip to the end of 
the current stage simply by pressing START.  Press START in the final 
stage, and you'll skip to the ending credits.

( Hexadecimal Code ) With the stage-select code in place, pressing A, 
B, and C at the same time will give you a screenful of hexadecimal 
code that overlays the action.  This trick will no doubt provide you 
with hours of entertainment.


FINAL FIGHT CD (199?)
( Rapid-Fire Mode ) Enter the option menu and highlight the word 
"exit" at the bottom of the screen.  While holding down A, B, and 
Right, press START.  All of the action buttons will have rapid fire.


GOLDEN AXE  (1992)
( Stage Select ) To start on any of the levels in Golden Axe, go into 
Arcade Mode.  Now push  to the Lower Left (the characters will spin on 
the skeleton's hand) and press B and START at the same time.  A number 
will appear in the top left hand corner.  Press Up and Down to adjust 
what level to start on, then select you character and start the game.


MAKE MY VIDEO Discs  (199?)
( Hidden Footage )  This is known to work with "Marky Mark and the 
Funky Bunch," "C+C Music Factory," and "Kris Kross."  It will probably 
work with any title in the series.  At the "U-Direct" menu, press A, 
B, C, Right to watch behind-the-scenes footage.  During any of the 
footage, press Start to call up another sequence, the "Annals of 
Digital Pictures," in which you see the creation of the "Make My 
Video..." concept in 1986.


NIGHT TRAP  (199?)
( Hidden Footage ) Watch the credits at the end of the game.  When the 
words "In Memory of Stephen D. Hassenfeld" appear on the screen, press 
Up, A, A, A, A, A.  You'll be shown some footage that was shot in 
Pawtucket, Rhode Island in December of 1986 when Tom Zito and company 
first demonstrated a prototype of the ill-fated NEMO game system for a 
group of Hasbro executives.  Milton Bradley's Larry Bernstein is seen 
playing Scene of the Crime, which eventually became Night Trap.


REVENGE OF SHINOBI  (1992)
( Unlimited Shurikens ) For unlimited shurikens, set the number of 
shurikens on the Options Screen to 00 until the zeros turn into an 
infinity symbol.


ROAD AVENGERS  (199?)
( Level select ) From game start screen press UP to options (important 
not to move down to options) and press start.  With the cursor on the 
players option press the A button 6 times, and you will hear a beep.  
Exit the options screen and start the game and you will be asked to 
select the level.


SILPHEED (1993)
( Stage Select ) During the intro, press Down, Down, Up, Up, Right, 
Left, Right, Left, A, B, START.  There will be a stage-select option 
on the title screen.  Pick a stage and press A to start there.  If you 
pick a number higher than 12, you'll see one of the animated 
intermissions.

( Shield Recharge ) During the intro, press Right, Left, A, Right, Up, 
C, B, Down, Left, B, A, Up, START.  You can max out your shield at any 
time by pressing A on controller 2.

( Voice Test ) At the title screen, highlight "Option".  Press and 
hold buttons A, B, and C on controller two and press START on 
controller one.  "Sound Test" will be replaced with "Voice Test".  
Press left and right to choose a voice, and press A, B, or C to play 
it.  Pressing Left or Right on controller two alters the speed and 
pitch of the voices.

( Infinite Continues ) When down to your last continue, leave the 
cursor on the words "Continue 01" and wait for the game to go back to 
the introduction.  When the demo sequence begins, press Right, Up, A, 
B, C, Left, Left, Down, C, A, START.  You'll find that the number of 
continues shown on the title screen has been boosted to ten.  You can 
repeat this process when you get down to your last continue again.

( Mania Mode ) During the intro, on controller two press B, B, A, C, 
Up, Left, Right, Down, Up, A.  Press START on controller one.  You'll 
know the cheat is in place if your score reads "00001" when you start 
the game.  You're now in "mania Mode", a difficulty setting that's 
even tougher than the "Hard Rank" on the option screen.


SOL-FEACE  (1992)
(Level Select) On the title screen when it says "push start button," 
press A, B, C, A, B, C, B, C, B, A.  You will hear a short explosion.  
Press start.  Go to the configuration menu and you will be able select 
the level at which you want to start.  

( Skip Level ) Do the level select.  Then, when in any level, at any 
time, if you hit all three buttons (A,B,C) you will automatically skip 
to the next level.

(99 lives and Invincibility) Do the level select.  Move the cursor to 
options in the configuration menu.  Then push right on the D button 
and then press A several times.  Eventually, the word "MY99" will 
appear on the options menu.  "MY99" will give you 99 lives.  If you 
continue to press A while pushing right on the D button, the word 
"MUTEK1" will appear on the options menu.  "MUTEK1" will make your 
ship invincible.  (There may be more special codes.)


TIME GAL  (199?)
( Stage Select ) Press start at the title screen to bring up the game 
select.  Press left, right, right, and Up.  Now you can begin at any 
level.
