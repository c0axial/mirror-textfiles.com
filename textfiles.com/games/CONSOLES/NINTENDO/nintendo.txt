This is something I have pulled off the usenet from the Univ. of Wisconsin
- Milwaukee. There are other lists available and they will be made available
as well in the future. This seems a little cryptic, but if you read what
they put on the bottom, I'm sure you will understand. If you don't understand
or have question/comment, drop in the Games topic in the Entertainment
Conference here on Exec-Pc and drop me note.

  In this list, games have been rated on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the
  best and 1 being the worst.  For each game, the total number of votes,
  the average rating, and the vote distribution are shown.  New games are
  indicated by a "*" before their entry.  If a "(C)" appears after the
  title it means that the game is a CD-ROM or disc system title.  If a
  "(J)" appears after the title it means that the game is currently only
  available in Japan.

  The general guideline for ratings is:

  8-10 worth buying at full price
  6-7  worth buying at a discount, or if you're particularly interested
       in this kind of game
  3-5  only worth renting
  2    only worth playing for free, and only for a few minutes
  1    worthless

  The vote distribution uses a single character to represent the
  percentage of votes for each ranking.  The following character codes can
  appear:

     "." no votes cast        "3" 30-39% of the votes  "7" 70-79% of the votes
     "0"  1-9%  of the votes  "4" 40-49% of the votes  "8" 80-89% of the votes
     "1" 10-19% of the votes  "5" 50-59% of the votes  "9" 90-99% of the votes
     "2" 20-29% of the votes  "6" 60-69% of the votes  "*" 100%   of the votes
