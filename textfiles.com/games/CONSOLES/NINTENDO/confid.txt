Recently, new concerns have developed regarding the sale and
distribution of PC compatible equipment that parmits (I)
the downloading of SUPER NES games from cartridge fromat to PC disc
format; (II) the uploading of such copied PC discs nto PC systems
and onto national and international computer bulleting board system
("BBS systems"); and, (III) the play, modification and alteration of
such Super NES games on PC systems.  Through access to inexpensive
video game rentals and to bulletin board networks, these PC users are
able to illegaly copy vast numbers of Super NES (and other) video game
programs for little or no cost.

Presently, the most "popular" version of these hardware systems originate
from Taiwan and Hong Kong and commonly use the product names "Super
Magicom","Multi-Game Doctor" and "Game Tracker".  These systems cost from
$350-$1,000 and do require a legitimate Super NES or super famicom system
in order to operate.

These copy systems, even without the confirmed presence of unauthorized
copied software, are clearly illegal under US law and the laws of many
other jurisdictions.  Nintendo has recently taken actions against parties
distributing these systems in the United States and the United Kingdom.
In the U.S., two civil lawsuits have been files (in New York and Los Angeles)
and consent injunctions secured (Nintendo V. Tokyo Shop and Nintendo V Japan
Video).  In addition, three criminal raids have been coordinated with the
authorities in the U.K. by Nintendo's distributor, Bandai, and F.A.S.T.
Nintendo will continue to aggressively pursue civil and criminal remedies
against sellers of this unlawful equipment and will work with customs to
block imports of these products.

The rest of the file just explains how unreleased version of games get
on the boards, and that any act of copying/modifying/uploading/etc are
"CLEAR AND UNDENIABLE VIOLATIONS OF THE COPYRIGHT LAW". and how dificult
it is to stop the flow of illegal BBS system activities.

Don't forget, if you have any further information or comments, please
contact Lynn at Nintendo Legal Department. hehe.
