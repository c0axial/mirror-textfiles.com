                  =  THE 32-BIT SNES CD-ROM =


        Collected Through EGM/Contacts/Nintendo Japan


      Stats. Known (By Staff. As of 11/13/1992)

  CD-ROM      :  32-Bits
  Type        :  CD-I (Philipps CD Format)
  CD Compt    :  CD-ROM/XA Bridge (Compt. with Expensive Phil. CD-I)

  Price:  $200 (suggested) Bullshit for 32 bit expect at least $350

  Colors : Same as SNES, 32,000 + Should not be as grainy as the SEGA CD

  Buffer: 1 mb or more

  Onboard Ram : Unknown

                - More than 6mbits (size of 16 BIT Sega CD) is a guess
                  held by most of the KK staff.

                   8 Mbits = 1 mbyte (Onboard 16bit SNES RAM)

  Speed: Unknown. Fast. Very little disk access is expected due to 32
                  bit processor and CD/XA format of interwoven data.

        * NEWS FLASH * : Possible 21 mhz of Speed.

  Date: Mass Production (Japan) August 1993 (Only 1 yr. Development)
        Recent rumors of a 1994 release.


  Advantages:


 1.
    This is Nintendo with a 32 machine, can you picture the power of a
    32 bit CD-ROM with that sheer number of Thrid Party support?


 2.
     Nintendo still intends to sell it for $200, EXCELLENT move, but
     makes the CD sound like vaporware. 32 bits. That is more memory
     than the 24 bit (in essence 16 bit with a Z80 8-bit chip with huge
     megaBIT storage abilities) which is selling for $450.



 Questions? Disadvantages!


  1.
     How will NINTENDO be able to finish this CD within a year? Thrid
     Party support will be given only a few months to produce CD titles?
     Cart quaility games with CD sound may be a reality, but at 32 bit I
     can't help there will be a noticable difference. Nintendo MUST have
     been working on the CD before there're public annoucement


   2.
      Nintendo STILL wishes there system to be compt. with Phillips CD-I
      doesn't that limit the power of the machine to the constraints of
      the Phillips CD? Granted I know little of this system but I would
      appear that many action titles HAVE NOT been released.




  Possible Threats:

  Jaguar - Downgraded to 32 bits from 64, LONG AWAITED. Doubtful with no
           support and a poor Atari track record

  Opera  - Electronic Art's 32 bit CD Machine with download options, can
           you say PIRACY? High price tag my steer gamers away.

  Hu302  - Hudson's PC Engine Update. Amazing it's not a 16 bit with a
           32 bit grafx processor but a real 32 bit (ha. The Turbo/PCE
           is not a true 16 bit machine. Neither was the Super Grafx).
           Morphing techniques and full motion video without CD. May do
           well in Japan.

  Sega   -  The emergence of 32 bit arcade machines and confirmed
            reports from sega may lead to think the GIGA DRIVE, as the
            32 bit system is not far from production. Golden Axe 3 and
            Virtual Racing sound like sound predictions. Terrible sales
            of the Genesis in Japan may speed up process even futher but
            may abandon the US CD in the process.


  Introduction: Summer CES alongside Atari Jaguar expected.
