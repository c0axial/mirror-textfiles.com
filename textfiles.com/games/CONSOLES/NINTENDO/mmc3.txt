NOTES:

*:  On Gauntlet, this is unused.


*1: PINS 1 & 2.  Sometimes these are connected together.  If they are not,
pin 1 is left floating.

*2: PIN 16. Sometimes this is connected to ground.  Other times it is left
floating.  

It seems that pins 1,2 & 16 are related; pins 1 & 2 are shorted as are pins
15 and 16.  Or else pisn 1 & 2 are left open as well as 15 & 16.  I've never
seen say, pins 1 & 2 shorted while pin 16 was open or vice-versa.  I suspect
they relate to extra RAM in the CHR section.
