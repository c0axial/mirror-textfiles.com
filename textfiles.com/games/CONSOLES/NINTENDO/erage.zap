                             Zapp! Gets Zapped!
        It was a hot, humid, sticky, cloudy, day. One of those days that makes you feel as though your head is going
to explode from the pressure in the air. You can feel a thunderstorm, the only question is when it will happen. Zapp! #6
was almost ready for press, and I had just finished laying-out the last file. I had plans to head-out to a local arcade, but
before I left, I un-pluged my computer just in case. After all, I lost my keyboard a few years back to a power surge. The
arcade was packed. On cloudy days, arcades around here are always crowded -  today was incredible! Almost every
game had a line, and the ones that didn't were of the "Centipede" generation. I did, however, get to play a couple titles
before I left. When I left the arcade, I was greeted by a massive thunder storm. That day Rhode Island received more
rain in a couple of hours than it received all summer! The storm drains on the highway were flooded like you wouldn't
believe. There was water everywhere, and It was coming-down so fast that the windshield wiper on the car couldn't work
fast enough. When I finally got back, I was given the news that our building was struck by lighting. At the time, I really
didn't think that anything could of happened to the computer. I looked over the situation.....There was a black spot on
one outside wall. On the other side of the wall, an electrical socket was totally destroyed - there were pieces of the
socket all over the floor. The odor of melting wires was in the air. The next thing on my agenda was to check the
computer......Was it working? I reached to the power switch, hoping the computer would go on, start a memory count,
etc. I flicked the switch.....The power supply went on.....The fan when on.....The monitor went on.....The hard drive light
went on...... Then everything stopped. Hysteria set in. I knew at that point that the computer was fried, but didn't want
to believe it. I tried to boot it with a floppy disk, but to no avail. It turned out that a massive power surge (obviously) went
through our phone line, as well as our electrical lines, and totally fried the computer by going through the modem. We
also lost some other machines in the office. A whole issue of Zapp! (issue #6) was lost with the now obliterated hard
drive, and I wanted to kick myself for not backing-up the files before I had left....
        ......That is why Zapp! #6 may be a little late. It was by no means a small feat to reconstruct the lost files. After
many late nights, here is Zapp! #6. That storm was a nemesis I wish had never happened. But every thundercloud has
a silver lining; Disaster Insurance. I up-graded to a 486! This officially  "Zapped!" issue includes some newer sections.
We have come a long way for a electronic gaming newsletter; We're still here! Issue #6 is really a landmark. I Hope you
like this issue, so let us know your comments.
