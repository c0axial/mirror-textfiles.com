Section 1 Crude but it's a start
--------------------------------

This only works with 4M games and does rely on you having access
to all sorts of electronics equipment and tools. One of the problems
with copying games is that the memory devices used cost 8.50 pounds
for each 4M. Although these devices can be re-used and provide 
permanent games cartridges.

The basic idea is to take a cartridge to bits and swap to game ROM 
with your own EPROM as follows :

1) You will require, a 27C4001 EPROM and programmer, soldering equipment,
several 32 pin IC sockets and a long pin 32 pin IC socket.

2) First open a suitable 4M cartridge. This should be one that contains
a single 4M ROM. If you don't know what I'm talking about, stop now. To
open the cartridge you should use a 'System Zero' screwdriver, but needle
nose pliers work.

3) Now for the tricky bit. De-solder and remove the ROM from the cartridge 
PCB. The easiest way to do this is to find an expert. Just be very careful.
Now solder a socket into the vacant holes; plug the ROM back into the 
socket and test that the game still works. The board should be plugged in
with the component side towards the back of the SNES.

4) Next you need to program the SMC file into the 27C4001 EPROM. First
the SMC file is converted to a binary file using the program provided.
This file is then copied to your programmer and the EPROM programmed. The
file should exactly fit the device ( 512K bytes ).

5) The next problem is that SNES use two different pinouts for their ROM's.
A few are JEDEC compatible and the EPROM will plug directly into the 
socket in the cartridge.
The remainder use a Japanese ROM pinout as follows :


    EPROM    ROM                              ROM    EPROM
                      ------------------
    A19      A17      :  1   \__/   32 :      VCC    VCC
    A16      A18      :  2          31 :      *OE    A18
    A15      A15      :  3          30 :      A19    A17
    A12      A12      :  4          29 :      A14    A14
    A7       A7       :  5          28 :      A13    A13
    A6       A6       :  6          27 :      A8     A8
    A5       A5       :  7          26 :      A9     A9
    A4       A4       :  8          25 :      A11    A11
    A3       A3       :  9          24 :      A16    *OE
    A2       A2       : 10          23 :      A10    A10
    A1       A1       : 11          22 :      *CE    *CE
    A0       A0       : 12          21 :      D7     D7
    D0       D0       : 13          20 :      D6     D6
    D1       D1       : 14          19 :      D5     D5
    D2       D2       : 15          18 :      D4     D4
    GND      GND      : 16          17 :      D3     D3
                      ------------------

So you need to build an adapter socket. This consists of a 32 pin
socket with long legs, plugged into a normal socket. So that when 
finished you have the EPROM on top plugged into a long pin socket,
this is plugged into a normal socket, which is in turn plugged into
the socket in the cartridge. I would strongly recommend 'turned pin'
sockets.


Some of the legs on the long pin socket must now be cut and linked.

Cut short legs 1,2,24,30 and 31.
Link pins as follows :

Pin 1 on top socket to pin 30 on lower socket.
Pin 2 on top socket to pin 24 on lower socket.
Pin 24 on top socket to pin 32 on lower socket.
Pin 31 on top socket to pin 1 on lower socket.
Pin 32 on top socket to pin 2 on lower socket.

Now check back through what you have done. Plug the EPROM into the top
socket and plug the whole thing into the cartridge. 

The cartridge will now work with the new game, which can be changed for
anouther game at any time.

Too much hassle ? Read the next section.



Section 2  Multi Game Cartridge
-------------------------------

This is a basic PCB which replaces the cartridge and can hold up to four
programs, stored in EPROM's. So you will need the facilities to program
EPROM's.

The cartridge holds up to eight EPROM's of 1,2,4 or 8M each. There is also
a battery backed up RAM with a separate section for each game.

First you will need to get hold of one of these PCB's. As soon as I have
the full details I will post the PCB layout, schematic and parts list. 
If it is sorted out in time, there will be an accompanying file with a
contact address.

First the SMC files have to be converted into binary files for programming 
the EPROM's. The accompanying program does this conversion and splits the 
game into a separate file for each EPROM required. The EPROM's are then
plugged into the cartridge, making a permanent game.

The games within the cartridge are cycled each time the reset is pressed.

If you get bored with a game you can erase it and re-program. 


Section 3  The cheapo copier
----------------------------

Not a DIY kit, but the basic unit costs under 100 pounds.

This is a simpler replacement for the SMC copier. It does not have its
own disc drive, but communicates with a PC via its printer port.

Games and RAM contents can be loaded and saved to disc on the PC.

The unit is only slightly larger the a standard cartridge and does
not require any extra power. The basic unit has 8M of RAM and can hold
up to 64M, with 64K of backed up RAM. 

There is an expansion socket for reading cartridges.

Once power is removed from the SNES the stored program will be lost.

If it is sorted out in time, there will be an accompanying file with a
contact address.
