The Classic Games Cartridge List Server

Last Updated 03/16/94


The following is a list of cartridge list files available via mailserver.
These files represent lists of cartridges known for each system, as well as
cartridges that are rumored to exist.  These lists have been compiled by
Dean Dierschow (dean@xocolatl.com).  I welcome updates, changes, suggestions,
and other lists to merge with these.

To get help on this mail server, send electronic mail to the address
"mail-server@xocolatl.com" with the line "help" as the body of the message.
To get this file again, send e-mail with body of the message containing the
line "send CARTS.LST".  To get any of the files listed below, include the line
"send <file name>", in which the file name is one from the list below.  To
get a UUENCODED PkZipped file that contains all lists, request "CARTS.ZIP".

These lists represent data received from many sources.  They also represent
the database of the cartridges I own, and thus has some data fields for that
information.

In each file, the main fields are Manufacturer, Product Number, and Cartridge
Name.  Before the Manufacturer column is the data for what I own with the
following meanings:

	'x' = I own the cartridge
	'I' = I have the instructions
	'P' = I have the instructions photocopied
	'O' = I have the overlays for the game

Between Number and Name is a field for Status, with the following meanings:

	R  = Released
	P  = Prototype
	NR = Never Released
	NC = Never Completed
	CS = "Coming Soon"
	EU = European release only

I am interested in more information for these lists, or in trading cartidges
or instructions.

The existance of these lists is in no way intended to be an offer to sell
items mentioned on these lists.  I am not a dealer.  Please do not contact me
asking to buy anything on these lists.  Please contact me if you are
interested in trading for anything on 'TRADING.LST'.
