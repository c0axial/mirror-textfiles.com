"SEGA Interface"

This is for Sega's "E-SWAT" game, from 1989.  It is referred to in the book
as the "Sega Interface", so I would assume that it's their own standard. 

Why they don't just use JAMMA, I'm not sure.  This doesn't provide anything 
that JAMMA doesn't, and, in fact, is missing the tilt switch connection.

Anyway, here it is:
