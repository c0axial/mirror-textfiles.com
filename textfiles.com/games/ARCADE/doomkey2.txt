Copies of various messages posted on CIS regarding hidden cheat keys in DOOM.
Thanks to those who discovered and/or posted the information!  This document
compiled by The Maverick [70671,1524].  Please let me know of any new
developments....

The following information was initially posted by Thomas Christie 71777,204
(original message lost)

Make a file called D.BAT in you DOOM directory consisting of:

DOOM -DEVPARM -WART 1 %1 -SKILL %2

Then type D (map number) (skill level) to run DOOM on the selected map at the
selected skill level.  For example, D 9 4 would start you on level 9 (the 
secret level) at skill level 4 (ultra-violence.)

For DOOM, while you are playing type the following.

idkfa=full weapons and keys (No BFG 9000 or Plasma gun in the SW version tho')

iddqd=god mode

idbehold and S,V,L,A, and some other to turn on the LI Goggles, etc.  Play with
this one,
it would look like idbeholdL and so on.

idclev followed by an episode number (defaults to 1 if you have the SW version)
and then a level number.

Hope that helps, and Happy Blasting!
I really do have more fun with the game without the debug keys, but they are
fun sometimes.

Also, "idspispopd", turns clipping on and off, allowing you to walk through
walls and amazingly jump to openings, because of the x,y co-ordinate system
used...

 While playing with DOOM I've discovered some undocumented Keys and command
Line parameters.

Keys:   ,(comma) and . (Period) are strafe left and strafe right. Very useful
for avoiding the fire balls thrown by the imps and for running along the walls
looking for secret passages, use with shift to move faster

        In map mode the G key will turn on a grid.


Command Line Parameters (usage c:doom -devparm)

        -DEVPARM  turn developers mode on, this is the most usefull command by
far.  When you use this parameter the F1 key will save the current content of
the screen as a PCX file.  This is very handy when in map mode. When you have
explored a level you can go to map mode and press the F1 key to save a copy of
the map.  You can then print it out and use it to mark the secret doors and
location of treasures. Hopefully some person will then upload these maps.

        -WART episode game  This needs to be used with the DEVPARM parameter
and allows you to warp to any level of the game. The parameter episode is the
game number 1 for the shareware version and game is the level 1 to 9 (1 to 8
are the normal levels and 9 is the secret level) . Use with the -SKILL
parameter to set the skill level. USAGE   DOOM -DEVPARM -WART 1 9 -SKILL 1  to
get to the secret level at the whimpy skill level.

        Other parameter I have not as yet found a use for
        -FILE -PLAYDEMO -TIMEDEMO -DEBUGFILE -RECORDFRINM -RECORD -NODRAW
-NOBLIT



HOPE THIS HELPS!

About the -devparm...

The -record and -recordfrom options are for 'recording' your movements.
-playdemo and -timedemo will play these back in demo format.  Once in the
record mode, press Q to stop recording.  -recordfrom will start recording from
a saved game.  (I think I might have explained this better before...)  Hope
that makes sense.

It seems the -noblit and -nodraw could be for timing purposes?  I'm not sure.
The game runs and quits fine, it's just that there is nothing on the screen!
Then it gives time specs... I haven't figured those out yet either...

Blitting is fancy word for copying images into a video buffer or the video
display itself. Drawing (in this instance) probably means copy the video buffer
into actuall video memory (so that you can see).

These two are probably only for determining the speed of the game under various
conditions.

I don't know about your first 2 problems, but the directory C:\DOOMDATA is
hardcoded into DOOM.  The only way to change it is to edit the binary (that is,
executable) file.

Fm: Software Recording Corp. 76447,3264
To: David Peel 71644,1251

No one claimed that the use of C:\DOOMDATA would be changed by the patch.  The
patch is intended to fix several problems in the DOS extended that DOOM uses
and to correct an incompatibility with the original (v1.0) Sound Blaster.

                                                Steve Snyder

P.S. If the C:\DOOMDATA is really that intolerable, you can edit DOOM.EXE to
change the hardcoded path.  There are 3 references to the ASCIIZ string
"c:\doomdata\xxxxxxxx.yyy", where xxxxxxxx.yyy is a file type (savegam.dsg or
default.cfg).  It worked for me.  With a binary editor, search on the string
"c:\doomdata".

Just uploaded to section 7, to go online when a SYSOP gets around to it.

  Title   : Saved Game Cheat For Doom
  Keywords: DOOM CHEAT ID

    This is a save game file for the game Doom.  It starts you out from
  the beginning just like "New Game", and on the highest difficulty level,
  but with 199% health, 999% armor, a chainsaw, pistol, shotgun, chaingun,
  and a rocket launcher.  It also removes the limits on the amount of ammo
  you can carry, and starts you out with 999 rounds for each weapon.

In case no one posted them yet, here are cheat codes for DOOM.

IDDQD  God Mode
IDKFA Very Happy Ammo mode (also gives all 3 skulls)
IDSPISPOPD No clipping (does unspeakably wierd things, but great for finding
secret areas,
                          and going outside)
IDBEHOLD Gives lots of items (invis, night-vision, etc)

 I think there's a few more as well. You don't need to enter anything at the C
prompt...just hit the above letters in sequence during play.

Andre,

  > ... here are cheat codes for DOOM.

Thanks for posting them!  Unfortunately they do not seem to work in network
games.  Each code begins with "ID"; but "I" is also the key to press to chat
with the "indigo" player (black), so pressing "I<anything>" sends everything
after the "I" as your chat text to the indigo player.  If you find codes that
work in network games, please post them!

Sb: #DOOM maps revealed
Fm: Dave Timoney (Humongous) 72662,1360
To: All

Well, I don't think it's been mentioned here, but since someone already
mentioned the  -devparm feature for the DOOM command line, I'd like to add
something. This information is courtesy of the Internet, where many folks have
spent a lot of effort to learn this information.

 Among the many things you can do once you're in the game with the -devparm
enabled, go to the map screen (you _did_ read the instructions and press F1,
right?)  and type 'iddt'  (no quote) to reveal the entire map for the level.
While, at first, I thought this info would ruin the game for those that can't
resist walkthrus, hintfiles, and the like - I've since come to realize that
just knowing where a passage is doesn't necessarily help you get there <g>

 And, as mentioned, with the -devparm enabled, pressing F1 gives you a screen
dump, in PCX format. If you have a 'paint' program, you can possibly print the
maps out so you can make notes.

     Not only does it provide the full map (and it stays active as you move
from level to level, so you don't need to type it again... but it ALSO, when
typed a second time will show ALL OBJECTS (I belive) on the level, enemies,
barrels, powerups, etc., etc... when typed a THIRD time it will revert the
map back to the state it would be in normally... and you DO NOT need to start
the game with -DEVPARM to get it to work... :)

     Note that there ARE some areas that will be shown that you will never be
able to get to, but they don't count on your secret score (but they are
intresting to explore with 'no clipping ()' active, like the monster holding
room for the pentagram at the secret military base...
