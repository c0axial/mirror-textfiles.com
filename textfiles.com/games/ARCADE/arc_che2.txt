The definitive arcade video game cheat sheet.
Last update: 01 Dec 1992.

This list was started by Jeremy Radlow.  Due to the fact that he's lost his
net access (horrors), I'm now the administrator of this list.

Note : Ignore the ftp info for now ... Clay Cowgill's NeXT cube was stolen
       and the ftp site went with it ... so email to musjndx@gsusgi2.gsu.edu
       for a copy of the cheat sheet.  Please do not email to my gisatl
       address as I do not keep the cheat sheet.

To get an up-to-date copy of the video game cheat sheet, ftp a copy from 
tsunami.cs.orst.edu in the pub/cheats directory or, if you can't ftp, send a
message to musjndx@gsusgi2.gsu.edu.  There is not now, nor will there ever 
be, a 'mailing list'.  Nor will I post the sheet to USENET due to its 
excessive size.  This is mainly to keep my mailbox from getting flooded with 
the large number of resulting responses. (and I do mean *large*).

If you have already made a contribution to the cheat sheet and wish a new copy,
just ftp a new copy or let me know and I'll mail you an up-to-date version.

Please note : due to the high traffic involving this list, it might take me
              up to a week or so to actually mail you a copy of the list.

There are three sections to the cheat sheet:
  * Beginners section.  This contains either cheats that don't get
    you much, or cheats that are only helpful to advanced players.
  * Intermediate section.  This contains cheats that can get you
    a big edge.  They are usually not any harder than playing the
    game honestly.
  * Advanced section.  This contains extremely low-effort high-pay
    cheats; secret back doors;  and in the next revision will contain
    advanced general-purpose game beating strategies, if someone sends
    me some.

When you send in a cheat, it'll be put in one of these sections and you 
will get a copy of the cheat sheet in return.  Basically, you get out what 
you put in ...

   Some of these cheats may be inaccurate; don't trust anything attributed
to someone else.  If it turns out that some information is wrong - don't get
mad, get even!  Tell me what's wrong.  Please note, though, that different ROM
versions on machines may eliminate some cheats ...

(When you send in your cheat, please send in your high score.  Don't
send in a high score without a cheat/strategy, it'll be ignored.
And multi-credit games don't count ... but multi-player games do.  That's
what the [mp] slot is for.  The idea behind this high score sheet is
that if you have a high score higher than one listed here, you must
know something useful ...)

   * All the Crystal Castle warps.
   * Big point bugs on Road Blasters, Star Wars, Super Mario Brothers,
