DIG DUG                                   Typed in by : Rick Schieve

This is Dig Dug made easy.  No fooling around with all the extra +5
VDC return lines and other baloney done with the audio/regulator
board and Atari power supply.  A standard +5/+12 VDC game supply
will run this fine.

A - ground                1 - ground

The 36 VAC is used to derive an internal -29 VDC for the high score
table so it is not required for the game to work.

For audio amplification I used an LM380 2 watt audio amp chip
available from places like Digi-Key for under $1 as follows.

Pin C from Dig Dug board to one side of 10 K (volume) pot and the
other side of the pot to ground.  Center tap of pot to pin 2 (of
LM380).  Pins 7 & 3 ground.  Pin 14 to +12 VDC and .1 uf from pin 14
to ground (decoupling cap).  Pin 8 (output) has 2.7 ohm in series
with .1 uf to ground to prevent chip from oscillating.  Positive end
of 250 uF electrolytic to pin 8 also.  Negative end of cap to
speaker and other speaker connection to ground.
