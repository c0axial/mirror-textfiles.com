                              version 0.2

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
   This FAQ is meant to be an all-in-one guide to the Sega Genesis game
Eternal Champions.  Although rather sparse at the moment, I hope to add
much more text in the future - more information about the special moves, 
information about the Overkills, all of the characters' endings, strategy
guides, etc.  Don't send me information just yet - I still have a lot 
more to type in and I don't need to be inundated with mail right away.  
I'll probably ask for help sometime in the near future.

REVISION HISTORY
================
1/18/94 - version 0.1:  Began writing this.
1/22/94 - version 0.2:  Released to the public (netnews.rec.games.sega)

THE STORY
=========
  Welcome to my chamber.  I am the Eternal Champion, keeper of this vast
fighting complex.  It exists in a place and time corrupted by centuries
of misuse and destruction.
  My purpose in this grand scheme is to maintain the balance between
good and evil, light and darkness, hope and despair.
  Now this balance has been lost and the very fabric that holds the
world together will be torn apart.
  Your future, my present, has been destroyed by a cruel and unjust
twist of fate.
  Nine individuals from various periods in time were killed before their
lives could affect this dark existence.
  I have observed each of their short lives and have been powerless to
stop the chaos.
  I have spent the centuries harnessing my power for this very moment.
I am the pur and untouched energy of all the great martial arts masters
that have lived before me.  Their skill, wisdom, knowledge and
inner-strength are at my command.
  Even with the force of their collective powers, I can only reward one
of the nine individuals with the gift of life.  Any of them can have an
equally profound effect on the future.  For this reason, the contest
must take place.
  At the end of this contest, only one will remain.  The victor will be
returned to life a few seconds before his death, allowing him to avoid
the past with the knowledge to change the future.

  Only one may live so that balance may again be achieved.

  Let the contest begin. . .

MOVES LISTS
===========
I haven't yet had a chance to sit down and figure out how much Inner
Strength the special moves use (and I know that Dave Woodall is doing
something similar), but that information will be in a later version of
this FAQ.  Another note about Inner Strength - you can have more than it
shows on the screen.  I think that it updates relatively smoothly - if
you're Trident and you see your second quarter-circle appear, if you
wait half of the amount of time it would take for the next quarter-circle
to appear, you can safely do a fireball or ground-slide (normally you 
need three-quarters of a circle to do the move).

Please not that all moves relating to range are my opinion and my
opinion only.  Since this list was not all compiled at once, there may
be some variations in range between characters.  Certainly, Jetta's long
range is likely to be different from, say, Xavier's long range.  I've
also only put ranges where they're really applicable.  On moves such as
RAX's mid-air spin or Jetta's thing where she pulls her arms down, there
really isn't any range - it'll only hit if the opponent touches you. I'm
also not too up on my combat terminology - punches are punches and I
can't always describe all the moves easily (Blade's ducking C kick, for
instance).  If you know technical names for moves, send them to me.

The following notation is used throughout the move guide:
X = Straight Punch
Y = Lunge Punch
Z = Swing Punch
A = Snap Kick
B = Thrust Kick
C = Wheel Kick
CB = Charge Back (away from opponent)
CD = Charge Down
F = Forward
(xxs) = hold for xx seconds
x-y = do x then y
x+y = do x and y at the same time

Throwing information:  
  When in close range, for all characters except Slash, if you press
forward and Y or Z you will throw your opponent forwards.  If you press
backwards and Y or Z you will throw your opponent backwards.

RUMOURS/HIDDEN THINGS
=====================
Yes, I know about the Overkills.  Yes, I know how to do all the Overkills.
Until I can do all of them consistently though, I'm not putting them in
(there's about two that I can't get reliably).

During one game session (i.e. - while the cartridge was on), everytime
Slash would bat back a projectile, he would gain back about 5 pixels of
health.  This happened both in the Battle Room and in two-player fight 
mode, and for any kind of projectile.  Slash was player one.  We've been
completely unable to replicate this effect, though, and don't know if it
was just a feature or if there's a way to make it happen consistently.

THE ETERNAL CHAMPION
====================
Losing message:

  Your performance has disappointed.  You are not worthy to live beyond
the life that fate dealt you.  I have no choice except to return you to
your death.  This outcome was not as I had planned.

  I doubt I have the energy to bring the others back for another
contest. The world is lift with little chance.

  I must return to my meditation chamber and see if there is a way to
avert the certain disaster that awaits the future.  You have failed and
because of this the future is in doubt.  My time is over. . .

  And so is yours. . .
