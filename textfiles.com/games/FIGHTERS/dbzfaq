The dox for DRAGON BALL Z SUPER BUTOH DEN 2 by BANDAI
Typed by SONGOKU of CENSOR


This game is based on a Japanese anime called Dragon Ball Z, which is my
favorite (look at my name)... anyway... you can choose various modes from the
title screen, and they are in order-

BUTOHDEN MODE < STORY MODE > - Choose a character and play the computer. You'll
have to make choices about where to go, who to fight, etc., but the choices are
only relevant to the story and not to the game, so you can really choose any-
thing just to play... After you've chosen a character, you'll choose a diffi-
culty level. They are- 1 (Easy) 2 (Normal) 3 (Hard) 4 (Super)

VS. MODE - From here are 3 choices, in order, all are self explanatory-
1P VS. 2P
1P VS. COMPUTER
COMPUTER VS. COMPUTER

After choosing a character, you'll have the following choices, in order-
LIFE- Press right or left to change the amount of life you have from 400 to 10.
ATTACK POWER - Light or Hard. It starts on Light.
GAME RANK - 1 (Easy) 2 (Normal) 3 (Hard) or 4 (Super)
MUSIC - Choose a music.

TENKAICHIBUDOHKAI < MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENT > - Up to 8 players can compete.
Choose a character, and if you don't have 8 people to play with, press start
when your last character is chosen.

OPTIONS - These are your choices-
SOUND........STEREO or MONAURAL. When you first enter Options, it's on stereo.
MUSIC........ Choose a music.
SOUND EFFECTS Choose an effect

Here's the basic gist of the game.

CONTROLLER FUNCTIONS-

Y - PUNCH
B - KICK
A - ENERGY USE. PRESSING THIS ONCE WILL LET OUT A BASIC FIREBALL. PRESSING
IT
WITH CONTROLLER MOVEMENTS WILL DO VARIOUS SUPER MOVES.
L - FLY TO THE LEFT
R - FLY TO THE RIGHT
A+B TOGETHER - BUILD POWER
X - FLY UP TO THE SECOND LEVEL, OR DOWN TO THE FIRST

The ULTIMATE POWER MOVES ( HISSATSUWAZA ) can be performed only if you have
enough POWER. Normal special moves also take power, but not nearly enough.

If you move far enough away from an enemy, the screen will split. It will
also split if you press "X" to fly up or down. If you are far away from an
enemy ( i.e. the screen is split ), you can only harm them with a special move.

If you press Start to pause the game, and then press Select, you'll get this
menu:

COMMAND - Normal (Allows you to do special moves) and Auto and Super Auto, in
which the computer will do special moves for you. All you have to do is
press "A." It starts on Normal.

SPECIAL MOVE COMMAND FIXING - Allows you to make it so instead of the special
move commands reversing when you turn around, as in other fighting games, they
will stay fixed, and will require the same commands from either direction.
For example, to do Gohan's Masenkou you'd press Left, Down-Left, Down,
Down-Right, Right, A if you were facing right. It would be Right, Down-Right,
Down, Down-Left, Left and A if you were facing left. If you change this option
to the first selection, it will always be "Right, Down-Right, etc." and if you
move it to the second, it will always be "Left, Down-Left, etc." no matter what
direction you're facing. This option starts on Normal.

COMMAND HELP - Allows you to see all special moves of a character, but it's
all in Japanese, so use this guide instead. Starts at "Gohan."

SOUND MODE - Stereo or Monaural. Starts at Stereo.

RADAR - Turn the top radar on or off. Starts at "On."

HOW TO BLOCK

When an ULTIMATE POWER MOVE comes rushing at you, you've got to block it or face
serious damage! Here's how:

Guard - Back and A. You'll receive 50% of the damage you'd get if not blocking.
Repel - Back, Down-back, Down and A. You'll receive 25% damage.
Psychic Block - Forward, Back, Forward, A. You'll receive no damage.
Energy Block - Down, Down-Back, Back, Forward, A. You'll fire a burst of energy
that will collide with the enemy's. Press Y, B, and A rapidly to force your
beam forward. Also, if the enemy tries this on you, press Y, B, and
A rapidly to turn his attack into YOUR attack!

A note on the ULTIMATE POWER MOVES. You can do them when you have 0 Power, but
after you've shot them you'll be left open to attack for a while as you will be
recuperating from the force of shooting a special attack with no Power.

THE RADAR
This appears at the top of the screen. It shows where you and your enemy are.

Whew! OK, That's the end. Please don't add your name to this file and upload it
as if you wrote it. I worked long and hard on this doc, and the translation was
very hard even though I know plenty Japanese!
