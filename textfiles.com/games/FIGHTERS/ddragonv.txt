The ZotGuide Series:
Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls  [SNES]

by the Zotmeister (Adam R. Wood, zot@ccs.neu.edu)

Version 5

Joypad: D=down, U=up, T=towards opponent, A=away from opponent
        two adjacent letters represents the appropriate diagonal
        hold = hold the pad down in that direction for about 1.5 seconds
               minimum before continuing
Buttons: P=punch, K=kick; L=light, M=medium, H=hard; R=press fast repeatedly
	 When no strength specification is listed, any of the three will do.
	 Light attack buttons execute shorter and/or slower versions
         of the special moves than when stronger attack buttons are
	 used.  When the effect is radically different, I will specify
	 what happens.
Notes: 1) Commas separate motions that should be done consecutively;
	  for example, if given D, DT, T, rotate the pad from down to towards,
	  going through the diagonal.  Ampersands (&'s) represent moves to be
          done simultaneously. [Just in case you've never played a fighting
          game before.]
       2) To execute an overkill, both you and your opponent must be on
	  the ground, and you must hit him with the attack listed by HIS
	  name, not yours.  If it does enough damage for you to win the 
	  match (not round, match), watch and enjoy.  Overkills cannot	
	  be performed against the computer when the difficulty is set
	  to Easy.
       3) For those moves not mentioned in the manual, I have used literary
	  license to give them my own names.  If you have better suggestions,
	  email me.  My imagination wasn't with me this time around, so
	  I'm sure you people can make better names than my lame ones.
       4) SPECIAL CODES:  All special codes are inputted on the main
	  menu screen on the first controller.  "Tournament" must be the
	  currently highlighted mode - if it is not, just press up or
	  down until it is, then input the code.  If a code was properly
	  inputted, a sound effect will confirm it, depending on the code.
		1 - Pressing L,L,L,R,L,R,L,R will:
			* Allow 11 attribute points per player to be
			  distributed instead of 9
			* Allow up to 6 points maximum in any one
			  attribute instead of 5
			* Turn the Shadow Master's eyes blue on the
			  title screen
		[This code is given to you when the game is beaten in
		 Story Mode on the Pro level.]
		2 - Pressing up,right,down,left,down,right,R,R AFTER
		    INPUTTING CODE 1 will:		
			* Allow 13 attribute points per player to be

			  attribute instead of 6
		3 - Pressing right,down,down,left,up,right,L,R,L,R,L,R
		    AFTER INPUTTING CODE 1 THEN CODE 2 will:
			* Allow 15 attribute points per player to be
			  distributed instead of 13
			* Allow up to 8 points maximum in any one
			  attribute instead of 7
		4 - Pressing left,right,left,right,L,L,R,R,R will:
			* Increase the amount of continues allowed to nine
		5 - Pressing R,right,L,L,left,left,R,R will:
			* Disable throwing in all modes
		6 - Pressing down,down,left,up,down,down,left,up,R,R,L will:
			* Disable dizzies in all modes
		7 - Pressing L,R,up,L,L,down,R,R will:
