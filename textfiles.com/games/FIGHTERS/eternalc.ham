
  The following is an attempt to document every possible move for all
the characters in Eternal Champions.  This is the first part of it, and
contains all the moves for the first four characters.  I will post the
remaining characters on Monday.

  I would like to make this as complete and correct as possible, so 
feel free to send me e-mail if you find mistakes or omissions.  My e-mail
address is:  woodall@adrs1.dseg.ti.com

  This is not intended to be an all-inclusive FAQ - Adam Rixey is 
working on that.  This is intended to be a quick reference that can be
used while playing and learning.

  NOTES:

  1) For each Special Move, I tried to figure out how much Inner Strength
     is needed to execute the move, and how much it consumes.   I mainly
     did this by Insulting the opponent until my I.S. was gone, then 
     repeatedly tried executing the move until I had enough I.S. for the
     move to be allowed.  I found out a few curious things:

     a) Sometimes when your I.S. is full, executing a Special Move will
        not drain it at all - at least the gauge doesn't change.

     b) It seems that the more I.S. you have, the more it will consume 
        when performing some moves.  Several of the moves will consume
        either 0.5 or 0.75 of the total I.S. - depending on how much
        you started with.  The numbers I have listed are when the I.S.
        is low (more critical).

  2) Some moves can be performed by different button sequences.  In this
     case, I only listed the simpler move.
