                       ETERNAL CHAMPIONS BEGINNER TIPS
                     -----------------------------------

  1. When just beginning, choose a well balanced character and stay with
     him/her.  The folks on Sega's Game Play lines recommend Xavier as a
     good starting character.

  2. Go into the 1-player practice mode and set your Inner Strength to
     "Off" (which gives you unlimited Special Move power), set the CPU
     to 4 (the default), and set the time to "Infinite".  Cycle through
     all the characters until you can beat them easily.  Slowly increase
     the CPU's ability until you are at 8.

  3. Now, turn your Inner Strength "On" and the time to "90 seconds".
     Practice until you can usually win.  The difference here is that you
     will have to rely more on normal moves, and can let the clock help
     you in certain cases.  

  4. Be willing to change your attacks!!!  If you try a particular move
     or combo, and it fails every time (against a particular opponent),
     don't keep doing it!!!  For instance, in some cases a leaping punch
     will counter a leaping attack where a leaping kick won't.

  5. When playing in a "Contest", keep an eye on the clock.  Try to get
     an early advantage (in terms of damage), then mainly play in a
     defensive mode, only taking advantage of obvious opportunities.
     When the clock runs low (under 10 seconds), don't attack at all
     (unless your behind) - just run and block until the clock runs out.

  6. Once a move is started, it will complete unless interrupted by a
     counter attack.  For fastest response time, prepare your next move
     by pressing the first set of buttons before your current move is done.
     This is especially handy when you get knocked down - you can often
     come out of it doing a Throw.

  7. Make use of your character's special abilities - like being able to
     stun your opponent or using extra jumping abilities to avoid attacks
     or projectiles.

 
                         ETERNAL CHAMPIONS MOVE LIST
                       -------------------------------
  NOTES:

  1) For each Special Move, I tried to figure out how much Inner Strength
     is needed to execute the move, and how much it consumes.   I mainly
     did this by Insulting the opponent until my I.S. was gone, then 
     repeatedly tried executing the move until I had enough I.S. for the
     move to be allowed.  I found out a few curious things:

     a) Sometimes when your I.S. is full, executing a Special Move will not
        drain it at all - at least the gauge doesn't change.  I suspect that
        you can have more I.S. than the gauge shows.

     b) It seems that the more I.S. you have, the more it will consume when
        performing some moves.  Several of the moves will consume either 0.5
        or 0.75 of the total I.S. - depending on how much you started with.
        The numbers I have listed are when the I.S. is low (more critical).

  2) Some moves can be performed by different button sequences.  In this
     case, I only listed the simpler sequence - or put the additional
     button sequence in parentheses.

  3) Some moves will have a different name listed in parentheses - for
     example:  Medium Kick (knee smash).  The name in parentheses is
     the move that occurs when you use the same button sequence but
     your character is standing next to your opponent.

  4) The damages listed for the Regular Moves is the MAXIMUM damage that
     move CAN do.  However, some moves have multiple hits and can be
     blocked mid way through.  This will reduce the amount of damage done.

  5) Once a Special Move is initiated, Special Moves are disabled until
     the current S.M.'s attack, mode or whatever is over.

  6) Special Moves marked with "*" are those that will stun or freeze the
     opponent - making for an easy attack.

  7) Regular Moves marked with "@" are those that will provide "extra air"
     by moving up again (while in the air).  For Rax, press U + F > Y to
     leap, then hit Y again.  Massive air time!!!

  8) There is a "total damage" number listed with each Combo move.  This
     number is the MAXIMUM damage for the entire combo.  Usually, the 
     computer can and will start blocking during the move.  This will
     reduce the amount of damage done.
 
  9) The Top 5 moves are those that can be used very frequently for
     effective matches, not necessarily those that do the most damage.

     Legend:
     --------------------------------------------------------------
       CB = Charge (Hold) Back (back means away from opponent)
        U = Up
        D = Down
        F = Forward (forward means toward opponent)
        + = press buttons at the same time
        , = press buttons sequentially
        > = hold button(s) while pressing the next ones

                              Offensive Strategies:

    1. Overall, Larcen's kicks are slightly more potent than his punches.
       When leaping forward however, the punches are stronger.

    2. Use repeated Z punches (normal and close) against male characters.
       Use jump kicks and hit-n-run against the female.


                              Defensive Strategies:

    1. Use the Flip Kick (U + A) to counter aerial attacks.

    2. Use the Power Sweep (A + B + C) when cornered.

    3. Use Reflect Back Projectiles (CB + X) to counter flying objects.

                              Offensive Strategies:

    1. Generally, use Rax's legs more since they inflict more damage.

    2. Stun or surprise opponents, get in close, then utilize the
       "toe pounding" (C) move - 35% damage!

    3. Close distances with the Jet Knee Smash (CB .5, F + C).

    4. Use Rax's Undercut Kick (D > A) or Afterburner Thrust (D > C)
       to knock your opponents down.


                              Defensive Strategies:

    1. Use Turbine (CB .5, F + A) to escape from being cornered.

    2. Use Flying Downward Hit (U + F > Z) to counter aerial attacks
       or to scrape someone off the ceiling.

    3. Grab "extra air" (U + F > Y, then Y again) to stay out of harm's
       way for a short time.

                              Offensive Strategies:

    1. Almost without exception, Shadow's punches are better than her
       kicks.  Many are even stronger than some of her Special Moves!!!

    2. Start matches with the Shadow mode and punch quickly!!!

    3. Use the Smoke Screen (X + Y + Z) followed by (X+Y) or (Y+Z) to
       knock opponents out of the air.

    4. Use Flying Mine Uzume-Bi (CB .5, F + Z) to stop a charging
       opponent in their tracks (does well against Slash & Trident).

    5. Play her using a "hit-n-run" offense.


                              Defensive Strategies:

    1. Use the Smoke Screen (X + Y + Z, ...) or Throw (F > Z) if cornered.

                              Offensive Strategies:

    1. Slash's strongest feature is his club.  Use it crouching, up close,
       leaping, etc...

    2. When close execute the Spinal Crush (F + Y).

    3. Stun opponents with the Power Thud (Y + Z) then move in and
       stomp on 'em.

    4. Don't try to Throw (F > Z) unless you're good at hitting the
       opponent when he/she comes down - if you miss, you'll be tired
       (watch Slash's tongue wag) which is just as bad as being stunned!


                              Defensive Strategies:

    1. Get out of a corner with the Running Head Butt (CB .5, F + C).

                              Offensive Strategies:

    1. In the air and on the ground, Trident's kicks rule!  Use the
       strongest kicks (C, U + C,...) and use Z for Plasma Bolts and
       Throws.

    2. Trident has lots of ways to stun his opponent.  Pick one, then
       follow it with a Throw (F > Z) or a Spinning Trident (X + Y + Z).


                              Defensive Strategies:

    1. Use Liquid Mode (A + B + C) to get out of a corner.

                              Offensive Strategies:

    1. Xavier's cane is his strong point.  Use punching attacks to make
       the best use of his cane.

    2. Use the Flying Forward Cane Attack (U + F > Z) to counter any aerial
       attack, or to flick opponents off the ceiling.

    3. Keep opponents away with Boomerang Cane Throws (Z).  Tip:  You can
       defeat Slash with this one key!  He will just keep walking into it.

    4. Freeze opponents with the Midas Touch (CB .5, F + Y), then Throw
       (F > Z) them.


                              Defensive Strategies:

    1. Use the Swap Spell (X + Y) to swap positions with opponent, or the
       Confusion Spell (A + C) - if you become cornered.
