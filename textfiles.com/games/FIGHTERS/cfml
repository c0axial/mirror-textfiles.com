The Clayfighter Moves List - Version 2  (by the Zotmeister)

Joypad: D=down, U=up, T=towards opponent, A=away from opponent
        two adjacent letters represents the appropriate diagonal
        hold = hold the pad down in that direction for about 2 seconds
               minimum before continuing (except where noted)
Buttons: P=punch, K=kick
	 Usually, light attack buttons execute shorter or slower versions
         of the special moves than when stronger attack buttons are used.
	 When the effect is radically different, I will specify what happens.
Notes: 1) Commas separate motions that should be done consecutively;
	  for example, if given D, DT, T, rotate the pad from down to towards,
	  going through the diagonal.  Ampersands (&'s) represent moves to be
          done simultaneously. [Just in case you've never played a fighting
          game before.]
       2) For moves listed as "(can be done in midair)", hold away while 
          on the ground, then jump backwards (still holding away), then press
	  forward and the attack button.  [See 3 below.]
       3) For charge moves, the direction to be held can be replaced by an
	  adjacent diagonal [for example, DA may be held instead of D], but
	  the proper direction must be returned to before the move is
	  launched.  [For example, Frosty's Snow Ball may be done by holding
	  DA for 2 seconds, then rotating the pad up to A for just a split
	  second, then going to T and pressing P.]
       4) For those moves not mentioned in the manual, I have used literary
	  license to give them my own names.  If you have better suggestions,
	  email me.

Bad Mr. Frosty

Holds with brutal punch
Frozen Fist: D, DT, T&P
Ice Ball: A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Shoulder Charge: A, T&P
Snow Ball: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Arcing Snowball: hold D, U&K
Foot Slide: D, DT, T&K
Flying Headbutt:  T, DT&P
Big Arm Sideswipe Hack [BASH]: hold D, U&P (three second charge)
	[By far, the most damaging move in the game.]

Taffy

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Taffy Whack Punch: A, T&P
Taffy Whack Kick: A, T&K
Two-fisted Charge: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Taffy Tornado: A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Aerial Tornado: T, DT&P
Dizzy Fake:  D, DA, A&P
	[This makes Taffy pretend he's dizzy.  He recovers the instant
         an attack button is pressed.  Don't ask me what this move is good
         for, because I don't know.]

Tiny

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Sucker Punch: D, DT, T&P
Backfist Whip: D, DA, A&P
Medicine Ball: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Arcing Ball: hold D, U&K
Air Tackle: ???
	[Tiny jumps up with his fists extended and says "Whoosh".  It looks
	 like Tiny's light punch in midair, but it IS a special attack.
	 I know this because a CPU Tiny used it on me for a Super KO.  Anybody
	 else out there figured out this one?]

Blob

Holds with brutal punch
Vertical Clay Stomp: D&Brutal kick
Arcing Clay Stomp: T, DT&Brutal kick
	[These are not, repeat NOT, special moves.  They do no damage if
	 blocked, and cannot be used for a Super KO.  They are listed here
	 because of the peculiar way they are done.  The vertical stomp
	 goes straight up and down; the arcing stomp does arc forward, but
	 only ever so slightly.]
Clay Spit: D, DT, T&P
Somersault Headbutt: D, DA, A&P
Slide Smack: A, DA, D, DT, T&K
Buzzsaw: hold A, T&P
Flying Roundhouse: A, T, D, DT&K
	[This move must be done rather close to the opponent, otherwise
         the backkick won't hit a thing.]

Blue Suede Goo

Throws with brutal kick
Humming Attack: D, DT, T&P

Dart Dive: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Teleport: P&K
	[The attack buttons must be of the same strength.  The light attack
	 buttons will teleport you to the left side of the screen, the
	 medium attack buttons to the center, and the brutal attack buttons
	 to the right side.]

Helga

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Viking Ram: D, DT, T&P
Jumping Uppercut: D, DT, T&K
	[This move cannot hit someone on the ground; the opponent must
	 be in midair.  Several people mentioned "Armpit of Doom" as an
	 alternate name for this move.  I didn't make this the official
	 name, but I thought it was at least worth mentioning.]

	 ground; the opponent must be in midair.]
