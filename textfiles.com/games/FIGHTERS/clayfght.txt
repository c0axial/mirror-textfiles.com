Version 6

Joypad: D=down, U=up, T=towards opponent, A=away from opponent
        two adjacent letters represents the appropriate diagonal
        hold = hold the pad down in that direction for about 2 seconds
               minimum before continuing (except where noted)
Buttons: P=punch, K=kick
	 Usually, light attack buttons execute shorter and/or slower versions
         of the special moves than when stronger attack buttons are used.
	 When the effect is radically different, I will specify what happens.
Notes: 1) Commas separate motions that should be done consecutively;
	  for example, if given D, DT, T, rotate the pad from down to towards,
	  going through the diagonal.  Ampersands (&'s) represent moves to be
          done simultaneously. [Just in case you've never played a fighting
          game before.]
       2) For "hold" moves listed as "(can be done in midair)", hold away while
          on the ground, then jump backwards (still holding away), then press
	  forward and the attack button.
       3) For charge moves, the direction to be held can be replaced by an
	  adjacent diagonal [for example, DA may be held instead of D], but
	  the proper direction must be returned to before the move is
	  launched.  [For example, Frosty's Snow Ball may be done by holding
	  DA for 2 seconds, then rotating the pad up to A for just a split
	  second, then going to T and pressing P.]  Actually, note 2 is
	  just a special case of this.
       4) For those moves not mentioned in the manual, I have used literary
	  license to give them my own names.  If you have better suggestions,
	  email me.
       5) All moves listed work for both Tournament Edition [TE] and Original,
	  except where noted.  Changes in the moves themselves are also
	  listed where applicable.

Bad Mr. Frosty

Holds with brutal punch
Frozen Fist: D, DT, T&P
Ice Ball: A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Shoulder Charge: A, T&P
Snow Ball: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Arcing Snowball: hold D, U&K
Foot Slide: D, DT, T&K
Flying Headbutt:  T, DT&P in Original; T, D, DT&P in TE
Big Arm Sideswipe Hack [BASH]: hold D, U&P (three second charge)
	[By far, the most damaging move in the game.  In TE, the range
	 of this move is considerably shorter, so watch out.]

Taffy

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Taffy Whack Punch: A, T&P
Taffy Whack Kick: A, T&K
Two-fisted Charge: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Taffy Tornado: A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Aerial Tornado: T, DT&P
Dizzy Fake:  D, DA, A&P
	[This makes Taffy pretend he's dizzy.  He recovers the instant
         an attack button is pressed.  Don't ask me what this move is good
         for, because I don't know.]

Tiny

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Sucker Punch: D, DT, T&P
Backfist Whip: D, DA, A&P
	[This move has a considerable recovery time in TE.]
Medicine Ball: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Arcing Ball: hold D, U&K
Air Tackle: hold D, MediumP&MediumK

Blob

Holds with brutal punch
Vertical Clay Stomp: D&Brutal kick
Arcing Clay Stomp: T, DT&Brutal kick
	[These are not, repeat NOT, special moves.  They do no damage if
	 blocked, and cannot be used for a Super KO.  They are listed here
	 because of the peculiar way they are done.  The vertical stomp
	 goes straight up and down; the arcing stomp does arc forward, but
	 only ever so slightly.]
Clay Spit: D, DT, T&P
Somersault Headbutt: D, DA, A&P
	[This move can doublestrike an opponent at the far edge of the
	 battle arena in TE.  I wonder why they added this in?]
Slide Smack: A, DA, D, DT, T&K IN ORIGINAL ONLY!
	[This move has been eliminated in TE.  This change I understand.]
Buzzsaw: hold A, T&P
	[In Original, this move, if blocked, will cause Blob to bounce
	 against his opponent repeatedly, essentially doing more damage
	 than if it had hit in the first place.  In TE, it will hit only
	 once if blocked.  This is the most prominent, and most
	 necessary, change between the two versions.]
Flying Roundhouse: A, T, D, DT&K in Original; T, D, DT&K in TE
	[This move must be done rather close to the opponent, otherwise
         the backkick won't hit a thing.]

Blue Suede Goo

Throws with brutal kick
Humming Attack: D, DT, T&P
Hair Blade: D, DA, A&P
Hair Slice: T, DT, D&K
Song of Pain: A, DA, D, DT, T, A&K

Ickybod Clay

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Ecto Ball: D, DT, T&P
Ecto Punch: T, DT&P
Dart Dive: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Teleport: P&K (can be done in midair)
	[The attack buttons must be of the same strength.  The light attack
	 buttons will teleport you to the left side of the screen, the
	 medium attack buttons to the center, and the brutal attack buttons
	 to the right side.]

Helga

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Viking Ram: D, DT, T&P
"Armpit of Doom" Jumping Uppercut: D, DT, T&K
"Val-Holler" Yodel: hold A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Valkyrie's Ride: hold A, DA, D, DT, T&K

Bonker

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Flying Pie: D, DT, T&P
Cruising Pie: D, DT, T&K
Cutting Cartwheel: hold A, T&P
Clown Dive: hold D, U&P
Cream Spray: A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Aerial Shuffle [from ground]: A, DA, D, DT, T&K
Aerial Shuffle [from midair]: hold U, K (one second charge)
	[Neither version of the aerial shuffle can hit someone on the
	 ground; the opponent must be in midair.]
Feet-Forward Butt Dive: hold U, P (one second charge)
	[Now THIS is an enigma.  In Original, this is a midair block! 
	 If you get hit while doing this, you will take no damage (except
	 for the sliver that accompanies a special move).  The move does
         no damage to opponents - it is not an attack.  In TE, you can
	 still execute the move, but it does not defend you, and it
	 still does not do any damage... rendering it totally worthless!]
