New in this faq are the game genie codes that boost experience. I believe in
an earlier post I had accidently put that the codes gave HP instead of Exp.
Those typos have been fixed.

DRAGON TRAINING
---------------

At these four sites you can have your hero learn sets of dragon
spells. The dragon spells can be used to transform your hero, and
(with Agni) your entire party. Using a dragon spell should heal your
hero when cast.

1)	You can learn your first set south of Tuntar across the river. You
	can cross the river after lava from a nearby volcano fills in the
	river south of Tuntar.  Defeat TALON to gain Snow, Flame, and 
        Thunder Dragon magics.

2)	You can gain your second set after Gobi has regained the Sphere and
	can turn into a fish. He regains the sphere after your party saves
	Gant and Prima.  

	You will need the Rod5 from Tunlar to gain the item required to enter
	the dragon shrine. In Tunlar, go the the vault and try to walk to the
	treasure chest on the left hand side. You will either be pushed or
	fall down the pit. After you fall though go the the chest in the 
	lower right hand corner of where you have fallen and push the chest
	aside. Search where the chest was and you gain the Rod5. 

	With the Rod5 and some type of fishing bait (you must equip these on
	your hero) try fishing in all the wells you can reach on the global
	map. The list of fishing spots is listed lower down.

	The location of this shrine is southwest of Gant. You can reach it
	by going through the pyramid and around the mountains near Gant.
        Defeat BAIN to acquire Ice, Fire, Bolt, and Gold Dragon magics.

	Note: the Gold Dragon is useful on the undead (zombies) and nothing
	else.

3)	You can reach this place after you can fly with Nina. It is northwest
	of Gust in the middle of a lake. You need the Dragon Armor to enter.
        Defeat AVIAN to receive Rudra magic.

4)	You can gain Agni after you have the power gained from shrine #3
	and you possess the Dragon Helmet and Rudra magic.  No combat is
	involved here. The location of this shrine Under the Water in the 
	Magic Spring. This is the same spring you had to go to fill up
	the Water Jar. Since you can travel under water by this stage in
	the game, enter the water where you filled the jar earlier.

	Note: to use Agni all your characters need to be alive, unparalyzed,
	and unjoined (through Karn's magic).

Rod5 SITES
----------

These are the sites where you can use the Rod5 fishing rod. You will
need bait to be able to do any fishing. Bait can be bought and/or dug
up by Mogu. The items you gain from these sites are very important to
the game. Note: You equip your hero (from the item screen) with the
Rod5 and bait, and put your hero at the head of the party. Try pushing
buttons while against a well to start fishing.

	Well -	Northwest of Tantar. You gain the Slab telling about
		shrine #4 here.

	Well -	Far west of Agua and east of shrine #3. You gain the
		Dragon Sword here.

	Dock -	This is located in the town of Spring. Go down some
		stairs and walk into the water surrounding the town.
		You head west and climb back onto the land on the other
		side. There is a pond with ducks and a pier. Fish from the
		pier. The Dragon Armor is gained here.

	Well -	West of Gust surrounded by mountains. You have to fly to reach
		it. This is where you find the Dragon Shield.

	Well -	Far southwest of Arad. You have to fly to reach it. It 
		contains the Dragon Helmet.

You can use any bait to fish but you must be using Rod5 to get the
Dragon items.

KARN'S FORMS 
------------

These are various forms of Karn's. With these he can combine with Bo,
Ox, or Gobi to become a new creature that has different abilities and
higher hit points. Note: Karn's form must be leading the party to use
any special abilities available in non-combat situations.

	Shin -	This form can shoot like Bo when leading the part on the
		global map. This form is a combo of Bo and Gobi. You gain
		this form in Gant by pushing a cabinet.

	Doof -	This form is even stronger than Ox. It is a combo of Ox and
		Bo. This form can push aside objects that you couldn't
		before. This is found by having Mogu dig on a dragon mark
                northeast of Camlon.

        Debo -  This is a combo of Gobi and Ox, and can only be activated
	        while underwater.  You get it by pushing an empty crate 
		in Gust at the flute player's house.

	Puka -	There are cement blocks with the impression of a dragon's 
		head on the global map. Puka can breath on them to access
		the caves they cover. Puka has two powerful attack forms
                in combat, breathing and rolling, the later doing about
                double damage (which can also be doubled by 'Slamming'!) 
                Get this form by pushing a cabinet in Bleak with Doof.

CEMENT BLOCKS	
-------------

These are accessed by Puka (a form of Karn's). When Puka breaths on a
cement block, the block will slide to the side and allow you to enter
a cave. The caves contain powerful specialized bracelets. NOTE: Puka 
must be at the head of the party to open the blocks.

	#1) 	North of Auria.  Get the DarkBR here.
	#2)	Southwest of Gust.  Get the LoveBR here.
	#3)	Far southeast of Carmen.  Get the WindBR here.

DRAGON MARKS
------------

You dig with Mogu on these marks on the global map. The marks are
entrances to special caves with bonus items.

	#1)	Northeast of Camlon. This one is very important. You gain
		Karn's Doof form here.
	#2)	East of where you originally found the stone golem. Also far
		northeast of Tuntar.  Find A.,L,V.Potions and Clog here.
	#3)	Somewhere north of Winlan among the islands. You need to be
		able to fly to reach it.  Find V.,S. Potions and Sash here.
	#4)	Next to the Spyre near Spring.  This is the tower entrance.   
	#5)	Northeast of Carmen and south of Spring.  Find HeroBW here.
	#6)	Southern most part of the continent. Far southeast of Scande.
		You need to be able to fly to reach it.  Find S.,A.,L. 
		Potions, MystCW, StarSH, AgileHT, LoveHT, and Life2 here.

INGREDIENTS (for tonic that is supposed to cure Nina's amnesia)
-----------

Root: 		Found just a little south of Gramor, dig by the plant before
		the caves.
C. Nut:		Can be found by having Ox punch any palm tree (a few tries). 
W. Antler: 	Found from shooting a white deer or by searching a stool in 
		the doctor's house in Carmen. This can also be found by
            	digging with Mogu in random locations around Gramor.
P. Fish:	Fish on the bridge to Scande, from the side that Carmen 
		is on.

OBELISK (and where to use the I.Claw)
-------

You get the I.Claw by flying to an island southwest of Tantar. An old lady
on the island would like to talk to another weapons collector. Go back and
forth from her to the old man located far south of her. After a while you 
will receive the I.Claw. 

You can use the I.Claw after Sara and Jade have been defeated and the Obelisk
is floating in the sky. The Obelisk will appear where Scande used to be. 
When you land on the Obelisk you need to have Mogu dig on a crack located
northern most within the Obelisk.

Note: After you defeat Zog it seems you run into a dead end an are unable to
progress. Go to Agua and let Jade activate the goddess Tyr. When you chase
after him you end up in the twin towers of Pagoda. In the Pagoda when you
cross the bridge, enter the right tower, and go down the stairs it looks
like there is a set of stairs you can't reach because of some bars. 
Immediately after you go down the stairs go down and around and enter the
center area. Activate the trigger in the center area and you can reach the
other set of stairs.

GOBI'S SHOP
-----------

Gobi can play merchant by standing behind the counter at Prima
or in Tunlan and pressing 'A' button.  People come up and buy or
sell stuff--if you just want to buy, try storing all of your
saleable items so everyone is a seller.  What they can sell you
depends on what point in the game you are.  There are essentially
3 stages with regard to what Gobi can buy.  Here is a list of all
items and during which stage they can be bought (if you are past
a stage, you can *never* get items from earlier stages).  The
stages are: 

1 = Starts when you first get Gobi
2 = Starts when you first get Bleu
3 = Starts when you first arrive at Scande
* = Means the item is found nowhere else in the game.

  10 74B4-CDD9 Create a new character that starts with Vigor at 50

  Breath of Fire is a Trademark of Capcom Co. Ltd.
  Game Genie codes are from Galoob.


This code comes from TheSpook1
  66BF-C769	8,913020 Exp to start for hero.

Use this at the start of the game along with any stat modifing codes.


The rest I came up with. I've only tried them in their goldfinger form.
  66B5-C769	8,913036 Exp to start for Nina.
  66B2-C769	8,913*** Exp to start for ...    \
  66B7-A769	8,913*** Exp to start for ...     \_  Untried
  66BB-A769	8,913*** Exp to start for ...     / 
  66BE-A769	8,913*** Exp to start for ...    /

Mail one of the maintainers if you verify one of the last 5 codes.
I believe these codes should work. Since the character data storage is
in the same area for all the chars, you can decode the game genie codes
look at nearby addresses to get codes for other stats. 

Use each experience code right before you get each char. After you get that
char, save. You can then enter the codes that affect the next char you are
going to get. That way you don't have to worry about being limited to using
5 codes.


GENERAL HINTS
-------------

Search every big dresser you see. They usually have items to raise stats.
Also search pushable objects like vases, stools, cabinets, etc.--they often
hide important objects as well.

Sometimes the order that you talk to people and do things is very important.
An example is when you need to get the WtrJr in Romero. You need to talk to a
guy in the town who mentions a couple that used to sell something ... Then
you need to visit the couple in the graveyard at night.  The old woman will
give it to you only after you've talked to people in the correct order.

The WtrJr can be refilled in the spring and in Tunlan (by the girl that 
mentions songs can be bottled). It is useful for healing all four of the
fighting party and reviving them if they are dead.

The Earth Key can be used as an item during battle. It does 30 points of
damage to all enemies. This is very useful for Nina since she has a wimpy
attack.

Different shops charge different prices for the same items.  This also
means that shops will pay different prices when selling items.  If you are
going to sell valuable items, find a high priced shop, and vice versa
while buying.

When searching underwater turn Gobi into a fish (you must have the sphere,
saved Prima, and have Gobi as the lead character). That way you won't be
attack by monsters while moving around. 

The Tri-Rang can be found behind Pagoda after Nina learns how to fly
and BEFORE Pagoda has been activated. Search directly behind the twin towers
of Pagoda to find the Tri-Rang.

Gain oodles of exp (9999 exp a shot :) from M.Slimes on the island Pagoda is
on. After a while the M.Slimes will run out and will only show up after a
period of rest. The Hero's Agni spell and Bleu's FireX spell work well against
the M.Slime.  Unfortunately they don't appear with great frequency.

After you get Karn, go back to Agua open the doors that were locked before.
When you get to the top you should be able to reach a scenic place with
where the path forms a cross on the water. On the left and right side of the
cross are two statues of dragons. Search them to gain two very good items.
These are the Life Armor and the Icy Dagger.  The Icy Dagger makes a good
weapon for Karn but can be used during battle to produce a spell effect.
Also check back in Winlan to find the Flame Rapier and in the Auria->Bleak
cave for a G.Bar and other stuff.

After getting Ox, go back to Agua to break down a wall for more treasure.
Also check the Auria->Bleak cave.  Free the B.Rang from Krypt as well, using
Ox--it will be broken though when you first find it.
 
Reportedly, you can get get Chun Li to appear.  To do this, talk to the 
magician in Bleak, and when he asks you if you want to see him perform, 
say yes.  Then when he asks you to put 100gp on the table say yes again.  
When he asks you to turn around, say no twice, then say yes. Chun Li will
appear at this point.

Check by the throne after defeating Jade to discover the Emperor Sword.
Check the righthand pillar in the same room for the Star Hammer.  Use this
in combat to produce *Comet* spell effect!

			BREATH OF FIRE WALK-THROUGH
			--------------------------

This section is a complete walk-through, including all important places, events,
monsters and items you will encounter throughout the game.  If you are
stuck somewhere in the game, check the section in the walk-through and your
question will probably be answered.

STARTING TIPS
-------------

IMPORTANT!!!  Pay no attention to the order of locations listed on the map
foldout that comes with the game.  The numbers are not sequential and have
no relevance to the order in which they are visited.

In combat defeat monsters as quickly as possible, the fewer rounds it takes,
the more EXP and Gold you will receive.

You will notice animals walking around every once in a while.  If Bo is
leading your party, he can fire arrows to kill them.  Buffalo leave Meat,
birds leave W.Meat, deer leave Antlers, and white deer leave W.Antlers.

You will also notice tiny fish swimming off of coasts in some places and
wells throughout the land.  You can fish in these places by equipping your
hero with a Rod and some form of bait.  Note, you can only fish in wells
with Rod5.

Sometimes monsters will leave items, try and remember which monsters leave
useful ones.  Though you won't find any special/unique items or weapons/armor
you can find things like M.Drops (can be found from DogfishX, Mages, and
other things). 

Again, don't forget to search dressers--ALL of them contain an item, some
of which are very useful--Inns are especially common places to find dressers.
Also learn which objects in the game can be pushed--empty boxes, stools,
cabinets, jars, and other things.  These also can hide items (but not always).
Certain types of cabinets can only be pushed by Karn in his Doof form.

Mogu can dig into dirt outside to find random items.  Again there aren't
any unique items, weapons/armor found this way, but some useful stuff may
turn up, like Life, W.Antler, and Cure2.  

Mogu's spell 'Dig' only works if you can dig into the surface you are standing
on.  This spell will automatically get you out of combat.

All of Gobi's spells are offensive attack spells that can be used only
underwater.

THE GAME
--------

Note: Important items and boss creatures are listed in all caps.

1. DROGEN-The city gets burned by Jade and his soldiers-Sara is unable
   to defend it.  Little else of importance in town.  One of the guys
   in the main building can heal you.  The dragon statue will save games.

2. CAMLON-North of Drogen, the king asks you to rid the castle of monsters.
   Bring plenty of antidotes with you.  The fountains (and all subsequent
   ones) can heal all HP/AP and conditions (like poison).  Fight the
   FROG at the end--all monsters will vanish after this.

3. NANAI-The King of Camlon asks you to go to Nanai and destroy the quake
   machine.  Go in at night while the guards are sleeping, be careful of
   those who aren't.  Recommended: buy weapons now before finishing the
   dungeon (including IronRP for Nina in advance).  Find the dungeon in
   the palace and fight KNIGHT at the end.  Get the EARTH KEY and the
   town will be leveled--use this key to produce 3.5 spell effect.

4. WINLAN-Here, the quest shifts to Nina (the Hero is not a player at
   this time).  Equip Nina with better weapons/armor first off.  Find
   two Soldiers to join you in the cave to Romero, while in search of
   the REMEDY for the king.  Get the I.ORE in this cave as well.

5. ROMERO-Find the MAP down a hole in one house by pushing jars (press
   Start outside to view it).  The zombies won't be dealt with until later.

6. FOREST WEST OF ROMERO-Use the EARTH KEY often here.  Search behind some
   trees to find 4 hidden chests.  Red mushroom patches can be eaten to
   recover 10 HP, yellow patches are poisonous.  Find your way through
   to reach Karma.

7. KARMA-Travel up the east tower by defeating MORTE and MORTEA, and cross
   to the west tower where you can Save/Recover.  You will find the Romero
   women and the WIZARD here.  The WIZARD can't be defeated except by the
   Hero.  Return here as the Hero, find the RANG and kill the him.

8. TANTAR/TUNTAR-Now with Hero & Nina go to the twin cities and find the
   smith who will make a SAW (with I.ORE) used to enter the Forest of
   Despair found NW of town.

9. FOREST OF DESPAIR-Use the saw to enter.  Find the hideout where you 
   need to be cautious of pitfalls, and attacks by BOWMEN & LANCERS.  One
   of the chests in the 2nd floor pit room is trapped as well.  When you
   find the Tuntar leader, refuse to follow him several times, he's an
   imposter.  Bo will appear and help you fight the imposter--the GENERAL.

10.MYSTIC WATER CAVE-Return to Romero and talk to people during the day,
   then the old woman at night--she will give you the WTRJR.  Find the
   cave southwest of town (north of Camlon)--you will need Bo to lead
   you through the woods.  In the lowest level you can fill the WTRJR used
   to purify Romero.  You can also return to refill it again and again.

11.AGUA-The chief of Romero will give you the TABLET used to enter Agua.
   Climb to the top and defeat the WISP go get the KNGKEY.

12.STONE CEMETERY-Find the Stone Robot in Stone Cemetery, and enter it via
   left foot.  Find the heart and defeat the GENERAL to activate the teleport
   devices.  Find the brain and use the key to activate the robot.

13.WATER CAVE-After restoring the river with the robot, get the KEY from
   the Tantar chief.  Go to the cave next to the robot, which leads to
   a second cave where the RING can be found (gives +10 attack power).

14.STONE ROBOT ATTACK-Return to Tantar for the wedding, then go outside.
   The Dark Dragons will have taken control of the robot and use it to
   destroy Tuntar.  Reenter the robot and fight the GREMLIN (beware, he
   is very hard to defeat!)  After being able to cross the lava bed, you
   can seek out your first Dragon Training (see notes in FAQ).

15.AURIA-After crossing the dried lava bed you will also find a woodsman
   trapped by faeries in the woods, and a cave leading to Auria.  In Auria
   you can get money by doing a number of tasks.  Get a VITAMIN for a man
   above the shop.  Cure the back ache of a man in one of the houses.  Also
   talk to the mother of the woodsman, then go back and convince the faeries
   to free him to collect a reward.  Don't miss the PRISNCL in the jail, this
   armor gives +20 luck.

16.BLEAK-Go through the cave east of Auria and find Bleak.  Remember to return
   to this cave with Karn and Ox later to claim further treasure.  In Bleak
   you will need to give the Head Thief a G.BAR in exchange for the ICICLE.
   Be careful at the Inn, the keeper will try to steal your money--if you have
   a POUCH, however, he will fail, and pay you to keep quiet about it.

17.ARAD-Travel through the cave near Bleak to reach the desert.  To the south
   you will find Arad, where you need to defeat the SANDWORM in the NE part
   of town to receive the FIFE.

18.KRYPT-Use the FIFE to enter.  Don't open the chests until after Karn has
   joined, most are trapped.  Kill EYESPY and soon after locate Karn.  Take
   Karn down to the bottom and open the 8 coffins, the last one opened will
   have the BOOK needed to open the vault in Auria.  The B.RANG cannot be
   freed until you have Ox.  With Karn you can also return to Agua, Winlan,
   and the cave east of Auria to open locked doors.

19.TOWER OF DARKNESS-Located near Bleak, fight your way to the top and defeat
   the CLOUD to get the DKKEY and the MIRROR.

20.TOWER OF LIGHT-Return to Auria and use Karn to open the vault to save the
   girl.  Use the MIRROR to convince the rich man to give you the LTKEY found
   at the top of the tower.

21.THE VOYAGE-At the docks of Auria you will encounter a KNIGHT and ARCHER
   who will destroy the ship.  Give Gobi a G.BAR for GNPWDR to pass through
   the blocked passage in the cave north of Auria.  Find the Dark Dragons'
   ship and fight your way to the SQUID.  Return to Auria and set sail, where
   you will be attacked again, and you must battle OCTO.  You will be forced
   to sink your own ship and the party will be stranded on an island.

22.PRIMA-Now you are playing as Gobi; travel west from the island to Prima.
   The guild master will tell you to go to Gant.  You can go to the flea
   market here and play merchant (see notes in FAQ).

23.GANT-From Prima go south to find Gant.  You can find the HRGLAS here, as
   well as Karn's spell, Shin, once you have the party reassembled.  Get the
   GOODS and return with them to Prima.   

24.OX-When you return to Prima, give the guild master the GOODS.  He will in
   turn give you the GILLS, so you can get the rest of the party to save the
   injured smith, Ox who is near death.  When you return with the party, 
   fight MORTEO.  Ox will join with you at this point.  With Ox, you can go
   back to Agua and the cave east of Auria to claim treasure.  You can also
   free the B.RANG in Krypt but it is damaged and must be repaired.

25.B.RANG-Once you have freed the B.RANG from Krypt, take it to an old hermit
   who lives far east of Gant--he will identify it and tell you to have it
   repaired in Gant.  Once you rescue the townsmen, you can get it repaired.

26.NABAL-To reach Nabal, travel NW from Prima onto the shore.  You must pass
   through a fort where the Gant men are held--fight TOAD to free them.  Pass
   through a forest after this filled with Grimfowl and a mysterious man
   (you will meet him several more times in the game).  Follow his advice to
   learn how to get into Nabal--seek out the hermit for strategy.  When you
   return to the forest fight a GRIMFOWL, then get the others to follow you
   with the EGG.  Enter Nabal finally, and battle SLIMEX.  The general will
   escape to attack Prima where you will return to receive the STATUE.  Don't
   forget to return to Nabal to find more treasure, including a CLOG hidden
   on the dock.

27.WISDON-You can now enter the moving city of Wisdon, just north of Arad,
   possessing the STATUE.  Find your way through the dungeon and locate
   Bleu.  To wake her, defeat WISP, CLOUD, and MYST.  She will instruct
   you to take the OLDEGG and throw it into a volcano.

28.UNDERWATER VOLCANO-This is found directly north of Prima.  Find the cavern
   with lava and throw the OLDEGG in.  You will appear back at Wisdon, where
   Bleu will join your party.

29.BATTLE AT PRIMA-Now that Bleu has joined, return to Prima and battle the
   Dark Dragons.  You must defeat PINCHER, in return for which the guild
   master gives Gobi the SPHERE, used to transform into a big fish.

30.GUST-Use the SPHERE to cross the chasm underwater.  You can now find Gust
   to the north.  Push a box in the flute player's house to find another
   thief to teach Karn Debo spell (used only underwater).

31.ROD5 FISHING-With the SPHERE, you can also reach Tunlan where if you fall
   down a pit to the left of the vault in the princess's house, you can search
   a box to find the ROD5.  With this you can fish at the wells (three can be
   reached now, see notes in FAQ).  With the DRAGON SWORD, you can also get
   your second step in Dragon Training (also see notes in FAQ)

32.CORT'S LABORATORY-Cort's flower has caused everyone in Gust to go insane.
   The lab just north of town has ROGUES guarding several chests.  Once you
   are past them, Cort will shrink your party.  Find the mouse hole to the
   north, and defeat the 3 K.ROACHES.  The mice will give you the M.CURA to
   revert to normal.  Find Cort and defeat RUGAX who is actually Nicholie on
   bad acid.  He will be badly injured after defeating him, and you need the
   OIL to save him.

33.FLY'S CAVE/FROG'S CAVE-First enter the cave in Gust and kill the G.FLY.
   Take its corpse to the Frog's Cave to trade for OIL.  The Frog's Cave is
   found by passing underwater to the far southeast of Gust onto a shore.
   Return to Gust with the OIL.  You will also need to go kill the FLOWERX
   to cure the villagers' insanity.  Get the MAESTRO from the flute player's
   bed now.  Unfortunately Nicholie will have another relapse and must be
   defeated as RUGAX again.  He will be able to repair the bridge finally, but
   Cort will try to stop you from crossing, kill him as he transforms into
   HORNTOAD to pass.

34.GRAMOR-Cross the bridge and travel to Gramor, where the mole people live.
   To save Mogu, you need the BOLSTER found in Tunlan.  You will be given the
   COWL so you can communicate with the people there (along with the MAESTRO).

35.TUNLAN-Talk to the old woman and princess.  Find the combination to the
   lock by returning at night and walking through a crack in the wall to
   spy on the bathing princess.  Go to the vault and get the BOLSTER.  If you
   haven't already, get the ROD5 here--see Item 31. for details.

36.MOGU'S DREAM-Return to Gramor with the BOLSTER and enter Mogu's dream.
   First go to the Tower north of town and meet MOTHRO--run away for now.
   Beware of pressure plates here, green ones cause the walls to disappear,
   red ones make them reappear.

37.POISON CAVE-Go to the cave south of town (still in the dream).  It is 
   blocked by poisonous gas which can generally be detected by bones.  Once
   you find your way through, meet Courage and unite him with Reason, Humor
   Sorrow, Fear, and Anger.  Mogu will join your party at this point.

38.DREAM TOWER-Go back to the tower with Mogu and you will now be able to
   go all the way to the top, where you must defeat MOTHRO.  You will exit
   the dream after this is accomplished.

39.DIGGING-With Mogu seek out the Dragonhead marks in the dirt where he can
   dig to find hidden treasure rooms.  Get Karn's Doof spell, then go to
   Bleak and push a cabinet in the Gypsy's house in Doof form to get Puka
   spell.  As Puka you can open the dragonhead marked stone doors to get
   more treasure.  See FAQ notes for more details.  Also have Mogu dig under
   a strange looking tree south of Gramor to obtain the ROOT.

40.SPRING-Go through the cave south of Gramor to reach Spring.  The town is
   frozen over by magical forces.  To save it head to Spyre to the south.

41.SPYRE-Have Mogu dig to enter the tower.  Search behind two pillars above
   a set of stairs on the first level to find hidden items.  Avoid the exits
   along the walls on higher floors--they will take you outside.  At the top
   you will meet Mote who forces you into his dreamworld.

42.MOTE'S DREAM-Go to the cave north of town.  In the maze area that spins
   you around remember you always remain facing the same way, even after
   being spun.  In the area with the damage zones find a hidden pit to
   access the next section.  In the room full of stairs, take the second
   one to the right of the stairs you entered by.  Fight MOTE for a short
   time until his Conscience shows up.  Now you can defeat him.  You will
   then return to reality and get the SKYKEY--use on the machine to restore
   warmth to the valley.  In Spring you can now fish for the DRAGON ARMOR
   with ROD5.

43.CARMEN-Go through Spring's waterfall cave to find Carmen to the south.
   All the people here have been frozen in time except for Alan.

44.TOCK-Go to the tower east of Carmen and use the arrow warps to reach
   the top, where Cerl will warp you out.  Return to Carmen, and talk to
   Alan.  Now go back to Tock and battle CERL.  She will warp you out yet
   again--go to Carmen.  Next, go to the large tree south of Carmen, and
   get the FRUIT by punching it with Ox.  Take it to Cerl in the fort to 
   the SE, where she will give you the TMKEY, but Goda shows up and the
   fort vanishes along with Cerl and Alan.  Return to Tock where Nina will
   insert the TMKEY to restore Carmen to normal.  She however, will be lost
   in time.  Note: you can return to Tock one more time and find the MYSTSD.

45.NINA-Nina has warped back in time and is located in Tunlan (you may have
   met her before) but she has amnesia.  The mysterious man will appear and
   tell you to visit Carmen and meet the doctor.  The doctor in Carmen will
   make a TONIC to help Nina but needs 4 ingredients (see FAQ notes).  Once
   you have all of these you can get the TONIC as well as the PASS to Scande
   found by talking to the mysterious man under a tree in Carmen (search the
   spot he stands on).  Once you restore Nina she will be able to fly, and
   is (seemingly, but not actually) better in combat.

46.FLYING-Now that you can fly, you can visit many new important places.
   Such places include: new digging spots for Mogu, more Puka doors, more
   wells, the final two Dragon Training locations, the old woman hermit's
   house on an island SW of Tuntar, the location of the TRI-RANG.  See
   notes in the FAQ for more info on all of these points.

47.SCANDE-After getting the pass from Carmen, you can enter Scande, found
   in the middle of the poisonous swampland in the Southwest.  After talking
   to the people here, go the Spring to find the Climber who gives you the
   B.PART.  Take this to Gant for repairs.  With the PARTS, you may take
   the elevator to the top of the Scande Tower.

48.SCANDE TOWER-When you reach the top the mysterious man will visit you
   one more time and tell you to get the D.HRT from Tunlan.  Go back to
   Tunlan and find a woman in one of the houses who gives it to you.  Go
   through the tower and face ZOG.  You can use the D.HRT on him to inflict
   heavy damage but the hero will also take damage (even if he's not in
   combat when used).  After defeating him, you will meet Sara who will
   betray you by giving all the keys to the mysterious man who is actually
   Jade.  You will be trapped gut if you go south, the mole people will
   save you.

49.AGUA-Find your way to the top of Agua (northwest of Romero) where Jade
   and Sara have activated the keys to release Tyr.  The twin towers Pagoda
   will form and can now be entered (teleport or fly).

50.PAGODA-Step on pressure plates to open the doors here, and find SARA,
   who will attack you just when you think she has recovered.  After killing
   her (*sob*) continue on to confront Jade, who blasts the party unconscious.
   You will wake up in Drogen to find out Jade has uncovered Obelisk.

51.OBELISK-It is now floating over where Scande used to be, have Nina fly
   in to enter.  You can not descend however, until Mogu has the I.CLAW
   (see FAQ notes) and learns to use it.  Go to Gramor and talk to the
   Great Digger who teaches Mogu to use the I.CLAW.  Now you can dig into
   Obelisk.  Find GODA, last of Jade's minions and defeat him.  Further in
   the dungeon, all the areas look the same, so be careful about being 
   tricked into thinking you're back at the beginning when you really
   aren't.  Find JADE and destroy him once and for all.  Search by his
   throne to find the EMPORSD, also search by the righthand pillar in
   the same room to find the STARHR.

52.TYR-THE FINAL BATTLE-Step onto one of the two grey buttons in front of
   Jade's throne to descend to a lower level.  Here, you will meet TYR.
   She will ask you if you want a wish, say yes to recover all HP/AP back.
   Then tell her 'No' and you will enter combat--she won't fight back,
   and you will return to talking sequence again.  After talking to her,
   Sara should appear and tell you to use Agni magic.  If you do not, when
   you reenter combat, you will get the 'Bad' ending.  Otherwise, by
   using Agni magic (see FAQ notes on Dragon Training), she will reveal
   her true form--a big 'Alien'-like multi-headed snake creature who
   has lots and lots of hit points and nasty attack forms.  Kill her in
   this form to win the game with the 'Good' ending!
