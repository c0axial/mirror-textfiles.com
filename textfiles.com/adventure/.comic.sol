 "COMIC actually refers to "Captain Comic", a side-scroller PC game
  released on May 1st, 1988 by Michael A. Denio of Peoria, Illinois. It
  was widely distributed via PC BBSs throughout the late 80's / early
  90's, even making it out to our remote 'neck of the woods' in Sask-
  atchewan. It was later re-released for the original Nintendo Enter-
  tainment System (NES) in the early 90's by a company named "Color
  Dreams", *without* Nintendo's official approval. How they avoided
  legal action from Nintendo itself is beyond me. ;)"
