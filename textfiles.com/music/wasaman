THERE WAS A MAN
traditional

THERE WAS A MAN OF DOUBLE DEED
WHO SOWED A GARDEN FULL OF SEED

WHEN THE SEED BEGAN TO GROW
TWAS LIKE A GARDEN FULL OF SNOW

WHEN THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL
LIKE THE BIRDS IT WAS UPON THE WALL

WHEN THE BIRDS BEGAN TO FLY
TWAS LIKE A SHIPWRECK IN THE SKY

WHEN THE SHIP BEGAN TO CRACK
TWAS LIKE A STICK ACROSS MY BACK

WHEN MY BACK BEGAN TO SMART
TWAS LIKE A PENKNIFE IN MY HEART

WHEN MY HEART BEGAN TO BLEED
THEN I WAS DEAD AND DEAD INDEED
