			THE GOTHIC MUSIC LIST
			  last update: 12/9/92
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Again thanx to all who have contributed and send in those
     corrections and new info particularly country of origin. But please no
     e-mail just to say 'hey, but these people aren't Goth and never have 
     been".
     Accept that other people inevitably have widely differing opinions as
     what is and isn't Goth. This is just a list for people who enjoy
     Gothic music and would like to know the names of some other bands to
     check out. It hardly claims to be definitive or even necessarily
     accurate because I have to rely on contributions from numerous other
     people and can't possibly investigate all of these bands myself. The basic
     assumption around here is that any band on the list should be fair game
     for discussion. And no mail to say 'but 'X' belongs on the first list, not
     the second. Bottom line is I do this for _me_ and bands go where i feel
     they should go.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Here's version 23 of the Gothic Music list.
    As always, corrections and additions,comments, etc are
    gratefully accepted. Corey recommends the "Gothic Rock Black Book" and
    "Gothic Rock" by Mick Mercer. It's mostly typical Brit 'journalism' but has
    good history sections and features on the Cult, All About Eve,Fields of
    the Nephilim,the Sisters of Mercy and the Mission. Many of the defunct UK 
    bands only recorded one single so good luck. Only bands that have actually 
    had a piece of music released by a real record company will be listed, no
    bands with only demo tapes.

    any information or comments should go to ieya@byron.u.washington.edu
