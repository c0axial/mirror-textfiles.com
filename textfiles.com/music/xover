All capacitor values are in microfarads ( uF ).
All coil values are in millihenrys ( mH ).

NOTE: as the chart shows, values scale up and down directly, in 
octaves, for changes in impedance of half or double, and by factors of 
ten for frequency factors of ten.  To determine crossover points higher 
or lower than those shown on the chart, select the proper impedance (4, 
8, or 16 ohms) then look up the frequency in the left column that is 
ten times or one tenth of your desired frequency and simply move the 
decimal points to the right or to the left to determine the correct 
values.  Higher frequencies require moving the decimal points to the 
left, and lower frequencies require moving the decimal points to the 
right.

EXAMPLE: 8-ohm crossover for 80 Hz subwoofer will require a 177 uF 
capacitor and a 22.6 mH coil.

CROSSOVER INDUCTORS
     Wire gauges used for winding air-core inductors should be chosen 
so that crossover-associated power losses are minimized.  Look at the 
wire table to get an idea of the approximate added resistance you will 
have when using a particular wire gauge to wind inductors.  This added 
resistance not only spoils amplifier damping factors, but can also de-
tune vented low frequency loudspeaker systems.  Use the heaviest gauge 
double formvar insulated wire possible for winding inductors.  If you 
are buying ready-made inductors, don't be misled; the coil in the 80 Hz 
subwoofer example above would be 100-200 mm (4"-8") in diameter and 
weigh from 2 to 8 kg (4-16 lb) depending on wire gauge.  An RF coil 
designed for use in radios may have the same inductance (at high 
frequencies) and be wound on a pencil-sized bobbin with fine wire.  
This type of inductor will definitely not work in a crossover with 
loudspeaker loads connected.
     Make sure your coils are wound tightly with neatly stacked layers 
which produce a winding cross section that is approximately square.  
The bobbin used to wind coils for crossovers should have an inside coil 
diameter which is twice the coil width or thickness, and the outside 
coil diameter should be wound out to four times the coil's width, or 
twice the inside diameter.  After winding, saturate the coil in laquer 
or resin.  After drying, wrap it with stretchable cloth tape and give 
it another coat of laquer.  Keeping the layers stacked neatly and the 
coil cross section square, helps minimize the wire resistance for a 
given inductor value.  
     Use a mounting board made of non-magnetic material such as 
masonite or plywood.  Place coils on your crossover mounting board so 
that all coils are facing each other at right angles to minimize 
magnetic inductive coupling.  Some distance between coils helps reduce 
coupling also.  Keep any coils away from large metal surfaces.  Place 
insulating tubing over coil leadout wires to prevent shorts in case of 
speaker system vibration.  On long leadout wires, clamps or blobs of 
hot glue should be used to dress wires securely to the mounting board.

CROSSOVER CAPACITORS
     Capacitors used in crossovers MUST BE NON-POLARIZED and for best 
sound must have low self-inductance.  High-quality 100-200 volt rated, 
foil wound Mylar capacitors should be used and should be individually 
parallelled by 0.01 microfarad polypropylene or polystyrene capacitors 
to short out the high-frequency self-inductance of coil formed by the 
many layers of foil winding inside.  Capacitors should be placed on the 
crossover mounting board away from heat-producing power resistors.  
Capacitor placement is not critical in terms of electrical operation of 
the crossover, however, capacitors should be attached so that speaker 
system vibration will not break their leads by bending and metal 
fatigue.
