AFL JoyceM We will be talking about SoundSmith soon.  Waiting for our guest
           :)

Dr Teeth   Hey, Parik. Do you still have any notes on the SoundSmith
           format? File format, that is.

AFA Parik  Nothing besides memories, teeth.  :) There is a technote in ADV.
           There is also full source for playing SS songs (both .wav and asif
           insts) inadv.

Dr Teeth   Really? Okay, I'll check it out.

AFA Parik  basically everything you need to play, edit, etc, etc both ss and
           synthlab songs are in the ADV libs.

Dr Teeth   Question---> What is the best file you've come across in your
           listening years?

AFA Parik  one of the mods, teeth.

AFL JoyceM For what program, Teeth?

AFA Parik  I love row-row-row your boat, Popcorn.  Also HouseBeat (500k!)

Dr Teeth   (giving Parik a Shoved-Init)

AFC Brite  the Hallelujah Chorus

Dr Teeth   Hmm. SynthLab, right? I never really check those out....

AFC Brite  oops, wrong program !

AFC Eddie  Why, Brite, how nice of you to say that!  Thanks!

Dr Teeth   And I did mean SS, Joyce

AFC Brite  when I get my new hard drive, I'll have more room to play with SS
           files

AFL JoyceM Jim, He (Dave) told me he would try very hard to make this event.
           If he can't, I have the necessary information.

Dr Teeth   I'm still here, really! It is kind of disconcerting when the Forum
           leader leaves.....

Atomic D   Wasn't sound smith done by Hubiert Aalberts?

Dr Teeth   That's him!

Atomic D   Does he have a publisher?

AFL JoyceM Well, I can see that SevenHills is late....so...let me see if I
           can fill in for them.

Dr Teeth   Yes Atomic. Seven hills is publishing SS 1.0.

AFL JoyceM Okay, as most of you all know, SevenHills will be releasing
           SoundSmith in the next couple of months.  It is still being beta
           tested. Also, it will have (and does have) MIDI input
           capabilities.

           Anyone have a questions, that hopefully I can answer :)

AFA Parik  i'm told SS's midi input is, to put it nicely, awful.   You need
           to have a prerecorded song already playing or somesuch nonesense.    
True?

Dr Teeth   Does SoundSmith add any more and/or better editing tools in 1.0?

AFC Eddie  True, but there's a way around that, Parik.

AFL Marty  I don't know that I'd call it awful.

AFL JoyceM Parik, the inputting with MIDI right now is very awkward.
           (difficult in my opinion), but with the beta version I have, that
           'feature' will be changing.

AFL Marty  Awkward is a good word.

AFL JoyceM I thought so too, Marty :) We are hoping that editing tools and
           other utilites will be featured with SS (how do you like that
           non-disclosure comment - I feel like Apple ) :)

AFA Parik  it sounds like the only thing changed in ss 1.0 is awkard MIDI
           input. and the owner.

Dr Teeth   Well, I just wonder if there will be anything like Track volume,
           etc.

AFL JoyceM Parik, I feel positive that the final release of SS will be a 100%
           improvement over what we now have available.  The Window menu is
           really quite nice, and with input from the beta testers, I am
           sure SevenHills will do the best they can to bring us a super,
           easy to use, edit, program.

AFL Marty  But MIDI input for SS is a big deal.  It's such a drudge to input
           tunes via that spreadsheet thing.

AFL JoyceM Agree, Marty.  and designing MIDI input into a program that didn't
           have it is difficult.

Dr Teeth   SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, MARTY (from someone who canna play a note)

ELECTMUSIC Joyce, any idea on cost of the program?

AFA Parik  is Huibert still programming Soundsmith v1.0?  Or has 7hills taken
           over?

AFL Marty  I was speaking for myself.

AFC Eddie  MIDI capability for SS will mean conversion capability to and from
           other formats.

AFL JoyceM No, Greg....not yet.  I am sure the closer they get to a final,
           releasable version, prices will be discussed.

           I am under the understanding that SevenHills has taken it over,
           but I could be wrong.

AFA Parik  i dunno, my feeling is that if NoiseTracker gets MIDI and editing
           capabilities, or if SynthLAB get editing, it would kick.

ELECTMUSIC I am assuming Joyce, that the Midi Implimentation is the Standard
           Midi File Format?

AFL Marty  That is correct, Joyce.  Dave Hecker posted something to that
           effect in the Seven Hills area.

AFL JoyceM We are hoping so, Greg

AFC Eddie  I doubt if SLab will ever get editing or NT will ever get MIDI.

Dr Teeth   What Seven Hills Area?

Dr Teeth   Or heck, if NT ever gets editing (useful that is)

AFL Marty  Go to APR or AGR and select Direct Connect...

AFL Marty  Seven Hills area is listed there.

AFA Parik  you could, I guess, use SoundSmith to create your songs and
           NoiseTracker to set the instruments.

KimBrennan NT has problems with standard SS files.

AFC Eddie  I doubt if SS will save or load in MIDI file format, Greg.

Dr Teeth   NT doesn't support any commands other than volume and tempo.

ELECTMUSIC Well, how is the Midi Input working at this point?

Nuzz       If someone would write a good MidiSynth editor, I'd gladly
           publish it!

AFC Eddie  It's done in real time recording, Greg.

Dr Teeth   Midi is for performers....

AFL JoyceM Greg, it is very awkward/difficult at this point.

AFC Eddie  Nuzz, we wish!

ELECTMUSIC How accurate is it?

AFL JoyceM We need Parik to write that MS editor!!!  :)

AFL JoyceM Greg, I can't answer that....I don't know.  I can't get the MIDI
           thingie to work well enought.

AFA Parik  i'll pass that duty along to dyajim  :)

Nuzz       Yes Parik" If you write it, they will come"

AFA Andy   Yeah, Go for it Parik.

AFC Eddie  Do it together, Parik and Jim!

AFA Andy   That would even be better, Eddie.

KimBrennan OK. Under 5.04 I found that SS had to have the MIDI device ON and
           connected.  Otherwise it wouldn't work at all.

AFL JoyceM Interesting, Kim....you can leave me E-mail if you would -
           thanks.

KimBrennan It works under 6.0...IMHO better than under 5.04

AFL JoyceM I did....that wasn't the problem, hmmmm, how do I say this, the
           awkwardness of imputting with MIDI was beyond my
           comprehension/ability.

KimBrennan Ok, Joyce, noted. I'll e-mail you

Dr Teeth   I would think that you would have to have a very fast playing song
           to get any kind of an accurate input.

AFL JoyceM I use Floyd's FileTools, and have to disable it before I can run
           SS - otherwise I get dumped.

KimBrennan Hmmm. I don't use FileTools (though I keep meaning to put it in my
           DA folder.

AFL JoyceM I figure one needs to take about 4 hours to do it justice.  I
           really think that once they get some of the awkwardness out of
           the program as we know it today (beta version), it will really be
           a great one.

AFC Eddie  Yes, Filetools will not work with any program in MIDI input.

Dr Teeth   SS .95 takes a LOT of room, I don't see that 1.0 will take any
           less.

AFL JoyceM I know, Eddie...but I can't even run SS with FileTools active.
           For some reason, those two are not compatible.

AFC Eddie  One thing to note:   SS MIDI will never allow changes in note
           duration.

Dr Teeth   The main EXE file is an image of some 700K or so (but only about
           60-70k on the disk.

KimBrennan I noted some menu changes from .95 to 1.0b5

AFL JoyceM Yes, I did too.  I really think that SevenHills is trying.

Dr Teeth   Eddie-You can shorten a note by using STP or fading it to a level
           of 0 and for longer notes you need to use a long sample or a
           looped instrument.

AFL JoyceM I am positive with their abilities.

AFC Eddie  Yes, Teeth, but you can't do quarter notes, half notes, whole
           notes, etc. within a track.

AFL JoyceM Eddie, why is that?

Dr Teeth   However it is possible to play a sampled instrument with a sustain
           loop inside of the sample, so that there is an Attack, a sustain
           and a release just like a model sound wave.

AFC Eddie  Because the basic note length is determined by the instrument
           sample.

           Agreed, Teeth, but that's not precise enough for real
           musicianship.

           Whereas with full MIDI implementation, as in SLab or DTune, you do
           get that.

Dr Teeth   MOD files use them all the time, and
           noise tracker can play them (only in mods though).And I am enough
           of a musician (trombone, baritone, tuba, and a
           smattering of guitar) to know that all music can be represented
           by numbers.

AFC Eddie  Yes, but SS doesn't allow certain numbers!

KimBrennan No sweat, Joyce. Beta testers should communicate between each
           other.

AFL JoyceM Agree :)

Dr Teeth   All 'true musicianship' is is how less lazy you are to get the
           accidentals perfect. What numbers?

AFC Eddie  You can't say, for instance, that one note of a certain inst. will
           be precisely twice as long as the last.

Dr Teeth   Er, I don't understand what you mean, Eddie.

AFC Eddie  Let's say you had a string instrument in Soundsmith and wanted to
           do a one track tune (boring, I know, but just for argument sake).
           And you wanted to play a melody which had some notes longer than
           others.  How do you do it in SS?

Dr Teeth   Am I dealing with a looped instrument or not?

AFC Eddie  Either way.

Dr Teeth   Okay. If it were a slow song, in say largo or so, I would use a
           looped instrument and use STP for rests. If each note followed
           the next, there is a natural attack bewteen each note to
           diferenciate between the two, so that all the notes do not run
           into each other. On a faster song with not really long notes
           (like a dotted whole note), an unsustained instrument works fine,
           and again, when silence is needed, you shove in a STP command
           or turn the volume off at the appropriate time.

AFC Eddie  But what if you wanted one note to be two or three beats longer
           than the last?

AFL JoyceM Our guest has arrived :)

Dr Teeth   Er, what do you mean "longer than the last". In soundsmith, you
           can set out how many spaces to a beat (versus beats to a
           measure). To extend the length of the note you just put the Stp
           or next note that much further down the line. Or are you talking
           about having the decay of one note extend further than the
           duration of the one following it?

SevenHills Hi! Gee, I didn't know you were billing me as an actual guest! I
           woulda quit early to be here on time!

AFL JoyceM No problem, Dave - we are just glad you could make it. Dave, do
           you want to tell us a little about SoundSmith....I am sure I left
           out some important items.

AFC Eddie  Sorry, Teeth, we should allow our guest to go now...  I'd like to
           continue this with you later, tho!

SevenHills You probably covered the "biggie"...MIDI support.

Dr Teeth   Okay, No problem

Dr Teeth   Er, I think that you were beat up on MIDI

AFL JoyceM We did, and I know that some people had some questions that I
           couldn't answer.

SevenHills I'll have to read the transcript when it's posted.  Keep in mind
           that this discussion is about a program that is NOT released, so
           things are still changing. Specifically, MIDI support (being new)
           isn't yet as advanced as we want it.

DanW190    Is SS v1.0 finished or can we still submit suggestions for helpful
           editor commands?

SevenHills You can suggest features for SoundSmith; v1.0 is NOT done (it only
           recently entered beta testing). I obviously can't make any
           guarantees about _when_ a particular suggestion would be
           implemented, but if you've got any, please send them via email to
           "SevenHills" (if we get your suggestions there's a chance for
inclusion; if we don't get them then there's no way
           we can include them).

Dr Teeth   Is there any plans for Global Track volume (where, if wanted you
           could automatically assign track volumes that would let you
           change volume during a song without having to do each note by
           hand?

DanW190    Great, thanks! Do you mean via track or via selection box?

Dr Teeth   Er, via Track I think.

SevenHills Hmmm...Please forgive my ignorance on what the shareware version
           of SoundSmith had...I've been only dealing with the new
           SoundSmith so I might be telling you about something you already
           know, but..

Dr Teeth   It's mostly so you can follow accidentals in music that goes from
           all soft to all loud. Which is almost impossible with SS .95

SevenHills There is a way to highlight a range of notes (or "cells" in the
           spreadsheet) and either (a) apply a certain volume to those
           notes, or (b) Fade in the volume or (c) Fade out the volume.
           So you don't have to change the volume of each note individually.
           Is that what you're after?

Dr Teeth   That's IT!

DanW190    Option A is what I was talking about, that's great! :)

Dr Teeth   How about Fade (From volume) (To volume) Instead of Fade
           completely in or Fade comepletly out?

SevenHills Good suggestion; we'll consider it!

Dr Teeth   I've got millions of em, having to punch in all those 'cells' by
           hand and then doing the post producion on it

ELECTMUSIC Would suggestion be better left in your forum or in AMS?

SevenHills It would be best to email suggestions directly to our SevenHills
           address.

Dr Teeth   How about a 'Cut instrument from track' option. For use with Ian
           Schmidts Modifier (converts Amegia Mod files), so you could
           expand from the MOD's four tracks to the full 15

DanW190    How about a checkbox in the "Fade" dialog that would only place
           the "3xx" volume change command in note boxes that have an
           instrument defined (to eliminate the funny "choppy" sound you get
           when sometimes fading large selections of unsustaining
           instruments?) (or maybe I should just e-mail this stuff?) :)

Dr Teeth   (I didn't know that was what was causing the funny choppy sound,
           hmmmm)

SevenHills Dan, that might be possible, but don't know how it would sound
           (since fading is normally a consistent drop/increase in volume
           over a set amount of time).

DanW190    All I can say is that some selections sound better when you remove
           the 3xx commands from sections that don't have notes playing..
           This happened when fading an entire block, or other size ranges.
           I'll e-mail you the full info.

Dr Teeth   I think that the 'choppy sound is caused by fading a too small
           area.

SevenHills Email would be best because it'll _definitely_ get saved in our
           SoundSmith folder so our SS project manager can deal with it.

           I can imagine a choppy sound could occur fading over too small an
           area, or fading a large area where you've got a few notes here
           and there (because there would be a steady fade during silence,
           then a sudden drop/increase when the next batch of notes was hit.

Dr Teeth   BTW, I'm curious. How much of the program is still Huibert's
           programming?

SevenHills Huibert is still doing 100% of the coding.  He's mainly interested
           in getting MIDI done and releasing version 1.0 ASAP.  We'd like
           to incorporate more feature changes.

DanW190    How about adding resource support for the menus and windows? :)

SevenHills We're trying to find a happy medium that'll satisfy us both.

AFC Eddie  Dave, I'll send you a copy of the transcript of this chat in its
           entirety so you can see all the suggestions.

SevenHills Thanks, Eddie!  I appreciate it!

AFL JoyceM I know it is getting late back east...do we have any more
           questions for Seven Hills?

Dr Teeth   Hmm. Well I know that I could make myself a real nuisance for
           making suggestions. But I'll do them in E mail...

           I do have one more question though

AFL JoyceM Dave, can you stick around a little longer?

SevenHills Sure

Dr Teeth   Huibert sent me a copy of SS1.0 Alpha, and all it does is bomb
           out. Am i mistaken that he changed the format of
           SoundSmith.Config file and that he neglected to send me one?
           (I reason this because I erased my config file from .95 and it
           bombed out at the same place and time) And the config file from
           .95 wont work.

SevenHills I'm checking...

Dr Teeth   Okay..I'm waiting...

SevenHills I don't think so...I don't believe there is a "config" file with
           SoundSmith 1.0b1.

Dr Teeth   Hmmm, weird.

SevenHills There's SndSmith.Sys16, Intro.Music, SndSmith.Screen, DOC.Data,
           Main, and Title.Screen But no "config"...

Dr Teeth   Well all he sent was the "Main" along with the fill .95, so maybe
           therein lies the rub....

SevenHills Remember, it _was_ alpha.  "Main" is where all the changes are
           taking place.

Dr Teeth   True. Or maybe it was damaged in transit, and just 'happens' to
           bomb out at the same place.

AFL JoyceM Dave (SevenHills), I really appreciate you coming by this evening.
           I have to leave early, but both AFA Gene and AFC Eddie will be
           able to help you and the rest of our guests. Again, thanks.

SevenHills Thanks, Joyce!  Sorry I couldn't make it sooner!

AFL JoyceM Thanks all...and nite

Dr Teeth   Any proposed release date, or are you also playing Apple Computer
           on us :)

SevenHills I'd like to go, too...unless there are any other questions?
           Release date:  "When it's done!" ;)

           We'll be watching for all your suggestions!
