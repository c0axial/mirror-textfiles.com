MEMPHIS PEARL (Lucinda Williams & Lorne Rall)
---------------------------------------------
[Each chord is one measure (3/4 time)]
[Maybe in G with a capo at the 2nd fret; I'm not sure]


A       A       D         A     A
Back in Memphis she was a pearl

A       A          D        A    A
She was everyone's favorite girl

D       D           D      A     A   A   A
Now her eyes have a vacant stare

     A            A          D           A     A    A    A
What she wouldn't give to be livin' back there


She married a man when she left home
She wanted someone she could call her own
He was good to her when he wasn't drunk
He'd hold her and tell her how pretty she looked

Back in Memphis where she grew up
The life she knew was just not enough
Back in Memphis when she was a girl
She thought one day she'd own the world

She'd look at the TV and magazines
And she'd believe all the pictures she'd seen
She'd be wearin' silk and perfume so sweet
But those things don't mean much out here on the street

Back in Memphis she had fun
Goin' around, tellin' everyone
She was gonna buy dresses that zip up the side
And wear red lipstick, have a nice car to drive

She bounces her baby on her knee
Sayin' maybe today we'll get lucky, you'll see
I promise it won't always be like this
Come here, sugar, give Mama a kiss

Back in Memphis another time
Didn't look like things would turn out fine
Back in Memphis when she was a girl
She thought one day she'd own the world

Back in Memphis she was a pearl
