Title:				AMERICA		(Simon & Garfunkle)

		C         Bm            Am        G          F
		Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
		C             Bm          Am
		I've got some real-estate here in my bag
		Em                     A              Em          A
		So we bought a pack of cigaretts, and Mrs. Wagner pies
		    G      C      G    A  B C B Am
		And walked off to look for America

		C       B          Am          G            F
		Cathy I said as we boarded the Greyhound in Pittsburg
		C        B            Am 
		Michigan seems like a dream to me now
		G
		It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saganaw
		D    G       D         Cmaj7
		I've gone to look for America

		Cmaj7                        D
		Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
		Cmaj7                                        D
		She said the man in the gaberdine suit was a spy
		G         F#          Em        A        D      Fmaj7
		I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera

		C         B         Am              G         F
		Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in my raincoat
		C              B          Am
		We smoked the last one an hour ago
		G                  A       Em                    A
		So I looked at the scenery, and she read her magazine
		       G    D    G A  B  CB Am 
		An the moon rose over an open field

		C         B       Am             G            F
		Cathy I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
		    C         B          Am
		I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
		G
		Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
		        D   G       D        Cmaj7
		They've all gone to look for America
		        D   G       D        Cmaj7
		They've all gone to look for America
		        D   G       D        Cmaj7
		They've all gone to look for America
