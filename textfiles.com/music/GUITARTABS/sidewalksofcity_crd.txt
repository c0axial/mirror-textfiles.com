SIDEWALKS OF THE CITY (Lucinda Williams)
----------------------------------------
[Each chord is one measure]

G  C(9)  G  C(9)
[intro]

G        D              Am               C
  As you walk along the sidewalks of the city

G           D        Am            C
  You see a man with hunger in his face

G           D                   Am                 C
  And all around you, crumbling buildings and graffiti

G             D                Am       C
  As you bend down to tie your shoelace


Sirens scream, but you don't listen
You have to reach home before night
But now the sun beats down, it makes the sidewalks glisten
And somehow you just don't feel right

G        Em7  C(9)          G
Hold me, baby, give me some faith

G                  Em7    C(9)              G
Let me know you're there, let me touch your face

        G    Em7      G     Em7
Give me love, give me grace

        G            C(9)            C(9)     G    C(9)   G   C(9)
Tell me good things, tell me that my world is safe


You pass by bars with empty stages
Three o'clock drinkers fall by
Chairs are placed on top of tables
As you brush the hair out of your eyes

A woman stops you with a question
So you drop some money in her hand
She sleeps in doorways and bus stations
And you'll never understand

Hold me, baby, give me some faith
Let me know you're there, let me touch your face
Give me love, give me grace
Tell me good things, tell me that my world is safe
