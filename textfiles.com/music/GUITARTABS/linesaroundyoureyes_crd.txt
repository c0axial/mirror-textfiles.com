LINES AROUND YOUR EYES (Lucinda Williams)
-----------------------------------------
[Actually in F#; capo 2]
[each chord (or chords joined by hyphens) is one measure]

E  E  E  E
[intro]
            E                   E                        E     E
There are things about you that make me wanna scream and shout
            E                   E                       B7   B7
There are things about you that make me wanna lock you out
              E                 E
But there's a little thing that drives me wild
E                            E
Something that happens every time you smile
  E                  B7                E    E
I can't get over the lines around your eyes
 
B7                 B7                E - A - E    E - A - E
Lines around your eyes everytime you smile
         B7               B7                    E - A - E    E - A - E
And the way you touch me darlin' just drives me wild
B7                                B7
Sometimes I don't know what we're fightin' about
    A                        A
But that don't mean we can't work things out
         E                        B7                E    E
'Cause I love you darlin' and the lines around your eyes

[instrumental, same chords as verse]

I put my car in gear, and I headed down Highway 10
I was leavin' here, I was never comin' back again
I got about as far as the Texas line
I still couldn't get you off of my mind
'Cause I can't get over the lines around your eyes

Lines around your eyes everytime you smile
And the way you touch me darlin' just drives me wild
Sometimes I don't know what we're fightin' about
But that don't mean we can't work things out
'Cause I love you darlin' and the lines around your eyes
'Cause I love you darlin' and the lines around your eyes
