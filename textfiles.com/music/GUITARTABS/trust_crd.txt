TRUST   by The Cure

Remember to use the capo on 2nd fret:

	Bm                  D                  G       D
There's no-one left in the world that I can hold onto
There is really no-one left at all, there is only you
And if you leave me now, you leave all that we were undone
There is really no-one left, you are the only one

       F#m             G                  D                Bm
And still the hardest part for you to put your trust in me
       F#m             G                  D                A     
I love you more than I can say. Why won't you just believe?


Hopefully someone will get to work over this and produce the tab.
I believe it's not too har if you follow the chords.
About the song, I think it's just too sad and beautiful.
