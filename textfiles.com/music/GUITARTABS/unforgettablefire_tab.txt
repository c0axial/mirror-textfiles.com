A Sort of Homecoming
--------------------

Intro  G6  D2  G6  D2  G6  D2  G6  D2

And you know it's time to go
        G6                   D2
through the sleet and driving snow
                 G6                D2
across the fields of mourning to a
           G6              
light's in the distance
D2             G6       D4 D2

And you hunger for the time
time to heal, 'Desire', time
and your earth moves beneath
your own dream landscape

G      G2 G   G2            D2 D4 D Gii
Oh, ho, ho on borderland we run________
G             G2   G        G2
I'll be there, I'll be there
       D2  D4           D                Gii
tonight, a high road, a high road out of here

the city walls are all come down
the dust a smoke screen all around to see
faces ploughed like fields that once
gave no resistance

And we live by the side of the road
on the side of a hill as the valleys explode
dislocated, suffocated
the land grows weary of it's own

G6                 D2           G6                 D2
O come away, o come away, o come, o come away I say I  hmm hmm
G6                 D2           G6                 D2
O come away, o come away, o come, o come away I say I

G      G2 G   G2            D2       D4               D                     G
Oh, ho, ho on borderland we run, and still we run, we run and don't look back
G             G2   G        G2                D2  D4   D     D4
I'll be there, I'll be there tonight    tonight      tonight
        C7
I'll be there tonight, I believe.  I'll be there so high (land),
                         D     D2     G6  D2
I'll be there tonight, tonight____________

G6                D2                G6 			D2
O come away, I sing  I say, um ha,  o come away oh say.
G6                D2                G6 			D2

                   G6 
The wind will crack in wintertime
D2	        G6
this bomb-blast lightning waltz
D2        G6            D2  G6        D4  D   G   G2     G   G2
no spoken words, just a scream . . . yeah.... oh........ oh..... 
  D2          D4	      D       		    Gii
tonight we'll build a bridge across the sea and land
G              G2
see the sky burning rain
   G   	         G2           D2  D4 D Gii  G6  D2  G6  D4 D  G6  D2  G6  D4 D
she will die and live again tonight_______

And you heart beats so slow
through the rain and fallen snow
across the fields of morning
to a light that's in the distance
Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep
for tonight, at last
I am coming home
I am coming home

Pride (In the name of love)                     [Capo on 1st fret]

Intro chords  A A G Em

 A                   D
One man come in the name of love,
 G               Em
One man come and go.
 A                   D
One come here to justify,
 G               Em
One man to overthrow,
 A                   D
In the name of love,
 G               Em
What more in the name of love.

One man crawled on a barbed wire fence,
One man he resist.
One man washed on an empty beach.
One man betrayed with a kiss.
In the name of love,
What more in the name of love.

Early morning, April 4.
A shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life,
But they could not take your pride.
In the name of love,
What more in the name of love.

Dm             Bb
Ice, your only rivers run cold
           Dm                    Bb
These city lights, they shine in silver and gold

Walk on by, walk on through, walk till you run
               Bb                Dm         Bb 
And don't look back, for here, I am

Face to face, in a dry and waterless place
C                               Eb                          Bb

Come on take me away
                Gm
Come on take me away
                A           Dm
Come on take me home, home again

Instrumental

(Now I'm at the part where the violins repeat the chords three times,
sounding like "da-Da-DA")

           F                      C
And if you save it all, save your love

      Gm                     A                Dm
Don't push me too far, don't push me too far, tonight, tonight

Promenade

 C                       F-C
Earth, sky, sea, and rain
                         F-C
Here she comes back again.
                         F-C
Men stroll, sneak the hall
                         F-C
Words that build or destroy.
                F    C     F-C
Dirt dry bones and stones.

 C                       F-C
Barbed wire fence cut me down,
I'd like to be around.
In a spiral staircase
                Am           G
to the higher ground.
                Am           G
And I like a firewall and explode.
        F                    C
Roman candlelightning lights up the sky.

In cracked streets, trample underfoot
Sidestep, sidewalk.
I see you stare into space.
Have I gotten closer now,
behind the face.
Tell me, will you dance with me,
and turn me around tonight.
Up though the spiral staircase to the higher ground.

See slide show, see side town,
coca-cola, football, radio radio radio . . .

Now, the chords appear below the words.  I suggest you use tab riff as shown
above for the main verse, but you can always try it with the chord
formations at the end of this file to get a more acoustic feel.

If    you twist and turn away.
Asus4 A   Asus4 A   Dsus2 D    Dsus2  D

If    you tear yourself in two   again.
Asus4 A   Asus4   A        Dsus2 D     Dsus2  D

If I  could, yes I would
Asus4 A      Asus4 A

If I     could, I would let it go.
   Dsus2 D       Dsus2 D

	         Surren   - der,         dislocate.
Asus4 A  Asus4 A    Dsus2   D   Dsus2  D

Asus4 A  Asus4 A  Dsus2 D  Dsus2  D

If     I could throw this lifeless
ASus4  A       Asus4     A

Life- line to the wind.
Dsus2 D		       Dsus2 D

       Leave this heart of clay,
Dsus D	          Asus4    A

See you walk, walk away,
Asus4   A         Dsus2  D

      Into the night.
Dsus D        Asus4  A

        And through the rain.
Asus4 A     	       Dsus2   D

      Into the half-light,
Dsus D        Asus4  A

        And through the flame.
Asus4 A     	       Dsus2   D   Dsus2 D

If I could throw myself,
set your spirit free.
I'd lead your heart away,
See you break, break away
Into the light.
And to the day.

(Here, suggested start jamming with regular A and D chords)
Hoo, hoo    Hoo, hoo   Hoo, hoo.    
A          	       D 

Hoo, hoo    Hoo, hoo   Hoo, hoo.    
A          	       D 

To let it go,
  	      A

And so to fade away.
          D

To let it go,
  	      A
 
And so fade away.
          D

I'm wide awake.
               A

I'm wide awake.   wide awake,       
	       G             E	    (Now switch back to chords from intro)

I'm not sleeping.
Dsus2   Asus4 A

Oh, no, no.

If you should ask then maybe
They tell you what I would say.
True colors fly in blue and black,
Bruised silken skies and burning flag.
Colors crash, collide in blood shot eyes.
A                                   D	  (Once again, regular chords now)

Hoo, hoo    Hoo, hoo   Hoo, hoo.    
A          	       D 

If I could, you know I would.

If I could, I would let it go.
This desparation.
Dislocation.
Separation.
Condemnation.
Revelation.
Temptation.
Isolation.
Desolation.

Let it go,
And so to fade away.
To let it go,
And so fade away.
Oh, no
I'm wide awake.
I'm wide awake.
I'm not sleeping.
Oh, no no
