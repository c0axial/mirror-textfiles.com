CRESCENT CITY (Lucinda Williams)
--------------------------------
[Actually in E, I think; capo 4.]

            C          C                          G             G
Everybody's had a few;  now they're talking about who knows who
                        Am                 F                       G   G
I'm going back to the Crescent City, where everything's still the same
                           C           C                   G            G
This town has said what it has to say;  now I'm after that back highway
                  Am                F                    G   G
And the longest bridge I've ever crossed, over Pontchartrain

                    Dm        Dm            G       G
Tous les temps sont temps (?),  that's all we'd say
            Dm  Dm           G   G
We used to dance  the night away
          Dm     Dm          G   G
Me and my sister,  me and my brother
           Dm  Dm            G    G
We used to walk  down by the ri - ver

Mama lives in Mandeville; I can hardly wait until
I can hear my Zydeco and "laissez les bons temps rouler"
And take rides in open cars; my brother knows where the best bars are
Let's see how these blues'll do in the town where the good times stay

Tous les temps sont temps (?), that's all we'd say
We used to dance the night away
Me and my sister, me and my brother
We used to walk down by the river
