Earlier this week I posted a request for Peter Gabriel's "Solsbury Hill",
and a number of folks either sent the "nevada" version or directed me
there.  (Thanks everyone!)  It turns out that though the chords on "nevada"
are basically right, the tab for the instrumental bits weren't even close. 
Also, the display of the chords over the lyrics was misleading.  So, I
worked on it in order to improve the tab.  The lyrics come from
'/pub/music/lyrics/g/gabriel.peter/volume.1'....I made some real minor
modifications.  I'll send this to nevada after I've posted it.

The song IS in the key of B, but the capo should be on the FOURTH fret
rather than the second.  It makes it sound a lot better!  The chords of the
instrumental bits tend to be rapidly arpeggiated (perhaps they're
finger-picked, but I do better flat-picking quickly...), and the chords of
the verses are strummed, with some light appregiation prior to each vocal
phrase.  [The vertical bars represent phrases, not actual measures].

                Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
                                        Em     D     Em  
                I could see the city lights
                                        Em     D     Em
          Wind was blowing, time stood still
                                        G      D     G
                 Eagle flew out of the night
	                                       G      D     G
                 He was something to observe
                                        Em     D     Em
              Came in close, I heard a voice
	                                       Em     D     Em
             Standing stretching every nerve
                                        Cmaj7  D        Cmaj7
		               Had to listen had no choice  I did not believe the
information
               D               Cmaj7
              [I] just had to trust imagination
                D        Cmaj7
               My heart going boom boom boom
                         D   C  G          D            C       D        G
              "Son," he said   "Grab your things, I've come to take you
home."

Instrumental: Section A (1X), then Section B (1X)
 
To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
"Hey" he said "Grab your things
         I've come to take you home."
<Back home.>

Instrumental: Section A (1X), then Section B (1X)

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No on taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
"Hey" I said "You can keep my things,
          they've come to take me home."
