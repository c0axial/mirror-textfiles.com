HOT BLOOD (Lucinda Williams)
----------------------------

       E7                                     E7
Just a shakin' in my knees, just a cold chill

      E7                                     E7
Don't know what it is, just call it a thrill

       E7                                E7
Just a lump in my throat, just hot blood

      E7                                 E7
Don't know what it is, some call it love


       A7                   E7
Well I saw you out in your car

            A7 (C?)            C7 (Gm?)     E7   E7   E7   E7
You had the top down, you were drivin' real slow


Well I saw you in the grocery store
Buyin' tomatoes for a casserole

Well I saw you in the laundrymat
Washin' your clothes, gettin' all the dirt out

Well I saw you with your car broke down
Fixin' your flat with a tire iron




[I'm not entirely sure about the chords at the end of each verse.]


[I'm also not sure if Lucinda uses a capo on this song or not; anyway, 
here's the bass part from the intro (and the rest of the song):]
