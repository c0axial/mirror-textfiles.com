PASSIONATE KISSES (Lucinda Williams)
------------------------------------
  * Lucinda Williams' recording of this song is in E, so you'd have to put
a capo at the fourth fret to match the recording if you use these chords.
  * In the instrumental bits, I put bar lines (|) to separate measures;
everywhere else in the song, one chord is one measure.
  * The rhythm guitar doesn't actually play all those chords in the intro,
but it sounds neat.
  * Mix up some (9)'s with the C's and F's.

[intro; play twice]

C            G
   Is it too much to ask?
         Am7                        F
I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
C          G
   Food to fill me up
    Am7              F
And warm clothes and all that stuff
 
C                   Em7
   Shouldn't I have this,
                 Am7
Shouldn't I have this?
                 F
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
 
C             F
   Passionate kisses
C             F
   Passionate kisses, whoa ohh oh
C             F
   Passionate kisses from
C  C(addF)  C  |  G  G(addE)  G  |  Am  Am(9)  Am  |  F  |
you [instrumental]
 
Is it much to demand
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think

Shouldn't I have this,
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa ohh oh
Passionate kisses from
you [instrumental twice]

Do I want too much?
Am I going overboard to want that touch?
I shouted out to the night:
"Give me what I deserve, 'cause it's my right"

Shouldn't I have this,
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa ohh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa ohh oh
Passionate kisses from
you [instrumental twice; end on C.]
