   I could tell the meaning of a word like serene,
 D                            G        A
   I got some `O' grades when I was sixteen,----
 D                                  G             A 
   I can tell the difference 'tween margarine and butter,
 D                                  G           A  
   I can say "Saskatchawen" without starting to stutter.
         A          D            G               D          A  
   But I can't understand why we let someone else  rule our land,

   we're cap in hand.
 D                               G          A
   I could get a broken jaw from being in a fight,
 D                          G            A
   I know it's evening when day turns to night,
 D                           G           A
   I can understand why Stranraer lie so lowly,
 D                                    G             A
   They could save a lot of points by signing Hib's goalie.
         A          D            G               D         A

   NC           D
   we're cap in hand.

 G    D     A           D
   We fight   when they ask us,
 G    D     A         D
   We boast   then we cower,
 G    D   A       D 
   We beg   for a piece of
 G                                                    A
   What's already,  what's already,   what's already, ours.

   Once I thought I could make God a bribe,
 D                 G           A 
   So I said I was in His lost tribe,
 D                      G         A
   Getting handouts can be so frustrating,

Across the ocean to the second chance

I wonder how it got on when it reached the promised land?

The way you felt the day you sailed from Wester Ross to Nova Scotia.

F
I wonder my blood, will you ever return

Do we not love her?  Do we not say we love her?
      Am                        Em        F       Am  Dm  G
Do we have to roam the world to prove how much it hurts?

Come back ho wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wome

Hey Kristan -

I had a listen to this just before I fell asleep last night, so I THINK
this represents some semblance of how the chords go.  Perhaps the
dedicated Scotsman who has posted other Proclaimers tunes has a better
take on it.  For those who aren't familiar with this tune, it's the one
from the opening credits of the film "Benny and Joon".  Really knocked
me out of my seat when I saw the flick.  This is the key the song is
played in on the album "Sunshine on Leith", but you can always transpose
if barring a nice fat B is a pain (e.g., E=G, A=C, B=D).  Enjoy!
