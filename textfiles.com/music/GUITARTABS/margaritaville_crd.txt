Title:				MARGURITAVILLE			(Jimmy Buffet)

		C
		Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake
		                                  G
		All of those tourist covered with oil
		
		Strummin' my six string, on my front porch swing
		                                        C
		Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil

		F        G                 C            G
	CHORUS:	Wastin' away again in Margurita-ville
		F                G              C      G
		Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
		F           G                    C G      F
		Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
		      G                  C
		But I know it's nobody's fault

		C
		I don't know the reason, I stayed here all season
		                                   G
		Nothin' to show but this brand new tatoo
		
		But it's a real beautie, a Mexican cutie
		                                C
		But how it got here I haven't a clue


		CHORUS

		C
		I blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop-top
		                                  G
		Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
		
		But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render
		                                         C
		That frozen concotion that helps me hang on


		CHORUS

		F           G                  C G      F
		Some people say that there's a woman to blame
		      G                     C
		But I know it's my own damn fault
