Oops, I got the words wrong, silly me.


B     A  C#m B    F#m G#m B

           A                          E
Oh it's so funny to be seein'ya after so long girl
             A                              G#m          C#m B
and with the way you look I understand that you are not impress
A                                G#m       C#m
 But I heard you let that little friend of mine
D                    B
 take off your party dress
A                  G#m      C#m    B
 I'm not gonna get too sentimental like those 
A                   G#m  C#m B
other sticky valentines
A                                G#m        C#m
 'cause I don't know if you were lovin' somebody
  D                  B
I only know it isn't mine.

A  E      A         B        G#m     C#m  B
Alison, I know this world is killing you, oh
A  E   A   B      E
Alison, my aim is true.

Well I see you got a husband now
did he leave your pretty fingers lyin' in the weddin' cake
You used to hold him right in your hand
but it took all he could take
Sometimes I wish I could stop you from talking when I
hear the silly things that you say
I think somebody better put out the big light
'cause I can't stand to see you this way

Alison, I know this world is killing you, oh
Alison, my aim is true,
D   B      E  A D   B      E
 My aim is true, my aim is true ...
