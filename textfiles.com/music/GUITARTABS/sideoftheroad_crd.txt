SIDE OF THE ROAD (Lucinda Williams)
-----------------------------------
  Each chord is half of a measure.
  The song is recorded in E, but I play it in C, capoed up 4 frets.
 
C   G   Am   F   G   G
[intro]
C     G           Am         F           G      G
  You wait in the car on the side of the road
C       G             Am             F                       G        G    G  G
  Lemme go and stand awhile, I wanna know you're there but I wanna be alone
Dm   F          C         G
  If only for a minute or two
Dm        F                      C         G
  I wanna see what it feels like to be without you
Dm        F                 C      G
  I wanna know the touch of my own skin
Dm  F                C         G    G    G    G
  Against the sun, against the wind
 
I walked out in a field, the grass was high, it brushed against my legs
I just stood and looked out at the open space and a farmhouse out a ways
And I wondered about the people who lived in it
And I wondered if they were happy and content
Were there children and a man and a wife?
Did she love him and take her hair down at night?
 
If I stray away too far from you, don't go and try to find me
I doesn't mean I don't love you, it doesn't mean I won't come back and
   stay beside you
It only means I need a little time
To follow that unbroken line
To a place where the wild things grow
To a place where I used to always go
 
La la la,  la la la,  la la la, la la la 
La la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
If only for a minute or two
I wanna see what it feels like to be without you
I wanna know the touch of my own skin
Against the sun, against the wind  [The song ends on G.]
