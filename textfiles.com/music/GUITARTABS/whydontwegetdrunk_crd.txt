Why Don't We Get Drunk
======================
By Marvin Gardens (As performed by Jimmy Buffett)


      D             D7             G              D     
      I really do,  appreciate  the fact you're   sittin' here.
      D                  G                       E7     
      Your voice sounds  so wonderful   but your face don't
             A7
      look too clear.
         G                          D
      So barmaid bring a pitcher,   another round o' brew,
           G                A          D        D7
      Honey why don't we get drunk and screw...

(Chorus:)      
          G               A          D      
          Why don't we get drunk and screw?
          E7                             A7
          I just bought a waterbed filled up for me and you.
              G                  
          They say you are a snuff queen, 
                 D
          Honey I don't think that's true.
               G               A          D
          So,  why don't we get drunk and screw.

     I just bought a waterbed (it's) filled up for me and you.(**)
     They say you are a snuff queen,
     Honey I don't think that's true.
     So, why don't we get drunk and screw?  
      Yeah, now baby I say, "Lord!," (*)
     Why don't we get drunk and screw.
