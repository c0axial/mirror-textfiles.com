PINEOLA (Lucinda Williams)
--------------------------

[Each chord is half a measure]
[The G's are actually G5's, I think.  Play them 320033 or 3x0033.]

G  F  C  G  G  G  G
[intro]

     G                   F                     C                  G
When Daddy told me what happened, I couldn't believe what he just said
      G                   F             C                      G     G
Sonny shot himself with a .44, and they found him lyin' on his bed
  G                 F               C                      G
I could not speak a single word, no tears streamed down my face
       G                F                  C                  G    G
I just sat there on the living room couch, staring off into space

Mama and Daddy went over to the house to see what had to be done
They took the sheets off of the bed, and they went to call someone
Some of us gathered at a friend's house to help each other ease the pain
I just sat alone in a corner chair, I couldn't say much of anything

We drove on out to the country, his friends all stood around
Subiaco Cemetery is where we lay him down
I saw his mama, she was standing there, and his sister, she was there too
I saw them look at us standing around the grave, and not a soul they knew

Born and raised in Pineola, his mama believed in the Pentecost
She got the preacher to say some words so his soul wouldn't get lost

[instrumental, same chords]

Some of us, we stood in silence, some bowed our heads and prayed
I think I must've picked up a handful of dust and let it fall over his grave
I think I must've picked up a handful of dust and let it fall over his grave

[fade-out on G F C G etc.]
