remarks this was a Robert Johnson piece, so keeping this
in mind ... here's  Love in Vain

Well, this is by no means complete TAB, but it's such fun just to play the 
intro that I figured I'd post it. Keith probably used some wierd tuning and 
played it completely different!  You might have to do some muting on that funny chord.
Also, I have no idea what the "real" key is on the record.

Thanks for the post.  I have chords (things I got by ear :--));
I think sometimes the Stones were underrated, particularly when
Mick Taylor was with them (he had worked with John Mayall (sp?)
who Clapton and others had also worked with).  In any case, here's
what I got from their live recording.  You might like some of
the twists (suspensions and stuff).

Do you know the words?  It was the words I have the biggest
problem with.  I cannot understand some of what Mick Jaggar
says.  He's incomprehensible.  Perhaps he forgot the words and
mumbled something?

In the meantime, here's some other chords to try on that song.
Hope you like them...

In article <9305251706.AA01139@snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca>, you write:

Should be:

 -|-----------------x---x-----------------------------------------------
 -|-----------------15--14-----------------------------------------------
 -|-----------------14--14-----------------------------------------------
 -|-----------------14--14--5--7--7--9--9*-7--7--9-----------------------
 -|--5--7--7--9--7--xx--xx--5--5--5--5--5--5--5--5-----------------------
 -|--5--5--5--5--5--xx--xx-----------------------------------------------

	*This '9' is sometimes a '5' on the live version.

 -|-----x---x-----------------------------------------------
 -|----14--12---7---5---------------------------------------
 -|----14--14---7---5---------------------------------------
 -|----14--14---7---5---------------------------------------
 -|----xx--xx----------5---7---7---9--9---10---10---9-------
 -|----xx--xx----------5---5---5---5--5----5----5---5-------

The 'A' chord (you're playing the 1-5-8 version with no 3rd --
not major or minor) is actually two chords, a suspension that
resolves to the major -- played at the 12th fret (drag).

Once it gets to the break, there's the two chord da Daahh da Daahh
stuff... those chords are

------------------
------7-----------
------7------5h6--          (Do various riffs here)
------7------5----
---7--5---7--7----
---5--5---5--5----

The 5'th fret on the D string is a min 7 interval making the
major a dominant 7.  The 5h6 is a hammer-on (gives it that
bluesy feel).

I was bitten by a boar. 
I was gouged and I was gored.
But I pulled on through.
I am a sack of broken eggs.
I always have an unmade bed.
Don't you?
Well, I hope we're not too messianic or a trifle too santanic.
We love to play the blues.

I  have to turn my head until the darkness goes

Fm                       C7
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
Fm                            C7
With flowers and my love both never to come back
Fm  Eb         Ab                   Fm
I   see people turn their heads and quickly look away

It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
Fm                            C7
I could not forsee this thing happening to you

If   I look hard enough into the setting sun

Ruby Tuesday
Rolling Stones

Am        C     F         G        C
She would never say where she came from
Am         D     F      C       G
Yeasterday don't matter if it's gone
Am        D7     G      Am        D7      G
While the sun is bright or in the darkest night
           C      G
Noone knows, she comes and goes
C      G   C                       G          C
Good - bye Ruby Tuesday, who could hang a name on you
C         G          Bb    F
When you change with every new day
G               C        G
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
Tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained to a life where nothings gained
And nothings lost, at such a cost
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday, who could hang a name on you
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

There's no time to lose I heard her say
She'll cash your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time, lose your dreams and you'll lose your mind
Aint life unkind
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday, who could hang a name on you
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Just Bob

Salt of the Earth by Jagger and Richards
-----------------
(keith sings four lines)
E    B             E           A E (repeat)
lets drink to the hard working people
lets drink to the lowly of birth
raise your glass to the good and the evil
lets drink to the salt of the earth
(mick sings the rest)
say a prayer for the common foot soldier
spare a thought for his back breaking work
say a prayer for his wife and his children
who burn the fires and who still till the earth

(E A) (E A) (E A) (E) (E)
C#m                 G#m     (repeat)
and when i search a faceless crowd
a swirling mass of gray and
F#m
black and white
G#m
they don't look real to me
A                     B(7)
in fact, they look so strange
(B(7))

raise your glass to the hard working people
lets drink to the uncounted heads
lets think of the wandering millions
who need leaders but get gamblers instead

spare a thought for the stay at home voter
his empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
and a parade of the gray suited grafters
a choice of cancer or polio

and when i...

lets drink to the hard working people
lets think of the lowly of birth
spare a thought for the rag taggy people
lets drink to the salt of the earth

lets drink to the hard working people
lets drink to the salt of the earth
lets think of the two thousand million
lets think of the humble of birth

Hi Steve,
  I love that song too.  I'll try to roughly TAB/TALK you through it.

The opening riff is off the opening E minor chord and goes roughly like
this

E-----2-3-0-2--0---------------
B----------------3--0----------
G------------------------------            repeat for intro
D--2----------------------2--2-
A--2----------------------2--2-
E--0----------------------0--0-

So... The intro is a held out E minor.

Emin       C               G        B                      Emin
Seven more days, she'll be coming.  I'll be waiting at the station
Amin                                B
For her to arrive.  Seven more days all I got to do is survive.

and the other change is

Amin                           Amin
There's kissing in the valley, thieving in the alley
B                          Emin
Fighting every inch of the way.
Amin                         Amin
Trying to be tender with somebody I remember
     B                                                      Emin
In a night that's allways brighter than the day.      Seven Days.


Hope this helps.  All off the top of my head and I haven't played this
one in a couple of years.
   BTW, how's your open tuning playing going?  Check out my sig for a
good riff.
                    -Jim

Here are some chords, the way Wood does it is similiar but not the
same. (anyone have any ideas?)

sevan days 

EM             C			G
sevan days , sevan long days she'll be comin'
           B7           EM
I'll be waitin' at the station
AM                       
for her to arrive
B7					EM
sevan long days, all I gotta do is survive   

She been gone, ever since I been a child, 
ever since I seen her smile
I've never forgotten her eyes

She had a face that outshined the sun and the sky

I've been good, i've been good while i've  been waitin' 
forgive for hesitating, 
but i've been hangin on
sevan more days and all that will be gone

there's kissin' in the alley, theiving in the alley

fightin' every inch of the way

trying to get a lead on, providing the feat on
the nights are always sadder than the days

sevan days , sevan days the wind is knowin'
the whistle will be blowin'
and I know she'll be coming for
my beautifull comrade from the north.

repeat last first.

	OOOPS! I should have added that you need to capo your guitar
to the second fret, and play the tab as open strings.

Anyone who attempts this one, I would really appreciate your feedback
because I'm tabbing it quickly and I may well have made some mistakes.
I CRDed the whole song because the chords change from verse to verse.
There are of course other little twiddly bits than the 2 fills I've
tabbed, but I'm sure you'll get the picture...

I'm not even going to attempt to tab Ry Cooder's slide guitar for
this- are there any tab conventions for slide?

The original studio version is played on 2 acoustic guitars, one in
standard tuning and one in open D (DADF#AD).  The main guitar is the
open D one.

Intro:

  C                    F/C                      C
--10-10----------------10-|10-------10----------10-|
--10-10----------------10-|10-------10----------10-|
--10-10----------------11-|11-------11----------10-|  repeat
--10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-|10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-|
--10-10-10-10-10-10-10-12-|12-12-12-12-12-12-12-10-|
--10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-|10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-|

This is all the way through the verse.


Chorus is different:

G   Gsus9    G           Gsus9
But what can a poor boy do

  G                         Gsus9
except to sing for a rock'n'roll band

G      Gsus9  G                            Gsus9 G
Cos in sleepy London town there's just no place  for

                D
Street Fighting Man

Chords here:  G          low { 5 5 5 5 5 5 } high
              Gsus(add9) low { 5 5 7 6 5 5 } high
              D          low { 0 0 0 0 0 0 } high


The second acoustic guitar doubles the first, playing C and F in the usual
way, but tacet in chorus.

|C    |F    |C    |F     ;(intro; repeat to taste)
			 (don't forget to play only the C bass note)

|Am                     |F            |G                         |C

I'm just standin' in a doorway

1. Out of these girls        passing by, the tales they tell of men

|G          |         |C          |
I'm not waiting on a lady                    

|G          |               |C       |  (return to $ for second verse)
I'm just waiting on a friend

2. A smile relieves a heart that grieves,
   remember what I said.
   I'm not waiting on a lady,
   I'm just waiting on a friend.

(after second verse, this bridge:)

              |C        |F                  |C
... on a friend       I'm just waiting on a friend

|F                 |C               |F                  |C
 just waiting on a friend.        I'm just waiting on a friend,

    |F                |C        |F                 |C    
I'm just waiting on a friend,     just waiting on a friend

(instrumental for 16 bars, just alternating F and C, one measure each, and 
soloing away, then return to "$" for the last two verses)


3. Don't need a whore, don't need now booze,
   don't need a virgin priest.
   But I need some one I can cry to,
   I need someone to protect.

4.  Ooh, making love and breaking hearts,
    It is a game for youth.
    But I'm not waiting on a lady,
    I'm just waiting on a friend.

(repeat bridge, fade instrumental...)

This song is excellent fun to play... hope the notation is not too cryptic.
Don't forget to emphasize the "C" bass note in the intro and bridge...

Here's another hint to help you get that strummed melody at the
beginning:

         C(add9)  Dm Fmaj7
e--------------------0---
B-------3-3-3-3---3--1---
G-------0-0-0-0---2--2---
D-------2-2-2-2---3--3---

The first two chords are the Csus2 and a Dm that sneaks in
for one strum before the F.

Hope this helps.

I don't know the whole song, but I know some bits. Here's the 
opening:

  C(add9)  F
--0-0-0-0--1-----1--------
--3-3-3-3--1-----1--------
--0-0-0-0--2-----2--------
--2-2-2-2--3--x--3--3-----
--3-3-3-3-------------2-3-
--------------------------

8 times

(I haven't figured out the verse yet)

This part is in the bridge, after "I'm just standing in a doorway", and
after "I'm just trying to make some sense":

  C(Add9) C 
--0-0-0---0-
--3-3-3---1-
--0-0-0---0-
--2-2-2---2-
--3-3-3---3-
------------

I hope this is a good start. I play along with the tape, and it sounds 
accurate.....maybe with a couple transfusions I could figure out the rest :)

The original version of this is 3 guitars.

Acoustic 1 ("Nashville tuning"- low 3 strings an octave up)
   this is the one which starts the song off, there are no bass
   strings which gives it that high sound.  After the intro it
   mainly plays harmonics

Acoustic 2 (Open G- D G D G B D)
   this is the main acoustic throughout the song.  If I get some
   requests I will put this part down.

Electric 3 (Standard tuning)
   this is Mick Taylor's classic backing and superb solo.  If I get
   _lots_ of requests I might summon the energy to tab the solo, if
   I get hundreds I might even tab the whole part.

For now, I will just do CRD.  Despite having 3 guitars on the original
recording, this one sounds surprisingly full with just 1 acoustic
(standard tuning) and voice.

Intro:
   G  Am7  G  Gsus  Am7  G


   Bm         G   Gsus  Bm           G   Gsus
1.  Childhood living      is easy to do
   Am          G   C      D  G   Gsus        G     D  Dsus2  D  C
    The things you wanted    I   brought them  for you
   Bm         G    Gsus   Bm              G  Gsus
    Graceless lady         you know who I am
   Am          G     C       D  G  Gsus         G  D Dsus2 D
    You know I can't let you      slide through my hands

   Am     G  C      D  G         F       G  C     Bm
Ch. Wild     horses     couldn't drag me a- way
   Am        G  C      D G         F       G  C
    Wild wild   horses    couldn't drag me a- way

2.  I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
    Now you've decided to show me the same
    No sweeping exits or off-stage lines
    Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Ch. Wild horses couldn't drag me away
                                       C(VIII)
    Wild wild horses couldn't drag me away

    [guitar break]
    Fsus2(VIII) C(VIII) x 3
    D G


3.  I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie
    I have my freedom but I don't have much time
    Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
    Let's do some living, after we'll die

Ch. Wild horses couldn't drag me away
    Wild wild horses we'll ride them some day.

Here's the gist/chords of Can't Always Get What You Want 
by the Rolling Stones...

(Please note I make NO guarantees about the words, I'm doing this on the fly,
but it should be enough to get you started.  Besides, I don't I ever really
knew the words :o )

It's best to listen to a recording to get the strumming pattern...


(In the key of C)


C                           F 
   I saw her today at the reception
C                         F
   A glass of wine in her hand
C                                   F 
   I knew she was going to meet her connection
C                              F                   
   At her feet was a footloose man

Chorus:

C                                  F
(No) you can't always get what you want

C                             F
You can't always get what you want

D
But if you try sometime, 

F
you might find

                 C                      F                    etc...
You get what you need...                yeah, yeah.....


BTW, If you are still at the point where an F chord if gruesome, then go ahead
and just play in the key of D (play D instead of C, G instead of F, and E 
instead of D in the chorus).  I did it that way when I was first learning the
guitar.

Hope this works and sorry for any mistakes or misjudgements.

The tab for this would be really cool as the song really isn't strummmed...
...anyone?

Well Aww-right!
One such anthology tab book is:
"Rolling Stones", by David Dalton
copyright 1972 Amsco Music Publishing Co.
ISBN: 0-8256-2669-2 (soft cover), 0-8256-2953-6 (cloth cover).

Oh my, over 20 years old already?  Hmmm.  Anyway, it's one of my
favorite Stones books: cool pictures, easy and interesting 
reading, record & film reviews, a discography, and (!) sheet 
music.  It has the songs, including lyrics, for
all Jagger/Richard songs through "Sticky Fingers."
Actually, the sheet music is more appropriately called
"fake" sheet music.  But it's close enough to give an amateur
guitar player an idea of the chords used.  For example,

"YOU GOT THE SILVER"

Bb     F7 Bb
Hey babe, what's in your eyes?
F7         Bb                      F7
I saw them flashing like airplane lights
            Bb                    F7
You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
            Bb                     Bb Bbdim F7 Bb Fdim
I must come back for a little more.
F7          Bb              F7
You got my heart you got my soul
            Bb                 F7
You got the silver you got the gold
            Bb                F7
You got the diamonds from the mines
                Bb                   Cm7  Ab/C Cm7/F F7
Well that's all right it'll buy some time.
         Bb    F7           Bb
Tell me, honey, what will I do
F7       Bb                 F7
When I'm hungry and thirsty too
        Bb                      F7
Feeling fooling (and that's for sure)
             Bb                       Bb Bdim F7 Bb F7
Just waiting here at your kitchen door?
Bb7 Eb                   Bb
Hey baby, what's in your eyes
            Eb                Bb
Is that the diamonds from the mines
            Eb               Bb
What's that laughing in your smile?
        Eb      Edim      F7
I don't care, no, I don't care
    Bb
Hey babe, you got my soul 
            Eb                 Bb
You got the silver you got the gold
           Eb               Bb
A flash of love has made me blind
        Eb      Edim                    F7 Cm9 F13
I don't care, no, that's no big surprise.

Till the next time,

Steve,
     The fingering I usually use is (in standard tuning) the low 'E' string open
on the 2cd fret of the 'A' string.
For the F#, the index finger plays low 'E' string, 2cd fret while
the ring finger gets the 'A' string, 4th fret.
For the G, just move both fingers up one fret: index 'E' string, third fret
and  ring finger 'A' string, 5th fret.

     Since I am primarily a rhythm player, I use a simple strum pattern on the
chorus.  I usually strike the strike the chord and let it ring for seven
beats.  Then I strum four sixteenth notes and move on to the next chord.

I hope I'm clear on that...It's kind of hard to describe...

The tab you sent over the list helped me greatly...especially on "Paint
it Black".  I seem to have alot f trouble copying minor-key songs..
Thanks for the 'G' tuning tip.


                         Mike
