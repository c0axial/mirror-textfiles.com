PROVE MY LOVE (Lucinda Williams)
--------------------------------
[Actually in C#; capo 1]
[Each chord is one measure]

Dm  F  C  C
[intro]

       Dm  Dm            C     C
We all make mistakes sometimes
           Dm  Dm           C    C
And I have made my share of mine
          Dm    Dm              C    C
But if I have to, I'll walk the line
        Dm   Dm  C    C
Just to prove my love

             Dm  Dm               C   C
You know I'd give everything I've got
               Dm  Dm          C   C
And I what I'd give would be a lot
          Dm      Dm             C     C
I would smooth out all the rough spots
        Dm   Dm  F    F
Just to prove my love

       C    C            C   C
Let me prove my love for you
       G      G          C   C
Let me do whatever I can do
       C   C            C    C
Let me show my heart is true
       G    F            C   C
Let me prove my love for you
Dm  F  C  C
[instrumental]

There was a time way back when
The words we spoke were sweeter then
We can have those times again
Let me prove my love

Let me prove my love for you
Let me do whatever I can do
Let me show my heart is true
Let me prove my love for you
Let me prove my love for you
