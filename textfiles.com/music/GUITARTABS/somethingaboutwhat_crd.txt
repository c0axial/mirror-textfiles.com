SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TALK (Lucinda Williams)
------------------------------------------------------------
[Actually in A; capo up two frets]
[I use D(4) instead of D sometimes, and C(9) instead of C a lot of the
 time, just by changing one string.  (D(4)=xx0032 and C(9)=x30010.)  Also
 change G to G(9) here and there.  (G(9)=300033 or 300003.)]


G  D  Am  C    G  D  Am  C    G  D  Am  C
[intro]

            G      G             C         C
If I had my way,       I'd be in your town

            G       G                           F/C   C
I might not stay,       but at least I would've been around

               G                    D               C    C
'Cause there's something about what happens when we talk

G                    D               C    C
Something about what happens when we talk


Does this make sense?  It doesn't matter anyway
Is it coincidence, or was it meant to be?
'Cause there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk

Conversation with you was like a drug
It wasn't your face so much as it was your words
And there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk

[Guitar solo: G D C C four times]

Well I can't stay 'round 'cause I'm going back south
But all I regret now is I never kissed your mouth
And there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk
