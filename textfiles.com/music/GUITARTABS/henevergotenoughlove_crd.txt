HE NEVER GOT ENOUGH LOVE (Lucinda Williams & Betty Elders)
----------------------------------------------------------

[intro: G  G]

     G          G            C          C
His mama ran off when he was just a kid
      D              D          G   G
So he never really knew her at all
        G               G      C         C
Just a picture of a girl in a sad blue dress
D                  D           G   G
Hanging beside a cross on the wall

His daddy used to drive those eighteen wheelers
Now he drives the bottle deep into the night
He was always saying, "son, you're just no good
You'll never do anything right"

         G              G   Am7          Am7
He never got enough love in all his life
          C               C          D           D
He wasn't brought up right, he never got enough love
G  G  Am7  Am7  C  C  D  D
[instrumental]

The screams and the bruises, and the broken bottles
These were things he understood
>From busted chairs to a broken heart
He got away as soon as he could

When he was just eighteen, he got his very own gun
Shot a kid near a liquor store one night
He was all mixed up, he never understood why
He was only lookin' to prove his daddy right

He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right, he never got enough love
He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right, he never got enough love

[instrumental twice]
