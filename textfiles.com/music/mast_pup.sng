....Battery                               (Hetfield, Ulrich)


Lashing out the action... Returning the reaction...
Weak are ripped and torn away!
Hypnotizing Power, crushing all that cower...
Battery is here to stay!

 Smashing through the boundaries...
 Lunacy has found me...
 Cannot stop the battery!
 Pounding out aggresion...
 Turns into obsession...
 Cannot kill the battery!

 Cannot kill the family...
 Battery is found in me!
 
 Battery!

Crushing all deceivers... Mashing non-believers...
Never ending potency!
Hungry violence seeker, Feeding on the weaker...
Breeding on insanity!

 Smashing through the boundaries...
 Lunacy has found me...
 Cannot stop the battery!
 Pounding out agression...
 Turns into obsession...
 Cannot kill the battery!

 Cannot kill the family...
 Battery is found in me!

 Battery!

Circle of destruction, Hammer comes crushing...
Powerhouse of energy!
Whipping up a fury, Dominating flurry...
We create the battery!

 Smashing through the boundaries...
 Lunacy has found me...
 Cannot stop the battery!
 Pounding out aggresion...
 Turns into obsession...
 Cannot kill the battery!

 Cannot kill the family...
 Battery is found in me!

 Battery!

 Battery!

 Battery!

 Battery!!!

....The Thing That Should not Be                   (Hetfield, Ulrich. Burton)


Messenger of fear in sight...
Dark deception kills the light!
                              
Hybrid children watch the seas...
Pray for father, roaming free!
  
 Fearless wretch...
 Insanity...
 He watches...
 Lurking beneath the sea!
 Great old one...
 Forbidden site...
 He searches...
 Hunter of the shadows is rising...
                          Immortal...
                          In madness you dwell!

Crawling chaos, underground...
Cult has summoned, Twisted sound!

Out of ruins once possessed...
Fallen city, Living death!

 Fearless wretch...
 Insanity...
 He watches...
 Lurking beneath the sea!
 Timeless sleep...
 Has been upset...
 He awakens...
 Hunter of the shadows is rising...
                          Immortal...
                          In madness you dwell!
 
                          In madness you dwell!
  
Not dead which eternal lie...
Stranger eons death may die!

Drain you of your sanity...
Face the thing that should not be!

 Fearless wretch...
 Insanity...
 He watches...
 Lurking beneath the sea!
 Great old one...
 Forbidden site...
 He searches...
 Hunter of the shadows is rising...
                          Immortal...
                          In madness, You dwell! 
                           

....Welcome Home <Sanitarium>                      (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammet)
  
Welcome to where time stands still...
No one leaves and No one will...
Moon is full, Never seems to change...
Mis-labeled mentally dereanged...
Dream the same thing every night...
I see out freedom in my sight...
No locked doors, No windows barred...
No things to make my brain seem scarred...

Sleep my friend and you will see...
That dream is my reality...  
They keep me locked up in this cage...
Can't they see It's why my brain says rage!

  Sanatarium...leave me be!
  Sanatarium...just leave me alone...
                                     
Build my fear of what's out there...
And cannot breathe the open air...
Whisper things isto my brain...
Assuring me that I'm insane...
They think our heads are in their hands...
But violent use brings violent plans...
Keep him tied, it makes him well...
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in...
Listen, Dammit, We will win!
They see it right, They see it well...
But they think this saves us from our hell...

  Sanatarium... Leave me be!
  Sanatarium... just leave me alone...
  Sanatarium... just leave me alone...

Fear of living on...
Natives getting restless now...
Mutiny in the air...
Got some death to do...
Mirror stares back hard...
Kill, it's such a friendly word...
Seems the only way...
For reaching out again!


....Disposable Heroes                          (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammet) 

Bodies fill the fields I see, Hungry heroes end...
No one to play soldier now, No one to pretend...
Running blind through killing fields, Bred to kill them all....
Victim of what they said should be...
A servant 'till I fall...
 
 Soldier boy, made of clay...
 Now an empty shell..
 Twenty one, only son...
 But he served us well
 Bred to kill, not to care..
 Do just as we say...
 Finished here, greetings Death
 He's yours to take away
 
 Back to the front
 You will do what I say, When I say
 Back to the front
 You will die when I say you must die...
 Back to the front...
 You coward...
 You servant...
 You blindman...

Barking of Machine Gun fire, does nothing to me now...
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow...
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory seeker trends...
Bodies fill the fields i see
The slaughter never ends...

 Soldier boy, made of clay...
 Now an empty shell...
 Twenty One, Only son...
 But he served us well...
 Bred to kill, not to care...
 Do just as we say...
 Finished here, Greetings death...
 He's yours to take away...

 Back to the front
 You will do what I say, When i say...
 Back to the front...
 You will die when i say you must die...
 Back to the front...
 You coward...
 You servant...
 You blindman...

Why am i dying?
Kill, have no fear...
Lie live off lying...
Hell, Hell is here...

I was born for dying...

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say...
Had no chance to see myself, Moulded day by day...
Looking back I realize, Nothing have I done...
Left to die with only friend...
Alone i clench my gun...

 Soldier boy, Made of clay...
 Now an empty shell
 Twenty One, Only son...
 But he served us well...
 Bred to kill, Not to care...
 Do just as we say...
 Finished here, Greeetings Death...
 He's yours to take away...

 Back to the front...
 You will do what I say, When I say...
 Back to the front...
 You will die when I say you must Die...
 Back to the front...
 You coward...
 You servant...
 You blindman...

Back to the front...



....Leper Messiah                                     (Hetfield, Ulrich)

Spineless from the start, Sucked into the part...
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown...
Please, Please...
Spreading his disease, Living by his story...
Knees...Knees...
Falling to your knees, Suffer for his glory...
You will...

 Time for lust, Time for lie...
 Time to kiss you life goodbye...
 Send me money, Send me green...
 Heaven you will meet... 
 Make a contribution...
 And you'll get a better seat...     
 Bow to Leper Messiah!!

Marvel at his tricks, need you Sunday fix...
Blind devotion came, Rotting you brain...
Chain...Chain...
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour...
Fame...Fame...
Infection is the game, Stinking drunk with power...
We see...

 Time for lust, Time for lie...
 Time to kiss your life goodbye...
 Send me money, Send me green...
 Heaven you will meet
 Make a contribution...
 And you'll get a better seat...
 Bow to Leper Messiah!

Witchery, Weakening...
Sees the sheep are gathering...
Set the trap, Hypnotize...
Now you follow!

 Time for lust, Time for lie...
 Time to kiss you life goodbye...
 Send me money, send me green...
 Heaven you will meet...
 Make a contribution...
 And you'll get a better seat...

 Lie.....

....Damage, Inc.                            (Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton, Hammet)

Dealing out the agony within...
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in...
Living on your knees, Conformity...
Or dying on your feet for honesty...
Inbred, Our bodies work as one...
Bloody, but never cry submission...
Following our instinct not a trend...
Go against the grain until the end...

 Blood will follow blood...
 Dying time is here...
 Damage Incorporated...

Slamming through, Dont fuck with razorback...
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back...
Blood follows blood and we make sure...
Life ain't for you, and we're the cure!
Honesty is my only excuse...
Try to rob us of it, But it's no use...
Steamroller action, Crushing all...
Victim is your name and you shall fall...

 Blood will follow blood
 Dying time is here...
 Damage Incorporated...

We chew and spit you out...
We laugh, you scream and shout...
All flee, With fear you run...
You'll know just where we come form...

 Damage Incorporated...

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want...
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt...
Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets...
Never happy endings on these dark sets...
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see...
Step a little closer if you please...

 Blood will follow blood
 Dying time is here
 Damage Incorporated...
