AMONG THE LIVING			CAUGHT IN A MOSH

Disease, Disease			Why don't you listen to me when I try
Spreading the disease			    to talk to you
With some help from Captain Trips	Stop thinking of yourself, for just a
He'll bring the world down to his knees     second fool
Power, yes Power			Shut up, shut up, I don't wanna hear
He'll show them all his power               your mouth
It pulses through his ice cold blood	Your mother made a monster, now get
A whole world to devour 		    the hell out of my house

He's seeing, He's calling               Can't stand it for another day
His legacy, He's spawning               I ain't gonna live my life this way
He's coming, corrupting                 Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Among the living			Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot
					    convention
Murder, Murder
Commit cold blooded murder		Which one of these words don't you
Like Nazis during World War Two 	    understand?
They only follow orders 		Talking to you, is like clapping with
Hatred, Hatred				    one hand
A crucifix is your bed
Once he turns his eye on you		What is it? - Caught in a mosh
You'd be better off dead                What is it? - Caught in a mosh
He's seeing, He's calling               What is it? - Caught in a mosh
His legacy, He's spawning               What is it? - Caught in a mosh
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living			Don't tell me how to do my job
					There's the door, your name's on the
I am the walkin' dude                       knob
I can see all the world 		You're always in the way, like a
Twist your minds with fear		    beast on my back
I'm the man with the power              Were you dropped as a baby, cause
Among the living			    brains you lack
Follow me or die			Can't stand it for another day
					I ain't gonna live my life this way
Man, fights Man 			Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Divided they can't stand                Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot
United they can battle back		    convention
And make him force his hand		Which one of these words don't you
Fear, yes Fear				    understand?
His end is growing near 		Talking to you, is like clapping with
He didn't count on man's good faith         one hand
and their will to persevere		What is it? - Caught in a mosh
He's seeing, He's calling               What is it? - Caught in a mosh
His legacy, He's spawning               What is it? - Caught in a mosh
He's coming, corrupting                 What is it? - Caught in a mosh
Among the living
I am the walkin' dude                   Think - before you speak
I can see all the world 		Or suffer, for your words
Twist your minds with fear		Learn, to give respect
I'm the man with the power              that others, give to you
Among the living			AAAAAAAAAAH, The best you can do
Follow me or die
					Hey Man
Fire, not Fire				I'm trying to reason but you don't
Purge the world with fire		    understand
Damnation is the price he'll pay        Talking in circles, we'll never get it
For an evil man's desire                    straight
Good, vs. Evil				Just you and me in our theatre of hate
The stand to vanquish evil		Can't stand it for another day
Man can only live one way		I ain't gonna live my life this way
That place right in the middle		Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
He's seeing, He's calling               Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot
His legacy, He's spawning                   convention
He's coming, corrupting                 Which one of these words don't you
Among the living			    understand?
I am the walkin' dude                   What is it? - Caught in a mosh
I can see all the world 		What is it? - Caught in a mosh
Twist your minds with fear		What is it? - Caught in a mosh
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die

I AM THE LAW				EFILNIKUFESIN (N.F.L.)

Fifteen years in the academy		It started back in high school
He was like no cadet they'd ever seen   So cool, king of the scene
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice	You found that making people laugh
And when he speaks he never says it	Was more than just a dream
    twice				The public took right to you
They call him Judge, his last name is	Like flies to a pile of shit
    Dredd				So funny and smart so talented
So break the law, and you may wind up	But success just couldn't fit
    dead
Truth and justice are what he's         Wasting your life
    fighting for			No future is bright
Judge Dredd the man, he is the law	Dancing on your grave
DROKK IT				Living like a slave, someone should've
					    said...
With his gun and bike he rules the
    streets				N.F.L., Efilnikufesin
And every perp he meets will taste	N.F.L.
    defeat				N.F.L., Efilnikufesin
Not even Death can overcome his might	N.F.L.
Cause Dredd and Anderson, they won the	Wake up dead, in a plywood bed six
    fight				    feet from the rest of your life
When the Sov's started the Apocalypse   And when you couldn't see your own
    war 				    dependency
And Mega-City was bombed to the floor	N.F.L., NICE FUCKIN' LIFE!
Dredd resisted, and the judges fought
    back				The whole world is a playground
And crushed the Sov's with their        Yet you can't find your niche
    counter-attack			Your only friends, it helps you
DROKK IT				    through
					Helps you dig your daily ditch
Respect the badge - he earned it with	The bottom line can't touch you
    his blood				Cause you're above the rest
Fear the gun - your sentence may be	But your little friend's the enemy
    death because...			And the bottom line is death
					Wasting your life
I AM THE LAW				No future is bright
And you won't fuck around no more - I   Dancing on your grave
    AM THE LAW				Living like a slave, someone should've
I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I	    said...
    AM THE LAW				N.F.L., Efilnikufesin
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I   N.F.L.
    AM THE LAW				N.F.L., Efilnikufesin
Because in Mega-City... 		N.F.L.
I AM THE LAW				Wake up dead, in a plywood bed six
					    feet from the rest of your life
In the cursed earth where mutants dwell And when you couldn't see your own
There is no law, it's just a living         dependency
    hell				N.F.L., NICE FUCKIN' LIFE!
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
But this would change if it was up to	You lived a life of excess
    Dredd				GODDAMN shame it's such a waste
The book of law is the bible to him	Just one too many cookies
And any crime committed is a sin	From the batch no one should taste
He keeps the peace with his law-giver	Yet his memory still stays with us
Judge, jury, and executioner		Cause watching him was fun
DROKK IT				Too bad things weren't different
Respect the badge - he earned it with	Who knows what he'd have done
    his blood				Wasting your life
Fear the gun - your sentence may be	No future is bright
    death because...			Dancing on your grave
I AM THE LAW				Living like a slave, someone should've
					    said...
CRIME - the ultimate sin		N.F.L., Efilnikufesin
Your Iso-Cube is waiting when he brings N.F.L.
    you in				N.F.L., Efilnikufesin
LAW - it's what he stands for           N.F.L.
Crime's his only enemy and he's going   Wake up dead, in a plywood bed six
    to war				    feet from the rest of your life
					And when you couldn't see your own
CRIME - the ultimate sin		    dependency
Your Iso-Cube is waiting when he brings N.F.L., NICE FUCKIN' LIFE!
    you in
LAW - it's what he stands for
Crime's his only enemy and he's going
    to war
Respect the badge - he earned it with
    his blood
Fear the gun - your sentence may be
    death because...
I AM THE LAW
And you won't fuck around no more - I
    AM THE LAW
I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I
    AM THE LAW
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I
    AM THE LAW
Because in Mega-City...
I AM THE LAW

ONE WORLD				A.D.I./HORROR OF IT ALL

Stop it 				It's just too damn easy, to die in
There's been too much debate                this life
We could save ourselves from holocaust	Who's making the decisions?
Or is that just our fate		Tell me, who's got the right
Start now
But we continue to balk 		WOH, OH, OH, My grief turns to anger
We let the genie out of the bottle	WOH, OH, AH, OH, It's time to...
But we still hold the cork
					Say good-bye, It's a horror
ONE, TWO, - NOT 			Memories, Nothing's harder
THREE, FOUR, - DIE
ONE, TWO, - NOT 			I know that there's no answer, I mean
THREE FOUR, - DIE			    what'd I expect
					So many unanswered questions
Ignorance is no excuse			I can't believe, I can't accept
For violence				WOH, OH, OH, My anger turns to hatred
NO ONE WINS...				WOH, OH, AH, OH, It's time to...
					Say good-bye, It's a horror
ONE WORLD				Memories, Nothing's harder
ONE WORLD
ONE WORLD - Welcome to it		OOOOOH, AAAH, OOOOOH, The horror of it
ONE WORLD - Don't abuse it                  all
ONE WORLD - To live out your life	The horror of it all, I'm gonna break
ONE WORLD - Total schism		The horror of it all, Tell me why
Tunnel vision
ONE WORLD - Taming the beast		You're not supposed to question, but
Fighting for peace			    why's there so much pain
					When someone's taken from you
Killing 				What can you do or say?
You pushed a button that's all you did  WOH, OH, OH, My hatred turns to
It's much harder to kill a man              violence
If you've seen pictures of his kids     WOH, OH, AH, OH, It's time to...
Responsibility				Say good-bye, It's a horror
And what are all our lives worth?	Memories, Nothing's harder
What kind of sentence would you serve	OOOOOH, AAAH, OOOOOH, The horror of it
For killing the earth			    all
ONE, TWO, - NOT 			The horror of it all, I'm gonna break
THREE, FOUR, - DIE			The horror of it all, Tell me why
ONE, TWO, - NOT
THREE, FOUR - DIE			The horror of it all
Ignorance is no excuse			The horror of it all
For violence				The horror of it all
ONE WORLD				The horror of it all
ONE WORLD				Say good-bye it's such a horror
ONE WORLD - Welcome to it		My memories there's nothing harder
ONE WORLD - Don't abuse it              Anger and hatred fill the page
ONE WORLD - To live out your life	So smash the walls it's time to rage
ONE WORLD - Total schism
Tunnel vision
ONE WORLD - Taming the beast
Fighting for peace

Russians
They're only people like us
Do you really think they'd blow up the
    world
They don't love their lives less
America
Stop singing hail to the chief
Instead of thinking S.D.I.
He should be thinking of peace

ONE WORLD

IMITATION OF LIFE

There's nothing I hate more, than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises, and all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves, and live their own lives out
They're just an imitation of what life's all about

"Because of me you are who you are
So sign your name, and you'll go far
I'm your friend, I think you should
So sign your name, it's for your own good"
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THIS TODAY???
Some bogus piss-on saying "Leg's do lunch babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
IMITATION OF LIFE

OOOOOOOH, OOOOH, OH
ANGER BURNS
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend

"Take my advice, listen to me
A great opportunity, can't you see
I only want what's best for you
The deal of a lifetime, what more can I do"
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THIS TODAY???
Some stupid sucker says "It's great, we luv ya babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
IMITATION OF LIFE

OOOOOOOH, OOOOH, OH
ANGER BURNS
Bands dress like women, with hairspray and lace
I'd pass an image law, stick it in their face
Let's see how long they keep dressing this way
Wearing this image twenty four hours a day...

DID YOU EVER THINK FOR YOURSELF??
JUST ONCE, DID YOU EVER THIN??
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO KNOW

IMITATION OF LIFE, Living out a lie
You'll never be right, IMITATION OF LIFE
WHY ARE YOU HERE??, YOU'RE TAKING UP MY SPACE
The new imperfect race, IMITATION OF LIFE

OOOOOOOH, OOOOH, OH
ANGER BURNS
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story has an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
There's nothing I hate more
Than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises
And all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves
And live their own lives out
They're just an imitation
Of what life's all about
IMITATION OF LIFE

Liner notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  The lyrics to "Among" are inspired by Stephen King's brilliant novel, "The
    Stand".  The album cover is inspired by the character "Randall Flagg," a
    man (?) that definitely stands out "Among The Living."
2.  "I Am The Law," is inspired by the British weekly 2000 A.D. publications
    most popular, (and our favorite character) character, Judge Dredd.	(Dredd
    rules O.K.!!, HE IS THE LAW!).
3.  The lyrics to "Skeleton" are inspired by the Stephen King novella, "Apt
    Pupil."  This story can be found in the book "Different Seasons."
