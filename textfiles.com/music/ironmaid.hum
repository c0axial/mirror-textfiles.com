You'll take my life but I'll take your too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attact
You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death.

The horse he sweats with fear he breaks to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sight
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below.

And as I lay there gazing  at the sky
My body's numb as my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan.

As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill.
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he Flies on the wings of a dream.
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,

On your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun.

-> Die With Your Boots On (Smith/Dickinson/Harris)


Another Prophet of Disaster
Who says the ship is lost,
Another Prophet of Disaster
Leaving you to count the cost.
Taunting us with Visions,
Afflicting us with fear,
Predicting War for millions,
In the hope that one appears.

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame.
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die.
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die.

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, just stick around,
Gonna cry, just move around,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

In 13 the Beast is Rising
The Frenchman did surmise,
Through earthquakes and starvation,
The Warlord will arise.
Terror, Death, Desruction,
Pour from the Eastern sands,
But the truth of all predictions,
Is always in your hands.

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, just stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If your gonna die, you're gonna die.
