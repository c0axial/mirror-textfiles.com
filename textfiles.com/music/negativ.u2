	U2 (Secret Single) 1991, SST Records

1. 1991 A Cappella Mix (7:21)

	"...reproduction, or what?"
	"What did you say?"
	"What kind of production?"
	"There are all sorts of possibilities you could do. You know, a
little spoof on something..."

	This is also nothing new.

	"Yeah, get stuff together, no problem, y'know, if you want to
do..."

	(c'mon, let's look) (no, no, no. Uh-uh.)

	Oh. Oh well.	(This is American Top Furty)

	I have climbed the highest mountains, and guess what?
	(Yeah, I believe it's the Weatherman now... where you at?)
	I've run ... through the fields ... only to be with you.
	Yep, with you. No one else, just you.	(Here's the first Top 40 hit)
	And guess what?		(for the Irish band from Dublin who call
themselves U2)
	I have run, I have crawled, I have scaled these city walls!
	Yeah, that's really great, I can't believe I did it, but
nevertheless, I have done that for you. (That's the letter U, and the
numeral 2.)
	Only to be with you, I've done all these things. (the f-)
	Yeah, with you. The fat one, that's it.	(the f-)
	You're the fat one, and I wanna be with you. (What's the matter?)
	(Can I say, eh, why was it changed here?)
	But on the other hand, I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
	(That's the letter U, and the numeral 2.)
	(Maybe they'll make it as a junior U2.)
	But on the other hand, I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
	(That's the letter U, and the numeral)	(they say)
	Nope, definitely not. (2.) I haven't found it. (they say, they're
kinda like U2) I just can't seem to find it. (That's the letter U, and the
numeral 2.)
	Nope, definitely not, I haven't found it. (That's the letter U, and
the numeral 2.) (come on)

	And here's what else I've done. (come on, let's see what we can
find)
	I have kissed honey lips ... felt the healing in her fingertips.
I've even done that!	(That's the letter U, and the numeral 2.)
	While I was doing that, y'know, all the kissing on the honey lips,
it burned like fire, and it reminded me of cheap melting plastic. The kind
that makes little clouds of white vapor gas and then when it catches on
fire, makes those little ... little strings of black smoke with little
ashes attached to them. That's how it was, kissing honey lips.
	(Why are we doing it? Why have we changed something?)
	And I still haven't found it. What I'm looking for, that is.
	I just don't know where the Hell it is...
	(The last thing we wanted to do was sound like everybody else.)
	...I just can't seem to find it...
	(That's the letter U, and the numeral 2.)
	(..gotta challenge...musically speaking, you know, you've gotta
find new sounds in a guitar, you've gotta find a new way of approaching a
4/4 beat. ... Rock and roll still needs innovation.. and there's a lot,
there's a lot out there.)
	Someone has said, get a great ideal, a great purpose, marry it, and
raise a family.	(What the Hell's going on here?)
	Bono.	(Billy, look!) (I should be saying, American Top 40 is
heard in the fifty states...)
	Are U2 married to a great idea? (It was, it was every week,
American Top 40 is heard in the) (Everything is topsy-turvy!) (I'll say it is!)
	(Is it to just screw up things?)
	Marriage is not U2 living for each other (cause I can't say this,
y'know)	(let's see what we can find!)	(Everything's such a mess!)
	(We're almost finished...)
	Is U2 uniting to live as a team for this great purpose?
(What's the matter? Find something?) (No.)
	(I can't find anything here.)	Goddamnit, sewer-mouth is back again.
	(There's no one in here now... nothing but Uncle Jim's shortwave
radio set.)	(Ponderous... is Don on the phone?)

	Hi, Casey. Uh, I had them put me right on the speaker phone for ya.
Uh, now I just got word from Mr. Friday that, uh... uh, we can't pay you
anything for this until uh, our label sends us some of the money they owe
us. So, this will, uh, have to be benefit terms. So, uh... (Good golly,
Miss Molly.) well, I gotta catch a plane. Give my regards to the
Weatherman and, uh, heh, U2!
	You know, they do this to me all the time, I dunno what the Hell
they do it for, but...
	(Yeah that's, the guy that was talking to the sewer-mouth there,
bring him back)
	Now, make, and I also wanna know what happened to the pictures I
was supposed to see this week?
	(Hey, sewer-mouth!)	(...could be, hey, I'm on a frequency, I
betcha can't find me!)	(Who's got the ???? out there?)
	That's the letter 2, and the numeral U.

	Heh heh heh HEH. I was a worm in the night. And cold as a stone, I
was.	(Alright... Alright... Okay, let's try it, okay?) (Cyndi? Okay...)
	And I believe in kingdom come, (Cyndi? Okay...) and all the colors
bleeding into one big mess. (Okay...) I'll probably have to get out the STP
cleaner on that one, maybe the 409, but I'm not sure yet. (That's the
letter U, and the numeral 2.) (I have the envelope here)
	And you broke the bombs. (and uh) You broke the goddamn bombs, (and
uh) you've loosened the chains, (I have the envelope) you've carried across
(I have the envelope here) and my shame, and my shame. Shame, shame, shame,
shame, shame. So much shame. (Why have we changed changed something that
we've been doing all along?)
	You know, I believe it. (Alright...) Nope, I guess I don't believe
it. I don't know what I'm talking about. (This, this is)
	But nevertheless, I still haven't found it. (That's the letter U)
	I haven't found what I'm looking for, I haven't found it. (I can't
say it again!) I'm lookin' for it, but I don't even know where it is! (and
the numeral 2)
	I don't even really (before we announce the winner) know anything
anymore, I just... (see, that doesn't sound right either) I don't really
know what to do (let's just) (alright) (let's just) or do I? (recap) (Okay,
let's just try it, okay?) (the nominees.)
	But, I still haven't found it. (That's the letter U, and the
numeral 2.) Doesn't make sense, but I still haven't found it I'm looking.
I'm, no (I have the envelope here) I'm I'm looking for. No, (I have the
envelope here) just I'm looking for it. (I have the envelope) (That's the
letter U, and the numeral 2.)	(...NOBODY CAN FIND ME ON THIS FREQUENCY)
	I just don't know much of anything; maybe I oughta be shot
point-blank in the stamper(?) tonight. (That's the letter U, and the
numeral 2.) (Alright, come on, find me, bet ya can't find me)
	Is that the way I say that? I dunno how to say it.
	U2	I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

	Well, I'll be jiggered. There it is.

	We're counting down the 40 biggest hits in the fifty states.
	Hey sewer-mouth, we're gonna get ya.
	This is American Top Furty
	This is American Top 40, heard-- God, I hate that, come out of
that, and then I gotta say the goddamned Amer-- (and, uh) I hear the
American Top 40 jingle and then I say this is American Top 40. (and, uh..
the winner is...) Let the goddamn jingle ID this show. I ID the show
whenever there isn't a jingle, don't I? (the winner is...) Don't I do it
between every goddamn record that we play?
	INXS!
2. Special Edit Radio Mix (5:51)

	Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication. And this one is about
kids, and pets, and a situation that we can all understand, whether we have
kids or pets or neither. It's from a man in Cincinatti, Ohio. And here's
what he writes:
	Dear Casey, This may seem to be a strange dedication request, but
I'm quite sincere, and it'll mean a lot if you play it. Recently, there was
a death in our family. He was a little dog named Snuggles. But he was most
certainly a part of--

	let's come, start again. From comin' out of the record. Play the
record, okay? Please...

	...get on the frequency that I'm on, ya dumb son of a bitch!
	That's the letter U, and the numeral 2. The four-man band features Adam
Clayton on bass, Larry Mullen on drums, Dave Evans, nicknamed "The Edge", on --
this is bullshit! Nobody cares! These guys are from England, and who gives a
shit? (Oh... yeah...)
	Just a lot of waste, names that don't mean diddly-shit! (Aye, for sure,
for sure, you guys don't know where he's at, you don't know shit about)
	This is bullshit  this is bullshit (sounds like he's portable, too)
	Who gives a shit? Who gives a shit? (yeah, it is close)
	Diddly-shit diddly-shit	diddly-shit diddly-shit .... (yeah.. damn
right) Nobody cares!	(getting stronger all the time here)
	Snuggles. (yeah) Snuggles. (oh yeah)	Snuggles. (oh yeah, okay)
He was a little dog named Snuggles.
	This is American Top Furty... This is American Top 40. This is
bullshit! 	(...can't get a hold of me, ya little fuckin' twerp
cocksucker	... FUCK YOU!!!)
	(when we find you, we want your blood)
	Here we go with the shit, tryin' to find him, ooh when we find
him, you guys have a fuckin' ?? ... you couldn't find your fuckin' asshole
if your fuckin' butt wasn't connected to it! ... Bunch of fuckin' white-ass
honkies... you can't find shit, stupid bastards...
	I wanna meet you ... but I don't think you've got the fuckin'
balls
	You haven't found anybody, anywhere, anytime
	You never have given out his correct address, his fuckin' right-on
description, or a car, or nothin'. You got some fuckin' bullshit info Heh.
You haven't done shit with 'em
	We didn't find you yet? We really didn't find you the first time?
	When was the first time, huh? When was the first time?
	You never give out his address, or what he looks like, and his
car, and all that fuckin' information. Goddamn, you got somebody there, I
don't know who, but go ahead, give all that shit out, why don't you go over
there and knock on his fuckin' door man, ya, ya think you know where he's
at and all this shit

	When you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's
impossible to make those transitions... and then ya gotta go into somebody
dying...
	Goddammit if we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand
it...
	Why are we doing these instrumentals too, cause we got 'em?
	I don't understand it.	(This is also nothing new.)
	I don't understand it.	(This is also nothing new.)
	I don't understand it.	(... you cocksucker!!)
	I think that people read more into the music that's really there.
	Will somebody find out the goddamn answer?
	In the 50's, they considered it vulgar and despicable to have songs
like "Teach Me Tonight", "Let's Do It" by Cole Porter... "All of You" by
Cole Porter, those were considered euphemisms for something dirty.
	Who gives a shit?
	Some vulgar, dirty act.
	Diddly-shit
	The Kingston Trio sang a song that used the word "damn". It was
banned on the radio.
	Goddammit...
	In the 60's, there was a song called "Louie Louie" (goddammit)
played upside back (goddammit) every way they could play it, looking for
the dirty message (goddammit) they never found the dirty message ... the
FCC was brought in.
	Oh fuck!
	Uh, in the 70's, people went through the same period; looking for
the dirtiness of songs. 
	SATAN!!	HAIL SATAN!!!
	I... I.. I.. I really don't think that the Satanic message is there
(Go on, fuckin' find him, man)	Snuggles.
	Be prepared to meet your maker (fuck!) I'm after your ass, boy.
	???????
	Snuggles.
	Definitely. Meet me at Morley's ... I'll personally meet you.
(Fuck!) You'll see me (Snuggles.) I'll be wearin' a red and white baseball
cap, says ABC Auto Parts on it. (Okay) Can't miss me, son. (Okay)
	Oh, sounds like a real fancy dresser now, doesn't he? (Okay)
	I'm gonna whup your fuckin' ass.
	Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that
isn't a fucking up-tempo record everytime I do a goddamn DEATH dedication!
It's the last goddamn time, I want SOMEBODY use his fuckin' brain, to not
come out of a goddamn record that is uh, that that's up-tempo and I gotta
talk about a fuckin' dog dying!!!
	(???) (super shithead again) (who knows, you might be ... town)
	Whoah, this is fuckin' PONDEROUS, man. Ponderous, fuckin'
PONDEROUS. (Eat shit and die, Richard)
	This is American Top Furty... right here on the radio station you
grew up with, Music Radio 138, oh fuck!
	Oh, fuck you, Liz
	Well fuck you too, Richard
	Fuck you, Liz!
	Fuck you too, Richard
