TAKE TRACKER File Format
Written 5/2/94  by Jamal Hannah <jamal@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

As far as I can tell, the IBM "TakeTracker" File formats are identical
to standard ProTracker 4, but also with 6, 8, 16 and 32 channels,
with the respective signatures at position 1080:  M.K., 6CHN, 8CHN,
16CH, 32CH.

The pattern sizes are simply extended for the various numbers of supported
channels.  Each pattern partition has 64 pattern rows.

End.
