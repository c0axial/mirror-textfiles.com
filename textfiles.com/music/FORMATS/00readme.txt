THE COMPUTER MUSIC FILE FORMATS COLLECTION 1.0
----------------------------------------------
Collected by Jamal Hannah <jamal@gnu.ai.mit.edu> on 5/2/94.

Many of these text files use the IBM ANSI-style graphic character set.
Macintosh users can view these text files correctly with "UnZip 2.0.1".


* The MOD format file outlines the ProTracker (Amiga) standard format.

* The P16 doc is the Protracker Studio 16 (PS16) file format spec.
(IBM)

* The FTK document talks about the IBM FastTracker format. (4,6,8 track)
(ftracker.zip or fasttrak.lzh)

* The STAR-FRM document is some info about the Amiga "StarTracker"
(also called "StarTrekker") format.  4-8 channels.

* The "WOW" document talks about the IBM GraveMod tracker format. (8 track).

* The OKT files talk about the Amiga Oktalyzer (8 track) file format.

* The MED files give info about the MED file formats, from Amiga
MED version 3.21.  For the effects, look for the string:
"MED V3.2 player commands/effects" in the MED-EFX.TXT file
(actualy the MED 3.21 documentation.)

* The FAR-FORM.TXT file is the newest Farandole (IBM) format doc I
could find.  It replaces the older one, wish new stuff starting with
"Farandole .USM Sample/instrument format".  This doc comes from the
"far096.arj" archive. (April 13, 1994)  (16 track)

* The DMF doc files (3 of them) come from the "xtrak030.lzh" (XTRACKER).
These define the 9-octave file format, and it's effects. (IBM)
(32 track, 9 octaves)

* The TT doc is the documentation for IBM "TakeTracker", which I wrote.
(4,6,8,16 & 32 track)

* The ULT docs are the UltraTracker 1.5 (IBM) file format document,
and the documentation for version 1.31 (translated to English) with
the effects listed near the end. (32 track, 16-bit samples)

* The MTM doc is the MultiTracker (IBM) Module format spec,
from the archive "mtm101b.zip".  The "effects" file is
the documentation file that mentions the effects in it. (32 track)

* The 669 doc is the 669 (IBM) File and Extended File format Spec.
(8 tracks)

* The SSS doc is the Super Studio Session file format spec.
(not totaly complete).   This is a Macintosh music format that
stores it's instruments in seperate files, and supports up to
8 channels.  (Actualy it can support an infinate number),
and is perticulary good for systems using Musical Notation
instead of a "tracker" style interface.  It could easily be
made into a "module" format by simply placing the instruments
in order at the end of the song data.

* The S3M doc and effects list are basicly the "ST3.DOC" and "TECH.DOC"
files from ScreamTracker 3.01b ("scrmt301.zip")  (up to 32 track)

* The ROL file gives information about the ROL "synthesized instrument"
music file format.

* The MID documents talk about the General-Midi file format.
(the files origionaly were named: midifile, midispec, general-midi,
and mididump)  The "midiprimer" file is also included.
