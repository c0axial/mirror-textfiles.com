Remember when the politicians were making a big deal out of subliminal
messages in heavy metal music when it  is played backwards?  They even
attacked the theme song for "Mr. Ed"!  Well,  now  you can be your own
judge.  All  you  need to steal/buy  is  a cassette with screws in the
corners so that it can be taken apart.

Turn the empty side with your finger until you start to see black tape
showing at the bottom (or you could just tap the fast-forward button).
Now record the song that you want to hear backwards.

Next  step is to rewind the tape completly.  Now  unscrew the cassette
and, without flipping them, slide the full reel where the empty one is
and vice-versa.  After you do this,  screw the cassette back together.
Now insert the tape  on  the same side the  song was recorded on, (the
full reel should be on the right when the tape is right-side up),  and
press the rewind button and rewind it all the way.

Now the final step, press the fast-forward button until you reach  the
end of the tape. Now hit rewind a little bit and then  hit  play.  You
should be somewhere in the song you just recorded. Just keep using the
rewind and play buttons until you find where the song starts.

Now hit play, sit back, relax, and enjoy your subliminal messages!
