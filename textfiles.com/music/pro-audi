------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  What are the PAS, PAS+, and the PAS-16?

The PAS was the original PAS card.  It is capable of FM synthesizing,
and digital sound.  It can do 8 bit digital sampling and 8 bit digital
playback (I don't know at what rate).  The PAS has shielding built
into it that eliminates background noise that can be created by many
of the components of computer systems (hard drives for example).

The PAS+ is the new version of the old PAS.  I don't believe the PAS
is for sale anymore, as the PAS+ has probably replaced it.  The PAS+
is capable of FM synthesizing, and digital sound.  It has the
shielding that the original PAS had.  It can do 8 bit digital
sampling and 16 bit digital playback.

The PAS-16 is currently the most advanced sound card in the Pro Audio
Spectrum line.  It is capable of FM synthesizing, and digital sound.
It can do 16 bit digital sampling and 16 bit digital playback.  It
has the shielding that was present in the original PAS.

2)  What are the specs for the PAS-16?

Here are the specs for the PAS-16.  I understand that the specs for
the PAS+ are identical, except that the PAS+ can only do 8 bit
sampling, and requires you to specify when you want SB compatibility
mode on or off.
(Sorry, I don't have specs for the original PAS.)
