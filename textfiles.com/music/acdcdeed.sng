If your having trouble 

With the High-School Head

He's giving you the blues

You wanna graduate 

But not in this state



Here's what you gotta do

Pick up the phone I'm always home

Call me anytime.

Just ring 362-4360

I lead a life of crime.



Chorus:

Dirty Deeds - Done Dirt Cheap

Dirty Deeds - Done Dirt Cheap

Dirty Deeds - Done Dirt Cheap

Dirty Deeds and there Done Dirt Cheap

Dirty Deeds and there Done Dirt Cheap



You got a problem in your life of love

You got a broken heart

He's double dealing with your best friend

Thats when the teardrops start, fella



Pick up the phone, I'm here alone.

Or make a social call

Come right in, we'll get round him

We'll have ourselves a ball



Chorus



If you got a lady and you want here gone

But you ain't got the guts

She keeps nagging at you night a day

Enough to drive you nuts



Pick up the phone, leave her alone.

It's time you made a stand

For a fee I'm happy to be

Your back-door man

Love at First Feel

---- -- ----- ----



You never told me where you came from

You never told me your name.



I didnt know if you were legal tender or not

Spend it just the same.



And I didnt know it could happen to me

But I committed love in the first degree



And it was love at first feel

It was love at first feel

First touch was too much!



They told me it was digusting

Told me it was a sin

Ah, saw me knocking on your front door

I just smiled when you let me in



Excuse me baby, were all alone

Let's get something going

While your mom and dad aint home



And it was love at first feel

It was love at first feel

Thats what they said



It was love at first feel

It was love at first feel

Felt good just like I knew it would!

Well, I'm upper, upper class High-Society

Gods gift to ballroom notierity

And I always fill my ballroom

The event is never small



The social pages say I've got 

The biggest balls of all



Chorus:

I've got big balls

I've got big balls

And their such big balls

And their dirty big balls

And he's got big balls

And she's got big balls

But we've got the biggest balls of them all!



And my Balls are always bouncing

And my balls are always filled

And everyone comes and comes again

If your name is one the guest list

No one can take you higher

Everybody says I've got great balls of fire!



(Chorus)



Some balls are held for charity 

And some for fancy dress

But when their held for pleasure

Their one's that I like best



My balls are always bouncing 

To the left and to the right

It's my belief that my big balls

Should be held every night!



(Chorus)



And I'm just itching 

To tell you about them

Oh we have such wonderful fun!

"Cut this."



I am hot and when I'm not

I'm cold as ice

Get out of my way

Just step aside

I've paid the price

"The following is a true story,

 I'll tell you,

 The names have been changed,

 To protect the guilty."



Well, I left my job in my home town

And I had a couple smoke

Gotta rock 'n' roll band

And a fast five hand

Gonna get to the top

Nothings gonna stop us, no nothing.



So if you got the money

We got the sound

You put it up 

And we'll put it down

You got the dollar

We got the song

Gonna boogie-woogie

All night long.



Yeah boogie



I got holes in my shoes

 Got holes in my teeth

 Got holes in my socks

Can't get no sleep



And I'm trying to make a million



And I got patches on the patches

On my old blue jeans

Well, they used to blue

When they used to be new

When they used to be clean



But I gotta a momma, whose a home and

Just keeping me alive

While I'm and the band

Go drinking with the boys

She's working 9 to 5.



"She knows here place that woman"



Just you wait

One of the these days see me

Driving 'round town in my

Rockin Rolls Royce with phone

Booth down.

My bottle of booze

No summer time blues

Sha Na Na look at me

And my Rock 'n' Roll voice



No it aint no fun, waiting 'round to be a millionare

It aint no fun, waiting 'round to be a millionare

Do you believe me?

No it aint no fun, waiting 'round to be a millionare

No it aint no fun, do you believe me?

Waiting 'round to be a millionare

 

Drive a Rolls Royce car, No, No, No, No...



No it aint no fun, waiting 'round to be a millionare



No it aint no fun - Oh no..

No it aint no fun (Aint no fun) - That's what I said

No it aint no fun (Aint no fun) - And I wanna be rich

No it aint no fun (Aint no fun) - There no fun being with this bitch



No it aint no fun, waiting 'round to be a millionare

Ride On

---- --



It's another lonely evening

In another lonely town

But I ain't to young to worry

No, I ain't to old to cry

When a woman gets me down



Get another empty bottle

And another empty bed

Ain't to young to admit it

And I'm not to old to lie

I'm just another empty head



Mmmm, That's why I'm lonely

I'm so Lonely

But I know what I gotta do..



I'm gonna ride on, ride on, ride on

Standing on the end of the road.

Thumb in the air

One of these days 

I'm gonna change my evil ways

'Till then I'll just keep on ridin' on.



Broke another promise

And I broke another heart

But I ain't to young to realize

That I ain't to old to try

Try to get back to the start



And it's another red-light nightmare

Oh, Oh, On another red-light street

And I aint to old to hurry

'Cause I ain't to old to die

But I sure am hard to beat



But I'm lonely, God, I lonely

What am I gonna do?

Ride on, Ride on

Got myself a one way ticket

Going the wrong way

Gonna change my evil ways

One of these days



Ride on

Ride on

I'm gonna

Ride on

Ride on

Looking for a truck

Ride on

Ride on

Keep on ridin'

Ridin on and on and on and on and on and on and on

I must have a good time

Oh yeah, ride on

One of these days

One of these days

She said she'd never been

Never been touched before

She said she'd never been

This far before

She said she'd never liked

To be excited

She said she always had

Had to fight it

(And she never won)

She said she'd never been

Never been balled before

And I dont think 

She'll ever ball no more

(Fixed her good)



Squealer, when I held her hand

Squealer, I made her understand

Squealer, When I kissed her lips

Squealer, Sucked her finger tips

Squealer, Who started getting hot

Squealer, Made it hard to stop

Squealer, Got to much

          I think I got a magic touch
