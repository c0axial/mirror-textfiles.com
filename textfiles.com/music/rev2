SPIRITUAL MUSIC ADVICE 'N' STUFF
  by Rev. Richard Visage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  Ever wonder why there's so many music dinosaurs out there? It 
seems to me like, back in the bad old days, a band would get a hit or 
two, then deservedly fade into obscurity. Say, for instance, Freddy and 
the Dreamers -- I think they had one horrid hit with "Do the Freddy", 
and maybe a backup hit with a loathsome ballad, and then were never 
heard of again. Freddy probably became an insurance salesman dressed 
in doubleknits, and yeah, he's the guy that came to your front door, 
smoking a cheap cigar.

  He deserves it, too. But then there's others that just never seem to 
go away. The first time I saw Eric Clapton play, he was with Cream, and 
he was generating serious guitar magic at the time. He played wildman 
blues and psychedelia, did amazing improvisations, and enunciated his 
guitar work like no one in the business. He was a certified guitar god, 
and deserved the title.

  Things changed. Eric joined the super-ego super-group Blind Faith
and was still brilliant. After the one and only album that Blind Faith 
produced, he joined the musical debacle called Delaney and Bonnie and 
Friends. Worse, he sang. Worse, as his career continued, he didn't stop 
singing. Ugh. Let's spin a CD, kids.

Back to the Cradle,
Eric Clapton
------------------

  Who could possibly disapprove of Eric Clapton doing a back to the
roots pure blues album? I just know all the critics are going to rave 
over this one just out of purity of concept. 

  And it is a good idea. Hell, he's put together some extra-fine blues 
musicians for this album and done all the recordings on a single take. 
Is this great or what?

  Well, first of all, Slowhand can still pick. Bigtime. There's some 
absolutely technically brilliant guitar work on this album. The band 
is relentlessly professional. And the whole thing is tired, tired, 
tired. There's so rarely a trace of emotion, or real blues feeling on 
this album, that it could be made into one of those New Age sleep-
inducing tapes. Ms. LaBamba steals the remote control from me when I 
listen to this album, and quickly changes the disc. Can you argue with 
a woman who wears spandex and garters?

  Oh, and the vocals deserve mention. With the exception of a 
small bit of backup vocals, it's all Eric. Eric, his nasal whine, and 
twenty years of failed vocal training. It's so laboured at times as to 
be downright hilarious. To really enjoy this album, you need one of 
those karioke machines that can tune out the original vocals on the 
track. The only song that really works on this album is an acoustic blues 
track, "Driftin'", which is reminiscent of the pathos-ridden Tears in 
Heaven, and doesn't require much in the way of vocal gymnastics. Again, 
absolutely wonderful guitar work on the acoustic box. 

  Well, I'm sure that you're going to buy this one, despite my ranting 
about it. But, let's make a bet. In a year from now, you'll find this CD 
second from the bottom in your pile, look at it, and think about putting 
in on. But, you'll just stick it back on the bottom of the pile. Delete 
bin, here it comes.

  As your spiritual advisor, might I suggest that you pick up J.J. 
Cale's new release, Closer to You, instead?  J.J. is the author of some 
of Clapton's bigger hits, "Cocaine" among them, and is held in godlike 
esteem in the UK and in parts of Canada. He's also the gentleman whose 
guitar style is most imitated by the likes of Clapton and Mark Knoffler. 
This is real Okie pop/blues, it doesn't to pander roots purists, and it 
has the feel of musicians who love, and are lost in, the music. The 
album starts with the blues/rocker "Long Way Home" and winds through the
hypnotic vibe-powered "Slower Baby" and winds up with "Steve's  Song", 
an absolutely sparkling instrumental. One could criticize some of the 
lyrics as being a little to simplistic or Okie, but they don't detract 
from the music.

  I'd mention that Ms. LaBamba gets naked every time I play it, but 
that'd probably encourage folks to buy the album for all the wrong 
reasons. Or, maybe not.
