The Song Remains The Same
(Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

I had a dream - crazy dream
Anything I wanted to know
Anyplace I needed to go.

Hear my song - sing along
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow.

California sunlight, sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright - the song remains the same.

Sing out Hare Hare, dance the Hoochie Koo.
City lights are oh so bright, as we go sliding
                                       sliding
                                       sliding through.

The Rain Song
(Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

This is the springtime of my loving -
        the second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing -
        so little warmth I felt before.
It isn't hard to feel me glowing -
        I watched the fire that grew so low.
It is the summer of my smiles -
        flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
Speak to me only with your eyes -
        it is to you I give this tune.
It isn't hard to recognise - 
        these things are clear to all from
                              time to time.
Talk Talk -
I felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us
        but I know that I love you so
        but I know that I love you so.
These are the seasons of emotion
        And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion -
        I see the torch we all must hold.
This is the mystery of the quotient - 
        Upon us all a little rain
                        must fall.

Over the Hills and Far Away
(Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

        Hey lady - you got the love I need
        oh Maybe - more than enough
oh Darling Darling walk a while with me
        - oh you've got so much -

Many times I loved
  Many times been bitten
    Many times I've gazed
      Along the open road.

      Many times I've lied
    Many times I've listened
  Many times I've wondered
How much there is to know.

Many dreams come true
  And some have silver linings
    I live for my dream
      And a pocketful of gold.

Mellow is the man
  Who knows what he's been missing
    Many many men
      Can't see the open road.

      Many is a word
    That only leaves you guessing
  Guessing 'bout a thing
You really ought to know
You really ought to know.

The Crunge
(John Bonham/John Paul Jones/Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

Dancing Days
(Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows.

CHORUS

You know it's alright
I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

Crazy ways are evident
In the way that you're wearing your clothes
Suppin' booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow.

CHORUS

I told your mamma I'd get you home
But I didn't tell her I had no car
I saw a lion he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar.

CHORUS

Dancing days are here again
As the summer evening grows
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows.

CHORUS

D'yer Mak'er
(John Bonham/John Paul Jones/Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh
Baby please don't go.

Ay ay ay ay ay ay
All those tears I cry ay ay ay ay ay
All those tears I cry ay ay ay ay ay
Baby please don't go.

CHORUS

When I read the letter you wrote me
it made me mad mad mad
When I read the news that it brought me
It made me sad sad sad
But I still love you so
I can't let you go
I love you - ooh baby I love you.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Every breath I take oh oh oh oh oh
Every move I make oh oh oh oh oh
Baby please don't go.

Ay ay ay ay ay
You hurt me to my soul ay ay ay ay ay
You hurt me to my soul ay ay ay ay ay
Darling please don't go.

CHORUS

Oh oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh
(Baby please don't go)

(Whatever happened to Rosie and the Originals?)

No Quarter
(John Paul Jones/Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

Close the doors, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through
They choose the path, were no-one goes
They hold no quarter,
They ask no quarter.

Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you
They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter, they ask no quarter.

The Ocean
(John Bonham/John Paul Jones/Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Ain't no time to pack my bag, my foots outside the door
Got a date, can't be late tfor the high hopes hailla ball.

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the oceans roar
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more
Singing of the good things and the sun that lights the day
Singing to the ocean, has the ocean lost it's way.

Sitting round singing songs til the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start.
