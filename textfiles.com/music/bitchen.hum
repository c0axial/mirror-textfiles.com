  Hey Jack... What's Happenin'?

  I dunno..

  Well ahh, Rumor around town says you might be thinkin about goin' down to the
shore.

  Ahh, Yeah, I think I'm going to go down to the shore.

  What ya gonna do down there?

  Ahh, I dunno. Play some video games, buy some Def Leppard T-shirts...

  Don't forget your Motley Crue T-shirt.. Ya know, all proceeds go to
get their lead singer out of jail!

  Uh huh.

  Hey, ya gonna check out The Sand Bar while you're down there?

  Ahh, what's The Sand Bar?

  Ahh, It's a place that lets 16-year-old kids drink!

  Aww Cool!

  Yeah. Hey, guess who's gonna be there?

  Uh, Who?

  Our favorite cover band, "Crystal Shit"!

  Wow!

  Yeah, they do a door show. You'd really be impressed, in fact it goes a little
like this...

	  Love me two times baby, Love me twice today,
	  Love me two times, girl, Cause I've got AIDS!
	  Love me two times baby, once for tomorrow,
	  Once cause I've got AIDS!

  Pretty good Jim Morrison imitation there. I hope those guys have a GOOD sense
of humor and DON'T take us into court.

  Ahh what's the court?

  Never mind that. The important thing here...

  The People's Court!

  Well, that's another story. The important thing here is that we get to the
part where you ask me how I'm going to get down the shore.

  Oh, how you getting down to the shore?

  Funny you should ask, I've got a car now!

  AWw Wow, how'd you get a car?

  My folks drove it up here from the Bahamas.

  You're kidding!

  I must be, the Bahamas are islands. Ok, the important thing here is that you
ask me what kind of car it is.

  Ahh, what kinda car do ya got?

  I've got a BITCHIN CAMARO.


      Bitchin Camaro, Bitchin Camaro, I ran over my neighbor.
      Bitchin Camaro, Bitchin Camaro, now it's in all the papers.

      My folks bought me a bitchen camaro with no insurance to match,
      So if I happen to run you down, please don't leave a scratch!

      I ran over, some old lady, one night at the county fair,
      And I didn't get arrested, cause my dad's the mayor!

      Bitchin Camaro, Bitchin Camaro, They're outside your lawn,
      Bitchin Camaro, Bitchin Camaro, Tony, Orlando and Dawn!

      When I drive, past the kids, they all spit and cuss.
      Cause I've got a bitchin camaro and they have to ride the bus!

      So ya better get out of my way, when I come through your yard,
      Cause I've got a bitchen camaro and an Exxon credit card!

      Bitchin Camaro, Bitchin Camaro, Hey man where ya headed?
      Bitchin Camaro, Bitchin Camaro, I jump on and sped it!
