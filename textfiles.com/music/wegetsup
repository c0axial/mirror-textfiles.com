WE GETS UP IN THE MORN
traditional

WE GETS UP IN THE MORNIN'
WE SOUND THE HARVEST HORN
OUR MASTER HAS ORDERS FOR TO MIND
FIRST THING WE TAKES IN HAND 
IS THE STOPPER FROM THE CAN
AND SO EACH MAN CAN DRINK 
UNTIL THE BOTTOM HE FIND
THEN EACH MAN SHALL TAKE HIS PART
AND WORK WITH HAND AND HEART
WHILE THE GLORIOUS SUN DO SHINE
DO SHINE, WHILE THE GLORIOUS SUN DO SHINE

OH, THE MASTER BRINGS THE CAN
HE'S A JOLLY HEARTED MAN
GO'ON ME LADS AND TAKE A DROP O'THE BEST
WHA', DON'T YA STAND AND TRATTLE
WHEN YE HEAR THE WAGON'S RATTLE
FOR THE SUN SHE IS A'DRAWIN' TO THE WEST
TO THE WEST, FOR THE SUN SHE IS A'DRAWIN' TO THE WEST

HERE'S THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER DEAR
BREWS US PLENTY OF STRONG BEER
WITH CHEESE ENOUGH TO CHEER UP ANY SOUL
EACH MAN SHALL DRINK AND SAY,
"HEAVEN BLESS THIS HAPPY DAY!"
WHEN WE CROWN THE HARVEST WITH THE FLOWIN' BOWL
FLOWIN' BOWL, WHEN WE CROWN THE HARVEST WITH THE FLOWIN' BOWL
