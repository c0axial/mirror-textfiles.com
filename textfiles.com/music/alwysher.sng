Always a Herald (Sung to "Always a Woman" by Billy Joel)
   
   New Lyrics by Silverwolf Moonshadow
   
He can call you in court 
And bring tears to your eyes
He can lose your device 
In his casual files
And he only will read 
What is in Heraldese
    
He draws like a child,
But he's always a herald to me....
   
He will check your device
He can pass you or fail you
You can show him your proof
But he'll never believe you
And he'll take your four copies
Along with his fee..
  
Yeah he charges too much 
But he's always a herald to me..
   
<Chorus>
Oh he takes care of your name
It can wait if he wants
He is always behind
Oh and he never gives out
He just keeps taking in
And gets further behind
   
And he'll summon you forth
In front of the kingdom
Then he'll vocally praise you
And smile while your kneeling
But he'll shout out your name
Just as wrong as can be
  
Blame it all on the scribe
Cuz' he's always a herald to me
  
<Hum Chorus>
   
He's frequntly loud
And he's seldomly clear
He cries poorly at Pennsic 
For he's full of cheap beer
And he can't be retired
He does it for free
     
And the most he will do 
Is shout O'yez at you
But he's always a herald to me....
   
<Repeat Chorus>
<Hum Chorus>
    
What do you think??  Should i hang up my chances of passing a device for the
next few years??    Should i put away the Pursuivant's Handbook and take up
fighting to defend myself???
   
Silverwolf Moonshadow....Bowing deeply
