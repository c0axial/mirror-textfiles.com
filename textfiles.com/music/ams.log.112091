AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)
