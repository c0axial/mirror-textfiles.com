MusicNet is a brand new network devoted to all aspects of all types of
music.  Whether your interest is in rock, country, jazz, classical, rap or
the blues, MusicNet is for you.  Whether you are a musician or simply a
fan, MusicNet is for you.  Whether your interest is in messages or files or
both, MusicNet is for you.  Simply put, if you have any interest at all in
music, you'll probably find something in MusicNet to your liking.

Features and benefits of MusicNet include the following:

#  Membership is FREE!  Your only costs will be any phone charges, if
you're not able to get a local hub.

#  Based on Fido-technology.  This simply means that if your software is
Fido-compatible, you should have no problem running MusicNet.  MusicNet
uses zone 808 and with a musicnet.ftn domain.

#  A policy based on democracy.  All major decisions are decided on by the
general membership.  This includes the addition and deletion of any and all
echoes.  As ZC, my vote counts the same as anyone elses.  In addition, all
policy proposals will be given plenty of time for discussion before any
voting takes place.  Nothing will be shoved down anyone's throat.

#  Charter membership.  That really doesn't mean anything, except that
because MusicNet is still in its infancy, you have a greater chance to help
shape it into something you can really enjoy and be proud of.

#  Fast growing.  Despite still being in diapers <g>, MusicNet is already
reaching the USA, Canada, Germany and the UK, with very good prospects for
spreading into still further countries in the near future.

# Bright future.  This is not a network that has been around for years and
has gotten stale and boring.  This is a network with a lot of excitement
and potential.  There is no reason why it shouldn't continue to grow and
grow and grow.  Plateaus are for people lacking imagination and drive.  Not
a problem in MusicNet.

You'll note the Internet-style echo names.  This allows for better echo
organization and easier wildcard areafixing.  It does _not_ mean you can
expect to find Internet echoes and those huge Internet headers.

Here are the current MusicNet file echoes:

M-ADM     MusicNet Administration Files
M-MIDI    MIDI Data Files
M-MODS    Noise/Sound/ProTracker MODs

M-PICS    Music-related Pictures (GIF, JPG, etc.)
M-SOUNDS  Music-related Samples (AVR, SPL, WAV, etc.)
M-TEXT    Music-related Text Files

If you become a MusicNet sysop and feel there should be other message
and/or file echoes, you have every right to propose new echoes and have
them voted upon.  There's no guarantee they'll become accepted, but at
least it will be decided by the general membership and not a dictator.
