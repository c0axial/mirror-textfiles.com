All releases in the UK are through MUTE records.

Several American 7"'s and 12"'s are included, mostly because they are items
of interest to collectors (either because they contain new versions, or a large
collection of versions, making them more value for money). All American
releases are through SIRE records (a division of WEA).

All Australian releases are through Possum Records (a division of BMG).

Singles will be listed first, followed by records and solo recordings.
The discography is in the form: year, month, record+tracks, catalogue number.

It is fitting that the singles listing is ended here.
'Enjoy The Silence' comemorates the anniversary of ten years of product for
Depeche Mode. Of course they are quick to mark this with the release of the
Quad remix of ETS - remixed by seven people, clocking at a staggering 15:37,
and easily the best remix they've ever done, encompassing such diverse
moments as a string section, and samples from rap records!
The next single (released in Australia on June 4) is 'Policy Of Truth (remix)'

.

The next part of the discography is Depeche Mode's albums. These will be
presented in the format: year, month, title, track listing and catalogue number
listing. The catalogue numbers will be in the order: record, CD, cassette.

That is the end of Depeche Mode's albums to date.
The list of extra tracks on the compact disc releases is not complete, due to
the fact that extra tracks are released in some countries and not in others.
I hope to have all extra tracks included in the repost.

Both Martin Gore and Alan Wilder (alias Recoil) have recorded solo albums.
They are as follows:

 Solo Albums.
 -----------

Recoil
------
1986 ??? Recoil 1+2: Recoil 1 / Recoil 2
            STUMM31
         ----------

1988 ??? Hydrology: Grain / Stone / The Sermon   (CD includes 'Recoil 1'
         ---------  'Recoil 2')                              STUMM51,CDSTUMM51

Alan Wilders recordings are very experimental and ambient, containing a lot
of sampling from sources that range from African Zulu chants to Depeche Mode
themselves!

Martin L Gore.
--------------
1989 Jun Counterfeit e.p: Compulsion / In A Manner Of Speaking /
         ---------------  Smile In The Crowd / Gone / Never Turn Your Back
                          On Mother Earth / Motherless Child
                                                             STUMM67,CDSTUMM67

Martin Gore's solo efforts, all cover versions, are, by his own admission, very
much like Depeche Mode themselves. If I had to pinpoint a song they are most
similar to, I'd say 'Sweetest Perfection', from 'Violator'.

                  --------------------

That is the FIRST version of this discography, it is by no means complete.
I would invite anyone who has anything to say, any suggestions, or corrections,
or questions to e-mail them to me.
I intend, within the next two months, to complete and correct the discography,
and include everything that I have left out of this posting. Including 'Policy
Of Truth' (any information on versions, cat numbers etc. are most welcome).

I especially invite American readers to correct any errors they find in the
US catalogue numbers I have included.
