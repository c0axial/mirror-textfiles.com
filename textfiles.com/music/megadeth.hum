.....Wake Up Dead
 
I sneak in my own house...it's four in the morning
I've had too much to drink...said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom...I slip into bed
I know if I wake her, I'll wake up...DEAD!
 
 I wonder, will she find out
  About the other, other lover
    Diana
 
Wake up dead (repeat 3)
 
 
.....The Conjuring
 
Welcome to our sanguinary sect of worship
Feel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathmatise all those who oppose us
Don't summon the devil
Don't call the priest
If you need the strength
The conjuring...OBEY!!
 
Behold! The flames rise from the compass' cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil and with the ashes you'll anoint.
 
Arrange the symbols of the wizard and magician
Light, the candles place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves place the lash from a black cat's eye
A straw of a broom, fold and burn and centralize
 
 Don't summon the devil
 Don't call the priest
 If you need the strength, the conjuring...
 
I am the devil's advocate, a salesman, if you will -- You know my name
I met your father years ago, gave him what he'd please -- He called my name
And you'll do the same
 
I'm claiming what is mine by right, it's time to close the deal
You're bought and sold...bought and sold
 
Come join me in my infernal depths, Mephisto's hall of fame
I've got your soul...I've got your soul
 
The comjuring...OBEY!!!
 
 
.....Peace Sells
 
Whaddya mean I don't believe in God? I talk to him every day...
Whaddya mean I don't support your system? I go to court when I have to...
Whaddya mean I can't get to work on time? Got nothin' better to do...
Whaddya mean I don't pay my bills...whydaya think I'm BROKE?
 
Huh?
 
  If there's a new way
  I'll be the first in line
  But it better work this time
 
Whaddya mean I hurt your feelings? I didn't know ya HAD any feelings...
Whaddya mean I ain't kind? Just not, YOUR kind...
Whaddya mean I couldn't be the president, of the United States of America?
Tell me somethin'...it's still "We...the People", RIGHT?
 
  If there's a new way
  I'll be the first in line
  But it better work this time
 
Can you put a price on peace?
 
Peace, peace sells...peace, peace sells...
Peace sells, but who's buying
Peace sells, but who's buying
Peace sells, but who's buying
Peace sells, but who's buying?
 
No.....no no no no
 
Peace sells...
 
 
.....Devil's Island
 
The light that fills my lonely cell is blocked out by the key
That locks the door into this hell the place they wanted me
Time is racing like the wind, execution's near
Oh Lord I wait for death and yes I have no fear
Recall that night my every breath and step along the way
Closed my eyes walking as danger paved the way
The devil and the darkness let her evil wander free
And here on Devil's Island, the final stop for me
 
 Devil's Island...Devil's Island
 
Oh there's no escape the sea is full of sharks
The tide takes you away to smash you on the rocks
The sun is shining but feel not today
Its warmth is dying and fading away
 
 Devil's Island...Devil's Island
 
Oh hear the call from the grave beyond
Oh so pernicious her soul it creates song
As there is no man that is here upon the earth
Able to terminate our noisome will since birth
The priest that reads the sermons, is walking next to me
To the stake, my last request, to have her burn with me
But so it did, the heavens opened, rain began to fall
The final judgment came and was spread before you all...
 
Final Judgment
 
Old weak and feeble but the lesson taught to me
To stay away from evil she doesn't care for me
She haunts me in my sleep although I tore that page away
And here on Devil's Island, I'll always have to stay
 
  Devil's Island...Devil's Island
   (repeat)
 
 
...Good Mourning/Black Friday
 
Good Mourning.
 
Hey I don't feel so good...something's not right...something's coming over me...
What the fuck is this?
 
*
 
Killer, intruder, homicidal man
You see me coming run fast as you can
A bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
 Bloodthirsty demon...sinister fiend
 Bludgenous slaughters...my evil deeds
My hammer's a cold piece of blood lethal steel
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal
Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads
Defiant defilers, you're next to be dead
 I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent
 Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head...yeah!
 
Their bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces til no features remain
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs, then cut off the head
The remains of their flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete
 I seek to dismember...a sadist fiend
 And bloodbaths are my way of getting clean
I lurk in the alleys, wait for the kill
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'M OUT TO DESTROY AND I -WILL- CUT YOU DOWN!
 
I see you and I'm waiting...for Black Friday
 
Killer, intruder, homicidal man
You see me coming run fast as you can
A bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the streets
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
 I lurk in the alleys, wait for the kill
 I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
  A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'M OUT TO DESTROY AND I -WILL- CUT YOU DOWN!
 
It's Black Friday...Paint the devil on the wall
(repeat)
 
 
.....Bad Omen
 
Down fell the stars as they splashed in the sea
Mi Nomine Baphomet, come dance with me
Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites
Their masters' time has come, the moon is full tonight
Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast
The devil who's watching with demons remote
Fire, rising, racing in your blood
Possessed, naive, his service is done
 
Bloody Blasphemy
 
Sinister's the word as the demons take their fill
An orgys' taking place human blood will spill
An act of worship as they conceive the ghouls
Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes
The ceremony, is sure to be cursed
They wait for his blessings but down comes the worst
Their bodies soulless, a corpse from the grave
Their minds are helpless and noone can save...
 
Noone can save them
 
 
.....I Ain't Superstitious
 
I ain't superstitious, when a black cat crosses my path
And I ain't superstitious as I break the looking glass
Ain't afraid of no demons, don't make me laugh!
I ain't superstitious, under the ladder I go
I ain't superstitious, it's all bullshit don't ya know?
Ain't afraid of the shadows, I like the dark anyway and that's a fact!
 
Superstitious
 
I ain't superstitious no such thing as bad luck
I ain't superstitious, I couldn't really give a fuck.
Take your stupid superstitions,
And find some other paranoidal, chickenshit, sissy worm and tell it to him
 
Superstitious
 
 
.....My Last Words
 
My life's on time, but again my sense is late
Feel a might unsteady, but still I have to play
Six to one's the odds, we have the highest stakes
And once again I gamble, with my very life today
 
Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam
Fill the terror chamber, now my mind begins to scream
Your life is like a trigger, never trouble till you're squeezed
And now you crack a smile, as you give the gun a tease
 
Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no the game starts in
A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin
Load another bullet, the second round begins
 
A couple grains of powder, a couple grams of lead
A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head
Take another drink and raise the last bets
Think about my last words, they might be what I just said
 
A click comes from the hammer, that couldn't drive a nail
Sense the numbing cold blue, or the red of Hades grill
A fraction of a second, do you lose or maybe still
Pass it to left, and collect your mighty kill
 
Add another bullet, the third round begins
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no the game starts in
Please no IOU's, no markers for death
Does anybody play...
 
Anybody?
 
Somebody!
 
Anyway...PLAY!
 
 
You (you), next victim...you...next to die
You (you), next victim...you...next to die
You (come on), next victim...you...next to die
You (come on), next victim...you...next to die...........
 
You...........
 
DIE!
