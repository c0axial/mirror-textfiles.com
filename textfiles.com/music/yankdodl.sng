THE YANKEE'S RETURN FROM CAMP
(song from Revolutionary War era)

Father and I went down to camp
Along with Captain Gooding
There we see the men and boys
As thick as hasty-pudding

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

And there we see a thousand men
As rich as Squire David
And what they wasted every day
I wish it could be saved

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

The m'lasses they eat every day
Would keep an house a winter
They have as much that I'll be  bound
They eat it when they're amind to

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

And there we see a swamping gun
Large as a log of maple
Upon a duced little cart
A load for father's cattle

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

And every time they shoot it off
It takes a horn of powder
It makes a noise like father's gun
Only a nation louder
                                                                               
     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

I went as nigh to one myself
As 'Siah's under-pinning
And father went as nigh again
I thought the duce was in him

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

Cousin Simon grew so bold
I thought he would have cock'd it
It scar'd me so I streak'd it off
And hung by father's pocket

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

But Captain Davis has a gun
He kind of clap'd his hand on't
And struck a crooked stabbing iron
Upon the little end on't

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

And there I see a pumpkin shell
As big as mother's basin
And every time they touch'd it off
They scamper'd like the nation

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

I see a little barrel too
The heads were made of leather
They knock'd upon it with little clubs
And call'd the folks together

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

And there was Captain Washington
And gentle folks about him
They say he's grown so tarnal proud
He will not ride without 'em

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

He got him on his meeting clothes
Upon a slapping stallion
He set the world along in rows
In hundreds and in millions

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

The flaming ribbons in their hats
They look'd so tearing fine, ah
I wanted plagueily to get
To give to my Jemima

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

I see another snarl of men
A-digging graves they told me
So tarnal long, so tarnel deep
They 'tended they should hold me

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy

It scar'd me so I hooked it off
Nor stopped as I remember
Nor turn'd about till I got home
Lock'd up in mother's chamber

     Yankee doodle keep it up
     Yankee doodle dandy
     Mind the music and the step
     And with the girls be handy
