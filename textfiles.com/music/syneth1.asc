                     Tone Shapes : A Novel Type of Synathesia

                               by Michael J. Zigler

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard Note...

            Synathesia (SynEthesia  in modern parlance) is the confusion of
            senses.  Such phenomena allows  the  subject  to  "see sounds",
            hear colors,  etc..  Any of the senses can be  mixed  with  any
            other sense as a means of perceiving in a different manner.

            This file  is  placed  on KeelyNet because it refers to a novel
            ability to see the geometric  forms of sound without the direct
            use of Chladni waveplates (vibrating plates covered  with  sand
            and excited by sound).

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The attention of   the  writer  has  recently  been  called  to  the
       occurrence in the experience of two Wellesley College undergraduates
       of an unique type of synaesthesia  in  which  the  sound  of each of
       several musical instruments  is  accompanied  by a distinctive  TRI-
       DIMENSIONAL FORM.

       The fact that  musical sounds are associated with color impressions,
       photisms, bidimensional patterns, etc. in the experiences of certain
       persons has been  reported  in various  places  since  Goethe  first
       mentioned the existence of this type of synaesthesia.

       The writer has  been unable, however, to discover  anywhere  in  the
       literature descriptions of   synaesthetic  phenomena  in  which  the
       patterns excited by musical instruments  are CLEARLY tri-dimensional
       in form.  (3D)

       Summary.  We have   reported   two  cases  of  a   novel   type   of
       synaesthesia.  In which  the  tones of different musical instruments
       give rise to correspondingly DIFFERENT tri-dimensional shapes.

       Every instrument excites a specific  form,  which  maintains roughly
       the same features at all pitches, intensities and durations.

                                      Page 1





       The higher pitches  occasion  smaller  and  lighter,  the lower ones
       larger and darker shapes.

       The forms may appear in colors, but  color is not always present and
       always plays a role secondary TO THAT OF FORM.

       These phenomena occur chiefly in solo rendition,  and  possess  high
       aesthetic appeal.  One subject has experienced the forms as far back
       as she can remember, the other discovered suddenly several years ago
       her capability of  realizing  them,  and  they  have since gradually
       somewhat improved in definiteness.

       There are striking differences in  the forms of the two subjects for
       the same instrument, but the general conditions of their arousal and
       alteration have many points in common.

       In view of  this  fact,  the  interpretation is made  that  the  two
       subjects represent a single type of synaesthesia.  Evidences for and
       against the hereditary  and  acquired  theories,  although  somewhat
       favoring the latter view, are inconclusive.

       Relationship of these shapes to EIDETIC  imagery is suggested in the
       almost perceptual character of the phenomena, especially in the case
       of Subject A, as well as in the fact that for Subject  B  under  all
       circumstances and for A under the more difficult conditions of their
       arousal, the shapes are realized under voluntary attention.

       Vangard notes...

           The discrepancy  in  the  forms  seen by the two subjects is the
           most disturbing feature of the  article.   Either  our  subjects
           were faking or there is a perceptual "translation"  method which
           differs between subjects.

           In addition,  the work of Persinger with very low level magnetic
           fields (lower than the Earth's  natural  magnetic  field)  shows
           that hallucinations and "eidetic" imagery can be induced.  It is
           even possible that the magnetic field in a very small local area
           can be modulated to induce such images.  We must also not forget
           magnetic phosphenes, generated by pressure on the closed eyelids
           to produce flashes of light in the eye.

           The late  Hans  Jenny  was attempting to construct  a  means  of
           viewing forms created from sound waves in three dimensions.

           Being aware   that   John   Keely  used  Chladni  waveplates  as
           analytical tools in his research  with  complex  vibrations,  we
           must also pursue such a line of investigation.

           Jenny used some form of very fine plastic pellets  which  had  a
           degree of  cohesiveness.   This tendency to "stick" assisted the
           formation of a structure in  the  Z  axis  (height)  and kept it
           together.  Another  approach used by Jenny was  magnetized  iron
           filings which  also  tended  to  stick  together  and  form most
           interesting patterns.

           In the late 70's, one of the popular magazines (I believe it was
           Popular Science), reported on  a substance called "Ferro-Fluid".
           When placed  in a container and held over a speaker  magnet,  it
           formed very complex 3 dimensional patterns.

           Ferro-Fluid seems to have been very fine metal filings suspended
           in an  oil in the form of an emulsion.  An address was given for
           those wishing to buy it, but we have yet to locate the article.

           One of our approaches will be a very light, clear oil, something
           like vegetable or mineral oil,  to hold such magnetized filings.
           This should  provide a beginning for the study of  3-dimensional
           forms induced by sounds.
