AFC Eddie  Greg, how's your MS problem coming?

ELECTMUSIC Need further consulting... Joyce :)

AFL JoyceM What is the MS problem, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Have you used the D5 for Midi Input into MStudio?
           I seem to get the default note value for any rhythm I input?
           ie. If I have a quarter note selected and play a whole note...
           only a quarter note will appear on the screen

AFL JoyceM Rhythm from the D5 disk or your own rhythm input?

ELECTMUSIC My own rhythm

AFL JoyceM Hm....I will check that out.  Don't remember it being a problem

ELECTMUSIC Yet my other Midi instrument works fine

AFL JoyceM I know I didn't have problems with the Yamaha.  But will re-check
           the D5.

ELECTMUSIC Yep, I didn't have any problem with my Yamaha either
           It was just with the Roland

AFL JoyceM Eddie, do you have problems with your Roland and MStudio?

AFC Eddie  No, not at all.

ELECTMUSIC Eddie... do you have any Yamaha equipment?

AFC Eddie  I've used it with MStudio rarely, but without problem.
           No Yamaha stuff,  sorry.

AFL JoyceM Dan, we we will be discussing what is in our libraries tonight and
           any other subject that arises.

AFC Eddie  Bet Gene knows the answer to this one!

ELECTMUSIC Yea, I think so...Gene, quick question for ya

AFA Gene   ok :)

ELECTMUSIC I tried to Midi in a D5 into MStudio and all it would display is
           the default rhythm value...Example:  If a quarter note was
           selcted and I played a whole note it would only display a
           quarter note.  Any ideas?

AFA Gene   This is a problem with the MIDI signal that the D-5 sends. There's
           really nothing that can be done about it that I know of. I've
           used my D-5 that way since I first got it, and I've never been
           able to find a way to get around the problem. It only occurs with
           Music Studio, no other program.

ELECTMUSIC Its alos curious that Mwriter works fine. Ok... Thats good new..
           well sort of

AFL JoyceM Greg, what happens if you you select an 8th note...I remember
           doing that to solve a problem that I can't remember now why :)

ELECTMUSIC I was wondering if it was the computer or the setup

AFA Gene   Actually, it's probably a problem with Music Studio's algorithm
           for processing MIDI data, because as far as I know the D-5's MIDI
           functions are 100% compatible with the industry standard.

ELECTMUSIC It will only display an eighth notethen, Joyce

AFC Eddie  Then why no problem with the Yamaha or the D20?

ELECTMUSIC The Problem was when MStudio was developed the Midi standard was
           still DEVELOPING :)

AFA Gene   Dunno. No problem with any other commonly-used keyboard, either.
           Strange.

AFL JoyceM Does a MIDI driver change this problem?

ELECTMUSIC Gene, I have heard of a couple other people who had this problem,
           but its the first time it happened to me.

AFC Eddie  Are you using MS's MIDI driver?

AFA Gene   It's just something with MS (the actual code) and the D-5 that
           doesn't jive perfectly.

ELECTMUSIC Yep, I agree Gene

ELECTMUSIC Remember when we had ALS online and they explained that they send
           a Midi signal out to make sure an instrument is hooked up :)
           Thats what caused Joyce's Yamaha to have MStudio crash

AFL JoyceM Yes....and I had one devil of a time getting the two to speak
           (with the Yamaha) and had to count before I turned on the
           Yamaha...16 - 20 seconds actually. It was a real hit and miss
           proposition.

AFC Eddie  A & L ?

ELECTMUSIC Audio Light and Sound

AFC Eddie  Thanks.

AFL JoyceM Greg...I will try it out...also going to look at a note I have
           about that..

AFC Eddie  What did they produce?

ELECTMUSIC Developed MStudio for Activision

AFC Eddie  Oh!  I knew the name was familiar!

ELECTMUSIC That was the golden age of the GS :)

AFL JoyceM Remember, that Big Red Computer Club is soon to release
           MusicStudio.. :)

AFC Eddie  BRCC's add for Noisetracker talks about a manual!

ELECTMUSIC How about a discussion on NTracker

AFL JoyceM A manual for NoiseTracker,Eddie?

AFC Eddie  That's what the add says. The program, a song disk and manual =
           $10.

AFL JoyceM Where did you see the ad, Eddie?

AFC Eddie  The latest InCider. Dec. issue. Page 67.

AFL JoyceM Oh, haven't gotten my inCider yet.

AFL JoyceM We will have BRCC here in AMS in January maybe

AFC Eddie  Lots of good Apple II stuff in this issue. A complete index of
           Apple II software released in 1991.                                  
ELECTMUSIC Yea, I thought I detected a slow change over

AFL JoyceM Finally!

ELECTMUSIC Hey, Maybe I might renew my subsription

AFC Eddie  I've heard a rumor that it will go back to all Apple II.

AFL JoyceM Like that rumor!

ELECTMUSIC I do like the glossy look...if it goes back to An Apple II mag

AFC Eddie  I really like GS+ magazine.

ELECTMUSIC But. its not glossy :)

AFC Eddie  One of these days I'll get around to writing a MIDI article for
           it. It's never had that.

AFL JoyceM Great, Eddie.

AFC Eddie  They asked me for one.

AFL JoyceM Let's talk about NoiseTracker if you all want...or whatever.
           Still looking for my Ms notes

ELECTMUSIC Yea... I have a few questions  Whats the story with the sound in
           Ram? How do they get it there

AFA Gene   You know the 64K DOC RAM? NoiseTracker stores its instruments in
           regular RAM, therefore instead of a 64K limit, the limit is your
           free memory! (so if you're someone like joyce, you can have a 4
           meg grand piano sample!)

ELECTMUSIC But, I also see instruments in DOC Ram, Gene

AFC Eddie  Why didn't anyone think of that before?

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   NoiseTracker tries to place the instruments in the DOC ram when it
           asks that question "Should 'I' try to move sounds into the
           DOCRAM" or something like that. You can actually hit "cancel" on
           that dialog and nothing will matter, cuz the program reads from
           the system RAM for those songs. (You can hit the button labeled
           "Ensoniq Soundram" and it will flip to system ram -- suddenly
           you'll see like 12 instruments when only 4 could fit in the DOCram

AFC Eddie  Thanks!

AFA Gene   the cool thing is that MOD files have been around on the Amiga for
           a loooong time, so there are a lot of good ones available. (there
           are also a lot of duds too tho.)

ELECTMUSIC Gene...who and how is it determined the instruments go into Doc
           Ram The user? or the composer

AFA Gene   The program. :) Those music files were not made for the GS,
           remember :)

AFL JoyceM Question.  Can one create a MOD file without having an already
           made file from say an Amiga?

ELECTMUSIC Oooooohhhh....I see, it only works with Amiga files

AFA Gene   Nope. Once the "Load" and "save" options are implemented, we might
           be able to.

AFC Eddie  Can you compose on NT, as in SS?

AFA Gene   Well, it also works with regular NoiseTracker files, but so far
           there aren't that many and they were all made from within
           NoiseTracker, so it was just a matter of loading the insts
           straight into DOCram.

AFC Eddie  How about SS songs on NT?

ELECTMUSIC Are the Amiga sound files ASIF? Yep, I tried SSMith into NT and it
           worked fine and SSmith used ASIF

AFA Gene   Dunno what format the amiga sound files are. Jim probably knows
           more about the MOD file structure than I. Yep, NT is made to
           handle SS directly.

AFC DYAJim MOD's are their own format - not asif or aiff...But I have heard
           that AIFF is popular on the amiga, perhaps the instruments that
           are combined in MODs were once individual AIFF's.

ELECTMUSIC Could we go back to MOd's on the Amiga for a second....

AFL JoyceM Sooo, we need a conversion program to convert SS, SL, etc files to
           MOD or NT?

AFA Gene   GMTA Jim, just about to say that.

AFC DYAJim We need several conversion programs right now :)

           NT -> SS (if no ram based insts)

           NT INST -> ASIF/AIFF

ELECTMUSIC On the Amiga... what do they use to reproduce sound? Also... is
           the GS capable of better sound with the Ensoniq?

AFL JoyceM Could one just rename the file type to MOD and see what happens,
           say with a MIDI file? or the like?

AFC DYAJim I doubt you can load midi files into nt :)

AFL JoyceM Gene, Greg...do you remember that program that Dennis was working
           on to do some conversions...wonder it that would work?  it was a
           beta version and never was released?

AFA Gene   In either case Greg, you're dealing with digitized samples, so it
           would sound the same on either machine.... in fact, i'm not sure
           on this, but it might...scratch that... the songfiles would
           almost definitely sound a bit worse on the GS cuz they've gone
           thru a conversion process that I'm not sure is 100% accurate.

ELECTMUSIC Is the Amiga 8 bit?

AFC DYAJim amoeba = 65k

AFC DYAJim How do you know they're converted?  I've just heard lots that the
           fidelity of the amoeba music chip is slightly cleaner and
           clearer, but it can only do 4 oscs at once.

AFA Gene   I mean when NT loads them in, it's converting the crunched sound
           file format. (Not sure at all on this, just speculating)

AFC DYAJim Crunched sound file format ?

AFA Gene   Whatever..... the mod :)

ELECTMUSIC Ahhhh... So the Amiga has a an amoeba nusic chip...

AFC DYAJim MODs aren't packed in any way to my knowledge

AFC Eddie  CFF, haven't you heard, Jim?

AFC DYAJim CFF?

AFC Eddie  Crunched File Format!

AFC DYAJim lol Eddie! :)

AFA Gene   There goes that theory, then... dunno... all I know is that some
           songs seem to sound clearer on the Amiga.

ELECTMUSIC what music software is being used on the Amiga to create these
           files?

AFC DYAJim I think it's the amoeba sound chip, Gene. Clearer and cleaner, but
           less powerful overall.

AFA Gene   Maybe they're comparing it to a standard GS without noise
           reduction. I'm sure with an Audio Animator's noise reduction the
           GS has to sound sharper (than the Amiga, I mean :)

ELECTMUSIC Anyone know what music software is being used on the Amiga?

AFC DYAJim I mean, you can play the same digital waveform on two different
           sound chips and chances are they'll play it slightly differently
           due to different things in the chips.

ELECTMUSIC I am not too impressed with AAnimators quality Gene.  They limit
           frequency response.

AFA Gene   I'm just talking about the noise reduction, not the digitizing
           greg

AFA Gene   Agreed Jim, which basically means the last 3 minutes of banter
           were complete gibberish. :)

AFC DYAJim :)

ELECTMUSIC I feel the best digitizing is FSound

AFC DYAJim Too bad it went bye bye Greg :(

AFL JoyceM And you can'g get Fsound anymore!

AFA Gene   I saw the logon.... weird, it said "COMPUTING's music and sound"
           as if the Forums were a magazine or something.

ELECTMUSIC Isn't that the way...

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene, I saw that in a previous AMS banner.

ELECTMUSIC Soo... does anyone know what music software is creating these
           files on the Amiga?

AFL JoyceM Weird, but no wyrm/banner? Sorry, Greg, I don't know.

AFC DYAJim I don't have an amoeba so I don't know

ELECTMUSIC Geez... some of the discussions in our forum seem be to from users
           that know both computer platforms, as if they can create these
           files and then port them over to the GS

AFL JoyceM So right now there is no way to convert to MOD files unless you
           have an Amiga?

Drib       do any of you guys have a Sonic Blaster?

ELECTMUSIC I have

AFC Eddie  Many of us, do, Drib.

Drib       figured, but I have to ask who

AFC Eddie  Got a problem with it?

Drib       Is it easy to digitize sounds>?

ELECTMUSIC I really like the concept of RAM based instruments!

AFC DYAJim IBM's can play MODs with soundblaster

AFC Eddie  Real easy, if you have a microphone.

Drib       I don't have one, but I want one, and am thinking about getting
           one.

ELECTMUSIC Convenient is a better word

Drib       okay, any microphone will do right?

AFC Eddie  Yes, or another connection from your sound source to the
           Blaster.

ELECTMUSIC OK, Jim that explains the interest MSDOS users have

AFC DYAJim Yep.. they have to buy addn'l hardware to play 'em; we don't :)

ELECTMUSIC :)

Drib       and Do the speakers that you plug into them need to be self
           powered?

AFC Eddie  Right, Jim!

AFL JoyceM Another feather in the GS' hat!

AFC Eddie  No, Drib, Blaster gives them Plenty of power!

Drib       okay, guess I will go ahead and get one then

ELECTMUSIC In summary then...

AFA Gene   Wondering... are there many Amiga users online wearing PCAO
           clothes?

AFL JoyceM Great, Drib...and if you have problems, we are here to help you.

AFC Eddie  Drib, I love my Sonic Blaster.  You can get one for $59!

ELECTMUSIC only Amiga users can create the music and sound for Mod files

Drib       Eddie, where? New????

AFL JoyceM $59 - where?

AFC Eddie   Preferred Computing. 1-800-327-7234.  $59.95 that is.  New.

ELECTMUSIC we have NTracker to convert these files for Listening only

AFA Gene   Exactly, greg... in its current form it's best suited as a
           playback module.

Drib       software and all right?

AFC Eddie  Yes.

AFL JoyceM Good questions, Greg....and we have to rely on others to give is
           these MOD files?

Drib       great! I found one for $75 used! that's way more

AFL JoyceM The classical MOD file (can't remember its name) is good.

AFA Gene   If AO didn't screw up we could simply tell users to use keyword
           PMU and grab as many MOD files as they want.

AFC DYAJim Exactly Gene..

AFL JoyceM If one downloaded MOD files from, say an Amiga BBS, no conversions
           needed? but can they be put on a regular ProDOS disk? and the
           used with NT?

AFA Gene   Yep.

AFC DYAJim I've downloaded MODs from an IBM bbs with no problems.

AFL JoyceM Ah...we have a big Amiga BBS here....hm...now if I can just find
           the time :)

ELECTMUSIC Its interesting the FTA saw the need for this... speculating
           why????

AFL JoyceM Jim, you going to write a MOD conversion program for us?  hint
           hint

AFC DYAJim Not enough time ! :) Who knows, really .. but not till next year
           at least

AFA Gene   FTA's always been into the Amiga.... this is just their first
           major cross-over project.

AFC DYAJim Convert what exactly tho?

AFA Gene   Nothing to convert with mod files, that's the beauty of it :)

AFC DYAJim I think FTA released it to go against the commericialization of
           soundsmith

AFL JoyceM Converting SS and SynthLAB files to NT/MOD files.  I like players
           like NT, etc, but want to be able to compose files too.

AFC DYAJim Compose with SS, import into NT.

AFC Eddie  Agreed, Joyce.

AFL JoyceM Right, Jim.

AFC Eddie  SS is not really composing software.  But maybe with MIDI...

AFL JoyceM right

AFC Eddie  Then a conversion to NT might be something!

ELECTMUSIC Jim... how will SndSmith allow for Ram Based instruments when
           converted into NT (in other words having a GS user break the 64k
           barrier DOCRAM)

AFC DYAJim It won't.  Lay down your midi in SS, then import to NT and add
           embellishments (I.E. up to 7 normal ram tracks)

ELECTMUSIC SndSmith still limits the import of ASIF sounbd files to 64k,
           right? <---- Not a real sndsmith user

AFC DYAJim Of course

ELECTMUSIC Geez, I would like to see the Amiga Music software they use to
           create these Mod Files.
