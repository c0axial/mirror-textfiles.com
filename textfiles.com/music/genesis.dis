Introduction and acknowlegements by the editor, Scott McMahan.

This is the most complete discography to date on Genesis, including
not only solo members' works, videos, bootleg recordings and radio
programs but also publications and organizations about the band.

This document is a labor of love by Genesis fans for Genesis fans. It
sets out to catalogue all the information about Genesis that can be
catalogued, for a number of reasons. The Genesis Discography offers an
historical record of Genesis' career, containing information that is
becoming less well known (and harder to find out) as time passes, so
that it will not fade away into the obscurity of the past. It also
allows the fan to explore other areas of Genesis that are not common
knowlege: Brand X, unreleased tracks, and others. It allows the
collector to have a very authoratative source for catalogue numbers
and release information by having information checked against more
than one source (nothing in this discography can be traced to only one
source). A printed version of this discography is large enough for a
doorstop or a small table, too.

While I edit this discography, and arranged for it to be compiled
originally, most of the sections were done by members of the
Internet's Genesis mailing list. The collections of worldwide members
have provided invaluable amounts of information.  In particular, Bob
Pietkivitch, Todd Satogata, Hugh Williams, Adrian Catchpole, and John
Chitalia (who did the Mike Rutherford section, which the editor lost
and found out John lost too, and John did it again!) have contributed
a lot of effort.  Crediting individuals as having done "a section" is
not easy, since once the framework of a section is in place, it gets
augmented from many other sources.

Information has been culled from Geoff ("Genesis Information Service")
Parkyn's discography, specifically the edition which goes up to 1983
and Three Sides Live.  The Peter Gabriel section is based on the
discography in "Peter Gabriel - an authorized biography" by Spencer
Bright, but has been extensively augmented.  Armando Gallo's Genesis
book has been used quite a bit for background material, and most of
the unreleased songs appendix.  Also, many (too?) many newspaper,
magazine, etc articles as well as interviews with the band in both
print and audio/video have been used to fill various holes.  Crediting
these sources within the body is practically impossible, because of
the mostly small bits included (which would make the text unwieldly to
read and the bibliography larger than the text).  Record Collector
magazine's 1968-1977 Genesis article (in #146, 10/91, pp.  62-66) was
a big help for catalogue numbers of rare early singles.

It is not our intent to plagiarize any source, or to take credit for
other people's work. Instead, the concept of this discography is to
take every datum about Genesis releases from every possible source and
assemble them together in one place, to have one reference volume for
information about Genesis. If anything, this is the synthesis of all
known data about Genesis presented in a way that makes it useful
information.

The inconsistent format and general disorder is a product of pasting
bits together a little at a time.  Neither I nor anyone else sat down
and wrote this, it evolved over a long period of time by adding small
bits one after the other. The original version of this document did
not even have a complete listing of all the Genesis albums.  The
overwhelming size of this discography and all the new information
coming in has made revisions in the format difficult, although they
are being attempted.  In one sense, the many sources are a benefit
since they provide confirmation and corrections. Any conflicting
sources are noted.

The occasional leftover 'I' or 'we' should be taken in the editorial
sense after this introduction.  (When the editor wants to refer to
himself in the first person, he tries to use "the editor" and not
"I".)

Every attempt has been made to present months not as numbers but as
three letter abbreviations.  Unfortunately, older leftover dates from
the beginnings of this document are in both American MM-DD-YY format
and European DD-MM-YY format. (This tends to be a problem with dates
like 03-05-73 when there's no cue about the format.  It would be nice
to have the month as a 3 letter abbreviation in all cases to remove
ambiguity.)  Use your imagination about ambiguous dates!

From the beginning, Genesis and the members' solo careers have
produced an overwhelming amount of material released in all different
formats all over the world.  More is unearthed every day, and the band
continues being as prolific as ever.  It is almost impossible to
catalogue everything that Genesis and their members have done. This
discography is probably conceptually larger than it physically is if
you consider all the things we haven't included.  It never ceases to
astound me that when I think I have Genesis releases under control and
there isn't much left to add, either I meet a new collector who has
things I never dreamed of, or some new outtake or bootleg is released
that I never anticipated.  This discography has attempted to go beyond
the normal brief discography listing the band's major works and to
explore every aspect of the band's recording history of interest (or
not, depending on how much you like Genesis) including songs never
released in any format. As a result, the discography is huge. An
abridged version is provided for those who don't want this level of
detail.

BRIEF INFO ON GENESIS MEMBERS
-----------------------------
Peter Brian Gabriel
    born May 13, 1950 at 16:30 in Woking, Surrey
    left the band in 1975, lead vocals
    [Note: Some sources say Peter was born in February,
     including Armando Gallo, who should be the definitive
     source. His exact birthdate is in question: May or Feb?]

Anthony George Banks
    born March 27, 1950 at 07:30 in East Hoathly, Sussex
    keyboards, piano

Michael John Cloete Crawford Rutherford
    born October 2, 1950 at 19:30 in Guildford, Surrey
    bass guitar, guitar (1978 onward)

Anthony "Ant" Phillips
    born December 23, 1951 in Putney, South London
    left the band 1970, guitars
    (yes, Ant is really his nickname)

Steve Richard(?) Hackett
    born February 12, 1950 at 17:05 in London
    joined the band in 1971, left in 1977, guitars

Philip David Charles Collins
    born January 30, 1951 at 00:05 in Chiswick, a London suburb
    drums, lead vocal (1976 onward)

Chester Cortez Thompson
    born December 11, 1948 in Baltimore, Maryland (USA)
    drums on tour only, starting in 1977

Daryl Mark Stuermer
    born November 27, 1952 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (USA)
    guitar/bass on tour only, starting in 1978.

In addition, Genesis has had several drummers (none of whom really fit
the band's style and/or who wanted to stay) before Phil joined:

Chris Stewart: the original drummer who went to Charterhouse

John Silver:   played drums on From Genesis to Revelation, and later
               became a television producer in Grenada, the last known
               information about him.

John Mayhew:   drummer for the Trespass sessions, no one knows what
               happened to him.

Bill Bruford (of Yes and King Crimson fame) played drums during the
1976 tour, live only (he was never a member of the band nor ever on a
studio album, as some erroneous accounts indicate). He was friends
with Phil and was in Brand X at a very, very early stage.

Mick Barnard, a guitarist with Farm, briefly joined to play guitar
after Ant left, but he didn't work out and soon left. (According to a
Trouser Press interview in 1982, Tony says Mick did write the guitar
parts for the Musical Box. This contradicts other accounts that say it
was written when Anthony Phillips was still in the band. He never
officially contributed any songwriting and was never given credit on
an album.)

Alphonso Johnson was approached to play bass (and guitar) after
Hackett left, but he didn't work out. He introduced the band to Daryl.

                             TERMINOLOGY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The word 'discography' is a very new word that was coined to describe
a listing or a book of musical releases, as in vinyl and CD discs.
The need for this word did not exist before published musical
recordings on mass media (and the fandom that comes with them) did. It
is similar to a bibliography, a list of books.  Usually the
discography is about one band or related group of artists. This
particular Genesis discography goes into a lot more detail in a lot
more areas than most discographies do. It would be more properly
called a compendium, but the name discography seems to sound better. A
lot of background information on various things is included to help
the reader understand unfamiliar concepts and terminology that
inevitably is part of any discussion of Genesis especially in regards
to collecting Genesis. Books, publications, sheet music, videos are
all generally not in a discography but are included in this one.

Abbreviations and other terms used (there seem to be a lot of
non-English phrases creeping in):

 WT:   working title (In the case of a song only appearing on b-sides,
       the WT and lyricist where known is listed only for the *first* 
       appearance of that song in the discography.)

       Genesis makes up working titles to describe the feel of a song
       that is not finished, in order to have some name to refer to
       it. Later, once the lyrics are done and the song is completed,
       they give it a real title. Working titles are not often
       revealed to the general public, and the scant few we have come
       from odd sources, most of the time they are mentioned in
       passing by the band in interviews. The '3x3' EP (qv) is the
       only (Genesis) release that has the working titles mentioned on
       the release itself. Phil Collins has been more open with his
       solo working titles than Genesis.

 FRB:  Felicity Roma Bowers, cover artist

 ISBN: International Standard Book Number, very long number used to
       uniquely identify books. Having an ISBN does not mean that a
       book is in print, and does not mean that a book can be ordered.

 KBFH: King Biscuit Flower Hour, popular American concert radio
       program that often records (-ed?) Genesis 

 UK:   United Kingdom, Britain

 b/w:  "backed with" normally used in a 7" single context where there
       is an A side and a B side. (This usage has crept into other
       singles where it refers to all the other tracks on the single
       besides the namesake.) 

 avec: French for "with"
 sans: French for "without"

 sic:  means the original source had what comes before the word "sic"
       verbatim, the error (or questionable part) is in the original
       source and is intentionally being reproduced in this
       discography and is not a typo on our part.

       Sic is Latin for so, thus.  (For example: "dutchess [sic]" --
       the source had that error, it was not made by the typist) 

 qv:   which see (that is, whatever is in front of the qv is also in
       the discography, and you can look it up for more information --
       example "Cell 151, qv" means you can look up Cell 151 somewhere
       and get more information on it) 

 caveat emptor: let the buyer beware, or there's a sucker born
   every minute. In this context it means if you send large
   amounts of cash to bootleg dealers and/or fan clubs and
   never get anything, it's your fault and not ours. The
   information is provided here for historical record and for
   completeness, and what you choose to do with that
   information is completely up to you. 

 caveat: without the 'emptor' it just means 'beware' or 'caution'.

 eponymous (noun), eponymously (adjective): in a musical.
   discographical context it means 'self titled'. Genesis has had one 
   eponymous album (in 1983). 

Notes on media:

7" means a seven-inch diameter, 45 rpm record.

12" means a 12 inch diameter record.

Oddly enough, in the UK, a 12" single is generally 33 1/3 rpm, while
in the USA it is 45 rpm.

An LP, long playing record, is usualy 33 1/3 rpm and 12" in diameter.

An EP is an Extended Play record, originally it was a vinyl (7" or
12", they seem to come in both sizes) single with several songs on it.
Now that CD singles are very common, this term is becoming an
anachronism since every CD single seems to have 4-5 tracks on it and
could be considered "extended". There is no exact definition of an EP,
in the record industry or among collectors, but they usually have all
new material on them, nothing from an album.  The Cell 151 EP (qv) is
an obvious exception to that "rule".  A single has at least one album
track.

The term 'album' can mean the abstract collection of songs under one
title, or a physical LP record. Context is usually sufficient to tell
which usage is intended.

CAS generally means cassette, except it is often in Charisma records'
catalogue numbers. CAS in a catalogue number means Charisma, not
cassette. (Kind of confusing, but the catalogue numbers came before
cassettes) C60, C90, C100 etc. mean a cassette of a specific length
(in minutes). Originally cassettes came in 60, 90, 100, and 120 minute
lengths with only a few oddball times like Radio Shack's 30 minute
Realistic tapes. Since the advent of the CD, cassettes of bizarre
lengths like 46, 50, 76 minutes have appeared to accomodate the
bizarre lengths of CDs. (Caveat: tape lengths over 100 minutes
generally mean the magnetic tape itself is very thin and easy to
break.)

CD is a compact disk. CD3 is a 3" diameter compact disk, a format
introduced for singles that was not well received and has practically
disappeared. CD5 is a 5" CD, the normal variety that is common for
albums as well as singles. 5" singles are the same physical medium as
album length CDs, but only have 2-3 tracks. Ones with 3+ tracks are
often called "maxi-singles" by the record company.

CD packaging is a very diverse and confusing area (especially since
the UK and the USA call the same CD packaging different things, and
even use the same name for different things). Notes on how CDs are
packaged have been included when possible. A brief primer on the terms
used to describe them is included here.

digipak...........fold-out cardboard with a plastic tray attached
2-CD digipak......digipak with two plastic trays attached for 2 CD's
jewel (UK)........thin clear plastic case, with insert-thing
thin jewel (US)...same as jewel (UK)
normal (UK).......normal 'album' CD case, with booklet
jewel (US)........same as normal (UK)
long box..........the cardboard box the jewel box comes in, which is
                  going to be discontinued spring 93
2-CD normal (UK)..2-CD album case, big thick ugly thing
2-CD jewel (US)...    (Seconds Out & The Lamb come in this)
thin 2-CD pack....don't know the proper name for this, same size as
                  normal case, but trays are thinner so two can fit in
new cases ........'Compac Plus' this is like a digipak but with a
                    stronger tray attached and a really awkward
                    'snap-open' clip
                  'Ecopak' is a combination plastic cardboard thing
                    that allows the shape of the long box in the store
                    and then folds down to a jewel box.

With variations on the above and experiments with different plastics!
All that is subject to change, and new ways of packaging CDs are being
created every day.

Now, a word about singles, primarily to explain the vast quantity of
post-Invisible Touch singles. This applies to the UK only, and the UK
chart system (and indirectly to the rest of the world, because these
singles are imported by other countries). For a single to count as a
single it must have less than 5 tracks and be less than 20 minutes in
length, otherwise it is considered an album. All CD singles count as a
different format of the same single, just as a cassette and a 7" both
count towards the chart position. There's a limit to how many formats
you can release though (around 5 ), and each format must (should) have
50% of the tracks the same.

Grouping note:

For the sake of sanity, radio shows and other broadcasts are lumped in
with "bootlegs" -- the term bootleg is taken to be anything not
released by the band on one of its official record companies.
(Italian bootlegs are a very grey area, since in Italy is is legal for
a venue to record a performance and sell it -- the band actually sees
revenue from this kind of record) Most radio shows of live
performances are ripped off by bootleggers anyway, and it is
practically impossible to find any of these shows for sale officially
by the people who recorded them.  Trying to separate the radio shows
from the bootlegs of them would be practically impossible, and lead to
a lot of redundancies.

Bootlegs and illegal recordings are included for the sake of an ideal
comprehensive catalogue of Genesis releases.  Their presence here does
not imply that we agree with bootleggers or the way they make money
off of fans' desire to hear Genesis music (it isn't Genesis that the
bootleggers are ripping off, it is the fans who want to hear their
music). Record dealers who place high pricetags on early singles and
make money off of the dedicated fan who wants to experience all the
Genesis music, even the b-sides, are hardly better than bootleggers
although they are more legal.  (Genesis releasing an album of b-sides
would put a lot of these people out of business.) But, bootleggers
have preserved a lot of things that Genesis fans can not hear in any
way other than illegal means, such as Peter Gabriel's famous
in-between songs stories which never appeared on any albums. For a fan
who wasn't around in the old days, bootlegs hold the only key to
unlocking the mysteries of Genesis.

Publications include both in and out of print books. Due to the
constantly changing nature of the discography and the publishing
world, it is impossible to keep tabs on which books are in print when.
There's not much you can do to get out of print books, except be lucky
and stumble across them in newspaper/magazine/etc ads or used book
stores.  Some dealers do handle books and other non-music collectibles
related to bands) The in print ones can be ordered by any reasonably
big music or book store.

SINGLES: interpreting the singles listings. It is very difficult to
find a format that will concisely list all the relevant information
about a single.

               Originally released in March, 1969.

     Re-releases of From Genesis To Revelation:

     [Being the only album Decca owns the rights to publish of
     Genesis, they have attempted to make as much money as possible
     off of Genesis' success -- which is good for fans who want to
     hear the first album, because it makes it available pretty
     cheaply. This is by no means a complete list!]

        take some of the negative opinions away from FGTR that Genesis
        showed later.

     Notes:    Recorded live at the De Montfort Hall & at the Free
               Trade Hall, Manchester, England, February, 1973.  

This album was originally planned to be a double album, with the
second record containing a full side-long version of "Supper's Ready".
According to Record Collector No. 146, Oct. 1991, one double album
test pressing of both sets was made, a Dutch release on the Philips
record label.  The number of copies in this run is not stated,
although it was probably very few. No one knows who owns any of them,
if any are even extant at this time.

There is a rare Italian limited edition of "Genesis Live", which does
NOT have the extra tracks, but came with a totally different limited
edition sleeve of Gabriel in his flower mask, surrounded by a white
border.  Charisma 636 9942L is the limited edition Italian release.

Special Notes on the Way We Walk series: According to Atlantic, Walk
II is to be available until April 30th and then sometime late in the
summer of 1993, the two discs are to be re-released together as a
two-disc set.  These plans have apparently fallen through, since the
records have continued to be available long past the time they were
supposed to not be. A test pressing or a promo version of the 2 CD set
apparently was made, in a black & white Digipak.

WE CAN'T DANCE SINGLES
----------------------

[Because the We Can't Dance album has spawned more singles than any
other Genesis album, probably more than all of them combined, they are
given their own section to make grouping and finding easier. Because
of changes in the record industry between Invisible Touch and the
widespread acceptance of CDs, the whole concept of a 'single' has
changed.]


The Invisible Series is a limited edition series of five Genesis CD
singles with previously unreleased live tracks. There are, for some
unknown reason, two Hold on my Heart singles.

Trespass Boxed Set
_Genesis on Compact Disc_ 
C.I.D. Productions, CID 11.

It comes in a 12" by 12" blue box that says "Genesis on Compact Disc"
at the top, with a circa 1976 picture of the band on the front with
Bill Bruford. Inside is an approximately 2 1/2' by 2' poster of PHIL
COLLINS AND HIS SERIOUS BAND dressed in circus costumes, similar to
the pictures in the program from that tour as well as the standard UK
Virgin/Charisma 1885 release of Trespass CASCD 1020 (qv). [The origin
of this is not known, whether it is an legal, planned release or a
bootleg/non-official release. Either way, it is definitely strange.
Probably some sort of a half-baked marketing scheme.]

    Text on the back of the album cover:

    First, a word of explanation. This special double-record set contains
    two Genesis albums originally released in 1971 ("NURSERY CRYME") and
    1972 ("FOXTROT").  Due to various problems, in the past few years they
    have not been available in the U.S.A.  Now, at last, we are again able
    to properly present these landmark recordings to the public.
    Newcomers to the Genesis camp should be delighted by these early
    masterworks (to this day, the band plays selections from them in their
    live shows); and the stalwart supporters of the last eight years or so
    will no doubt be ecstatic to have fresh copies.
    
    Secondly, a word (or two) of description: These two albums represent
    the first fully-formed statements by a band on the verge of
    international stardom, a band positively unique in the history of
    rock.  For the recording of "NURSERY CRYME," original members Tony
    Banks, Peter Gabriel & Michael Rutherford were joined by new recruits
    Phil Collins & Steve Hackett.  The combination produced a sound that
    meant magic to those early, fiercely-devoted followers.  The music was
    complex, yet highly accessible, very melodic, emotional and dramatic;
    the approach was orchestral yet subtle; the lyrical themes drew on
    myth, legend, fantasy and satire.  These two albums include such
    acknowledged rock masterpieces as "WATCHER OF THE SKIES," "MUSICAL
    BOX," "FOUNTAIN OF SALMACIS," and the incredible, side-long epic
    "SUPPER'S READY."  At the same time, their theatrical live
    performances advanced the state of rock a few light years, complete
    with a sophisticated use of costuming and mime (in the person of
    vocalist Peter Gabriel), plus superior sound and lighting.  But above
    all, there was indescribable magic in the music.
    
    Today, of course, Genesis ranks as one of the very top bands around
    the world, with sell-out tours and million-selling records.  Peter
    Gabriel and Steve Hackett departed the group to pursue solo careers,
    with Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford carrying on the
    Genesis torch to an ever-growing audience.  To their credit, Genesis
    has always been one of the most imitated bands around ...  but no one
    else has ever been able to duplicate their unique sonic recipe.

ROCK AGAINST REPATRIATION:

Charity project supergroup formed by Steve to try and raise awareness/raise
money to help stop the repatriation of the 'Boat People' in Hong Kong. There
was apparently supposed to be an album but this fell through so only the
following single was released from the project:

1989 Sailing/ Sailing (instrumental): IRS Records IRS 40/ CD5 IRSCD 40
   Both tracks written by Gavin Sutherland. Cover of Rod Stewart song.
   Produced by Steve Hackett and William Budis.

   From Anil Prasad's 1992 interview with Steve on his US tour:
   " 'Sailing' was the brainchild of Steve Hackett, and featured artists
   such as Brian May from Queen, Marillion (with Steve Hogarth), Fish
   (not with Marillion of course), The Moody Blues, Mike Rutherford,
   Godley & Creme, Paul Carrack, Phil Manzanera, Jim Diamond (one time
   Tony Banks' vocalist), Tears For Fears (Curt Smith), Howard Jones,
   Simon Phillips, Nick Magnus and The London Chamber Orchestra.
   (All in all a progressive rock fan's wet dream of a line up.)"

     Notes:    3 pics of Daryl.  Very jazzy sound - all instrumental.

     Liner text by Phil Collins, in introduction of Daryl, says:
     (Braces, '{}' indicate crossed out text.)
 
      I've know {Derwent}, {Darren}, Daryl since 1978.  His surname was
  a little problem to me then, and on occasion, still is now.  {Stue}
  Steurmer!  There at least I've done it.
      He first came into my life when Rutherford Minor of Genesis flew
  to New York, to find a guitar player who could tell him all the chords
  of the Genesis songs, so we could go on tour.
      Apparently, he breezed through the audition (I personally believe
  money changed hands).
      Soon we were roadworthy with Ruthers, Banks, Me, Chester and
  {Derek} Daryl.
      In 1980 Daryl worked on my first Solo Album, in no time at all his
  playing had degenerated to sounding like an electric razor on 'In the
  Air.'  Then came the Collins Solo Tour where he has an integral
  Jaccuzi and latex Hot Tub.
     As well as being a superb musician (at this point more money should
  change hands) he has been writing.  He co-wrote a few songs on 'No
  Jacket Required', a fact over-looked by many people.
      So here is one, {Don} Daryl's solo album, enjoy it, I know I have!

                                           Cheers,

                                            Phil Collins

   (P.S. Daryl: that'll be $11-75c + tax)

While Phil Collins was only sporadically involved with Brand X
throughout the 70s, the Genesis discography maintains a complete list
of known Brand X albums and even solo albums, since there is not
enough material to warrant a seperate Brand X discography. Thus
Masques, on which Collins didn't play, and post-Brand X (after 1982,
Brand X drifted apart, later to re-form in 1991) solo works.

Brand X was a title assigned by the recording engineer of a bunch of
session players who got togethers to make some music (jazz/fusion)
while Genesis was between tours initially. The group was initially a
project idea started by Phil Collins and Bill Bruford though Bruford
never played with the group.

As a side note, members of Brand X would also be involved with Phil
Collins, Peter Gabriel, and other Genesis members' solo projects.

    (See also Phil Collins, and most Brand X members are session players
     who have appeared on hundreds of records. John Giblin is a good
     example. Little known fact: John Goodsall is listed as the
     guitarist on Tony Basil's "Mickey" single from 1982, but did you
     really want to know that?)

    John Goodsall
      Fire Merchants 1989
      Instrumentals. Very hard rock, harder than anything with Brand
      X. CD purportedly has an extra track not on LP.

        Goodsall: guitar
        Doug Lunn: bass
        Chester Thompson: drums

    Percy Jones
      Cape Catastrophe (first solo album, details unavailable, label:
       Hot Wire West German) Released in early 80s.
       Programmed drums and keys, him playing bass, described as being
       in a techno-fusion vein.

      Hex -- Joes had a band called Hex, which has never released an
       album, although a release is (was) rumored. The band is made up
       of Jones, Mark Wagnon on electronics, and Frank Katz on drums.
       They did do gigs, and played mostly tunes from Cape Catastrophe
       as well as a number of new ones. Nothing from the Brand X days
       though.

  [NOTE: This is not a complete list by any stretch of the imagination.
  It would be almost impossible to compile a *complete* list.
  The term "bootleg" has been used in this context to include
  anything that has not been officially released by Genesis. This
  includes bootlegged albums, radio shows, outtakes.

  Bootlegs are listed in chronological order by the dates of the
  concerts they are taken from. Compilation bootlegs are at the end,
  they're ones that take material from more than one show and can't be
  easily placed in order. Every attempt has been made to get bootlegs
  from the same performance (Montreal 1974, for example) together, but
  there may be slip-ups.

  Really significant bootlegs are listed first. These have on them
  rare non-album tracks and other important songs.

  Sound note: the sound quality listings are by their very nature highly
  subjective. One person's excellent is another's unlistenable. Even
  more difficult is the fact that different versions of the same bootleg
  can sound incredibly different (the editor has heard two tapes made
  from LPs of The Bedside Yellow Foam, for example, and one sounds very
  good and the other is terrible). The sound guides are here to give you
  some idea what the recordings sound like, so if you want to get them
  you won't wind up making a $60 mistake (buying CDs). Remember: caveat
  emptor, let the buyer beware. Especially for the older shows, your
  best bet is always King Biscuit. They have the highest degree of
  profesionalism in recording shows, and generally their sound is great.
  (The bootleggers transferring a KBFH show onto vinyl may not share the
  high standards, so a KBFH show is best obtained directly from a KBFH
  source. These originals are unfortunately extremely rare and also
  very, very expensive.)

  Special Note on Radio Programs: Radio shows like the King Biscuit
  Flower Hour and Rockline are distributed to radio stations via CD, or
  --in earlier days, and some even today-- LP record. These are
  meant not to be sold to collectors and fans. Some 
  pressings, however, naturally leak out to the public. These sell for
  fantastic sums of money at places like record shows and Goldmine (qv
  in the publications section). They are incredibly rare, especially the
  vinyl pressings, because so few are available. The prices are
  outrageous. Tapes of radio shows from the air are much more abundant
  (and much less expensive). Very little information on the actual
  pressings released to radio stations is available, because of the
  rarity of seeing these.  No other Genesis discography (the editor has
  seen) has even attempted to compile information on radio shows.

  Songwriter credits are the same as the albums.
  Musicians are the same as for the albums, with these additions:

   * Bill Bruford played drums on the 1976 tour.
   * Chester Thompson has played drums on tour since 1977.
   * Daryl Stuermer has been the guitarist on tour since Hackett left
     the band. 
   * The Earth Wind & Fire horns played occasionally during the Abacab
     tour on the songs they played on the album. This is the only time
     they have played with Genesis.]

  Format notes:

  A "none" in the Name: field means the bootleg hasn't been released
  with a name, ie it is a radio show or something. A ? or "unknown"
  means there is a name, only it isn't known. Sometimes a description
  has slipped into the Name: field.

  A 'venue' is the city when the exact place they played is not known.
  Sometimes it is even the country when the city isn't known...

Format for bootleg entries -- not all may apply to each bootleg, and
in some cases they're unknown. If it isn't listed, it was not known at
the time the entry was made. Better partial info than none at all.

On the top is says in very tiny letters

John & Tony Smith in conjunction with CHARISMA presents

then follows a picture in the style of the Trick of the Tail drawings
which was taken from page 116 of the book 'Genesis - Turn It On Again
The Illustrated Genesis Story'.

The booklets are multi-folded with one big photograph inside and
several pages from the book mentioned above plus a few more tiny color
photographs taken at concerts in the Gabriel era.

...on the back side there's that drawing of the man with the hat
(taken from Alice In Wonderland) as a reference to Charisma Records.
On the CDs itself EXR is explained as 'Extremly Rare' which is written
on a big blue X. [Charisma is defunct, this can't be a Charisma
release. They must have pirated the logo --ed]

    All songs written by Genesis except where noted

    Produced by:    APPAZ KNARF       (read these two credits backwards)

2. Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Part 2, 2 different mixes
3. More Fool Me, studio demo, almost identical with album version
4. Happy The Man - Released as single b/w Seven Stones '72
   1 rough mix, 2 a somewhat "cleaner" mix, 3 studio demo - quality

13. In The Cage, studio demo

5 in fact is 'Field Of Eternity' by Ant as released on PP&P I but at a
different mix. 6 (studio take) is very nice. You hear Phil, Mike &
Steve chating around (if I got the voices right, only heard it once by
now).  Phil sings 'da da da da...' throughout the whole song. 7 is a
must-hear- it-again song, simply lovely.

13. 6:54 The Lamia - Demo
14. 4:13 Riding The Scree - Demo
15. 4:11 Silver Song, Demo w. Phil on vocals

The demos of 'The Cinema Show' and the Lamb stuff except for 'The
Waiting Room' are hard to distinguish from the official versions.
'Anyway' and 'The Lamia' probably are the same as on ITB Vol. 2. I
cannot tell, if 'The Supern. A.'  really has different vocals tracks.
'Silver Song' is the same as on ITB Vol. 1.  The only great tracks are
'I Know What I Like' which is the intro, but much longer, and 'The
Waiting Room', the demo is different and the 'Sound Effects' version
is really fun listening to.

Although 'Happy The Man' and 'Silver Song' are already on Vol. 1 and
2, the remaining tracks provide a fantastic view in the session work
of unfinished songs. On the various 'TBOEF' tracks they are rehearsing
various segments of the songs. Instead of a vocal track Peter Gabriel
often sings na-na-na to the music. On track 36 only a rhythm guitar is
played, even on the 'Take a little trip back...' section.  Track 4 and
5 are improvisational pieces which I have never heard in a song
before. 'Only Your Love' is a better version than the one on ITB
Vol.1.  Phil's vocals are much clearer.  And not to forget 'The Last
Time' and 'You Really Got Me'.  The tracks covering 'I Know What I
Like' are different from the tracks on ITB Vol. 3.

The covers and booklets of both CD are the same as for Vol. 1 and 2.

Sound:  Absolutely *no* hiss and great dynamics on non-Lamb Lives CD.
        When listening with earphones one can hear kind of a phasing
	noise, but that is sufficiently low. Whoever edited that CD
	must have taken an enormous effort to process the source
	tapes. 

Notes: 
	The first CD is an assorted compilation including the demo
	Going Out To 
	Tracks on the second and third CDs are exactly the same
	as on The Lamb Lives (qv below), except the second begins with
	Supper's Ready and More Fool Me from the Rainbow concert.
	Stagnation definitely is not the same as on 'The Shepherd'.
Packaging: comes with a very nice box which contains a 24 page booklet
	with beautiful color pictures of the band members and Peter's

Notes:  This is definitely one of the best early Genesis shows ever.
        It was recorded by the King Biscuit Flower Hour and has
        appeared in many different formats. In addition to these, it

        Dancing with the Moonlit Knight  (6:20)
        I Know What I Like               (4:45)
        Firth of Fifth                   (8:30)

        Supper's Ready                   (22:40)

        I compared Dancing ... and Firth of Fifth with the ones in the "Rainbow
        Theatre" bootleg, and they were exactly the same.  I don't have all of
        Rainbow Theatre, but as far as I know it doesn't have More Fool Me or
        the Worm Story which opens Supper's Ready.  This one does, and the
        tape of the broadcast has the story and More Fool Me but not the Cinema
        Show or the Battle.  The recording is OK -- perhaps a 7/10 if
        Revelatory Genesis is 10/10.

	just another bootleg and quite common...maybe at the time it

Note:   This and Swelled and Spent are the only two known complete

        [Well, that is until 1993 when soundbaord Lambs and rumors of
        soundboard Lambs started appearing.]

This set contains the complete Lamb as well as the encore.

The liner text is included in several languages. The English:

    "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" undoubtedtly is the album in which
    the two great musical achievements of the Genesis - Banks and
    Hackett's romantic spirit on the one hand and Gabriel's rock soul on
    the other - are best combined. Rutherford and Collins, following
    harmoniously in rhythm, made the masterpiece complete, offering
    uniquely original moments. 1975 was a turning point : the last stroke
    of genius in a story which had started five years earlier, at a time
    when rock meant, among other things, odd times, complex compositions
    and ususual technical skills. Likely enough, Peter Gabriel had become
    aware of the decay in the situation and tried to offer a remedy, to
    provide a bridgehead to join the past and the future, but it was too
    late and the band chose to stick to its solid homogeneity rather than
    playing with disquieting alternatives. Nobody knows what Genesis could
    have produced after the fatal year 1975. "Trick of the Tail", the 1976
    album and the first one to be produced without Gabriel, cannot but be
    considered as the logical sequel to "Selling England by the Pound"
    rather than to the previous record. This is a tangible sign of the
    extent to which Gabriel contributed to the album before he left the
    band, maybe out of fear that his personality might predominate over
    that of the others, or simply because he was afraid of getting old
    with then. Italy being the first country to offer a shelter to the 4/4
    finds its reward, especially if it is not considered as a deviation
    but as something to be proud of. Apart from the first successes
    obtained in provincial towns, the history of Genesis in Italy is very
    much linked with one city, Turin. Although the band members admit that
    their favorite town was always Reggio Emilia, they often played in
    Turin, and the 1976 Italian Tour consisted of one concert only, held
    at the Palasport in Parco Ruffini. The date was March 24, 1975, and it
    was the fifth time the band was back in Turin, in the middle of their
    European Tour. Nobody was aware of Gabriel's decision to leave after
    102 concerts around the world and nobody could imagine that was to be
    his very last concert with Genesis. In late March even a stern city
    like Turin takes on a lively atmosphere and Genesis had always been
    very successful in setting aside environmental factors : a dreamlike
    performace like "The Lamb" would cancel reality and focus the
    attention on the Paysage Inte'rieur of Rael.  All of this was very far
    removed from the first concerts in 1972 : feelings and emotions are
    realised in a place which is 10 times larger and in front of 10 times
    as many people, standing up and sitting down again, as if following a
    script. It is the beginning of the Middle Ages in the history of rock
    in Italy : news of accidents came from outside the concert hall,
    stories of stolen and burned cars, but nothing could outweigh the
    expectation of the audience waiting for the magic show to begin. The
    concert started on time as usual, and as often happened, Banks opened
    the dance with the psycho-musical plot the "The Lamb" : people stared
    at each other in amazement, unable to believe that they would play all
    the new album. When it had been published five months earlier, it had
    struck us all with its tremendous complexity, hardly renewable on
    stage. But after a few nervous, hesitant notes, millions of others
    followed and the entire work was enacted again. Of course, technical
    facilities had changed : many more watts were available, the stage was
    as wide as a barrack room, but humility, which is very close to
    genius, never changes. Gabriel's liquid look was only physically far
    and made itself very clearly felt through his voice, as if he were
    trying to gather us together and tell us about a dream, a timeless
    story. Two cherries on the cake are "The Musical Box" and "Watcher of
    the Skies" in a version which is very similar to that of the previous
    tours, the only difference being Gabriel's hair, which made the bat
    mask and the old man/child face visually very distinct. These are the
    last images they offered us. After that concert, five years had to
    elapse before Gabriel came back, and another 7 before the survivors of
    the band returned to Italy. Not much of a loss, at the golden age was
    about to end, and we are left with the privilege of having experienced
    it and of listening to it again on this CD.

Name:   The Lamb Lives
Date:   early 1975
Format: 2CD
Sound:  soundboard, stereo, some occasional fade outs, but nothing
        critical 

Note: Whereas this claims to be a soundboard, and is, the mixing is
TERRIBLE on it, and if you listen to this expecting a soundboard
bootleg on the order of the Rainbow Theatre, you'll be disappointed.
Tony's electric piano, the one he used before the Yamaha, is mixed all
the way up front, and the other instruments literally buried in the
background. Hackett's guitar is often inaudiable. This bootleg is only
good for listening to Tony's parts in the Lamb under scrutiny.

Contains the complete Lamb along with Gabriel's narration.

Cover:  
        It's got an excellent cover.  It's one continuous painting; one
        side shows a piano with a water fountain in it, with what looks
        like the Charterhouse school behind it with people playing
        croquet in front.  The girl from the cover of Nursery Cryme can
        be seen. The other side has a picture of an elderly man who is
        unzipping his face with a large built-in zipper. Inside his
        head, it's glowing bright, white light.  Mountains and
        volcanos can be seen behind him.

Name:   File Under (As in "File Under Genesis")
Format: 45 rpm
Date:   ~1980
Tracks: The Lamb Lies Down/Firth Of Fifth
Notes:  A bootleg 45, The cover says Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins,
        but Gabriel is not on it at all.  It's a circa 1980 performance,
        with only those two songs. (This is the only known 7" bootleg
        release of Genesis, but there were others in the File Under
        series such as Yes.)

Name:   File Under (As in "File Under Genesis")
Format: 12"
Date:   ~1980
Tracks: The Lamb Lies Down/Follow You Follow Me
Notes:  Similar to the File Under 7" above.

It comes in a manilla folder marked "File Under: Genesis" with a green
insert that says "MASTER LP" and "GENISIS SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD"
(spelling error is on the disc).  The insert lists two songs, "The
Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (featuring Peter Garbiel" (again spelling
error on the disc) and "Follow You - Follow Me (featuring Phil
Collins). Phil, however, sings on both tracks. The disc itself is a
12", 33 rpm picture disc.  The Lamb side has a picture of the band
with all five members, and the flip side has a picture of Peter
Gabriel in a really weird costume.  The disc is made out of what looks
like thick white plastic with green marbling.

I swear this next one was an entry in the discog for real -- I didn't
make it up!, one of the original ones:

1982 Abacab Tour  (90 minute tape)
        It's not a bad recording.

(The silly part is the editor actually has a copy of it and knows what
this entry means!!! It's an Abacab radio show, who knows from where.)

Tracks:

	Stagnation/Fountain of Salmacis/Harold the Barrel/I Know What I Like/
	Get 'Em Out by Friday/The Lamia

Genesis in Concert (2-LP)
        This one is a combination of sorts.  It has 2 BBC Archive studio tracks
        (Musical Box & Twilight Alehouse), a live Steve Hackett Group track (I
        Know What I Like), a couple of live Gabriel tracks (one of which is
        Milgram's 37), and a couple of live Genesis tracks (Man On A Corner
        and You're Own Special Way) from the Abacab tour.  It also has some
        Led Zeppelin rudely thrown in between a few of the tracks (called
        The Mask).  I think the bootleggers were just trying to fuck us over

        Comments: The CDs themselves are black with white lettering. A
        small booket is included with 2 pictures of a concert. The
        quality is good. It is not an "audience" recording. The tracks
        seem to be pieced together from different shows(the name does
        imply that it came from 3 different shows). Unfortunatly, the
        editing was poorly done, changes from one show to the next are
        obvious. The transition from Behind The Lines to In The Cage
        is ackward because they are seperated across discs. Applause
        is added at the end of Behind The Lines that doesn't sound
        like it belongs at all. The end of Turn It On Again includes a
        short medley of EVERYBODY NEEDS SOMEBODY TO LOVE and a few
        other non-genesis songs.

    Insert text:
    
    The double CompactDisc we offer you here is a truly complete live
    anthology of the first Genesis units, those of Peter Gabriel himself.
    The first three tunes, all previously unreleased, are from the Group's
    first period, immediately following the Decca release of "From Genesis
    To Revelation."  Besides their importance as collector's items, these
    tracks can also be appreciated for their beautiful freshness.  "Let Us
    Now Make Love" would have, in our opinion, been an excellent addition
    to "Trespass," the Band's first album release on Charisma, the newly
    created independent label.  We include here live versions of the three
    most beautiful tracks from this album: "Stagnation," "Looking For
    Someone," "The Knife."  The Group's real success and popularity
    arrive, "Nursery Cryme," represented here by the "The Musical Box"
    and, even though only released as a single by Charisma, "Twilight
    Alehouse."  With the tunes "Get 'Em Out By Friday" and "Watcher Of The
    Sky" we have arrived at the next period, that of the album "Foxtrot,"
    while "Firth Of Fifth" is from "Selling England By The Pound."  Except
    for the stupendous track "Watcher Of The Sky," the second CompactDisc
    is entirely dedicated to the work "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway,"
    which we consider as Gabriel's swan song with Genesis.  "Broadway's
    Genesi" is a very interesting long introductory jam session that was
    performed only in live concert, and has never before been released.
    
    [Editor's note: that's what they want us to think, anyway. All
     this stuff *has* been released on other bootlegs, and by most
     accounts the quality on those others is better than this one.]

                        INTERNET MAILING LISTS
                                Part A
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The original mailing list for Genesis on the internet was
the_lamb@caen.engin.umich.edu, run by John Macilwaine who had the
following unforgettable signature:

  ____________________________________________________________________________
  |                                 ___                          _            |
  |     /_ /_ |\ | /_ /_ | /_    \\  |  |_| /_   |    /_\  |\/| |_\  //       |
  |     \/ \  | \| \   / |  /        |  | | \    |__ /   \ |  | |_/           |
  |     Genesis/Gabriel Mailing List -> jmacilwa@caen.engin.umich.edu         |
  |         " I know that I am solid, and I am my own bad luck ... "          |
  |___________________________________________________________________________|

Originally mailed out in a digest format, the first issue of
the_lamb@caen.engin.umich.edu was mailed in June 1990, beginning a new
era in the history of Genesis' fans.  The first issue contained, among
other things, information about a new Peter Gabriel album (showing how
the world can be instantly informed of such developments) and an
interview with Genesis about Supper's Ready. The list at
the_lamb@caen.engin.umich.edu ended, however, in 1991, on the first of
July, after providing a forum of interesting discussion about Genesis.
During the last month, the list was plagued with annoying problems
like duplicated mail and error messages. John has returned to the new
list, and has worked at Real World Studios, Gabriel's studio.

For a brief period, it looked doubtful that the list would continue,
but the computer science department at the University of North
Carolina at Asheville allowed Scott McMahan to start a mailing on the
computer science department's computers. (Which at the time consisted
of a Sun and two MicroVAXen, which has now expanded to a lab of
DECstations as well as a powerful file server, ivy.cs.unca.edu, where
this list is based.) Now the Genesis mailing list resides at
genesis@cs.unca.edu for the near future. A direct corollary of the new
list genesis@cs.unca.edu is an archive collection of all the lyrics to
the Genesis albums, and a lot of solo lyrics. The FTP archives have
been augmented by a mail server, to allow greater access to them.
Extensive additions have also been made, including GIF format
puictures, interviews, and this discography you're reading.

The only solo member of Genesis to have an internet mailing list is
Peter Gabriel.  (All other discussion of solo projects takes place on
the Genesis list, including a little overlap about Gabriel.) It has
the following internet mailing address: GABRIEL@casbah.acns.nwu.edu.
It began circulation in November of 1990.

The Gabriel list is run by Joe Germuska, who has this signature:

|----Joe Germuska | germuska@casbah.acns.nwu.edu | ---- (708) 864-5939 ---|
|-Join the Peter Gabriel Mailing List:gabriel-request@casbah.acns.nwu.edu-|
|"Old men sing about their dreams, women laugh and |"How can we be in when|
|children scream, and the band keeps playin' on..."|there is no outside?"-|

Lyrics to Gabriel albums, the Genesis albums on which Gabriel
appeared, and miscellaneous other texts are available from
casbah.acns.nwu.edu by anonymous FTP.  (Note that this material has
also been put in the Genesis archives and is available by mail server
for those without FTP access.)

Both lists have co-existed autonomously since there are a great many
Peter Gabriel fans who don't necessarily have any interest in Genesis.

  [This material is not necessarily valid currently, but these
  have existed in the past. The addresses and information listed are
  the last known accounts of these organizations. This discography
  does not endorse or even vouch for any of these -- caveat emptor!
  These organizations are listed for completeness, even defunct ones.]

  NOTE: As of 1993, Genesis' position is that they recognize NO FAN
  ORGANIZATION AS BEING OFFICIAL. Fan organizations are only
  unofficial. Any organization claiming to be official is being
  intentionally misleading. Genesis has mandated this unofficial-only
  status because of past bad experiences with those given official
  status. 

  Genesis has asked the various record companies to remove the names
  of Brad Lentz and Geoff Parkyn from further pressings of the albums.
  DO NOT SEND ANYTHING TO GEOFF PARKYN OR BRAD LENTZ as they are not
  acting in any official capacity representing either the band or the
  fans any longer. The addresses provided below are for historical
  record only and are not intended to be used.

  Genesis albums since Invisible Touch, including Collins' But
  Seriously, have address to write to for more information. The
  addresses are listed in We Can't Dance as:

  Genesis Information former addresses.
  USA: Brad Lentz, PO Box 12250, Overland Park, Kansas 66282
  England: Geoff Parkin, PO Box 107, London, N6 5RU

  The Genesis Information Society, which does not exist
  any longer, was a fan club and had a newsletter. It was
  run by Geoff Parkyn, who also compiled a very complete
  discography in 1983. This discography has been used extensively
  in creating this one. Parkyn (or Parkin, it has been spelled both
  ways) was also at one point selling merchandising at greatly
  inflated prices. 

  The Waiting Room covers all things Genesis related, with news,
  comment and articles from all eras of the band's history.
  1 pound a single copy or 4 pounds for a year from Peter Morton,
  83 Oldfield Rd, Sheffield S6 6DU England. This is apparently run by
  Alan Hewitt (see The Pavillion Magazine below) as of 1993.

  'Ripples' is the Australian Genesis mag and also appears quarterly.
  No idea of subs rates on this, so write for more info (with IRC) to
  David Birtwell, 1 Mackinnon Ct, Keysborough, Vic 3173, Australia.

  There's also two Italian Gabriel mags for all you completists, both in
  Italian I'm afraid!  The first is called Contact.  Info from Monica
  Tessarin, Via Ragazzie del '99 N8, 3102 Mogliano V.To (TV), Italy. The
  second is called The Intruder and can be had from Thomasso Ridolfi, Via

   EDITORIAL NOTE: Also note that Goldmine, while having nothing in
   particular to do with Genesis per se, is a great source for 'last
   resort' buying. The dealers who advertise here charge a lot, often
   more than non-advertising ones. The odds of getting ripped off are
   high, especially with ads that looks like they were prepared by
   amateurs. Stick to computer-printed typeset ads for the best
   reliability. Caveat emptor can't be stressed enough. This information
   is provided for your own use, mainly to answer the frequently asked
   questions of "what is Goldmine" and "how do I get it". The information
   is up to date as of 1993, but is subject to change at any time.

   In terms of Genesis material, mostly every issue has some ads from
   dealers carrying Genesis records, bootlegs, videos, tour programs,
   and so forth. Record shows and local stores will probably give you
   better deals than Goldmine, but their selection is often severely
   limited. 

  What is Goldmine? It is a bi-weekly newsprint magazine which mostly
  consists of advertisments for sale or auction of "collectable"
  records, CDs and sometimes items like books, tour programs, and
  posters. There is some reading material, often good career
  retrospectives, discographies, interviews or collections of articles
  on one theme, but this usually consitutes maybe 10% of the pages. It
  is primarily a vehicle for advertisements. The newspaper itself can be
  found at larger newsstands, book stores that carry a large secection
  of magazines, used record stores, some new record stores, or of course
  as a subscription.

  popularity, the lack of books is pretty amazing.]

  GENESIS - THE ILLUSTRATED DISCOGRAPHY
  By Geoff Parkyn 
  Omnibus Press, London, 1983. 
  ISBN 0.7119.0163.5
  OP 42092

  Very nice discography, used quite a bit in filling out this
  discography. Lots of photos: not only rare albums and singles, but
  also some ads from different periods in the band's history. (These
  photos are in incredibly grainy black and white.)  This book covers
  up to Three Sides Live. 

  Very small, paperback size book. The cover is based on Abacab's
  album cover (the current Genesis release at the time).

  GENESIS - TURN IT ON AGAIN
  By Geoff Parkyn
 
  Reprinted version of THE ILLUSTRATED DISCOGRAPHY in 1984 as 'Turn It
  On Again'. This is updated to include the Mama album and solo
  projects at the time.

  GENESIS - I KNOW WHAT I LIKE
  by Armando Gallo

  Written in 1977. Published in England by Sidgwick and Jackson of
  London in 1978. Released only in England by Sidgwick and Jackson under
  the title "Genesis: The Evolution of a Rock Band", had three reprints
  at least. Not issued in the USA at all. Summer 1979, Gallo decided to
  publish it himself. Updated to right before Duke was recorded and
  re-issued in 1980, re-written, re-designed, and new pictures by the
  author. Published in the USA by DIY Books in 1980. Also a Limited
  Edition of 1000 copies hand bound in leather, boxed, numbered, and
  signed by the author. There was another printing circa 1986, but it
  was not updated.
  
  This is the definitive Genesis book. Gallo traveled and talked with
  the band for years. The band has testified to the veracity of the book.
  Introduction by Mike Rutherford. Curiously, the 1980 printing does
  not have an ISBN number listed anywhere.

  GENESIS - PETER GABRIEL, PHIL COLLINS AND BEYOND
   by Philip Kamin and Peter Goddard.  Introduction by Phil Collins
   (115 pages - 1984.  Beaufort Books.  ISBN 0-8253-0243-9)

  THE BOOK OF GENESIS
   by Hugh Fielder.
   (128 pages - 1984.  St. Martin's Press.  ISBN 0-312-08880-9)

   Fielder interviewed the band, and transcribed the interviews
   verbatim, with no editing. (Quite a feat, considering how little
   sense the band makes in interviews.) This is an accurate book,
   since it is the band in their own words. A good insight into
   personal feelings, and less hard facts than Gallo. Section of color
   photos, and a lot of black and white photos. Good source of non-Gallo
   photographs.

  GENESIS
   by Janis Schacht
   (124 pages - 1984. Proteus.  ISBN 0-86276-257-x)

   Schacht was involved vaguely with Genesis in the early days, seeing
   shows and reviewing them. He borrows a lot from his predecessors in
   terms of the book's content. A lot of good photographs. History of
   the band, sections for each member talking about solo projects, as
   well as a terse discography (sans catalogue numbers). He does cover
   up to the filming of Illegal Alien, and has some editorial
   opinions. Many too many of his items are 'borrowed' from other
   published sources which appeared before his book did. There's not
   much bibliographical credit given. An article that appeared in
   Circus Magazine, 1982 contains most of what he has written about
   the recording of Abacab. Whether he intentionally plagarized these
   articles or got permission but did not include it in the credits is
   unclear. 

  GENESIS - FROM ONE FAN TO ANOTHER
   by Armando Gallo.
   (144 pages - 1984.  Omnibus Press.  ISBN 0-7119-0515-0)

   Book of Gallo's photographs, less exposition than his other book.

  PETER GABRIEL

   (96 pages - 1986.  Omnibus Press.  ISBN 0-7119-0783-8)

   (232 pages - 1988. Sidgwick & Jackson.  ISBN 0-283-99498-3)

  GENESIS: A BIOGRAPHY
   by Dave Bowler and Brian Dray
    Published by Sidgwick & Jackson, London (I think)
    ISBN: 0-283-06132-4
   released in UK 11-92

 Contains discography , 8-10 black & white pictures in the middle.

 Front cover: Glossy black with same picture of band as used on Hold
              On My Heart singles inset in colour
 Back cover: Glossy black with colour band picture from about 1974/5 inset
 
 Inside cover says that Dave Bowler and Brian Dray played in major part
 in researching the 'Genesis: A History' video and have been Genesis
 fans/collectors for many years.
 
 The text looks very good, and basically goes through in chronological
 order detailing the history of the band and solo members careers to
 the present day. A full UK discography is included in the back
 including all albums, singles, videos and books released by Genesis
 and solo members, but no catalogue numbers are included.

 pedal 
Turn It On Again II
 live performance from Three Sides Live mixed with tour footage

 hodge-podge of all sort of clips from the Inv. Touch Tour; lots with

 band goes on stage groupies try to sneak into dressing room
No Son of Mine
 Shows boy returning to abusive home; Genesis playing instruments; at
 end it reveals scene takes place in snow orb

 jeans; satire of Michael Jackson' Dangerous rampage at end by Phil
 (often edited out when shown on TV)

 happens

Tony Banks

        [Note: it is hard to say certainly what videos Tony has done,

        on band history shows.]

        This is Love

Television Specials
-------------------

Genesis:

        Wembley March 12, 1992
         Pay per view broadcast of the Invisible Touch Tour video
         (qv), exactly as is except it omitted Volcano and Los Endos.
         This may be a repeat broadcast?

        No Access March 22, 1992
         Disney Channel special -- the first time ever that cameras
         capture Genesis writing an album. They show a little jamming,
         a little mixing, and Phil recording Never a Time. Bits about
         the members, and they answer questions.

        The Story So Far May 21, 1992
         ABC television special covering history of Genesis from "let
         there be light" to 1986. This is most likely a repeat.
         Original when?

        Opening Night June 13, 1992
         ABC television special giving a look at the preparations for
         the We Can't Dance tour: song selection, jumbo-trons, etc up
         until the opening night. (very little complete-song
         performance footage) 

        Knebworth 1992 ?? ??, 1992
         UK pay-per-view only, no USA broadcast. Bootleg CD of this
         show appeared 5 minutes before it ended. Last stadium date of
         the We Can't Dance tour. Entire show.

Phil:
        Television Special ?? ??, 1990
         People advise Phil on what to do a TV show on, he wants to do
         live performances. Very little music, very insipid,
         disappointing.
        Pay-Per-View Oct 2, 1990
         Live, entire concert, last date oSerious Tour
         Later released in Serious Hits Live (qv) boxed set.

Commercial/Bootleg videos
-------------------------

  NOTE: there is a video of a Belgian TV appearance which many sources
  claim is from 1971, but (intentionally or not) they lie. There is no
  way it could have been from 1971. The first non-England tour dates
  Genesis ever played were in Belgium 1972. The video is from 1972.

[Genesis has released mostly all of their outtakes and b-sides, and
what hasn't been officially released has oftentimes been illegally
released or played on radio programs and then bootlegged. Still, in
spite of this, some tracks have never been on any record or anything.
Some released tracks have been included to establish context. Rumor
says Tony has all the old tapes, demos (for example Gallo claims to
have heard them!)... The editor has chosen to include a few items
which have appeared on radio programs and have been bootlegged in
order to fill in a few gaps, mainly because these items were not
intended for release and the fact that they've been recorded and not
been lost forever is a miracle.]

The first demo tape for King, Easter 1967 Chiswick, London, consisted
of: 

  She's Beautiful
    self-described best of the songs on this tape, first Tony/Peter
    collaboration, later given different lyrics and used
    as The Serpent on FGTR
  Try A Little Sadness
  That's Me (Ant/Mike)
  Listen On Five
  Don't Wash Your Back
  Patricia
    Instrumental, given lyrics as In Hiding on FGTR

The second demo tape for King in summer 1967 had:
  When the Sour Turns to Sweet
  The Image Blown Out
  She's Beautiful (new version)
  Try A Little Sadness (new version)

A third demo tape of 8 or more songs was made in 1968, none ever
recorded, with more complexity -- playing, mood changes...(I
personally suspect Let Us Make Love and the Shepherd were part of
this, because they seem to fit here well.)  Including tracks called:
   Barnaby's Adventure
   Fourteen Years Too Long

A fourth demo tape in 1968 (no info on how many songs)
   Everywhere Is Here

(first and second singles released)

After FGTR
 King really lost interest in Genesis at this point. Tony at a
 university wrote part of Supper (Eternal Sanct.) and 2 other songs
 without words that eventually showed up on Trick. 

 The Movement
   45 minutes, bits used for Get Em Out By Friday, Stagnation

Demos for Trespass
   Dusk -- then called Family
   White Mountain
   Going Out To Get You
   Pacidy

Music for a BBC documentary soundtrack
   Part of Looking for Someone
   acoustic Musical Box
   Anyway (Eventually used in the Lamb)
   Peace

Live in 1973 was originally planned as a double album, with a full
version of Supper's Ready on the second LP. The double album was
scrapped in favor of a really cheap single LP for department stores in
order to broaden Genesis' potential listeners. There were some test
pressings of the double album, though, which are true collector's
items. (Armando Gallo really glosses over this album, and barely
mentions it!) (See also the main discography entry on Live)

The Shout (Banks, Rutherford)-- Tony and Mike collaborated for the
soundtrack of this film in 1979, but it was never released. Rumor says
that Tony's 'From the Undertow' on A Curious Feeling has the main
theme from this soundtrack. (No one who has seen the movie has ever
commented on the veracity of this, if in fact anyone has ever seen the
movie.)

Silver Song -- an Anthony Phillips track on which Phil and Mike
appeared. Phil sang. The plan was for a release in 7", which finally
was cancelled and never released, but was once played on some kind of
radio program, and bootlegged. More recently Ant wanted to put this
song onto one of his albums that was going to be re-released on CD.
Phil didn't give his permission to use the vocals, so Ant re-recorded
it and sang it himself. (Note that some people maintain that Silver
Song was Phil's first solo release -- this is not true, it was an
Anthony Phillips song.)

Phil Demos: Both Please Don't Ask and Tomorrow Never Knows have had
their demo versions played on radio shows, and then bootlegged. These
demos were not released.

Rat Race (Phil Collins) -- this is a song used on one episode of Miami
Vice, the song is the music from (the non-album) The Man With the
Horn, and different lyrics. It was never released on a Miami Vice
soundtrack or in any other form.

The Border (Tony Banks) -- in a Keyboard magazine interview, Tony said
that The Border originally was much longer (12 minutes) and had a
serene middle section which was mostly instrumental. He claims the
middle could stand on its own, but has never said if he used it in
another song or not. The full-length version was never released.

There is a wild rumor -- and that's all -- of a Brand X studio album
from after Do They Hurt which was never released. 

Also, three songs were written but not recorded for We Can't Dance.
Demos must exist somewhere in Genesis' studio.

Some bands have been so inspired by Genesis they've named themselves
after Genesis songs. This leads to no end of confusion and puzzlement.
Not to mention the original USA Genesis which came before our Genesis,
who also released an album. (Most of these are INCREDIBLY hard to find
in the first place.) Some information about these bands is presented
for completeness, to clue in the Genesis fan about their existance and
what their music was like. The testimonials are from a Progressive
Rock Survey and have been edited to be as subjective as possible.

Genesis
-------
The "other" Genesis in the USA that caused a name conflict with our
Genesis when From Genesis To Revelation was going to be released in
the USA also released an album. (Watch out for this in the Genesis
bins at record stores/shows, especially being passed off as a real
Genesis album.)

'Genesis - In the Beginning'
Mercury Stereo SR 61175, 1968

there is a song called 'Mary, Mary', which is different from the one
on the Happy The Man bootleg (qv). [The editor, never having heard
either, can't confirm nor deny that.]

Happy the Man 
-------------
   HTM produced some stirring, complex, melodic, and MUSICAL works,
although they are rather rare, they are certainly very accessible.
The band claims to be influenced by Genesis, Yes, and Gentle Giant
although they really do not sound anything like any of those bands.
The compositions tend to be rather complex and challenging, but they
cleverly avoid falling into that dissonant trap that so many bands
fall in to when they try to write something complex (e.g., the
mid-sect- ion of Yes's 'Ritual'). HTM maintains a melodic approach to
everything they write.

[The editor has heard only one HTM song and can't comment on the band.
But everything the editor has heard about HTM has been good.]

Throughout their existance as a functioning band (from 1974-1978) they
recorded three marvelous lp's.  The following musicians appear on each
one of these:

1. Frank Wyatt - piano, el. piano, organ, flute, sax 
2. Stanley Whitaker - guitars     
3. Rick Kennell - bass
4. Kit Watkins - synths, piano, el. piano, organ, flute   

Each album had a different drummer. The discography below shows the
albums and who played drums on them:

1. Happy The Man (1977) - drums: Mike Beck 
     produced by Ken Scott, of David Bowie and Supertramp fame.  
     This album defines the band's sound very well, one that endured
     throughout their career. 
2. Crafty Hands (1978) - drums: Ron Riddle 
3. Happy The Man 3rd: Better Late.... - drums: Coco Roussel

a. Retrospective (a CD compilation of most of first and second lp, with
   some stuff from 3rd)
b. Beginnings (features material recorded live in 2-track studio in
   1974-75. Features a singer called Cliff Fortney who left the band
   before being signed to Arista)

For Absent Friends
------------------
???

Foxtrot
-------
This band hails from Norway, and has only one release entitled " A
Shadow of the Past". Despite their name, they remind one much more of
later Camel (ala Stationary Traveler) than old Genesis. Their music is
very melodic and pleasing to the ear, with excellent vocals and
instrumentation.

Trespass
--------
???

Over The Garden Wall
--------------------

        ...is *the* Genesis cover band. They play Genesis
        material from all phases of the band's career, with perhaps a
        little more emphasis on the older material. They stay for the
        most part in the northeast USA and Canada, and are based in
        Montreal. They are outstanding musicians and do a great job
        with the material. The singer sounds like both Collins and
        Gabriel without really sounding like either. Genesis
        officially knows what they do and approves of it. They do not
        have any albums or recording available, since Genesis doesn't
        really want them selling albums of them doing Genesis
        material. (This isn't to say, however, that they haven't been
        bootlegged.) Original material is in the works...
