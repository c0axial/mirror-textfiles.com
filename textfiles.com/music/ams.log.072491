AFL JoyceM Okay...we can get started...and I have a few
                    comments first... I would like to welcome Jim Maricondo of
                    DYA....better known to us as DYA Jim.  If you haven't
                    checked out our libraries recently, we have some very fine
                    (excellent) files that DYA has uploaded to our library
                    on instrument files for SoundSmith. And we hope in the near
                    future to have DYA as a link with AMS.  Jim, would you like
                    to make some comments about DYA and their involvement in the
                    music field...then we can get to the questions and comments.
                    Thanks.... Jim:

DYA Jim1   Yo Everyone! :) Currently, we have only one music
                  product actually released, and that is the DYA Instrument
                  Disk Volume 1 which is now in the library.  We are working
                  on a couple other music projects for the future.  We're not
                  sure on details just yet, but there probably will be another
                  instrument disk (now that I've gotten some sound cards for
                  my synthesizer .. finally! :) and I will be finishing Hot
                  Licks, our soundsmith player utility, sometime soon.

AFC Eddie  Sounds great, Jim!!

DYA Jim1   That is basically it for now, but we might change
                  that or do more stuff in the future :)

AFL JoyceM Jim, want to explain a little more on what the SS
                    player utility will do?

Mr Toaster Yes, please Jim.

DYA Jim1   The main extra features we are planning for it
                  (i.e. NEW features we haven't seen implemented anywhere else
                   .. yet) are several jukebox modes -shuffle, like a CD
                   player, and modes where you can specifiy a combination of
                   files and folders to play in random or in sequence - and
                   some really neat "VU" effects.

Mr Toaster CoooooOOOOOOOOOoooooool!!!

AFL JoyceM VU effects?

DYA Jim1   We're experimenting with several new kinds of new
                  VU graphical displays.  (yah, you know, like how SoundSmith
                  does it in graphic play mode).  But we will be implementing
                  several other variations, some of which we've come up with
                  ourselves.

Mr Toaster (How can you have different kinds of VU
                    meters??!?  I'm curious!!)

AFun Ian   Like maybe analog ones?

DYA Jim1   (Wait and see! :)  It'll be a good surprise. :)
                  All digital, currently, except for the LED
                  track/block/position display.

AFL JoyceM Have you all ever thought of making a SS editor
                    to make inputing songs easier?

Mr Toaster Oooo, can't wait!!

AFL Marty  I wondered the same thing Toaster... until I saw
                   for myself :)

Mr Toaster Good point.

AFA Gene   Oooo analog ones! VERY cool idea, Ian! :)

DYA Jim1   We'll have to consider analog now though :) It
                  hadn't come up yet

Mr Toaster Like the little needle ones?

DYA Jim1   Let's see.. so far a SS editor isn't in our
                  lineup..Because of other commitments.

AFun Ian   Joyce, SS/Zap is coming along... Poor Jim doesn't
                  need to do an editor! :)

AFL JoyceM Jim, will this be PD, shareware or ?

AFA Gene   Especially if you could get the needle-lines to
                  be "jaggy-less":)

DYA Jim1   Most likely shareware, but nothing is definite
                  yet :) 

AFL JoyceM Great, Ian....was hoping you would speak up )

DYA Jim1   Good Ian :)

AFL JoyceM Jim, Ian do you all feel that the GS music
                    software is going to get better and more user friendly?

DYA Jim1   Hmm.. that's kinda difficult..

DYA Jim1   Unfortunately, synthLab/MidiSYNTH is on hold
                  indefinitely, and there are tons of rumors that SoundSmith
                  will never be completed..

Mr Toaster It seems like it's on the edge of becoming
                    awesome... except for AppleCo.  :(

DYA Jim1   However, I think instrument editing and song
                  editing will get better.

AFL Marty  I've heard those same rumors.  Hope they're
                   wrong.

AFun Ian   Well, I'm working on the easier to use side AND
                  the better side. You'll see.

DYA Jim1   (You should see all the bugs in the MIDIsynth
                  toolset!) (there are TONS)

AFun Ian   I don't like MIDIsynth.  I think SoundSmith'll
                  kill it! Esp. with my editor! :)

AFL Marty  Bugs?  In Apple software?  You're kidding! :)

DYA Jim1   I'd like MIDIsynth IF it was a final bugless
                  version.

AFC Eddie  Soundsmith won't kill it unless it has MIDI
                  implemented.

AFL JoyceM Agree, Eddie

Mr Toaster True.

AFC Eddie  THEN it will kill it.

AFun Ian   Eddie, THAT's what I mean! :)

AFC Eddie  Oh!

AFL JoyceM Now that we have some excellent music programmers
                    on AOL, why don't you all get together and write the perfect
                    music software :)

Mr Toaster Anyone know Huibert's number?  What's long
                    distance to France cost, anyway?  :)

AFC Eddie  Do you know something we don't Ian?

AFL Marty  I suspect that there is a way to input MIDI with
                   SS...Huibert can't be entering all those songs via the
                   "spreadsheet".  I bet he has a private utility to do that.

DYA Jim1   <-- hates spreadsheets.  entered one songsmith
                  song and then stopped :)

AFun Ian   Well, even if Huibert doesn't do MIDI, I am.  :)

AFC Eddie  If you check our new files library tonite, you'll
                  find that SLab can sound just as good as soundsmith.  With
                  MIDI.

AFL Marty  When, Ian?

DYA Jim1   But you can't fix the bugs in SLab :(

Mr Toaster (Eddie, I thought that was sLab! :)

DYA Jim1   You could disassemble Midisynth and go bug
                  hunting, but then you couldn't distribute your new version
                  (yes, I know someone who did this :)

AFL JoyceM Eddie, want to elaborate on your songs more?

AFC Eddie  True, Jim!

AFA Gene   Actually.... the really BEST soundsmith songs
                  will probably always be mostly spreadsheet even after MIDI
                  "is" implemented (if it ever happens)... Cuz SS will always
                  quantize the MIDI input; i.e. it will not be like the way SL
                  does it.

AFL Marty  (Guess I scared Ian away :)

AFC Eddie  I just UL'd two SLab songs using exclusively
                  SoundSmith instruments.

Mr Toaster AppleCo's lawyer brigade comes in.... yeah.

AFA Gene   <just wanted to make that comment :)  >

AFC Eddie  You're right, Gene.

DYA Jim1   (darn beatle record company)

AFC Eddie  The Beatles are right!

AFA Gene   Aren't they still selling the Apple MIDI
                  Interface? Sam Ash still carries 'em.

Mr Toaster What Beatles?  They broke up already!

DYA Jim1   I can't figure it out either, Gene.

AFC Eddie  Anyway, if you really want to come as close as
                  you can to MIDI implementation with the sound of Soundsmith,
                  you can do it with SynthCreate and AudioZap.

DYA Jim1   The only thing that Apple stopped in the way of
                  music, was synthlab. They still are updating their MIDI
                  manager tools for the GS and Mac, they still sell the MIDI
                  interface, but they're not doing slab/msynth anymore.

AFL JoyceM Jim, how difficult would it be to write a utility
                    for SS to allow MIDI input?

Mr Toaster Who seriously believes that Apple Records is
                    going to sue AppleInc?  Huh?

DYA Jim1   It's not a light undertaking..

AFC Eddie  I do.

Mr Toaster C'mon, they'd never win the case...it'd cost 'em
                    too much money and it wouldn't be worth it in the end.

DYA Jim1   It entails a lot of doing..I wonder how Ian is
                  gonna implement it..

AFL JoyceM A MIDI input utility would probably take SL out
                    of the music market.  BTW, Mark Cecys still gets on
                    AOL....leave him notes about upgrading the Tool35.

DYA Jim1   I heard at KFest that Mark Cecys quit the A2
                  division.

AFA Gene   IMO the hardest part would be to decide how to
                  split all the MIDI keypresses into SS tracks... like someone
                  can hit 8 keys at once really easily.

AFL JoyceM I had heard that too about Mark...but he has been
                    working on the Mac side soon after SL was released.

DYA Jim1   Yeah, I believe Mark switched to Mac :(

AFA Gene   I'm not surprised, yet it's funny cuz mark was
                  originally from Ensoniq.

DYA Jim1   Yeah, I thought the same thing..  he dumped the
                  Ensoniq.   What people do to go work on the Mac side :(.
                  The original main author of HCGS transferred over to the Mac
                  side and then got laid off.

AFA Gene   Who knows, maybe we'll see an EPS 16+ in the next
                  Mac. :)

AFL JoyceM What is so sad about this...is that Apple doesn't
                    care or take pride in what they release when it is buggy!

AFC Eddie  That would be unbelievable, Gene!

DYA Jim1   Jim Mensch transferred over to the Mac side right
                  in the middle of writing the Animation Toolkit.  So wonder
                  there's anyone left

AFA Gene   Ed, there already exists such a card... the name
                  slips me at the moment, but that's basically what it is.

AFC Eddie  For the Mac?

AFA Gene   Yep. So who knows, Apple might just make it
                  built-in. ?

AFC Eddie  Hmmmm, how about software support for it?

AFA Gene   (Apple doesn't put out the card, btw. The people
                  in MMS seem to love it.)

Mr Toaster Hee hee hee... some friends of mine and I built a
                    digitizer for an IBM. We got everything soldered together,
                    all the parts in the right places...Tested it out... It's a
                    hunk o' junk.

AFL JoyceM Eddie, what to discuss how you did the SS
                    instruments into SL?

AFL JoyceM The IBM or your board, Toaster?

Mr Toaster I think the Radio Shack guy gave us the wrong
                    chips.

AFC Eddie  Sure...

Mr Toaster Both!  :)  Naah, the board. (I know, excuses,
                    excuses...)

AFC Eddie  We took some instruments from a couple of SS
                  songs we really liked....Then loaded 'em into Audiozap for
                  tweaking and size control, which is really essential for
                  SynthCreate.  Then, used Synthcreate to make a couple of new
                  wave files.  We tried out a bunch of MIDI sequences
                  converted with  Midimate...and Voila!

AFL Marty  I'd like to know what Jim means when he says the
                   instruments are "tuned" to the FUN instruments.


DYA Jim1   They're not tuned to the FUN instruments, they're
                  tuned to each other and to the keyboards they were sampled
                  from.

AFL Marty  My mistake.  What does that mean though?

DYA Jim1   So, a G#4 played by SoundSmith should sound the
                  same (excluding the degradation of quality) as a G#4 in the
                  same instrument on the synthesizer it was digitized off of.

Mr Toaster Hmmm, good idea.

AFL Marty  Okay... that makes it clear.  Thanks.

AFA Gene   Yep, Jim, I had to do the same thing when I
                  digitized my own custom SS insts. (compensating for tuning i
                  mean)

DYA Jim1   Yeah, that was a pain :)

AFL Marty  How hard was it to accomplish (the tuning)?

DYA Jim1   You'll really have to ask Matt..  BUT, he did a
                  LOT of work in experimenting using a lot of trial and error
                  I believe in finding the proper settings to digitize and
                  playback at.  It wasn't easy.  The tuning problem is what
                  pushed back the release of the disk about 4-6 months.

Mr Toaster Sounds like a real pain to me.

AFA Gene   I did it by ear, so I guess it's just a pain in
                  the butt. To me it was like tuning a piano.

AFL Marty  I figured it wasn't easy.

DYA Jim1   Matt has a great ear for this kinda stuff though
                  :)  He's done a bunch of soundSmith songs off of songs on
                  tapes of his, with no sheet music and such :)

AFC Eddie  Jim, I'd like to get together with you for some
                  hints, as I'd like to create some insts with the sounds from
                  my Proteus.

DYA Jim1   Ahh, a Proteus. (I just got a "Proteus/XR
                  Impressions" soundcard for my D70 :)

AFL Marty  I know that disk represents a lot of work.
                   Hopefully folks will appreciate that (and maybe send money
                   :)

DYA Jim1   Perhaps you, I, and Matt could meet together
                  sometime and talk about it. I hope so Marty :)

AFC Eddie  Soon you may hear SLab songs with the DYA insts!

AFL Marty  You know, when you release something like an
                   instrument disk there's always the danger that folks will
                   think you did it in an afternoon.

DYA Jim1   good point.

AFL Marty  Now that it's in the transcript they'll know
                   better. :)

DYA Jim1   Maybe we should add something like "Four months
                  in the making" or however long it took (I forget :)

AFL Marty  I really do appreciate all the work it took.  (My
                   favorite sound, by the way, is Milk Bubbles :) That's the
                   perfect name for that sound.

AFA Gene   Yeah, reminds me of when ultima 5 came out...
                  "six man-years in the making" :)

AFL Marty  Has anyone created any tunes with the new
                   instrument disk?

DYA Jim1   The DYA Sampler song in the library demonstrates
                  some of the sounds from a very beta (not tuned very well)
                  version of the disk. But that's about all I know of so far.

AFL Marty  Maybe a contest would generate interest (just
                   thinking out loud)

AFC Eddie  Good idea!

AFL Marty  I'll work on some details and EMail them to you.

AFC SteveB (I have a music question for after the chat :)

AFL Marty  No Steve... I will NOT sing "Feelings".

AFC Eddie  Shoot, Steve!

AFC SteveB Ok! Are there any freeware/shareware Music Studio
                    players? Or any util. that will let you listen to MS songs?

AFC Eddie  I think there is one, Steve.

AFC Eddie  Not sure if it's in our library or not, but I can
                  check... So, you're all gonna check out my new Soundsmith
                  SLab tunes, right?

AFL Marty  Coitenly

Mr Toaster I just saw the Amiga MOD converter in your
                    library. One o' my roomies has an Amiga w/ lots o' mods.
                    I'll get some when he comes back to Houston in the fall

AFC Eddie  Steve, I know I have one somewhere.  I'll look
                  for it for you!

AFC SteveB Thanks Eddie! :)

AFL JoyceM Great news for me...just got accepted to sell my
                    paintings in a top gallery here in Denver :)

AFL Marty  Congratulations!

AFC Eddie  Fantastic, Joyce!!!!!!!!

AFL JoyceM And they will appear in a 1992 Calendar :)...am
                    so excited :)

AFC SteveB ()()()() Joyce!

AFC Eddie  WOW, now you can trade in that D-5 for a Korg T1!

AFL JoyceM Don't I wish...got to learn the D-5 first :)

DYA Jim1   LOL :)  T1's rule :)

AFA Gene   Congrats Joyce! :)

DYA Jim1   too bad they're so damn expensive :)

DYA Jim1   Congrats

AFL JoyceM Thanks guys....

AFL Marty  How expensive?

Mr Toaster WOW Joyce!!! What great news!!!!

DYA Jim1   the lowest model - T3 - I've seen for about $2700
                  for the keyboard

AFC Eddie  List $5669 Marty.

AFL Marty  ::faint::

DYA Jim1   (ahh, thanks Eddie :)

AFL JoyceM Good grief....picking self off the floor!!

DYA Jim1   it sounds great though :)

AFL Marty  It better!

AFL JoyceM You can buy a car for that...almost!

AFC Eddie  But, that's just list.

Mr Toaster Everything but the power door locks! LOL!

AFA Gene   Marty keeps having major medical problems at AMS
                  chats. :)

AFL JoyceM Fainting seems to be one of those medical
                    problems.

AFC Eddie  It's still rather humid here in CT where Marty
                  and I live. So, fainting can happen!

DYA Jim1   <-- lives in ct

AFL Marty  Speaking of which...

AFC Eddie  Really, Jim?

AFL Marty  We have to get together sometime soon Eddie.

AFC Eddie  yes!

DYA Jim1   Yep :)

AFC Eddie  With Jim, too!  Where,Jim?

AFL Marty  Jim's in Trumbull.

AFC Eddie  Just there today!

AFL JoyceM I must be the only AOL member who lives out west!
                    or so it seems.

AFA Gene   Jim's from the northeast? I always pictured Jim
                  as being a California dude :)

AFL Marty  But you... I could open my window and yell out to
                   you, Ed. :)

Mr Toaster Is Houston West?

AFC Eddie  Joyce, you add balance.

DYA Jim1   LOL Gene :)

AFL JoyceM Jim...want to thank you and DYA for coming
                    tonight...most enlightening and we look forward to Hot
                    Licks... 

AFC Eddie  And thanks for the great instrument disk!!!

AFL JoyceM Oh, and that too...great!

DYA Jim1   Thanks for the invitation Joyce :) Thanks
                  everyone! :)

AFL Marty  Hot Licks is awesome!

AFL JoyceM Thank you!
