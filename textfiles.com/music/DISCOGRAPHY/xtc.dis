				XTC Discography

		       (Version 1.44, 30 December 1992)

This discography compiled, edited, and formatted by John M. Relph
(relph@presto.ig.com).  Much information has come from the Wonderland XTC
discography compiled by Shigemasa Fujimoto.  Loads of help was received from
many fellow fans, including all those who contributed to the other XTC
Discography (from Washington).  Thanks!

Any and all additional information pertaining to releases which appear or
should appear in this discography is appreciated.

The original of this discography uses bold-face, italics, and underlines, so
the level of detail is a little lower in this clear-text version.  Most
editorial remarks and details are in lower case.  ``unseen'' denotes items
which have not been verified.  A question mark (``?'') is used to denote
specific unknown information.

All singles and EPs have a picture sleeve (``p/s'') unless otherwise noted.
All CDs come in a standard ``jewel-box'' unless otherwise noted.  An ``obi'' is
the paper strip that comes wrapped around almost all Japanese albums.

A bootleg consists of unreleased material recorded at concerts, studio
outtakes, and radio or television broadcasts.  A pirate album consists of
released material without attempting to make the album look like an original.
A counterfeit album is an exact copy of an officially released album.
