  (*) Extra:  

  In the 1980's, when Soft Cell first arrived on the scene, they were
  grouped in with others as one of the New Romantic bands of Britain.
  The group was the strange duo of Marc Almond and Dave Ball and they
  soon broke from the pack with their wildly erotic dance classics.

  Non Stop Erotic Cabaret is everything the title says and more. It
  is a twisted journey that  Almond takes us  on  through  London's 
  red light district.  The video to  accompany Sex Dwarf has yet to
  be seen by the public because it is so explicit.

  The Band's second album, The Art Of Falling Apart saw top 30 hits
  with songs like Torch, What? and Where The Heart Is.  Included in
  this album  was a bonus 12" of  Martin and a Jimi Hendrix medley.
  
  This Last  Night  In  Sodom  was the  last  offering of the duo's  
  demented views.  It was released at the time of their fairwell con-
  certs in London.  In America, Murder My Angel, received  some air 
  play.

  During the Soft  Cell  period  Almond offered his talents to such  
  industrial groups as COIL, PSCHIC TV and FEATUS.   After the Soft  
  Cell break, Almond went solo  while  Ball  hooked up with CABARET
  VOLTAIRE.

  Most recently Almond  and  Ball  were back  together  on Tenement 
  Symphony.  The album is a must for all Soft Cell fans. Songs like
  Jacky offer a  fevorish dance beat  that pounds  Almond  into the 
  1990's with the ranks of Electronic and Pet Shop Boys.


  (*) Hope you found some use for all this.  Keep Dancing.
