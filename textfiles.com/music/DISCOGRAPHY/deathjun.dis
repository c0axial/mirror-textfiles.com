Okay, here's the Death In June discography as it currently stands.
Obviously I'd like to fill in some of the gaping holes so any info
people can provide would be appreciated.  Next time I have a chance
to get to a record store I'll try and see if I can get any info out
of them but I think I already have most, if not all, of the in-print
stuff.  People who don't care about a DIJ discog should hit 'n' now.

		THE DEATH IN JUNE DISCOGRAPHY

			put together by Stewart Tame
			(stame@emunix.emich.edu)

			Version 1.2

		(Last revised May 21, 1993)

Background:  Death In June is Douglas P.  Or so say the liner notes for
		the CD of _The Corn Years_.  The music is remniscent of
		groups like Coil or Dead Can Dance.  Moody, gothic,
		somewhat repetitive.  I like it a lot.  BTW, the 'P.'
		apparently stands for Pearce.

ALBUMS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Brown Book					1987
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: LP

	I've never seen this album.  I only know of its existence because
	songs from it appear on _The Corn Years_ and _The Cathedral of
	Tears_.  I'll list them here although I'm not sure of their
	actual order on the album.  Nor am I sure that this is all of
	them.

Track listing:

	Burn Again
	Touch Defiles
	Red Dog-Black Dog
	Brown Book

	The Fog of the World

----------------------------------------------------------------
Burial						1982?	
----------------------------------------------------------------

Format: LP
	
	Same as above.  All I know about this LP is that one track
	from it appears on _The Guilty Have No Past_.  In the liner
	notes for TGHNP is says, "For the purpose of these recordings
	DEATH IN JUNE was Tony Wakeford, Patrick Leagas and Douglas
	P."  The one track I know of for this LP is:

	Most of the songs from this one originally appeared on _The World
	That Summer_ or _Brown Book_.  However, the title track is
	credited in the liner notes as "recorded 'live' at Bar Maldoror,
	London 29th May, 1991."  Personnel for that track at least were
	Douglas P., David Tibet and James Mannox.  Lyrics to most of
	the songs appear in the liner notes.  David Tibet is also a member
	of Current 93.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: Compact Disk
New European Recordings   BAD VC CD 7

	These tracks originally appeared on _The World That Summer_,
	_Brown Book_ and _Nada!_.  Studio personnel (besides Douglas
	P.) were David Tibet, Rose McDowall, Andrea James, Gary
	Carey, Bee, John Balance, Jan O', David Tiffen and J.R.P.
	This CD is "Dedicated to the memory of Michael Smith who

	liner notes.  David Tibet is also in Current 93 and John

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Guilty Have No Past					1984?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: Compact Disk
New European Recordings   BAD VC CD 3

	Some of the tracks on this disk originally appeared on the
	LPs _The Guilty Have No Pride_ and _Burial_.  Release date
	for this CD is unknown but "all tracks were recorded between
	1981-83."  For the purpose of this recording DIJ was Tony
	Wakeford, Patrick Leagas and Douglas P.

Track listing:

(*'s denote songs that are new with this disk.)

	State Laughter				*
	Heaven Street (Mk II)
	All Alone in Her Nirvana
	Nation
	In the Night Time			*
	We Drive East				*
	Holy Water				*
	Heaven Street				*
	The Guilty Have No Pride
	Till the Living Flesh Is Burned
	Nothing Changes
	Black Radio

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Guilty Have No Pride			1983?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Format: LP

	Nothing is known about this album except for the track listing
	and the lineup (Douglas P., Tony Wakeford and Patrick Leagas.)
	The tracks that I know of were re-released on _The Guilty Have
	No Past_.  I don't know if any more tracks were on the album
	or not.

Track listing:

	Heaven Street (Mk II)
	All Alone In Her Nirvana
	Nation
	The Guilty Have No Pride
	Till the Living Flesh Is Burned
	Nothing Changes

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson 1: Misanthropy
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: LP

	This allegedly exists.  Nothing is known about it other than
	the title.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nada!							1985?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: LP and Compact Disk
CD: New European Recordings  BAD VC CD 13

	All songs were written and recorded 1984-85.  For this album
	DIJ were Douglas P., Patrick Leagas and Richard Butler.  Someone
	called "Tibet 93" is listed as a "special collaborator."  I think
	this is David Tibet of Current 93.  The CD version of this album
	(the only one I've seen) includes 4 bonus tracks.  Lyrics to all 
	songs are included in the liner notes, though the lyrics to "Crush
	My Love" appear under the heading "Crush My Soul."  A remix of
	"Behind the Rose (Fields of Rape)" appears on _The Corn Years_.
	
Track listing:

(*'s denote CD bonus tracks.)

	The Torture Garden (DIJ/Tibet 93)		*
	Last Farewell					*
	The Calling					*
	Doubt to Nothing				*
	The Honour of Silence
	The Calling (Mk II)
	Leper Lord (DIJ/Tibet 93)
	Rain of Despair
	Foretold
	Behind the Rose (Fields of Rape) (DIJ/Tibet 93)
	She Said Destroy (DIJ/Tibet 93)
	Carousel
	C'est Un Reve
	Crush My Love
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Night and Fog
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: LP

	Again, all I know about this one is the fact that it allegedly
	exists.  That and the fact that it's supposed to be "an official
	bootleg."

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh How We Laughed					1983?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: LP and Compact Disk
LP: EYAS Media  EYAS 011
CD: EYAS Media  EYAS 1013

	I think this may be a bootleg.  The songs were all recorded live
	although the crowd noises have been carefully cut off at the ends
	of the songs.  All of the songs appear (in studio versions) on
	_The Guilty Have No Past_.  I don't have a CD player handy at the
	moment so I can't match up bootleg titles with the real ones.
	I'll try to have this corrected on future versions of this
	discography.

Track listing:

	Knives
	Nirvana ("All Alone In Her Nirvana" from TGHNP)
	Heaven Street
	Nothing Changes
	Nation
	Holy Water
	State Laughter
	In the Nightime [sic]
	We Drive East
	How We Laughed

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Something Is Coming					1993?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: Compact Disk (double)

	This allegedly exists.  I've not seen it though.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wall of Sacrifice						1989
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: LP and Compact Disk
CD: New European Recordings  BAD VC CD 88

	The LP was a limited edition.  All songs on the album appear on
	the CD.  For this album personnel were: Douglas P., David Tibet,
	Rose McDowall, Boyd Rice, Nikolas Schreck, Andrea James and Jan
	O'.  Lyrics to all songs appear in the liner notes.  Boyd Rice
	has also released recordings, both as himself and as Non.  And
	of course David Tibet is in Current 93.

Track listing:

	The Wall of Sacrifice
	Giddy Giddy Carousel
	Heilige Leben
	Fall Apart (with David Tibet)
	Bring in the Night (with Boyd Rice)
	In Sacrilege
	Hullo Angel (with David Tibet)
	Death Is a Drummer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The World That Summer						1986
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: Double LP

	All I know about this one is that songs from it appear on
	_Cathedral of Tears_ and _The Corn Years_.  The track listing
	--as a result--may be incomplete.  Remixes of "Love Murder",
	"Break the Black Ice" and "Rule Again" appear on TCY.

Track listing:

	Death of a Man
	Rule Again (Instrumental)
	Hidden Among the Leaves
	Blood Victory (Instrumental)
	Blood Victory (DIJ/ David Tibet)
	Torture By Roses
	Love Murder
	Break the Black Ice (DIJ/ David Tibet)
	Rocking Horse Night (DIJ/ David Tibet)
	Break the Black Ice (Instrumental)
	Rule Again (DIJ/David Tibet)
	Blood of Winter
	Come Before Christ and Murder Love

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SINGLES:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
. . . And Murder Love
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: 7" single

	This allegedly exists.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	This allegedly exists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This allegedly exists.  It's supposed to be one half DIJ and
	one half Current 93.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Paradise Rising						1992
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: Compact Disk
New European Recordings   BAD VC CD 63

	Remixes from _But, What Ends When the Symbols Shatter?_.  That
	assumes, of course, that merely recording the same song with
	the lyrics translated into a foreign language counts as a remix.
	Personnel were Douglas P., David Tibet, James Mannox and Simon
	Norris.  David Tibet is a member of Current 93.


Track listing:

	This Is Not Paradise
	Ceci N'est Pas Paradis
	O Paradis . . . 
	Daedalus Brise
	Daedalus Falling
	Daedalus Est Tombe Du Nouvel Age

	This allegedly exists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPILATIONS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sacred War						1990
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Format: Compact Disk
Gymnastic Records  GYM 205

	The tracks included on this disk by DIJ are remixes of "Giddy Giddy
	Carousel" and "Fall Apart."  The original versions of both songs
	appear on _The Wall of Sacrifice_.  Other bands on the disk include
	Non, Sol Invictus, Yeht Mae and Anton Lavey.  Interesting trivia:
	as well as the two DIJ tracks, Douglas P. is also given an
	instrumental credit on the Non track ("Total War").
