Negativland -- "Negativland" -- The first LP by this Bay area band, made
        and released while they were seniors in high school.  Some of it
        is difficult/bad, but there's some really charming stuff in here.
        White supremists taped off of the radio, children reciting the
        Lord's Prayer, an old record about how to teach your parakeet to
        talk, pre-recorded civil defense radio messages about what to do
        after the bomb has dropped, dinner conversation from the family
        home of a band member, electronics and various odd music
        all mixed into a fascinating collage.  Like I said, it's a bit
        sloppy and difficult at times, but there are some amazing moments
        on this LP.
Negativland -- "A Big 10-8 Place" -- Easily their best lp, IMHO,
	but not the best place to start unless you're into noise and
	experimental stuff.  First, a surreal excursion into suburban
	America, very spooky and subliminal; a lot of effort went into
	every moment of this LP, sounds to disturb and affect you.
	Then comes a real song, then a completely strange suburban
	travelogue, where tourguide David Wills tells "all you slimy
	fruitcakes from San Francisco" how to get to 180 and the letter
	G, so that you can clean the dog juice from the orange carpet
	and the green slime that's oozing from the front of the house.
Negativland -- "Escape From Noise" -- Perhaps their most listenable
	LP, it consists of lots and lots of short bits strung together.
	Noise is the common theme, street noise, noise at home, "noise --
	what it is -- what it does to you".  Sometimes humorous, usually
	wry and cynical.  Radio, and music as a commodity, is another theme.
	If you're interested by any of these album descriptions, this
	one is the one to start with.  Not much of the longer more
	abstract pieces that make up a lot of the other albums.
Negativland -- "Helter Stupid" -- Their most recent LP.  Not quite as
	interesting as the above, except for the subject material; half
	of the album is about a rather unethical media experiment they
	conducted.  Still, has some great moments.
Negativland -- "Pastor Dick","The Weatherman","Jamcon '84" -- Cassettes
	of Negativland during their live radio show Over The Edge.  The
	show is in the middle of the night on a Berkeley radio station,
	and people can call in live, they just get edited into the
	electronics, music, etc that the band are doing.  For the true
	fanatic only.
Negativland -- "Secret Single" and "Guns" -- The band's last two efforts
	have been 12" singles, the former being one of the most infamous
	music lawsuits in recent memory.  The band and SST were sued by
	Island Records and Warner-Chappell Publishing after the "U2"
	single, officially called "Secret Single", had been on shelves 
	for only a week, charging that the single's packaging was
	intentionally misleading and gave the impression that it was a
	U2 release.  In fact, many record stores misfiled the single 
	under "U".  Its two tracks are deconstructions of "I Still Haven't
	Found What I'm Looking For" intersperced with David Will's
	smarmy improvisation on the song's lyrics and samples of Casey
	Kasem verbally abusing his show's staff.  "Guns" is a bit more
	pedestrian, providing commentary on guns and the people who use
	them.
