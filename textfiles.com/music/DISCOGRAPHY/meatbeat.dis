SUCK HARD       December 1987

        EP      Sweatbox SOX 023 (UK)   [limited edition of 1500 copies]
                I Got The Fear          (4.59)
                Kick That Man           (5.29)
                Kneel and Buzz          (4.34)

                Fear Version            (1.08)
                [Recorded for CD single 1/88, not released]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I GOT THE FEAR  Winter 1988

 Remix 12"      Sweatbox SOX 023R (UK)
                I Got The Fear (Titanium Mix)   (5.52)
                I Got The Fear (Without Jack)   (6.00)

        Engraved in the run-out grooves:
        A Side - "Jack Your Body Son Fire"
        B Side - "Suck A Little Bit Harder"

This single replaced SOX 023 (the  SUCK  HARD  EP)  in  order  to
showcase the new Meat Beat sound.  The Titanium Mix is closest to
I Got The Fear Part 1 on Storm The Studio.  At  this  point  they
were  still hyping the Armed Audio Warfare LP, because across the
top of the single's cover, it reads "A Preview Into  The  Ecstasy
Of Armed Audio Warfare."

BARK            Spring 1988?

        LP      Sweatbox SAX 025 (UK)

Compilation  album  of  Sweatbox   artists.    Features   "Mister
President"  and  "Kneel  And  Buzz" by Meat Beat Manifesto.  Also
contains "Beehead" by Perennial Divide, a band that Jack  Dangers
was in before he started MBM.

>From the booklet:

A three headed beast with strongly defined ambition.  Gregg  (re-
animator) Retch, the sound system, a deck, a desk, and an ear for
the impure. Pirahna Jones,  visuals,  a  choreographer,  a  video
director and a sight for the sound. Jack Dangers, the singer.

Their debut "Suck Hard" was a misunderstood Chrimbo  release  and
was  deleted  in  the  new  year  in  favour  of  "I Got The Fear
(Titanium Mix)."  An album "Armed Audio Warfare"  was  scheduled,
but destroyed in a fire before it reached the cut.

But the future is clear,  "STRAP  DOWN,"  a  twelve  inch  single
released  in  May,  a few alternative formats, a two pronged live
assault and a double take video set.  The ambition is simple: the
balls  in the mix, not necessarily in the band. The thrill in the
live show, not in the guitar solo. And any hype from an attitude,
not from a bank.

The listing on the back of the album  has  "Kick  That  Man"  and
"Kneel And Buzz" switched.  The above listing is correct.

Originally, the first Meat Beat album  was  to  be  called  Armed
Audio  Warfare,  but  the masters were mostly ruined in a fire at
their SoHo flat (the arsonists accidentally torched their  studio
rather  than  the  intended victims downstairs).  They reused the
title for this release, but it consists  of  compilation  tracks,
b-sides  and  other  rarities.   "Genocide" is the music for what
became "Psyche-Out" (LP mix) with lyrics from  "God  OD."   "Give
Your  Body Its Freedom" is the same as the versions on the _Strap
Down_ singles minus the opening 35 seconds.  "Marrs Needs  Women"
is  somewhat  different from "Mars Needs Women."  The back of the
album contains a good account  of  what  was  released  when  and
where.

Videos:

I know of two videos currently available: "Strap Down" and "I Got
The  Fear."   The  "Strap  Down"  video  uses  the version on the
original 12".  The "Fear" video has a unique  mix  of  the  song,
halfway  between  the original Suck Hard version and the Titanium
Mix.  Both videos are available for NTSC consumers on a Wax  Trax
video compilation (Volume 2).

Other information:

Jack and Marcus used to be in  a  band  called  Perennial  Divide
before  starting  Meat  Beat  Manifesto.   Here's  an ultra brief
discography of their output, all material  released  on  Sweatbox
Records:
        12" Bee Head    [produced by Andy Partridge of XTC]
        12" Leather Necks
        12" Burn Down
        LP  Purge

Jack Dangers did the "Selectors" and  "Dirty  Dubbing"  mixes  of
_Hyperreal_  for  The  Shamen.   He  also  mixed the Consolidated
"Friendly Fa$cism" album and "Brutal Equation" single.

That's it for now, kids.  This is what it's all about...
