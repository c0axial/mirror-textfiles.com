                                BRIEF HISTORY & INFO

Bel Canto is Nils Johansen and Anneli Marian Drecker. They was formed in 
Tromsoe, Norway in 1986 with third member Geir Jenssen. After half a year of 
composing and recording demos in Nils' bedroom, they went on Interrail with 
demo tapes in their baggage. After being turned down by 4AD and other labels, 
they finally got a deal with Crammed Disques, and moved to Brussels. 

After Birds Of Passage, Geir left to concentrate on his house project Bleep, 
later Biosphere. Anneli and Nils now live in Oslo, and Geir has moved back to 
Tromsoe. Precussionist Andreas Eriksen is recruited as a third associated 
member, helping out on live shows. In 1992 they where choosen as official 
musicians for the 1994 Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer. They might make
music and jingles for the olympics, but nothing is decided yet. They will play 
around the world in 93 on one-off shows as part of the 'official olympic 
artist' deal. 

Geir is currently working on music for a short film based on a short story by 
Knut Hamsun. He is playing one-off shows on various festivals, and will soon 
have a tour in Norway. He has recorded tracks enough for a new album, and is 
currently picking tracks and polishing them...

Anneli has also had a small acting carreer in Norway. She played the lead in 
'Sosken pa Guds jord' (Siblings on God's land) in 85 (?), had a small part 
in a film in 87 - 88, and had a leading role in Svarte Pantere (Black 
Panthers) in 92.

The first two albums (and associated singles) was released under the name Bel 
Kanto in Norway of legal reasons.  A norwegian choire already had the name Bel 
Canto.

Bel Canto means 'beautiful song' in Italian...
