       As the name implies this was Buffalo Springfield's 2nd album.
       Neil, Steven, Richie, Dewey, and Bruce more or less comprised
       The Buffalo Springfield.  Noteable musicians include Jack
       Nitzsche and Steven Stills.  Jack plays on several other Neil
       Young albums and also produces a few.  Steven Stills is the
       same Stills in Crosby, Stills, and Nash (and sometimes Young).

Notes: (*) by Neil Young
       (**) by Neil Young and Richie Furay
       This was The Buffalo Springfield's last released album.
       Another album was worked on (Stampede), but was never released.
       Jim Messina is the same Messina in the early-70s group
       "Loggins and Messina".  They had a few hits like "Crying Eyes"
       and the song that goes something like "You're mama don't dance
       and your daddy don't rock and roll".  The Loggins in "Loggins
       and Messina" is Kenny Loggins of Footloose fame.

       Jerry Garcia is one of the band members of The Grateful Dead,
       and John Sebastian is formerly of The Lovin' Spoonful.  This
       album is one of the few albums in history that has acheived a
       legendary status.  Many of these songs are used in various
       audio and video productions to represent the late 60s era.

After The Gold Rush (July 1970, Reprise 2283)

Tell Me Why
After The Goldrush
Only Love Can Break Your Heart
Southern Man
Till The Morning Comes
Oh, Lonesome Me
Don't Let It Bring You Down
Birds
When You Dance I Can Really Love
I Believe In You
Cripple Creek Ferry

Produced by Neil Young & David Briggs with Kendall Pacios

Musicians:
     Bass: Billy Talbot, Greg Reeves
     Piano: Neil Young, Jack Nitzsche, Nils Lofgren
     Drums: Ralph Molina
     Guitars: Neil Young, Danny Whitten
     Vocals: Neil Young, Danny Whitten, Nils Lofgren, 
             Steven Stills, Ralph Molina
     Harmonica: Neil Young
     Vibes: Neil Young

Notes: Most of these songs were inspired by a screenplay for the movie
       "After The Goldrush", which was never actually filmed.  The
       screenplay was co-written by Dean Stockwell, who designed the
       cover for _American_Stars_&_Bars_, and stars in the American TV
       show "Quantum Leap."  The group Lynyrd Skynyrd did not take
       kindly to Neil's song, "Southern Man", which depicts The South
       (in the USA) as a racist land.  In fact, they wrote the song
       "Sweet Home, Alabama" in reply to Neil and actually mention his
       name!  Neil counter-replied with "Alabama" (on _Harvest_).
       Despite all this, Neil probably did not intend to start a music
       feud.  He actually wrote a few songs for Lynyrd Skynyrd
       probably as an act of diplomacy, but they would not take them
       (see notes for _Rust_Never_Sleeps_).  "Oh, Lonesome Me" is a
       Don Gibson cover.

           Graham Nash:         Vocals, Guitar

           Johnny Barbata:      Drums
           Calvin Samuels:      Bass

Notes: (*) by Neil Young.  
       This is a CSNY Live Album recorded at the Fillmore East, New
       York, June 2-7, 1970; Chicago Auditorium, Chicago Ill., July 5,
       1970; and The Forum, LA, June 26-28, 1970.  Parts of it suck
       really bad.  In fact, it is so bad, C, S, and Y did not want
       this album released on CD, but, alas, it was finally released
       in the Summer of 1992.  The CD has 4 bonus tracks that are not
       listed here.  A few of the songs are performed sololy by their
       writers, and are fairly good.  If you find this album in a
       cheap used bin, I would at least buy it for Neil's acoustic
       version of "Cowgirl In The Sand" and "Don't Let It Bring You
       Down", and also to hear his between-song comments.

       Both "Alabama" and "Words" are extended versions.  They include
       studio conversations made during the recording of these songs.
       "Find The Cost of Freedom" and "Ohio" were recorded during a
       CSNY concert.  There is a rumor (straight from Neil Young himself)
       that this movie, as well as Neil's other movies, will be
       released sometime this year.  However, this movie has not
       been seen in any stores in the USA yet (9/13/92).

Notes: (*) previously unreleased tracks
       This is an incredible collection of Neil Young's work.  It
       includes several songs that were previously unreleased.  "Down
       to the Wire" and "Burned" are on the unreleased Buffalo
       Springfield album _Stampede_.  Dr. John (Mac Rebenak) plays on
       "Down to the Wire".  This is a must-have for any Neil Young
       fan, not only for the song selection, but also for Neil's
       hand-written notes.

       pressed with this name and are very valuable nowadays.

Musicians: 
     Nils Lofgren, Ben Keith, Bruce Palmer, Ralph Molina, 
     Joe Lala, Frank Sampedro, Billy Talbot
     (no instruments specified)

Notes: Contrary to most people's opinion, Neil Young thinks that this
       is the other of his best two albums.  Every song on this album,
       except "Like An Inca" and "Little Thing Called Love", has Neil & 
       Nils singing through a Vocoder, which makes the voice sound like 
       a "computer voice."
       Nils Lofgren is the guitarist in Bruce Springsteen's E-Street
       Band.  Sonic Youth did a great cover of "Computer Age" on the
       album _The_Bridge_.

     Tim Drummond: upright bass
     Karl Himmel: snare
     Larry Byrom: piano, backing vocals
     Anthony Crawford: backing vocals
     Rick Palombi: backing vocals

Notes: Only (*) are written or co-written by Young - others are covers
       of rhythm'n'blues classics or semi-classics.  The story is that
       Neil's record company accused him of deliberatly making a
       non-commercial album (_Trans_) and forced him to make another
       one quickly (this one).  However, this story has not been confirmed.
       The song "Wonderin'" was actually written in the late 60s, and
       has a neat video for it.  This is the other of Young's best
       albums according to him...

           Carl Gorodetzky:     Violin
           Spooner Oldham:      Piano
           Larry Byrom:         Background Vocals
           Rick Palombi:        Background Vocals
           Doana Cooper:        Background Vocals
           Denise Draper:       Vocals

Notes: This was Neil Young's country album.  Some of his other stuff
       could be call near-country, but this is pure country.  In fact
       Neil Young performed on the "Austin City Limits" TV show in
       support of this album, which was one of his few TV appearances.
       There are several familiar names in the musician's list: Waylon
       Jennings, Willie Nelson, Bela Fleck, Ben Keith, and Tim
       Drummond.  The first three are known country / bluegrass
       musicians, and the last two appear on several other Neil Young
       albums.

       TV news anchorman (connection?)

       This is CSNY's 4th album.  It is nowhere as good as Deja vu,
       but does have a few good songs on it.  Neil Young's song are
       pretty good, especially "American Dream", which talks about a
       TV news anchorman caught in a sex scandal.  (see Notes: for

           Chad Cromwell:                Drums

Notes: This is a 25 min. EP.  Neil did not want to release this album,
       but some of the CDs had already been made, so Reprise still
       sold them.  They were only released in Australia and Japan.
       "Don't Cry", "On Broadway", and "Eldorado" are the same tracks
       that appear on the _Freedom_ album.  The other two songs are
       good, and are worth getting if you ever find this disc.

       of 6-7 verses. The version on this album is just a 
       shortened version.

Notes: This is total noise!  (That's a description, not a value
