Depeche Mode Discography Part Three - Appendices

Version 2.00
Last revision date: March 4, 1993

Appendix One - Times
--------------------

This discography is intended as a compliment to the main discography (or the
"first" discography), because I had a lot of requests for the times of songs
to be included and because I didn't want to have to go through the nightmare
of rearranging the entire 1200+ lines of the discography to include all the
times.

These times are either taken from the packaging or labels of various releases,
or from CD players, or as a last resort by timing the song. Give or take a few
seconds with each time as they can never be entirely accurate. If you think
you find a mistake, please let me know, but don't send me mail telling me
that I am only a few seconds out on one song. In other words I am only
interested in major mistakes (more than a few seconds).

When one song has been released under more than one name, the time is listed
for the name under which it was first released (either in the UK or USA), and
all the different names follow underneath, without any time listed.
