	Machinery Operator.

	Promotional videos were made for the Minutemen songs "This Ain't No
	Picnic" and "King of the Hill".

	Mike Watt appears in the video for Sonic Youth's "My Friend Goo"
	but doesn't play in the song.  He also does a cameo in the video
	for "100%" by Sonic Youth.

	Mike Watt also stars as Fidel Castro in a movie I don't know the
	name of and haven't seen.

	Please send me any additional information you have about these or
	other releases featuring Minutemen and fIREHOSE.
