BLACK SABBATH DISCOGRAPHY  v.3.4    5-OCT-1992 
----------------------------------------------
by Sami Nurmela, University of Turku, Finland
Send any additional information to SNURMELA@KONTU.UTU.FI or

Info on singles is especially needed, as the singles-part of the
discography is currently quite sketchy.

An asterisk "*" indicates the source of songlist (the US and UK releases
of some albums have different songlists).
On those albums where the band members are not listed, you can safely 
assume that the band is the same as on previous album.
Singles are listed at the end of the discography.

A big thank you to those who have helped me to compile this list:
  Steve Boswell, Per Henrik Lofgren, Maurice Maes, Daniel Rench,
  Thomas Rodgers, Peter Gutmann, Per Andersson, Jason Rupe, Ralf Wirth
