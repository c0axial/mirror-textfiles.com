:BOOTLEG ALBUMS:

NOTE: This is not a complete list by any stretch of the imagination.
	It would be almost impossible to compile a *complete* list.


1970 The Shepherd 
1972	Very early performances, including pre-trespass, non-album
	tracks.  1970 tracks mono, rest stereo, very good sound.
	Noticable hiss, slightly forward EQ, but overall very clean, 
	uncompressed dynamics, better sounding than the official 
	release, _Genesis Live_.

 	The Shepherd/ Pacidy/ Let Us Make Love/ Stagnation/ Looking
	For Someone/ Twilight Alehouse/ Watcher of the Skies/ Get
	'Em Out By Friday/ The Musical Box

1972 The Musical Fox (Wild Bird Records WBR CD 9016)
	Basel, Switzerland, January 1972

	Happy the Man                   (3:28)
	Stagnation                      (9:00)
	The Fountain of Salmacis        (8:47)
	Twilight Alehouse               (8:12)
	The Musical Box                 (10:46) 
	The Return of the Giant Hogweed (7:55)

	Mediocre recording with occasional dropouts on the source
	tape, and even some 50 Hz hum (recorded in Europe, y'know :-).
	It has interesting, lengthy intros into all of the songs in a
	weird French/English mixture by Peter.  6/10 overall. A live
	Happy the Man and the introductions are the most interesting 
	things about this CD.

1973 In Concert 1973	(2-LP)           [ VG+   90min ]
	I think it's from NY, but I can check.  I heard from another 
	net person that this album is the same as the Live Supper cd.
	It has Selling England By The Pound live tracks on it plus Supper.

1973 Rainbow Theatre ( ? tape )   October 2, 1973
     Live Supper     ( CD )
	Very good sound, King Biscuit Radio program.  The tape is a
	60 minute program, without the Cinema Show.

	Watcher of the Skies/ Dancing with the Moonlit Knight/ I
	Know What I Like/ Firth of Fifth/ More Fool Me ( Phil sings )/
	Supper's Ready ( with story )/ The Cinema Show

	Live Supper the CD:
	(Chapter One CD 25111) Rainbow Theatre, London, Oct. 20, 1973
	Dancing with the Moonlit Knight  (6:20)

	The Cinema Show                  (11:30)

	I compared Dancing ... and Firth of Fifth with the ones in the "Rainbow
	Theatre" bootleg, and they were exactly the same.  I don't have all of
	Rainbow Theatre, but as far as I know it doesn't have More Fool Me or 
	the Worm Story which opens Supper's Ready.  This one does, and the 
	tape of the broadcast has the story and More Fool Me but not the Cinema
	Show or the Battle.  The recording is OK -- perhaps a 7/10 if
	Revelatory Genesis is 10/10.

1973 A Death In Anytown (LP)                [ VG+  120min ]
	Horizons live and More Fool Me on this one.  Noisy crowd and hardly any
	bottom end.

1974 L'Ange Gabriel (LP)
	21 April, 1974, 55 min., excellent stereo, recorded at Montreal
	University -- good mono, maybe very good at most, listener says,
	My copy is on colored vinyl.  Comes from a radio broadcast.
	This is live from Montreal, 1974.  It may have been re-issued 
	on cd by now.  Anyone know fer sure? 
 
	Sound OK, strong roaring hiss, compression, FM artifacts,
	sharp warp (bumping noise) in my LP. Magical performances however.
	Stories in French.

1974 Live At Wembley	(CD)       
1975	This is from 1975 I think, or 1974. Very nice performance.

	Genesis Live At Wembley Arena - June 23, 1974  (CD)
	Great 'Lamb' tracks here.  The tracks printed on the cd and the 
	booklet don't jibe with what's *really* on it.  Here's the real   
	track listing:  1) In The Cage  2) Back In NYC  3) Hairless Heart/ 
	Counting Out Time  4) Carpet Crawl  5) Evil Jam  6) Silent Sorrow/

	Angeles

	These tracks are the same as found on the As Though Emerald City 
	album.  The same guy yells 'Alright!!' at the beginning of Musical
	box.  One extra track on LP:  Happy The Man.  The sound quality
	of this cd is superb.

1975 Swelled and Spent (2-LP)     [ Good 120min ]
	The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway Live  ( complete ).
	2 May, 1975, 105 min., good stereo 
	Recorded at Birmingham Hippodrome, Birmingham, England.  
	Is only 105 min
	
	Good stereo: strong hiss, compression, bootleg vinyl quality, very 
	piercing sound with related distortion (side two has additional vinyl
	distortion on my copy due to this also). In spite of these irritations,
	however, proper EQ produces a realistic sense of being in the audience.
	Couple long stories.

	This is the complete Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.

1975 Brittish Tour (LP)        
	Noisy recording (scratchy).  Lamb tracks.

1975 Trick Of The Tail Outtakes  (LP) 
	Very, very, very hissssy.  Mostly instrumental versions of the Trick
	Of The Tail album, plus one unreleased track called Beloved Summer.
	Squonk is called "Indians" on this album and is without vocals.
	Trident Studios, 1975
	"Beloved Summer" is identical to "It's Yourself".

?	With Bruford on drums. Contains both Twilight Alehouse and Happy
	The Man. Detroit 1976.

	It's got an excellent cover.  It's one continuous painting; one 
	side shows a piano with a water fountain in it, with what looks 
	like the Charterhouse school behind it with people playing
	croquet in front.  The girl from the cover of Nursery Cryme can 
	be seen. The other side has a picture of an elderly man who is 
	unzipping his face with a large built-in zipper.  
	Inside his head, it's glowing bright, white light.  Mountains 
	and volcanos can be seen behind him.

1982 Abacab Tour		(90 minute tape)   
	It's not a bad recording.  

C    Genesis in Concert	(2-LP)     
	This one is a combination of sorts.  It has 2 BBC Archive studio tracks
	(Musical Box & Twilight Alehouse), a live Steve Hackett Group track (I
	Know What I Like), a couple of live Gabriel tracks (one of which is 
	Milgram's 37), and a couple of live Genesis tracks (Man On A Corner 
	and You're Own Special Way) from the Abacab tour.  It also has some 
	Led Zeppelin rudely thrown in between a few of the tracks (called 
	The Mask).  I think the bootleggers were just trying to fuck us over 
	on that one.  It's still worthwhile though.

"Peter Gabriel - an authorized biography" by Spencer Bright.
reprinted discography without permission or acknowlegement

This definitive discography includes all Peter Gabriel's recordings. I have
not catalogued cassette and compact disc releases where they do not differ
from the original albums. The release of the first albums on compact disc in
May 1987 completed the CD catalogue of all Peter Gabriel's albums.
  The recordings are all UK releases with the exception of the two German
version albums recorded by Gabriel with German Iyrics.
  I am indebted to Sinclair Salisbury for his work on this discography.

BOOTLEGS:

	A little rough sounding recording.  Best tracks are Seascape,
	Inst. No. 1, Inst. No. 2, and the title track Games Without 
	Words.  Seascape is an early version of Walk Through The Fire.

	State Of Mind  (2-LP) 
	From the 1986 tour.  Has Red Rain, Mercy Street, Sludgehammer,
	Biko, and a bunch more.  I like it better than the official
	release 'Plays Live'.  San Vacinto is cut-off at the end. 

	Waiting For The Big One  (LP)  
	Live from 1977.  This album is also called Ain't That Peculiar, 
	but contains the same tracks.  I like All Day And All Of The

INTERGALACTIC TOURING BAND - 1977 - Passport (PB9823)
     Anthony Phillips plays acoustic guitars on "Reaching Out"


:BRAND X:
	Brand X was a title assigned by the recording engineer 
	of a bunch of session players who got togethers to make
	some music (jazz/fusion) while Genesis was between tours 
	initially. The group was initially a project idea started
	by Phil Collins and Bill Bruford though Bruford never played 
	with the group per se. 
	
	Key members: 
		a) John Goodsall: guitarist   
		b) Percy Jones : electric fretless bass 
		c) Robin Lumley : keyboards
		d) Phil Collins : Drums only (some singing later on) 
		e) Morris Pert : Percussion 
		f) John Giblin : bass (later albums)  
		g) Kenwood Dennard : drums on 'Livestock' Live Album   
		h) Mark Clarke : drums (1/2 of 'Product' and 'Do They Hurt') 
		i) various other drummers 
		j) Peter Robinson : keyboards 

	Albums: 
		1) Unorthodox behaviour : 76   
		2) Morrocan Roll : 78?
		4) Masques : 79 
		5) Product : 80?
		6) Do They Hurt? : 81 
		7) Is There Anything About? : 82
		8) Xtracts : 84? 

	Phil played a lot of early gigs, but was not that seriously
	dedicated to the group due to Genesis and soon to be solo career 
	Live formats were very jazzy, high energy, improvisational 
	somewhat in the vein of Mahavishnu, Al Dimeola, except rocked
	a bit more and had a sadistic tone to a lot of the music.

:PUBLICATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS:

INTERNET MAILING LISTS:
	The original mailing list for Genesis on the internet was
	the_lamb@caen.engin.umich.edu, run by John Macilwaine
	who had the following unforgettable signature:
____________________________________________________________________________
|                                 ___                          _            | 
|     /_ /_ |\ | /_ /_ | /_    \\  |  |_| /_   |    /_\  |\/| |_\  //       |
|     \/ \  | \| \   / |  /        |  | | \    |__ /   \ |  | |_/           |
|     Genesis/Gabriel Mailing List -> jmacilwa@caen.engin.umich.edu         |
|         " I know that I am solid, and I am my own bad luck ... "          |
|___________________________________________________________________________|

	Originally mailed out in a digest format, the first issue of
	the_lamb@caen.engin.umich.edu was mailed in June 1990, beginning
	a new era in the history of Genesis' fans.  The first issue 
	contained, among other things, information about a new Peter
	Gabriel album (showing how the world can be instantly informed
	of such developments) and an interview with Genesis about 
	Supper's Ready.

	The list at the_lamb@caen.engin.umich.edu ended, however,
	in 1991, on the first of July, after providing a forum of interesting
	discussion about Genesis.  During the last month, the list 
	was plagued with annoying problems like duplicated mail and 
	error messages.

	For a brief period, it looked doubtful that the list would
	continue, but the computer science department at the 
	University of North Carolina at Asheville allowed Scott 
	McMahan to start a mailing list in the .cs.unca.edu domain.
	Now the Genesis mailing list resides at genesis@cs.unca.edu
	for the near future.

	A direct corollary of the genesis@cs.unca.edu is a database
	collection of all the lyrics to the Genesis albums, and 
	a lot of solo lyrics.  They are available via anonymous
	FTP at fletcher.cs.unca.edu as long as the genesis list
	lasts, and maybe longer.

	The only solo member of Genesis to have an internet
	mailing list is Peter Gabriel.  ( All other discussion
	of solo projects takes place on the Genesis list, including
	a little about Gabriel. ) It has the following internet
	mailing address: GABRIEL@casbah.acns.nwu.edu. It began 
	circulation in November of 1990.

	The Gabriel list is run by Joe Germuska, who has this 
	signature:

|----Joe Germuska | germuska@casbah.acns.nwu.edu | ---- (708) 864-5939 ---|
|-Join the Peter Gabriel Mailing List:gabriel-request@casbah.acns.nwu.edu-|
|"Old men sing about their dreams, women laugh and |"How can we be in when|
|children scream, and the band keeps playin' on..."|there is no outside?"-|

	Lyrics to Gabriel albums, the Genesis albums on which 
	Gabriel appeared, and miscellaneous other texts are 
	available from casbah.acns.nwu.edu by anonymous FTP.
	
PUBLICATIONS (Fanzines and newsletters around the world):
	
	The Genesis Information Society, which does not exist 
	any longer, was a fan club and had a newsletter. It was
	run by Geoff Parkyn, who also compiled a very complete
	discography in 1983.

	The Waiting Room covers all things Genesis related, with news, 
	comment and articles from all eras of the band's history. 
	1 pound a single copy or 4 pounds for a year from Peter Morton,
	83 Oldfield Rd, Sheffield S6 6DU England.

	'Ripples' is the Australian Genesis mag and also appears quarterly.
	No idea of subs rates on this, so write for more info (with IRC) to
	David Birtwell, 1 Mackinnon Ct, Keysborough, Vic 3173, Australia.

	There's also two Italian Gabriel mags for all you completists, both in
	Italian I'm afraid!  The first is called Contact.  Info from Monica 
	Tessarin, Via Ragazzie del '99 N8, 3102 Mogliano V.To (TV), Italy. The
	second is called The Intruder and can be had from Thomasso Ridolfi, Via
	Bordolano 6A, 20097 S.Donato Milanese, Italy.

:STUFF:

RANDOM THINGS:

The solo album by Daryl Stuermer titled "Steppin' Out"; the album is a 
great collection of guitar pieces - no lyrics. Included is a cover of one 
of Phil's tunes even [co-written by Stuermer] (I Don't Wanna Know)

here's an entry not many would know about.  Peter Gabriel plays the flute
in Cat Stevens' Katmandu (recorded in 1970 or 1971!).  Peter also appears
in Laurie Anderson's Mister Heartbreak and Joni Mitchell's Chalk Mark in
a Rain Storm albums.

Both Phil and Peter appear on Robert Fripp's _Exposure_ 

Tony and Mike did the soundtrack for the movie _The Shout_, but there 
was never any soundtrack album released. Parts of the soundtrack 
were present on A Curious Feeling in From the Undertow.

Phil Collins plays drums on 'Woman in Chains' from Tears for Fears 
'the seeds of love' Cd.

Phil also played drums on Robert Plant's _Principle of Moments_ album, a 
few songs on Eric Clapton's _Behind the Sun_, some of _August_, and "Bad
Love" from _Journeyman_ (and sang harmony). He played on about half of 
Peter Gabriel's third album (1980, Melt) as well as Steve Hackett's 
first solo album.  I think he played on at least one Argent album as well. 
And one Howard Jones song, "No One Is to Blame", the remix version.
Phillip Bailey's _China Wall_, most notably the song "Easy Lover", as
drummer (and duet).

_Vimana_ by Nova: Percy Jones plays bass and Narada Michael Walden 
plays drums. Phil does some percussion, although his contribution is 
about as extensive as the amount he did on Camel's _I Can See Your 
House from Here_ (i.e., practically nil). I think it came out in 1978, 
and I really doubt it's in print today. 

All Things Must Pass album by George Harrison. What I've heard also, is 
that none of the tracks Phil played on actually made it to the final album. 
So, he was there but he was not there... That's why his name isn't found 
on All Things Must Pass.

Phil also puts in an appearance one one track on Brian Eno's 
Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy, but I forget which track!

David Hentschel: his solo album _Startling Music_ added to the list 
of Phil's extracurricular actvities.

Anthony Phiilips also appeared on DOUBLE EXPOSURE a double LP which was 
relased in 1987 which contains a number of progrock bands.  The track called 
Promenade is not found on any other lp I believe.

1990 Grammy Awards: Phil Collins, who led with eight nominations, won 
record of the year for "Another Day in Paradise" on homelessness. "If 
I'd have gone home with eight nominations and no awards, my mother would 
have killed me," Collins said.  -- taken from a press release
