Here's my first revision of a Coil discography.  Any help in revising this
will be greatly appriciated...

                            COIL DISCOGRAPHY v1
                               April 5, 1993
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
A discography of releases from Coil.  All of their "own" releases are listed
first, followed by compilation appearances.
 
I'm the first to admit that this document is not yet complete, but I feel that
it's a pretty good "first draft".  Most of the information contained here has
been culled from my personal collection, with a few bits and pieces coming
from posts to rec.music.industrial and nm-list in the last 6 months or so.  I
still need, however, a fair bit of information, especially regarding original
LP and cassette releases.
 
ANY additions, corrections, or comments would be GREATLY appriciated.  Just
email any info you might have to the address at the end of this document.
Thanks!

        Notes:
        From the liner notes: "This release is not the follow-up to HORSE
        ROTORVATOR... but a completely seperate package - a stopgap and a
        breathing space - the space between two twins.  Presented here are
        thoroughbreds that escaped the Horse Rotorvator - discarded shards,
        distortions, disappointments, scrambled and disassembled stages.
        Remnants of what once was.  This record is a chance for us to
        release some otherwise placeless pieces of music."
 
        The initial limited edition release of the LP also included a 7"
        single with the following tracks:
