"I'm kinda glad I was able to come out of one successful band and sort of
 get into another one.  It kind of established me as... I don't know...
 I feel weird in a way because I totally, like, laid the groundwork for two
 bands and now I'm totally fucking broke."
			-- Bob Bert (and his ego), drummer for Pussy Galore

Current Info
============

DGC will be re-releasing older Youth material from _Confusion is Sex_
up to _Daydream Nation_, as well as Ciccone Youth material throughout
1993.  A *complete* discography (much better than this one) by Sonic
insider and buddy Epic Soundtracks will be printed in an upcoming Sonic
Death Fan Club letter, so join before this gets published or miss out
forever.  I am hoping to get permission to glean material from it to
add to this.

"If you only have a certain amount of money to spend making a record, there's
 a sense of spontaneity, because you don't have time to go over everything
 until it's perfect.  You can end up with a really bad record, too - it's
 more of a coin flip."					-- Kim Gordon
==============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Bad Moon Rising"
1985 - LP/CS on Homestead Records (HMS016)
1985 - LP/CS on Blast First (BFFP1)

Songs:	Intro, Brave Men Run, Society Is A Hole, I Love Her All The Time,
	Ghost Bitch, I'm Insane, Justice Is Might, Death Valley '69

Notes:	Etched on Blast First version side one - "It's a bird in the hand,
	it's a modern land - Sonics Rendsvouz" and on side two - "Prepare for
	the worst, hope for the best".  There are no etchings on the Homestead
	version.

198? - CD on Blast First (BFFP1CD)

Notes:	Blast First (founded by Paul Smith) became SY's European label at
	this point, and remain so at this time.

Songs:	Intro, Brave Men Run, Society Is A Hole, I Love Her All The Time,
	Ghost Bitch, I'm Insane, Justice Is Might, Death Valley '69,
	Satan is Boring, Flower, Halloween, Echo Canyon

Notes:	On the Blast First version of the CD "Halloween" is track 10, and
	"Flower" was set up as the lead-in groove (negative time) to that
	track.  To play "Flower" you have to skip to "Satan..." and then
	jump to the end.  Plus, for some reason, if you skip to track 10 and
	push play, some CD players hang and sit there forever doing nothing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Death Valley '69"
1984 - 7" single on Iridescence (I-12)

Songs:	Death Valley '69, Brave Men Run

1985 - 12" EP on Homestead Records (HMS021)
1985 - 12" EP on Blast First (BFFP2)

Songs:	Death Valley '69, I Dreamed I Dream, Inhuman, Brother James,
	Satan Is Boring

Notes:	Etched on side one of the Homestead version - "Raygun or Manson, its
	the same thing.", and on side two - "The S. Factor was ok on the day".
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Flower/Halloween"
1985 - 12" single on Homestead Records (HMS047)
1985 - 12" single on Blast First (BFFP3)

Songs:	Flower, Halloween

Notes:	The BFFP-release is on clear orange vinyl.  Etchings are side one -
	To Cody R and all sonic suns" and on side two "I am the boy who
	enjoys invisibility - James J."  The SST version has "one edge
	ripped, the other slipped" on the side one label.  Thurston is
	billed as "Thurston Sonic" on this release.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Flower"
1985 - 7" single on Blast First (7BFFP3)

Songs:	Flower (Anti Fuckword Radio Edit), Rewolf (Special Natas Mix)

Notes:	Rewolf is a mix of "Flower" backwards (at very low fidelity).
	The anti-fuckword edit is very funny.  It's just the song with a
	huge unpleasant beep over every "fuck", which is quite as obscene
	in its own way as the original song.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Halloween II"
1985 - 12" single on Blast First (BFFP3)

Songs:	Halloween

Notes:	This is a one-sided 12" single with a Savage Pencil drawing pressed
	in the vinyl.  Etched on the drawing side - "I am the boy that can
	enjoy invisibility" and on the music side - "Trick or treat master
	monster mix".  Rare.

	and "The Crucifixion of Sean Penn."  The LP release has a locked
	groove.  Etched in the SST version side one - "Destroy all record
	labels", and on side two - "Everything turns black to blue".  The
	Blast First version only has the side two etching.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1986 - 12" EP/CS on SST (SST080)

	we freak" and side two - "We're not homos, we rock (!!!)" but this is
	crossed out and followed by "We're rough, we're tough, we've had
	enough".  The 12" single is only etched on the B side - "Ganymedean
	slime molos  We're rough, we're tough, we've had enough".

Notes:  Limited edition live bootleg that has been pressed at least three
	times.  The first pressing is around $110, second is $75 and the
	third $35.  From the Bad Moon Rising Tour.  "C.B." is Claude Bessy
	of Catholic Discipline (from the film "The Decline Of Western
	Civilization Part One" - remember the line "Zere iz noh such t'ing
	as new weve... it is all zee product of some lame cunt's
	imagination..."

"Sister"
1987 - LP/CS on SST (SST134)
1987 - LP/CS on Blast First (BFFP20)

Songs:	Schizophrenia, (I Got A) Catholic Block, Beauty Lies In The Eye,
	Stereo Sanctity, Pipeline/Killtime, Tuff Gnarl, P.C.H., Hot Wire
	My Heart, Kotton Krown, White Kross 

198? - CD on SST (SST CD 134)
198? - CD on Blast First (BFFP20CD)

Songs:	Schizophrenia, (I Got A) Catholic Block, Beauty Lies In The Eye,
	Stereo Sanctity, Pipeline/Killtime, Tuff Gnarl, P.C.H., Hot Wire
	My Heart, Kotton Krown, White Kross, Master Dik (The Non-Beatbox
	Version)

Notes:	The official word from Steve Shelley on the blacked-out pictures on
	the album is as follows with my comments in brackets:

	"The Avedon photo [of the girl in overalls] is blacked out because
	Avedon threatened to sue.  The Disney photo was blacked out by
	confused or paranoid SST workers."

	Some copies of the LP were released with black stickers over the
	pictures which were easy to remove.  Later pressings have the
	pictures blacked out on the original artwork, but there were still
	a few unaltered and unstickered copies released as recently as 1990.
	I don't believe that the CD was ever stickered, but both blacked-out
	and original versions exist.  The European Blast First CD comes with
	the picture of the girl blacked out and the Disney card intact, as
	it should be.

	The song "Schizophrenia" is tenuously based an experience Phillip K.
	Dick had with a woman who wore a golden chain with a fish symbol on
	it.  The lyrics "I can't get laid 'cause everyone is dead" and
	"Only apparently, real to irreal" from "Stereo Sanctity" is from
	PKD's _Valis_ novel.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Sister Interview Disc"
1987 - LP on Blast First (CHAT1)

Songs:	The Sister Concept, Schizophrenia, Sonic Song Structure & Method,
	The Forthcoming Vids, Tuff Gnarl, Da Noo Yark Scene, Food Favorites,
	Sonic Signoff

Notes:	Interview with the band by Byron Coley of Forced Exposure magazine,
        May 14, 1987, in the Sonic Home on Eldridge St. New York City.
	Somewhat short, very silly, Steve says two words, maybe.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I Wanna Be Your Dog"
1987 - 7" single bootleg

Songs:	I Wanna Be Your Dog (with Iggy Pop) b/w Sister

Notes:	Etched on side one - "DOG", and on side two - "Cat."  The date listed
	for the show is Town & Country 4 June 87.  Says "Uncut Uncensored RAW
	Made in U.K." in lower right of back cover (with a distorted pic of
	Thurston).  Front cover is a Sonic Youth portrait by Sav X.

"Sonic Death"
1988 - CS/CD SST (SST181)
1988 - CS/CD Blast First (BFFP32)
1988 - CS/CD Ecstatic Peace!

Notes:	Live tracks from 1981 to 1983.  There are no song titles listed,
	nor are there breaks between most songs.  Running time is about 65
	minutes.  This was not pressed on vinyl to the best of my knowledge.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Daydream Nation"
1988 - 2xLP/CS/CD on Enigma (75403-02)
1988 - 2xLP/CS/CD on Blast First (BFFP34)
1988 - CD on BMG Compact Disc (D-201076)
1992 - CS/CD rerelease on Blast First/Mute in U.S. (???)
1993 - CS/CD on DGC (???)

Songs:	Teen Age Riot / Silver Rocket / The Sprawl / 'Cross The Breeze /
	Eric's Trip / Total Trash / Hey Joni / Providence / Candle /
	Rain King / Kissability / Trilogy: (a) The Wonder; (b) Hyperstation;
	(z) Eliminator Jr.

Notes:  The album originally came in a gatefold sleeve with a poster, and
	was released in the US under the Enigma label, which went under a
	couple of years later.  Since then, the album has been difficult to
	find, and import prices on the CD often exceeded $25.  Recently it
	has become available again through a licensing agreement with Mute,
	and will be reissued on DGC in 1993.  The CD booklet has a different
	band photo than the album.  Etched on side one - "Rock and Roll for
	president".  The infinity symbol represents Lee Ranaldo (see Lee's
	"From Here To Infinity" LP for details.)  Side two - "Star strangled
	Bangles".  The female symbol represents Kim Gordon, of course.  Side
	three - "Destory all record labels, part 2 - high, end".  The omega
	symbol is Thurston Moore, which stands for Leo, his astrological sign.
	Side four - "No sleep till Rhino".  The devil drummer with the cross
	up his butt is Steve Shelley, and is the design on the Sonic Death
	Fan Club pin.  The cover paintings are by German artist Gerhard
	Richter (born 1931.)  "Providence" is based on a sound from an
	overheating amp that Shelley said was making weird noises due to
	something they put in it.  The vocal is an answering machine message
	from Mike Watt to Thurston, scolding him for losing guitar cables.
	The part that says "...your memory just goes out the window..."
	is apparently a reference to memory loss from smoking pot.  The
	comments make more sense if one assumes the subject is pot rather
	than guitar cables.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Silver Rocket"
1988 - 7" single on Forced Exposure (FE-012 on vinyl, FE-014 on cover)

	interview with the band in one of the issues (specifics unknown.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
"One of the advantages of having Sonic Youth on a major label is that
 suddenly we're a legitimate alternative to Whitesnake.  But we would never
 want to be a forced alternative.  In other words, we would never, ever 
 tailor our tastes to be an obvious pop option."	-- Thurston Moore 
==============================================================================

Notes:  Real short interview with the band, includes a funky picture with
	the clearest picture of Kim Gordon I have ever seen (she looks like
	a fucking elf in this shot).  Brief and obscure explanations of some
	of the songs on "Goo."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Kooler Thing"
1990 -  7" single bootleg

	mentioned above, except on CD.  Another claims it's both that and
	the "Blowjob" bootleg mentioned later, and possibily more.  Seen for
	around $25-28.  I'm still looking for more details.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I really like playing with this band and I really like the things we're
 doing now.  I think the drums are something different in this band, but I
 think a lot of people don't notice that, or maybe they do and just don't
 say anything."						-- Steve Shelley

	liner notes read "This was the first live show of the songs from
	EVOL, at the Continental Club in Austin, Texas.  The next day we
	would sputter through a set for New Music America in Houston,
	outdoors like a sideshow act on some sort of weird float, our music
	vanishing amongst the tall ugly bldgs downtown, in broad daylight.
	This night, however, things felt pretty good, despite borrowed amps+
	drums (thanks to Furniture) and a set of (almost) all new songs-
	untried, stepping off the cliff.  Our future soundman Terry Pearson
	was part owner of the Continental at the time, and he did the house
	sound for this and hundreds of other gigs there.  The original
	cassette recording was made by Austin film-maker Bill Daniels;
	Wharton Tiers transferred it to digital; the end music is by Steve
	Fitch (Summer '86) and came with the tape.	-LR 91"

"100%"
1992 - CD5 on DGC (DGCDM-21735)

1992 - 10" on DGC? (DGCV11) on orange vinyl.

Songs:	100% / Creme Brulee / Genetic / Hendrix Necro

Notes:	The first two tracks are album cuts.  The second was mixed by
	Andy Wallace.  The vinyl is a European-only release, most likely
	illegal in the U.S. due to parallel import agreements.  The European
	version of the CD5 is identical except that it comes in a digi-pak
	instead of a jewel box, so U.S. buyers can skip the higher price.
	The 10" is on orange vinyl and supposedly limited in edition, although
	it is being given away free in France with the album in some shops.

Notes:	The double album contains an "album-only" bonus track.  There are two
	versions of the CD, a regular edition (DGCD-24485) that comes with a
	standard dark gray CD tray, but the "risque" version (DGCD 24493,
	limited edition 50,000, which is quite a lot, actually) comes with
	a transparent amber CD tray with an off-color graphic visible under
	it.  "Swimsuit Issue" does mention every single model in the latest
	Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

==============================================================================
"One night Johnson, Coley and I were sitting in the backyard with a bucket
of fresh sangria and a few bongloads of some very righteous boo.  I'd
brought out a box of my live Sonic Youth tapes and we were arguing about
Ranaldo's tongue vectors in the third quadrant of 'Society is a Hole' [Folk
City, NYC 12/1/82] when one of T. Moore's downstrokes caught our attention.
We ran the tape back and listened to the passage a few times.  The subtly
monstrous and mindless GUSH with which T. Moore hit the 'E' chord made it
obvious that his playing was not coming out of a complete spiritual void.
This was a real revelation.  It meant that he was capable of actually
unclenching his brain and loosing demons of soul creativity."
			-- Thomas Pynchon (sic) from "Barefoot In The Head"

"As far as I'm concerned, I was just as happy being where I was last year at
 this time when Sonic Youth wasn't on a major label... This deal with Geffen
 is very much a wait-and-see-what happens sort of deal - because we will
 absolutely not be dictated to by Geffen.  We signed because we had complete
 artistic control, and if any problems do arise... let's just say that I'll
 firebomb Geffen's offices to get thrown off the label if I have to.  Who
 fuckin' cares?"					-- Thurston Moore

Missing Information
===================

I could use more detailed information on the following, such as dates,
catalog numbers, and song listings:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 1986 Peel session that's never been bootlegged on vinyl or CD.  I have
an excellent tape copy now.  John Peel also recently mentioned that there
was a Sonic Youth LP reissued in Estonia and played a track off it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Sonic Youth "Live in Japan" bootleg was put out by Supernatural,
a shady Japanese label.  The label went under a few years back, taking the
SY live in Japan LP with it. The record is so rare that Steve Shelley doesn't
own a copy. It might be possible to locate the record by contacting Kenji at
Timebomb in Osaka, Japan. Time bomb is a great record store specializing in
non-Japanese "underground" music. The fax number is 011 81 6 213 5079.  If he
does have it, I'm sure it will cost a small fortune.  Don't bother asking
Forced Exposure if they have it. They don't.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Thurston was in a band called Even Worse for a while (early 80s).
Don't know too much about them, except for a few songs that I remember
hearing on KZSC back then (incl. one called "We Suck" that was kind of funny.
Female Vocals.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information about Lee Ranaldo's collaboration with the dutch band
Plus Instruments.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Peel mentioned a new LP release by a German band DIE HAUT and played a
track `Intoxication' off it, with Kim Gordon singing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could you tell me if any of SY members (maybe Kim or Thurston) have played
with the belgian band Thick Pidgeon. I think there is some connection because
of the Miranda name on the Kim Gordon track.  Miranda could be the singer of
Thick Pidgeon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A documentary on the "NY music scene" called something like "Put Some Blood
in the Music" that I saw on PBS a while back.  It was about an hour long,
and the  second half was all Sonic Youth, _Daydream Nation_ period (the first
half  was John Zorn, and there were short segments on the Ambitious Lovers
and  Hugo Largo).  It was mostly interviews with the band, other
New York scene people (Branca, Lydia Lunch, Kramer, etc.) talking about SY, 
and some performance footage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey Rob, here's some more Sonic Youth info for ya. Also, check out the 
new Ajax records catalog, they're selling a couple new SY-related 7"s,
like some of the stuff Kim and Thurston performed at the Knitting Factory
during the last NMS.
