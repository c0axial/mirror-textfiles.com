             Sid            (ssowder@silver.ucs.indiana.edu)
for help in the discogrphy on the non NIN CD information.
 
This list needs your vinyl, cassette, imports, bootlegs, etc...
 
Track times taken from CD. If not on the CD, times taken from my player.
 
CD  = Compact Disc            CS  = Cassette
CDS = Compact Disc Single     12" = 12 inch record
CD5 = Compact Disc E.P.       10" =    You get
LTD = Limited Release          9" =    the idea
 
BAND INFORMATION (current and Previous):
 
Trent was in a group called SIN which was in the movie Light of Day.
He was also in Exotic Birds and Hypo Luxa.
And now NINE INCH NAILS IS TRENT REZNOR.
 
 
You can write NIN at:     P.O. Box 16681
                          Cleveland, OH 44116
                          USA
 
NOTE:  This address is NOT reliable.  I've written twice and received shit!
       On the Broken E.P. Trent says THIS time they'll send something.

2.  Supernaut                                              6:24
                                                           =====
                                                           11:52
 
Note:  The disc says it's a promo and there's a number
       stamped on the back. It also has HALO 00 on it.
       This is just to make it look real...it's a bootleg!
 
       Suck was probably recorded during the Lollapalooza Tour.
 
       Supernaut is from either the "stolen" Wax Trax Demo or
       the 1000 Homo D.J.'s 12" of Supernaut.  I don't know if
       the 12" was ever released or not.  This is the song that
       got TVT's pants all up in a bunch over Trent's contract.

*  Only tracks on the U.K. version
** Not on the U.S. release
 
Note:  Also called HALO THREE
 
       The 10" was a limited edition containing a poster,
       and maybe the "Opal" mix.  I never seen this so
       my information on this is lossy.
 
       The 12" in the US has a different track listing.
       I think it lacked the "Down In It" tracks.
       Again, I've never seen this.

Note:  Also called HALO FOUR
 
       I think the 9" has everything, except maybe the long mix.
       But don't quote me on that cause I never seen it.
