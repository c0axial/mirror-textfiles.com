

  Well, here is my latest Vangelis discography.  In the past few months,
Vangelis hasn't released any new music, but his old companies (RCA and
Polydor) have released some of his music that was previously unreleased or
released in a new format.  Albedo 0.39, Heaven and Hell and See You Later were
all re-released in CD format. A CD single of Chariots of Fire was released. 
And Polydor released (or will release, depending when and where you read this)
Themes, an album that contains some unreleased music with alot of previously
released music.
  I haven't heard anything about the next orginal release in the "Direct
series" that the Arista CD cover spoke of.  Anyone else know anything?
  Well, the discography follows.  The last release was version 2.1, made in
Late April I believe.  Please send me replies if you have any additions or see
any errors.  Thank you.

instrumental, and what kind of vocals they have:

Albedo 0.39		English voice-over.  Contains tapes of US astronauts
                        on moon, and a brief recoding from Postal Tele-
                        communications in London.
Chariots of Fire	On the non-Vangelis track, the Ambrosian singers sing
                        music of Parry.
China			Short English voice-over with Chinese Accent
Direct			Short Greek (?) voice over on "Message" .  English
                        voice-over on one track. [Note: it's stupid...]
