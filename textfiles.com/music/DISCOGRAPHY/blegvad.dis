	All singles come in a picture sleeve unless otherwise indicated.
	CDs come in a jewel box unless otherwise indicated.

	Information flagged with a question mark is not verified, if
	you have further information, please let me know.

	Most CD track times were found using a NAD 4170 compact disc player
	and the time on your CD player may vary slightly (+- 5-8 seconds),
	due to the way different machines calculate track times.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
	There are so many different musicians on some of these releases
	that I have not attempted to provide track-by-track attributions.

	Restless Records has purchased Celluloid, and has repackaged the
	first four Golden Palominos records on two CDs.

	The 1992 "King Strut" single on the Singles Only Label claims that
	"King Strut" is from the `forthcoming LP' whilst "King Strut &
	Other Stories" was originally released in July 1990.  Does this
	indicate that perhaps SOL will release the LP in the US?

	Kristoffer Blegvad appears on "Greaves, Cunningham", an album by
	John Greaves and David Cunningham.  Kristoffer Blegvad also
	contributes backing vocals on Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskins'
	cover of "Levi Stubbs' Tears", which can be found on their album
	"The Big Idea".

	The Pale Saints cover Blue Flowers by Peter Blegvad and Anthony
	Moore, possibly from Slapp Happy's album Sort Of, on their 1992 EP
	Throwing Back The Apple (CD-5 UK 4AD BAD 2008 CD).

	Please send me any additional information you have about these or
	other releases featuring Peter Blegvad.
