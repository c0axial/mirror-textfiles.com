        +This lineup performed one track ("Mr. Pine") on the LP below;
        the remaining tracks were by the original members.
        This recording also marks the first appearance of the work of
        lyricist Betty Thatcher.

        released:

                _Illusion_ (1971) Island (UK) HELP 27

        At this point, the original lineup departed.  McCarty, Relf,
        and Cennamo went on to form the band _Armageddon_.  McCarty, 
        however, continued contributing songs to the 'new' Renaissance 
        until 1974.  After Keith Relf's death in 1976, the original
        Renaissance reformed as _Illusion_, whose work is discussed at the 
        end of the discography.

        Michael Dunford was briefly a member of the band until he
        quit to concentrate on his songwriting. His replacement, Mick 
        Parsons, was killed in an accident right before _Prologue_ was 
        recorded.  Rob Hendry was Parsons' last-minute replacement.
        On the original LP, the band dedicated _Prologue_ to Parsons.

        departure of Rob Hendry, Michael Dunford was not a regular member 
        of Renaissance until 1974.
