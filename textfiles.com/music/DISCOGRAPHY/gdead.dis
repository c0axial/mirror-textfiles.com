Here is an attempt to summarize the Grateful Dead's history on vinyl, film,

282 albums, 95 singles, 87 movies/tv shows/videos/ads, 44 books, and 12 song
books where the band or members of the band appear.  If you should know of any
more, please let me know and I will post an updated list later.  Thanks!

In the history of recorded sound, many formats have been used:  wax cylinders,
78 rpm records, 45 rpm records (in mono and stereo), 33 1/3 rpm records (in
mono, stereo, CD-4, QS, and SQ), reel-to-reel tape (in stereo and four track),
eight track tape, cassette, CD, and DAT among them.  Some have disappeared from
popular usage and some are still with us.  I have used the most popular format,
the 33 1/3 revolutions per minute long playing record, as the method of listing
recordings in this discography.  Where there are differences, I have included
other formats.  In particular, this applies to CDs, which often include new
or additional material not available on the records, and to cassettes, which
sometimes are the only other format, besides CD, being used to release material.
In some cases, material is only being released on CDs.  I have tried to be
thorough, but ...
