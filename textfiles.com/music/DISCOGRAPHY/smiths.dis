Well, this one has been a long time in the coming.  The re-relesed singles
seem to have slowed/stopped (from what I can see), but I *think* they are
re-releasing the old albums (ie. "Hatful of Hallow", etc.) so it will give
me something to add sooner or later... ;-)  I've got times now on quite
a few of the singles/albums, but I still need more, so if you see a blank you
can fill drop me mail.  Someone with the UK "Best... II", please, if you
can drop me a line with the catalog number.  Don't have access to it.

Finally, I've made my discographies available on my UNIX machine for anonymous
FTP.  The site is (frontios.niagara.edu).  It will have the most recent
versions, and the works in progress, so if you wish to help you may.  The
directory is /pub/Music.  There is a Morrissey discography here that is
pretty much complete, but I don't consider it a full release yet.  I need info.
on his newer stuff, so if you can help out, please do! :)

Take care.
