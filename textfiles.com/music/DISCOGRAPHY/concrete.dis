Please send me <clare@aero.org> any additional information you
have about these or other releases featuring Concrete Blonde or
any of its members.

Special thanks to: (in alphabetical order)
	Craig "Archbishop" <V095PX49@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu>, Jill Waterson

NOTE: This discography format is based on the They Might Be Giants discography
maintained by John Relph <relph@presto.ig.com>

NOTES:
	Concrete Blonde used to be known as the Dreamers (on The
	D.I.Y.  Album), and Dream 6 before they got the name "Concrete
	Blonde" which was given to them by Michael Stipe.

	Johnette Napolitano used to be a member of the Ringling
	Sisters, and wrote the song "Roses Grow" originally for them.

	"Les Coeurs Jumeaux" translates to "Twin Hearts"; one can
	wonder what the rest of the song translates to...

	There is supposed to be a video to be released entitled
	"Mid-Life Crisis" which is rumored to be a home-video
	documentary shot by Johnette herself, and mixed in with other
	footage.  Latest information has the release date listed as
	"TBA".  Originally it was to be released simultaneously with
	WALKING IN LONDON.

	There is an e-mailing list for discussion of Concrete Blonde,
	Johnette Napolitano, and related groups and/or people.  The
	address is <concrete-blonde@piggy.ucsb.edu>.  If you would like
	to join, send your request to
	<concrete-blonde-request@piggy.ucsb.edu>.  PLEASE remember that
	the `concrete-blonde' address forwards to the entire list; for
	administrative correspondence, send only to the `-request'
	address.

	There is a Concrete Blonde fan club, $10 fee, but it has not
	done anything as of yet.

	Information with question marks is not known/verified, if you
	have further information, please let me know.  There are
	probably several more Promo singles, for example.
