                    Jane's Addiction Discography            
                      Date: March 7, 1992    
   
Editor's note: This is a compilation of recordings of Jane's Addiction.    
It has been compiled by and for the fine JA fans on the janes-addiction    
emailing list.  I have tried to be as comprehensive as possible, but that     
does not mean I am above error.  If you find an error, have a comment, or a    
question do not hesitate to send it to me.    
     This list is not final.  It is kept updated on a fairly regular basis. If
you have something to add, please send it to the list so that everyone knows
about it immediately and mention somewhere that it should be added to the 
Discography.  You may also send items to me directly if you wish to remain 
anonymous.  The updated version of the Discography will always be available
in the archives.    
     A short guide: Each item has a number and a letter.  The key to letters    
are as follows: A-album, S-single, R-rare/hard to find item, B-bootleg, M-    
miscellaneous.  There is info on what medium(s) the item is available.  There    
is also a something called Length which I've had to leave blank in most cases    
for lack of info.  If people could supplement that, it would be appreciated.    
There is a list of songs, followed by review(s) of the item.  If you have the    
item in question or are really familiar with it and would like to send in a     
review to me, please don't hesitate, even if it's already been reviewed.  After    
each review is the reviewers email address.  Ones that do not have this were    
reviewed by me.  The last catagory is Avail.     
This explains how to aquire the item.  It either describes what kind of store, how  
to order, or an email address to contact.  In the last case there is usually    
a quote describing that person's terms for trade.  These people do not have to    
stick to what is written here.  They are free to change their terms.  If you    
are quoted here and would like to change your quote, please send it to me.     
Also, the miscellaneous category contains some other artifacts other than     
recordings.    
     Finally, at the end are two appendixes.  One lists every song that is    
available on the Discography followed by what item(s) it is available on.  The    
second appendix contains a list of email addresses of people who have items up    
for trade followed by the items they have to trade.  This is to fascilitate    
trading so that when you are contacting them you know exactly what they have.    
     Remember, the Discography has two purposes: to inform people of what JA    
has been recorded, and to make it easier for people to get it.  I hope it    
accomplishes this.  Please send me any comments you have on this.  Anyway,    
HERE WE GO!   -John Ford aka Juanito, managing editor

Item 1A   Jane's Addiction (Triple X Records, 1987)            
Medium:   Vinyl, Cassette, CD            
Length:   40:16            
Contains: Trip Away

          Sympathy            
          Chip Away            
            
Reviews:  This is JA's first true album that is currently available as such.        

 
It is semi-live.  In other words, the audience is audible, but the bootleg          

 
feeling is not there.  As with all three albums, sound quality is as good as it     

 
gets.            
            
Avail.:   At most record stores at regular prices.            
          
            
Item 2A   Nothing's Shocking (Warner Bros., 1988)

          Pigs In Zen            
            
Reviews:  Jane's first major label release.  There are two songs here that          

 
appear on the first album.  There is a noticable difference on Jane Says in the     

 
presence of a steal drum.  Pigs In Zen contains a different monologue from          

 
Perry.              
            
Avail.    At most record stores at normal prices.

          Classic Girl            
            
Reviews:  A noticable difference is the number of longer, slightly mellower         

 
songs that contain more than one musical theme.  One thing about shopping for       

 
this album is that it appears in two different covers.  Beware of record stores     

 
that sell this with a white cover that has the first ammendment on it.

Review:   Picture Disc: "The sleeve is simply a square, with a large circle cut
out of the middle so you can see the picture on the inside.  The back cover of
the sleeve has a large picture of what looks like an orchid.  The front of the
picture disc is the cover from 'Ritual', and the back is a closeup of the cover
of the Classic Girl domestic CD realease (of Xiola).  Very nice item... I'll
hang it on my wall." -<PML3@ns.cc.lehigh.edu>

Item 10S  Mt. Song 
Medium:   7" vinyl
Length:
Contains: Mt. Song
          Standing In the Shower... Thinking

Reviews:  "On the front is a picture of Perry with mic in hand (screaming, of
course).  The same picture from the cover of Soul Kiss, just clearer.  The
picture is superimposed on the 'Casey-twins' with their heads on fire (not very
visible, you can only make out the two flames).  It has 'Jane's Addiction'
written vertically from top to bottom, with 'Mountain Song' horizontal across
the 'Jane's'.  On the back are pictures of Eric, Dave and Stephen, with a
picture of Perry kissing either Casey or Dave. It's hard to tell. :-)  Great
packaging.  By the way, both songs are album versions."

Reviews:  This is one of those NOT FOR SALE PROMO ONLY things.  It is           
completely live including short Perry monologues in between songs.  The           
monologues are interesting, and the music is pretty desent too.  Sound quality      

 
is extremely good considering that this is basically a bootleg.

Reviews:  Live, but not quite as live as the other one.  Each song is in its        

 
own recording clip so there is little in between talk.  Too bad, but there are      

 
very interesting versions of Pigs and I would.  Perry gets a little heavy on      
the echo effect.

Length:           
Contains: Been Caught Stealing (remix off of single with bongos, incredible)        

 
          Had a Dad (demo) (track 3 of domestic been caught... single. rough,       

 
               interesting, i like)           
          L.A. Medley (live) (found on cardboard clad (not the gemboxed)            
               classic girl single, a really neat medley of the doors' l.a.         

 
               woman, a song called nausea, and lexicon devil. perry's           
               incomprehensible, dave's all over the place, the other two           
               pound.  good deal.)           
          Had A Dad (live) (Off the Shocking EP (UK only?) 12" release) (a          

               little feedback, drums patter in, the bass grooves. totally          

               different version. two thumbs up and a big toe for good measure.     

 
               perry should speak up.)           
          Three Days (listed in two parts, but the same as the album version)       

 
          I Would For You (demo) (slightly shorter than the XXX version; can        

 
               also be found on the Stop! single)           
          Jane Says (demo) (or so they say... sounds identicle to the NoSho         

 
               track, steel drums and all.)           
          No One's Leaving (live) (anailable on classic girl singles. pretty        

 
               close to album version, just a bit wilder and with screaming         

 
               audience.)           
          Ain't No Right (live) (also on classic girl.  stephen beats the hell      

 
               out of the drums, perry's voice actually audible and fairly          

               comprehensible.  Oh yes, and there's this great bit at the end       

 
               where perry tells off this guy who threw a birkenstock at him.)      

 
  
Reviews:  Genereal analysis... dunno if it was really worth $20 for me, since i      

 
already had virtually everything on it, but it is handy to have them all on one     

 
disc for the occasional real dance i dj.  It's a must, though, if you haven't       

 
bought any of the singles and want some different versions of some really great

Reviews:  "The sound quality is excellent, and is probably the funniest I've
ever heard Perry. For instance, during Pigs, he replaces the normal words with
'The bouncer is a pig...'  Before Summertime he says 'Now might be a nice time
for bouncers to beat some people up' and, 'Randy Savage is going to kick the
shit out of Hulk Hogan' 'I like the bad guys, and lovely Miss Elizabeth' 'I
dedicate this song to Miss Eleizabeth'.  Pretty funny stuff.  Perry puts on a
really good show on this boot, even though he sounds like he's had a few
substances."  -<PML3@ns.cc.lehigh.edu>

Reviews:  The sound here is audience boot, but not bad.  As the tape     
progresses, the sound seems to improve.  This show is noteworthy for Perry's     
comments, and the story that goes with it.  The show was so short because Perry     
was in a bad mood, and so apparently was the audience.  Of course, Perry      
usually insults the audience, but this show he didn't seem to want to play.     
When the show was over--JA walked off--there were riots and several people were     
hurt, which included some police brutality.  The show was pretty well known      
because of this, and it set the tone for a bunch of short shows JA played.  The     
song versions themselves aren't very innovative--no new lyrics or anything.

Reviews:  This was recorded on a dictation microcassette recorder and is almost    
literally a bootleg.  (really a pant-leg)  Because of this, the quality is not    
very good at all, though it is listenable and even pretty good in spots.  It is    
all in mono and has LARGE amounts of distortion and practically every other    
problem a tape can have.    
     Some particularly good bits are (of course) Perry's dialogue with himself  
at the beginning of Three Days (including a plug for the upcomming    
Lollypoploser) Aint No Right, and Oceansize.  In all, the playing sounds almost     
inspired, though the live visuals seemed downright boring to me.    
     Some Perry-isms:    
     "You just gotta tell people what you want, usually you get it..."    
     "Me, I'm outta fuckin' control, I keep asking for things and I keep     
getting them.  I'm just a skinny little jew, just the same as you..."    
     Overall, this would have been a GREAT bootleg if it had been recorded on   
better equipment.   -<lancer@wpi.WPI.EDU>

Reviews:  "It's a pretty decent boot.  Three Days is also accompanied by a
fairly lengthy intro by Perry, where he touches on thins as puking by the porta
toilets, dying, and getting your life together.  Pigs has a fairly short
monologue, he touches on his life style 'I'm living the high life, and I take
my medecine when I come down' etc.  Anyways, that's the long and the short of
it.  Classic Girl is decent, considereing the only other live version I have of
it is fairly unaudible."

Contains: interview with Perry and Dave about NoSho Disc.
Reviews:  "Half the time Perry answers the wrong questions... perfect sound...
found it in a used tape store... has bits of interview about what the songs on
NoSho are about and then the songs themselves... I think it was recorded in the
studio that is shown in Soul Kiss that Perry sings "City" in... the
interviewer's voice sounds the same and a bit of the interview on the video is
also on the cassette tape.."   -<mandarin@bsu-cs.bsu.edu>
