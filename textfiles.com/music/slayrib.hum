ANGEL OF DEATH
(Lyrics/Music: Hanneman)

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain	the way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay  showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in, like cattle you run	stripped of, your life's worth
Human mice, for the angel of death  400,000 more to die

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Sadistic, surgeon of demise  sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying, without mercy, to benefit the Aryan race
Surgery, with no anesthesia  feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind  strapped down screaming out to die

Angel of death
Monarch to kingdom of the dead
Infamous, butcher, angel of death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh, drips away
Test of heat burns your skin your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last in this frozen water burial
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time til you rip yourselves apart

Millions laid out in their, crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve, the holocaust

Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleede
Praying for the end of your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down your blood running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of the mutants he's creating

Pathetic, harmless victims, left to die
Rancid, angel of death, flying free

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Infamous, butcher, angel of death


PIECE BY PIECE
(Lyrics/Music: King)

Modulistic terror  a vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit  is going piece by piece
You have no choice of life or death  my face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh til there's no breath  dismembered destiny

As soon as life has left your corpse I'll make you part of me
No emotion  death is all I see

Modulistic terror  a vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit  is going piece by piece
Bones and blood lie on the ground  rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found  on my wall your head!

On your trail I close the gap one more life that soon won't be
No emotion  your flesh is all I need

I'll send you to your maker  confront the god you seek
A flash of red upon his chest  safety out of reach



NECROPHOBIC
(Lyrics/Music: Hanneman/King)

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged
Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for some air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair

Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb

Experimentation, slow infection, internal decay
Execution, need transfusion, body rots away
Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, life becomes your fine

Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged
Asphyxiation, suffocatio, gasping for some air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair
Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosiom life becomes your fine

Necrophobic can't control the paranoia
Scared to die



ALTAR OF SACRIFICE
(Lyrics:King, Music:Hanneman)

Waiting the hour destined to die here on the table of Hell
A Figure in white unknown by man approaching the altar of death
High priest awaiting daggar in hand spilling the pure virgin blood
Statan's slaughter ceremonial death answer his every command

Death will come easy just close your eyes dream of the friends you'll see
Heavenly failure losing again move on to a new form of life

Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
Confronting the evil you dread
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul
Soon you will meet the undead

Enter to the realm of Satan!

Blood turning black the change has begun
Feeling the hatred of all damned in Hell
Flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
Eyes dripping blood realization of death
Transforming of five toes to two
Learn the sacred words of praise, Hail Satan

A gift of powers disposed upon you use them when you feel the need
Master the forces and powers of Satan controlling the creature's instinct
Drawn to the castles that float in the sky learn to resist the temptation
Watching the angels sift through the heavens endlessly search for salvation



JESUS SAVES
(Lyrics: King, Music: Hanneman, King)

You go to church you kiss the cross you will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality Christianity
You spend your life just kissing ass a trait that's grown as time has passed
You think the world will end today you praise the lord it's all you say

Jesus saves, listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates when death takes you away

For all respect you cannot lust in an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies depopulate Satanas rise
You will be an accessory irreverence and blasphemy

Jesus saves, no need to pray
The gates of pearl have turned to gold it seems you've lost your way

Jesus saves, no words of praise
No promised land to take you to there is no other way



CRIMINALLY INSANE
(Lyrics/Music: Hanneman/King)

Night will come and I will follow, for my victims no tomorrow
Make it fast your time of sorrows, on his trail I'll make you follow

Quarters for the criminally insane, the sentence read for life I must remain
The path I chose has led me to my grave, to try again I'd have no other way

Quarters for the criminally insane, escape for me has fast become a game
Soon to be I'll leave without a trace, endangered species end the human race

Branded in pain, marked criminally insane
Locked away and kept restrained
Disapprobation but what have I done
I have only just begun
To take your fuckin' lives!



REBORN
(Lyrics: King, Music: Hanneman)

Convicted witch my life will end at midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent to insubordinate
Secured by lock inside a cell imprisoned for no crime
These shackles will be useless when your life is out of time

Incantation spell gone by I will see life again
My deals will made eternally I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there's no end I will be reborn

No gift of exile in my fate I'll get no amnesty
You can't control my destiny there is no habitual nees
Proclaim my death to end my wrath, it takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse I will never die

You think by killing me tonight my powers will not rise
There'll be nowhere for you to run when my hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy allowing no first born
Defy your morbid declaration leave you ripped and torn

Count your blessing would be priest as I burn upon the stake
You'd be forgiven endlessly but your values all are fake
Forever servant of my lord by choice and not submission
Maybe now I've made you wonder am I superstition

Incantation spell gone by I will live again
My deals will made eternally I signed the book in red
My rage will be unleashed again burning the next morn
Death means nothing there's no end, I will be reborn



EPIDEMIC
(Lyrics: King, Music: Hanneman/King)

Breeding fast in poverty infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate left in charge to dominate

Waiting to unfold, raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine, infest my corpse to be

Unyielding kings of agony test your body chemistry
Pulmonary overthrow possession of your inner throne
Invasions quickly override malicious domineering strike
Flood your veins commit slow death, deteriorate your maker's met

Perpetual demise, on a fast decline
Killing tendency, Epidemic permanent disease

Incapacitate, fall into your fate
Pain results in screams, bleed internally
Years will pass before it can be cured



POSTMORTEM
(Lyrics/Music: Hanneman)

Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck
Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind

Chanting words of blind witchery to save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live, new life born from the oppressed

Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the face you feel it draws near
Fatality, reality, you await the final call

My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence, tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever, share insanity

Do you want to die!

The waves of blood are rushing near pounding at the wall of lies
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death



RAINING BLOOD
(Lyrics: Hanneman/King, Music: Hanneman)

Trapped in purgatory a lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal death will be their acquisition
The sky is turning red return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above
Awaiting the hour of reprisal your time slips away

Raining blood, from a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror creating my structure

Now I shall reign in blood!
