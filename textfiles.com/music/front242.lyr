    Tradgedy (for You)
    ------------------

	  from the album Tyranny (for You)

With that skill that was her's alone
She drove her clutches into me
I was dumbfounded
She was hungry
She required me entirely
All thats left is the earth to remain
Its a dull and cruel pain
That passes the ages unaltered
Her sandface in my heart
I still feel disemboweled
I clearly retain
The planned,
The void
The sore in my soul 
The mark in my heart
Of acid rain


The sore in my soul 
The mark in my heart
Of acid rain
And that voice that was hers alone
Still resounds in me
She left me dislocated
Disenvowered
And twitching
Her enemies in my heart
etc.

     With Your Cries
     ---------------

	     from the album GEOGRAPHY

Irrelevant questions
Queer responses with double meanings
Disordered, Distorted voices 
Coming from distant,
Dismal volclimes
It makes you feel glad
It makes you take on a new lease of life
It makes you feel glad
It makes you fill the air with your cries
Irrelevant questions
Queer responses with double meanings
Disordered, Distorted voices 
Coming from distant,
Dismal volclimes 
Disordered, Distorted
Disordered, Distorded
Disordered, Distorded

Take your time, hold the line
Is it important?
Such a mess, tenderness
This is my secret
I'm so glad
You command
We're on the cover
You on there?
I dont care
Just take the
You say yes, you say no
Remain indifferent
I'm so scared and prepared
It makes no difference
I'm so scared and prepared
It makes no difference
I'm so scared and prepared
It makes no difference
Take your time, hold the line
Is it important?
Such a mess, tenderness
This is my secret
I'm so glad
You combine
We're on the cover
You on there?
I dont care
Just take the
You say yes, you say no
Remain indifferent
I'm so scared and prepared
It makes no difference
I'm so scared and prepared

Such a mess, tenderness
This is my secret
I'm so glad

We're on the cover
You say yes, you say no
Remain indifferent
I'm so scared and prepared
It makes no difference
That's a lovely good time to watch the future
