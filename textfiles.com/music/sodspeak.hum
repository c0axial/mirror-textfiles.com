CombatCore Records, 1985



Sargent "D" and the S.O.D.
--------------------------
Ruthless and vicious he'll stomp on your face
Deadly, malicious, stay out of his space
He'll rip your eyes out, don't look the wrong way
And once you meet him, there's no time to pray
He'll rip your heart out, make you eat your own lips
Then crack your elbows, and crush fingertips

CHORUS:
He'll make you wish that you didn't exist
Cause Sargent D is coming, and you're on his list

Don't cut the line, cause he'll cut off your leg
Don't take your time or you'll spend time with the dead
Don't try to trick him, he'll fill you with lead
Don't beg for mercy, he'll piss on your head
He'll kill your sister, then mail back the tits
He'll beat you senseless, then break out the whips

(CHORUS) - (MOSH PART)

He'll put gas on your kids, then throw them a match
He'll back the car over grandma, then dissect her cat
With his Stormtroopers of Death, he'll come to your town
Their uzi's rip through flesh, then it's time to chow down
Their cause is justified, their reason is clear
The word revenge is all that they hear

(CHORUS)

Kill Yourself
-------------
Can't take it, never could
Time to end it, wish you would
Friends and family, they're all gone
Life for you is just a con
Dig yourself a hole in the ground
Push up daisies six feet down
Take a dirt nap, by the farm
Inject a bubble in your arm

CHORUS:
Kill yourself, kill yourself
Why don't you kill yourself
Don't rely on no one else
End it all just kill yourself

Life is just a one-way ticket
Everyone must go around
Here's a bucket go and kick it
Slit your wrist without a sound
When you go don't make a big deal
No dramatics, don't overplay
Cause don't you know that we'll all feel
Better once you've gone away

(CHORUS) - (MOSH PART)

You're a loser, there's nothing left for you
A worthless loser, at everything you do

Milano Mosh
-----------
You think that, you're really hard
You think, that you can mosh
Got your suspenders, and got your boots
You better wear armor, you fuckin fool
We mosh, until we die
We mosh, until you fry
You think that you can try
But can you do...the Milano Mosh

(REPEAT VERSE)

Speak English or Die
--------------------
You come into this country
You cant get real jobs
Boats and boats and boats of you
Go home you fuckin slobs
Selling hot-dogs on the corner
Selling papers in the street
Pushing, pulling, digging, sweating
Where you come from must be beat

CHORUS:
You always make us wait
You're the ones we hate
You can't communicate
Speak english or die

You don't know what I want
You don't know what I need
Why must I repeat myself
Can't you fuckin read
Nice fuckin accents
Why can't you speak like me
What's that dot on your head
Do you use it to see

(CHORUS) - (MOSH PART) - (CHORUS)

United Forces
-------------
It doesn't matter how you wear your hair
It's what's inside your head
United Forces stand for all strong and fair
Black, white and yellow and red

CHORUS:
United Forces, United Forces, united
United Forces, United Forces, united

Skinheads and bangers and punks stand as one
Cross-over to a final scene
United Forces and their job won't be done
Until the world can see

(CHORUS)

No rednecks, no jocks, no macho-bullshit attitudes
United Forces can't be stopped - (REPEAT 2X)

Chromatic Death
---------------
Chromatic death
Chromatic death

Pi Alpha Nu
-----------
Going out to drink beer
Having loads and loads of fun
Don't complain spring break is here
Hanging out in P and G's

CHORUS:
Pi Alpha Nu
Pi Alpha Nu

Hanging out in the trippin fields
Jumping into mud puddles
Toga party was a blast
Don't know how the people last

(CHORUS) - (MOSH PART) - (CHORUS)

Antiprocrastination Song
------------------------
Antiprocrastination song

Freddy Krueger
--------------
He's hands spells death
He breathes his vile breath
No way you can stop him once he's out
He haunts your sleep in the tub he hides down deep
He rips your face and no one hears you shout

CHORUS:
He's come for you, what will you do
He slash you and rip you and cut you in two

His teeth are black
Flex metal knuckles with a crack
Maggots crawling all throughout his skin
He'll get them all
Everyone will hear his call
When his razors grip beneath their chin

(CHORUS) - (MOSH PART)

As the blood begins to splat
On his sweater and on his hat
His rotted mouth smiles as you die
His colors red and green
His skin's not what it seems
He rips at it and tears off his own flesh

(CHORUS)

Milk
----
I woke up, can't wait to eat
Got my cereal, boy was I beat
Open the fridge, and to my dismay
There was no milk, my mother will pay

CHORUS:
I want some milk, my coffee grows cold
I want some milk, I should've been told

BRIDGE:
I wish I had some goddamn milk
My cheerio's just ain't the same
I wish I had some goddamn milk
Too bad the milkman never came

I can't go out to the store
I just wait till my mother buys more
I'll just have wheat-thins and beer
If I get sick, the toilet is near

(CHORUS) - (BRIDGE) - (CHORUS)

Pre-Menstrual Princess Blues
----------------------------
Erving! Where are my maxi-pads?
Help me find them before I paint the whole house red!
You men have it soooo easy...
I wish that you could feel this just one....
I'm passing clots the size of basketballs

CHORUS:
Pre-Menstrual Princess Blues
Pre-Menstrual Princess Blues
Pre-Menstrual Princess Blues
Pre-Menstrual Princess Blues

Oh God. It stained right on to my new dress!!
Godammit, why'd this have to happen now
Oh...you're hungry are you?
Well come here Erving darling...
How about a bloody merry!!!

(CHORUS)

Pussy Whipped
-------------
Walk the dog, do the dishes
Your lips are brown from kissing ass
Sorry guys I can't make it
Maybe next time, think I'll pass
Don't make her mad, don't make her sad
A fate for you that's worse than death
You're a slave and you don't know it
It always happens to the best

CHORUS:
Pussy whipped, pussy whipped
Don't you know you're pussy whipped
Pussy whipped, pussy whipped
Don't you know you're pussy whipped

She wants to be involved with you
In every little thing you do
Always has to add her two cents
It's obvious who wears the pants
Your friends all hate you, you don't care
Cause you have been trapped in her lair
And hopefully one day you'll see
That pussy can be caught for free

(CHORUS) - (MOSH PART) - (REPEAT FIRST VERSE) - (CHORUS)

Fistbanging Mania
-----------------
You see them in the front
At every fuckin show
Fistbanging maniacs
With heads that move so slow
Who wants to see your fist
Right in their fuckin face
They should learn to mosh
Or leave the fuckin place

CHORUS:
Fistbanging mania
Fistbanging mania
Fistbanging mania
Fistbanging mania

(MOSH PART)

You know that they mean well
But it still makes you frown
Why can't they really thrash
And put their fistbangs down
Save that fistbanging shit
For bands like Motley Crue
Or when you come see us
We'll dive on top of you

(CHORUS)

No Turning Back
---------------
We will fry
We never learn, so now we burn

The time has come to start again
But first we must all see the end
By hand of God or man
To oblivion we descend
I think that this is understood
Wouldn't stop it if I could
Time for the human race to die
And give this world a chance to thrive

(CHORUS)

Fuck the Middle East
--------------------
Fuck the middle east
There's too many problems
They just get in the way
We sure could live without them
They hijack our planes
They raise our oil prices
We'll kill them all and have a ball
And end their fuckin crisis
Beirut, Lebanon - won't exist once we're done
Libya, Iran - we'll flush the bastards down the can
Syrians and Shites - crush their faces with our might
Then Israel and Egypt can live in peace without these dicks

Douche Crew
----------
Why do you play so fast...to be cool
If you think you'll last...you're just fools
You try to be something...that you're not
And all you do is fill our ears...with rot
You claim to play hardcore
Well that's a bunch of shit
You're just a bunch of snot-nosed kids
A real group of tits
You make your bed you lay in
I bet it's made of shit
You think you're all so macho
I bet you all have clits

CHORUS:
You're just a Douche Crew
You're just a Douche Crew
You're just a Douche Crew
You're just a Douche Crew

We offered you our hands
You just turned your backs
You're just a bunch of poser douche-bags
Faggot, dickless, hacks
Wearing all the douchy clothes
They like to watch each other pose
They're all the same so fuckin lame
We shove their spikes up their holes

(CHORUS) - (MOSH PART)
