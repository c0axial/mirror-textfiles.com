THE BURROUGHS FILE: A reference guide to works of William S. Burroughs, 
recordings, film and video appearances, samples, publications, etcetera. 
This project began as an Internet/Usenet FAQ/index of WSB recordings and has 
grown considerably with each revision to expand in scope. Many thanks to Danny 
Iacovou for his help with adding the listing of books by WSB.  

This is Version 3.4, last updated on December 13, 1993. If you're aware of 
any Burroughs works not cited here please email any details, rumors, or

     by ESP-Disk record company of New York City in late 1966 as ESP 1050.

3. Quote
   On Dashiell Hedayat, Obsolete, a 12-inch long-playing album
   released as Shandar SR 10009, Paris, 1971. The short clip of tape
   of WSB appears at the end of the track "Love Song for Zelda"
   on face A and is WSB saying: "I have said the basic techniques
   of novia are very simple: consisting of creating and aggravating
   conflicts. No riots like injustice directed enemies" (12 seconds).
   The tape is thought to have been supplied by Daevid Allen and to
   have originated in the soundtrack of the film Towers Open Fire.

   (This was recently reissued on cd by a label out of Paris called 
   Mantra (MANTRA 075) They actually list WSB as vocals on the song 
   'Long Song for Zelda'  The other artists on the disc are; Daevid

 THE REVISED BOY SCOUT MANUAL    - 3 Cassettes 
     The Boy Scouts cassettes are the source of the article in the 
     RE/search book. The book transcribes 1 cassettes' worth. 
     Subject: Basically a manual detailing how to overthrow a government 
     of your choice.

 INTERVIEW WITH WSB
     There is also a cassette tape put out by The Temple of
     Psychick Youth - "Interview with WSB" - It may be available
     from the US section of TOPY and should be available through 
     the English section.
  
| Cold Spring in UK (a sort of TOPY-affiliated label) released a cassette on 
| the cut-up method with WSB, Brion Gysin, and Genesis P-Orridge, limited to 
| 23 copies. Possibly the same as the TOPY release mentioned above. 
| Contents unknown, but i think it was how-to info from interviews. 

Not necessarily WSB releases but using Burroughs quotes/samples:
================================================================
|
| This is getting to be a tough call, as I haven't even seen or heard many of
| these releases and it's not always clear whether WSB is a major contributer
| or if hew was just sampled from other recordings with or without his permission. 
| But I feel it useful and necessary to separate the major releases under WSB's
| name from the ones that were musical releases using WSB material. With recent
| works such as the collaboration with Cobian and DHoH it becomes harder to define
| what is a major WSB release and what isn't. I'm not going to worry about it too 
| much. If something like Material's & souls really had a very direct WSB involvment
| it still doesn't belong on the WSB release list above unless it was released under
| his name. 

Some listings have the WSB sample/text included. If part of the 
sample was unclear "***" indicates a missed word.

     SOFT MACHINE - TRIPLE ECHO (3-lp box) 1977 
|     "She's Gone" - Version recorded June 1967, appears on Soft Machine's 
|      Triple Echo 3-LP compilation (1977). WSB credited with "Barely audible 
|      aphorism". Another version that may or may not include the WSB sample 
|      appeared on their 1967 Giorgio Gomelsky demos which were later released 
|      as the lp "At The Beginning" and "Jet Propelled Photograph" and "Rock 
|      Generation Volume 8". The band Soft Machine was actually named after 
|      a Burroughs novel, and founding member supposedly played a role in 
|      introducing WSB to Terry Riley and tape loops in the early 60's. Allen 
|      was also respsonsible for the WSB connection to the Dashiel Heydayat 
|      lp using Burroughs tapes. The Soft Machine took their name, with 
|      permission, from the title of a novel by WSB. Band member Daevid Allen 
|      worked with WSB in the early 60's and introduced WSB to Terry Riley. 
|      While WSB was apparently already familiar with tape decks and edits and 
|      experimentation via Brion Gysin during this period, rumor has it that 
|      Riley & Allen introduced Burroughs to tape loops around 1963 when 
|      working with him on a Burroughs production (The Ticket That Exploded?) 
|      while WSB resided at the "Beat Hotel".

       And he said, 'now, I'm the Soul Doctor, and you know, language is a

|      like a few changes made.  Like more carbon dioxide in the
|      atmosphere [***] for their way of life.  You seen this happen before
|      right in the United States.  Your way of life destroyed the Indians
|      way of life.  I'm with the invaders, no use trying to hide that.  And

      INTERFERENCE - unreleased work in progress
      INTERFERENCE is a current (and as-yet unreleased) project that 
      Keith LeBlanc is involved in. Others involved include Doug Wimbish 
      and Skip McDonald, and Tim Simenon (from Bomb the Bass).  
      Possible winter release but doesn't have a record company to carry it yet.
 
      WSB is "on an INTERFERENCE track, he's talking about New World 
      Order and this is ages ago - sixties, from a speech in the sixties.  
      It's got George Bush saying "New World Order" and Burroughs say 
      "What Order? Controlling shit-house of the World.  The White House." 
      It goes on and on, it's really incredible what he's talking
      about and he's saying "we don't just report the news, we
      write it."  He's saying "I've got millions and millions of
      images that I can blast right out and control you gooks
      right down to the molecule."  In other words, television.
      Then at the end he says "I've got orgasms, I've got screams,
      I don't need art, space, what good is it that to me?"  - Keith LeBlanc
 
      SKREW - BURNING IN WATER, DROWNING IN FLAME

      "Sometimes I think some junkie nurse maybe *** on my medication."
 
     KEITH LEBLANC - MAJOR MALFUNCTION
     World Records, WR005CD
     on the track "Major Malfunction"
      "Short time to go.  Minutes...
       Your planet has been invaded.  [not 100% sure this is his voice]
       Listen to my last words [...] world.
       I have not come to explain or tidy up.
       They is right, Mister, whoever is responsible for that whodunnit[?].
       They is right, Mister, whoever is responsible for that.
       I say to all these words are not premature, these words may be too
       late.
       Minutes to go.  Minutes to go.
       Premature reconversion, reconversion blues."

===================
3) Movies & Videos: 
===================

 There are several video tapes of/by WSB available from Mystic Fire Video 
 (in the US, so these would be NTSC, as are most videos mentioned here 
 unless stated otherwise.) 
 
| There were 3 Burroughs/Gysin/Balch film collaborations:

| Towers Open Fire  1964
| Based on drafts for The Soft Machine.  Supposedly available on
| Mystic Fire Video and featuring Gysin and his Dream Machine.

| The Cut Ups  1966
| A short experimental film using cut-up techniques, later cut to
| 12 minutes.  Source film included Guerilla Conditions, an unreleased
| silent documentary about WSB and Gysin in Paris.  Miles reports
| that this film was the source of some of the techniques used
| by Nick Roeg in Performance [aside: the books that appear so
| prominently in Performance are the original Calder hardcover
| editions of Dead Fingers Talk, The Naked Lunch etc.]

| Bill and Tony  1968(?)
| Short film based on a Burroughs text.

| I can find very little documentation about the original film version of
| The Naked Lunch.  Planet R101 has an extract from an early draft of the
| script and its chronology mentions Gysin as collaborating on the film
| scenario in 1969 which would put the release some time in the early
| 1970's.  I seem to remember Factory records putting out a 2 or 3 video
| cassette set of a Burroughs seminar that incorporated footage from The
| Naked Lunch (possibly the whole thing) in about 1984.  I'm pretty sure
| that Cronenberg's book on the making of his version of The Naked Lunch
| (Everything Is Permitted(?)) has a forward by WSB where he mentions the
| earlier version but I don't have a copy.  - Chris Flatters cflatter@nrao.edu

               Contains short movie (approx 14 min) featuring
               W.S. Burroughs.
  
 DRUGSTORE COWBOY - Movie - Cameo appearance by WSB as Junkie
               Priest.  Gus Van Sant film.  Available on Video.
               (also see references to audio releases with Van Sant above)
  
 TWISTER - Movie - Cameo appearance by WSB as gun shooter.
               is available on video and also stars Crispin Glover.
  
| FRIED SHOES, COOKED DIAMONDS
 a film documentary on a gathering at Naropa Institute with all the 
 beat poets and figures of that time including WSB.
  
 There's a video called BURROUGHS that includes an appearance of Burroughs on
 Saturday Night Live and some interviews and footage from some films of his.
 may be the same item as below. 

 William Burroughs <videorecording> 
     Roland Collection, ICA
    Northbrook, Ill. : Roland Collection of Films on Art : ICA
                        Video, <198-?>

 A video of Burroughs's Thanksgiving piece (from Dead City Radio)
 appeared in U2's Zoo TV special, aired on MTV and Fox in 1992.
 | "Thanksgiving" video was directed by Gus van Sant...
 MTV has run a short clip from a video featuring WSB reading.
 Not sure of the source or title, but it may have been "King of the sewers". 
 It was definitely something with sewers. (Could be same as Zoo TV clip?)
 
 Ministry: WSB also appears (speaking and image) on the Ministry
 video, "Just One Fix", the Cold Turkey of the 90s.

 Laurie Anderson's film "Home of the Brave" has WSB dancing with
 Laurie and giving two short recitations.  Also, the film features the
 song "Language is a virus", title taken from WSB.

'Heavy Petting', is a 'movie'/doc featuring lots of old sex education
 clips, and with various actors/artists talking about their sexual
 experiences.  William S Burroughs was one of the people featured.
 The producer and director was "Obie Benz". Also featured Sandra Bernhard, 
 David Byrne, and a lot of other people.

 Burroughs does the narration for the B&W film "Witchcraft Through the
 Ages," (HAXAN), this old & cheesy pseudo-documentary. The video is at least 
 an hour long & W.S.B. does the entire thing. its an old silent film from 1922 
 that was reissued in the sixties with music and WSB as narrater. 
 This has been found for rental at Wherehouse video and Blockbuster!  

 The Subgenius !Arise! video uses extensive cut ups from "Witchcraft 
 Through the Ages".  

 NAKED LUNCH, a film by David Cronenberg, is more a semi-biographical fantasy 
 based on William S. Burroughs life than it is an adaptation of Naked Lunch.
 Soundtrack by Ornette Coleman.

| DECODER - Movie -  video w/ booklet.
|    is a German film with WSB cameos, with vocal also included on soundtrack

 There's a book about Gysin and Burroughs (mainly Gysin, but with lots
 of history and pictures of both) that was published in the UK last year.
 It's called "Man from Nowhere," and is a beautiful book with reminiscenses
 by Paul Bowles, Iggy Pop, Bill Laswell, and many many others.  The book
 was published in a small edition and is extremely hard to find both in the US
 and in England.  It comes with a bunch of postcards with photos of Burroughs 
 and Gysin and reproductions of some of their art.
 
 "The Evening Sun Turned Crimson" by Herbert Huncke - Cherry Valley 
  Editions 1980.  Has some excellent memoirs of his relationships
  with William.  EXPLODED VIEWS BOOKS in L.A. may have a copy of this for 
  sale in their current catalog. It's probably long out of print.

7) Looking for more details:
============================

| I'm working on publishing this file offline as a small zine/guidebook format, 
| DTP'd and pasted up with a few photos, etc.  Does anyone have any WSB images 
| scanned, or can you offer me any? Especially useful if in TIF, PCX or format 
| I can use easily with WordPerfect but we'll ytake what we can get. I'd also 
| welcome pointers to PC or Unix graphics conversion utilities to convert to 
| those for me from GIF or whatever is available.  

| I'd like release dates, lp/cd catalog numbers, ISBN numbers and quote 
| transcriptions from any items that are lacking these kinds of details. Also 
| still always seeking info on any recordings, visuals or publications not 
| already listed here. And answers to any specific queries or rumors below.

 Anyone know anything about an Ornette Coleman collaboration? I heard some     
 reference to this but haven't substantiated it. I know Coleman did the
 soundtrack for Cronenberg's Naked Lunch. I think Coleman is on some of
 the jajouka recordings used on one of the Burroughs cds. Is there some
 other "collaboration I'm unaware of? 

 | There's an Ornette album with about 5 mins of Jajouka music at the end 
 | (which one?), from the same tapes the Brian Jones LP, I think, but different. 
 | This track may have been divided into several short interludes on the Sub 
 | Rosa CD Break Through in Grey Room?  

 I've heard there was a 70's film adaptation of Naked Lunch. Can anyone 
 confirm this?

 Does Throbbing Gristle's _Rafters_ starts with a Burroughs quote?
