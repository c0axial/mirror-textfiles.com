     Valley Elf,
     He's a Valley Elf,
     Valley Elf,
     He's a Valley Elf...

So cool, so fair,
With chartreuse hair,
So young, secure --

  "Fer sure, fer sure,
  like, oh, man, I was really down today,
  like, sooo down,
  I almost flunked archery today,
  I was blitzed totally, it was
  wrong. Like, I wore my elven cloak
  into the dungeon, y'know, and it got all
  grody with, wow, like
  spider webs and green slime all over it,
  like yucko, like
  when I saw it when we got out I thought, oh,
  gag me with a wand,
  it was grody to the max, just psionic, like,
  and I had to clean it, oh,
  gross me out, man.
  Totally awesome. I hate to go in dungeons,
  they are so rank, and some of the monsters just like
  freak me out, man, like, totally
  disgusting, barf city man, it was so gross
  that I thought, like, Hey, keep away from me, man!
  Like no way I'm gonna ever even use my sword
  on you, I just waxed it, y'know, like
  gag me with a mace."

     Valley Elf,
     He's a Valley Elf,
     Valley Elf,
     He's a Valley Elf...

North of Geoff, South of Ket,
By the River Javan wet,
Living with the stubby gnomes,
The Valley Elves do make their homes.

  "Sure, totally, y'know, I had a dog, man,
  a cooshee, like he was special,
  a Gucci cooshee poochie,
  he had designer genes, like, really rare,
  he was just awesome, but not too housebroken.
  I had to clean up after him, and that was like grody,
  just gross to the max, but, wow,
  like, no biggie, cuz he was my
  dog, y'know, but he's gone now, totally, see,
  I met the mage the other day, and, wow, man,
  the mage has got like no,
  totally no sense of humor. Like, I made a joke,
  y'know, I thought it was super,
  like, I saw the mage and said like, hey,
  we're in the Valley of the Jolly,
  like, Ho Ho Ho, Green Valley Mage,
  just like the freakin' commercials,
  but he just looked at me, like wow,
  he must have really been out of it, man,
  like he was so out of it he threw
  one of those, like, meteor swarms at me, it was just
  awesome, I mean it was just, oh wow man, it was
  astral, and it missed me and hit my dog,
  my designer dog, like,
  crispy critter city,
  I was really bummed out, really bad like."

     Valley Elf,
     He's just a Valley Elf,
     Valley Elf,
     He's just a Valley Elf...

He's a super Valley Elf,
So chaotic, sure of self,
Tall and thin and fair of face,
His brain is lost in outer space.

  "Oh, super, like I live in the
  good part of the Valley,
  y'know, where we're all into, like,
  real ethereal things, like
  I got a set of designer ring mail
  for my birthday, I was totally
  freaked out, like, my old set was getting
  full of wrinkles and it had
  blood on it from where I cut myself
  with my short sword, yeah, really, like
  agony, man. I was in total agony
  for an hour. Really,
  but now I'm together, like,
  fer sure, no problem.
  That was close, man,
  like I was so sure I was gonna
  pass out fer sure,
  I lucked totally.
  Good thing."
