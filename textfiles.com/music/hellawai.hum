S L A Y E R  -  HELL AWAITS
===========================

Hell Awaits
-----------
Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown

Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord

CHORUS:
The gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul cannot be saved

Crucify the so-called Lord, he soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned, your god has fell
To slave for me eternally
          Hell awaits...

The reaper guards the darkened gates
That Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where
The dead are free to roam

Lonely children of the night
There's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
That Lucifer controls

Priest of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies screaming souls cry out to you
Satanic laws prevail, your life is through

Pray to the moon...when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
What you seek...for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground

[LEAD-- Hanneman]

Now I have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
The seven bloody gates of Hell
Is where you'll live your last

Warriors from Hell's domain
Will bring you to your death
The flames of Hades burning strong
Your soul shall never rest

(CHORUS)

Sacrifice the lives of all I know, they soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in hell
And keep the fire growing deep inside
          Hell awaits...

[LEAD-- King]

Kill Again
----------
Lurking in the dismal fog
Hungry for your blood
Seeking harmless victims
Satisfy my needs

Schizophrenic lunatic
Uncontrolled desire
Rape and ravage lady fair
Pledged to die

CHORUS:
No apparent motive
Just kill and kill again
Survive my brutal thrashing
I'll hunt you till the end
My life's a constant battle
The rage of many men
Homicidal maniac

Trapped in mortal solitude
Lift the gleaming blade
Slice her flesh to shreds
Watch the blood flow free

Hatred growing stronger
None survive my wrath
Suffer from the throbbing pain
Yield your life to me

(CHORUS)

[LEAD-- Hanneman, King, Hanneman, King]

Kill the preacher's only son
Watch the infant die
Bodily dismemberment
Drink the purest blood

Unrelenting need to kill
Death upon you now
Anxiously awaiting
Next in line

(CHORUS)

At Dawn They Sleep
------------------
Awakened I have become
Light now slips away
Manipulate your mind
Darkness is my slave

Taste the sins of Hell
The blood that I so crave
The last thing that you see
Is the hunger in my eyes

CHORUS:
Blood sucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight
Apparition from the pits of Hell
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell
Demented lust, secrets they must keep
Addicted to your blood
At dawn they sleep

Unvail the hidden coffin
Lift the lid of terror
Feel the deadly cold
Freeze you from inside

Perceiving your intentions
To slay the phantom form
Raise the stake in malice
You cannot plunge it down

(CHORUS)

[LEAD-- King, Hanneman]

Beware the image unseen
Stocks your soul
Your corpse's redeem

Eternal damnation your just reward
A servant of our lord
By your accord

Admonish of cruciform
Impalement
Immortality's scorned

Rise hold fast your faith
To lie dormant
Is certain death

Emerging from their hellish tomb
Taking flight amidst the night
The evening skies are raining death

Swooping down from shadowed skies
Taking simple human form
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man

Lock their jaws into your veins
Satanic soldiers strike their prey
Leaving corpses waiting for the change

Blood dripping from the jaws of death
Not enough to satisfy
They must drain your soul of life

Praise of Death
---------------
Deceased in mind decree of death
Blackened heart baptized in fire
Exertion now need to blitz
Vicious ways brought up in Hell

Draw the line life or death
Potent thrust excessive pain
Massive dose adrenalin
Minor threat cannot decline

CHORUS:
Stricken to live, Hell on earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of death life's a dream
We're only living to die

Victim of life insanity lives
Deep in shock intensive care
Tables turned blast of strength
Kill at once time to prevail

Begin to crank feel the rush
Start to rage take to extremes
Push to far overkill
Time to die no way to win

(CHORUS)

[LEAD-- King]

Running and hunting and slashing
And crushing and searching
And seeing and stabbing and shooting
And thrashing and smashing and
Burning destroying and killing
And bleeding and pleading then death

[LEAD-- King, Hanneman, King, Hanneman, King, Hanneman]

At mach ten velocity
Pressure builds can't take the strain
Life blood flows to its grave
Dripping sweat, death shall erase

Time to think time to breathe
Feel the pulse life will expire
Surging speed hell afast
Cardiac cease to exist

(CHORUS)

[LEAD-- King]

Necrophiliac
------------
Mortuaries dead of night
My body starts to rise
In my mind the horror lives
To feel death deep inside

Relentless lust of rotting flesh
To thrash the tomb she lies
Heathen whore of Satan's wrath
I spit at your demise

Virgin child now drained of life
Your soul cannot be free
Not given the chance to rot in Hell

Satan's cross points to Hell
The earth I must uncover
A passion grows to feast upon
The frozen blood inside her

I feel the urge the growing need
To fuck this sinful corpse
My tasks complete the bitches soul
Lies raped in demonic lust

[LEAD-- King]

Her stomach burst the casket breaks
The seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh
The Devil's child is thrown

Hungry for the smell of death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred
The bastard now must die

Lost souls of the dead
Form legions that burst through Hell's gates
Death of one sacrifice
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man
The fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust
Lucifer takes my dark soul

Down to the fiery pits of Hell

[LEAD-- Hanneman]

Crypts of Eternity
------------------

[LEAD-- Hanneman]

Devious to those unknown
He walks below the land
Alluring victims to their death
Perish to the sand

Master of the blackened arts
Living his decree
Thrives amongst the seven gates
Searching for the keys

CHORUS:
I have seen the darkened depths of Hell
Sorcery beyond the witches spell
Robbed the crypts of death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

Chants of evil incantation
Fill the murky night
Free the Devil's knights of Hell
Unleash their growing spite

Directing power forcibly
The fire of Hell is cast
Resurrect from crypts of death
A demon from the past

(CHORUS)

[LEAD-- Hanneman, King]

Cringe with fear
Violate the unbroken seal of Hell
Death will come searching for
Your mere soul
Still you are eager to seek your fate
All that lie here are remains
Of death

Grinding bones, screaming skulls
Broken by the lapse of time
Decade to power, ashes to dust
Diminishing, disintegrating
Man's souls and mind

[LEAD-- Hanneman]

Empty space tracks throughout
I make my claim

[LEAD-- King]

Darkness covers the world
My kingdom, my domain

Hardening of the Arteries
-------------------------
Fear runs wild in the veins of the world
The hate turns the skies jet black
Death is assured in future plans
Why live if there's nothing there

Spectres of doom await the moment
The mallet is sure and precise
Cover the crypts of all mankind
With cloven hoove begone

CHORUS:
Sadistic minds
Delay the death
Of twisted life
Malicious world

The crippled youth try in dismay
To sabotage the carcass earth
All new life must perish below
Existence now is futile

Decrepit breath, vile in its stench
A world in decay
Transgressor is as one

(CHORUS)

[LEAD-- King, Hanneman]

Convulsions take the world in hand
Paralysis destroys
Nobody out there to take us
Brutal seizure now we die

(CHORUS)
