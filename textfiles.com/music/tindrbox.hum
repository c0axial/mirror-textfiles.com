                 (Typed in by Lord Edward on August 22, 1986)


CANDYMAN

    Sickly sweet, his poison seeks
    For the yound ones who don't understand
    The danger in his hands
    With a jaundiced wink see his cunning slink
    Oh trust in me my pretty one
    Come walk with me my helpless one

    Candyman

    Syrup lies  upon your tongue
    GE Latine salive spills
    The flash of a guillotine a smile

    Candyman -- oh candyman

    No pity for him, their misery screams
    Unspeakable things

    A cool missile, yes it's in his smile
    With open arms to welcome you
    Beware the masked pretender
    He always lies, this candyman
    Those lips conspire in treachery
    To strike in cloak and dagger, see!

    Candyman -- oh candyman

    And all the children, he warns "Don't tell,"
    Those threats are sold
    With their guilt and shame  they think they're to blame
    For candyman -- oh candyman


THE SWEETEST CHILL

    Hearing you -- in my sleep
    Feeling you -- your cadence seeps
    Whispering in flashback -- the spectres of your memories
    Fall in glistening showers -- such a tender descent
    Intones this haunting lament

    The sweetest chill

    Fearing you -- but calling your name
    Icy breath -- encases my skin
    Fingers like a fountain of needles
    Shiver along my spine
    And rain down so divine

    The sweetest chill

    A drowning so sublime -- spins in a heavenly climb

    Calling you -- tears thaw my sleep
    Wanting you -- this hoary web is weaved
    From this strange confusion
    Grows a perverse communication
    It enthralls me and coils me around

    The sweetest chill

    Enchantment ebbs and whirls -- the sweetest chill
    Enchantment ebbs and whirls -- oh the thrill
    The sweetest chill


THIS UNREST

    This unrest beats out my breath
    Disconnected thoughts jangle in a mess

    This unrest crucifies my chest
    Without anaesthetic it cuts
    Through tumorous flesh

    This unrest beats out my breath.......

    This unrest beats in my chest
    Discordant limbs watch unimpressed
    At the aimless walk the mindless talk
    The pictures leap out and dance for me
    They laugh at me

    As your bitterness closes in
    You're feeling very old again
    Ah just to sleep, without these thoughts
    But the angels shout, resurrecting doubts

    Ah we meet again, my trusty friend
    Demanding new favours for old times sake
    Inside this captive frame
    Come and claim your liberty

    Metal and flesh will fuse today
    These visions jump out and blast my days
    Clean away.......


CITIES IN DUST

    Water was running; children were running
    You were running out of time
    Under the mountain, a golden fountain
    Were you praying at the lares shrine?

    But oh your city lies in dust, my friend

    We found you hiding -- we found you lying
    Choking on the dirt and sand
    Your former glories and all the stories
    Dragged and washed with eager hands

    But oh your city lies in dust, my friend

    Hot and burning -- in your nostrils
    Pouring down your gaping mouth
    Your molten bodies -- blanket of cinders
    Caught in the throes.......

    And your city lies in dust


CANNONS

    Troubled weather's on its way
    Tempests threaten us today
    There's no respite, from long dark nights
    Just the fantasy of spring

    From the hailstones of summer
    To a scorching winter land
    A frozen death sleep, then this heat
    Beats down on this buckled land

    Flames lick closer to the core
    From city limits fireball
    And in a headless chicken run
    Race red and screaming fire engines
    The the cannons came

    'Neath the brooding sky
    Beneath its baleful eye
    The cannon shot, the cannon crack
    Disturbing night dreams

    People fled in droves
    To the lakes and to the shores
    Left behind a near ghost town
    Save the life of the cannons resounding
    Still there was no rain

    Once more in the line of fire
    Hovers the preying sky
    The cannons aim jabs at the eye
    Heralding the rain.....


PARTY'S FALL

    Your parties fall around you
    Another night beckons to you
    Your parties fall around you
    Another night beckons to you

    Shadows loom as you resist the gloom
    Faded hues issue forth and bloom

    A bed of leaves for a lover
    Awake with a kiss and rise asunder
    And when the party's over
    You retreat in a realm of slumber

    In your mind, crystal lights rebound
    Wheels spin round and you hear the sound
    Of autumn's call at party's fall

    Through rose-tinted glass you still remember
    The gladness, not sadness, only laughter

    In your mind vicious lights rebound
    Wheels spin round and you hear the sound
    Of autumn's call at party's fall

    The smile in the mirror grows weaker
    The laughter you heard is growing fainter

    Your parties fall around you
    The night forgets to rouse you
    Your party's fall astounds you
    An aura of sadness abounds you

    Glad rags sigh
    Maybe you're alone inside, don't hide
    Hurting all the time, hurting deep inside, don't cry
    My happiness depends on knowing this friend is never alone
    On your own
    A party on our own
    We'll have a party all our own inside
    No sighs


92 DEGREES

    The day drags by like a wounded animal
    The approaching disease, 92 degrees
    The blood in our veins and the brains in our head
    The approaching unease, 92 degrees

    Long ago in the headlines, they noticed it too
    But too late for the loved ones and nearly for you.....

    Shaky lines -- on the horizon
    Snakey thoughts -- invade each person
    Watch the red line -- creeping upwards
    Watch the sanity line weaken
    The volcanic depths of Hades' ocean
    Bubble under, these crazed eruptions
    It wriggles and wrythes and bites within,
    Just below the sweating skin

    I wondered when this would happen again
    Now I watch the red line, reach that number again
    The blood in our veins and the brains in our head......

    Drink the water with jagged glass
    Eat the cactus with bleeding mouth
    Not 91 or 93, but 92 Fahrenheit degrees

    Shaky lines -- on the horizon
    Snakey thoughts -- invade each person
    Not 91 or 93, but 92 Fahrenheit degrees


LANDS END

    Come take this hand at twilight's door
    I'll meet you there, we'll share the moonlit floor
    Through the driving rain, colours run in veins
    Ozone fills the  air, two figures disappear

    Come let's take flight, let's quit this scene tonight
    Whilst they sleep on endless, in their wrecked designs
    Sleep on endless in your wrecked designs

    Moths touched by flame repeat their fatal game
    Forever and eternally, the cliffs around the crashing sea
    Unsolved and endless, wait for me

    Undulating far below, where lucid waters flow
    Their faces seem to know........

    Where the land falls to an end
    This hidden tale begins
    Take a walk with me, down by the sea
    Take a walk with me
    Down by the sea
