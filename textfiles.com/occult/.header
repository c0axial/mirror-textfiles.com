<P>
One of the groups that really grabbed a hold of the BBS world and held on for
dear life were folks who had a different view of organized religion. BBSes 
immediately provided them with a place to discuss, organize, and put up 
doctrines. You could find massive libraries of doctines online, in fact; a BBS
could be set up for a specific religion, encourage discussions, get new converts,
the whole deal. This was popular with all sorts of religions, although of
course it set up a nice easy target if the religion was inherently judgemental.
<P>
Another side of this coin were parody or joke religions, who found it easy to
creative large amounts of lore and meaningless parables and rules that would
almost seem real, if it weren't for the bad spelling and wanton profanity.
Some of these, like the Church of the Subgenius, were both publishing
phenomenons and online scions. It was all very silly.
<P>
This section is a little hard to sort, because it's very hard to tell what
documents belong to what line of thought, and, even worse, some lines of
thought have split down even further to two or more branches that hate each
other. But I'll do my best. Please be sure to write in if things are completely
missorted.
