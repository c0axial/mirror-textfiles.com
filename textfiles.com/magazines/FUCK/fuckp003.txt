        "I am not in this world to live up to your expectations,
         and you are not in this world to live up to mine.
         You are you, and I am I..."    - Frederick Perfs

        I was so young when I first read that. Always kept it in
        the back of my mind. Don't know what made me remember
        it this time, just that in editing a zine of any nature,
        it is a wise lesson to be remembered. Poetry is a subjective
        medium, one that has no real basis for determining value
        or talent. Always keep this in mind when reviewing
        works of poetry, for it helps keep perspective on the
        overall experience.

        Fluttering Ideas

        Ideas flutter through my mind,
        as the conversation goes on around me.
        I wonder many things, and wish nothing.
        Noticing none of them, wonder,
         why it is, that I am so quiet, today.
         Probably better that way.

        Pictures of the way things use to be,
        find their way to my line of vision,
        I look through them,
        trying to get to the end.

        Not wanting to remember most of them,
        and wishing the others did not happen.
        Then I find one, that I wish I could live again.
        
        Flipping from the pictures,
        are memories that are found,
        deep inside my mind.
        I wonder why, things happened the way they did,
        and ask myself "Who was it that I used to be?".

        Shaking my head,
        I do not want all that pressure, again...
        but, here I find myself,
        so close to where I dropped the quarter.
        
        Wanting nothing else,
        but a simple happiness,
        knowing nothing else,
        except hardship.
        
        Wishing nothing, wanting things,
        needing only a few ...
        I cannot help but wonder,
        where I am now,
        and where I will be tomorrow.
        
        Ideas flutter through my mind ...

        Brian can't come out to play,
        he got a nasty bruise today.
        "Don't run in the house," I always say.
        Ask again another day.

        Brian can't come out to play,
        He really burned his hand today.
        "Don't play with matches," I always say.
        Ask again another day.

        Brian can't come out to play,
        Because he broke his arm today.
        "Don't horse around," I always say.
        Ask again some other day. . . .

        her eyes reached out to me
        picked me up and spun me about
        a cursory examination to size me up

        something's wrong, the eyes glaze over
        her demeanor changes once again
        the firm grasp over me tightens
        drains my will before my strength

        confusion on the wings of despair
        Ride comfortable into the night
        like an old enchanting melody
        Cradling the words against my ear
        The wind on the lips like a touch
        or perhaps a breath reminders that 
        i'm still alive. 

        I dive mercilessly into the air,
        finding comfort in the dark, 
        shading my eyes from the light
        Veins throbbing with fright
        Aching to explore uncharted 
        arrays of the sky but the
        grasp still holds tight.
        A bird trapped by five fingers
        and two feet. 
        Struggling to to be free....
        and yet submissive to the familiar 
        clutch. Fighting fruitlessly ,
        squirming , yearning...but alas no avail
        For night is my master, and i forever 
        its slave....

        do you remember the way the sun set upon your face like a pale rose.
        or the song the angels sung as they kissed your cheek and made the
        apparitions vanish into night.
        the things that made you well, the things that cured your pain.
        and the only thing that scares me is the truth.
        and the only thing i've found is the truth.
        what irrational thoughts have become my salvation.
        and what irrational deeds have become my salvation.
        the next time you hear a scream upon my watch,
         shout to the gods "this thing you have made was not fit for life."
