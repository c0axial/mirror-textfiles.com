                why are fucked up ? because we are slaves!
                ------------------------------------------

In 638, Palestine fell to the Arabs. 457 years later, in 1095, the First
Crusade was launched by the Vatican to capture the Holy Land (Palestine)!
They failed, but in 1492, Columbus set sail for India to gain enough wealth
for the capture of Jerusalem. He failed and the Protestant Revolution
occurred. Britain inherited Columbus's objectives (i.e. India, East India
Company, etc). 425 years later, in 1917 during the World War 1, the
Protestant Church of England British Empire colonised Palestine, when
General Allenby declared: `Today the Crusades have ended'.  In 1948,
the real power behind the Church and Empire took over Palestine.
     
Naval Crusade
In the 15th century, Europeans began making oceanic voyages of discovery.
What is remarkable is that they ever started at all, soon after the Black
Death in which one-third of the population died. Very quickly, these
voyages led to the outright economic and political domination of the whole
world.
     
Why were Europeans the only ones to discover and conquer the world, even
though the Church had lied to them, that the earth was flat and if anyone
sailed too far, they would fall into Hell ? They were not only
inward-looking, illiterate and misguided but oppressed by the Church by
being victims themselves to Inquisitions, Witch-hunts and charges of
heresies. How is it possible for a society with such characteristics to
even dream about discovering, AND conquering the World ? 
     
The fact is, the very institution that misguided its followers, also sent
them on another Crusade - a NAVAL Crusade in the guise of explorers and
traders.
     
Just over 500 years have elapsed since the beginning of European encroachment 
into the Old (Africa and India) and New World (Americas). The origins of 
colonialism, racism, capitalism (stealing and exploitation), globalisation, 
slavery (free labour) and 'Business Administration' can be traced back to
1455 when the Pope put out an announcement (`papal bull') authorising
Catholics to "reduce to servitude all infidel people". In 1457, the Council
of Cardinals met in Holland where they sanctioned, as a righteous and
progressive idea, the enslavement of black Africans for the purpose of
their conversion to Christianity and to be exploited in the labour market
as chattel property. This scheme gained the sanctimonious blessing of the
Pope and became a standard policy of the Vatican, and later of Protestant
churches. [3].

A bull of Pope Nicholas 5th instructed his followers to `attack, subject,
and reduce to perpetual slavery the Pagans and other enemies of Christ'
[pg. 31, 56].  Two nations actively took up the bidding of the Vatican:
     
1. SPAIN. In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed to the WEST.
     
2. PORTUGAL - In 1497, Vasco da Gama sailed to the EAST.
     
Many people assume that the primary reason for these events was economics.
HIS story books openly talk of the evils of slavery, racism, economic
exploitation, etc but this has been done to conceal the truth. For example,
only by World War 2, when the British empire was in terminal decline, did
trade between Britain and its colonies reach a peak of 35% of all British
trade.  So much for imperialism being the handmaid of mercantilist
capitalism [98].

Prior to secularism, religion played a dominant role in all civilisations : 
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Indians, etc.  The
concept of secularism is approximately 200 years old.  It is more appropriate
to interpret historical events using the religious reference frame, and not
the secular or economic reference frame.
     
SPAIN
Spain had been under Moorish rule since 711.  However, since the beginning
of the Crusades, the Moors had been losing territory in quick succession.
Having launched Inquisitions in France and Italy, the Church extended it
to Spain in 1481 to kill or forcibly convert the Moors.  On 2nd January,
1492, the last Moorish foothold in Spain, Granada was finally overrun.
     
The Spanish monarchy then appointed Columbus `to go by way of the WEST to 
INDIA'.  He set sail in the name of the Trinity from the harbour of Palos
on 3rd August, 1492.  He sailed down the West coast of Africa to some
outlying islands, then straight across the Atlantic Ocean.
     
On the very first page of his diary, Columbus states his objectives: 'go
to the lands of India to meet the Great Khan, who like his predecessors,
had many times appealed to Rome to instruct him in Christianity; to combat
the religion of the Moors and all idolatries and heresies; see the towns
and lands and their distribution, and find out in what manner they might be
converted to Christianity'.  He also wrote that he intends to find gold,
spices and everything in such quantity, for all the wealth gained in the
enterprise, within three years, should be spent by Spain on the conquest
of Jerusalem [12].
     
Eight months later, Columbus discovered the West Indies (San Salvador) [13].  
Various writers have pointed out, of West African and Moorish traders in the 
Americas prior to the Europeans [2 & 3] (very likely as they were not 
handicapped by their religion about the world being 'flat').  It is also 
probable that the aim of the Spanish Conquistadors was to take over Atlantic 
trade routes and anhilate any native American who had been in contact with 
non-Europeans.  
     
By 1500, a number of royal marriages took place linking the Spanish monarchy
and conquests with that of Hapsburg possessions in Austria, Germany and
Holland. Spain became a global empire, stretching from Vienna to Peru!
Charles 5th, who held more than 60 royal titles declared: `in my realm the
sun never sets'.  The Church which often arranged these royal marriages
began to think a universal Christian empire had at last been achieved.
[Pg. 30, 1].
     
PORTUGAL
The destruction of Spain was planned, to ensure that Moors from Africa
could not assist their co-religionists in Spain.  With two year's
preparation and a papal bull, a Crusade was launched in 1415 against Ceuta,
a Moorish stronghold and trading centre on the African side opposite to
Gibraltar.  A Portuguese Armada, well armed and armoured, and supported
by a contingent of English archers overwhelmed Ceuta within a day. [ref]
     
The Portuguese set out with the intention of uniting the Christian forces
of Europe with those of Africa, namely Ethiopia in an all out war against
the Moors and make their statelet into a vast African-Indian empire,
stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and bigger than
the continent of Europe.  To achieve this the Church had given the Portuguese
organisational skills and uninhibited unagressivness to go forth to conquer
and dominate. [40].

The early Portuguese were not traders or private adventurers, but admirals
with a royal commission to conquer territory and promote the spread of
Christianity. [Pg. 404, 25].
     
In July, 1497, Vasco Da Gama set sail from Lisbon. The Portuguese who sailed 
with Da Gama were men of the Catholic renaissance and their successors were 
under the influence of the Counter-Reformation. Culture and religion for them 
were inextricably mixed [15].  Unlike previous Portuguese expeditions, Da
Gama continued sailing further down the West coast of Africa, round the
southern tip of Africa and north along the East African coast.  With the
help of a pilot borrowed from Kenya, Da Gama entered the Indian Ocean
[Pg.81, 24]. Da Gama arrived at Calicut in 1498.  From the first, Da Gama
encountered hostility from the Moors, Arabs and Africans. Da Gama told the
first Indians he met on the Malabar coast that he had come to seek
`Christians and spices'.
     
A second expedition, under the command of Cabral was despatched in 1500. 
The sum of his instructions was to begin with preaching, and, if that 
failed, to proceed to the sharp determination of the sword.  On reaching 
Calicat, Cabral established factories in face of active hostility. 
     
In 1502 the king of Portugal obtained from Pope Alexander 6th, a bull making
him `lord of navigation, conquest, and trade of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and
India'.  In that year Da Gama sailed again to the East, where off the coast
of India, he committed the most frightful act of his career.  His fleet
overtook a pilgrim ship laden with men, women and children - and, after
seizing the treasure it carried, Da Gama set fire and allowed it to burn
with all its passengers still aboard.  On loading his ships with spices
from various ports on the Indian coast, he set sail for home in February
1503, leaving behind him a trail of blood and destruction. In 1524, he was
appointed viceroy to India [pg. 49, 64].

Having (ab)USED Spain and Portugal to establish strategic bases and forts in
the Americas, Africa, India and South East Asia, skilled and educated
Europeans were then needed to hold and expand the frontiers of newly
acquired territories and `administer' the resources in these lands, on a
scale never seen in history, to ensure the social, economic, political,
technological, military and spiritual domination of the world by those
who ran the Church.

PROTESTANTISM
To achieve this, the Church created, financed and organised a New Order, in 
which a religious reformation, a scientific and economic revolution, 
simultaneously took place, namely Protestantism, modern science and
capitalism respectively.  
     
Protestantism began in 1517 by a German Catholic cleric named Martin Luther. 
     
Scientifically speaking, the sixteenth century saw the publication of many 
pieces of astronomical works by Protestants / Lutherans.  The Church
responded with the Opening of the Council of Trent in 1545 and the
Counter-Reformation. In 1582, Pope Gregory 13th replaced the Julian
Calendar with the more accurate Gregorian Calendar.  Astronomy was the
Mother of Discoveries for a Religious, Scientific and Technological
Revolution.  The invention of the telescope enabled naval crusaders to
determine their position at sea using stars.  The theological assumption
that the earth was at the centre of the universe was replaced with
the notion that the Sun was at the centre and central point in planetary
motion The mathematical relationship and cosmic mechanical regularity of
celestial orbits was replicated in the development of machines.  No
technological revolution could have ocurred if Europeans continued to
believe the sun rotated around the earth [50].
     
This New Order saw the displacement of Catholic Spain and Portugal by
Protestant Britain, Holland (Erasmus), Germany, etc.  For example, the
Dutch empire expanded at Portuguese expense [32].  Britain expanded at
Spanish expense e.g. Francis Drake spent a lifetime destroying and
plundering Spanish ships, wreaking havoc with Spain's overseas empire
destroying Spanish morale and credit.  Closer to home he stormed Cadiz in
1587 destroying thousands of tons of shipping and supplies destined for
the Spanish Armada [pg. 16, 103].
     
However, the foreign policy of the `enlightened and progressive' Protestants
was exactly the same as the Catholics, namely the slavery, genocide, theft, 
Christianisation of non-white, non-Western, non-Christian people, but at 
increased levels of magnitude and efficiency.
     
Now, educated Europeans could design and build machines, fight wars using 
mechanised armaments, obey complex orders given by factory managers and
military leaders; seize and `cultivate' resources including people
(slavery-application of European serfdom overseas); land and commodities
(colonialism), and distribute them around the world as inputs to the
factories of the Industrial Revolution or as finished products to the
colonies.  The globalisation of trade in `stolen goods' was sanitised by
the term, Capitalism.  The trade was financed by the largest owners of
capital, namely the Church, and underpinned by Usury, sanitised by the
term, Interest.  Catholics were taught that indulging in usury was akin to
sodomy but the Protestant order was taught no such thing, thereby
enabling its quick global implemention, causing so much misery for the
masses today.  Little wonder that the capitalistic theories of Adam Smith
are still popular under neo-colonialism.  The phenomenal economic success
that followed was attributed to the `Protestant Work Ethic' but really there
was nothing ethical about contravening two of the Ten Commandments: Thou
Shalt not Steal and Thou Shalt not Kill. 
     
Luther's ideas and books rapidly penetrated English universities, the City of 
London and Royalty [9].  When King Henry 8th broke away from the Church 
allegedly, he started building Britain's first Navy.  The British Empire was 
built on Naval power - enabling an island to rule one-quarter of the world.
The resources that Columbus sought to capture Jerusalem was provided by
India. India was the ENGINE of the Empire providing manpower and materials
for the Mother Country.  The two million man British Indian Army was the
largest all-volunteer army ever created in the history of mankind. 40% of
the Raj's income went on this army. 
     
In 1914, under the guise of Nationalism, World War 1 broke out, in which the 
British Empire fought Germany, notwithstanding that for over four hundreds
years they had been theological (PROTESTANT), military and political allies
i.e. British tommies were conscripted and brainwashed into fighting Germany
for `king and country', even though since 1714, the monarch was of German
descent, namely the House of Hanover.  Similarly, the German monarch was
Queen Victoria's grandson - Kaiser Wilhelm 2nd. Stranger things were to
follow.  The Ottomans - an Oriental power joined the European conflict
siding with Germany, thereby giving Britain the justification to attack
Ottoman territory, that just so happened to include Palestine.  
     
The best resources and personnel were deployed on the Eastern Front (Middle 
East) e.g. General Allenby, T.E. Lawrence who had a degree from Oxford in 
military history whilst the donkeys were deployed on the Western Front
(Somme, Passendale) e.g. General Haig, etc.  Western Europe saw 'trench
warfare' whilst the East saw rapid flanking attacks to capture massive
amounts of Ottoman territory. 
     
One of the LAST countries colonised by Britain was Palestine in 1917, when
the British Army General entered Jerusalem declaring: `Today the Crusades
have ended' [pg. 7, 48] - the JEWEL in the Crown.  The never forgotten
objective of the Church had finally been achieved, though the cost in lives
on the Western Front was horrendous.  Soon after, the British Empire started
to 'unravel' when a half-naked Indian (Ghandi whose father a Christian!)
'took on' the Empire and demanded Independence. Palestine had been colonised
allegedly to protect the trade route to India! Britain had been set up!
     
1917 also saw the Bolshevik Revolution and the withdrawal of an ally, Russia.  
America, having recently left the cowboy age for the age of mass production 
conveniently intervened when things were looking bleak for the Allies.  When
the War ended, the Great Depression followed which deeply affected Britain,
even though it had acquired more territory than before and had a market share
of one-quarter of humanity. Capitalism does not work! Germany became bankrupt
and demoralised.  The Germans being the most intellectual of Europeans (see
remarkable recovery from both world wars) realised how they had been (ab)used 
and sought revenge ('The Final Solution').  In 1939, World War 2 broke out,
and again the British Empire fought Germany.  Within just 30 years of
capturing Palestine, the Empire that claimed `the sun never set in its
realm' had come to an abrupt end living on rations, open to
counter-colonialism and a colony of its former colony, America.  No such
large empire ever sank so quickly [pg. xiv, 46].   
     
In the second half of the 20th century, it is America's turn to be ab(USED)
to support the occupation of Palestine and oppress and exploit the rest of
the world via its multi-nationals, and its abuse of the UN, etc.
     
SECULARISM
Europeans made striking technological, industrial and military advances to  
dominate the World, by studying all known subjects.  Having taught these
skills, the last thing the Church wanted was for educated Europeans to study
the most important subject - RELIGION. 
     
If Europeans should study religion, they would discover the TRUTH, because
they would research its origins, history and development (and the CHURCH).
So the concept of SECULARISM was introduced, i.e. the separation of religion
from all aspects of life.  The justification for secularism was that
Christianity had kept mankind 'backwards'. This is a lie because: 
     
1. The greatest intellectual and technological progress that ever took
place in Europe was during the rise of Protestantism AND at former centres
of Christian theology e.g. Cambridge and Oxford Universities, whose colleges
have religious names: All Souls, Christ Church, Corpus Christi, Jesus,
Magdalen, St. John, Trinity; or named after the clerics who financed their
construction such as Brasenose, Keble, Merton, Pembroke, Selwyn. Emmanuel
College was built in 1584 by the strong Puritan adviser to Queen Elizabeth
1st, Walter Mildmay. [9&18].
     
2. Protestants / Puritans / Lutherans accounted for a disproportionate
number of academics and scientists at Europe's major centres of education
[Pg 46-49, 43]. The scientists who played the most crucial role in aiding
Europe's intellectual advancement were Protestants / Lutherans such as
Copernicus, Tycho Brahe and Johann Kepler; and so were their keenest
supporters (financial backers, printers, publishers, etc) [43 & 50].
     
3. Although millions of witches and heretics were killed, there is no
recorded incident of a scientist ever being martryred, killed or burned at
the stake for pronouncing views that were against Church doctrine
[Pg.39, 50]. Persecution of Luther, Galileo, etc merely ensured widespread
publicity and propogation of new religious and scientific ideas and views
throughout Europe to change the old illiterate and superstitious order.
     
4. If Christianity was so regressive, why impose it on the natives ? By
teaching natives superstitious beliefs about Santa, Easter eggs,
cannibalism i.e. bread and wine being the flesh and blood of Christ,
Trinity i.e. Christ being God and son of God simultaneously, etc was a sure
way of making them backwards.  Thus the age of secularism was the greatest
age of Christian conversions in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, which were
targeted as fields ripe for harvesting; missionary enthusiasm was an
enormous reinforcement to imperialism [pg. 313-314, 41].  
     
In the New Secular Order, two large Gothic Cathedrals were built i.e. the
House of Lords (for the 1000 or so unelected clergy, royalty, peers, etc)
and House of Commons (650 MPs for the commoners) and a replica of St.Peter's
Basilica i.e. 'White House', from where Democracy could be practised i.e.
'freely' and 'democratically-elected' 'secular' Western governments, could
continue to support the occupation of Palestine in the 20th Century i.e.
same old foreign policy and objective of the Vatican from the Dark Ages.
     
Whatever the Orders: Catholicism, Renaissance, Protestantism, Colonialism, 
Capitalism, Secularism, Democracy, Nationalism, Communism, Cold War, New
World Order, etc it is still the same Old Order to occupy Palestine at all
costs.
