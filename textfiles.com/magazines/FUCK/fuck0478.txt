		       The Public Transportation Failure
                      ---------------------------------

"Take public transportation and save the environment," scream the
tree-hugging hippies. The streets in San Francisco are a fucking nightmare
to drive on, and seven of the ten most-busiest freeways in the world are
in Los Angeles, according to press reports. Neither city has any parking
to speak of.

I recently got my drivers license back after several years of not having
one (I didn't have a car, so why bother) and bought a new car. I went
through all of this because of public transportation. Now, in San Francisco,
we have BART, an acronym for Bay Area Rapid Transit, which is a sort of
subway train system that runs from 6:00 a.m. until Midnight, and runs the
majority of the greater Bay Area. But, what do you do when you want to go
clubbing, and the trains stop at Midnight? Shit, you usually don't even
get there until Midnight. Then there are the areas BART doesn't serve,
because the tree-hugging hippies complain about the environmental damage
it causes. Aren't these the same idiots that are screaming for us to use
public transportation? Then we had the strike, which shut down BART and
left me stranded fifty miles from the airport just prior to a flight. That
was one very expensive cab ride; if you can get a cab in San Francisco.

The bus system is a joke, with three different and competing transit
systems which all cross paths, but rarely connect to one another. Unless
you live near one line that also happens to take you directly to your
destination, forget about taking the bus. And I am still trying to figure
out the ferry system. Ten bucks for a ride across the bay?

Them we have Los Angeles, what locals call the "car city." The city is
spread over such a large area that, basically, if you don't have a car,
you are fucked and are going to spend a lot of boring nights at home with
nothing to do because you can't get anywhere. We have MetroLink here, but
that is a commuter train run by Amtrak that has limited stops in Southern
California. My experience with it has sucked. Nice trains, poor selection
of stops. The closest stop MetroLink stop to my apartment is about 20
miles away.

Don't even start with the bus system here in Los Angeles. How much
fucking crack were these city planners smoking? Several hundreds of busses
transverse this city, and you can't go a fucking single place without
making several transfers. When I use to take the buses to college, it
would take almost three hours with four transfers and cost almost eight
dollars for what would have been a thirty minute drive if I had a car.

So what do we do? We drive a car. And we don't carpool, as evidenced by
the empty carpool lanes on the freeways while all the other lanes are at a
standstill. It's still the fastest, most convenient, and cheapest way to
get from point A to point B, despite everything else the tree-hugging
hippies say. 

Yeah, give me a fucking bus pass, you idiots!
