                      Pathways to Eleetness
                      ---------------------
                      

Do you find yourself shunned by those more eleet than you? Do you have
trouble getting validated on decent boards? Does the true power of
eleetness simply escape your grasp?

Eleetness is not beyond your powers.  You don't have to be
intelligent, knowledgable, good looking or socially adept.

The most important skill in becoming eleet is appearing not to be
interested in becoming eleet. The more you show your desire for
eleetness, the more people see the fact that you are not eleet.  To be
thought of as eleet, you must make it appear as if such issues are
beneath you.  You must appear to be so eleet as to not be interested
in what people think of you.  To summarize, the first step to
eleetness is to appear eleet.

The next step to eleetness is to do something.  What you do is not
nearly as important as doing something.  To attain stature in the
hacking community, you must have a successful project connected with
your name.  Phrack magazine brought Knight Lightning and Taran King to
the spotlight.  Doctor Dissector achieved fame through Killer Cracker.
Tone Loc was the ticket for success for Mucho Maas and Minor Threat.
The number and variety of projects you can tackle is limited only by
your imagination and free time. Projects that utilize and highlight
technical skills, such as programming, are excellent choices.  Also
good are projects that showcase connections with important people in
the hacking community. Projects such as editing a magazine, forming a
group, or organizing a local 2600 meeting are good examples of this.
Be careful of projects with little technical content.  They can
sometimes be the cause of ill will in the hacking community.  Take the
example of the aforementioned Knight Lightning, who rose to the
extreme heights of eleetness without any real technical skill: Knight
Lightning's success is resented by a signifigant minority of the
hacking community.  If you attain eleetness, those without eleetness
will be angry and resentful if they feel that you have not earned it.
Choose your projects well and apply the highest standards of
excellence to your work, eleet stature will surely be yours.

The old saying goes "You can fool all of the people some of the time
and some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all of the
people all of the time."  True eleetness cannot be attained by
attempting to appear to be something that you are not.  To attain and
maintain eleetness, you must both maintain your self and change your
self.  Eleetness is achieved by being a better you.  Knight Lightning
could not have achieved great eleetness by trying to be Len Rose and
Len Rose could not have attained eleetness by trying to be Emmanuel
Goldstein.  To be eleet you must be yourself, but you must be the best
yourself you can be. Knight Lightning and Taran King could not have
become eleet by sporadically publishing a third rate e-zine. Len Rose
could not have become eleet by teaching people poorly.  Zarg could not
have become eleet by unsuccessfully hacking SunOS. To attain true
eleetness, you must change your interaction with both machines and
people.

Many people, especially very young members of the hacking community,
desire to become eleet so that they may hold their eleetness over the
heads of their fellows.  This is a trap for the would-be eleet.
Displays of poor social skills are simply examples of weakness, and
weakness is the antithesis of eleetness.  Eleetness is power,
technological power and social power.  For the true eleet, the joy of
eleetness lies in what he or she can make the system do. This can be
walking a drive, rerouting TCP packets, creating a text file, mesmorising
a group of students, or organizing a group of hackers for greater
effectiveness.  No amout of pure technical skill can maintain the aura
of eleetness for an individual without the skills to interact with
people effectively.
