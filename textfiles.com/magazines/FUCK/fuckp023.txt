        "I think we ought to read only the kind of books that
         wound and stab us . . . We need books that affect us
         like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death
         of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being
         banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide.
         A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us."

        Kdqhdgp's Heart
        
        I have a locket,
        that I wear around my neck.
        It's silver and simple,
        hangs at just the right length.
        
        Seeing it at first sight,
        I thought of you, 
        and I hope now you will think of me.
        Wear it, tuck it away, lock it beyond ...
        
        There is only one - you
        that I know besides myself
        only interested in knowing
        the truth ... the truth of my heart lies inside.
        
        I wear this locket,
        when I am missing you,
        or wish I was closer,
        or just when you're on my mind.
        
        My heart is as if a locked locket,
        that can only open to a certain person
        that can seep into it, and view it,
        being able to hold it, and not condem it.
        
        The locket I wear about my neck,
        will be given away - very soon.
        I will miss it, but I know 
        that it should be yours.
        
        For it is only you
        that has somehow helped 
        free this locked heart of mine.
        It must go to you.
        
        This locked locket
        will only be opened by you ...
        for it has my heart and I hope 
        you will take care of it.
        
        Not being able to say
        exactly what all I sense or feel,
        I will just leave it at this ...
        a silver, simple heart-shaped locket.

        A seagull cries
        The water laps against the cockles
        as the tide is ripped from the bay
        mist shrouds the pines that stand motionless
        on the bar.
        Surf crashes down from behind,
        as i lay in the open
        alone and saddened 
        by the disrepair of lives forgotten
        lives lost
        in the silence, i hear
        their dreams as once they lived,
        their love, their friendships
        made and lost forever.



							true story v2.0

		i need you,
	do you need me?
			i plant a kiss on your bare stomach,
	and follow it to the cleft of your breasts,
				with passion,
again and again,
		you inspire me,
					to the point of insanity,
	you make me want you more and more,
					everyday,
		i'll make love to you until the sun implodes,
				kiss after kiss,
			day after day,
				over and over,
		until you tire of me,
				for i love you,
and there's not a goddamn thing anyone can do to kill that love sugar...



        resolve

                     [i feel the] guilt for my
        actions. did I not see her resolve? was
        I scared? or did I not match hers as
        I fled onward in life? [scared to give]
        
                contemplation yielded to [painful]
        decision. a forced [one second] attrition
                to please her. to puppet the rest
                of my life. snap judgement that
        now brings pain, like the rope to neck. [will
        next week]
        
        even knowing, will i let it happen? i must
        so dearly live for that pain. single voice
        of unheard merit, cry out in musical hell.
                        why can't i
                explain that i live without her, because
                of my own shortcoming, not hers.
        
        with a 'no' falling off lips, i silently
        ask you to give me self again. i know i'm
        so wrong, i know my pain will grow.
        
                        with that
                i lost resolve
        and here i'm damned.            to solitude.

	your mold is too small
	for the plaster that is me
	i crack at the seams
	of your wishes and hopes
	my inferior material will
	not curve gracefully to
	your vision of artistic
	perfection
	force it if you must
	and watch your masterpiece
	crumble into a haze of
	smoky dust, your grand
	vision reduced to the
	possibility of an almost
	being 
	i laugh in your face
	controlling creators
	with the grimaces of
	children watching their
	sandcastles washed into
	the tide

        THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOUR LOVER RETURNS
        To Her Again
        
        love ferries through your veins
        like seagulls fly across the bay
        they will return home from loneliness
        while love cycles back to your heart
        
        love deposits itself in fingers and toes
        but it cannot grasp other loves
        until it evolves into more than lust
        when whispers echo lingering touches
        
        love remains as sedentary flesh
        when it cannot be refreshes by a kiss
        because neglect traps this emotion
        behind negative regrets from your past
        
        and when remorse calls your numb
        love still seeks to escape injustice
        but no matter how many times you forget
        love keeps flowing toward your heart

        Blood

        Cut so cleanly,
        Shaped like jewels,
        Maybe emeralds, maybe diamonds,
        Hitting the ground they explode,
        Smaller and smaller jewels, 
        So very precious, so very red,
        So very necessary, 
        Worth a fortune to the few,
        Taken for granted by the many,
        The great equilizer,
        Fending off death,
        Foretelling its arrival,
        Microscopically dissected,
        Broken apart, simulated and studied,
        Its importance has faded, its mystery unravelled,
        Its purpose known... 
        Pain, despair, lose, love, loneliness, hopelessness, rejection, 
        All of these and more, the unlearnt,
        The unknown, unfound reasons, 
        Cut so cleanly,
        Shaped like jewels,
        Down they drip, down they fall,
        The light fades, things get darker,
        Breathe comes slower, calmer, 
        Life, life, life, its a whisper,
        Slipping, slipping into serenity
        Everything becomes clearier, 
        A mystery to many,
        Blood.
