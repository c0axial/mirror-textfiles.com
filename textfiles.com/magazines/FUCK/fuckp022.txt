	It is amazing that a good poet can tell an epic story
	in 20 lines when Stephen King can't rip out a good
	thriller in under 1,000 pages. Poetry forces the poet
	to suffer a stringent economy, even in the book length
	epic poems beating to the rhythm of iambic pentameter.
	Support these talented souls. Buy poetry journals and
	books. Show publishers that a good poem is worth it's
	weight in dollars.

        An electric galaxy startled by reality,
        an earthquake that tests fearless mortality,
        you question this event but lost is the answer,
        a cost you resent not paying when it was asked for,
        in a time of disbelief, dismay, and displeasure,
        at a time of impulse, anger, and whether,
        you act with diligence depolyed too clever,
        you provide a reaction uncontrollable as laughter,
        a disaster it is when turned to frenzy,
        it takes a new twist when taken seriously,
        you see its creates time in sudden matters,
        its after the fact in which you attack,
        and excuse yourself from fault without question,
        and refuse yourself from forgiving this exception!

        i spent all day today
        trying to get you outta my head
        every last one of my thoughts today 
        was of your beauty
        
        and oh how your beauty makes me feel
        (how you make me feel for that matter)
        you just blow my mind
        all into little bits and peices
        
        you sweep me away
        on wings i never knew i had
        you make me feel oh so high
        like i can fly amongst the twilight
        
        take me away
        and show me where you want to go
        show me how you feel the way you feel
        cause i wanna be there too
        
        i wish i could be with you
        and hold you in my arms
        i wish i could feel you right here beside me
        (i know what i want and i think you do too)
        
        help me feel the night
        you seem to wear it so well
        carry me into the night
        and show me how to wear myself

        left front row -
        dense country breeze
        gently rains down.
                
        inadequate crowd -
        naked in tears
        for showing up
        empty-handed.
        
        someone speaks -
        i have never met him,
        but he knows names,
        places, accomplishments.
        
        stone-packed field -
        i see two for my parents,
        and my sister, fragile,
        drops a tulip between them.
        
        civilian tradition -
        no honorable flag,
        no guns, no bugle;
        generic newspaper ashes.
        
        it's unbelievable to think
        poets die like everyone else.

        Swirled Twirl
        
        Poems of lines, that wind through.
        My mind is full, always busy.
        Never before reading and reflecting back.
        Now I sit and am astounded by
         what all I have found.
        
        What is this inner beat,
         that keeps going and going,
         seeming to never to stop.
        How do these things spillout
         and form their own life?
        
        Crazy swirls and low spirals
         spin around, make about as much sense.
        Why then do I wonder why
        I can sit and be kicked and never cry.
        My out pouring of emotion kept in rythme.

        MY SHADOW ON THE WALL
        
        Morning's dawned, another day.
             I wish I knew some other way
        To say goodbye to those I love,
             Tell you what I'm thinking of.
        
        But the words refuse to form.
             All the seeds of reason shorn
        Simply lay upon the floor.
             You won't see me anymore.
        
        Oh my baby, gently sleep.
             I didn't want to see you weep.
        It's a shame I have to go.
             There are things you'll never know.
        
        'Cause I won't be coming home.
             No, the streets are where I'll roam.
        You won't know me when I call
             Nor my shadow on the wall.
        
        Think of me in tender times
             When I sang you gentle rhymes
        And I rocked you fast asleep,
             ..."I pray the Lord my soul to keep."
        
        Oh my lover, think of me
             When you're standing by the sea,
        And you feel the windswept spray.
             Think of me while I'm away.
        
        For I won't be coming home
             No, the streets are where I'll roam.
        You won't know me when I call
             Nor my shadow on the wall.
        
        Over by our favorite pier
             Hold a seashell to your ear
        And above the ocean's noise,
             In that shell you'll hear my voice.
        
        I'll be saying, "I loved you,
             But there were things I had to do.
        Though I had love in my hands
             I was such a lonely man."
        
        What a pity it should be
             That you never once knew me,
        But such things are part of life...
             ...I await the reaper's scythe.

        resolution to failure
        
        as i lay my head on the leather bound book
        tension flows out of me, muscles relaxing
        the will to move on is lost forever
        strength to keep up the good fight faded
        
        the time of vibrance decades removed
        subtle power, natural leadership, lost friends
                
        a gaunt relic of what i used to be
        my will is caving in, dooming me to solitue
        i take one last breath... again
        
        mea_culpa
        


        one night stand

        shame is oil on the mirror
        the morning after
        left behind, an impermanent
        memoir of a hot cheek
        against cold glass

        demonika



        will the cycle ever end:

        A great emptiness beholds me
        a flutter of the heart
        a feeling of fullness 
        a change in lifestyle
        a change in temperament
        realization dawns
        this is not me
        a great emptiness beholds me
        
        blaise
