                        Me, Myself, and I
                        -----------------

Me - Hate parts of me, and rip on them constantly in my thoughts.  Never
wishing to look in a mirror, and never thinking that me would find someone
that would ever wish to look at me; much less take the time to know the
real 'me'.

Myself - The part that is locked up, and rare if anyone ever finds or knows.
No one has lasted long enough, through all the different paths, to find
myself; and at times, not even myself.

I - I am the one that most people think different things about.  But, what I
am made of, and what makes I able to continue, are things that I have
rarely ever shared.  The times that I have, I've learned not to - ever
again.

These three parts of what makes Me, Myself, and I, are only glimpses into
what I am all about; and what I think of myself and do with myself; and
what makes me, 'me'.

They are not different personalities, because everyone has them.  They are
different sides to me that make up the one that you see or hear.

At times, names just have no importance in my world.  The only one there
is, is just Me, Myself, and I.  So, that is why I have started to sign
things that way.  Really, because why sign them any differently?  No one
would seem to mind, and no one would even blink an eye to think that it
equals a different name.

So, here I sit and type and write and then sign "Me, Myself, and I".  Not to
fool anyone, but, really, that is all there is at times.

Me is the one that I need to depend on to find myself, and make myself happy.
And I am the only one that can make that happen, so I need to sometimes be
just by myself, to find me, and to make 'me', and so I can be a whole that
equals myself and I.

This is no riddle, just thoughts and the truth of who "Me, Myself, and I"
are and what they add up to: another name, another face, another body,
another person...with one that you already know.

Someday I will be able to look at myself as a whole instead of just different
parts that add up to be me in the end.

-Me, Myself, and I.
