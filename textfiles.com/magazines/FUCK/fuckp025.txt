        Only my heart can show the pain,
        Only my touch can show my happines,
        Only my thoughts can show the confusion,
        Only my speaking can show my knowledge.

        unfinished symphony

        Look outside, the gods are crying,
        screaming out their agony,
        look outside, they're all lying,
        searing with their epathies,
        look outside, see the world,
        writhing in its pain,
        look outside, see the earth,
        starting over again,
        Look out there, the sky shows its sorrow,
        Look outside, think it'll heal by tomorrow?
        can you see the scars?
        they're hardly reflective.
        Open mouths, silent cries,
        anyone can tell,
        the look of haunted eyes,
        rivers of tears flowing down,
        the slivers of fear,
        you wear like a crown,
        I can feel you here,
        haunting what once was me.

        (WITHOUT PICTURES OR SOUND OR AN ANNOYING CASSETTE)
        
        writing poems is like
        growing a garden:
                        w     o     r     d     s
        dispersing
                        s     d     r     o     w
        and weeding out
        unnecessary punctuation - ,,,;;;'''///...<<<:::"""???>>>.
        
        
        writing poems is like
        having a baby:
                        puuussshhh!
                                puuussshhh!
                        pop! -
        out comes a poem.
        
        
        writing poems is like
        receiving a massage:
                        someone's heartbeat
                                 n
                              u     c
                           o           e
                         b               s

                                      p

        winding down a solo train
        switching feet to ease the pain
        lit only by fluorescent rain
        life's allegory aches for gain
        
        fingers always in my eyes
        picking out the ticks and flies
        and halfway through i realize
        there can't be truths without some lies
        
        a wincing pain, my head i hold
        i ate it whole, i ate it cold
        it baffles all, both young and hold
        that one hath dared to break their mold
        
        the glass is scratched and tinted grey
        it shatters, forming an array
        forboding, telling of the day
        and it will come, when they will pay

        Hydrogen Ball
        
        There it was up in the clouds,
        burning orange and gray.
        The glorified ugly demise,
        of another day.
        
        It's colors changing constantly,
        turn to blue and black.
        Just like the sky's been bruised,
        the demon's coming back.
        
        Bringing hell along with him,
        again darkness will reign.
        Shadows seem to drift away,
        a darkened stain remains.
        
        It's cold and damp, it's dark outside,
        surrounded by our sorrow.
        The people pray in vain and hope,
        to see the light tomorrow.
        
        But then the sky comes alive,
        as clouds are blown away.
        Midnight came and left again,
        he left his pseudo-day.
        
        Light from this glowing mass,
        reflects upon the night.
        The sphere mirror seems to shine,
        but stars put up a fight.
        
        Speckled lights across the sky,
        are faint but plain to see.
        A hole of light is brighter though,
        it dances down to me.
        
        It's rises high above this mess,
        then falls back down below.
        Again the sky is cold and black,
        this emptiness I know.
        
        On the verge of suicide,
        the shining ball arrives.
        This mass of burning hydrogen,
        has burned into my eyes...
        
        Levi
        


        extremely violent dreams in an otherwise serene life
        haunted by my own death, i continue on
        perusing backlit beach framed on the wall
        listening to accursed music from the floor
        a sullen image frozen in mind
        liquid silver tears blaze a new trail
        and they tell me to let it go....

        SEARCHING:
        
        Through the depths of darkness & despair
        Some days I wish I am not there
        Other days I drift around
        Consumed by misery, and love not found
        
        Life so diminutive, pain prolonged
        Tell me lord, what have I done so wrong
        
        Meet a man so sweet and nice
        He slices my heart up, with a knife
        I have these delusions, my minds not the same
        I guess it's a feeling, which comes with the pain
        
        Imagine my surprise as life rushes by
        Makes me think, that I just want to die
        
        But I fight and struggle to get away
        My soul will die if I decide to stay
        I'll keep on dreaming of a life so sweet
        Maybe find, treasured moments to keep.
        
        Blaise
