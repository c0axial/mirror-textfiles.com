                                Dress Codes
                                -----------

	This is my first time with a F.U.C.K. File, everyone, so bear with
me here...

        Ever since last year, we've had a new dress code at my High School.
Unsurprisingly, it's a load of bullshit, dressed up in even more bullshit.
Only one really big change was made, but it was enough to single-handedly
piss of the entire school, myself included. This change is that everyone
has to tuck in their shirts, blouses, etc. It doesn't seem big, but it's a
pain in the ass. But, of course, no one seems to want to fight back.
Everyone follows because they're afraid. Not just of being given a
detention, but afraid of being different. They could be ridiculed for
standing out in the crowd. A lot of people say they care, but you know how
little they really do whenever some dipshit from the office comes around
and tells them to tuck it in. There's a few who'll stand up, but not many.
        People say it's pretty stupid to caring this much about something
that little. Especially for someone who cares as little about fashion and
clothing as myself. Sometimes I wonder myself if I'm not just looking for
something to bitch about. But then it all gets to me. The rule, the
reasoning, and the old shits on the school board who think because they got
voted in, it gives them immediate knowledge of how all kids think. That's
why I don't comply. That's why I rebel. Not for attention, not just to be
different, like so many say, but because of the utter ignorance displayed
in this rule. So, for the entire year, I refused. For standing up, I was
ridiculed by students and teachers alike, and given detentions, and days of
ISS. But I never did conform.
	Oh, yes, you might want to know what the bullshit reasoning behind
the law is. Well, of course, they tell us it's for our own good. With a
tucked in shirt, it's apparently harder to hide weaponry, and we look
"respectable". Bullshit. Purestrain bullshit. I don't even need to go
into detail here on how fucking stupid it is. Of course, for those
assholes who ran the school, I had to. And, predictably, every time I
would argue away any defense of the dress code, I was faced with a simple
reason: "Because the school board says so." Well, fuck, the school board
says so. Whoopdee do. I didn't vote those old shits in, so why should I
listen to anything they say? Especially when they put it into effect like
they did, conveniently "forgetting" to tell us about it until the very
first day, instead of on the "Dress Code Sheet" they mail home before
the school year starts. Crafty motherfuckers, aren't they?
	And, this week, a new school year dawned at our wonderfully droll
school. And, of course, the administration didn't seem to learn. Despite
the supposed piles of office referrals & D-Halls I was told about, the dress
code continued at Clear Creek High. Not just that, but now they've made it
more restrictive. You can't dye your hair unnatural colors, because they
apparently "distract from the learning process". Well, shit. Apparently,
COLOR now distracts me. Well, motherfuckers, why don't you get out there
and paint the entire school gray, if it's so damn distracting. And cut down
those trees and bushes. Such stimuli might create independent, non
government-engineered thoughts. Utter chaos could ensue. Also, you can't
have any body piercings showing, except earrings. It's not something I'm
gonna go do, but I don't give a fuck if someone's wearing them. Why do they
care? Oh, yes, of course. That could create non-conformity, and mess up
their perfect little school.
	So, another year goes on. Because of all the chaos resulting from
our poorly-planned conversion to Block Scheduling, dress code is not on the
top priority. But, they still have people going around at lunches to check
that we're all being nice, neat orderly children, with our shirts cheerfully
tucked in. And I'm sure that once all the confusion from the change calms
down, it'll be back to giving me all the bullshit again.
