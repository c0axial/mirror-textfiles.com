                             ----------------

                                   one

"good morning mr. johnson."

"morning mike. is he in there?"

"yes sir, just catching up on some work."

"mind if i see him?"

"not at all sir, go in."

i opened up the door and walked in to the oval room. one thing i miss
most in the world today is a flare for artistic architecture. most
things in this day and age are built for efficiency. this room appeared
more pleasing to my eyes than what i was used to seeing around here. the
man behind the desk startled as i walked in.

"andrew, this is unexpected. make it quick i have a flight to catch." he
was looking over some papers and drinking from his favorite coffee mug.

"john, i need to talk to you for a minute." he knew by the sound in my
voice that whatever i had to say was serious.

"of course." he took his eyes off the document, leaned back in his chair
and looked directly into my eyes. i like this one more than most. i just
hope he would listen more than the rest of them do. "what is it andrew,
something bothering you?"

"i need for you to stay here, do not go on this trip." i stared directly
into his eyes.

"what is it, is something wrong?" it was good that he was showing some
concern.

"no, nothing like that. i just have a bad feeling about this trip. i
really think it would be best if you stay here."

"come on, don't be so paranoid. what could happen to me? the people love
me, nothing bad will happen. just put that thought into the back of your
mind and don't worry about it." he had a certain conviction in his voice.
hell, i knew what was going on and i was almost fooled into forgetting the
whole mess.

"this isn't just another one of my paranoid hunches. i really feel like
your life is in danger this time. i really need for you to stay here." i
was trying to mimic his style of conviction. after all this time it is
still hard for me to get through to these people, though it was so much
more easy in the past. we were allowed some leniency with our
persuasion techniques.

"who would want to kill me?"

"you need to ask yourself that question. there are people all around just
waiting for the opportunity." he slammed his coffee onto his desk and
stood up.

"look andrew, i cannot run from anyone." he began to walk towards me,
"if the people of this country think that i am too scared to leave my
house than my career is over. do you understand that? i have a job to
do and i can not let the threat of communists get to me. when i chose
this job i knew it came with certain risks and i am willing to deal with
them head on." he was born a true leader. he didn't always let it show,
but it is always there.

"but--"

"--nothing. now this conversation is over. i do appreciate your concern
for my well being, but i will be all right. just do me the favor of not
telling my wife about this," he placed his hand on my shoulder, "you know
how upset she will get."

"yes sir."

"and don't call me sir, we're friends andrew." his strong forceful voice
turned into a soft pillow.

"yes, of course john. look, just be careful." i patted him on the back and
began walking towards the door.

"will do... and besides," he yelled to me just as i reached for the door.
"i have to go, someone is expecting me there." he smiled and gave me a
wink, "if you know what i mean." i found him truly intriguing as i laughed
on the inside. it is too bad i couldn't just make him stay. freewill is a
bitch.

"well, good day." and with that i left the room, and the body suit.

                                   two

"there you are!" she yelled out on the street.

"hello there beautiful. is everything ready?" he said in a demonic
monotone voice.

"they sure are, better than i had planned." she giggled like a schoolgirl.

"so oswald is going to do it?" a smile crept up on his face.

"he would kill the pope for me."

"now that's not a bad idea."

"don't even think about it. besides, we have bigger plans now." she began
straightening his shirt. "what's wrong, you look distracted?"

"do you see that man over there?" he looked across the street at a man
sitting at a bus stop.

"yeah, what about him?"

"he has been sitting there for the last hour."

"who cares, maybe he's lonely."

"i don't know, there is something strange about him. like i know him.
from somewhere."

"you worry to much, don't think about it. let's concentrate on our next
great achievement for mankind."

"actually, forget about that now."

"what do you mean?" a look a surprise came over her. "we have been planning
on this for fifty years. do you realize how much grooming i put into this?"

"i know, but something bigger just came up." they began walking.

"something bigger? what could be bigger that i haven't heard about?"
doubt grew like steams from her voice.

"the almighty just called for a secret meeting with michael and gabriel."

"secret?" her doubt turned to interest.

"yes, and it may turn out to be the perfect opportunity to do what we have
always wanted to. to get the one thing he treasures more than these
worthless humans."

"you don't mean," her eyes became an ocean of anticipation as a look of
disbelief and excitement rushed over her face, "his plan?" she stopped
dead in her tracks.

"yes." he began laughing a deep mechanical thunder. "let's go, we have work
to do. the end is near."

                                  three

"hello gabriel."

"it's been a long time michael. it's good to be back here." he sniffed the
air around him with a deep passion as his senses made love to the
environment. "i feel so stuffy spending time there with all those humans."

"we all know the feeling." he had a face with the look of deep mourning.

"sometimes i wonder why we bother."

"we don't question his word." he became a weapon of faith.

"i wasn't questioning his word. i am just wondering what it is all about.
all of this must have some purpose."

"does it? isn't that how lucifer got started?" concern grew in michael as
he stared at his friend.

"don't you worry about me. my faith is as strong as it has ever been. i am
just now, after all this time, beginning to understand what those humans
have." he carried such a sad disposition around himself.

"what's that?"

"knowledge, freedom, the ability to see past all of this. they have all of
these attributes and all they can do is fight amongst themselves. so many
hypocrites, so many non-believers, so many people who have just stopped
looking up and wondering what is really going on. they are starting to
give up on him. it is not that they don't want to believe, it is that they
can't. it makes me so sad to watch them wither away while i sit here
and wish that i could have had it so good."

"you will."

"what do you mean?" shock and hope raced through his body as he stared
hard into michael's face.

"he wants to see you. i am here to bring you to him."

"why?" humility ran through his veins.

"gabriel, he wants to speak with you." a look of such longing passion filled
gabriel's being.

"it has been so long. i forget what it is like to be in his light." if he
could cry, he would have birthed a new river upon the very ground he stood.

"come, we away to naon."

                                    four

they stood at the front doors of naon. michael stood proud, with a look
of void emotion across his face. gabriel stood in humility, he very being
kneeling as he stood.

"holy holy holy is the lord of hosts." the seraphim angels horned
with their voices as michael and gabriel approached. they entered the throne
room and kneeled with all the humility of existence before him.

they began speaking at the same time. "woe is me! for i am unworthy.
i am an angel of unclean senses, and i dwell in the place of people with
unclean souls." they kept their heads faced towards the ground, and their
eyes clenched shut as he began to speak.

"yes my lord." gabriel spoke as michael remained silent.

"my lord, i do not understand."

"my lord, lilith?"

"yes my lord, i understand."

"human my lord?"

"yes my lord."

"my lord, i will follow your instruction as humbly as i can. i will not
fail you." michael and gabriel stood up and began walking in reverse
while keeping their eyes closed and their heads fixed to the marble floor.

"holy holy holy is the lord of hosts." the doors closed as michael and
gabriel humbly departed. as they walked their separate ways they
both stopped for a moment and turned towards each other.

"i'll see you in 26 years gabriel." michael somehow kept that void
expression on his face.

"if i could only feel so happy. for at last, the final stages are upon us."
gabriel walked towards the gates of heaven with a newfound proud sensibility
about him.

                                  five

"ashes to ashes, dust to dust." little gabriel watched as the two coffins
laid on the ground with an utter lifeless void. the only thing he could think
is why any god would kill his parents while he was at such a young age. he
only felt anger for the world as he listened to the sadness of the other
people around him. he wondered how they could cry at a time like this, how
they could feel anything other than hate.


"i understand you'll be taking care of gabriel." the priest spoke with his
uncle and aunt as gabriel walked deep into the cemetery.

"i am sorry about this gabe." a voice spoke from beyond a tombstone.

"loui!" gabriel's voice lightened with joy.

"how are you feeling gabe?" he spoke with a deeply concerned voice.

"i don't know."

"you're mad aren't you?"

"i guess so. i just don't understand." his head turned towards the ground
as he kicked the tombstone loui was now sitting on.

"you don't understand why any god would take your parents from you?"

"yeah, i guess so."

"listen to me now gabe. what i need to tell you is very important." little
gabriel looked up into his eyes. "poor gabriel, so much is revolving
around you. you have the entire weight of the universe sitting on your
shoulders and you don't even realize it yet." he let the silence of the
wind speak for him. "one day i will need to call upon you. i hope that i
can count on you during this time."

"i'll do anything for you, loui. you're the only one who cares about me."
gabriel grabbed on to his legs and began hugging the life out of them.

"now now gabe. don't get too attached, i need to leave soon. i just wanted
to say goodbye. i won't need to call on you until much later in your life,
a long time from now."

"why do you have to go? you're my only friend, i don't want you to leave."
he began to let go of his first tears of the day.

"i can't explain to you why i have to leave, this is something you will
only understand with time." he looked at gabriel's sad face. "i will always
be with you though."

"what do you mean?" he sniffled as he spoke.

"do you see that up there?"

"the moon?" the sniffles began to fade as his confusion set it.

"yes, the moon. i want you to know that i will always be watching over
you from there. whenever you need someone to talk to, or something to make you
feel better, just look up and think about me." he smiled as he stood up.

"thanks loui, i'll never forget you." he hugged him one last time.

"i know gabe, i know." with those last words they stood back from each
other and loui vanished before his eyes.

"there you are gabriel. are you ready to leave?" gabriel looked at his
uncle and the saw the future that awaited him.

"yeah, i'm ready to go." he looked up at the moon smiled, wiping the
tears off his face.
