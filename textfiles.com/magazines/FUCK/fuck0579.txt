	They say that all good things must come to an end. If they were truly
	good, I doubt they would end.

	To many, this file should not come as any surprise. With the last
	year came very few releases for the zine. Many say the quality of
	them had gone down as well, but that is a matter of personal taste.

	I am well aware of the arguments for keeping the zine alive. It takes
	no effort to just leave it on the back burner and not kill it off. While
	true, I think it does a disservice to our readers. It gives them the
	illusion that it will one day come back and be an active publication.
	Mind you, based on submissions it easily could be. However, on the part
	of those running it, the inflow of new articles is still not enough to
	keep the interest.

	I have been thinking for the past week or so on how to end this zine.
	A journal of sorts that has lasted most of my adult life. Seven years
	in the making. A sounding board to dozens of people who felt it was the
	best voice to carry their thoughts and feelings. The zine was being read
	worldwide before the first issue was posted to an Internet FTP site.
	Having that kind of readership at the time was a phenomenal tool to
	the handful of writers.

	Rather than end this with a long rant, I think it more appropriate to
	end it on a short note. From here on out, F.U.C.K. is dead. While not
	impossible, it is quite improbable that it will be brought back to
	life. New rants and articles can be found on my new hobby, Attrition
	(www.attrition.org).

	After this file is posted to the FUCK mail list (fuck@attrition.org),
	I will open the list for unmoderated discussion. That will leave the
	wouldbe writers a forum to share their ideas. I also encourage the
	writers who submitted files that were not published to resubmit them
	to other zines. Just because I didn't get around to your file doesn't
	mean it wasn't worth reading. Further, FUCK Poetry Venture will
	continue on. Submissions to jericho@attrition.org, subscribe to the
	list by mailing majordomo@attrition.org with 'subscribe fuckpoem' in
	the body of the message.

	It's been a fun ride.

	Disorder
	aka Jericho
