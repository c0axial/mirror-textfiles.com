        some of the best poetry is about those deep & penetrating
        emotions, just primal enough to allow poets & philosphers
        to wax intellectual about them. love, rage, hate, fear,
        sadness... all of these things are what make us human,
        all of these things are what make us poets. sometimes
        there is nothing better than a few moments alone with
        a line or two, written just for you, 200 years ago.

        The Writers Poem

        Clean white paper,
        staring into the void

        Neatly ruled lines,
        judging every written word

        Deadline rushing nearer,
        threatening to overtake

        Pen touching down on paper,
        bleeding my soul as the ink

        All to you the reader,
        keeper of the dream

        voyager



        antithesis

        between us
        a taut unsharing exists
        smoked air hazes our
        understanding
        vague words stretch
        our love not strong
        enough
        to survive
        the mutual unseeing
        of wide spectrum
        philosophies
        containing
        too many shades of grey
        and not a single
        solid
        line
        over which our hands
        might
        touch
        the chasm is too wide
        for crossing

        demonika



        mp5

        single repeat can't touch
        overwhelming adrenaline
        prepare, and it still pulls
        one second down

        thought trails to meme
        only on tv, hands of control
        high risk raid, self defense
        two seconds down

        magazine empty
        pause to admire killing technique
        fresh circle of pinpoints
        silence returns

        dis



        rage

        Rage deep within me,
        rising up from years ago.
        Memories of fleeing,
        and having fun.
        I wish to reach for that time again,
        Picking up the source, I look around,
        dropping it to the ground.
        
        What once was, and is no longer ...
        Hatred for all of those ones,
        from years ago,
        pureness in expression,
        and clear of intent.
        Now reaching over, I picture them,
        as I pull the trigger.
        
        Smashing them to pieces,
        shattering the pictures of the ghosts,
        that I wish never were ...
        I fall to the ground,
        to only find that there is no end.
        
        Rage deep inside of me,
        burrowing deeper and deeper,
        until one of these years,
        I will just all out explode,
        and will never be pieced back together, again.
        
        For, only one can deal so much,
        as rage builds up in all of me.
        Violent scenes, past glimpses,
        I shudder to have to even thought of them,
        Closing my eyes, one more time,
        I take a deep breath,
        to never arise.
        
        Me, Myself, and I.  October 21st, 1997.



        half-mast

        (or; ripping off bukowski again)

        i am writing this poem with a black pen at work
        it is an expensive pen and the ink comes out smoothly
        this is being written on college-ruled loose-leaf paper
        it is friday, august 1st, 1997
        it is 5:32p.m.
        there are three cars in the station
        now there are two

        across the street is the municipal complex
        there is a library, a police station, and a firehouse
        there is a U.S. flag waving in front of it
        it is at half-mast
        that is where i got the title for this poem
        
        the flag is at half-mast because a fireman died in his sleep last friday
        he was 47 years old and his name was ronald hartranft
        i never met him but i think his wife was a monster
        i never met her either
        
        he did not burn to death saving lives like he should have
        instead, last friday, his wife looked at him and he looked at her
        and he turned around, climbed the stairs, and went to bed
        i don't blame him

        nor do i blame us
        laying in bed instead of saving ourselves
        glancing at the clock between cigarettes
        laughing at it
        with our hands at our throats
        hoping the other would finish it off
        and then..
        release

        you get up to go
        gather your things
        pause by the stairs
        turn around and
        you look at me and i look at you
        and i wave my hand at half-mast
        you smile
        wave back
        turn again
        climb down the stairs
        and leave

        and i roll over
        give my salute
        and go to
        sleep
        fighting the fire that took hartranft last friday

        he was 47 and his wife
        was a monster
