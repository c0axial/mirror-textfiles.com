                     In Case You Blinked...
                     ----------------------

Last night I walked out of my computer room and noticed three police
cars sitting outside in the road. All three cars managed to drive up
in front of my building, no lights, no sirens, and all the officers
were out of sight before I even knew what was happening. Twenty minutes
later the three officers walked from around the building, got in their
cars and drove off. To this day I still have no clue what they were
doing.

Are you tuned in to what's going on around you? Do you know what
happened in your neighborhood last night? Probably not.. which leads
me to believe you don't really have a clue about state/nation/world
events. How many sources of news do you go to in the course of a day?

Lets look at how much really happens around our blind lives. These are
the headlines for "crimes and catastrophes" from a SINGLE source
of news on the Internet. Imagine if I were to watch TV or read the
newspaper.. or mix in other headlines I got during these two weeks.

Imagine... this in the span of two weeks. Odds are you heard about
5% of this material, IF that. Think about what else is happening
in your world...

more stuff happens, and we slip right by.
