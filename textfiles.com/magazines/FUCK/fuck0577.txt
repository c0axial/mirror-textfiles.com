                          Dear Mom and Dad
                          ----------------

  Hello, Daddy.
  What's the knife for?
  You should know, you've been twisting it in my heart for almost 23 years
  now.
  What am I going to do with it?
  Why, twist it in your heart.
  Oh look, you're bleeding now.
  This one is for abandoning me when I was 5.
  Don't fucking cry, you piece of fucking shit.
  You just have a little knife wound in your chest.
  I have my whole fucking life destroyed.
  This one is for hitting my Mommy.
  I inherited your violent tendencies, you know.
  That's why I know you're such a piece of shit.
  I have the same urge that you do but I've never given in.
  I'm not a fucking pussy like you are.
  I don't have to make up for my emotional weaknesses by beating on those
  with physical weakness.
  Look, you're bleeding even more now.
  Soon your heart will be as empty as mine.
  I could walk away right now and you'd bleed to death, but that's not
  good
  enough.
  Just like I was never good enough.
  Nothing I ever did was right, you could always find something wrong.
  The few occasions that I managed to be perfect, you simply ignored me.
  Seeing me rise above your patheticness hurt, didn't it?
  I hope this knife hurts just as bad as it did everytime you spit on my
  accomplishments.
  How does it feel to be the one getting stabbed in the heart for a
  change?
  I learned this from you, you know.
  You taught me to always control everthing.
  You're the reason I always have to be in charge, regardless of the
  costs.
  This one is for the time you kicked me out of your house because my
  severe
  depression inconvenienced you.
  Was it as inconvenient as that gaping wound in your chest?
  I'm sorry my emotional turmoil is a problem for you.
  I guess if I was a real man, I'd be able to keep my emotions hidden.
  Of course, I've never had a real man to look up to, so I guess that'll
  never be a trait I pick up.
  Oh look, you're dead now.
  Too bad it's too late for it to really do much good.
  Oh well, maybe it'll save my baby sister some pain.
  She's already started down the same path as I have.
  Hopefully I can save her from that.
  Now excuse me while I piss on your corpse.


  What's that Mommy?
  Why am I holding a bloody knife?
  Oh, that's just Daddy's blood.
  You know how you're always bitching at me about paying you back what you
  believe I owe you?
  Well, I'm about to give you back everything you ever gave me.
  What? You want to talk about this?
  That's funny, you never wanted to talk to me about anything when I was
  younger.
  You never wanted to talk when it was *my* life on the line.
  That's probably why I can't fucking talk to people now.
  The words are there but I can't figure out how to make them come out.
  You bitch at me for spending so much time on the computer but you're the
  one that fucking drove me there.
  Why do you think I spend so much time there?
  I don't have anyone to talk to here.
  I suppose it was a fair trade, though.
  You never told us a damn thing about your life and you never bothered to
  ask about ours.
  I'll be graduating from college this year.
  Are you proud of me again?
  Too bad you won't live to see it.
  Remember when I dropped out of college the first time?
  You bitched at me for making you look bad in front of your friends.
  Fuck you.
  Oops.. Did I cut you?
  Not long ago, I wanted to cut myself.
  You would have gotten too much satisfaction out of that, though.
  This is much more productive.
  Want to complain about how I'm killing you?
  Nothing else was ever right, I'm sure you can find something about your
  own
  murder to complain about.
  Did I just slit your throat?
  Guess now you'll never have to worry about talking to me again.
  I hope you're proud of yourself.
  Isn't that what you always said to me?
  Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.
  By trying to force me to be all the things you wanted to be before you
  fucked up your own life, you managed to fuck me up even more than
  yourself.
  I don't know if I'll ever have the time to pinpoint all the ways you've
  screwed me up.
  Sure, it's up to me to make sure I don't repeat your fucking mistakes,
  but
  there are so many I don't know if I can ever find them all.
  Sometimes I think it's not even worth the trouble.
  But you and Daddy both taught me to never let anyone else be right.
  So I'll be damned if I let you win.
  Was that your dying breath?
  First positive thing I've heard come out of your mouth in years.
  I'm sure somewhere you're bitching about that as well.

  Dedicated to my parents
 whom almost make me wish I believed in God
  simply so
  I could see them in hell.
