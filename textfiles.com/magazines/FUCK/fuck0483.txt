                        -------------

I am dead. I am breathing, but I feel no life. I sit and ask 
myself all the questions I can never truthfully answer. "Why 
can't I just be happy?" "Why do people treat me so fucked 
up?" "Why do I feel like dieing?"...

Truth is, I  don't feel like dieing. I feel like 
living...happily. In peace. But since I can't, I want to end 
it. I will end it. I must.

I looked at the razor blade sitting on top of my stereo. I 
stared at it as if I was obsessively in love with it and what 
it is capable of. I started crying, I threw the phone that 
was in my hand. It hit the wall  so hard, one off the pieces 
flew back and hit my eye. That pissed me the fuck off. I 
looked at the blade again, and decided to do it. Cut.

I grabbed the blade, and wiped it off...I looked at my wrist 
and scratched my wrist as hard as possible. It turned red. 
Bright red. I started to cut, I slowly cut about an inch 
long....no where near the vein. Then I realized I didn't want 
to die. I wanted a scar, a physical scar, to show for my 
emotional ones. I decided to cut again, this time I was 
closer  to my vein, I looked at the blood come out. I felt 
good. I felt like I was invincible. The phone rang. My ex, 
telling me how I felt again. 

Why do people automatically  assume just because THEY are ok, 
that I must be too. He keeps telling me I am ok, that I don't 
want to die. That I won't. That he will stop me. It made me 
wanna do it more. I hung up...blade still in hand, and cut my 
other wrist again, right on my vein. I just watched the blood 
ooze out, it seemed so...so peaceful. I felt relieved. I 
licked my wrist, and tasted my blood. It was sweet. Sweetest 
thing I ever tasted. Kinda sick, huh? No. It was beautiful. 
That I felt so dead, yet so alive. I felt so much pain, yet 
so much warmth. 

I was listening to the SneakerPimps. Her voice hypnotized   
me. I felt like I  wanted to be the beat, her voice caressing 
me. I decided that since I couldn't do that, I didn't want to 
do anything else. I went to my dresser, still bleeding, and 
reached for my trusty bottle of prozac. I took out 7 pills. 
All that was left. I took them all. I went to the bathroom, 
and took 4 or 5 codeine, I can't really remember, since I 
felt completely numb and dizzy. 

Next thing I remember doing is laying down on my cold floor. 
Completely intoxicated by the music. 

I woke up the next morning, feeling very very sick. I threw 
up about 5 times. I went back to my room, and looked at the 
floor. I saw blood all over, and a piece of paper right by 
it. I picked it up, and unfolded it. It said...
 "You did the right thing bitch, and if you wake up to see 
this, you failed once again. Next try! Sincerely, Your 
Mother!"

WHAT THE FUCK!!! I am truly disturbed now. She has done it. 
She's lucky she's not here right now. (Keep in mind, this just 
happened) How could she say something so cruel to me? I know I 
get on her nerves, and sometimes she even feels like killing 
me,but damnnn!!!

That's ok though. Because regardless of how bad it hurt to 
read that, I know she doesn't mean it. She is saying this 
because she knows I will live. She knows I have to. She's 
just bringing to my attention what a dumbass I make of myself 
when I do dumb shit like that. And it IS true.

Point of this all; so many people inn my life have downed me 
for being "suicidal". They tell me I'm crazy, I'm 
exaggerating, blah blah blah. The thing is, most people who 
TALK about killing themselves, are the ones who are too 
fucking scared to actually go thru with it. They just want 
attention. They might feel like dieing, and in all actuality 
wish they were dead, but they won't do it.

The ones who don't talk about, well they just don't. And 
sooner or later, that anger will eat them up, and they will 
go thru with it. 

But however, I have talked about it many times, telling 
people I was going to do it, and I really wanted to. I really 
tried. It just failed. And the more people tell me how I 
feel, or how things really are, makes me want to prove to 
them even more so, just how BAD it is. SO be careful....
