				smart thinking
                                --------------

	There's a little Voice, deep inside your head, that you know
	very well. It tells you little things - like when not to
	cross the street even though you should have enough time
	on the walk signal to make it across. It tells you big things,
	like when to say no to that nice enough guy who keeps asking
	you out on a date. It's just that feeling, that intuition,
	that tells you what is right and wrong for every nanosecond
	of your existence.

	When you ignore it, shitty things happen.

	Sometimes the shit isn't so deep. Once, when I was waiting to
	get on a plane to NY, an announcement burst over the PA. USAir
	was offering cheaper rates to anyone who was willing to wait
	for the next flight. My gut told me "take it." My family
	disagreed. We spent the next few hours on the worst flight
	of our lives, tossed around wildly in a thunderstorm. People
	were screaming. My mother was worrying that she had forgotten
	to sign their will. It was that bad. But all that really
	happened was that we were scared. I wish I had listened to
	the Voice, though. Now it takes heavy drugs and minor amounts
	of alcohol to even get me to consider getting on an airplane.
	Live and learn, right?

	Sometimes the shit is deeper. Two times in my life I have
	been in love - real love, not little puppy dog crap. In both
	cases, I was really too young to do the right things and make
	a happy ending. In both cases, I was given an opportunity
	to try again, with more experience and less bullshit. But my
	voice kept telling me that it simply would not work, that
	I would end up getting hurt somehow. Blindly I ignored my
	gut and rambled on, trying desperately to recapture what I had
	lost through my own stupidity and childishness, thinking that
	I could do it over, and better this time. As always, the Voice
	was right. It knew before I did that I was being stupid. In
	both cases, of course, I ended up getting cut. Deep. Now I know.
	In matters of love, listen to the Voice.

	Smart thinking is listening to your Voice. Whether that means
	going to one college instead of another, taking a different
	route home, or moving to California instead of New York,
	ultimately, your Voice helps you make decisions about your
	life that might mean the difference between happiness
	and despair. Alone as we all are, we have our inner selves
	that speak to and through us. If you pay attention, you might
	learn something about loving yourself, and doing the right
	thing, no matter how annoying or terrifying that path might
	be.

	I know I'll ignore the Voice, off and on. We all do. 
	And every time I'll look back, and remember that it was there, 
	and know that I should have listened. Maybe getting older and 
	wiser means nothing more than having a louder Voice. I just wish
	mine would scream instead of whisper.
