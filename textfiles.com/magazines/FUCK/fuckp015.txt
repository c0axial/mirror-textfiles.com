        HOLIBLAZE

        illuminating highway somewhere near Emblazon City
        glowing cigarette butts
        waltz across the deadened tar
        refracted like a firefly in my passenger seat
        windshield
        spiraling down to the falls
        to watch the christening lights, shackled
        around a manger, from fallen heights
        while waiting for a spark to enlighten me
        to
                  jump
                              into
                                      depths
        where I could be a glow-worm bait
        for some lonely fisherman whose wife
        died in a house fire from an electrical short
        during Christmas 1985

                                  longing,
                                  burning,
                                  itching,
                                  craving,
                                 a long hot
                                night filled
                                with desire
                             glances exchanged
                           names never mentioned
                                  touch me
                                  kiss me

                             burn with passion
                             purr with ecstasy
                              scream with pain
                           no words were uttered
                               lust prevailed
                          The morning sun awoke us
                             and away we walked
                         perfect.........strangers.

        Two like souls dance in this shallow world.
           the ability to judge.
        Nightly outpour of some strand of me.
        Pulled taut between self realization and angst.
           But not the angst you now..
           He lies down the road around
           the corner behind the store.
        My angst is different.
        One day I might even get introduced to who he really is.
        Mortals may ponder and deem it worthy..
           of a new name.
                I care not.


        
        My two best friends
        
        My two best friends,
        is what I wish to express to you...
        tell you about them,
        for they truly are my two best friends.
        
        Why should I care what you think
        of them, anyways?
        Because, they could be anyone's 
        best friends, some day.
        
        Frist, there is the one,
        I saw walking out the door,
        I had finished eating,
        and there she was...
        Friend at first sight.
        
        I walked right up to her, and grabbed hold of her,
        and decided she was the one I really wanted.
        So, here I am, holding her now,
        and, no I am never going to let her go.
        
        She is so graceful,
        lines of saddness fade from her,
        and images of happiness float about her,
        just depending on the light she's in.
        
        So sleak, she always is at her peak,
        looking wonderful,
        no matter what kind of day she's had.
        Oh, how jealous some get ...
        
        Always ready to listen,
        and willing to talk,
        Never just saying
        "Oh, can't it just wait?".
        
        Then there is my other best friend.
        Always willing to listen,
        never giving me trouble,
        he just sits there, and waits.
        
        Waits for me, to talk...
        having patience for me to take my time.
        Always available for me,
        all I have to do is reach for him.
        
        No matter where I am,
        there he is...
        and no he is not a stalker,
        he's just a true friend.
        
        Never running out of time,
        for me... will always hold my hand.
        He does this, because he has
        eternity... or until a flame destorys him.
        
        So, how can I say that anyone is able
        to reach these best friends of mine?
        Beucase, of who they are...
        no I am not being religious 
        or even spiritual...
        (Just a little crazy)
        
        I"m just expressing my gratitude
        for the friends that will always listen
        and are always there for me.
        the friends, that I can always rely on.
        
        Who are these great,
        supposed best friends of mine?
        Simply, papers of my journal,
        and my writing pen.
