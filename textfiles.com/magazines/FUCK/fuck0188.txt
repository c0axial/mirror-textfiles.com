                            Meric Religion
                            --------------

        "Ok class, today we will pick up where we left off in our
study of mythology. Yesterday we finished up the Native American
beliefs and discussed how they were like some of the Norse gods, but
quite different from Greek and Roman. Today we will study the Meric
gods and talk about their history."
        The class finished putting away their jackets before pulling
out their tablets. Each student was assigned a tablet at the beginning
of the school year loaded with all of their books and assignments.
Nothing was done on paper anymore and had moved to wireless transfer
to the teacher's desk computer.

        Mrs. Clark walked to the computer projection screen and started
writing names of the more popular dieties in the Meric mythology. Jesus,
Allah, Buddha, Mother Earth, Yaweh, and Satan. "These are the major dieties
of the time we will be discussing. Let's start with 'Jesus' today, and move
on to the others at the start of next week. From your reading, you know
that most major mythos' lasted between 500 and 2200 years. This mythos
is what set the higher boundry of that range."
        "During that time, many heated debates ensued over whether or
not religion should be taught in schools, whether or not their deity
'god' existed, and the validity of the bible. If you would like to read
the bible, you can pull it up on your Tablet or the library computer
under Mythology3/Meric/books/bible. If you do read it, take note of the
various writing styles, contradictions, and political motives behind
it. Also note that it was supposedly written by many people over
several generations, and was divided into two main books."
        Many students pulled it up on their tablets and read the
overview that accompanied most of the books they had access to. Seeing
the student's interest, the teacher allowed them to read the short
synopsis beforing continuing with her discussion. "The bible was the
basis for 'Christianity' which held popular favor for just over 2000 years.
That was one of the most enduring religions of the time. Christians
believed in an all powerful being they called 'God', who sent his son
'Jesus' to earth to die for their sins. I realize it doesn't make much
sense, but if you continue reading some of the essays or Cliff Notes
on the bible, you will understand."
        That night, most of the students went home and read excerpts out
of the bible, or various essays written in the 20th century about the
book, and the history of the religion. Some of the faster readers almost
completed the Old Testament before they returned the next day.

        "Good afternoon class, how did everyone enjoy the reading last
night?". A few students raised their hand, or mumbled a word of
acknowledgement, but most looked somewhat perplexed. "Well, I can see
not everyone understood it or agreed with it.." This time more students
spoke up agreeing with her judgement. "There isn't much explanation
on why so many people believed in the bible, and no one during the time
could ever logically explain it, yet millions attended church every
week, prayed to god, and lived by this book. The best explanation I
have found is an essay by Marty De'Mire written in 1997. It explains
how the amount of followers fluctuated over the years, and that
family tradition kept the entire religion alive. Since it was passed
down from generation to generation, and wars were waged to force it
on others, it was able to prosper and thrive throughout that period
of history."
        As she continued the students took notes, accessed the essay
being discussed, and followed along, trying to figure out why
such a bizarre religion was able to mesmerize so many people.
"If you read through the bible, you will notice very big differences
between it, and what the churches of the time preached to their
masses. The church would say 'Thou shalt not kill', while the
bible portrayed their own deity killing millions for literally no
reason." Confusion hit most of the students, but they followed along
anyway, interested by the topic.

        "And by the late 20th century, large factions of people had
risen up to fight against the Christian church, and speak out
against the ways of the bible." A loud bell interupted her next
sentence before she was able to continue. "Ok, before you leave,
finish up on the essay by De'Mire, and tomorrow we will start on
Buddha of the Meric religion."

        The class gathered their belongings and headed out the door,
completely educated about the christian religion.
