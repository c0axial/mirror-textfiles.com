                         More Stupidity
                         --------------

     Stupidity lies at the root of all human frustration.  Without
it the world would be a much better place, in theory.
     Let's take stupidity in parents for example.  I'm 17, and in
order to go anywhere I have to beg my parents and give them
arguments as to why I should be able to leave the house for three-
four hours.  The simple idea that I should have to argue is
frustrating.  Their "protection" does nothing more than drive me
from them, and they refuse to acknowledge that.
     Stupidity on the roads is another example.  Ever find yourself
behind someone who doesn't seem to have a place to go?  Or do you
ever find people braking for no reason, then suddenly signaling,
as if it makes any difference now that you're a couple inches from
rear-ending them?  How about sitting at a green light, waiting for
some dipshit to realize that he has now been given the right to
proceed?
     The problem with traffic stupidity is this: You might not mind
wasting your time, but when it comes to wasting others' time,
don't.  People hate having their time wasted.  This is at the heart
of the Satanic/Hedonistic/whatever morality: Do as you please until
it fucks with someone else's life.  
     This stupidity is not the most refined and harshest of the
myriad of stupidities we find in life.  Another form of stupidity
is the one of chosen ignorance.  That's when someone is ignorant,
yet they refuse to know anything about a subject.  A stronger form
is when someone thinks they aren't ignorant, when in fact they are. 
This leads to the strongest: someone who thinks they're
knowledgeable in a field(while ignorant) who preaches their
ignorance as fact to others.
     This includes various religionists and right-wing fuck-ups. 
Our government is run by the most stupid group of fucked-up, biased
old-farts who think what's right for them is right for the nation. 
I have one thing to say to these morons: Fuck you, and we're on our
way.
     This needn't apply only to the right-wing.  The left-wing is
just as guilty.  In today's politics, there is no "good guy,"
there's just a "less fucking stupid" guy.  That's the trend in
America lately it seems, an unfortunate one to say the least.
     There are those who want to sue tobacco companies because of
tobacco-related illnesses.  People are even beginning to
consider(if they haven't done it already) suing gun manufacturers
for gun-related injuries.  This is where frustration comes in, and
this is where my morality says "Excuse me, and fuck you."  
     When it comes to directly hurting someone, the victim is a
victim of THE PERSON WHO INJURED THEM.  Someone who kills themself
with tobacco has no one to blame but themself.  Someone who shoots
someone else has no one to blame but himself.  It's been summed up
by the famous statement "Guns don't kill people, people kill
people."  If you go down to the elements of a problem, to its
components, you might as well go all the way.  Why not blame steel
manufacturers for car-accidents, or blame mother-nature for giving
us oil that burns into pure shit for our precious atmosphere? 
Let's just blame everyone, after all, it alleviates the pressure on
ourselves!  
     Stupidity will always be the most destructive problem in our
nation and in the world.  The solution?  I don't know, personally
I'd start out with a reform of our government so that instead of
trying its hardest to barely pass constitutional requirements, it
respects the constitution in its entirety.  
     America was not founded on the concept of "Christian Family
Values" bullshit.  America was founded on the Satanic morality--do
whatever the fuck you want unless it fucks someone else's shit up. 
[Pardon my language, but I think it flows beautifully with the
intent of this article.]  In other words, "the right to pursue
happiness."  The government should serve NOT to restrict the people
and protect them from themselves; the government should protect the
people from the assholes of our country, including the ones in our
government.  The government should protect us from being strangled
by business, and from being ripped off and killed by society's
worthless garbage.  
     This is what America needs to "return to"[as if it were ever
there].  Instead of dodging the constitution whenever possible on
technicalities, keep your Slave-Master Christian Morality out of
our businesses, schools, and homes.  "Christian Family Values" is
nothing more than a nice way of saying "thought control through
blackmail."  
     Returning to my solution...Once America has been suitably
reformed, let's conquer the world and put a dictator in power. 
Let's have three houses of government; the executive(world
dictator, IQ of 150+ required with degrees in BUSINESS, ETC), the
selection committee(a group with various tests to prove/disprove
the stupidity of potential dictators), and the executive
assassination committee(the elite board of assassins that will
immediately kill any idiot that somehow slips through the selection
committee).  I'll be the first dictator.  Heh.
