        There are so many forms of expression, and this is Poetry's
        Venture. Venturing through the glimpses of the mind, heart,
        or spirit of the one that is writing, only to show a glimmer
        of something, or someone.  Ways to express the things that
        may be oridinary that they see through an unordinary prespective,
        or maybe it's just the reality?  A venture through a glimpse that
        is a glimmer of something, or someone ... to expand the vast
        plain that we find a place to call our own - the Venture
        of Poetry.

        Linda...

        Linda, lovely lady
        with long dark braids
        and flashing eyes.
        
        Working for a question mark
        in a grimy little dive,
        pushing beer and hugging
        drunks and wondering...
        
        Wondering why the one she
        loves doesn't and what happened
        in the years just past to change
        the place she thought
        she knew.
        
        And other thoughts exist there too..
        
        Lovely Linda, old at 30 and
        getting older. Feeling
        helpless in a life
        of lifelessness
        and seeking death
        to find her life.
        
        Nights upon the bar room
        floor when the moon is
        dark and the beer moves
        quickly. 
        
        And Linda thinks back
        to last week or sometimes
        when its really bad to late
        last year when life was calm
        and pouring beer was just a way
        to make a buck.
        
        But now the drunks have said
        too much and stayed too long
        and anyway, there ain't nothing
        much worth going home for anyway
        so why not stay open just a bit longer
        and listen just a while more.
        
        And who knows, one night it might
        come true and a prince will
        claim her for his own. 
        
        But the evening passes and
        the beer stops flowing and
        soon its time to call last call
        and see just who has stayed.
        
        Lovely Linda, seeking life
        and love and finding pain.
        She of the multitude and 
        yet alone.
        
        FTF



        Untitled and Unfinished

        The echo of a thousand voices
        Thunders in our heads
        As the melodies there engendered
        Whispers of the fathomless mystery of the soul,
        Piercing us with these same passions
        That characterize our essence.
        We are the instruments.  Our souls,
        The symphony of our desire.
        Like petals on the summer breeze,
        By this desperate cry we are animated,
        A marionette on astral strings
        As the bright moon wanes.
        Slipping into the darkling distance,
        It crystallizes into a single plaintive song
        Dimly wailing its message:
        We will die soon, you and I,
        And join the voices on the other side.
        
        Screamin' Lord Byron



        the silk black finger caressed the mesh of gold.
        the silver lining seemed far too green too far away. 
        this blue night casts a red shadow on your brown door frame.
        and the woodwork finished with a tin of lead came from the yellow man
        sitting on top of the purple haze. 
        never again will i buy such orange flavors from a man with only one
        tan hand.
        never again will the white streaming milk flow around his pink
        insides.

        an example of a bad poem

        would be that one by robert frost
        about the boys swinging
        on birch trees the one
        that is so long

        i know that it is supposed to evoke
        EMOTION and that i am supposed to
        LEARN something from it but instead i am
        
        sitting here with a mug of
        luke-warm chocolate
        writing this
        anticipating the new wrestling show tonight
        picking my nose
        hoping my package from that gaming store
        arrives in the mail today
        and not thinking much of anything else
        except that robert frost
        sucks the methane clear out of my
        fucking rectum
        which is maybe enough emotion
        and learning from one poem that
        i can take
        
        mr. frost has finally done
        something right for a change
        and he didn't
        even
        mean it
        
        styx                    thefedz@rad.edu



	No Particular Order  

	unknown likeness in the distance
	mutual spirit close to heart
	never ending friendly surprise
	daily routine repressed the spark

        curiosity, maybe even destiny?
        always meant to be, in one form or another
        one with true concern
        silently provoking, such a tease

        never met, already known
        content with eternal comfort
        to find the solace of you
        kindred hate if nothing else

        four. that mean something to me.
