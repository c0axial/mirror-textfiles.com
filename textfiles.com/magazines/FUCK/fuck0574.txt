                          Getting High School
                          -------------------

I've decided to become straightedge. You know: No more drugs, no more
alcohol, no more casual sex. Hmm, than again, maybe not.

So I went to this party on last Friday, hell my friends and I go to a
party every Friday. There's Cole(the alcoholic), Jamaal( the soon to be
pothead), Skye(the true Pothead), Richie(who insists he's a DJ), Phil
(could he be more normal), and myself(I don 't do cocaine, I just sell
it). Anywho, we went to this party and most of you know the song is true,
everywhere we go we see the same hoes. Well, not just hoes, but always the
same people.

Now, most members of "the crew" are seniors save myself (junior) and
Skye(frosh) and while some of you may remember your senior year of High
School, those probably didn't party like we do. The alcohol, the drugs,
the sight of your drunken female classmat es taking off their clothing and
giving a two dollar lap dance to some 8th grade kid who lives down the
street and stumbled into the party.  The point is its usually a good time,
but times change.

Jamaal, as mentioned earlier, is quickly becoming a druggie. I met Jamaal
a year ago when I set my sister up with him. He fucked my sister but
that's not pertinent to the story. He told me once that if I ever thought
he was becoming dependant on drugs of any kind that I should let him know
that he needs to cut back. Fine.  At this particular party I broke out
with a quarter sack of really good shit. The day before A friend of mine
made some purified THC and we soaked this stuff in it. I don't smoke pot,
I used to, but I try to do as little drugs as possible nowadays. I packed
Jamaal a couple of bowls and he smoked them all by himself. You should
never smoke by yourself same way you should never drink by yourself and I
chose this time to tell him that I th ought he was becoming an addict.
Shit.

Apparently I'm a fucking hypocrite, I mean according to my African
brother. Maybe he's right, he had a pretty strong case. I mean, while I
don't do many drugs I do deal a bit for extra money. I'm the go to guy for
half of the 2500 students that populate m y high school. What do you need?
Cocaine? Got it. Weed?  Got it. What did Jammal and I need? Acid. Got it.

I opened my wallet and from within the folds I produced two tabs of
amazingly good Mad Hatter. For those of you who don't know acid, Mad
Hatter is better than, say, Pink Elephants, but not exactly the best shit
for you. As Jamaal And I placed the tabs on our respective tongues I
realized that I was indeed a hypocrite but in an hour or so I wouldn't
care. I didn't.

Eighty minutes and three Camel Filters later I didn't care anymore. Jamaal
kept shouting at me about tree people, and Skye and I lay on the grass in
the backyard, he was toasted, I was tripping, and the grass never felt so
wonderful.  I could hear Richie mixing some funky beats in the background
and after a quick call to A girl named Deborah who was on her way over, I
was pretty sure I was going to get laid that night(I didn't). Phil and
Cole were presumably drunk, but hey, you've got to make your own fun .

Than it happened. This cat Armando is one of the most popular guys in
school. He knows me by my nickname "Elvis" as most people do but I doubt
he knows my real name. He falls face first into the grass next to Skye and
I. He just passes out and everyone la ughs, Than skye says something
memorable and it occurs to me that I haven't heard a human voice in about
20 minutes. He says "Wow, Armando isn't half as cool when he's drunk."
He's right, He wasn't.

I get up and walk into the house. Over the sink Jennifer , a member of the
Senior Skank Crew and loyal cocaine customer , is throwing up into the
sink. Is this what High school is all about? I wonder as the vomit heads
down the drain. I later found out th at she had only six beers. SIX! And I
thought I had no tolerance.

This story has no moral. Upon asking myself the question above about this
being what high school is all about, I realize that the answer is yes.
For me at least. At my high school at least.

I don't drink that much. I don't like it. But I smoke a pack of Camels
every two days and I am your local pusher man. Straightedge is hardly a
possibility if I cant have casual sex. But someday I'm gonna be forced to
grow up and then this all ends.

I'm sorry if I've offended anyone with this. Its just a story of an
average Friday night. A portrait if you will. But this is my life and I
know at least five other people who do the same thing. I'm sure there are
others.  Live for today.
