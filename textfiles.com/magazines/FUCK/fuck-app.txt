=             F.U.C.K. Distribution Application/Information             =
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

        This is an application to make your board become and official
distribution source for the F.U.C.K. Files. Fill out the application
and mail it to one of the places later discussed in the file.

                                General Info
                                ------------
        If you have thoughts or ramblings about something and would
like it to be considered for F.U.C.K. then UL it to one of the HQ boards
as FCK-001.TXT or whatever number after that. Please do NOT upload it as
a file, and for the file description make sure it is known that it is an
idea for a file, not a released file.
        If you are a sysop of a board, and want to carry the F.U.C.K. files
you do NOT have to be an official distribution site. All we ask is that
you carry them. If you do want to become an official site, you must make
a seperate directory for the files. When files are uploaded, use this format:
FUCK0001.TXT  F.U.C.K. File 1 - Where it all Begins   *or*
FUCK0001.TXT  F.U.C.K. Vol. 1 - Where it all Begins   *or* 
something remotely like that.
Include the title, and make sure they are free to download. That is the 
only way they will get out and circulated.
        For the time being, there will be no more than three dist. sites
in any given area code. If you run an official dist. site, it is encouraged
that you have an account on Celestial Woodlands so you have access to the files
as they are released. The writers try to UL them to the dist. sites, but
may not always have the chance.
