        it has spirit. it has fire. it might even smell funny. 
        but you love it. that is why you read it. poems. from
        all over the place. there are demons. there are heroes.
        sorry, no ice cream. but you can still take your licks
        from these fabulous poets. we are all poets. some sing
        and some snore. but we all write because we can, we
        want to, we need to and, well, because if we were not
        writing these great poems, which are all neat and tidy
        in presentation below, we are probably just regular
        people busting our asses at the fast food joint. enjoy
        this superb installment of literary goolash. peace.

        A forgotten field of grass and hay
        Holds a crumbling wall of earth's decay
        Whose upturned stones are faithfully shielding
        A small tin box of possessions yielding
        One last chance at a hope that's burning
        In a forgotten traveller's life long journey.

        A freedom denied him in his youth
        In hopeless pursuit of the truth
        Barred from success by life's relent
        And wearied dreams inside him pent
        By fear of failing expectation
        Under constant attack and evaluation.

        Yet within the torn forgotten letter
        A light will shine which teaches better
        Than to accept the horrors thrust upon
        And pursue a life before its gone
        And from doubt's strong prison free the dream
        Letting imagination from within one stream.

        Trip Like I Do  

        Trip like I do.
           Visuals beynd comprehension.
           Experience is a new thrill.
           Alchohol is water
           Drus are a waste of time.

           Red wine mixing red blood.
           Pure soul pouring out
           living death screaming inward
           stop

           slow start, recover from old
           begin again, quick return
           fucking scream through me!
           I used to be somebody

           I am everyone. The world is me.
           Beyond, flowing aroud all
           done
        Trip like I do.

                         Mingeled, mangeled memories
                              rumble in my mind
                      Jingle Jangeled pieces of a time
                                forgetten ,
                        lost between now and .......
                                    never

                         Dark demons bear your name
                     your taste still lingers on my lips
                      and i feel you in between my hips

                               I push them out
                                     in
                                     and
                                     out
                                   they go

                         Finally they've disappeared
                          as darkness turns to dawn
                            and within the night
                               again they roam
                          and i moan ....... louder
                         they run back in and hide
                        within the closets of my mind



        LIFELINE FRAGMENTS

        i'm fortunate. i've been
        close to death. another
        turn, another choice.
        no god. one too
        many paths. leaving
        hope in a dead voice.

        faith in eyes. listening
        to the forces. this
        passion, that disgrace.
        no luck. drowning the
        word-talent. sticking
        melodrama on my face.

        i'm rewound. nothing
        to play me. technology
        for help, technology for hate.
        no tears. everyone
        wants a number. it's all
        merely society's bait.

        childhood in hands. pretending
        to see friends. her
        half-smile, his low talk.
        no crossroads. humming tunes
        in my feet. it's only
        fear that warms our walk.

        i'm uncertain. i'm thinking
        there's an answer. systematic
        dream, fool-proof goal.
        no enemies. prosperity
        resides in your motion. find
        one more piece to become whole.

        Indiana Poet    March 2, 1998



        Say it aint so,
        apologies unwanted defiantly deferrable,
        unfaithful you are acting bizarre,
        guilty and liable for punishment,
        unbelievably mournful upon my judgment,
        let it go and see how easy it will be,
        let me go and set me free I see,
        unfair and uncaring eyes of broken pride,
        undercover love is not that kind.
	
        Say it aint so,
        I love you so you know,
        stop the hurt forever cursed,
        I try to expunge your thought but plunge,
        into a place lonely in space,
        I try to express my feelings as less,
        often to relinquish your dignity with peace again,
        but my love is confused, tangled, and abused,
        my love is accused, scandaled, and refused.

        Night Worthless?

        Worthless night, no workout or heart
        just wasting time as thoughts go by.
        Leaving nothing for the better,
                marking not a thing for me.

        You are dancing with a twinkle in your eye.
        Your bodies move closer,
        you wonder if thats how I could be.
        Another heatless night gone away.

        What draws my thoughts
                to warmer places with other faces?
        Somehow, something is calling me,
                or is it my own wishes?

        Suffocating, alluring, nothing present.
        Is there anyone who could accept me,
        and I could love just the same?
        Another thought filled night.

        Worthless night, of only day dreams,
        nothing really seems real.
        Come calm my heart, if you are right,
        and maybe this will not just be another worthless night.
