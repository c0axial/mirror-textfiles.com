Subject: [FUCK] The new list? 



Where has the zine gone? Why haven't i released? Well, if you are getting
this, things are looking up :)

A big change on the mail list and the system hosting first of all.
Unfortunately I haven't had much time to get the list moved quicker.
Sekurity.org is no more, but attrition.org is stepping in to fill the
void. Everything should be fairly trasparent.

Well, here it is. I have about 15 - 20 articles ready to go out, so expect
them to start rolling out in the next few days. I'll try to release no
more than one a day, give or take, so as not to flood you with too much. 

As usual, submissions/questions/rants/death_threats to
jericho@dimensional.com

Thanks!
