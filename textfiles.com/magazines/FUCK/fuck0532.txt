                                ----------

if there's one bit of simplistic information you're looking to gleam off
these pages but haven't understood anything yet, look no further. rest your
weary eyes and quaint little mind here, this won't require much thought at
all. this is the key to understanding about 90% of the world's thought.  As
long as you develop the skill to see into it correctly, you shouldn't have
any problem.

here it is:   people think two things at once.  One emotional set to fulfill
their ideal self (the top layer), and one emotional set to fulfill their
actual self (bottom layer).

knowing what these two are is the tricky part. usually it'll be a balance of
short emotion and long emotion - that is, a person will show happiness but
have an underlying, more subtle display of hate within it (this is common of
people who think they are above hate). others will use the delay method, in
which an initial, shallow emotion is portrayed but if the person is an
unskilled 'actor' the true emotion will wiggle its way out in a few seconds.
it's easy to differentiate these two tolerances because the short will fall
back into stupidity, hate, or whatever else the person is hiding; the long
will fall back into ignorance (or simply won't fall back at all). look at
stephen king's books. that's all he does and he's fucking world renowned. he
knows where to place you, then go for the stab. knowing how to compromise
these layers is something i treat as an art form; it can be done with as
little as one or two sentences or can be stretched out over months. either
way, there is always a path to the person's mind, regardless of who they are
or what they have done.
 
how can i prevent this from happening to me, you ask? well, the answer to
this is the answer i retain in each of my writings - tell the truth; the
real truth (see, i used a little double right there). when there's nothing
to hide, this trick won't have any function. unfortunately, 99% of the
world makes a habit of having an ideal self, so accept the fact that once
you master this, it can be used universally.

now, i've opened the pandora's box for you all. did you really think such
an easy lesson of life wouldn't have its consequences? every one of you
that reads this and uses this double method is now going to develop a third
layer out of unconscious fear of being discovered. no, don't bother saying
'this guy's bullshit, i don't act like that', well, it's all unconscious; if
you have fear of yourself, it'll happen.  your first ideal will be bumped up
to a nominal tolerance, your 'real self' will now be your pretend, and you'll
be placed at a higher skin. heh, and by saying this, a fourth layer will
emerge. see what i mean? the layers may merge into each other though as time
goes on - most people only have room for so much in their mind.

look on the bright side - if you choose to act on this and turn the weakness
into a strength, you'll be able to use this over anyone else that hasn't seen
this piece of philosophy and be able to read them like a book.  not only that,
eventually if this knowledge ever reaches the public, everybody will develop
this extra layer and society as a whole will adapt its culture around avoiding
this, must like how it has evolved into a retribution of the TV age currently.
what a wonderful place that will be.

you might be asking yourself, "why did this pretentious fuck tell us this
then??" - i dunno. cause i can, i guess.  it's a very human thing to do, so
might as well indulge my life and my mind while pushing the human race
a little further.
