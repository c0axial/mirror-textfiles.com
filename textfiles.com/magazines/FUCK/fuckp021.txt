        i often think of ways to describe this zine, and I
        usually come up short.  this is no exception.
        why the appeal of poetry?  i think the lack of formal
        english.. the pure chaos that can ensue in the words
        gives it appeal.

        other times i think the randomness finds home in the
        free will we all have.  or perhaps it is something
        else.

        Freedom...

        The house was empty when he got home.
        It was better like that.
        Noone could understand he needed to leave.
        He needed to be free.
        He was eager to be on his way,
         to where he'd be happy.
        So he sat at his desk and typed a goodbye letter.
        He'd miss his pals, but promised to see them again, someday.
        He'd need to prepare for his trip now.
        He began to fill the tub with warm water,
         not bothering to remove his cloths.                      
        For a second he wondered, is leaving a
         temporary solution to a permenant problem?
        No. Life is an eternal problem.
        With that he reached for his blade,
        Swiftly making 2 incisions, down eigther wrist.
        Just like that
         his wrists began to drain his angst
         into the warm water.
        The Pain was leaving quickly...
        The Deceit
        The Depresion
        The Breakdowns
        The Tears
        The...
        I'll love you forever...Monte, I promise.
         all fucking gone now...exiting from wrist to water.
        No more being alone...
         no more being anything anymore.
        It all drains from him. slowly...
        He feels a tingle over his body
         as he gets light headed.
        He smiles, with a tear in his eye.
        "I'd rather die then lose your love."
        He dips his head into the now crimson pool.
        He inhales its warmth.
        His vision turns to black.
        And now...
        Freedom...

        Reason

        Often one hundred words to express
        a single thought or desire. The beauty
        of unmoderated speak. To directionless
        travel and eternal unforgiven. All to
        say such a simple thing.
        
        The things we do. The lies we vomit.
        Actions as foreign as heaven itself.
        All come natual by some miracle.
        
        For what? The one thing that seldom
        exposes itself in meaningful form.
        A curse or blessing among the chaos
        of heart. The primary slice of
        ruling passion.
        
        Love can certainly condemn.
        


        an untitled work of agony 

        night stillness trembles with the slither soft sound
        of my heart
              i n ch i n g away from me
        it makes a bloody path
        pocked with the black wounds of loss
        i tie a pink ribbon around it
        and put it in a box
        for safekeeping

        SILENCE ECHOES

        Silence echoes
        still and wide
        far within
        the place beside
        where your voice, heard
        amongst the roar
        of mem'ries found
        the day before,
        was lost amongst
        the thoughts that I
        could not speak out
        nor even cry.
        
        At times I'm lost
        for things to say,
        and so in haste
        I drift away
        too far from you
        to even see
        the one who angers
        me is me;
        who, though strewn
        in rage's quarry,
        implores you to believe
        I'm sorry.

                      Do you remember your first time
              the excitement you felt at the end of the line?
                  Do you remember the creamy white satin?
                      With each turn a new twist arose
                   you understood it far better than most
                     Losing yourself between the covers
                       Never knowing you'd be lovers
                      Finding pleasure with each twirl
                               of the tongue
                            Caressing the words
                                 one by one
                 When it was over, you're whole body shook
                     These pleasures can only be found
                               inside a book

	Naive with intent, hurt and overspent,
		You experience a dramatic event,
		Unwanted and untrue, battered and confused,
		Your mind starts to twist.

		Second thoughts begin to chime,
		If you only knew the time,
		Your love could sense the truth,
		Even though whats the use,
		You lost whats left, abused,
		Your pride and will to choose,
		The mate you one day sought,
		The one whose blind from thought.

		If hidden agendas bother your night,
		Open the door, and send them in flight,
		A difficult task to unwind, at last,
		But now omnicient you are,
		A sight to see thus far,
		Your now a shining star!

        SAY NO TO "MELTING POT" THEORISTS
        
        swallowing hard, i find avant-garde prussians
        lingering in my reflection, with german arrogances
        squeezed into my fingers; an anglo-saxophone tune.
        
        neutral swiss; banking on my central europe heritage
        where religious fractions were divided and multiplied,
        leaving my family little recourse but to learn america.
        
        now i am some generation icon, gapped from historial accuracy
        by people whose forefathers probably kissed my foremothers once;
        inconsistencies in backgrounds still force everyone apart.

        Speaker
        
        Numerous lines flow out,
        untouchable strings,
        that hold my heart.
        
        Reaching past my body, 
        into the depth of what is unseen.
        Surrounding my every breath.
        
        Streaming itno my very veins,
        steam is released through my pores.
        Leaving me, having been cleansed.
        
        Winding through my very spirit,
         it lifts my soul higher.
        Body is only an image.
        
        An image that is better
         to have forgotten
        then to ever redeem.
