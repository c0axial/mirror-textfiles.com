                          Jonathan Smith: President
                          -------------------------

        Jonathan watched as the Examiner punched a key sequence into the
computer sitting on his government issue desk.  The silence was oppressive.
This was the most important moment in Jonathan's life.

        The Examiner found Jonathan's file and printed the results on the
government issue laser printer.  Jonathan listened to the low hum of the
laser as it spat out the results of the Test.  Tiny beads of sweat broke out
on his forehead and he shifted uncomfortably on the chair.  Page after page
slid out of the printer while Jonathan studied the walls.

        The Examiner reached for the stack of paper, still warm from the
printing process.  He grunted softly and then pulled the last page from the
stack and handed it to Jonathan.

        "As you can see, the results of your test were excellent, but not
quite good enough.  You will not be relegated to slavery, but you will not be
a member of the ruling class.  Since your I.Q. is 15 points above average,
this entitles you to a house, a government job, and 15 slaves, one for
each I.Q. point above average.  You will be permitted to have one child
provided that your chosen mate has an I.Q. within 5 points of your own.
You will be permitted to access various technological resources, which are
detailed in this report.  You will not be permitted to pursue continued
education.  You will be a member of the Drone caste, and will be issued
a paper saying as much.  I will schedule you for tattooing next week and will
also make an appointment for the chip that will be planted in your wrist.
This chip will contain all of the information detailed in your report, as well
as any additional information we choose to include.  This will tell vendors
and librarians which information and products you are permitted to access.
As a member of the Drone caste you will not be permitted to have privacy
of any sort, and the Government shall be privy to all that you and your
family do.  Should you break any of the regulations detailed in this report,
you will be disciplined according to the 2020 Constitution of Renewal.
Now, do you have any questions?"

        Jonathan looked closely at the Examiner, a pasty faced middle-aged
member of the Drone caste, the same caste he had been assigned to.  He
allowed his gaze to wander around the room, a room that was small, dark, and
had no personality of it's own.  No camera.

        Jonathan leapt out of his chair and took the Examiner into a
sturdy headlock.

        "Yeah, I got two questions..  and you will answer them both."

        The Examiner grunted out a muffled "Whatever you want, just
please don't hurt me.."

        "Are you happy?"  Jonathan loosened his grip slightly, just enough
to allow the Examiner to speak freely.

        "No, no I am not happy...  is that what you needed to know?"

        "I have one more question. More of a request, actually.  Give me
your access code."

        "It's written on a piece of paper in my right hand desk drawer..
They change it every day.  It won't help.."

        The Examiner's words died off as Jonathan gave him an injection
in the heart.  Jonathan allowed the man to drop to the floor and sat in
the chair in front of the computer.  A slow smile crept across his face as
he delved deeper and deeper into the system.

        The laser hummed again, spitting out a report generated by
Jonathan himself.  Jonathan pulled the Examiner off of the floor and
placed him so that he was slumped across his desk.  Heart attacks were
common in the Drone caste.

                             JONATHAN SMITH
                               I.Q.: 372
                             CASTE: RULING1
                             PRIVILEGES: ALL
                           POSITION: PRESIDENT 
                          EFFECTIVE: IMMEDIATELY

        Jonathan smiled and said,"God I love computers."
