        welcome to the first release of F.U.C.K.'s poetry venture.
        as more submissions for the zine come in, the more poetry
        i see. because of the structure of the base zine, i felt
        a separate series would be in order. as you all know,
        demonika has been a big contributor to the zine, and her
        files are more poetic overall. this lead me to solicit
        her help in the new venture.

        there are no set boundaries for this part of the zine.
        we only look for poems that express the feelings of the
        author, and do not look for any specific topic. in fact,
        poems about unconventional topics are especially welcome.

        as always, feedback (good or bad) is welcome. let us know
        what you think so that we may improve the quality as
        needed. in the mean time...

        magnetic poetry i.
        
        in his raw garden dreams
        delicious poetry is less
        a gifted language than an
        urge essential to him.
        if he produced a whisper of beauty,
        could he rip out the
        frantic void in his breast?

        regarding inner turmoil

        Silenced pain my warmth at night,
        while in my mind a raging fight,
        the longing to take a final breath
        and slip into awaiting death.

        Chilling coldness burns my fingers,
        emotional scars can only linger,

        Confusion and chaos wrap around me
        seemingly eternal will it be
        one thing in my life keeps me sane,
        on my warm face a refreshing rain.

        A weight of gold, laid upon my head.
        A pound of hatred, and a pinch of spite,
        add a twist of fate, and a hint of spice,
        and there you have, the piece upon my body.

        Bronzing powder awaits, somewhere,
        as I think to live on.

        Paying a price, for something that I never did,
        and would never do again.
        Making a place, in this hellish hole,
        for me, myself and I.
        To hide and make do, with what life I had lived.
        
        A coffin once picked out,
        lies open, just for me.
        
        A pint of boiling gold, a pound of hatred,
        a pinch of spite.
        Mix and stir, and there you have,
        the makings of this tortured soul.
        
        Add a twist of fate, and a hint of spice,
        and there you have, the piece upon my head,
        that weighs me down, and pushes me further
        down, then hells basement.
        
        For, here I am, burning and dying,
        for something I never dreamt of doing.

        "I'm not as messed up as I want to be." - They Might be Giants

        Why is the world so broken? Who put the dead birds so
        high in the tree?  Can you catch the dust so diluted in the
        air? Can you kiss the cheek of Mother Nature then swear you
        never cared? It rains milk on Sunday afternoon, and orange
        juice in the morning. Who has the keys to the kingdom, and
        who touched the silk bread bring hanging to the wind? It is
        too bad the silver lined sky has been plastered with red brink.
        It is too bad that the rats under our rugs are mechanical in
        nature. For if the world has been a better place we would all
        still be alive, instead of being eaten from the inside out.
