This is a FAQ (Frequently Answered Questions) about the text files
labeled F.U.C.K.

Q- What does F.U.C.K. stand for?

A- F.U.C.K. stands for Fucked Up College Kids. They are primarily written
   by people attending college classes.

Q- How long has this group been around?

A- The group was born on January 24th, 1993 in an IHOP located at 19th
   and University, in Lubbock, Texas.

Q- How many people are involved?

A- Only a few people write the files now. So far there are 16 files, and
   they have been written by three people, although one person has written
   most of them. We like to believe these are common thoughts by many people
   and that we are merely writing these into files.

Q- How often do the files come out?

A- Heh. Usually when something pisses one of us off. At first, they came out
   almost weekly, now that summer is here not quite as often.

Q- Are they long? Do they take long to read?

A- No. They are meant to be somewhat brief, and easy to read. The longest
   one is about 15k, the shortest is 3k.

Q- Where can I get them?

A- Right now, primarily BBSs in Lubbock. They are slowly spreading to other
   places via computers, and hopefully they will soon be available on 
   Internet.

Q- Why should I read them?

A- You should read them, because they point out flaws in many people. It
   would be ideal if you read one, notice you are one of the people doing
   something, and then correct it. They can be informative, interesting,
   offensive, or whatnot.

Q- Why are they being written?

A- To let other people see the world from a different perspective. That 
   always seems to help people realize problems and overcome them.

Q- Is their much offensive language in the files?

A- Yes and no. It depends on the file, and what you consider offensive.
   To me, the principle writer, no word is offensive. What many people
   consider bad language, I consider another word. The title alone
   no doubt scares some people off, and causes them to not read them.

Q- Are these ever mistaken for files talking about sexual fantasies?

A- Yes. A popular nickname for those files are "Fuck Files" and these
   are NOT sexual in nature. They are about everyday events in most cases
   and to date, none of them deal with sex.

Q- As a reader, if I have comments or questions, where can I direct them?

A- You can direct them to:
                           WWIVnet #28 @8607
                           WWIVnet #2  @8614
                           Internet z3mar@ttacs.ttu.edu
   I try to answer mail within 24 hours of recieving it.

Q- How long do you think F.U.C.K. will go on?

A- Who knows? I will keep writing as long as I see stuff that needs to
   be changed in this world. That means probably a while, but I always
   try to make the file somewhat interesting.
