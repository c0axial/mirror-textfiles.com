                             Five Zero Zero
                             --------------

        Little over five years and five hundred files later, here I
am a world away from where it started. Have you thought about what
all goes by in five years time? How those things influence and change
us? Let me list a few that come to mind for me and the zine.


        I have lived in three cities at seven addresses.

        Had three cars and five jobs. My first job while
        working on the zine was making a little above minimum
        wage. Now I am salaried with bonus and 401k.

        Two serious girlfriends, two other girlfriends
        worth mentioning. (ie: lasted more than 3 months)
        One of the serious ones was Demonika, who is the
        second largest contributor to the zine.

        Six laptops, fourteen full size computers (most of
        which run some flavor of Unix). The zine started
        with me having a 2400 baud modem, and is currently
        hosted on my own network which is colocated on
        a burstable T3. Laptops are significant as I write
        most of my files on them while watching movies or
        spending time outside of my computer room.

        500 files, 167 pieces of mailed replies to those
        files. 

        Three cats. (four if you count Dem's second cat
        that is my surrogate step-child). Ms Kitty (the
        family cat) who was put to sleep last month at
        21 years old. Speedbump, 20th century cult hero
        who is living with Demonika. Roadblock, an alien
        child who was adopted to give Speedbump some company
        during the day. And my new son SnowCrash who has
        recently taken to pissing on my couch cushions to
        show his love for me.

        An average of 5 diet cokes a day which totals
        about 9125 in five years. I bet there were more.

        157,680,000 seconds. That's roughly 4% of the average
        life span today.


        So what the hell did any of that have to do with anything?
Think back to the first year of the 'zine and look at the transition
it has gone through. Started by a 19 year old college dropout
just learning about life, and now going strong by a 24 year old
computer professional. Simply amazing when I think about it. Moreso
when you see the same fundamental thoughts and beliefs held by the
writers. On top of the drastic changes in my life, you can imagine
what some of the others have gone through.

        Five years, five hundred files, ninety six different writers,
and over four megs of text. Bruce Sterling's _The Hacker Crackdown_
is about 400k in ASCII format. That means the collected works of
F.U.C.K. is over ten times the length of that book. "Truly impressive"
is the first thing that comes to my mind. "Downright scary" the second
after I think about it. How many files are written about problems in our
lives or in society. What does that tell you about the perceived
world we live in? Tells me to be afraid. Very afraid.
