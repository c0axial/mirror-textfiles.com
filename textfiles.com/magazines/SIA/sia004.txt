This file shows a simple way to make homemade napalm.  Although
This is not the real formula it works just as well.

First you'll need:
1 large metal bucket.
Some styrofoam.
2 containers of Elmers glue.
GASOLINE!!
Bleach

Since the chemicals in this when mixed together form a hazardous gas
this should be done outside, do not inhail it use a gas mask or something
:). Take the styrofoam and put it in a pot and boil it to its melted now
pore the styrofoam in the bucket don't touch it!.  Take all the glue and dump
it in to the bucket.  Mix the bleach in.  Put the gasoline in and mix together
until it all forms one color.  Put the mixture in the fridge for about 2 days
when the 2 days are up you should see some really nasty shit put it in a 
plastic container or something and store it don't attempt to even touch it!
