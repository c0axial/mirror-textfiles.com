Chaos Corner

What you have here is a combination of Dr. Science (from National Public
Radio), Chaos Manor (from Byte), and Rumor Central (from PC Week).
 
Chaos Corner is a small, randomly published electronic newsletter I
write that mentions things I have found in the process of wandering
across the network.  Back copies are available, and a copy of Volume 1
and 2 (with an *index*) is available in PostScript form (via
ftp) or bound hardcopy with nice covers.
 
Volume 1 (10 issues) or volume 2 (11 issues) can be obtained as a
file with an index at the back.

Look in for the files ccv01.text (the ascii version) and ccv01.ps
(the PostScript version).  For volume 2, look for ccv02.ps or ccv02.text
Single issues can be obtained from the same place and are of the form
ccv0Xn0Y.txt where X is the volume number and Y is the issue number.
 
The issues for 1993 are volume 3.
