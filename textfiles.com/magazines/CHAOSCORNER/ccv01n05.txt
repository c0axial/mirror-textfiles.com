News from the Soviet Union

As this is being written, our news watcher has informed Dr. Chaos that the coup 
in the Soviet Union has collapsed, and Gorby is coming back to Moscow.  If you 
are interested in tracking current events on the follow-up, the newsgroups below 
are recommended (but not necessarily endorsed) by Dr. Chaos:

    soc.culture.soviet
    misc.headlines
    talk.politics.soviet

Other lists like soc.culture.german and soc.culture.polish may also have 
opinions expressed (Dr. Chaos urges me not to leave out alt.conspiracy as a 
source of opinion but not necessarily information).

--------------------------------------------------
Internet directory of services

Scott Yanoff at the University of Wisconsin has posted a very interesting guide 
to "special" services that are available across the Internet.  Because these 
services appeal so much to Dr. Chaos, we have decided to quote from Scott's 
list:

-Cleveland Freenet       telnet freenet-in-a.cwru.edu
  offers: USA Today Headline News

-Geographic Name Server  telnet martini.eecs.umich.edu 3000
  offers: Info by city or area code (Pop, Lat./Long., Elevation, etc)

-IRC Telnet Client       telnet 128.2.54.2

* NOTE: No login names or passwords required unless stated *

Dr. Chaos would like to take a little bit of space to thank the maintainers of 
the newsgroup comp.archives.  They scan a number of the other newsgroups looking 
for articles that announce interesting software or information being available 
for FTP access and publish that information in comp.archives.  The newsgroup was 
not active during the month of July and it has certainly made Dr. Chaos' job 
much easier to have it back again.  Thanks guys!

Inside CIt drops Chaos Corner from circulation!

Chaos Corner is no longer being carried in the internal CIT newsletter Inside 
CIT.  Their publication dates were too irregular to match any reasonably chaotic 
flow of information.  If you enjoy this service, consider passing it along to a 
friend.  Requests to be added to the direct distribution should go to 
rdc@cornella.cit.cornell.edu.

Bits, bauds, and bps

Gary Buhrmaster of Systems Programming Services in CIT is quite concerned that 
Dr. Chaos may have mislead you gentle readers in the last issue.  Since he has 
been very concerned that your inquiring minds get the correct information, I 
will quote from the text of his letter to Dr. Chaos:

I am sure you know the difference between bps (bits per second) 
and baud (the signal change rate per second).  Your fingers must 
have been trembling after your RT encounter.  In case it has 
become fuzzy, and because I know you want to provide correct 
information to your followers, perhaps you owe them a 
clarification.  In fact, most of the 9600 bps modems actually 
transmit at 2400 baud.  At each signal transition, four bits are 
represented in the new state.  Four bits per transition at 2400 
transitions per second and you get 9600 bps.  I am sure you also 
know that V.32bis is a standard for transmission at 14,400 bps 
(not 9600 bps as you implied).

My recollection from my days as an engineer was that 14,400 bps 
transmission was to use trellis encoding to reduce the number of 
errors in transmission (and actually transmits 5 bits per 
transition, resulting in a theoretical 19,200 bps, however the 
'extra' bits are used by the correction scheme).  I expect that is 
what V32bis eventually ended up 'standardizing'.

For those of you with a thirst for what V.32/V.32bis/V.42/V.42bis really mean 
... here is a summary of a summary written by Toby Nixon, a engineer for Hayes 
(the modem people) and a frequent contributor to the  comp.dcom.modems newsgroup 
on Usenet:

V.32 is the international standard for 4800 and 9600 bps 
modulation on dial-up and leased two-wire voice-grade circuits, 
both asynchronous and synchronous.  It was first standardized in 
1984.

V.32bis was adopted in February of 1991.  It is an upwardly-
compatible extension of V.32 that supports 4800, 7200, 9600, 
12000, and 14400 bps transmission on two-wire voice-grade 
circuits.  It also supports fast rate renegotiation, so that the 
modems can shift speeds rapidly in response to changing line 
conditions (whereas V.32 modems must go through a lengthy complete 
retrain cycle).

V.42 is the international standard for error control in modems.  
It defines two protocols: a primary protocol known as LAPM which 
is defined in the main body of the standard and is based on other 
internationally standardized protocols; and an alternative 
protocol defined in an Annex to the standard which provides for 
backward compatibility with MNP2-4 modems.  V.42 was adopted in 
November, 1988.

V.42bis is the international standard for data compression in 
modems.  It uses Lempel-Ziv techniques to achieve up to 4-to-1 
compression on text and other compressible files.

Relationships:  V.32bis is an upwardly compatible extension of 
V.32; they both define only a modulation scheme.  V.42 error 
control can be used with either V.32 or V.32bis.  V.42bis data 
compression is an  extension of V.42 LAPM; support for V.42bis 
implies support for V.42.

If that isn't more than you ever wanted to know about modems in a single 
sitting, then you'll do well on the mid-term exam (but Dr. Chaos claims you will 
have a real case of burn-out by the time of the final).

X-Windows under DOS

Dan Bartholomew of CIT's Research and Analysis Systems (aka SEX@CORNELLC) asks 
about packages for running X-Windows under DOS.  Dr. Chaos points out that the 
August 12, 1991 issue of PC Week carried a review of just those products.  
Although you may have heard rumors that they are slow, the testers found the 
performance of the leading products to be acceptable on a 33Mhz machine.  Dr 
Chaos has used only one of the products reviewed, and was relieved to see that 
the people at PC Week also had trouble getting it configured.

--------------------------------------------------
boustrophedon

Melinda Varian of Princeton provided the following REXX Exec from her CMS 
Pipelines presentation that is further proof of the value (?) of the 
boustrophedon:

/* BOUSTRO REXX:   Filter that writes records boustrophedon */

Signal On Error

Do recno = 1 by 1                      /* Do until EOF      */
   'readto record'                     /* Read from pipe    */
   If recno // 2 = 0                   /* If even-numbered  */
      Then record = Reverse(record)    /*    line, reverse  */
   'output' record                     /* Write to pipe     */
End

Error: Exit RC*(RC<>12)                /* RC = 0 if EOF     */

--------------------------------------------------
Correction for Unix tar example

Paul Zarnowski of Systems Programming Services in CIT gets the award for being 
awake (a cup of decaffinated coffee).  The rest of you need to sit on a tack for 
a while ... not having seen the example in issue number 3 giving the example for 
un-tar-ing a file with the command "tar -xvt glarch.tar" when it clearly should 
be "tar -xvf glarch.tar".  Congratulations to Paul (he just got back from 
vacation); and deepest regrets to the rest of you.  Dr Chaos claims that the 
Unix programmer corollary to the injunction "Have fun!" is "A misleading error 
message is more fun than no error message at all!"


Random and Self-Similar Things

--------------------------------------------------
USGS Maps available on CD-ROM

If you like maps, you must know that the U. S. Geological Survey is distributing 
their 1:2,000,000 scale maps on a CD-ROM.  The last reported price was $20 for 
data on all 50 states organized into 21 regions.  You need to have a PC with an 
EGA display and 512KB.  For more information contact:

   Earth Science Information Center
   U.S. Geological Survey
   507 National Center
   Reston, VA 22092
   Telephone: 703+648-6045  or 1+800+USA-MAPS (872-6277)

--------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM on Novell networks

Micro Design International has announced that they have the first CD-ROM drive 
certified for Novell networks.  If you are interested. try contacting: 

   Micro Design International, Inc.

More Pi than you can possibly eat

Do any of you have a passion for sweets?  If so, you can satisfy them at site 
ftp.pitt.edu where in the info/general directory they have the file pi.dat 
containing more than 1.25 MILLION digits of pi.  Dr Chaos suggests that you try 
plotting them to determine if you can discern a pattern.  Good luck!

--------------------------------------------------
Kaos (the real thing)

On the local front, Dr. Chaos reports on a program called Kaos (for sunview) 
written by Swan Kim and John Guckenheimer at Cornell to investigate dynamical 
systems.  Look for the files kaos_4.1.tar.Z and kaos_users_manual on 
marcy.tn.cornell.edu in the /pub directory.  Dr. Chaos has a report that an X-
windows version of the program will be available soon in the same place.  Does 
anyone have more detailed (or accurate) information?

--------------------------------------------------
Scientist's WorkBench

The Scientist's WorkBench project at the Cornell Theory Center is winding up
their -pre-beta testing (is that like alpha-plus?) and plan to have the beta 
version available on September 15, 1991.  If you haven't heard of SWB, it is an 
X-based application combining "tools to enhance the development, testing, and 
execution of scientific codes."  Binaries are available for IBM RS/6000 and 
SPARC workstations on eagle.tc.cornell.edu in the pub/swb directory.  Dr. Chaos 
suggests reading the file README.TOP for more information.

--------------------------------------------------
ISIS

For those of you interested in the ISIS distributed system developed in the 
Cornell Computer Science Department, it is still available on ftp.cs.cornell.edu 
(look for ISISV21.TAR.Z).  There are some patches/bug reports that are also 
available in that location.  Ken Birman reports that version is no longer 
supported at Cornell because they are all using the commercial version (ISIS 
V3.0.2) from ISIS Distributed Systems Inc.  There may be another free version 
(V2.2) but it will take 6-8 weeks of time and as yet there is no estimated 
release date.

--------------------------------------------------
Security and good passwords

For those Systems Administrators that want to keep up on security by making sure 
your users have not chosen easy-to-guess passwords, crack 3.1 is currently 
available from wuarchive.wustl.edu in the /packages directory under the name 
crack3.1.tar.Z.  Dr. Chaos claims that a newer version "that can take apart 
systems in just a few minutes" is being worked on and will be available "real 
soon now."

--------------------------------------------------
Programming contest

Once again this fall, Duke University will be sponsoring a Internet Programming 
Contest and is soliciting problems to use in the contest.  The problems should 
be solvable in C or Pascal in less than 4 hours and the preference is for the 
"algorithmically challenging" type (as opposed to coding long tables, etc.).  
Send potential problems to ola@cs.duke.edu.  More information about the contest 
itself will be available at a later date.

--------------------------------------------------
Startrek

For those Startrek fans among you, Dr. Chaos reports the availability of the 
Lists of Lists for both versions of the show are available at ftp.cs.widener.edu 
in the pub/strek directory -- look for tos_lists and tng_lists.  A summery of 
each show is included along with original air dates, episodes in which Picard 
violated the Prime Directive, and mistakes/inconsistencies that people have 
caught.  Similar information is available for the Simpson's in the pub/simpsons 
directory.

--------------------------------------------------
Weather GIFs

Dr. Chaos was excited to see a posting on19Aug claiming that there were some 
nice gif images from the weather satellite showing hurricane Bob.  The bad news 
is that they are stored on a computer at the University of Rhode Island -- and 
they haven't been on the network since some time on that day (attempts to reach 
uriacc.uri.edu still get the "network is unreachable" message).  All is not 
lost, Dr. Chaos manages to get a satellite image from vmd.cso.uiuc.edu (in the 
phil.515 directory) that shows Hurricane Bob approximately centered over Rhode 
Island.  Look on pelican.cit.cornell.edu (our Unix home-away-from-home) in the 
/pub/gif directory for the file ts-bob.gif.

--------------------------------------------------
PC Fractal software

On the PC front, the popular fractal generating program FRACTINT is now at 
version 16.11 and is available at wuarchive.wustl.edu in the 
/mirrors/msdos/graphics directory under the name of frai1611.zip (fras1611.zip 
for the source).

--------------------------------------------------
PC computers and keeping the right date

If you have noticed that leaving your PC on overnight means that the date 
doesn't get updated at midnight, here is just the program for you.  On a 
periodic basis, CLOCKDEV reads the battery-backed clock chip to verify that the 
DOS date/time agree with it.  Dr. Chaos has installed this program on puffin and 
found it worked like a charm ... the date is now correct when he arrives in the 
morning.  Look for file clkdev14.zip on wuarchive.wustl.edu in the 
/mirrors/msdos/sysutl directory.

--------------------------------------------------
OS/2 beta test

Since Dr. Chaos has received an early evaluation copy of OS/2 2.0, he has gotten 
interested in archives of OS/2 software.  The most promising appears to be mims-
iris.waterloo.edu (in the os2/* directories).  He promises more info later after 
he has a chance to investigate further.

--------------------------------------------------
Hex, octal, ascii comversion tables

Tired of looking up the hex/octal/decimal values for various ascii characters?  
Xascii is a small application that displays those values for the whole ascii 
character set and is available from ftp.eng.auburn.edu.  Get the file 
xascii.tar.Z from the /pub directory.  For Windows 3.0 users, Dr. Chaos 
recommends ACHART from wuarchive.wustl.edu in the mirrors/msdos/windows3 
directory stored as achart12.zip.

--------------------------------------------------
CPU utilization under Windows

Speaking of Windows 3.0 software... there is an updated version of the 
Performance Meter utility (it shows a moving graph of you CPU utilization) that 
uses the keep-in-front option.  Look for perfm202.zip on cica.cica.indiana.edu 
in the /pub/pc/win3/util directory.

--------------------------------------------------
Windows and win32

At a Windows 3 conference last week, Microsoft distributed a white paper 
detailing the Windows 32-bit API and products that would contain it.  A 
compressed PostScript file containing the paper is on uunet.uu.net in the 
/vendor/microsoft/isv-communications directory.  Look for file ntwn32.zip (or 
ntwn32.txt for text-only).  Dr. Chaos reports that he also found in the same 
directory the file win31be.zip which appears to be a compressed form of an 
application to beta-test Microsoft Windows 3.1.  (I can hear the keys clicking 
away even as I write this.)

--------------------------------------------------
Jargon and TLA

Confused by all the jargon in this business? Do you find that the person next 
door to you speaks a different set of TLAs than you do?  A new, updated version 
of the Jargon File is available from mc.lcs.mit.edu in the pub/jargon directory
(look for jargon296.ascii or, for the compressed version, jargon296.ascii.Z).

Out of space and mostly out of time for this issue.  Please keep those 
electronic cards and letters coming in ... remember! Dr. Chaos (rdc)
at cornella.cit.cornell.edu -- we all thank you!
