    Well, here is the long awaited issue #11 of the 411 newsletter.  Sorry for 
the wait,  but lack of time on my part and the general laziness of most of the 
411 members delayed this issue a little...  It's kind of small,  but the first 
results of the grand scan have been included,  so I guess that makes up for it 
a little...  As usual,  any and all  contributions are welcome,  but  must  be 
original  and decent  in content.  Also,  to continue the  grand scan,  please 
send the results of any  scans you may have done, whether they are 800 numbers 
or in your local area code.  Any and all contributions are always appreciated.  
Other than that, there's not much more to say...

        Firebug...

                                 C O C O T s
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~
    I realize  there  are many  articles  that have already  been  written  on 
COCOTs, but hey, what's one more, right?...

    First off,  COCOT stands  for  Customer  Owned  Coin  Operated  Telephone.  
Basically,  it is just  a payphone owned by  someone other than the  telephone 
company.  They can easily be recognized by the absence of the  Bell  logo that 
is on all Telco-owned payphones.

    Basically,  businesses buy these to make a few extra  bucks,  and they can 
usually be found at hotels, gas stations, and places such as Duncan Donuts and 
Stewarts.  Other  distinguishing  features of a  COCOTs are robotic  or crappy 
sounding recordings, and higher rates for calls, both local and long distance.

    In Bell owned payphones,  the phone is run  off of a special  line and all 
billing is controlled  at the central office,  but since  COCOTs are privately 
owned,  they are run off  of a regular customer  loop.  Therefor,  all billing 
must  be  controlled  within  the  COCOT,  within  it's  microprocessor.  This 
microprocessor does some other interesting things,  too.  When you pick up the 
receiver of a COCOT to dial,  you don't hear a real dialtone,  but the COCOT's 
own  internally  generated  dial tone.  This way,  it appears to  be  a normal 
dialtone-first payphone,  but can then ask  you for the money  before actualy 
dialing the number.  After the number has been dialed and the proper amount of 
money has been inserted,  you can usually hear the  number being dialed in the 
background.  So  that's  how  a  COCOT  is supposed to work.  Now for the "big 
mistake"...

    By law, the  owner isn't allowed to charge you for a call to  911 or to an 
800 number.  It obviously wouldn' t be too  smart to fool around with 911,  so 
we'll concentrate on our other option.  When you first pick up the phone,  you 
hear the fake dialtone.  You then dial  the number and it will  calculate  the 
proper billing, then connect you.  If the number is an 800 number however,  it 
will disable the billing  for that call.  When you hang up,  it will reset the 
billing.

    However,  most COCOTs will not reset the billing until  the phone has been 
placed back on hook - in other words,  when you  physically hang up the phone.  
As most people know,  if the called party hangs up  first but you stay  on the 
line,  the dialtone will be reset after  a maximum of about 15 seconds.  Since 
you are on a  normal customer loop,  the same applies to COCOTs.  The catch is 
that is  isn't the  COCOT's  internally  generated  dialtone,  it  is  a  real 
unrestricted dialtone, meaning that you may now dial any number that you would 
be  able to  dial from home,  but without  being charged,  and the  phone will 
remain in this state until the phone is physically hung up.

    If making free calls  from a COCOT is so simple to do,  wouldn't you think 
that  the  manufacturers  of  COCOTs would have fixed  this loop hole  by now?  
Well, that is what this next section is devoted to...

1.  After the called party hangs up, the keypad is disabled.  This seemed like 
    a pretty  good solution to  the problem,  but it wasn't.  To  bypass  this 
    security measure,  simply dial with an external  keypad such as one of the 
    two autodialers available at Radio Shack.

2.  Billing  resets when new  dial tone is detected.  Again,  it seemed like a 
    pretty  airtight  way  to prevent the  abuse of COCOTs,  but can easily be 
    bypassed.  Simply blow or  hiss loudly into the mouthpiece as the dialtone 
    is being reset.  This prevents the phone from  being able to recognize the 
    dial tone because of  all of the  white noise you  are adding to the line.  
    Then just at  the moment you stop  hissing,  dial the first digit  of  the 
    number you are dialing.  The dialtone  will disappear and  you may proceed 
    to dial the rest of the number.

    I have seen different combinations  of  the above-mentioned  features,  as 
well  as COCOTs  with  none of those  features that won't  allow the use of an 
external tone dialer,  which I found surprising.  Then there are the ones that 
simply won't reset the dialtone after your call, which although disappointing, 
would suggest that they've finally beaten us...
