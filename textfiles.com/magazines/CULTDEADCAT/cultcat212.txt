HoHoCon '94 
December 29, 1994 - January 2, 1995
Ramada Inn South, Austin, TX
A Review, released to the Net on 1/25/95
By Netta "grayarea" Gilboa  
  
  I flew to Austin, TX after spending Christmas with some hacker friends. 
I arrived a day early, unsure if the Con was gonna come off and how many 
people would show if it did. HoHoCon had almost been cancelled this year 
after someone called the original hotel and said a bunch of mean, evil 
hackers were gonna descend on the hotel and that several federal agencies 
would be sending feds there to monitor it. If you ask me, some kid's mom 
said he couldn't go so he decided to try to make sure none of us could 
either. Lame. It also taught me that everyone in this community has 
enemies. Maybe someone just doesn't like Drunkfux. Supposedly, right after 
this phone call the hotel got another, this time from Dateline NBC who 
wanted permission to film the Con. Rumor had it the hotel panicked and 
cancelled. The truth is that a regular client of theirs offered to pay 
higher room rates and the hotel stood to make over $20,000 extra by 
getting rid of us and having them there instead. So they used the phone 
calls as an excuse. I can only imagine the hassles Drunkfux went 
through to find another hotel that was empty on New Year's Eve weekend.
   But Drunkfux came through with flying colors and when I got to the 
hotel they told me other people had started to arrive. They gave me a 
list of these people to look at, complete with their real names and room 
numbers. It's possible they would even have xeroxed the list if I had 
asked them to. Uncool. Even more uncool, almost shocking, was that the 
hotel had a clipboard on the counter with people's real names, assigned 
room number and credit card number complete with expiration date. It was 
listed in alphabetical order and I was on the top page in the third spot. 
I freaked. I told the woman behind the counter that she must move the 
clipboard as some of the people coming specialized in attacking people's 
credit and that I would surely be a target given my position on the list 
and my all too well-known real name. She said okay but when I returned my 
luggage cart, some twenty minutes later, it was still on the counter. I 
told her again, nastier this time, to move it. An hour later she still had 
not. I then asked to use a phone and was told there was one in my room and 
another down the hall. I explained that I wanted to call right from the 
counter to cancel my credit card and to call the national offices of Ramada 
Inns to have her fired. In a nasty tone she told me she'd move the clipboard. 
She did. However, the next day they threw the pages in the trash and, of 
course, had the clipboard on the counter again with a new list of the people 
due to check in that day. I argued with them again and they moved it. A few 
hours later (surprise!) their trash was invaded and they went out and bought 
two paper shredders. This was a good investment on their part although it's 
a shame it took us to teach them that. If you intend to stay at a Ramada Inn 
anywhere in the U.S., I would strongly advise you not to prepay with a credit 
card. They can't be trusted with your data. We invite readers who may have 
experienced credit card fraud after staying at Ramada Inns (or other hotels) 
to contact us. It was a sobering lesson in how vulnerable the average person 
is in society.
   I had plans to hook up with Stormbringer and Holy Spirit, two virus 
writers I love talking to. Stormbringer had recently retired from virus 
writing after hearing from someone in Singapore who got infected with 
one of his non-malicious viruses. I had read his retirement text file and 
was anxious to talk to him about it. He assured me on the phone all was well 
and they agreed to meet me at Mr. Wasabi for sushi and I ate more sushi 
than I ever had before in one sitting. Then we walked to a coffee house 
and they drove me back to my hotel around 1 a.m. 
   I was invited to Novocain and Particle's room so I headed up there and 
ran into Veggie, Onkel Ditmeyer, Count Zero, Buckaroo, etc. Onkel showed 
me his way cool laptop and I finally got to see what an IBM demo looks 
like. These are programs which demonstrate the sound and graphics 
capabilities of a computer. He copied a few of them on a disk for me along 
with some electronic magazines I had never seen. Onkel is the author of a 
well known phreaking program called Bluebeep. We spoke a lot over the 
weekend and I found him brilliant, honest, charming and not afraid of 
girls who know way less than him. He was one of the coolest people at 
HoHoCon this year.
   At 6 a.m. a few of us went downstairs for free breakfast and the 
conversation turned to the various women who hang out on #hack. There 
was some dissing of one girl who has slept her way around the scene and 
in the past had given a number of hackers herpes without telling them 
first. Eeks. I tried to get out of the guys I was eating with what she 
had that I didn't (besides herpes). I message most of her old lovers on 
IRC but none has ever made a pass at me. We talked about the other girls 
on IRC, who has slept with whom, and how they got treated afterwards. We 
talked about why people might have slept with those particular girls at 
the time they did and I suddenly felt both very lucky and better about 
myself that the one hacker I had slept with was a decent choice. Quality 
might beat quantity. To know for sure, I guess I'd have to ask the girls 
<wink>.
  We picked up a bunch of food that was apparently not included in our 
free breakfast coupon. The waitress didn't know how to handle it and 
neither did we. I offered to put the food back and she finally agreed to 
let us eat it. I suggested they put up a sign to warn others and, of 
course, they didn't. Later I heard they let us all eat the bacon and other 
food for the rest of the Con. I never made it back down there again even 
though for American food it was pretty good. I was pretty tired and so 
headed off to sleep when we were done chowing down.
   I woke up Friday afternoon when Particle and Novocain knocked on the 
door. They had a car and took me to a chinese restaurant nearby with a 
killer buffet. When we got back there were many people in the lobby 
listening to a tape of prank phone calls made by Phone Losers of America. 
I wanted the tape bad as it seemed highly appropriate for us to review. 
I was promised a copy which materialized in under an hour. W0rd! For all 
the shit I take for it, there are advantages to being press. 
  I felt pretty comfortable with all of the people I was talking to and 
since my room was very close to the lobby I invited everyone there and 
even left the door open for others to enter my room (which almost 
everyone who passed by did). It was kind of odd where they had situated 
me. You could watch my door from the counter where people checked in. I 
had asked for a smoking room but got dealt non-smoking instead. I 
inquired about changing it and was told some crap about all the rooms 
being accounted for already. It crossed my mind at the time that maybe 
some feds had purposely put me there but I discounted my gut feeling and 
remembered most hackers thought I was too paranoid about things. I told 
people to go ahead and smoke in my room with no ashtray. They did. All 
told about 15 people were in there and one of them pulled out a toy
to show me. It was a box that hooked up to your telephone which allowed 
you to change your voice into that of a male, female or child. I had seen 
these boxes before in catalogs. They sure work great! I made two calls 
with it, one to a friend and one to my ex-husband. I snickered at how 
surprised they'd be when they heard my message and later regretted not 
telling either or them to save it so I could hear it back. Honestly, 
playing with this legal box was every bit as cool as great drugs or sex. 
I vowed to buy one. Watch out!
   Talk turned to dinner and people started to leave my room. Particle was 
the last one out and he showed me something about how the hotel room locks 
worked. Hackers spend hours trying to figure out how things work and 
although I had little interest in the subject it was clear Particle was  
struck by the techonology and not the idea of breaking into someone's 
room. I started to organize people who were willing to eat sushi. Just as 
we were about to leave Particle and Novocain were gathering everyone into 
a room to tell people to chill their behavior. It later turned out that 
Particle had played with another lock after I made him stop touching 
mine. He had the misfortune to be seen by a member of the Austin Police 
Department who wisely agreed not to arrest him in exchange for Particle's 
agreeing to talk to people in an attempt to curtail the usual HoHoCon 
hotel destruction. I should have attended this talk although I had no 
idea at the time why it was being organized. But I was starving and
the people I took to eat sushi were not those who would consider trashing 
a hotel. Laughing Gas, Thumper27, Slyme, El_Jefe and I checked out Kyoto 
sushi which was good but expensive for what you got. I spent part of dinner 
wiping the free space on the hard drive on my laptop. I had never used 
this feature before, but had been told about it at the con and it sounded 
like something I should start doing regularly to protect other people's 
privacy so that erased E-mail and articles were truly erased. It was a 
good thing I had sushi to eat to keep me busy as it took a good twenty 
minutes to do on a Pentium laptop with a 500+ meg hard drive.
   When we got back to the hotel I ran into Drunkfux who had cut his 
hair and dyed it bright red. I hardly recognized him but it looked great. 
It was clear by the police presence in the lobby that the Con had 
officially started. We were told that signs hung on room doors (I had 
put up a copy of one of the magazine covers with a small piece of scotch 
tape) would be taken down. This made it much harder for us to find each 
other (I'd estimate we had 90% of the hotel's rooms) but so it goes. 
Some people were told specifically that they could not use their modems 
and for hours on Friday night the phone lines were so busy with modem 
usage that there was no way to make an outgoing call or to receive an 
expected incoming one. All sorts of security guards appeared. The ones 
I spoke with were police officers too. I'd guess there were 1-3 dozen
around at all times and apparently hotel personnel were told they were 
all on duty until we left and none of them were able to go home for the 
rest of the weekend. I wish I could say this was utterly unwarranted. 
But some lamer broke the lock on the door to the hotel's phone system. 
And remember that another person had trashed the hotel's garbage and 
must have made a mess or been spotted. 
   The hot party that night was in Erik Bloodaxe's room. Loki, Ice-9 
and Ophie were staying with him and Loki was in charge of the door. 
He made sure to keep me out just as he does when he acts like a bully 
on IRC. I knew in my heart it was Loki's doing not ErikB's, but that 
didn't stop me from getting majorly upset about it anyway. I went 
downstairs to be alone and Particle knocked on the door a few minutes 
later. I gave him a piece of my mind and then some about how shitty 
some of those in the computer underground are. I went on for at least 
an hour and drew great comfort from the fact Particle thought I was not 
crazy and that things are as awful as they seem sometimes. Finally
he told me that since I kept claiming to love hackers despite all of the 
grief, there were dozens of nice ones out there who would be thrilled to 
talk to me if I'd only leave my room and go try to have a good time. W0rd. 
I took his advice and had a good time in the lobby with the other rejects 
from Bloodaxe's party. The conversation was so good it was hard to tear 
away to go to sleep. I went to my room at 4:30 a.m., got under the covers, 
thought about sleep for 10 seconds. Then I pulled out my laptop and wrote 
a speech to deliver to the crowd the next day.
   The two people I had counted on to wake me up didn't show and it was a
stroke of luck that made me jump up at 9:45. The speeches were supposed to
start at 10 a.m. and even though they surely wouldn't start till later I 
was selling magazines and was due there pronto to claim my table. It took a
luggage cart to get all those magazines downstairs. I shudder to think what
my life will be like when I have 30 issues to lug around instead of six.
The folks from Fringeware were selling books and T-shirts and someone else
had old Atari game units and cartridges. People came by to say hi and to 
buy magazines. I plugged my speech and told people not to dare miss it. 
   It was impressive that Drunkfux had gotten so many original speakers 
on such short notice. They mostly said what the crowd wanted to hear and 
shared thoughts on digital cash, the regulation of the Internet, recent 
laws, etc. Damien Thorn showed a video clip to the tune of the current 
rock hit "21st Century Digital Boy" which had cellular phones, scanners, 
etc. in it. It's part of an upcoming video that looked awesome. Veggie 
talked about dealing with the media after an old text file of his was 
used to harass a BBS sysop who got more than twice Phiber's jail sentence 
just for having a file around.
   Someone sent Erik Bloodaxe to talk to me as part of my speech referred 
to him. It was an uncomfortable talk and I was probably correct in feeling 
that half the room was watching us and not whoever was speaking. I told 
him he could pay me back in print or elsewhere but that I was going to 
go ahead with what I planned to say and he surprised me by saying that 
what I had written was fine and he even added to it. He also told me 
that Loki had gotten too drunk and had been a pain in the ass to room 
with the night before. He assured me that although way too many people 
had been in his room, and way too many had tried to get in after it was 
full, it had not been his intention to keep me out. I felt bad that I 
even cared, and that he knew I cared, and that he and I even had to 
discuss it. I was unhapy that he had no intention of staying to hear my 
speech or the fight with Loki that he knew was coming but didn't 
mention to me. We left things with the fact that we'd go out for dinner 
or something the next night with Ophie (who also had an early flight) 
after the bulk of the Con was over. It occured to me then it would never 
happen because plans are hard to keep at Cons but I mentioned it in my 
speech anyway.
   My speech went over very well. It was about what's been going on at 
Gray Areas since I spoke at HoHoCon last year. It was also about the 
behavior of certain elements of the community and how that behavior has 
affected me. And it was a stern warning about some busts that are coming 
down. I know a few people got the message. I could tell from the gasps 
and laughter at key points. But perhaps the highlight of the speech was 
the confrontation between Loki and I when he chose to bully me before 
anyone else could ask a question. I answered his accusations and managed 
to do a decent job even with no warning. Whatever he hoped to accomplish 
clearly wasn't working and from somewhere deep inside of me I found the 
courage to ask the entire room to vote on whether or not they really 
never wanted to see me on #hack again. The only vote opposed in a room of 
about 250-300 people was Loki's. Hours later I regretted not thinking to 
ask how many people never wanted to see Loki there again. Four people had 
come up to me and told me they would have voted him out. Loki left the 
room with his tail between his legs and ran to IRC. By the time I got on
hours later word had spread a story that I picked a fight with him and 
he had won. The proof is in the videotape which will be available soon 
from Drunkfux. It's highly recommended for both friends and foes of mine. 
Drunkfux said demand for this portion of his footage was very high. I 
promised to give him better footage and an even better speech next year.
   Later Count Zero wrote this about my speech in Cult of the Dead Cow: 
"Grayarea gets up and begins to read off a pre-prepared speech on her 
laptop. Her speech is too quick for my alcohol-byproduct-sodden synapses 
to register accurately. I keep staring at her dress...bright tie-dye...
mesmerizing...it's actually quite cool. Suddenly, Loki gets up in the 
audience and the accusations fly back and forth between them. You kicked 
me off IRC. You called my office at work. You are doing this, you are 
doing that. Both are getting into this verbal slugfest in a major way. 
I feel the bad karma in the room hanging heavy like blue-green cigar 
smoke. "Can't we all just get along??" I yell, but noone seems to hear 
me. I don't know who is right or wrong (it's probably somewhere in 
between...the truth's always gray, right?), so I don't hypothesize. All I 
do know is that I'd never want to piss off Grayarea...she's damn strong 
on her convictions and won't take shit from anyone. I think she'd look 
better up there wearing a big ol' leather jacket with studs...terminator 
style. "One tends to assume that people wearing tie-dye gear are quiet, 
meek, very soft spoken, non-confrontational types....it is a camoflage 
that suits her well," I think. Bahaha! I liked your comments, Count Zero. 
And I did hear you yell that.   
   After the speeches I sold more magazines thanks to Loki who 
inadvertently made way more people interested in me. Bahahaha! Some of 
them said they liked or loved my dress, some of them hugged me and some 
of them signed up for subscriptions and gave me their data. I then 
headed off for dinner at yet another sushi restaurant. Laughing Gas 
and Slyme came again along with Mr. Spock who agreed to lose his sushi 
virginity to me and jokingly said that way he'd get mentioned in my 
review. I thought he was one of the three kewlest people I hung out with 
at the Con. I hope I get to spend more time with him at a Con in the 
future and I'd even be willing to go try his favorite type of food! The 
sushi place we picked was awesome. I was sorry I hadn't found it
sooner. It's almost too bad HoHoCon will be in another city next year. 
I also wanna mention the elite, Jak_Flack, who drove us to the restaurant 
when cabs were scarce on New Year's Eve. He didn't want any sushi or 
any money. He even got lucky and gave a ride to people who probably 
would have done the same thing for him under the same circumstances. 
Thanks.
   After dinner I did what Drunkfux begged us not to do. I spent New 
Year's Eve on IRC. I messaged Mr. Spock, in fact, who was typing from 
the other side of the room. I also messaged some hackers I talk to all 
the time. Some were lonely and glad to see me. I thought a lot about 
loneliness. Some of us prefer to be with computers than people. Some of 
us can open up more easily to people on a computer. And some of us need 
computers around even when we're with other people. I was typing from an 
account at hohocon.org and there were several people in the room having 
fun with their "site" as X and Y tried repeatedly (and succeeded) to get 
root there. I had never seen root before from the position of the person 
protecting it. I should have paid way more attention but I got too caught 
up in having conversations. I should also have paid more attention to the 
people in the room with me. Loq and Fool were there and they seemed really 
kewl but I got too lost in IRC. Oh well, at least I wasn't hopelessly 
drunk. And I wasn't kicked or banned once. People were delicate with each 
other on IRC. They were often drunk, vulnerable and more likely to reveal 
things when conversing. Those who were on were more than willing to talk 
to anyone who showed up. People apparently intend to make public the 
hohocon.org logs. If they include IRC chats it would be very shallow. I 
will never again take the chance and IRC from a Con again. Although I have 
mostly come to terms with the fact that I am a semi-public figure and 
people will always want to see whatever I type on the Net, but it's not 
fair to expose the words of the people I messaged. 
   I dragged myself off IRC about 4:30 a.m. and went downstairs to clean 
off one of the beds. Novocain and Particle had checked out of their room 
and were gonna stay in my room for one night. I was thrilled at the idea 
of having company. But when the bed was empty it looked tempting and I 
lay down for the 90 minutes till I was due to meet them at the breakfast 
buffet. Next thing I knew it was Sunday afternoon. Oops! I wondered where 
they had slept. Apparently they hadn't wanted to wake me so they slept 
in another room. I felt bad but at least their stuff had been safe which 
is all you really care about at a Con. SORRY! Next time, guys, wake me.
   I stumbled into the lobby and joined the conversations that were going 
on. A hotel employee asked if we'd mind moving to the conference room and 
we agreed. We figured the room was bugged just as the hotel phone lines 
had been. But we weren't talking about anything secret and a few of the 
hackers answered all of the questions asked by the cop/security guard who 
hung out for about half of the time we were in there. It was a very fun 
time there on the floor chatting with Voyager, Ophie, Onkel Ditmeyer, lgas, 
Deadkat, Drunkfux, etc. There were way more people but I'm drawing a blank 
on specifically who. I went upstairs to get more magazines and ran into 
Bruce Sterling. He was growing facial hair and looked great. He said he 
felt lousy which shows what I know. I hugged him before he said he felt 
lousy. We talked about the book he is working on. Then Ophie and I went 
off to be interviewed about female hackers and the treatment of women by 
hackers. It could have used Cori and Noelle but it made some good points. 
We came downstairs and I saw Drunkfux at work videotaping an interview 
with the guys from TNO in Colorado. This was priceless footage of them 
discussing how a group decides policies and handles politics and how they 
have applied political thought to hacking. I was sorry I had missed half 
of it and sorry I had spent so much time socializing with them that it 
had never occured to me I didn't know much about their group and I should 
have interviewed them too. I hope Drunkfux includes every word of their 
interview in the video. 
   Ophie brought up the idea of photos and so I grabbed my camera. 
Everyone there got into it and I got a whole roll of film of people 
hugging and kissing me, looking at porn mags with Ophie and generally 
playing around somehow. They came out great. If you want yours passed 
around or published, let me know. Until then, they're private.
   Slyme and I headed back to Mr. Wasabi for dinner but to our surprise 
it was closed! New Year's day turned out to be a bad day to try to find 
places open to serve food. We should have stayed at the hotel. We finally 
ended up in a bar which served food, ordered hot chocolate and consoled 
ourselves on the lack of sushi. Back at the hotel a bunch of us went 
room hopping and tried to determine who was left. My flight was at 7 a.m. 
and I had no intention of going to sleep and taking a chance I would miss 
it. Several people had flights at 8 and 10 a.m. Others were staying on 
for 3 more days to get better airfare rates. I heard ErikB had left with 
Ophie and he told me later they had asked the hotel and had been told I 
checked out. One room we ended up in had a console copier running. I had 
heard about them but never seen one and was told it was okay if I 
photographed it. I went downstairs for my camera.
   I hadn't been alone once since arriving in Austin. While this wasn't 
always planned, the thought did occur to me that my room might be watched 
and that law enforcement might be interested in any of the many people 
I was seen talking to. I had mentioned a controversial interview we had 
coming up with ILF and although I thought I was being overly paranoid, I 
was still nervous I would be questioned about it. But it was 12:30 a.m. 
or so and I felt too silly asking for someone to run downstairs with me. 
So I went alone. But as I was closing the door and checking it was locked 
I saw someone head down the hall towards me and I knew instantly something 
was about to be up. Hackers are right when they say you can't fully 
understand this until you have lived it. He asked if I was Netta and I 
said yes and then he reached towards his pocket. I knew he was going for 
either a gun or a badge and there was nothing I could do about either. 
It turned out to be a badge and as he got close enough so that I could 
see it read "Austin Police Department" I thought to myself "Kewl, it's 
not the Secret Service." He asked me to accompany him to a room and, 
holding my camera, I did. He told the two "security guards" that we'd be 
leaving the door open. I had asked whether he was the guy who had
called me last March and he said no that he was his partner. I wondered 
whether I was under investigation or whether they had no one else to ask 
for information or whether they just wanted to meet me after talking to 
me voice. It didn't occur to me to ask. I thought several times about the 
fact I was supposed to be out with Bloodaxe and Ophie and that if I had 
made it a point to leave with them this wouldn't be happening. I wondered 
who else APD had questioned who had not told anyone. I wondered if they had 
even questioned someone about me. I also feared people would come looking 
for me and see me in that room and think I was talking to the police 
voluntarily. That I had sought them out. God forbid they should think I 
was telling the police about the console copier. 
   The whole thing only took about 8 minutes and the officer asked me 
nothing I had a problem answering. He treated me with respect and didn't 
press me to say anything I wasn't comfortable saying. I offered to give 
him some of my magazines at the end of the conversation and he walked me 
to my room and was clearly planning to wait outside. I invited him in and 
he watched me pull issues from three suitcases. It was apparent nothing 
illegal had gone on in my room. I'd lay odds it was the cleanest room 
there too. The day before, for example, my trash in the bathroom had 
been dumped at least three times. None were by me or when I was in the 
room. The only thing I couldn't answer, and it was simply from nerves, 
was what I had done on New Year's Eve. The answer came out that I didn't 
remember and since I stammered it, it must have looked like I had seen or 
done something I shouldn't have. But all I did was IRC and eat sushi and 
I do that so often I didn't even remember when asked. New Year's Eve had 
been almost like any other night. 
   Anyway, I got the console copier photo (hint: I could use a detailed 
article on how they work to run with it). We then moved on to other rooms 
and I ran into Drunkfux and Damien Thorn. I did a long video interview 
with Drunkfux, who would have made an excellent journalist. He resisted 
the idea of asking me petty questions about who I like and don't like in 
the scene and who I'd sleep with if I could. I would have answered 
anything he asked in the spirit of the HoHoCon video tradition, but 
instead we got into more serious issues and people who think Drunkfux is 
shallow or a less-than-serious dude due to his IRC reputation will be most 
surprised. 
   Then Damien did an equally long interview and Drunkfux got eleet footage 
of me closing my eyes when the talk got too technical. I did almost pass 
out as it was 3 a.m. or so and I felt really comfortable being with them 
but I snapped to attention just in the nick of time as Drunkfux had the 
camera aimed on me and Damien was making a joke. Damien took it in stride 
but I think it was the first time anyone had ever had the chance to listen 
to his most eleet technical tips and was bored. I hope he knows I love him, 
like most hackers, for the person he is and not for the skills or trophies 
he has. I was transfixed as he told Drunkfux his beginnings in the computer 
underground and his views on laws, ethics, writing, etc. I just don't lust 
to know what model of phones he respects most or what gadget he's tested 
last. Luckily for you, Drunkfux did the interview, not me, and he did ask 
lots on that sort of stuff. After they were done Damien and I went out to 
some fast food burger joint. It was dirt cheap and tasted like cardboard. 
We had a great chat, as usual, and then went to the airport with Slyme who 
had slept the night away and missed everything. My flight was first and 
they walked me to the gate and made a fuss over me and it was the perfect 
ending. 
   I can't believe I now have to wait till June (and go to Georgia, of 
all places) to see some of you again. Oh well. In the meantime, happy 
Valentine's Day to you and whoever you netsex and/or fantasize about. 
Happy April Fool's Day in advance too. Just prank someone else this year, 
okay? <grin>.

   AFTER DINnER I DID WHAT DRUNKFUx BEGGeD UZ N0T T0 D0. I SpENT NEW 
YEAR'Z EVE 0N IRC. I MESSAGED MR. Sp0CK, iN FACT, WH0 WAZ TYPiNG FR0M 
THE 0THER SIDE 0F THE R00M. I ALS0 MeSSAGEd S0ME HACKERZ I TALk T0 ALL

L0NELINESS. S0Me 0F UZ PREFER T0 BE WiTH K0mPUTERZ THAN PE0PLE. S0ME 0F 
UZ CAN 0PEN UP m0RE EASILY T0 PE0PLE 0N A K0MPUTER. AND S0ME 0F UZ NEED

FUN WITH THEIR "sITE" AZ X AND Y TRIED REPEAtEDLY (AND SUCCEEDED) T0 GET 
R00T THERE. I HAd NEVER SEEN R00T BEF0rE FR0m THE P0SITI0N 0F THe PERS0N 
PR0TECTING IT. I sH0ULD HAVE PAID WAY M0RE ATtENTI0N BUT I G0T T00 CAUGHT 
UP IN HAVING K0NVeRSATI0NS. I SH0ULD ALs0 HAVe PAID M0RE ATTENTI0n T0 THE 
PE0PLE IN THE R00M WITH ME. L0Q AND F00L WERE tHERE AND THEY SEEMEd REALLY 
KEWL BUT I G0t T00 L0ST IN IRC. 0H wELL, aT LEAST I WASN'T H0pELESSLY 
DRUNK. AND I WASN'T KICKED 0R BANNED 0NcE. PE0PLE WERE DELICATE WiTH EACH

THINGZ WHEN K0NVeRSING. TH0SE WH0 WERE 0N WErE M0RE THAN WILLING T0 TALK 
T0 ANY0NE WH0 SH0WED UP. PE0PLE APpARENTlY INTEND T0 MAKE PUbLIC THE 
H0H0K0N.0RG L0Gs. IF THEY INCLUDE IRC CHATZ IT W0ULD BE VERY SHaLL0W. I 
WILL NEVER AGAIN TaKE THE CHANCE AND IRC FR0M a K0N AGAIN. ALTH0UGh I HAVE 
M0STLY K0ME T0 TERMZ WITH THE FACT tHAT I AM A SEMI-PUBLIC FIgURE AND 
PE0PLE WILL ALWaYZ WANT T0 SEE WHATEVeR I TyPE 0N THE NET, BUT iT'Z N0T

LAY D0WN F0R THE 90 MINUTEZ TILL I WAZ DUE T0 MEET THEM AT THE BrEAKFAST 
BUFFET. NEXT THINg I KNEW IT WAZ SUNDAY AFTERn00N. 00PS! I W0NDEReD WHERE

HACKERZ ANSWERED aLL 0F THE QUESTI0NZ AsKED By THE K0P/SECURITY GuARD WH0 
HUNG 0UT F0R AB0UT HALF 0F THE TIME We WERE IN THERE. IT WAZ A vERY FUN

WE CAME D0WNSTaIRZ AND I SAW DRUNKFUx AT W0RK VIDE0TAPING AN InTERVIEW

INTERVIEW IN THe VIDE0. 
   0PHIE Br0UGHT UP THE IDEA 0F pH0T0Z AND S0 I GRABBED MY CAMERA. 
EVERY0NE THeRE G0T INT0 IT AND I g0T A wH0LE R0LL 0F FILM 0f PE0PLE

   SLYME AND I hEADED BACK T0 MR. WASaBI F0r DINNER BUT T0 0UR sURPRISE 
IT WAZ CL0SED! NEW YEAR'Z DAY TURNED 0UT T0 BE A BAD DAY T0 TRY T0 FIND 
PLACEZ 0PEN T0 SErVE F00D. WE SH0ULD HAvE STAyED AT THE H0TEL. WE FINALLY 
ENDED UP IN A BaR WHICH SERVED F00D, 0RDEREd H0T CH0K0LATE AND k0NS0LED 
0URSELVEZ 0N THE LACK 0F SUSHI. BAcK AT tHE H0TEL A BUNCH 0F UZ WENT 
R00M H0PPING AND tRIED T0 DETERMINE WH0 WAZ LeFT. MY FLIGHT WAZ At 7 A.M. 
AND I HAD N0 INTEnTI0N 0F G0ING T0 SLEEp AND tAKING A CHANCE I W0uLD MISZ

F0R 3 M0RE DAYZ t0 GET BETTER AIRFARE rATES. I HEARD ERIKB HAD LeFT WITH 
0PHIE AND HE T0lD ME LATER THEY HAD AsKED ThE H0TEL AND HAD BEEn T0LD I 
CHECKED 0UT. 0NE R00M WE ENDED UP IN HaD A K0NS0LE K0PIER RUNNINg. I HAD 
HEARD AB0uT THEM BUT NEVER SEEN 0NE AnD WAZ T0LD IT WAZ 0kAY IF I 
PH0T0GRAPHED It. I WeNT D0WNSTAIRZ F0R My CAMERA.
   I HADN'T BEEn AL0NE 0NCE SINCE ARRiVING iN AUSTIN. WHILE THIz WASN'T 
ALWAYZ PLANNED, ThE TH0UGHT DID 0CCUR T0 ME ThAT MY R00M MIGHT BE WATCHED 
AND THAT LAW EnF0RCEMENT MIGHT BE INtERESTeD IN ANY 0F THE MANy PE0PLE 
I WAZ SEEN TALKiNG T0. I HAD MENTI0NEd A K0nTR0VERSIAL INTERVIEw WE HAD 
K0MING UP WITH ILF AND ALTH0UGH I TH0UgHT I wAZ BEING 0VERLY PARaN0ID, I 
WAZ STILL NERV0uZ I W0ULD BE QUESTI0NeD AB0uT IT. BUT IT WAZ 12:30 A.M. 
0R S0 AND I FELT T00 SILLY ASKING F0R s0ME0Ne T0 RUN D0WNSTAIRZ wITH ME. 
S0 I WENT AL0NE. BUT AZ I WAZ CL0SING ThE D00r AND CHECKING IT WAz L0CKED 
I SAW S0ME0NE HEAD D0WN THE HALL T0WARDZ ME ANd I KNEW INSTANTLY S0METHING 
WAZ AB0UT T0 BE UP. HACKERZ ARE RiGHT WhEN THEY SAY Y0U CAN'T FULLY 
UNDERSTAND THIz UNTIL Y0U HAVE LIVED IT. He ASKED IF I WAZ NETtA AND I 
SAID YEZ AND THEn HE REACHED T0WARDZ HiZ P0CkET. I KNEW HE WAZ G0ING F0R 
EITHER A GUN 0r A BADGE AND THERE WAz N0THiNG I K0ULD D0 AB0UT EITHER. 
IT TURNED 0UT t0 BE A BADGE AND AZ He G0T cL0SE EN0UGH S0 THAT I K0ULD 
SEE IT READ "AuSTIN P0LICE DEPARTMENt" I Th0UGHT T0 MYSELF "KEwL, IT'Z 
N0T THE SECReT SERVICE." HE ASKED mE T0 aCK0MPANY HIM T0 A R00M AND, 
H0LDING MY CAMERa, I DID. HE T0LD THE tW0 "SeCURITY GUARDS" THAT WE'D BE 
LEAVING tHE D00R 0PEN. I HAD AsKED WhETHER HE WAZ THE GUy WH0 HAD
CALLED ME LAST MARCH AND HE SAID N0 ThAT HE WAZ HIZ PARTNER. I w0NDERED 
WHETHER I WAZ UNdER INVESTIGATI0N 0R WhETHER THEY HAD N0 0NE ELSe T0 ASK 
F0R INF0RMATI0N 0R WHETHER THEY JUST wANTED T0 MEET ME AFTER TAlKING T0 
ME V0ICE. IT DIDN'T 0CCUR T0 ME T0 ASK. I TH0uGHT SEVERAL TIMEZ Ab0UT THE 
FACT I WAZ SUPP0SED T0 BE 0UT WITH BL00DAXE AND 0PHIE AND THAT iF I HAD 
MADE IT A P0INT T0 LEAVE WITH THEM THIZ W0ULDn'T BE HAPPENING. I w0NDERED 
wH0 ELSE APD HAD QUeSTI0NED WH0 HAD N0T T0LD ANy0NE. I W0NDERED IF tHEY HAD 
EVEN QUESTI0NED S0ME0NE AB0UT ME. I ALS0 FEAReD PE0PLE W0ULD K0ME L00KING 
F0R ME AND SeE ME IN THAT R00M AND THINK I WAZ TALKING T0 THe P0LICE 
V0LUNTARILY. THaT I HAD S0UGHT THEM 0uT. G0d F0RBID THEY SH0ULD THINK I 
WAZ TELLING THe P0LIcE AB0UT THE K0NS0LE K0PIER. 
   THE WH0LE tHING 0NLY T00K AB0UT 8 MINUtEZ AND THE 0FFICER aSKED ME 
N0THING I HAD A pR0BLEM ANSWERING. HE tREATEd ME WITH RESPECT ANd DIDN'T 
PRESZ ME T0 SAY ANYTHING I WASN'T K0Mf0RTABlE SAYING. I 0FFERED T0 GIVE 
HIM S0ME 0F MY MaGAZINEZ AT THE END 0F THE K0NVERSATI0N AND HE WaLKED ME 
T0 MY R00M AND WAz CLEARLY PLANNING T0 wAIT 0uTSIDE. I INVITED HIm IN AND 
HE WATCHED ME PuLL ISSUEZ FR0M THREE sUITCAsES. IT WAZ APPARENT N0THING 
ILLEGAL HAD G0NE 0N IN MY R00M. I'D LAY 0dDZ IT WAZ THE CLEANeST R00M 
THERE T00. ThE DAY BEF0RE, F0R EXAmPLE, mY TRASH IN THE BATHr00M HAD 
BEEN DUMPED AT LEAST THREE TIMES. N0nE WERe BY ME 0R WHEN I WAz IN THE 
R00M. THE 0NLY THING I K0ULDN'T ANSWeR, ANd IT WAZ SIMPLY FR0M NERVES, 
WAZ WHAT I HAD D0NE 0N NEW YEAR'Z EVE. THE AnSWER CAME 0UT THAT I DIDN'T 
REMEMBER AND SINCe I STAMMERED IT, IT MuST HAvE L00KED LIKE I HAD SEEN 0R 
D0NE S0METHING I SH0ULDN'T HAVE. BUT AlL I DiD WAZ IRC AND EAT SuSHI AND 
I D0 THAT S0 0FTeN I DIDN'T EVEN REMEMbER WHeN ASKED. NEW YEAR'Z EVE HAD 
BEEN aLM0ST LIKE ANY 0THEr NIGHT. 
   ANYWAY, I G0t THE K0NS0LE K0PIER Ph0T0 (hINT: I K0ULD USE A dETAILED 
ARTICLE 0N H0W THeY W0RK T0 RUN WITH IT). WE tHEN M0VED 0N T0 0THeR R00MZ 
AND I RAN INT0 DRUNKFUX AND DAMIEN Th0RN. I DID A L0NG VIDE0 InTERVIEW 
WITH DRUNKFUX, wH0 W0ULD HAVE MADE AN EXCELlENT J0URNALIST. HE rESISTED 
THE IDEA 0F ASKInG ME PETTY QUESTI0NZ aB0UT wH0 I LIKE AND D0N'T LIKE IN 
THE SCENE aND WH0 I'D SLEEP WITH IF I k0ULD. I W0ULD HAVE aNSWERED 
ANYTHING HE ASKED IN THE SPIRIT 0f THE H0H0K0N VIDE0 TRADITi0N, BUT 
INSTEAD WE G0T InT0 M0RE SERI0UZ ISSUEz AND pE0PLE WH0 THINK DRUnKFUX IZ 
SHALL0W 0R A LESS-tHAN-SERI0UZ DUDE DUE t0 HIZ IRC REPUTATI0N WILL BE M0ST 
SUrPRISED. 
   THEN DAMIEN DID aN EQUALLY L0NG INTERViEW ANd DRUNKFUX G0T ELEET F00TAGE 
0F ME CL0SING MY EYEZ WHEN THE TALK G0t T00 tECHNICAL. I DID ALM0ST PASZ 
0UT AZ IT WAZ 3 a.M. 0R S0 AND I FELT rEALLY K0MF0RTABLE BEING WiTH THEM 
BUT I SNAPPED T0 ATTENTI0N JUST IN THe NICK 0F TIME AZ DRUNKFUX HAD THE 
CAMERA AIMED 0N Me AND DAMIEN WAZ MAKINg A J0kE. DAMIEN T00K IT In STRIDE 
BUT I THINK IT WAZ THE FIRST TIME ANY0NE HAD EvER HAD THE CHANCE T0 LISTEN 
t0 HIZ M0ST ELEET TeCHNICAL TIPZ AND WAZ b0RED. I H0PE HE KN0WZ I L0VE HIM, 
LIKE M0ST HACKERS, F0R THE PERS0N HE IZ aND N0t F0R THE SKILLZ 0R tR0PHIEZ 
hE HAS. I WAZ TRANSfIXED AZ HE T0LD DRUNKfUX HIz BEGINNINGZ IN THE k0MPUTER 
UNDERGR0UND AND HIz VIEWZ 0N LAWS, ETHICs, WRItING, ETC. I JUST D0n'T LUST 
T0 KN0W WHAT M0DeL 0F PH0NEZ HE RESPECtZ M0St 0R WHAT GADGET HE'z TESTED 
LAST. LUCKILY F0R Y0U, DRUNKFUX DID THE INTERvIEW, N0T ME, AND HE DID ASK 
L0TZ 0N THAT S0RT 0F STUFF. AFTER THEY wERE D0NE DAMIEN AND I WENt 0UT T0 
S0ME FAST F00D BUrGER J0INT. IT WAZ DIRt CHEAp AND TASTED LIKE CArDB0ARD. 
WE HAD A GREAT CHAt, AZ USUAL, AND THEN wENT T0 THE AIRP0RT WITH SlYME WH0 
HAD SLEPT THE NiGHT AWAY AND MISSED EvERYTHiNG. MY FLIGHT WAZ FiRST AND 
THEY WALKED ME T0 THE GATE AND MADE A FuSZ 0VeR ME AND IT WAZ THE PERFECT 
ENDING. 
   I CAN'T BELiEVE I N0W HAVE T0 WAIt TILL JUNE (AND G0 T0 GE0rGIA, 0F
