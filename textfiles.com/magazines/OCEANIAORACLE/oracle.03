BYE-BYE LIBERNET

As this project begins to take off, we have begun to post way too
often for the liking of some Libernet readers.  Therefore we will end
publication on Libernet within an issue or two.  If you are a
Libernet reader who has only been getting this publication through
Libernet, now is the time for you to subscribe directly.  Send the
message subscribe oceania-l <your e-mail address> to
listproc@butler226a.dorm.tulane.edu.


NEW STILLS!

Jim Albea worked through the weekend with two computers, a 60 Mhz
Pentium and a dual 90 Mhz Pentium.  Using NT to get symmetrical
multiprocessing, he created the best still pictures of Oceania yet.
The ten images online are 1024x768.  If you would like to see
1600x1200 images, please send e-mail to oceania@terminus.intermind.net.

To get an image either use our ftp site at butler226a.dorm.tulane.edu
/pub/oceania, the web site at http://butler226a.dorm.tulane.edu/oceania 
or use our listserver by sending the message GET OCEANIA-L OCE01.JPG to
listproc@butler226a.dorm.tulane.edu to receive the first image.  The
names of the other images are OCE02.JPG, OCE03.JPG, OCE04.JPG, up to
OCE10.JPG.

To put it mildly, Jim's continuing work on stills and animations of
Oceania is giving The Atlantis Project a big boost in its efforts to
make Oceania real.  This publication is coming to life because it has
a seed to grow from, the seed being these stills and animations.

And to think, Jim's only in contact experience with The Atlantis Project
was to be held at our headquarters for half an hour because the police
wouldn't let anyone leave until my former partner's battle with the fire
department was settled.  I'm sure he enjoyed being in a house surrounded
by multiple police and fire department cars.  (The battle involved
the printing business my partner ran.)

Thanks Jim for all your help!


LUNAR POWER DEBATE

Here are two responses to the LUNAR POWER article:

From Andrew Tepper:

> The value is roughly $63.05 per tidal cycle.  At two tidal cycles per
> day of 10 foot average in our square mile cylinder, we can generate
> $1,261.30 per day or $460,375 per year.
> 

Assuming no cost to maintain the device, perfect efficiency, and a bank
willing to loan at 10% interest with no principal repayment, the thing
would have to cost $4.6M to break even. I don't think you could build a
1-mile cylinder for anything close to $4.6M. Neat idea, but unfeasable.
Some people have suggested a sort of motor using Nitinol wire that would
operate on the temperature differential between water on the surface and
below. I don't have any details, but most uses of Nitinol wire never
panned out.

From Bill Cox:

There's a small physics problem with the proposal, unless I
misunderstand something.  It's not possible for a *floating* city to
generate power this way, since it will rise and fall with the tidal
changes.

You could anchor the city to the bottom to prevent it from rising
with the tide, but you'd need a rigid support structure to keep it
from falling as the tide falls.


THE MILLENNIAL PROJECT

I received the following from Harold Shinsato:

Eric,

...

Another book I highly recommend that you peruse is named The
Millenial Project.  It was first published in 1992, and I have a 1994
printing.  The author's name is Marshal T. Savage.  This book is so
connected to what you are doing, that I would not be surprised if you
have already heard about it.

Marshal Savage proposes that we colonize space, and he lists eight
"easy" steps to colonizing the galaxy.  The first step he calls
Aquarius, which will be to establish floating sea cities.  Here's a
quote about why the hexagonal structure is the best:

"The highest levels of order, like drops of water running to the sea,
derive from apparently chaotic systems.  Gaining access to the
universe's chaotic bedrock requires clearing away the overburden of
complexity.  As Thoreau advises: 'Simplify, simplify.'

"To approach an ideal engineering solution, cybergenic design looks
to natural harmony.  Accordingly, the design of Aquarius must
harmonize with nature, minimizing material requirements, while
maximizing volume, usable surface area, and dynamic stability.
Looking to cybergenic design, we find an optimal solution in the
simple bubble float.

"Certain aquatic snails use this design to build boyant platforms
from which they suspend themselves.  The design is simple and
efficient.  When bubbles are packed together, they naturally form a
hexagonal grid.  This then is the inevitable template for a floating
city like Aquarius."

There are some beautiful pictures of Aquarius in the book.  There are
also detailed plans about energy sources and food sources.

        Regards,
        Harold
--
This is a very good book with over 100 pages devoted to appendixes,
notes, and other reference material plus nearly 400 pages devoted to
the text on eight "easy" steps to colonize the galaxy.  Many people
besides Harold have recently pointed out this book to me and I was
tempted to simply post a note here saying that I've owned two copies
for a long time so there was no need to let me know about this
fascinating book.  (Actually these two books were gifts from Jim
Davidson, principle author and publisher of The Atlantis Papers.)

Then I had a better idea.  Why not offer the book for sale?  It is
available from The Atlantis Project for $24.95 which includes shipping
and handling.  You can charge to your Mastercard or Visa by sending us 
your card number, expiration date, name as it appears on the card, and 
billing address or just send a check to Eric Klien, 2656 Van Patten St.
#23, Las Vegas, NV 89109.


GAME

If you would be interested in doing the programming for a game
involving subliminal messages and biofeedback, send e-mail to
oceania@terminus.intermind.net.  This is another opportunity to work
with my venture capitalist.


IQ

If you have access to IQ tests along with explanations of their
answers, send e-mail to oceania@terminus.intermind.net.
