WEB SITE

Robert Bickford, County Chair of the Libertarian Party of Marin
County in California, and member of the CA State Central Committee,
has decided to help upgrade our web site.  He has already made
dramatic improvements to our site over the past 24 hours and his work
is just beginning.

Thanks to Robert, the idea of the web site being able to attract a
lot of attention to this project is becoming closer to reality.

For those of you who would like to review and comment on his work in
progress, check out our main web site at
http://butler226a.dorm.tulane.edu/oceania

For those of you who would like to see his past works, log onto the
WELL's Web server at:
  
      http://www.well.com/Conferences/liberty/index.html
  
In particular, look at the "Libertarian Organizations" document that is
linked to that page.


INFORMATION LISTS

There are lists of information throughout Internet, including FAQs,
regular documents, and databases.  A way to promote this site is to
get included on these lists.  For example, I recently submitted the
following to "EFF's Guide to the Internet, v. 2.31"

>OCEANIA
>
>     butler226a.dorm.tulane.edu.  Go to the /pub/oceania directory.
>     This is the FTP site for the new country in development, Oceania.  You 
>     may get the Constitution and Laws, information on related books, a
>     free subscription to the newsletter Oceania Oracle, receive animations
>     and stills of Oceania plus Oceania passport information is also online.
>     Available 24 hours a day.

The EFF Guide has a huge circulation so if this entry is included we
will get a considerable amount of publicity.  If you know of any good
places to submit entries on Oceania, please send me e-mail.  I have placed
about six entries over the past three days with only one being rejected so
far.  (The FAQ for alt.philosophy.objectivism rejected me which was no
surprise.)

I would really appreciate any input on places to submit more entries.  My
posting to tons of groups on Usenet, about 140 groups so far, is nearly
at the saturation point so additional methods must be implemented.


ELECTRONIC CHECKS

The Atlantis Project can now process checks electronically!

Don't like using credit cards and tired of waiting for snail mail to
slowly transport your checks across the country?  Then have us
process your check electronically via Telephone Check Payment
Systems.  Just e-mail us the bottom row of numbers on your check, void
the check so you don't accidently use it again, and we'll process
your check instantaneously.

Send the command get oceania-l mall.txt to
listproc@butler226a.dorm.tulane.edu to get the latest listing of our
product line.


WHITE PAPERS

White papers are informative, detailed papers on a subject.  White
papers need to be written up on various aspects of Oceania.  For
example, how the money system will work in Oceania, how the legal
system will work, etc.  Such papers will help give substance to our
world wide web site.  Send e-mail if you would like to author a white
paper on a particular subject.


INTERMIND

I have had a lot of problems with my Intermind account recently.  If you
have sent any mail which has not been responded to, please resend it.  I
would also be interested in any lists of hosts for Nevada, in case I am
not aware of a competing host in Nevada.


MATCHMAKER QUESTIONNAIRE

I am interested in doing a major rewrite of my matchmaker questionnaire
for matching people up.  If you believe you are talented in this area,
you would be paid for your efforts.


OCEANIA SECRET .SIG SOCIETY

Graham King and Joe Moorman are the first people to join this society
which adds the follow .sig to all their messages:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Oceania: A New Country In Development ->  oceania@terminus.intermind.net |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

I am looking forward to results from this .sig experiment.  Now all we have
to do is come up with a secret handshake! (grin)
