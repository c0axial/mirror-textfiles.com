THE WEB EXPLODES!

I have noticed a steadily increasing number of subscriber requests to
this list lately, so I knew something was up.  Yesterday, I received
the following messages from Tramm Hudson, the person who runs our web
site:

"I don't believe how much the WWW traffic has picked up in response
to your advertising.  I am averaging 10 or so simultaneous connections
and around an average of almost 1000 accesses per -hour-."

"As of 11:50 this morning, we have had 17625 connections today.
And they are still coming in.  I can't wait to see the weekly
stats this Sunday..."

"I need to get more memory.  My machine is paging heavily under
all the traffic.  I think with another 16 megs we could eliminate
the paging and have all the necessary files cached rather than
fetching them from the disk each time.  Now I just need to save
up some money and I'll be able to upgrade."

"As of 11:50 this morning, we have had 17625 connections today."
"And as of 12:50 this afternoon, we have had 22144 accesses.  Wow!"

[Editor's note: That is nearly 5,000 accesses in a hour!  My research ]
[shows that major university webs are lucky to receive that many      ]
[accesses in a day.                                                   ]

"I think with another 16 megs we could eliminate the paging"

"Right now, I have 16 megs.  Since I have to replace the memory in lots
of four chips, I plan to remove four of the one meg simms and sell them.
I'd then replace those four with four 4 meg simms, bringing me to
28 megs."

[Editor's note: Does anyone have any 4 meg SIMMS for sale?            ]

"My roommate left me a note asking if my computer was ok.  He said
that it has been making noise all day..."

A long list of items has been added to the mall and more are in the

now available in the web version of our Oceania Mall.

I am looking for a beautiful model to pose in an Oceania T-shirt.
Payment will be a free Oceania T-shirt.

Pictures of our other products for sale are also needed so they can
be scanned into the web version of the Oceania Mall.


BOB BICKFORD IS TALKED OFF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE

Bob has been inundated with work on improving the web as wave after
wave of new products, new links, and needed upgrades hits him.
Handling such an enormous amount of work brought him to the breaking
point recently, and the emergency staff rescue team at the Oceania
Oracle had to talk him off his attempted jump off the Golden Gate
Bridge.  Please help out in this serious situation by lending a hand
in maintaing our web site.

[A transcript of our emergency team in action will be available as soon 
 as someone makes one up for us.]


THE CONSTITUTION IS IMPROVED

The hypertext version of the Constitution online has been
significantly upgraded by Sean Kane.  Thanks Sean!


OCEANIA STILLS AND ANIMATION UPDATE

I would like to thank Dawen Choy for uploading oceanic graphics to
Jim Albea to help him improve the stills and animations of Oceania
that he is working on.


LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

The following letter is from Allan Rempel:

> This morning, Saturday, I caught the last half of _Batman the
> Animated Series_ and apparently the villian figure in this episode
> was trying to make an ocean city called, what else, Oceana.  The guy

I doubt it.  People are always trying to discount bold new ideas.
It's strange, though, that these attempts are often made by science
fiction writers and others with generally bold imaginations.

Think of how many old Star Trek episodes involve a villian trying to
create robots with human brains ("What Are Little Girls Made Of"), or
thinking computers that control starships ("The Ultimate Computer"),
or people living forever (I forget the episode names).  Most of these
people have altruistic intentions, but because their methods are
'evil' and "the ends don't justify the means", they're viewed as
misguided scientists whom Captain Kirk has to eliminate.  I also
remember seeing lots of cartoons as a kid where cool ideas are
discounted by the 'good guys'.

This may have changed recently.  There's a Next Generation episode
with a genetically engineered society, which, even though Picard is
against it, is shown to have some good qualities.  (In the end, of
course, some of its inhabitants want to leave anyway, having seen
'the good life'.  *sigh*)

Every time I try to make some claim about Oceania to my friends, I
get a lot of ridicule and skepticism.  Most people I talk to don't
believe it will happen, because it's too big of a dream.  Even some
libertarian friends that I know don't think Oceania will happen, for
the same reason.  They'd sooner put their efforts into something
easier, like intentional communities or something.  Adults, hardened
by the cold cruel facts of life, just don't seem to want to hold wild
ideas anymore...

I seriously doubt there's any kind of negative press campaign against
Oceania.  Most people won't have heard of it; most of those that have
heard of it don't believe it will happen (and hence won't feel
threatened) and I can't imagine anybody have anything to lose anyway,
even if it will happen.  The only people who might feel threatened
are those deeply concerned with protecting the health of existing
countries, since the people Oceania is likely to attract are the
cream of the crop of existing countries.  But there's enough cream
(and Oceania certainly won't drain all of it) that even that
shouldn't be a problem.


SEA STRUCTURES INC. CONTINUED

I am ready to create a business plan for Sea Structures Inc.  If you
have any experience in such matters, please send me e-mail.  Also,
while we are waiting for Sea Structures Inc. to become profitable,
the founder of Sea Structures is looking for other part-time or full-
time work.  (He did an Eric Klien and sunk $50,000 into his business
before he learned enough to make his business work.)  Following is
information on him, note that he would prefer not to relocate as he
is starting to build up a customer base in Florida.

TAX DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS

I have received a few inquiries into my tax deductible contributions
program recently so I have high hopes for its success.  Now that my
mailing list is building up, I hope to soon have money to move this
project forward, especially being able to pay off old debts including
the model debt.


COMDEX

Does anyone have a copy of the COMDEX disk that was given out at the
recent COMDEX show?  This is the disk with a listing of all the
vendors.


CRYONICS

As a few people know, starting a new country is not the most unusual
venture that I am participating in.  I am a member of a small
cryonics organization that has less than a hundred members
worldwide.  Cryonics is the science of freezing people who die today
so they can be cured in the future (see sci.cryonics for more
details).  I was pleased to hear recently that Jim Davidson, the
author of The Atlantis Papers, joined the same group that I am a
member of.  If you would like information about CryoCare, the
cryonics group that I've joined, send me e-mail along with your snail
mail address.

This venture has received a lot of support from cryonics members.


OCEANIA SECRET .SIG SOCIETY

Tim Meehan, Kenneth L. Beal Jr., Andrew Trapp, and Arthur Torrey
have joined this society which adds the follow .sig to all
their messages:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Oceania: A New Country In Development ->  oceania@terminus.intermind.net |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In addition, Andrew Trapp and Bob Bickford have added links to their
home pages to our Oceania web site.


MUTUAL LINKS

I will soon announce a ton of mutual links between the Oceania web
and other webs.  We are about to have a mutual link between the
Liberty Conference Web and the Oceania web.  The link is already on
their web, we just have to add a link on our web to their web.

Creating mutual links between webs will be important to the long term
ability of this web to attract new readers.  The webs that have
established mutual links with us will soon be listed on a "Friends of
the Web" web page.


PUBLICITY

I am looking for authors of popular software on the net so I can
entice the author to add us to his .sig.  Any leads on this would be
appreciated.

If anyone would like to promote us in an article in Webster's Weekly
located at w2@casagato.org, check out their 'zine.


ELECTION FRAUD

I may soon be breaking a story on election fraud on the net.  It is
about a small group of people who have conspired to block votes from
occuring.  If this story breaks, I will even be able to give you
e-mail addresses of these people so you will get to speak with them.
Oh, the excitement builds!  (I'll of course, have a web page created
on this subject so people can read about it for the years to come.
Hundreds of thousands of people will learn the facts over time!)
