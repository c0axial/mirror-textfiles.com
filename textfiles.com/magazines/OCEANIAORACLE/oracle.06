OCEANIA VS KERGUELEN

The Following was submitted by Sean Kane, original author being
_tralala (SMTP.TRALALA) at SSWGATE:

I heard about the Oceania project and found it quite interesting.

I belong to a new Internet/Infobahn collective working on persuading
the French government to let go of the island of Kerguelen in the
southern part of the Indian Ocean. Kerguelen is approx. 150
kilometers from west to east and has a climate similar to Iceland.
The island has a rich natural life, rare birds, whales etc. and some
of the greatest fishing waters in the world. A huge colonial project
for Kerguelen was undertaken in the mid 19th century but later put on
hold due to the far distance from neighbouring countries. Now the
island harbors a great meterological station, a fishing harbor and an
annual French government budget of 117 million French francs.  We
think Kerguelen could make a great haven for a new liberatarian
state.  All we need to do is to set our plans properly in cyberspace
and then invade the island. All EU citizens are entitled to live in
Kerguelen freely and if enough of us do so we will be enabled to take
over the isdland and set up our independent state and government.

Maybe a little more realistic than Oceania. Or maybe we should do
both ...  Then Kerguelen and Oceania could set up a partnership in
trade and politics between them.

ANOTHER DONATION

I would like to thank Hiroshi Haraguchi of Japan for his $50 donation
in addition to his recent passport order.  These donations are a big
help in my quest to make Oceania real.


CREDIT CARD PROCESSOR

I am processing more credit card orders than expected based on the
relatively small size of this project.  Therefore I would be
interested in a secondary credit card processor so that one person or
company is not stuck processing all of our orders.  Let me know if
you can help with this.


SEA STRUCTURES INC. CONTINUED

As many of my long term readers are aware, I am interested in making
Oceania real.  One of the aspects that I have been devoting more time
to is to help Sea Structures Inc. become a profitable company.  For
example, I recently found someone who was interested in
manufuacturing/marketing of SeaCells for the west coast.

What were his credentials you ask?  He wrote:

"After studying engineering at UBC I was employed at Neptune Dynamics
Limited.  Neptune makes custom manufacturing and processing equipment
primarily for the canning and fish industries.

While working there I was responsible for the manufacture,
installation, and trouble-shooting of herring sexing machines in
Europe, B.C. and Alaska.  I also worked with can defect detecting
machinery in China.

This experience exposed me to a wide variety of manufacturing
techniques (including plastic injection molding).  Since Neptune is a
small company I also gained experience in marketing, shipping,
purchasing and all other aspects of business."

---
I gave this person's contact information to Sea Structures Inc.
yesterday.  This is one of many behind the scenes things that I have
been working on to get Oceania into reality.

Talking about Sea Structures Inc., if you would be interested in
helping finance nationwide ads for this company, you will receive
part of the profits related to that ad.  Send e-mail to
oceania@terminus.intermind.net if this idea interests you.


OCEANIA BUSINESS PLAN

Earlier this year, while The Atlantis Project was still going strong,
I began to look into the idea that the project really needed a
business plan to go forward.  It was eventually determined by a
successful businessman who was the former CEO of a $100 million
financial firm, that we should have a business plan based upon the
idea of having investors invest in profitable marine construction
businesses which could be used to build prototypes of Oceania and to
test construction techniques that will be needed to create Oceania.
(While still using the majority of their resources to continue their
profitable business.)  Even if Oceania failed, the investors would
still have part of a profitable business.

My employees hunted all over the U.S. and Canada, trying to find such
a company without success.  We called tens if not hundreds of
business brokers, checking lead after lead.  Nothing was found.  Sea
Structures Inc. recently turned up and I believe that it meets the
needs of such a business plan.  Its only problem is that the young
company is not profitable yet.  So my goal is to make this company
profitable so the original business plan for creating Oceania that
was developed almost a year ago can be put into place.  This is why I
am such a big supporter of Sea Structures Inc.


USENET ADS

To promote this listserver, I have been posting ads all over Usenet.
If you would like to write ads for specific groups, feel free to do
so and submit them.  It is important that I don't run the same ad
over and over again for the same group.  I would like to thank Jim
Davidson for the hard work that he has done in the past creating the
vast majority of ads that I use today.


.SIG

".sig" is short for signature and is the few lines at the end of a
message which contain someone's name, e-mail address, and often a
short quote.

Send me e-mail if you would like your .sig to promote this
listserver.  This mailing list would have to at least quadruple in
size before this project became viable.  I even once offered to buy
ad space in someone's .sig whose .sig said "Your ad here!" with no
success.


ANIMATION PROGRESS

Following is a little story of how progress occurs at The Atlantis
Project:

I have wanted to provide Jim Albea with the cool radio ad that was
produced for Oceania in the past.  The problem was that the tape
containing the ad was in my storage locker where the rent is overdue.
Luckily, one of the dynamic libertarian women that I have met thanks
to this list had a boss who wanted to see COMDEX.  So he decided to
stay at the "luxurious" Atlantis Project headquarters for a mere $250
for three nights.  (Hotel prices skyrocket in Las Vegas during
COMDEX.)  This money will enable me to pay off the storage locker
fees so the tape will go in the mail today to help Jim Albea work on
the animation.  The excess money will then be used to keep The
Atlantis Project phone lines connected.

Oh, please note that I am still looking for sources of oceanic sounds
and pictures.


SLOGAN

It is time to replace our old slogan "Break The Chains".  What do the
readers think of the following slogans: "Peace and Prosperity", "The
Ultimate Freeport", and "Aquatic Paradise"?  And how about the
following slogan for the Oceania Oracle: "New Nation News" or the
longer "No Nonsense New Nation News"?


THE ATLANTIS PAPERS

This issue ends with an excerpt from _The Atlantis Papers_ by Jim
Davidson, Eric Klien, Norm Doering and Lee Crocker
 
"Surplus order is that excess order imposed not for the benefit of
society, but exclusively for the benefit of those who control the
state.  Surplus order is the antithesis of beneficial or socially
necessary order.  The regime that imposes surplus order on its
suffering citizens deprives itself of the Rousseauian justification
for existence."

                                            --      Alvin and Heidi Toffler
                                                    Powershift:
                                                    Knowledge, Wealth, and
                                                    Violence 
                                                    at the Edge of the 21st
                                                    Century

The world has changed.  Increasingly, the world is changing.  Not
only is change taking place all the time, it takes place at an
accelerating pace.  The rate of this acceleration is accelerating.
Systems that once served millions of people have been torn down and
radically realigned.  Time is increasingly valuable, transaction
speeds are increasing everywhere, and knowledge is the single most
compelling form of power available.

What took place in Eastern Europe starting about 1988 was a wave of
transformation which eliminated totalitarian regimes.  Violence
played a part, but knowledge was the key.  Information about the
problems within their governments could no longer be kept from people
equipped with faxes, modems, satellite dishes, radios, televisions,
and telephones.  In country after country, culminating in the Soviet
Union in 1991, the level of control, what the Tofflers describe as
"surplus order" was radically reduced.  The mighty armies of the
Warsaw Pact seemed powerless to stop changes wrought by a populace
informed and infuriated.

In most countries, these changes were relatively bloodless.  Rumania
required a few days of fighting in the streets.  Hard-liners in the
Soviet Union resisted for a short period.  In China, the massacre of
probably thousands of protesters actually delayed much change beyond
the present day.  But in nation after nation, governments fell,
societies were transformed, and the realignment is still being felt
today.

In America, the Cold War ended with the collapse of every nation in
the Warsaw Pact.  But the surplus order imposed on Americans,
frequently justified from the end of World War II as necessary to the
defeat of communism, has not yet dwindled.  In very many ways,
surplus order has increased.

What is this surplus order, why does it continue, and how can those
who love liberty remove its damaging influence?  That is the
essential subject matter for this book.  The examination of such
issues led to the creation of the Atlantis Project.  And it is the
final analyses of that question which require the establishment of a
new nation, a new haven of safety, and a new government truly founded
on the principles of freedom.

Many Americans wonder at the concept of surplus order in their
country.  "Are we not living in the land of the free?"  Certainly,
most of the history of America and many of its greatest episodes
revolve around the fight for freedom.  Unfortunately, much of that
fight has been given up for fleeting concepts of security and order.
In many ways, the accelerating pace of change has weakened American
resolve to maintain freedom and encouraged many to seek shelter in
the deceptively outstretched arms of their government.

Yet who can deny the existence of surplus order in America?  Turn on
the television in the spring of 1993 and see an army surrounding a
small enclave near Waco, Texas.  Watch in wonder as the forces of the
United States Government attack with dozens of troops, not once but
twice.  What fearsome enemy of the state inhabits this enclave, what
terrible crimes justify this response?

The possession of weapons by inhabitants of the Branch Davidian
compound at Mount Carmel is clearly protected under the United States
Constitution.  That document, so remote from most Americans whose
government-operated schools do little to educate on the principles of
liberty, reads, in part, A well-regulated Militia being necessary to
the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and
bear arms shall not be infringed.  Certainly, events bore out their
concern that their compound might be attacked by an armed force
determined to disrupt their way of life.

The practice of an unusual and somewhat unpopular religion by the
inhabitants of Mount Carmel is also protected by the United States
Constitution.  Again, the US Constitution reads, "Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof..."  Upholding this Constitution was the sworn
duty of every agent who participated in each attack.

The ultimate justification for the second storming of Mount Carmel
was the possibility that the children inside had been abused and
might suffer mistreatment.  Although the evidence for this charge had
been investigated by Texass Child Protective Services and found to be
baseless, the effort to eliminate this threat of harm was certainly
disastrous.  Every single child remaining in the compound was killed
in the final conflagration.  No matter who actually set that final
fire, it is clear that the deaths of all those children would not
have occurred without the second attack on the compound.

Indeed, the Davidians had agreed to surrender within the next month.
Why the hurry to impose a massive retaliation for the deaths of a few
Federal agents who had participated in a poorly conceived, budget
justifying, largely unplanned, entirely unnecessary, deliberately
brutal and excessive raid against a group whose leaders had
previously surrendered to law enforcement officials when faced with
far more serious charges?  As David Koresh had demonstrated in facing
murder charges several years earlier, and as he and other Davidian
leaders stated repeatedly during the standoff, the entire incident
could have been avoided by an initial request for their surrender to
authorities.  Koreshs attorney has pointed out that the Davidians
invited the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to inspect
their weapons months before the incident and that the ATFs warrant
request had noted neighbors concerns about automatic gunfire but
neglected to mention that those claims were investigated by local law
enforcement and found to be untrue.  So why the hurry?  Why the
intense atmosphere of confrontation and the overt use of force?
Television.

The story just kept showing up in newspapers and on television.  What
was the government doing?  What were the Davidians doing?  How could
a few kooks keep all those government agents from doing anything?
The need to impose massive, dominating, and finalizing order was the
impetus for the second attack.  It was entirely "for the benefit of
those who control the state."  The idea that anyone could challenge
the power of the US Government, even for a short period, was
intolerable to those who held that power.

Such imposition of surplus order is not exceptional.  It is not in
the least unusual.  The intense media focus on such events is
unusual, and the story of the Waco massacre is certainly more
familiar than most incidents.  But it is only a very recent and very
public example of activities that have been going on for years,
increasingly prevalent violations of civil liberties.

One important point to focus on is the alarming effect these
activities by the state have on the wealth-generation system which is
increasingly knowledge-driven and occurs entirely outside the state.
The information revolution that made possible the dissolution of
totalitarian regimes across Europe was created in the relatively open
and free environment of Western nations.  The increasing levels of
control being imposed in those same Western nations today have
nightmarish consequences for the engines of change, the new
mechanisms for wealth creation.

Imagine a nation in which property rights are easily forfeit, where
anyone may be accused of a crime and the accused have few protections
from arrogant prosecutors, where almost half of all moneys generated
are taken by the state, where privacy is impossible to protect.
Imagine a nation in which the elected representatives and appointed
bureaucrats have enormous power, in which corruption is so rampant
that the term politics has come to mean corrupt politics.  Americans
need use little imagination since they live in such a nation every
day.

Then imagine a nation in which elections are fraudulent, in which
many candidates are excluded from the ballot by deliberate processes,
in which major elections are tainted with deceptive practices.  Many
Americans do not realize the extent of election fraud in their
country, others shrug it off as well-known but out of their power to
prevent.  One popular commentator, William F. Buckley, once amused
his audience by relating that a friends uncle in south Texas who had
died in the 1940s had been such a good Democrat, he had voted in two
elections posthumously.

American elections are controlled by extra-legal entities called
political parties.  The two major parties which exert such enormous
control are not described in the US Constitution, nor are they
substantially regulated by any laws.  Access to the ballot is largely
controlled by members of these parties, the division of each state
into political districts is engineered by the party holding a
majority in that states legislature, and Federal election funds are
distributed preferentially to candidates of the two major parties.

The personal experience of one of the founders of the Atlantis
Project was significant in its creation.  That experience is far from
extraordinary.  In an election in Clark County, Nevada, tens of
thousands of absentee ballots were sent to a local union hall and
returned in batches of one hundred.  Dozens of other features of the
election strongly pointed toward massive fraud.  And the state
legislature refused to consider the boxes of evidence brought to them
on the grounds that they were "too tired" to consider the facts after
a long legislative session.

It is these two disturbing facts, that America is no longer free and
that its election process is not fair, which have led to the creation
of the Atlantis Project.  It is the purpose of the Atlantis Project
to create a new nation where freedom is protected not only by a
superior Constitution, but also by the determination of the
inhabitants not to allow the American experience to repeat itself.
