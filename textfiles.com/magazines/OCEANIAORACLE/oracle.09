TO GIVE MONEY TO CLINTON OR THE ATLANTIS PROJECT, THAT'S A TOUGH CHOICE

A two year quest is over!  Thanks to arrangements that I have made
with two non profit organizations, donations for the Atlantis Project
are now tax deductible.  So you now have a choice.  You can give
money to Bill Clinton and he can spend it on making the government
larger and more powerful or you can give money to The Atlantis
Project and help speed our journey towards creating a free country.
Either way you are making a political statement.

Send e-mail to oceania@terminus.intermind.net if you would like more
details on how you can make tax deductible donations to The Atlantis
Project.


INTERGRAPH WEB AND OCEANIA WEB LINK TOGETHER

Intergraph, the creator of ModelView, the program that was used to
create the images and animations of Oceania online, has agreed to
link their web to ours.  They plan on linking their Visualization
products page where ModelView is listed to our web and we will create
a link on our end probably on a new page where we describe how Jim
Albea was able to create these images.  It never hurts to get a
little publicity from a big company.

I was impressed to recently learn that one of the Intergraph machines
that Jim used to work on the images retails at $14K or so.  (This was
the dual 90 Mhz machine.)  Jim is definitely using more powerful
hardware than we have at the Atlantis Project headquarters!


WHITE PAPERS

Fred Foldvary, an economist at Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University), has agreed to write a white paper on
the money system of Oceania.  Many other topics are available for
people who wish to write white papers.


THE OCEANIA WEB IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE OCEANIA WEB!

The second Oceania web has been closed down mainly because it was
felt by the owner of this web that our main web is filling the need
and so he could now step down from running a web for us.  This web
owner, Sean Kane, has instead decided to help translate the Oceania
Constitution and Laws into a hypertext format for our main web site.
So at the moment we have Tramm Hudson the owner of our web, Robert
Bickford, the main person transforming the web, and Sean Kane all
working together to improve our web site.


OCEANIA CONSTITUTION TRANSLATIONS

We have had two complaints about the character set used in the
Spanish translation of our constitution.  This is being looked into.
The author of this translation, Roberto Leibman, will be glad to make
any changes that are necessary.

We are looking for people to translate our constitution into other
languages.  If you feel you are capable of doing this, please send
us e-mail.


PASSPORT NEWSLETTER

Before the end of the year, a free snail mail newsletter will be
launched only to owners of Oceania passports.  The current expected
name is "Oceania Society News" with the slogan "For Oceania Passport
Holders Only".  Suggestions for names and slogans are being solicited.


INTERMIND

I have had one problem after another with my local Intermind account
and am ready to consider an alternative to it.  I have learned that
the following companies offer direct access to Nevada: Evergreen,
Great Basin, Netcom, NevadaNet, Sacramento Network, Sierra, and
@wizard.com.  I would be interested in hearing anyone's experiences
with these Internet hosts.


LIBEL SUIT

Some idiot is commiting some serious libel about me (and three others)
on CompuServe.  Unfortunately, I do not have the resources to start a
lawsuit, and I do not want to make an empty threat against him.  If you
would be interested in pledging money for such a suit, if it occurred,
please send e-mail to Eric Klien at oceania@terminus.intermind.net.

I should point out that I've never lost a lawsuit in my life and would
definitely not lose this one.


OCEANIA MALL

I have had some people inquire about putting their products in our
electronic mall.  Expect this mall to start expanding soon!


OCEANIA SECRET .SIG SOCIETY

Rob Walker, Marie Gaudard, and Neal Harvey have also joined this society
which adds the follow .sig to all their messages:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Oceania: A New Country In Development ->  oceania@terminus.intermind.net |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This .sig experiment may work as Neal Harvey said:

"I think the .sig idea is a good one - I know in the past I've found some
interesting things by following up references in other people's .sigs"
