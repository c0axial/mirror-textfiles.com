THANKS

I would like to thank Barry Fagin for all his help in letting me post
to Libernet for as long as I wanted to.  This despite me crashing
Libernet over a year ago when I made the mistake of allowing this
list to be unmoderated for two days.  (Boy was a lot of mail posted
during those two days!)

Thanks to him the Oceania list has grown up and now has even more
e-mail addresses than its parent, Libernet, has.  (Like Libernet,
some of these addresses go to more than one person, so the total
readership of both lists is unknown.)


SEA STRUCTURES INC. CONTINUED

I received the following from Kurt Jaeger:

Perhaps you could pass this on to SeaStructures.

>From the information given I would guess that SeaCells are rotationally
molded.  Sea Structures may wish to investigate molding SeaCells using
a DCPD RIM (Dicyclopentadine Reaction Injection Molding) process.  Raw
materials will be more expensive, but molds can be cycled much more
quickly (a molded can be cycled about every three minutes).  The mold
and molding equipment will also be cheaper than for injection molding.
The process is also better suited to larger plastic parts than
injection molding and the material is chemical and impact resistant.

At present, Polaris, Arctic Cat, Kawasaki, and Yamaha all mold their
snowmobile hoods using this process.  Honda molds body for its utility
cart, several Japanese companies mold body panels for construction
equipment, and we have had interest expressed from John Deere,
Caterpillar, and Case about the process.

The company I work for is a DCPD RIM molder. [...]
----

I spoke to the president of Sea Structures today and he was very
interested in this process and is in the process of contacting Kurt.
I am pleased that this mailing list has grown large enough so I am
able to find the critical business contacts that Sea Structures needs
to become a viable company.  Of course, it wouldn't hurt if the list
got bigger...


OCEANIA VS KERGUELEN

Carter Butts responded to this article with the following:

I've been following the Oceania project somewhat loosely since
introduced to it by an anarchist friend of mine.  As an anarchist
myself, I am quite interested in the idea, though as always skeptical
of the oximoron of the "free state."  Nevertheless, I'd much rather
live in a freer place than here, anarchal or not!  Anyway, this is
just a short note to indicate my support for looking into the
possibilities that Kerguelen might have to offer.  I am dubious that
the French would let it go...particularly not to a group such as
ours..but perhaps there is something useful that might come out of
the measure (including better staging for the project itself).
Anyway, I was glad to read of it, and I shall continue to follow
Oceania's progress.
 
Oh, incidently, you might want to look into one of the universities
that are being set up on the net (the Globewide Netowrk Academy, for
instance).  These organizations typically have structures that are
VERY different from conventional organizations, are trans-national,
and, most importantly, are well equipped to serve as a marketplace
for alternative ideas concerning social organization.  If a free
society of any kind is to come about, a large number of people will
need to be shown that such is possible, and the best way (IMHO) to do
this is to "subvert" the educational system (which currently teaches,
in this country, anyway, that authority is the only answer to social
problems).  Anyway, the GNA has a web site at
http://uu-gna.mit.edu:8001/, or at least they used to.  Check it out!

.SIG

I've received one response so far to my idea of having people change
their .sigs to promote this listserver.  Perhaps this idea will get
off the ground.


ANIMATION PROGRESS

I recently used archie to find some oceanic pictures that Jim Albea
said would be useful in the Oceania animation.  Does anyone else want
to help Jim Albea create a quality animation?  By the way, I had more
luck with the search word dolphin then the search word ocean.

Even if you are no computer expert, you could send him cutouts of
color photos or send him audio CDs/cassettes with ocean sounds.


WEB SITE

One reason that I am such a big fan of Jim Albea's work is that it is
a key to making the Oceania web site a success.  I have been doing a lot
of research lately into ways that I can increase the membership of this
list.  I discovered the following yesterday:

Note the enormous amount of traffic that this web site received for
winning this award.  Transferring 175 megs in a day!  Receiving
23,000 requests!  This type of publicity could be the key to the
success of this project.  If our mailing list were simply quadrupled,
this project would be viable.  It seems that this award could have an
even greater effect than a quadrupling.

Considering this information, I immediately went to work at
increasing the amount of information that the Web site could access.
I added an archive site for Oceania Oracle issues, a Oceania Mall
site for items for sale, a document containing all SeaCell
information and discussions, a doc describing the Millenial
Project book, and a Spanish translation of the Oceania Constitution
by Roberto Leibman.

Unfortunately, my ability to access WWW sites is limited at the
moment.  Until recently, I didn't have a way to access them at all.
Then thanks to one of the dynamic libertarian women who has contacted
me, Sabina, I now can access WWW sites by telneting through one of
her accounts in Slovenia.  This access is at the moment text only, so
I'm not exactly sure of how the site looks in graphical format.

Anyway, the web site needs to be improved significantly before the
award has a chance of being won.  If anyone wishes to help reorganize
the site or simply transform some of the docs online into hypertext,
please send me e-mail.  I have much more evidence than this little
contest that World Wide Web sites are the key into establishing a
significant presense on the net.

Also note that if anyone wishes to establish another WWW site for
Oceania, I would be glad to add it to the WWW sites that I promote.
Additional FTP sites that other people set up would also be added to
the contact list if I learn about them.


TAX DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS

If you are a non profit organization that has been approved by the
IRS and would like to be a transfer point for donations to the
Atlantis Project, send me e-mail.  Obviously, The Atlantis Project
would have to fit in your mission statement for this to be
acceptable.


MERCHANDISE

If you are a wholesaler of freedom related or oceanic related
merchandise, please contact me about adding your merchandise to the
Oceania Mall.  Now that we can accept credit cards, it would make a
lot of sense to improve the selection in our mall.


THE MILLENNIAL PROJECT

This issue ends with an excerpt from _The Millennial Project_:

It is our destiny to colonize space.  Eventually we will spread our
civilization among the starts, but our first step is to build space
colonies on Earth.

At first glance the Earth may seem a little over-crowded for
colonization.  But really, three-quarters of this planet's
surface--the oceans--are virtually uninhabited.  Colonizing the
oceans will be like discovering three new planets the size of Earth.

Our first space colonies will be floating islands, grown organically
from the lambent waters of the tropical seas.  There are four
principal reasons why our first step toward space should take us to
sea:

1) If we are going to colonize space, it is best to colonize the
easiest space first.  The most accommodating space in this universe
is right here on Earth.  The tropical oceans are womb-like: warm,
hospitable, nourishing, and wet.  We will never find a better place
to gestate our embryonic pan-galactic empire than right here on the
mellow seas of Earth.

2) Living in colonies at sea will teach us many crucial lessons about
life in space.  The isolation, self-sufficiency, and political
autonomy of sea colonies are the same as those of space colonies.
Both types will impose many of the same requirements on their
inhabitants.  While the external environments of sea and space are as
different as tropical islands from lunar craters, the internal social
and personal environments are identical.  Space colonization's
hardware problems--questions of tool design--are easy to solve; the
software problems--questions of social and individual evolution--are
much tougher.  We need to learn to live together in a colony
environment long before we need to worry about how to live in the
space environment.  The Moon is a harsh mistress; we would be wise to
learn these early lessons while still in Earth's gentle lap.

3) Before we go gallivanting off to populate the galaxy, we had
better save the planet we're already on.  The sea colonies can go far
toward rescuing the Earth, producing enough food and energy to meet
the needs of billions, without damaging the planetary ecosphere.  The
sea colonies can even repair some of the damage already done.

4) Getting into space requires enormous power; both physical power
that flares out of a rocket, and financial power that flares out of a
bank account.  The sea colonies will produce both kinds in abundance:
enough raw electrical power to blast us into space, and enough raw
financial power to pay the fare.
