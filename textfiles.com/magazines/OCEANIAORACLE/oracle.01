CREDIT CARD BREAKTHROUGH!

A three year quest has come to an end.  I have been trying to be able
to process credit cards for the past three years.  The closest I came
to success on this matter was that I was able to process credit cards
for Tamara Clark's campaign for a limited time through the National
Libertarian Party.  But they eventually cut this off and I was
completely unable to find a way to process credit cards.  I even
offered to give a bank $5000 in collateral so we could process
approximately $5000 in credit card orders for Tamara with no success.

Thanks to Randy Dumse, I am finally able to process credit cards.
All credit cards orders (for Mastercard or Visa) should include card
number, expiration date, name as it appears on the card, and billing
address.  Besides an easy way to make donations and then pay for them
later, you can order things as well.  I have decided to extend my
passport offer for credit card users only for three more days until
Nov. 4th so that those who could only pay by credit card will now get
a chance to get passports at the special price of $50/passport.

In addition, you can order The Atlantis Papers this way as well.  The
price per copy is $28 per copy plus $2.90 shipping in the U.S. and
Canada, $3.50 shipping for Mexico, $8.00 in Central/South America,
and $12 elsewhere.


NEW STILLS ARE ALMOST HERE

Jim Albea has almost completed the stills of Oceania.  As soon as they
are done I will add them to our listserver and ftp site and then Jim
will start work on updating the animations.


NAME CHANGE

This electronic "newsletter" has been renamed to Oceania Oracle.  This
will be issue one.


LUNAR POWER

Bob Crawford has submitted the following article for Oceania Oracle:

                                LUNAR POWER
                              By Bob Crawford

In the sea, build a cylinder with an open bottom that is below the
surface at low tide.  Build it so the top is above the surface at
high tide.  Cap the top and install a wind turbine in it.

As the sea rises and falls with the tide, the perfect wind turbine
generates 1.7 billion foot pounds of energy each tidal cycle for each
foot of tide and each square mile of its circular cross section.
This equates to 630.65 kilowatt hours of energy.

The value is roughly $63.05 per tidal cycle.  At two tidal cycles per
day of 10 foot average in our square mile cylinder, we can generate
$1,261.30 per day or $460,375 per year.

If we built our cylinder large enough, and bent it so that it was the
shape and size of New York City (325 square miles), we could generate
electricity worth $149,621,940 annually.

Why did we build it the shape of New York City?  So that we could put
New York City directly on top of the 3.25 billion tons of seawater
that would be exchanged twice a day.  Heat exchangers could then tap
into the thermal characteristics of the ocean for further energy
exploitation.

A city has to sit on top of something.  Why not make the foundation
useful in providing clean energy?


That's all for today,
