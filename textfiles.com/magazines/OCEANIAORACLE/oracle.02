The following is a copy of a Sea Structures Inc. brochure:

                              SEACELL(tm)
                         SUPERIOR TECHNOLOGIES
 
                     The possibilities are endless...


WHY IS SEACELL(tm) SUPERIOR TO OTHER PRODUCTS?

[] Costs less than other products per equivalent weight 
   displacement.

[] No bilging necessary

[] Salt water resistant

[] Impact resistant

[] Flexibility

[] Resistant to fuels & marine life unlike foam products

[] Recyclable

[] Environmentally friendly

[] UV resistant

[] Most efficient shape to float on water

[] Resists internal pressure & spreads loads horizontally

[] More stable than pontons/resists tipping and lifting because 
   of water ballast

[] Resists ice damage: ice forms inside & out equalizing pressure

[] Inlets for beams reinforce floating surface

[] Floating dock height easily adjusted by changing air pressure 
   in cell

[] Easily stacked for shipping/storage


                       SEA STRUCTURES, INC.

Sea Structures, Inc., based in Fort Myers, Florida has developed a
revolutionary product called SeaCell(tm)

SeaCell(tm) allows expansion of traditional approaches to land and
water design within communities.  It has great potential for
application in marine study stations and hydroponics.

SeaCell(tm) construction creates "land on water", and represents
limitless design and construction opportunities to developers,
architects, builders, business owners and homeowners.

SEACELL(tm) ENCHANCES THE DEPENDABILITY AND DURABILITY OF STRUCTURES
ON WATER.

SeaCell(tm) units are 2'8" by 2'8" at the base, with a 1'2" radius
and 1'8" high cylindricial, polyethylene shape.  The cylindrical
shape allows water to act like a piston so that when water enters the
cavity, the resulting pressure holds SeaCell(tm) upright in water.

This design feature provides greater stability than other floation
devices on the market.  The pressure created on the inside of the
cell increases strength and provides uniform support to structures
built on water.

SeaCell(tm) is available on a wholesale and retail basis.


             SEACELL(tm) ... THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS.

VACATION

I am going on vacation until Nov. 7th so I have decided based on the
huge influx of mail I have received recently to extend my passport
offer until then since I can't respond to any more mail today.
