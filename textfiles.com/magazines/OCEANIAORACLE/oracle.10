INTERESTING NEWS

I received the following from Bob Crawford:

Copyright 1994. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Renowned scientist and submarine designer Dr. John P. Craven
remembers what it was like to be in the fifth grade.  
   He remembers the boundless imagination and the feeling that anything is
possible in the future.  
   That's why he has made a fifth-grade class from the Washington Elementary
School in Wauwatosa, Wis., the engineer and inspiration for his project of the
future: floating cities.  
   Sixty years ago, when Craven was himself a fifth-grader, he read "Twenty
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" and became fascinated with Jules Verne's
Nautilus, the vessel that could travel under the ocean.  
   "All the adults told me that's magic and fairy tales," he said.  
   Craven grew up to serve aboard the U.S. Navy's own Nautilus submarine and to
investigate U.S. naval accidents around the world. He later helped develop the
small, deep-submergence rescue submarines of the Polaris program, featured in
author Tom Clancy's novel (and later movie) "The Hunt for Red October."  
   Recently, when he began designing another one of his visions -- communities
that float atop lakes and oceans, he encountered the same adult cynicism.  
   "All of my peers told me exactly the same thing the adults told me when I was
a kid and what they are telling the kids now -- that floating cities are a pipe
dream."  
   So Craven decided he needed to find some fifth-graders who still had active
imaginations unchecked by the skepticism of adulthood.  
   "Innovation always starts with the young. Old folks are just not capable of
innovating, because innovation requires a fanciful framework," Craven said.  
   He calls his theory an organic process that sprouts in the minds of children
and grows with them into their adulthood.  
   "It's the children in their formative years -- 8 to 10 years old -- who
decide what the next generation will do."  
   For example, the 10-year-olds who first became fascinated with Dick Tracy's
two-way radio watch grew up to fill their world with miniature electronic
devices, he said.  
   However, before Craven could find his fifth-graders, the Wauwatosa students
found him.  
   In 1992, after reading a newspaper article about Craven's floating city
models, teacher Mary Weinfurter decided to turn the idea into a class project.  
   As part of their research into floating cities, each student in the class
wrote a letter to Craven at the University of Hawaii, asking him to tell them
more about his floating city.  
   "What would happen if a hole was made in the city? How will you keep it from
swaying with the waves? Will these cities be located on the map?" Jesse
Beottcher asked.  
   "How many dollars do you have to pay for building a city on top of the
water?" Mai Xiong asked.  
   Craven saw in the hand-printed letters the voices of that generation that
would actually bring his dream to life the way he helped give life to Verne's
fictional submarine.  
   He wrote to the students, asking for their own ideas about floating cities.  
   Within a month he got back more than 80 floating cities, each made out of
"crayons, imagination, understanding and motivation."  
   Craven compared the fresh, uninhibited ideas with the designs of renowned
architects and engineers.  
   The results amazed Craven and renewed his faith in the ingenuity of the
10-year-old mind.  
   Amy Ambrokian's crayon-drawn city matched almost perfectly the concentric
design of the city of Atlantis described by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato,
Craven said, although she had never heard of Atlantis.     Another young
designer put his city on tall poles that kept it above the highest ocean waves,
much like the model city the Japanese architect Kiyonori Kikutake made for the
1974 World's Fair in Okinawa.     Amanda Schmidt designed her city as three
domed, connected modules with the main city in the center, bracketed by modules
for houses and a floating forest complete with birds.  
   "No floating city designed by famous architects has birds in it," Craven
said. "But the kids put in birds, and they of course are right."    "The
fifth-graders realize, as no professional designer has, that birds, insects and
animals are a necessary part of every human city."  
   Craven went to Wauwatosa to meet with these young visionaries and hear more
of their ideas. He is now compiling the children's drawings and ideas into a
book aimed at other young minds.  
   He said he hopes to be like a Jules Verne to this young generation, to plant
intellectual seeds now that will one day grow into inventions of the future.  
   "There is no question in my mind that the organic process that produced the
submarine Nautilus is starting again with this generation, and will lead to the
building of floating living communities," he said.   


WEB SITE UPDATE

The web site continues to be improved.  As I write this, a package is
in the mail from Sea Structures Inc. to our web site so pictures and
diagrams can be scanned in for online viewing.  (Our current information
on the web site about Sea Structures Inc. is text only.)  Obviously,
the most important thing we can do to make Oceania real is to help
out Sea Structures Inc. and so this addition to the web will be quite
important.

The web site is starting to pick up steam, we had nearly 3500
accesses in a recent week.

Also, if anyone can provide us with scanned in images of the Oceania
flag, constitution, laws, bumperstickers, or any other related
product, please send e-mail to this affect.


EVERGREEN

I would like to thank Thane Eichenauser for the following
information:

"I have one friend (with university net service now) and one
acquaintance whose wife uses Evergreen.  Their evaluation is quite
favorable.

I have heard of many discontented Netcom users, so it would be on my
'Think twice' list."

So therefore once I am able to afford it, I will be switching to
Evergreen.


PUBLICITY

The campaign to get publicity for this mailing list is gaining steam.
I recently received the following from "Yahoo - A Guide to WWW" located
at http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo:

"> 
> A new web site has opened containing files related to the new country
> in development, Oceania.  You may get the Constitution and Laws, plus
> information on related books such as The Atlantis Papers and The
> Millennial Project.  You may also view true color pictures of Oceania
> plus view back issues of the Oceania Oracle.  Animations of Oceania
> are also online as well as information on how to receive an Oceania
> passport.
> 
> The web is located at http://unicycle.cs.tulane.edu/oceania

thanks. we'll add this to Society_and_Culture/Alternative/Oceania/"

This guide to the web has a large circulation and the inclusion of our
site on their list of sites will help us greatly.  If anyone knows of
other good places to have the web mentioned please let us know.

Also, the publicity campaign is starting to be taken beyond Usenet.  I
recently placed my first ad in CompuServe in the politics section.  If
others would like to help in a publicity campaign on the other major
networks such as Prodigy or help continue my campaign on CompuServe, 
please send us e-mail.

If a game featured Oceania, it could be used as publicity for this 
list.  If anyone is interested in creating a DOOM .WAD for Oceania,
please let us know.


INTERESTING NEWS II

I received the following from Lt. Wilkes:

This morning, Saturday, I caught the last half of _Batman the
Animated Series_ and apparently the villian figure in this episode
was trying to make an ocean city called, what else, Oceana.  The guy
founding the city apparently wanted it to be a type of utopian
paradise with no crime, no disease, etc.

But, on the negative side, the rest of the world was apparently going
to be destroyed through some kind of iceage caused by the project.  I
don't know if this iceage was going to be intentional or
unintentional, I missed the first half of the cartoon.

Of course, in the end, the villian was defeated and the cartoon's
"Oceana" destroyed.  Makes me wonder if this is some kind of weak
attempt at a negative press campaign.  I don't know.


THE NEW REFUGEES

Forbes recently published an article entitled "The New Refugees: As
their tax burdens grow, many affluent Americans are abandoning their
citizenship".  Would anyone like to type in or scan this article?
