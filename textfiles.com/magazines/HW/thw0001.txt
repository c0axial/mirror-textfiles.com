        Welcome to the first issue of "The Hacker's Warehouse". It's sure to 
become the leading publication in the 215/610 area.  I guess I should tell
how I got started with this idea in the first place. About 1 month ago me
and a friend were talkin' about various publications such as "VAS","CDC"
"PHRACK","BAR"... and others. We got to thinking that the 215/610 really
didn't have a good H/P/A publication. Well right then and there we had to
solve this delima, so we started a group called THE HACKER'S WAREHOUSE.  At 
first we wanted to modle it after VAS's style.(1 main article per issue) 
Then about a week later we changed our minds. Then just this past Saturday 
we changed them back so there. Actualy so HERE I am writing this Pilot issue 
while my friend is home sleeping! I really wish I haden't said that Oh Well..
In order for this project to suceed we are gonna' need a few things. First, 
Some INCREDIBLE writers. Second a WORLD HEADQUARTERS, but don't worry about 
that 'cause I think THE PIT will do just fine. Third we need some distro-sites.
Anybody out there reading this that runs a good H/P/A board, drop me a note 
and I'll see what I can do. And finaly we need some EXCELLENT IDEAS not just
the same old shit like "HOW TO BUILD A BEIGE BOX" O.K. now that we have this 
understanding I'll get started.

********************************THE SHOCK BOX*******************************

Have you ever been out Beige Boxing?
You know the clips are set...
Your ready to dial up your favorite 900 #
or your best friend in New Zeland
you pick up the handset and......there's a
person on the other side!

I know when this happens to me I get VERY pissed off and you should too. I 
mean U spend the time to get set up U are the one risking your butt to make
this call U are the one whodoes everything and this person on the other side
thinks that just because they pay the phone bills they can use their phone
line whenever they want! Wlll you don't have to put up with it anymore.  
That's what I said to myself and I came up with a "BOX" that like I said 
actually shocks the phone line open. In Laymens terms it hangs up both
parties, leaving U the boxer an open line to use! It's VERY easy to construct
requires NO soldering like some other boxes do. and can be built in about 20
minutes or less.  Most of the parts can be found around your house and if
they are not there then they can be procured(*wink*) from your local 
RAT SHACK. You will need the following:

MATERIALS
CHECKLIST

---    1-9v Battery
---    1-9v Battery clip
---    3ft of Speaker Wire(thats just to let U know the size.)
---    1-SPST stwich(Duh A regular ON/OFF one)
---    2-aligator clips
---    1 Role of Electrical tape
---    1-LARGE Capicator(I don't know the size but it should be about 2x2in.)
---    AT LEAST 3 BRAIN CELLS(If you don't have that Don't bother reading on)


When you have all these items you put them together NO not in any old way but
in the EXACT ORDER I HAVE BELOW:

Instead of typing up the directions I have opted to give U a diagram.

Well I think that that is self explanitory enough don't you.  Now how to use
it (in my opinion it's self evident but to those of you who still think
having 30 million gigs of W†â‚z is |<-R/´d it is nececssary to explain So I 
will!!)All you have to do is dis-connect the Beige Box and hook up the 2 
aligatorclips to the RED and GREEN terminals on the phone line box. flip 
the stwich on(that completes the circut and lets the juice flow into the 
cAPICATIOR where it will build up to approxmitaly 38.2 volts! All you need 
to do now isto turn the stwich off which will break the circut allowing the 
electricty to leave the cAPICATOR through the Aligator clips into the phone 
line. Here it will open up the line and give U a dial tone when U re-hook up 
your beige box.

Trouble shooting:

Problem: Dosent work
Solution: START THE HELL OVER(does the battery work?????)

Problem: I get shocked!
Solution: Make sure U are not touching ANY metal on the Shock box.

Problem: I got Caught!
Solution: Use the time in the slammer jail writing atricles 4 
THE HACKER'S WAREHOUSE!

****************************************************************************
Well that about does it for this issue of THE HACKER'S WEARHOUSE I hope you 
it.  I shold be putting these out at the rate of 1 per week but if you would
like to become a writer for HW please feel free to copy the header and write 
away save it as HW000*.txt (where * = issue #) and U/L it to THE PIT.
If you have an questions drop me a line under the ANARCHY sub in AOTE Net.
One more thing it dosen't have to be a H/P/A article. Look at some of the
VAS files they have "Creative Suicide techniques","Canible's Cook Book"
"How to kill someone" and the such. So if U can come up with a GOOD topic
Go 4 it. Just leave me a message telling me what the file # will be. 
SEE 'YA!
