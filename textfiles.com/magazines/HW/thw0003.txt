        Well I never thought I'd make it to issue 3 but here I am leading
the way with new inovative ideas for all the H/P/A'ers out there.  After 
writing the first issue I decided that I will use a format for what kind of
topic will be discussed in each issue it will(as far as I know) go like this:
A phreaking topic, then a Misc., followed by a HUGE Anarchy. This is the
arangement that I will use but U don't have to follow it. Remember U can
write about anything U want to just make sure it's good.  With all this 
said and done I now present "16 super ways to PISS THE HELL out of your 
neighbors!"


--------------CUT HERE-----------------------CUT HERE----------------------

        Do U have some of THOSE people next door that piss the hell out of
U.  I know I have this problem and I needed a Great solution so....I came
up with this. "THE HANDY-DANDY-PISS-THE-HELL-OUT-OF-YOUR-NEIGHBOR-THAT-PISSES
THE-HELL-OUT-OF-U-MANUAL" Let's get started....

-Tie some strong fishing line to their door knocker and run it over a tree
branch then walk about 50 yards away. Pull the string and knoock on their 
door about 5 million times. They'll open the door...no one's there...knock 
again as soon as they shut it do this about 25 times.

-Order 20 pizzas to your neighbor. Amazingly enough, they might invite U
over to help them eat it! And because of how lazy pizza delivers are they 
won't make them pay for the pizzas!

-Draw a white chalk outline on their sidewalk then pour some ketchup on it
this looks an awful lot like a murder scene and if you outline the area in
YELLOW construction tape it looks even better.

-Buy 100 LARGE GRADE A eggs and lay them all over their front steps or porch 
when they come out to get the morning paper......YUMMYYYYYYYYY!

-Super glue their screen door shut.

-Collect as many of those little cards that fall out of magizines then have
the issues sent to your neighbor(remember to mark the card BILL ME LATER!)

-Shove lagre pieces of fruit up the tailpipe of their car.

-If they are having a BBQ stwich their propane with gasoline.

-On the 4th of July aim all your bottle rockets at their windows.

-Cover their driveway in tacks POINT UP(U woulden't belive how many people
screw this up!)

-Go to your local garden store and buy 100 lbs of manure...dump it all over
their car!

-Take a Shit in a baggie and wing it at their front door.

-Tell them U got locked out of your house and U would like to stay inside 
until your parents get home.  When they leave the room Piss all over their
furniture.

***BET U NEVER HEARD OF THESE NEXT 3***

-egg their house

-Throw rolls of toilet paper over their trees.

-Empty 5 cans of Shaving cream all over their car

***PRETTY GOOD IDEAS HUH?***

-Unrole 3 packages of toilet paper so they are laying flat. Spray them with
WD40 or CRC. Re-role them up and wrap a small tree(like an apple or cherry tree) 
with them. Then whip out your handy lighter and create the best baked apples 
this side of my grandmother's kitchen!

Well that about does it for this issue I have no idea if U will see a third
'cause my fingers might fall off.  See Ya'!!
