        Well I'm Back with a new issue that I never thought I'd get done but
I did so here it is. It's really no big deal just some stuph U can do with
FAX Machines. Hope U like It!

****************************************************************************
INTRO-
        In the late 80's people saw a massive explosion in the popularity 
of fax machines.  Everyone has one.  They are cheap, easy to use, and very 
usefull.  Up untill now, however, they have been almost exclusivly in the 
province of the buisness world.  Just for those of you who have been in comas 
for the last few years, I'll explain fax machines to you.Fax machines are 
combination scanners/modems/printers.  You can transmit the contents of a 
piece of paper to another fax over the phone lines. Usually, your fax also 
prints the number you called from on the first sheet of the transmittal.  
It is easy to see why buisnesses like these.  No longer content with Federal 
Express, now letters can go cross country in minutes.  Faxes have about 
200-250 dpi resolution, and print out on rolls of thermal paper.  For some 
odd reason, most of them are 4800 baud.

THE GOOD PART-

        "So what" you ask?  Most people don't seem to realize the potential 
available here.  When I worked at an office, we used to get faxes all the 
time, with requests for checks.  Occaisionaly, we also got short notes from 
the idiots at the other banks. This is what gave me the idea for what I call, 
for lack of a better term, Fax Piracy.

Fax Piracy is the ultimate crank call.  Let me give you an example.

        There was this Library I hated, and, like everyone else, they have a 
fax.  So what me and a few of my freinds did was send them requests, "from" 
another Library for books.  I found out later, from a kid who worked there 
that they wasted about $50, sending them all the books.  Not much, but if you 
know how cheap librarians are, you can imagine the shit fits they had. Next, 
we send them a "Mobius Fax"  we got some sheets of black construction paper, 
taped about 10 of them together, and started feeding them through the fax. 
Once the start of the long sheet we had created came through, we taped it to 
the end. This went on continuosly for about 15 minutes untill their (very 
expensive) thermal paper ran out.  Since we had sent them nothing but black 
paper, it completely covered and ruined all of their paper.  This used up 
their 3month paper allocation at once, and they had to borrow from petty cash 
to buy more. Finally we sent them a little note, telling them what idiots they 
were, and signing it 
                        "the fax pirates"

HOW TO DO IT-

        First, and this is VERY IMPORTANT- Always remember to REPROGRAM the 
fax so it displays someone elses name and number.  If you forget to do this, 
its like sending a letter bomb with a return adress. Second, decide what to 
send.  This is entirely up to you (duh) , and depends on whether you want to 
annoy them, or really destroy them.  Wierd requests from other campies you 
hate, long rambling stories, or strange art is always good.  Be a little 
creative. Third, send it. (wow, some people need to be told everything, don't 
they) What?  You don't know their fax #?  Its not in information?  Its not 
in the phonebook?  Well, keep reading dumbass!

HOW TO GET FAX PHONE NUMBERS-

        This is just way easier than it should be.  Call and ask.  I'm 
serious, we've done this probably over 30 times, and NO ONE HAS EVER 
QUESTIONED OUR REQUEST!  I'll give you a sample of a call that actually 
happened. (this is verbatum)(we taped it)

IBM LADY     Hello, IBM, may I help you?

ME           Hi, this is Biff Fulgate from over here at Linear Data Systems
             Can I get your fax number, those boys in research need to send
             something over and they lost the number again.

IBM LADY     Please hold on a moment

ME           Sure thing. Hah, those cooks over in research would probably
             lose their heads if they wern't screwed on.

IBM LADY     Haha.  Now is that the Tower 700 number?

ME           Um...let me check here... Yeah, that's it. (Tower 700? what?)

IBM LADY     Ok, hold on

        (Long wait during which I get slightly nervous)

IBM LADY     Ok That number is 215-xxx-xxxx 

ME           Thanks, Bye

        
        Also, most ads have fax numbers.  Don't fuck with little companies 
though. 
A) they don't need it,  
B) they are probably more suspicious,  
C) it hurts them more than it would hurt a big company. 
Be a caring capitolist.

        If you need any suggestions as to who's number to get try the 
following- newspapers, radios stations, big companies, libraries, city & 
state governments, the right to life movement, ect.
        
HINTS-

        Act like you know whats going on at all times.
        Be polite, and a little bit familiar
        Make sure you have a plausable reason for getting the number
        Don't laugh
        Let the person who sounds most 'adult-like' make the call
        Make sure you have a plausable name

Remember, the larger the company, the less the people know and care about 
other parts of the company, so the greater chance you have of not getting 
hassled. ALSO! Don't forget to change the "number" you are calling from.

If you want to send a Mobius Fax, usually Faxes have paper feed trays (we 
didn't know that when we did it)

ALSO- NEVER, EVER, DO THIS TO ATT!


HOW TO GET A FAX TO USE-

        Well, if you don't have one, try mommy's or daddy's office.  Most 
Campus offices have faxes you can pretend that you are supposed to be using 
(tell them the Library sent you). Many print-shops (like Kinko's) have fax 
machines that you can use for a nominal fee.  And, just like terminals in the  
early 80's, most fax machines are just sitting out in offices, if you dress 
nicely, and look like you know what you're doing, no one is going to ask 
questions.

CONCLUSION-

        Welp that about does it for issue number 2 of THE HACKER'S WEARHOUSE
