    included in this issue of pez magazine; the big reet pez goodbye 
 announcement, francis rips on ansi-'zines - kinda, a proposal for change, 
 death, carnage, maiming, sex with amputees, what's hot and what's not, 
 beastiality, necrophilia, taco bell, quantum physics, pop-tarts, skinny 
 women and sex, the seven spikes of boognish, francis' hit list, an ode to 
 pip the angry youth, randomness, the warez song, a final music commentary, 
 pavement, greets, all the secrets of spam uncovered, submissions too shitty
 to be seen in my beautiful 'zine, invaluable information for warez doods, 
 zany hi-jinx, and other stuff that black francis finds amusing!
    you should be thanking us you slimy, greasy, worthless, pathetic, little 
 worm.

 ============================================================================

    welcome, once again, kids.  i'm black francis and i'll be your captain on 
 the good ship pez for this lovely evening.  uh, or day.  whatever it happens
 to be while you're reading this.  let's get straight to the point here.  
 this is the very last issue of pez magazine.  i like to keep these things 
 pretty short, so instead of yapping about it here, just read the next 
 article.  go on.  go read it.  i can't hold your hand all the time, you 
 know.

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================
    
    red was a good idea whose time has not yet come.  _i_ thought that red was 
 the perfect chance for people to speak their mind about whatever they like 
 and have people all over the country see it.  apartantly, i am not in the 
 majority.  it just never caught on.  oh well.  life goes on.
    i guess i was partialy to blame for the whole failure of red.  after
 all - i am the president and founder and stuff.  the problem is/was, that i 
 started red in about a day.  it was an on-a-whim type of thing.  i had one 
 file ready to go, i only had one member (myself), and that was red right 
 about there.  not much of a t-file group, i suppose, but, my intentions were 
 good.  i'm not one of these people that are out starting groups strictly so 
 they can become well-known in the computer "scene".  that's not me at all.  
 you'll probably understand why i started it in the first place after you 
 read my editorial on ansi mags in this issue.  if not - i may as well tell 
 you now.  i felt that e-zines are one of the greatest ways for the average 
 joe to get himself heard.  they cost absolutely nothing to run - and they 
 can reach almost anyone as long as they have a computer and a modem.  why 
 someone would waste this opportunity to review colored blocks is beyond me, 
 but, i'll bitch about that later.
    all whining aside - i'm through with red/pez, whatever you know it as.  
 i'm basically the only writer, and i'm way too busy to keep it going on my 
 own.  dead cheese is too wrapped up in muds to help out, i haven't heard 
 from intestinal scum-mokey in months, and that's about it.  mogel wrote an 
 issue, a few people promised me an issue or so, and everyone else wrote 
 something for me and then quit.  blah to them.     maybe some day when i 
 know what the fuck i'm doing, i'll start up another t-file group.  there 
 aren't enough good 'zines out there.  nothing really entertains me, except 
 for gasp, and that's only when pip writes, hoe has turned "serious", and, 
 uh, i can't really think of any more 'zines.  well, besides cdc, they go 
 without saying.  if i ever do start up a 'zine again, it won't be for a 
 while.  i'm going to gather up some of my best writing, gather up some loyal
 writers, make sure everything is in check, and then start one up again.  the
 last thing i need is another failure like this piece of shit 'zine.  blah.  
 i'm being too hard on myself.
    i bet you're thinking to yourself, "hey.  there was absolutely nothing 
 funny in that last article."  well, genius, you're right.  i wasn't trying 
 to be funny - just honest - which i think more people should be nowadays.  
 here's a prime example - out of all the people on #ansi on a friday evening,
 nobody would admit to masturbating.  now, please, it's a friday night and 
 you're sitting home on the irc!  i certainly hope you masturbate!  if 
 not - i really wonder what you do with all the sexual fustrations that come
 standard with every teenage boy, and on that note, i'll let you continue on 
 with the final issue of pez magazine.

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================

    i took a long break from editorials, and a general bitchy out-pouring of 
 pent up anger is just bubbling to get out of me.  i really think this topic 
 has to be discussed, so, here goes:
    it's a virtual destop rebellion.  thousands of people are taking the 
 press into their own hands and releasing 'zines.  both on paper form and 
 electronic form.  some more well-known than others.  hell - phrack and cdc 
 are household names.  well, ok, maybe not, but they are well-known.  there's 
 a 'zine for everybody now.  probably the most common subject of 'zines is 
 music.  that goes without saying, but,  there're 'zines on everything from 
 psychopathic moms to poetry, concerts to canine tragedys, and anorexia to.. 
 dare i say it?  ansi.  it seems that you can't escape from them.  everywhere
 you look, it's a new ansi 'zine.  ack!  i'm sure the ansi-'zine trend will 
 blow over in due time, but, it's the fact these people have the power of 
 mass communication in their hands, and they use it reviewing colored blocks!
 gee, who made the best colored blocks this month?  hmm.  boy.  how many 
 different ansi mags does it take to say "hey, somms did a real nice ansi 
 this month."?  if it wasn't for the programming, er, i mean, "coding", then 
 there would be no difference whatsoever.  i read abot two ansi mags not too 
 long back, and i was sick of them already.  imagine that.  sit down, kids, 
 why francis tells you a story.  it's the story of thomas paine.  maybe 
 you've heard of him.  maybe you haven't.
    in 1776, thomas paine, a radical long hair if there ever was one, 
 published "common sense", an impassioned call to ditch the bristish.  thomas
 paine was the first true "editor-rebel".  he almost died for freedom of the 
 press.  maybe that doesn't mean anything to any of you, but it says a lot to
 me.  jesus, i sound patriotic.  eek!
    anyway, what thomas paine almost died for, we use and abuse like it's 
 nothing.  you probably can't even begin to fathom the power that mass 
 communication holds.  while i know i'm surely not capable of something like 
 a revolution, in the right hands, the thoughts and words of one man could 
 change the world.  it's not as unbelievable as it sounds.
     hey.  if it wasn't for phrack - i wouldn't be able to hack a vmb.  if it
 wasn't for cult of the dead cow - i wouldn't have a copy of "fuck the world"
 hanging in my locker at school.  it gave me a whole new outlook on life.  
 really.  that's the kind of power inveloped in mass communication, and with 
 most households having at least one computer, it's dirt cheap and easier 
 than ever to get your word across.  even if you want to do something as 
 simple as explain the differences between your favorite soups - you're 
 making a difference!  trust me!
     so, please, i beg of you.  before you go and start yet another ansi 
 'zine, think about what you really want to say to the world.  think long and
 hard about it.
     
     remember, kids, it's more helpful than it is funny.

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================

    here are some things that have been on my mind, yet, not important enough
 for me to devote my time to writing an editorial about them ::

    i really hate this new "grunge/thrift store" fashion trend.  now it's 
 impossible to tell if a girl is really grungy and dirty and stuff, or if 
 she's just really fashionable.
    speaking of the whole thrift store thing; that's where i get my clothes.
 the thrift store and sometimes i get jeans at the gap.  people call me 
 trendy and stuff and say i dress weird just to get attention and what-not, 
 but, actually, i just don't have any taste in clothes.  so there.

    really skinny women are too hard to have sex with.

    there aren't enough bass players out there.

    a taco at taco bell costs less than a can of dog food.  now, that's 
 scary.  very scary.

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================

    the blinking cursor beckons me, yet, i can't think of shit to write.
 writers block should be outlawed.  right along with periods.  not periods as
 in the punctuation, silly.  periods as in menstrual cycles.  bah.  you 
 know - when your "woman" is bleeding profusely.  i won't elaborate because 
 it'll just piss me off more than it already does.  ok.  maybe outlawing them 
 is a little harsh, but don't you think once a month is just a tad too 
 frequent?  i'm lucky if i can get a good shit in every month.  bah, once 
 again.
    boredom breeds inginuity.  that's how soap on a rope was invented, i 
 think.  i could be wrong.

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================

    meat is murder, and murder tastes really good with an order of large 
 fries and a sprite.

        snort grunt sniff.  oink.
                                   - jalopy the aged
                                     (circa 47 b.s.)
        
   "gather 'round my spamlings.  spamfather has a story for you all," said 
 the old, rusty can of spam.  all the little 1 oz. cans of spam gathered 
 around the old, rusty value size spam known only as spamfather.  even some 
 of the adult cans of spam scooted over to where spamfather sat on the shelf 
 to hear the story they had heard many times since since the first time 
 spamfather told them -- for, at one time, they too were little spamlings.
   
   nobody knew how long spamfather had been sitting on that shelf in a small
 grocery store owned and operated by an elderly korean man.  some said
 spamfather was older than the store -- That he had been borne from the great
 hog's breath fully a year before the korean man (then a young man) had 
 started the small store.  nobody knew spamfather's real name either.  there 
 had always been rumors on this topic.  most thought his real name was julio.
 some thought it was fred.
   
   whatever his name might have been, he was the most respected spam on the 
 shelf.  He had been sitting on that shelf, in the same spot, since before any
 of the present spams had been borne of the hog.  any spam that might have 
 been present when spamfather was a spamling had long since disappeared due to
 being sold, little debbie raids, or even... the bleakness.
    
   "what is it, spamfather?  what have you to tell us?" asked the spamlings.
   
   "it is time, my spamlings, for you to learn the secret of spam.  I 
 suffered much for this knowledge.  all grown spams know of our origins.  now
 it is your time to learn the secret of the spam," explained spamfather.
   
   and this is what he said. . .

   "in the beginning, there was pork.  lots of it.  so much pork you could
 feed a small nation on it for years. . .  or make a quick lunch for dom 
 deluise.  the great hog had created the swine in his image.  The swine were a
 never-ending supply of food to him, and his chefs had developed many tasty 
 recipes using the meat of the swine, called pork, which frequently involved 
 chee-tos, chocolate, fecal matter, and fava beans.  but the swine were not 
 pleasing to the great hog.  they pooped too much.  he decided to alter them.
    
   "he strode into his great kitchens and began to create.  he started with a
 bad cut of pork, adding bits of pork stock which include such tasty parts of
 swine as the foot, ears, intestines, anus, tail, and the penis.  He added 
 spices, monosodium glutamate, natural flavorings, and. . .  A secret 
 ingredient of his own creation.
   
   "upon tasting his new recipe, the great hog exclaimed, 'this is something
 wonderful I have made!  It's spicy!  It's ham!  It tastes like dog food!  I
 shall call it spam!'
   
   "he called for his chefs to come taste his wonderful, new creation.  many
 squealed in delight at the pleasant aroma and unappealing taste of the spam.
 most retched on the floor.
   
   "never the less, the great hog commanded that his spam should be canned
 and sold to middle to lower class families around the world.  it should have
 the word 'spam' in big letters on the front, along with a picture of spam 
 that has been cooked like ham. . . only it's spam so it has an unearthly red
 color to it.
   
   "spam swept the grocery stores of the world like wildfire.  it became the
 official food of the southern american rednecks.  blue-collar, white, family
 men were clamoring to bring this nectar of the hog back to their respective
 families so that their wives might beat them about the head with the cans,
 and so their children might blow chunks into their faces in disgust.  debates
 were fought over kitchen counters, battles waged on such fields of glory as
 dining room tables and living room floors, as to the identity of the secret
 ingredient that gave spam such a distinctive taste.
   
   "and what is this secret ingredient, you ask, my spamlings?  This 
 mysterious additive that has caused such strife in homes across this glorious
 earth?  the very lifeblood that courses through our flesh?  why, this 
 wondrous mystery of spam is quite simple, really. . .  it's urine!  that's 
 right, my little spamlings!  urine!  but, not just any urine.  goodness, no.
 it's the urine of the great hog!  
    
   "you now know what we mean when we say that all spam is borne of the hog.
 you are all very special, what with the great hog's pee-pee invigorating your
 bodies, as are we all.  fight little debbie, control the bleakness, and be
 eaten with pride, my spams.  for that is what you are.   you are spam."

                                applelicious

   ever see those commercials for apple jacks cereal?  in each one, the whole
 damn thing is about why the group of kids likes apple jacks cereal so much.
 this is the plot of each commercial:

        some older dork comes up to a bunch of younger kids who happen to be 
        eating apple jacks.  this older person asks the kids why they like
        apple jacks so much.  then some "trivia show/time to answer" music 
        comes on.  after a few seconds of trivia music, the kids come up with
        the inevitable rebel answer. . . "we just do, okay?"  then some 
        guitar screeches and the kids pose for a group photo with their apple
        jacks.  the photo is labeled something like "apple jacks '94."

   oh joy.  almost as bad as the god damned mentos commercials (see red #3).
 i decided to find out just exactly why those damned kids likes the apple 
 jacks so much.  i went to my local supermarket and grabbed a box of apple 
 jacks.  i'm not sure if I paid for it--that dude in the blue vest was pretty
 pissed--but that's not what's important.  it's the damned cereal I'm testing
 here.
   
   i brought the box home and opened it up.  i took out a red-speckled O.  i
 ate it.  it was good.  i still didn't know why the kids liked apple jacks.  i
 took out another.  it was good.  i still didn't know why the kids liked apple
 jacks.  i took out another.  it was good.  i still didn't know why the kids

 i took out another.  it was good.  i still didn't know why the kids liked

        whoa there, sparky!  we'd just like to cut in here because the 
        article goes on for another 2,500 or so apple jacks.  let's just cut
        to the chase, shall we?

 //////didn't know why the kids liked apple jacks.  i took out another.  it
 was good.  in fact, it was damn good.  it sparkled in my mouth like the dried
 urine of sewer rats.  it raced my blood like the alcohol that kills so many.
   i had found it.  apple jacks were good because my armpits can talk.  they
 race to pork 'n beans that fill my every emotion.  my shining toenail had 
 flaunted its last.  there's a time for every poop.  a time in timbuktoo.

     alright, alright.  maybe we "edited" a few of them.  and maybe, just
  maybe, we wrote a couple.  and there's a SLIGHT possibility that dead

    here's an excerpt from an article i found while rummaging through an 
 issue of "blaster" magazine about teenage sysops.  it profiles one
 "dexamphetamine" aka "the stallion" from 707, wherever that may be.  he runs 
 a board called "the 7 spikes of boognish" and if you know this person, 
 please kill him.  he is giving all of us a bad name.  please read on ::

 [----]

    "run by the 15 year-old stallion, the 7 spikes of boognish is devoted to
 truely odd denizens of the ethery underworld.  
    `most of them are crack-head pyschos who think in a slightly different 
 dimension,' writes the stallion.  `the 7 spikes of boognish is a hangout 
 where ya can jive with your fellow criminally insane punks.'
    the stallion takes pride in the fact that he has provided for himself 
 `the only bbs in 707 area code that i think is neat.'  his idea of culture 
 and originality is, oh, shall we say... different.  `the 7 spikes has the 
 most uniquely negative and repulsive atmosphere i've ever seen.  it's like a
 hard blow to the groin.  it all boils down to one thing: who can strike 
 below the belt first?'
    the stallion's online persona reeks of cold, heartless violence.  he 
 writes in his own cryptic way: "i see people, and if they're a luzer, i want
 to kill them.  from then, it's just up to the voices in my haid to see what 
 happens.  i ain't no college boy.  sometimes i think i'm back in 'nam even 
 though i never was.'"

 [----]

    kill him.  please.  soon.  i'll pay you.  in case you do live in 707, or
 at least call 707, you may want to call and pester him or make death threats 
 or something constructive.  the number for the 7 spikes of boognish is 
 (707)575-6916.  speaking of death..

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================

    if anybody would kill the following people, i would greatly appreciate 
 it.  i'd even be willing to trade you an ascii.  thank you.

 :: mogel's random story time ::
 :: submitted by :: mogel ::

    once upon a long time ago, there was a company that didn't like the 
 company it was in and a man who had a plan to no longer be a man.  there was
 also a lot of other people, but we'll get to them later.  the man with the 
 plan had a name of a man and that name was ralph.  he was a member of the 
 company that didn't like the company it was in and he didn't like their 
 company.  so he quit.  that's enough about the company.
    once upon a time the man with the plan to no longer be a man gave himself
 a hand.  but, then he found a woman who enjoyed clapping (immensly) and let 
 her do it for him.  for a while he wondered what to do with the two free 
 hands, but this was a short-lived problem because he soon realized she 
 wanted applause just as much as he did.  so he gave her a hand.  the man 
 with the plan to no longer be a man and who occupied hands decided to take 
 a guitar and form his own band.  this, of course, fell through.
    once upon a time, a long time ago, i forgot my own name and read 
 seventeen lines up and realized it was the same and it came to me while 
 riding this plane that i've always wished i could fly.  but, always is such 
 a long time ago.  one day a man who was tall and made me feel small took in 
 hand each one of my balls and decided that he was going to squeeze.  seeing 
 as i'm the man with the plan to no longer be a man, you'd think it wouldn't 
 really bother me, but the plan to not be a man had nothing to do with being 
 a woman and everything to do with growing wings and flying around heaven.  i 
 don't believe in heaven, or at least i didn't until the woman who enjoyed 
 clapping (immensly) decided she was going to scream and cheer on my behalf.
    once upon a long time ago, december turned into january and i wish there 
 was more that i could say, but that about sums it up.  no longer pissing in 
 a cast iron cup.  so, the company started getting along with it's company 
 and the man enacted the plan that would no longer make him a man, and now 
 he's a fan!  go figure.
    once upon a long time ago, my fingers hurt from typing and i had to pee.
 if i was made of doll parts, it would probably be ken or maybe he-man.  but,
 he-man's an action figure and not a doll so i don't think he-man counts.  
 damn.  some day you will bake like i bake, with a touch of sugar and a 
 sprinkle of cinnamon!

 [----]

    well.  uhm.  that was, uh, different.  yeah.  different.  you know, that 
 part about he-man and ken got me thinking;
    ken has no penis and barbie has no vagina or nipples, but yet, she has 
 tits.  he-man has no sexual organs either, i think.  actually, i think he 
 may have nipples but i'm not sure.  i haven't seen a he-man in a while.  
 but, if i had to guess who got more, i'd have to go with ken.  definitely.
    she-ra was a bitch.

    your taste in music _sucks_!  you're a loser, and you listen to crappy 
 music, and you'll never amount to anything, and you're stupid, and you're 
 just a worthless pile of crappy suckiness waiting to explode into a 
 supernova of stupidity and wasted sperm.  or something.     well, maybe that 
 doesn't fit you to a tee, but, i know it fits most people perfectely.  so, 
 in a random act of kindness and goodwill, i've decided to tell you exactly 
 what music is worth your time.  this lil' list here will help you tonnes to 
 be more like the amazing slab of cool that i just so happen to be.  it'll 
 also help steer you away from music that'll make you look like even more of 
 a moron than you already may be.

    the final super-duper stinky greets ::

    these greets are dedicated to the people who keep the 'zine-scene alive.
 mainly pip, james hetfield, edicus, mogel, and whoever i may have forgotten.
 no!  that doesn't include ansi-'zines, stupid!
    other insignifigant people i feel the urge to greet; spiff, dash, dead 
 cheese, socs, morpheus, blurr, tim, and laura.  if i forgot to mention you, 
 you're obviously not important enough for me to remember.  stuff _that_ in 
 your stocking.

    jeremy kister is a necrophiliac, stephen turner is a pedophile, and your 
 mother gives good head.  ha ha!  i am funny!

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================

    well, that's it for this issue and this 'zine.  i hope you found it 
 somewhat entertaining.  if not, why the hell have you read this far?  
 stupid.
    anyway, t'was fun.  i guess dead cheese will run off to play muds again, 
 and i'll, i'll, uh, write for gasp or hoe or something.  i guess.  i really
 hate ditching my own 'zine.  the best part about is was that i had total 
 control over what i wanted people to read and getting my message across to, 
 uh, however many people read this piece of crap.
    peace out, holmes.  i'm audi five-thousand.
    keep circulating the tapes.
