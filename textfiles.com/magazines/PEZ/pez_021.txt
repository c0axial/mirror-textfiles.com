        welcome to the first issue of pez, which, in actuality, is
the 21st issue of red magazine.  sound confusing?  well, for a while now, 
i've published red magazine.  for 20 issues, to be exact.  after stumbliing
for a while and releasing files just to release them, we have decided to try
and find a direction for ourselves.  so, here we are.  a new format and a 
new name.  this format is actually more "'ziney" than the previous format
and has more crap for everyone.  we certainly hope you enjoy it.  if there's
anything you'd like to see, or you have any comments in general, you can
call the pez whq at (215)750-0392.  we could also use more writers since the
new format makes a demand for more articles, so, if you're interested, pick
up the application inside this pack, fill it out, upload it to gba,  and 
you're set.
        
        also, if you didn't know, we've made dead cheese head editor of pez.
he'll fix all our booboos.  but, he can't fix my lower case letters!  no!
buahahahaha!  that's how elite i am!  i don't use capital letters!  oh.  uh.
sorry.  anyway, enjoy the 'zine.

        this is actually some new user feedback that i got on my board.  this
is completely 100% serious.  i guess it wouldn't hurt to mention that he's
got a 2400 baud modem.

        maybe _you_ haven't heard of "godd", but, around here he's basically
a celebrity.  if you have never heard of him, i suggest that you pick up hoe
#60 ( hogs of entropy ).  if you have, you've probably heard of his stupid 
little group, too.  the "text forcasters."  i thought i'd share with you some
excerpts from the text forcasters first issue.  the whole file is available
on godds bbs in 215, or you can download it from the shitty goup section of 
my bbs.  it's made up of quite a few files, including a "box" which godd
claims to have created ( it's in actuality a star-command ).  here it is - 
raw and unedited - the text forcasters :

Your BasiK FedS are allowed to chase down the bbsz in the area to keep
the eleet heads off the scene.Cover Your ass. this is how to protect your bbs
from any charges that maybe forced on said bbs' staff.First thing is make
one of your application questions ... this and this exactly 
"Are you in anyway connected to Law Enforcment,Federal Agencies or Private
invs. services, parties. that legel binds em in court.... if they lie about
and make sure that its known that liarsw of info have no right to anything
to do with the bbs. then if it gets to court if their right to any info 
obtained is null/void. also Make a bulletin which expresses that if a user(s)
reads this and does not send email saying they disagree to it then they are
considered in agreement. and in the bulletin state "That at logon without
disagreeing a user forfeits his right to tell,explain, devulge any information
about the bbs of any nature to local,federal,private law enforcing or 
investigation agencies,parties or servicies. Now! big thing is.
Lets say a fed comes on ... dont delete em .... dont worry. They're are some
walkin fedz .... let em on ... at your shareware access.
email them saying account is only good for 1 week do to the nature of this 
PRIVATE BBs. always include that your a priavte and not public bbs so you can 
reserve the right to rake and grant access levels and sort from and to users.
NeXt is alwayz have a good copy of what the hell is going on out there fed
wise... once and while someone will upload to the other bbs in the area or 
maybe yourz the list of fedz they know of .... hold on to each update.
Also ... you can do as i did and have this notized by JD&F Law Associates for
20 bucks.... your bulletin and shit, it rulez, then your toally covered
becuase its a binding contract and not just a Verbal type Agreement.
Thankz for the time ....
and Dont FaLL

artist : ass ponys
album  : electric rock music
label  : a&m records
rating : eight out of ten

        this is exactly what the music scene needs now.  something different.
the ass ponys have a very folky sound to them that i like.  the lead singer,
chuck cleaver, sounds exactly like micheal stipe.  the musical, however, is
much more difficult to identify with.  i wouldn't reccomend this to just 
anyone, however.  if you've heard their first single, "little bastard", and
you liked it, i certainly would suggest the album.  the ass ponys sing about
real-life in a small anytown, usa.  some of it is humorous, and some of it is
just plain odd.  each song is like a different story, and it's great to 
listen to.  the highlights on this album include, "little bastard", "place 
out there", "wall eyed girl", "banlon shirt", "gyped", and "earth to grandma"

   bob lived just next door to me.  he was a nice guy.  he wore nice clothes, 
lived in a nice condo, and talked nicely to people.  last year, he bought a 
nice dog that made nice poops on my front lawn.  i shot the nice dog with a
nice rifle.  it made a nice, red mess all over the ground.  bob came running
out and nicely cried over his nice, dead dog.  i shot him in his nice ass.
   nice bob wasn't able to sit down for a nice month.  he nicely sued me, so 
i broke into his nice house and shot him in his nice ass again.  then I shot 
him through his nice head.  bob made a nice mess.  how nice.
