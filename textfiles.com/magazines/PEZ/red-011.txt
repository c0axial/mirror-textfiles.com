        You know what?  See that Logo up there for ReD?  That SUCKS!  And
they DARE call themselves REALLY ELiTE!?  Why, I Mogel will definatly show
Black Francis a thing or two about being ELiTE.  First of all that Logo has
just GOT to go.  Where's the PaZZzZAZZ?  There is none.  People are lible to
think you guyZzz are LaMeRz if you don't make your Logo 12 Screens long.
Sheesh.. and I *thought* I had taught my son (Black Francis) well...I guess
not.  What a p00p-hEad.  

   Here now...let me make him something better....NO CHARGE (this time):

        "Hey, baby.  What are you doing in a dump like this?  Really?  That
sure sucks.  This place is crawling with losers.  What's that?  If it's
crawling with losers then why am I here?  Well, I'm not a loser.  What makes
me not a loser?  Well, for one thing, baby... I got a warez board.  That's
right!  Oh, you like SysOps with ELiTE files, do you?  Well, what if I told
you my board was a TRUE 0-3 day site?  Hey...That's really turning you on!
You know what else??  My board has 20 Affiles!  That's right!!  I'm the 
Courier Headquarters for JABBA!  Hey, not that fast, honey... I'm not done 
yet...Yeah, I know Jabba files are the best Anarchy filez around!  In fact,
they just released a great new file on how to make Ansi Bombs!!  Isn't that
original?!  What's that?  You want to go back to your place?  Sure.. come 
on...YO...HEY, Bar tender would you put this on my tab?  Thanks.  Your house
is only 4 blocks away, huh?  Easy walk.  Anyway, as I was saying.. The other
15 affils are all sorts of WaReZ groups.  We get our wArEz faster then ANYONE
in the Maine Area!  Hey.. maybe we should wait for that until we get there.
Damn.. we are walking really fast here.  Then there's the 4 Ansi groups that
I have... all of the top groups around!  Yeah, I know I'm ELiTE.  Hey, you
have a nice place her.  You love men with WaReZ??!  Well, my board has 55
Gigs of them.  You do know that WaReZ *ARE* a measurement of your penis size,
don't you?  MuuMFF!  uhhhh...."

        the toilet water is my only breakfast.  i remembered a day...it was
a long time ago....where i actually cared about myself...i think there was
something i had....and now i forget what it was.  i liked stories and people
and i liked fun.  i am trapped in my bathroom and i can't get out!  i am 
trapped in my bathroom and there's no fucking way out!  i have gotten used 
to it.  i remembered what it was like to eat real food.  not this.  my 
mother was a great woman.  the first little piggy went to the market.  she
would feed me lots.  she would love me lots.  the next little piggy stayed
home.  i think i have to shit.  that hasn't happened for a while.  the third
little piggy had roast beef.  what the hell is the sun so bright for?  who
is the sun helping out?  i gotta get up.  fuck.  the next little piggy had
none.  oww.. my head hurts.  aaaaahhh the toilet seat is cooooolllddd.. ung.
take a deep breath.  let the shit come.  i hate it when it's slow.  come on 
shit hurry.  i remember more while sitting here.  there's something special
about this shitty coushined seat and the bathroom.  shitting shitting here
with my pants down...ouumm...i feel exposed...and..uuhhahh..i feel very safe.  
i feel like i could write a book in the bathroom...aahhuhh..i really get into 
myself.

        Hah-HEE!  That one was written after an accidental <cough> ummm...
....discovery...of Shrooms.  Heh... I actually don't even remember writing
it.  Speaking of Drugs, I'd like to share a song with you from the
Organization called DARE.  You know, that Anti-Drug (Drug Abuse Resistance
[to] Education...to be exact) group.  This was a golly-great lymeric that was
designed to tell kids to say "no" to drugs....heh...it would probably just 
make them laugh.

The DARE song... lyrics by M. Wagman .... music by J. A. Tartaglia

Today, while we're still young
Before we know the score
We're caught up in a battle
We're victims of a war

Life gets so confusing
Can't tell heroes from the thugs
When our musicians and physicians
And our atheletes fall to drugs

The choices that we have to make
Aren't what our parents had
Not like TV, life's hard to tell
The good guys from the bad

Starting now let's take a stand
And help each other out
Let's learn the ways of saying "no"
That's what D.A.R.E.'s about

We dare ... to keep off drugs
We dare ... to just say "no"

We dare to make this pledge
And let our minds and bodies grow

Wanna sneak some beer?    (kids) Just stand clear!

Wanna smoke some dope?    (kids) Just say "nope"

Wanna take a hit? (kids) No thanks, I gotta split

DARE tells us so

It's our right to say "no"

Wanna try some crack?  (kids) no way Jack!

Got some uppers you might like...  (kids) take a hike!

Do you wanna get high?  (kids) walk on by!

DARE tells us so.

It's our right to say "no"

Wanna pop a lude?  (kids) No Way, Dude!

Wanna snort a line? (kids) no thanks, I'm fine!

PCP will thrill you (kids) man that stuff can kill you!

DARE tells us so
It's our right to say "no"

Important notice from Black Francis :

   Well, since I'm so damned k-rad, I decided to change the ReD logo every
ten releases.  Since this is the 11th, it's the first to be released with our
new logo.  Mogel hasn't seen this one yet, and I must admit, we are lamerz and
my old logo was a lamer-logo-a-rama.  Here it is in case you never saw it
before :

                         ____________________________
                         \___________\_________\_____\
                          \__   __   /     ____/      \
                         / /       _/    ___/__   _/   \
                        / /    /   \          /        /
                        \/____/_____\________/________/
                        "‚Ó/¥úúù ÓúiÁÓ />ÈÈ/>z" p‚ÓzÓÔÁ:

   Yeah.  Pretty lame.  Anyway, what do you expect from lamerz?

   I'm also proud to annouce that I think this file has broken the previous
record for number of times the word "fuck" has been used in a text file.  My
mommy's very proud of me.  She made me print it out and hang it on the 
refridgerator.
