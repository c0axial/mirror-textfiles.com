"Black"
-------
The light fades
Darkness surrounds
My body
Darkness engulfs
My soul

Black
Inside my head
Will I ever
See the light again

Hurt
You hurt me
And left me to decay
To deal with the pain

You never came back
Not even to laugh
Never saw you again
Fading...

"Close"
-------
So close
Too far
You
Me
Together
I love you
No one knows
But you and I
If people knew
I would surely die
I love you
It is not fair
To have you
Then to have you taken away
Why?
I love you

"Death"
-------
Knife to my wrist
I make the cut
I sit and watch
Ready to die
The blood drips
The blood pours
Down my arm
I cry
No pain
No fear
It bubbles
I feel hazy
The phone rings
It's her
I struggle
I listen to her plead to me
I tell her i love her one last time
And scream one last time

"Demon"
-------
A small crack in the earth
Wide enough for a small child
To fit through
With ease

The sky fades to an deep grey colour
And ominous harbinger of doom
A red glow surround the
Crevice in the earth

A cackle is heard
Far in the distance
And the glow fills the sky
Illuminating as if it were day

An evil presence is felt
The crack in the earth widens
And a single, four fingered claw
Reaches out

Yet another claw is seen
As this hellish being
Reaches towards the light
For the first time

It hoists itself out of the crack
Now wide enough for many people to fit
It stands, radiating evil and power
Filling the night sky with it's luminescense

It bellows to Satan
For power, for glory
To take over this small world
And rule forever

The demon stands there
In the middle of nowhere
Granted his wish
Satan has fulfilled this demon's destiny

Now he rules
The whole entire world
But what does he have
When everyone is dead?

The demon
Is alone
And with one mercifull plea to Satan
Vanishes, in a cloud of white smoke

The crack
Small enough for a child to fit into
The only trace of anything
That ever lived

"Happy"
-------
Look
Look at me now
In all my happiness

You
I'm so glad I met you
I'm so glad that we are finally together

Depression was a state of mind
But my happiness
Is now a way of life

I love you
For making me feel like this
You don't know
How you make me feel
Everytime
I hear your sweet voice

"Inside"
--------
Lies
Hurt
Pain
You've done this

Killed me
Took my soul
Left me to decay
On the inside

What have I done
To deserve this
I never tried
To hurt you

And as you look back
And see me dying
You simply turn away
And laugh knowing what you have done to me

I did everything for you
I nearly took my own life
Because i could not have you

It was never real in your world
Although it's all too real in mine
All the pain and emotion
Is now washed away

You scarred me for life
Can i ever love again?
You lied to me
You hurt me

I still love you
Maybe there's a chance
But how can there be
After you have done this

No apology
For what you have turned me into
I'd die for you
You never did anything for me

I will kill him
I will kill you
For you have killed me
On the inside

"Life"
------
Life
Once i crawled
And then i stood
And now i'm back on me knees

Living
What have i done?
Why?
Do i deserve this?

Reaching
For hope
Someone to reach out to
Someone to be there

Holding
Onto the dreams
You gave me
When we were together

Letting Go
Of the memories
You and  I
Once shared

Dying
A slow death
On the inside
Because of you

"Love"
------
Love
What we shared
You and I
Forever

Hate
What you now feel
Towards me
For reasons unknown

This cell
I am confined to
This cell
Of eternal hate

Trying to climb
The rope of life
Yet you throw me down
And leave me to die

Feelings
Never felt before
Now washed away
Because of you

I hate you
I love you
I'm being torn apart
Because of you

"Not One"
---------
I talk to you
Just to hear your voice
I love you so much
I can't let go
I won't let go
You sit and wonder when i'll stop
But i can't stop
I won't stop
You are the only one
Who can save me
Yet you can't take the hint
Won't you take the hint?
I'm hurting
Inside
Am i doing this to myself?
Sometimes
I wish that
I will wake up tomorrow
And realize that it has been
An emotional dream
And none of it ever happened
Save me
You can save me
But you won't save me....

"Rage"
------
I hate you
I always will
Locked me up in this cell
I'll never see the light
You laugh at me
And constantly remind me
Of the good times we shared
Just to see me writhe in pain
You told me you loved me
I said the same to you
And then as I turned around
I felt the knife in my back

Betrayal
Confusion
Hatred
Anger
Love

Your lies have hurt me
Greater than anything else I have known
Although you apologize
You laugh on the inside
Knowing you can have your way with me
Knowing that I will do what you will say
You beg and plead me not to kill him

Anger
Hatred
Lies
Rage
Death
Silence
