I. History        
------------
        
        Hello, lamers!  Ok, well, you see - the hacking/phreaking scene is
literally falling apart at the seams.  It's definitely not what it used to
be.  There hasn't been a decent >original< hack/phreak file in years!  Not to
mention, everybody and their mother runs a h/p/a/v/c board.  Like my mom, but,
she's a lamer anyway.  So, while at Februarys 2600 meeting, something occured
to me.  The perfect idea to spice up 'the scene' - a new box!
        
        Once again, originality came into play here.  What could I do that
hasn't already been done before?  There are boxes for virtually anything out
there.  So, I put my 'Zine Idea Box' into action.
        
        Security.  There we go!  Hacker security.  But, what kind of security?
There are already boxes to block tracing, block caller i.d., etc.  So, my
'Zine Idea Box' went into overdrive for this one.  Then it occured to me.  
When the feds come knocking on my door, I want it so that they won't be able
to find >any< of my boxes!  Ha!  I'm a fraggin' genius, I tell you!
        
        There was my idea.  I passed the idea around to an 'elite few' and 
they loved the idea as well.  It was then and there that I came up with :
        
        The Shoe Box!

III. How to make a Shoe Box
-----------------------------

Materials needed:        
-------------------
1 Money (around $50)
1 A magic marker (any color)

        The only thing you really need for the Shoe Box is some money.  Around
$50 would be good.  The magic marker is extra.  This is how you do it :
        
        Scope out the local mall for a shoe store.  Here are some shoe stores
on the east coast who have shoe box material in stock :
        
        1) Foot Locker
        2) Lady Foot Locker
        3) Athletes Foot
        4) Kinny
        5) Payless Shoes
        6) Tom Mcahn (or something like that)
        7) Buster Brown
        
        Now, go to one of these stores and begin looking at shoes or sneakers.
If you ask for some shoes right away without looking, they may get suspicious
and call the feds on you!  Then, pick out a very cheap pair of shoes.  Try to
find the cheapest pair in the store and buy them.  Try to go for a bigger size
of shoe.  Preferably, something over a 10.  The salesperson will bring you the
shoes unless they don't have them in that size.  If this occurs, simply find
a different pair or get a different size (getting a different size may make
you look suspicious!).  Once you have the shoes, you have the option of trying
them on if you want to look completely unsuspicous.
        
        Then, buy the shoes!  You can throw the shoes or sneakers themselves
away at this point.  They are of no use to you.  All you need is - the box!
        
        Bring the box itself home.  Open it up.  There will be 
white/transparent tissue paper inside that will look like this :

                      /-------------------------------\
                      | ~       ~    ~           ~    |
                      |~    ~    ~         ~  ~    ~  |
                      |   ~   ~     ~  ~         ~    |
                      | ~       ~  ~      ~   ~    ~ <--- Crumples
                      |  ~   ~       ~          ~     |
                      |~   ~    ~      ~    ~      ~  | <--- Tissue paper
                      \_______________________________/

        Take the tissue and throw it away.  It is of no use whatsoever.  Even
less use than the shoes.  Now, if you decide to use it (this part is not 
nessescary to make a successful box), grab a magic marker.  Any color will do.
Take the magic marker, and write on top of the box : 

        "These are shoes!"

        This is to trick feds.  It usually isn't nessescary, but if you want
to be extra precautious, this will do the trick.  Next, take all your other
boxes that you would like to hide from the feds, and stick them inside the 
box.  This keeps the boxes out of sight, mostly, out of the sight of feds!
Now, take the box, and store somewhere such as a closet, or somewhere where
shoes normally go.  Try to put the side that says "These are shoes!" where
everyone who opens the closet (or wherever you decide to hide the thing) can
see it.  This is great fed-protection!
