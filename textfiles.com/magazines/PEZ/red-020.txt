        Listen up, pansy!  There's a time to fuck around and there's a time
to buckle down at get serious.  We've been fucking around long enough here at
ReD magazine, and now we're starting to get serious.  We need to set a 
direction for ourselves, and that's what we're doing.  After this issue, ReD
is making a few changes.  For one, we will be changing our format to a more
'zine-like format.  This means - more articles per issue.  This may or may
not slow down the production of the magazine, we have yet to find out.  We
are also changing our name to better suit the new format.  The new name will
be "Poop Enlightment 'Zine."  Hey, if it has the word "poop" in it - it can't
be all that bad.  Can it?  Anyway, this issue will be a small one.  This 
issue we will give a member listing and a ReD index.  Our new format will
begin next issue which will be PeZ issue #21 - continuing right where ReD
left off.  Hope you pick it up and enjoy it.
        Also, ReD/PeZ Whq is up!  All distro. site sysops are required to
call.  The name is Goat Blowers Anonymous and the number is (215)750-0392.        
This is also where you can upload your writer/distro. site apps.
