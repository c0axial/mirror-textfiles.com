                For Now............

Slowly the sun begins to set
Darkness moves in and smothers the day's last breath
until, finally, it has killed it off
for now
But alas, Darkness does not come alone
for it brings fear and hatred with it
a fear that is not easily overcome
a hatred so great that day dares not shed it's light
for now
Darkness lives as daylight dies
this ageless struggle never ceases
light has once again lost to darkness
for now......

                He Above.....

Shiftless, lying undaunted
waiting for his prey
The serenity of it all
is what guides him through the day
He sparks his flame
hiding his grotesqueness from the light
mutilated by the system
what a horrid sight
Struggling for control
He gropes for a sense of reality
making no sense what-so-ever
his life is a mere parody
Everyone's an opponent
in this wicked game
but he above, above the rest
Leper Messiah is his name

            Amnesia..........

Creeping, smothering Death unbeknownst
The sudden changs shatters everything
pictures of what was......what could have been
Distant memories are all that are left
insomnia, tossing, turning, begging for sleep
the ease of that of which we take for granted is easily forgotten
Darkness comes........eventually.......but not soon enough
thoughts rampage like a herd trampling through your mind
stumbling, clinging, grasping for reality
or something like it
Who are you? Who am I? pondering simple things
Everyone has an answer but they always seem wrong
Try again that was incorrect
Suddenly a light........but as quickly as there was light
darkness
Somehow light forgot about you
leaving you to deal with things still unknown.....

forboding creatures wait for you
beyond...
travel carefully for "things" seek you
pressure you from all sides
some may attract you...
same may entice you...
DO NOT give in
Temptation..........
you'll go...
beyond...
you can't..
you will..
you want..
but you CANNOT!!
quick wit will not protect you
for the beast has it's "ways"
dare you travel beyond........
beyond the gates of Terminal Countdown......

                The Chosen.....

Lead me to the land of wonders
Allow me to fortify my boundaries
Beckon me for now
For I shall be the chosen
Traveling on an endless journey
Seems to me, quite uninhabitated
Destroy me with your words no more
For I know I"m the chosen
Deliver yourself from the evils within
Come and sell your soul
Be admonished of your sins
For I've become the chosen

                Death Bestows.....

Death bestows
eternal happiness, peace with myself
I feel at ease, a calm
a wonderful feeling like no other

Death bestows
Upon me, a pressureless void
no needs or wants, not a desire
a perfect nothing, deeper into nothingness

Death bestows
A feeling that I have live only to die
leave a small impression on the world
then transcend to another dimension

Death bestows
the way it is and always shall be
the eternalness in the end
shall never be surpassed

Death bestows.........

                Disposable hero.....

Society beckons him to no end
they cause for him, remorse and pain
as an everyday man, he is only a friend
with no gratitude it's hard to sustain
To them, he is recyclable
Use it for a while then just toss him away
Cool, calm, not too excitable
His life is of service, and of that it will stay
Unlike Clarke Kent, he has no Lois Lane
He leads an everyday life, no abnormalities
Basically a life of dread, constant disdain
He's useful at time, certain informalities
This is how he's dying
He's dying to survive
I don't know what he's made of
I would like to be that way
Most just beckon him for their needs or wants
Then play him off as a zero
He lives for danger, does his own stunts
Leading the life of a disposable hero

                Disturbed.....

Corruption
mostly of the mind
of course there's always "the system"
Perseverance....to be the richest
the smartest, even the most popular
for what?
what joy do you get?
shouldn't we all just be happy with who we are?
No! What the hell was I thinking?
I must be "disturbed"
So I don't step on the people
who helped make me what I am today
Like you...
SO I don't have the money
to bribe my way into everything
Like you...
So what I don't lie, cheat and steal
to get ahead in life
Like you...
       And I'm the one you call disturbed?

                I thought......

I thought mothers were supposed to love
I thought they were always supposed to be there
I thought they were supposed to care....
                                I guess I was wrong.
What could be more important then their child?
Their own flesh and blood.
Nothing can be more important.
                                I guess I was wrong.
Nevermind the fact that a mother is the most impotant thing
to a child.
Shouldn't it be the same way in return?
Love, flesh, blood, family....the most important things!!??
                                I guess I was wrong.
"Till death do us part..." is heard at weddings.
How often do the children hear that?
I always thought that as I grew older, they would care less
                                I guess I was right

LOVE.
(uh-oh here i go)
Love is stupid
sure, it's great in the beginning
but it fucks you up the ass royally when it's over
it sux dood, i was in love once.
for three fucking years
it was awesome, all that i ever wanted in life
shit she treated me great.
she looked fucking incredible
she was sweet, a little shy and a virgin :)
two months i waited for her to kiss me
 six months we waited to have sex
and i was cool with that.
shit before her, it was like a week, no sex, c-ya
but i loved her
how the fuck could i be in love? I was sixteen 
and i was engaged to this chick.....
well anyway, after time went on, it got a little worse
but it was still great. two years into this it was still OK
but After that, i was to fucking "in LOVE" to let her go.
shit she dogged me
never wanted to see me
never even called me
but i couldn't break it off with her
eventually i snagged her cheatin on me
i dumped her
i cried
i fucking cried like a little baby
why? SHE cheated on me.
fuck man after it was over with her
i thought about her everyday
and I broke up with her
i wanted her back everyday
every girl i was with, i SAW tara (the three year relationship chick)
I couldn't get "serious"
I couldn't LOVE anyone the way i loved her
I compared all the girls to her
i completely dissed a good good friend of mine (female)
she wanted to start a relationship with me
i dissed her
now, i regret it
i lost LOVE 
i coulda had it but no.
to this day, she still sorta has feelings (the second girl i mentioned)
i have feelings to
but she's in philly and i'm here
shit now, i'm in LOVE and i can't have it
LOVE sucks ass

This wasn't meant to be a LiT at first. but when i posted this
so many people responded to it, i decided to go back and cap.

                Suicide Note.....

Friendz, loverz, all who have cared
I'd like to take this time to thank you
thank you for when some of you actually were there
for me
thanx for the timez we spent, the laughter shared
and conversationz we've had
But after a while..............ya'll couldn't deal with the shit.....
the shit goin on in my head, heart and soul
abandoned, I just felt so alone, solo
stranded
That'z what finally made me realize 
that life was no longer worth living
I just don't care about anything anymore
everything I've ever cared for is gone
I'm empty...............just a shell
there has got to be more to life then just that.....
being just a shell.....but that'z all I am
and all I'll ever be so just forget me
It truly was a gift that I had what I had
when I had it
But it is all gone
Vanished е Poof е C-ya е Bu-bye
So As my final request I as of you this........
Please, do not mourn my loss
but
Mourn for what I have not yet given to the world
I love you all
May I forever rest in peace....

          Sketchy Thoughts.....

Words, Freefalling, flowing
like a waterfall
Endless circles running through my mind
Tr Tr Tr Tr Trails of nature overwhelming
Is this a dream? This endless journey
of shapes, colors and light
Tr Tr Tr Tr Trails of nature overwhelming
Put a pen to paper
PEN TO PAPER
Damnit
It's just a dream I tell myself
I'll wake up soon.
But do I wanna awaken?
Tr Tr Tr Tr Trails of nature overwhelming
Knowledge escapes us
At times we nuture it,
like a mellow, groovy tune on the tip of our tongues..........
Tr Tr Tr Tr Trails of nature overwhelming
My inkwell has run dry

                Type.....

Tic Tic Tic Tic Tic Tic
I sit here tapping away as I gaze into my mind
I see hatred punishment (Tic Tic) anger
and flowers
I see a catepillar in a coccoon
As it takes upon a new body I notice something different
It turns...........turns into a dragon
A dragon filled with hate, anger
and shame
I see a tiger recieving abuse she does not deserve
For she is the sunlight that shines
shines in the dragon's heart
The dragon listens to nothing
as it does as it pleases
and will bring down anyone in it's path
yet he has a feeling that this is not right
still he continues on his warpath Tic Tic Tic Tic
the tiger escapes from the pain
and is tearing the dragon apart from the inside
but he still fights, fights harder then ever
as he leads himself away from his conscience
and lets his anger free
free to reek havoc on the land
The dragon is growing Tic Tic Tic Tic
his conscience tells him to get help
but he ignores the cries of mercy
for he is truly evil and should be killed Tic Tic
To this day they still fight
They fight within myself for I am the dragon........
