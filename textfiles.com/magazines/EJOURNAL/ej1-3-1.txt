    Editorial:  Electronic Time Travel

    This issue of _EJournal_ is an exercise in time travel.  Doug
    Brent's essay appeared in November '91.  He heard from Bob Hering
    soon thereafter.  Their exchange got lost in electronic limbo and
    didn't reach us until June '92.  We're sending it out in July '92,
    with a note about how you can re-live last November by sending for
    issue V1N3.  Even though it is being sent in 1992, the V1N3-1
    designation aligns this issue with the "publishing year" 1991.
    Whew.

    We will now add a note to the abstract of the November 1991
    essay, in the Contents file of our Fileserv, saying that there is
    a discussion of its argument to be found in the July '92 issue.

    Our electronic existence, that is, lets us telescope and overlay
    and interpolate texts in ways that can't be managed by book-style,
    codex publications.  It would be possible, for instance, for us to
    re-distribute V1N3 with both November's "Ownership" essay and this
    July issue's follow-up exchange.  That's easy to imagine, and it
    might offer worthwhile convenience to many readers, especially to
    recent subscribers who have perilously little context into which
    they can fit this issue.

    But from there it's only a small step, electronically, to an
    editor's revision of the November essay in a way that reflects
    both Bob Hering's reservations and Doug Brent's efforts in
    rebuttal -- without acknowledging Bob Hering's role in the "new
    original" essay.  We could then file the altered issue in the
    Fileserv and pretend that it had always existed that
    way.                                                           [line 81]

    That won't happen.  One of _EJournal_'s obligations has always been
    to provide authenticated copies --duplicate originals-- to academic
    authorities who still need to use paperclips.  So we will not tamper
    with the "original originals," easy as it would be to do so.  We
    have already turned down one reasonable request to change a spelling
    error.  We have set up our archives (which are way back there, well
    "behind" the versions in the Fileserv) as "read only," of course,
    and we pledge that we will do our best to maintain the integrity of
    those files.  We may make a mistake, someday, but we operate on the
    principle that what we send out will not be tampered with by
    embarrassed time travellers.  That's one reason for publishing
    these supplemental discussions as separate issues, accepting the
    risk of some confusion caused by the distribution of a Volume 1
    ("1991") issue in the middle of the Volume 2 ("1992") calendar year.

Supplement to the Volume 1 Number 3 (November, 1991) essay by Doug Brent,
"Oral Knowledge, Typographic Knowledge, Electronic Knowledge: Speculations
on the History of Ownership"

Here, with their permission, is a discussion between Doug Brent and Bob Hering
on the subject of Doug Brent's "Ownership" article in our November, 1991 issue
(V1N3).  Bob originally sent his comments to Doug personally, but it seemed to
him (and to the editor) that the difference of outlooks represents a
philosophical crux --not just between slightly left and right political views,
but (as the exchange will suggest) between two views of the relative power of
economics and technology.

Readers may want to turn their dialogue into a polylog; we'd be happy to keep
this thread spinning.  You can send for the complete text of the "Ownership"
article with the following message addressed to the Listserver at Albany:

-----Your Article in _EJournal_, Volume 1 Number 3, November, 1991

    Please accept this message as a means of introduction. I am
    presently an adjunct professor at Drexel University. I teach
    graduate and undergraduate management courses as part of the
    Management Division at Drexel.

    I have a 35-year career background in the Information Management
    industry and a long association with the Sperry Corp., subsequently
    merged with the Burroughs Corp., into the Unisys Corp. I have a
    strong interest in computing, telecommunications and information
    management. My skills are specifically in the MS-DOS arena, with
    proficiency in several business, financial, communications and
    graphics applications.

    Your recent article in _EJournal_ is very interesting and
    thoughtful; I would like to offer my comments and observations to
    you.

    General comments:

    The perspective you offer about knowledge ownership across the oral,
    literate and cyberspace constructs contain important, clearly
    delineated comparisons. In addition to the fluidity provided to
    "text" through cybernetics, and the difficulties associated with
    ownership, there are other issues to be considered: legal, right
    to privacy, and corporate and public networking matters come to
    mind, to name a few.

    Perhaps the key point you raise, as part of your conclusions, has to
    do with economics. That area, linked with communal vs. individual
    ownership, could be considered central to many societies and to the
    systems or constructs devised to differentiate one developmental
    phase from another.
                                                                    [line 166]
    A general observation is that, in my opinion, western societies have
    evolved to the point of demanding individuality, which calls for
    intellectual property, and that individuality can be associated with
    value-added, economic independence.

    Your observation that the "...merging of texts into new wholes which
    are inseparable from their makers" (lines 614 & 615), could ensure
    the downfall of the emerging cyberspace construct.

    I will attempt to explain, in the specific comments below, why I
    offer that consideration.

    Specific comments:

    In Section 2, on ownership of knowledge in oral societies, you
    address the inseparability of creativity and performance in
    transmitting knowledge. The "performance" aspect can be directly
    equated to the "transmission or reproducibility" of the knowledge.
    In that sense, the analogy to either the printing press or
    cyberspace is common.

    Even in oral societies, although knowledge was shared, each member
    of the society had his or her specific role just as the teller of
    tales did. The individuality surfaces in the sense of these
    differing roles within the society, what you (or Ong) describe as
    procedural knowledge.

    I agree with your portrayal of knowledge ownership in literate
    societies, (Section 3) with two exceptions, namely,

    a) the "manuscript age analogy" -- the copying of these manuscripts
    can be equated to that done by a Xerox machine, albeit a very slow
    one. It was a mechanical form of reproduction, performed by humans
    (both of which are now "fossilized");                             [line 200]

    b) the "romantic myth" (line 215) - while it is true that people
    draw on the collectiv[Ae past (text or otherwise), certainly there are
    instances that point directly to individuality, independent of past
    knowledge. Names that charaterize independence such as Einstein, Da
    Vinci, and Newton all demonstrated a creative originality that was
    not dependent on past knowledge and substantiate the "myth."  But,
    in general, your point is well taken.

    In Section 4, your reference to the "Boshwash Times," from Hiltz and
    Turoff, stirs some comments. While the notion of a group Nobel Prize
    is entirely conceivable, the suggestion that no member of the group
    contributed more than any other implies communalism, socialism,
    utopianism or just plain contrived modesty. The scenario begs
    reality.

    In Section 6, relative to copyright in cybernetic space, the
    principal of copyrights can and should be maintained even though it
    may be cumbersome. Stealing of intellectual property, text,
    software, or concepts is not unique to cybernetics - it is simply
    easier in this environment. A key factor is one of human choice, to
    act professionally and responsibly. You seem to agree with that in
    the context of "..acknowledging an original creator of an idea."
    Contrary to your conclusion, that is the same as the claim to
    ownership. It simply is not as easy as it was in "fossilized text."

    I have great difficulty understanding your observation that when
    knowledge enters electronic space, "..it seems equally natural to
    surrender it." It is here that the use of cybernetic space for
    advancing knowledge is at great risk.  If safeguards are not put in
    place to protect intellectual property ownership, economic factors
    will dilute the use of this space significantly. Charging for bytes
    and blocks of data (information) is completely independent of the
    knowledge itself.

    In Section 7, with respect to the Bolter paragraph, and the chaotic
    state of electronic writing space, I can only suggest - so is the
    entire physical universe as we know it.
                                                                     [line 239]
    With regard to your reference to communal knowing as optimistic, I
    would humbly suggest that others would view that as a pessimistic or
    negative outlook. You are correct that ".. the relationship between
    economics and knowledge will be rearranged into new formations,...."
    Again, in my opinion, if cybernetics, as a means of creation and
    transmission, is to contribute significantly to human knowledge, the
    value of the creation and the economic compensation to humans will
    be as or more important than it was/is today.

    I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated what your article portrayed and
    the effort your article required. Many more educators, government
    agencies and businesses need to do the same if this very exciting
    new era is to come of age. I wish you the best in your current and
    future endeavors.

    To:  Mr. Bob Hering
    Drexel University

    Bob:

    Thanks for your interesting, thoughtful (and flattering) response to
    my article.  I think that you put your finger on some extremely
    important issues. The differences between our points of view suggest
    two quite different responses to the possible future of cyberspace,
    and reflect, I think, two different philosophies of our relationship
    to technology.  This makes the discussion really interesting.

    Before getting on to what I see as the really important discussion,
    let me clarify the two minor points you address regarding my
    portrayal of knowledge in literate societies.
                                                                     [line 278]
    First, you disagree with my comment that "During the manuscript age,
    the painstaking copying and illustrating of a manuscript was in some
    respects a personal performance of knowledge analogous to the
    performance of an epic poem or folk tale."  You suggest instead that
    manuscript copying can be likened to photocopying.  I don't really
    think so, simply because manuscript copying required the copyist to
    handle each character individually with a loving care that--at least
    until the twelfth century scriptoria made a business of it--was
    often performed as an act of religious devotion.  And although the
    goal was to make the copy identical in *wording* to the original,
    there was no thought of making it *look* like the original.  Each
    was typically illuminated in a highly original fashion that was not
    necessarily copied from the source manuscript.  It is this that
    gives manuscript copying a different psychological texture from
    photocopying, and led Ong to declare the manuscript age "residually
    oral."

    Second, you are not quite happy with my assertion that the idea of
    the individual genius is a romantic myth.  I would certainly agree
    that the idea of the genius is not a myth.  While some toil away
    making minor improvements in the work that has preceeded them,
    others such as the ones you mention make awesome leaps of
    understanding, authoring Kuhnian "paradigm shifts" rather than
    incremental advances.  What I *do* see as a myth is the idea that
    such genius stands alone.  It is always a social genius, a rare gift
    for taking the pieces of a puzzle that others have been forging and
    turning them a totally new way so that they suddenly lock together
    into a new configuration.  It was Newton, I think, who said "If I
    have seen further than others it is because I have stood on the
    shoulders of giants."  (If anyone out there can confirm the exact
    source of this quotation, please pass it on--I've been trying to pin
    it down for years.)

    But enough of the minor details.  On to the meat of the discussion.

    You seems to agree to a large extent with my prediction that
    ownership of knowledge will be more difficult in cyberspace and may
    well disappear.  But you disagree with my assertion that this could
    well be a good thing.  "It is here," you say, "that the use of
    cybernetic space for advancing knowledge is at great risk.  If
    safeguards are not put in place to protect intellectual property
    ownership, economic factors will dilute the use of this space
    significantly."                                                  [line 321]

    What you are saying, in effect, is that given the present economic
    systems that have evolved, people will not continue to produce and
    disseminate knowledge if their right to profit by it (that is, their
    "ownership" of it, not just the polite acknowledgement that they
    thought of it first) is not protected.  If it comes to a choice
    between cyberspace or profit, then, you argue that we will choose
    profit.  Only by protecting the right to profit from intellectual
    labour can we protect cyberspace.

    (I hope I am not mis-paraphrasing you here.  I am not trying to set
    up a straw man, for I think that this is a genuinely tenable and
    respectable position; I am just trying to restate for clarity.)

    You may well be right.  The recent collapse of Communism seems to
    make this view even more persuasive.  A system in which direct
    economic incentives for production were not in place resulted in a
    stagnant economy, a bloated bureaucracy, and ultimately a lack not
    just of consumer goods but of basic necessities.  Human beings do
    not seem well disposed to work (whether planting potatoes or
    developing scientific breakthroughs) for the good of their souls.

    The only way you could be wrong is if the theory of transformative
    technologies states correctly the immense and unstoppable power of a
    communications revolution.  McLuhan asserts, and Ong develops more
    thoroughly, the claim that when communications media shift to the
    extent they did when the alphabet was introduced, everything
    else--social systems, economics, consciousness itself--is dragged
    along with the shift.  This may create short-term economic crises,
    but ultimately the economic system, like everything else, must
    adapt.  This does not mean that the entire capitalist system will
    collapse in ruins; I think that in general capitalism is too strong
    and in the long run too useful (yes, I said useful) to be
    washed away.
                                                                     [line 356]
    This only means that the concept of private property will not be
    applicable to knowledge in the rather crude form that either
    copyright of hard-copy or pay-per-byte electronic systems has thus
    far allowed.  Ownership of knowledge is gradually becoming
    untenable.

    This is a very strong form of technological determinism, but it
    works only on a massive scale.  It does not assert that this or that
    little wrinkle in the technological ether is inevitable -- we can,
    if we like, reject certain forms of technology -- but it does assert
    that some types of global shifts in communications style are
    inevitable in the longer term.  (Try to find a society that has
    successfully resisted literacy once introduced to it.)

    According to this theory, then, if it comes to a choice between
    cyberspace and profit, we will not have the option of choosing
    profit -- at least, not forever. Eventually the cyberspace
    environment will force an entirely new way of thinking about
    knowledge production.  You hit the nail on the head when you call
    this concept, illustrated by Hiltz and Turoff's collective Nobel
    prize, "communalism, socialism, utopianism."  It is indeed
    communalism; that is exactly what I am arguing for.  And it may well
    be utopian, if you mean by that "a good state of being that cannot
    be achieved in today's world."  If you mean "a soft-headed view of a
    future that could never occur," well, I must respectfully disagree.

    In short, then, we have three possible scenarios:

     1.   We manage to maintain ownership of knowledge in cyberspace,
     and cyberspace continues to exist within the present economic
     system.  (I argue that this is unlikely because the nature of
     cyberspace makes it too difficult.  You argue that it is unlikely
     because the nature of economics makes it too difficult.  But
     whereas you think that this would be a positive outcome, I don't.
     Here you and I assign opposite values to the same possible
     outcome.)
                                                                     [line 393]
     2.   We do not manage to maintain ownership of knowledge in
     cyberspace, and cyberspace never develops its potential.  (You
     argue that this is possible because the nature of economics
     prohibits communal knowledge on anything but a relatively local
     scale.  Neither of us likes this possible outcome much, as both of
     us like the possibilities afforded by the cybernetic revolution.
     If we didn't, we wouldn't be sharing this piece of cyberspace right
     now.)

     3.   We do not manage to maintain ownership of knowledge in
     cyberspace, and the capitalist system, *at least as it applies to
     information exchange,* must adapt or die.  (I argue that this is a
     likely, or at least a possible, outcome, and also that it could be
     a good one.  Here again we assign opposite values to the same
     possible outcome.)

    I suppose it would be possible to assign this difference of opinion
    to a left - right "ideological" dichotomy, because I seem to
    support capitalism more reluctantly than you.

    But I don't think our differences are ideological, let alone
    "political."  What we have put our finger on in this
    exchange is the difference in how much we believe in the transforming
    power of communication technology versus the staying power of the
    present economic system.  My Utopian vision depends utterly on
    McLuhan, Ong and Heim being more right than wrong.  The entire
    scenario painted in my "Ownership" article is nothing more than the
    detailed working-out of their theories as applied to a particular
    aspect of knowledge.

    Actually, if the truth be known, I am not absolutely sure that they
    really are more right than wrong.  But I sure hope so.  I find the
    idea of communal knowledge in cyberspace to be truly exciting.`

    All the best,

About "Supplements":

_EJournal_ is experimenting with ways of revising, responding to, reworking, or
even retracting the texts we publish.  Authors who want to address a subject
already broached --by others or by themselves-- may send texts for us to
consider publishing as a Supplement issue.  Proposed supplements will not go
through as thorough an editorial review process as the essays they annotate.-

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About Letters:

_EJournal_ is willing publish letters to the editor.  But we make no
predictions about how many, which ones, or what format.  The "Letters" column
of a periodical is a habit of the paper environment, and  _EJournal_ readers
can send outraged objections to our essays directly to the authors.  Also, we
can publish substantial counterstatements as articles in their own right, or as
"Supplements."  Even so, when we get brief, thoughtful statements that appear
to be of interest to many subscribers they will appear as "Letters."
                                                                     [line 474]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About Reviews:

_EJournal_ is willing to publish reviews of almost anything that seems to fit
under our broad umbrella: the implications of electronic networks and texts.
We do not, however, solicit and thus cannot provide review copies of fiction,
prophecy, critiques, other texts, programs, hardware, lists or bulletin boards.
But if you would like to bring any publicly available information to our
readers' attention, send your review (any length) to us, or ask if writing one
sounds to us like a good idea.

About _EJournal_:

_EJournal_ is an all-electronic, Matrix distributed, peer-reviewed, academic
periodical.  We are particularly interested in theory and practice surrounding
the creation, transmission, storage, interpretation, alteration and replication
of electronic text.  We are also interested in the broader social,
psychological, literary, economic and pedagogical implications of computer-
mediated networks. The journal's essays are delivered free to Bitnet/ Internet/
Usenet addressees.  Recipients may make paper copies; _EJournal_ will provide
authenticated paper copy from our read-only archive for use by academic deans
or others.  Individual essays, reviews, stories-- texts --sent to us will be
disseminated to subscribers as soon as they have been through the editorial
process, which will also be "paperless."  We expect to offer access through
libraries to our electronic Contents and Abstracts, and to be indexed and
abstracted in appropriate places.

Writers who think their texts might be appreciated by _EJournal_'s audience are
invited to forward files to EJOURNAL@ALBANY.BITNET .  If you are wondering
about starting to write a piece for to us, feel free to ask if it sounds
appropriate.  There are no "styling" guidelines; we try to be a little more
direct and lively than many paper publications, and considerably less hasty and
ephemeral than most postings to unreviewed electronic spaces.  We read ASCII;
we look forward to experimenting with other transmission and display formats
and protocols.
