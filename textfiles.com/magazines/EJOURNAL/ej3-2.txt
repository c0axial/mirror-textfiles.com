            Leibniz, Baudrillard and Virtual Reality

  Early in the eighteenth century, Leibniz envisioned what might
  fairly be called the first reality engine.  Central to the argument
  of the _Theodicy_ (1710), is the claim that the mind of God
  comprehends an infinity of possible worlds, each of which exists *in
  potentia*.  Of these, only one was brought into being, because only
  one --the actual world in which we live-- fulfils the divine plan for
  creation.  For Leibniz, this world is the best of all possible
  worlds precisely because it is the only one which the Almighty chose
  to instantiate.  "God must needs have chosen the best," he writes,
  "since he does nothing without acting in accordance with supreme
  reason" (128).
                                                              [l. 67]
  The Theodicy concludes with a journey that anticipates both the
  nature of virtual reality technology and the epistemological
  problems arising from it.  Extrapolating on Laurentius Valla's
  _Dialogue on Free Will_, Leibniz tells of Theodorus' dream in which
  the goddess Pallas guides him through an infinitely large pyramid,
  each hall of which contains, "as in a stage presentation" (371), a
  fully realized possible future.  The pyramid is a series of tactile,
  three-dimensional, but wholly fictional environments through which
  Theodorus can physically move and experience the full spectrum of
  sensory stimuli --sight, sound, taste, smell and touch.  He can,
  moreover, control the degree of representational detail of each
  scene with a wave of his hand. Pointing to a book which appears like
  a pull-down menu in each room, Pallas explains,

         It is the history of this world which we are visiting .
         . . . Put your finger on any line you please . . . and
         you will see represented actually in all its detail that
         which the line broadly indicates. He obeyed, and . . .
         lo! another world, another Sextus [came into view].
         (371-72)

  The sense of depth, of fullness and representational plenitude, that
  Theodorus experiences in the worlds populating the great pyramid --
  and the ability to interact with those worlds-- are the goals of
  virtual reality technology, or VR.  Current attempts to realize
  these goals usually require the user to don a headset which
  completely encompasses the field of vision, and one or more other
  items of peripheral hardware such as a glove or a body harness.  These
  input devices are equipped with remote sensors which translate the
  body's movements into a stream of digital information.  Thus trussed
  up, the modern day Theodorus is connected to the "reality engine," 
  a high-speed graphics-oriented computer.  This sends to the headset
  a three-dimensional image of a virtual environment -- a classroom,
  for example, or the surface of the planet Venus.  When users,
  completely immersed in "cyberspace," turn their head, walk forward,
  or crouch down, the image moves accordingly.  The use of stereo
  sound effects and the ability to pick up or move objects within the
  virtual environment help reinforce a visceral sense of "being
  there."
                                                               [l. 107]
  The verisimilitude offered by current state-of-the-art VR technology
  is somewhat short of that depicted in the 1991 film _The Lawnmower
  Man_.  The advanced computer graphics which provide some of the
  film's special effects present alternately glorified and demonized
  images of virtual worlds which are simply beyond the current state
  of the technology.  Even the well-funded NASA/Ames project has only
  been able to produce a cartoon-like environment, one lacking the
  texture, detail and gradations of colour necessary to produce a
  truly convincing "reality."  But we should not underestimate the
  pace of developments in computing.  Not twenty years ago, computers
  filled entire rooms and could still perform only rudimentary tasks. 
  Today the same tasks could be performed by the microprocessor in a
  wrist watch.  Thus when Michael McGreevey of the NASA/Ames project
  says he will walk on a *virtual* Venus in the next two years, I
  suspect we should believe him.


  The possibility that we will be able to mould and shape our own
  private alternate worlds, that there will exist for each of us a
  means of realizing some personal Platonic ideal behind the mask of a
  stereoscopic LCD display, raises serious issues concerning the
  epistemological status of the real.  If the virtual can offer the
  complete range of sensory experiences available in the empirical
  world, and if, as some proponents claim, VR can even optimize those
  experiences such that the real comes to seem a pale shadow of the
  virtual, how will one still differentiate between the sign and the
  referent?  Is this the telos of a world in which, as Baudrillard
  claims, the real "is produced from miniaturised units, from
  matrices, memory banks and command models" (3), in which "the very
  definition of the real becomes: that of which it is possible to give
  an equivalent reproduction" (146)?
                                                                  [l. 139]
  The virtual gave Leibniz no cause for alarm.  On the contrary, the
  Theodicy posits the existence of "an infinitude of possible worlds"
  (128) not in order to volatize the model of a fixed and determinate
  uni-verse, but to reinforce it, to justify the ways of God to men. 
  This vision of a multi-verse, all contained in the halls of a giant
  reality engine, concludes with Theodorus' ascent to the very apex of
  the pyramid.  There, in the most beautiful of the rooms, he
  discovers the actual world and is overwhelmed by the experience:

         Theodorus, entering this highest hall, became
         entranced in ecstasy; he had to receive succour
         from the Goddess, a drop of divine liquid placed on
         his tongue; he was beside himself for joy.  We are
         in the real true world (said the Goddess) and you
         are at the source of happiness.  Behold what
         Jupiter makes ready for you, if you continue to
         serve him faithfully. (372)

  The existence of an infinite plurality of alternate schemes for
  creation only serves to renew Leibniz's faith in the one which God
  chose to instantiate.

  Early initiates to the mysteries of cyberspace report a similarly
  epiphanic response.  Howard Rheingold claims that many users of VR
  technology undergo what he calls a "conversion experience," a
  moment in which the sense of having moved into a wholly fictional
  reality grips the person with the certainty of a new found faith
  (14).  The ecstasy of the VR experience recalls the Greek root of
  the word, ekstasis, meaning to stand outside oneself, to feel your
  sense of self projected to a point outside that occupied by your
  body.  Where Theodorus' ecstasy essentially leads him back to
  himself, to the corporeal body that inhabits the actual world, VR
  tends toward an almost religious sense of transcendence.  The advent
  of the virtual announces the end of the body, the apocalypse of
  corporeal subjectivity.  According to Randal Walser and Eric
  Gullichsen, two of the field's major architects, 
                                                                   [l. 176] 
         In cyberspace, there is no need to move about in a                     
         body like the one you possess in physical reality. 
         You may feel more comfortable, at first, with a
         body like your "own" but as you conduct more of
         your life and affairs in cyberspace your
         conditioned notion of a unique and immutable body
         will give way to a far more liberated notion of
         "body" as something quite disposable . . . . You
         will find that some bodies work best in some             
         situations while others work best in others.  The
         ability to radically and compellingly change one's
         body-image is bound to have a deep psychological
         effect, calling into question just what you
         consider yourself to be.  (quoted in Rheingold,
         191)

  In the ecstatic realm of the virtual, all things become pliable,
  changeable, improvable.  We could, for example realize Prufrock's
  dream of living as  "a pair of ragged claws / Scuttling across the
  floors of silent seas" ("The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
  73-74), or experience the sense of incorporeality, of having no body
  at all.  VR shares none of Leibniz's faith in the supreme wisdom of
  God's creation, but rather looks to abandon it, to step outside the
  body in search of as yet unthought combinations, relations, and
  forms.

  The virtual then perhaps offers a way out of the cultural and
  epistemological dead-end of Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality. 
  The real ceases to be real for Baudrillard when it comes to resemble
  itself, when the difference between the sign and its referent is
  obliterated and the subtle charm of the trompe-l'oeil gives way to
  the endlessly repeatable perfection of the digital code.  The
  hyperreal is the condition in which art, as Andy Warhol recognized,
  is everywhere, and everything, from Campbell's Soup cans to
  reproductions of photos of Marilyn Monroe, is art.  The real,
  Baudrillard claims, "has been confused with its image.  Reality no
  longer has the time to take on the appearance of reality"
  (_Simulations_, 152).
                                                                 [l. 215]
  The crisis of representation derives precisely from this
  catastrophic collapse of difference; when the sign and the referent
  are drawn together in an "implosive madness" (_Simulations_, 147),
  the space that is representation disappears.  But it is in this
  space which is no-space, a virtual space, that the virtual is born. 
  For some critics, such as Benjamin Wooley, VR is associated with,
  even seen as the apotheosis of, Baudrillard's concept of the
  hyperreal, and in one sense this is justified; VR strives to
  simulate not only the look of the real, but also its feel.  For all
  that it leaves the body ecstatically behind, VR valorizes, even
  fetishizes, the five senses in order to produce its visceral sense
  of verisimilitude.  In so doing, VR looks forward to a time when its
  simulated worlds will seem more real than the real, when the latter
  will come to have the uncanny sense of appearing similar to the
  virtual.

  The strain of VR technology which tends most dramatically toward the
  dead end of the hyperreal is, not coincidently, the one fostered by
  the American military.  The "Super Cockpit" program of the U.S. Air
  Force, slated for completion in 1996, arose from the recognition
  that the technological sophistication of the next generation of
  fighter planes would outstrip the ability of human pilots to monitor
  effectively all of the two hundred various gauges, meters and
  electronic read outs crammed into their cockpits.  Placing the
  operator in a virtual environment, however, removes the ergonomic
  obstacles to delivering death at mach three --even as the pilot
  himself disappears behind his headmounted display screen.  The
  ecstasy of virtual combat, the unlimited freedom that results from
  the increasingly mediated nature of technological warfare, is
  hungrily anticipated in an article from _Air & Space_ magazine:

         When he climbed into his F-16C, the young fighter
         jock of 1998 simply plugged in his helmet and
         flipped down his visor to activate his Super
         Cockpit system.  The virtual world he saw exactly
         mimicked the world outside.  Salient terrain
         features were outlined and rendered in three
         dimensions . . . . Once he was airborne, solid
         cloud cover obscured everything outside the canopy. 
         But inside the helmet, the pilot "saw" the horizon
         and terrain clearly, as if it were clear day.  His
         compass heading was displayed as a large band of
         numbers on the horizon line, his projected flight
         path a shimmering highway leading out toward
         infinity. (Thompson, 75-76) 
                                                               [l. 261] 
  The Super Cockpit program differs significantly from simple flight
  simulators.  In the *hyperreal* Super Cockpit, the work performed in
  the virtual space is also work done in the real world; when the
  "young fighter jock" downs a "bandit" by pushing "a phantom button
  on a virtual display screen," then it is not a virtual person but a
  real person who dies in the bright light of a real air-to-air
  missile.

  The thanatotic impulse of the military's VR programs, I would argue,
  draws out the distinctly masculinist will-to-power inherent in the
  attempt to re-make the world, to finally take on the divine powers
  of creation.  The hyperreal can perhaps be seen as the swan song of
  the historical project known as "man": a desperate bid for
  transcendence in the dying days of male hegemony in which the
  masculine subject imagines himself disappearing down a "shimmering
  highway" paved with microchips.
                                                                            
  Paradoxically, however, it is at the point where the virtual most
  completely approximates the physical world, when VR seems to
  collapse the distinction between the sign and the referent, that it
  illuminates difference.  At the asymptotic limit of representation,
  VR breaks free of the gravitational pull of the actual and opens a
  new space for the imagination.  The difference:  Where the
  *hyperreal* is constituted by the play of surfaces, by a paralytic
  fascination with exteriority, the *virtual* offers images with
  depth, images which one can enter, explore, and, perhaps most
  importantly, with which one can interact.  The virtual is thoroughly
  interior.  Unlike cinema, for example, or the photograph, the
  virtual takes you inside spaces, lets you be surrounded.  But its
  depth is not that of the absolute ground which guaranteed the
  sovereignty of the real; VR's depth is self-reflexively fictional,
  tentative, open to change and adaptation.
                                                                     [l. 294]
  For Jaron Lanier, a software designer widely considered the "guru"
  of VR, the virtual constitutes a "post-symbolic" order.  The empire
  of the sign collapses when one no longer requires words, numbers,
  keyboards, and screens.  Extrapolating from his early efforts to
  create a computer language that replaced alpha-numeric strings with
  pictograms, Lanier sees the virtual as a means by which people can
  regain a kind of immediate relation to their work.  "Information is
  alienated experience," Lanier claims, but when people are no longer
  divided from their tasks by a screen, and can, in effect, enter into
  the realm where the work is performed, alienation gives way to
  visceral experience.  "When you make a program and send it to
  somebody else," Lanier told an interviewer in 1985, "especially if
  that program is an interactive simulation, it as if you are making a
  new world, a fusion of the symbolic and natural elements.  Instead
  of communicating symbols like letters, numbers and pictures . . . you
  are creating miniature universes that have their own internal
  mysteries to be discovered" (quoted in Rheingold, 159).

  The interactive nature of VR is at the heart of Lanier's vision of
  post-symbolic communication.  Tele-presence, the ability to project
  a virtual body and sense of self to any location connected to a
  telephone line, allows people separated by even the greatest of
  distances to meet and collaborate in a virtual space.  Moreover,
  because cyberspace is eminently malleable, the meeting place itself
  may become the means by which we communicate with one another. 
  Lanier's company, VPL Research, for example, recently conducted a
  demonstration called "Day Care World."  Two architects, one in
  Houston, and the other in San Francisco, donned cyberspace suits,
  sensor-fitted leotards which turn the entire body into a remote
  input device.  The architects telecommuted to VPL's headquarters in
  Redwood City, California, where they met inside a computer to design
  a daycare centre with virtual imaging tools.  Upon completion, they
  were able to "reduce" their simulated size to that of a child in
  order to better understand the problems the building's future
  occupants might have with their design.
                                                                   [l. 330]
  VR returns representation to the body at the very moment that it
  frees us from it.  In the realm of the virtual, one communicates
  again with the inflections of voice, the subtleties of facial
  expressions and the dramatics of hand gestures.  In offering us
  alternative bodies, it offers us alternative body languages.

  The utopian impulses which atrophied in the age of the hyperreal, in
  the age of our mute transfixion before the sign, are revived in the
  age of the virtual.  The literature of its enthusiasts beckons us to
  a land of digital milk and honey:

         Only a tradition bound to the precious object as
         commodity would find problematic the replacement of
         'reality' by a 'simulacra of simulations' . . .
         Moralistic critics of the simulacrum accuse us of
         living in a dream world.  We respond with Montaigne
         that to abandon life for a dream is to price it
         exactly at its worth.  And anyway, when life is a
         dream there's no need for sleeping. (Youngblood,
         15-16)

  Others, noting VR's relation to the military apparatus and its
  potential as a kind of electronic opiate for the masses, are less
  enthusiastic.  Kevin Robins, for example, argues this "cynical
  substitution of simulation for reality can only superficially
  overcome the alienation of our social existence; our pain will
  return to haunt us as nightmares the more we seek refuge in the
  'dream' of virtual reality" (114).
                                                                [l. 359]
  The portentous fears of critics like Robins, or films like
  _The Lawnmower Man_ (in which VR is responsible for transforming an
  innocent simpleton into a Nietzschean *Ubermensch* with homicidal
  tendencies --and a Christ complex to boot) are expressions of a kind
  of panic, a panic arising from loss of the comforting assurance of
  the real, from the desire to return to the certainties of the
  symbolic.  What these fears overlook, or attempt to repress, is the
  simple fact that it is too late to go back to some putative "real
  true world"; we already live, and perhaps have always lived, in the
  virtual.  When computer graphics programmer Alvy Ray Smith proclaims
  that "reality is 80 million polygons per second" (quoted in
  Rheingold, 168), he is making more than a statement about the amount
  of pictorial information required to simulate the look and feel of a
  physical object.  He is telling us something we have always secretly
  suspected: that reality is an effect, a historically, socially, even
  technologically determined means of regulating and representing
  experience.

  Virtual reality technology is already being used to help
  bio-chemists at the University of North Carolina discover new
  molecular combinations.  American surgeons can practice on virtual
  cadavers.  Japanese consumers can choose their kitchen cabinets in a
  virtual mock-up of their own homes.  This past summer, "Virtuality"
  arcade games have shown up in shopping malls, dance clubs and
  exhibitions across North America.  For fifty dollars, you can pit
  your wits against a gun-slinging cyborg.  And the French consortium
  which now owns Lanier's company, VPL Research, has already announced
  the opening of the first virtual reality theatres.

  The virtual is here.  The issue now is whether we allow it to remain
  the province of the techno-military apparatus and the vertically
  integrated entertainment corporations, or whether, like the personal
  computer, it can be appropriated to the task of dismantling the
  structures of "Truth" which would pin us to some "Authorised King
  James Version" of The Real.  Leibniz was right: the actual world is
  but one room in the unnumbered halls of the multi-verse.  And from
  this crucial insight we must find our own way to the apex, to the
  uppermost hall of the pyramid.  There we shall knock on the door and
  wait to see who answers.

  THE DECEMBER, 1992, SURVEY OF _EJOURNAL_ SUBSCRIBERS            [l. 439]

  Last December's survey produced nothing startling.  On the other
  hand, it gives us a few hints about ourselves.  Thanks to Peter
  Gorny and his cohorts at Oldenburg who tabulated the 127 responses,
  we can share what we think we have found out. 

  It looks as if about 85% of our readers are affiliated with
  not-for-profit organizations.  Over half of that 85% say they are at
  universities (spread quite evenly among specialities) or otherwise
  involved in education.  Of the other half, the clusters are in
  libraries (15% of *all* readers), in government, and in research,
  international or charitable organizations. 

  Of the 15% or so of the total who report working with for-profit
  organizations, half classify their affiliation as computing related;
  the rest are spread out among publishing, engineering,
  manufacturing, research and information-management ventures.           

  Of all 127 respondents, one third receive _EJournal_ by way of Unix
  machines, 22% through Vax and 13% via IBM equipment.   

  About "platforms" for reading: 36% use Macintosh, 35% DOS, 18% Sun,
  18% "other," 10% dumb terminal and 3% NeXT (there were multiple
  answers). 

  Less than half of the group print the journal for saving or sharing,
  but 86 people reported filing it electronically (at least
  occasionally) for future reference.  Of 43 who say they forward
  _EJournal_ to others, four have sent it to entire lists. Twenty
  seven people report having retrieved back issues from our Fileserv;
  they appear to account for a small proportion of the more than 1500
  "hits" on the Fileserv in 1992.

  About 100 respondents offered some 300 answers to the question about
  what they hoped the journal would contain.  Here are the top 163: 

	  ownership and copyright- 28  
	  hypertext - 23 
	  matrix/ network/ cyberspace - 23 
	  education and pedagogy - 20 
	  electronic fiction and poetry - 19 
	  virtual reality - 18 
	  text and display - 17 
	  costs/ benefits of networking - 15 

  Three respondents said, incidentally, that they would like less in
  the way of self-regarding or self-centered material, including
  (presumably) questionnaires like this.
		
  EDITORIAL COMMENT                                               [l. 489]

  The Survey information about readers, meager and unsophisticated as
  it is, leads toward three generalizations.  _EJournal_ doesn't serve
  any conventional academic discipline; our readers probably don't all
  have late-model, high-end equipment; the equipment each of you uses
  is probably not quite the same as any other reader's. 

  The list of hoped-for subjects isn't surprising --perhaps because
  most are from the list of choices we offered.  On the other hand,
  the 137 volunteered suggestions did not cluster in a discernible
  pattern, nor did we spot anything startlingly novel among them.

  The inferences we draw aren't startling, either.  Most important: 
  Our subscribers want to read essays related to any of the areas on
  the list.  

  Also significant:  It looks as if we should keep on delivering the
  full text of every issue of _EJournal_ --electronic mail
  messages of under 1000 lines in plain-vanilla ASCII-- to all
  subscribers.

  At the same time, anticipating the eventual homogenization of
  digital delivery and display systems, we will try to explore ways of
  "envisioning information" (thanks, E. R. Tufte) that paper-bound
  publishing won't accomodate.

About "Supplements":                                                 

_EJournal_ is experimenting with ways of revising, responding to, reworking, or
even retracting the texts we publish.  Authors who want to address a subject
already broached --by others or by themselves-- may send texts for us to
consider publishing as a Supplement issue.  Proposed supplements will not go
through as thorough an editorial review process as the essays they annotate.

About _EJournal_:

_EJournal_ is an all-electronic, e-mail delivered, peer-reviewed, academic
periodical.  We are particularly interested in theory and practice surrounding
the creation, transmission, storage, interpretation, alteration and replication
of electronic text.  We are also interested in the broader social,
psychological, literary, economic and pedagogical implications of computer-
mediated networks. The journal's essays are delivered free to Bitnet/Internet/
Usenet addressees.  Recipients may make paper copies; _EJournal_ will provide
authenticated paper copy from our read-only archive for use by academic deans
or others.  

Writers who think their texts might be appreciated by _EJournal_'s audience are
invited to forward files to EJOURNAL@ALBANY.bitnet .  If you are wondering 
about starting to write a piece for to us, feel free to ask if it sounds 
appropriate.  There are no "styling" guidelines; we try to be a little more
direct and lively than many paper publications, and considerably less hasty and
ephemeral than most postings to unreviewed electronic spaces.  Essays in the
vicinity of 5000 words fit our format well.  We read ASCII; we look forward to
experimenting with other transmission and display formats and protocols. 
                                                                       [l. 561]
