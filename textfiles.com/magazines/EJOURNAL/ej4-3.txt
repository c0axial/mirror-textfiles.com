EDITOR'S NOTE -                                                 [line 49 ]

  This issue is made up of "conversations" with Norman Holland about
  his essay "Eliza Meets the Postmodern" in V4N1 (April, 1994) of
  _EJournal_.

  Two readers sent essays directly to us, more or less as extended
  letters-to-the-editor.  After many iterations of reply- retort-
  response, we all agreed to publish one of the sets of exchanges, the
  one begun by Doug Brent.

  Four readers sent e-mail directly to Professor Holland.  He and
  three of them graciously agreed to let _EJournal_ present their
  correspondence almost verbatim, trying to capture the spontaneity of
  their exchanges.  After much correspondence, we have chosen the
  Harpold and Sikillian exchanges with Norm Holland to make up the
  rest of this issue.  Professor Holland has suggested the sequence of
  presentation.

  The spontaneity we sought has been dampened by delays.  It took us
  longer than it should have to establish and follow the procedures we
  felt obliged to set up.  Through it all, everyone has been
  remarkably patient.  We are especially grateful to Professor
  Holland, the person with an intellectual investment in every snippet
  of text that follows, for his patience as well as for his promptness
  in responding to every communication.

  In spite of the lag, we think the exchanges were well worth
  recording, and the procedure appears to warrant repeating.  As we
  creep toward html markup and access to _EJournal_ via WWW, we will
  try to expand this issue's interspersed linearity in the direction
  of convenient cross referencing.  [Jennifer Wyman has prepared html
  versions of several issues, and she is working on an experimental
  home page.]

  DOUG BRENT TO _EJOURNAL_ - 14 April 1994                  [line 118]

  I find Norman Holland's essay, "Eliza Meets the Postmodern,"
  immensely interesting for a large number of reasons, but I am
  particularly pleased to see an author with Holland's experience in
  literary criticism call into question some facile assumptions about
  the "postmodern" character of hypertext.

  I think that he has put his finger on a key point.  Those who make
  vast claims for the power of certain kinds of text to "do" certain
  things must be constantly on guard against the temptation to
  attribute to the text activities that are actually acts of reading.
  Constructivist views of reading have been around for so long now
  that they shouldn't have to be restated, but somehow or other they
  keep getting forgotten (even sometimes by reader-response critics
  who should know better, as for instance Iser who keeps talking about
  the "repertoire" of the text when he really means the repertoire of
  the reader).

  I am not sure that I agree with Holland's definition of a
  postmodernist text as one that actually does things on its own as
  opposed to offering choices to the reader.  This seems a highly
  selective account of postmodernism.  But the word "postmodernism"
  has attracted to itself such a plethora of competing and ambiguous
  definitions that the term is almost not worth using; certainly it's
  not worth spending a lot of time arguing about.  Whether or not the
  distinction can be labelled "modern" versus "postmodern," I think
  that Holland does us all a service by distinguishing between forms
  of "text" which, hyper or not, require the reader to do all of the
  work in constructing their meaning, and forms of artifical
  intelligence that really do participate in their own construction.

  I would, however, like to take issue with Holland's argument that
  hypertext is unlikely to alter radically the experience of reading
  simply because it does not do anything that cannot be done by
  conventional means. In one sense he is quite right.  A book with
  copious footnotes and cross-references is a primitive form of
  hypertext.  A reader sitting in a library moving from source to
  source can be seen as constructing another primitive form of
  hypertext, in this case (as Holland cogently argues) under even more
  direct control of the reader.  But I disagree with Holland when he
  discounts the extent to which the ease of doing something changes
  the nature of the experience.                             [line 160]

  Take, for instance, the difference between manuscript and
  typographic culture.  In one sense the printing press does little
  that a manuscript copyist cannot do; it just does it faster, more
  economically, and on a greater scale.  But scholars from Eisenstein
  to Ong have argued persuasively that the printing press created a
  profound revolution in Western culture --in effect, created
  modernism-- simply because those differences of scale are so very
  great.  The printing press created the illusion of the autonomous
  text, the phenomenon of copyright and the ownership of knowledge,
  the critical mass of ideas that resulted in the Renaissance.  By
  virtue of its ability to create exactly repeatable copies, it
  enabled indexing --useless when every copy had different
  pagination-- which in turn allowed knowledge to be retrieved on a
  scale unimaginable in a manuscript culture.  It created what McLuhan
  calls a "break boundary": a point at which a phenomenon acquires a
  scale that causes it to turn into, not a pumped-up version of same
  thing, but another kind of thing altogether.

  This is the claim that is applied to hypertext.  Those who make it
  are not talking about simple hypertext documents confined to a
  single disk or CD-ROM, with multiple but highly finite pathways from
  one unit of information to another.  They are talking about the
  rapidly-growing webs of information such as those appearing on
  World-Wide Web, in which the links between pieces of information are
  potentially infinite.  This technology is now in a stage of craft
  literacy, more difficult for the average person to access than the
  hieroglyphic script that kept literacy from becoming a major
  influence on society for many centuries.  As this form of text
  becomes as ubiquitous as the book, it will not simply make
  cross-referencing "easier."  It will make it so much easier that it
  will become a different activity altogether.  Text will cross
  another break boundary.  Potential effects include the destruction
  of the concept of authorship, associational rather than linear
  indexing, the breakdown of disciplinarity -- well, I needn't go on.
  Read any hypertext futurist such as Jay Bolter for the complete
  list.                                                     [line 197]

  Whether we use the label "postmodern" to describe this phenomenon is
  a very good question.  Certainly, as Holland argues, our slack-jawed
  wonder at the phenomenon should not tempt us to attribute a life of
  its own to what is after all just text, however complex its
  interconnections.  And as always, we will have to wait fifty years
  or so before we can look back on this technological revolution and
  decide whether all or any of the claims made for it are justified.
  (This is an occupational hazard of futurism.)  But I would be
  willing to bet that a fundamental change in the way we interact with
  text, a change brought about by a massive increase in the scale of a
  communications medium, will have far more dramatic effects than
  simply making it easier to do what we have always done.

  NORMAN HOLLAND TO DOUG BRENT -                              [line 220]

  I am grateful for Professor Brent's graceful and intelligent
  response to my essay.  I think he makes a point well worth making.
  Not only that, he phrases the distinction I was drawing more
  elegantly than I did: "between forms of `text' which . . . require
  the reader to do all the work in constructing their meaning, and
  forms of artificial intelligence that really do participate in their
  own construction."  Yes, precisely.

  I am not sure, however, that I intended to say (in Professor Brent's
  phrasing) that "hypertext is unlikely to alter radically the
  experience of reading."  Undoubtedly, when I read a hypertext
  fiction like Michael Joyce's _Afternoon_, I have a very different
  experience from reading the Margaret Atwood paperback currently by
  my bed.  It's just that the differences don't seem to me to cross
  any boundary between modern and postmodern.

  Professor Brent goes on to point to the ways printed books altered
  manuscript culture and to suggest that hypertext will have a like
  effect on print culture.  I think the point is well taken and most
  intelligently deployed.  Unquestionably, by virtue of hypertext's
  cross-referencing, we will become able --we have already become
  able-- to read even traditional texts in drastically new ways.
  Readers' experiences, interactions, and responses are all different.
  Some of those differences we can already see.  Many we are
  unconscious of.
                                                            [line 246]
  While mulling over Professor Brent's's response, there came across
  my screen another highly intelligent writing.  This was "Why Are
  Electronic Publications Difficult to Classify?" by Professor
  Jean-Claude Guedon of the University of Montreal.  Electronic
  publishing (this journal, for example, or the LISTs on the Internet)
  is changing print culture as deeply as print culture changed the
  functions of handwriting.  Notably, e-publishing replaces the
  one-way diffusion of print culture with feedback and dialogue. Thus,
  publishing moves from the fixed book toward the "permanent seminar,"
  toward process rather than product.  At the same time, the
  retrievals possible in something like NEXIS correspond to the
  indexing and cross-referencing of a hypertext CD-ROM.  In general,
  the Internet makes hypertext possible across a global scale.
  Professor Guedon's point parallels Professor Brent's.  Both
  hypertext and the networks are profoundly changing print culture.

  Should these changes be seen as marking a breakpoint between
  modernism and postmodernism?  I say not.  That was the point of my
  original article.  I recognize, however, the wisdom of Professor
  Brent's last paragraph.  Only time will really settle the question.
  In the meantime, Professor Brent has elegantly clarified the matter.

  MICHAEL SIKILLIAN TO NORMAN HOLLAND - 27 May 1994            [line 276]

  Professor Holland,

  I'd just like to say "bravo" for a long overdue article.  As a
  multmedia developer, I have followed with some interest (and
  amusement) the academic ideas of what exactly multimedia is.
  Especially the idea that it is some vindication of postmodernism or
  deconstruction as literary theories.  More interesting work has been
  done by Walter Ong (a bit dated, but still valid) in _Orality and
  Literacy_, and by Richard Lanham in _The Electronic Word_.  Lanham
  makes connections to Quintilian and classical rhetoric.  Also Brenda
  Laurel has some interesting links to Aristotelian rhetoric and
  dramatic theory in her book _Computers as Theatre_.

  I have found that my education as a classicist is ironically more
  relevant than some of the more technological approaches to new
  media.  I am doing some work now on texts in interactive media,
  specifically with translation.  Different types of translations
  --literal, "modern", free-- can all be related together in an
  interactive program, much as cubism did with perspective.

  One of the things that Delaney, Barrett _et al_ point out is that
  hypertexts are not linear; that they are diffuse.  You correctly
  point out that the average reader --skimming a text, leafing through
  pages, using commentaries-- does the same thing.  I think that the
  "linear" nature of a traditional text is overstated.  Also, another
  thing you hint at --hypertexts can be used to *concentrate* a
  reader's experience in a text to a much greater degree than a
  traditional text can.  The goal of interface design is to understand
  and guide a reader's experience in a concrete direction.  Any
  software package which tells the reader "there are no limits; we
  cannot presume to know what you want to do" will fail or be unused.
  That is why usability testing is so important.  And that is also
  what a good print author does.  Multimedia and hypertexts are
  powerful tools; but they are not necessarily the repudiation of the
  entire textual/ critical tradition; rather they can make it much more
  efficient.

  Congratulations again on a fine article.

  I read Michael Sikillian as making the same point as Professor
  Brent, namely, that the *experience* of hypertext will be different.
  I find particularly apposite his remark that hypertext with no aim
  at all will simply not be used.  In effect, hypertext can limit a
  reader to certain connections (while codex can not), *and if
  hypertext does not,* it will fail.  A most interesting observation
  from what is obviously a highly relevant range of experience.

  TERRY HARPOLD TO NORMAN HOLLAND - 22 May 1994                [line 340]

  Norm,

  I've just read with pleasure your "Eliza meets the Postmodern" piece
  in the recent _EJournal_.

  I believe that I disagree with you somewhat in the emphasis of your
  model of the postmodern --I think that textual/ readerly agency is
  the right question, but I would prefer to consider agency with
  regard to a dialectic of authority and agency along Lacanian lines:
  the contingency of the narrative form imposes the reader's
  confrontation with elementary lack in language (in a parallel
  formulation, the desire of the Other, as site of language).

  But I think that you've made a very valuable contribution here: that
  which is most commonly cited by most proponents of the `hypertext
  validates/ tests postmodernism' notion --the emphasis on
  multiplicity, unlimited connection and diversion-- is, in my mind,
  founded on a decidedly *modernist* understanding of texts as highly
  complex, profoundly connectionist, but ultimately saturated or
  closed fields.  In my own work, I emphasize the moments of rupture,
  disconnection, misfortune [%dystuche%] or *failure* in these
  narratives.

  The Eliza or OZ paradigms are useful as antidotes to the
  cartographically-modelled connectionist paradigms of digital text
  because they introduce elements of inconsistency and a kind of raw
  contingency that confronts the human participant with the
  irreducibility of the Real to the Symbolic.  These programs don't
  fully succeed in this --they are too limited in their current forms
  --but they point the way to a model of textual agency that clearly
  exceeds the modernist forms.

  Thanks for the piece.  I found it very suggestive.

  NORMAN HOLLAND TO TERRY HARPOLD -                          [line 383]

  Thanks for your kind words about "Eliza," Terry.  Yes, I think the
  emphasis on multiplicity, etc., is "modernist," a focus on the text
  as thing-in-itself that our postmodern theory and our post-1960s
  psychological knowledge of perception belies.

  With respect to agency, however, you, like most literary folk,
  believe that texts have agency or, to put it more simply, can do
  things, in particular, can impose themselves on our minds.  There is
  no psychological evidence for this, and I have to be adamant about
  that.

  TERRY HARPOLD TO NORMAN HOLLAND - 26 October 1994          [line 403]

  Norm,

  Your rejection of the pomo enthusiasm for text-centered agency is
  well-known, and I won't waste your time trying to disabuse you of
  the prejudice ;-)

  But I do think that the locus of agency in digital texts is more
  complex than we have been accustomed to thinking for printed texts
  --*because the former are in the digital mode*.  This aspect of
  reading these texts deserves a closer look for that reason.

  Digital texts are read within mimetic structures (the "interface")
  that locate them inside the boundaries of human interaction --that
  is, as objects that appear to be seen *lucidly* and *consistently*
  through the aperture of software and hardware.  The interface in this
  way depicts a kind of super-narrative: it tells a story, if you
  will, of user control and user-centered agency, in which the reading
  of the digital text is framed.

  But digital media are subject to failures that lie outside of the
  user's control or purview, and these may fracture the nested
  boundaries of the narratives that the interface defines, as well as
  the fiction of user agency that these boundaries promote.

  A printed text is not likely to collapse catastrophically as you read
  it, becoming irreversibly illegible.  This is not an uncommon event
  in the digital modes, and therein lies a crucial difference.

  This is what I meant by my emphasis in my original message on
  misfortune [%dystuche%] in digital media.  When the embedding
  narrative of interface ("there is a story to tell: here it is; you
  may read it...") collapses, when the connections break down, when
  the text becomes unreadable ("there is <nothing> to tell"), where is
  agency situated?

  I think that the question is open, and that's where things get
  interesting.

  HOLLAND TO HARPOLD                                       [line 450]

  Terry, I see what you mean, but I still don't buy into the idea that
  a text, even a digital text, is active.  How is the tendency of
  digital texts to crash any different from the alas, all-too-real
  likelihood that our books on acidic paper will collapse into dust
  when we pull them from the library shelves?  If agency that be, it
  is an agency any inert matter has.  I think there is a better way of
  thinking about such things, namely, keeping our focus firmly on what
  the reader is doing and thinking.  If the reader thinks the
  interface guarantees "user control," that's the reader's
  construction.  If the reader thinks, as I do, that my connection to
  you through the Internet is precarious and complex, that too is the
  reader's construction.

  HOLLAND INTERMEZZO, INTERJECTION, OR INTERVENTION -       [line 472]

  Reading over Doug Brent's, Michael Sikillian's, and Terry
  Harpold's responses, it seems to me that the colloquy has opened up
  an issue latent in the essay and perhaps unresolved there.  That is,
  even if we grant that a new technology like hypermedia does not in
  and of itself *do* anything, don't we need to say that it does open
  up, invite, facilitate certain kinds of responses or experiences
  more than others?  If so and if those responses are "postmodern,"
  then isn't the text itself in some sense postmodern?  In other
  words, is "postmodernism" in texts or in readers?  In a second
  response, Professor Brent makes this issue very clear.

  ====================================================================

  FROM DOUG BRENT TO NORMAN HOLLAND (via _EJournal_) - 10 September
       1994                                                 [line 488]

  It's hard to disagree with anyone who finds your remarks elegant and
  wise, and I heartily thank Professor Holland for brightening up what
  is otherwise a hideous beginning of term.  (I mean no sarcasm
  here--it really is nice to engage in a civil exchange of ideas.  In
  many respects, our ideas are not all that far apart, and this makes
  civil exchange easy.)

  But I think there's a little more at stake here than whether
  hypertext is "modern" or "postmodern."  I was really going after
  Professor Holland's suggestion that hypertext is not much different
  from other kinds of text, in which I offer the following as
  evidence:

     In general, hypermedia simply do electronically what a
     reader or researcher might do "by hand" in a library.  That
     is, one could interrupt one's listening to Beethoven's Ninth
     in a music library to consult a score, a biography, or
     criticism.  In a way, hypermedia are simply a variorum or a
     Norton Critical Edition done electronically.  They are by no
     means as radical a departure from familiar forms as claimed.

  Holland is quite right that the issue is not what a medium *does*,
  in the sense that no medium actually *does* anything at all --it
  makes *us* do something.  But paragraphs such as the above seem to
  me to radically understate the potential of a medium to make us do
  something different.

  This is the case I've already made, and I won't remake it. Rather
  I'll take another look at the "modern/ postmodern" distinction that
  was really Holland's point before he accidentally pushed my
  transformative technology button.

  Perhaps the confusion arises from an unclear notion --unclear in
  much postmodernist theory, not just Holland's piece-- about what it
  means for a text to "be" postmodern.  Holland is saying, I think,
  that unless we begin to talk about artificially intelligent "texts,"
  a text can't really "be" modern, postmodern or anything else.  It
  just sits there being what it is, a bunch of marks on a page waiting
  for us to do something to or for or about it.  Postmodernism is a
  name for an interpretive act, not a type of text.
                                                             [line 530]
  But interpretive theories tend to leak back into artistic practice.
  Many texts in the postmodern era are written in ways that invite
  postmodern readings --and yes, I think that certain texts invite
  certain types of readings more than others, and that this is
  sometimes deliberate on the part of the author.

  This is the sense, I think, in which hypermedia "are" postmodern.
  Of course they just sit there doing nothing until the reader
  activates them.  But when activated, they make it vastly easier for
  a reader to do postmodern sorts of things with them --to inscribe her
  own meanings in the text literally, not just figuratively, to engage
  in recursive and associational reading patterns, and --perhaps most
  important-- to wallow in instability and uncertainty.  Linear
  hardcopy text looks stable, even if it isn't.  Hypertext jams its
  instability up against our bifocals and shouts it in our ears.

  This is what I meant when I said that the effect of a medium depends
  not on what it makes *possible* but on what it makes *easy.*
  Hypertext is "postmodern," not in the sense that it does something
  new, but in the sense that it makes postmodern "reading" so easy
  that it is virtually inevitable, and "modern" reading so difficult
  that it is virtually impossible.

  I think the discussion would be helped if we clarifed three terms
  hovering at the edges.  "Constructivism," "deconstruction" and
  "postmodernism" need to be disambiguated.                 [line 556]

  I am no expert in postmodernism, but I read it as a much larger set
  of attitudes than "deconstruction."  "Deconstruction," I think, is
  an activity of a critic, a conscious showing-up of a text performed
  by a reader anxious to show that it has no stable meaning.

  Postmodernism is a much larger constellation of ideas, in which
  deconstruction finds its place, but which is concerned with larger
  issues of indeterminacy and interaction between text and reader and
  between text and other text rather than between text and world.

  "Constructivism" is a term of cognitive science, not a literary
  term, but it connects with this discussion in that it, too, suggests
  that "meaning" is not in the text but in the reader.  Where
  constructivism really parts company with deconstruction is that
  constructivism is concerned with how meaning, unstable or not, is
  nonetheless built up by people bringing their own schemata to bear
  on the stimulus of a text.  Deconstruction seems determined to leave
  the reader coughing in the dust, left behind by a text doing its own
  thing.

  I think my bias is clear, and I agree with Holland that the notion
  of a text doing its own thing seems fundamentally incompatible with
  what we know about how people make and more or less share meanings.
  I never thought I'd find myself, a confirmed anti-psychoanalytic,
  agreeing with Norm Holland, but the persistent misunderstandings of
  reader-response psychology make strange bedfellows.

  NORMAN HOLLAND'S RESPONSE TO ALL OF THE ABOVE -            [line 592]

  Here again, I find myself in nearly total agreement with Professor
  Brent.  His definition of postmodern ("concerned with larger issues
  of indeterminacy and interaction between text and reader and between
  text and other text rather than between text and world") is not
  mine, but broader.  Mine was: "In postmodern art, artists use as a
  major part of their material *our* ideas about what they are working
  with."

  There is no arguing with definitions, however.  The question is
  simply, Which works better?, and only time will tell that.

  Professor Brent's more discussable point is that there is a sense in
  which it is reasonable to call hypertext postmodern in that it
  causes postmodern activities on its reader's part.  Thus, although
  he comes from a reader-active, reader-response position, I would
  have to say some of his phrasings are unpsychological: "the
  potential of a medium to make us do something different"; "Certain
  texts invite certain types of readings"; or "Hypertext jams its
  instability up against our bifocals."  These seem to me to relapse
  into saying texts *do* things, and, as we both agree, that runs
  counter to what we know of the psychology of reading.

  I'd rephrase: "the potential of a medium to reward our doing
  something different." "Certain types of readings succeed with
  certain texts, other types of readings don't."  "When we read
  hypertext, we feel instability quivering in our bifocals."  In every
  such case I'd rephrase so as always to keep the reader's activity as
  the energizing force.

  But these are minor quibbles.  In other phrasings, Professor Brent
  seems to me to have it exactly and elegantly right: "Postmodernism
  is a name for an interpretive act, not a type of text."  "When
  activated, [hypermedia] make it vastly easier for a reader to do
  postmodern sorts of things with them."
                                                           [line 628]
  Professor Brent suggests that when readers enjoy these postmodern
  strategies of interpretion, as understood by critics, that
  encourages artists to create works that will yield to them.  True
  enough, and this is very clearly happening in all the arts at the
  moment.

  Looking backward, however, I would say that visual artists led the
  way.  In that sense visual artists "invented" postmodernism in my
  sense, either preceding the critics or developing independently.
  Literary deconstruction came later from an essentially philosophical
  base.  That is, I see Action Painting and Op Art as transitional
  toward postmodernism, and Rosenquist, Warhol, and Lichtenstein doing
  definitively postmodern work by the early 1960s.  Derrida becomes
  recognized in 1966-67. Probably the visual artists never heard of
  him, and he certainly does not mention them.  I am sure, though,
  there are other ways of reading the intellectual history of that
  fascinating period.

  In this context, I think there can be little disagreement with
  Professor Brent's point that the existence of this or that method of
  interpretation leads artists to create things that can be
  interpreted that way.  That was very obviously true in the period of
  New Criticism and we see it now in a variety of fields besides
  literature.
                                                            [line 653]
  But what about Professor Brent's point that if a work rewards
  postmodern reading strategies, it should be called postmodern?
  "Hypertext," he writes, "is `postmodern' . . . in the sense that it
  makes postmodern `reading' so easy that it is virtually inevitable,
  and `modern' reading so difficult that it is virtually impossible."
  Well, yes, but here again it seems to me Professor Brent is lapsing
  back into language that attributes to the text attributions of the
  reader. "It makes."  "Hypertext *is* postmodern."  Wouldn't his
  sentence be more precise, if less elegant, if it were: We call
  hypertext postmodern because we find it easy to read hypertext in a
  postmodern way and almost impossible to read it in a modern way.

  The problem becomes particularly clear if we use an even more
  problematic term than "postmodern," say, Romantic.  "This poem is
  Romantic because it praises the primitive" or some other of the
  myriad definitions of Romanticism.  If we rephrase: "I call this
  poem Romantic because, as I read it, it praises the primitive," we
  are no longer ontologizing the attribution "Romantic."  We are no
  longer attempting to create the illusion that we all agree about the
  poem or defintions of Romanticism or that we are simply reporting on
  some neutral fact "out there" beyond our fingertips. We are no
  longer involved in the objectivist fallacy (in George Lakoff's
  sense) that *the poem* becomes this or that because of something
  *the poem* does.

  It will of course be said that my insistence on making explicit who
  is doing what introduces an infinite regress, total subjectivity,
  rampant individualism, the autonomous subject, or some other horror.
  Not so.  It simply makes explicit who is doing what.  I think
  Professor Brent agrees with me that the humans are doing things, not
  the artworks.  Then there is the interesting problem of the
  Eliza-type programs, which which my essay began this discussion;
  they evoke the illusion that they are doing something.

  Professor Brent's parting quip at psychoanalysis raises another
  interesting point.  Instead of dismissing psychoanalysis, I believe
  it meshes with constructivist psychology quite usefully.
  Psychoanalysis can add to the constructivist model of human nature a
  way of talking about individual differences.  That is, individuality
  (psychoanalytically understood) is what chooses among the various
  testings posited in constructivist accounts of perception,
  knowledge, action, or memory.  Constructivist psychology discovers
  humans' general strategies for perceiving, knowing, etc., and
  psychoanalysis addresses individual tactics.  But to pursue this
  further would open up a whole new --can of worms?  No, not that
  clich/e.  Would open up a whole new set of dendrites, axons, and
  synapses.

  _The Little Magazine_ ANNOUNCEMENT - November 1994         [line 728]

  Issue 21 of the literary journal _The Little Magazine_ will be
  distributed as a CD-ROM, so we are looking for work which maximizes
  the potential of this medium.  We encourage contributors to conceive
  of their submissions as multi-media "texts" which can incorporate
  graphics, audio and hypertext (and so forth). "Straight" texts will
  also be considered, especially those concerned with issues relating
  to an electronic medium (the attitude need not be positive).

  We will produce the journal using a Microsoft Windows system and
  Asymetrix Multimedia Toolbook, and will accept submissions on disk
  (Macintosh format permissible but not preferred), or via e-mail,
  ftp, or DAT.  Paper as a last resort!  We'd prefer sight and sound
  in digitized format, but we can digitize work for you if we have
  to. Our conceptual / diagrammatic deadline is January 31, and
  technical / final deadline is April 1. Please contact us as soon as
  possible if you have work to contribute.

  About _EJournal_:                                         [line 789]

  _EJournal_ is an all-electronic, e-mail delivered, peer-reviewed,
  academic periodical.  We are particularly interested in theory and
  practice surrounding the creation, transmission, storage,
  interpretation, alteration and replication of electronic "text" -
  broadly defined.  We are also interested in the broader social,
  psychological, literary, economic and pedagogical implications of
  computer- mediated networks.  The journal's essays are delivered
  free to Internet addressees.  Recipients may make paper copies;
  _EJournal_ will provide authenticated paper copy from our read-only
  archive for use by academic deans or others.

  Writers who think their texts might be appreciated by _EJournal_'s
  audience are invited to forward files to EJOURNAL@ALBANY.edu.  If
  you are wondering  about starting to write a piece for to us, feel
  free to ask if it sounds  appropriate.  There are no "styling"
  guidelines; we try to be a little more direct and lively than many
  paper publications, and considerably less hasty and ephemeral than
  most postings to unreviewed electronic spaces.  Essays in the
  vicinity of 5000 words fit our format well.  We read ASCII; we look
  forward to experimenting with other transmission and display formats
  and protocols.
