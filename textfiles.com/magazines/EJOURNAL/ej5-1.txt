  STEVAN HARNAD'S "SUBVERSIVE PROPOSAL":                            [l. 63]
         Kick-Starting Electronic Scholarship
         A Summary and Analysis

  1.  Introduction

  Many readers interested in electronic publishing will know of Stevan
  Harnad, pioneering publisher of _Psycoloquy_, one of the first
  peer-reviewed, all-electronic journals.  In numerous talks and
  articles (Harnad 1990; Harnad 1991; Harnad 1992; Harnad 1995a) he
  has argued that electronic publishing is the logical way to cope
  with the spiraling costs and glacial speed of print publication.  In
  order to save the entire scholarly industry from collapsing under
  the burden of its own ballooning costs, he urges the scholarly
  community to abandon its current "papyrocentric" attitudes and "take
  to the skies."

  Recently, Harnad precipitated a long, lively, provocative, and only
  occasionally acrimonious electronic discussion among some of the key
  players in the electronic publishing field.  (The discussion is
  archived for electronic retrieval at:

  ftp://cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pub/harnad/Psycoloquy/Subversive.Proposal/

  and is being published as a hardcopy collection edited by Ann
  Okerson and James O'Donnell (see references).  He provoked this
  discussion by circulating what he called a "subversive proposal" to
  force the publishing industry to better serve the scholarly
  community.  Like most such discussions, this one follows many
  different threads, recycles back into itself, and sometimes almost
  disappears in the tangle of embedded messages and replies typical of
  electronic polylog.  But in the course of this convoluted exchange
  the participants explore exhaustively many of the most important
  issues concerning the future of scholarly publishing.

  In the present essay I do not presume to offer a wholly new
  contribution to the debate.  Rather, I will first summarize Harnad's
  radical vision for the future of electronic publishing, and then
  present some of the main pro and con arguments from the ensuing
  discussion of this radical vision.  I will also summarize some of
  the more interesting side arguments regarding the economics of the
  Internet in general.  Finally, I will end with some personal
  analysis of the debate and some observations about electronic
  publishing.

  2.  The Subversive Proposal                                 [l. 108]

  As I mentioned above, Harnad and others have long maintained that
  much or all of the future of scholarly publishing lies in
  transferring scholarly research to the internet: what he calls
  "scholarly skywriting."   Internet publication not only eliminates
  much of the cost of publishing, but also allows for an extremely
  quick turnaround of articles and responses to them.  This quick
  turnaround is, of course, especially important in the sciences,
  where ideas become stale within weeks or even days.  But Harnad
  argues for more than timely presentation of ideas.  He argues that
  in the electronic world, *presentation* of ideas as lapidary product
  of thought can be replaced by in-process texts that participate in
  the *development* of thought.  The process is more akin to oral
  dialogue than to electronic representations of finished texts.

  Absolutely fundamental to Harnad's argument is the distinction
  between what he calls the "trade model" of publishing and "esoteric"
  publishing.  "Esoteric" has come to mean "obscure" or "difficult for
  the lay audience to understand," a popular meaning that perhaps
  makes Harnad's choice of terms somewhat unfortunate.  However,
  Harnad is fond of presenting the full dictionary definition of the
  term as follows:

   esoteric   213 aj .es-*-'ter-ik
   LL [italic esotericus], fr. Gk [italic es{o-}terikos], fr. [italic
   es{o-}ter{o-}], compar. of [italic eis{o-}], [italic es{o-}] within,
   fr. [italic eis] into, fr. [italic en] in -- more at [mini IN]
   1 a  aj designed for or understood by the specially initiated alone
   1 b  aj of or relating to knowledge that is restricted to a small group
   2 a  aj limited to a small circle <~ pursuits>
   2 b  aj [mini PRIVATE], [mini CONFIDENTIAL] <an ~ purpose>
           esoterically 21313 av  -i-k(*-)l{e-}
                                      (Harnad 1995)

  According to this definition, esoteric publishing is obscure to the
  lay audience only as a side-effect of the fact that it is aimed at a
  very small circle of readers.  This circle can range from several
  thousand in "mainstream" disciplines to a handful in the more
  specialized sub-subdisciplines of science.  Opposed to this form of
  publishing is "trade" publishing, which because it is designed to
  make money has to appeal to a reasonably large audience.

  This has other important implications.  Trade publication must
  obviously be protected by copyright; if anyone could copy trade
  works, publishers could not make money.  In other words, trade
  publication requires *as an essential condition of its being* that
  access be restricted.  This "pay-to-see" model applies even to
  highly subsidized academic journals, which must nonetheless receive
  *some* subscription revenue in order to stay afloat.  The costs of
  paper publication require a predictable revenue flow.

  A need for predictable revenue offers little problem for, say,
  established novelists, who want to make money from the sale of their
  books.  However, such a model-- where access is by necessity
  *restricted* --is exactly antithetical to scholarly work.  Scholars
  are paid by their institutions and by granting agencies in direct
  proportion to their scholarly output and reputation.  This in turn
  is closely linked to readership.  The more people who read, respond
  to, and build on a scholar's work, the better off she is, not only
  in terms of the intangible satisfaction of having made a difference,
  but also financially.  The "consumers" of scholarly publishing, in
  the sense of the people who actually derive benefit from it, are not
  the readers but the writers.                                [l. 171]

  Scholars have consented to having their works published and sold in
  trade format simply because there was no other way to get their
  ideas in circulation. Harnad repeatedly calls this arrangement a
  "Faustian bargain."  This bargain is not necessarily motivated by
  the greed of individual publishers, an allegation that many have
  read into Harnad's comments but which I am convinced is a
  misinterpretation.  It is simply a structural constraint of the
  medium. Yet the term "Faustian" certainly suggests that the union
  between scholarly production and a capitalist economy is a
  necessity, not a virtue.  As Harnad puts it,

    Both the trade author and the esoteric author had to be
    prepared to make a Faustian bargain with the paper publisher
    (who was not, by the way, the devil either, but likewise a
    victim of the bargain; the only devil would have been the
    Blind Watchmaker who designed our planet and its means of
    publication until the advent of the electronic publication
    era).  (Harnad, 1995b)

  Since the demise of monastic scriptoria this relationship has been
  the only game in town.

  Electronic publication obviously provides an alternative to this
  bargain.  Yet electronic publication has been slow in coming and
  slower in meeting acceptance.  Many on-line journals are nothing
  more than mirrors of paper journals, which continue to be the main
  conduits for academic knowledge and associated academic rewards.

  Trade publishers are obviously in no hurry to move to electronic
  publishing because it is difficult to see how to make any money at
  it.  Harnad's "subversive proposal" suggests that scholars not wait
  for the publishing industry to ooze slowly onto the net.  Taking his
  cue from Paul Ginsparg's incredibly successful electronic archive

     http://xxx.lanl.gov/

  which reportedly receives 45,000 hits per day (Harnad 1995a; see
  also Stix 1994), Harnad recommends that we leave the publishing
  industry behind and take to the skies ourselves:

    If every esoteric author in the world this very day
    established a globally accessible local ftp archive for every
    piece of esoteric writing he did from this day forward, the
    long-heralded transition from paper publication to purely
    electronic publication (of esoteric research) would follow
    suit almost immediately.  (Harnad 1995a)                  [l. 218]

  This archive would begin with preprints, as Ginsparg's does.
  However, as soon as a work was published in "standard" format,
  authors would replace the preprint version with the published
  version.  The trade publication model would immediately become
  untenable for esoteric publication.  Publishers would be forced to
  figure out a way to co-operate with scholarly skywriting or abandon
  it altogether, making their profits only by publishing non-scholarly
  works for which there is high demand.  Thus scholarly preprints
  would "break down the doors" for fully refereed publication in
  electronic format (e-print.06).  Scholars and scholarly electronic
  journals, meanwhile, would be totally supported as they are
  partially supported now, by subsidy rather than by market revenues.

  Others, including _EJournal_, have been championing electronic
  publication for years.  What is particularly radical about Harnad's
  proposal is his recommendation of direct action on the part of the
  scholarly community, action that would end the hegemony of the
  publishing industry.  In a sense, he has declared war on the
  industry that until now has been the major conduit for academics'
  only  "product"-- scholarship.

  3.  The Debate about the Proposal

  The long intertwining threads of debate spawned by this proposal can
  be grouped into several categories.  Many of the discussions are
  technical in nature, having to do with technical standards,
  centralized versus distributed sites, etc.  I will not attempt to
  summarize these issues here.  However, I will try to provide a
  sketch of the controversy in four main areas: publishing costs,
  network costs, quality control, and stewardship.

  3.1.  Publishing Costs

  An important plank in Harnad's platform is his assertion that
  scholarly writing on the net is cheap enough that it does not
  require a trade model for support.  Harnad adamantly insists that
  electronic journals can be produced for 25% of the cost of paper
  journals.  Some scholars, such as Lorrin Garson of the American
  Chemical Association, disagree.  Garson argues that electronic
  publication will still cost at least 75% of the cost of paper
  publication because only a fraction of the cost of a paper journal
  actually goes into physical reproduction and distribution.  The rest
  is "first-copy" cost, which includes the labour of editing, setting
  up tables, proofreading, etc. (Note to Stevan Harnad, vpieg-l, 29
  June 1994).
                                                              [l. 265]
  Harnad defends his figure by pointing out that many of the tools
  needed to set up charts and tables are currently available to
  authors and that authors need no longer pay publishers to do this
  work for them.  Powerful public-domain search tools will make other
  services provided by publishers, such as indexing, equally obsolete.
  Quality control, the main remaining cost of publication, is usually
  handled by editors and reviewers who perform their task as part of
  their scholarly mandate, not for immediate financial reward.

  Andrew Odlyzko (appropriately, a mathematician), supports Harnad's
  argument by calculating that, although the average article in
  Mathematics costs about $20,000 to *author* (the total cost of
  supporting a researcher divided by average output of articles), if
  produced electronically it would only cost about $4000 to *publish*
  (e-print.15; see also Odlyzko 1994).  By re-engineering the
  publishing enterprise to eliminate many layers of now-unnecessary
  specialists, costs could be brought down far lower, to an estimated
  $400 - $1,000 per article.  This cost, Odlyzko claims, would still
  be too high to make pay-per-view a viable option, but it could
  easily be covered by a subsidy model like Harnad's.

  This model also dismisses the much-ballyhooed "copyright" issue as a
  red herring as far as scholarly publishing is concerned.  Since
  scholars never expect to get paid directly for their work anyway,
  the ability to protect profit by restricting copying is simply not
  an issue (e-print.09).  It only became an issue in scholarly
  publishing because publishers-- not scholars --had to protect their
  financial investment in the paper infrastructure.

  Central to this argument is the distinction between mirroring of
  paper journals and true electronic publishing (like _EJournal_)
  which never sees print at all.  Even all-electronic archives are
  frequently no more than warehouses for scanned versions of paper
  copy-- what Ginsparg deprecates as the "scan-and-shred" attitude to
  publishing.  Only all-electronic journals have the potential to free
  themselves from the Faustian bargain with publishers.

  3.2. Network Costs

  One argument against the future of all-electronic journals is that
  they are cheap only because the have been getting a free ride on the
  Internet.  As more services migrate to the net, and bandwidth
  becomes even more strained than it is now, it may be necessary for
  network providers to charge for carriage (Okerson, who-pays.16; see
  also "Culture Shock").  These charges have the potential to wipe out
  the cost savings of electronic scholarly journals.

  Harnad points out that the Internet has also been giving a free ride
  to "porno-graphics, flaming and trivial pursuit," all of which might
  be looked to as ways of subsidizing the net before looking to
  scholarly publication (e-print.08).  But again, the most interesting
  argument comes from a mathematician, Odlyzko.
                                                              [l. 318]
  Since it is impossible to tell the difference between a packet of
  text and a packet of graphics, video or audio data, Internet pricing
  would have to be largely by-the-byte, perhaps with a surcharge for a
  guarantee of no delays to permit applications such as
  videoconferencing to proceed without interruption. By doing some
  "back of an envelope" calculations, he surmises that the average
  scholarly article in markup ASCII would cost something like 1/10,000
  the cost of a one-hour videoconference (who-pays.19).  Therefore the
  costs of maintaining and upgrading the physical structure of the net
  would be borne by high-end applications, not scholarly publishing
  (see also MacKie-Mason and Varian).

  3.3. Quality Control

  Probably the biggest problem that electronic scholarly journals face
  is quality control.  Despite his optimistic claims for the future of
  electronic publishing, Harnad suggests that the Internet in its
  present state is little more than a "global graffiti board" in which
  unregulated conversation seldom attains the status of scholarship
  (who-pays.03).  Other scholars such as Paul Ginsparg claim that this
  may be true of large areas of the net such as Usenet, but that other
  areas, such as his own electronic archive, have maintained high
  scholarly standards.  Harnad, however, points out that such
  scholarly enclaves are in an extreme minority.  Moreover, preprint
  archives such as Ginsparg's are "parasitic on the refereed paper
  literature for which most of its PREprints are ultimately destined"
  (who-pays.03).  In other words, the preprints are generally of good
  quality because they are destined for a paper publication system
  which already has in place a mature and well-organized peer-review
  system.

  This does not mean that a peer-review system cannot migrate to the
  net; in many case it has done so already.  Harnad simply points out
  that electronic scholarship has a huge public relations job ahead of
  it if it is going to convince the scholarly world that it can do the
  job as well as paper publishing.  A key component of this
  public-relations job will be a coding system that not only tells the
  reader whether an article is peer-reviewed, but also how rigorous
  the peer-review is, thus locating it in a prestige hierarchy similar
  to the one that has long reigned in print (who-pays.03).

  An interesting sidebar to this argument is a proposal that the
  current system of up-front evaluation of articles could be replaced
  by a system that is in many ways more democratic.  David Stodolsky
  argues (who-pays.11) that we could abandon peer review altogether if
  we let everyone publish anything and let citation rates be the true
  measure of academic success.  Citation-counting, an almost
  impossible job in print, should be relatively easy to automate in
  cyberspace.  Harnad dismisses this idea:  "I do not believe for a
  minute, even in our absurdly populist age, that a popularity contest
  and box scores can or will replace the systematic scrutiny
  administered by editors and referees (imperfect as that is)."
  (who-pays.13).  Nonetheless, Stodolsky raises some interesting
  possibilities occasioned by the powerful bibliometric apparatus
  available on the net.

  3.4. Stewardship                                            [l. 375]

  If scholarship does indeed "take to the skies," who should be in
  charge of publishing and preserving it?  Harnad's model takes its
  inspiration from unregulated personal sites such as Ginsparg's
  electronic archive, with the addition of peer review to the brew to
  make public archives less "parasitic on the paper-based review
  process."  However, he leaves open the possibility that publishers
  could move to electronic publication in order to avoid being left
  behind, as long as they are prepared to go along with the "new
  order" of open access to knowledge.

  Others are not so sure.  Stodolsky, for instance, argues that
  commercial publishers are a lost cause because of their inherent
  conflict of interest, and suggests that there is more potential in
  commercial operators that benefit rather than lose by the move to
  on-line access.  One suggestion is smart-card operators who are in
  the business of supplying secure access to data (e-print.12).

  Regardless of who originates the data, the long-term question is who
  will ensure that it remains accessible for the future.  This, argues
  Peter Graham, is the traditional job of the librarian, not the
  scholar, the publisher, or the commercial vendor (e-print.12).  Bill
  Turner of Cornell Library neatly summarizes many of the most common
  worries in this area: that archives may not be secure, that the data
  may shift or be corrupted, that mistakes will be impossible to
  correct (e-print.17).   Harnad retorts that most of these problems,
  especially the difficulty of correcting mistakes, are equally if not
  more characteristic of paper publication (e-print.17).  Secure,
  encrypted, off-line archives will ensure the integrity of original
  versions for those who are truly worried about this issue.

  The arguments regarding both the technology and the philosophy of
  long-term storage and accessibility are too complex to summarize
  here, and are in a sense peripheral to the "subversive proposal"
  itself.  But archiving is an important piece of the puzzle.
  Libraries promise to have a much more active role in the
  dissemination of knowledge in the electronic universe than in the
  paper universe, particularly if traditional publishers ultimately
  drop out of the equation.  (See Frank Quinn's article on this
  subject in _EJournal_ V4N2.)

  4.  Analysis and Commentary

  Harnad's optimistic vision of virtually free knowledge on the
  Internet is certainly attractive.  His differentiation between
  "trade" and "esoteric" publishing, obvious once stated his way,
  clarifies a distinction often blurred in discussions about
  "products" on the Internet, and his acknowledgement that copyright
  is simply irrelevant in esoteric publication removes a serious red
  herring. Perhaps most important, he has the courage to point out
  that, although publishers have performed an invaluable service to
  scholars for generations, their service lies in dealing with the
  intricacies of preparing and distributing paper.  Much of this work
  may simply be irrelevant to electronic scholarship.
                                                              [l. 430]
  Quality control must surely be the most central issue here.
  Considering the incredible pressure to publish, and the amount of
  junk scholarship that finds its way even into existing paper
  publications, and the incredible over-supply of publications that
  defies the most heroic efforts of scholars to keep up with their
  discipline, I am not terribly comfortable with Harnad's optimism
  that quality control mechanisms will *automatically* migrate to the
  net.

  Harold Innis (1951) argues that media have a built-in bias toward
  certain types of social activity.  The bias of paper is a function
  of its relative high cost, permanence and slowness (Innis calls it a
  "light" medium only in comparison to stone and clay).  The cost of
  paper publication does not in itself ensure quality, but it
  represents a built-in incentive to establish quality control
  mechanisms.  When a piece of research appears in print, the reader
  has the assurance of knowing that someone has spent a considerable
  amount of money to get it there and will therefore have taken some
  steps to ensure that it is worth the cost.  Not so in electronic
  space.

  In addition, paper publication provides tangible, object-centered
  quality indicators.  Expensively produced, polished-looking journals
  naturally carry a prestige that cheaply produced journals do not,
  for the above reasons.  The fact that journals are distinct entities
  in which individual articles are subsumed under a larger series,
  itself an artefact of print publication, also allows certain
  journals to acquire a reputation over time.  Electronic publication,
  especially the individually archived preprint, has none of these
  quality-control signals.  In other words, the "bias of the medium"
  means that the physical characteristics of print publication carry
  with them some important side benefits which may not migrate to
  electronic space as easily as Harnad assumes.

  Anyone whose sins have compelled her to function as an editor will
  also know how poorly many scholars edit their own work.  Material
  that would be returned unmarked if submitted as an undergraduate
  term paper somehow manages to get sent for publication.  An editor
  who is earnest about getting material in print, and is not in charge
  of a journal of such high prestige that she can pick and choose
  freely from a significant oversupply of good manuscripts, must
  labour mightily to extract wheat from chaff.  Because the boundary
  between chat forums and scholarly journals has no physical markers
  in cyberspace, the electronic editor must work even harder to
  convince both readers and writers that she is not running a "global
  graffiti board."  This is not to say that such tasks are impossible,
  but it is to say that the bias of the medium may make them more
  difficult.  If archived preprints do manage to "break down the
  doors" of electronic scholarship and break away from the Faustian
  bargain, the peer-reviewed electronic journals that follow will have
  to labour mightily to establish and keep their reputations without
  the hardcopy signals of quality that we have grown so attached to.
                                                              [l. 483]
  Unfortunately, we can already see signs that the economics of print
  are migrating to the net in ways that blow very cold on the back the
  neck.  One electronic journal, the _Electronic Journal of
  Communication_, began as a totally free journal supported by
  whatever academic brownie points its editors and contributors
  accumulated for their labours.  However, the Comserve system that
  archives and distributes _EJC_ is now part of CIOS, the
  Communication Institute for Online Scholarship.  In order to raise
  money for its activities, CIOS charges for membership, and denies
  full database retrieval privileges to non-members.  These charges
  are undoubtedly justified; there is only so much that a free service
  can accomplish on goodwill and public purse.  But the effect is that
  _EJC_ is now confined behind exactly the same sort of firewall that
  Harnad denounces as antithetical to esoteric scholarship.  Its
  authors are in some ways less accessible than if they published only
  in print journals that their colleagues could read in libraries free
  of charge.

  Another disturbing trend is the invention of "ecash," a secure
  electronic medium of exchange that obviates the need to transmit
  charge card information over the net (see the Ecash Home Page at

    http://www.digicash.com/ecash ).

  Such a mechanism makes perfect sense in the context of classic trade
  models such as mail-order commodities, commercial journals, and
  commercial films, music and the like.  The problem is that in its
  present form, ecash doesn't represent "real" money at all.  It is
  intended for use as part of a totally on-line economy.  You use
  ecash to buy access to on-line information that has been placed in
  electronic "shopping malls."  If you run out of ecash, the only way
  to get more is to post some information that you hope others will
  find useful enough to buy.

  The system has not had, and probably will not have, any influence on
  electronic scholarship.  In fact, commercial transactions on the Net
  are undoubtedly necessary in order to pay for the infrastructure and
  ensure that scholarship can still get a free, or cheap, ride.  But
  it is nonetheless disturbing to see the development of a powerful
  incentive to sell what has traditionally been posted free.  Since
  information is the main "product" of the Net, there is an incentive
  for this market economy to migrate from a trade in sex toys to
  a trade in knowledge.  I don't disparage everything about capitalism,
  but I have to admit that it has been refreshing to work in a medium
  which has until recently been free of market forces by virtue of its
  technological structure.

  Where is all of this heading?  Of course we really have no idea, any
  more than Gutenberg did when he began his work.  What is clear is
  that economics and technology have a very uneasy relationship.  We
  have depended on an economically driven reward system for the
  distribution of our ideas ever since the printing press made the
  tribally subsidized bard obsolete.  It is not at all clear whether
  the Internet, rapidly turning into the "Information Highway"
  complete with toll booths and fast-food restaurants, will be able to
  reverse this dependency.  Harnad's image of the "Faustian bargain"
  for the soul of academic knowledge is more apt than I like to think.
                                                             [l. 541]
  Probably the most important lesson of Harnad's work is that
  cyberspace is a medium inherently different from print, and that
  current "papyrocentric" models (one of Harnad's most felicitous
  terms) are likely to be very short on vision.  One is reminded of
  the incunabula period of the book trade, during which books were
  printed to look as much like manuscripts as possible, and the Abbot
  of Sponheim urged monks to keep copying manuscripts by hand both to
  encourage diligence and devotion and to circumvent the
  "impermanence" of printed publication on paper (Eisenstein 1979:
  14).  We must remember that esoteric publication has had its crises
  of distribution and quality control before, and that some of the
  solutions to these crises-- including the Faustian bargain with the
  for-profit publication industry --were totally unimaginable by those
  at the centre of the shift.  Media, knowledge and money have
  performed an intricate dance for many hundreds of years, and we can
  be certain that, whatever form the dance takes next, all three
  partners will be involved.

  EDITORIAL COMMENT                                          [l. 687]
  E-PUBLISHING AND QUALITY CONTROL

  It looks as if two facile assumptions-- that e-publishing is
  (merely) expedient and that (only) paper publishing is permanent--
  will fade gradually during the transition to paperless publishing of
  "esoteric" texts.  That's fine.  All in good time.  Meanwhile and
  beyond, though, worries about maintaining standards will continue.

  One big worry is that unreviewed self-publication is so easy on the
  net that we'll be overwhelmed with junk.  Not to worry; academics
  will will seek and find someone to filter the junk for them.
  Junk-detectors can establish reputations as easily in e-space as in
  the paper-bound world.

  A second worry, less often heard, is that the ease and speed of peer
  review in e-space might stifle discovery.  Originality could be
  suffocated by the volume of complaints from establishmentarians;
  accommodating all objections could lead to bland committee reports
  instead of unequivocal declarations.  Again, that worry fades when
  seen as a procedural, not a medium-related, concern.

  A third quality-control concern is usually associated with
  narrowness of specialization.  Some cynics think that a cadre of
  sub-sub-specialists within a discipline can easily promote each
  others' careers by just starting a journal, publishing their
  buddies' work, and arguing that no one else is qualified to find
  fault with what *they* agree is good work.  Unless one knows how
  much money and effort it takes to start a journal, the whole
  process-- including peer review -- can look like a mutual-promotion
  collaboration.

  Here's where the medium makes a big difference.  Finding specialists
  to collaborate with is easier through e-mail than on paper.  And
  "starting a journal" on the net, although not effortless, is
  inxpensive.  Most telling: In circumstances where some colleagues
  feel left out of the loop--  they don't read texts on a screen --the
  intellectual integrity of an electronic journal is questionable by
  default.  (A printout doesn't look "published.")

  In such a context, this current issue of _EJournal_ looks especially
  suspicious. It consists of an assessment of Stevan Harnad's
  "Subversive Proposal" and the follow-up exchanges.  Stevan is a
  member of our Advisory Board. The author, Doug Brent, is one of our
  Consulting Editors, and a frequent contributor.  Ann Okerson,
  another member of the Board, has co-edited a collection of the same
  texts.   Have we conspired to promote each other, or a point of
  view?  No.  But the problem,  the perception problem, the medium-related
  problem, is real.  Electronic journals cannot dismiss this vector of
  skepticism about their legitimacy with an easy retort about how "the
  issues are the same in any medium."

  About _EJournal_ V5N1:  I asked Doug Brent to summarize and review
  the "Subversive Proposal" archive last winter.  The editorial
  process was anonymous; the reviewers did not know who had written
  the essay, nor that I had asked for it.  After reading it, they did
  have some reservations, but recommended publication without dissent.
  I didn't know at that point that Ann Okerson was working on a
  paper-based collection of the discussion.

  Believers in electronic delivery of academic texts cannot shrug off
  the understandable reservations some colleagues will have about
  quality.  Louder and louder explanations of how wonderful we are
  won't help; the default skepticism will disappear only with
  generational succession.  Meanwhile, sound procedures and
  self-conscious attention to integrity are crucial to earning our
  colleagues' respect.  And doing some good things that paper-based
  journals don't do-- as Stevan Harnad and Paul Ginsparg are doing
  -- won't hurt at all.

  About "Supplements":

  _EJournal_ continues to experiment with ways of revising, responding
  to, reworking, or even retracting the texts we publish.  Authors who
  want to address a subject already broached --by others or by
  themselves-- may send texts for us to consider publishing as a
  Supplement issue.  Proposed supplements will not go through as
  thorough an editorial review process as the essays they annotate.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  About _EJournal_:

  _EJournal_ is an all-electronic, e-mail delivered, peer-reviewed,
  academic periodical.  We are particularly interested in theory and
  practice surrounding the creation, transmission, storage,
  interpretation, alteration and replication of electronic "text" -
  including "display" -  broadly defined.  We are also interested in
  the broader social, psychological, literary, economic and
  pedagogical implications of computer-mediated networks.  The
  journal's essays are delivered free to Internet addressees.
  Recipients may make paper copies; _EJournal_ will provide
  authenticated paper copy from our read-only archive if needed by
  academic deans or others.

  Writers who think their texts might be appreciated by _EJournal_'s
  audience are invited to forward files to EJOURNAL@ALBANY.edu  If you
  are wondering about starting to write a piece for to us, feel free
  to ask if it sounds appropriate.  There are no "styling" guidelines;
  we try to be a little more direct and lively than many paper
  publications, and considerably less hasty and ephemeral than most
  postings to unreviewed electronic spaces.  Essays in the vicinity of
  5000 words fit our format well.  We read ASCII; we look forward to
  experimenting with other transmission and display formats and
  protocols.
