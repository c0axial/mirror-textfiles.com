Editorial Notes                                                       [line 58]

    This issue carries a followup exchange on the subject of ownership
and copyright of electronic texts, a thread that started a year ago.
    It also delivers two questionnaires.  One is about electronic
journals and libraries, and one is about you.
    Please respond to both of them.
    They are not audience surveys to help us make promises to
advertisers.  They have to do with our sliver of what the networks
are-- or can be --all about.
    If all 2787 of you decide not to respond to the first one, about
libraries and how they ought to treat the fledgling phenomenon of
electronic journals, librarians might find it easy to ignore us.
    No matter what reputation _EJournal_ and other experiments build
for ourselves inside cyberspace, we'll all remain merely virtual if
librarians decide we're too much trouble to share with
non-subscribers.
    That first questionnaire consists of 22 items designed by an
Information Science investigator; they can be responded to easily with
an "extraction" maneuver and e-mailed to Meta Reid at an RPI address,
or they can be printed out and penciled in and sent via fax or snail
mail.
    The second one, ten items, asks about your relationship with
_EJournal_.  Your responses will help us understand how diverse a
group you are and what you want from us.
    You can e-mail to peter.gorny@arbi.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de or
to us, or fax or snail mail to us.  We can't quite promise you
anonymity, but we will remove all message-header information (from
everything sent here) before we start looking at what respondents say.
    We anticipate coming up with some interesting totals and
percentages to share with you, but you shouldn't anticipate
sophisticated cross-referential analysis.
    We want to refer to the two questionnaires as "1992 Surveys," so
please don't file this issue under "to be taken care of later" --
respond now.  (We can use January responses, though.)  Our thanks.
    The next issue, which we hope to have on its way in just a few
days, delivers an essay about the interactive "Oracle" writing space,
with observations about the nature of "authorship" in an electronic
context.                                                              [line 96]
    May you savor a super solstice season, and a noteworthy 1993.

An Ownership/Copyright Exchange - Allen and Dilworth

--  from Jonathan Allen:

Dear Professor Dilworth,

I found your recent Ejournal essay interesting and useful.  It
opened my  eyes to the importance of indirect compensation--the
gains in prestige  and future career progress--for rewarding the
creation of intellectual  property in the electronic era.  Indirect  [line 438]
compensation will be enough motivation to produce intellectual
property in more cases than are commonly assumed, I agree, but in
how many more cases?  If most compensation is indirect, how will
the mix of intellectual artifacts produced be affected?

Indirect compensation, it seems to me, rests on two assumption:  1)
that  the value of intellectual property is primarily related to
the value and  the creativity of the ideas, rather than the effort
put into the collection, assembly, and expression of information;
and 2) that the career paths and personal motivations of authors
are closely tied to the  potential for future publication.  These
assumptions are valid for many  academics, for instance, but not
always.  I would guess that textbooks  would be undervalued
relative to their commercial value.

In the larger publishing world, I would guess that the lack of
direct compensation would relatively discourage the production of
published materials that emphasize mundane effort over creative
ideas--manuals, directories, and reference works of all kinds.  The
author that spends  many months or years compiling a list of bed-
and-breakfast inns, or a detailed repair manual for a Honda Civic,
is probably a lot more interested in being compensated directly
than in adding an item to their  vita.  The increased uncertainty
(of an economic kind) could become a powerful disincentive to
produce.  I don't want us to fall into the trap  of thinking that
academic research work is the norm for our electronic  future.

Thanks again for an interesting essay.  Sincerely,

Jonathan Allen
Dept. of Information and Computer Science
University of California, Irvine.

--  reply from John Dilworth:

Dear Professor Allen,

Thanks for your interesting comments on my _EJournal_ essay.         [line 476]

I agree that indirect compensation may be a less significant factor
in overall reward in the case of more routine literary tasks.
However, I don't regard this as clearly a problem which will have
to be addressed as electronic media become more prominent.  Nor is
indirect compensation significant only in academic contexts.

If we go back to basics for a moment, and ask why people are
motivated to write anything at all, financial compensation (whether
direct or indirect) is only one factor. It has to be adequate
enough so that talented people think their efforts will not go
unrewarded, but not much more than that.  Publishers generally are
swamped by literary submissions of all kinds, submitted for all
kinds of reasons, so some falloff in volume might even be welcomed
by them.

If excellent submissions became hard to obtain, publishers would
have to pay more direct compensation to non-academic authors, or
offer promises of larger advances on future works (another form of
indirect compensation).  Electronic media could finance such
payments for general electronic publishing by charging subscribers
a fee of some kind. This is not clearly undesirable, because a
willingness to pay at least a minimal subscription fee does give
evidence of genuine demand for a literary product. Perhaps we need
not be too concerned about potentially discouraging authors whose
efforts no-one would have wanted to read anyway.

On the relevance of indirect compensation to non-academic as well
as academic authorship, adding an item demonstrating authorship
skills to one's job Resume is just as potentially rewarding as a
publication in an academic Vita.  With the increasingly volatile
job market in every area, solid evidence of past achievement is
exactly what is needed for speedy promotion or beneficial re-
hiring. Though I emphasised creative originality in my essay,
superior expression or presentation would also be generally
rewarded through indirect compensation in such contexts.
With best wishes,
                                                                     [line 514]

About "Supplements":

_EJournal_ is experimenting with ways of revising, responding to, reworking, or
even retracting the texts we publish.  Authors who want to address a subject
already broached --by others or by themselves-- may send texts for us to
consider publishing as a Supplement issue.  Proposed supplements will not go
through as thorough an editorial review process as the essays they annotate.
                                                                     [line 553]

About Letters:

_EJournal_ is willing publish letters to the editor.  But we make no
predictions about how many, which ones, or what format.  The "Letters" column
of a periodical is a habit of the paper environment, and  _EJournal_ readers
can send outraged objections to our essays directly to the authors.  Also, we
can publish substantial counter-statements as articles in their own right, or as
"Supplements."  Even so, when we get brief, thoughtful statements that appear
to be of interest to many subscribers they will appear as "Letters."  Please
send them to  EJOURNAL@ALBANY.bitnet .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About Reviews:

_EJournal_ is willing to publish reviews of almost anything that seems to fit
under our broad umbrella: the implications of electronic networks and texts.
We do not, however, solicit and thus cannot provide review copies of fiction,
prophecy, critiques, other texts, programs, hardware, lists or bulletin boards.
But if you would like to bring any publicly available information to our
readers' attention, send your review (any length) to us, or ask if writing one
sounds to us like a good idea.

About _EJournal_:

_EJournal_ is an all-electronic, Matrix distributed, peer-reviewed, academic
periodical.  We are particularly interested in theory and practice surrounding
the creation, transmission, storage, interpretation, alteration and replication
of electronic text.  We are also interested in the broader social,
psychological, literary, economic and pedagogical implications of computer-
mediated networks. The journal's essays are delivered free to Bitnet/Internet/
Usenet addressees.  Recipients may make paper copies; _EJournal_ will provide
authenticated paper copy from our read-only archive for use by academic deans
or others.  Individual essays, reviews, stories-- texts --sent to us will be
disseminated to subscribers as soon as they have been through the editorial
process, which will also be "paperless."  We expect to offer access through
libraries to our electronic Contents and Abstracts, and to be indexed and
abstracted in appropriate places.                                    [line 592]

Writers who think their texts might be appreciated by _EJournal_'s audience are
invited to forward files to EJOURNAL@ALBANY.bitnet .  If you are wondering
about starting to write a piece for to us, feel free to ask if it sounds
appropriate.  There are no "styling" guidelines; we try to be a little more
direct and lively than many paper publications, and considerably less hasty and
ephemeral than most postings to unreviewed electronic spaces.  We read ASCII;
we look forward to experimenting with other transmission and display formats
and protocols.
