                        Information Technology and the
                      Breakdown of "Places" of Knowledge             [l. 58]

                               Douglas A. Brent

  In this essay I wish to argue that information technology --
  electronic mail, electronic conferencing, digitized interactive
  video, and the other gifts of the "information highway" -- will not
  only interconnect people but will speed the dissolution of barriers
  between disciplines.

  Stated baldly in this way, this is a totally unremarkable argument.
  Since electronic communication arose in the mid-Nineteenth Century,
  people have been grandly claiming that it will usher in a new era of
  harmony and connectedness (see Marvin 1988 for a fascinating
  compendium of "electrical revolution" narratives).  It takes only a
  brief look at the history of technological revolutions to make one
  suspicious of such claims.  Consider the following effusion:

    How potent a power is [communication technology] destined to
    become in the civilization of the world!  This binds together
    by a vital cord all the nations of the earth.  It is
    impossible that old prejudices and hostilities should longer
    exist, while such an instrument has been created for an
    exchange of thought between all nations of the earth.

  This claim was made in 1858 by Briggs and Maverick regarding the
  telegraph (Carey 1989).  Such examples of "the rhetoric of the
  technological sublime" (to use a phrase that Carey borrows from Leo
  Marx) should help us resist the temptation to assume that walls
  between people will automatically fall to any technological ram's
  horn that comes along.
                                                             [l.  89]
  On the other hand, there is no doubt that communication and
  information technology has made astounding changes in social
  organization and in the status of knowledge.  Carey himself has
  shown how the telegraph effected profound changes in "popular ideas"
  of time and space, economic and social conditions, and philosophical
  notions of the relationship between transportation and
  communication.  His point is simply that the results of a
  technological revolution are frequently more subtle than are
  supposed by proponents of the technological sublime, and frequently
  more far-reaching.  If we proceed with caution, then, we can use
  some of the changes that have already happened as indicators of
  larger patterns, in turn enabling us to predict, or at least guess
  more accurately, what new technologies can bring.

  The particular pattern I am interested in here is the breakdown of
  specialized realms of knowledge in the age of electronic
  communication.  The rise of specialized knowledge out of the warm,
  intimate "noetic world" of primary orality has been exhaustively
  discussed by Havelock (1963), Ong (1982), Logan (1986) and others.
  I won't rehearse their arguments here except to say that these
  authors attribute most of the characteristics of the modern "western
  mind," including the specialization of knowledge, to the ability to
  record thought in abstract, categorizable units that are distanced
  from the authors.  Though some authors challenge the extreme version
  of what has been called the "cognitive great divide" theory (Bizell,
  1988), its basic premise -- that the modern world could not have
  come about without the distancing, specializing power of printed
  text -- has in the main held firm.                          [l. 117]

  The second part of this theory, argued most forcibly by Marshall
  McLuhan, is that electronic communication is reversing this trend.
  McLuhan's famous phrase "the global village" is frequently taken to
  mean simply that people can connect easily to others anywhere in the
  world.  McLuhan, however, uses the phrase to point to a much deeper
  change in social organization and individual psychology.  In
  _Understanding Media_, he argues that the electric media speak the
  language of narrative and myth rather than abstracted intellectual
  thought.  Under their influence, the children of the television age
  are growing up with an outlook marked by "wholeness, unity and
  depth."  However, he also calls attention to a profound
  discontinuity between the retribalized social sphere and the still
  fragmented academic world.  At school, the child "encounters a world
  organized by means of classified information.  The subjects are
  unrelated.  They are visually conceived in terms of a blueprint"
  (McLuhan 1964:ix).  For the academic world is still organized
  according to the abstract, linear, classificatory world of print.
  "We actually live mythically and integrally, as it were, but we
  continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of
  the pre-electric age (McLuhan 1964:20).

  McLuhan is always better at proposing ideas in general terms than at
  working out their detailed implications.  In this essay I would like
  to examine this discontinuity more closely, using Joshua Meyrowitz's
  theories of media to provide a conceptual framework in which to
  explore the question of why the academic world has continued to be
  dominated by these "old, fragmented space and time patterns."  I
  will also turn to recent explorations of the rhetoric of
  disciplinarity to characterize this fragmentation more exactly and
  to provide a basis for speculating on how information technology may
  extend the "retribalization" of popular culture into the
  intellectual world.                                         [l. 150]

  In _No Sense of Place_ (1985), Meyrowitz offers a detailed analysis
  of the falling-together of cultural divisions in the television age.
  He does so by using Goffman's social theories to extend McLuhan's
  basic analysis of electric media.  Goffman (1974) argues that human
  interactions are governed by social roles, roles which shift
  according to social situation.  For instance, when a doctor is "on
  stage," performing in her expert role as a professional examining a
  patient, she plays out a specific set of interactions that emphasise
  professionalism, objectivity, expertise, and distance.  When "back
  stage," such as at lunch with her colleagues, she may display much
  more informal behaviours, including both doubts and glib remarks
  that she would never display in front of a patient.  The same
  applies to waiters while they are serving as opposed to while they
  are chatting in the kitchen.

  Meyrowitz applies this dramaturgical model to media.  Goffman
  relates social situation to physical setting, but for Meyrowitz, it
  is not so much the literal geography of a social setting -- the
  eating area as opposed to the kitchen -- that matters, but the
  pattern of information flow, which is only incidentally related to
  physical location.  A "given pattern of access to social
  information, a given pattern of access to the behaviour of other
  people" (37) controls the elements of the social drama.  Note, for
  instance, how we can enter a totally different social information
  system, with attendant changes in behaviour, just by placing a hand
  over a telephone receiver and making an unprofessional aside to a
  spouse or co-worker.  We leave the social space of our telephone
  conversation with, say, a client, and enter another, less formal
  social space simply by entering another realm of communication.

  Meyrowitz goes on to argue that in the past many social distinctions
  have been maintained because information flow could be controlled.
  Leaving aside electric media, information flow normally takes place
  either through face-to-face interactions or through print.
  Face-to-face interactions are controlled by space: just as waiters
  can talk about different things in the kitchen than they do in the
  restaurant, parents can talk about different things in their
  bedrooms than they do at the dinner table, and men can talk
  differently with other men on an all-male fishing trip from the way
  they can at a mixed-gender party.  The world of print, on the other
  hand, is controlled by access to the code.  Children are completely
  excluded from the print world until school age; other social and
  professional spheres are separated by layers of specialization in
  the print code, layers that naturally develop.  Without special
  training, the key texts of one discipline are simply unreadable by
  members of another discipline.
                                                              [l. 198]
  Television changes much of this by making social information
  available everywhere to anyone who can press a channel changer.
  Children and adults, men and women, experts and novices, public and
  private figures, all have access to more or less the same
  information system.  Back stage and front stage have given way to
  the universally accessible "middle stage" virtual space of
  television.  As a result, argues Myrowitz, the generation of the
  sixties, the first generation to have grown up with television, saw
  the breaking-down of barriers between the sexes, between children
  and adults, between expert and novice, between authority figures and
  the general public. For better or for worse, society has become
  vastly more homogeneous.

  This breakdown of distinctions between realms of information has
  not, however, been translated very effectively into the academic
  world.  Despite recent trends to valorize "interdisciplinarity,"
  academic knowledge is still deeply divided by discipline.  This
  division is not simply a matter of differences in terminology,
  stocks of factual knowledge, or objects of analysis.  As Kuhn has
  argued, it is a matter of differences in shared premises or
  "paradigms."

  What Herbert Simons (1990) has called "the rhetorical turn" in the
  study of disciplinary knowledge put these differences into a
  rhetorical perspective by applying the rhetorical concept of
  "commonplaces."  In Aristotle's rhetorical scheme, speakers could
  reference two different types of inventional resources.  The first,
  the "special topics," referred to the specialized knowledge that
  characterizes a particular discipline.  A political argument, for
  instance, would be based on special knowledge of subjects such as
  war and peace, national defense, imports and exports, etc.  For
  Aristotle, however, these realms of specialized knowledge were far
  less interesting than the more philosophical "general" or
  "universal" topics such as magnitude, degree, and time.  These
  topics are the foundation of basic logical principles that any
  trained speaker can use to mold the minutiae of the special topics
  and the individual facts of the case into a well-formed deductive
  argument.
                                                             [l. 237]

  The Roman name for these topoi, the _loci communes_ or
  "commonplaces," captures the sense in which rhetoricians thought of
  them as metaphorical locations in which ideas were stored and to
  which a speaker could go for the materials of argument.  Rhetorical
  analysis of modern academic texts suggests that modern disciplines
  are not just divided by different stocks of knowledge of "special
  topics."  Rather, they are divided by different kinds of arguments
  which are unique the discourse of each discipline.  McCloskey
  (1993), for instance, documents ways in which writing in the field
  of economics is not just "about" markets; it is dominated by a way
  of thinking that uses the idea of "market" as a kind of universal
  metaphor upon which all manner of arguments are based. It is a
  metaphor that anyone could use, but for those within the discourse
  community of economics, it takes on complex and deep significance.
  It becomes not just another metaphor, but a fundamental
  building-block of argument.

  Similarly, Simons (1990), Bazerman (1988) and others have argued
  that the structure of a scientific report is not just a matter of
  superficial style, but rather a complex stock of argumentative moves
  or commonplaces that serve to reinforce and reproduce a view of the
  world that characterizes the discipline of science.  In short, the
  *common* topics have become, in their way, as specialized as the
  *special* topics.

  The relative homogeneity of the ancient commonplaces can be seen as
  a holdover from the old oral world, a world which, as Ong documents,
  took many centuries to lose its grip on human consciousness.  The
  deeply divided commonplaces of modern disciplines arose as
  face-to-face communication and print communication increasingly
  diverged after the Renaissance.  This divergence created disciplines
  with different back stage and different front stage information
  systems.

  These staging areas are separated, following Meyrowitz' argument, by
  physical space in the one case and typographic space in the other.
  It is only partially a fanciful pun to equate this sense of "place"
  as separate stocks of argumentative resources with the literal
  "places" -- faculty coffee lounges, academic conferences,
  specialized journals -- which allow discourses to proceed within
  disciplines without significant interaction with other disciplines.

  To return to my original question:  why has this distinction
  persisted in academic knowledge when electronic media have broken
  down most social distinctions based on separate information systems?
  Clearly, there is no "middle stage" area in the academic disciplines
  that corresponds to television.  Television, a dramatic medium
  ideally suited both to entertainment and the maintenance of popular
  culture through reproduction of mythic structures, is totally
  unsuited to the complex arguments that typify academic knowledge.
  Academic knowledge remains, not just print oriented, but dependent
  on a complex interaction between face-to-face interaction and print.
                                                             [l. 291]
  The academic conference is a case in point.  Scholars go to great
  lengths to meet face-to-face, despite the fact that the main "front
  stage" activity of most conferences is the bizarre academic habit of
  reading papers at one another.  Why don't scholars fax their papers
  to each other and save money and fossil fuels?  They don't because
  they also value the back stage personal conversations that flesh out
  the front stage activity with meaningful social interchange.  My
  point is that both of these social settings are bounded information
  systems distinguished by what journal one publishes in, what
  department one works in, what hallways one frequents.  Without a
  "middle stage" area equivalent to television, the academy has
  remained remarkably resistant to the relative homogeneity celebrated
  (McLuhan) or lamented (Postman) in the everyday social world.

  Information technology has the potential to bring about profound
  changes in intellectual knowledge because it can provide this middle
  stage area, an area in which the "specialized" commonplaces of
  disciplinary discourse can no longer maintain their separateness.
  It is obvious that most electronic interchanges of information are
  relatively independent of physical geography.  But it is not the
  ease with which one can exchange e-mail with a colleague in Tokyo
  that makes networked information interchange so different from
  previous media.  The difference hinges on the fact that, although
  networked information interchange tends to be spontaneously
  organized into quasi-social "networlds" in a variety of manners --
  the people with whom one regularly corresponds, the listserves,
  newsgroups and ejournals one subscribes to (see for instance Harasim
  1993) -- these virtual worlds of electronic interchange are
  notoriously leaky.

  The reason is that the cross-disciplinary contacts that occur in
  cyberspace do not happen in clearly demarcated front stage or back
  stage regions.  In one sense, e-mail and related modes of
  communication are analogous to face-to-face (back stage)
  conversation, while more formal refereed electronic publishing is
  analogous to print (front stage) behaviour. Yet both of these forms
  are essentially textual in nature.  They use exactly the same tools
  of both reading and writing, and frequently one only knows whether
  one is reading a refereed journal or an unmoderated discussion list
  by carefully inspecting the masthead (if it has not irretrievably
  scrolled off the screen).  Unlike traditional staging areas, they
  are marked off only by the social interactions that people choose to
  perform there, not by any systematic closure of an information
  system marked by spatial or textual boundaries.

  Shoshana Zuboff (1988) has documented the immediate and striking
  effect that even a simple interoffice conference system has on an
  organization.  In a close ethnographic analysis of a company she
  calls "DrugCorp," she shows how the installation of an electronic
  conferencing system almost immediately gave employees a more
  universal view of the company's operations.  They felt integrated
  into a larger whole, not just specialized parts of an industrial-
  age machine.  Most important, knowledge began to be organized by
  relevance to the task at hand rather than by department.  For
  instance, when a researcher in the R & D division encountered a
  problem, he did not go to other R & D people; rather, he entered a
  message into a conference organized by general subject --
  mathematics and statistics -- and received varying answers from
  across the company.  "With that," writes Zuboff, "he not only was
  able to solve his problem but also felt that he had learned even
  more  about the software package from analysing the differences
  between these  answers" (367).
                                                            [l. 354]
  Hypertext increases further the interconnectivity of network space.
  As Bolter (1992) points out, print indexing techniques emphasise the
  systematic retrieval of information within domains of knowledge.
  They are inherently hierarchical, emphasising categories and
  subcategories of knowledge.  Network space can also be organized
  hierarchically, but the more natural structure of hypertext is a
  network rather than a tree structure.  The World Wide Web elevates
  hypertext to a global level, offering the possibility of freely
  structured connections among documents whose geographical location
  and whose disciplinary placement are more or less irrelevant.

  Nothing in these communications structures necessarily compels
  people to begin recognizing and using the commonplaces of other
  discourse communities rather than developing highly specialized
  lines of argument.  Discourse communities have a tendency to be
  self-perpetuating, as people generally feel more comfortable and at
  home talking to their own kind and thus tend to reproduce genre
  distinctions spontaneously.  A glance at the groups that naturally
  form at any large cocktail party will immediately confirm this.
  Threats to established territorial boundaries can also manifest
  themselves in reactionary decisions at the management and government
  level.  The interconnectedness that Zuboff noted in DrugCorp, for
  instance, was rapidly destroyed by a management fearful of the new
  order of uncontrolled information that it had unleashed.
                                                            [l. 379]
  However, the power of the "bias of communication" (to use Innis's
  term) lies not in what it compels so much as in what it makes easy.
  Indexing, for instance was always possible in a manuscript society,
  but the labour of producing systematic indexes for one-off
  manuscripts whose pagination inevitably varied from that of other
  copies was simply too great to make the concept viable.  Once print
  technology made this communications structure easy, it became a
  standard feature of any academic work.  Likewise, interdisciplinary
  contact and the rise of more shared commonplaces is no less probable
  because it is not compelled.  By breaking down distinctions among
  information systems, the middle stage space of information
  technology makes the development of isolated stocks of commonplaces
  so much more difficult, and interchange among these commonplaces so
  much easier, that only the most powerfully organized
  countermovements can even slow it down.

  This is not to say that greater use of information technology will
  necessarily result in the complete breakdown of disciplinary boxes.
  Nor would it necessarily be good if it were to do so.  Kuhn
  characterises "pre- paradigmatic" knowledge as a chaos of competing
  premises and non-cumulative tinkering; we have no idea what
  "post-paradigmatic" knowledge might look like, for we have never had
  truly non-disciplinary academic knowledge of a modern variety.  It
  is not entirely clear whether the complexity and depth of current
  disciplinary thought could exist without those very Disciplines to
  provide a matrix of development; certainly the idea of achieving a
  unification of knowledge at the expense of taking on the bland
  uniformity of television is not an appealing thought.

  There is no need, however, to push the television analogy this far.
  Information technology may be capable of dissolving some of the
  acute differences between fields of study by breaking down the
  geographic and textual barriers between them, without giving rise to
  the warm grey soup of McLuhan's "mythic" wholeness and unity.  This
  would be interdisciplinarity in Good and Roberts' (1993) sense of a
  meeting of expertise from various disciplines in order to solve
  common problems, rather than a non- disciplinarity analogous to the
  merging of everyday social spheres described by Meyrowitz. [l. 417]

  The residually textual nature of information technology may be
  sufficient to allow academic fields of knowledge to remake
  themselves into more integrated spheres of knowledge rather than
  melt down into total "mythic unity."  As noted earlier, television
  is a fundamentally dramatic and narrative medium unsuited for
  abstract linear thought or high degrees of specialization.
  Electronic information interchange, on the other hand, is
  fundamentally symbolic, requiring if anything a greater rather than
  lesser degree of ability to process abstractions than does print
  (Zuboff 1988).  This fundamentally abstract nature of the medium may
  serve to preserve a degree of specialization and disciplinary
  situatedness because it will maintain at least some of the
  characteristics of print that have been credited with the creation
  of the modern noetic world.

  However, writing histories of the future is always a dangerous
  business.  Despite the current explosion of the "information highway"
  version of the rhetoric of the technological sublime, information
  technology is so new and still so marginal in terms of academic
  publishing that only the very leading edges of its effects can be
  glimpsed.  Thorough rhetorical analysis of electronic texts as they
  become more dominant may allow us to track shifts in the
  disciplinary commonplaces that Simons, McCloskey and others have
  shown us. But in the meantime, McLuhanesque pattern-watching may
  give us at least some idea of what we might be looking for.

  EDITORIAL COMMENT

  Archiving electronic periodicals involves issues --  permanence,
  integrity, linking, citation, even copyright -- that won't become
  stale for a long time.  _EJournal_'s stance in the meantime is as
  follows:

  Copyright - on the principle that many creators are more interested
  in sharing and serving than in making money with their work (or in
  turning that benefit of possession over to others), we insist that
  no one may "own" _EJournal_.  Wherever you find it, take and use it.

  Citation - After some confusing experiments, we have settled on
  consecutivity (issue numbers) within calendar years (volume
  numbers).  Although the month of mailing also appears near the top
  of each issue, there may be more than one mailing in the same month,
  so that's not a unique identifier.  We provide where-to-find-it line
  numbers near the beginning, and incidental line numbers every few
  screens throughout so that accurate citation and recall of
  references are not too difficult.

  Linking - It could be argued that line numbers will be made
  irrelevant by full-text searching and html links.  One could
  imagine, that is, linking reference notes directly to citations,
  instead of just pointing to them.  Perhaps we'll be able to find
  what we're looking for  by asking for string matches -- or color or
  shape or waveform matches.  But that's a distant ideal.  Despite our
  interest in testing the default boundaries imposed by paper-based
  conventions, _EJournal_ will stick for now with the "page" or
  "space" orientation of the codex technologies.

  Integrity - If we are to be useful in the evolution of the network
  culture (in what may prove to have been its "self-organization"),
  _EJournal_ has to be "dependable" within the traditions of codex
  reliability.  Much as we may *discuss* the ephemerality and
  transformability of pixel-based display, that is, we have to prevent
  suspicion that the record might have been tampered with.  Therefore
  we have a Fileserv that contains read-only "originals" of each
  issue.  In case there are questions about later "copies," there will
  be a place to find what every issue looked like on mailing day.  We
  do NOT make changes, even of outdated e-mail addresses.

  Permanence - What good are policies about integrity if the whole
  record disappears?  Floppy disks and regular backup from a hard
  drive are not enough to assure perpetuity.  Maintenance has to be
  institutionalized.  In our case, _EJournal_'s Fileserv is backed by
  the institutional momentum of the State University of New York.
  There are procedures for backup and provisions for continuity that
  should make _EJournal_ as "permanent" as anything on paper.  To be
  sure, our great grandparents assumed that paper was as "permanent"
  as anyone would ever need, and latent acidity has shown once more
  that widely held assumptions aren't always correct.  Something could
  go wrong with the procedures we assume will work.  But we have taken
  responsible, reasonable precautions to preserve _EJournal_.

  These comments are triggered by developments in ways to find
  _EJournal_.  Hanover College, thanks to John Ahrens, has been
  archiving us for some time.  We haven't made a big thing of that
  because the full text of every issue is distributed to everyone who
  has expressed an interest, by subscribing, in what we do.  Now,
  however, as Jennifer Wyman prepares html markup for every issue, and
  as Albany's Library begins to archive us, and as Peter He wonders
  about inter-issue cross-referencing and indexing, we are thinking
  more and more about our availablity to people who might be
  interested in _EJournal_, or a particular issue, but are not
  subscribers.  The presence of different *electronic* versions in
  different *electronic* places allows the suspicion that they are
  different from the originals.  So it is important to know that the
  original issues, unmodified, will be always available in our Bitnet
  Fileserv (or its instituional successor) by way of the Listserv
  command (or its equivalent) GET EJRNL VxNx.


  _EJournal_ is now available from two sources, at least, other than
  the Bitnet Fileserv at Albany.

  Our first gopher site was and is at Hanover College, thanks to John
  Ahrens -
        at Hanover - /public/ftp/pub/ejournal

  We are also available from the University at Albany's Library gopher,
  thanks to Peter He -
        at Albany(SUNY) - /service.../...libraries/electronic/EJournal

  Furthermore, Jennifer Wyman has marked up back issues in html.  The
  URL isn't quite set yet, but we're getting close.

  We'd appreciate suggestions from readers about access to _EJournal_,
  as well as reports about your successful (or frustrating) gophering.
  Also, we had a question recently about indexing: Is _EJournal_
  indexed anywhere in the reference literature?  If you know that we
  are, would you let us know where?  Thanks.

  About "Supplements":

  _EJournal_ continues to experiment with ways of revising, responding
  to, reworking, or even retracting the texts we publish.  Authors who
  want to address a subject already broached --by others or by
  themselves-- may send texts for us to consider publishing as a
  Supplement issue.  Proposed supplements will not go through as
  thorough an editorial review process as the essays they annotate.

  About _EJournal_:

  _EJournal_ is an all-electronic, e-mail delivered, peer-reviewed,
  academic periodical.  We are particularly interested in theory and
  practice surrounding the creation, transmission, storage,
  interpretation, alteration and replication of electronic "text" -
  broadly defined.  We are also interested in the broader social,
  psychological, literary, economic and pedagogical implications of
  computer- mediated networks.  The journal's essays are delivered
  free to Internet addressees.  Recipients may make paper
  copies; _EJournal_ will provide authenticated paper copy from our
  read-only archive when it is needed.

  Writers who think their texts might be appreciated by _EJournal_'s
  audience are invited to forward files to EJOURNAL@ALBANY.edu .  If
  you are wondering about starting to write a piece for to us, feel
  free to ask if it sounds appropriate.  There are no "styling"
  guidelines; we try to be a little more direct and lively than many
  paper publications, and considerably less hasty and ephemeral than
  most postings to unreviewed electronic spaces.  Essays in the vicinity
  of 5000 words fit our format well.  We read ASCII; we look forward to
  experimenting with other transmission and display formats and
  protocols.
