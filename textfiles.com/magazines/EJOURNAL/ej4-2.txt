A ROLE FOR LIBRARIES IN ELECTRONIC PUBLICATION                        [line 68]

  ABSTRACT: This is a proposal for direct involvement of libraries in
  the publication of scholarly journals.  The issues discussed are
  money, standards, copyright and access, and the roles of
  individuals.  The goal is a managed transition to electronic
  publication which does not sacrifice quality and is within current
  budgetary constraints.

THE PROBLEMS                                                                  
                                                                             
  Journal subscription costs have been rising rapidly and have
  absorbed all movable resources in many libraries.  Subscriptions are
  being cancelled, and access to scholars has been reduced.  Even so,
  shelves are filling rapidly.  Knowledge continues to grow, and more
  outlets are needed, not fewer.  Miraculously, a solution seems at
  hand: electronic communication is cheap, fast, and accessible. 
  Electronic journals seem a wonderful solution: pay less, get more. 
  Unfortunately serious problems with access, quality control, and
  financing have held up development of this medium.  The first
  experimental offerings by commercial publishers are unattractive in
  several ways: they restrict access; some of them shift traditional
  library functions (e.g., archiving) to the publishers; and there are
  no indications that they will be much cheaper.  At the other extreme,
  preprint data bases and homebrew journals have sprung up on the
  network.  These are free, but have problems with stability, quality
  control, visibility, and acceptance.  It is not at all obvious how
  these disparate interests and forces will eventually come together.

  One approach to electronic journals is to simply wait and see what
  happens.  No doubt a satisfactory system will eventually evolve,
  much as paper journals evolved.  But there are strong motivations
  for implementing a consciously designed system, if a satisfactory
  one can be found.  First, evolution is slow and expensive, and the
  library crisis is here now.  Second, there are serious concerns that
  pressures from preprint databases and electronic journals, on top of
  financial problems, will cause a collapse of paper publication
  before a replacement is ready.  Third, evolution involves trying
  different systems and weeding out the ones which don't work.  But
  the failures will pollute the literature and impose a burden on the
  scholarly enterprise at a time when efficiency and effectiveness are
  more important than ever.                                          [line 113]

  Finally, important features of the current system are simplicity,
  credibility, and inertia.  Scholars write to high standards and
  submit to a relatively rigorous editing and refereeing process
  because the options are simple: do that or don't get published; they
  are used to the system; and they accept this discipline because they
  believe everyone else does, and everybody gains from it.  An
  unmanaged transition will lose much of this.  It will be complex,
  will have to earn its own credibility, and will have widely
  accessible outlets for substandard work.  No doubt some areas will
  manage to keep high standards, but many will not, and there will be
  a net decline in quality.  A key goal in a managed transition is not
  just to find a system that works, but also transfer the credibility
  and acceptance of the current system to the new one.

THE IDEA

  The basic idea is that every research library should publish
  electronic scholarly journals.  However the terms "publish" and
  "journal" need clarification, and "why libraries?" needs an answer. 
  We give a first pass here, and add detail in the following sections.

  First, "publish": this would mean permanently maintaining a file of
  reviewed and edited papers, freely accessible over the electronic
  network.  It would also mean managing the editorial structure (see
  "Standards") to maintain standards.  It need not involve editorial
  work, keyboarding, file formatting, etc.  These, to the extent they
  are done, could be the responsibility of editors and authors.

  Next, "journal": this is a repository for primary scholarly work. In
  the beginning it should look like a paper journal, except for
  format.  Some additions might be made, for instance attaching to
  each paper a list of errata, and forward citations approved by the
  editor.  But at present real experiments with the electronic medium
  should be left to the secondary literature, to preserve the
  credibility of the process. 

  This scenario does not address the secondary literature: texts,
  review and survey books, encyclopedias, many monographs, etc.  The
  basic structure for dealing with these does not seem to be in
  immediate trouble, so we can afford to let them evolve.  Technical
  issues such as file standards, formats, and access modes are also
  not addressed here.  These vary from field to field, and information
  should be available from professional societies.                    [line 157]

  Finally, "why libraries?": first, to maintain standards (and
  credibility) editors must be accountable to someone.  Now they are
  usually directly accountable to publishers, and indirectly to
  librarians who decide whether or not to subscribe to the journal. 
  Ideally, publishers would continue in this role, but most are
  unlikely to adopt policies which would make this possible (see
  "Money").  So it makes sense for librarians to move forward a few
  steps in the quality-control chain.  The other reason is, to quote
  the bank robber, "that's where the money is."  Most scholarly
  journals are primarily supported by library subscriptions, paid from
  monies earmarked for the support of scholarly information needs.  It
  is not realistic to expect new sources of support, nor is it
  realistic to hope that library subscription budgets can be shifted
  elsewhere for this.  So research libraries are nearly the only
  places professionally managed electronic journals can be supported.

STANDARDS

  The greatest problem is maintenance of standards of correctness and
  quality of exposition.  Not only to ensure that the material
  published is of good quality, but to provide ways for readers,
  authors, and librarians to be assured of this.

  The key to quality is, of course, the editor or editorial board. 
  But it is not satisfactory to rely on the reputation of the editor
  as a gauge of quality.  Librarians and readers often do not have
  information about reputations.  There are not enough people with
  appropriate reputations who are willing to do editorial work.  And
  it is unstable: a change of editors might significantly change the
  quality of the journal.

  For a journal to have a reputation (and existence) separate from
  that of the editor, the editor must be accountable to someone.  In
  this proposal that person would be a librarian.  Files for the
  journal would be maintained in the library.  This would address
  important concerns about security and permanence, but the main point
  here is that it provides a mechanism for accountability.  In an
  extreme situation, analogous to the firing of an editor by a
  publisher, the librarian could deny write access to the file.       [line 197]

  In most instances librarians do not have the expertise to monitor
  the standards of a journal, or even the qualifications of editors. 
  Further, they would lack the feedback (and discipline) that
  publishers get from subscription levels.  There are several ways to
  get expert advice, and distribute the responsibility for monitoring. 
  One is to have a "board of trustees" of recognized experts.  The
  editor would serve "at the pleasure" of the trustees: they appoint
  new editors and would have the authority to remove an editor if
  necessary.  Trustees would meet periodically--say yearly--for a
  report from the editor and to review standards and policy.  Since
  trustees would not be directly involved in editorial work it should
  be much easier to recruit eminent trustees than eminent editors. 
  And listing the names of trustees as well as editors would allow
  readers to use the trustees' reputations as guides to quality of the
  journal. 

  Another possibility for accountability is that a department could
  sponsor a journal: "The Wobegone Journal of Irony, published under
  the auspices of the Wobegone University Department of Ironical
  Studies, G. Kellor editor."  Care should be taken to ensure it is
  not a vanity journal for the department.  Finally, professional
  societies might respond to the electronic confusion by establishing
  accreditation boards for journals.  This would amount to a partial
  centralization of the "trustee" function. 

  There is actually not much new in this.  Editors of commercial
  journals are accountable to the publisher, and people often use the
  publisher as a guide to quality of the journal.  Professional
  societies usually have committees of de facto trustees to oversee
  editors of society journals.  The "trustee" mechanism for ensuring
  quality and stability is used by universities and major
  corporations.  And Universities, physicians, and barbers are subject
  to accreditation or licensing.  The only novelty is the location of
  the person to whom the editor would be accountable.

  It should be emphasized that the `standards' issues of concern here
  are correctness, reliability, and quality of exposition.  Importance
  or interest are not involved.  The first reason for this is that
  boring but correct and well-exposed work does not damage the
  integrity of the literature, and may eventually be useful to
  someone.  The other reason is that we already have a satisfactory
  way to grade papers according to interest: a large array of journals
  with varying degrees of specialization and standards of importance. 
  Electronic publication should preserve this diversity, and not be
  just one huge database.  What we largely do not have now
  (particularly in the sciences), and don't want to have, are large
  numbers of journals which vary significantly in two dimensions:
  standards of correctness as well as significance.                   [line 246]

MONEY

  Electronic journals based in libraries would lack most of the
  obvious expenses of paper journals: printing, mailing, bookkeeping
  costs associated with subscriptions, and publisher profit. 
  Keyboarding costs can be shifted to authors by requesting submission
  in standard file formats, and assessing page charges otherwise. 
  Copyediting can be abandoned, or reserved for extreme cases.  Most
  editors and reviewers of scholarly journals are already unpaid.  But
  some expenses would remain, and there might be new ones.  If a
  journal has trustees it would be appropriate to at least help pay
  their travel expenses to meetings with the editors.  A reasonable
  guess is that costs could be held to about 20% of the current
  levels. 

  In support of this guess I would like to relate my own experiences
  as editor.  In 1991-92 expenses charged to my publisher were $1,300
  for postage and some secretarial support.  Postage costs have
  declined since then due to a nearly complete change to electronic
  mail.  During this time 154 papers were processed, and about 40
  accepted for publication.  Most authors provided useable electronic
  files.  Keyboarding services for the remainder were readily
  available locally, but I expect offering these services to authors
  at cost would have increased the number of author-prepared files to
  near 100%.  I would have wanted to support the keyboarding of a few
  third-world submissions.  There was essentially no copyediting: most
  rewriting involved technical issues and was done by the author.  In
  cases of linguistic difficulty it was usually effective to suggest
  seeking help from a colleague.  This experience leads me to believe
  I could have delivered complete electronic files for this journal--
  lacking professional polish, to be sure, but completely usable-- for
  about $2,000. 

  Many economies are also available to commercial publishers.  We
  could stay with publishers and avoid this whole scenario if they
  would seriously address the cost and access issues.  For example, by
  offering scholarly journals electronically, with minimal
  restrictions on use, at 25% the current price.  Less generous terms
  would just continue a process which will lead to the collapse of
  commercial journal publication.  In some fields this collapse is
  nearly certain within ten years, and possible within five.         [line 288]

  Expenses of library publication must be borne by the publishing
  institution.  Attempts to shift them to users will meet with the
  same problems of access and collection which make commercial
  electronic publication unattractive.  Shifting expenses to other
  departments in the institution would create conflicts of interest,
  and might create vanity presses.  Also the money isn't there.  But
  in research libraries these expenses would not be new, or unrelated
  to the mission.  These costs are already borne through subscription
  charges.  It will cost more to publish an electronic journal than to
  subscribe to a paper one.  But the proper perspective is that each
  library-published journal saves the community of research libraries
  80%.  If a small fraction of subscription budgets were diverted to
  direct publication, the result would be a huge increase of easily
  accessible material.  And movement of a small fraction of existing
  journals into libraries would even render cancellations unnecessary
  for such a diversion. 

COPYRIGHT AND ACCESS

  Copyrights are currently used primarily to protect the revenue
  stream of publishers.  Library-based journals could be much more
  relaxed about this.  It would make sense to allow the copying of
  entire articles, with the original citation, in any medium for any
  purpose.  Other libraries might want to load them into their own
  archives, for instance to speed up searches.  Any user should be
  able to download and print them.  The local copy store or library
  could download and print copies for the electronically
  disadvantaged.  They could be included in specialized reprint
  collections, and accessible through commercial databases.  In short
  they should have all the functionality that preprint databases do. 
  The only remaining functions of copyrights would seem to be to
  provide legal recourse in cases of plagiarism, and to avoid having
  individual authors imposing restrictions on access. 

  Commercial publishers who want to retain a journal presence will
  also have to relax about access.  For instance, back issues over two
  or three years old probably should be freely accessible over
  networks from any library.  There is really not much benefit to
  "protecting" back issues, and it would be onerous to libraries and
  unattractive to authors and users.  The general principle is that
  functionality must be as close as possible to that of preprint
  databases: they are now the competition.                            [line 331]

WHAT YOU CAN DO

  If you are a librarian: work toward having someone in the library
  (with experience and integrity) designated as the "publisher." 
  Develop (if you do not have) the ability to access electronic
  journals and print out copies as needed.  Develop the capacity to
  securely maintain on-line journal files.  Make known your
  willingness to take on electronic journals, but insist on visible
  quality control through some mechanism like trustees: do not create
  a vanity press.  Cancel subscriptions to provide resources for this
  (this will cause temporary inconvenience, but is easily justified). 
  And work toward having this accepted in the library community as a
  professional responsibility rather than an option.  This is a
  community problem, and requires a community response: it will go
  very slowly if everyone waits for Harvard to do it all. 

  If you are a commercial publisher: if you can bring yourself to do
  it, slash costs and offer journals electronically with the freest
  possible access, at 25% of list price.  Offer unprofitable or
  marginal journals "free to a good home" in a library.  And shift
  your offerings toward monographs.  The end result of this scenario
  is that libraries will service their journal needs with a fraction
  of the current budget.  But a great deal of this budget was
  kidnapped from monograph budgets and would return there if freed. 
  Monograph sales can be expected to increase substantially, and
  should be safe well into the next century.  In the short run this
  scenario offers lower profits than toughing it out until the
  collapse.  The advantages are control over the transition and a
  graceful exit which will minimize damage to the disciplines you
  service. 

  If you are an institutional administrator: encourage your library to
  participate vigorously.  Encourage your University Press (if you
  have one) to transfer its journals to the library.  Encourage
  subscription cancellations, or provide bridge funding to support
  these journals until similar transfers elsewhere generate savings to
  pay for them.  This transition will help with several very pressing
  problems (information access, library budgets and space shortfalls). 
  Vigorous and concerted action will bring relief rapidly.           [line 371]

  If you are an editor: encourage your publisher to participate
  voluntarily in this transition.  Explore the possibility of moving
  to a library.  You should be prepared to offer a visible
  accountability system, for instance by recruiting eminent scholars
  or previous editors to serve as trustees.  This will substantially
  increase the confidence of authors and readers in a smooth
  transition. 

  If you are a scholar: seriously consider publishing your work in a
  library-based journal, if you are satisfied an appropriate chain of
  accountability is in place.  Your work will probably appear more
  quickly, and may be far more accessible to most of the profession. 
  If you are thinking about starting a journal, approach your library
  (or someone else's library).  But be prepared to address the
  accountability issue.  And be aware that electronic publication does
  not avoid many of the problems of starting a journal.  In
  particular, gaining acceptance and having an impact still requires
  recruiting outstanding papers for the first few issues, and
  establishing high standards. 

SUMMARY

  Change is coming, forced by rising production of knowledge and
  falling library budgets, and enabled by electronic communication. 
  Left to itself the transition will be chaotic and damaging.  A
  controlled transition has been described which would serve the needs
  of scholarship within current budgets and without sacrificing
  quality.  The major features are a shift of primary journal
  publication to research libraries, and concentration of commercial
  publishers on texts and monographs.

ELECTRONIC JOURNALS:  NEITHER FREE NOR EASY                         [line 417]

  My perspective on questions of publishing, archiving and accessing
  electronic journals is that of someone who trained as an
  information scientist, has worked for most of the last 25 years for
  not-for-profit learned-society publishers, and is now a research
  fellow in electronic publishing in a university information &
  library studies department.  My impression is that much of the
  continuing debate actually has little to do with the paper versus
  electronic issue. It is in fact quite an old controversy that
  predates the computer, and reflects the animosities that often exist
  between academics, librarians and publishers -- with the publishers
  being, on the whole, the people that everyone else loves to hate.

  Academics have long wanted to control their own publication system,
  and initially did so.  Scholarly journals were edited by academics
  in their spare time and published by university presses or learned
  societies.  If any full-time staff worked on them, they were
  relatively low-status people very much in an "editorial assistant"
  position.  Nor, indeed, did academics hold librarians in very much
  higher esteem, and although today academic librarians usually do
  formally have academic-related status, they and their skills still
  are not always respected by academics.  The substantial departmental
  library at one of Britain's most prestigious university departments
  --the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge-- for example employs no
  qualified library staff at all, not even a paraprofessional; the
  physicists run it themselves.  I believe that there is a romantic
  idea that if only academics did the whole job themselves, as they
  did in some golden era in the past, then scholarly communication
  would be quicker, cheaper and more effective than it is with these
  various professional intermediaries --publishers, subscription
  agents, librarians-- involved.

  Why, then, did the golden age pass away?  Was it just because of all
  this slow and messy business of putting ink on to paper?  I believe
  that the major reason why professionals came into the picture was
  because of the sheer quantity of scholarly material being published
  --that is, because of the growth of the scholarly community
  producing papers.  A university library of a million volumes has to
  have a staff of professional librarians.  And while a journal
  publishing 15 papers a year could be run on an "amateur" basis, one
  publishing 1500 papers a year cannot, regardless of the medium it is
  published in.  The sheer administrative load of organizing the
  input, refereeing, copyediting, formatting, and distribution of that
  many documents (including the ones that get rejected, which generate
  work too) requires full-time staff.  And since these people have to
  eat, they need a salary.  Contrary to what some participants in
  discussions of electronic journals have alleged, it is this area of
  "first-copy cost" that is responsible for most of the cover price of
  a journal, not the paper, printing, binding and postage costs.  Yes,
  a purely electronic journal is inherently somewhat cheaper than a
  paper one; but not a tiny fraction of the cost.                  [line 473]

  There is also the question of subsidy --an emotive word.  I prefer
  to put it that the costs of running a high-quality scholarly
  communication system have to be covered from somewhere.
  Traditionally, one major route by which universities subsidized
  scholarly publication was by giving their libraries funds to buy
  journals.  Controversy arose because commercial publishers, from the
  1940s onwards and led by the unlamented Robert Maxwell, realized
  that there was scope for making lots of profit here.  However,
  not-for-profit publishers --university presses and learned
  societies-- have a big presence in the scholarly publishing field
  and cannot be criticized for excessive profit-taking.  The main cost
  is simply the pay of the people who do the work.  Of course, these
  people can be (and in the case of the presently free electronic
  journals on the Internet, presumably are) subsidized in a different
  way, by the university that originates the journal paying for them. 
  But for how long?  And for how long will the network itself be
  entirely free of charge at the point of use to the academic
  community, anyway?

  Another question --raised by Frank Quinn-- is how much of the work
  done by journal staff needs doing at all?  Is copyediting necessary? 
  The existing network journals are of necessity put out in straight
  ASCII text for the most part, while paper journals that are being
  experimentally offered in dual form (paper and electronic) acquire
  their page-image bitmaps by scanning the printed pages.  The craft
  knowledge of typographers, graphic designers and even the despised
  copyeditors is not negligible.  They all serve to turn a crude,
  possibly unreadable manuscript into a publishable paper.  What an
  advance it was when Graphical User Interfaces like Windows
  replaced purely textual DOS screens --a great increase in
  user-friendliness.  In the  same way, a pleasingly designed and laid
  out printed page, written in correct  and readable English, is more
  user-friendly than a typescript (however scientifically correct) in
  poor English.  So even if no printed edition is published, I believe
  that the requirement for quality will mean that some copyediting and
  design work will need to be done by someone.                        [line 510]

  In case it is felt that I am a pure Luddite, let me finally say that
  I do believe that the networks have transformed informal academic
  communication beyond all recognition, and in particular have
  democratized the invisible college.  Whereas in the past only those
  who actually received the personal letters or phone calls, or who
  could afford to attend the international conferences, were admitted
  to the invisible college, now anyone anywhere can join discussion
  lists or computer conferences or look at bulletin boards.  This must
  be an improvement.  And formal communication should certainly be
  quicker, and somewhat cheaper.  The additional features available
  online, most notably the ability to append open peer commentary to
  papers, are very valuable too, and when the supernetworks come along
  we will be able to add multimedia features to "papers."  But we
  should not kid ourselves that this will all happen at no cost and
  without specialist staff.

  ELECTRONIC PUBLICATION AT JOHNS HOPKINS:  PROJECT MUSE           [line 542]

  In one of the first joint ventures of its kind, the Johns Hopkins 
  University Press, the Milton S. Eisenhower Library, and Homewood Academic
  Computing have joined forces to launch Project Muse, an initiative that
  enables networked electronic access to the Press's scholarly journals.
  This collaboration draws the Johns Hopkins University community together
  to move scholarly communication into the electronic age and develop an
  economic model that addresses rising costs and diminishing budgets.
 
  The first phase of the project, completed in February 1994, is a freely
  accessible prototype consisting of current issues of Configurations, MLN
  (Modern Language Notes), and ELH (English Literary History).  The fully
  formatted text of these journals is now available on the Internet via
  online access to the library's server (http://muse.mse.jhu.edu).  Features
  include subject, title, and author indexes; instant hypertext links to
  tables of contents, endnotes and illustrations; Boolean searches of text
  and tables of contents; and voice and textual annotations.  Several
  members of the scholarly community at Johns Hopkins have already used this
  resource, and one professor describes it as "an intelligent, incredibly
  easy system to use . . . an actual research tool."
 
  The prototype is accessed through a networked hypermedia information
  retrieval system known as the World Wide Web (WWW).  It can be viewed and
  searched using any of a number of freely available WWW readers, but runs
  optimally under the Mosaic reader developed by the National Center for
  Supercomputing Applications.  Users of Mosaic can annotate text, record
  paths taken during online sessions, download text for printing, and create
  "hot lists" of frequently accessed documents.  Mosaic readers are
  available for a variety of operating systems, including Unix, Mac, and
  Windows machines.  Users of the prototype may send comments and
  suggestions with the online form provided in the prototype or via regular
  e-mail (ejournal@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu).

  The short-range goals of Project Muse, which the prototype enables us to
  achieve, are the creation of an easy-to-use electronic-journal environment
  with searching and multimedia features that cannot be duplicated in print,
  and the collection of data on amounts and types of usage for an access and
  costing model.  Long-range goals are to offer reasonably priced electronic
  journals to university libraries and to use online technology to make
  works of scholarship more widely available within individual university
  communities.                                                        [line 587]
 
  If funding for capital costs can be raised, the project team aims to mount
  about forty of the Press's journals in math, the humanities, and the
  social sciences.  These issues will appear on a prepublication basis and
  will be available electronically a few weeks in advance of the printed
  version.  Beyond developing a prototype, Project Muse has enabled the
  university press, the library, and the computing center to engage in a
  meaningful dialogue about the current state of the scholarly communication
  process. We believe that this dialogue will not only influence the final
  appearance, price, and distribution method of the Press's online journals,
  but the shape of scholarly publishing in the information age.

ELECTRONIC PUBLICATION AT MIT                                        [line 607]

  Beginning in late summer 1994 we will begin publishing a
  peer-reviewed electronic  journal called _Chicago Journal of
  Theoretical Computer Science_.  With the  same attention to
  peer-review and editorial quality that the Press applies to its
  twenty-eight print journals, we believe this journal will be
  important to the scholarly community for several reasons.  It

* provides high-quality, backed by a standard publisher
* incorporates the advantages of the electronic medium that scholars
need
* gives librarians an electronic publication purchasable by standard
subscription procedures, accompanied by liberal use-guidelines
consistent with its electronic form of publication; it is available
through vendors
* is committed to inclusion in traditional indexing and abstracting
services
* is committed to archiving by agreement with the MIT Libraries and a
back-up archive

  We anticipate publishing 15 articles in the first calendar year (the
  equivalent of a standard tri-annual publication); subscriptions
  will be available for $125 for institutions and $30 for individuals
  for a calendar year period.  Subscribers will receive a notice each
  time an article is published, and instructions on how to retrieve the
  article from the Press's FTP site.  Because of the need to transmit
  math, graphics, and symbols, articles will be available in LaTeX
  source (which is ubiquitous in the field of computer science, and
  thus preferred by individuals) and PostScript (which is preferred
  by libraries).  Hardcopy of articles will be available from MIT
  Libraries Document Services Department.

  The journal will publish peer reviewed articles describing new and
  significant research results in all areas of theoretical computer
  science.  In addition, articles will have an associated file called
  Forward Pointers that will refer to subsequent papers, results,
  improvements, etc., that are relevant to it.  These Pointers will
  change with time as conjectures stated in the paper are settled or
  new relevant results are discovered.  Insertion of Forward Pointers
  will be controlled by the editors.  Articles will also have an
  associated file of comments which will be unrefereed, unmoderated,
  and easily accessible from the article.                             [line 654]

  Subscribers will be allowed unlimited access to the articles
  published during the calendar year.  In later years, subscribers
  will be able to access the file of articles published before the
  current subscription year by paying an additional fee above their
  subscription fee.  We are considering providing electronic copies of
  articles to non-subscribers for a per-article fee.

  We are publishing this journal without difficult-to-administer
  restrictions with the assumption that librarians and individuals
  will be willing to pay for what they use.  Having paid a
  subscription price, we believe libraries should be able to use the
  journal in a way that reflects what they currently do with paper
  journals and that recognizes the differences inherent in the
  electronic medium, such as:

* store articles electronically on a library server and allow the local
community to print or download copies
* print out and store articles on library shelves
* print out articles and allow users to take them from the library
* print out articles and store them on reserve if requested by a professor
* print out articles and share them with other libraries under standard
interlibary loan procedures
* place articles on a campus network for access by local users
* convert articles to another medium (i.e. microfilm/fiche/CD) for storage

  Individual subscribers will be able to:

* store articles on their personal computer
* download and retain a paper copy of the article
* convert the files to another program
* perform reasonable format conversions

  The journal will be archived by agreement with the MIT Libraries and 
  Information Systems department.  A back-up archive site has been set
  as  Scholarly Communications Project, Virginia Polytechnic Institute
  and State University. Paper copies of individual articles will be
  available to non-subscribers from MIT Libraries Document Services.  [line 692]

  We are anxious to see if a model such as this one is viable. We
  believe it has the potential to meet the needs of the scholarly
  academic community, librarians, and publishers.  Obviously, how it
  is received in the market will be the true test.  We'll see if
  scholars are willing to submit articles to such a publication.  We'll
  see if enough librarians are willing to buy an electronic journal to
  support its cost.  (And there are indeed costs.)  We'll see if
  individuals are willing to support the cost of providing such
  publication outlets for their field.  (There are no "page" charges
  for this journal.)

  **  Editorial Note - This issue and VPIEJ-L                        [line 713]

  The essays and announcements in this issue appeared originally on a
  Listserv List about electronic journals based at Virginia
  Polytechnic Institute and called VPIEJ-L.  We think the essays'
  mixtures of good sense, lucidity and pertinence to "the implications
  of electronic networks and texts" made them apt candidates for an
  issue of _EJournal_, and we are grateful to Frank Quinn, Fytton
  Rowland, Susanna Pathak, and Janet Fisher for letting us edit and
  re-"print" their texts.
                          ==========

  **  Editorial Comment -  Electronic Journals and Speed

  When _EJournal_'s first issue was published in March of 1991, one of
  our goals was to minimize the time from submission through
  peer-review to publication.  Our April issue was the best example so
  far of how fast we *can* move.  

  Professor Holland sent us a proposal, with an outline, on 16
  December 1993.  Two consultants recommended that we encourage
  development of the essay.  "Eliza..." actually arrived on 25
  February, was sent to readers (without authorial identification) on
  10 March, and was accepted (with suggestions for revision) on 22
  March.  That was the slow part of the process.

  A revised version arrived on 28 March.  5 messages about details
  were exchanged before a formatted version of the issue was sent to
  Florida on 31 March, in case Professor Holland had last-minute
  copy-editing corrections or other suggestions to make.  The "Eliza
  Meets the Postmodern" issue was e-mailed on 10 April 1994.  That's
  114 days from *proposal* to publication.  

  Three points about the process:

  1)  Most important: Professor Holland delivered.  Our questions were
  sometimes answered within an hour; the essay (and revision) arrived
  promptly; the text was clean.                                    [line 750]

  2)  The readers were prompt (and virtually unanimous).  Editorial
  acceptance wasn't delayed by negotiations, in other words.

  3)  Several steps of the process happened at a time --during spring
  break-- when we in Albany could act and respond swiftly. 

  Observation:  E-mail does indeed speed up the publication process,
  but what really matters --still-- is the people involved.

  Within a week of distribution we received four responses.  One was
  almost a "cancel my subscription" snort, one questioned the
  thoroughness and reliability of our editorial procedures, one
  promised a measured disagreement (since received), and one was a
  quick but lengthy inquiry that we hope will become a publishable
  response.  So we are working on a "Supplement" issue of _EJournal_,
  one that will further illustrate response time in the Matrix.
                       	==========

  ** Editorial Note - Electronic Journals and Libraries

  In the December, 1992 issue of _EJournal_ [V2N4], Ms. Meta Reid
  conducted a survey about electronic journals and libraries.  Of the
  respondents who identified themselves, 55 were professors and 19
  were students.  Librarians numbered 34.  And fifty of the 
  respondents reported that they worked outside "the academy."  

  I conclude from Ms. Reid's "Results" that electronic journals are
  not yet thought to be as respected as paper-based journals, but that
  their readers believe they will become more important.  The
  respondents agree that electronic journals "may be useful in
  reducing costs of publishing, storing and making available technical 
  information."

  We were pleased that Ms. Reid chose to ask actual readers of an
  electronic journal about the medium, and we're grateful to her for
  sharing her "Results."
  			==========
  	
  ** Editorial Note - Fewer Subscribers?

  Readers may have noticed an apparent drop in the number of
  subscribers.  The change is ambiguous.  We removed more than 400
  "nobody home" addresses from our Listserv list after V4N1 was
  mailed, and have had many people subscribe since then.

About "Supplements":                                                 

_EJournal_ is experimenting with ways of revising, responding to, reworking, or
even retracting the texts we publish.  Authors who want to address a subject
already broached --by others or by themselves-- may send texts for us to
consider publishing as a Supplement issue.  Proposed supplements will not go
through as thorough an editorial review process as the essays they annotate.

About _EJournal_:

   _EJournal_ is an all-electronic, e-mail delivered, peer-reviewed,
   academic periodical.  We are particularly interested in theory and
   practice surrounding the creation, transmission, storage,
   interpretation, alteration and replication of electronic "text" -
   broadly defined.  We are also interested in the broader social,
   psychological, literary, economic and pedagogical implications of
   computer-mediated networks.  The journal's essays are delivered
   free to Bitnet/ Internet addressees.  Recipients may make
   paper copies; _EJournal_ will provide authenticated paper copy from
   our read-only archive for use by academic deans or others.  

Writers who think their texts might be appreciated by _EJournal_'s audience are
invited to forward files to EJOURNAL@ALBANY.bitnet .  If you are wondering 
about starting to write a piece for to us, feel free to ask if it sounds 
appropriate.  There are no "styling" guidelines; we try to be a little more
direct and lively than many paper publications, and considerably less hasty and
ephemeral than most postings to unreviewed electronic spaces.  Essays in the
vicinity of 5000 words fit our format well.  We read ASCII; we look forward to
experimenting with other transmission and display formats and protocols. 
                                                                       [l. 848]
