  1: The COMPUTER is (an integral part of) the SYSTEM against which
  WE write.  [Please take a look, now, at note [*] on line 651.]

  The problem of characterizing "the computer" as both a constituent
  part of "the media" and an emergent artistic medium continues to
  engage critical attention.  In _Radical Artifice: writing poetry in
  the age of media_, the poet and critic Majorie Perloff goes so far
  as to suggest that contemporary "poetic discourse defines itself as
  that which can violate the system."  At this point in her argument
  "the system" refers to the computer-based, "inaccessible system
  core that increasingly controls discourse"; "the formulaic On/Off,
  Yes/No, Save/Delete dialectic of computer-speak." [1]  However, this
  system is also, for Perloff, a metonym for the media writ large.

  Poetic writing aims to violate the systems of both computer and
  media, but without touching certain of the tools provided by these
  systems themselves -- in particular without pressing what Perloff
  calls "the Reveal Code key."  That would be a self-limiting option,
  merely "selected" from the formulaic "control-key" offerings of
  the computer.  Instead, poetic discourse aims "to 'reveal' that
  which falls, so to speak, between the control-key cracks."  [2]

  This part of an explanation of "how a poem [by Charles Bernstein]
  means" -- and just one turn in the course of many interesting
  arguments throughout an extensive book -- relies heavily on a prose
  investigation of computer-as-medium, chiefly for video games, also
  by Bernstein. [3]  His piece singles out "invariance, accuracy, and
  synchronicity" as qualities of information processing by computers
  which contrast sharply with those which "generally characterize"
  such processing by humans.  He also points to a particular quality
  of computing in words which Perloff quotes, "the on-ness of the
  computer is alien to any sort of relation we have with people or
  things or nature, which are always and ever possibly present, but
  can't be toggled on and off in anything like this peculiar way." [4]

  The categorical simplicity of on/off, yes/no, save/delete, 1/0; the
  power to "shut-down" (virtual) relationships; invariance, accuracy,
  and synchronicity in the service of command and control -- this is a
  sinister, tyrannical conjunction and potential focus for Romantic
  disaffection which blossoms forth in subversive, linguistically
  innovative writing.  But Bernstein is aware of the "Romantic
  nonsense" which might be read into his analysis of the "inaccessible
  system core."  He nonetheless insists, quite rightly, on underlining
  the historical origins of that core complex in military funding for
  the development of computers.  "Programs and games may subvert the
  command and control nature of computers, but they can never fully
  transcend their disturbing, even ominous, origins."  That
  transcendental task must, presumably, be left to the poet.
                                                            [line 103]

  2: INVARIANT inACCURATE SYSTEMS never sleep SYNCHRONICally.

  Both these pieces were published in 1991, since when the world has
  changed.  It is beginning to dawn on us -- system developers have
  always known it -- that invariance, accuracy and synchronicity are
  ideals of computational information processing which never have
  been, and never will be, attained; that computers -- as their
  Networked instantiation: as the Matrix -- are never turned off;
  that systems have no essential "core," inaccessible or otherwise.

  As the operations of the computer become ever-more profoundly
  involved with even our most intimate activities, we imagine that
  they have acquired their share, however insignificant, of our own
  characteristics.  In fact, they have always been compromised by such
  qualities.  They do not function perfectly.  Not even the hardware
  works with absolute invariance and accuracy, let alone with
  synchronicity.  As for firmware and software -- we write it.  It
  pretends our ideals and exhibits our failings.  Certainly, computers
  have performed a range of functions -- command and control,
  accounting, database management, word processing -- in a manner
  which has radically influenced, not to say confused, our
  understanding of what they are and how they behave.  But now, as
  they play out our chaotic fantasies over the sleepless matrix of
  cyberspace, we encounter their "humanity" daily -- failures,
  diseases, perversions -- and not mere simulacra of such phenomena,
  but "real" inscriptions of our creative and destructive activities
  on the surface of a complex medium.  As real as poetry.
                                                          [line 132]
  3: The COMPUTER is not (a part of) THE MEDIA.  The COMPUTER allows
  for the COMPOSITION of an indeterminate number of potential MEDIA.

  These contrasting views of the "computer" and its characteristics
  arise in part because of a long-standing failure to distinguish
  between the "computer" *per se* and "computer-plus-software", or
  "computer-plus-code" (the code hidden under Perloff's "Reveal"
  key).  There is a tendency to speak as if the computer *itself* is a
  part of the media and a potential artistic medium.  But the computer
  itself is not even a machine.  It is the quintessential programmable
  proto-machine.  Without code, it does nothing.  With appropriate
  software and peripherals it can be made to do or control anything.
  Until recently, computers have participated in the media as badly
  designed typewriter-cum-calculator-cum-filing-cabinet-cum-TVs
  running a limited range of software, hacked together to perform the
  command and control, accounting, management and bureaucratic
  functions already passed over.

  However, with other software "the computer" becomes an entirely
  different kind of medium, or rather a vast unbounded and
  indeterminate set of potential media.  Computers (for which read:
  "networks of linked computers programmed to exchange information
  resources") have a new meaning as media, now that the Internet has
  reached a critical mass.  Their more recognizably human
  characteristics become more noticeable.  Even in the field of
  writing, new media are emerging: the development of the now-familiar
  link-node hypertext of the Web (globally), and a range of
  "authoring" packages (locally), means that the combination of
  computer-plus-hypertext-software will become a flexible and
  seductive literary medium, to which more and more new writers will
  turn.

  4: FAMILIARITY breeds CONTEMPT.  INTIMACY inspires MYSTIFICATION.

  The very intimacy of the functions now performed by these systems
  encourages a tendency to mystify their inner workings, and to
  indulge a Romantic *ressentiment* when faced with their outward
  manifestations -- their "commands," their "controls" and our
  "programmed" responses.  Other machines have functions which are
  clearly delineated by their physical form, by "programming" which
  is structurally and often visibly built into them.  You may not be
  able to repair the engine or transmission of your car, but you can
  lift the hood and see a complex structure which is, appreciably, of
  human scale and manufacture, and which some other person like
  yourself might well be able to understand and repair.  But the
  computer is a shape-shifter.  Its engineering evolves beneath your
  fingers in a world too small to see, while before your eyes the
  system's functions change.  One minute, it is a typewriter, the next
  a fax machine, the next it's "your personal accountant" (it
  lives!), and soon it will be helping you to read a poem, as well as
  keeping you in touch with both colleagues and lovers.
                                                          [line 184]
  Even if you had considered it before, you no longer dare press the
  "Reveal Code" key.  Not when there's a possibility that doing so
  might change your system's function in a way you hadn't predicted --
  and just as your electronic familiar was becoming so useful to you,
  so intimate with your personal and particular concerns.  Neither --
  if you do hit the key by accident -- can you relate the functions
  your computer performs to the insubstantial, language-like
  engineering which makes it all happen.

  5: Software sHifts poetIcs, iF riTers prEss: <Reveal>

  Meanwhile the extension of such software engineering to the
  manipulation of poetic texts has already been achieved and will
  continue to be developed.  John Cage's mesostics (internal acrostic
  poetry) are central to Perloff's critical text.  Cage commissioned
  software -- to assist the generation of his mesostics -- from a
  writer who has gone on to make important explorations of the
  potentials within cybertextual poetics, Jim Rosenberg. [5]  Had they
  not made actual use of computers and software, the explicitly
  procedural writings of Cage, Mac Low, Williams, Hartman/Kenner and
  others would nonetheless demand analysis that is engaged with the
  engineering of algorithms. [6]  So "even" poetry must now be
  understood as influencing and perhaps fundamentally changing the
  characteristics of computer systems as artistic media.  Poetry can
  no longer be understood simply as a (traditional) art which is
  (passively) changed or inflected by "the system."  Whether and how
  poetry subverts this system is an open question.

  In remarks published on the Net which speak to the subject of
  constructive hypertexts (those which actively construct texts with
  or without reader intervention), Rosenberg has called for the
  problematized complexity of the reader/writer relationship to allow
  for a third term: the programmer.  "What is the role of *the code*
  in setting the constructive act?  A cautious view might limit the
  role of the code to simply setting the arena for the constructive
  act, and leaving it at that.... beyond this: the code might act as a
  *coparticipant* in the constructive act....  the code is not there
  as some kind of stub to be plugged into the socket of the
  constructive act like a stopper -- in place of the reader. One
  constructs with and against and amongst the code.  But most of all
  one constructs!  Agents should be used to enrich the construction,
  not to do away with the need for it." [7]               [line 226]

  Rosenberg responds to the notion that agents of the system --
  unrevealed, encoded, virtual readers -- have been active in
  manipulating certain literary texts (plucking, say, words from James
  Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_ and fitting them into Cage's tall,
  mesostic, author-naming verses).  Such operations are sometimes seen
  as substitutes for the reader's potential activity, as control over
  her attention and response.  Rosenberg suggests rather that if we
  acknowledge these coded agents, if we read "with and against and
  amongst" them, we may enrich the constructive act of reading itself.
  But I want to focus on the fact that these agents are themselves
  constructed, and they may be authored by the writer or designer of
  both given text and its modulated form (in any particular reading or
  performance) as an integral part of the entire "work."  Writers may
  also write "with and against and amongst" the code.

  Each term of the writer/ reader/ programmer triangle is a shifter.
  Just as writer may be reader, and reader may be writer, in current
  (post-modern) critical perspectives, so either of these absent
  agents may be programmers: systematic manipulators of text and
  intertext, making use of software which has become intimate with
  poetics.  Poets and readers must become intimate with software.
  They must press the "Reveal Code" key.

  [*] Sections 6 to 8 of this essay have been software-generated by
  applying semi-aleatory collocational procedures to arguments
  extracted from the earlier sections.

  Two arguments were extracted manually from the earlier text which
  may be summarized as: "The COMPUTER is (an integral part of) the
  SYSTEM against which WE write" (thesis), and "Software sHifts
  poetIcs, iF riTers prEss: <Reveal>" (antithesis).

  Sections 6 and 7 were generated from their respective arguments
  separately.  A collocational algorithm generated phrases which were
  selected and collected by the author.  Selected phrases were also
  fed back into the given text, changing them irreversibly.  The
  altered texts from 6 and 7 were then combined and used as the given
  text for secton 8 (synthesis).

  Note that by this stage very little active selection of generated
  phrases was required by the author.  The final paragraphs of section
  8 are almost entirely generated by a simple collocational
  algorithm.  I merely split the generated paragraphs into lines.

  current state of the "Reveal Code" cybertext generator will be

  Section 9 is part of the actual working code (in HyperTalk) used to
  generate sections 6 to 8.  The variable terms have been randomly and
  systematically replaced with substantive words from sections 1 to 5

      -- any noun or adjective is allowed to replace a variable name
     containing a value; any verb is allowed to replace a procedure or
     function name --

  HyperTalk 'reserved words' have been left intact.  The code is
  working code.  (Some liberties have been taken with line breaks, to
  keep them short, but this does not affect the code's logic.)

  EDITORIAL  COMMENT  --  Spindle Those Web "Pages"          [line 749]

  In the spirit of challenging the default assumptions imposed by a
  paper-based culture, we ought to be looking for images to replace
  "Homepage."  "Web" and "'net" don't bother me, even though I prefer
  "Matrix."  But we should resist at least the "page" part of Homepage
  because electronic communication transcends the boundary conditions
  imposed by paper and ink and print, and because accepting images
  like "page" makes it hard to escape the conditions.

  Adjusting the imagery won't be easy.  The inertia is so enfolding
  that we hardly notice it.  But it will happen, and we should
  encourage the changes in vocabulary when we notice them being tried
  out.

  Why?  Vocabulary is part of what we wonder with.  As long as we
  stick with strictly papyrocentric terms, we'll be stuck inside the
  boundaries they impose.  But new terms lead to new things to think
  about.  The idea of "clicking on" something is entering the lexicon,
  and we're starting to hear "mouse" used as a verb.

  Speaking of mice, remember how happy we were with the friendliness
  of the Macintosh "desktop"?  Those familiar manila-folder icons and
  wastebaskets seemed wonderful.  But they helped prolong dependence
  on the mental scaffolding they were leaving behind.  Now it is
  time to wean ourselves from the limitations of papyrocentrism.

  There are other examples of paper-bound mindset.  The surviving
  major word-processors were built to process "papers," not words.
  Footnotes, margins, headers and footers .... the goal of bit-mapping
  texts was to make screens look like paper.

  And WYSIWYG, of course, caters to people who prepare texts for
  printers.  Ordinary readers -- especially people who scroll through
  screens and link to digital sound and cinema as well as to text --
  we care about WYSIWYG only when condemned to produce "pages" for the
  Web.  I have found talk about *writing spaces* (instead of
  "pages") only in Bolter-aware hypertext programs like Storyspace.
  And even "writing" should be giving way, now, to "composing."
                                                            [line 788]
  SGML and its subset HTML are also paper bounded, aimed at describing
  "pages" and associated with the retrospective task of digitizing
  paper texts.  And so on.

  Constant references to "desktop publishing" reinforce the
  supposition that publishing requires paper, that computers exist to
  serve the papyrocentric culture.  We forget that "publishing" is
  just a way to make something public.  "To publish" and "to make
  paper copies" are not synonymous.

  A current example of indebtedness to print technology is the
  suggestion that we ought to have monitors that can be turned --
  physically -- between "landscape" and "portrait" positions.  We
  ought to have them, we're told, because Homepages resemble
  paperpages.  The idea does make some sense -- but, like the word
  "page" itself, it's just a retrograde adaptation.

  There's no pressure to invent new terminology right away.  Sure,
  Wiener adapted "kybernos" and Mandelbrot tells us where he got
  "fractal," but the digital revolution, although *bigger* than than
  control theory or chaos or complexity, is more gradual.  Computers
  still need paper.  Electronic communication won't *replace* printing
  any more than writing replaced talking.  The old images do make
  transitions easier; we still use "horsepower" to compare engines, we
  say "dial" when we could use "punch" or "key" for telephoning.

  On the other hand, the path is forking.  Terminology affects
  perception.  Now that the digital revolution is virtually over, and
  we winners are in a position to write the history, we should be on
  the lookout for the images that will suit the *n*-dimensional matrix
  and hypertext better than "pages" and all those other paper- and
  print-bounded words do.  I don't propose a contest, but _EJournal_
  could help circulate -- "publish" -- any post-transitional
  adaptations and neologisms its readers discover.

  About "Supplements":

  _EJournal_ continues to experiment with ways of revising, responding
  to, reworking, or even retracting the texts we publish.  Authors who
  want to address a subject already broached --by others or by
  themselves-- may send texts for us to consider publishing as a
  Supplement issue.  Proposed supplements will not go through as
  thorough an editorial review process as the essays they annotate.

  About _EJournal_:                                       [line 856]

  _EJournal_ is an all-electronic, e-mail delivered, peer-reviewed,
  academic periodical.  We are particularly interested in theory and
  practice surrounding the creation, transmission, storage,
  interpretation, alteration and replication of electronic "text" -
  and "display" - broadly defined.  We are also interested in the
  broader social, psychological, literary, economic and pedagogical
  implications of computer- mediated networks.  The journal's essays
  are delivered free to Internet addressees.  Recipients may make
  paper copies; _EJournal_ will provide authenticated paper copy from
  our read-only archive for use by academic deans or others.

  Writers who think their texts might be appreciated by _EJournal_'s
  audience are invited to forward files to  ejournal@albany.edu .  If
  you are wondering  about starting to write a piece for to us, feel
  free to ask if it sounds appropriate.  There are no "styling"
  guidelines; we try to be a little more direct and lively than many
  paper publications, and considerably less hasty and ephemeral than
  most postings to unreviewed electronic spaces.  Essays in the
  vicinity of 5000 words fit our format well.  We read ASCII; we
  continue to experiment with other transmission and display formats
  and protocols.
