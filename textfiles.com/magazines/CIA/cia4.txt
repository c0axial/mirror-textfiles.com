Nitrogen Tri-Iodide>
<><><><><><><><><><>
        This is often described as worthless, or an explosion with no 
practical application, but I tend to disagree.  This explosive when properly
used can be a devasting trigger for booby traps, etc.  Just make sure that
wherever you plant it no innocent bystanders or allies could get hit with it.
If used while still moist it takes some shock to detonate it.  You could
build a standard pipe bomb, but put some nitrogen triodide in the ends to 
detonate it.  As long as the explosive (Nitrogen Tri Iodide) is still moist
the chances of accidental detonation is slim.  (From Now on I will call 
the Nitrogen Tri-Iodide, NTI).
        To make NTI, you first need to understand that it is not wise to make
huge batches of the stuff.  I would say a quarter of a tablespoon or a half
tablespoon is enough.  Now to make it you need:
        A large bowl
        Ammonia (Strong ammonia, and no suds)
        Iodine Crystals (not the liquid, pure crystals)

Now take ten parts of ammonia and place it in the large bowl.  Now put one
part of the Iodine Crystals in the ammonia.  Leave it sit for an hour or so
and then filter out the crytals.  This is the NTI.  Be careful, this is 
shock sensitive when wet.  When it drys it will go off with the touch of a 
feather.  (Oh, I forgot to mention that the bowl is now ruined, and where 
gloves when handling the Iodine Crystals as they will stain and take about
a week to finally go away on skin.)  Where ever you set this off at will be
stained, so don't do it where you don't want stains.
        A few practical purposes for this would be to make an impact
detonated pipe bomb.  In other words make your pipe bomb.  Fill it with 
whatever your using (Dynamite, Black Powder, Mercury Fulimate, etc.).
Then add a quarter teaspoon of NTI to the explosive.  Only near the endcaps.
Make sure none is in the threads.  This would not be nice.  Then throw the 
bomb.  Make sure you make and use this while the NTI is still WET!!!  You
could make some booby traps like this, except don't throw it, leave it 
somewhere so that someone will hit it.  And if it drys, and someone finds it
when they pick it up it will go off.  Have fun and be careful.

                _____________________________
               <Construction of Fuse Assmebly>
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Materials Required:
        3/4 inch PVC pipe, 4 inch length
        3/4 inch wooden dowel, 2 inch length
        5 milimeter glass tubing
        1/8 inch wooden dowel, 1-1/2 inch length
        paraffin or candle wax
        concentrated sulfuric acid
        50% sodium chlorate and 50% sugar mixture made pasty with water
                then blotted on paper towels and dried

1. Drill a 3/16 inch hole one inch from an end of the PVC pipe.
2. Insert a length of 5 milimeter glass tubing into this hole.  The tubing
        should be flush on both sides of the pipe.

                |       |
                |       |   
                |       | ------------  PVC pipe

                |       |   
                |       |

3. Insert the 3/4 inch wooden dowel in the end of the PVC pipe (the short
        end).  Make sure the dowel is flush with the tubing.
4. Drill a 1/8 inch hole 1/2 inch from the end of the pipe and through the
        dowel also.

                |        |
                |        |

5. Insert the 1/8 inch dowel in the 1/8 inch hole for the safety pin.  This
        will hold the dowel in place.
6. Remove the 5 milimeter tubing from the PVC pipe and plug one end with
        the wax.
7. Fill the tube with concentrated sulfuric acid, and then plug the other end
        with more wax.
8. Place the tube (vial of acid) in the PVC pipe and tape in place.
9. Cut a 2 inch by 2 inch square of the chlorate paper and place it in the
        PVC pipe next to the vial.  On the side of the vial without the
        3/4 inch dowel.
The fuse assembly is finished.

                ________________________________
               <Construction of Actual Explosive>
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Materials Required:
        Empty CO2 cartridge
        3/4 inch wooden down, 1/2 inch length
        epoxy or other strong glue
        saftey fuse 2 inches in length
        flashpowder (or black powder, but flash powder works the best)
        fuse assembly 

Construction:
1. Drill a 3/32 inch hole through the 3/4 inch dowel (1/2 inch length).
2. Insert the fuse through the length of the dowel, allowing 1/4 inch on 
        one end and 1-1/4 inch on the other.
3. Epoxy fuse in place.
4. Fill CO2 cartridge with flash powder and insert the 1-1/4 inch end of fuse
        into it.
5. Use tape to secure fuse.
6. Wrap a small amount of chlorate paper around the 1/4 inch end of the fuse.
7. Place the dowel and CO2 assembly into the Chlorate Paper end of the fuse
        assembly (paper end of CO2 to paper end of fuse assembly).
8. Epoxy in place.
9. Tape the CO2 end up.

                         _________________
                        <Using the Grenade>
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Remove the safety pin.
2. Strike the large dowel on your hand.  You should hear a hissing noise.
        A small amount of smoke may leave the grenade.  This means that
        the fuse is lit.
3. Throw and take cover.  It should go off approx. 5 seconds from the time 
        you strike the dowel breaking the glass tube.


                Note: The grenade must be dowel end up when you strike it.

Concealable Zip Gun>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<><><><><><><><><><>
        This is a nice gun that can be used in assasinations.  It is made
with the following materials:
        barrel          1/4 inch inside diameter steel pipe, 4 inches long
        receiver        1/4 inch inside diameter steel pipe, 6 inches long
        firing pin &    3/16 inch stovebolt, 7-1/2 inches long--file end 
        ejector                 to rounded point
                        connector to join pipes
                        rubber band cut from old inner tube
                        tape
                        
        Connect the pipes with the connector (threaded ends) so that they can
be separated at anytime.  Cut a rubber band from an old bike innertube.  
Strap this on the 6 inch pipe end.  Then file the stovebolt end to a point.
Insert the stovebolt in the 6 inch pipe end and put the rubber band over the
end.  To fire, unscrew the 4 inch pipe and place the 22 shell (long, short, 
birdshot) into the pipe (bullet end first).  Screw this back on.  Now to fire
pull the stovebolt back (like a slingshot) and release it to fire.
