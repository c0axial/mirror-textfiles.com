        Hello, to all of you that acutally downloaded my last issue, thanks
for taking interest.  I don't know if this will work out or not, but I am
trying to put out one a month and am uploading to as many bbs as possible.
In this issue I will cover probably more hacking than anything, because that
is what I have really been getting into the past few weeks.  I go through
phases from phreaking, to hacking, to anarchy, etc.  Right now I am in a 
hacking/phreaking stage.  Well, thanks to those that downloaded the last one,

Misconceptions of Computer Hacking>>>>>>>>>
><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
        I am here to point out many of the misconceptions of computer
hacking.  I am astonished as to the amount of ignorance there is on the 
subject.  Many people are under the impression that we are here mainly to 
destroy, modify, and make life miserable to all computer users.  This is
obviously a lie.  Lets take a look at the Hacker Ethics in the book Hackers
by Steven Levy.
        1. Access to computers--and anything which might teach you something
        about the way the world works--should be unlimited and total.  Always
        yield to the Hands-On Imperative!

        2. All information should be free.

        3. Mistrust authority--Promote Decentralization.

        4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria
        such as degrees, age, race, or position.

        5. You can created art and beauty on a computer.

        6. Computers can change your life for the better.

Hackers also strictly believe that no information should be modified or
destroyed.  If you wish to change something, make sure it is easily detected
and fixed.  Then only do it if it will make the system better or inform 
people about their system.
        ex. Once I heard of a hacker who logged onto a system "illegally" and
        put an user specific logon screen on the system.  It read:
                Hello <Name>, I see that your password is <password>.
                You should consider the password "Carriage Return" instead,
                as this helps promote Free Information.

No damage was done, the only problem was that anyone in the room saw the
users password on the screen.  Therefore all the users changed their
passwords.  And the System Operator had a small ten minute task to do, 
removing the message.  It demonstrated that the security system was week.
A smart sysop would have added more security or taken the messages advice
and gotten rid of the security all together.  This would work.
     ex. ITS (Incompatible Time-sharing System) was written for the PDP-6
     back in the sixties at MIT (Mass. Institute of Technology).  It was
     a system that allowed full access to any user file by any user.  It 
     also supported no passwords and was more user friendly than any other
     system in use that day.  It had up to date technology in the
     programming.  Any user could enter a command to find out who else was
     online and could even get their screen on their terminal to watch what
     they were doing.  The purpose, to simulate the old effect of everyone
     crowding around one terminal.  Their was also a command called Kill 
     System, which would Kill the System.  The idea was to take the fun out
     of crashing the system and the above mentioned features took the fun
     out of hacking into other peoples files.  Now all information in that
     particular computer was FREE!!  Users could also modify the code of the
     system.  This added to it and soon it became the best system around at
     the time, with every user working on it a little bit at a time.  Making 
     improvements, it grew.  Yet no one crashed the system and files weren't 
     lost.  Why, because that required no skill on this system.  People turned
     to more productive things like improving the system, because this
     required skill.

So obviously the hacker ethic makes things better and we do no harm.  It is
against hacker ethics and morales to crash a system, let lose a virus, or 
damage a system in any other way.  
        Now, here are some of the misconceptions of hacking by the general
population.  I will not mention names here and am in no way putting down
this fine student who does quite well in school and is overall an intelligent
and caring person.  This is a list of the fallacies in his research project
on hacking.  His thesis is to prove that hacking should be illegal.
        1. He defines hacking as follows:
                Computer hacking - the process of using a computer with a 
                modem and connecting to another computer with a modem, then
                breaking passwords, in search of information and services
                [electronic trespasing], and/or make trouble.

        2. He says the following about cyperpunks, computer enthusiasts, and
        hackers:
                Most work in gangs and gave secret code names to identify
                themselves.

                No girl cyperpunks, computer entusiasts, or hackers.

                Many come from broken homes or have pyschological problems.

        3. He does define the Hacker Ethic correctly though.  He defines it
        as follows:
                Hacker Ethic - It is ok to search, but never destroy.

        4. We never transmit viruses as he says.
        5. We don't delete hard drives neither, unless of course they're ours.
        6. Yeah we crack passwords, and copy info., but only for educational
        purposes.

The common betrayal of hackers as Charles Manson with a computer is totally
bogus and a stereotype made by the mass media of today's world.  I myself
don't come from a broken home and many of us have no pyschological problems. 
Unless searching for information is considered a problem.  And of course, we
all know that hackers do not discriminate.  There have been female hackers.  
And what he calls gangs, I don't have a clue as to what he means.  Yet, we
make no trouble, we delete no files, we don't damage a thing, and we don't 
crash systems and upload viruses.  Yes, I know how to write destructive
programs, but I don't use them.  I merely posess the knowledge, I don't use
it for any reason.  This illustrates the common misconception of hackers
and other computer enthusiasts.  Lets be glad he didn't include phreakers in
the paper too.

Tips for the New Hacker>>>>>>>>>>
<><><><><><><><><><><><>
        Hopefully this will become a regular section in CIA magazine.  In it
you will find tips and hints for the new hacker.  I know when I was starting
I loved finding files on New Hacker Hints.  Well, on with the premiere of
this section.
        This is a long list of tips to avoid being caught, some include 
"hacker ethics".
        
        1. Don't ever maliciously hack into a system.  Do no damage and
        don't delete or modify files unless neccesary to cover your tracks.

        2. Don't give out your voice phone number.  Many famous phreaks or
        hackers have turned Narc when they got busted.  If it gives them a
        chance they may turn you in.

        3. Don't attempt to hack into Military or Government computers.  They
        will almost definately bust you as they have all the time, money, and
        resources in the world.

        4. Don't use codes from your house.  You WILL almost always get
        busted.  Most PBX/950/800 have ANI and will trace you.  

        5. Don't ever rat out someone.  It will come back to you later.

        6. Use only your own codes, never one given to you by anyone.  They
        are almost always overused.  

        7. Be paranoid.  Use a encryption program to encode all the files on
        your computer.  Don't keep written notes.  If you must write something
        down, burn it when your done.  The fed's do trash, just like us. 

        8. If you get busted don't say anything.  Refuse to speak without a 
        lawyer.

        9. If the police arrive at your house with a warrant.  Look it over
        and know what they can and can't do.  If they try something they can't
        do, stop them.

        10. Try not to hack off your own line.  Splice your neighboors, or 
        call from a fortress phone.  If you hack long enough you'll sooner
        or later get ANI'd.  And Packet Switched Networks aren't entirely
        safe.

        11. Make it tough to track you.  Bounce the call off several outdials.
        If your on a PSN (Packet Switched Network) go through several pads,
        before you reach your destination.  It will make more trouble for the
        investigators and make it easier for you to get away.

That's all for this issue. More info next time.  For all of you interested in
a data encryption program, I can mail one to you (Shareware) and one other
(PC Magazine, batch/asm routine) on the same disk.  Cost is only $4.00.
