Hydrochloric Acid Is Amazing>>>>>>>>>>>>>
><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
        Does anyone know all the great things you can use hydrochloric acid
for.  Well I do and I'm gonna tell you all about it, because it is so much
fun.  Well take a cup, bottle, or can and pour some hydrochloric acid in it.
This stuff is also known as Muriatic Acid and you can get it at a hardware
store.  Just tell them your cleaning your patio!!  Now take some alluminum
foil and roll some little balls out of it.  Drop them in the acid and get
back.  It will bubble and produce a gas, which isn't fun to breathe in.  It
hurts if ya do!!  Don't do it in the house.  Now for added fun, build a bomb
out of it.  Just take a two liter coke bottle.  Pour acid in it till it
is about half full.  Drop in about 30 to 40 marble sized alluminum balls.  Cap 
it tight and get back!!  This mutha throws acid everywhere when it blows, so 
stand back.  the more alluminum the better cuz it makes the gas faster and
there is a better chance it will blow.  If there isn't enough alluminum it
will just make the bottle expand and become a really weird shape.  So lots of
alluminum and lots of acid.  You can make tear gas bombs too.  Just take a 
plastic bottle with a cap, or a glass bottle with a cap.  Fill it half full 
of acid.  Poke a small hole in the cap (half the size of a pencil) and drop
in alot of marble sized alluminum balls.  Then cap it and throw it.  It looks
like a tear gas bomb.  Anyone breathing in the gas will definately move cuz 
it hurts your lungs so bad!!  If you are doing it in the grass or dirt or 
carpet, used the glass bottle, but if it is on the road or somewhere where
glass would break, use plastic or metal!!  Well, that's it.

<><><><><><><><><><><>
Homemade Bazooka Tube>>>>>>>>>>
<><><><><><><><><><><>
        A homemade bazooka tube can be made quite simply.  Firsy you need an
alluminum tube that is 6 feet long and about 1 inch in diameter.  You will 
also need:
        1 End cap for alluminum tube
        1 6 volt lantern battery
        1 electrical pushbutton switch
        two wooden dowels 2 inches in diameter
        wire
        2 alligator clips
        tape

        Now take the alluminum tube and mark off two feet from each end.
Take the wooden dowels and cut grooves in them to fit the tube.  These are
handles.  Secure them to the tube at the two foot marks.  So one of them
is two feet from one end and the other is two feet from the other end.  
Now tape the battery about three inches behind the first handle.  Tape the
pushbutton switch on the front of the back handle.  If you are right handed
tape a nail sticking out of the left hand side of the tube on the front end,
this will serve as a sight.  If you are left handed the sight goes on the
opposite side.  Now wire one terminal on the battery to one terminal on the
switch, wire the other terminal on the switch to an alligator clip.  Make 
sure the wire with the alligator clip will reach the back of the tube.  Now
wire the other terminal on the battery to the other alligator clip again 
making sure it will reach the back of the tube.  So now it should look like
this:

                      *************************************************A

 o nail               *                                                  *

                  |                    handle (swith on front)
                  handle

 *=wire         A=alligator clip

Next you need to cap the end of the tube from which you load the bazooka.  
This can be done with an end cap, just solder it right on.  Then take some
form of cutters and cut off the top of the tube, for a distance of 6 inches,
starting one inch from the end cap.  
        Now to make shells for your bazooka you need:
                Estes "T" mini rocket engines.  
                3   1/4" x 1/16" x 9" Balsa Fins
                Nose cone
                Estes solar igniter
First, glue the fins on the rocket engine so they are evenly spaced.  Then
glue the nose cone on the end without a nozzle.  Then install the ingniter
as instructed in the engine and igniter instructions and hook one alligator
clip to each wire of the igniter.  Slide the shell in the bazzooka through 
the loading breech in the end (where you cut off the top).  Hold steady.
Aim.  Press the button to fire.  If it didn't fire, check the igniter and 
see if it went off.  If it did, use another igniter.  If not, check your 
wiring.  You need to hold the button down until the engine fires.
        This will have a range of 100 yards to 1000 feet.  You could
increase this by using larger engines and a larger diameter tube.  Next issue
we will discuss explosive warheads!!!

Improvement on the Basic Pipe Cannon>>>>>>>>>>>
><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
        Well, my good friend Pyro Master Flash and I were shooting our pipe
cannons that I wrote an article on in an earlier issue.  The whole damn pipe
exploded.  His endcap now has a hole in the back of it.  We have come to the
conclusion that steel pipe just ain't strong enough to handle the pressures
involved in firing.  Another problem is something to use as a backstop.  We
are at a loss for what to use.  You need to have the endcap against 
something that won't move.  This keeps the cannon from flying backwards, or 
into the ground as mine did the first time I fired it.  The kick on these 
babies is strong.  Then you need something to strap the cannon down so that
it doesn't flip back when it is stopped by the backstop.  We have been 
putting the endcap against my house.  Then we set a cinder block on the 
cannon to hold it down.  It keeps it down, but the cinder block always breaks
into about ten pieces.  Some of which fly 20 feet.  So we use huge fuses.  
But I have come up with a new idea!!! (Drum roll please).  First get a metal
pot.  Then somehow secure your cannon in this pot so that the endcap is not 
touching the bottom, and the cannon is in the center.  Make sure that the 
end of the cannon that the bullets come out of is perfectly level with the 
opening of the pot.  Oh, I forgot to mention that you need to drill a hole in 
the endcap and the metal pot at the same place and put a small steel pipe 
(like 1/16" in diameter) in both holes so that it connects them.  The end cap
has to be on extremely tight and the fuse passage way must be totally air 
tight at both the cannon fuse hole and the pot fuse hole.  Then turn upright
and fill around the cannon with melted lead.  The pipe will keep the fuse 
hole clear.  Wait for the lead to dry.  You could try just pouring in the 
lead and then drilling the fuse hole through the pot, lead, and pipe.  To
fire you just put the fuse in the fuse hole.  Use a long fuse, cuz it's 
gotta go through all the lead and then be about 1/2" in the powder.  Make 
sure that about 2 or 3 inches of fuse is sticking out of the cannon.  Now 
pour in your gunpowder.  Then ram about 4 or 5 tissues in the cannon. Pack
them extremely tight.  Then put your projectile in the cannon, then one more
tisse.  Then aim and light.  Give it a good backstop.  This is so big and
heavy I don't think you'll have to worry about strapping it to the ground.
I haven't tested this design yet.

Bongs>>>>>
<><><>
        I'm sorry, I couldn't resist putting a section on pot in this issue.
I'm gonna have an article every issue now about drugs.  Pot, acid, etc.
Cool huh?
        Well in this issue I'm gonna tell you how to make a water bong. 
Not like most water bongs, this one has two chambers.  Neat isn't it.
Here is what you'll need:
        Two 2 liter coke bottles with cap for one
        Two foot long pieces of rubber tubing
        Bowl
        Lighter
        Weed!!!!

Alright.  First use the lighter to soften the plastic about 6 inches from
the bottom of one of the coke bottles.  Make a small hole there and push the
tubing through it on an angle.  It should reach the bottom.  Now heat the
plastic again about a foot from the bottom on the opposite side of the first 
coke bottle.  Push the other tubing through about one inch.  Then heat the
plastic on the second bottle about 6 inches from the bottom.  Push the other
end of the second tubing into this hole to the bottom of the bottle.  Cap the
first  bottle.  Put a bowl on the end of the tube sticking out of the first 
bottle.  Make sure everything is air tight.  Fill both bottles with water. 
Make sure the water doesn't reach the upper tube in the first bottle.  Cap 
the first bottle again.  Poke another hole in the first bottle even with the
hole for the upper tube, on the opposite side.  Now to use.  Make sure you
always use fresh water, or you could never empty the water and drink it some
time.  Might get you high.  Now place your weed in the bowl.  Place your 
finger on the hole you made with no tube.  Place your mouth on the top of the
second coke bottle (so you can suck in air).  Light the bowl, suck in.  Don't
worry about holding it in unless you got some smoke.  Do this till both 
chambers are full and then take your finger off the hole, and suck in real
fast till the chambers are empty and your lungs are full.  Hold it as long as
you can!!  The smoke will be well filtered and not harsh at all!!!
