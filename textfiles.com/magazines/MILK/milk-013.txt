                Ë  "Rose Tinted-Glasses" -Mendeleev  Ë

Everything is horrible, everything is dead
There is no pleasure to my life, 
I view the future with utmost dread...

I used to lie in the warm sunshine,
its rays brightening my room,
But now all I see, all around me, is doom, greatest doom

Now I sit here, in the ultraviolet rays
letting the warm sun fry me, work its most awful work upon me
Wishing for a magnifying glass to amplify me

Scorn on love, BAH to it, Scorn on life itself
My love has left me, My love has left me,
and taken my rose-tinted glasses.

She was so beautiful, she was very elegant,
With a wit and mind to match her looks,
And now I must endure her sight everytime she passes..

Lord, what pain and agony there exists for me
Yet if I had the chance to do it over, I'd do it all again.

                        Ë  "BathTime Fun" -Jamesy  Ë

Splash
I feel in the bathtub
Owch, my head
Blood trickling out all over my newly scrubbed tub
Damn you, why did you have to push me
Mother?
 
                Ë  "Christian Fundimentalist" -Mendeleev  Ë

I like to KILL
I like to eat flesh and have blood and guts hanging between my teeth!
I love the stalking of the prey
The excitement as I pounce, and
tear apart human skin and bones
I also like sacrificing small furry animals every full moon
What am I?
Muahahahhahahhah!
 
                Ë  "Why I Belong To The NRA" -Jamesy  Ë

Beauties are bathing by the beach
birds of great majesty
the shot fired from my rife;
not as pretty a sight, are they?

                Ë  "Man's Best Friend" -Mendeleev  Ë

The beautiful woman was walking down the street
Her legs the finest I've ever seen,
her body (and I am sure her mind as well) quite sharp;
Then I unleashed my doberman on her

She doesn't look too hot any more

                Ë  "Coffee Shop Talk" -Mendeleev Ë

I suck, boo-hoo
Don'tcha know it
Evil, black, loathing
I can't get over it
Please pity me.

                        Ë  "Repent" -Jamesy  Ë

Hairball, Can't get rid of it!
no matter how much I cough
I still am sentanced to the itch in my throat

                        Ë  "Consumerism" -Jamesy  Ë

Slurpy
Remember how we loved you?
Now you've been attacked.

Slush-Puppie
How DARE you embark on his terrain?
Prepare for a Duel to the Death!
You shall not withstand our barrage!

Once you think you've got us beat
you'll see the Spurpy on SALE!
Your days are numbered, Slush-Puppy
I hope you're praying, and praying hard...
For God cannot even Save you Now.

                        Ë "Calculator"  -Mendeleev  Ë

I punched in a one, and
I tried to divide it by zero, 
but my calculator wouldn't give me the answer, 
and I got really mad

I told it if it wouldn't give me the answer, 
I would smash it, and I was fair
Don't say I wasn't
I gave it another chance,

But it still gave me an error message
So I threw it against the wall
I threw it at my mommy and my daddy
Until it was dead

No one messes with me.

                Ë  "Aggressive Driving"  -Jamesy  Ë

Splat
Little mr fly just felt the rush of a lifetime!

                        Ë  "Red Pen"  -Mendeleev  Ë

My teacher uses a red pen
She used one to give me an 'F'
I got so mad, I took that fucking red pen
And rammed it through her hand

The principal yelled at me, and so did my mommy
and so did the Dean
they didn't like it,
So I took my daddy's shotgun and gave them each a third eye

There, damn bitch, I told you.

                        Ë  "Growing Up" -Jamesy  Ë

                Ë  "Summer of '93" -Mendeleev  Ë

The breeze blew in from lake Michigan
And the sun shone upon this land
When I revved up my Dodge
And ran down an evil witch masquerading as a squirrel,
who just happened to be crossing the road

The following is a real life story, not a dramatization or fictional event
So what, asshole? I am going to stalk your ass, 
and you won't fucking care whether your syndicated TV series
does well according to that blowjob Nielsen

You're gonna' fucking burn in yer own house, bastard.
Now tell me more about the alien sightings.

                Ë  "Artistic License" -Mendeleev  Ë

I came down to the main channel, and
some guy practicing to be Tipper Gore's censorship advisor
Told me what I thought was poetry,
wasn't really poetry, get a load of that

Artistic license, motherfucker.

                Ë  "ChildHood Revisited" -Mendeleev  Ë

I sit here in the night, 
haunted by a being
Blackness all around me,

I sit here in the day,
haunted by a being
Light all around me,

Nothing can make it go away,
Not my friends or my parents, not even me
I am haunted by that being, the being I call

Snuffy, the teddy bear.
The root of all evil in the universe exists in my bedroom.

                        Ë  "PowerWalkers" -Mendeleev  Ë

A mild annoyance to me, you see
Is powerwalkers, they clutter the damn street
What, you expect me to steer around them, AND

I bought myself a truck, and NOW
I run those darn powerwalkers over
Damn bitch, toldya'!

I will have 16 burgers to go
cheeseburgers, with bacon, lettuce, and tomato
On a sticky, flat, seseame-seed bun

I'll pay you $1.99, cuz that's the deal
You give me da' burgers, and
No harm comes to your kids.

See? I am the modern gangster,
my money is cholesterol, thats how
I strike fear in your hearts and minds.

                        Ë  "Orgy" -Mendeleev  Ë

Wait, is this your arm? Whose leg is this?
I'd kinda like to know who I am having carnal knowledge of
If its that fat ugly chick that jumped onto the bed at the last
minute, man, I'm outta here.

                        Ë  "Calculus" -Mendeleev  Ë

Belch the Andromeda-monsters face, and then fatalities him
by turning into a hooker, and suffocating the poor beast
between his breasts.

                        Ë  "Cold Toilet" -Mendeleev  Ë

I walk to the bathroom in the still of the night
prithee! a creaking step, I step over it
And enter the linoleum-tiled washroom, with
its king the Toilet presiding

I walk over to the toilet, and challenge it, and begin
And after I am done, exhausted 
I feel a shiver begin 
deep within me, and run through all my being

Behold, that mysterious effect, piss-shiver. Beware, and 
Be afraid, be very afraid.

     I love you from the botton of my heart
     I love you from the top of my head to the tips of my toes
     I love you so much I can't describe how much I love you

     Can we fuck now, bitch?

                Ë  "XXX Text File Revisited" -Mendeleev  Ë

I was out driving,
when I saw a hooker by the side of the road,
so of course, 
I stopped, and

Being a courteous, mannerly boy
invited her in, and quite raucously,

Wouldn't you like to know the rest?

                        Ë  "Jerry" -Jamesy  Ë

        Ë  "Newt Hunting is Illegal in November" -Mendeleev  Ë

'twas early morning when the sun sent its first ray
over the hill, exploring what it may,
in the dusk diminishing, the grasses dim

We held hands and stared over the horizon, where
the future seemed so hopeful, and a thrill seared
my limbs with a cold shiver, made me feel alive

The love between us, what a tangible thing it seemed,
its ties strong and ever-bonding
But that was before the 

errant bullet fired by a sight-impaired hunter entered the back of 
your skull, pressuring your brains out your ears, and finding its 
exit hole right over the eye where I kissed you the night before,
blood flying everywhere..

Well, don't matter now, I have a new girlfriend.

                        Ë  "Happy Thoughts" -Jamesy  Ë

Cliff Burton... You're Dead
This Band Can Rot in Hell.

                        Ë  "Ruthless" -Jamesy Ë

I feel no pain
It's stopped, the rain
I can't think strait anymore
My Mother spread on the floor.

A Sloppy job, I have done
Should have shot her with a gun
but No, I had to use the knife
Noiselessly I ended her life

Daddy isn't happy with me
Seeing Mom Lying next to me

Fuck him
