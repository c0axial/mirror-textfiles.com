A Reply To Propaganda -- Why It Sux My Cock.

1.  The Name - Propaganda Unlimited? Come on.  Cant we get a 
        Little more WaCky than that? This is a Text file 
        group, for gods' sake.  It's almost as bad as some of 
        the names of BBS's Nex has thought up....

2.  Volume/Issue System - STUPID! Like you'll ever get through 
        Volume 1.  Get real.  Lame lame lame.  Especially since
        You get files named "PU0101.txt".  Which is really lame.
        I mean, you can't get much more lame that Stupid amounts
        Of Volumes and issues... 
        "Hey, Nex, you got Volume 42 Issue 20?"
        "No, I got Volume 20 Issue 42 though!"
        Stupid.  Real Stupid.  If It Just went by Issue 
        Numbers, life would be nice and simple and happy, like 
        it was always supposed to be.

3.  The Opening Coverish-Type Thing - Sux.  anyone can do
        =================================================
        See? I just did it Now.  Pathedic.  You know what the 
        problem is? how the hell do you draw a symbol for 
        a "Propaganda Unlimited"? it's pretty hard.  Another 
        reason the name is stupid.

4. The Table Of Contents - Ok, Can't yell too much about that

5. The Staff - Only Two People Have Written Files! Yet you 
        The Staff is in Double Digits?!?! Let's Get a little
        Real Here.  First off, If You Ever Get Avocado to write
        A PU File, I'll personally Castrate you all, I have been
        trying to get her to write for over a year now damnit...
        And KING TRENT? YOU HAVE A CONVICT IN YOUR STAFF!!!
        
6. Transition Lines - More of this "====" Bullshit.  Come on.
        Even DOS Edit <The OFFICIAL Editor of MiLK> can do 
        better than that shit.

7. The Intro - You DARED to bash Obloid.  But Even that isn't 
        what annoys me the Most.  you fucking DARE to make up
        a FAKE BLaH File, of the Number 42!!!!! 42 is THE MOST
        Important BLaH File EVER WRITTEN, The Field Guide To 
        Lampreys!! BLASPHEMERS!  If I were Dante, I'd put YOU
        in Satan's Mouth Midget Caesar, And Throw Brutus and
        Cassius up in Heaven where they belong!  (Sorry Bhuufu,
        I know you're a little young to be hearing this kind of
        stuff, but damnit, your human is becoming quite a wanker
        as of late.)  And There's More! You Use the Phrase 
        "Peace, Love and Mangos"! THAT'S Brainwashing! That's 
        Like the President saying "God Be with you all" or 
        whatever the line is he says after one of his 
        speeches... that Line right there IS Propaganda, and 
        bullshit Propaganda at that.

8.  Letter From The Editor - Connie, You Butt-Flairing Faggot, 
        Of all people YOU Should Know that you wouldn't Ask
        Chessman about "Conformity Is Like Cheese", You'd Ask
        The Baron.  It was his Only BLaH file.  

9.  Let's Meat The Caesars - Oh, Come On.  Total MaDCaP Ripoff
        there, Especially Sad since Midget Caesar says he hates
        MaDCaP stuff.  The actual file isn't that amusing, 
        either.

10. Fear And Loathing in Cyberspace Part 1 - Ok, this really
        bites the big one right here.  Let's take a very well
        written BLaH file, edit it, and make it "fit the times"?
        Simply disgusting.  It's almost as if you have a lack of
        Ideas going around in that head, Connie.

11. Moving Between Places Part 1 - Not anything to orgasm over, 
        but at least it's original

12. Phreaking with DDTS - Would have been funny if they let
        Tracy write it.

13. Lunchtime in Dystropia Part 1 - Does EVERYTHING have to be 
        Part of a Series? It's evident the Dominant Writer of
        this mag is a Comic collector.  Well, This Story is a 
        Sad example of a Combination of trying to be like 
        Douglass Adams and Oregano at the same time.

14. Coming Soon - Everyone knows it's spelled WaCkyNeSS

15. Distribution - More of this ==== Bullshit

        And... Most Important of All...

16. WHERE THE FUCK IS SAFE-T-NUTZ?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!

All in All, Propaganda Unlimited is a DISASTER.  And Until The 
Potential Energy is Converted into Kinetic Energy, It will 
probably stay this way.  If I Had to draw a Chart Of The 
Progression of Tfile Groups...

                        Propaganda Unlimited


        And... MiLK is Still Alive.  So... We're More Divinely Inspired.
        Which Makes Us Better.
        When We Type We Capitalize Every Word, Making Us Yet Better.

        We Actually Use SaFe-T-NuTz.
