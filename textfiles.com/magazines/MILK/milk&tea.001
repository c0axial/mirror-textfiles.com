ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

        I've been thinking a lot lately.  I've been thinking to the point 
that it hurts to think anymore.  That's how much I've been thinking.  I've
been thinking about conversations I've once had, and conversations others 
have had.  I've been thinking about how the days get longer and the nights
get longer and the days are numbered and the nights are numbered.  I've been
thinking about the things people say to me and the things people say about 
me.  I've been thinking about the things I've said about others to others.
        
        But most of all, I've been thinking about writing.  Writing in 
general.  Why do I do this stuff?  Why am I sitting here now, writing the
first MiLK and TeA issue to be released?  Why have I spent a great deal of
the last year of my life doing things like writing these text files?  Why
does it bring me pleasure for people to read these?  It doesn't say anything
about my writing skills; anybody can write a text file.  It doesn't prove 
anything, really.  So why do I write?
        
        A better question is; why does anyone write for the public?  What 
makes others want to tell others a story?  I believe there are a few factors
involved.  Most people that write want to have power.  The power of the pen,
or in this case the power of the keyboard, is a very strong power indeed.  It
can suck people into another world; another reality.  My reality, in this 
case.  Why do I want people in my reality?  For control.  For the power I 
then gain.  Is it a lot of power?  Not necessarily.  By people reading my
fiction, it doesn't really make me any stronger of an individual.  But it 
still has the basic aspect of why I write: to gain control of other's 
thoughts. 
        
        Yes, it doesn't sound pleasant.  And it's not like this is my 
conscious reasoning for writing.  I write because I'm bored.  Or because I
feel I need to.  Or because I have people waiting for something.  I don't
write to control people.  But subconsciously, this is what writing is all 
about.  It's another power game we all play.  Overpower the teacher, you get
an A.  Overpower the BBSer, you get fame.  
        
        And that brings me to another point; what exactly is good writing?
A lot of people find stories about lampreys funny around me, but that's 
because It's a private joke that most others don't see the true hysterics
contained within.  Good writing is a writing that gains control over the most
amount of people.  This can be something simple, like "Eat Pills" by Epic, 
that is simply a satire, or "The Communist Manifesto".  Both of these 
items were written to overpower people and bring them into the author's 
reality.  However, how many people stopped taking pills because of Epic's
essay?  And how many people tried to abolish capitalism because of Marx's
writing?  I think you hear me knocking, and I think I'm coming in, and I've
got an angry mob of laborers with me.
        
        Now that I have that all down, let's focus on a happier subject;
Why does MiLK and TeA write?  Besides the obvious, that we want to gain
domination of the United States text file reading public, we write for a 
fairly simple reason: We are plagued with Graphomania.  Graphnomania is
an obsession for writing.  The reasoning behind our obsession is as follows:

        1.  We have low self-concepts, and by writing he hope to achieve
a higher form of living.  However, this is a giant misconception of ours.
Writers, though their works, end up closing themself off further from 
reality, making them selves less and less social.  By writing, we are simply
destroying ourselves. 

        2. We feel we have some sort of "message" we have to tell the world.
In actually we're just a bunch of young men and women who have no clue what
life is all about yet, and we are desperately trying to get a grasp on what
the meaning of life is.

        3. By having an audiance, we are getting attention to ourselves, 
another by-product of low self-esteem.  We're all glory hounds.  We dream
about being published someday.  In actuality, most of us won't do any better
than working at McDonald's for the rest of our lives.

        Now, since you finally know what MiLK and TeA stands for, I think
I can conclude this issue.  I hope this first issue hasn't brought you down
too much, I just wanted to let you all know, both readers and authors alike,
what you're really getting into.  It's a disease.  A disease of the mind.
There's no two ways around it.  And by the way, this should be the first and
last "serious" issue of MiLK and TeA ever put out.  Most issues will end up
being about Cheeze, or some other dairy products.  Or purhaps they will tell
us the secrets of chia pets.  We can only wait and see. 

        Thank you for reading this.  I'm sorry I wasted your time.
