  I've been looking at the moon since dusk, hoping to find some clues that may 
contradict what it so obviously tells me. Mother taught me moonreading , and 
with everything I've learned from her and experience, it seems that its going 
to be a very cold winter. Normally, I would travel away from the Unmoving 
Star to areas of warmth, but now I know I must travel in the opposite 
direction, towards it, to places of such biting cold that I am afraid that my 
fur might not protect me.

  I've seen enough. Its time to fully come awake, and get moving quickly.  I 
can hear and smell Pink Ones in the distance, and my hungry stomach tells me 
that I need to linger long enough to feed on the rich harvest of berries in 
the ravine nearby. As I arise, I disperse the bedding of leaves and twigs so 
that it can never be known that I, or any of my kind had ever been here.

  This is a beautiful place, where stands of pine mix with oak, and an 
occasional cedar, all of which seem to dance with ecstasy at the slightest 
gust of wind. The season is changing, as I can see the oak leaves starting 
to yellow, and even amidst the wondrous songs of the crickets I can hear the 
snakes slithering along searching out winter burrows. Unlike the crickets, in 
whom I can sense only a dim awareness, in the snakes I can feel an anxious 
expectancy.

  I travel down to the ravine and gorge myself with as much as I can. My 
stomach begins to growl, but I can not rest, as the Pink Ones are still 
getting closer. They are about two hours away now, and if they approach 
any closer the pain in my head, from the madness of their thoughts, will 
grow unbearable.

  Mother taught me that the Pink Ones were to be avoided at all costs, even 
though such lessons are hardly necessary among our kind, she thought it best 
to reinforce the sense of danger that they pose to us. I remember how as a 
child, before my senses were fully developed, that out of curiosity and fear, 
I would seek out and spy on them. I was amazed at how blind and deaf they 
were, and how they possessed no awareness at all, since they only 
communicated with sound. But nevertheless, they were deadly, since in the 
distant past they had done their best to destroy us. Now their menace to us 
has become more subtle, since they are not even aware of our existence. They 
carry seeds of death, which cause us to sicken and die, while they force us 
more and more apart in our efforts to avoid them.

  I remember when mother became ill, and I helped her on the long trek to the 
Place of Departure. It was a huge and labyrinthine cave that no Pink One had 
ever seen. Within it were the remains of our ancestors for thousands of 
generations. It was obvious that there was a time when our people were 
very numerous, and from the pictures on the walls of animals that no 
longer existed, mother told me of a time of ice, before the the Pink Ones 
came. She taught me how to read the pictures on the walls, from the oldest 
that portrayed how our people had crossed the ice where the Unmoving Star 
hung nearly overhead, and travelled away from it to a land where they had 
prospered and had become so numerous that they had to spread out far and 
wide simply to hear their own thoughts. Sadly, mother also taught me how to 
make the pigments so that I was able to make a picture for her, when her time 
of passing came. Which it did, within a very short time. As I drew her story, 
I broke tradition and put in a small picture of myself. For all to know I had 
existed. For in this land, I was the last of my kind. In the pictures I had 
learned of the Other Land. I knew I must travel there, never to return. 

  Enough of remembering. I must move on. In the reverie before sleep, when
my senses are the most acute, I have sensed the presence of at least one
other, but so very, very faint that I often wonder if I am imagining it.

 I travel fast, as our kind can outrun even the swift bear, and we can also 
maintain the pace for half a day. Within a short time the Pink Ones, with 
their killing sicknesses, are out of range.

  Dawn is approaching. I have travelled far and it is time to sleep. And 
dream. Of that Other One, with whom perhaps I could have a son or daughter to 
draw my story when the time of passing comes.
