        Lampreys.  LAMPREYS.  Damn the lampreys.  Thery're everywhere, and
we must watch our backs whereever we go. 

Commonly Mistaken Beliefs:

1) Lampreys are only in Water.  

        FALSE.  Lampreys can be found ANYWHERE.  In your bed, in your computer,
in your BRAIN, if you're not careful... 

2) Lampreys don't attack humans.

        FALSE.  Lampreys will latch on to anything they can.  They especially
PREFER Human flesh and blood, in fact, over that scaley garbage they find in
the water.

3) Lampreys aren't a threat to human society.

        FALSE.  Lampreys are constantly plotting new ideas and schemes on how
to take over our government and destroy us off the planet so they can live
happily on the mainland.  Beware...

4) Lampreys make great pets.

        FALSE.  Lampreys are the worst possible pet you could have.  They'll
kill any other pets you already have, and might even kill you while you sleep.

5) Spam is made out of ham products.

        FALSE.  Spam is actually Lamprey Larva, being distributed by the 
lampreys consirating against us.  Once we eat spam, the larva hatch in our
stomach and pollute the rest of our body, until we die, then they leave it in
seach of other lampreys like them.  Soon all these lampreys will start a 
coalition against all humanity.

6) Crystal Pepsi is a carbonated water and sugar drink.

        FALSE.  Crystal Pepsi is really Lamprey Urine!  Stay away from this
product as much as possible, for it is a very dangerous pollutant to take into
your body.

7) Lampreys Sleep.

        FALSE.  Lampreys are constantly awake, waiting us to fall asleep, so
they can prey upon us.

8) The Reason Lampreys have not taken over is because of our vast and strong
   Military.

        FALSE.  Lampreys could EASILY destroy the military.  the only reason
they have not taken over yet is because of Lamprey Hunters like Nyarlathotep,
and Pete.  These men keep the lampreys at bay with their magical lamprey 
hunting weapons and (more importantly) their wit.

9) Lampreys don't have sex.

        FALSE.  Lampreys are continually having intercourse, that is, when 
they're not trying to take over the planet.

10) Dolphins are the 2nd most intelligent beings on earth.

        FALSE.  The Lampreys are just a tad less intelligent than humans, and
if we're not careful, our end is near.  

        I hope these facts have helped you realize the horror our society is
plagued with.  We must learn as much as possible about these vile beats, and
keep wary about them, because if we don't, they'll be on our necks faster 
than a 300 pound, beer guzzing football fan would be on Cindy Crawford.
