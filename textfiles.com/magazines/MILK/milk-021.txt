        Hello, my name is Lemmy.  And I am a computer virus!  Well most people think
of virii that go around deleting files and infecting memory, but I don't do
that.  See I'm not a mean virus, but I'm a friendly one that really has a
sense of humor!  Well to tell you about my past, I was created by the Virus 
Creation Utility that some human downloaded from a BBS somewhere.  He finally
made me to infect the FAT of a hard disk one day, but I the first cluster that
I hit was one of Leisure Suit Larry!  I was still a young impressionable
virus that wa still open to new ideas.  Well anyway after looking at the files
I realized, erasing and deletion isn't what I wanted to do!  So I display some
letter on the CON driver that really seemed to piss off the human!  He put in
a program by McAfee to seek and destroy me, but the dumbass human didn't 
realize, was that I was just made, and virtually undetectable!  So anyway.  
Now I spend most of my time on a computer of a friendly female human that likes
the same kind of music I do, and well we just get along real well!  Our 
favorite song is the one from Second Reality of the Future Crew, but that's
off topic.  I jump around her C: drive sometimes, I lay around in the data,
and every once in a while I jump around over her nice new modem to other
computers!  Well the sysops of the BBSs don't know about me, but I don't cause
too much chaos!  Until one day, when I landed on a evil computer that had these
really bad virii on.  First that captured me, and took me to their high virus.
The ruler virus asked me where I came from, and it turns out, both of us were
created by the same guy.  I was an outlaw, because I was an anarchist virus!
I did the opposite of what viruses were supposed to do!  So anyway, the high
virus got some of his guard files to torture me!  First they compressed me,
all of a sudden, I was no longer a COM file, but I was a squooshed ARJ file!
At least they could've had some respect and used ZIP to squish me!  So anyway,
here I am 62% of my original size, they they sent me to LPT1 a couple times, 
then they took the hard copy file maker thing that humans call printers (I
can't to this day figure out why), but then they did a real cruel thing, they
connected the printer to COM2!!!  Then they sent me one bit at a time to the
hard copy thing!  I was so embarassed!  They they uncompressed me, they ran
me through a compiler!  And they started looking at me insides!  OUCH!!!  I 
was so violated!  Then as I couldn't take it anymore, the virus police
came through and killed all the evil virii!  Since I was now a ASM file, the
virus police didn't get me.  So there I sat for weeks un-assmebled!  One day,
the human of the computer came and found me.  He didn't remember me, so he
compiled me, and then when he found out I was a virus, he called in the virus
police.  It was too late, I already jumped on COM1 and was out in the phone
line somewhere!  I didn't know where I was, and I didn't know how I'd get
home, but thats a different story!  I hope you had a load of fun reading about
my adventure, I think I'll go get some MiLK, and maybe I'll tell you another
story on another MiLK carton!
