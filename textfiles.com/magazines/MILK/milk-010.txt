         Ok, writing a text file on a sugar high is a really 
fun thing to do because you get out your ideas really really 
really quickly and you tend to make really long run on 
sentances like you're talking very quickly and it's reall a 
lot of fun! ok, well, the first thing you need to do is get 
sugar. lots and lots of suger.  LOTS of suger.  after you've 
got all that suger. eat it.  eat it all in one sitting.  then 
you wait.  this is the boring part.  If you don't like 
waiting, you can always inject the sugar into your vain or 
something, but that'll leave injection marks and your parents 
will think you're doing drugs and shit which isn't fun but oh 
well it's in the name of text files right?  Ok, so you've 
waited and you've got your sugar high.  Now write!  Write as 
quickly as possible, don't bother to go back and corect 
spelling mistakes or anything, that's no fun now is it ok well 
then find a really cool topic to write about like oh i dunno 
blowing up the planet or something or maybe an ANARCHY file! 
yeah that is it! Anarchy files are just so much fun to write i 
wanna be an anarchist when i grow up wheeeee ok well make sure 
you don't correct or spell check your file because that makes 
it lose the sugar high rush feeling about it and we want to 
show that we're fucked up and such while writing the file so 
dont do that ok? cool that's how you write a suger high text 
file i hoped you liked it i gotta go masterbate seeya
