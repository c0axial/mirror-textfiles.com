Tired of everyone acting like their insane,
Pull the flesh gently away from my face, yes, like your dearest loved
one showed you.  They're so considerate, with their needle sharp
comments and razor edged glances.  No, don't share your heart with them,
the jackals they are.  Don't you realize that love is the most
destructive force known to man?  Don't you realize that she loves you?

Tired of everyone looking for affection,
Rub his stomach, yes, like you feel it is right.  Rub behind his ears
and feed him some of your slurpee.  He's brainless to the core, but he
loves you.  You look into his joyful eyes and realize what's corrupt.

Tired of everyone allways thinking,
The puppy's eyes melt, transform, mutate into hers.  There isn't
anything completely pure in them.  Her heart tells her that she loves
you, but her mind tells her that she needs more.  A tortured artist is
knocking at her door with his backwards hat and the stink of puppy love
so vile.  The old jackal is ringing the doorbell on the other side of
her mind, he wants back in.

Tired of everyone being so insignifigant,
The Universe is vast, nothing you do matters.  Everyone is thrown into
the chaos and disorder that makes up everyday life.  Millions of scared
cattle.  Cattle wandering the world with a dead look in their eyes and
lust in their heart.  Thousands of hungry sharks.  Sharks looking to get
into others, to feel their warm genitals on their own.  Sharks looking
to make others feel powerless and worthless.

Tired of everyone,
Tired of everyone complaining about their miserable lives.  The others
just listen in dead silence while thinking about their own problems.  No
one cares to hear another person's problems, only their own.  Conversing
about everything with none of it meaningful.  Everyone's different now,
they all belong to the different crowd.

Tired.
