        This is a reply to the reply of Propaganda Unlimited-- Why The 
original reply "sucked my cock".

        First off, I was pointing out the stupidest things possible trying
to "diss" this new Text file group, for the silly reason that they were, in
my eyes, a competitor with me.  Which was very stupid, becase we're both
literary groups, so there shouldn't be competition, everyone should just be
able to release what they want how they want.. Text file groups should just
be there to make sure the stuff gets distributed. 

        So I was way off in my reasoning for the Original bashing file of
Propaganda Unlimited, and I am doing the first "Veto" or "Impeachment" of
a MiLK file.  if you have a copy of MiLK File #11, Delete it.  It should not
and will not be distributed from any of the MiLK sights listed below in this
text file.  Furthermore, don't listen to any of my rantings contained in that
text file, because they were worthless and untrue.  PU happens to be a very
good text file group, with quality writers and quality topics.  Text file
groups like MiLK and PU should not compete with each OTHER, we should be
trying to lead people astray from the vile and disgusting junk that oh too
many BBSers end up reading instead of WaCky Tfiles; That's right, Anarchy 
files.  We should be working to banish the Anarchy and 3l1t3 d00d community
from our once fair WaCky realm, before it's too late...

        Here's some reasons why my original theories on PU were way off and
totally wrong:

1. One of the writers, Nyarlathotep, is also a writer for MiLK.
2. Oregano, one of the writers for PU, is someone that MiLK has been 
   attempting to get to write for them for ages, but he has refused.
3. Constantine, the editor of PU, is an original BLaH member, and everyone
   knows that MiLK is just a BLaH ripoff.
4. Newt, Katy, was a hysterical writer for PU, and her tfiles rank up there
   with the best of them.
5. PU has never tried to compete with MiLK; MiLK has always been the vengeful
   of the two; there is where I and MiLK has been wrong.  

        So, basically, this is an apology for a MiLK file that should have
never come out.
