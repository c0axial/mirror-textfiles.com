              Although most people might not understand it, nor 
      recognise it, but a walk down an old familiar path can really 
      change the rest of your life as you know it.
              Now that my friend drives, I seldomly walk to his 
      house in the middle of the night.  This night, however, he 
      wasn't really in the mood to get up and give me a ride there.  
      I had to roam to his house, which was about fifteen minutes 
      away.
              It was a cold and brisk night, but nothing like how 
      cold it can get during the Chicago winters.  There was no snow 
      to be seen on the ground, but you could still see your 
      breath.  The streetlamps and oncoming cars lit up the night.  
      As I walked down small streets and larger roads, I didn't feel 
      too different.  It wasn't until I got to my old junior high 
      school that something strange happened.
              I was noticing a rustling behind me, and I looked 
      back, but no one seemed to be there.  At first, this didn't 
      concern me much, but when I thought about how little this path 
      is traveled at night, it began to bother me.  I looked back 
      again, yet still no one could be found.  I looked forward and 
      tried to convince myself that I wasn't worrying about someone 
      perhaps following me.  I kept walking down the small path that 
      walks right down the center of the block into the fields 
      behind the junior high school.  Every day for four years 
      straight, I took this same path to Golf Junior High School.  
      Every day, it all felt the same, I'd go to school, get made 
      fun of a lot, get yelled at by teachers saying I don't fulfill 
      my 'potential', and go home an unhappy lot.  But now I found 
      myself walking towards this old school at night, in the cold, 
      something I hadn't done for years.  And I was being followed.
              I turned back again, and the sound seemed to be 
      closer.  I kept walking foward, a little faster than before.  
      I saw the opening into the big soccer fields of Gold School, 
      and the night was totally lit up by the lights of the factory 
      adjacent to the school.  Even in the middle of the night, the 
      factory was as busy as little bees, trucks scooting around and 
      making interesting noises, and smoke billowing out of the 
      large chimneys.  As I finally got to the mouth of the path, I 
      saw the school with all its lights on, like it always is at 
      night.   
              As I turned and followed the path that led right to 
      the school, I began to walk even faster, hoping when he came 
      out of the path by the trees I'd be far enough away in a wide 
      open area that I could see him clearly and safely.  But I 
      wasn't quick enough, for the sound was still gaining ground on 
      me.  It would be soon when he would catch up to me.
              I had to think fast.  I'd feel really silly If I broke 
      off running right now, because chances are this was just my 
      imagination playing tricks on me, that this was just a deer 
      taking a brisk stroll in peaceful Morton Grove.  I decided 
      once I got to the street in front of the school, I would 
      either cross the street as fast as my legs could take me, or, 
      if the traffic did not permit, I would stand my ground and 
      confront the follower.
              My luck was not with me.  When I got to the street 
      light, it was a newly turned green.  And the cars were rushing 
      by.  I had very little choice but wait and see what happens.  
      I took a deep breath as I turned around to view the oncoming 
      stranger.
              His running shoes made a slow and rather loud seeming 
      shuffle on the sidewalk in front of me.  His ruffled jeans and 
      his small, black jacket made a light friction noise as he 
      approached.  His rather long, brown hair was covering most of 
      his face, but of what I could see, his blue, no, green eyes 
      were staring directly into mine.  He had a rather large smirk 
      on his face.
              The stranger in front of me... was me.  I hardly had 
      time to react before he pulled the blade from his pocket and 
      ripped open a tear into my soul that still has not healed.  As 
      I laid there bleeding, all I thought about was sleeping, is 
      that I wanted to go to sleep, but he wouldn't even let me to 
      that.
