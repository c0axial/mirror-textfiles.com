        The cow stood there motionless, gazing down its prey.
Yes, last time it may have missed the chance of catching the
little devils, but this time, this time he shall not miss.
This time, he had a plan... he would slowly but shurely move
its way up to the enemy, and then with blazing speed show no
mercy as he catches the prey in his mouth and slowly,
painfully gnaw at the prey while the prey feels its agonizing
pain of the molars of the cow collapsing down upon them.  This
time, the cow would not fail.  It carried out its plan.
Slowly, to the onlooker you could not even tell the cow was
moving, but it was, moved its way towards the prey.  The prey
did not even see the mammoth of the cow coming at them, for
the cow was successfully deceiving the poor prey.  The cow was
in range.  It swiftly (As swiftly as a cow can..) caught the
foe in its mouth.  She had the catch! She gleefully chewed and
grazed on the fallen Prey.  As the prey bled its juices inside
the cows mouth, all that could be heard was a munching noise.
And a munching noise it was the last thing the poor blades of
grass heard.
