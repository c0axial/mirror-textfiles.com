	 The distant thunder, amplified by the tunnel and the peculiar
geometry of the cavern it led into, startled Keet, causing her to drop
the latest batch of stic that she had uncovered.  She had to hurry now,
to the surface and seal up the entrance, so that the rainwater would
not seep into this mine and do damage.  She was so proud of herself
for probably being the first to find a mine that apparently had never
been damaged by water, and its attendant rot.  Not that it could
damage stic, but she had recently developed an interest in the things
found along with it.  Some could be smelted, and others could be used
unprocessed for fuel, but she knew they had purposes other than summoning
evil, as the old ones had said.

	She grabbed the two sacks of stic, mixed with the other things,
and headed to the surface.

	As she was sealing the entrance, a boy, running home to avoid the
ensuing rains, stopped long enough to call her obscene names, which she
easily ignored, as he was at a safe distance, and out of range of a rock
throw.

	Diggers were necessary, she thought, but hated and feared. Did they
not, after all, make their living out of the excrement from the bowels of
the Evil One?  Even though the corrosion proof utensils and tools that stic
was used to make were necessary, the source was still despised. And a distant
clan with knowers had uncovered some things in their mines which required a
lot of stic, converted to liquid, to operate.

	Rumors had it they did wondrous things. Like move on their own and
make light. And that clan bartered well. She had even heard that their
knowers had passed along knowledge to all who would listen in places called
skills. And that they had repulsed attacks from some neighboring clans with
magical weapons from the Evil One. Yet the very reason they were attacked
was because they had denied the very existence of both magic, and the Evil
One. And they did not shun diggers.
	
	As she hurried home under the weight of the sacks, she had decided that
when her grandfather passed on - as had her parents and two sisters from the
Coughing Curse- she would go join that clan. At sixteen seasons, she knew she
would be able to select a fine mate amongst the knowers. And be able to
provide her own dowery from the collection  of things she had amassed from
the mines. Especially the woody-things-with-pictures that were extremely
rare, that she had just found in the new mine. Legend had it that they also
contained words, but she didn't see how. But she did hear a trader from the
knower clan ask about them once. He called them 'bux', and said he would
trade a cow for each one!

	As Keet hurried across the field she tripped over a knotted vine, and
when she hit the ground the sacks fell open, and some of those 'bux' fell
out. Dazed, she looked at the funny drawings on the top of each one that were
next to her. Strange drawings with lines and curves, that didn't look like
anything.

	 Unbeknownst to her, the drawings did have a pattern: Stedmans Medical
Dictionary, Basic Electronics, Principles of Physics, and Floral Arrangements.

	Getting to her feet, and putting them back in the sack, she smiled as
she handled the last one. It had such pretty pictures. She would demand two
cows for that one.
