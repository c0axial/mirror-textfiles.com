        The history of the Obloid Sphere (By Nyarlathotep)

        
        The history of the Obloid Sphere should probably begin with the
the history of another very influential BBS, The Halls of the Video
Warrior.  I am not sure of the early history of this board, so I will
talk of it from the time when I joined it. When I first called it (I got
the number from the Stillwaters BBS list) it was actually under the name
of The Wine Cellar, and the sysop was Ambrose Spike, cool guy. Well, this
carnation was short lived, and soon it returned to its previous name of
Halls of the Video Warrior (Hallza), with Ambrose emerging that handle
with his old handle of Dirk Gently, forming Dirkbrose Spikely.
        This was back in the days when I first started modeming really,
and for some reason I kept running across a certain guy, James Hetfeild
on every board I called. Hallza was no exception. Hallza's greatest
claim to fame was the best Neverending story base ever. And on this base
was the greatest story ever. Basically it pitted the Dirkbrose and his
cosysops in an adventure to find the Obloid Sphere in order to save the
world from some great flood or something. Jamesy and myself were both
very active in posting on this storey, and for the few weeks it lasted,
it was the greatest thing ever.
        Well, now a couple of months later, I am chatting with Jamesy on
Nuclear Greenhouse, and he mentions that he is making a board, and wants
to know if Ill call it and test it out. I say ok, and I test it out, and
play Operation Overkill ][, which I was hooked on at that time. He then
asks me if I wanted to be a co, because he wants the password of
THEFOURHORSEMEN to make sense. Ok, I say, and along with Dark Lord (now
known as Dalamar) and someone else, I begin to take my place in history.
        Sometime around Christmas Break of the 92-93 school year the
board officially goes up. At first things are slow, but certain regulars
pop up along with me Jamesy and Dork Lard. Lady Catninja, Constantine,
Jack Roberts and Oregano were some of the early users. It is around this
timt when a very good game of Trade Wars began, with the evil forces of
myself and Jamesy under Dark Lord pitted against LCN, Constantine and
the forces of good. This game didnt last too long before one of the
spheres early cycles of overhauls.
        The Sphere used to go down and get changed on what seem seemed
be almost a monthly basis way back then. I lost count somewhere around
the fourth incarnation, but Jamesy might know what the Sphere's current
incarnation is. This was annoying to some of the users, but the message
bases still were full. That was the amazing thing about the board, was
that it was basically purely a message board, one of the few in the
existance, and also the only one that I know of that has survived so
long.
        Sometime in the Summer of '93 Jamesy began his first attempt at
a textfile group, Oblo1dism, or something to that effect. This group did
not last very long, but it included the immortal work of Oregano, the
Ingestable Dog. It was also around the summer of '93 that Midget Caesar
and Jack Robert's sister joined the expanding user list, which also now
included Nex, and an occasional visit by Windrider.
        The summer of '93 is also noteworthy as it was at this time that
the Orignal BaGFeST took place. The six original BaGFeSTeRs, Oregano,
Jack Roberts, Jamesy, Midget Caesar, Count Zero and myself romped around
evanston with Bags on our heads and our spirits high. It was a success
despite the low turnout.
        Sometime after the '93-'94 school year began Jamesy started MiLK
out of the ashes of Obloidism, but thats another story. At this time I
was sort of Distant, as I was away at school. Eventually Barney's
Pleasure Palace came up in the Sphere's place. However soon after the
'93-'94 school year was over for me, the Sphere was backin its rightful
place. The summer of 94 included BaGFeST II, which was a phenomenal
success with 20 participants including all of the original 6.
        Then, at the beginning of the '94-'95 school year disaster
struck. Evil parents forced the dismantling of the Sphere, and as a side
of effect, the death of MiLK. However, you can't keep a good Sphere
down, and eventually it did rise again. And along with the Revival of
the Obloid Sphere comes the spawining of MiLK and Tea from MiLK and the
New Jersey t-file group of THo (kinda). And that is the History of the 
Obloid Sphere... for now at least.
