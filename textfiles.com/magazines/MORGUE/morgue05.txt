        Morgue Texts are in no way responsible for the effects of this
file, nor are we promoting the use of explosives. We also would like to 
stress the fact that we have released this only as a stepping stone in the 
vast road of knowledge. This is simply for learning purposes. If you kill some 
sucker, it's on your hands, not mine. But if you do kill somebody drop me some
mail and tell me about it.

               ::1.Automobile batteries use sulphuric acid in dilute form.
               ::2.To concentrate the acid, place in a glass container and
               ::  boil until white fumes are given off.
               :: CAUTIONÄTHESE FUMES ARE TOXIC!!!!!!!!!! THEY WILL KILL YOU!!
      
        
        
        
       
      
     Section II. Explosives.....
             
        
     1.NAPALM..........   
        
        
        1.Fill the bottom container of a household double-boiler with water.
        
        2.Fill one-half the top container with gasoline.
        
        3.Using ELECTRIC HEAT <Not Gas Or You Will Blow Your Fuckin Head Off>
          bring the gas to a boil.
        
        4.SLOWLY pour in pure soap flakes <Ivory Snow>.
        
        5.Stir the mixture as you pour in the flakes.
        
        6.Continue this process until the saturation point is reached.
          <If you don't know what a saturation point is, Delete this File>
        
        7.Alllow the mixture to simmer for Five minutes.
        
        8.There's your Napalm. This is a lot of Phun when you put it on
          something <Such as a Person, heheh> it will stick to them and is
          very hard to put out <So Stop,Drop,Roll just wont work, hehheh>
        
        
     2.GUN COTTON
        
         
        1.In a large beaker mix two parts by volume nitric acid with one part
          sulphuric acid.
        
        2.To this mixture add sterilized cotton; stir well!
        
        3.Pour in a small quantity of acetone until the cotton dissolves and
          white crystals are formed; these crystals are gun cotton.
     
        4.This material must be confined to achieve detonation.
        
        5.Gun cotton is supposed to be spark-sensitive, but i would use a 
          blasting cap.
        
        
     Section III. Fuses N' Detonators
        
        
     1.SLOW-BURNING FUSE
        
        
        1.Make a solution of one tablespoon potassium nitrate and one cup of
          water; place the solution in a shallow glass dish.
        
        2.Add precut lengths of string.
     
        3.Bring the solution to a boil over gentle heat; boil for three minutes
        
        4.Remove string from solution and allow to dry.
      
        5.Determine burning time by testing two sample fuses.
         
     
     2.FAST-BURNING FUSE
        
        
        1.Coat a length of string with epoxy glue.
     
        2.Roll the glue coated string in a mixture of 50 percent potassium
          nitrate and 50 percent powdered sugar; allow the glue to harden.
        
        3.Wrap the fuse in cellophane tape.
        
        4.The burning rate of the fuse can be slowed by adding a small quantity
          of finely ground sawdust to the nitrate/sugar mixture.
        
        
     3.BLASTING CAP
        
        
        1.Partially fill a bottle with explosive (bottles from model paints
          work best; the best explosive is improvised scraping the heads off
          of matches).
       
        2.Insert the fuse.
        
        3.Fill the bottle to the brim. Tamp the explosive tightly.
        
        4.Punch a small hole in the bottle cap; pull the fuse through the hole.
        
        5.Screw the bottle cap on TIGHT!!!

        6.SEAL THE FUSE HOLE WITH EPOXY GLUE!!!!
