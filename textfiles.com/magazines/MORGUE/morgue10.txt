     PHINet is a mainframe located in New York, accessable through Tymnet. It
is a database and document search-and-retrieval system designed for tax
research. If the system seems a bit boring to the hacker, then I should point
out the following information concerning costs: PHINet's connect-time prices are
based upon the accumulated hours of use per month. See chart below.

Hours/month  Peak hourly rate  Off-peak hourly rate
===========  ================  ====================
1-5          $85.00            $76.50
5-20          80.00             72.00
20-50         70.00             63.00
50+           60.00             54.00

     As you can see, if what the system can offer helps you, Then it is well
worth it to hack an account. PHINet is one of those services which you could
really use from time to time, but would never dare pay the high fees
for.

     To enable you to access PHINet, you must gain an account. I will not go
through the steps of gaining an account on a system simply because the
steps are obvious and hopefully well-known to those reading this phile.
To start you off, however, I will just say that it would be wise to
locate a person/buisness probable to use PHINet, and work a little
social engineering charm. Combined with trashing the person/buisness,
you will surely have an account in no time. The user ID is eight
characters long, and the password is four characters long.

LOGGING ON TO PHINET
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     The first thing you need to do is get your nearest Tyment dialup.
Connect to Tyment, and at the login prompt, type "ph". The
message "PRENTICE-HALL ENTER USERID;PASSOWRD:call connected" will
appear. When you get this, enter the userid number and password,
separated by a semicolon. i.e.- p000-000;wxyz. If you login sucessfully,
the News Menu will appear.

GETTING AROUND
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     PHINet is a very user-friendly system, therefore I won't have to go
into the details of many PHINet commands. The News Menu lists all of the
menu-driven databases, and an example of it is shown below:

                            PHINet NEWS MENU
1  DAY1--Daily Tax Update
2  WEEK--Compilation of previous 5 Daily Updates
3  XPRT--Experts' Briefings
4  HELP--User Assistance and Customer Support
5  RATE--Applicable Federal Interest Rates

Choose a database by selecting the respectful number. You will receive
another menu, with complete instructions on the contents and usage. The
following is information on all databases in the News Menu:

DAY1: This database contains information concerning tax news from the
      previous day.

WEEK: This database contains the previous *five* daily updates.

XPRT: This database contains briefings written by tax experts. Everyday
      a new article is featured.

HELP: This database contains a large amount of information on PHINet and
its search-and-retrieval system. This is a good area to enter because of
the command lists you can capture. They become *very* useful.

     Databases in the News Menu are not searchable. The Main Menu lists
all of the searchable databases. An example of the Main Menu is shown
below:

MENU  PHINet main menu
FED1  Federal income tax without the index
FED2  federal income tax with the index
INDX  Keyword index for federal income taxes
CASE  Tax cases 1954+
PLRS  Private letter rulings 1977+
RULE  Revenue rulings and procedures 1954+
FULL  CASE + PLRS + RULE
TOTL  FED1 + FULL (Global federal income tax search)
ESGT  Federal estate and gift taxes
EXCT  Federak excise taxes
FDEG  FED1 + ESGT
CITE  Citator 2nd series, cases and rulings 1954+
TXSP  Tax simplification proposals
IRML  Internal revenue manual
PUBS  Internal revenue service publications
SHEL  Tax shelters

ENTER DATABASE NAME:

     I think from this point on you it will be pretty easy for you to find your
way around because of its simple database form, along with its extreme user
friendliness. Part Two of this phile will continue to explore the depths
of PHINet, and possibly any letters sent to me concerning PHINet.
Happy exploring...
