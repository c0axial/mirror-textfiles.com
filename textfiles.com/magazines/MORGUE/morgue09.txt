Morgue (if I make it in) proudly presents:


How to be an instantaneous "Threat to your neighborhood"...


Ok. these are things you can do to people/school/whoever to
torture
them.

Embarrassment for All
Make the nastiest poster you can find. or get a page from Playboy
or
something.  Go to a building, public place, etc.  Use wet,
evaporated
milk to make the poster stick for a while.  A variation on this
is to
put a flag over or on top of another flag.  The classic example
of this
is documented in Phrack, issue 41... that's the fun you can have
with
That.

Another cool thing to do is, if you are on steps of a school,
building,
whatever (a cool place to do this would be a mall with a big
staircase,
is when you are at the top (make sure you are in  a big crowd or
no one
is around), take a jar of BB's and let 'em loose!  (Hey, that was
a run
on sentence)...  Speaking of which, that brings us to the next
fun
section:

-=-[<*>]-=-
Fun in School

Yeah, sure, school gets Really boring. Here are some
FUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUN things you can do at your school to
lighten
up the heavy, thick, stuffy atmosphere that covers the hellish
torture
chamber AKA the School system of the U.S.  The things mentioned
above
should work rather nicely.  Some other fun things to do are:

Make a paper airplane. Before you make it, though, write some
nasty, or
unusual slogans.  Also, you could write 'em on the wings with red
magic
marker after the plane is made. Stuff like "Bob loves you."
"XXXXXXXXXXX is Gay!" or other nice rumors... <g>...  Another
nice thing
to do (I did this! so I know how much fun it can be) is, Find out
your
school's exchange (most will have a private one ).  Anyway, after
you have it, load up good ol' Toneloc, Codethief, whatever you
use, and
SCAN AWAY!  You can find all sorts of nifty things, I found my
school's
Prime... my friend Anonymous Caller found a PBX!. the fun is
endless.
Also, you may even get to hear teacher's scream "HELLO!!!!!!!"
and laugh
at them all the way.

Fun on Phones

The telephone is not only a necessary tool, but a machine for
endless
fun.  Perhaps the most fun is red boxing from a payphone, but
that's
basic.  Crank calling is always fun, but there is More!...  One
of the
most laughable things to do is get a friend.  Make sure either
you or
him/her has three-way.  Call up someone at random (or someone you
hate)
and pretend you and your friend are DJ's at a radio station. say
"Ya
ready to win $100 in cash???" or something, sound excited. then
play a
popular song. if they say something way off, if you feel like a
laugh
anyway say "... Close... wait... the Judges WILL ACCEPT
that!!!"... I
remember one of these convos it went like this. my friend was the
dj. I
was an assistant, and there was another assistant:

DJ (right!!!): Hello. We're from Eagle 106. We are broadcasting
nation
wide tonight.  (We called Louisiana, they'll believe ANYTHING
down
there!)
DJ:... you up for $100 tonight?
Girl: ... Is this some kind of prank?
DJ: No!!!!... are you R-R-R-Ready???
Girl: Umm... Sure.
DJ: Ok. Just name this song... (he played "How Long" by
Information
society)
Me: That's enough! That's enough!
DJ: Ok. can you name that song?
Girl: No.....
DJ: O well... try this one. (he played a more popular song)
Girl: I don't know.
DJ: Ohh... that came from the movie Breakfast Club.
Girl: Oh! I saw that movie.
DJ: Then we'll give it to ya.
Me: Now. trivia time (I felt sorry for the poor victim)... What's
the
capital of Louisiana?
Girl: (excited): BattonRouge
Me: Right! that's $500!!!!!
We asked her some more questions, got the total to $550... Then.
the
real fun is. you write up a fake check like on your computer. Get
their
address (our victim spilled it out!), and Mail it to them.
imagine the
fun when they try to cash it.

Another fun thing to do is, get a few friends again. the more
friends,
the more udderly psychotic it sounds. Call a victim up.  Instead
of just
one person talking, each says a word of a sentence. it sounds
udderly
insane. one went like this.

Hello... Is... <the person we were asking for>... there? (each
word in a
different voice)
Girl:... Hello???
Us: There's... something... wrong... with... the... Phone...
Is... he...
there?
Girl: There must be --
Us: Can... you... hear... me?
Girl: Yes...
Us: Is... he... there?
Girl: No...
Us: Do... you... have... an... number? (An number??????)
Girl: No.
Us: (we all started talking)... Hello? hello (udder confusion)...
Girl: Hello?
Me: Hello???!.. I'm from... Massachusetts.
we pretended we had no idea what was going on... it was fun
watching the
girl try to figure it out.;

Well. that's about it... Thanks for reading. hope this makes it.
