*** The Morgue Text Reader! ***
CopyRight 1993 by ’SCII Express

Welcome to the Morgue Text Reader.  This program lets you read
morgue
issues.  IMPORTANT! The Morgue issues must be called MORGUE??.TXT

If you get one that you want to read and it's like MORGUE??.DAT
Just
rename it.

Command Line Switches

Morgue reader is flexible. Here are the switches you can use when
starting.

/B: Use bios writes to the screen.  This is good if you, like me,
use a
speech synthesizer and need bios writes, or if you are
multitasking,
this will make it better.
/C: Turn snow checking on.  If you have a monitor that requires
snow
checking, this turns it on.
/D<Directory>: Directory to find the MORGUE??.TXT files. for
example if
the morgue.exe is in my C:\util and the morgue files are in
C:\Morgue
I'd type

MORGUE /D\Morgue

You can specify a directory across drives, like /DD:\MORGUE or
something..

That's about it. you can specify multiple commandline options.

Have fun. call Ionic Destruction 215-722-4524 to pick up morgue
textfiles.


seeya and enjoy.
