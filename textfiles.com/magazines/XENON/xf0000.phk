                        Introduction By: Erik Turbo

             
"Yes,  we are the  men in black hats, taking advantage of your stupidity to 
gain information and  knowledge about the world around us, while the man on 
the  corner is  selling  drugs  to your  children.   While  rapists,  child 
molesters,  murders, and common thieves are taking advantage of the justice 
system,  we are protecting  what we believe in;  the freedom  to learn. You 
claim  we invade other's  privacy, while you are in the process of creating 
universal  encryption standards that you can easily dicipher.  You claim we
are  the  villains  of the  information  age,  as  you  assasinate  another 
president, cover up more information, and make shady deals with yet another 
foreign leader. 
                         
Let me inform you of the ongoing state of mind, the attitude, the power, that 
is  the  Xenon Foundation.   We are a handful  of collective intelligence, of 
revolutionaries,  if you will,  who have  combined forces to fight the horrid 
system of oppression we call the government.  First of all, we have been, and 
always  shall be first and foremost,  computer intruders.  Hackers, crackers, 
thieves,  criminals,  call us what you will, but we are not any of those.  We 
are crusaders,  on a relentless  mission  to  gather as  much information and 
knowledge as humanly possible, using the most powerful medium  known to man - 
the computer - to aid us.  Combine  that medium  with that  of the  telephone 
network and you've got an endless stream of data -  of information  - flowing 
directly through your computer,  into your brain,  into your soul.  Feed your 
brain with what your consciousness craves.  Liberate yourself, my friend, and 
take the plunge into the electronic  sea of digital  data.  Unearth the  mass 
of 1's and 0's that have been  intentionally  covered up by the vile powers  
that be, to protect us."
                            

Welcome to "the-X-files."  At last, from the guild of secrets, the Ring of 
Five, and out of the confines of secrecy, are the Xenon Foundation's most 
sacred works, including some of the most extensive technical volumes that 
have ever been combined into any series of digital text.
