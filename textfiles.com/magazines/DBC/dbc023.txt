     In the beginning, before time and light and digital watches, Egg was all,
 and that was good. Egg ruled the darkness, in which there existed a hole. Egg
 opened the hole, and out sprung a beautiful world of darkness and mystery.
 Egg fashioned the world into a sphere and set forth to populate the sphere
 with a multitude of life. Egg made moles and rabbits and newts, birds,
 turtles, cows, and lemmings, turkeys, bears, deer, and house cats, men,
 asses, oxen, moose, mice, and women, horses, whales, sharks, fish, and many,
 many more. Egg covered the dark world with lush vegetation and vast, navy
 blue oceans. The world was beautiful. Egg molded mountains and valleys and
 made vast plains of grass for her animals to frolic in. As a final touch, Egg
 created eggs in her own image. The eggs had chickens, and the chickens had
 eggs, in a never-ending cycle. And that was good.
     [Note: The long sought-after answer to the deep, theological question:
 "Which came first the chicken or the egg?" Here it is clearly illustrated
 that eggs, made in Egg's own image, came first.]
     But from that hole, one day poured forth all sorts of bright, glowing
 objects, such as stars, moons and gooseneck lamps. Gomez, the source of all
 evil, came next, bringing with him light, spandex, smurfs, day-glo and evil.
 Gomez beguiled the populace into believing that light was good. [Note: This
 was bad.] Men made fire, and oil lamps, and eventually, light bulbs. That's
 when they whole world went to pot. The darkness, scorned by all, dwelt in
 fear of the minions of light, sheltered deep within the chambers of its once
 dark and beautiful world. The smurfs sought to destroy the dark, but it hid.
 The darkness feared the light; and Age upon age, lived in torment, hunted by
 the spandex-sporting smurfs.
     One day, Egg grew quite angry ay all this, seeing her lovely darkplanet
 covered with skyscrapers, amusement parks, and Taco Bells. Egg looked down
 from on high, and spoke unto the dark, "Darkness, take back what was once
 thine. And for Pete's sake, shut up those damned smurfs! I will send you a
 savior, to help your quest. Listen to her for she is my anointed."

          ----------- <*> I - The Infancy Narrative <*> -----------

 Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Hezekiah, Hezekiah the father of Eliud, the
 second cousin of Olga, the half sister and wife of Le Butt. Of him was born
 the Anti-Egg.

                          The Birth of the Anti-Egg

     Now this is how the birth of the Anti-Egg came about. Le Butt, a lowly
 poultry farmer who lived by means of his scrawny chickens, was chosen by Egg
 to bear the Anti-Egg. Egg sent an angel, Sibodeff, down unto Le Butt, and the
 ange spoketh, "The wise and all-knowing Egg has chosen you to be her
 messenger. Will thou bring forth the Anti-Egg and faithfully bear the message
 of Egg?"
     Le Butt promptly prostrated himself at Sibodeff's feet, crying "Oh
 messenger of Egg, I am a filthy sinner, a lowly, dirty minion of the light!
 Have mercy! I am not worthy!" But Sibodeff spoke, "Thou art worthy. Hast not
 the Egg chosen thee to be the messenger?"
     The Holy pact was made, and miraculously, Le Butt conceived a child. Le
 Butt's village, Sinew, was in an uproar. The citizens were astonished that Le
 Butt was with child, but being stupid, it wasn't because he was a man. They
 overlooked the obvious and were disgusted that Le Butt was not married. Le
 Butt promptly married Olga, his half sister, to please his village.
     It happened that thst year was the year of the great poll. Olga and Le
 butt, heavy with child, journeyed to the city of Blachama, some two hundred
 miles from Sinew. Along the way, Olga became leprous. When the couple
 arrivedin Blachama, they begged for a room in several inns, but were cast out
 into the cold by the proprietors. Le Butt was finally granted lodging in the
 outhouse of a small inn, but Olga was forbidden to set foot on the premises.
 Olga fled for Pallakah, a city on the Nile, explaining to Le Butt that she
 could not endanger his life any further, for she was leprous. It turned out
 that Olga was faking her leprosy all along, and ran off to life with her gay
 lover, Melenia, in Egypt.
     That night alone in the cold, dark outhouse, Le Butt bore the Anti-Egg.
 The songs of angels rose like a chill wind above the counryside. The blessed
 Anti-Egg lay in swaddling upon the outhouse floor, until some lost kings in a
 drunked stupor stumbled into the outhouse and vomited all over Le Butt and
 the Anti-Egg. The most sober of the three companions begged apologies for his
 drunken comrades, and after throwing up once more, he offered Le Butt some
 incense and two gold pieces to compensate for Le Butt's ruined clothes.

     
         ----------- <*> II - Proclamation of the Egg <*> -----------

                        The Temptation of the Anti-Egg

     The Anti-Egg was led by the spirit into thr desert, to be tempted by
 Gomez. The Anti-Egg rested quietly in the shade of a tall cactus. After
 several days, Gomez, in the form of a coyote, trottedup to her. Gomez spoke,
 "See, Anti-Egg,it would be quite easy for me to lift my leg and pour hot piss
 all over you. If you are the anointed of Egg, save yourself." She said in
 reply, "It is written:

     One may live throught an attack of locusts,
     Or survive a beating with a club,
     If one wears a bullet-proof vest.
     Piss is trivial."
 
     With that , Gomez pissed on the Anti-Egg, and trotted away.  The next
 day, Gomez flew down to the Anti-Egg in the form of a crow. He grasped the
 Anti-Egg in his claws and flew above the mighty cities of the world. He said,
 "See how the world swarms with those vile creatures, the Smurfs? If you are
 truly the anointed of Egg, why can you not make them go away?" The Anti-Egg
 said simply in her infinite wisdom, "Piss-off, Gomez." With that, Gomez
 dropped the Anti-Egg back into the desert.
     On the last day, Gomez cam in his natural form, that of a hairy, fat,
 skulky Headmaster with a square head. He said, "Anti-Egg, you have not
 succumbed to my temptations. Let me make a business proposition. I run a
 small spandex production factory outside of Blachema. I'm looking for a
 partner. It's quite lucrative, because there are millions of people who, for
 some bizarre reason, want to buy day-glo spandex! What do you say?" At this,
 the Anti-Egg said to him, "Get away from me, Gomez! It is written:
 
     Thou shalt not wear spandex,
     nor day-glo, for this is
     the ultimate sin."
 
     Then, Gomez left her, and the Anti-Egg left the desert.

                       The Call For the First Disciples

     As the Anti-Egg went by a lamp factory in Chesadea, she saw two brothers,
 Lem and Swell, slaving over a large, neon green gooseneck lamp in a brightly
 lit room. They were nearly blind due to the extreme brightness of the
 factory's lighting and test area. The Anti-Egg said to them, "Come after me,
 and I will give you darkness." At once they left their lamps and followed
 her.     
     Their eyes were instantly repaired to 20/20 vision. The three went along
 from there and saw two other brothers, Colau and Puce, and their friends,
 Schlockenhoffenstein (and Sam) wearing brightly colored spandex biking
 shorts.  The anti-egg called them, and immediately they left their spandex
 and followed her.

                       Ministering to a Great Multitude

     The Anti-Egg went around all of Chesadea, teaching the people and
 proclaiming the word of Egg. Her fame spread to all who were sick and wracked
 with pain, and all those who were possessed or lunatics. Great crowds of
 psychotic idiots followed her.

                            The Light of the Body

     "It is said that the Lamp of the body is the eye. If that is so, then
 gouge out your eyes because light is evil."

                                Egg and Money

     "Do not give me your money. I am the anointed of Egg. Why on Earth would
 I need money? Instead, use this money to buy me Hostess(TM) Cupcakes and
 Twinkies."

                                Eggs and Swine

     "Do not give what is holy to dogs, or throw your eggs before swine, lest
 the eggs devour your swine and leave you destitute and swineless."

                                False Prophets

     "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in spandex. By their shorts
 you will know them. Do intelligent people wear spandex? Just so, every good
 prophet wears good shorts, and a rotten prophet wears bad spandex. A good
 prophet cannot wear spandex, nor can a rotten prophet wear good shorts. Every
 prophet that does not wear good shorts will be chopped up into little White
 Castle hamburgers and be thrown into the fire. So by their shorts will you
 know them."


          ----------- <*> III - Ministry in Chesadea <*> -----------

                    The Healing of the Lepadiam Demoniacs

     When the Anti-Egg went through the gardens of Lepadiam, two demoniacs who
 were coming from the tombs met her. They were so savage, and wore neon pink
 spandex biking shorts, that no one could travel by road. They cried out,
 "What have you to do with us, Anti-Egg? Do you wish to make fun of our
 shorts?" The Anti-Egg cried out, "Gomez, leave these poor souls! And take
 your spandex!" With that, the demons left, and the two men quickly removed
 the spandex shorts, and threw them into the ocean.

                      The Healing of a Boy with a Demon

     When the Anti-Egg and her disciples came to a crowd, a man approached and
 said, "Oh Anti-Egg, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic. He often falls
 into fires, or water." The Anti-Egg said, "Pull aside his coat." The man did
 this, revealing the boy's pair of purple spandex shorts. "Take those off!"
 The Anti-Egg commanded. The man did this. "Gomez, leave this boy!" The
 Anti-Egg demanded, and the demons fled.

                         Bachareus the Spandex-Maker

     The Anti-Egg came to Jericho and hoped to pass through the town. Now a
 man named Bachareus, who was the Captain of the Spandex Guild, came to her.
 The Anti-Egg said "Come, Bachareus. I am to stay at your house." Bachareus
 was exalted, but the followers of the Anti-Egg were wary. "She is going to
 stay in the house of an evil-doer!"
     But Bachareus said, "Behold, I will cast out my spandex! I will leave the
 company and begin a worthy trade. I hear the Taco Bell is hiring." And the
 Anti-Egg said, "Today your soul is saved, for in denouncing spandex, you
 denounced Gomez. Never again shall you feel the urge to wear day-glo."


         ----------- <*> IV - The Mission of the Six <*> -----------

     The Anti-Egg summoned her six disciples and gave them authority over
 unclean spandex, and the power to drive out Gomez. The names of the disciples
 are these: Lem and Swell, sons of Melidas, Colau and Puce,
 Schlockenhoffenstein (and Sam)
     She went out to the six after instructing them thusly, "Do not go into
 pagan territory or enter a spandex factory. Go rather to the lost chicks of
 the house of Egg. As you go, make this proclamation: 'The kingdom of Egg is
 at hand. ' Cleanse unclean shorts and dispel Gomez. Without cost you have
 received, without cost you are to give. Do not take gold or silver or copper
 -- Instead, ask for a ritual sacrifice of foods high in saturated fats.
 Whatever village you enter, look for a worthy home and stay there until you
 leave. Whoever denies the word of Egg will not receive you -- Go outside and
 curse their souls to Hell. Burn their houses and move on.
