                                   THE FALL
                                 ------------

Green as the leaves on the tress, Gumby stands
Tall against the giant mountains
Stretched before him endless fields
He starts to move, a graceless mass
of paint and clay.
His plodding feet pound on the ground,
as he races toward the blazing toxic waste
Suddenly, the groung beneath him thins
and he penetrates the surface of the tissue paper earth.
And then, around him, walls appear where nothingness had been,
and from the bottom of the pit cannon balls are hurled.
His thick green blood splatters on the walls.
And still, Gumby falls.
Angry knives attack and slash away at Gumby's eyes,
and then he lands,
Impaled upon a giant knitting needle one thousand miles high,
piercing him and shredding him
until his breath gives way to te agonizing screams of
Painful Death.
Spinning,twisting,screaming, Gumby begins to implode,
as his molecules warp away into a new dimension.
And at the bottom of the pit a bloody gumwad lies
among the greasy squirming pus that once was Gumby.
