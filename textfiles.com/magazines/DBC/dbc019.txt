It was a dark silent night the unicorn came.
A shimmering, a glimmer of light reflected.
A sigh, a whisper and it was gone.

The second night was better, lighter
And the child was waiting,
But the unicorn was scared 
And disappeared once more.

Children grow old and life is not a game anymore.
Bills are real; unicorns are not.
So the third time was a surprise
To the middle-aged, balding man.

Now he got scared. Reality and fantasy
Flowed together in one blurry picture.
Life - was it a dream? Did he really
Have to feed those sad mouths?

He didn't realize he had gone insane.
Or that his children were dying.
He only saw a white fluffy mane.

The fourth time was benevolent,
Though he never understood exactly
How his children come to leave him.
And he never knew that death 
Would be a reunion between him,
His children,
And the unicorn.

The beast
That was only him
After all.
