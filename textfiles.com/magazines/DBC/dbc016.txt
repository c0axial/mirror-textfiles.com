                                My Only One

                             Pulsating, green.
                          Glowing like a new life.
                           Expanding, contracting
                           With a constant rhythm
                         So perfect, so spheroidal
                            It is its own world.
                         It is mine for I found it.
                   In a box marked "Danger do not touch"
                             I am one with it.
                            I dared to love it.
                             I dared to own it.
                            I dared to feed it.
                        When it was sick I cured it
                     When it was smart I encouraged it
                     It grew to be larger than my house
                         This green piece of matter
                             How I care for it
                        Though I know naught of it.
                              My only friend.
