                            Elementary School Tales
                             --------------------
                             by Snarfblat (Age 7 - 8)

     [These are tales Snarfblat wrote while in Second and Third grade, circa
1981, I think. He dredged them up from his secret storage areas and I picked
out the best bunch. This _is_ quality literature. Each one of these took up
an entire side of wide-ruled yellow school paper, the kind that smells funky
and probably gets little kids high. Enjoy. - R. Tox]

Problems of a Giant
-------------------

     A giant has a hard time getting ice cream because he has to get some
snow and put in the flavoring which is hard to get because it is buried ten
feet in the ground in Africa.

The Shadow
----------

     Once there was a cat named Shadow. But the cat looked just like his
shadow. He used to run around and pretend to be two shadows.  People who saw
him ran away. They thought he was two shadows.

Mittens
-------

     My cat is named Mittens. He is gray with white paws. When he's bad, I
pick him up and spin him around. He has killed a bird and a rabbit in the
past week, but he's still good.

Forgetful Jerry
---------------

     Forgetful Jerry is a brown dog with white spots. If you ask him what his
name is, he'll tell you after thinking for ten hours.  He has a thing in his
throat that lets him talk.

Bla!
----

     I don't like salad. It's poisonous! Sometimes it looks like it has
little bugs in it. Nothing is worse than salad! My brother likes salad
because he's just as bad. Salad is green and wet and awful! It's also mushy!

Untitled
--------

One day I was eating my leg
when my brother leaned over and bit my head
I fell off my chair and went through the floor
and my head went rolling out the door.

Mom called the doctor; he said, "Yup."
but he drove off a cliff and his car blew up.
he was in it, so he died
that must have been a discouraging ride.

Haiku
-----

Waves roll on the sand
But they can be dangerous
A wave drowns my cat

The wind is so strong
That it blew my cat to Mars
Martians will kill him

Untitled 2
----------

     One day Gig, the gnome, came out of his igloo.
     "I have made the greatest machine ever. it is the Stepladder-Sleigh." he
said as he pulled a cover off of a machine. Everyone stared at it.
     It was a sleigh with a stepladder on the back. The stepladder was used
to highjack a gigantic raccoon.
     Then some chimes rang, and Agide unveiled an emerald green spaceship.
Twenty-five gnomes tried to get in it.
     "No, don't!", cried Agide. "The green light may blind you!" The gnomes
got out, but Scrooge pushed them back in. Then he made a grimace face and ran
away. Then Gig took off after him in the Stepladder-Sleigh. Scrooge had only
gone ten feet when Gig reached him, highjacked him, and stabbed him with a
metric ruler.
