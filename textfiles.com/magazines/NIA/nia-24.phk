$_Virus Prevention in General


   To provide general  protection from attacks by  computer viruses,
   unauthorized users, and related threats,  users and managers need
   to eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities.  A general summary of the
   vulnerabilities that  computer viruses  and  related threats  are
   most likely to exploit is as follows:

      - lack of user  awareness - users  copy and share  infected
        software, fail to detect signs of virus activity,  do not
        understand proper security techniques

      - absence  of or  inadequate security  controls -  personal
        computers generally  lack software and  hardware security
        mechanisms that help  to prevent and detect  unauthorized
        use,  existing   controls  on   multi-user  systems   can
        sometimes be surmounted by knowledgeable users

      - ineffective  use of  existing  security controls  - using
        easily guessed passwords, failing to use access controls,
        granting users more access to resources than necessary

      - bugs  and  loopholes  in   system  software  -   enabling
        knowledgeable users to break into systems or exceed their
        authorized privileges

      - unauthorized use  - unauthorized  users can  break in  to
        systems,  authorized users can exceed levels of privilege
        and misuse systems

      - susceptibility  of  networks  to  misuse  - networks  can
        provide anonymous access to systems,  many are in general
        only as secure as the systems which use them

   As can be seen from this  summary, virus prevention requires that
   many  diverse  vulnerabilities   be  addressed.    Some   of  the
   vulnerabilities  can  be  improved  upon significantly,  such  as
   security controls that can be added or improved, while others are
   somewhat inherent in computing, such as  the risk that users will
   not use  security controls  or follow  policies, or  the risk  of
   unauthorized use of computers and networks.  Thus,  it may not be
   possible  to  completely  protect  systems  from  all  virus-like
   attacks.   However, to  attain a realistic  degree of protection,
   all areas of vulnerability must be addressed; improving upon some
   areas at the expense of others will still leave significant holes
   in security.


   To  adequately  address all  areas  of vulnerability,  the active
   involvement  of individual  users, the management  structure, and
   the  organization  in a  virus  prevention program  is essential.
   Such a program, whether formal or informal, depends on the mutual
   cooperation of the  three groups to identify  vulnerabilities, to
   take steps to correct them, and to monitor the results.

   A virus prevention program must be initially based upon effective
   system   computer  administration   that   restricts  access   to
   authorized  users,   ensures  that  hardware  and   software  are
   regularly monitored and maintained, makes  backups regularly, and
   maintains contingency  procedures for potential  problems.  Sites
   that do not maintain a basic computer administration program need
   to put  one into place, regardless of their  size or the types of
   computers used.  Many system vendors supply system administration
   manuals that describe the aspects of a basic program.

   Once a basic  administration program is in  place, management and
   users need  to incorporate  virus prevention  measures that  will
   help to deter attacks by viruses and related threats, detect when
   they occur, contain the attacks to limit damage, and recover in a
   reasonable amount of  time without loss  of data.  To  accomplish
   these aims, attention needs to be focused on the following areas:

      - educating users  about malicious software in general, the
        risks  that  it  poses,  how  to  use  control  measures,
        policies, and  procedures to  protect themselves  and the
        organization

      - software management policies  and procedures that address
        public-domain software, and  the use  and maintenance  of
        software in general

      - use of technical controls that  help to prevent and deter
        attacks by malicious software and unauthorized users

      - monitoring of user and software  activity to detect signs
        of attacks, to  detect policy violations, and  to monitor
        the overall  effectiveness of  policies, procedures,  and
        controls

      - contingency policies  and procedures  for containing  and
        recovering from attacks

   General  guidance  in each  of these  areas  is explained  in the
   following sections.


$_Education


   Education is  one of  the primary  methods by  which systems  and
   organizations can  achieve greater  protection from  incidents of
   malicious software  and unauthorized  use.   In situations  where
   technical controls do not provide complete protection (i.e., most
   computers),  it  is ultimately  people  and their  willingness to
   adhere to security  policies that will determine  whether systems
   and organizations  are protected.   By educating users  about the
   general  nature  of  computer  viruses  and related  threats,  an
   organization can improve  its ability  to deter, detect,  contain

   Users should be educated about the following:

      - how malicious software  operates, methods by which  it is
        planted  and  spread,  the  vulnerabilities exploited  by
        malicious software and unauthorized users

      - general security policies  and procedures and how  to use
        them

      - the policies to follow regarding the backup, storage, and
        use of  software, especially  public-domain software  and
        shareware

      - how  to use  the technical  controls they  have at  their
        disposal to protect themselves

      - how to monitor their systems and software to detect signs
        of abnormal activity, what  to do or whom to  contact for
        more information

      - contingency procedures for containing and recovering from
        potential incidents

   User education,  while perhaps  expensive in  terms  of time  and
   resources required,  is ultimately a  cost-effective measure  for
   protecting  against   incidents   of   malicious   software   and
   unauthorized  use.  Users  who  are  better acquainted  with  the
   destructive potential of  malicious software  and the methods  by
   which it  can attack  systems may  in  turn be  prompted to  take
   measures to protect themselves.  The purpose of security policies
   and procedures will be more clear, thus users may be more willing
   to actively use them.  By  educating users how to detect abnormal
   system activity  and the resultant steps to follow for containing
   and recovering from potential  incidents, organizations will save
   money and time if and when actual incidents occur.

$_Software Management


   As shown by  examples in File 1,  one of the prime  methods by
   which malicious software  is initially copied onto  systems is by
   unsuspecting users.   When users  download programs from  sources
   such  as  software  bulletin  boards,  or public  directories  on
   systems or network servers, or in  general use and share software
   that has  not been obtained from a reputable source, users are in
   danger of  spreading malicious software.   To prevent  users from
   potentially spreading malicious software, managers need to

      - ensure  that  users understand  the  nature of  malicious
        software,  how it is generally  spread, and the technical
        controls to use to protect themselves

      - develop policies for  the downloading and use  of public-
        domain and shareware software

      - create  some mechanism for validating such software prior
        to allowing users to copy and use it

      - minimize the exchange  of executable  software within  an
        organization as much as possible

      - do not create  software repositories on LAN servers or in
        multi-user system directories  unless technical  controls
        exist  to   prevent  users   from  freely   uploading  or
        downloading the software

   The  role  of  education  is  important,  as  users  who  do  not
   understand  the risks  yet who  are  asked to  follow necessarily
   restrictive policies may share and  copy software anyway.   Where
   technical controls  cannot prevent  placing new  software onto  a
   system, users are  then primarily responsible for the  success or
   failure of whatever policies are developed.

   A policy  that  prohibits any  copying  or use  of  public-domain
   software  may  be  overly  restrictive,  as  some  public  domain
   programs have proved  to be  useful.  A  less restrictive  policy
   would  allow some  copying, however  a  user might  first require
   permission from the appropriate manager.  A special system should
   be used  from which  to perform  the copy  and then  to test  the
   software.  This type of system, called an isolated system, should
   be configured so that there is no risk of spreading a potentially
   malicious program to other areas of  an organization.  The system
   should  not  be  used  by  other  users, should  not  connect  to
   networks, and should not contain any  valuable data.  An isolated
   system should also be used  to test internally developed software
   and updates to vendor software.

   Other policies for managing vendor  software should be developed.
   These  policies  should   control  how  and  where   software  is
   purchased, and should govern where the software  is installed and
   how it is to be used.  The following policies and  procedures are
   suggested:

      - purchase vendor software only from reputable sources

      - maintain the software properly and update it as necessary

      - don't use pirated software, as it may have been modified

      - keep  records  of  where  software is  installed  readily
        available for contingency purposes

      - ensure that vendors can be  contacted quickly if problems
        occur

      - store the original  disks or tapes  from the vendor in  a
        secure location


$_Technical Controls

   Technical  controls  are  the  mechanisms  used  to  protect  the
   security and integrity of  systems and associated data.   The use
   of technical controls can help  to prevent occurrences of viruses
   and related threats by deterring them or making it more difficult
   for them  to  gain access  to  systems  and data.    Examples  of
   technical controls include user authentication mechanisms such as
   passwords, mechanisms which provide selective levels of access to
   files and directories  (read-only, no  access, access to  certain
   users,  etc.),  and  write-protection  mechanisms  on  tapes  and
   diskettes.


   The different types of technical controls and the degree to which
   they  can provide protection and deterrence varies from system to
   system, thus the use  of specific types of controls  is discussed
   in the following files.  However,  the following general points are
   important to note:

      - technical  controls  should  be  used  as   available  to
        restrict system access to authorized users only

      - in the multi-user environment, technical controls  should
        be  used  to  limit  users'  privileges  to  the  minimum
        practical level; they should work  automatically and need
        not be initiated by users

      - users and system managers must be  educated as to how and
        when to use technical controls

      - where  technical controls are weak or non-existent (i.e.,
        personal  computers), they  should  be supplemented  with
        alternative   physical   controls   or   add-on   control
        mechanisms

   Managers need to determine which technical controls are available
   on their systems,  and then the  degree to which  they should  be
   used and whether  additional add-on controls are  necessary.  One
   way  to  answer  these  questions  is  to  first  categorize  the
   different classes of data being processed by a system or systems,
   and then to  rank the  categories according to  criteria such  as
   sensitivity to the  organization and vulnerability of  the system
   to attack.  The rankings should then help determine the degree to
   which  the  controls  should be  applied  and  whether additional
   controls are  necessary.   Ideally, those systems  with the  most
   effective controls should be used  to process the most  sensitive
   data, and vice-versa.   As an example, a personal  computer which
   processes  sensitive employee  information should  require add-on
   user authentication mechanisms, whereas  a personal computer used
   for general word processing may not need additional controls.


   It is important to note that  technical controls do not generally
   provide complete protection against viruses  and related threats.
   They may be cracked by determined  users who are knowledgeable of
   hidden  bugs and weaknesses,  and they may  be surmounted through
   the use of Trojan horse programs, as shown by examples in File
   1.  An  inherent weakness  in technical controls  is that,  while
   deterring users and  software from objects  to which they do  not
   have  access,  they may  be  totally ineffective  against attacks
   which target objects that are accessible.  For example, technical
   controls may not prevent an authorized user from destroying files
   to which the user has authorized  access.  Most importantly, when
   technical controls  are not  used properly, they  may increase  a
   system's  degree of vulnerability.   It is  generally agreed that
   fully effective technical  controls will not be  widely available
   for some time.   Because of the immediate nature of  the computer
   virus threat,  technical controls  must be  supplemented by  less
   technically-oriented control  measures such as  described in this
   chapter.

$_General Monitoring

   An  important aspect of  computer viruses and  related threats is
   that they  potentially can cause  extensive damage within  a very
   small amount of time, such as minutes or seconds.  Through proper
   monitoring of software, system activity,  and in some cases  user
   activity,  managers  can increase  their  chances that  they will
   detect   early  signs  of  malicious  software  and  unauthorized
   activity.  Once the presence is  noted or suspected, managers can
   then  use  contingency  procedures to  contain  the  activity and
   recover  from whatever  damage has  been  caused.   An additional
   benefit of  general monitoring is that  over time, it can  aid in
   determining  the  necessary  level  or   degree  of  security  by
   indicating  whether security  policies, procedures,  and controls
   are working as planned.

   Monitoring  is  a  combination  of  continual system  and  system
   management activity.   Its effectiveness  depends on  cooperation
   between management and users.   The following items are necessary
   for effective monitoring:

      - user  education  -  users must  know,  specific  to their
        computing  environment,  what   constitutes  normal   and
        abnormal system activity and whom  to contact for further
        information - this  is especially important for  users of
        personal  computers,  which   generally  lack   automated
        methods for monitoring

      - automated system  monitoring tools - generally  on multi-
        user systems, to  automate logging or accounting  of user
        and  software  accesses  to accounts,  files,  and  other
        system objects  - can sometimes  be tuned to  record only
        certain types of accesses such as "illegal" accesses

      - anti-viral software  - generally  on personal  computers,
        these tools alert users of certain types of system access
        that are indicative of "typical" malicious software

      - system-sweep programs  - programs to  automatically check
        files for changes in size, date, or content

      - network  monitoring  tools -  as  with system  monitoring
        tools, to record network accesses or attempts to access

   The statistics gained  from monitoring activities should  be used
   as input for periodic reviews of  security programs.  The reviews
   should  evaluate the effectiveness  of general system management,
   and associated security policies, procedures,  and controls.  The
   statistics will indicate  the need for  changes and will help  to
   fine tune the program so that security is distributed to where it
   is most necessary.   The reviews  should also incorporate  users'
   suggestions,  and  to  ensure  that  the program  is  not  overly
   restrictive, their criticisms.

$_Contingency Planning


   The  purpose  of  contingency planning  with  regard  to computer
   viruses and related threats is to be able to  contain and recover
   completely from  actual attacks.  In many  ways, effective system
   management  that  includes  user  education,  use   of  technical
   controls,  software management,  and monitoring activities,  is a
   form  of  contingency  planning, generally  because  a  well-run,
   organized  system  or facility  is better  able to  withstand the
   disruption that could  result from a  computer virus attack.   In
   addition to effective system management activities, managers need
   to consider  other contingency procedures that  specifically take
   into account the nature of computer viruses and related threats.

   Possibly  the  most   important  contingency  planning   activity
   involves the use of backups.  The ability to recover from a virus
   attack depends upon maintaining regular,  frequent backups of all
   system data.   Each backup should be  checked to ensure  that the
   backup media has not  been corrupted.  Backup media  could easily
   be corrupted because of defects, because the backup procedure was
   incorrect, or perhaps because the backup software itself has been
   attacked and modified to corrupt backups as they are made.

   Contingency procedures for  restoring from backups after  a virus
   attack  are equally  important.   Backups may  contain  copies of
   malicious  software  that   have  been  hiding  in   the  system.
   Restoring  the  malicious software  to  a  system  that has  been
   attacked could  cause a recurrence of the problem.  To avoid this
   possibility, software should  be restored only from  its original
   media:   the tapes or diskettes from the  vendor.  In some cases,
   this may  involve reconfiguring the software,  therefore managers
   must maintain copies of configuration  information for system and
   application software.   Because data is not  directly executable,
   it  can be restored from routine backups.  However, data that has
   been  damaged  may need  to be  restored  manually or  from older
   backups.    Command files  such  as  batch  procedures and  files
   executed  when  systems  boot  or  when  user log  on  should  be
   inspected to ensure that they have  not been damaged or modified.
   Thus,  managers  will  need  to  retain  successive  versions  of
   backups, and search through them when restoring  damaged data and
   command files.

   Other contingency procedures for containing virus attacks need to
   be developed.  The following are suggested; they are discussed in
   more detail in following files:


      - ensure that accurate  records are  kept of each  system's
        configuration,  including  the  system's   location,  the
        software  it   runs,  the  system's  network   and  modem
        connections,  and  the name  of  the system's  manager or
        responsible individual

      - create a  group  of  skilled users  to  deal  with  virus
        incidents and ensure that users  can quickly contact this
        group if they suspect signs of viral activity

      - maintain a security  distribution list at each  site with
        appropriate telephone numbers of managers to contact when
        problems occur

      - isolate critical systems from  networks and other sources
        of infection

      - place outside  network connections  on  systems with  the
        best  protections,  use  central  gateways to  facilitate
        rapid disconnects
