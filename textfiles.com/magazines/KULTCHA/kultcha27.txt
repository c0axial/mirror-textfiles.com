No mention of counter-cultural Atlanta omits THE BIRD,
although it was either more or less than counter-cultural.
First there was a BIRD. Then there was no BIRD (1976).
Then there was a BIRD (1985). Now there is no BIRD --
sorely missed by Atlanta's Marx-Leninist. Others felt
it lacked diversity.
