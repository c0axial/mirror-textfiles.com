   "There are only two choices open to those who have discov-
ered that society is a madhouse. In the tradition of Plato's
cave, they can withdraw and seek light elsewhere to discover
the larger landscape in which the madhouse is located. Or, if
that Platonic tradition of the Good seems merely an infantile
fantasy, they can deny self-determination to the insane major-
ity and burn the madhouse to the ground to force people out
into the open." -- William Irwin Thompson, AT THE EDGE OF HISTORY
   FASCIST NIGHTMARE COMIX: If you oppose deciding who should
be free or slave or live or die in terms of any single fact
about them (such as race, sexual orientation or worldview) you
find few if any who take the same, or even a similar, view in
spite of protestations that the intelligence community is con-
trolled by enemies of racism and that the racists -- who succeed
in starving to death 15 million of their enemies a year -- are
being lied to or that Ronald Reagan with the worst civil rights
record in history & a mega-imperialist foreign policy is a co-
vert anti-racist -- w/ parallel myths about a supposedly power-
ful feminist matriarchy (while in the real world of horrible
jobs women's wages for the same work as men are lower than be-
fore) & a powerful secret society of gays (while the most rid-
iculous anti-sodomy laws are upheld by the Supreme Court &
the most blithering, ignorant homophobia reigns within the in-
telligence community); as for culturally self-selecting intent-
ional communities such as were advocated by Margaret Mead &
could put all this cultural bickering behind us without cramp-
ing anyone's lifestyle, the are "right around the corner" --
like prosperity under Herbert Hoover;
   If you oppose chronic & pervasive utilization of electro-
chemical mind control because it constitutes a gross violation
of rights & ignores the anarchist dictum that one mind is hardly
sufficient to govern one life -- much less 2, 10, 100 or 1M --
you are told that opposition to genocidal landlordism is incom-
patible with this position, that to defeat mind control it is
necessary to conspire with the KKK & the most irrational trads,
sex bigots, religionists -- never minding that as a matter of
historical fact mind control was developed by Nazi scientists
& used on sexual minorities, LSD users & other "undesirables;"
moreover, you are told this struggle must be conducted in cant
language & is also incompatible w/ abolishing organizational
secrecy -- as if mind control & techno-surveillance slavery
couldn't be fought by alerting the whole world to their reality.
   In short, to survive & prosper in contemporary conspiracy
politics you must be either a capitalist, a statist or a bigot --
two out of three isn't bad & those who are all three probably
have it made. The object of such a process ought to be obvious:
to make rationality that accords with humanity impossible: to
divide the one from the other in order to cultivate the alienated
& diseased rationality of the fascist bastard, the cog in the
industrial army, the mad scientist & the Gestapo bureaucract.
   "I shall continue to be an impossible person as long as
those who are now possible remain possible." -- M. Bakunin
