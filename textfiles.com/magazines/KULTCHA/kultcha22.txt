FASCIST NIGHTMARE COMIX: Imagine anyone, humane by temperament &
devoted to rational values, actually adapting to the intelligence
community or the world of conspiracy politics as they are pictured
in canted communications:
   If you oppose statist retribution & its filthy, inhumane penal
system which breeds far more crime than it cures & if you oppose
enshrining the human frailty of vengeance in the dignity of law,
you are accused of trying to mess up a beautiful blackmail system
that has been carefully refined by social-conscious conspirators
to keep all sorts of totalitarians & racists & sex bigots down;
   If you oppose institutional secrecy because an uninformed
electorate can't possibly safeguard a democracy, you are told
you must "pay" for exposing the secrets of govts., corps., churches,
civic clubs & secret societies by suffering, tit for tat, the most
humiliating invasions for every scandal you air about a munitions
cartel or bank or Nazified police agency, etc., as if merchants of
death are endowed with rights & individuals aren't;
   If you oppose the absentee control of land and natural re-
sources because it is the most profitable contributor to the de
facto holocaust of starvation decimating every six months more
people among the races detested by Nazis that did all Hitler's
death camps, you are told that -- because of the way things are
organized -- you must then sanction authoritarian govt., perse-
cution of gays & other sex minorities, torture, mind control,
secrecy, Jonestown-type cults OR central banking &, astoundingly,
even the Republican Party;
   If you oppose central banking -- a form of statist monopolism
that directly creates cold wars, fuels inflation & corrupts rev-
olutions -- you are told that in supporting monetary mutualism
you are expected to abandon nearly all other causes, particularly
eradication of secrecy and destruction of genocidal landlordism,
& it becomes obvious that most enemies of the banks aren't sin-
cere mutualists, but are gold-standard conservatives, Catholics
& Moslems who understand only scriptural injunctions, not money,
Satanist agents provocateurs, Detroit car makers (whose trade
takes more lives than wars) & that educating the public in
the economics of Proudhon, Benj. Tucker, Lysander Spooner, et.
al., is in fact the last thing these fools and cads intend;
   If you oppose absentee control of production because it makes
for regimentation of workers that in the long run is proving not
to stop short of mind control experimentation, you are told you
must then support banking, parental extortion, sodiummorphate-
microwaver-Pacemaker slavery & countless such bizarre outrages
in what constitutes one of the most convoluted, Jesuitical,
baroque & Nixonesque intolerably authoritarian conspiracies;
   If you oppose coercive social organization because govt. is
supported by theft (taxes), threats & violence & because bureau-
cracy is chaotic & militarism primitive, you are told in defiance
of logic that you must then support sex bigotry & left anarchist
organization  controlled by Mason-Republicans as ruthlessly as
is any State OR must join anarcho-capitalists under the invisible
leadership of an elite cadre of assassins who seem unaware of
private cartel armies of industrial espionage Satanists, etc.
   "There are only two choices open to those who have discov-
ered society is a madhouse." -- William Irwin Thompson
