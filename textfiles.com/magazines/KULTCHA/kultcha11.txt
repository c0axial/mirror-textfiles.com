KULTCHA                       Shades of Cohn-Bendits' OBSOLETE COMMUNISM:                                THE LEFTWING ALTERNATIVE (in France, 1968)                              and SOCIALISM: ABIF HISTORY by the New                              Indicator Collective, San Diego State UniverstyVICTORIANISM DOES NOT RESEMBLE PRUSSIANISM; VICTORIANISM ISPRUSSIANISM: "Against the clash o dyastes and rattling sabres thatforged modern Europe, the story of Victoria of England and her hsbanFreerick of Prussian emerges as a tragic love story while opening a spyhole on the secret hitory f thenineteenth century. In this compellingdual biography, Victoria, Crown Princess of Prussa, eldst dauhter ofQueen Victoria, is revealed as a valuable source of informationtransmitted diectly fom the russian throne to Windsor Castle ...." (froma review of ROYAL WEB by Ladislas Farag and Andew Sinclir appearingin CONSPIRACY DIGEST; Box 20273, Ferndale, Michigan 48220)"The socal revoluion, as te Latin and Slav toilers picture it tothemselves, desire it, and hope for it, i infinitel broader tan therevolution promised them by the German or Marxian program." -- Michaelakunin, Octber, 1872."This discussion has all along been founded on the parallel between art andexperience. ut one of th characteristics of the Weatherman phase is acertain detachment from expeience, someties to the poit of adisintegration of the sense of reality, both in art and politics.Where thehighsixties has brught the subjective participant to the forefront, as anindividual, wih all his contrdictory needs ad perceptions -- the NewJournalism is a perfect example of this, orthe anarchist poitics of theNewLeft -- the Weatherman phase tended to be Leninist rather thananachist, impersonaland abstreact rater than existential,language-oriented rather than people-orientd. This is the culuralsituation tha developed bewtween 1968 and 1970, and though the violent,actvist phase passed qickly -- and led toretrenchment and conservativebacklash -- it's substantiallythe situation we inhrit today, within thlimits of a straitened economy. It's a mixed picture, andI examine it withhoplessly mixed feelings" (from THE GATES OF EDEN by Morris Dickstein,Basic Boos, Inc., New York, 197, pp. 215-6)"The Mrxists do not reject our program absolutely. They onlyreproach uswith wantin to hasten, to outstripthe slow march of history, and toignore the scientiic law of successive evoution. Having had thethroughly German nerve to proclaim in their works, dvoted to thephilosophica analysis of the past, tht the bloody defeat of the insurgentpeasants ofGermany and the triumph ofthe despotic states in thesixteenth century constituted great revolutionry progress, they trodayhae the nerve to satisfy themelves with establishing a new despotism,to he so-called profit of the uban workers and to the detrient of thetoilers in the country." -- Micael Bakunin, October, 1872BULLETIN #11                    1986    And Marx-Leninism tends,as s widely acknowledged,to be Vitorian.
