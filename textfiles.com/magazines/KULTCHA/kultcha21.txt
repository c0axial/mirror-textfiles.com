HOW TO BECOME A CARD-CARRYING MEMBER
OF THE REVOLUTIONAR SURREALIST VANDAL PARTY

   1. Get yourself a deck of cards and carry it with you at
all times.  If they are playing cards, learn to deal from the
bottom of the deck and make money that way to pay for paint,
markers, stencils, bail, etc. If they are Tarot Cards, tell
fortunes in order to finance your vandalism.
   2. Add the initials, R.S.V.P., to your "sign" to indicate
your membership and agreement with these principles.
   3. Vandalize only property anarchists would define as
"theft" or "impossible" rather than "liberty."
   4. To find out what anarchists think, read anarchist books,
which can be found on the 2nd Floor of the Atlanta Public Lib-
rary (Central) principally in the 335.83 section (also: 300.1,
301.6, 320.1, 320.57, 322.42, 335.4, 364.106, 370.973, 821.7,
947.0841 and 977.3) and ordered from Laissez Faire Books, 206
