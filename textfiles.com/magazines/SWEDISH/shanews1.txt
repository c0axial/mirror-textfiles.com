   ABOUT THE BUST OF THE VISA-FRAUD GUYS PART I
   --------------------------------------------
     Nine youngsters in the so called "Visa-affair" were prosecuted in the 
   Southern Roslagen court January the 28th this year. The youngsters
   are suspected for major fraud with stolen creditcard-numbers. All of them
   are in the risk of going to jail. The police, on the other hand, does not
   believe that they will be judged that hard, because of their age and that
   they are not "real criminals".
     
     It has taken some time for Stockholm city attorney, Bo Skarinder, to 
   get into all of the charges made against the nine youngsters who are 
   between 17 to 21 years old. Together they are charged on 11 counts and
   the one who are worst affected has to face 2 cases of major fraud, 2
   cases of attempt fraud and 3 illegal computer-entries. The minimum you
   can get when you are charged with major fraud is 6 months in jail.
   All of these "crimes" were made over one year ago.

     The youngsters have been calling USA and Great Britain, and placed
   orders at major computerstores. Then they paid with stolen creditcard-
   numbers (VISA and MASTER CARD). The stuff they paid for, were sent to
   a "Poste restante" adress where someone of the charged youngsters picked
   it up using false ID cards. Six cases of this have are registered, and
   two cases when the youngsters didn't collect the stuff at all.
 
     Stefan Kronqvist, at the Stockholm police dept., explains the matter
   by saying " They have been trying the possabilities with a number of
   knowingly lame companies, they didn't know that it was illegal."
   Kronqvist, who leads the investigation continues "The youngsters, like
   the so called "hackers", have created their own etic rules where you
   must break every rule possible. To be the worst is the best. This point
   of view is a direct copy from America." The creditcard-numbers and the
   company-names were obtained from collegues in the United States and
   Sweden. "I think that they regret everything now, tells Kronqvist, they
   are not real criminals."
 
     The major fraud and the attempt fraud cases have been made by six of
   the nine youngsters. Those three left, are faceing charges for recieving
   "stolen goods". When it comes to the illegal entries of computers, they
   have enterd the Swedish Telecom systems. "Pure and simple hacking", says
   Stefan kronqvist. "They have only been trying to get as far into the com-
   puter as possible and ment no harm with it."
 
     "Cred-a-Calc" is the program which generates correct creditcard-numbers
   and it is made by one (19 year old) of the accused. The accusation for
   this is "Preparation of fraud". The program generates MasterCard and VISA
   numbers. He has copied the program to two of his friends.
 
     "It is sad that these crimes have created a "bad" taste for the computer
   market", says Kronqvist. "I hope that these charges won't destroy for those 
   computer-hobbyists who are using the computer legally."
 
     All of the nine youngsters have pleeded Guilty, and all of them are boys.
   The date for trial, will be given later.
