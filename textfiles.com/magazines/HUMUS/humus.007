A very few words:::

	After a sojourn that took me about 10,000 miles this past month, I'm 
back...  uh, let's not clap so loud that I can hear you...

	This issue will contain, among other things, the first of two never-
ending series on (1) REVENGE and (2) Stuff From Comics, THE Real Programmer 
of all time, "How to Regain Your Virginity", and our usual assortment of odd 
and bizarre items...

	We can thank the following people for their contributions to the 
world of Humus:  the RPC-4000 computer, politicians who didn't make last 
month's installation, some students at CalTech, and a number of anonymous 
donations from "out there"...

	So, without further adieu, on with the show...  

============================================================================

	"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here..."

============================================================================

goes back up again to 3 on the 6th, 1932...  The Golden Gate Bridge was 
finally paid for (in full) on the 1st in 1971, and more than a few people 
are asking themselves why there is still a toll for crossing...  President 
Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law on the 2nd, 1964...  Congress 
passes the first minimum wage law on the 12th in 1933.  Minimum?  33cents

	Our first installment in the "Stuff From Comics" collection comes 
from a talented performer that goes by the name of Franklin Ajaye.  You 
might have seen him on The Tonight Show or Late Night with David Letterman, 
but chances are you wouldn't have seen these particular pieces on network 
television...

	Hair is a symbol;  like Don King, his hair is a symbol.  It took me 
about four years before I realized that he was going to wear his hair like 
that for the rest of his life.  I kept waiting for someone to come along and 
tell Don, "Hey, you should get your hair cut soon."  Then it dawned on me 
that he gets it cut like that.  They had an interview in Ring Magazine with 
his barber, titled "The Man Who Cut's Don King's Hair".

	It had a picture of him standing next to a chair with an axe.  They 
asked him how he prepares for a visit from Don, and he said, "Don calls up, 
tells me he wants the usual, be in about one hour.  When I hear that, I 
immediately start drinkin' a lot of wine, dropping lots of pills, 'cause I 
gotta be sure that I don't know what the hell I'm doing when he gets here, 
so I can get it right."

	We take our hair for granted.  One thing about the hair on your head 
is that you do have to cut it, but there's hair on your body you don't have 
to cut at all.  You know, like your pubic hair.  Your whole life, they stay 
the same length, which saves you a lot of money.  You never have to go into 
a barber shop.  "Say, Joe, how much for a pubic trim?  Stuff's gettin' out 
of hand, man.  Got a job interview tomorrow.  $30!?  I don't want them 
styled, just want 'em cut.  Hey, easy with that blow-dryer, man!"

				   -----

	I remember when I first got my place.  It was exciting to go to the 
supermarket.  I made a few errors when I first went to the market, and I was 
walking down the bread aisle, and I said, "I know what I'll do.  Let me get 
this giant 90-slice loaf.  I don't eat a lot of bread, and this way I won't 
have to buy anymore for about 3 more months."  And I took it home.

	Damn thing turned into penicillin about slice 20.  It had me backing 
out of the kitchen, thinking about science fiction, you know:  "Boy, I'm 
glad I woke up before the bread did."

	But I didn't throw it away.  No, I saved it.  Used it to cure my 
friends.  Whenever one of them called me about VD, I said, "No problem.  
Come on over and I'll give you a slice of toast"

	Once in a while, you run into someone who is an absolute genius at 
what s/he does best.  Well, this is the story about a programmer who 
definitely fits that mold.  I don't remember where I found this particular 
tale, but the first time I saw it was in the early 70s.  I find myself 
wondering who this guy is, and if he is still in programming.  I'd love to 
see examples of source code he might be writing today...

		Real Programmers Don't Use Fortran, Either!

	A recent article devoted to the *macho* side of programming ("Real 
Programmers Don't Use Pascal," by ucbvax!G:tut) made the bald and 
unvarnished statement:  Real Programmers write in Fortran.

	Maybe they do now, in this decadent era of Lite beer, hand 
calculators and "user-friendly" software, but back in the Good Old Days, 
when the term "software" sounded funny and Real Computers were made out of 
drums and vacuum tubes, Real Programmers wrote in machine code.

	Not Fortran.  Not RATFOR.  Not, even, assembly language.  Machine 
Code.  Raw, unadorned, inscrutable hexadecimal numbers.  Directly.

	Lest a whole new generation of programmers grow up in ignorance of 
this glorious past, I feel duty-bound to describe, as best I can through the 
generation gap, how a Real Programmer wrote code.  I'll call him Mel, 
because that was his name.

	I first met Mel when I went to work for Royal McBee Computer Corp, a 
now-defunct subsidiary of the typewriter company.  The firm manufactured the 
LGP-30, a small, cheap (by the standards of the day) drum-memory computer, 
and had just started to manufacture the RPC-4000, a much-improved, bigger, 
better, faster -- drum-memory computer.  Cores cost too much, and weren't 
here to stay, anyway.  (That's why you haven't heard of the company, or the 
computer.)

	I had been hired to write a Fortran compiler for this new marvel and 
Mel was my guide to its wonders.  Mel didn't approve of compilers.  "If a 
program can't rewrite its own code," he asked, "what good is it?"

	Mel had written, in hexadecimal, the most popular computer program 
the company owned.  It ran on the LGP-30 and played blackjack with potential 
customers at computer shows.  Its effect was always dramatic.  The LGP-30 
booth was packed at every show, and the IBM salesmen stood around talking to 
each other.  Whether or not this actually sold computers was a question we 
never discussed.

	Mel's job was to re-write the blackjack program for the RPC-4000.  
(Port? What does that mean?)  The new computer had a one-plus-one addressing 
scheme, in which each machine instruction, in addition to the operation code 
and the address of the needed operand, had a second address that indicated 
where, on the revolving drum, the next instruction was located.  In modern 
parlance, every single instruction was followed by a GO TO!

	Put *that* in Pascal's pipe and smoke it.

	Mel loved the RPC-4000 because he could optimize his code: that is, 
locate instructions on the drum so that just as one finished its job, the 
next would be just arriving at the "read head" and available for immediate 
execution.  There was a program to do that job, an "optimizing assembler," 
but Mel refused to use it.  "You never know where its going to put things," 
he explained, "so you'd have to use separate constants."

	It was a long time before I understood that remark.  Since Mel knew 
the numerical value of every operation code, and assigned his own drum 
addresses, every instruction he wrote could also be considered a numerical 
constant.  He could pick up an earlier "add" instruction, say, and multiply 
by it, if it had the right numeric value.

	His code was not easy for someone else to modify.

	I compared Mel's hand-optimized programs with the same code massaged 
by the optimizing assembly program, and Mel's always ran faster.  That was 
because the "top-down" method of program design hadn't been invented yet, 
and Mel wouldn't have used it anyway.  He wrote the innermost parts of his 
program loops first, so they would get first choice of the optimum address 
locations on the drum.  The optimizing assembler wasn't smart enough to do 
it that way.

	Mel never wrote time-delay loops, either, even when the balky 
Flexowriter required a delay between output characters to work right.  He 
just located instructions on the drum so each successive one was just *past* 
the read head when it was needed; the drum had to execute another complete 
revolution to find the next instruction.  He coined an unforgettable term 
for this procedure.  Although "optimum" is an absolute term, like "unique", 
it became common verbal practice to make it relative: "not quite optimum" or 
"less optimum" or "not very optimum."  Mel called the maximum time-delay 
locations the "most pessimum."

	After he finished the blackjack program and got it to run, ("Even 
the initializer is optimized," he said proudly) he got a Change Request from 
the sales department.  The program used an elegant (optimized) random number 
generator to shuffle the "cards" and deal from the "deck," and some of the 
salesmen felt it was too fair, since sometimes the customers lost.  They 
wanted Mel to modify the program so, at the setting of a sense switch on the 
console, they could change the odds and let the customer win.

	Mel balked.

	He felt this was patently dishonest --- which it was --- and that it 
impinged on his personal integrity as a programmer --- which it did --- so 
he refused to do it.

	The Head Salesman talked to Mel, as did the Big Boss and, at the 
boss's urging, a few Fellow Programmers.  Mel finally gave in and wrote the 
code, but he got the test backwards and, when the sense switch was turned 
on, the program would cheat, winning every time.  Mel was delighted with 
this, claiming his subconscious was uncontrollably ethical, and adamantly 
refused to fix it.

	After Mel had left the company for greener pa$ture$, the Big Boss 
asked me to look at the code and see if I could find the test and reverse 
it.  Somewhat reluctantly, I agreed to look.  Tracking Mel's code was a real 
adventure.

	I have often felt that programming is an art form, whose real value 
can only be appreciated by another versed in the same arcane art;  there are 
lovely gems and brilliant coups hidden from human view and admiration, 
sometimes forever, by the very nature of the process.  You can learn a lot 
about an individual just by reading through his code, even in hexadecimal.  
Mel was, I think, an unsung genius.

	Perhaps my greatest shock came when I found an innocent loop that 
had no test in it.  No test.  *None*.  Common sense said it had to be a 
closed loop, where the program would circle, forever, endlessly.  Program 
control passed right through it, however, and safely out the other side.  It 
took me two weeks to figure it out.

	The RPC-4000 computer had a really modern facility called an index 
register.  It allowed the programmer to write a program loop that used an 
indexed instruction inside;  each time through, the number in the index 
register was added to the address of that instruction, so it would refer to 
the next datum in a series.  He had only to increment the index register 
each time through.

	Mel never used it.  Instead, he would pull the instruction into a 
machine register, add one to its address, and store it back.  He would then 
execute the modified instruction right from the register.  The loop was 
written so this additional execution time was taken into account -- just as 
this instruction finished, the next one was right under the drum's read 
head, ready to go.

	But the loop had no test in it.

	The vital clue came when I noticed the index register bit, the bit 
that lay between the address and the operation code in the instruction word, 
was turned on -- yet Mel never used the index register, leaving it zero all 
the time.  When the light went on it nearly blinded me.

	He had located the data he was working on near the top of memory -- 
the largest locations the instructions could address -- so, after the last 
datum was handled, incrementing the instruction address would make it 
overflow.  The carry would add one to the operation code, changing it to the 
next one in the instruction set: a jump instruction.  Sure enough, the next 
program instruction was in address location zero, and the program went 
happily on its way.

	I haven't kept in touch with Mel, so I don't know if he ever gave in 
to the flood of change that has washed over programming techniques since 
those long-gone days.  I like to think he didn't.  In any event, I was 
impressed enough that I quit looking for the offending test, telling the Big 
Boss I couldn't find it.  He didn't seem surprised.  When I left the 
company, the blackjack program would still cheat if you turned on the right 
sense switch, and I think that's how it should be.  I didn't feel 
comfortable hacking up the code of a Real Programmer

			HOW TO REGAIN YOUR VIRGINITY

	Day 1

	Go out and have a good time.  You may never have one again.

	Day 2

	Behavior modification day.  By the end of today, you may not have 
become a virgin, but you will behave like one.  And, after all, virginity is 
25 percent behavior.

	Behavior modification is based on the theories of the Russian 
physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, who taught his dog how to ring a bell 
when he (the dog) was hungry.  The process is a simple one of learning by 
doing, and is based on reward and punishment.

	Day 3

	Eat grapefruits all day.  This usually does not work, but it's worth 
a try.

	Day 4

	Prepare for mental Virgination.  Derived from an ancient Hindu 
formula that was lost for centuries and was only recently rediscovered by 
the authors of this book, this treatment promises to leave you innocent as a 
lamb.

	 At 7am, to rid your mind of all unclean thoughts accumulated 
overnight, vacuum out your head with a good, sturdy rug attachment.

	Midmorning is a time when many are tempted to go off their Clean 
Thought Regimen.  Don't let this happen to you!  Hang by your feet, shaking 
your head vigorously for half an hour to shake out mental germs.

	8pm:  Time for bed!  But tonight you will be wearing your new 
Thought Pasteurization Earmuffs, which destroy disease-producing bacteria in 
your mind by heating your ears up to 145 degrees Fahrenheit.  Clean dreams!

	Day 5

	Now that you have learned the ways of a virgin and your thoughts are 
clean it is time for you to move forward and become acquainted with the 
Virgin Creed.

			      The Virgin Creed

	A Virgin believes in being clean in thought, word and deed

	A Virgin believes in letting her conscience be her guide and never 
seeking help from consenting adults

	A Virgin believes that a good time the night before will bring a 
MOURNING after

	A Virgin believes that a reproductive organ is not as good as the 
original

	A Virgin believes in docu-dramas but not fantasies

	A Virgin believes in marriage, as long as she and her husband are 
"just friends"

	A Virgin believes she is a kite sailing in the sky on a cloudless 
day in May

	Revenge:  I'll just let the following speak for itself.  If you know 
of any "practical jokes" or "revenge tactics", please let us know about them 
so we can include them in a future issue.

	After all, there are oh so many folks out there who deserve just 
what is coming to them...  :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Animals:  If your mark is an oily cuss with a credibility problem 
you should easily pull of this stunt suggested by good old country boy Emil 
Connally.  It involves a cop, reporters, SPCA folks and some farm animals.

	According to Connally, here's how it works.  You have two marks.  
The prime one is a farm owner with the credibility problem.  We'll call him 
Mr Big.  The secondary mark is a cop who's made an enemy of you.  In this 
case, pick one of your local Attila the Hun cops because he's a bully and 
his ego for a bust will get in the way of his grain-sized brain.

	Call the cop --- try for his home phone even if it's unlisted --- 
and tell him you know about a cock or dog fight that's being held at Mr 
Bigs' farm.  Explain you have no morals against animal fighting (build your 
own macho image) but you lost big money the last time and you think the 
fights are fixed. Mention drugs and booze, too.  Next, call Mr Big and tell 
him you're an anonymous political ally who wants to warn him about some 
people holding dog or cock fights at his farm.  Call reporters and the SPCA 
and tell them all about the fight.  Mention Mr Big and the cop having a 
payoff relationship.  Give everyone the same general arrival time....  never 
be too specific.

	Hopefully, everyone will sort of show up at roughly the same time.  
You might manipulate things so the press and animal lovers show up first.  
Even if a real story doesn't develop, you have scattered some strong seeds 
of distrust.

				   -----

	There is a variation if you want a stronger story.  Find a dog that 
has been hit by a car (already dead, of course) and bury it several days 
before you set up your animal fight scenario at Mr Bigs' place.  Tell the 
reporters and the SPCA where the evidence is buried.  It will be fun to hear 
the two marks talk about these things to the other parties.  Maybe there's a 
story here afterall.

	Dead animals are so useful.  Don't you agree?  A nefarious lady 
known only as Hong Kong Hattie once waited until her mark went to the 
airport for a five-day business trip departure.  Then, using the nefarious 
methods for which she is so famous, Hattie got to the marks' car in the 
airport parking lot and got the lock opened.  She then stuffed a large and 
very dead groundhog into the glovebox.  Hattie locked the car and strolled 
away.  Reportedly, the mark sold his car at quite a financial loss just a 
few days after getting back from his business trip.

				   -----

	One of the plagues for newspaper deliverers is barking, biting dogs 
which attack both kids and their bicycles.  Tom Frickert, today a newspaper 
magnate, but once a paperboy, has a solution.

	"A good quality plastic water pistol filled with freshly-squeezed 
lemon juice is the ticket," Frickart says with a chuckle.  "You shoot the 
felonious furball right in the eyes and it'll soon stop the canine 
harassment.

	"I once shot a nasty big cur with the juice and he never bothered me 
again.... used to hide under his masters' porch whenever I came down the 
sidewalk to deliver the newspaper."  If your neighbor's constantly yowling 
and howling dog(s) bother you, congratulations, you're normal.  But, unlike 
most who sit and suffer, you can call the local SPCA and tell them how the 
neighbor mistreats the animal.  Hold your phone near the window so the SPCA 
official can hear the "evidence" right from the source.

	I once heard that peanuts in the gas tank could create lots of 
havoc, seems that they have a neutral (or just slightly negative) buoyancy 
in gas. Supposedly they will get sucked down to the intake and cut the flow 
of gas down, the car balks and the sloshing knocks them loose and the flow 
is normal again.  This causes the poor owner of the vehicle to replace all 
sorts of things trying to correct the problem (all to no avail).  Much 
better than sugar, and much more costly in the long run

				   -----

	At work, we once inflated a 12ft weather balloon in somebody's 
office.  It looks very impressive (especially as a surprise) and is very 
easy to "undo" when the joke is over.  A much more radical prank that I 
heard of was pulled at some university.  They lined a room with a strong 
clear plastic lining and filled it with water (complete with fish).

	Hmmm, as I recall, the entire dorm room wasn't filled with water. (I 
HATE when stories get all twisted!) Using chicken wire as a frame, and 
polyethlene sheets "welded" together, CalTech students build essentially an 
almost-room-sized swiming pool structure. They then proceeded to balance the 
pH to that of sea water, and added 3 or 4 live sand-sharks.

============================================================================

	The news...  such an integral part of our life, and yet we tend to 
ignore it so blindly...  If it weren't for news, we wouldn't be able to 
bring you such well-written items as these you have before you...

	Behold...

	Two pit bulldogs were in custody in the Santa Clara County Animal 
Shelter yesterday, charged with chewing the tires off a Sunnyvale police car 
while an embarrassed policeman was trapped in the car.

	Patrolman Ruben Grijalva didn't want to talk about his encounter 
with the 35-pound dogs - Lady, 3, and her son Isaac, 2.  Bill Manley, an 
animal control officer, had to stop laughing to discuss the scene he was 
called to Sunday morning.

	"There was this patrol car in the middle of the intersection with 
its red lights on and it had one flat tire in front, with a hubcap lying in 
the road, and two pit bulls chewing on the back tires and I saw all the 
tires go flat.  The officer (Grijalva) couldn't get out of the car."  When 
he got out of his truck, Manley said, the dogs ran toward him.  "I hollered 
at them and they ran away, into a yard."

	He went to the house adjacent to the yard, knocked on the door and 
was greeted by the owner of the dogs, who said he had no idea the dogs were 
loose.  "They're friendly dogs," Noel Alfaro, 17, said.  "They just don't 
like uniforms"

	The teller at Chino Valley Bank said the two women sent the stickup 
note to her through a pneumatic tube and did not seem troubled by the delay 
in getting their loot

	A University of Wisconsin student routed from his perch near the top 
of a 1000-foot television tower said he had no intention of jumping.  All we 
wanted was a good night's sleep.

	David Marsh, 20, who has worked as a steeplejack, couldn't 
understand all the fuss when police converged on the scene Sunday.  The 
local Crisis Intervention Center and Marsh's mother were called to the scene 
to help talk him down.

	But Dane County Sheriff's Detective Robert Doyle said Marsh, who had 
been sitting on a platform about 30 feet from the top of the tower, scooted 
down "like he was on a slick ladder.  He said he climbed the tower at 2am 
Sunday to sleep, and has done it many nights previously because he claims he 
sleeps better on the tower than at home.

	"Never before has he been spotted"

	By now, almost every Italian-American of any note has been 
interviewed for reaction to Ferraro.  Actor Don Novello, aka Father Guido 
Sarducci, was no exception.  Asked whether he was proud to learn an Italian-
American was on the ticket, he said, "Yes, I am.  But I was hoping it was 
Fabian"

	It was late, and the convention was in its ninth hour when 
Representative Steven Solarz of New York stepped to the rostrum to be 
eloquent before nearly 12,000 empty seats.  He was reminded, the congressmen 
said, of the political candidates' night that featured 30 speakers.  By the 
time the 29th speaker got up, only one man was still in the audience.  Why 
was he still there?

	"Because," said the man, "I'm the next speaker"

	"None of the above" was the winning candidate for the Republican 
nomination for Nevada's lone congressional seat in the state primary 
Tuesday.  But by state law, the second-place finisher, Walden Earhart, will 
be the candidate on the November ballot.

	Earhart and Dart Anthony, both unknown politicians, collected 9,838 
and 8,096 ballots, but 16,022 voters marked their ballots "none of these", 
as allowed by state law.  The option was first put to the test in May's 
presidential primary in Nevada, collecting more than 5% of the total vote

	And, last but not least, a few words of wisdom.  It's true that 
mankind does not live by bread alone, and we've pretty much proved that 
axiom with these unusual masterpieces.  To quote someone much smarter than 
myself (hi, kalen!):  "I am non-denominational --- I accept all forms of 
currency.  So, open your hearts and empty your pockets!"

	A wonderful sentiment, don't you think?
