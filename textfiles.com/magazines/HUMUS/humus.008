	August is a wonderful month for humus breedings, it appears...  so 
many different categories of humusites that it's hard to know where to 
begin...  Well, I guess the beginning is as good a place as any:

	Elisha Graves Otis (August 3rd, 1811) gave us the elevator;  
Nicholas-Jacque Conte (4th, 1755), the modern pencil;  John Heathcoat (7th, 
1783), lace-making machinery (which, if I remember my history eventually led 
to computers as we know them today);  Rudi Gernreich (8th, 1922), a man 
definitely head of his time, with the 1st women's topless swimsuits and the 
miniskirt;  and the 16th of August, 1884, saw the birth of Hugo Gernsback, 
one of the men chiefly responsible for turning science fiction into an 
almost-respectable literary art form...

	Neil Armstrong began his long step toward astronautic immortality 
(5th, 1930) only four days before Betty Boop, that curvaceous lady of the 
black and white movie set...  Cecil B DeMille, director of God AND Charleton 
Heston, was born on the 12th in 1881...  Lucy Stone (13th, 1818), one of the 
original pioneers in Women's Rights...  Napoleon Bonaparte (1769) and Julia 
Child (1912) share the 15th, if only separated by a few years...  Mae West, 
the "...come up and see me sometime" vixen of the silver screen, born the 
17th in 1892...  Ray Bradbury (22nd, 1920), a man who sees things 
differently than the average human...  Althea Gibson (25th, 1927), 
definitely a lady before her times, was the first black tennis player to win 
a major event (the US Open, I believe)...  and, last, but not least, the 
REAL creator of the Frankenstein monster, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, born 
on the 30th in 1797...  If you are interested in horror, look her up...

	The first of August has always been a busy day, historically:  the 
first US Census (1790);  the Whisky Rebellion (1794);  burials were 
prohibited within the San Francisco city limits on this day in 1901);  
California (if you believe this, I've some prime mountain-top view swamp 
land for sale) introduced its sales tax for Education (1953);  and, First 
Class postage went up to 4 cents (1958)...

	Columbus left Europe in search of spices and silks on the 3rd 
(1492)...  wonder what he would think of his "discovery" were he around 
today?  And we think that Wrong Way Corrigan got up on the wrong side of his 
vehicle?

	Dom Perignon invents something fizzy for Maurice Chevalier to talk 
about (champagne, on the 4th in 1693)...  The US levies its first income tax 
(3% of income over $800...  can we wish for a touch of the old days 
returning?) on the 5th in 1861...  The Atomic Era truly begins with the 
slagging of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (6th and 9th, 1945)...

	The only national holiday to be celebrated in August occurs on the 
8th...  it's the anniversary of the resignation from the presidency by 
Richard Milhous Nixon...  I set off fireworks and have a hellacious barbeque 
with as many friends as I can cram into my abode...

	Voyager II has a busy month:  on the 20th (1977), it gets launched 
without too much difficulty...  on the 25th (1981), it flies past Saturn 
(and what an awesome sight it was)...  it is scheduled to fly past Neptune 
on the 24th of August, 1989, and barring anything unforeseen happening, it 
should do just that...

	Lessee, what else?  International Left-Handers Day is on the 13th...  
Woodstock, >THE< music festival, began in New York on the 16th (1969)...  
Hawaii became a state on the 21st in 1959, and on the 22nd began to have 
doubts as to continuation of statehood...  Pompeii was on the wrong end of a 
rather large lava flow on the 24th (0079) and the waffle iron was invented 
1790 years later (1869)...  coincidence?  Krakatoa, WEST of Java, was a few 
days' late (27th, 1883), but more than made up for it, making Etna look 
like a child's science project...  THEN, I hear about the first recorded 
occurrence of a comet hitting the sun, releasing energy in the neighborhood 
of one million hydrogen bombs worth of fireworks (what will happen next?  
I'm afraid I don't want to be around to find out), making Krakatoa look like 
a flint piker (30th, 1979)...  you'll have to go a long way to get me to 
believe this is coincidence...  :)

	Oh, yeah...  mark this one down, anniversary buffs:  27 August 1928 
is the date that Kellogg-Briand Pact was signed...  You might remember this 
one as being the international treaty that 60 nations signed, agreeing to 
outlaw war...  Real Soon Now...

	My, the things you can learn by reading The Humus 
Report...  Boggles the mind...

============================================================================

	THE PURPLE HORSE

	Christopher Smegley was a stable boy for the Rappaport family.  He 
was a good stable boy.  He kept the horses brushed and exercised and watered 
and fed.  He kept the stalls clean.  And he always noticed when the oats 
were running low or a saddle needed repair.  But most of all he noticed 
Betty Rappaport.  Whenever Betty Rappaport was near the stable, Christopher 
would stop what he was doing and watch Betty.  He was always helpful and 
friendly to Betty Rappaport.

	"Hello, Miss Rappaport," Christopher would say.  And Betty would 
look away without answering.

	"I brushed your horse today, Miss Rappaport."

	"Beautiful day today, Miss Rappaport."

	But seldom did Christopher receive a smile, a nod, or any sign that 
she knew he had spoken.  Christopher Smegley, stable boy, simply did not 
exist for Betty Rappaport.

	Christopher knew that he was only temporarily a stable boy, that 
behind his simple outward appearance stood the real Christopher Smegley: 
suave, cool, sophisticated, sexy.  He knew that if Betty would only notice 
him, she would recognize all his fine qualities and would fall helplessly in 
love with him.  His only problem was to make her notice him.  He knew that 
he would have to do something unusual, something spectacular, to win the 
attention and finally the love of Betty Rappaport.

	He decided to do something so spectacular that Betty could not 
ignore it and would have to come to him for help.  But what could he do?

	Day after day he worried about this problem.  Each day that he 
watched Betty Rappaport come to the stables he worried more about what to 
do.  Finally he developed a plan:

	He would paint Betty's horse purple!

	What a perfect plan, he decided.  Of course!  That is the answer.  
He will come to the stable very early on a day that he knows Betty will be 
coming, and he will paint the horse purple from nose to tail and from hoof 
to mane.  He might even paint the horse's hoofs red.  Perhaps he will braid 
the tail, paint it yellow, weave daisies into it.

	Then, Christopher thought, he will sit on the fence with great 
dignity, with utmost confidence, and with just the right degree of cool, and 
will await the arrival of lovely Miss Betty Rappaport.  Betty will arrive, 
as she always does, looking sweet and pretty as she walks past him on the 
fence.  He will greet her, as he always does, and she will ignore him, of 
course.

	Betty will go into the stable to see her horse.  She will discover 
that her beautiful brown horse is now a peculiar passionate-purple horse 
with red hoofs and a braided yellow tail with daisies.  She will scream and 
she will run to the very same Christopher Smegley whom she has ignored for 
so long--for, after all, he is the stable boy--and she will cry, "Oh, help!  
Help!  My horse is purple!"

	Christopher, suave and sophisticated stable boy that he is, will 
soothe her, he thought.  She will be confused and angry, but he will assure 
her that everything is all right, that all will turn out for the best, and 
that eventually she will be glad her horse is purple.  She will complain 
that he had no right to tamper with her horse.  But Christopher, being at 
heart a very cool, sexy and suave fellow, will draw upon all his long 
suppressed powers of coolness, sexiness and suaveness and will soothe her.

	She will slowly succumb to his charm, but she will still be upset, 
so Christopher will suggest that they saddle her purple horse while he 
saddles a plain brown horse, and that they ride together so that she can see 
how truly wonderful it is to have a purple horse with red hoofs and a yellow 
braided tail with daisies.

	She will protest at first, of course, but eventually she will agree 
to ride with him.  Soon they will come to a cluster of trees surrounding a 
deep pool of spring water where they will stop to drink.

	Christopher will suggest that they swim.

	Betty will protest at first, of course, as she won't have a swimming 
suit.  But Christopher will promise to look away until she is in the water 
and he will be so charming that eventually she will agree to swim.

	Once in the water, Christopher thought, he will be put to his 
greatest test.  He must remain cool, suave, sophisticated, and the perfect 
gentleman.  He must inspire confidence, trust, and even love.  So, 
maintaining his great cool and his perfect suaveness, he will swim with her.  
Then he will suggest that they rest together on a blanket under a nearby 
tree.

	She will protest at first, of course, but ultimately she will agree, 
and together they will spread a blanket under the tree.  With their arms 
around one another on the blanket by the tree near the pool of spring water 
with the brown horse and the purple horse nearby, Betty Rappaport will be 
utterly overcome and all of Christopher's dream will come true.

	As Christopher thought about his plan, he knew that it would work.  
It was a perfect plan.  It was so cleverly contrived and would be so 
masterfully executed that it had to work.  How perfectly brilliant of her, 
he thought, to devise such a plan.

	Yes, he decided, he would do it.

	So Christopher bought some thick purple paint, some small cans of 
red and yellow paint, and some paint brushes.  He waited for a day that he 
knew Betty Rappaport would be coming to the stable.  He picked some white 
and yellow daisies.  Then he painted Betty's horse purple with red hoofs and 
yellow tail, and he braided daisies into the tail.

	Perfect, he told himself with satisfaction.  How absolutely perfect, 
he kept telling himself as he sat on the fence waiting for Betty Rappaport.

	He was almost bursting with anticipation as, finally, he saw Betty 
walking up the winding path toward the stable.

	"Good morning, Miss Rappaport," he said.  Betty ignored him, of 
course.

	Christopher was almost beside himself as he watched her enter the 
stable.

	She must be approaching the stall now, he thought.

	His heart raced.

	He felt lightheaded as he knew Betty must, right now, be standing 
beside her purple and red and yellow horse.  He could hardly contain himself 
as he knew she must, any moment, come to him for help in what must be the 
first of a marvelous series of events which will finally culminate in love 
and even marriage with this lovely girl whom he has worshipped for so long.

	He heard her scream.  "Stable boy!  Oh, stable boy!"

	His heart bounding, Christopher stepped cooly from the fence.  "I 
must maintain my cool," he told himself.  "I must remain suave, 
sophisticated, debonaire, sexy."

	With total suaveness he waited.  So sweet, he thought.  So pretty.  
Helpless.  Lovely.  "Today she will become mine," he thought as he watched 
her run toward him.

	"Stable boy!  Stable boy!  Oh, Stable boy, my horse is purple!"

	"I know," he said.  "Let's fuck"

	A young city girl was vacationing in the country and became friendly 
with a farmer boy.  One evening as they were strolling across a pasture, 
they saw a cow and calf rubbing noses in the accepted bovine fashion.

	"Ah," said the farmer boy, "that sight makes me want to do the 
same."

	"Well, go ahead," said the girl, "it's your cow"

============================================================================

	When one reviewer gets ahold of a package with preconceived notions, 
it's likely that almost anything can happen...  As is evident in the next 
piece for your perusal...

				   -----

	Everyone has heard of it.  A lot of people swear by it.  It's used 
in the office and in the home.  It's packaged with Kaypro computers and by 
next summer may even be included with Cabbage Patch Dolls.  Like it or not, 
Wordstar holds a special place within the software industry.

	I never used Wordstar until I started this review and, frankly, I 
was shocked at the program's shortcomings.  For a program that has been on 
the market so long, it is unacceptably lacking.  It has always had the 
reputation of being hard to learn, but this is simply ridiculous.  To put it 
bluntly, as far as I'm concerned:  WORDSTAR IS THE WORST SPREADSHEET PROGRAM 
ON THE MARKET.

	The program doesn't even look like a spreadsheet.  The familiar row 
numbers and column letters running across the left and top of the screen are 
not present at all.  Rather, the user is presented with one huge column that 
fills the entire width of the screen.

	A column's width is adjusted by a pair of commands known as Set Left 
Margin <^OL> and Set Right Margin <^OR>.  The default width of a cell is 80 
decimal places, but they can be widened to accommodate numbers as long as 
256 decimal places.  The program even has a "wrap around" feature that will 
continue a number onto the next line if it goes beyond 80 characters.  
Although this is a neat feature, I doubt if many businesses deal with 
numbers larger than 80 decimals in the first place.

	Once I accepted the radical appearance of the spreadsheet, I turned 
to the user manual to learn how to set up a worksheet.  This is where is the 
program REALLY fails.  THE MANUAL IS SO BAD THAT MOST SPREADSHEET FUNCTIONS 
ARE NOT EVEN DISCUSSED!  Such common functions as Future Value, Net Present 
Value, and Cumulative Total are nowhere to be found.  In fact, just about 
the only section in the manual that even remotely relates to spreadsheets is 
a chapter devoted to decimal tabs.  The section shows how to line up rows of 
numbers underneath each other, but the directions end there.  I never did 
find out how to total the columns.

	The only strong point of the program is its flexibility to type text 
into the cells as headings and comments.  Indeed, the manual seems to deal 
almost exclusively with this part of the worksheet building process.  In my 
opinion, Micropro went way overboard in this area.  Few other spreadsheet 
companies allow such nice frills as Boldface <^PB> and Superscript <^PT> 
headings.  But Wordstar will let you even add footnotes!  Footnotes in a 
spreadsheet!  Talk about silly frills...  You think THAT'S silly frill?  By 
using the "Read File" Block command <^KR>, the program will add row and 
column titles already stored on disk into new worksheets thereby saving the 
time it would take to retype them.  Micropro even sells an optional add-on 
module called Spellstar to check the spelling of your header names.  Neat 
ideas but, seriously now, who needs them?

	After spending a week trying (and failing) to get Wordstar to do 
even the simplest spreadsheet work, I have given up.  All the talk of the 
program being hard to learn is an understatement;  it is nearly impossible 
since the manuals are useless in their present form.  Micropro should have 
concentrated less on frills and more on spreadsheet basics.  I'm sure the 
program works well once you learn how to use it (after all, it's still 
selling well), but it all seems too confusing and not worth the trial and 
error.

	At this time I cannot recommend Wordstar for serious spreadsheet 
use.  In its current version, it should never have been released

	Once upon a time, when I was training to be a mathematician, a group 
of us bright young students taking number theory discovered the names of the 
smaller prime numbers.

	 2:  The Odd Prime ---
		It's the only even prime, therefore is odd.  QED
	 3:  The True Prime ---
		Lewis Carroll: "If I tell you 3 times, it's true"
	31:  The Arbitrary Prime ---
		Determined by unanimous unvote.  We needed an arbitrary 
prime in case the prof asked for one, and so had an election.  91 received 
the most votes (well, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i the next most.  However, 31 
was the only candidate to receive none at all.

	Since the composite numbers are formed from primes, their qualities 
are derived from those primes.  So, for instance, the number 6 is "odd but 
true", while the powers of 2 are all extremely odd numbers

	Well, another presidential election year is upon us and I'm not very 
excited about it.  All you have to do is look at the qualifications of the 
clowns and feebs who are running and you can understand my lack of 
enthusiasm.  We need an exciting candidate, a man who will inspire us and 
boldly lead us into the 1990s.  We need a man with courage and integrity.  
We need a bold and decisive leader.  We need Popeye the Sailor.

Consider his qualifications:

	. 1.  He is a veteran.  Popeye served honorably in World War II, as 
		did John F Kennedy

	. 2.  He is an entertainer with many films to his credit, like 
		Ronald Reagan

	. 3.  He is a loving family man.  His son Swee' Pea is adopted

	. 4.  He is a man of the people like Jimmy Carter

	. 5.  He is a nutritionist and a vegetarian

	. 6.  He is unpretentious.  "I yam what I yam" is his motto

	. 7.  Like John Wayne, Popeye believes in a strong America and will 
		not be bullied

	. 8.  He has a distinct speaking voice

	. 9.  He has strong arms

	.10.  Wimpy will make an ideal running mate.  We have had wimpy 
		vice-presidents for decades

	Here is a man of whom nothing bad can be said.  Popeye is the living 
embodiment of all of America`s virtues.  Popeye the Sailor is the IDEAL 
CANDIDATE to boldly lead us into the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.

	SUPPORT POPEYE THE SAILOR FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA.  America needs Popeye NOW!  With your support, Popeye the Sailor 
can win the 1988 presidential election.  Perhaps in January 1989 spinach 
will replace Ronald Reagan as the national vegetable

	Several Nez Perce County deputies apparently were moonstruck the 
other morning when they turned in a call that a fire-like glow filled the 
sky about 15 miles east of Lewiston, near Lapwai.  Deputies said the glow 
came from areas that previously had burned.  They reported that the closer 
they got, the bigger the glow.

	After a few minutes of silence, a radio dispatcher asked the 
deputies more about the fire.

	It was a false alarm, the deputies radioed back.  They had seen the 
moon on the horizon

	Forget Barbie and Ken.  Gay Bob has come out of the closet.

	What's billed as the world's first gay doll stands 13 inches tall, 
wears one earring, a custom-made flannel cowboy shirt, denim jeans and 
cowboy boots and costs $15.  He sports a blond crewcut and, according to his 
inventor, Harvey Rosenberg, "looks like a cross between Paul Newman and 
Robert Redford."

	A former NYC advertising executive, the 37-year-old Rosenberg 
developed Gay Bob last September.  To date, he has made 10,000 of the dolls, 
which he has sold through mail-order ads in magazines aimed at the 
homosexual community.  But Gay Bob is beginning to catch on in respectable, 
Middle American retail stores.  "It doesn't matter if you're gay or not," 
says Rosenberg.  "Gay Bob can help you come out of the closet."

	Gay Bob (who is anatomically "correct") comes packaged in a closet.  
He also has a wardrobe, clothes catalogue, songbook and book about his life.  
"Hello, boys and girls," the narrative reads.  "Gay people use the 
expression 'coming out of the closet' to explain the fact that they're no 
longer ashamed of being gay."

	Rosenberg says everyone from business executives to construction 
workers need to come out of the closet, an expression he uses for being 
honest about what people really want to do with their lives.  "Men have to 
liberate themselves from the traditional sexual roles," said Rosenberg, who 
says he is not gay.  Rosenberg said the traditional male seemed to be the 
most attracted to the doll.  "The more macho, the more taboo, the more 
exciting homosexuality is," he said, adding that the first thing most 
purchasers do is take off the clothes of the dolls.  "People are fascinated 
by homosexuality, but they're afraid of it."

	Rosenberg, president of Gizmo Development, spent $10,000 to develop 
Gay Bob.  He was so pleased with the result that he promptly designed a 
whole family of "permissive dolls.  Each doll comes in his/her own space," 
Rosenberg said.  Straight Steve, for example, comes in a powder-blue leisure 
suit and sits in the living room in front of the television set.  Liberated 
Libby sits in a bedroom

	Do you have a difficult time giving up foods you know are bad for 
you?  Take a lesson from the animal kingdom.  Hundreds of sheep in 
California's Antelope Valley owe their lives to tasting bad.  That's because 
the coyotes that had been preying on them have learned to loathe mutton.

	Dr Stuart R Ellins, an associate professor of psychology at Cal 
State San Bernadino, felt that coyotes could be turned off sheep if they 
became ill from eating the animals' meat.  Ellins and his students placed 
sheep carcasses injected with an emetic in sheep grazing areas.  A half-hour 
later, after the coyotes ate the meat, they became nauseated --- and 
apparently learned to associate nausea with the taste of the meat.  And 
Ellins says they no longer attack the live animals, either.

	Ellins says that the coyotes learn their lesson after just one 
experience because of their adaptability.  "If the animal gets sick from a 
particular food and he's lucky enough to survive," he says, "he'll never eat 
that food again"

	A doctor has advice for a bald Soviet engineer:  horse manure will 
not grow hair.  Neither will onion and garlic salves or kerosene.

	According to Dr I Shakhtmeister, who writes an advise column in a 
Soviet magazine, the 40-year-old engineer's problems began when his hair 
began to fall out and friends brought out their best home remedies.  He 
rubbed onion and garlic salves into his scalp.  He gave himself castor oil 
scalp treatments.  He tried rubbing in mixtures that included both kerosene 
and horse manure.  It all failed, the rest of his hair fell out and 
contracted a skin disease.

	In a column headlined "So As To Have Something To Go To The Barber 
With," Dr Shakhtmeister used this fine example of failure to advise others 
that although hair loss is common, there is some hope.  "At times, a 
seemingly harmless habit may lead to hair dropping out," he said.

	For example, he said he treated a 24-year-old student for hair loss 
and learned it was caused by the fact that the man never wore a hat, even in 
the coldest weather.

	Other causes of hair loss, according to Dr Shakhtmeister, include 
heavy drinking, poor diet, not enough rest, and treatment of the hair with 
harmful, toxic substances --- particularly those of the manure-kerosene 
genre

	A man whose Cadillac was stolen from a shopping mall parking lot 
took out a newspaper advertisement saying the thief can keep the car --- if 
he returns the pregnant rattlesnake under the seat. 

	Kidd Brewer, a developer, says the 1976 El Dorado convertible is an 
expensive collector's model.  "If whoever took my 1976 red Cadillac 
convertible with the white top from Crabtree Mall parking lot August 9 will 
return my pet pregnant rattlesnake Cleopatra from under the seat, they can 
keep the car," Brewer said in the ad sunday in The News and Observer in 
Raleigh. 

	Brewer said Monday he was gone from his car only about 15 minutes 
when he discovered it was stolen.  While known for a sense of humor, the 76-
year-old Brewer insists he is not joking about Cleopatra, or the impending 
nest of young rattlers

	An agricultural geneticist has come up with a square ear of corn --- 
to join the square watermelon and the square tomato.

	Wallace Galinat said he got the idea from an airline stewardess who 
told him airlines don't serve corn-on-the-cob to passengers because it rolls 
off the plate.  He went to work developing square corn from teosinte, the 
ancestor of corn.

	His product is a small ear about the size of a carrot with only four 
rows of kernels.  "The butter stays in there, and spreads over the kernels," 
said Galinat

	They had a contest at the Jack Tarr Hotel last night that would have 
curdled the blood of the Ayatollah Khomeini.  In the hotel's California 
Room, two dozen men paraded up and down a platform in bathing suits, doled 
out innuendo as well as business cards and generally strutted their stuff 
before an embarrassingly adoring audience of about 100 women, who paid $7.50 
each to gush and titter and cheer at the spectacle.

	The occasion was the San Francisco Pageant of Men Watchers, Inc, an 
organization that claims a worldwide membership of 5000 women who value 
"neat smiles, super suits and great bods."

	"Mr Mucho Macho is not who we really care about," said president 
Suzy Mallery, a bubbly 42-year-old redhead, wide of smile and lot of bodice, 
who founded the group five years ago.  Although she said a similar pageant 
attracted 1200 watchers in San Diego recently, Mallery denied speculation 
that last night's low turnout might be due to the fact that many of San 
Francisco's manwatchers also happen to be male.  "We tend to get very 
straight people.  This is really for women."

	The male contestants were divided into two categories:  "Fresh and 
Fabulous" (age 18 to 35), and "Suave and Sophisticated" (35 and up).  There 
were no talent contests, but eight female judges also designated a "Mr 
Goodlegs".  The volunteer contestants included a news producer at KGO radio, 
a British man seeking a marriage of convenience to stay in the country and a 
turbaned Indian guru who "likes skiing, swimming and single women."

	Mallery insisted that men enjoy being sex symbols, but at least one 
of the contestants indicated he entered "simply to do something crazy."

	Grand prizes included a year's worth of hairstyling, a two-day 
Carmel vacation and a photographic modeling course.  Runner-up prizes tended 
to emphasize self-improvement and included a three-month membership at a 
fitness center, a hairstyling "make-over", a half-day session with an image 
consultant and dance lessons

	A 33-year-old Puyallup man goofed up his robbery of a Pierce County 
grocery store about as thoroughly as possible.

	His first error last night violated one of the basic rules of 
robbers --- hide your identity.  This gunman left his billfold and 
identification in the store when he fled with the loot.  When he discovered 
that error, he tried to correct it by returning to the scene of his robbery, 
said Pierce County sheriff's detective John Clark.  Just as he discovered 
the Graham-area grocery store was surrounded by sheriff's deputies, his 
car's engine died.  Carrying money taken at gunpoint from the store's cash 
register and safe, the robber got lucky.

	A passing motorist picked him up as a hitchhiker.  At another 
convenience store, the motorist left the engine running when he ran in to 
make a purchase.  The robber took the car, but then ran into a ditch and 
fled on foot.  He attempted to steal another car from a nearby home and 
kidnap a woman and her teenage daughter.  But then the robber let the 
daughter return to the house to get her purse and as she did that, her 
mother saw the robber was distracted and she ran away, Clark said.

	Officers hot on the robber's trail arrived at that point, fired 
several shots into the car he never had time to steal, recovered the loot 
and led him to jail in handcuffs

	And, last but not least, a few words of wisdom.  It's true that 
mankind does not live by bread alone, and we've pretty much proved that 
axiom with these unusual masterpieces.  To quote someone much smarter than 
myself (hi, kalen!):  "I am non-denominational --- I accept all forms of 
currency.  So, open your hearts and empty your pockets!"

	A wonderful sentiment, don't you think?

our survival...

	We leave you now with a few thoughts...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Happiness (n):  An agreeable sensation arising from contemplating 
the misery of another

	Happiness is a tight pussy

	Happiness is excitement that has found a settling-down place, but 
with a little corner that keeps flapping around

	Happiness is having friends who laugh at your stories when they're 
not so funny and sympathize with you in your troubles even when they're not 
so bad

	Happiness isn't having everything you want, it's wanting what you 
have

	Happiness is seeing your boss's picture on the back of a milk carton

	Happiness is when your neighbor takes 1600 slides of his European 
vacation --- with his lens cap on


...until next month...
