An Introduction Would Be In Order:

	Hello, there, fellow friends of weird.  We are very happy to bring 
to you the strangest and most absurd that we can find in a format pleasing 
to the inquiring mind.  We will attempt to bring to you items of focus, 
items for the discriminating thought process that some of us have (usually 
after we order a Big Mac and fries), items with little social redeeming 
value.  These are our goals, and we wish you to become a small part in this 
orchestration.

	If those among you would kindly send in junk that you have no other 
use for, stuff that you read and find humorous, filth that no one else will 
take, stories absurd or preposterous, news that isn't fit to line 
litterboxes anywhere, if you would send those gems to us here at The Humus 
Report, we'd appreciate it.  Our address will be given to you near the end 
of our report.  We will cull from the post office box all death threats and 
denunciations, and print what we can of whatever is left.  The rest is up to 
you...

	We would appreciate it if:  (1) the sending of copyrighted material 
for publication was sent ONLY if you also send along a legal release for us 
to use that material;  (2) if you should see non-attributed copyrighted 
material in our stuff, please let us know ASAP so we can take appropriate 
actions;  (3) if you like what we do here, please donate whatever you feel 
appropriate, so that we can continue to bring you this stuff month after 
month...

	I also have a program called CKP-MSG.ARC which contains virtually 
everything you will see here and then some.  For a nominal cost per year, I 
will provide the latest copy of the ibm/compat program AND the latest 
updates of the datafile to you...  address inquiries about this program 
and/or the datafile to the address near the end of our report...

	And now, on with the show...  This show is being brought to you by:

	January and February, in history, seem to have been filled with a 
variety of birthdates of people who have provided the world with humus 
galore.

	January birthdates include Sherlock Holmes and King Camp Gillette, 
inventor of the safety razor (05 Jan);  the first coming of Elvis Presley, 
the staple of grocery store rags, without which they would all probably 
become bankrupt within weeks (08 Jan 1935);  Muhammed Ali Cassius Clay (17 
Jan 1942);  Thomas Watson, who Alexander Bell needed at the other end of the 
invention, without which "Watson, come here, I need you" would have no 
meaning today (18 Jan 1854);  and entertainers par excellence in Nathan 
Birnbaum (George Burns, 20 Jan 1896), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (23 Jan 1756), 
and Claude William Dukenfield (WC Fields, 29 Jan 1880).

	January events include National Trivia Day (04 Jan), National 
Nothing Day (16 Jan), Reindeer Day (20 Jan), and National Handwriting Day 
(23 Jan).  

	Remember when:  First Class postage was raised from 4 cents to 5 
cents (07 Jan 1963), and First Class postage went from 5 cents to 6 cents 
(07 Jan 1968)?  A candy bar was a nickel, and pinball games were three for a 
quarter?

	The Battle of New Orleans made a hero out of Andrew Jackson (the War 
of 1812 had ended on 24 Dec 1814, but nobody knew that) occurred on 08 Jan 
1815.  News seems to have travelled slowly in the dark ages...  Few outside 
of San Francisco will remember Norton I, Emperor of the US, but he died on 
08 Jan 1880.  Look him up at the local library.  He will be worth it...  For 
all those who've ever listened to an accordian player, you have Anthony Foss 
to blame for it.  He acquired a patent for the windbag on 13 Jan 1854...  13 
Jan 1920 finds a NY Times Editorial saying rockets will never fly...  
coincidentally, 13 Jan 1971, Apollo 14 is launched (what was that about 
rockets?)...  29 Jan 1904 marks the date when the first athletic letters 
were given to Univ of Chicago football team.  Contrary to popular belief, 
they did not consist mainly of Ds and Fs...

	February births include Ronald Wilson Reagan, the president that 
makes Dwight David Eisenhower look like a good president (06 Feb 1911) and 
John Harvey Kellogg, a physician who inspired the flaked cereal industry (26 
Feb 1852)...

	Someone thought that the arrival in London of the SS Strathleven 
with 1st successful shipment of frozen mutton from Australia on 02 Feb 1880 
was worth remembering, so we will, for no reason whatsoever...  They also 
thought snow fall in San Francisco was noteworthy (05 Feb 1887), so it will 
also be included...  Washington's Birth Anniversary was the first national 
birthdate to be screwed with by the national government, so we never know 
when he was born anymore, just that it will always be sometime late in 
February...  National Bun Day is on the 18th in Iceland...

	Oh, yeah.  For those of you with these signs of insecurity:

	Capricorn :  You're not in the mood for small talk today.  The 
booby-trap you placed in the mailbox, however, might be taking things just a 
tad too far...

	Aquarius :  A sense of duty may be involved in connection with a 
trip.  Your translation job between the local constabulary and a tourist 
will keep the tourist behind bars for years.  Misunderstandings seem to run 
rampant.  You thought you were saying, "he didn't do it"...  they thought 
you said "he's as guilty as the day is long"...

	For what it's worth...

	Here is the text of an article by a former Canadian university

excerpted the most compelling examples of original scholarship and spelling.

                         When Life Reeked With Joy
                            By Anders Henrickson

	One of the most hilarious forms of comedy, a favorite with most of 
us, is the blooper.  And some of the best come from the pens of college 
freshmen.  Following are some inspired examples:

	During the Middle Ages, every body was middle aged.  Church and 
state were cooperatic.  Middle Evil society was made up of monks, lords, and 
surfs.  It is unfortunate that we do not have a medivel European laid out on 
a table before us, ready for dissection.  After a revival of infantile 
commerce slowly creeped into Europe, merchants appeared.  Some were sitters 
and some were drifters.  They roamed from town to town exposing themselves 
and organizing big fairies in the countryside.  Mideval people were violent.  
Murder during this Period was nothing.  Everybody killed someone.  England 
fought numerously for land in France and ended up wining and losing.  The 
Crusades were a series of military expaditions made by Christians seeking to 
free the holy land (the "Home Town" of Christ) from the Islams.

	In the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen were perpendicular.  A class of 
yeowls arose.  Finally, Europe caught the Black Death.  The bubonic plague 
is a social disease in the sense that it can be transmitted by intercourse 
and other etceteras.  It was spread from port to port by infected rats.  
Victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks.  The plague also 
helped the emergance of the English language as the national language of 
England, France and Italy.

	The Middle Ages slimpared to a halt.  The renasence bolted in from 
the blue.  Life reeked with joy.  Italy became robust, and more individuals 
felt the value of their human being.  Italy, of course, was much closer to 
the rest of the world thanks to Northern Europe.  Man was determined to 
civilise himself and his brothers, even if heads had to roll!  It became 
sheik to be educated.  Art was on a more associated level.  Europe was full 
of incredable churches with great art bulging out their doors.  Renaissance 
merchants were beautiful and almost life-like.

	The Reformnation happened when German nobles resented the idea that 
tithes were going to Papal France or the Pope, thus enriching Catholic 
coiffures.  Traditions had become oppressive so they too were crushed in the 
wake of man's quest for ressurection above the not-just-social beast he had 
become.  An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 theocrats to a church door.  
Theologically, Luthar was into reorientation mutation.  Calvinism was the 
most convenient religion since the days of the ancients.  Ana-baptist 
services tended to be migratory.  The Popes, of course, were usually 
Catholic.  Monks went right on seeing themselves as worms.  The last Jesuit 
priest died in the 19th century.

	After the refirmation were wars both foreign and infernal.  If the 
Spanish could gain the Netherlands they would have a stronghold throughout 
northern Europe which would include their posetions in Italy, Burgangy, 
central Europe and India thus serrounding France.  The German Emporer's 
lower passage was blocked by the French for years and years.

	Louise XIV became King of the Sun.  He gave the people food and 
artillery.  If he didn't like someone, he sent them to the gallows to row 
for the rest of their lives.  Vauban was the royal minister of flirtation.  
In Russia the 17th century was known as the time of the bounding of the 
serfs.  Russian nobles wore clothes only to humour Peter the Great.  Peter 
filled his government with accidental people and built a new capital near 
the European boarder.  Orthodox priests became government antennae.

	The enlightenment was a reasonable time.  Voltare wrote a book 
called "Candy" that got him into trouble with Frederick the Great.  
Philosophers were unknown as yet, and the fundamental stake was one of 
religious toleration slightly confused with defeatism.  France was in a very 
serious state.  Taxation was a great drain on the state budget.  The French 
revolution was accomplished before it happened.  The revolution evolved 
through republican and tolarian phases until it catapulted into Napoleon.  
Napoleon was ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained.

	History, a record of things left behind by past generations, started 
in 1815.  Throughout the comparatively radical years 1815-1870 the western 
European continent was undergoing a Rampant period of economic modification.  
Industrialization was precipitating in England.

	Problems were so complexicated that in Paris, out of a city 
population of 1 million people, 2 million able bodies were on the loose.

	Great Brittian, the USA and other European countrys had demicratic 
leanings.  The middle class was tired and needed a rest.  The old order 
could see the lid holding down new ideas beginning to shake.  Among the 
goals of the chartists were universal suferage and anal parliment.  Voting 
was to be done by ballad.

	A new time zone of national unification roared over the horizon.  
Founder of the new Italy was Cavour, an intelligent Sardine from the north.  
Nationalism aided Itally because nationalism is the growth of an army.  We 
can see that nationalism succeeded for Itally because of France's big army.  
Napoleam III-IV mounted the French thrown.  One thinks of Napoleon III as a 
live extension of the late but great, Napoleon.  Here too was the new 
Germany: loud, bold, vulgar and full of reality.

	Culture fomented from Europe's tip to its top.  Richard Strauss, who 
was violent but methodical like his wife made him, plunged into vicious and 
perverse plays.  Dramatized were adventures in seduction and abortion.  
Music reeked with reality.  Wagner was master of music, and people did not 
forget his contribution.  When he died they labeled his seat "historical." 
Other countries had their own artists.  France had Chekhov.

	World War I broke out around 1912-1914.  Germany was on one side of 
France and Russia was on the other.  At war people get killed, and then they 
aren't people any more, but friends.  Peace was proclaimed at Versigh, which 
was attended by George Loid, Primal Minister of England.  President Wilson 
arrived with 14 pointers.  In 1937 Lenin revolted Russia.  Communism raged 
among the peasants, and the civil war "team colours" were red and white.

	Germany was displaced after WWI.  This gave rise to Hitler.  Germany 
was morbidly overexcited and unbalanced.  Berlin became the decadent 
capital, where all forms of sexual deprivations were practised.  A huge 
anti-semantic movement arose.  Attractive slogans like "death to all Jews" 
were used by government groups.  Hitler remilitarized the Rineland over a 
squirmish between Germany and France.

	The appeasers were blinded by the great red of the Soviets.  
Moosealini rested his foundations on 8 million bayonets and invaded Hi Lee 
Salasy.  Germany invaded Poland, France invaded Belgium, and Russia invaded 
everybody.  War screeched to an end when a nukuleer explosion was dropped on 
Heroshima.  A whole generation had been wipe out in two world wars, and 
their forlorne families were left to pick up the peaces.

	According to Fromm, individuation began historically in medieval 
times.  This was a period of small childhood.  There is increasing 
experience as adolescence experiences its life development.  The last stage 
is us

	A beautiful woman had just stepped out of the shower at a posh hotel 
when she heard the phone ring.  She quickly dried herself off, and entered 
the bedroom stark naked.  She immediately spotted a window washer eyeing her

	Unable to move, she stood there speechless and nude.  Her trance was 
broken by the window washer.  "For heaven's sake lady.  Haven't you ever 
seen a window washer before?"

communicating among themselves, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce on 
us poor, unsuspecting humans...

	A preacher who wanted to raise money for his Church was told that 
there was a fortune to be made in horse racing, so he decided to buy a horse 
and enter it in the races.  However, at the local auction, the going prices 
for horses were so steep that he ended up buying a donkey instead.

	He figured, however, that since he had it, he might as well go ahead 
and enter the donkey in the races.  To his surprise, in the first race, his 
mule came in second.  The next day, the Racing Sheets carried this banner 
headline:

	PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS

	The Preacher was so pleased with himself that he entered the mule in 
another race.  This time it won, and the papers stated:

	PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT

	The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered 
the Preacher not to enter the donkey in another race.  The new headlines 
read:

	BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS

	This was too much for the Bishop and he ordered to get rid of the 
animal.  The Preacher gave it to a Nun in a new nearby convent.  The next 
headlines read:

	NUN HAS THE BEST ASS IN TOWN

	The Bishop fainted.  He told the Nun to dispose of the donkey and 
she finally found a farmer who whould take it off her hands for $10.00.  The 
next newspaper headline read thus:

	NUN PEDDLES HER ASS FOR TEN BUCKS

	They buried that Bishop the next day

	He headed west after a three-day market test in Baton Rouge showed 
him merchants are not willing to shell out $300 - $500 per day for a human 
billboard.  "I had success in California, but I guess that others don't 
appreciate somebody using their head."  Valine came to Louisiana for the 
Super Bowl, and was employed by a firm promoting a Super Bowl eve variety 
show

	Death and taxes may be two great inevitabilities, but they are 
usually thought to be mutually exclusive.  Kenneth Swenka, 48, a farmer in 
North Liberty, Iowa, found otherwise after the death of his three-year-old 
German shepherd, Lobo.  When Swenka went to pay his county property taxes, 
he learned that they intended to include a $1 levy on Lobo.  Swenka told the 
authorities that the dog was dead, but was informed that since the tax had 
already been officially registered, he would have to pay.  He reluctantly 
agreed.  Then he found out that by Iowa law, the dog's tax could not be paid 
until the animal's license had been renewed, and it could not be renewed 
until Lobo had been revaccinated against rabies.  Swenka offered to exhume 
his pet, but the county auditor finally agreed to waive the rules --- and 
accept the $1 in tax.  Observes Swenka:  "Lobo never gave me any trouble 
until he died"

	On Tuesday morning, when Nancy Reagan stood beside her newly-

familiar with her.  But that's to be expected.  She is the First Lady, and 
the whole world evidently feels the undying need to know all about her 
comings, goings and shopping preferences.

	Just in case the past month's overdose of insight into the life of 
Adolfo's favorite mannequin has not been sufficient, here's a little 
something extra to start the Reagan presidency out right.

	Nancy Reagan uses Poof-Poof rollers.

	Don't ask me what Poof-Poof rollers are.  I haven't the foggiest.  
Earlier this week, via registered mail, an envelope marked CONFIDENTIAL 
arrived on my desk.  The contents of this Krazy-Glue-sealed document said:

	"For Immediate Release:  It was revealed yesterday in Washington, 
DC, that the First Lady of the United States of America is presently curling 
her auburn-colored hair with Poof-Poof rollers.  Reportedly, she has been 
using Poof-Poofs for many years with repeated success.  Mrs Reagan commented 
that although now she is able to afford any brand roller she wishes, she 
plans to remain loyal to Poof-Poof for the next four years ... Sincerely, 
William J Silverman, President of Poof-Poof."

	Next week - the blueprint of precisely where Nancy places her Poof-
Poofs

	Disco music makes mice homosexual, and could trigger the same 
reaction in humans, a study at the Aegean University says.  Researchers at 
the Izmir-based university "discovered that high-level noise --- such as 
that frequently found in discos --- causes homosexuality in mice and 
deafness among pigs," the Milliyet newspaper said yesterday

	The Cabbage Patch Doll is one of America's hottest-selling toys.  
But recently, says Connecticut exorcist Ed Warren, the toy has been targeted 
by the devil.

	According to Warren, one doll told its owner, "You and I are going 
to be together forever.  I'm not just a doll --- I'm the Lord of Hell."  
When Warren arrived on the scene, the doll was supposedly levitating eight 
inches in the air.  "I quickly made the sign of the cross," he says, "and 
held out my crucifix, and the doll flopped into its crib.  Then I buried the 
doll and sprinkled holy water from a church onto the grave.  There hasn't 
been any trouble since."

	Another Cabbage Patch Doll tried to strangle its owner, Warren says, 
and yet another induced nightmarish hallucinations.  In both cases, he adds, 
he performed exorcism and burial.

	"These diabolical infestations occur when childless women buy the 
dolls and treat them like the child they never had.  Some cherish the doll 
as a loved one and buy it a wardrobe and jewelry;  one woman even had a 
complete nursery for the doll.  But the devil perceives such behaviour as a 
sign of human weakness and is just waiting to take advantage of the 
situation"

	And, last but not least, a few words of wisdom.  It's true that man 
does not live by bread alone, and we've pretty much proved that axiom with 
this first edition.  To quote someone much smarter than I, "I am non-
denominational --- I accept all forms of currency.  So, open your hearts and 
empty your pockets!"  A wonderful sentiment, don't you think?

	After a while
		You learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and
		chaining a soul,
	And you learn
		that love doesn't mean leaning and company doesn't mean
		security,
	And you begin
		to learn that kisses aren't contracts and presents aren't
		promises,
	And you begin
		to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes open,
		with the grace of an adult, not the grief of a child,
	And you learn
		to build all your roads on today because tomorrow's ground
		is too uncertain for plans.
	After a while
		you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much.
	So plant your own garden
		And decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone
		to bring you flowers.
	And you learn that you really can endure...
		that you really are strong,
		and you really do have worth


...until next month...
