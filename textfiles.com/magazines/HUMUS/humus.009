A very few words:::

	If those among you would kindly send in junk that you have no other 
use for, stuff that you read and find humorous, filth that no one else will 
take, stories absurd or preposterous, news that isn't fit to line 
litterboxes anywhere, if you would send those gems to us here at The Humus 
Report, we'd appreciate it.  Our address will be given to you near the end 
of our report.  We will cull from the post office box all death threats and 
denunciations, and print what we can of whatever is left.  The rest is up to 
you...

	We would appreciate it if:  (1) the sending of copyrighted material 
for publication was sent ONLY if you also send along a legal release for us 
to use that material;  (2) if you should see non-attributed copyrighted 
material in our stuff, please let us know ASAP so we can take appropriate 
actions;  (3) if you like what we do here, please donate whatever you feel 
appropriate, so that we can continue to bring you this stuff month after 
month...

	I also have a program contained within CKP-MSG.ARC from which 
virtually everything you will see here can be found, and then some.  For a 
nominal cost per year, I will provide the latest copy of the ibm/compat 
program AND the latest updates of the datafile to you...  address inquiries 
about this program and/or the datafile to the address near the end of our 
report...

	We can thank Malcolm Peltcher for educating us about gas grills, 
Roger Tang, Mike Santora, and a special thanx to Ronald Reagan and all of 
his friends for making it exceptionally easy to find good fertilizings...

	So, without further adieu, on with the show...  

============================================================================

	"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here..."

============================================================================

	Edgar Rice Burroughs (1st, 1875), the novelist who created the 
creature eventually known through Johnny Weismuller as the kid with the "Ah-
ee-ah-ee-ah!" heard round the world...  On the 7th, Queen Liz the First was 
the first of the Liz's (1533) to be Liz, leading to Liz Taylor and all of 
her husbands in our time...  The 7th also produced Grandma Moses (1860) and 
James Van Allen (1914), both significant folk in the history of the United 
States, and both well worth researching...

	Peter Sellers didn't start warning Cato or bothering Chief Inspector 
until after his birth on the 8th, 1925...  Jesse Owens (12th, 1913) realized 
several dreams during his lifetime, not the least of which was spoiling Herr 
Hitler's predictions of the dominance of the white man over the black man in 
the 1936 track events of the Berlin Olympics...

	Many talented ladies dot the September scene, with Margaret Sanger, 
feminist extraordinaire (14th, 1883);  Dame Agatha Christie (15th, 1890), 
mystery writer par excellance;  and Lauren "...just put your lips together 
and blow..." Bacall (16th, 1924), great whistler, actress, and Bogart foil 
in many movies...

	Numerous writers need give thanx to Herbert George Wells (21st, 
1866) for expanding visions of the future without the help of rose-colored 
glasses;  Numerous musicians need give thanx to Ray Charles (23rd, 1930) for 
his expanding visions of the future through his fingers and mind;  Numerous 
satirists ... etc... Al Capp (28th, 1909), who found Dogpatch somewhere on 
the map of these here United States, and lived to tell us about it and its 
inhabitants;  and, those that wish to should give thanx that Truman Capote 
was born on the 30th in 1924, among our shortest of short-story writers...

	Last, but not least, we have Jim Hensen (24th, 1936) creating 
characters who live today without strings (like Kermit and Miss Piggy), and 
John Chapman (26th, 1774), THE original Johnny Appleseed...  apparently he 
was not a fig-ment of someone's pie-eyed imagination...  :)

	Because it occurs all over the first week at one time or another, 
we'll just put Labor Day up here, even though we attempt to do no labor 
during that day...

	Aaron Burr seems to have led a most extraordinary life, and being 
acquitted on charges of plotting to set up an empire appears to be yet 
another sharp point in his, 1st, 1807...  The history of Los Angeles dates 
back to the 4th in 1781, founded in a valley appropriately named "the Valley 
of Smokes" by the Indians;  they noticed that what smoke went up didn't 
disperse on the winds easily;  they should have nuked the sight then...

	The first gasoline pump is delivered to a gasoline dealer on the 5th 
in 1885;  I often wonder who they would have delivered it to back then if 
NOT a gasoline dealer;  I can't remember any 7-11s or AM-PM Minimarts being 
open, even back then...  The Lincoln Highway opened as the first paved 
coast-to-coast highway on the 10th in 1913, while the 14th in 1899 is 
important because some tourist named Henry Bliss gets his clock punched in 
New York, becoming the first person attacked by an automobile on a permanent 
basis...  While we're here, we might as well point out that the first baby 
born on the Golden Gate Bridge took thirty-some years to gain that 
notoriety, waiting until the 19th in 1968...

	Star Trek first appears on TV, using NBC as their launching pad, on 
the 6th in 1966...  Swanson proves you CAN fool people some of the time, 
selling its first "TV dinner" on the 10th in 1953, leading the way to the 
premiere of Gunsmoke on CBS on the 10th in 1955...  "The Tonight Show" 
debuted on the 24th in 1954;  does anyone remember the names of even half of 
the >long-term< hosts?...

	If you were reading last month's Humus Report, you might have seen 
something that said that Voyager II was launched sometime in August of 
1977...  well, I've also seen a September 5th, 1977, launch date...  which 
one is right?

	Lincoln makes two important speeches during September, the first 
about when you CAN fool people (8th, 1858), the second about inalienable 
rights (the Emancipation Proclamation, 22nd, 1863)...  International 
Literacy Day is celebrated on the 8th every year...  The New York Times 
first goes on sale, at 2 cents per copy, on the 18th in 1851...

	The capitol of the United States may have eventually moved to 
Washington DC, but most "New Yawkaas" will tell you that NYC is STILL the 
capitol (having been crowned on the 13th in 1788)...  AP Giannini married 
Clorinda Cuneo on the 14th, 1892;  we don't know either marriage partner, so 
if you do, please send us information about WHY we placed this announcement 
here...  Oh, yeah...  The first tooth extraction to occur under "happy 
drugs" occurred in Charlestown, Massachusetts (30th, 1846);  I've heard it 
claimed that marriage affects the same nerves, so perhaps we should use 
happy drugs during the ceremony?  Just a thought...

	Felt Hat Day is celebrated on the 15th...  The start of the Jewish 
New Year appears on the 18th...  The Autumn Harvest Festival happens in 
Wheaton, Illinois on the 22nd...  The first day of fall is usually on the 
23rd...  and, the 28th is the birth anniversary of Confucius...

	A patent was granted for the Ice Cream Cone, a most important date 
in American history, the 22nd of September 1903...

	This one intrigues me, and perhaps it's the reason the Post Office 
is in such dire straits all the time:  The US Post Office was established on 
the 22nd of September in 1789...  Congress came along two days later (24 
September 1789) and CREATED the Post Office...  where's that chicken and egg 
again?

	My, the things you can learn by reading The Humus Report...  Boggles 
the mind, don't it?  :)...

	Revenge:  I'll just let the following speak for itself.  If you know 
of any "practical jokes" or "revenge tactics", please let us know about them 
so we can include them in a future issue.

	After all, there are oh so many folks out there who deserve just 
what is coming to them...  :)

	You can also use high voltage fields and non-contacting electrodes.  
You want a gradiant of a volt/cm or so, if I remember correctly.  
Frequencies in the range of 3-5 Hz can cause confusion in the subject;  this 
leads to an interesting anti-door-to-door salesman/preacher device.  Two 
metal plates, one on either side of the door, running vertically from about 
3 to 7 or 8 feet above the ground.  This allows the filling of the space in 
front of the door with the ELF field.  Connect a high-voltage amp's output 
to the plates, and drive it with your sine wave generator.

	If, upon answering the door, you find a personage that you do not 
wish to speak with, switch on the power.  Maybe wiggle the frequency 
slightly.  If they get sufficiently confused and dazed you might be able to 
reverse the intended roles.  Do not attempt this if you have a metal 
doorframe

	To my darling Husband, 

	I am sending you this letter in a bogus software company envelope so 
that you will be sure to read it.  Please forgive the deception, but I 
thought you should know what has been going at home since your IBM computer 
entered out lives two years ago.

	The children are doing quite well, Tommy is seven now and is a 
bright, handsome boy.  He has developed quite an interest in the arts.  He 
drew a family portrait for a school project.  All the figures were good, but 
yours was excellent!  The chair and the back of your head are very 
realistic.  You would be very proud of him.

	Little Jennifer turned three in September.  She looks a lot like you 
did at that age.  She is an attractive child and quite smart.  She still 
remembers that you spent the whole afternoon with us on her birthday.  What 
a great day for Jen, despite the fact that it was stormy and the electricity 
was out.

	I am also doing well.  I went blond about a year ago and was 
delighted to discover that it really is more fun!  Lars --- I mean, Mr 
Swenson, the department head --- has taken an interest in my career and has 
become a good friend to us all.  I have discovered that the household chores 
are much easier after I realized that you didn't mind being vacuumed, but 
that feather dusting made you sneeze.

	The house is in good shape.  I had the living room painted last 
spring.  I'm not sure if you noticed it.  I made sure that the painters cut 
air holes in the drop cloth so you wouldn't be disturbed.

	Well, my dear, I must be going.  Uncle Lars --- Mr Swenson, I mean 
--- is taking us all on a ski trip and there is packing to do.  I have hired 
a housekeeper to take care of things while we are away.  She'll keep things 
in order, fill your cofee cup, and bring your meals to your desk, just the 
way you like it.

	I hope you and the IBM have a lovely time while we are gone.  Tommy, 
Jen and I think of you often - try to remember us while your disks are 
booting.

	Love Mary

	During Gemini 2, an unmanned-spacecraft test in the 1960's, a radio 
commentator at the scene had his launch copy prepared ahead of time.  As the 
countdown ended, the reporter began to read, "We have liftoff, and the giant 
rocket is rising into the beautiful blue Florida skies, streaking out over 
the Atlantic, a thunderous roar filling the area."

	When he finally looked up, he realized that he heard no roar, and 
saw no rocket rising.  The rocket still sat there.  He thought fast and 
carried on:  "And something has gone wrong --- four giant arms have reached 
out and pulled the rocket back to the pad!"

He says that mental illness allowed him to "purify" himself.  "Sex is 
spiritual dirt and insanity, since it sinks worse to the tree, it is 
spiritual manure...  The emotionally carnal person eats his dirt and having 
eaten, proceeds to manufacture his flesh after the manner of barnyard 
animals by using his dirty bottom.  The human vegetable converts his dirt 
and manure by keeping his face to the light and manufactures his flesh by 
using the top half of his body, as a tree, up in the air, where it is clean"

			     Using A Gas Grill
		    by Malcolm Peltcher (c)opyright 1987

	We got a gas grill.

	This is the bigtime, folks, the mainstream.  Not one of those wimpy 
little charcoal grills which you hang over for hours and re-squirt with some 
liquid which they CLAIMED was flammable, only to find the liquid only puts 
out what little fire you already had.  I'm talking about a GAS grill, just 
like all the steak places use.

	First, it is important to understand the nature of a gas grill.  It 
is basically a blast furnace, scaled down to backyard proportions.  Set at a 
high enough temperature (essentially, anything from "ON" up), it can melt 
every metal known to man, with the possible exception of its own housing, 
which I suspect is made of tungsten.  A gas grill is NOT electric, nor does 
it in any way involve electricity, and is therefore rather unpredictable.  
And lastly, a gas grill has a phenomenal thermal mass, to the extent that it 
can inflict third degree burns for days after being turned off.

	Now that you understand the basics of the gas grill, we will go into 
a gas grill "how to" tutorial which will prepare you for all aspects of 
owning and operating a gas grill.

	First, of course, comes assembly of our unit.  This should always 
begin at the store where you purchase your grill, where you pay the clerk an 
extra $30 to have the grill assembled by a dyslexic high school dropout.  It 
will be completed at home, where you add the parts that weren't included 
with your unit.

	Parts not included with your unit fall into two categories.  One is 
parts which were not packed with your unit at the factory.  The main members 
of this category are the two eight-ounce vegetable cans that go into little 
clips under the grill to catch drippings.  The other category is parts the 
dyslexic high school dropout stole.  This includes almost everything else.  
A quick trip to the store for replacement of those parts, and you're ready 
for your first outdoor gas cooking experience.

	So now you are ready to cook, except you never did install those 
eight ounce vegetable cans, because you don't have any.  In fact, for as 
long as you live, you will NEVER have any eight ounce vegetable cans, 
because vegetables come in 15-ounce cans, for crying out loud!  If 
vegetables came in eight ounce cans, don't you think the company who made 
the grill would have included a couple?  Of course they would!  Therefore, 
later in this article, we'll show you exactly how to make your own eight-
ounce vegetable cans.  For now, don't worry about it.

	The first couple times you use the grill no grease should drip out 
the bottom anyway, because it's getting absorbed by the lava rock at the 
bottom of your grill, building that accumulation of rotten grease and other 
putrid food substances so important in giving outdoor grilled food that 
special flavor.

	That process is known as "seasoning", because if we referred to it 
as "rotting," people whould tend to have a lower opinion of the overall gas 
grilling picture.  So forget the cans for now, and let's get right to the 
heart of the matter:

	Turn on the grill, light it, then go find a dead animal to put on 
it. This could be an essentially whole dead animal, or various chopped parts 
of one, but make sure there aren't any fur or feathers or scales or anything 
like that.

	Now just flop this dead animal right up there on the grill and 
commence to flopping it over from time to time.  Keep this up until either 
1) the dead animal or portion thereof is all the way cooked, or 2) the kids 
have started screaming and your spouse has given up and given then peanut 
butter and jelly sandwiches and it doesn't look like that dead animal is 
ever going to get done anyway until you take it in and put it in the 
microwave.

	Now you have learned one of the fundamentals of the gas grill:  99% 
of the heat it generates goes into its own metal parts, lava rock, and the 
general air around it, while only 1% of the heat goes into the food you're 
cooking.

	Now that you understand the basics of cooking on the gas grill we 
will get to the business of those eight-ounce vegetable cans:

HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN EIGHT-OUNCE VEGETABLE CANS

	First, you must assemble together the following tools and materials:

	2 square feet .090 or .125 guage soft sheet aluminum
	self-lubricating, automatic advance band saw
	metal lathe
	metal forming brake
	300-amp heliarc welder

	There are probably a couple other things you'll need that I've 
missed, so please read this entire article before starting, and I'll mention 
those items as we encounter them.

	To start, you must cut the can parts from the sheet aluminum.  These 
consist of a can bottom and a can side for each can.  Use the band saw to 
cut can sides, and an octagon shape which will become the can bottom.  Now 
turn the bottom on the lathe until it is round.  Note that you don't need to 
make can tops, because, while the gas grill manufacturer did not mention 
this specifically in the instructions, what you need are OPENED vegetable 
cans.

	Now that you have cut the basic parts, form the sides into cylinder 
shapes on the metal forming brake.  Note that the cylinder springs apart 
slightly when you release it from the brake.  This is ok, we'll show you how 
to deal with this problem in the next step.

	The next step, of course, is welding your cans together.  You will 
use the 300-amp heliarc welder for this, and you will need a helper.  Find a 
friend who is as enthused as you are about do-it-yourself projects, or just 
about any offspring old enough to comprehend voice instructions.  Now, have 
your helper hold the can side closed while you weld the seam...

	Asbestos gloves!  That was one of the other things you need that I 
forgot to mention in the list at the beginning.  If you've been reading as 
you go rather than reading the whole article first, you have a problem with 
your helper right now.  Now you'll need to get some asbestos gloves, and 
another helper, preferably one who wasn't watching while your first helper 
got third degree burns.  Or better yet, you could just put the can side in a 
vice while you weld it.  Don't you wish I had thought of that idea earlier?  
I sure do.

	With the side seam welded, all that remains is to attach the bottom.  
First, turn the side in the vice so one end is up.  By the way, put on the 
asbestos gloves before doing this.  I should have told you to do that first.  
I bet you wish I had.  With your remaining good hand weld the bottom to the 
can.  I know it really takes two hands, because there are two rods to hold, 
but you can manage.  It's sort of like holding chopsticks.  Of course, 
repeat these two welding steps for the second can, then install them into 
your gas grill.

	Then find another dead animal

============================================================================

	Now I have taken your letter, and I'll show you point by god damn 
point in the treaty where you are misinforming the people

	- John Wayne, in a 11 November 1977 letter to Ronald Reagan, a copy 
of which was sent to President Carter, where he accused Reagan of spreading 
untruths about the Panama Canal Treaty in letters to supporters -

				   -----

	The news...  such an integral part of our life, and yet we tend to 
ignore it so blindly...  If it weren't for news, we wouldn't be able to 
bring you such well-written items as these you have before you...

	Behold...

	Senator Edmund S Muskie (D-Maine) had hoped to got out for dinner.  
He never made it.  Muskie's driver was a Washington staff member who 
apparently was not used to driving in New York City.  On his first right 
turn the car ran directly into a demonstration, and the next street was 
blocked by a United States Postal Service truck.  The driver tried again, 
and made his biggest mistake.

	Strange automobiles are a common sight in John Pierson's driveway.  
A constant stream of motorists sputter into his farm asking for oil, gas, 
jacks or the telephone.  It's been going on for eight years, ever since the 
state built a freeway off-ramp that ends at Pierson's driveway.

	He tried discouraging people by posting a sign reading:  "NO AUTO 
SERVICE.  NO PHONE.  NO TOOLS.  GO 2 MILES."  But the ploy didn't work.

	"One fellow came in here and said he needed some oil," Pierson, 73, 
recalls.  "After I put four quarts in his car, he told me he'd been up to 
Reno gambling and he was broke.  He said he'd send me the money, but that's 
the last I ever heard of him."

	The most memorable day at the Pierson spread, however, was when a 
cosmetics salesman with a car full of aerosol cans drove up.  The car was on 
fire and the cans began exploding.  "Some of them went clear over the house.  
It made an awful mess.  He said he'd be back to help me clean it up, but I 
never saw him again"

	Artist Horst Leissi says he wants to hang a huge cardboard and poly-
vinyl model of a house fly from the top of a city water tower as a monument.

	"Any insect that has been swatted and stomped on for so long and is 
still around deserves a monument," he says.  "The way we are polluting the 
world, the only species that is sure to survive is the insect."

	The city council is scheduled to take up Leissi's proposal Tuesday.  
Leissi says the 12-foot-high fly would hang from the tower for only a few 
days, the dates depending on the weather.  "I'd like to do it as soon as 
possible, because we're going into the rainy season"

	Police have filed prowling charges against a 22-year-old man and a 
32-year-old woman found in a nude embrace in a residential backyard at one 
o'clock in the morning.  The two had met at a local bar and apparently ended 
up in a yard the man mistakenly thought belonged to a friend

	Toronto has had a team in the American League for less than two 
years, but so far as Earl Weaver is concerned, he's already spent a lifetime 
in the Canadian city.

	The Baltimore manager has been the center of controversy in two wild 
affairs involving the Orioles and the Blue Jays.  Last September 15th, the 
Orioles forfeited a game in Toronto because Weaver objected to the position 
of a tarpaulin in the team's bullpen.  The next time the Orioles visited 
Toronto was Monday night and all Weaver could really object to was the 
quality of Baltimore's pitching.  The Orioles were shelled 24-10 by the Blue 
Jays.

	With Baltimore behind 19-6 in the fifth inning, Weaver decided to 
give his beleaguered pitching corps some rest by inserting outfielder Larry 
Harlow to pitch.  Harlow, who pitched two games in the Florida League in 
1971, got out the first two men he faced, then surrendered two walks, a wild 
pitch, Rico Carty's two-run single, another walk and John Mayberry's three-
run homer, his second of the game, giving him seven RBI's for the night.

	"It's tough pitching with seven years between starts," quipped 
Harlow, who was told to warm up while Weaver determined if the move was 
legal.  "I was doing OK getting those first two guys out, but ran into 
trouble when (Bob) Baylor walked.  Then I had to go into a stretch.  My 
stretch killed me."

	When the next batter walked, Weaver replaced Harlow with player-
coach Elrod Hendricks, normally a catcher.  Hendricks, 37, just lobbed the 
ball over the plate.  He walked his first batter, then got rookie Brian 
Milner to fly out and didn't allow a run before being replaced in the 
eighth.

	"My pitchers weren't doing the job so I had to go somewhere else," 
said Weaver, who probably would have preferred to be someplace else

	Is there a civil servant in the house?  Quick, we need a translation 
of the notice below, which recently accompanied utility bills sent to users 
in Tallahassee:

	"A part of the recent electric rate increase represents an increase 
in the fuel component in the base rate.  Since only the actual fuel costs 
are passed on to the customer, this part of the new base rate will not 
increase your fuel charges.  Instead, sometimes your electric bill will show 
a negative fuel oil adjustment, while at other times it may show a positive 
fuel adjustment.  Your electric bill should include a negative fuel 
adjustment except when the City is forced to burn low sulfur fuel in its new 
plant, the City loses its present gas supply because of regulation or there 
are substantial increases in the present cost of oil"

	Kudoes go to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, 
which recently issued tough noise-pollution regulations.  There are, 
however, a few exceptions to the crackdown:  the offending noise cannot be 
produced by dogs, any motor vehicles, snow blowers, lawn mowers, daytime 
blasting, farming equipment, airports, auto races, construction activities, 
unamplified human voices, aircraft-propulsion testing or transmission 
facilities, to name a few

	Ronald Reagan -- who believes in appointing many of his old 
Hollywood pals to government positions and commissions -- will probably 
never appoint James Garner, star of 'The Rockford Files' and the 'Maverick' 
TV series to anything.  Not if Reagan or First Lady Nancy should happen to 
read the following quotation from the actor on page 374 of 'James Garner', a 
biography by Raymond Strait:

	"Oh, Ronnie, Ronnie, isn't he wonderful?  Listen, I was vice 
president of the Screen Actors Guild when he was president, and we used to 
tell him what to say.  He can talk around a subject better than anyone in 
the world.  He's never had an original thought that I know of, and we go 
back a hell of a lot of years.  Do you realize >I< could have been your 
president?"

	And, last but not least, a few words of wisdom.  It's true that 
mankind does not live by bread alone, and we've pretty much proved that 
axiom with these unusual masterpieces.  To quote someone much smarter than 
myself (hi, kalen!):  "I am non-denominational --- I accept all forms of 
currency.  So, open your hearts and empty your pockets!"

	A wonderful sentiment, don't you think?

	 Black, with white stripes,	Clear

	In the dark of the night.	You could see the

	In the eye of the maelstrom,	of nervousness
	 She prepared			Growing inside
