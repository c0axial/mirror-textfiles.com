	One of the things I enjoy most is traveling.  I LOVE to travel.  One 
of the things I HATE about traveling is "getting there."  Now, I realize I 
might sound just a bit contradictory, but I'm sure there are others out in 
the viewing audience for whom this rings a familiar bell.  EVERY time I 
travel alone, something strange happens.

	For example, how often is it that I can fly from Washington DC's 
National Airport to Los Angeles (LAX, about 3000 miles away) in less time 
(several hours different) than it takes to get from LAX to Ontario Airport 
(40 miles +/-) on the ground by "Rapid Transit"?  And I had to change planes 
in Minneapolis.  And terminals.  Carrying a computer and briefcase through 
metal detectors.  And the plane was late taking off at EVERY landing.

	With that in mind, I think you'll enjoy the following.  I have no 
idea who this young man is, but my heart goes out to him...

	Hotel Soap Nightmare

	By way of preface, this story was transmitted over a travel agency 
computer network.  I cannot vouch for its authenticity and I haven't 
corrected any grammatical or typographical errors.

	Following is our own version of a "soap" opera completely different 
from those you usually see.  It was submitted by a London hotel and, believe 
it or not, is true.  The hotel is a place that gives *free* soap:

Dear Maid, Please do not leave any more of those little bars of soap in my 
bathroom since I have brought my own bath-sized Dial.  Please remove the six 
unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest and another 
three in the shower soap dish.  They are in my way.  Thank you, <signed> S 
Berman

	Dear Room 635, I am not your regular maid.  She will be back 
        tomorrow, Thursday, from her day off.  I took the 3 hotel soaps out 
        of the shower soap dish as you requested.  The 6 bars on your shelf 
        I took out of your way and put on top of your Kleenex dispenser in 
        case you should change your mind.  This leaves only the 3 bars I 
        left today which my instructions from the management is to leave 3 
        soaps daily.  I hope this is satisfactory.  <signed> Kathy, Relief 
        Maid

Dear Maid, I hope you are my regular maid.  Apparently Kathy did not tell 
you about my note to her concerning the little bars of soap.  When I got 
back to my room this evening I found you had added 3 little Camays to the 
shelf under my medicine cabinet.  I am going to be here in the hotel for two 
weeks and have brought my own bath-size Dial so I won't need those 6 little 
Camays which are on the shelf.  They are in my way when shaving, brushing 
teeth, etc.  Please remove them. <signed> S Berman

	Dear Mr Berman, My day off was last Wednesday so the relief maid 
        left 3 hotel soaps which we are instructed by the management.  I 
        took the 6 soaps which were in your way on the shelf and put them in 
        the soap dish where your Dial was.  I put the Dial in the medicine 
        cabinet for your convenience.  I didn't remove the 3 complimentary 
        soaps which are always placed inside the medicine cabinet for all 
        new check-ins and which you did not object to when you checked in 
        last Monday.  Please let me know if I can of further assistance.  
        <signed> Your regular maid, Dotty

	Dear Mr Berman, The assistant manager, Mr Kensedder, informed me 
        this AM that you called him last evening and said you were unhappy 
        with your maid service.  I have assigned a new girl to your room.  I 
        hope you will accept my apologies for any past inconvenience.  If 
        you have any future complaints please contact me so I can give it my 
        personal attention.  Call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.  Thank 
        you.  <signed> Elaine Carmen, Housekeeper

Dear Miss Carmen, It is impossible to contact you by phone since I leave the 
hotel for business at 745 AM and don't get back before 530 or 6PM.  That's 
the reason I called Mr Kensedder last night.  You were already off duty.  I 
only asked Mr Kensedder if he could do anything about those little bars of 
soap.  The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was a new check-in 
today, since she left another 3 bars of hotel soap in my medicine cabinet 
along with her regular delivery of 3 bars on the bathroom shelf.  In just 5 
days here I have accumulated 24 little bars of soap.  Why are you doing this 
to me?  <signed> S Berman

	Dear Mr Berman, Your maid, Kathy, has been instructed to stop 
        delivering soap to your room and remove the extra soaps.  If I can 
        be of further assistance, please call extension 1108 between 8AM and 
        5PM.  Thank you, <signed> Elaine Carmen, Housekeeper

Dear Mr Kensedder, My bath-size Dial is missing.  Every bar of soap was 
taken from my room including my own bath-size Dial.  I came in late last 
night and had to call the bellhop to bring me 4 little Cashmere Bouquets.  
<signed> S Berman

	Dear Mr Berman, I have informed our housekeeper, Elaine Carmen, of 
        your soap problem.  I cannot understand why there was no soap in 
        your room since our maids are instructed to leave 3 bars of soap 
        each time they service a room.  The situation will be rectified 
        immediately.  Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience.  
        <signed> Martin L Kensedder, Assistant Manager

Dear Mrs Carmen, Who the hell left 54 little bars of Camay in my room?  I 
came in last night and found 54 little bars of soap.  I don't want 54 little 
bars of Camay.  I want my one damn bar of bath-size Dial.  Do you realize I 
have 54 bars of soap in here.  All I want is my bath size Dial.  Please give 
me back my bath-size Dial.  <signed> S Berman

	Dear Mr Berman, You complained of too much soap in your room so I 
        had them removed.  Then you complained to Mr Kensedder that all your 
        soap was missing so I personally returned them.  The 24 Camays which 
        had been taken and the 3 Camays you are supposed to receive daily.  
        I don't know anything about the 4 Cashmere Bouquets.  Obviously your 
        maid, Kathy, did not know I had returned your soaps so she also 
        brought 24 Camays plus the 3 daily Camays.  I don't know where you 
        got the idea this hotel issues bath-size Dial.  I was able to locate 
        some bath-size Ivory which I left in your room.  <signed> Elaine 
        Carmen, Housekeeper

Dear Mrs Carmen, Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap 
inventory.  As of today I possess:

	.1.  On shelf under medicine cabinet:  18 Camay in 4 stacks of four 
                and 1 stack of two
	.2.  On Kleenex dispenser:  11 Camay in 2 stacks of four and 1 stack 
                of three
	.3.  On bedroom dresser:  1 stack of three Cashmere Bouquet, 1 stack 
                of four hotel-size bath-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks 
                of four
	.4.  Inside medicine cabinet:  14 Camay in 3 stacks of four and 1 
                stack of two
	.5.  In shower soap dish:  6 Camay, very moist
	.6.  On northeast corner of tub:  1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used
	.7.  On northwest corner of tub:  6 Camays in 2 stacks of three

Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are 
neatly piled and dusted.  Also, please advise her that stacks of more than 4 
have a tendency to tip.  May I suggest that my bedroom window sill is not in 
use and will make an excellent spot for future soap deliveries.  One more 
item, I have purchased another bar of bath-sized Dial which I am keeping in 
the hotel vault in order to avoid further misunderstandings.  <signed> S

	The following is dedicated to those who enjoy getting odd things in 
the mail.  It consists of excerpts from HIGH WEIRDNESS BY MAIL, a book by 
the Reverend Ivan Stang of the SubGenius Church.  He reels off an impressive 
list of closet fanatics, weird scientists, UFO cults, Fort followers, Tesla 
physics enthusiasts, and a few who are sooooooooo crazy they just might have 
a point.

	I present a few examples below --- Stang lists names, addresses, 
phone numbers (rarely) and gives each organization a brief description.  If 
anyone out there has any more information of this kind, or interesting 
stories to tell, please send them to me.

	Two final notes:  "Bob" is the mythical being worshipped by many 
SubGenius members, and Stang warns against using one's own name and address 
when writing "as insurance against Klansmen and Moonies showing up at your 
door.  It won't stop the Feds, though!"  [Stang himself claims never to have 
been accosted despite many years of using his home address --- then again he 
also claims to have guard dogs and elaborate security systems around his 
home]

	Eating is merely an acquired habit.  Wiley Brooks, the guru of 
Breatharianism, espouses a system of physical vitality by which one may stop 
eating and drinking entirely, and live, lichenlike, off light and air.  
"Modern man is the degenerate descendant of the Breatharian, and has 
descended through five stages:  Breathanrianism, Liquidarianism, 
Fruititarianism, Vegetarianism, and Carnivorism."

	This health cult's faith was severely shaken when Brooks was 
discovered to have been sneaking out at night and buying junk food at 
convenience stores for all these years.  Presumably his followers have 
forgiven this serious backsliding, but it's left them on shaky ground, so 
don't send money until you ascertain that they're still there

	Learn to HATE for GOD.  These are those tiny rectangular "Christian"

atrocious art and an almost pre-human level of sheer, unbridled hate, 
manipulating the lowest human religious instincts.  Not exactly a "turn the 
other cheek" philosophy.  These have probably turned more people OFF to 
Jesus than any other Christian publication.  If THE DEVIL has been looking 
for something to make Jesus look bad, this is it.

	Chick depicts with all-too revealing glee, the eternal suffering 
that awaits Jews, Catholics, unbaptized babies, people who cuss, and anyone 
else slightly less consumed with hate and fear than he is.  These rank right 
down there with the craziest Nazi UFO ranting, yet to many ignorant racists 
these are Truth.  Terrifying.

	Archaic, obfuscating, impenetrable, traditional legal verbiage is 
under attack and --- incredible but true --- the call for a sharper blue 
pencil is emanating from an attorney.

	In "Lawyers on Trial" (Times Books), a kick at the class bias of the 
legal profession set for the September publication, author/attorney Phillip 
M Stern tells how officials at Citibank of New York wanted to simplify the 
language in the bank's loan agreements, but were forced to first engage in 
"protracted battling" with their legal staff.  Not surprisingly, the bank's 
lawyers did not openly take the position that legal jargon is employed to 
ensure the public's need to use lawyers.  Citibank instituted the change 
anyway in 1977.  Here is the Old versus the New:

	Old Loan Agreement (368 words):

	In the event of default in the payment of this or any other 
Obligation or the performance or observance of any term or covenant 
contained herein or in any note or other contract or agreement evidencing or 
relating to any Obligation or any Collateral on the Borrower's part to be 
performed or observed;  or the undersigned Borrower shall die;  or any of

creditors;  or a petition shall be filed by or against any of the 
undersigned under any provision of the Bankruptcy Act;  or any money, 
securities or property of the undersigned now or hereafter on deposit with 
or in possession or under the control of the Bank shall be attached or 
become subject to distraint proceedings or any order or process of any 
court;  or the Bank shall deem itself to be insecure, then and in any such 
event, the Bank shall have the right (at its option), without demand or 
notice of any kind, to declare any part of the Obligations to be immediately 
due and payable, whereupon such Obligations shall become and be immediately 
due and payable, and the Bank shall have the right to exercise all the 
rights and remedies available to a secured party upon default under the 
Uniform Commercial Code (the "Code") in effect in New York at the time, and 
such other rights and remedies as may otherwise be provided by law.  Each of 
the undersigned agrees (for the purposes of the "Code") that written notice 
of any proposed sale of, or of the Bank's election to retain, Collateral 
mailed to the undersigned Borrower (who is hereby appointed agent of each of 
the undersigned for such purpose) by first class mail, postage prepaid, at 
the address of the undersigned Borrower indicated below three business days 
prior to such sale or election shall be deemed reasonable notification 
thereof.  The remedies of the Bank hereunder are cumulative and may be 
exercised concurrently or separately.  If any provision of this paragraph 
shall conflict with any remedial provision contained in any security 
agreement or collateral receipt covering any Collateral, the provisions of 
such security agreement or collateral receipt shall control.

meanwhile calling police.  When the man reached the cage again, a bank 
officer asked to see the slip, which the man handed over rather nervously.  
The officer pointed out that the figure on the form was only $6,000.  "Oh, 
that's a mistake," the man said.  "I forgot to add enough zeroes."  By the 
time he had finished adding the zeroes, police had shown up and arrested

result:  the phone rang 24 hours a day.  Whenever Lyle picked up the phone, 
the computer would hang up.  He wouldn't even have the chance to put the 
phone to his ear;  the line would be dead.  Then, milliseconds after he 
placed the phone on the hook, it would ring again.

	The guys from Bell showed up;  they figured from the report that 
someone green-wired Lyle's phone (this involves disconnecting a certain wire 
inside the transmitter or receiver;  it could be done in a matter of 
seconds, when the victim went down the hall to the bathroom, for instance;  
the phone rings continuously, and cannot be answered --- you pick the phone 
off the hook, and the damned thing keeps on ringing.  Of course, when the 
caller hangs up, the phone will stop ringing).  The guy from Bell was 
stumped;  he took the whole phone apart, and put it back together, and he 
still couldn't stop it from ringing without disconnecting it.  Of course, he 
never figured that something was actually dialing the number continuously.  
As for Lyle, he lost a lot of sleep that week

	My roommate and I decided a different kind of stereo war was in 
order with the friends across the hall, so while they were gone one evening, 
we unhooked the wires from their stereo speakers, and instead plugged in 
wires that lead to our stereo across the hall.  We ran them unseen along the 
wall, out the door, under the hall rug, and into our room.

	We got an album of haunted-house sound effects, and waited...

	About an hour after they went to bed, we put the album on, and at 
the "torturing screams" part, switched to their speakers and cranked the 
volume.

	The best part of the whole prank was hearing the screams loud and 
clear in the dead (sorry) silence, and then hearing the resulting crashing 
and bumping as they frantically tried to figure out what was happening.

	We later got the pictorial description of one of them turning on-
off-on-off the stereo switch with wide eyes

	Pranks for the working environment:  Desk drawer confetti.  This one 
takes a little preparation before hand.

Materials:

	Several STURDY rubberbands
	2 binder clips(those black metal clip things)
	Some paper or thin cardboard
	Tape
	LOTS of confetti (paper-punch holes work GREAT)

	Cut the paper/cardboard into strips to form sturdy paddles.  Tie the 
rubberbands end to end to form one long band.  Tape the paddles to the 
rubberband in decent increments.  You now have a paddle wheel that, when 
stretched and wound, will act as a shoveling fan.

	Open someone's middle desk drawer, and remove the pens, etc, from 
the pencil tray in the front.  Stretch the rubberband paddle across the 
width of the desk over the pencil tray, and clamp it down with the binder 
clips.  Remove the binder clip handles, and check to see that they will 
clear when the drawer is closed.  Wind the paddle up so that when it is 
released, it spins the bottom of the paddle toward the victim first --- a 
shoveling effect.  Once it is wound fairly tightly, pour the confetti into 
the pencil tray.

	Now the hard part --- with the paddles held horizontally, GENTLY 
slide the desk drawer closed enough to hold the paddles in place until it is 
opened.  The trap is set.  Whenever the drawer is pulled open, the paddles 
will unwind quickly and shovel/fan the confetti all over the place!

	And, last but not least, a few words of wisdom.  It's true that
mankind does not live by bread alone, and we've pretty much proved that
axiom with these unusual masterpieces.  To quote someone much smarter than
myself (hi, kalen!):  "I am non-denominational --- I accept all forms of
currency.  So, open your hearts and empty your pockets!"

	A wonderful sentiment, don't you think?

	We will acknowledge, in print, those with the warmest thoughts for
our survival...

	If those among you would kindly send in junk that you have no other
use for, stuff that you read and find humorous, filth that no one else will
take, stories absurd or preposterous, news that isn't fit to line
litterboxes anywhere, if you would send those gems to us here at The Humus
Report, we'd appreciate it.  We will cull from the post office box all death
threats and denunciations, and print what we can of whatever is left.  The
rest is up to you...

	We would appreciate it if:  (1) the sending of copyrighted material
for publication was sent ONLY if you also send along a legal release for us
to use that material;  (2) if you should see non-attributed copyrighted
material in our stuff, please let us know ASAP so we can take appropriate
actions;  (3) if you like what we do here, please donate whatever you feel
appropriate, so that we can continue to bring you this stuff month after
month...

	We also have a program contained within CKP-MSG.ZIP (a Fortune-like 
program) from which everything you will see here can be found, and then 
some.  For a nominal cost per year, I will provide the latest copy of the 
ibm/compat program AND the latest updates of the datafile to you...  Address 
inquiries about this program and/or the datafile to the address above...

	A donation of $40 per year will deliver to your doorstep 
approximately 1 megabyte worth of weird and strange, specially formatted for 
use with the CKPMSG program...

	We leave you now with a few thoughts...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Let your love be stronger than your hate or anger.  Learn the wisdom 
of compromise, for it is better to bend a little than to break.  Believe the 
best rather than the worst.  People have a way of living up --- or down --- 
to your opinion of them.  Remember that true friendship is the basis for any 
lasting relationship.  The person you choose to marry is deserving of the 
courtesies and kindnesses you bestow on your friends.  Please hand this down 
to your children and your children's children.  The more things change, the 
more they are the same
