A very few words:::

	Sorry that I've been away from writing for so long (last issue was 
september 88), but spending a lot of time away from home can sometimes do 
that to a person...  As it is, I was out bowling for a living...  They liked 
me so much they asked I never return...  :)

	Be that as it may, The Humus Report is still alive and in no 
apparent danger of going down permanently unless I die or the world turns 
humourless for months on end...  While General Bush and his trusty sidekick, 
"Pancho" Quayle deal marked cards to the world at large, I'll be out there 
reporting on it all, the bizarre, the unusual, the words straight from the 
horse's (pick an end, any end)...  Who knows?  Some of it might even be 
true...  :)

	We can thank Tom McBride for his link to UseNet, Xerox and Motorola, 
Little Miss Muffet, aome Virgin women, Yakov Smirnoff, a few presidents, a 
cast of tens, and a special thanx to VP Quayle for making it exceptionally 
easy to find good fertilizings...

	So, without further adieu, on with the show...

	Just remove a few words, and suddenly a sample from this hardware 
manual is a lot more fun to read:

	"There are two ways to ___ _____, rear entry and bottom entry.  Rear 
entry is the preferred method, because bottom entry does not permit reverse 
_____ ____s, which may be required for certain operations.  Bottom feed 
should be used for heavy forms."

	"If you've had experience with other ______s, you will be pleasantly 
surprised at the stability of the ______ ______ feature, and you'll be 
delighted with the consistent positioning of the ____ on your ___"

	Little Herbie had been blind since birth.  One day at bedtime, his 
mother told him that the next day was a very special one.  If he prayed 
extra hard tonight, he'd be able to see when he woke up the next morning.

	The next morning she came into Herbie's room to make sure he'd 
prayed hard the night before.  "Well then, open your eyes and you'll know 
that your prayers have been answered."

	Little Herbie opened his eyes, only to cry out, "Mother!  Mother!  I 
still can't see!"

	There was a high school football player who was the best ever.  The 
problem was that he was also the most stupid ever.  All the colleges wanted 
him but knew that he couldn't pass the entrance exams.  One coach made a 
deal with his administration:  if the kid could pass one exam, he could play 
football for four years and not even have to attend classes.

	The coach made a special test for the stupid kid and called him in 
to take the test.  He emphasized the importantance of passing the test.

	Coach:  If you want to play football you must pass this test.  It 
		only has three questions and isn't hard.  First question:  
		How many days of the week begin with the letter T?

	Kid:  Two.  Today and Tomorrow.

	Coach, rolling his eyes:  OK, you got the number right.  Second 
		question:  How many seconds in a year?

	Kid:  Twelve.  The second of January, the second of February, etc.

	Coach:  OK, I guess I can accept that.  Last question, it is really 
		easy:  How many D's in Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer?

	Kid, after much thought:  128.

	Two nuns went to the zoo one day.  They walked around and saw a lot 
of different animals, but ended up spending most of their day watching the 
giant male gorilla.  Suddenly, without warning, the gorilla reached through 
the bars and dragged one of the nuns into the cage and began brutally raping 
her repeatedly.  By the time the zoo personnel were able to tranquilize the 
beast, it had savaged the poor nun for nearly an hour.

	While the nun who had been raped recovered in a hospital, nearly a 
week went by until her friend went to visit her, for she felt extremely 
guilty that her friend had been so savagely brutalized and she had escaped 
unscathed.

	Finally, she stood by her beside, holding her hand.  From the bed, 
her friend looked at her bravely.

	She said, "Sister, are you in much pain?"

	The other nun nodded.  "He hasn't called or written..."

	From:  bee@arthur.cs.purdue.edu
	Subject:  Viruses and System Security (a story)
	Date:  20 Dec 88 00:30:03 GMT

	The following story was posted in news.sysadmin recently.  The more 
things change, the more they stay the same...

	Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at 
Motorola (I believe it was) discovered a relatively simple way to crack 
system security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing system (or it may have been 
CP-V's predecessor UTS).  Through a simple programming strategy, it was 
possible for a user program to trick the system into running a portion of 
the program in "master mode" (supervisor state), in which memory protection 
does not apply.  The program could then poke a large value into its 
"privilege level" byte (normally write-protected) and could then proceed to 
bypass all levels of security within the file-management system, patch the 
system monitor, and do numerous other interesting things.  In short, the 
barn door was wide open.

	Motorola quite properly reported this problem to XEROX via an 
official "level 1 SIDR" (a bug report with a perceived urgency of "needs to 
be fixed yesterday").  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a 
database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola followed 
the approved procedure:  they simply reported the problem as "Security 
SIDR", and attached all of the necessary documentation, ways-to-reproduce, 
etc, separately.

	Xerox apparently sat on the problem;  They either didn't acknowledge 
the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary operating-
system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official patch.

	Time passed (months, as I recall).  The Motorola guys pestered their 
Xerox field-support rep to no avail.  Finally they decided to take Direct 
Action, to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the system could 
be cracked, and just how thoroughly the system security systems could be 
subverted.

	They dug around through the operating-system listings, and devised a 
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then incorporated 
into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.  Robin Hood and 
Friar Tuck were designed to run as "ghost jobs" (daemons, in Unix 
terminology);  they would use the existing loophole to subvert system 
security, install the necessary patches, and then keep an eye on one 
another's statuses in order to keep the system operator (in effect, the 
superuser) from aborting them.

	So, one day, the system operator on the main CP-V software-
development system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual 
phenomena.  These included the following (as I recall;  it's been a while 
since I heard the story):

	- Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of 
		a job

	- Disk drives would seek back and forth so rapidly that they'd 
		attempt to walk across the floor

	- The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself 
		and punch a "lace card" (every hole punched).  These would 
		usually jam in the punch

	- The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin 
		Hood to Friar Tuck, or vice versa

	- The Xerox card reader had two output stackers;  it could be 
		instructed to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A 
		unless a card was unreadable, in which case the bad card was 
		placed into stacker B.  One of the patches installed by the 
		ghosts added some code to the card-reader driver.  After 
		reading a card, it would flip over to the opposite stacker.  
		As a result, card decks would divide themselves in half when 
		they were read, leaving the operator to recollate them 
		manually

	I believe that there were some other effects produced, as well.

	Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.  They found the bandit ghost jobs running, and X'ed them...  and were once again surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed, the following sequence of events took place:

	!X id1

	id1:  Friar Tuck...  I am under attack!  Pray save me!  (Robin Hood)
	id1:  Off (aborted)

	id2:  Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff of 
		Nottingham's men!

	id3:  Thank you, my good fellow!  (Robin)

	Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, 
and would start a new copy of the recently-slain program within a few 
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them 
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.

	Finally, the system programmers did the latter, only to find that 
the bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It turned out 
that these two programs had patched the boot-time image (the /vmunix file, 
in Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list of programs that were to 
be started at boot time.

	The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when 
the system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and reinstalled 
the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch for this problem.

	I believe that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management 
about the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.  To the 
best of my knowledge, no serious disciplinary action was taken against 
either of these guys.

	Several years later, both of the perpetrators were hired by 
Honeywell, which had purchased the rights to CP-V after Xerox pulled out of 
the mainframe business.  Both of them made serious and substantial 
contributions to the Honeywell CP-6 operating system development effort.  
Robin Hood (Dan Holle) did much of the development of the PL-6 system-
programming language compiler;  Friar Tuck (John Gabler) was one of the 
chief communications-software gurus for several years.  They're both alive 
and well, and living in LA (Dan) and Orange County (John).  Both are among 
the more brilliant people I've had the pleasure of working with.

		     FOODPORN:  Pornography for dieters

Dear Editors,

	I read your fine magazine eagerly each month, and one of my favorite 
features is the letters you receive from your readers.  I always enjoy 
hearing about their exploits, but until now I never thought anything like 
that could ever happen to me.  However all that changed last Friday night, 
when I had one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and felt I 
just had to write and share it with everyone.

	It was about 10:30 PM and I was sitting in my dorm room going over 
some boring math homework that I really didn't feel like doing.  Normally 
there is plenty to do on Friday nights at my college, but it was the first 
day of spring break and the campus was practically deserted.  Since I 
couldn't afford to go to Florida with my buddies, I was forced to spend the 
vacation on campus by myself.  I was fully expecting a rather dull week of 
nothing but studying and watching TV.

	Anyway, I was concentrating on my math book when suddenly I heard a 
loud bang and a screech coming from outside.  I rushed to the window to see 
what had happened.  On the street below I saw a white minivan with the words 
"Carlo's Italian Restaurant" on the side.  The van pulled slowly to the side 
of the road, obviously suffering from a tire blowout.  Relieved at an excuse 
to break up the monotony of my studying, I decided to go outside and see if 
I could be of any help.

	As I approached the van I could see the driver, an overweight, 
brown-haired woman who introduced herself as Gail.  We both examined the 
flat tire and I asked Gail where she was heading.  She said she was supposed 
to deliver an order of Italian food to a party, some rich eccentrics who 
lived in the upper part of town, she said.  But the party had been cancelled 
at the last minute and she was returning with their order.  She said she 
didn't think there was a spare tire in the van but I suggested that we take 
a look anyway.

	We went around to the back of the van and Gail opened the rear 
doors.  A warm rush of steam came from inside, carrying the rich scent of 
fresh tomato sauce and Italian bread.  In the cargo area were trays and 
trays of lasagna, meatballs, and pork smothered in sauce.  A stack of pizza 
boxes lay to one side, and I could see what looked like a case of beer 
towards the back.  Never in my wildest fantasies had I seen anything like 
the banquet that lay before me now.  After living on lousy school cafeteria 
food for the past two months, it all seemed something like a dream come 
true.

	Gail looked around and said she couldn't find the spare tire.  She 
sighed, giving me a strangely seductive look.  "Well," she said, "I guess I 
won't be able to get back to the restaurant for a while.  It would sure be a 
shame to let all this food go to waste."  At that, I knew something 
incredible was about to happen.  Gail manuevered her pudgy frame into the 
back of the truck.  I couldn't believe my eyes as she began unwrapping the 
mountain of food before us.  "Here," she said, handing me a huge tray of 
lasagna.  The dish was warm and heavy and full of rich Italian smells.  When 
I looked back I noticed that Gail had started without me and was already 
busy with a large, greasy pepperoni pizza.

	I sat on the edge of the van and removed the tin foil from the 
lasagna tray.  I peeled the foil back slowly, carefully, revealing the hot 
pleasures within.  The sauce oozed like lava around the melty mozarella 
cheese, and pools of oil were everywhere.  I ran my finger along the edge of 
the plate, and then gently through the heart of the food, delighting in the 
warm, slippery feel of the pasta underneath.  After a few minutes of working 
my fingers in and out, I removed them and slowly licked off the sweet-
tasting sauce.

	My sense of hunger heightened, I lifted the tray closer to my face.  
My hands sank into the center of the lasagna, scooping out huge globs of 
pasta, sauce, and cheese.  I lifted the food to my mouth and stuffed it 
sloppily into my waiting hole.  I chewed and swallowed deeply, my eyes 
closed in ecstacy.  My entire digestive tract tingled as the food made its 
way down my esophagus and into the pit of my stomach.  Incensed, I grabbed 
hungrily for the lasagna, stuffing my mouth till it was about to burst, 
choking it down so fast that it almost hurt, and stuffing my face again.  In 
a matter of minutes I had lapped up the entire tray, licking it clean so as 
to get every drop.

	I stood up and caught my breath.  After such a feast I was sure I 
could eat no more, but the sight of several open pizza boxes soon had me 
going again.  Reaching out, I tore off about half of a huge 15-inch pizza 
covered with pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage.  I folded the thick dough 
and thrust the pizza mouthward, alternately chewing at the crust and then 
sucking in the tender, cheesy filling.  My mind in a blissful daze, I spent 
the next several minutes in this position, until I had devoured every last 
mouthful.

	By this time Gail had discovered the beer, and she handed me a tall, 
frosty bottle.  I wrenched off the cap and lifted the beer to my mouth, 
pouring it eagerly down my throat.  As I drank in a frenzy, beer spilled out 
the corners of my mouth and dripped onto my face, neck and clothing.  
Oblivious to the world, I continued consuming the brew like a madman until 
every drop was gone.

	Finally, I could take no more.  Grasping my stomach, I stumbled 
towards the grass on the side of the road.  I opened my mouth and burped 
into the warm night, longer and louder than I had ever done before.  The 
substance of my belch seemed to hang in the air in front of me, thick with 
the aroma of pizza and beer.  I burped a second time, then lay on the soft 
ground and fell into a deep, satisfying sleep.

	When I awoke several hours later, Gail and the restaurant van were 
gone.  I never saw them again after that night, but the fond memories of our 
encounter will stay with me forever.  Perhaps someday I'll meet Gail again, 
and if I do I'll be sure to write and tell you all about it.  --Name and 
address withheld by request

	A cat's ability to land on its belly --- not its feet, as folklore 
has it --- may explain why only three of 132 felines who fell from great 
heights were dead on arrival at a veterinary hospital, and why more than 
three-quarters recovered.

	In a study of 22 cats that dropped more than seven stories, only one 
died, according to the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical 
Association.

	The cat that took the longest plunge --- 32 stories --- walked away 
with only chest and lung bruises and a chipped tooth.

	Of the 132 cats whose cases were studied, three were killed and the 
owners of 17 others elected to have them put to sleep, even though 
veterinarians told them their pets could be saved.  Of the remaining 112 who 
were treated, 90 percent recovered

Dear Friend:

	We have the distinquished honor of being on the committee to raise 
five million dollars for the placing of a statue of Ronald Reagan in the 
Hall of Fame in Washington, DC.  We were in a quandary as to where to place 
the statue.  It was not wise to place it beside the statue of George 
Washington, who never told a lie, nor beside the statue of Richard Nixon, 
who never told the truth, since Reagan can never tell the difference.

	We finally decided to place it beside the statue of Columbus, the 
greatest Republican of them all.  He left not knowing where he was going and 
upon arriving did not know where he was;  he returned not knowing where he 
had been and he did it all on borrowed money.

Sincerely,
Reagan Statue Committee

	PS:  It is said that President Reagan is considering having the 
Republicans change their party emblem from an elephant to a condom because 
it stands for inflation, protects a bunch of pricks, halts production, and 
gives a false sense of security while one is being screwed

the United States should now be able to say to Americans who have violated 
no laws or anything, that they cannot go and cannot leave this country

	- Ronald Reagan, 09 April 1980, New York Times -

	(The boycott was always voluntary --- the United States Olympic 
Committee voted to support Carter's appeal and urged its athletes not to 
attend the Summer Games in Moscow)

	I support the boycott today, I supported it yesterday.  And I 
supported it when the President first called for it

	The National Budget

	Our goal, which is a goal we think we can achieve during fiscal year 
1972, is to operate with a balanced budget

	- President Nixon, July 1970 -
	- 1972 federal budget deficit : $ 23.4 billion -

	We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, 
give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978

	- President Ford, September 1976 -
	- 1978 federal budget deficit : $ 59.0 billion -

	I intend to keep my commitment of a balanced budget at the end of 
four years

	- President Carter, December 1976 -
	- 1980 federal budget deficit : $ 73.8 billion -

				 * * * * *

	I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert 
with a number of fine economists, all of whom believe that it can provide 
for a balanced budget by 1983, if not earlier

	- Presidential candidate Reagan, October 1980 -
	- 1983 federal budget deficit : $ 207.8 billion -

				 * * * * *

	This Administration is committed to a balanced budget, and we will 
fight to the last blow to achieve it by 1984

	- President Reagan, September 1981 -
	- 1984 federal budget deficit : $ 185.3 billion -

	Total National Debt, July 1987 : $ 2.3 trillion

	I'm still confused by Iran/Contra.  President Reagan keeps saying he 
knows nothing about it, and doctors keep cutting pieces off his nose

	And, last but not least, a few words of wisdom.  It's true that 
mankind does not live by bread alone, and we've pretty much proved that 
axiom with these unusual masterpieces.  To quote someone much smarter than 
myself (hi, kalen!):  "I am non-denominational --- I accept all forms of 
currency.  So, open your hearts and empty your pockets!"

	A wonderful sentiment, don't you think?

	We will acknowledge, in print, those with the warmest thoughts for 
our survival...

	If those among you would kindly send in junk that you have no other 
use for, stuff that you read and find humorous, filth that no one else will 
take, stories absurd or preposterous, news that isn't fit to line 
litterboxes anywhere, if you would send those gems to us here at The Humus 
Report, we'd appreciate it.  Our address will be given to you near the end 
of our report.  We will cull from the post office box all death threats and 
denunciations, and print what we can of whatever is left.  The rest is up to 
you...

	We would appreciate it if:  (1) the sending of copyrighted material 
for publication was sent ONLY if you also send along a legal release for us 
to use that material;  (2) if you should see non-attributed copyrighted 
material in our stuff, please let us know ASAP so we can take appropriate 
actions;  (3) if you like what we do here, please donate whatever you feel 
appropriate, so that we can continue to bring you this stuff month after 
month...

	I also have a program contained within CKP-MSG.ZIP from which 
virtually everything you will see here can be found, and then some.  For a 
nominal cost per year, I will provide the latest copy of the ibm/compat 
program AND the latest updates of the datafile to you...  address inquiries 
about this program and/or the datafile to the address near the end of our 
report...

	We leave you now with a few thoughts...
