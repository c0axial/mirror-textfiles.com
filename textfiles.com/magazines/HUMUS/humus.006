A few words:::

	Well, it's been a little bit too long between issues, and I 
apologize for that, but things around my chaotic manor have been slightly 
more confused than normal.  Fortunately, as I appear to be enjoying myself 
thoroughly, they don't promise to become any less confusing until xmastime.

	This issue will contain, among other things, the second in our 
never-ending series on phone answering machine messages, "Twilight Phone, 
The Sequel," as well as our usual assortment of odd and bizarre items...

	This show can thank the following people:  Peter Klein ("RAYGN"), 
the inventor of phone answering machines AND the Phone Answering Machine 
Comedians of America (PAMCA), a few politicians, a director of surgery, a 
Chinese restaurant named "Hygiene" and, I'm sure, just a few other little 
goodies...  So, without further adieu, on with the show...

	The Theory of Dark Suckers

	For years it was believed that light wes emitted from an electric 
bulb;  recent information has proven otherwise --- dark is sucked into the 
bulb --- therefore, the bulb is a dark sucker.

	There are many types and sizes of dark suckers.  The largest 
manufacturers of dark suckers are General Electric and Sylvania.  Some 
modern dark suckers utilize solid power to operate properly.  Solid power 
units can be purchased from Eveready, Exide, and Duracell.

	The dark sucker theory proves the existence of dark suckers as well 
as proving that dark is heavier than light.  Some examples are as follows:

	Electric bulbs:  There is less dark near the electric bulb than at a 
distance of 100 feet when it is operating;  therefore, it is sucking dark 
and can be classified as a dark sucker.  The larger the dark sucker, the 
greater the distance it can suck dark.  The larger the dark sucker, the 
greater its capacity of dark.  The dark sucking capabilities are evident 
when the dark sucker has reached its capacity and will no longer suck dark.  
At that point, you may notice the dark area on the inside portion of the 
dark sucker.  The larger the dark sucker, the larger the area of dark found 
within.  This type of dark sucker can be made directional by placing a 
shield around a portion of the unit or behind it.  This will prevent dark 
from entering the dark sucker from that side thereby extending the range of 
the dark sucker on the unprotected/unshielded side.

	Candles:  primitive dark suckers:  There is more dark 30 feet from a 
lit candle than there is at a distance of 3 feet.  Proof of its dark sucking 
capabilities is relatively simple.  Examine a new unused candle, notice that 
the center core is not dark.  Ignite the center core.  Allow the center core 
to burn for about 5 minutes.  Notice the lack of dark around the candle.  
Extinguish the candle flame.  Notice that the center core of the candle is 
now dark.  The center core is a dark sucker protected by a soft insulator to 
extend its life expectancy and maintain rigidity to verify that this 
primitive dark sucker is operating properly.  Ignite the center core and 
allow it to burn for a minimum of 2 minutes.  Pass a clean pencil over the 
top of the flame, left to right, approximately 3 inches above the center 
core.  Notice that there is no dark on the pencil.  Pass the pencil over the 
center core now about 1/2 inch.  Notice that the pencil now has a dark area.  
The pencil blocked the path of the dark being sucked to the core of the dark 
sucker.  This type dark sucker is very primitive and does not suck dark any 
great distance, nor does it have a large capacity.

	Dark sucker solid power units may be purchased locally at a variety 
of outlets.  Size does not determine the life expectancy of the dark sucker 
solid power unit.  These solid power units work with many modern dark 
suckers, and absorb dark from the dark sucker.  The absorbed dark is 
converted to solid power within the unit.

	An example of the conversion of dark into solid power in the 
automobile of today:  Notice an auto in use during dark hours.  Two 
(possibly four) large dark suckers are located on the front.  On the rear 
there are two (or 3) smaller dark suckers with red filters.  You may also 
notice several dark suckers with yellow filters.  These filters are required 
to remove a percentage of red and yellow from total dark so as to energize 
the solid power unit.  The solid power unit permits the auto to be utilized 
during hours of no dark by the dark it has absorbed.  The number of dark 
suckers varies with the age of the automobile.  Newer automobile solid power 
units require a greater percentage of red-filtered dark.  Older units 
generally require more non-filtered dark.  The solid power unit of the 
automobile has a dark interior.

	This can be proved by cutting the solid power unit in half.  Dark is 
heavier than light.  Dark always settles to the bottom of a lake and/or 
river.  Submerge just below the surface of a lake and you will notice an 
absence of dark.  Lower yourself to 15 feet below the surface and you will 
notice a degree of darkness even on a sunny, bright day.  Lower yourself to 
50 feet (or more) below the surface and you are in total dark.  Ergo, the 
dark has settled to the bottom;  therefore, dark is heavier than light.

	Modern technology has allowed us to utilize the dark that has 
settled to the bottom of large rivers through the creation of turbines which 
push the dark downriver to the ocean, which has a larger holding capacity 
for dark and is a common safe storage location.  As the dark is passed 
through the turbine, a percentage of solid power is removed and transmitted 
to various short term storage plants for many usages.  Prior to turbines, it 
was much more difficult to move the dark from rivers to storage areas such 
as deep lakes or the ocean.  The Indians would paddle their canoes very 
little and not very deeply if they were going in the direction of flow of 
dark so as not to slow it down.  However, if they were traveling opposite 
the natural flow of dark, they would dig their paddles very deep and rapidly 
to assist the flow of dark to its ocean storage place.

	Dark is faster than light.  If you would open a drawer very slowly, 
you will notice that the light goes into the drawer.  You can see this 
happen.  You cannot see the dark leave the drawer.  Continue to open the 
drawer and light will continue to enter the drawer;  however, you will not 
see any dark leave the drawer.  Therefore, dark is faster than light.  Go 
into a closet, close the door, and turn off the dark sucker.  Have a friend 
open the door about 1 inch.  Your friend will not see any dark leave the 
closet, nor will you.  Have your friend open the door until half the closet 
is dark and half is light.  Since 2 objects cannot occupy the same space at 
the same time, and you do not feel any change in pressure, by compressing 
the dark, it is logical to assume that dark is faster than light.

	One last proof.  What is a by-product of movement of dark?  Heat.  
What is a by-product of dark suckers?  Heat again.  Therefore, a dark sucker 
generates heat during its operation, sucking dark from the surrounding area

	Speaking of folks that don't think along the same lines as "normal" 
folk, Peter Klein is a programmer who works in the Seattle area.  This is 
not to say that he doesn't think "normally," nor is this to point out that 
the Seattle area in general has more than its share of such people.  Such 
disclaimers aren't necessary when dealing with people who share common 
interests, even though those interests aren't the only aspects that appeal 
to one such as myself during particular phases of the Moon...

	Oh.  Where was I?

	Oh, yeah...  Peter is a nice guy, and his politics just happen to 
coincide with mine from time to time...

BLUECHIP SOFTWARE ANNOUNCES RAYGN --- AN OLD LANGUAGE IN NEW CLOTHES
by Peter A Klein

	In an attempt to crack more conservative markets, BlueChip Software 
has introduced a new computer language, RAYGN.  RAYGN is an enhanced version 
of Orange County BASIC, which is in turn a highly refined version of "Hoover 
Trojan Horse BASIC" (though its authors vehemently deny this, we've seen the 
code -- Ed.).  

	Like interpreted BASIC, RAYGN is comfortable, old and a little slow.  
It is very good at simple graphics.  It is often inaccurate.  But somehow 
the manual always manages to convince the user that it is his perception of 
the problem (rather than RAYGN's answer) that is actually wrong.  Ordinary 
people like RAYGN because it is simple, direct, and reminds them of less 
complicated times.

	RAYGN offers many extensions to BASIC.  It features a new logical 
function, MORAL, sometimes called "Falwell's Contextual Boolean."  MORAL(x) 
may evaluate to either TRUE or FALSE regardless of the actual value of x.  
All that matters is whether x is on the left or right side of an expression.  
A new function called KEISTER has been added, but nobody is sure what it 
does.

	Fixed-point variables of types MILDOLLAR, BILDOLLAR and TRILDOLLAR 
have been added.  These may only have negative values (though positive 
values have been promised in time for the next release).  When using these 
variable types, a function called COST$2MUCH may be employed. COST$2MUCH(x) 
always evaluates to TRUE, unless the expression 4DEFENSE(x) is also true, in 
which case RAYGN will double or triple the value of x.

	RAYGN's authors believe that their style of programming and memory 
resource allocation is the ONLY true way to program.  Thus, RAYGN's 
automatic housecleaning facilities are, shall we say, a bit aggressive.  It 
will eliminate any variables it believes are wasteful or unnecessary.  It 
may even do this while the variables are in use!  It is then the 
responsibility of the user to trim his program or give up on it.  According 
to RAYGN's developers, this encourages the writing of tight code.

	Further, if RAYGN discovers any other languages or software in its 
directories, it will attempt to reorganize them according to its own 
principles.  Normally, this does not matter, because users of RAYGN are so 
devoted that they wouldn't dream of using another language, anyway.  
However, hard disk users should be careful to keep other software in 
separate directories.  This will often suffice, because RAYGN will normally 
not interfere with programs in other directories unless they are very small, 
employ annoyingly flashy graphics, or attempt to write to RAYGN's 
directories.

	But certain software is incompatible with RAYGN and may not exist on 
the same disk with it.  RAYGN's authors are unalterably opposed to programs 
that make use of bitwise left shift operators.  If RAYGN detects even the 
slightest use of left shift, it will attempt to recode or destroy the 
offending program regardless of what directory it is in.  It does no good to 
have such files write-protected, because RAYGN will then switch to direct 
hardware calls (known as "covert disk operations").

	RAYGN has some very limited "artificial intelligence" capabilities.  
It can detect syntax errors and constructions inconsistent with its 
developers' philosophy of programming, even before the RETURN key is 
pressed.  When such conditions occur, RAYGN will display the warning 
message, "Go ahead, make my day!"  When RAYGN encounters a problem it can't 
solve, it will always default to routines in the library PRIVATSEC.TOR.  
This library has been somewhat unstable of late, so results are uncertain.

	RAYGN may be identified by the prompt string "Well...>"  If the 
angle bracket fails to appear, RAYGN is "asleep" and not ready for input.  
The user must press RETURN several times until the bracket appears.  RAYGN 
is highly compatible with a pointing device known as the "PC Meese," which 
is also available from RAYGN's developers.  It has been noted that the 
language responds much quicker to the Meese than to input from the keyboard, 
or any other device

============================================================================

	And unfortunately, of course, RAYGN software comes with a user 
license for eight years, and a warranty that things will probably go wrong 
long after the license expires...

	I would like to believe that there is some justice in the world for 
the little guy;  you know the one...  S/he's been hard at work for eight 
hours every day, making enough money to buy little trinkets that enhance the 
quality of life beyond food, clothes and a roof...

	We'd like to believe in a fairy tale land where the big guys, the 
corporations, the incorporations, and the companies, the lawyers, the 
doctors, the software publishing firms altruistically helped the little 
guy...  where they were all held accountable for quality and selection...  
where, when things went wrong, there was no question of letting you "go it 
alone"...  where this "warranty" would never be thought of, much less wished 
for fervently...

	7.  REMEMBER, YOU PROMISED!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	One might wonder what the bank would think of something like that, 
especially if it were imprinted in "fine print" upon every check?

	I can't help but chuckle at the thought...  :)

	About three or four months ago, we ran a little piece on phone 
answering machine messages...  Well, we have a few more to add to our ever-
increasing library of odd, and we'd like to share them with you...  Welcome

time.  I hope I'm good.  And I hope I don't finish too soon.  Here goes:

	The outgoing message on a friend's machine was made up of actual 
Mother Bell phone system error messages.  It went like this:

	*ring*

	"The party you have called is not available.  Your call is being 
diverted to an alternate number.  Please stand by..."

	*ring*

	"The number you have called must be dialed by your 0 operator"

	The news...  such an integral part of our life, and yet we tend to

bring you such well-written items as these you have before you...

	Behold...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	To wash or not to wash your car, that is the dilemma in Moscow.  
Lawmakers with an uncanny feel for a Catch-22 have devised the cleanliness 
rules for Moscow's estimated half-million private motorists.

	Drivers can be fined up to 10 rubles ($11.50) by traffic police if 
they're caught at the wheel of a car officially rated as dirty.

	On the other hand, washing a car inside the city limits is against 
the law.  A violation on this count can result in a fine of 30 rubles or 
more.  But there's more.

	Washing a car out in the country, at a river, lake or reservoir, 
carries an even heavier penalty --- 100 rubles or more.

	So, one would reason, go to a carwash.  But that's another "Gotcha!"

	There are carwashing stations in the capital --- but not nearly 
enough to meet the needs of private car owners.  In fact, the government 
newspaper Izvestia figures, only 1 percent of the city's private cars could 
be cleaned in these stations if they were open 24 hours a day.

	Discouraged?  Hold on.

	All the carwashers in the Moscow metropolitan area are on the 
fringes of the city.  It's a one-hour journey to and from them, with several 
hours of waiting.

	So anyone who admits using such a carwash should be fired for 
absenteeism, Izvestia says

	And, last but not least, a few words of wisdom.  It's true that 
mankind does not live by bread alone, and we've pretty much proved that 
axiom with these unusual masterpieces.  To quote someone much smarter than 
myself (hi, kalen!):  "I am non-denominational --- I accept all forms of 
currency.  So, open your hearts and empty your pockets!"

	A wonderful sentiment, don't you think?

filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run 
over;  so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the 
heart run over

		When love is done
