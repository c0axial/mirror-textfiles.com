An Introduction Would Be In Order:

	Hello, there, fellow friends of weird.  We are very happy to bring 
to you the strangest and most absurd that we can find in a format pleasing 
to the inquiring mind.  We will attempt to bring to you items of focus, 
items for the discriminating thought process that some of us have (usually 
after we order a Whopper with anything on it), items with little social 
redeeming value.  These are our goals, and we wish you to become a small 
part in this orchestration.

	If those among you would kindly send in junk that you have no other 
use for, stuff that you read and find humorous, filth that no one else will 
take, stories absurd or preposterous, news that isn't fit to line 
litterboxes anywhere, if you would send those gems to us here at The Humus 
Report, we'd appreciate it.  Our address will be given to you near the end 
of our report.  We will cull from the post office box all death threats and 
denunciations, and print what we can of whatever is left.  The rest is up to 
you...

	We would appreciate it if:  (1) the sending of copyrighted material 
for publication was sent ONLY if you also send along a legal release for us 
to use that material;  (2) if you should see non-attributed copyrighted 
material in our stuff, please let us know ASAP so we can take appropriate 
actions;  (3) if you like what we do here, please donate whatever you feel 
appropriate, so that we can continue to bring you this stuff month after 
month...

	We would also appreciate it if you would distribute this newsletter far and 
wide, to the six corners of the world, to the heights and depths your soul can 
reach, the ends of the universe, and even to Encino, California, if you should 
happen to be down there before I...  The only restriction I make upon its 
distribution is that NO CHARGE, zero, zilch, nil, none, all of the above, NO 
CHARGE will be made for this newsletter unless I receive 100% of that 
charge...  This means, NO CHARGE for diskette distribution, NO CHARGE for 
inclusion with other junk, NO CHARGE for access, etc...  As I am insured by 
the Guido and Vittorio Pin-Stripe Violin Case Maker Insurance Company, I hope 
there will be no exceptions... 

	I also have a program called CKP-MSG.ARC which contains virtually 
everything you will see here and then some.  For a nominal cost per year, I 
will provide the latest copy of the ibm/compat program AND the latest 
updates of the datafile to you...  address inquiries about this program 
and/or the datafile to the address near the end of our report...

	This show can thank the following people:  caren park (chief bottle 
washer and etc), Jeanie Wilson (Sure Signs That You've Hit Bottom), Tim 
Joseph (the Unified Field Theory), the people in charge of the "Today" 
program, and another cast of few...  So, without further adieu, on with the 
show...

============================================================================

	March, it appears, is the month you will want to have been born in 
if you have an aspirations of becoming a musician or an artist.  If you 
weren't, blame your parents.  It's all their fault.

	Non-Humus-breeders born during March include Frederic Chopin (01 Mar 
1810), Antonio Vivaldi (04 Mar 1678), Maurice Ravel (07 Mar 1875), Georg 
Philipp Telemann (14 Mar 1681), Albert Einstein (14 Mar 1879), Nat King Cole 
(17 Mar 1919), and Johann Sebastian Bach (21 Mar 1685).

	However, it's Amazing BUT True!  March is chock full of people that 
were born during this month, and more than a few of them did their best to 
provide the rest of the world with pure and unadulterated humus.  We honor 
these folk for their contributions to the known world of today...

	Prince Henry the Navigator (04 Mar 1394) sponsored Portuguese 
voyages of discovery, which eventually led to Christopher Columbus and 
Little Richard and Ronald Reagan (well, two out of three ain't bad...);  
Karl Ferdinand von Grafe (08 Mar 1787) helped create modern plastic surgery, 
thus breaking ground for what is present-day downtown Beverly Hills, thus 
giving Phyllis Diller something to do on weekends (don't you like doing 
connect-the-dots with history?);  Leonard "I am NOT Spock, but they keep 
throwing obscene amounts of money at me so I keep doing it" Nimoy (26 Mar 
1931);  and, Vincent van Gogh (30 Mar 1853), the first well-known artist who 
obeyed Marc Antony's admonition to lend an ear...  it's not known WHO he 
lent it to, however...

	March events include The Return of the Buzzards to Hinckley Ohio 
(every Ides of March);  St Patrick's Day (the chance for all to imbibe well 
beyond their limits), and Evacuation Day (does anyone in Boston know why?) 
on the 17th;  The Swallows Make A Mess of San Juan Capistrano on the 19th;  
and, the celebration of life with the first day of Spring AND the start of 
the Persian New Year occur on the 21st...

	Remember when:  First Class postage was raised from 8 to 10 cents 
(02 Mar 1974), and from 15 to 18 cents (22 Mar 1981)?  Pioneer 10 was 
launched on the 3rd, 1972?  Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced 
the PDP-11 computer on the 13th, 1970?

	Congress creates the Territory of Nevada (02 Mar 1861).  Later, 
Congress tries to disappear the State of Nevada with nuclear testing...  
Patrick Henry asks for "Liberty or Death" (23 Mar 1775).  He should have 
asked for "Liberty or Something Else"...  Cocaine hits the big-time with 
Coca-Cola (29 Mar 1886)...  And, 30 Mar 1853 sees a patent granted to Hyman 
Lipman for a pencil with an eraser!

	Oh, yeah.  For those of you with signs of insecurity:

	Pisces :  Avoid extravagant emotions.  You do not fare well in a 
subordinate position.  Let your boss out of that closet before you do 
something he'll long regret...

	When the surgeon came to see her on the morning after her operation, 
the young woman asked her somewhat hesitantly how long it would be before 
she could resume her sex life.  "I really haven't thought about it," gulped 
the stunned surgeon.  "You're the first patient who's asked me that after a 
tonsillectomy!"

	This test will show you just how "pure" you really are.  Hopefully, 
there are more than a few of you that will pass this test.

	Perhaps it should be given to our presidential candidates, and the 
one amongst them who scores the best should be given the job?  :)

	This next piece would be funny, if it weren't almost truth...  One 
of our presidential candidates for 1988, the good Senator Albert Gore Jr, 
Democrat for the South, married a lady named Mary Elizabeth, nicknamed 
"Tipper" some time ago;  sorry, we were unable to find out why to either of 
your unasked questions.  Though she certainly doesn't look like a dog, and 
as of last report, doesn't come when whistled at, her very thoughts were on 
censorship not too long ago, and the following portrays an "artist's 
conception" of those thoughts...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Tipper Gore's Diary
	SPIN magazine, sometime late 1985

Dear Diary:

	What a busy day!  This morning, I chaired another meeting of the 
Parents Music Resource Center Rock Archives Committee.  Keeping sex and 
violence out of records and off videos was just our first goal - that was 
hard enough!  Expunging this filth from the very annals of history is really 
a big job!

	Last week, you'll remember, we banned "Work With Me, Annie" by the 
Midnighter, because it has lines like "Annie please don't cheat, give me all 
my meat."  We also banned their "Sexy Ways", which has such lines as "Upside 
down, all around/Any old way, just pound, pound, pound."  Hard to believe 
the man who wrote these songs also wrote "The Twist" (note to self: review 
Chubby Checker).

	After that we listened to a song the Treniers recorded in 1952 
called "Poon-Tang"!  I can't imagine what they thought they were getting 
away with!  "I got a yen that I'm dyin' to please till I get weak in the 
knees / Gonna get me that poon-tang!  Poon-tang, poon-tang, poon-tang"!  How 
were these young men brought up?  Of course we banned it.  Then we banned 
"Cow Cow Boogie" by Ella Mae Morse, "Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee" by Stick 
McGhee, lots of stuff by Big Joe Turner, and this terrible record by the 
Dominos called "Sixty Minute Man" about some goof who boasts he can maintain 
the sex act for an hour.  (Isn't that a hoot!  Who has the time?)

	Then we banned Jimmy Lloyd's "I Got a Rocket in My Pocket", the 
Invictas' "Do the Hump", Bullmoose Jackson's "Big Ten Inch Record", the 
Versatones' "Tight Skirt, Tight Sweater", the Toppers' "Baby, Let Me Bang 
Your Box", and the Elcords' "Peppermint Stick".  That's the song where the 
words, "Peppermint Stick, eat my dick" keep being repeated.  It's awful how 
that just sticks in your head.

	We got rid of "Big Legged Woman" by Jerry Lee Lewis and "Can't Get 
Enough of That Stuff" by Julia Lee, which has all sorts of smutty lyrics 
such as "Julia always likes her men and whiskey straight."  Then we tossed 
Gene Vincent's "Woman Love", with lines like "I'm lookin' for a woman with a 
one-track mind / A-fuggin' and a-kissin'and a-smoochin' all the time."  This 
was on the flip side of "Be-Bop-a-Lula", which is pretty fishy itself.  Then 
we banned a bunch of songs by Wanda Jackson, like "Let's Have a Party", 
"Mean, Mean Man", and "Fujiyama Mama", in which she sings, "I been to 
Nagasaki, Hiroshima too / The things I did to them, baby, I can do to you / 
Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama and I'm about to blow my top / And when I start 
eruptin', ain't nobody gonna make me stop."  Somebody said Wanda became a 
born-again Christian.  I wonder if the Lord thinks that's enough.

	We started off banning just "Good Golly, Miss Molly","Tutti Frutti", 
and "Long Tall Sally" by Little Richard, but then we figured, the heck with 
it, let's ban everything he did.  Similarly, we were just going to ban "Get 
Up, I Feel Like being a Sex Machine" by James Brown, but then we decided 
since he exudes such primal sexual energy, we ought to ban all his stuff.  
On that basis, out went everything by Wilson Pickett and Tina Turner, and on 
one member's heartrending testimony, Bobby Sherman.  Then somebody mentioned 
that she heard Joni Mitchell slept around alot, so we chucked all her songs, 
too.  All that work left us pretty tuckered out, but we knew we hadn't even 
scratched the surface, so we met bright and early this morning and really 
got to work.

	We banned Lou Christie's "Rhapsody in the Rain" because the BBC 
banned it, and their word is good enough for us.  We banned Ray Charles' "I 
Got a Woman" and a bunch of Chuck Berry songs like "Reelin' and Rockin'" and 
"My Ding-a-Ling", and "Wake Up, Little Susie" by the Everly Brothers, 
because we didn't buy their story that they were just sleeping (if you're 
that tired, go to bed.  Don't tell me Susie, Phil, and Don all dozed off at 
the same second).  We banned the Knack's "Good Girls Don't", Joan Jett's "Do 
You Want to Touch Me", Queen's "Fat Bottomed Girls", and Bob Seger's "Night 
Moves."  We banned Simon and Garfunkel's "Cecila" because the title 
character engages in casual sex and Van Morrison's "Brown-Eyed Girl" because 
the boy and the girl make love behind the stadium.

	We banned "Louie, Louie" by the Kingsmen.  Yes, we know that when 
the song came out, the FCC investigated it for obscenity and found it 
"unintelligible at any speed."  But that's precisely the problem.  Even if 
it's not obscene, it gives the kids a chance to use their imaginations.

	We banned Mark Dinning's "Teen Angel", Ray Peterson's "Tell Laura I 
Love Her", "Last Kiss" by J Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers, and "Leader of 
the Pack" by the Shangri-Las.  They represent a cult of romantic violent 
death.

	We banned "The Times They Are A-Changin'" by Bob Dylan.  I mean, if 
we banned "We're Not Going to Take It" by Twisted Sister, we had to get rid 
of songs that are >really< contemptuous of authority.

	After lunch, we banned Dylan's "Lay, Lady, Lay", Mel and Tim's 
"Backfield in Motion", "Hanky Panky", and "I Think We're Alone Now" by Tommy 
James and the Shondells, Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side", "Will You Still 
Love Me Tomorrow" by the Shirelles, Peter and Gordon's "Lady Godiva", Meat 
Loaf's "Paradise by the Dashboard Light" (this has certainly changed my 
opinion of Phil Rizzutto), "Lola" by the Kinks, and "This Girl Is a Woman 
Now" by Gary Puckett and the Union Gap.  We banned Billy Paul's "Me and Mrs 
Jones" because it glorifies adultery.  We banned the Commodore's "Three 
Times A Lady" (imagine that nice Lionel Richie being involved in something 
like that!).  We banned Lee Dorsey's "Ride Your Pony" because of the lines 
"Now get on your pony and ride.  Now, shoot!  Shoot!"  Oh, I'd like to rub 
that smirk off that Dorsey man's face!

	We had to ban Olivia Newton-John's "Physical" even though it's good 
aerobicise music.

	We also spent some time on "A Brand New Key" by Melanie.  Frankly, I 
didn't see what was wrong with it.  Then someone suggested that I should 
think of the key as Albert's p. and that I should think of myself as the 
roller skate, with a little hole where the key goes... well say no more!  
The things these people try to pull!

	We devoted the rest of the day to listening to everything by Aretha 
Franklin, Mitch Ryder, and the Rolling Stones.  We had to ban nearly all of 
it.  The stuff was either too juvenile or too mature.  We had a big debate 
about how bad the phrase "sock it to me" could be, since President Nixon 
said it on Laugh-In.  But then someone told us that her college roommate had 
a boyfriend who told her that "sock it to me" was what black men said to 
black women when they wanted to have sex, so we concluded Mr Nixon was just 
trying to win black votes.  We discussed "Honky Tonk Women", and whether the 
line was "she blew my nose", which would be OK, or "she blew my hose", which 
would be something very different.  We just banned it all.

	This is exhausting and sordid work, and sometimes I regret having 
taken it on.  I would much rather be spending the afternoon at home, tending 
my rosebushes and catering to Albert's big contributors.  But I am certain I 
am doing the right thing.  Next week we are going to devote our whole 
session to the Captain and Tenille.  I feel bad, because they seem like such 
nice people.  He wears that funny hat and she sings the National Anthem at 
Dodger games, and looks so wholesome.  But they did record "Do That to Me 
One More Time" (you know - "Once is never enough with a man like you").  
We're going to see if we can approve the song by coming up with a "that" 
that would fit the song, and not be the "that" that we really know it is.

	Until next time,
	T

	In the beginning there was Aristotle
	And objects at rest tended to stay at rest,
	And objects in motion tended to come to rest,
	And soon everything was at rest,
	And God saw it was boring.

	Then God created Newton,
	And objects at rest tended to remain at rest,
	But objects in motion tended to remain in motion,
	And energy was conserved and momentum was conserved and matter was 
conserved.
	And God saw it was conservative.

	Then God created Einstein,
	And everything was relative,
	And fast things became short,
	And straight things became curved,
	And the universe was filled with inertial frames,
	And God saw that it was relatively general, but some of it was 
especially relative.

	Then God created Bohr,
	And there was the principle,
	And the principle was quantum,
	And all things were quantified,
	But some things were still relative,
	And God saw that it was confusing.

	Then God was going to create Furgeson,
	And Furgeson would have unified,
	And he would have fielded a theory,
	And all would have been one,
	But it was the seventh day,
	And God rested,
	And objects at rest tend to remain at rest

	A House wag from California introduced a bill Friday to create 
"Reagan's Rough Riders," an expeditionary force of volunteers to keep the 
Panama Canal open in case the new treaties are not ratified and hostilities 
break out.  The bill, sponsored by Representative John L Burton (D-Cal), 
calls for commissioning former California Governor Ronald Reagan as a 
colonel in the Army and giving him a white horse on which to lead his "Rough 
Riders" into combat.  However, if Reagan preferred to remain at headquarters 
in the rear, he would have to supply his own white horse, according to the 
legislation.

	Burton, a San Franciscan given to flights of whimsy, supports the 
Senate ratification of the new pacts to replace the Panama Canal Treaty of 
1903.  The 1903 treaty was signed by then-President Theodore Roosevelt, who 
led the famed charge by "volunteer Rough Riders" up San Juan Hill in Cuba 
during the Spanish-American War.  Reagan is a leader of the opposition to 
the new canal treaties being drawn up in both the House and the Senate

	"The purpose of this message is to provide clarification, on an 
interim basis, to be followed until such time as PRD 70-15 is formally 
revised.  Note that this interim guidance on the conduct of discussions is 
not repeat not a change in policy or concept;  it is solely clarification, 
and should be so construed.  While the clarification is presented in the 
form of a partial revision of PRF70-15, this does not necessarily mean that 
formal revision will follow the same format or composition;  but rather it 
is so presented so that it may be read in context with 70-15, which, of 
course, remains effective.  The affected part of 70-15 is paragraph iii. 
D(2) covering conduct of discussions in cost-reimbursement type contracts 
and all R & D-type contracts"

	The University of New Hampshire at Durham has barred one of its 
students from keeping a boa constrictor in his dormitory room.  The student 
said the action is unfair.

	Thomas Keegan, 22, of Laconia (NH), has owned "Squeeze" for nine 
years.  He said the university was discriminating against his snake because 
it permits other animals that live in cages to stay in the dormitories.  
"Snakes, on the basis of noise and smell, adapt perfectly to dorm life," 
said Keegan.  He added that Squeeze could also be kept in a cage, and that 
the six-foot snake would be less likely to spread diseases than gerbils, 
rats, birds and turtles.  A zoology professor at the university confirmed 
that most diseases from snakes can't be transmitted to humans.

	Nevertheless, Keegan said, he was told to remove the snake from the 
dorm.  He said he had been keeping Squeeze in a converted TV set with two 
padlocks on it.  Keegan also said that he kept the snake locked up to keep 
people from injuring him

	DEMON COMPUTER

	Officials of a large bank have called in exorcists to rid a 
possessed computer terminal of the demon that killed two workers and put 
another in a coma.

	"It sounds absurd and superstitious in these days to talk about 
demonic possession, but we have no other explanation," said Jorge Montalabo, 
vice president of customer relations at the bank in Valparaiso, Chile.

	"In just five months since the terminal was installed, three 
operators were stricken while at its keyboard.

	"Our employees refuse to work with it and fear that if the terminal 
is removed the demon inside will slip into the entire computer system."

	The terminal, consisting of a TV screen and keyboard, was one of 13 
installed in the bank along with a new $7.3 million computer system, said 
Montalabo.

	Two weeks after she began working with it, Luisa Morello, a 27-year-
old mother of two, was found sitting before the video screen, her mouth open 
and an empty look in her eyes.  She was rushed to a hospital where she 
remains --- in a brain-dead coma, said Montalabo.

	Two other women also worked with the terminal.  Each was found by 
co-workers slumped over the keyboard --- dead.  Doctors said the first died 
of a massive stroke.

	No one knows what killed the other, a 22-year-old girl with no 
medical problems.  Baffled doctors who performed an autopsy labeled her 
death as due to "mysterious circumstances," he said.

	"At first, we decided to just remove the terminal," said Montalabo.  
"But the workman who came to carry it away fainted when he tried to unplug 
it from the system.

	"Luckily, he revived a few minutes later.  But our employees began 
calling the terminal cursed by the devil and possessed.  A spokesman for the 
workers said they will all quit unless holy men are brought in to vanquish 
the evil within the device."

	Montalabo said the bank has sent for three Inca spirit-breakers who 
live high in the Andes, 200 miles from the city.  Meanwhile, the terminal 
has been cordoned off and the terrified bank workers give it a wide berth.

	"If the exorcism doesn't work and someone else dies while using the 
terminal, we'll have to scrap all of our computers and spend millions 
getting a new system," said Montalabo.

	"Otherwise, no one will work here"
