                               Introduction. 
                               ------------- 
 
        Due to the inhibitive costs and the general community's negative 
        opinion towards conventional weapons, there has developed a new 
        trend in the terrorist, religious fanatics, minority group and 
        now police and military arms markets.  
 
        Until now, weapons have relied heavily on either high technology, 
        which is expensive, or the spontaneous reactions of chemicals to 
        cause damage which is, although effective, clumsy, not totally 
        reliable and often traceable.  
 
        There is now a pollution free, untraceable, reliable, cheap and 
        effective method of inducing havoc. The Koala, among other 
        animals, is viewed as the harmless, cuddly animal that munches on 
        gum leaves all day long. That is until now. 
 
        The breeding and training of such deadly animals is becoming one 
        of the world's most lucrative businesses. The major advantages to 
        entrepreneurs is the low capital investment, high profit margins 
        and the vast potential market. 
 
        When trained, these animals are not just animals, they're BEASTS! 
 
 
                              Before you begin. 
                              ----------------- 
 
        Before you begin, you should do some research into your 
        clientele. It is good business to have your stock ordered before 
        they are actually ready to be delivered, it is also much safer. 
 
        It is also wise to specialise in one market. Supplying both the 
        terrorist and anti-terrorist markets could lead to embarrassing 
        confrontations and possible defamatory accusations. 
 
 
                           What You Will Need. 
                           ------------------- 
 
        1. A plentiful supply of food.  
        2. A plentiful supply of Fosters Lager. 
        3. Military Grade Fencing. 
        4. A Shot Gun (Self preservation purposes only). 
        5. Good breeding stock.  
        6. GUTS!

        Area 1: 
        ------- 
        One of the more important factors in the training of the Koala is 
        the habitat. The average backyard usually isn't big enough, nor 
        is there usually a sufficient food supply. This is one of the 
        reasons that this is a professional industry, and not really 
        suitable for the home hobbyist. 
 
        You should allow at least a ten metre square plot of land for 
        each Koala you intend to train. It must be heavily planted with 
        gum trees, and it is vital that the perimeter be fenced off, 
        preferably with 3 metre concrete barricades, but industrial 
        strength cyclone fencing is sufficient to begin with, but 
        seriously consider military standard electric fensing. 
 
        That area will be the Koala's off duty and relaxation area where 
        they can eat, sleep and do whatever else Koalas do after a hard 
        day's training. I cannot stress enough how important it is that 
        this area be as comfortable as possible for the Koalas, as a 
        psychologically balanced Koala is far more efficient in combat. 
 
        A plentiful supply of Fosters Lager should be placed in 
        convenient branches throughout this area. Victoria Bitter is also 
        acceptable. Under no circumstances should imported beers be used, 
        especially Kiwi Lager! Death or even worse, phycological damage, 
        may result. 
 
 
        Area 2: 
        ------- 
        The Koala breeding area. This area MUST be securely barricaded 
        from the rest of the compound. It would be disastrous if one of 
        your less desirable male Koalas ruined your breeding program. 
 
 
        Area 3:  
        ------- 
        This is the training area. It should contain various articles of 
        equipment with which the Koalas can improve their skills for the 
        environment in which they will ultimately be unleashed. 
 
        The usual rope bridges, fences, obstacle course items are a good 
        place to start. If you use your imagination you'll probably find 
        many of those articles you've had stuck in your garage for years 
        that you thought you'd use one day, will actually be able to 
        utilized here. I don't recommend you use vaulting horses, but if 
        you do, watch out for unusual enthusiasm on the Koalas' behalf, 
        and do regular head counts. 
 
        This area should also be used for getting your Koala's accustomed 
        to being shot at, bombed etc. A good exercise for this is to put 
        a grenade into a stuffed baby Koala, giving it to a dingo, and 
        unleashing your Koala's on the dingo. The point of the grenade is 
        twofold. One, the Koalas become accustomed to explosions. Two, it 
        is a humane way of destroying the dingo should it somehow survive 
        the Koala attack. 
 
 
        Area 4: 
        ------- 
        Guard towers. As a precautionary measure to give advanced warning 
        of impending legal matters, and more importantly to keep a 
        watchful eye on the compound. It could lead to difficult 
        questions being asked of your activities if several blood hungry 
        Koala's escaped and began slaughtering the neighbours. 
 
 
        Breeding. 
        --------- 
        The most important aspect of this business is a well planned 
        breeding program. The best stock to use is the Tasmanian Koala. 
        Recognised worldwide for their superior qualities, especially 
        their swimming abilities and heavy vehicle dodging abilities. 
 
        Once a suitable breeding pair is found, you should begin your 
        breeding program as soon as possible. It will take at least three 
        generations of carefully monitored breeding until you have a born 
        and bred Killer Koala. 
 
        With that in mind, you may be interested in trying cross breeds, 
        depending on your target market of course. For amphibian attacks, 
        you could try crossing a Koala with a Platypus. Consider the 
        abilities of this creature; the Combat Koalapus. 
 
 
                            Other Things To Try. 
                            -------------------- 
 
        Instead of breeding Koalas, there are many other animals that can 
        be bred and trained for equally devastating results. Sometimes 
        Koalas just aren't suitable for the climate, the terrain or other 
        factors degrading their performance. Here are some other animals 
        you may consider experimenting with:

                            Potential Markets. 
                            ------------------ 
 
        In the domestic market there are hundreds of unexploited 
        opportunities waiting for your attention. Perfect for the home 
        enthusiast, or someone without sufficient capital to invest in a 
        large scale operation. All you require is inventiveness and a bit 
        of ingenuity. 
 
        Once you have the domestic market in your grip it is time to 
        expand. The religious fanatics, minority groups, terrorists and 
        mafia/triads are just waiting to be introduced to the marvels of 
        modern creatures of destruction. 
 
        Why stop there? Why not become an international arms 
        supplier. There are a multitude of emerging nations without 
        sufficient funds to employ full scale armies to conquer their 
        enemies. An inexpensive alternative is their only option, and you 
        can provide that alternative. With the correct contacts [Also 
        read as Bribes - Ed] you may even be able to attain a Federal 
        Government Export Assistance Grant. 
 
        Think of it. A thousand Attack Armadillos, supported by 500 
        Kamikaze Kangaroos attacking some unsuspecting troops armed only 
        with grenades, machine guns, rocket launchers. Pity them! 
 
 
        Ideas

        The Mormon Market: After the door is slammed in their face,    
        they open their briefcase with one of your Hyperactive    
        MegaTermites. Once the door is down, they set loose one of your 
        Atheist Seeking Aardvarks, and they're 90% of the way to another 
        successful conversion. 
 
        The School Market: The fat kid that is always getting picked on 
        one day just can't take it any longer. He saves up his lunch 
        money, and buys one of your Homework Hungry House Mouse. He goes 
        to school as usual, but the first kid that calls him "fatty" 
        today will have to think of a better excuse than Joe's mouse ate 
        all my homework.

                             ==========
                             By SYN ...

        Choosing a Pet.
        ---------------

        It is very important when choosing a pet to take into
        consideration all aspects of keeping that pet happy and healthy.
        You must select the pet that is right for you! [Is that why
        SYN ... has a dog? - ED]

        FISH.
        -----
        These must be amoung the easiest of pets to keep. Once an
        aquarium has been set up they are both cheap and quick to look
        after. [I look at my fish tank after sex, what about you
        SYN ...? -Ed]

        If you find a few fish lying on the bottom with slightly twisted
        backs, then it is an indication that the water is polluted or that
        you forgot to feed the fish for the past two months. [God! My
        fish karked it after only two weeks without food - Ed.] 

        When you find that all the plants have died and that you can no
        longer see through the glass then it is time to clean the tank.
        It is an idea to remember to remove the fish from the tank
        before draining out the water. [So that's what I did wrong! -Ed.]

        Oh, above all else, don't forget; don't eat the green ones, they
        aren't ripe yet! [Witty isn't she? -Ed.]


        BIRDS.
        ------

        Another hint for the animal lover who does not wish to spend a
        great deal of time in upkeep of their pet(s). Quite deceptive
        really, caged birds make more mess than an elephant in a
        strawberry patch. [And slightly less than a baby in a food
        processor with the top left off! -Ed.]

        If you wake up one morning to find your birds a little cold and
        stiff it is a sign that you forgot to wash the spray off the
        lettuce leaves you gave them the night before. [Or that you left
        the gas oven on, and it wasn't alight. Don't light up a cigarette
        to test which it was! -Ed.]

        Budgies: If you ever need to catch them, make sure you have
        rubber hands or cast iron gloves- they bite! [I know women like
        that! -Ed.]  One small problem incurred is that they don't always
        let go when you do [Are we talking budgies or the women I 
        know? -Ed.], and shaking your hand vigorously to flick them off 
        does wonders to the quality and quantity of stock as they are flung
        against the wall. Also, be careful not to give into the
        tempation of strangling the rotten little sods when you find
        their beak comming through the other side of your finger. 
        [That narrows it down to 3 women I know. -Ed]

        All this too much to cope with? How about you befriend some of
        the local inhabitants of the area. [If they're female I know
        most of them already. -Ed] All those bird scraps just
        crumble and sprinkle on the verandah. You will soon be mates
        with many a sparrow, their brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles,
        cousins, friends etc etc. Just remember not to sit or lean on
        the railings anymore.

        Ever thought how nice it would be to have a feathered friend
        keep you company when you went for a swim? [I've been swimming
        with birds before! -Ed] Well, a duck is the pet for you. [I
        haven't played that game before. Sounds almost as much fun as
        Plat-A-Pussy! -Ed] This time, just remember not to walk on your
        lawn bearfoot anymore.

        Your alarm clock doesn't work any more? Get some chooks! Without
        fail, your new rooster will graciously awake you at dawn, and
        this multi-purpose pet will even more graciously appear as
        Sunday's dinner within the month. 

        And if you feel that birds alone are not enough for you, never
        fear! Within a few weeks your aviary or garage can become the
        new home for all the local mice and their offspring. 


        DOGS: (Man's best friend - How's that for original!?)
        -----------------------------------------------------
        [And I thought there were better things in life than dogs!? -Ed]

        Exercise is the most important thing besides everthing else. [? -Ed]
        Depending on the weather and time of day will result in how your
        dog wishes to exercise you. Most likely it will wish to give you
        a 10 mile run when it's 35 degrees outside. [I thought a hundred
        push-ups at 3am while stark naked was bad enough! SYN ..., I'm
        not going out with you ever again if that's what it takes! -Ed]

        And of course many cross country tracks that you never dreamed
        of trecking will be followed as your dog races after rabbits or
        the local cat. [And I thought dogs liked playing with balls! -Ed]

        AND remember, your dog is the most lovable just when you have
        given it a bath. [Showers aren't that bad either. Especially if
        you've got a bottle of baby oil. -Ed] 

        If you like playing golf, then be sure to get your dog when it
        is still young. By the time it's grown you will have your very
        own 32 hole golf course in the back yard - free of charge.

        (4 Pages of really boring comments that I couldn't make any
        statements about were deleted here. In short, dogs dig up your
        garden, make a mess of your lawn, have problems having puppies
        and are still loved by some people. -Ed]


        Miscellaneous.
        --------------

        After a generous, caring pet? How about a guinea pig? They will
        undoubtedly leave you with a lovely(?) warm feeling in your lap
        after petting them. [I really think I should leave the gaffer
        tape joke out of this... but REALLY SYN ..., I expected better
        from YOU! -Ed]

        Want to get rid of that unused look of your new sofa? Then a cat
        will be your choice. It will quickly select your sofa as it's
        bed and a great means of sharpening it's claws. [I've had my
        sofa messed up by a pussy or two myself! -Ed]

        Goats are great when you are spring cleaning. You might leave
        clothes lying around for some variety in their diet. 

        Rabbits are good for an inexpensive irrigation system in your
        back yard and under your house. [Plus you can offer someone you
        really hate some cheat sultanas. -Ed]

        Sheep are great for keeping the lawns down. (Anohter multi-
        purpose pet?) [Is that why New Zealanders have such well kept
        lawns? -Ed]


        Conclusion.
        -----------

        Well folks, I hope you are slightly more informed as to which
        pet is best suited to you.

        Things to remember:

        * Don't forget to feed.
           This can be determined with practice. Increase food
           when you have trouble seeing your pet.

        * Don't overfeed!
           You have overdone it a little when your pet can no
           longer move.

        * Give plenty of exercise.
           It is best to put a leash around your pet galah's 
           ankle, unlike a dog. 

        * Choose your pet according to your facilities.
          - Don't be so inconsiderate as to purchase a duck
            without a swimming pool!
          - A dog if you don't have a garden it can excavate.
          - A puppy if you don't have new carpets - oh, and 
            don't forget to leave your new Ug Boots lying around 
            either!

        Have Fun choosing your new pet now! SYN ...

        to much rivalry between the males
        whenever a new female appears.
        (eg Julie Alderman). Observations suggest that when a new
        female appears the males all fight to win her over. What they
        do is they all send as many sexually-orientated message as they
        can. The female shows she has accepted a certain mate by
        telling him in a public message to stop it. This way everyone
        knows she made her decision, and everyone knows who it is.
          In the Julie Alderman case, she appears to have chosen
        Fearless Fred as her partner.

          The distinctions between the male and the female of the
        species are difficult to spot at a distance. On numerous
        occasions the males have made passes at a feminine-sounding
        user, only to find to their great embarassment "she's" really
        a guy.
 
           FURTHER EVOLUTION:

          There is one other species which is even more advanced than
        the desirable user in terms of evolution. This is the SYSOP.

        BREEDING: Despite the fact that most SysOps behave like the
                  proverbial rabbits when it comes to breeding, there
                  are still very few of them.
                    This may be due to the glaring absence of female
                  sysops; there are few if any, so SysOps sometimes
                  get on with non-SysOps, leading to the cross-breed
                  called the Assistant SysOp.

         Dear Sir, 
 
         I would like to make a complaint on the morals of our society. 
         I was walking along one day, in Carlton it was, minding my own  
         business (walking on the other side of the street where the  
         50 wogs were standing waiting for the painters to do their 
         room) when I saw this most despicable thing.  This old lady was 
         ACTUALLY GIVING MILK TO A STRAY CAT!!  The obscenity of the scene 
         was almost too much to bear. 
 
         I went over to the little old dear and kicked her in the guts and  
         asked her what the fuck she was feeding the cat for?  She groaned  
         and said "Because it is a nice thing to do."  I know that if you  
         were there then you too would have kicked her too.  I picked up  
         the cat and hurled it into the oncoming traffic and had my efforts 
         gratified by seeing it run over by a semi. 
 
         I hope you will join me in helping to rid the world of kind little  
         old ladies who feed cats and have little yapping terriers that 
         don't shut the fuck up. 
 
         Yours Faithfully,

         Dear Mr Death, 
 
         It is heartwarming to read that there are still some people 
         in this world with enough moral fibre to make the effort, 
         cross the road and actually right such wrongs. 
 
         Pity you didn't have an uzi, you could have wiped out the 
         wogs at the same time. 
 
         Sincerely, Ed.

        A while ago we promiced to publish a certain photo revealing
        a certain well known and documented nerd after he held a well
        known and documented communist for ransom. After the relevant
        legal authorities heard we had such a photo we were unable to
        publish it, until now.
