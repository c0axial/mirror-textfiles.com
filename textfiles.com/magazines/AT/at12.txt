              Final draft - THE MEMOIRS OF DIANNE NICHOLS.
                                                                   
                   CHAPTER XXIII - DISAPPOINTMENTS.

    Part I - Vagabond.

    I think when Ze Prophet predicted that Vagabond was my perfect match,
    it was the most absolutely incorrect thing he ever foretold. More of
    a contradiction than a prediction.
    
    I soon found out that the only thing Vagabond and I had in common 
    was that we were both like punctured tyres- Vagabond was never hard, 
    but I always wanted to be pumped, so our relationship was doomed 
    from the start.

    I can still remember our first night together.  We went to the Hairy
    Clam, the official Evil Angels seafood restaurant [editorial
    footnote- This restaurant is already open at 264C Swanston Street,
    just above our cinema] which is managed by Fearless Fred in his spare
    time.

                    --------------------------------------

    EDITORIAL NOTE: It appears Dianne Nichols will remember little of
    what went on in the restaurant, for her memoirs do not elaborate on
    the evening.  However, we have managed to get hold of the video tape
    from the restaurant's security camera, so here is a description of
    the events...                 [Tape Date: 24-01-54  19:32:21]
                                                 
                    --------------------------------------

    "Hello", said Fred as Vagabond and Dianne entered the foyer, "can I
    help you?"

    "We'd like a table for two", said Vagabond.

    "Certainly, sir", said Fred, showing them into the main part of the
    restaurant.

    Fred seemed to be having difficulty keeping his hands off Dianne, so
    he kept them occupied by fishing a notepad and pencil from his
    pocket.

    "Would you like to order now?", he asked Dianne, keeping his back to
    Vagabond.

    "I wouldn't mind tasting your salted mussel", said Dianne, looking    pointedly at Fred's groin.

    "It would go quite well with a bit of a groper", hinted back Fred.

    "Ahh, excuse me", said Vagabond loudly, tapping Fred on the back,
    "I'd like to have crabs."

    "Shuddup!", spat Fred as he span around and shoved a bread roll in
    Vagabond's mouth, "I'm serving the lady!"

    He turned back to Dianne, and said "If you want to try something
    really novel, I could bring my eel out and flop it on the table."

    Dianne could not help giggling, and Fred knew he was 90% of the way
    to getting her away from Vagabond.

    "I've changed my mind", announced Vagabond, "could you change that
    order? I want a floured plaice instead."

    Fred jumped around again and held a clenched fist under Vagabond's
    nose. "It'll be a ploughed face you'll get in a minute! Now stop
    interrupting!" Fred gesticulated in a way that would have made Basil
    Fawlty leap away.

    [Editorial note- if you own the restaurant, it's okay to behave like
    Fred is now, but don't expect a tip. - FP]

    "I think I'll..."

    "What's there to drink?", asked Dianne.

    "I'll just get the wine waiter", said Fred, "FORD!!! Fucking get over
    here!"

    Ford Prefect came from across the room and ogled at Dianne as Fred
    headed towards the kitchen with the order. Originally, Fred, with his
    vast knowledge of alcoholic amalgamation, was to be the wine waiter,
    but then everyone else involved with the restaurant realised that
    introducing Fred to the entire supply of alcohol in a restaurant
    would be less sensible than introducing neutrons to uranium-235.

    "Hello Dianne", said Ford, "can I interest you in an Orgasm?"

    "Ford!", yelled Fred from across the restaurant, "she's mine! Just
    serve her! Wines, NOT COCKTALES!"

    Ford looked puzzled, "If she's all yours, why do you want me to...?"
    He trailed off, then asked, "Did you say serve her, or service her?"

    "I said SERVE her."                                          

    "Oh, right." Ford turned back to Dianne, and handed her a drinks
    list.             

    "I recommend the cheap stuff. I think you'll like the Vino Plonko,    the Evil Angels special home brew. Avalon made it with his own two
    feet!" [Which "two feet" we mean is open for speculation! - FP]

    [The rest of the evening in the restaurant passed uneventfully,
    except for two unfortunate (?) instances; one when Fred was setting
    the table and Dianne asked for a fork, and one when Ford brought out
    the wine and Dianne asked to taste his cork.]

                    --------------------------------------

    The real let-down came when Vagabond took me home, and the time came
    when he took his pants off.  I almost burst out laughing when I saw
    it! No jokes, his organ must have been the size of a half-sucked
    tictac.

    "Who do you expect to sexually satisfy with THAT?", I asked.

    "Me, meeee!", he whined.

    Well, he'd paid for me in advance, so there wasn't much I could do
    except go ahead with it. I soon found out that he had worse rhythm
    than a broken metronome.  Believe me, his fucking was completely
    knackered. Also, his knackers were completely fucked. I think I've
    seen bigger balls on the heads on pins.

    Part II - Disk Destroyer.

    This guy made Vagabond look macho!
    You know, I often think of penises as salada biscuits; Fred's is
    man-sized, Masky's is snack-size, and poor little DD's is bite-size.
    Did I say penis? Disk Destroyer's was more... more a "punyis".

                           FROM THE MEMOIRS:

      "The day after I had sexually gone through the alphabet for
      the third time, I asked my keeper, Fearless Fred, if he could
      find some knew ways to do it.  For a long time, Fred racked his
      brains. Then he jabbed them with red hot pokers, boiled them in
      oil, and even put them in thumb screws, perhaps to get the
      synapses closer than three centimetres. 

      Then he came up with the answer- he asked his friends and
      made a lot of diagrams and notes. Here are a few of my
      favourites..." - DN

               (What Dianne could never write in her memoirs.)

           Dianne Nichols died on the 6th September 2074 aged 106.

          She died, it is believed, of an overdose of aphrodisiacs.

    In accordance with Dianne's Last Will and Testicle, she was buried on
    the cemetery planet Kitalpha IV (local name Mortuas).

      |Investigating Officer   INSPECTOR OVTITS, Melbourne Police   |
      |                                                             |

      The body was then removed to the city morgue, where it was
      registered as John Doe #216. When the body was to be given a
      standard "unclaimed body disposal" (ie corpse in a cardboard
      box, put in the hold of a Boeing 747 until the aeroplane
      self-cremates, ashes sold to Poms as novelty cricket mementoes)
      it was discovered the body would not fit in even the largest
      grocery box available.  A quick thinking necrophiliac mortuary
      attendant gave the body an enema, and then the body could fit in
      a matchbox. This aroused suspicion, and some checks were done,      and the body was positively identified as Cefiar.

   3: Tombstone marking the resting place of The Bogan. The Bogan
      died in the Earth year 2077 AD, due to sexual exhaustion.

      Because The Bogan spent much of her time on Shuttle Refuel
      Beacon #223, her dates of birth and death are, on her grave
      stone, written in the Beacon's own time-measuring system.

      In this system, The Bogan lived from 59 to 509 Beacon        
      tera-rotations.  Unfortunately, the mason who etched her epitaph
      decided to record the dates in Roman numerals, so the
      inscription now reads:

     In recent months, the sexually related crime rate in the BBS
     community has jumped by 900%. It has been calculated that a lewd offer
     is made to a female user every 7.3  minutes, and she's really getting
     tired of it! (Aren't you Julie?)

                          THIS EDITION'S EPISODE: 

           WHO HAS BEEN PUTTING HOLES IN THELONIUS MONK'S CONDOMS?           =======================================================

    The name's Ovtits, Inspector Ovtits to my clientele. As the
    sharper of you may have gathered from the sign on the door, I'm a
    private detective. Peeping through keyholes and bedroom windows a
    speciality.  One of my more fascinating case began one morning while I
    had my feet propped up on the desk and I was contemplating a cigarette.
    The door opened, and a very agitated Thelonius Monk walked in.

    "Please", he begged, "you've got to help me."

    I eyed him cooly. "And what might you problem be, the main one anyway?"

    "Well", he said, sitting down, "it's like this, I've been having sex
    with these girls, and after the last one, I realised the condom was
    leaking! At first I thought maybe the baby oil had rotted the rubber
    or the friction had torn it, but then I checked the others I had, and
    they where all the same. I haven't had it off with those girls for a
    week now, and I'm getting desperate!"

    "So", I said, checking that I had understood him correctly, "those
    condoms had holes in them, so now there's no condoms in those holes?"

    "Right, that's exactly it. Can you help me find out who sabotaged them?"

    "I can solve any crime I'm paid for", I assured him, "let's start with
    revenge as a motive." I swung around on the swivelling chair and went
    over to the filing cabinet. I shuffled the manilla folders around, and
    pulled out the one I was looking for.

    "This is your file", I informed Mr Monk.

    "I thank heaventh", Monk lisped, "you've found it! And my poor nailth
     are in a terrible meth." He flexed his fingers.

    "Are you queer?", I confronted him.

    "Well", he said, returning his voice to normal, "there's a little gay
    in every guy. What's written about me in there?"

    I opened the file, it was a very short one. (Like Masky's penis) "Not
    much. A brief personal history, photofit picture, hmm, a police
    record... involving a certain incidence last year."

    "That's not fair!", protested Monk, "in the Middle Ages before they had
    latex, the intestines of sheep were always used as condoms."

    "I believe that was after the sheep had actually died", I said
    delicately, "and then been gutted. Could the proprietors of... `the
    Daisy Hills Sheep Farm' be wanting to get back at you?"

    "No, they got all the fines they wanted after the trial."
    "`Bestiality'", Monk said bitterly, "god did that look good on my
    dossier. Still, we're living in the '80s, all sorts of weird things are
    happening. Hairstyles look like hedgehogs, girls are pumping iron, guys    are pumping plastic. What is the world coming to?"

    "Mr Monk", I said, leaning forward over my desk, "May I ask, where did
    you buy the leaky condoms?"

    "Sure, go ahead."

    "Where did you buy the leaky condoms?"

    "I got them from the dispensing machine in the Elizabeth Street
    toilets. I often hang 'round there."

    After my new client, Mr Thelonius Monk, had left, I went straight to
    the GPO and descended the stairs into the male lavatories. It was here
    I questioned the attendant, a Mr Brett McMoron, who apparently was
    always pottering around in the loos somewhere. I found him reading the
    Trading Post...

    "Yes, I know him, the $'&(*$ $ ( %!"

    "I take it then you didn't like Mr Monk?"

    "Too right. You see this black eye? He did that."

    "Oh, what exactly happened?"

    "A little argument. He got pretty mad at me when I told him he
    wasn't to do colonic irrigation in here anymore."

    "Tell me, are you the only one who can open that condom dispenser
    over there?"

    "Yep, well, usually. I broke my key six months ago though. I was going
    to get the master key off the guy who refills the machine but I was
    away the day he came. Medical reasons, you know."

    "I'd heard you were pretty sick. What was your complaint."

    "One of those `Rare African' variety of diseases. Every time I sneezed
    I had an orgasm. I went and saw... I think it was Dr Bowen, and he
    gave me some snuff for it."

    At that moment, Satan's Daughter came skipping down the stairs, and
    four guys suddenly became aware of how cold the metal urinal was.

    "Oh dear", said Satan's Daughter, "I've gone into the wrong loos again.
    Sorry fellas!"

    Satan's Daughter hurried up the stairs, and I wiped the drool from my
    mouth, commenting, "I'd love to see her suspended above my bed in a 
    steel harness. Then I'd roll my tongue around her naval and suck out
    the naval fluff... oh!"

    "I once did that to Fire Fox", said Simple Sparks as he approached, "so
    think up something original. I had her in the 6.9 position once, too."
    "6.9?", I asked, "don't you mean the 69 position?"

    "No, we were interrupted by a period. Hi Brett, I've just come from
    stall number three, and there's no toilet paper!"

    "Oh, god", groaned Brett, "there's none left. Here, take my newspaper
    and use that."

    Sparks looked doubtfully at the proffered paper. "I'd rather use my
    hand. If I wipe with the "Trading Post" I might catch ads."

    I went over to the dark corner where the condom dispenser was and
    examined it. A large sign on it identified the machine as a "Franger
    Mark 80 Condom Dispenser." I knew from my condom machine identifying
    handbook this little baby could hold up to 365 prophylactics- enough to
    make into a car tyre and call it a good year.  Taking out my magnifying
    glass, I examined the lock, and determined it had definitely not been
    tampered with. I also noticed the side of the dispenser was scored with
    a number of what I assumed were tiny cigarette burns.

    Then I noticed a figure lurking in the corner.

    "Who are you?", I confronted the figure, "identify yourself!"

    "Alex Rogan", came the reply, as the figure stepped closer.
                  
    I sniffed. "You been smoking, Rogan?"
                   
    "Why, am I on fire? Ha ha!"
                               
    I didn't laugh. Instead I took out my photofit picture of Monk.
    "You know this man?"

    Alex Rogan took the picture and studied it briefly.  "Yeah, I know
    Thelonius Monk, the bastard."

    "Why do you call him that?"

    "Well, it was a few weeks ago when I met him. He was buying some
    condoms, and I was over there reading a porno... and he comes over,
    and..................

                    ---------------------------------------

    MONK:   What's that you've got?

    ROGAN:  Deviant's Dictionary. Has a definition for just about every
            user on the boards.

    MONK:   Yeah? Give me a look.

    ROGAN:  Hey! That's mine!

    MONK:   "N, N-I ... Nichols, Dianne: noun. Rather like a ray of light             refracting from water to air- deviated away from the normal.

    ROGAN:  Will you just give that dictionary back!?

    MONK:   Hmm, "D-O-R..... Dorter, Satan's....  hey, it doesn't have
            an entry, just a reference. "See under `Star Hawk'", just
            what's that supposed to imply?

    ROGAN:  Are you giving it back or what?

    MONK:   C... Cab, Taxi: laxative, yeah, I can believe that.  Hey,
            what's that ad on the back page?  Hey, the new Latex Lady
            model, I didn't know you could get them in Australia yet.

    ROGAN:  You can't, you have to order them from overseas. I'm going to
            get one sent for a good lay.

    MONK:   One cent? I wouldn't even pay that! From what I've heard you
            bang so often girls get headaches just talking to you.

    ROGAN: Fuck you!

                    ---------------------------------------

    ....and so then he kneed me in the groin and nicked off with my book!
    I'll tell you something, I'll make him sorry."

    "Hmm, that's very interesting, thanks for telling me that", I said,
    thinking.

    I bounded up the stairs, only pausing half-way to turn and announce,
    "Just remember fellas, three shakes and it's a wank."

    Returning to street level, I found myself eyes to nipples with the
    biggest set of milk containers I had ever seen. On close examination,
    one might have said one breast was a little smaller than the other, but
    being an optimist I knew better.  Taking a deep breath, I steadied my
    hands, pushed my eyeballs back in their sockets, and rolled up my
    tongue. Then I asked the young lady a few questions.

    "What's your name?"

    "Julie."

    "Cunt you- err, can't you be a bit more specific?"

    "Julie Alderman."

    "And just whore do y- where do you think you are, Julie? Isn't this a
    slutly- um, slightly suss place for a beautiful piece of crump- for a
    girl like you to be seen loitering?"

    "I have some information for you", she said, ignoring my question,
    "about your Thelonius Monk case. But I can't talk to you here, there
    are too many people about. Meet me tonight at eleven o'clock in the    city square."

    "Hey baby, I'd meat you anytime, anywhere."

                    ---------------------------------------

    That night, I walked at a brisk pace down Collins street, and glanced
    at my watch. The time was 10:53.  I turned left into the city square
    and began a slow circuit of the fountains, looking for Julie.  I
    suddenly heard a moan from near the graffiti board, and wondered if
    Julie had company, but then I found her "company" had just left.  I
    found Julie lying on the cold ground, writhing in a pool of her own
    blood. I'd heard of heavy spotting, but this was ridiculous. Running
    over to her, I found her wounds were bad, but not as serious as I first
    thought. I lifted her head and patted her cheeks, but she was clearly
    unconscious.  Putting thoughts of how much money I could save out of my
    head, I ran to the street and flagged down a yuppie-mobile, and used
    the car phone to call an ambulance.

                    ---------------------------------------

    "I'm afraid it's pretty bad", Dr Craig Bowen told me quietly, "she's
    been bashed and someone's stabbed her in the breasts."

    "Well", I sighed, "no use crying over spilt milk, I've still got to see
    her and find out what she wanted to tell me."

    "Well okay then", said Dr Bowen after a moment's thought, "but not for
    long. She's just been given a sedative, and needs to rest."

    Dr Bowen glanced at his watch, "Sorry, but I can't join you, there's
    been a massive outbreak of VD in the Broken Legs Ward, and I have to
    find out what's going on. I think it must be going round on our
    crutches."

    I opened the door to Julie's private hospital room. She was lying
    limply in a sterile white hospital bed with bandages on most of her
    visible skin. A male nurse was just recording her temperature on a
    chart, and stepped back respectfully as I approached the bed.

    "Hello Julie."

    Julie opened a swollen, blackened eye, and seemed to look at me sadly.
    She spoke in short gasps: "I'm sorry... so sorry..."

    I turned to the nurse, "Did she get those black eyes from her
    `experience'?"

    "Well I don't think she's been trampolining recently!"

    "Julie", I said anxiously, "who did this to you? Was it the person
    who holed Thelonius Monk's condoms?"

    "No...No, it was... 5th Dimension. One of my regulars. I don't mind...
    mind the things he has me do... dressing up like little girls...    but... but sometimes he goes too far.  Never mind... I'll get even...
    there'll be a...  nasty shock when he...  he sees his next Bankcard
    bill."

    "What was it you wanted to tell me?", I asked slowly.

    "Well... it's like this. Monk had just been over... having a good...  a
    good time with me... and I was going out when... I found he'd dropped
    his... his little black book. He'd been two timing me... twenty timing
    me... I was so mad I vowed revenge..  Anyway... I got my purse and the
    book... and I was going to see him. Going down stairs... I passed my
    neighbour's flat... Dr Who's flat... and I noticed the door was... was
    ajar, which...  was strange since I knew...  he was out... since that
    morning. He never pulls the door... shut properly."

    Julie slumped back in her bed, panting from the effort, and her head
    beginning to nod because of the sedative.

    "What happened then Julie", I insisted, "you must tell me."

    "I went inside. I... found the room empty...  But then I saw
    something... which caught my... my... my interest. I put my things down
    and... and wondering... what it could be, I...  went cautiously... over
    to his workbench, cocking my head,...  perhaps... It was some... sort
    of machine. It looked like a science-fiction... weapon. There was a
    piece of... paper stuck to it. I read it... and now Monk's condoms
    all... have holes I think the machine... had... something to do with
    it. I've written down what was... on the paper. It's... in my handbag."

    I quickly grabbed Julie's handbag, and went through it... biros,
    address book, used tissues, tampons, large hat pit... and a piece of
    paper.

    I wondered if this device could have punctured the condoms in the
    machine that Monk patronised.

    "If there anything else, Julie?"

    "No... it was then... then I heard Dr Who coming... up the stairs..
    so I grabbed my purse and hightailed... it out of there... and... and
    on the way out... I noticed a pho...  photograph on the wall... showing
    the Doc... making love with, with... a chair leg... Oh... I'm so...
    tired......."

    "Julie, one last thing. Did you ever actually see Monk again after that
    day? Julie?"

    "No.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

    "I'm sorry sir", said the nurse, "she'll be asleep until late
    tomorrow."

    Disappointed, I went home and slept off the night's drama until late
    afternoon.

                    ---------------------------------------

    Refreshed, I drove into St Kilda and went to interview Dr Who about his
    devices.

    "Yes", he said, "I did build an instrument like that for Rogan, but
    what's it to you? If you damn detectives were doing your jobs
    properly you'd have worked out who broke into my house when I left the
    door unlocked and flogged one like it from the back room! You're so
    bloody slow!"

    "Tell me, has anyone else bought or stolen a device?"

    The Doc shrugged, "No."

    In a flash of intuition, I suddenly realised who had put holes in
    Monk's condoms. I was certain everything everyone had said was true,
    so it could only be one person.  The next day I invited everyone who
    was involved in the case over to my house for drinks. I didn't know
    what to expect when I made my accusation, so I prudently slipped a
    gun into my pocket.  Thelonius Monk was the first to arrive.

    "Have you got any information for me?"

    "Yes, I'll tell you later. Ah, the others are here. Monk, let me
    introduce you to the man of the Lavatory Kingdom, the biggest King I
    know... Brett McMoron."

    Brett stepped in, and I continued.

    "And now the man of the Pornography Empire, the biggest Emperor I    know... Alex Rogan."

    "Hello all", said Rogan, and I continued again.

    "And thirdly, from the great Sex-Starved Country, the biggest Cun-
    well, anyway, Julie Alderman."

    Julie stepped in, and I greeted her. "Glad to see you, Julie."

    "Oh, and I thought you had a gun in your pocket!"

    "Huh? Oh, one last person: Doctor Who."

    The doctor stepped in, and everyone sat down while I handed out vodka
    martinis. Then I explained Monk's problem to those who didn't know
    about it, and, dramatically, made my accusation.

    "The person responsible for this heinous crime is sitting in this
    very room. I refer to n{ne oth{r t{~n th~{{_{~@ {{^{~~{~ {-{'{~"

                     Don't you hate line noise?

                              ------------------

        To start with, I present the alcohol intake schedule.
        This allows you to plan ahead what you should be drinking
        and when. This however, only applies to drinks that YOU buy.
        NEVER refuse a drink from someone else.

        To many, drinking is an institution and comes before all other
        things. [I'd maybe make one exception to that -Ed] Drinking is
        far more important than eating. It has been proven that you can
        live on liquids without food longer than you can live on food
        without liquids. The food could be looked on as an added luxury,
        but more on the food side of things next month.

      The unit could be slab, can, stubby, etc. For example, take
      Fred, for him the number might differ but the unit would be can.
      If you work during the week, be careful not too drink so much as
      to effect your work. This could lead to job loss and hence the loss
      of the means by which to pay for your essentials! Note too, the
      careful build up in alcohol intake as the weekend nears.  This
      prepares the body for the Saturday night/Sunday morning parties.  To
      this end it helps stop you from becoming paralytic. If you find that
      when you wake up on Sunday you don't have a hangover then you didn't
      drink enough the previous night,  i.e.  B-A-D  party!

      If we take the above unit to be a can or stubby then this could
      well be a typical schedule for the average person. If you are a
      yuppie or some other rich bastard then by all means change the unit
      to a larger one, or the imported variety. Feel free to modify the
      above schedule to suit your lifestyle.

      Drinking is a skill that requires many months of preparation so as to
      project the correct image, and condition your body. The first (and 
      probably most essential) skill to master is getting the drink from the
      table to your mouth.

      Some points to remember:
        * Hold the glass in your hand. 
        * Bend your elbow as you raise the glass to your mouth.
        * Open your mouth before pouring the liquid in.

      Once you have mastered the art of getting the drink to your mouth
      you should work on some other worthwhile skills.

              * Drinking two glasses at once.
                Essential if you get to parties late.

        * Spilling your drinks so it looks accidental.
            (Note! Try not to spill liquors or imported drinks.)

          Essential for social drinkers. Three main uses for this skill:

      1. Spilling your drink in the direction of those loud mouth ass
         holes that infest good parties but no-one knows who invited 
         them. Of course diplomacy directly proportional to the size
         of the person your drink is now covering should be demonstrated.

      2. For good looking women that you just don't know how to pick
         up, try dumping a glass of Midori on their lap, and asking if
         they wouldn't mind you licking it up. [Whipped cream? -Ed]

      3. People get used to you being unco-ordinated, and come to 
         expect you to spill your drinks. Can be used to your advantage
         if you ever do accidentally spill one.

      * Slurring words.
        At the start of the party try slurring your words ever so slightly
        when you are talking to people. As the night progresses you can
        forget about intentionally slurring words.

      * What to say when drunk.          "I'm not drunk osifer."
          "I'm not under the affluence of incohol."
          "I not as thunk as you drink I am."
          "I like that odour arm de-underant you're wearing."
          (Before passing out) "I thunk I had a luttle too mush tooo drunk."

      * What not to say when drunk.
          "My shout."
          "Gllllrrrgggghhhhhhh!"

      * Hangover Recovery.
          There are three major ways to cope with hangovers.
      
      1. Sit it out. This method is suited to the body builder types.
         Make everyone think that your aren't hungover at all, and 
         eat a raw egg or three for breakfast. (Don't spew, ruins the
         effect.)

      2. Panadol and a good spew. Not the most elegant method, but lets
         everyone know you were pickled the night before.

      3. Stay drunk. Before you pass out the night before, make sure 
         you have at least half a dozen cans within arm's reach for the
         morning. Before you open your eyes in the morning, drink two
         or three. 

    Next month we explore the art of junk food eating - when, where and
    how much.

                          ====================
                           Anarchistic Sports     /
                          ====================   /__
                           By Lightning Bolt.      /
                                                  /

    This month has seen another exciting month of Anarchistic
    Sports. With the second round of the Victorian Bullshit Spinning
    League being held, I decided to head ringside to cover all the
    action from the night's feature; the Tag Team match between the
    AMF (Rishi Mehra and Turbo) versus Cefiar and Taxi Cab.

    Cefiar and T.C. entered the ring as odds on favorites, with
    their reputation for spinning cronic bullshit, it was expected
    the newcommers to the ring would be quickly outclassed.

    As I cracked open my thrid tinny, I noticed The Lensman in Bay
    13 was just beginning to get into his famous drunken frenzy. The
    AMF team headed into the ring through a hail of empty fosters
    cans.

    Pleasantries aside, each team headed to their respective corners
    and the match began. T.C. was leading off for the veteran's
    team, with Rishi Mehra leading off for the AMF.

    Rishi appeared rather subdued, and T.C. took the oportunity to
    start of with one of his famous lines about his dad's sicopaths
    attacking him.  Rishi's defence was amazing. He just stood there
    and ignored T.C. and began by calmly. "I own an IBM PS2 model
    120 which has a 386 processor running at 80 Mega Hertz! It has
    micro channel architecture, but has a measly 120 Meg hard disk
    but had VGA graphics and a multi-sync monitor."

    I was surprised to see Taxi take this so well, maybe he'd been    sparring with Cefiar, or maybe he just didn't understand a word
    of it. Rishi seemed a little off guard as he went to tag Turbo,
    Taxi hit him with a wopper! "My Amiga has a Netcomm Trailbrazer,
    and I download Gigabytes from the States for FREE!"

    Luckily, Rishi had managed to tag turbo. Turbo entered the ring,
    and headed for Taxi's rear, maybe to cut off his escape, or
    maybe he just liked the view from that angle. Turbo began with a
    cutting comment, "My IBM has a Netcomm M5, and I download Tera
    Bytes from the moon and they pay me to do it!"                

    Taxi was clearly upset with this. He seemed to have been
    momentarily stunned and Turbo began a full offensive; "Your mum
    is a really good fuck!" sent Taxi into the ropes, where he
    managed to tag Ceriar. This was turning into a really good
    match.

    Cefiar entered the ring, as T.C. staggered under the ropes.
    Turbo was about to launch another attack but Cefiar got in
    first. "My computer is a Cray XMP... "

    He was about to continue as the bell sounded marking the the end
    of the first half. An interesting note at this point is that
    team matches are played in 10 minute halves whereas individual
    matches are played in five minute quarters.

    The evening's half time entertainment was supplied by The Masked
    Avenger. I think everyone got a good laugh from his strip tease
    act.  Fifth Dimension entered the stage with his banjo and began
    busking, but decided to leave the stage after the only donations
    he was receiving was the empties from Bay 13. He headed off in
    the direction of the local kindergarden, maybe hoping to score
    better there.

    The teams entered the ring again looking refreshed. Cefiar and
    Rishi Mehra clashed head to head as the bell rang, luckily
    Rishi's jocks didn't come off. Cefiar took the offensive, taking
    up where he left off in the first half. "My computer has 120
    Tetra bytes of hard disk, and I have ten thousand users and 50
    thousand calls a day, and 30 million billion programs available
    for download." Rishi reeled away as the full impact of the
    Cefiar's attack hit him. Only just managing to tag Turbo he fell
    out of the ring.

    Turbo eagerly entered the ring and was immediately hit by Cefiar
    with an brilliant and unexpected attack "I scored 380 for my HSC
    Anderson Score." This was the work of a professional Bullshit
    Spinner.  An excellent change of topic which caught Turbo off
    balance. He quickly followed it up with "... and I was offered a
    Rhodes' Scholarship, except I don't drink beer, so I had to
    refuse."

    Turbo hit the floor, and for the first time thus far the crowd
    began to really get involved in the match. Cefiar added to
    Turbo's agony by saying "I've lost my virginity!" and tagged    Taxi Cab.

    As T.C. enetered the ring, the Bay 13 Boys began cheering.
    Partly because they were really enjoying the match, but mostly
    because the full can of fosters I threw at him impacted squarely
    in his groin. T.C. was down, and Turbo was crawling back to the
    corner where Rishi eagerly accepted the tag. Cefiar looked on
    helplessly, as Rishi entered the ring.

    Rishi didn't waste any time, and began with "I have a million
    zillion disks full of pirated games in my bedroom." Rishi
    quickly continued, and, although inexerperienced, was able to
    effectively get another good attack in with "and I wrote a virus
    for the Amiga in BASIC, and it only took me 5 minutes, and ...
    and ... "

    Rishi made a fatal mistake, getting stuck for words he gave TC
    the chance to make a come back.  T.C. grabbed the oportunity.
    "I called the States last night and talked to a couple of
    hundred of my MATES!"

    Taxi's superior Bullshit Spinning abilities were obvious. Not
    wasting any time he went on. "And then I bought myself a Corvett
    using Alan Bond's gold AMEX card."

    It looked as if that was it. Rishi collapsed. Turbo was leaning
    desperately into the ring, but just couldn't reach Rishi. Taxi
    finished him off with "Disk Destroyer told me how to fuck a
    girl, and she said I was the best she'd ever had!"

    Taxi started about his exploits with twins, two pairs of
    handcuffs and a feather when the umpire interupted the match on
    humanitarian grounds, awarding the match to Taxi and Cefiar.

    Overall it was a hard hitting and exciting clash this month.
    Next month we'll try to cover the girls in the mud wrestling
    match, which could get pretty dirty. Hopefully, I'll also have
    an interview with the Masked Avenger.
