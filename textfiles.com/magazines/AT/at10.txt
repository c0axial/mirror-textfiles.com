     {Knock knock.}

     Fearless Fred sighed, turned down the striptease music on his
     stereo, put down his omnipresent can of Fosters, logged someone off
     his bulletin board, walked over to open the front door slapping
     Dianne Nichols in the face on the way.

     "Oh, ####### #####", said Fred, not hiding his surprise, "It's
     you. I didn't recognise you with your clothes on. Nice trenchcoat
     you're wearing."

     A sly expression sidled it's way onto ####### #####'s face.
     "Say, do you... do you want to see what's under it?"

     "Err, yeah, I suppose... ", began Fearless Fred hesitantly.

     ####### (What the hell, let's just call him Captain Chaos, since
     that's who it is...) Captain Chaos didn't wait a second before
     whipping the trenchcoat open and thrusting his pelvis forward
     slightly.

     Fred went bug-eyed. "My god, look how stiff it is! And it's all
     blue!"

     "Take a good, close look", commanded Captain Chaos.  Fred leaned
     forward and ran his eyes over every inch of it before it began to
     dawn on him what was going on, and he straightened up.

     "Why... ", he said, "you've got... you've got..."

     "Yes", said Captain Chaos triumphantly, "I've got a policeman's
     uniform on, and yes it's mine. I've joined the force, and I'm now
     placing you, Mr Fearless Fred, under arrest to await trial in the
     Federal Court of Perversion, Alcoholism, and Smuttiness!"

                    The Defense-Case of a Dipsomaniac
                   +---------------------------------+
                            By Ford Prefect
 
     Judge, jury, and PI's executioner Craig Bowen fiddled with his
     gavel, feeling rather amused. With Taxi Cab being the prosecutor in
     the first case of the day, he ought to get a good laugh. Even now he
     (TC) was trying to get someone's (anyone's) attention and start
     Fred's trial.

     "You, Mr Fearless Fred of the Twilite Zone BBS stand before
     this court on the charge of conduct unbecoming of a SysOp", began
     Taxi, even though this was what Craig was supposed to state. He
     continued; "How do you plead?"

     "Not guilty!", exploded Fred as he jumped up dramatically to get
     a good look at the courtroom layout, and see if there was any way he
     could slip Craig a twenty.

     "Oh dear, that's plan A up the spout", muttered Taxi.

     "OK then Taxi, present your evidence", said Craig in a bored
     tone as he groped under his chair for a crossword.

     Taxi Cab brought out a video cassette labeled Article `A'.
     "This is a recording of the events that went on at the recent
     house-warming party for the Masked Avenger's new house. I present
     this as my evidence."

     Taxi Dork pushed the cartridge into a nearby VCR player, ejected
     it, removed the cover, inserted it, ejected it, turned it over,
     inserted it, and pressed the play button.

     The TV sitting by the player instantly came to life, showing
     Fearless Fred braving a wild storm and making his way up to Masky's
     porch...

              --------------------------------------------

     Fred rapped on the door and waited, shivering. In a moment he
     heard the sound of the door being unlocked, and as it opened he was
     hit by the sound of loud music, glasses clinking, and a hubbub of the
     latest Taxi Cab jokes.

     "Glad you could make it, Fred", said Thelonius Monk, who had
     answered the door.

     "Have you ever known me to miss a party?", joked Fred, "Say,
     where's Masky, by the way? Shouldn't HE be greeting his guests?"

     "Oh, he's inside... somewhere", said Monk, glancing over his
     shoulder, "anyway, come in, it looks terrible out there."

     "Ah, that's better", said Fred after he had gone inside and
     removed his coat, "there's more wind out there than what comes out of
     Masky's ass! Well, almost..."

     ECH!? appeared from behind a couch, clutching an empty bottle of
     vodka, and muttered in Monk's direction "I thunk I had ar luttle tooo
     mush tooo drunk... " and collapsed. As Monk disappeared behind the
     couch to offer assistance, Fred stepped into the room and looked
     around... Vagabond was alone in the corner drinking his NON-Alcoholic
     cider, guarding someone else's bottle of Midori. As Fred was surveying
     the room he was staggered into by The Lensman who had been indulging
     in one of Masky's home brewed beverages.

     "Hiya, Fred!"

     "Oh, hi Lenny", said Fred.

     "Great party, eh?"

     "Yeah. Do you think I could get a drink."

     "Sure, what are you having?"

     "Ohhhhhhhh, a bottle Southern Comfort for a start."

     "You know, you ought to try some of Masky's home-brew whiskey.
     Really powerful toddy that stuff! It's what Masky has whenever he
     goes on one of his frequent benders, so he calls it Bender Toddy."

     "Sounds great, I'll catch you later OK?" Fred walked off
     searching for the alcohol.

     Fred crossed the room, being greeted by several others, and
     finally found the bar. The racks and shelves along the back contained
     all manner of bottles, casks, and flagons, giving the impression of
     some sort of laboratory or wizard's workshop.

     On the bar itself were many different bowls of sweets, which
     Fred perused for a moment. He finally decided he might take a couple
     of redskins and try the Bender Toddy Lensman told him about.

     Then he saw Syn pouting at him from behind the counter. She winked at
     him, and with her sexy smile, gazed longingly at him with smoldering
     eyes. She moistened her lips and sat down on the edge of the bar.
     With feline grace she stretched out towards him, showing the tan on
     her beautifully rounded shoulders and revealing her gorgeous pair
     of.............shorts.

     Fred's erection was almost crippling him, so he sat down heavily
     on the nearest bar stool.

     "What's your fancy?", Syn asked sweetly.

     Fred raised an eyebrow, then realised she was trying to serve
     him a drink. He opened his mouth, but Syn had left him stunned and
     tongue-tied, and his order of four redskins and some Bender Toddy
     didn't quite come out the right way.

     "Err, I'll have red foreskins and a taste of your tender body
     thanks. No, that's not what I mean, I want.. ah..."

     Fred glanced around hurriedly and spotted a tiny bottle of the
     specially brewed rum Syn made in her own bath tub.

     "I'd love a slurp of your specially rude bum please Syn...  No,
     Syn!..."

     Ten seconds later, Fred was in the men's toilet leaning over a
     gurgling sink whilst painfully holding a wet facewasher to his
     reddened cheek and tentatively plucking his eyelashes out of his own
     eye, mumbling "Rude bum? Oh god no! It's gorgeous!"

     One of the strange features of Masky's new house was that it had
     two sets of toilets; one for each sex, and had several stalls so
     they looked like they had come from a public loo or those found in a
     restaurant. Fred suspected that before Masky bought the house, it was
     occupied exclusively of women, for the Gent's didn't look like it had
     ever been cleaned from the day it was built.

     Along the back wall were three cubicles next to a urinal. The
     sink and chipped mirror were fixed next to the door.

     "Nyuuuuuuuurrrrggghhhneeeeerrrraaaaaggghhh!"

     Fred span around and looked with horror and disgust at the
     occupied, right-hand cubicle from whence the constipated outcry had
     originated.

     "Uhhhhhhohhhhhurrrrrggghh!"

     Fred winced, appalled, as he heard the crunch of teeth on the
     toilet door.

     A blessed silence again descended, but Fred still gave the
     occupied cubicle a wide berth as he headed for the toilet furthest
     away from it.

     Once inside the vacant loo, Fred closed and locked the door,
     pulled down his pants in the quick motion of someone who has found it
     handy to get them off quickly while standing at the side of a
     stranger's bed, and settled himself down on the black plastic ring.

     The toilet cubicle was a dark, moody place, but there was still
     enough light for Fred to survey his surroundings.

     Apart from the grimy toilet itself, there was a small shelf on
     one of the walls, on which was one of those stupid new toilet paper
     dispensers. The type where there isn't enough room for the toilet
     roll to turn around properly, so you end up ripping the first five
     metres out in tiny shreds.

     Also on the shelf, bravely trying to combat odors, was one of
     those plastic Magic Mushrooms. Various real ones grew around it for
     company. Finally, an old vaseline jar held several marking pens,
     their function obvious from the excessive amount of graffiti on the
     door and walls. Fred grabbed a black texta, knowing just what to
     write on the wall outside.

     "An orgasm in the bush is worth two in the hand", Lensman had
     once penciled. [Especially with Royna! - Ed]

     "Photo of Taxi Cab, wipe ass to develop" with an arrow pointing
     to the paper dispenser was Monk's effort.

     On the door, Ech had liquid-papered her contribution: "For a
     refreshing experience, press button whilst seated." (Ech!? What
     was SHE doing in there!?)
 
     Suddenly, the toilet door opened and closed, and for a brief
     moment the chaos of the party could be heard. Masky leaned against
     the door, breathing heavily through his mouth, lurched over to
     shakily grasp the sink, and then staggered into the middle loo and
     fell to his knees. With the forward and downward momentum, Masky
     chundered heavily into the toilet bowl, just getting his technicolour
     yawn in by the width of a bee's foreskin, and marked another notch
     onto the wall.

     "8093", he thought vaguely.

     Having completed his liquid laugh, the Masked Avenger rose rather 
     unsteadily to his feet, as the horrible groaning started again.

     "Nyyyyyyuuuuurrrrrghhhhhaauhh!"

     Masky banged loudly on the door with his hairy palms and said
     loudly "Hey, mate, you having some sort of problem are or you just
     weight-lifting? Haha!"

     Masky weaved his way over to Fred's loo, and shouted through the
     door, "Hey Fred, you're missing a classic party, you know!"

     "Yeah, okay", replied Fred, "I'll be out in a minute. It's
     coming out very easily!"

     Masky was about to reply, when his befuddled brain began to
     think about what it had heard.

     "Err, hey what?"

     "I'm talking about the toilet paper. Usually it jams."

     "Oh, right."

     There was a pause, a gurgling flush, and Fred opened the door.
     On the way out, Fred told Masky about his earlier encounter with Syn.

     "You better watch out for her in future then", said Masky, and
     continued with a laugh,  "just in case your Bloody Mary has a string
     in it. You going to join the party or are you an Ollie?"

     "Yeah, I'll be there in a sec, just have to do something first."
     Fred proceeded to write on the wall next to condom vending machine
     "Insert Baby For Full Refund!", and headed back to the party. 

     Masky laughed and opened the outer door, and found that in the
     last few minutes, the party had rapidly turned into a frenzied orgy.

     Not long after Masky had left the room, Thelonius Monk had
     started making prank phone calls. Fred grabbed the phone, and
     dialed the number of the local McDonalds.

     "Good evening, I'd like to book a table for six please."

     {pause}

     "What do you mean you don't take bookings?"

     {pause}

     "It says here that you are a `family restaurant'..."

     {pause}

     "Can I speak to the manager please, you dumb bitch!"

     {pause}

     "Oh, in that case, can you guarantee I will get a seat?"

     {pause}

     "Well, you can sit on my face if you want!"

     {long pause}

     "The bitch hung up!"

     Monk took over and called up another McDonalds, one of the few
     that have taken it upon themselves to make home deliveries, and
     placed an "order" with Fire Fox, who was moonlighting from her other,
     similar job at Dial a Dinos.

     "I'll have five sleaze-burgers and a large side-order of
     Frenchie-fries, thanks", Monk told her.

     After the crowd who had gathered around the phone had stopped
     laughing, Sprite grabbed the phone and shouted:

     "You can give me a big crack and a dick shake any day!"

     Eliminator leaned over Sprite's shoulder, and said into the
     phone, "Hello? You still there? Hey, something that might interest
     you: Did you know that our host is a daughter-pounder?  Hehehe."

     What they didn't know was that Fire Fox was the local nookie-
     bookie, and in five minutes she had arrived around with nine gorgeous
     prostitutes.

     "Hey wow, what a beautiful block of flaps", exclaimed Fred as he
     entered the lounge and saw them.

     Fred put on a suave, casual nonchalant look, and snapped his
     fingers in the air to get the attention of one of the girls.

     Fortunately, one of the girls loved masochists and was quite
     taken (in) by Fred, for she was a sadist and she knew they would
     enjoy each other's company.

     So, as she bandaged Fred's fingers, they went upstairs to
     Masky's spare bedroom which they were pleased to find empty.

     The extremely willing girl, whose name incidentally was Julie
     Alderman, pulled back the sheets of the bed and sat down. She slowly
     stripped down to her black silk underwear and a puff-sleeved night
     gown. Then she leaned back on the cool pillows, smiled coyly, and
     beckoned to Fred with her tongue.

     Fred, who had been standing at the bottom of the bed quickly got
     undressed, and slipped between the sheets beside her and silently
     kissed her neck.

     Julie moaned and drew closer to him.

     "Oh Fred!", she whispered, "why don't you slip a finger in my
     [DELETED]? Here, let me play with your [DELETED]."

     Fred obliged, and Julie's breathing quickened as the air around
     them began to warm up.

     "Oh yes Fred! You're about to see how Juicy I can get! Oh, but
     your ring keeps hurting me!"

     "That's not my ring", retorted Fred, "that's my fucken'
     wristwatch!"

     Fred's head disappeared under the sheets.

     "My god, it's like the city loop in here! It's like the city
     loop in here!"

     Julie blushed rather heavily (Oh, an interesting piece of trivia
     which seems appropriate to insert here: Did you know that when you
     blush with your clothes on, the blush is confined to your face, but
     when you're naked you blush with your whole body? Some of our more
     adventurous readers may care to confirm or disprove this. Anyway,
     back to Jewels...) [I've noticed that women tend to blush right
     on the end of their tits when they aren't covered - Ed's helper]

     "Well you didn't have to say it twice!"

     "I didn't", protested Fred, re-appearing for a moment.

     "Hey, are these really miniature stalactites?"

     "Yes", said Julie, "they're good conversation pieces. Anyway,
     enough foreplay, I want your body!"

     Fred took one of Julie's feet in his hands, lightly tickling the
     sole with one finger. After a single suck on each toe, [Hang on,
     Masky's the toe sucker around here! - Ed] he rested a hand 
     on each ankle and slowly slid them up her smooth, glistening
     body until he felt, under his cupped hands, her firm, trembling
     spheroids.

     Fred grabbed them and quickly began kneading and squeezing 
     them before reaching under the bed, producing an aerosol can, 
     and squirting exquisitely shaped blobs of whipped cream over them.

     Fred mauled her as he spread the cream around with his tongue
     and licked it off.

     Having finished with her kneecaps, Fred put on a few condoms
     (he still likes to play it safe) and Julie slowly slid...

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     [The rest of this sequence has been excised on the grounds of
     good taste and privacy. We will say nothing more than that the
     passage removed contained a lot of heavy breathing, left Masky with
     a massive cleaning bill, and took between three and three-and-a-half
     hours.]

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     "There you are", said Taxi, "Craig, make your verdict."

     "I protest!" exclaimed Fred.

     "One what grounds?" queried Craig surprised at Fred's outburst.

     "We haven't seen the good bits yet... Julie does wonderful things
     with a Bamix, and the bits where she..."

     "Enough!" Craig cut in, "I shall now give my verdict. Fearless Fred
     I find you Not Guilty! This evidence depicts perfectly normal
     behavior for a SysOp! However, I find you, Mr Gordon T. Cab,
     guilty of being a total dork!"

     |||            up with one day?                               |
     |||            The one everyone hated and thought looked silly|
     |||            I remember leaving a note to Fred about it at  |
     |||            the end of a message to him, something along   |
     |||            the lines of "As for your new macro, not bad   |
     |||            but try again, eh?" And then Fred breaks into  |
     |||            chat and demands to know what's wrong with it! |
     |||            Hehehe (I just BSed about how everyone would   |
     |||            have "culture shock" and he seemed to believe  |
     |||            me.)                                           |

                    QUOTE WHICH SUMS UP HIS LIFESTYLE:

          "What we need is one of those good old piss ups like it
           used to be... where those that drank could get pissed
           among friends, and throw up everywhere, and feel good
           in the morning about it...." - FF (17/05/88 00:29:37am)

                             Times to Pass
                            +-------------+

     NOTE: From any point in time, there are a wide range of
           POTENTIAL futures. Some events are sometimes inevitable
           so they occur in nearly every potential future, while
           others are extremely unlikely and only happen in a few.

           The potential future events described below were
           recorded by using my dimensional inducting scanner and
           are deliberately 50-50 futures. Thus these events have
           an equal chance of becoming reality or simply not
           happening.

           We at Evil Angels decided this was the way best to give
           you a glimpse of Times to Pass, as knowledge of definite
           future events may, in some cases, be psychologically
           damaging - FP.

    The BBS-users' Holiday Plan goes into action.
    This Plan was an idea dreamt up by the BBSs' living God,
    Craig Bowen. After everyone agreed that it was a good idea,
    he fed the names of regular users into his computer, and it
    selected destinations from its atlas database that reminded it
    of each user.
    The Holiday Plan was booked with Pan Galactic Shuttles inc.,
    and for a small cost, everyone participating got a good weeks
    rest from strenuous BBSing.
    Here is the hardcopy of the flight data Craig got when he
    booked the shuttle.

                              Sex Symbols
                             +-----------+

     Once, human beings could be divided into two distinct groups,
     each of which had its own distinct symbol. These groups were...
                         __,
                          /|
                      ___/                 ___
                     /   \                /   \
                     |   |      and       |   |
                     \___/                \___/
                                            |   FEMALE
                     MALE                  -+-
                                            |

     However, we at Evil Angels realise these two symbols are not
     enough to cope with the greatly differing people of the BBS
     world, so we have come up with a new set of symbols which
     succeed in describing people where the two above fail...
           __.

                       The Dianne Nichols Affair
                      +-------------------------+

     Anyone who regularly visits Fearless Fred's Twilite Zone
     would have had considerable difficulty ignoring the resident
     nifty nympho, Dianne Nichols.

     After hearing so much about her various sexual orgies with
     Rory the Elephant, Eric the Desk Lamp, Gordon the Rhino,
     Walter the Camel, Mick the Photocopier, Frank the Vacuum
     Cleaner, et al, people began to wonder just who she was, so
     she finally made her public debut at the Final PI Meet.

     Of course, those who didn't turn up didn't realise she was
     a blow-up doll ("...it is a fact that Dianne has a rather
     plasticy epidermis..." - FF), which led to some confusion...

     "... and I am also rather upset with Fred that because he had
      a full car that I spent the trip into the city in the boot!"

     Fred NEVER ceases to amaze me?"

       "Actually Dianne deserved to travel in the boot after the way
        she behaved in the theatre. But Fred managed to keep her
        under control with a slap here and there! Really, don't
        worry too much about her, if you had come to the meet you
        would know why!!"

     ---------------------------------------------------------------

          "... she went into the theatre in my bag and was
           blown up in the theatre and emerged in her full glory
           at the end of the movie to the usher's ... horror." - FF

     Not long after this, Fred (who was leaving messages as Dianne
     Nichols on his BBS, made one massive mistake when he replied
     the messages as Fearless Fred, but signed off as Dianne!

         Subject: Re: Well Guess what...

         Well matey, I may just happen to ask Fred who you are, and
         get him to fix you up.

         As for my dressing gown, it was actually Fred's. He lent it
         to me for the day.

         Love,
              Di.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------

        This all led to Fred receiving messages like this one...

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
     TO: Fearless Fred
     FROM: Sprite
     SUBJECT: Re: Arrgrghrghgh

     hehehe... I heard about that!    A blow up doll... So you
     did write those messages... I really think The Australian would
     be interested, after their little BBS bash week.

        An anonymous caller rang through with the message
        that a certain well known figure in the BBS community
        known as Fearless Fred, has for the last couple of years
        been masquerading as a very promiscuous and highly
        suspect female.  The SysOp, known in certain circles
        to be a confirmed alcoholic, is known to have left at
        least 50 messages on a Bulletin Board he runs, offering
        sexual advice and tips to other BBS users. At one stage
        he claimed to have had sexual intercourse with Mr Gordon
        T. Cab, later realising that such a claim was perhaps
        stretching his credibility, and admitting that the `Gordy'
        in question was in fact a Hippopotamus stolen from the
        Melbourne Zoo. Having buggered the animal, Mr Fred then
        seduced several male members of his board.

        When we rang to confirm the story, Mr Fred said
        "Piss off, I have a headache!  Bruce... (click)" and put the
        telephone down. Police are looking into the matter.'
