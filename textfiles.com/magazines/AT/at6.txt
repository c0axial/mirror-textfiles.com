     --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
                               WARNING! 

	Before attempting this course you MUST be in peak physical and
	spiritual condition. We recomend that you begin your training 
	at least one month before starting the course.
	
	If you do not have the dedication to training your success as 
	a kamikaze driver will of course be effected.
 
     --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
			You will need:
			--------------

	Determination.
	A sense of destiny.
	A white scarf.
	A pair of goggles. (Optional)
	A bicycle.
	A very expensive (FAST) car. (For advanced kamikazes)
	

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
			---------------------------
			Initial Training: Spiritual
			---------------------------

	It is very important that you are well prepared spiritually
	before attempting to begin the rigorous physical training 
	required to become a kamikaze.

	With every day you will become a more confident man of destiny.
	Your jaw will take on a different shape, your eyes will get
	smaller and take on a glint of iron determination, and as you
	progress through this course you will notice how women's
	heads will turn as you walk past, dogs will run in fear,
	and your mother will stop making you eat your vegetables.

	Exercise 1: You will need to take control of your emotions.
		    This is easily acheived by sitting in front of
		    the television, and taking on a serious facial
		    expression, and then keeping that expression 
		    for as long as you can. Keep your eyes focussed on
		    a point slightly above and several metres behind
		    the television you are watching.

		    The best programs are comedies. YOU MUST NOT LAUGH!
		    Kamikazes have a serious job to do, and your image
		    as a kamikaze will be damaged if you are seen smiling
		    must less laughing!

		    Second best is soap operas. The more boring the better.
		    These will give you the oportunity to pracice your
		    serious job to do look while everyone else is looking
		    bored. Having other people around may be distracting
		    at first, as bored people will become curious as to
		    what your serious job to do look is all about, but
		    ignoring them will not only get rid of them, it will
		    be an achievement in holding your facial expression.

	Exercise 2: Praying.
		    Clasp your hands together, take on your serious job
		    to do look, and begin mumbling. Don't actually say
		    anything, and keep your face as motionless as posible. 
		    If you prefer, keep your eyes open, but don't focus
		    on anything.

		    If you keep your eyes closed, it is much more
		    impressive if you bow and raise the volume of your
		    mumbles proportional to the angle of your bow.
		    Ensure that when you bow you do not fall
		    over! However, should you fall over, take advantage
		    of it, and assume the lotus position, and continue
		    your prayers. 

		    Remember Kamikazes don't make mistakes. If something
		    goes wrong increase the determination in your facial
		    expression, and take advantage of the situation by 
		    making people think that you meant it.


	You should now look and act the part of the Kamikaze. It is
	most important that you do not lose these skills, so make sure
	that you pray at least once per day.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

			Initial Training: Physical
			--------------------------


	You should spend approximately an hour a day training.
	
	For physical training, there are some simple exercises you
	can practice while watching TV, walking to school, while
	having dinner. Just about any time of the day opportunities
	will present themselves.

	1. Walls are one of the most vital resources available to 
	   you at this stage. Partly because, as a rule, walls are
	   quite hard, and secondly because there are so many of them.
	
	Exercise 1: Walk up to the wall. 
		    Look straight at it.
		    Punch it as hard a you can.
		    Try not to yell. This is very important as it
		    teaches you self disipline, needed later.

	Exercise 2: Walk up to the wall.
		    Stand approximately 1 metre back from it.
                    (This step will depend upon how tall you are.)
		    Close your eyes. (Optional)
		    Lean foreward.
		    If you follow the steps involved here, you should
		    find yourself lying on the ground with a headache.
		    If you ache anywhere else, it means that something
		    has gone wrong. Try adjusting the distance between
		    yourself and the wall.

	If you have dificulty in achieving these simple exercises, don't
	despare. You must simply re-condition yourself to your destiny.
	Start with simple exercises like getting a close friend or family
	member to pull away a chair just before you sit on it. This will
	build your confidence. Another good confidence builder is to try
	and juggle knives. Start with one, then work you way up. If you
	can handle three, try sharpening them. For extra confidence, try
	whenever you drop a knife, having a drink of saki. 


	Exercise 3: This is an exercise in showing off your skills as a
		    future Kamikaze. Go into a large office building, 
		    and go into the lifts. Stand in front of the doors,
		    and using the skills you used from exercise 2 you
		    will be able to judge the distance you need to stand
		    away from the door.
		    Now, just as the doors open, lean foreward. This will
		    look very impressive to the people waiting to get into
		    the lift. It is also very important that you don't
		    groan, or otherwise make any noice, otherwise people
		    will think that you're alive still, and feel obligated
		    to help you. You should have learned this skill from 
		    exercise 1.
		    From this exercise you will improve your timing skills
		    needed for future exercises.
   
	These are just basic training exercises. Use your imagination.
	Remember, a Kamikaze wont get very far in his field unless he
	has the resourcefulness to cope with setbacks.
	

	------------------------------------------------------------------

				-----------------
				Advanced Training
				-----------------

	Having cultivated your skills, both spiritually, and physically,
	you are now ready to proceed with the advanced training.
	For this you will need your white scarf, goggles and a bicycle.
	
	Once on your bicycle, head for a busy street intersection. 
	Ensure that the street is not too busy. For best results, the
	scarf should be long enough that it will flap in the wind.

	Wait at the selected corner for an appropriate vehicle. 
	A public bus is ideal, but if there aren't many about, a truck
	is also acceptable.

	While waiting at the corner, you may want to do some praying, and
	deep breathing exercises will be useful later. 

	When the chosen vehicle is in sight, begin peddling. You should
	remember to allow time to get the the place of contact the same
	time as the bus. So begin peddling BEFORE the bus gets there.
	
                        |                ___   |
                        |               | B |  | Start peddling when bus

                        |                       |
                        |                       |


	If you remembered your deep breathing exercises, you will now
	be able to not only attrack the attention of the people in the
	bus and pathways, but also impress them with your your loud 
	scream of "Banzai!".


     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

				----------
				Graduation
				----------

	Once you have been discharged from hospital, you will now be 
	ready for the final stage of your course in being a Kamikaze driver.

	This is the most important stage in your career, and the one
	that you only get one chance at.

	How you do it is up to you, but remember some of the finer points
	in graduation.

	1. Make sure you get plenty of sleep the day before your mission.
	   By not having enough sleep you are prone to make mistakes, which
	   could cause your mission to fail.

	2. Flame looks good. So if you don't have time to douse your car's
	   exterior with petrol just before your final plunge, I suggest
	   that you get a long (approximately 5 metres) piece of red
	   material, and cut V shaped notches into the end. Then just
	   before impact hang it out the window. The fluttering motion
	   will look slightly more impressive than nothing at all.

	3. A microphone attached to a P.A. system is another nice touch.
	   As people wont be able to hear your "Banzai!" over the roar
	   of the engine, the P.A. system will at least be an improvement.
	   Be careful to resist the temptation of muttering last words
	   like "Take this you ass-hole!". A simple "Banzai!" is much 
	   more appropriate.

	4. It is always better to have a reason for your mission.
	   Wait until someone has insulted you, been rude to you,
	   or didn't look with enough respect towards you when you
	   were practicing one of your serious job to do looks.
	   Then make it a point of telling them that they have 
	   insulted your honour and they will reap the consequences
	   of their actions.

	   The less trivial the matter the better.

				 Our H E R O
				-------------

	One of our most promicing, yet unsuccessful students is 
	Raster Blaster. So far his failed missions have included
	a high speed collision with the back of a truck that had
	insulted his honour by backfiring. Result: Written off
	car, and failed mission.

	Next was his high speed collision with a fence.
	We believe that it was not the fence, but the people who
	owned it that had insulted his honour. Result: Written off
	Celica, failed mission. (See what I mean about making
	mistakes when you don't get enough sleep?)

	Next: His attempt with his brand new Integra. So far 
	no-one has been game enough to insult his honour.

	Other people to watch for are Simply Sparks. He has been
	unable to master riding a bicycle, so has taken training
	missions in his car. At the rate he is going he wont have
	a car in which to complete his final mission. One point to
	note here for you younger Kamikazes; car's work better when
	the wheels are on the ground, not the roof. There are 
	certain aspects of training that have been ommited because
	we thought common sence would cover such topics. 

	Masked Avanger. This is our most successful bicycle rider
	yet. At the rate he is going at he wont need a car.
	Truly a Kamikaze bike rider for all of us to be proud of!

			YOUR STAR SIGNS 
			---------------

			 By Ze Prophet



	Aries:  This month there's either a spec on my telescope, or
		there's some sort of planet thingie hovering around
		a constelation wotsit. This means that love is in the
		air for you. But it could also mean that you're going
		to be invited to a bit party and break out in zits 
		the night before.

	Tuarus: This month I couldn't find venus, which means that
		you will experience a stable relationship which will
		have disasterous results. Be careful not to drive
		a Toyota. They have a tendancy to make you jump 
		uncontrollably!

	Gemini: Your planet is murcury. It seems to be higher in the
		thermometre than usual which indicates your love life
		will flourish this month. Just remember to wash you
		hand afterwards.

	Cancer: With mars so much in the news with the Ruskies and all,
		it indicates that you should avoid Austpac as much as
		posible and concentrate on that playboy. Your love life
		isn't going to improve this month either, but with a 
		personality like yours, I'd doubt it ever will.

	Leo:    Being ruled by the sun, and this being summer, it symbolises
		that it's a good time for some huba-ta-huba-ta. If you're
		not getting enough, get a little on the side. If you're not
		getting any, it's high time to start!

	Virgo:  There's an anomoly somewhere either in the milky way 
		or close by it. This means you should cut down on your
		cholesterol, and watch your weigh this month. Also, you
		could be involved in a traffic jam if you drive in peak
		hour traffic. Don't despair, you will soon crash your car
		again, and be back to using public transport and avoiding
		traffic jams.

	Libra:  Trouble is brewing on the horizon. You should start saving
		now for your next phone bill. There is also signs of travel,
		so if you don't think you can afford your bills, book a flight
		to Cuba now and avoid the confrontations.

	Scorpio:Well, you're a little prick, so the best thing to do is
		end it all now while the time is right. 

	Sagittarius: Your life seems to be going fine so far, and the stars
		indicate that you will have someone over for dinner 
		in two weeks or so. As you're basically a walking disaster,
		you'll be better off eating out.

	Capricorn: Now is a good time to change your underwear. Be careful
		not to shower this month as there are bad omens with 
		whats-his-name the water carrier. On the whole, your 
		love life will continue to be disasterous. Socially, you 
		don't have a chance this month either, so stay home.

	Aquarius: You're bound for conflict this month, but don't worry,
		all will end in your favor. Relationships will be strained
		this month, and your sex life will take a dive. Remember,
		there are drugs you can take to cure impotence, but science
		can't cure a small dick.

	Pisces: You should pay more attention towards your business life 
		this month. There seems to be an eclipse of the moon that
		orbits that cute little red whatsit near your planet
		indicating you shouldn't forget the Aeroguard fot the next
		BBQ like you did last time, or your girlfriend isn't as sweet
		and innocent as you first thought, and you should consider
		a trip to the Clinic.

                    ----------------------------------------


                         My predictions for this month:

	Having star gazed for minutes on end, there seems to be some
	unrest in that fuzzy bit of the sky. This means nothing, except
	that bit of the sky wasn't fuzzy last time I looked, so I
	probably need glasses.

	Being summer, the sun is out a lot of the time. So all you Leo's
	out there go have a good time, and the rest of you will suffer.

	If you're looking for a lover, avoid Virgo people. They're what 
	us prophetic people refer to as BAD OMENS. Leo's are in season this
	month, but watch out for jelous Aquarius boyfriends.

	I also saw a satelite. This means that it's a good time to buy
	that expensive thing you wanted, and give it to someone who wont
	use it as a Christmas present.  

	Till next time huneys....   XXXOOOXXX
