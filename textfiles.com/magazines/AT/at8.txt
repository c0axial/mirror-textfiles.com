                    ==================================
                     Who is this Santa Person Anyway?
                    ==================================

      After receiving anonymous reports from several elves, I decided
      to investigate just who this Santa person really is. What I
      discovered will shock you. He is not the kind, fat old man with
      the white beard that you have been led to believe, but, I suspect,
      a cover for an international organized crime syndicate.

      Upon landing at the North Pole I headed straight for Santa's
      workshop. The workshop appears from the outside to be a quaint
      olde worlde home but after I made my way inside I discovered
      something different.

      The workshop is divided into three distinctly separate partitions.
      The first is the workshop which is open to the public for a nominal 
      entrance fee, and has guided tours every hour on the hour. This is 
      where the elves happily go about their business of making toys for
      the world's good little boys and girls.

      Not accessible to the public is the real workshop. This is where
      several hundred elves have been housed for many months of forced 
      labor. I must admit that I was deeply moved to see elves, in worse
      physical appearance than a man after a night with Royna, being 
      whipped to the point of unconsciousness, and being revived so 
      they could work another hour. It brought tears to my eyes as the
      memories of SYN flooded back...

      The third partition was the most disgusting sight I have ever seen.
      A large spa in the middle of a large tropical garden. Served by 
      naked women with the food and drink he had collected last Christmas
      and kept in cold storage since, was Santa, surrounded by a mass orgy.

      I thought it best if I waited here, and made myself inconspicuous by 
      joining in the orgy. So I cautiously removed my clothes, press badge,
      camera, drank my bottle of Southern Comfort, put a couple of condoms
      on (Kiddies, remember that it's better to be safe!) and headed for
      the first pair of open legs.

      To my great surprise I recognised those knees, and wondered what Fran
      was doing here. I thought I had better move on, but the orgy was
      already breaking up; Santa was preparing for his Christmas delivery.

      With a mind as brilliant as mine, I sometimes wonder if the reason
      I failed pre-school wasn't because of jealousy on the part of the
      teacher. I saw this as my way out of here. So I quickly gift wrapped
      myself and headed for Santa's Sack.

      What I discovered in the sack is not something I will publicise, but
      in Santa's sack, apart from the expected dolls, toy cars, machine
      guns and armageddon bombs for the kids, there was also several 
      large packages of amphetamines, hallucinogenic pills, and non-tobacco
      type cigarettes.

      What I then discovered was not pure bliss as you may have expected,
      but if you can imagine what it is like to be dropped down a chimney,
      have an obese, over sexed, smelly old pervert fall on top of you, 
      you'll be able to sympathise with me (and you're also a fucking
      deviant tart! Hi Blue Fox!). 

      Once I returned to the office, I requested a response from Santa's
      public relations officers, and press agents. Fran convinced me that
      Santa is innocent of all accusations printed here, and provided
      documented proof (an invite to the next orgy).

      I am still not totally convinced that Santa is totally innocent,
      after seeing the way he laughs when little girls sit on his lap in
      shopping centers world wide, I can't help but doubt the reports of
      his pedophile activities.

     NARRATOR   Welcome to the story of the Birth of Christ, the
                TRUE story. The story most of you have heard is
                probably only the editted, "public release" version.

                One of the strange things about this story is that
                by a bizzarely improbable co-incidence, many of its 
                characters are distant (but strikingly similar sometimes)
                ancestors of present-day BBS users. At great expense 
                we have managed to collect together most of the 
                direct decendents of the original people involved.
                God, however, was unavailable, so Craig Bowen
                accepted our offer to play the part.
 
                The story begins in an inn room somewhere on the
                outskirts of Nazareth. Inside the room is a virgin
                by the name of Mary, who is married to a man named 
                Joseph, and coming up the stairs outside is the foul
                Chariot Cab.

     ARCH EVIL  (NORMAL VOICE) Nah, just a few wars and other
     ANGEL      melodramas. Oh, there's a good comedy on the
                Catholic prayer channel.

                I must admit to it. I've been guilty of trigamy. I'm
                married to three sexual gluttons, and besides that I've
                had five prostitutes on the side. Also, there's a
                fourteen year old girl locked up in the holiday house,
                and there's this really gorgeous girl who's got 
                blonde hair, BIG tits, and... (CONTINUES AD LIB)

                fathers something to DREAM about at night!

     A.E.A.     I like the look of the girl, though.

     GOD        You know what I'd like to do with her right now?

     A.E.A.     No, what?

     F/X        GOD WHISPERING. FADE.

     F/X        FADE UP: MARY SHRIEKING

     F/X        DOOR OPENING

     JOSEPH     What's going on here!?

     F/X        CHARIOT JUMPS UP, MARY STOPS SCREAMING

     MARY       (WOEFULLY) This homosexual, who's so ugly he has to
                prey on girls, has been molesting me.

     JOSEPH     I'll soon fix him!

     F/X        BLOW-GUN

     CHARIOT    Ow! What was that!?

     JOSEPH     Something just like you... a little prick with
                a super-concentrated gonorrhoea virus. You'll be
                rolling on the floor in a paroxysm of purulent
                discharge within minutes.

     CHARIOT    Maybe it would have affected a NORMAL person, but
                giving me gonnorhoea would be like tipping a
                millionaire.

     JOSEPH     Well I know something that WILL hurt you, Chariot Crap.

     F/X        A HANDFUL OF SALT GRAINS BEING THROWN OVER CHARIOT
                (What sound a handful of salt makes I don't know,
                 but you'll think of something!) 

     CHARIOT    Agggghh! (GURGLES) Salt! Don't you know slu- people
                like me will- Arggggggghhh!

     F/X        CHARIOT SHRIVELS UP AND DIES.

     JOSEPH     That's that done, but this will mean a divorce, you
                know.

     F/X        WITH A BANG OR A BLAZE OF LIGHT OR SOMETHING, AN
                EVIL ANGEL APPEARS.

     EVIL       Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary
     ANGEL      home as your wife, because what is conceived in her
                is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a
                son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because
                he will save his people from their sins, and I happen
                to like the name Jesus.

     JOSEPH     No, no, no, you've got it all wrong. It wasn't
                Goddie who raped her, it was Gordie.
 
     EVIL       Allow me to explain. God was just using Chariot's
     ANGEL      body to make your virgin wife pregnant. Chariot
                couldn't have done it, for he has, as you can see,
                no testicles.
 
     JOSEPH     Oh, I see.
                (SUDDENLY SEES A FLAW IN THE EXPLANATION) But how
                 can she still be a virgin then!?
 
     EVIL       (TO JO) Jo, look at that dick! With a dick THAT small
     ANGEL      it is imposible for any woman to lose her virginity!

     MARY       (BRIGHTLY) Why, he's right!

                (FADE)

     NARRATOR   So ends the beginning of the story, revealing how
                the virgin Mary got God's baby and still remained
                a virgin. Nine months later...
 
     F/X        SOUND OF DONKY'S HOOVES

     MARY       Oh! oh! Joseph the contractions are coming even
                quicker now!

     JOSEPH     Relax, we're here.
 
     F/X        HOTEL DESK BELL.

     INNKEEPER  (Hic) Yes?
 
     JOSEPH     We'd like a room for the night.
 
     INNKEEPER  Hmmm, is she (LOOKS AT MARY) married? VERY nice
                knees. (TAKES A DRINK)

     F/X        SOUND OF ALCOHOLIC DRINKING HIGHLY INFLAMABLE LIQUID.

     JOSEPH     Yes she is MY wife. Can we please have a room?

     INNKEEPER  Sorry, we have none available.

     JOSEPH     None at all!?
 
     INNKEEPER  There's a convention in town. I could let you sleep
                in the stable if you aren't too fussy, but you'll
                still have to pay full rates.
 
     JOSEPH     OK, we'll take it.

     INKEEPER   WIFE! Show these people to the stable.

     WIFE       Walk this way will you?

     F/X        IF IT'S POSIBLE TO HAVE A SOUND OF A WOMAN WALKING
                WITH A DRUNK MAN KISSING HER KNEES, THEN THIS WOULD 
                BE VERY APPROPRIATE. OTHERWISE FORGET IT.

     NARRATOR   A little while later, this is what is happening
                at a cricket ground near the town, where a group
                of shepherds are camped...
 
     F/X        OUTDOOR ATMOS. FIRE CRACKLING. A FEW SHEEP SOUNDS,
                BUGS, THAT SORT OF THING. 

     SHEPHERD1  You know, I was just thinking. You know this cricket
                ground our sheep are grazing in? It's the very same
                ground that Thelonius Batsman made his first century on.
 
     SHEPHERD2  Oh yeah? I've just been philosophising over life,
                the universe, and opposites.

     SHEPHERD1  Opposites?

     SHEPHERD3  Yeah, like black and white.

                (PAUSE)

     SHEPHERD1  (TRYING NOT TO SOUND STUPID) Oh...? And why are they
                opposites?
 
     SHEPHERD2  Well, when something is black is isn't white, and
                when something is white is isn't black, got it?
 
     SHEPHERD1  Ah, right. Are there other opposites?
 
     SHEPHERD2  Sure.
 
     SHEPHERD3  Like soft and hard.
 
     SHEPHERD4  And light and heavy.
 
     SHEPHERD1  And so what's the difference with them?
 
     SHEPHERD2  Well, you can sleep with a soft light on, but not
                with a heavy- (IS INTERUPTED BY NEXT F/X)
 
     F/X        WITH A BLAZE OF LIGHT, ETC., AN EVIL ANGEL APPEARS.
 
     SHEPHERD2  My god!
 
     EVIL       No, just an evil angel.
     ANGEL      Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of
                a great joy which will come to all the people; for
                to you is born this day in the city of David a
                Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
 
     SHEPHERD1  Huh?
 
     EVIL ANGEL You're to go into Bethlehem and worship a baby.
 
     SHEPHERD2  Oh, OK. We three will go and you can stay to keep an
                eye on the sheep, alright?
 
     SHEPHERD4  Yeah, fine. I'll count them again.
 
     SHEPHERD3  Let's go then.
 
     F/X        (FOLLOWING THE THREE SHEPHERDS) FOOTSTEPS ON A
                GRAVEL PATH. FADE THE FIRE.
 
     SHEPHERD1  (STOPPING SUDDENLY AFTER A WHILE) Hey, look what I
                found! A cricket ball!
  
     SHEPHERD2  (THEY START WALKING AGAIN) Yeah, come on, we don't
                have time to waste.
 
                (PAUSE)
 
     SHEPHERD2  Hey, look at this! Another cricket ball.
 
                (THEY CONTINUE)
 
     SHEPHERD3  Wow, guess what I just found!...
                The dead cricket! 
 
                (FADE)
 
     NARRATOR   We now cross over to the Royal Institution of
                Thought, where three magi are deep in discussion.
 
     GASPAR     It's obvious that there must be something which is
                faster than everything else, and nothing can ever
                get faster than it.
 
     BALTHAZAR  Yeah, like what?
 
     GASPAR     The blink. We do it all the time, and we never
                notice it, it's so fast.
 
     MELCHIOR   I think it's probably some sort of energy source.
                Like a match, when you strike it there's no
                smouldering and gradual glow, the flame is there
                instantly.
 
     BALTHAZAR  I think it's dysentry.
 
     GASPAR     What? Why dysentry?
 
     BALTHAZAR  Well I woke up one night with dysentry, and before I
                could blink or light a match I'd messed the bed.
 
     F/X        EVIL ANGEL APPEARING
 
     MELCHOIR   Oh, an evil angel! Care to join our discussion?
 
     EVIL       No time for that now. Look out the window to the
     ANGEL      east.
 
     BALTHAZAR  Why, what a bright star.
 
     EVIL       You are to follow that star and give gifts to the
     ANGEL      Lord's child, but hurry. We can't keep that star on
                forever.
 
     GASPAR     Why not?
 
     EVIL       It's too expensive! Heaven's been broke ever since
     ANGEL      Ice Man bribed his way in. He was only there for a
                few minutes before he blew all our prophets. Now
                hurry!

                (FADE)

     F/X        FADE UP STABLE ATMOS. THE BABY IS CRYING LOUDLY
 
     SHEPHERD1  So this is Jesus, is it?
 
     MARY       Yep.
 
     SHEPHERD2  And he came from heaven did he?
 
     JOSEPH     That's right.
 
     SHEPHERD3  I can see why they wanted him out.
 
     SHEPHERD1  Still, he does have a fresh faced look about him.

     F/X        BANGING ON DOOR.
 
     JOSEPH     Who can that be?
 
     MARY       Probably the convention members complaining about
                the noise.
 
     F/X        DOOR OPENED
 
     GASPAR     Hello, we are magi, come to pay homage to your baby.
 
     JOSEPH     Oh?
 
     GASPAR     We have brought gifts, of gold...
 
     MELCHIOR   ...frank incest...
 
     BALTHAZAR  ... and Smirnoff.
 
     JOSEPH     Great, hand me the bottle.
 
     JESUS      Waaaaaaaa!

                (END)

                        =====================
                         The Year in Review.
                        =====================

        Half an hour into the new year, The Masked Pedophile got on with
        a 13 year old in MY water bed, with his sister lying on the 
        other side of the bed.

        Craig set up his 2nd BBS, Zen BBS.

        Raster chalked up his 20th woman (Royna), 1st Car (Gemini).

        SYN ... ceases stalking knights.

        Taxi Cab had just arrived on the scene, and became a
        member of the big hacking group; The Elite.

        Monk and ECH!? chalked up their first month together.

        Royna chalked up her first tree-stump.

        Masky got his first girlfriend, Natasha, went away for
        a dirty weekend, and returned. And they split up after
        a month of Tashy being sexually frustrated! 
        (And this is THE Natasha that is known for her football
        team fetish. And she likes MIXED teams too!)

        Raster tried to chalk up his first truck. (Truck 1. Raster 0.)

        Raster chalked up his 2nd Car, (SillyCar), and 21st Woman (Mandy).

        Taxi Cab was not amused at the release of A.T. 4 where it is
        revealed that The Elite are not a Hacking group, but members
        of Evil Angels!

        Fred's water bed is broken (when Monk joins him & ECH!? in it).

        Masky split up with Natasha, and eventually found Bianca.
        Soon to owe me 2 bottles of Southern Comfort!

        Vagabond tried to become a tree-stump, but fails, (Royna fell
        asleep.)

        Fred borrowed $2 from Masky. IT WAS $2!!!!

        Royna chalked up eighth (married) tree-stump a week later.

        Fearless Fred chalked up 21 years of Drunken Slobbery.

        Masky sucked on bottle of Malibu.
        Masky sucked on his first set of toes.
        Masky sucked some more on Malibu.
        Masky sucked on his second set of toes.
        Masky sucked nearly all of Malibu.
        Masky fell over.
        (Gee Masky sux)

        Masky reached the ripe old age of 18, and invited his 300 + 
        friends to his party. The 15 people that turned up to his 
        party went and visited Taxi Cab. 

        Taxi demonstrated his riding skills by riding with no hands.
        Taxi demonstrated his falling skills.
        Taxi made the point that he didn't like us.

        Disk Destroyer finally met a woman.

        Raster chalked up his 1st fence, 3rd car (Honda Shit-Box Integra)
        and 22nd woman (Melissa).

        Disk Destroyer talks for a record 5 1/2 hours.

        Fred gets a new water bed and IS NOT having a party this year!

        On Cup day it became unofficially official that Trotsky and Syn 
        were together. A week later it became officially official, and a 
        month later it became officially unofficial.

        Mega Works has a car Rally. Fred and his car of alcoholics (Fred,
        Lensman, Eliminator and Death Man) came last, consumed over a 
        slab of beer, dent Gem Gem's front bumper, wrapped several cars
        in toilet paper, inflate balloons with exhaust fumes, cover 
        Vagabond's Dad's car in flour, and bullshit a lot.
        But best of all, discover how cool a Garfield looks on the bonnet
        of Gem Gem when travelling at 140 KMPH.

        Monk and ECH!? celebrate 1 year of sharing chocolate.

      Santa: "Ho Ho Ho"

      Lensman: (About Royna's braces)

                             By Ze Prophet

                      My predictionth for nexth year:

        Well, I think that darhling Darriuth will move onto bigger
        and better thingth in the nexth year. The Mathked Avenger
        will be buying Thouthern Comfort for Fred, Rarthter will  
        crash hith car (thatth a thafe bet). Telecom will make another
        record profit with Gordie thubthidithing Authtralia's Amiga
        piratth. Craig Bowen will continue hith exthellent thythopping
        and Fred will continue his exthellent drunken thythopping.
        Monk & ECH!? will continue sharing their chocolate barth,
        and Lenthman will reach Marth by developing a thronger 
        rocket fuel. There'th a LOT faggotth running around out there
        tho I think that my love live may altho pick up.

        Till next year huneeth....   XXXXOOOOXXXX
