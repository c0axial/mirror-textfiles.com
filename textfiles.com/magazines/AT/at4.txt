            Name:  Gordon (last name withheld)
 
           Alias:  Taxi Cab
                   Qix
 
        Computer:  Amiga 1000
             
           Modem:  Netcom 1234sa
                
            I.Q.:  0.00
                   (Rounded off to 2 decimal places)
                       
             AGE:  16
             
     Social Life:  None detected as yet.
 
       Home Life:  Lives with Yuppy Parents in a Yuppy
                   suburb. Has been given his own phone line.
                   Must have had a very traumatic childhood!
                   We suspect that he used to kill ants, grubs,
                   and other such creatures that proposed no risk
                   to him before he had his computer bought for him.
                    
General Comments:  My first experience of the subject was on Zen BBS
                   I had just logged on and was receiving the main menu
                   (about 15 seconds after loggin on) when I received a
                   request from the subject to "go conference". Not being 
                   rude, I went into the conferencing setion and greeted him. 
                   The first thing the subject ever said to me was;
                   
                   "Wot computa u use?????"
                   
                   I was suspicious from the first. The Nerd Detection LED's
                   flashed on in my brain. I wasn't wrong...
 
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
     -----------------------------------
     List of macros used by the subject.
     -----------------------------------
 
     
     PF1:  /WHO
     
           What this does is allow him to effectively monitor the users on
           a TBBS system. By pressing the PF1 key he gets the list of the
           others users.
           
     PF2:  /Send,1 Go conference!!!!!!!!!!
     
           What this does, is once someone else logs onto the system, he 
           can send them the request to go into the conference mode with him.
           
     PF3:  Wot computa u got??????
     
           This is the traditional nerd greeting. An acceptable nerdy responce:
           "Orsum Amiga 1K!!!!!!!!!!! wot u got man??????????"
           (Note the use of multiple punctuation marks - never been properly
            explained why this is so, nor the phonetic spelling of words.
            Several psycologists are working on this at the moment, and when
            their thesis are published we hope to understand the nerd mentality
            to such a degree that we will be able to detect and remove such
            threats before they begin fester like Taxi Cab has.)
            
     PF4:  Got any NUI's, cards or outdials??????
     
           This is the subject's way of saying;
           "I'm C00L, I'm a hacker."
     
           What it means is;
           "I'm a nerd, I can't hack, I've got no friends, please be
            nice to me and tell me something that I can blab to make 
            people think I know things that I don't have a clue about."
 
     PF5:  I'll talk to you some other time then.....    Bye Dude.
     
           This is the next key in sequence. After he has used the other keys,
           the other person in chat with him realise what a nerd the guy
           is, and leave.

           A day in the life of Taxi Cab.
           ------------------------------
           
           10:00  Wake up. 
    
           10:05  Switch on computer. While booting, go to the kitchen and
                  ask mother to make breakfast for him. Return to computer.
           
   10:07 - 14:00  Log onto Zen BBS, Pacific Island, Twilite Zone, Greyhawk
                  or any other BBS that the sysop has not yet thrown him off.
         
           14:00  Ask mother to make lunch for him.
           
   14:02 - 18:00  Log onto Zen BBS, Pacific Island, Twilite Zone, Greyhawk
                  or any other BBS that the sysop has not yet thrown him off.
         
           18:00  Has to have dinner with mother, father and any other 
                  relatives that might be there. Has to hurry, as the computer
                  is still switched on. 
                  
   18:25 - 23:00  Log onto Zen BBS, Pacific Island, Twilite Zone, Greyhawk
                  or any other BBS that the sysop has not yet thrown him off.
         
           23:00  Just for a change, today he'll have a shower this week.
                  Maybe he'll have a bath next week. He would hate his
                  bath toys to get lonely.
           
   23:15 - 02:00  Log onto Zen BBS, Pacific Island, Twilite Zone, Greyhawk
                  or any other BBS that the sysop has not yet thrown him off.
         
           02:00  Kiss his panda bear goodnight, go to sleep.

                     --------------------
                     General Information:
                     --------------------
 
 
        We set up a hacking area... The Elite... to please Taxi
        Cab, as he was sure that there was a hacking area on the
        Twilite Zone.
        
        In this area were such hackers as Lightening Bolt (myself),
        Fearless Fred, Thelonius Monk, Storm Cloud, Thunder Bird,
        Conan (don't we wish!), and some other names that sounded cool!
 
        In this area, Monk, myself, and Fred created about 70 or so 
        messages which would give any nerd in the real of Taxi Cab
        the impression that we were the most efficient, organised and
        successful hacking group Australia have ever seen, with details
        of our achievements kept to a minimum... but including Austpac,
        BHP, Elders, Westpac, the list goes on.....
 
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                Here's an example of of the area.
 
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        TO: Thunder Bird
        FROM: The Assasin
        SUBJECT: Re: Melb. Uni Outdial.
 
        Yeah buddy, I've been working on the CAE Vax, damn
        it's a fuckwit, you know the usual backdoor we use,
        well the motherfuckers have plugged it. I don't think
        they're onto us yet though. I'll get onto it again tonight
        and just get the password file and work on it. 
 
        want the Monash Admin details please. Got an enemy I'd like
        to fail last year! 
        
        latest on that NUI, it is now dead, don't try to use it, they
        do an immediate trace. I think I might give it to some nappy
        and let Telescum get up his ass! 
 
        Mike.
 
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        TO: Masked Avenger                                 (Private)
        FROM: Fearless Fred
        SUBJECT: What are you doing in this area?
 
        You aren't a hacker! Piss off!
 
        As for you Monk, pretty damn rude reading other's mail!
 
        Piss OFF!
 
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        TO: All
        FROM: Thunder Bird
        SUBJECT: You been up all night too huh?
 
        Shit I am fucked guys! I've been downloading from the
        US for the past 4 - 5 hours, in between chatting to 
        some cool US sysops. I've got this utility for decompiling a
        UNIX password file, similar to the one we've got for the VAX.
        I'll upload it now. This is one not to let out!
        It's fucking good, and with docs on the latest UNIX revision
        fuckups!
 
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        TO: Fearless Fred                                  (Private)
        FROM: Fearless Fred
        SUBJECT: Re: Should we give him access?
 
        Monk, that's naughty, reading the sysop's
        private mail to himself!
 
        Think I should give him access to the Elite?
        
        Na... I've met the twerp, and apart from almost dying
        of laughter, I CAN'T STAND IT! (Him sorry)
 
        It's about time you opened another stubbie Fred!
        
        Ahhh... Foster's Lager!
 
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        TO: Fred
        FROM: CONAN
        SUBJECT: EGO?
 
        SCREW YOURSELF! I HAVE SKILL BABY, AND WANT THE MOTHER FUCKERS TO KNOW
        ABOUT IT. IF THE BASTARDS ARE AS DUMB AS THAT, THEY DESERVE TO GET
        WHAT I FUCKING GIVE THEM! 
        BUT I WONT SCREW UP. I HAVE A PERSONAL INTEREST IN ELDERS THAT I WILL
        MAKE SURE THAT THIS ACCOUNT REMAINS FOR A WHILE SO THAT I CAN GET INTO
        THEIR IMS CONTROL FILES. THEY ARE STILL RUNNING VERSION 19.3 OF IMS,
        THAT IS ASKING FOR HACKERS! THEY WONT UPGRADE, SO ONCE I'VE SECURED
        SOME OTHER ACCOUNTS THAT THEY WONT DETECT, I AM GOING TO SCARE THEM
        SOMETHING SHOCKING! THEY WILL BEG ME TO STOP!
 
        TILL NEXT TIME, KISS MY ASS!
 
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     
           Anyone with 1/2 a brain could tell this stuff is UTTER

        After granting the little nerd access, we have been plaugued
        by him ever since. So... after dropping his access, and 
        telling him to go away, we thought that that would be the
        end of him. But... the twerp wouldn't go.
 
        So... hence the release of A.T. 4.   Please, Taxi Cab, take this
        as a bulletin from the uses of Melbourne's (and where ever else
        you have called) bulletin boards and GO AWAY!
