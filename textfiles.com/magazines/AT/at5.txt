     --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
                               WARNING! 
 
     You may find the following document boring, for this we (the 
     authors) do apologise, but feel that the facts must be made 
     public to protect the innocent, and expose the guilty. 
 
     --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
     Name: Vagabond. (Boringus Maximus) 
      
     Born: (We suspect not.) August 1969.  
           
     Description: A reasonably tall dark haired creature. 
          Has many distinguishing features, such as his 
          square eyeballs to make viewing a monitor easier, 
          and his well developed fingers that make a 50% 
          speed increase in typing.  
 
     Habitat: The Vagabond can usually be found (with one exception) 
          in front of a computer. During the day you will find the 
          Vagabond "working" in front of a computer, during the 
          evenings you will most commonly find it at home in front     
          of a computer. The one exception is Friday evenings. 
          This is the time of week that a metamorphosis occurs, and 
          it throws off it's boring casing and leaves the protection 
          of it's elders, and goes to watch a movie (the same each week).
 
     Eating Habits: The Vagabond is a scavenger most of the time. 
          It feeds mostly on chips that is steals off work mates. 
          Before it attacks, it can be detected by the characteristic 
          "Chippie Chippie Chippie!" sounds. Also feeds on Mars Bars, 
          and whatever the mother will make him eat. 
 
     Reproduction: Frequent encounters with Mrs Palmer and her 5 daughters. 
          As yet there has been no other documented activity, with 
          one exception to this. The mating ritual of the Vagabond begins 
          with spending several hours talking in his car, if the subject 
          falls asleep, things progress. However, it has been known to fail. 
          (On the one and only occasion!) 
 
     Movement: Without a vehicle to move, the Vagabond tends to be 
          clumsy. It has been described by a famous biologist as: 
          "If he was walking through the MCG, and there was a packet of 
           matches in the middle of the oval, he'd trip over the matches." 
 
            With the aid of a vehicle, the Vagabond is BORING. He  
          travels extensively in a Datsun Stanza. Now, if that isn't  
          boring enough, (the car CAN'T go faster than 120 KM/H)  
          he adheres strictly to the speed limits, with statements  
          about how he can accelerate and remain at a constant speed  
          (providing quadronomial vector equations to prove his point) 
          and turns a corner at 5 KM/H to demonstrate. 
 
     Fantasies: It is amazing, but the Vagabond does have fantasies. 
          A well known one is that he is locked in a computer shop 
          over night. Others such as having people laugh at one of his 
          jokes may never be realised, but he is trying...  
 
     Phobias: The Vagabond is well known for it's fear of excitement. It has 
          been traced back to his early childhood, where exciting events 
          occurred, and his subconscious has never come to terms with  
          those events. Thus, a good time to the Vagabond consists of 
          watching test patterns on channel 2, reading a movie on SBS, 
          or even better checking that his 101 key keyboard still has 
          it's 101 keys! 
 
     Dress: The Vagabond is renowned for his poor taste in clothes. His 
          selections (from the Brotherhood bins) is always at least 
          one size too large, and his shirts are always untucked. 
 
     Achievements: The Vagabond has achieved a new dimension in boringness. 
          He has made a brick wall commit suicide when he tried to 
          convince it to vote Liberal in the last elections. (The wall 
          was a Liberal supporter anyway, until Vagabond talked to it.) 
 
                His proudest achievement is counting 93,000 sheep one  
          night, until sheep fell asleep. Ge then wrote a long boring 
          story about it. 
 
     History: The Vagabond became known in late 1986. With his VIC-20 
          and 300 baud modem he managed to bore a lot of people without 
          actually being there to bore them. 
 
            With his new computer, the IBM compatible, new 1200 baud  
          modem, and own phone line, he has been able to bore a lot 
          more people quicker. 
 
             It wasn't until 1988 that he got a job and started working 
          in the ideal environment; the PC division of a large national 
          company. He can now bore an enormous amount of people, quickly 
          and efficiently and gets paid for it! 
 
     Closing Comments: If you are someone who showers more than once per 
          week, goes out at least as often as you shower, and don't 
          get past counting 10 sheep before you go to bed at night, or 
          get pubic hair (not your own) caught between your teeth every 
          now and then, then this is one person you should avoid. 
          You'll find him boring!
