		       Chronicles : Chapter ]I[
		       \=--------------------=/
	
	Here is Chronicles chapter 3.  After a long break, I
guess you could say, I got off my lazy ass and wrote this.  Its
not as big as the other chapters, especially not the last one,
but, what do I get for only working about the equvalent of two
hours on it.  Anyway, I already have chapter 4 in the works and
vYrus should have it in his hands by the time this one is released
into TYME.  Well, the chapter begins where the last one left off.
	Elyssa and Gabriel our on thier way into Boston and
they get a little sidetracked by an old aquaintance of hers.

			 Chronicles
		     Chapter III: Night

     She takes me to Boston, the night is rich and full of
wonderful sound.  People bustling through the downtown streets,
carriages jostling along.  Elyssa is radiantly beautiful, the
blonde hair, almost silken, angel-like she seems.  The driver
commands the horses to a slow trot, he dressed in all black like
she and I.  If there ever was a heaven, I am in it now.  

     "What's wrong?" She asks of me.

     "What?" I reply, not paying attention, "Oh, nothing, nothing
at all."

     "Does the beauty overwhelm you?" She smiles.

     "Yes," I say, "All of this never looked quite as it did when
I was mortal."

     "Your saying its bland?" She says.

     "Oh, no!" I exclaimed, "Of course not.  Everything seems so
alive, its like I'm in a dream, everything is more beautiful than
I could ever imagine!  The sights and sounds are so much more
vivid!  Even the clopping of the horses is astonishing!"

     She laughs.  "I know what your feeling." She says, "Its the
same with every immortal.  Your senses were heightened ten times
more than when you were mortal.  Everything takes on a new look
and feel.  Sex would probablly be much more satisfying if
vampires could do such."

     "What do you mean, if vampires could do such?" I asked.

     "Well, females can have it, but, men cannot." She says.

     "And why is that?" I asked.

     "Well, the men can't get an erection.  Not enough blood." 
She says, smiling.

     "How nice." I say sarcastically, "Let's move on to another
subject, shall we?"

     She laughs again, amused at my disenchantment.  We turn a
corner, the carriage feels strange as it veers to turn.  

     "Where are we headed?" I ask.

     "We are going to the theatre." She says, "Hamlet."

     "I've never seen that!" I say excited, "I've really wanted
to!  Whats it like?"

     "Perhaps you should see it for yourself." She tells me, "I
wouldn't want to spoil it for you."

     I hear the horses start to slow, we abrubtly halt in front
of a taverne.  I ask her why we are stopping here, she replies by
telling me that we have to feed if we are going to fit in with
the people in the theatre.  I look at my skin and notice that I
am pale white.  She tells me the blood will return my color.  We
pick off two vagrants easily while they stagger drunkenly down
the street.  

     After we are finished the carriage comes around and picks us
up again.  I find it strange how attentive her servants are. 
They seem to know where she is and when she wishes them to do
what it is they do.  We step into the carriage again and trot off
to the theatre.  We arrive early and take our seats.  The noise
in the gigantic room is overwhelming.  I pick out one voice and
cannot hear the rest.  Some people are talking about the show, 
and how some of them have seen it so many times before.  
Some talk of problems at thier homes.  Some just nothing truly  
interesting.  I find it funny how so many peoples concerns and 
fears amount to truly nothing.

     The house lights dim and the actors come out.  They say
thier lines with true eloquence, if they mess up, they hide it
particularly well.  So many jumbles of color move through the
actor's bodies.  Pinks, whites, and reds.  All in one jumble, the
other vivid colors of thier costumes add to the effect.  The hall
seems to echo and reverberate thier every sound and move much
clearly than I have ever heard, when I was mortal.  They finish
with the play, and I am truly ecstatic.  I stand and applaud with
everyone around me.  Elyssa laughs happily and applauds with me. 

     We empty out of the theatre and walk down the street.

     "So how did you like it?" She asks me.

     "Oh my god!" I exclaimed. "The sounds and the colors! 
Everything was so vivid and exciting!  It was like I was at
theatre for the very first time!"

     "So you enjoyed it?" She asks smiling.

     "Oh, yes!" I exclaim, "It was better than anything I have
ever heard or seen!"

     She takes up my arm and we walk down the street even
further.  The night surrounds and envelops us, like a viel of
beauty, everything seems to come alive to me now.  Nothing has
ever seemed so beautiful and enchanting as this life is to me
now.  I look over to Elyssa, her face is forlorn and sullen, she
looks as if shes drawn away by something.


     "Elyssa," I say, "what is it?  Whats wrong?"

     "No." She says suddenly. "Not now.  Hurry run this way.  And
hope that he cannot find us!"

     She grabs me and we start running down the street.  We push
through the multitude of mortals, as they gasp and dodge us.  We
break into a clearing, no one around us.  We stop and catch our
breath.  I look up further down the street and see someone
walking toward us.  A man in a long black coat, he has a walking
stick and a top hat.  She turns toward the man, he is a good
twenty meters away.  Elyssa grabs me again and turns to run the
other way.  But he is there, right in front of us blocking our
path.  He steps up to us.

     "Machere`," He says, thick with french accent, "it has
been, so long."

     He smiles at us, and then with amazing quickness hits her
across the head with his cane.  She flies into a wall, knocked
out.  And then he turns to me.

     "Goodnight monsiuer." He says to me with a wicked grin, "Nice
meeting you."

     Before I can react he does the same to me, only hitting me
in the chest.  I am sent soaring over the street with such force,
I crash through the wall behind me.  I get up and shake it off. 
I stagger out into the street.  The man, and Elyssa are gone. 
Frantic I run through the streets, screaming for her.  But to no
avail.

     How beautiful is the night, and whole I feel, once more I am
alone.
