			-- Total Loss of Respect --

  A lot of my writings in the past for TYME have been pretty negative, and not 
more creative like some of the other authors. Well, here comes another one.
I have totally lost all respect for this fucking country. I used to have pride
in it, that we were free, and that we are fair and just in the laws and the
judicial system, but as of now, i think it's all a load of shit. You wonder
why? Sure, the US has the most technology, (that we KNOW of), and is the
wealthiest, but that doesnt mean shit. This country is falling apart. As far
as the law goes for ME now, your not wrong if you don't get caught. Fuck laws.
Some laws are ok, like child abuse and shit, but a lot of it is total bullshit.

  Let me start out by supplying some backup for these statements. About a month
ago, me, vYrus, and Abbadon we out with a 18 year old cruisin' in his car, when
we went by Lyon's, and saw the masses of teenagers 'chillin' (loitering) in the
parking lot. We pulled in, and as soon as we got out, some very HOT chicks
came up to me and vY asking for a smoke. We unfortunatley had none, since we
both have a friend(vY and me smoke regualry, Abb, just weed =]) just gives them
to us when we need them, and the guy doesn't smoke. Pretty cool, but i still
to this day don't quite get WHY he gives us free smokes. Anyway, we were
thinking, "Cool!, there's a shitload of people here, this is gonna be a fun
night!" as we started walking over to the crowd. We saw a bunch of friends, and
some people from school that we know, and were having a lot of fun, on the way
into the door. (We were probably having so much fun because we were all trip-
ping out from each of us taking 2 4xdipped tabs. =]) As we approached the door,
this cop grabs my shoulder and says, "What's your name?!" And I said my name. 
He ended up asking all three of our names out of like 30 kids, and our phone
numbers. I wouldn't give him my phone number because he didn't tell me why
he needed it. Finally i gave it to the bastard. All of us were trying to 
remain calm and find out just what the hell was going on. (We were very 
delerious, tripping 1 foot away from a cops face, and freaking big time.)
He made us get into his car, and i said "What the fuck, why are you being 
such a fucking dick!?" which i probably should not have said. =] At this time
, we STILL had no idea if he was booking us for taking acid, or what. Finally,
after waking my parents up(conveniently vY and Abb's parents weren't answering)
he let us out of the patrol car and told me my dad was enroute. "FOR WHAT, 
WHAT IS GOING ON!?" <- vY. He totally was going nuts, then the asshole tld
us it was breaking curfew. I told him that we weren't loitering, that we were
on our way into a 24 establishment, but he didn't belive it. I asked him why
he didn't talk to the other 25 minors 10 feet away watching us get in the car
, and he said, "Those are minors? Oh, gee, i didnt know. whoops." Fucking
asshole. You bet your ass he knew. Just another fucking stupid bend of the law.
No matter if the law says something, you can't exercise it. If a cop says get
in the car, even though your rights say you don't have to unless he is placing
you under arrest(which he didnt). And curfew is only in effect when you are
standing somewhere after 10pm. As long as you have an organized path to go 
somewhere, they can't(supposedly) doing anything. shyeah right. If a cop
tells you to do something, don't argue with him, because even if he is 
abusing your rights, he can probably kick the shit out of you and, that big
gun on his hip says he's right. None of us got busted. My dad thought it was
a load of shit, he knew i was out, but the cop was an asshole. My dad told
me he was an asshole. Ever since this stupid incident, i have noticed holes
in the law system, and how they arent really enforced the way things should be.
And how the country is a fucking hypocritical pile of shit. Old people vote
for anti-marijuana, while they guzzle down thier Jack Daniels every night.
This country is going to fail because it was all started and founded on 
violence. The people who colonized the US were a group that were rebels and
killed off thier mother land's militia. I don't think democracy is the way to 
go. I don't neccesarily belive in anarchy, because killing and getting away
with it is not right. But i do think something should be done. I used to like
cops, but when i found out just what fucking nimrods they all are and how they
go out of there way to be jerks, i lost all respect for em. I can't kill em,
but I sure as hell will never become one, or help one. thanks.
