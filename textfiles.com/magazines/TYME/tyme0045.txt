                                Gangs

I saw the morning,  it was shattered by a gun
Heard his scream,  saw him fall,  no one cried.
I saw a mother,  she was praying for her son
Bring him back,  let him live,  don't let him die.
Do you ever ask yourself is there a Heaven in the sky?
Can we get it right?
Because we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
Then why,  why can't we live as one?
I saw the evening,  fading shadows one by one
Watched him laugh,  lead him to the sacrifice.
I saw the children,  children of the sun
How they wept,  how they laughed,  how they've died.
Do you ever ask yourself is there a Heaven in the sky?
Why can't we stop the fight?
Because we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
Then why,  why can't we live as one?
Sometimes,  I think i'm going mad
We're losing all we had
And no one seems to care.
But if,  this heartache doesn't change
Wr've got tol rearrange
And bring our world somewhere.
And does it really matter
If there's a Heaven up above?
We sure could use some love.
Because we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
Then why,  why can't we live as one?

        I don't know the name of this song,  nor who wrote it,  but it has a
strong and important message in it.  We passed through the me generation,
through the us generation,  now we're in the I'll kill you generation...  ya,
it's real fun walking down the street wearing your favorite color and getting
killed for it.  ya,  it's a blast.  it's also a blast getting into a fight
and having the otherpersons friends come after you,  even though he started it
by hitting you,  and you were defending yourself.  whatever happened to 
dealing with your own problems?  now it's "mess with me and i'll get my 
friends on your ass".  ya,  fun tymes now...  now it's black and white (no
races meant by that),  right and wrong,  friend and enemy.  now,  if you're 
not a friend you're an enemy.  if you don't agree you're wrong.  it's all 
bullshit too.  there was almost a fight started by a girl i know between about
70 people because another girl stopped being friends with her.  she was about
to get 30 people on her x-friends ass,  so her x-friends brother got 30 to 
protect her and 10 to beat the crap outa the person who started the shit in
the first place.  luckily it ended before it got started.  is this how we 
really wanna live?  in one continuous goddamn war?  in one long fight between
a few groups of people?  
        You wanna know what started all this shit between the red and blue?
A pair of fucking reebok's.  that's it.  a pair of lousy thirty dollar shoes
are what yer killing for,  fighting for,  dying for.  and it happened years 
ago.  the person who started one fo the colors stole the shoes from the guy
who started the other color.  of course,  the second guy get's his friends.
The first guy does the same.  bing bada BAM!  you got yer red and blue.  you
willing to die over a pair of shoes?  a pair of gym shoes...
        Now,  on to warmer tidings.  ah yes...the lovely world of gangs.  
where two people can fight with the greatest of ease.

looks around.  how would you feel if that was you that just got shot?
