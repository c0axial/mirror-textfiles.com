                               Rave Reviews
                               \=--------=/
  
  last weekend i went to san diego to visit my favorite person in the world.
  pinguino. i had a great time with her. and while we were there, we went to
  a rave at the world beat center. this is my story.

    scraping and crunching along the parking lot, pinguino dragged the under-
  side of the car across a curb that she didn't know existed. didn't seem like
  a good start to the night. we arrived at the door, showed up at the wrong
  one, and got in the right line all by 8:30. we stood in line, watching
  people sucking on nitrous-filled balloons and generally freaking out. the
  line behind us grew to over a hundred people, and at 9:30, they began lettin
  us in. we made it through the door at about 9:45, deep into a room chock
  full of blacklights and psychedelic pinups. crazy.
    
    we snapped a couple pictures in the blacklight room, and went outside to
  check out what was going on. a free mixing table was outside, and i dis-
  tinctly remember hearing an excellent remix of "1979" by smashing pumpkins.
  pooling our money, me, saiine, a guy named billy, and a guy named mike all  
  bought a few hits of acid and split them up. i got a half a dose, like all
  the other guys, and i was freaking out nicely. i didn't actually get out on
  the floor and start moving until keoki began spinning. the acid was taking
  it's effect and i was loving it. i thrashed around for a good long time (i
  can't for the life of me remember times, i only checked the time once every
  few hours), and afterward crashed in the "chill room" with ping, billy, mike,
  saiine, and a bunch of other people.

    strangers at raves are the best type of people you will ever meet. they
  are friendly, and will talk to you at the drop of a hat. water was being
  passed freely, cigarettes were bummed, and people just kept on going. it was
  a free trade session, and nobody minded. the most common question i was
  asked by someone i didn't know was "so what are you on?". the drugs most
  often mentioned were acid and extascy. other people were on various others.
  few others were on crank, and pure MDMA. one guy i met was on two lines of
  pure MDMA and several doses of acid at once. his name was max. off in the
  corner, a fucked up couple was snorting crack off a switchblade, and one
  girl next to me for a little while was freaking out because someone had
  laced her x with herion.
  
    after coming back the first time from some hardcore dancing, i popped four
  pills of herbal x. that got me feeling really weird. later on that night,
  someone was kind enough to roll a fat j and pass it around the group. i got
  nicely stoned off that. three drugs were enough for me that night, and i
  just sat there spinning for several hours. pinguino was concerned, but she
  went off for almost an hour and danced her ass off to dj trance's spinning.
  everyone thought she was passed out or dead. but everything was cool, and
  she came back sweaty as hell and running on major adreniline and herbal x.

    dancing to rave music is a rush. being on drugs amplifies it. you can do
  absolutly anything you want and nobody will care. just don't let a circle
  form around you or else you'll have to do some pretty fancy breaking to meet
  to crowd's expectations. i was just going off, and ping was going pretty
  wild herself, and we were loving it. i can't even dance, and i was just
  tearing shit up.
