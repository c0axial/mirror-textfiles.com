                             Sat and Watched

    Staring into the moniter, dead-eyed, he sat and watched.
    
    Sat and watched.

    Sat and watched.

    The reforming colors were dazzling, pinks and purples and red and blues.
  They swirled madly in a rush of sight and little sound. The sounds... Gods,
  the sounds.

    They were calming sounds. Sounds of the ocean waves lapping at the shore.
  The sounds of your significant other breathing in your ear. The sound of
  a purring kitten.

    Chad stared in wonder as these images and sounds formed and reformed.

    Sat and watched.

    Sat and watched.

    This phrase, "sat and watched" was drilling into his brain. He didn't
  know why, but he didn't care. He didn't want to disturb the magnificent
  display on his moniter.

    A loud knock at the door caught his attention, and his computer went
  blank. Disappointed, he yelled "WHAT!" through the thin walls. It was his
  mother telling him to go to bed.

    Chad looked at the clock and sighed. 11:30pm. Damn. He would have to wait
  until tomorrow to see the images again.

    Sat and watched.

    That phrase plagued his dreams. He couldn't figure out why.

    The next day, he got up and went to school. Everything seemed normal.

                         *     *     *     *     *  

    Sat and watched.

    Chad shook his head, as if to shake the offending words from his mind.
  They were really getting on his nerves. During English class, his teacher
  asked him to repeat one of Shakespeare's famous quotes.

    "Sat and watched," he answered, immediatly regretting his words. Thus
  followed a long discussion about paying attention in class, blah dee blah.

    During lunch, his girlfriend and a few more of her friends, plus HIS
  friends all asked if he wanted to go camping this weekend. Giggles. Laughs.

    "Sat and watched," he answered helplessly.

    They all looked at him as if he was crazy. Then they left. Only his girl-
  friend remained.

    "Are you okay?" she asked him, concerned.

    He turned his tired gaze towards her, and she gasped. He was not looking
  well at all. His eyes were a clouded, milky white. She waved her hand
  slowly before his eyes, elicting no response.

    She took him by the hand and started walking him towards the restrooms.
  "Chad? Chad? Are you all right?"

    Against her better judgement, she walked into the men's restroom with him
  to help him splash some water on his face.

    No response.
    
    Well...

    Chad turned to her, his eye now bloodshot and tired-looking. He knelt down,
  fiddled with his shoe for a minute, and straightened back up with a large
  knife in his hand.

    Her eyes grew wide. "C-c-chad.." she tried to say, stumbling over her
  words, "Please don't hurt me."

    He advanced towards her, brandishing the weapon menacingly.

    A few minutes later, the knife unforgotten on the floor, Chad sat down
  on his heels. And watched her die.

    Sat and watched.

    Sat and watched.

    Satisfied, he left the restroom, forgetting the knife, and his girlfriend.
  As if they had never existed.

    Later that day, as he got home from school and was staring intently at
  the incredible imagery on his computer, his mother knocked again.

    "DINNERTIME!" she yelled with her throaty voice.

    Living with his mother and little brother was no easy task. In an
  apartment of all places. He considered it his own personal hell.

    He walked out of the room, flipping the light switch. The colors ceased.

    Roughly ten minutes later, his mother was laying in a pool of her own
  blood, coughing wetly, clutching the fork stuck in her throat.

    And Chad watched her die.

    Sat and watched.

    Sat and watched.

    Chad re-awoke from his mindless stupor. He blinked. He screamed.

    His little brother came pounding into the kitchen, and stopped with a
  short cry of surprise. He had felt Chad's computer beckon him, persue
  him. His eyes narrowed.

    Scant minutes later, Chad was next to his mother on the floor, lying
  next to the toppled refridgerator, every bone in both legs broken, bleeding
  profusely.

    And his little brother sat there.

    And watched him die.

    Sat and watched.

    Sat and watched...
