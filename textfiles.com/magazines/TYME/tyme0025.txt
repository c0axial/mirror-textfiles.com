                             How Do I Love Thee?
                             -------------------

How do I love thee, let me count thy ways.

1. I love you sliced and diced, over the bed, but it really doesn't matter, as
   long as you're dead.

2. I love you burned and rotten, the maggots eating away at your crushed head,
   but it really doesn't matter, as long as you're dead.

3. I love you limp and lame, all twisted and maimed, stabbed with a fury of
   lead, but it really doesn't matter, as long as you're dead.

4. I love you dead from asphyxiation, no hope left for recessitation, but it
   really doesn't matter, as long as you're dead.

5. I love you burned at the stake, drowned in a lake, but it really doesn't
   matter, as long as you're dead.

6. I love you torched and scorched, roasting over an open flame, but who's to
   blame, it really doesn't matter, as long as you're dead.

7. I love you torn and ripped, blood flowing as I sip, but it really doesn't
   matter, as long as you're dead.

8. I love you dismembered in December, gift wrapped and tied to my fender, but
   it really doesn't matter, as long as you're dead.

9. I love you dead from acid, burning and blistering, screaming and festering,
   but it really doesn't matter, as long as you're dead.

10. I love you crying from pain, no life to gain, I love you dying in pain, you
    will pay for you vain, but it really doesn't matter, as long as you're
    dead.

11. I love you tortured and crueled, as I watch and I drool, it really doesn't
    matter, as long as you're dead.

12. I love you with an open chest, organs everywhere, but I don't care, it
    really doesn't matter, as long as your dead.


    I  should have killed you when I had the chance, now I would do it
    without a glance, I hate you alive, but I love you dead.  It doesn't
    matter how you die, I will not cry.  I will giggle as I see you wiggle
    with pain, I will watch you die with no disdain.  Enjoying the sight,
    it makes my day bright.  I will beat you for every lie, knowing that
    you must die.
 
    You've already died in my eyes, with which I have cried.  You will
    remain dead in my memory, and I can still picture you leaving me.
    You've died more than one can.  In my mind, I think of the ways.  I ask
    myself, "Why?  Why did I let her make me cry?"  I won't say I care, I
    would not dare, but it really doesn't matter, as long as you're dead.


    Dedicated to my ex-girlfriend, whose life is all a big lie.

    "Misery"
    by Suicidal Maniac (Adapted from a cDc issue. Sorry guys.)


    I sit here
    Locked in my room
    Confined to myself
 
    I sit here
    Feeling at home
    Feeling lonely
 
    I think of you
    I think of how it was
    I think of how it could have been
    But it isn't
 
    You tell me there's nothing,
    Nothing different.
    But I feel it,
    It's not true.
 
    4 days ago and it was love
    Now it is agony
 
    Misery, it's what I'm used to
    Misery, it's how I'm best
    Misery, it brings my death
