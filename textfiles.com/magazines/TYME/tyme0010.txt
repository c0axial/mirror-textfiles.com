			   BBS Lamerz and Winners

			     Part 1 - Lamerz
			   
   Here is my all time classic list of the biggest fucking lamerz in BBS
history (from my point of view) and a reason as to why they suck so hard.

1) Napalm.  He a dipshit cuz he thinks hes a coolass hacker that can bust
	    any BBS in the area. What a fucking lamer. hehe
2) GreyWolf.  ASSHOLE! Thinks he can kiss FrYgUy (Total Anarchy SysOp)'s ass
	      so he can get SysOp access and lock me out! Not quite, lamer!
3) Hellcat.   Greywolf's arch enemy : himself. hehe... LAAAAAMER!!

4) Viper.     FrYgUy's brother. thinks he can bust into chat and fuck with
	      poeples access cause he feels like it. ha. don't even! LAMER!
5) Phoenix    Not the Phoenix on TA, but the Pheonix on the FX-Net that wont
	      shut his fucking hole about Kurt Cobain. Asshole! ASSHOLE!
6) Skywalker  MAJOR CUNT. another dude who thinks he can get away with any
	      damn statement and live. i killed him. hehehahehaehea!!!!
