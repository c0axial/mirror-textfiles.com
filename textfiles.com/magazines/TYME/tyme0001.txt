				Beginnings

	Well, i spent quite a bit of time (tyme?) reviewing all the F.U.C.K.
texts about them and their opinions on life, and me and a couple friends
figured that it would be cool if we started out own line of texts, instead of
just waiting for the next text from F.U.C.K. or cDc. Their texts are pretty 
cool but they dont review what we like to hear. Like our views on life, on 
drugs, on games, on relationships, on fun, on breaking the law, etc, etc. We 
are a couple of really demented people, and we wanted to try something new. 
So far our little group consists of vYrus (me), Sakima, S0l0mn, Stewart, Teq, 
and Punisher. Here's a little bit of background on all of us:

vYrus - I'm kinda bizzare in my own way. I am currently in a relationship with 
	Teq and it's goin' real well, IMHO. =] My favorite stuff is Pearl Jam, 
	Nirvana, and Teq. And BBSing. Of course. I make regular LD calls 
	anywhere and any time on any phone line, so be sure not to let me near
	your modem. =] I am real good friends with a select crowd, mostly the
	people in T.Y.M.E.

Sakima- He'd pretty cool. And he can throw one helluva party. Speaking of which
	there's one this weekend... hehe... anyways, he calls one board in IL
	on my modem, but i don't care... he is an avid text reader, and just
	recently he has developed an interest in running a BBS so we are plan-
	ning on putting one up very soon. Look for it, uTi.

S0l0mn- Man, this guy is WACKED. But hey, we all are! =] Oh, well. He tried
	setting up his own board, but it wasn't exactly a realistic thing. He's 
	still trying to learn his way around boards, but he's gettin' good.
	He has totally flipped, but i'm worse then him... i think.

Stewart-Well, this guy is into every acpesct of H/P/V/A/C/C/T/etc. you can
	think of. His latest accomplishment was busting into a local Unix,
	but neither of us can make any sense... he's great with carding too...
	him and his PHONE SEX.... hehe...

Punisher-Is a tweak (get used to this word, i like it). We like to bug him
	about masturbation, cause he likes to pretend he's gay. For some damn
	reason... anyway, he's also a fuckin' mack. He has tried to do every
	fuckin' girl in our neighborhood, and some in his own. Crazy. He wants
	to be part of this line because he says he has some 'killer topix' to
	write about... hmm... we'll see.

	T.Y.M.E. itself came from me and Sakima. We were at a little corner
store called Ranch Market, and we were standing there waiting for something
to happen, and i began quoting a passage from a F.U.C.K. text. He thought it
was pretty good, so i suggested we start our own views and ideas in a text
series. He liked the idea and we spent about and hour and a half searching for
a name. Well, and so becomes T.Y.M.E. Look for our files on any text oriented
board, and you will find us. We can also be reached at our soon-to-be-up BBS,
Under The Influence, or at Total Anarchy, 707-257-7208. Or if you need to con-
tact us seriously, call Exodus BBS at 707-935-6867 and leave EMail to either
vYrus, Sakima, Stewart, S0l0mn, or Teq with any questions. But as soon as uTi
goes up, please call there for any probs with what we write. We'll prolly
tell you to fuck off if you're complaining, but it's nice to hear that someone
is actually reading... Anyway, enjoy the series, and the next phile is written
by Sakima about religion.

					vYrus, Head of T.Y.M.E.
