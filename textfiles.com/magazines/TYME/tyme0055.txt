  The howl from the bathroom signaled something was wrong.

  Brad raced in to find Shiela screaming endlessly, clutching her face.

  The skin was literally melting off her face, dripping and running like
  a think milkshake. She screamed louder as her eyeball oozed gently from the
  socket, landing with a soft thump in her palm.

  Even then, her fleshy hands began to squish and run together, exposing
  pale bones and the pins put in her wrist when she was eight. The unblinking
  eyeball stared mercilessly at her as she felt other parts of her body
  stream away in goopy strands, like melted bubble gum this time.

  The flesh between her fingers finally let loose, and the bones in her
  hand seperated, letting the eye thunk to the floor, rolling over with
  bits of fuzz and tile chunks embedded in the iris and scalera.

  Her screams became half gargles as her throat melted away, yet her mouth
  still moved, dripping pus and blood and running skin.

  She turned away from the mirror, looking at Brad with a helpless expression
  locked on her decaying form. Brad winced at backed away from her clawing
  and bare fingers.

  She curled them inwards, looking at them, and shaking her head violently,
  drops of a no-longer-identifiable material gushed in spurts from her
  forehead, flying out like juice from a crushed fruit. A few drops splattered
  on Brad, sizzling like acid.

  Invisible tears were streaming down her face in torrents, streaking away
  skin and flesh as if it were nothing more then makeup. She was making
  soft sobbing sounds, but due to the seepage in her throat, it sounded more
  as if she were drowning.

  Brad watched, images flashing through his mind at a rapid and terrifying
  pace. Their first meeting. Their first kiss. The locket. He grappled with
  his memory, his sanity, desperatly trying to think of what could have caused
  this awful catastrophe.

  Brad shuddered. Fuck that. Turning his attention back to Sheila, he gasped.

  She had continued to melt away, screaming soundlessly. As her last remains
  pooled into a lump on her bathrobe, her stained skull grinning evilly
  at him, Brad reached down and picked out the locket he had given her.
  He opened it, looked inside, and screamed as loud as he could...

  Until the flesh in his throat began to run.
