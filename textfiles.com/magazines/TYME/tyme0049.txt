	Damn, what do ya know.....this time I have to agree with state law!
I am talking about the leash law. And I know probably what you are thinking, 
what a lame topic, but hell, this recent incident has really affected me. 
Around December ViPER got a new purebred boxer puppy for his birthday. 
Since he is the color of rust, we call him Rusty(or sometimes Oxidiation) 
This little dog was so cute, but very annoying sometimes, but you could see he was
full of love. Anyway, he started getting bigger, and now he is about half 
grown, but he is still really cool looking. Anyway, yesterday ViPER and I 
were walking him without a leash. We played with him in the park, and then
talked about how sad it would be if something happend to him, because he is
considered part of the family now, and I don't think I would want another dog
if Rusty dies. Anyway, we dropped by vYrus's house, and then Nek's house. We 
were gonna walk down to Ranch Market, so Nek loaned me sum cash and vYrus 
gave me a buck to pick him up a diet caffeine free pepsi. (HAHA! inside joke.)
As we were walking down the street, Rusty walks ok in the street in front of
a white car. SMACK! I scream in horror, "NOOOOO!!!!!!" And Rusty takes off
running at full speed down the street. We could not catch him, but we knew
he ran all the way down to trower. ViPER borrowed Nek's bike, and I kept 
calling him, praying he was not hurt, and he was just bruised. He SEEMED ok,
the way he ran without limping whatsoever. I could not find him, and ran home
hoping ViPER found him. On the way my mom drives by and picks me up. Turns 
out that when he ran to Trower he got hit again, HARD, this time twisting his
back leg around and around, completely fucking him up BAD. Then he couldn't
run, but just lie on the ground and limp and yelp. Some lady went up to him 
trying to help him, and Rusty bit her, so now he is in quarantine for ten 
days. Then we were given an option.
1: We put a cast on his back leg, and hope it heals naturally correct.
2: We spend $1,500 bucks and have him surgically repaired, and we will be 
able to run and and play again.
So my parents are gonna PAY the 1500 bucks, even though it will put us in 
the poorhouse. I think this really shows how people have the instinct to love
not just people, but also animals as companions. When we first got Rusty
I wasn't sure if I was going to fall in love with him(no sick ideas guys,
i am being sincere) but just yesterday I realized how much I consider him as
one of the family members, and how out household just doesnt feel right 
without his presence. I also have made a solemn dedication to FLIP OFF any
mother FUCKER who speeds in my neighborhood. Maybe I should by a pellet gun 
and shoot anyone who does. Anyway, those are my thoughts. I just hope
the surgery goes well. 
By the way: For $1500 bucks, we could buy FIVE more purebred boxers and have
	    Rusty casted. I'd say that dog means a lot to us.
