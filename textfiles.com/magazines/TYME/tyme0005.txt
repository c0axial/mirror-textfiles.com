                        D E A T H . . . 

        Ok people,  i have a question for you,  what IS death?  Is it the end 
of EVERYTHING you know?  or is it the begginning of something better?  It all
depends on your beliefs.  Well,  I say FUCK THAT!  Fuck you beliefs,  fuck all 
of it!  Just let go!  if you're going to hell,  well,  your going to hell.  
Might as well open up and recieve it.  I ain't condoning nothing here,  i'm 
just saying,  IF YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE,  JUST ENJOY IT!  If you're going to 
heaven,  well,  your going to heaven.  Might as well do the same thing you'd 
do if it were hell,  just open up and enjoy it.  If death is only something  
that's gonna bring you back to this crappy place far to many people like to 
call earth,  then,  well then you might as well enjoy life then,  cause that's
ALL THERE IS!  We're always dead AND alive.  It's a fundamental law of the 
universe (and YES,  there ARE laws that CAN'T be broken by even the most 
skilled thief:  nature has eyes,  she ain't gonna close them for you...),  
there is no way to be sure your not just in between lives.  What is there to
tell you that your not just in DEATH and DREAMING?  What is there to tell you
your in LIFE and AWAKE?  Dreaming/Death,  Life/Awake,  it's all the same thing.
I don't care how you wanna look at it.  We're all dead.  Whether dead inside,
or dead outside,  we are what we are,  dead...  If you wanna learn what death 
really is,  you must expeirience it.  Death can be the most PAINFULL thing in
the universe,  or it can be the most ENJOYABLE.  it's up to you to decide 
what it is.  It's based on your beliefs...  You believe in Hell,  then,  if you
"sin",  that's where your gonna go.  You believe in heaven and you don't "sin",
well,  you'll go to heaven.  It's up to your beliefs to decide.  We are just a
dream,  the dream of a soul.  The Soul sleeps,  upon it's awakeing (and,  in 
time it WILL awaken) our world will cease to exist.  The end of everything...
...or is it?  We will go back to the timeless,  and ageless,  era before the
birth of our universe.  (NOTE:  all this is just a storry,  used to prove a 
point.  While this is a belief in certain religions,  it is still only a 
storry with a lesson hidden in between the lines).  We are just dreaming.  
Look at our motto:  'Life is an Illusion,  Death is Reality'.  We live the
Illusion,  so that we don't Die in the Reality.  Have you ever thought about
why people fear death like they do?  Death is the only inevitable and 
unalterable,  physical,  thing.  ALL things must physically die.  When/If
someone reaches the state of "immortality",  they will not actually be 
eternal in the physical,  only in the spirit.  At the end of our Tyme,  the
"immortals" will perish along with everyone else.  Perhaps perish isn't the 
right word,  maybe rather,  i should say Die,  for to die is,  surely,  not
to perish,  bvut to leave.  The Tyme has come fore Death to be embraced,  
embraced in all her eternal beauty.  Death should be made love to,  not 
made war to.  I am not saying go out there and slice your wrist,  or od on
some crappy drug,  that would be only to cheat death,  to turn Her Power
against Her.  When She comes to take you,  She will do it kindly and lovingly.
She will not do it painfully unless you fight Her.  She will always win in the
End,  but if you fight Her,  she will only claim you,  PAINFULLY.  If it is 
not your Tyme,  Death will fight weakly,  Knowing that you will not go with her 
this tyme.  Then,  and only then,  will you win the War.  The question I ask
here is,  is Death really the skeleton and the scythe?  or is She a gorgeouse
women with a tight ass pussy and great face and big ass tits?  In a form that
is in spirit,  showing what she is Inside,  no only what She is on the Outside.
I'll bring the old hippie thing back in here "Make love,  not war" =].  That's
to death.  If I offend anyone with what I said about her being fine above,  
I'm only trying to make people see that,  both inside and out,  Death is beauty.
Not the rot and desolation that so many people believe it to be.  When she 
offers her embrace,  take it,  and enjoy it,  for it is a release more potent
and,  yet,  at the same time,  more dangeerous,  than any drug you've ever come
across in this earthly life.  I am not saying wish for death,  wish for life, 
but don't fear death for what She is,  for Death is the way that Life gives
it's love after you toil long within Him.  Death is the mate of Life.  However,  
don't get lost within death and ignore life,  for in doing so,  Death will
leave you,  surely as the sun must rise the next morning,  death will leave 
you.  To ignore the soil,  yet expect the pot to grow,  is foolish.  Don't
make that mistake,  lest you be left in limbo for eteernity.  Lonely of both
soul and love.  I have just told you one of the sacred truths of the universe,
(universal truth,  shyah,  RIGHT!  well,  WAKE UP!  there ARE a few...)  Death
and Life are interlinked,  destinies intermatched,  surely as your fingers are 
attached to your hand.  Don't be fooled you can love one,  yet loathe the otheer.
It won't work.  Embrace Death,  and Life will reward you.  Live not in the
Illusion,  but only Die in the Reality...

                                Together Forever in Death;
                                        Sakima

        
NOTE:  If you're a girl,  change all the "She's" to "He's",  and all the         
"He's" to "She's".  I'm not sexest,  and i don't plan on being taken that
way.  Also,  about the way I explained Death's image,  I am not calling
Death a sex toy,  I have more respect for Her than that,  I am using
the words I used because I know it will get people attention.  You see,  
in the spirit,  what you see is what you get.  I'm not trying to be boreing 
here,  only trying to give Death a break in this world.  It reallt is Tyme 
for us to greet Heer with open arms...
