                            Money Problems..
                            ----------------

   Now who around here really has a kickass computer? not me. i have a little
   tandy 1000 that aint werth nuthing except writing texts and running a fair-
   ly decent board. i guess. i mean, who can afford the awesome amazing petium
   powerhouses that are always being bragged about in ads? only the rich shits
   like munchkin. damn bitch. anywayz, i mean, i want a new computer as much
   as the next dude, but i cant afford it! and parents these damn days want
   you to earn all your own fucking money, and then you kiss their asses and
   then clean out the fucking gutters of the house and vaccuum everywhere and
   then ya clean your room and your sisters and then the dog shit in the back
   yard and the YOU ONLY GET FIVE FUCKING BUCKS! and they wonder why more and
   more people are stealing money then when they had this shit going. damn.
     i mean, our minimum wage may be 4.75 or whatever and theirs may have been
   sixty cents or some bullshit figure, but the inflation has hit the shit in
   the stores harder then it hit our paychecks, so we end up having to earn
   more for the same thing twenty years later. i mean, say something you want
   costs 50 cents then, and 4 bucks now. so inflation hit shit in the stores
   by 200%, but say we also earned a dollar an hour then and 5 bucks now. so
   that means that our paycheck is now 125% inflated, but that means we have
   to work harder if we want the real good shit! get me? i can't believe i
   just did math while writing for fun. yeecchhh... anywayz, it still pisses
   me off to the point where i'm desperate enuff for money that i would rob
   a bank or something. shit.... and to top it all off. i was blamed for
   stealing 10 grand from my parents. some people... i swear to fucking god,
   people like that need to get brains or lives or something if they want
   their kids not to hate them. kids hate them cause for everything that goes
   wrong, a kid gets blamed. no shit. moneys missing, my fault. sakima's dad's
   printer breaks down, his fault. matrix's grades are dropping, it's another
   kids fault. or its part of our everyday life. say..

     kid    : 'damn! finally got my paycheck for (xx) dollars!! cool! now i
               can buy my car!'
     parent : 'very good. i'm proud of you, kid.'
     kid    : 'i'll be back with my car!'
     parent : 'okay..'
     
     Three days later the kids gets in an accident, and cant pay for damages
     because he already blew his wad on the car itself.
     
     kid    : 'dad, can i borrow (xx) dollars to pay for my car getting
               fixed?'
     parent : 'you know, son, if you didnt blow your money on little petty
               things, you might have enough to fix your car.'
     
   it's scenarios like theses THAT PISS ME OFF! stupid fucking adults think
   that all kids spend their money on is shit that isnt very worthwhile. like
   these magic cards that have become so popular recently. i have a set of my
   own. i created a deck that i could play with, and all in all i have spent
   only 40 dollars on the entire game, and i have upwards of 600-700 cards.
   yet my dad sees the collection, doesn't know about the concept of trading,
   and says, 'is that what you've been blowing all your money on?' typical.
     well, i think i've rambled enough for my own good, so i'll take off...
   rasta la pasta, buuuudd....
