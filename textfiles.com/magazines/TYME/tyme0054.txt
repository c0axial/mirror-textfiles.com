                            Sleeping Habits
                            \=-----------=/
                            
    
    "YAHTZEE!@$#"
    
    What the fuck?
    
    "If i had a fucking can i would kill someone."
    
    Repeat that one more time?
    
    "Six sex sock seck soak sack seven six sex socks..."
    
    What the hell is this shit?
    
    This shit is people's sleeping habits. These phrases were all said by
  my roommate in his sleep.

    "HEEEYYY!@#@ I NEED SOMETHING TO DRINK!$!@# MAKE THAT NEGRO GET ME
  SOMETHING TO DRINK!@#!" <sounds of smacking lips>

    Now the only reason i put that particular line in this text was because
  he yelled it just now. JUST now. As i am writing.

    When i still lived with my parents, i rarely spent the night at home.
  On nights when i would actually sleep, my friends usually conked out before
  me. So i had my chance to observe. And i would always wonder, "Why do they
  do this in their sleep?"

    I snore. Pure and simple. People make fun of me. I don't care. It's loud,
  yes, but its natural for most of the male population and some of the females.
  But there is a scientific explanation for this. Deviated Septum. A fucked up
  nose. Pure and simple also. But what causes people to talk in their sleep?
  Or sleepwalk?
    
    One guy that lived here used to sleepwalk. I imagine he still does, but
  he has long since moved out. But anyhow, I would be watching some movie at
  about 3am (no cable, goddammit.) and he would walk out in his boxers,
  scratching some various part of his body. His head most of the time. Or
  his ass. He would look straight at me, mumble something unintelligable, and
  walk back into his bedroom.

    In the morning he would recall absolutely none of it.

    Which, quite frankly, scared the fuck out of me. That one person can
  perform normal, everyday movements perfectly in his sleep, and never
  remember it? How can his body tell him to do this? While SLEEPING? Sleep
  is relaxing and for restoring the body's energy. Isn't sleepwalking an
  unneccasary spending of energy? Or maybe it's because the body has the
  energy replenished, but the restoration is not complete?

    I don't know. And at the current moment, completely cut off from the
  outside world (our friggin phone line is disconnected for a few more days,
  so no more net and no research on this subject.), i won't know for a while.
  But it gives me a chance to think while everyone is asleep. And it lets me
  observe. Which makes me seem (and feel) like a scientist studying rats.

    Just a minute ago, i heard a door open. One of my friends came in. It
  is eight o'clock in the morning, and he just dropped off someone at home,
  and he doesn't want to go home. Okay, no problem.

    But how people can drop into a dead sleep in less then twenty seconds
  after sitting down is beyond me. Even i require a couple minutes for my
  body to start shutting itself down for sleep. But shit, he comes in, sits
  down, plop, snore. I can stay awake for a week straight, eating no food
  and drinking only water, and after seven days of no sleep, i will STILL
  require a couple minutes between the time i lay down and the time i 
  crash.

    It must be me. I see other people do it in a heartbeat. Sit. Lie down.
  Close eyes. Snore. All in ten to fifteen seconds. Like i said, it's beyond
  me.
  
    "What." <he's talking again> "Fuck off, i'm helping myself."

    Now what triggers talking? Dreams? People have told me a few times i
  spoke in my sleep with only one or two discernable words. One was "Kaiser".
  This drove me crazy for a week. Could i have been referring to the hospital
  chains? Or a position in German government? WWII is and always has been the
  most fascinating point in history to me, but this is a little to extreme.

    And the morning after, i couldn't even recall dreaming.

    Okay, yes, people forget dreams. But if a dream is vivid enough as to
  where you begin TALKING, shouldn't you be able to remember it? Why not?
  My roommate is always amazed when he hears what he said the night before.
  I am amazed when i am told. He thinks it's funny. It's normal for him. He
  talks nonsense. But i'm scared of it. What if i say something that could
  incriminate me? It's happened. I was saying one of my friend's girlfriend's
  names in my sleep and i had a big arguement with him the next day.

    But it wasn't my fault! I couldn't even remember a dream, much less
  explain why it was HIS girlfriend i had to be talking about!

    Now Kaiser and a name are legit topics. They can be followed up on. But
  this is me, who speaks single words.

    What kind of mindset creates these insane sentences of babble? Why, at
  roughly 2 to 2:30am, he has to yell as loud as he can (and strangely enough,
  not wake himself up. shit, i snore so loud i wake myself up.) this phrase:
    
    "Hold on and i'll go get the house."

    Hello? And this means what, now? And "make that negro get me something
  to drink"? I admit, this is a legitimate sentence, but what can set off
  "Six sex sock seck soak sack seven six sex socks..." and such babble? It
  staggers me to think that people's minds are that out of order. Not as
  in unfunctional, but as in.. well, cluttered is the only word that comes
  to mind.

    (Goddamn, the other guy (the enagaged one) is snoring so loud he sounds
  like a fucking foghorn. It's a wonder his fiance gets any sleep at night.)

    Well. I guess i am off to bed. I hope this text sets you thinking. I
  don't care if i make noises or snore or talk or even sleepwalk while i'm
  asleep, but i swear to god, if i ever find any footage or tape of me doing
  any of that...

    Sweet dreams. hehehehehhe... =]
