			The Tyme to be Alive...

	Sure as hell aint right now! everything all fucked to hell! escpecial
-ly all the dipshit dumbasses who think that summer is for school! funk dat! 
this life could turn out to be the shittiest in the world cuz of the pricks 
who like to fuck it up with their work and stuff... shit like that. major
lameasses... anywayz, this is really cool... life is okay, if you're a snail
who has no brain or something, but if ya got a good woman, a decent amount of
money, plenty of friends, and a good amount of spare time. life can be good.
otherwise, you're fucked cause not having any one of those things can hinder
you seriously... like the money. if you didn't have money, why would you have
a woman? they would dump/ditch/abandon/whatever you cuz you couldn't do any-
thing nice for them! shit, man... and if ya didn't have enough money, what
the hell would you do for fun anywayz? nothing *I* can think of! huh... and if
ya didnt have enuff spare time, you would have a helluva time trying to do
anything that required an extensive amount of tyme.... like sex, for instance.
i am the head of this text line, and s0l0mn has already fucked more chicks
then i have! bullshit! what a crock. not like i'm any hornball looking for
any fuck i can get, but i mean, i dunno if s0l0mn is doing it cuz he had the
chance, or loves them, or what, but still... fuckin' a. Pissing me off even
more is the fact that parents think they can do any fucking thing they want to
you and get the fuck away with it! not quite. mine used to fuck me over, but
shit, i told them off, they wouldn't quit, so i left town a few times. got
them to loosen up, and my life is hella easier. if your parents think they
have got you completely wrapped around their litle finger, prove to them that
they don't. do what i did, if ya have to... i worked, didn't it? heh....
	Ah, another reasdon this is the tyme to be alive is the fact that so
many people are understanding you problems and everything else lilke that. i
mean, hell, if ya got the feeling you hate life or ya wanna kill yerself, or
blow something up or destroy something just to vent your anger on it, i say
go ahead, unless it will git you in some serious shit! =] anywayz.. well, i
think i better close this text, cuz i think i'm about to get yelled at by
Teq cause i didn't show up at her house today.... hasta.
