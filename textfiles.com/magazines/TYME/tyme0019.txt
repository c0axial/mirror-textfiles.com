                             vYrus' BBS Guide
                             ----------------

   Well, this is for all the people that suck at BBSing and have been stupid
   enuff to get themselves blacklisted, (you know who i mean, napalm) and i
   hope that you all manage to make some sense. It is divided into a couple
   of parts, Newusers, Messages, Files, The Sysop, and Etiquette (whatever
   that means. =] ). Enjoy..



                                New Users
                                ---------
   
   Being a new user is easy. If you can meet the Sysop's standard of a new
   user. Use at least TWO peices of real info. I would recommend a first name
   and a phone number. I know half the 'ELiTE' (god i hate that word) BBSers
   would look at me like i belong in Napa State (Hospital) because 'what kind
   of fool gives out their phone number?' Well, for one, unless you have the
   type of person in your town that can find out every piece of info about you
   just by your phone number, give them your data number so it just rings and
   rings and rings.. =]  Most Sysops want voice validation, that's how we do
   it over at ‰xîdus BBS (707-935-6867 =] ) and anyone who can't prove they're
   a real person and not some lamer using multiple handles (which is a no-no
   anyway) gets deleted on the spot. So a number and at least a first name
   will satisfy most.
     Don't bullshit through NUV Infoforms. If you see ANI, and you don't know
   what it mean, then say exactly that! You don't know! Don't put some bull-
   shit like Assholes Need Intelligence. That can bring down your marks with
   the Sysop. Nobody wants smartasses.
     Last, don't insult the sysop in new user applications. We saw one dude
   log on and leave this message:

      hey i hack for -$50 an hour if that isnt good enough then fuck you

   Not too appropriate, eh?  If you guessed this guy was deleted on the spot,
   yer right. Not a letter to impress anyone.


                           Message Bases
                           -------------

   Anyone who has been BBSing for any amount of time past the lamer 3 months
   that most 'Christmas Modemers' last can tell you that message bases can be
   the core a of a great BBS. Before i became a sysop of Exodus, i called it
   only for messages, and i kept my personal file ratios at a 2:1. Beat that.
   More on files later, but message can help ya meet new people, get you new
   friends, new enemies, and new information. Before i went into posting on
   the FX-Net (also known as the Kurt Cobain-Net) everyone there had an op-
   inion on every message posted, so you had to watch yourself. It was later
   nicknamed the 'Kurt Cobain-Net' because after he killed himself, the entire
   net went up in flames. Quite literally. The whole of every base erupted in
   to a flame war. You could read the 'Software Developments' section and some
   dude would have written a Kurt Cobain trivia program. Which set off this 1
   annoying little mutherfukker, Skywalker. It's lamers like these that
   pollute our systems. He had to direct every conversation towards 'Kurt
   NoBrain'. Of course, this earned him little respect, and although i never
   heard what happened to him, i think he eventually dropped out of the BBS
   scene. Haha. What a loser.
     But in posting messages, if the software has a quote function, USE IT!
   No one will have any fucking clue what you're talking about unless you
   quote the person you're replying to anyway. That also helps you stay on
   track of whatever subject you are all arguing/talking/discussing about. It
   also helps to keep any unwanted lamers from interrupting your train of
   thought because without quoting, you wouldn't have any idea what the person
   was saying, either. So use it. In most ANSi fullscreen editors it's '/Q',
   or just find out what it is.


                                 File Areas
                                 ----------

     A BBS can also be known for it's extensive fileareas. Boards with CD-ROMs
   usually attract the most attention, and it's those kind of boards that most
   of the time, the sysop doesn't care about people downloading a lot, or it's
   the sysop that complains that people download too much. Hey, if they adver-
   tise it, LEECH IT! Hell, don't bother if they complain at you. Tell 'em!
   If the ad where you saw the BBS says '1.2+ gigs online!' then hold them to
   it. Don't expect a bunch of shit from the sysop for being a leech. If he
   wants uploads, upload a .GIF. Make sure that it isn't THAT poorly scanned,
   or else he/she/they/it might just go off again. Quality .GIF's can be found
   in boards all over. Not mine, though, just text here.
     Some boards will also have themes in them. Like Meidivel (sp?) stuff
   .GIF's only of just text or whatnot. Maybe even a board devoted to ONE 
   software company (i.e. Apogee's Support BBS) or it can be a customer
   service board. (i.e. USR's Service Board) Any way it goes, each BBS has
   it's own blend of files.
     Ratios are mantained by many sysops. A 10:1 ratio would mean that for
   every ten files you download, you are expected/required to upload one. Some
   boards have ul/dl K ratio. K being Kilobytes, aka, file sizes. So a 10:1
   ratio in this case would mean for every 10k you download, upload 1k. You
   know how it goes.
   
                                  SysOps
                                  ------
                                  
     Key rule for surviving in a BBS community : don't piss off a Sysop. Most
   likely they will have some sort of connection to get you fucked up. Kiss
   their ass if you have to, most of 'em love that, especially Power Rat. =]
   Treat 'em like they were a normal person, another user you're leaving notes
   to. Treat his system like it was your system, nobody likes it if their fave
   BBS crashes, and you'll be losing out too. Just because you hate a system,
   doesn't mean you destroy it with flame wars or virii or whatnot. Some of
   your BEST friends could use the same BBS and would be mad as hell if it
   went down. I should know. I would crash Total Anarchy once in awhile so
   that it went down for a couple hours, but it was nothing permenent. And
   since i was Co-Sys (Co-Sysop) people called me demanding to know what hap-
   pened.. so I told them i had no clue. =]
     To sum it up : A Sysop is just an user with higher privledges then you.
   Pure and Simple. So don't blow it. Like that dude's newuser message, don't
   get 'em mad. =]
   
   
                            Etiquette (what's that?)
                            ------------------------
                            
     Etiquette is basically how you're supposed to act on a BBS. Like be cool
   while writing message, don't be a dick, treat the Sysop like he was your
   best bud, and don't do anything that would seriously annoy somebody or
   damage the system. I know i prolly already said all that, but i'm bored and
   i need to keep writing.. =]

                                     Closing
                                     -------

     Guess that's it... enjoy... and if someone you know just got a modem for
   their birthday or something, give them this guide. Maybe i will write up
   another one for getting through Renegade.. seems to be a popular software.
   What the hell. It's the best. =]
