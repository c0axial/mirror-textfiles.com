I wrote this about a month ago, if you like it, cool.
If you don't, I could care less.

                                      hate
                                      ----


Do you know what its like to hate?
When its deep in your heart.
Oh, god.
Do you know what its like to have innocence,
the complete and total innicence of a child,
that time when it seems like you can do anything you want,
anything, there are no boundaries to where you can go,
that comfort, that complete and utter trust.
Do you know what its like, to have that ripped away?
Oh, god.  If I had one set of ovens in this world,
I know what kind of person I'd eradicate from the face of the planet.
I know hate, I've known hate for a long time, it festers inside,
it grows, it feeds.
My soul is no longer healthy, my soul is now blackened by it.
Tell me if you have had anything taken away from you,
with such force, that no one can be trusted any longer.
I know what its like, I know how it happens, I know what kind of
FUCKING SCUM do that to people.
Remember what I said about the ovens?
I have a very big set of ovens.
And each one of them, has the name of a part of my soul,
my innocence, that has been, ripped, away.
motherfucker
I know what kind of person feeds on you and I.
The mosquitos of the heart are very close.
Can you hear them?
I know I can.  I have heard the sound too many times to mistake the taste.
I hope you can tell what it is, for your sake, and for the
sake of your children.  I hope you won't be fooled by its treachery.
You may think the coccoon holds a butterfly,
wait until you find out it holds a moth.
I sometimes wish that I could go back and recapture my childhood.
Sometimes, and then I remember, that I did'nt have a childhood.
I don't even have a clue what one is.
"Mother is the name for GOD on the lips and hearts of all children."
I got that from a book I recently bought.
The more I read and understood that book, the more it came
to my attention that everything written in it was true.
Sometimes, you don't know if you are in pain until somebody comes along and
hurts you.
That has happened to me many times.  And each time I've wanted to hurt
myself for being so ignorant.
Don't be ignorant to this, learn about it.
I know what its like to lose everything, I've been there before.
Ever tried to commit suicide?
I've been there also.  The best advice people could come up with
was 'don't do it'.  Thats the best advice you can probablly get
for that.  Don't do it.
If I had sex for every day I was truly happy, you would find a virgin.
But still, people keep trying.  Children get murdered every day
all over the world.  Children get raped and molested every day
in every part of this world.  I can't believe how this place
festers and rots in its own unforgivable hate.  I see it so often
I think I could drown.  I am going to end this now.  Please don't be blind to what I have 
been so many times before.
