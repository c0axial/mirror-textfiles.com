                         CHRONICLES
                    Chapter I: Beginning

     I remember, I remember, I remember,... nothing.  She left me
here, she left me here to die.  Oh, god.  When will the pain
stop.  But it doesn't, the pain increases.  Oh shit, I thought,
I'm going to die.  I felt my soul slipping away forever into the
darkness of the night.  I'm lost, lost in my own pain, and I
can't find the way back from where I came.  Finally, the pain too
intense, I passed out amongst the tombstones, and the eternally
resting.  From that moment on, I was damned to hell.

     I remember waking up, I believe it was a few hours later,
the sun began to creep over the eastern hills.  Blessing the day
with warmth and light.  Warmth and light I was now not worthy to
be a part of.  I felt parts of my body burning.  I looked down at
where the sun was striking my skin and noticed that parts of my
skin were starting to burn.  I quickly ran out of the sunlight
and into an open tomb.  The burning sensation still lingering in
my flesh.  I stayed there, in that smelly old tomb, lying upon a
cold, stone coffin, pondering what had just happened.  It was
insane, suddenly I just started burning.  There were no fires
around, and I didn't notice anyone near me.  Although the only
parts of my body that felt as if they were burning, was the areas
of my skin that were in the sunlight.  I thought back to the
events of the night before.  For some reason I could vaguely
remember any nights before that.  

     I started to panic.  I was shaking and sweating
heavily.  And I wanted to scream, but could not.  I laid there,
futilely telling myself that everything will be alright,
everything will be alright.  No, everything is not alright. 
What happened last night?!?  Why can't I remember anything?!? 
Why the fuck am I laying in a tomb?!?  I kept asking myself such
questions but strangely enough got no answers.

     I became drowsy and fell asleep.  Waking up, I found that it
was night.  It was also raining much harder than the night before.                                                         I  also remember that I had no dreams.  I walked out of
the cemetery, and into town.  I walked into the colonial taverne
and ordered a drink.  The stench of alcohol was overwhelming, I
looked around and saw old friends who had now forgotten who I
was.  People looked as they should, but, didn't.  The walls
seemed to move but stayed the same.  Not wanting to draw
attention to myself I said nothing and acted as if everything
were normal.  I have went to this taverne every night since I was
twelve years-old, and for some reason that I did not know, everything
and everybody seemed so different, but yet stayed the same.  I am
not able to describe it in more detail.  The bartender brought me
my drink, I looked around again, as if in a dream, and tipped my
glass back.  I spit it out onto the floor.  The taste so
disgusting and the smell so putrid, it made my stomach turn. 
This is my favorite drink!  But something made me spew it out
onto the floor as if it were swill.  

     "What are you coming in here for sir!?!", roared the
bartender, "If you are just going to spew out my liquor as if it
were horse piss!?!"

     "Well perhaps if you didn't get your liquor from the urine
of your horses sir, I might not be forced to spew it out." I shot
back.

     The bartender staring at me in disbelief, punched me in
the face.  I didn't feel the pain, nor the blow itself.  The
bartender then hunched over and started howling in pain, 
clutching his hand to his body.  

     "Get the hell out of my taverne!" He screamed at me.

     Some of the other bar patrons around me started to move
towards me with their pistols and daggers quite clear enough for
me to see.  I ran past them, knocking over whoever happened to be
in my path.  They proceeded to chase after me, but only followed
me a few blocks until they gave up their pursuit.  I ran out into
an alleyway and sat down amongst the mud and rain.  The taste of the
liquor still lingering in my mouth.  I looked to my left and
noticed three poorly clothed old men with liquor
bottles in each of their hands.  I studied them more and more,
and a sick thirst darkened my mind.   An appetite I had never
known before.  I realized that I desired their blood.

     I walked over to one of them. 

     "Hello sir!", I said with a joyous tone in my voice, "Nice
weather wouldn't you say?"

     The old man looked back up at me as if I were insane.

     "What in blazes are you talking about young man?", he said,
"Its pouring rain!"

     I couldn't argue with him on that point.  Stupid question.

     "How true, sir.", I said back to him, trying to maintain my
joyous voice, "But still, shouldn't we give thanks for all that
we have?"

     He shifted around so he could get a better look at me.

     "Are you tipsy young man?", he said, "What makes you so
damned joyful?"

     I decided not to carry on the conversation any longer, and
the old man noticing this, moved away and laid down.  I stared at
his neck, it was enticing me, inviting me, calling me.  No, I
thought to myself, still struggling with the idea of actually
killing him to taste his blood.  I am not going to kill this poor
man just to satisfy this ugly thirst.  But the hunger growing
more intense, making me salivate.  I walked over to him.  Reached
down, picked him up by the neck of his tattered coat, and bit
into his flesh.  The sweet taste flowed into my mouth, making me
want more.  I then tore his head off of his body, and drained the
corpse of all it had left.  I dropped the now lifeless body, in a
daze, and looked around me.  The two other old homeless men
were staring at me in disbelief.  I took a step towards them, not
still grasping what I had just done.  They took off from where
they were sitting, screaming down the alleyway, into the black
night.  I sat down next to the corpse of the old man.  I took off
his coat and put it on.  The shock wore off and soon I felt like
I had never felt before in my life.  I felt, satisfied, almost
euphoric.  I felt more content than I could have ever imagined.  

     Walking back to the taverne, I soon forgot about the old
man.  Some of the bar patrons who pursued me not too long ago
were standing at the entrance of the taverne.  They quickly
realized who I was and began walking towards me, one even had his
pistol cocked and ready to fire.  I stopped moving towards them,
and they did the same.

     "So you whining dog, do you think you are going to come back
in here and vandalize this place again." Asked the one with the
pistol.

     "I don't know," I replied, "perhaps this time I should spit down your
throat."

     "Watch what you say sir," he shot back, "or you might find
yourself with a hole in your head."

     One of the men beside him drew his knife.

     "Or a dagger in your breast." the other man added.

     "How about your mother's breast?" I replied.

     "Arrogant whelp!" he shouted.

     The man with the pistol fired, the bullet tearing through my
shoulder.  I staggered back, wincing at the pain.  I glanced over
at the hole in my flesh and noticed that the hole started closing
up.  The pain gone I looked back at the man with the pistol.

     "Care to shoot again?" I asked with a smile on my face.

     "This cannot be true!" he shouted, firing again.

     And again the same thing happened.  I grew tired of this and
walked over to where he was standing.  The other two running away
down the street. 

     "You are not mortal sir!", he screamed at me, "You are the
devil himself!"

     I paid no attention to what he was saying and took the
pistol from his hand and shot him in the head.  His body slumped
to the ground.  I dropped the pistol on him and stepped into the
taverne.  The bartender did not notice me enter, so I walked up
the stairs to the balcony and took the nearest whore by the hand.

     "And what do you want sir?", she said to me smiling.

     "Why don't we go and find out madam?", I replied smiling
also.

     "You know sir, that people such as myself don't offer anything
unless there is some benefit for our services.", she said still
smiling.

     I checked the jacket that I had taken from the corpse of the
old man and found a good sum of change.  I handed her a few coins
and she proceeded to show me to one of the rooms.  She wasn't
homely, although she wasn't that beautiful either.  She looked
like she was older than myself.  About maybe in her forties.  But
that didn't matter to me.  I was feeling quite good and wanted
only her body, not her face, or her age.  She laid me down upon
the bed in the small room and went to close and lock the door.  I
took my new jacket off and deposited it along side me.  She
turned around and sauntered over to me.  With a grin on her face
she started to undress me.  After she was finished I unclothed
her and I started to kiss her body.  She began moaning and
whimpering like a child.  I sucked on her breast and she became
louder.  Although the sound of the taverne below drowned much of
the sound of her voice.  I moved up on her body, caressing as I
went.  And then started to kiss her.  I fondled her breasts for
awhile, as we kissed for what seemed like hours.  

     Her skin was so warm and the repeated moaning began to
excite me more.  I heard the sound of her heart beating rapidly
in her chest.  I became thirsty again.  Darkening my soul
and my thoughts, the hunger returned.  Still kissing her, I bit
into her sweet flesh.  She must not have noticed at first for she
still whimpered.  But, she felt her blood trickling down her
cheek and pulled away.  She wiped her mouth with her hand and
found her blood smeared across it.  She started to scream
the word 'Nosferatu' over and over again.  I grabbed onto
her, and she tried to break away from my grasp.  Like a mouse
trying to free itself from the steel trap, knowing fully well
that its going to die.  

     The feeling of euphoria came back even stronger.  The trance                                              becoming even more potent.  I got off of the bed and stood
up, looking down at her I saw the look of terror on her face. 
The predator, and the prey I thought.  And I remembered the
night before in the cemetery, when the vampire tried to drain me
of my life as I was doing to this woman.  The feelings of    
euphoria left.  They were replaced with hatred and loathing, and
then fear.  Fear for what I now knew I had become.  Fear for what
I had just done.  Fear for what was going to happen.  The woman
started screaming even louder.  I panicked and ran over to her
desperately trying to calm her, but with no luck.  She grew more
frantic.  I attempted to think of ways to make her silent, and
only one thought came to mind.  I reached around her head with my
arms, and twisted her neck. 


     I heard a sickening crunch, and felt her body grow limp in
my arms.  I dropped her lifeless body onto the floor, the
blood still trickling from her mouth made a small puddle  on the
floor and I observed myself in it, staring right back at me with
the same look of panic and disbelief.  I grew even more alarmed,
and it was hard to put my clothing back on.  People's voices grew
louder, and they began approaching the room.  I heard the
clomping of boots running up the stairway.  The bartender was
banging on the door and yelling, he started to unlock the door. 
I ran over to the window, took one look back at the naked corpse
on the floor, and jumped.

     I didn't even realize what I was doing until I hit the
ground.  I felt no pain as I got up and ran.  I ran back towards
the cemetery and found the tomb I had slept in earlier that day.
Exhausted, I laid down upon the stone coffin once more.  

     I don't know how long I laid there thinking about what had
just happened, until I heard footsteps coming towards me.  I sat
up, frantic, and having delusions that people were after me I
looked around for the source of the noise.  And then in the
doorway of the tomb, she stood.  I remembered her face clearly
and in every detail.  The same blue eyes, the same velvet skin. 
The figure in the doorway was the vampire from the night before.
