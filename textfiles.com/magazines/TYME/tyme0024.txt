                                The Tribe
                                ---------

    Trekking through the steamy, lush undergrowth was no easy task for her.
  She had been stranded for many days at a time, but never anything like this.
    She had been part of a jungle expedition, but the chopper had crashlanded
  and everyone but her and the pilot had been killed. The pilot needed some
  drastic help, for part of his arm had been torn from the socket. The blood
  had been flowing like a river, pooling by his side, his life seeping out of
  that one wound.
    She had been braving the shrubs with a machete, found in the backseat of
  the chopper. Hacking her way through, she busted in on a scene of destruct-
  ion. A gathering of huts encircled a large clearing, and in the center were
  many tiny little men, hunched over something. One of them stepped away, to
  reveal a family in the middle.
    Quietly slapping at the mosquito on her neck, she advanced forward, wary
  of what would happen if she were caught. Moving to get a better view of the
  ritual, she noticed the little child was cowering behind her mother, the
  mother was behind the father, and the father and teenage son were standing
  bravely side to side. She also noticed a large bloody patch by each of their
  throats. Their larynx's had been cut out.
    She angled herself yet agai and proceeded to watch in fascination. The man
  had been silently begging for their freedom, and his wife had been plucking
  nervously at her husbands sleeve.
    A whooping began from what seemed to be the village witch doctor, and he
  raised a large, serrated knife embalmed with symbols and precious stones.
  The balde was curved like a bow, and the entire deadly weapon was pointed
  at the small child clutching at her mother. The doctor picked up the child,
  mumbled what sounded like 'Hum dee hi ya oh!' and decapitated the child with
  one swift stroke. The surprised look on the kids face gave way to a rolling
  of the eyes, and then nothing.
    She turned back into the bushes, gagging with disgust. She had just wit-
  nessed a human life being taken. Sickening. She finished retching, her feeb-
  le noises unheard by the whooping crowd of pygmies.
    The fifteen-year-old was next. As the blade came flashing towards his mid-
  section, he grabbed it, unaware of the sharpness. The blade cut cleanly
  through his hand, severing it. He stared in shock, and then stared no more
  as his eyes were taken out, one at a time, impaled on the long dagger.
    She turned again, breathing deeply so she would not attract attention, for
  now the crowd had fallen silent for what the doctor would do next.
    The teenager silently screamed as he felt a little stab of pain in his
  stomach, and reached down to feel some slippery rope, or some slimy garden
  hose or... his own intestines, tumbling through his fingers. He gave way,
  and threw up all over the doctor, spraying bile everywhere. The doctor took
  no notice, and make three quick strokes with the blade. One took off his
  hand, the one holding his innards, the next took away his nose, whereupon
  he clutched his face, screaming sliently, and the last removed his head
  from his shoulders.
    She turned, face burning, eyes streaming, grappling with her stomach, 
  desperatly trying not to vomit.
    The mother. She stepped forward bravely, after what had happned to her
  son and daughter, stood there, waiting for death. She closed her eyes and
  braced herself, not flinching.
    The pygmies stood there until she opened them, and then quickly sliced
  her two major arteries. The pulmonary, the femoral, and the jugular vein.
    Falling to the ground, blood spraying everywhere like some unnnatural gey-
  ser, she writhed, sliently cursing the men who had done this. Her eyes
  closed, and her own face was dripping with her body's life, dripping from
  her body, dripping to the ground. Dripping everywhere. Dripping off the
  tribesmen, who howled and pounded the ground in ecsatcy. The doctor made
  some kind of noise, and a large bowl was brought forth.
    She sat in the bushes, eyes glued to the scene. The three bodies already
  laying on the ground, and the one that was about to be. She saw the man
  bring a bowl forward. The father stood there, fists clenched, ready to beat
  the crap out of anyone who drew near.
    The doctor dropped his dagger of death. and took the bowl with both hands.
  The little thing was over two feet long, so he required both hands to keep
  from dropping it.
    He placed it on the ground, and the woman in the bush could see it was
  empty.
    Two men grabbed the father and stuck him with a branch sharpened to a
  needlepoint. The father collapsed immediatly. She surmised the little hypo-
  dermic branch must have had a tranquilizer on it.
    The men planted stakes in the ground and tied the father's wrists and
  ankle to them. The doctor stepped foward and gently slapped the man,
  demanding he wake up. The man stirred, and the bowl was again brought forth.
    The doctor laid the bowl above the man's head, and another blade was
  brought forth.
    It was wickedly sharp, as sharp as the teeth of the devil, and it was
  intricatly adorned with symbols and gems, as the last one, but in the hilt
  of the blade, there was a fat red ruby, surrounded by a thick wad of purple
  stones, unidentifiable to the woman in the bushes. The blade glimmered in
  the evening light, even when there was almost no light to see by, with all
  the trees up above filtering out a lot of the daylight. It was carried on a
  blanket of leaves and roots, and the woman feared to see what would be done
  with it.
    Just then the sky darkened even further, obscuring much of the ceremony,
  but she was still able to see. The doctor raised the blade high above his
  head, and began chanting an unprnounceable mantra. He lowered the blade, and
  inserted it into the man's clothes, stripping them away from him piece by
  piece, so that his bare body lay against the earth. The doctor began his
  operation, raising the blade above the man's...
    She turned away and heard a howl. The man had no voice, yet she heard the
  scream in her ears, in her mind, and in her soul.
    She turned back to see the dismembered part laying in the bowl. The man
  was panting in exertion, but he was still alive, and he struggled at his
  bonds. Blood had been spewing forth, but a small torch had cauterized the
  wound, leaving no chance of bleeding to death.
    The parts were his fingers, severed one by one, to be burned shut again.
  The father was soon without appendeges on his hands. Next, his hands them-
  selves. Placed in the bowl, it made for an interesting, yet disgusting
  display. One by one, the rest of his body parts were removed and placed in
  the bowl, and she stared, unbelieving the man hadn't passed out or died
  from shock.
    The doctor raised the bloody, dripping blade above the man's heart, chant-
  ing again. The man was tied now only by his stomach, since he had no other
  parts to be tied. The same two men that had earlier stuck him held him down,
  and she watched, holding her mouth shut as the man's pain became part of her
  body, His head jerked around and he stared her straight in the eyes. He
  screamed his silent scream, and the doctor held his heart up triumphantly,
  the lump of flesh still beating away, as the man's chest was cauterized
  also.
    The last part of him, while he was being burned, was his brain. The blade
  sliced relentlessly through his skull, and the man thrashed and pounded
  against the earth, his mind and sould were removed through the top of his
  head. He howled in unbearable agony, and as the woman turned around, a set
  of six little pygmies were behind her. They grinned their evil, black-
  toothed grins, and as her head bounced off her shoulders, she saw no more.

  (Adapted from a story i wrote in class)

    Well, i suppose that would have to be one of the better ones i have
  ever written. I guess i might have beenable to make it better, but i
  DID write this while in school. =] i also suppose i should have the
  dubious distinction of having one of the first T.Y.M.E. Texts to be
  over 10k.. =]
    I have a few more, and i guess i could write them all up into one,
  or i could release the seperatly, into individual texts, cause some
  of them are rather big, and some of them are a little dinky...
    But almost all of them deal with blood and stuff. So i guess you
  can also tell i have a very morbid mind. =] I was copying this text
  off a printed copy of the original, and i have the teacher yapping
  her yap in the background. so i suppose i shall close, and do me a
  favor and send me some email and tell me how you like this text. I
  want some opinions from everyone! (well, everyone except SNIPER.
  muhahahaha.... =] )

    Peace, Love, and Hi to all the other morbid minds... =]
