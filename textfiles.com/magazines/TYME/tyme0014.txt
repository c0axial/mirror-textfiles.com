				Many Things


	
	This year I learned that Napa people are hella different from 
Sonoma people. If you all don't know,  Stewart is kinda weird, but he 
seems Okay.  He tried to hack my board and I caught his ass, so don't 
listen to everything that he says, but parts of what he says is true.
vYrus cannot spell either, right now he is writing the new member li-
st.  I tell you that vYrus is most correct in his Lamerz text, even 
though he forgot a few people, it wuz pretty much correct.  Any of 
you wanna be hackers you can suck my Ding Dong, and if any of you fuk
with my board, I will fuking kill your ass.  Enough of that stuph. 
I am the newest member to T.Y.M.E. and I have to tell you that most
of the members are hella cool, there are only two that I think are 
just kinda, how should I put this, well they should be on the lamer
list, and they are Punisher and Stewart, but lately stu has been 
pretty cool.  Most of the people in T.Y.M.E. listen to Alternative
and Heavy Metal and shit like that, well, I like most of those kinds 
of music, but I mainly listen to Rap(not C-Rap) and old rock like
Pink Floyd and shit like that, but I even like a TINY bit of Country
go ahead and laugh.  And just to tell you, Other than supporting 
T.Y.M.E., Total Anarchy Sux!!
