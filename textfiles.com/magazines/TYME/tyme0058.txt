                        "Don't Fuck With Me."
                        \=-----------------=/
    
    Jeff sighed in frustration as he lost his focus for the fourth time.
  Taking a deep breath, closed his eyes, and reopened them. He smiled.

    His world was around him. The skies were a majestic array of color,
  from blue to burnt orange to a deep shade of purple. The grass on the
  ground and the leaves of the trees were a pure green, without any
  imperfections. Looking at the lake by his home, the water rippled and
  waved, sending out sparkles of light, caught by the sky and forming
  a amazing picture above. The water was a clear, deep blue, stretching
  for miles.

    Jeff sighed and laid back on the grass. The place was perfect. He
  had spent most of his life developing this place, and he was finally
  in it.

    The peace and tranquility was shattered by a rousing yell, which
  sounded like a rusty speaker.

    "JEFF! Get your scrawny ass in here and clean up this mess you made!"

    His world fell apart. The lake turned black, the skies a menacing grey,
  and the grass around him died. The trees withered, leaves falling every-
  where, crumbling to compost as soon as they touched the earth.

    Jeff seethed with fury. If the old bitch wanted him to clean up another
  of her messes, he was going to shoot her. It was never his problem, he
  cleaned the place spotless before going outside.

    Climbing his way up the porch, the steps moaned and protested under his
  weight. Entering the kitchen, Anna confronted him, her rolls quivering
  as she shook with silent rage.

    "How many fucking times have i told you NEVER to leave this place with-
  out finished your chores?!" she screamed at him.

    Jeff flinched under the verbal onslaught, filtering it out, focusing yet
  again. The voice soon dwindled and faded out completely, leaving only a
  quietly moving mouth and a shaking mountain of fat standing before him.

    Focusing tightly, he molded his images to fit his specifications. The
  grime and dirt coating the walls of the kitchen erased itself, the scuffs
  and rips in the linoleum sealing up, as if they had never existed.

    Anna looked around in amazement. Her home had been transformed between
  her very eyes. Narrowing them, she looked at the teenager with distaste.

    Not seeing her, Jeff began reforming her in his mind. Silent screams
  errupted from her being, as her hair caught fire and sent her scalp
  bubbling like frying bacon. Her clothes ignited, sending tongues of flame
  high in the air.

    Jeff wrinkled his nose at the smell. It smelled like a slaughterhouse,
  or a meat market.

    Drawing his focus tighter, hair-thin, Jeff sent one last burst of energy
  through his mind and into the old bitch, causing her to explode. Flaming
  blobs of fat and bone flew everywhere at high speeds, all just barely
  missing Jeff himself.

   Quietly, he spoke.

   "Don't fuck with me."

    Pulling himself out of his self-induced trance, he smiled, and walked
  outside to enjoy his creations. Birds sang, and rabbits hopped everywhere,
  showing no trace of what had happened.

    Of course, it HAD been planned that way.
