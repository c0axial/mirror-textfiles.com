                           Water Water Everywhere...
                           -------------------------

    And not a drop to drink... christ, we were flooded bigshit the last
  couple days, as everyone who lives around here with eyes and a brain
  knows, but let me tell you a bit about what i found out from other ppl
  that has happened to them...

    All schools were closed for two days, making many people very happy.
  The schools reopened on a Wednesday, to the dismay of all the students,
  but from what i hear, Crusher Creek (the Vintage High School creek) was
  still a little higher then it should have been. My school, Temescal, was
  drenched as well, since this school is quite the literal mudhole, and i
  also hear that Napa high is soaked to hell too.

    Many stores were closed as well....

    Whoa! It's starting to pour! Awesome! I hope it floods again.. like, no
  more school for awhile again... =]

    Anyway, a lot of the store were closed. I went into one the day after
  the flood was over, and it was pitiful. There was an inch or two of water,
  plus a nice thick layer of mud underneath. I waited around while they use
  a vacuum and a pump to suck out the water and a little mud, and it took
  them three days to remove all the mud, i heard.. the sandbags apparently
  didn't help either, because they had all fallen apart and all the sand was
  gone from them.
    My street wasn't much better. At the highest point, i was up to my knees
  just standing in the middle of the street! My little sister just recently
  had surgery, but she was out there wading around too. And yet she can't
  get up to get herself a fucking glass of water... bitch. Anyhow, me and
  Nekrosyne (formerly Sakima) were busy helping out the neighbors and shit.
  We dragged garbage cans up to their owners porch before they floated away,
  and we knocked on doors to get people to move their cars out of the street
  before they drowned. One car, where the people weren't home, had about
  three inches of water in the bottom of it before the owner came and moved
  it.
    The toughest part was when this chicks VW stalled in the middle of the
  lake in our street. So we pushed her car UP a driveway, and let her in my
  house and let her call her parents. She got home okay, but the people whose
  driveway we pushed it up thought us all overreacting assholes because of
  the fact that two doors down from them, a guy had evacuated, and me and my
  next door neighbor had put up tarps in front of the garage door so the water
  wouldn't go under. It would, too. Some retarded jerk would drive through
  the two foot deep lake doing maybe 20 or 25, and the backwash would totally
  flood everyone. The car with all the water in it had the seats ruined cuz
  the level would water in it would surge upward when some tard drove by and
  pushed water in front and behind them. And the backwash also knocked over
  three little kids at one point, and they went home with colds, and it ALSO
  ran all the way up my driveway, into the tarp protecting the garage, and
  up onto my front porch.. damn them. At least eight or nine people pulled
  this little stunt that first night, and it was NOT fun..

    Of course, staying up until three AM, me and Nekrosyne were fukkin around
  on the net, i was showing him around, how to get what you want, etc, and
  the rain had stopped for a long time, and all of a sudden, FWOOSH, it came
  down in SHEETS, and sheets, and sheets... it was complete hell. We would
  go outside every once in awhile just to hear my mom yell "GET YOUR ASS BACK
  IN BED!" everytime we opened the front door. But it was coming down really
  bad, and when we were outside, admiring the new flash flood that was here,
  i had to relieve myself... good thing the water all went down the storm
  drains before anyone woke up the next morning to drive to work in the lake..
  Hehe..

    Welp.. it's still raining a little bit, and the flow outside quit for a
  little bit, so we're waiting... there's supposed to be some flash floods and
  mudslides today, but it looks a little unlikely from where I am... welll..
  you never know...

    Here's hoping for no school.... =]
