                        Magic : The Gathering
                        ---------------------

   Have you seen those little cards that people are freaking over? daaamn..
   i have a set of my own, and i writing the previous TYME text, i looked at
   the thing and think 'hey, why don't i do one soley on magic?' it works...
     I know these few kids who are freaks. One dudes name is Gian (pronounced
   'jon') and another is andreas. they're both really cool people but they are
   addicted... no, lets say 'OBSESSED' with this game. damn. i saw it for the
   first time while i was still a freshman (high school) but now i'm a soph-
   more and that game is still going. i play, but i don't collect., and re-
   cently i have been collecting just for art. i love the art on these cards.
   i don't really care about condition or play value, just whatever looks good
   like this one card that power rat is flipping about, it's called Lord of
   the Pit, and it's a great card, valuewise, playvaluewise, and astheticlly,
   ya know? it has this cool looking red demon type thing on it and he's
   hunched over this pit thing and it looks really great. i commend the artist
   for he great work. some of the other cards are good, too. like this one
   called Eater of the Dead, that looks like a big dog that is represented as
   the devil or something... several more like Deathlace and Demonic Tutor
   have exceptionally good artwork. i wish i was as good as those...
   anyway, it's also a little more expensive then what i can handle. that
   bugs me.. baseball cards for maybe less the a buck for 10-15 of them, but
   a magic booster is 3 bucks for 15 cards.. a pack of playing cards, 52 cards
   total would be maybe 5-6 dollars, magic starter deck with 60 cards and a
   rulebook = $8.00.. is this wrong to anyone else? it is to me. it shouldn't
   blow every dime a kid has, just his leftover cash, maybe a buck or two.
   i've had times where i walk in and i was (get this) TWO CENTS short and
   the bitch at the counter wouldn't even spot me. whore.
     these cards are cool, but i wouldn't recommend them as an investment...
   seems more and more people are quitting... not my problem. i'm selling my
   deck and pulling out of the magic business for good.
