                             A Pain In The Back
                             ------------------

    Can anyone guess what this particular issue is going to be about? Me and
  Sakima just recently fucked up both of our backs, and I can say it sure as
  hell ain't no picnic. I can hardly move, and you should see him try to walk.
  Hehe. It's kind of a bustup, but if you saw how we both got messed, you'd
  quit laughing.
    
    I was playing football with Power Rat, Rerun, Vect0r 0, and about 12 other
  people who are not members of the BBS community, and this one dude, a friend
  of Paco's (Rerun's brother) took me down HARD. I landed on my hip. I think
  I must have hit a rock or something cuz I heard a really loud crack. Or
  something like that. A few plays later, I was taken down again. Matt (the
  guy who nailed me) was running towards me in order to tackle. Ow. I got hit
  so badly that I got my spine bent so far over to the side, and I couldn't
  walk forever, so now RatBoy thinks it's funny to call me 'Crutches'. Augh.
    From what I heard, Sakima fucked his up by participating in wrestling. And
  who says that school sports are safe? Not me! I hear he was trying to nail a
  guy and take him down, when his opponent took his down backwards and he
  landed on his head. Completely compressed his spine, I suppose. So he's out
  of it for three weeks (two now) and i'm out of it for maybe 3 or four days
  to a week. I'm not that badly hurt, but I have a helluva tyme trying to get
  up in the morning.
    
    Speaking of injuries.. i'm gonna tell a little story that i'm sure a lot
  of you will laugh at. It takes place in fourth grade, and I'm sure Stewart
  knows immediatly what i'm talking about. =]
    I was late for school, and it was 'library day', meaning that all library
  books could only be checked out and returned on that day. I remember it was
  a Thursday, too. So here I am, closing the garage door, and I forgot my book
  in the house. Whoops. So I run back in to get it, and it's just setting on
  the table next to the door leading to the garage. Well, the front door needs
  to be locked every damn day, so I had to run out of the garage before it
  slammed shut. And ours doesn't have the springback thing where when some-
  thing gets in the way, it goes back up. Nope. So I was running at the door,
  and naturally the stupidest thing I could have done I did. I tried sliding
  underneath it. Oh, bravo, right? Yeah. It hurts. The thing clamped down on
  my right leg so hard it felt like a m'f'in shark was chewing on me. And the
  door itself had also managed to snag my side. So I have a gash on my left
  side, dripping blood, while i'm screaming the shit outta myself trying to
  get someones attention. It took a half of a fucking hour before some bozo
  showed up and tried to get me out. So the fire department comes and pries
  up the door, and by this time, i'm only half consious.
    The rest is a little hazy, but I did have to use crutches for two days.
  Yay...

  Moral: Don't listen to me while i'm bored in class.
