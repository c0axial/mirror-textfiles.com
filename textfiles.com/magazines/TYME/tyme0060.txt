                        Pot Smoking Ettiquete
                        \=-----------------=/

        Hey all, Blindspot here. Just decided to write this little handbook
out for all those pot smoker's like us in 《 beif (it's a club). Basically
people, there are too many fuckers we burn it with that don't know the 
proper ettiquete. And some people get pissed off when people don't follow
it, cause it's pretty damn rude.
Let's start, shall we.

1. The person who paid for the sack generally has legislation on first hit
   if that person requests so. If not, hits are "called" off, someone might
   say, "1st!" and they would get first hit(the sweetest hit of the bowl, 
   it's like candy, i swear.) If the owner wanted first, the one who yelled
   "1st" would be 2nd, and so on down the line.

2. When smoking, smoke in circles, usually clockwise. Keep your position, and 
   if you realize you're going to get last or second to last before the bowl
   starts, don't jump around so that you get second or third. Just go, you'll
   get your turn.

3. Do NOT fucking hold the pipe or joint or whatever in your hand after your
   hit. If you stand there and look at it while precious smoke is floating
   away, you are being a fuck, and the owner can skip you next time around.

4. Important. Smoking pot is only fun when you are with a friend. If someone
   gets so stoned they can't finish the bowl, and forces the others to smoke
   the rest themselves, the circle has the right to KICK THAT PERSON'S ASS.

5. Don't whine about not being stoned, the only reason the owner is kicking 
   down is so YOU have a good time. I tend to get pissed when i am baked off
   my ass and my friend isn't. (or he just want's more.)

6. Double hitting is probably the worst thing you can do. If I have a bowl
   I packed, and someone takes too hits, i will call them out of the circle
   for the rest of it. It irks me. Less smoke for the rest of us. The only
   person with ANY legal right to double hit without asking is the owner of
   the sack. If you do happen to want a double hit, ASK THE ENTIRE CIRCLE if
   it's okay. If one person says no, don't persue it, then you're being an
   asshole.

7. Now I have a problem with this sometimes, but dont NIGGER LIP. It's 
   sick. That's it. If you niggerlip, you die. Or else everyone else has a
   major fit.

8. Don't call up someone and ask if they'll smoke you out. Most of the time
   all that will get you is a yelling-at. If the person is there, and you're
   cool with them, you prolly won't have to ask. None of 《 beif asks one
   another, we all kick down to each other willingly.. well, there are some
   of us.. (COUGHCOUGHNIGGERDOGCOUGH)

9. If the group decides to quit in the middle of the bowl, (that's if EVERY-
   ONE decides to quit, refer to #6), then if it's not your bud, don't ask
   to keep the leftovers. It's not yours and you have no right to ask.

10. Don't smoke out a group of people or even one person and leave right
    after. What's the fun of smoking out together if you can't hang around
    and be stoned together?

11. Stealing bud from one of your friends IS AN ABSOLUTE NO-NO. If you even
    mention to someone that you stole bud from one of your smoking buddies,
    you are gonna be in a heapload of shit. (now as for people who AREN'T
    your friends... well...)

12. People will never know you're fucked up unless you let them know. Whether
    you tell them, have someone else tell them, or just act like a general
    stoned-off-your-ass idiot, nobody will know, unless you want them to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some general precautions before going out and getting fucked up:

1. Visine. Make sure you have visine if you are going to be around people who
   would have a problem with it. If they see red eyes, stereotypes usually say
   that anyone with redeye is stoned and therefore a bad person. We aren't bad
   people, we just like to enjoy ourselves.

2. Food. You. Need. Food. Or money to buy food. Or else everyone is gonna be
   a real asshole to each other because they gots the munchies.

3. Cigarettes. You. Need. Smokes. If anyone in your group smokes and you have
   them, run. You're gonna want them too and most likely people will kill for
   a smoke after burning a nice bowl of fat kind bud. I know I would.. =)
   Don't ever go out and burn it without smokes. You fiend. I fiend. We all
   fiend and we will KILL.

    Welp, this text was started by BlindSpot and finished by vYrus, BS, Viper,
  and Deadly Toke. Aside from a few interruptions from someone's mom, it all
  went pretty well. So follow these guidelines and maybe someday, you too, can
  burn it with 《 beif. =)
