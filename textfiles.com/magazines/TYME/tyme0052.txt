    As I am sitting here on an ACiD conference, recovering from a bad case
  of burnout, my mind is wandering off to the little place i retreat to when
  i am too badly stoned. In fact, i am having problems typing this t-file
  right now.
    
    One thing i was thinking about was a really nasty joke someone played on
  me on irc today.. There is this chick down in San Diego whose nick is
  Penguin, and me and her seemed to hit it off pretty damn well. Everytime
  i have a method, i call her. Boom. No problem. Today, on irc, this dude
  named Crisis msgs me and says "Penguin was great last night" and he just
  went on and on about all this shit. About how he and Penguin were now
  together. (btw, i can swear to god i can taste pot in the back of my
  throat.) Scared the crap out of me. Normally, i wouldn't give much of a
  shit, but i kind of have fallen for Penguin. Which might be dumb of me,
  which might not be. I dunno. But when Crisis started talking the way he
  was, i found myself getting pretty fucking upset.
    
    ANYWAY... enough of that... i hate my father. He is a hypocrite and he
  is incredibly opinionated. Reminds me just a little bit of Soultaker and/or
  RaD_Man of ACiD... (JUST KIDDING%@^&!*).. Penguin sent me a picture, and
  he fucking picked it up and started making smartass comments. None of which
  i can remember, being stoned and all, but i do know that i got particularly
  mad about something at him.
    
    The internet sucks! Nobody get an internet acct. It's lame. It's worth-
  less. Nobody needs to desperatly get on the 'net. The only reasons i can
  think of is possibly to use the World Wide Web. Or ftp. Or some shit. But
  I would definatly tell you to stay the fuck off IRC. It's worthless. The
  ansi scene sucks, the aYCHpEE scene sucks, the warez scene sucks. These
  are the more popular of the "scenes" and i would definatly say they all
  really suck dick.
    
    Mind Wanderings: Why am i here... why am i here to put up with shit from
  people, and why do i let them? Doesn't seem to fair to me. But hey, as
  everyone and anyone is gonna tell me, "LIFE AIN'T FAIR". Yeah, well, fuck
  you very much. I don't give a fuck. I'm rambling right now, and the music
  on the radio sucks, and these fools on the conf are babbling about local
  BBS's... local to THEM, kindly.

    Well. I know all you locals are going to laugh at me, but i quit ACiD.
  Muhahahhaa@#$!! Fuck me. I never made a deal of it, and this is exactly
  why i didn't. I knew it would come to an end. OH! Let me tell you about a
  wonderful little call i get from "that founder guy". (coughcough)

    I am stoned. (This has become a daily thing, almost. woo.) I am leaving
  to go light some more. The phone rings. On it, are rM, Sinned Soul, and
  Soultaker. A few things i remember are rM giving me some nice threat.

    "Hey, are you handicapped?"
    "No... why?"
    "Would you like to be?"

    At this, i frowned. rM is not normally a dick. But hell. Out of line.
  Big fucking deal... i dunna care. It overwith now. And all of you who
  read TYME, inform any ld board that i am on and you are on that i have
  quit. I still call some boards and see some variation of "ACiD, 707,
  t3l3c0m d00d" etc. as my user note.

    Music... what baout music... let me tell you about music. I have recently
  started taking an intrest in industrial or techno-style. Loud, digitized,
  synth shit. I love that shit. Nine Inch Nails is also a favorite of mine.
  Trent sings elite shit.

    Well, Soultaker has gone to bed, leaving his phone off the hook, and
  Penguin and I are the only ones left on the conf, so i suppose that i will
  talk to her for a little bit. Lates..

  (btw, if you wonder why TYME doesn't release as often as we did, it's
  because i am paying an extraneous amount of attention to Penguin. =] )
