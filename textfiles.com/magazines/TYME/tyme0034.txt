                        Parents Can Fuck Off 2

        Hey all, though i'd give you taste of someone elses writing besides
vYrus(not that it doesnt kick ass!) Anyway, me, vYrus, and four other chicks
and some dude i just met had a bar b que at the neighborhood earlier today.
Basically this is gonna be about how the kind of SHIT parents can give you.
Ok here's the story:
                Ok, i ride homw from school, stop at Kaynar's house(you 
havent met him yet) and pick up a mike, and fuck up his computer. I get home
and vYrus is fuckin with the bbs....so we play around with the board for a
while...then Kaynar calls up and WHINES about how he wants me to fix his
computer. so i binary split QEMM 7.5 and Desqview and put it on disk.As
I'm copying, my mom says she wants me to go to church(which i HATE) and I
just kinda go "yeah, ok mom, whatever" and tell her ill go with vYrus tonite.

        So vYrus and i ride off to Kaynars and drop off the disks. On the way
we met up with these chicks we know and they invite us to thier BBQ so we 
say shure.....but we had to be back by six. WE end up running to Ranch Market
for these chick THREE FUCKING TIMES because they forget to tell us what to 
pick up. So i start cooking the food after LIGHTING THE FIRE YESS!!! and then
this girl named kelly grabs the marshmallows and hides the bag between her
tits and syas that we cant have them. great. So we eat hot dogs that taste 
like lighter fluid while we get the marshmallows warmed up be kelly's tits,
(which isnt half bad). vYrus hangs out with this chick all nite, shes pretty
cool....and we have a pretty cool time. Then vYrus and i start playin in the
fire. we poured about a quart of lighter fluid on the coals and whooosh. it
was cool. So then its about time to leave after a nite of butt sqeezin(GIRLS,
NAPALM and all the other faggots readin this) and vYrus and i piss the fire
out. I never knew piss smelled SOOOO bad when burned. we walked home.

Then my parents get home and vYrusm me, and some chick are at my house and
my mom comes in and yells" I spent a half hour looking for you and YOU MISSED
YOUTHGROUP!!!!" I think who gives a fuck. I didnt have to go in the first 
place. vYrus had planned to spend the night, but my mom was being such a 
bitch she took me in the back room and gave me a 10,000 questions about vYrus
because SHE thinks hes all fucked up. "DOES HE SMOKE DOPE?" "DOES HE DRINK
BOOZE" "ARE YYOU GUYS GONNA FIGHT WITH VIPER?" and i just wanna yell at the
top of my lungs "SHUT UP YOU FUCKING BITCH." anyway, viper acts like a jerk
to my mom, and then she changes her mind, then she says he can, and then he
cant, bla bla bla. PARENTS SUCK. And then my dad yells at me, "IF YOU DONT
DO YOUR DISHES IM TAKING AWAY YOUR COMPUTER" great. just what i need in 
my life. Anyway, if i seem like im acting like a jerk when you talk with me
on Total Anarchy, sorry, i just got a lot of pressure on my life now. 
thank you for listening to me bitch. goodnite.
