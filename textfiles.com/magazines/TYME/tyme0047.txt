                          Delayed Reactions
        
        I recently discovered my favorite plant which has been around for
an awful long time, and I am sure you have heard of this before. MARIJUANA!
YeS! Like everytime I ever smoked it I didn't feel shit except for the little
high you get just from smoke being in your system. So anyway, I got some FAT
green bud from Nekrosyne's big bro. Anyway, the night I got the dank I went
outside to my backyard, figured I would smoke a bowl. I smoked it, and didn't
feel shit. That is very strange. I have heard of people who don't get stoned
the first time they smoke weed, but this must have been like my fourth time
and i had not felt any major stonation going on. I was a tad dissed, but oh
well, i figured maybe my body was immune to THC or something. Then easter 
rolled around, so i decided to celebrate...I pulled out the pot and packed a 
bowl. Nekrosyne and I went down to the park, and I toked that shit for about
10 mintues. I must have smoked a bowl and a half. I started walkin home, 
dissapointed AGAIN....there has been so many times I smoked weed and had to 
actually FAKE like i felt something. 1) At the VEA (Vintage Experimental Area)
2) At vYrus's house the night Vect0r 0(Drag0n X for all you Xenodorks ð]),
3) With my cousin Matt, 4) Outside my house....so I guess you could say
I wasn't gonna be spending my life savings on this stuff anymore. I got 
back home and Nek started fucking around with the board, while I just sat
there in my chair staring at a poster of a chick in her underwear(Neriah 
Davis?) when all of the sudden I turned my head and WHOOOOOOOSH, i realized
that I was FUCKED up. I was off my ass completely, but the weird thing about
being stoned is you are perfectly concious the whole time, and it doesn't
alter your thoughts that much. You get *very* paranoid that someone is
gonna see your eyes(by the way, my pupils enveloped my whole eyes) or 
someone will notice you are acting strangely. The feeling is almost 
indescribable....let's see, it is like you feel all warm and every few secs
your brain and muscles seem to tingle and "buzz" (hah) and you feel so
happy, it is like the best feeling in the world. What scares ME is that I 
will get hooked on it and I will be spending all my cash on it and then
getting all stupid from killing brain cells. I AM aware of the dangers. What
REALLY sucks is that someone saw me smoking it, and it just happened to be a 
lady who works with my mom. Wonderful. So then I got a lecture from mommy
about how I don't need that stuff and shit. Anyway, I am currently waiting
for Nek's bro to bring me a 20 sack....ROCK! If you are scared into never
trying it because or D.A.R.E. (Drugs Are Really Expensive) don't worry about
it. If you smoke, and cigarettes control you, I mean you have an actual
addiction, I don't recommend smoking buds becuase then you could get hooked.
Bascially you have to CONTROL yourself. I know most of you dudes out there 
are hella elite(ha) and have already smoked it, but for people who DID smoke
it, and didnt get anything out of it, try it again! Just keep going...You
will definatly feel it when you are stoned. Peace be with you all, this has
been just another T.Y.M.E....anybody needs weed, leave me a message on my bbs
I can get it to ya for cheap. Later.
