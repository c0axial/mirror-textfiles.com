                            When Are You Too Old?
                            ---------------------

    Well, last night *I* went out trick-or-treating with about eight or nine
  other people. Four of them were TYME members. So we had a bit to talk about,
  like who's gonna get their butt in gear and write a couple more texts, who's
  going out with who, who's done whatever with who, etc.. It went pretty well,
  considering every third door had an old lady in it who just HAD to make the
  same comment over and over. "Aren't you guys a little old for this?" Okay,
  here, four of us were sixteen, three of us were fifteen, three of us were
  fourteen, and one of us was thirteen (which happened to be my little sister,
  btw..). 
    So which ones of us were too old? If any old fart were reading this
  file, then he would say prolly everyone. If a teenager willing to have fun
  in his/her life, he would say none of us are too old to have fun. Very true.
  So why do adults have to even try to cut us off from the things we did when
  we were younger? Holy shit, man, two guys who had to be at least 19 were
  going around! Sure, they weren't wearing costumes or nuthin, but the looks
  on their face plainly said "We just want the candy, go to hell." So we left
  them alone.
    WE, on the other hand, were al dressed up except for maybe two of us. 
  Sakima was wearing just solid black, so I don't know if you can call that a
  costume or not. Another girl, Shelly, was wearing a flannel. Nothing really
  special, but her cousin... oh my god, her COUSIN was wearing this blue dress
  type thing and a wig that went to her ankles. Rapunzel I suppose. Twelve
  Guage was wearing just a t-shirt and a bunch of face paint. White face,
  black eyebrows, black lips. Very original, wouldn't you say?
    Matrix was wearing this black robe type thing, he was supposed to be Death
  but later that night he removed the mask and wore this headband so he could
  just be weird. =] Stewart was wearing an outfit we threw together for him in
  about three minutes. It consisted of a black and blonde wig, a hat, and
  blood running down his arms and face. We decided he was a cannibal. Hehe..
    S0l0mn was this rich dude. Black trench coat, cane, and black fedora. It
  looked pretty good, I must admit. Athena was wearing this jester outfit that
  she had borrowed from one of my mom's friends. Naturally, my sister went
  as the same damned thing. Argh.
    The Wretched went as Robin Hood. He was looking okay, but he was making
  the absolute WORST jokes I had ever heard. Gz... Sakima's girlfriend went
  as a slutty widow. Quote. She called herself a slutty widow, and I couldn't
  help busting up.
    I went as Dracula. It worked, except that the cape was getting a little
  too damn hot for me. Arrrgh,,,
    That covers us all, and it was a hell of a night. But still, every other
  door was the question: "Aren't you a little old for this?" after we would
  yell trickortreat, and pretty soon we got so sick of listening to the damn
  adults, soon after we rang the doorbell, all we did was hold out the bags,
  waiting for them to dump the cheapshit candy they had bought this year in
  the bag.
    Another thing that adults always question in age, is if you want to go to
  the local park. Now what the hell is wrong with that? Me and the guys would
  go there every fucking day during the summer. We still go there. We all live
  within several houses of each other, so we just pull up our stuff and take
  off for some basketball, or some football, or some running around, or we
  just plop down on the grass and talk for a bit. It works... =]
    The last thing i want to talk (complain?) about in the age field would
  have to be amusement parks. My GOD i hate it there. The ride attendents
  will look you up and down, and direct you towards the sign that says "You
  must be under this height to ride (suchandsuch) Ride." Of course, being six
  feet tall, i can't get in to any goddamn rides except for the ones meant for
  the adults. Naturally. They want to heap responsibilities on my ass, I tell
  them to shove it up their asses. You're only young once, make the best of
  it.

      I'm sure trying.

                                               vùrÅs
