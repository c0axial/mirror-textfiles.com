Timeless.............................

Boredom is timeless..................

My,  what a fuck of a day............

Not nearly as bad as the day in OK...

        Why did that happen?  what can bring out such cowardice...such
melovolent feelings to kill some many innocent children and many possibly
not-so-innocent adults?    

Insanity will set you free...........

        Will it really though?  Will insanity ever truly give us an answer?
Babbling....within sanity is found the insanity of believing chaos is order,
and order chaos.

The soul is a flame forever burning..

        Am I the only one who feels we are being extinguished...by the 
society that seeks to rob us of our rights,  our minds,  our souls?  who else
is tired to do-this do-that?  It's one thing if it is to help us,  TRULY help
us,  but a lesson learned the easy way is a lesson not learned...

Hahahah..............................

        Stupid,  dumbass world....i feel like nothing the way i am writing 
this...sorry nothing,  if i'm leaching yer style here or something.

Satanic youth........................

        That's what we are,  rebelious.  We are tired of being held down by
a power that really isn't there.  All power our parents have over us is
completely figurative.  They only have the power we allow them.....vYrus has
tested this one a few times.........oh ya,  vY i found something you might 
wanna see.

If i'm boring you sorry..............

        I'm sick...tired...and i feel stoned although a J hasn't passed 
near me in a while...  shit.

Parents gone.........................

        Not gonna be home till 11:30 - 12:00....  lucky me.  PARTY!!!!  ya
right.  party my left ass cheek.  i'd fall asleep by ten.....  aphrodesia
insense....  heheheh.  (if you don't understand that one yer lame)

I hope i'm not taking up much time...

        Shit,  we dont' have much of it....  just a lowly 80 years...maybe
longer,  if we're carefull.  likely none of us will lve to see 80.  not with
AIDS,  smoking,  drugs,  alcohol,  and women drivers....
