  Welp, I logged onto Wulf's Den after I finished the other text. Great. Just
  as I thought. The one from Disorder kinda got to me. This one:

I wonder why you didn't respond to this?

I don't want to turn this into a war between text groups, but I really don't 
see why you complain that F.U.C.K. is too serious, yet read them each time 
they come out. If you have read all 100 you would know that not all of them 
are serious. There is a decent amount of humor in a few, rants about various 
things that aren't too serious, anthology segments which aren't 'serious' 
usually, etc.

Also, if you don't like the fact that the group is too serious, why blatantly 
rip the format, header appearance, style, and everything else from it? Is that
your way of saying you like the zine that much(ie: imitation=flattery or 
whatever)?

  Okay, he has a point. I won't argue with this. But to call it a blatent
  ripoff? Who else has read FUCK texts? WHO ELSE think TYME is a ripoff of
  FUCK? From what I see here in 7o7, TYME is VERY successful. I see no
  problems whatsoever with it... but check THIS out:

Vy> i don't CARE what you think. i never asked you.

So what is the point of putting out a text if it has no reason to it?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Do they really need reasons? You show me the texts that don't have reasons
  for being printed, and i'll show you some FUCK texts that don't have
  reasons! Car Sniglets, what's the reason for that? Family Trip? Huh?

    Hohoho.  Maybe you should listen to your readers.  Have you read the FUCK 
file called Originality (#95 - Rage).  Maybe you should copy that one too.

Silent Rain

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Fuckin gimp. Who has seen me COPY a FUCK file? I have reprinted ONE file,
  and it wasn't even a FUCK text! It was cDc and I gave full credit to the
  authors. So there. (pthhbb)
  So here is my reply to Silent Rain, with my reply to Disorder right after
  it.

okay, let me see if i can explain myself here...
i HAVE read all 100 (i consistantly mention that) and at least 90% are 
extremely serious. i am a little more relaxed then that, and i enjoy texts 
with alittle more humor. so when i say they're too damn serious, i just said 
that out of anger. i love fuck, but i alos like to write for myself. hence, 
TYME. and the anothoglogies i try to pass over, and i especially like the 
tagline one, so i do know what i'm talkig about.

the people of fuck SHOULD consider it flattery. i do not base the headers and 
footers on fuck, i tried to make them as differnet as possible without 
actually going overboard. i can change them if you want to sue me for 
copyright infringement, but these wars ARE going into another TYME text... 
just for the hell of it. i write because i get bored, or i have ideas, or i 
want to complain. they're not intended to provoke negetive reactions, just for
people to enjoy. if they don't enjoy them and they don't plan on making a 
serious statement then THEY SHOULDN'T READ THE DAMN FILES.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I am getting really annoyed with these people. If anyone wants to help me
  stand up for TYME, please call Wulf's Den at 1-303-699-9853 and argue with
  Disorder and Silent Rain and anyone else you see flaming TYME. Tell them
  what you think of it, and explain 7o7 people read them always. PLEASE...
