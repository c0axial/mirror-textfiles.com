*** Pinguino (Joyce@hilife.cts.com) has joined channel #haze
<vYrus> hawr rawr
<Pinguino> This is an interview
<vYrus> very observant. =]
<Pinguino> everything you say can and will be used against you
<vYrus> no problem.
<Pinguino> what is the name you go by?
<vYrus> my real name or my nick?
<Pinguino> the name people would call you if they called you on the phone
<vYrus> billy joe bob the buttlover.
<vYrus> no.. seriously..
<Pinguino> Give your adoring audience your ansi scene history
<vYrus> i used to do warez when i first got on the net, and then i missed out
        on a few days, and i came back and everyone was being assholes, so i
        started hangong out in #ansi... i was in nimbus as a lit writer for a
        little while until they died, then i just
<vYrus> kind of bopped around, and set up confs for people, and so acid invited
        me in as telecom.
<Pinguino> cool..
<vYrus> afterthat, a bunch of groups invited me. but i stuck with acid.
<vYrus> for some stupid reason. =]
<Pinguino> what do you think of people who fall asleep on the phone and snore?
<vYrus> i think they should be dragged awake and shot.
<Pinguino> hehe liar
<vYrus> what? seriously.
<Pinguino> :P ok what would you do if someone served you a disk of spam
           and green eggs?
<vYrus> a disk? i would pop it in the disk drive and attempt to play it.
<Pinguino> disk=dish
<vYrus> ah.
<Pinguino> im tired
<Pinguino> can ya tell?
<vYrus> i would revel in the spam, let it melt along my tongue, and shove
        the eggs up my left nostril, and dance around my living room
        singing jhnny b. goode.
<Pinguino> hehe you're outta school. what are you going to do next with
           your life?
<vYrus> sleep for a really long time.
<vYrus> then i'm gonna go to the junior college ad take computer science
        courses.
<vYrus> and get a job, and move out.
<Pinguino> same here. =) What's your life dream if you could do/be/have
           anything you want?
<Pinguino> What kind of job?
<vYrus> do: start my own company, makes lots of money, and never worry about
        anything ever again.  be: a millionaire  have: you.
<vYrus> any kind of job. i should be doing stuff with a local cpu store
        called PC Solutions
<Pinguino> are you allowed to flirt with the interviewer?
<vYrus> does the interviewer permit me to?
<Pinguino> you're the editor. Editors are gods. they do what they want. they
           have the blue pen.
<vYrus> rawr.
<vYrus> i'm keeping this intact and letting YOU edit it.
<vYrus> i just realse the damn things. =]
<Pinguino> does the ansi scene influence your career goals in any way, shape,
           or form?
<vYrus> it gives me a distraction when i'm mad at life.
<Pinguino> why do you have a capitalized Y in your nick all the time?
<vYrus> other then that, ansi people introduced me to confs, which introduced
        me to fones.. and so forth.
<vYrus> for emphasis. and because my ex told me it looked like a dick and it
        annoyed her. =]
<Pinguino> hehe
<Pinguino> what were you doing july 10, 1983?
<vYrus> sucking my thumb and watching sesme street.
<Pinguino> heheeh how many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center
           of a tootsie pop?
<vYrus> i don't know. ask mister owl.
<Pinguino> Do you think you were a dog in your former life?
<vYrus> actually, i thin ki was elvis. but i never proved that, so the theory
        went down the drain.
<Pinguino> are you very good at singing elvis songs? do you annoy people that
           way?
<vYrus> i can sing elvis in a moderate way, but anything wildy oustanding. and
        i have never tried to annoy people iwh tit..
<Pinguino> do you think your other songs, like the warez wheels on the bus one,
           annoy people?
<vYrus> hey, that warez on the bus song is MINE.
<vYrus> and that was also the sole reason they were created.. to annoy people.
<Pinguino> hehe is moshing a sport?
<vYrus> of course.
<vYrus> but FINGER PAINTING.. now THATS a sport.
<Pinguino> shoudl you have to get a blue athletic card at school for finger
           painting, since you need one for academic league?
<vYrus> whats that mean?
<Pinguino> should you get a physical before you're allowed to fingerpaint?
<vYrus> next question
* vYrus missed his physical for the fingerpainting course.
<Pinguino> uhh.. why do you like playing questions with Penguin?
<vYrus> because we have to struggle to think up new questions, and that's
        the only excersize my brains gets at night.
<Pinguino> How many brain cell (s) do you have?
<vYrus> not enough.
<Pinguino> do you have an ego?
<vYrus> a what?
<Pinguino> What do you think of op wars (remider: you participate)
<vYrus> i never do any actual opping or deopping, i just like to play
        with the channel topic
