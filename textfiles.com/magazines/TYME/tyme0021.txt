                                Dreaming..
                                ----------

    Okay, I actually remember one of my dreams from last night. But it was
  like, really fucked up. All I can remember is wandering around a field with  
  all the people i've ever known in my life around me, doing what they do
  best. Like Stewart was playing his horn for the high school band, and Sakima
  had on robes and was holding some kind of book with these wierd symbols all
  over it. Crazy. And I was just, AROUND.. not like, mixing with anyone, but I
  was just kind of taking a look around, and people weren't seeing me. I was
  trying to attract anybody's attention, and there's this vague part about
  girls, and another vague part about Power Rat and Rerun coming to get me,
  and when i went to spend the weekend there, like I sometimes do, I had to
  sleep in a basement type thing and try not to get caught by Rat's parents.
  I was running away from my mother (of all people) and I was doing what I do
  best in dreams; flying.
    I've always been good at flying in dreams, I can do it damn well whenever
  I want, and it's gotten easier. So when my mom got too close, I would JUMP
  really high, and i would start flying. The only thing I need to work on is
  staying up there. I can take off and land real well, but i can't stay up for
  more then a little bit. Which sucks, because it's the best feeling, even if
  it's only a dream.
    I also somehow appeared in another body, of a gangsta, (for some damnodd
  reason..) and I was admitting to giving up the gang life. I only remember a
  few things about it, as in it was in Ranch Market (of all places), and I was
  crying a bit, and I remember the phrase 'XIV' being used by both of us. A
  friend was holding on to me, and two guys were kind of interrogating me.
  Huh.
    The last (and definately most bizaare) part would have to be near the end.
  Some people were trying to run me over! It was real dark, and I was running
  like my life depended on it (which it was), and a little BMW came peeling
  straight towards me. I had no time to get out of the way, so I JUMPED over
  the fucker, and landed without a scratch. However, the truck behind it gave
  me no time to jump again or move out of the way, so it slammed into me head
  on. I was flattened against the front bumper, unable to move, and the driver
  was still going. I managed to roll myself off to the side, and then I lied
  down, exhausted, when the truck began rolling in reverse. I put my feet up
  to catch the tailgate, right before realizing this fucking truck is the same
  color as the one Rerun owns...

    I woke up.

    Dreams are strange...
