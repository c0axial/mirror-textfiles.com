                      Memories Best Left Forgotten
                      \=------------------------=/

  This was a letter i had written to one of my old ex girlfriends. I really
  cared about her, but she dumped me on my ass. The original letter was two
  written pages long, but i'm not sure how long it will be here.

  Dear Les:

    These are going to sound really corny, but they're all little 
  pieces of sentences i've always wanted to say to you:

    "Thinking about you always makes me feel better when i'm down...
  Feeling the soft touch of you hand against mine makes hy heart
  flutter in a way that can only be love... Just seeing your face
  near me brings up a deep, primal feeling of protection, protection
  for my heart, a protection only you can provide.. Just holding you
  in my arms and feeling your heart beat in sync with mine
  tells me we were meant for each other... I've known there
  was something meant to happen between us when i first spoke to you...
  That something has happened: we have fallen into a deep and soulful
  love for each other, we each never want to part with the other...
  We are fragmented souls looking for the matching piece of
  ourselves... and we have found the missing piece... it was love...
  it had never surfaced for us to find because no-one special
  has helped i surface for me... You have brought the missing section
  of my soul into view... for me to grasp and hold in my arms...
  as i hold the missing part of my life... the soft, glowing rays
  of the large piece of eternal wisdom slowly melts, and reshapes...
  into long, wavy hair... the lower half turns into solid flesh, and
  i feel a live heart thumping against my chest and a
  warm breath blowing across my neck... i draw the now living
  being away and look at it's shining blue eyes; the color of
  the sky on an exceptionally clear day... the captivating eyes
  look at mine with an image of caring, of tenderness... I
  survey the rest of the face before me... the high cheekbones,
  the face of one who has been through much and experienced
  little... your face. you silently raise one hand and brush
  a place on my cheek.. bringing your hand away, i
  notice a glistening drop on it, a tear. I have been crying
  in happiness from finding the one i want to be with. You.
  As i look into your eyes, a change comes over them, from a
  look of sorrow and pain to one of relief and joyfulness.
  As a tear runs down your cheek and you smile unsteadily,
  I let a tear from my eye run on to my finger. You
  do the same, and we slowly bring our hand together. As
  the drops of emotion from each of us connect, a hiss and
  a flash reveal something suspended in air: a sparkling,
  teardrop diamond. The drop glows with a source of un-
  indentifiable power, and slowly circling us, it releases hair-thin
  bands of blue light. The light winds tighter and draws us
  together... we are pressed together, yet there is no discomfort,
  as if we were molded into each other. This line draws us a
  little closer and by now, tears are spilling down
  our cheeks, each creating a gem where they land on the ground.
  I carefully wrap my arms around you, and squeeze gently.
  The muffled sobs are enough to crack a normal person's heart, but
  i know the tears mean nothing but love. My own drop
  are running down in torrents, as i hug you, and the bands of light form
  an impenatrable barrier.
    "Now we are together," I whisper softly, "Forever." You say nothing,
  still shaking. A muffled noise soon comes from your mouth and as
  i draw you away, your eyes are shining as you repeat what you
  had spoken.
    "I love you."

    This is weird, Les. But i'm crying as i write this. I have
  never written anything full as emotion like this. I hope you
  understand. I love you, Lesley. Always. And forever.

                         -E.N.

  E.N. being my first name and middle name. That was a sign of trust between
  the two of us, using our middle names. Bah. Some trust. Two days after
  Valentine's Day, she dumped me on my ass.
  
  Fuck them women, they got no respect for us men.

  Jesus Christ.

  God help us all.
