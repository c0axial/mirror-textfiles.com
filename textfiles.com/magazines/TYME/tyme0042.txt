			   The Strength of Love
			   \=----------------=/

 As I was just going to see if steph wanted to go to the basket ball courts,
 Her door was unlocked.I knockedm first but nothing,no alarm,silence until I 
 heard a scream.All my fear andf anxioties filled me.I went in.no 1 was home.
 I stared upstair and I heard a crash in stephs room and the door was shut.I 
 ran upstairs and put my ear to her door.I heard a struggle but I made sure 
 to be sure;its not nice to barg in on something.I opened the door to hell.
 Robert was sit on top of half nude steph holding her down and hitting  her.
 She was tied to the bed sumhow and her bra was ripped.He was hitting to her.
 she was practially unconicous.I jumped on him and swung hard into his back.
 I knew I had to get him towards the stairs 4 the win.he tripped and got offa 
 steph and on to the ground his pants were unzipped and he grabbed my legs and 
 tripped me into steph's dressor and I hit my head pretty good.I wrested with 
 him 4 a while until I hit his head against Luey's(Steph's fish) table.Luey's 
 Bowl fell and crash bingo on Roberts head sum blood but sum of the glass got 
 on me too.I got up and pushed robert out into the hall.he got up and slugged 
 me 1 in the stomach.I worked towards the hall.I got infront of the stairs 
 waiting for him to take a swing and then I'd dodge it but my reflex weren't 
 the best and I landed lucky on the upper stairs and rolled all the way down 
 on to the marble he almost came with me.this was the second time I had hit 
 my head.it was throbbing and I could barely see anything ,I was disorintented.
 He was still at the top recovering.I layed there the longest 10 sec of my 
 life wondering if it could be me last and then sum magicly forced pushed me 
 up and I ran up the stairs full power.I was amaze and so was robert 
 unexpecting it and I lowerd my head like a bull and I hit him in the groin so 
 hard he fell across the hall and hit his head on the wall blood splattered 
 and he was messed up.I grabbed him and rolled him down the stairs.He got up 
 and out the door so fast,I tripped down the stairs again landing on the 
 platform where the stairs turned.I wanting to go to sleep so bad.i was so 
 tired.I couldn't think straight after 10mins laying there.I gathered enough 
 will power to get up and help steph.I climb 2 stairs and felt very woozy and 
 threw up on the stairs.when I finally got to the top I saw a Knife at the 
 foot of the wall where all the blood was.It must of have been roberts.It 
 made me worry about steph and I limbed up to her room.There she was peaceful 
 and quiet.I got a sick feeling.I went over to the foot of the bed and untied 
 her arms and feet and I check her pulse,she was still alive probably in 
 shock.she was passed out.She had a black eye and she was barely breathing.I 
 got to the bottom of the bed and folded my hands and prayed 4 her and me.I 
 wasn't too good myself.I couldn't get off my knees.I started thinking about 
 what of happened.how robert came over and Y her parents were gone.I go over 
 all the time when her parents aren't there but they know me.I stayed on my 
 knees,folded hands,just thinking 4 it seem an a hour but was probably only 
 10-20mins.She stirred.I smiled but couldn't move.I managed to say "U owe 
 me." I wanted to say r u alright but was too distorted to think and she 
 started to cry and say "even".Then I asked if she was alright,long pause,she 
 didn't answer.I guess it was a stupid question.I managed to get up and grab 
 her a shirt outta her drawer and I zipped up her short jeans.I put the shirt 
 on her.she was in pain.I was too but I had too B strong.I was in a house 
 with bloody walls and broken glass and I was guilty 4 the mess.I said 
 "Welcome" and I picked up luey.he was in a broken semi sphere piece of 
 glass enough to hold sum water.he would be alright.I picked up what was 
 left of the fish bowl and filled it with sum water and put him back in.I 
 felt that was enough 4 the cleaning.I would never finish b4 her parents 
 got home.Her parents what they think? oh shit that made me wonder what 
 really happened but I was too tired and so was steph to talk.I got on the 
 bed next her her and held her in my arms.I figured I deserved that much.I 
 tryed to look 2 her 4 approval or disapproval but nothing.We fell asleep 4 
 at least an hour.all of sudden I was picked up and was slugged int he 
 stomach and thrown in the closest wall.He wait 4 me to respond but I was so 
 messed up I wanted him to do me in.Steph woke up and yelled told him to 
 stop.then all lot of shouting and I passed out.It was her dad.I woke up to 
 an ice pack.He wasn't sure what had happened but steph convinced him to not 
 hurt me anymore.He had herd what had happen b4 i got there but he or steph 
 didn't know about the fight.I was too out of it to think what to censor but 
 I told the hole thing the whole truth.I knew I shoulnd't have but I didn't 
 have the time to think.I think he brought it.He took us to the hospital and 
 he called my parents.Steph had 2 broken ribs and I had 1 broken rib and a 
 serious concousion.we were treated and released the same day.We went back to 
 her house.I was feeling much better.I didn't want to leave steph.I asked if 
 I could talked to her alone and her dad left.I asked her how she was.It was 
 strange.She answered.I had to ask this but I didn't want to "What happened?"
 She told me her parents left to go shopping and she invited him over w/o 
 them knowing and they were downstairs watching a movie and he put his arm 
 around her and basicly the moves.and after wards she said wanna go upstairs 
 like me and her do and play games and write letters and talk but he got the 
 wrong idea and when they got up there he put her on the bed and she pause 
 and started to cry I was numb "Did he?" the big question and she said "I 
 want to say no so bad but Yes he Raped me."A girls worst nightmare true.I 
 always knew girl had life just a bit harder than boys but this was totally 
 unfair.The next day I planned to go kill the bastard.I ahte him with all my 
 heart.I'd hated him b4 but now I hated with with everything I could.Steph 
 was bawling.I knew i should of said sumthing to comfort her but I was empty 
 and she started to cry even more.I knew it was bcuz I didn't comfort her.
 Ever since I became Best friends with her,I wanted to comfort her in her 
 time of need and I didn't.I felt hella bad.I opened my mouth to say anything 
 but was interupted as she said "Go Away" like a Time's Up buzzer in my head 
 and I knew the line was drawn.She now hated all boys including me.I started 
 to leave when my plan form perfectly.I turned around and said "R U sure?Do U 
 really want me to Leave?" and I sat down beside her.That was what she wanted 
 sumthing to showed I cared.I put my arm around her and she said "Yes".That 
 wasn't in the plan.I got up and left the room and leaned against the wall 
 not caring it was all bloody and I went back in to her room and sat down 
 next to her and said "All I ever wanted was to protect u and to keep you 
 safe and now this I let u down once and I'm not doing it again" and I said 
 it like a movie star struting his stuff like in the movies and I knew it was 
 kinda cliche but it worked she put her arms around me and I held her and 
 keeped telling her everything would be alright.Her dad yelled that he had to 
 go get her mom and He told me if anything happen while he was gonna he'd 
 kill me and he went in to his room and pulled out a gun to show that he was 
 very serious.I almost shitted my pants.I went back to steph who had stop 
 crying.I wrapped my arms around her again.she said "Thanx." I smiled and 
 said "anytime".She said "I love U" and I backed off.No way,thats totally 
 unfair.I fell in love with her already and she said she didn't like me and 
 just wanted to be friends.I don't know,but how could u use rape as an excuse 
 to fall in love.I'll take the prize of a hero but nothing more.I said "Y? O 
 all of sudden U can love me now?".she thought 4 a sec she said "I didn't 
 mean to say that it slipped.I...I...I did like u back then but I couldn't 
 let us become more then friends" and I interupted and said "Well I can't 
 let us become more then friends now." and we both stoped to think and I 
 realize that this was probably the end of our relationship;they'll probably 
 move away and we'll never see each other and even if they don't the courts 
 and her parents will stop us from being friends I thought.In the sileince I 
 said "I love u too." and I wish so much to B friends 4ever but If this was 
 the end I rather bemore then friends.Earlier we both tought being more than 
 friends would destroy the relationship but now the relationship was destroy 
 but we didn't destroy it.we might as well let our feeling take over instead 
 of our thoughts and with all this thinking a tear came to my eye.Steph shook 
 her head and I let go of our embrace and I grab her remote 4 her stereo and 
 I turned it on cd # 2 which I knew was boyz ][ men hit song 9 and ask her if 
 she would liked to dance.She had owed me a dance 4 a while actually I had 
 never danced with her.the whole 4 mins was amazing.it wasn't like at the 8th 
 grade te`e with all the light,I was in her bedroom with the broken glass and 
 the bloody wall but it didn't matter I was holding her.we let the cd go to 
 # 10 as well kept dancing.We looked into each other eys and  I knew that she 
 had never french b4 and I or we took the chance.It wsa slow and sweet.Oh how 
 I wanted too 4 so long to kiss her sweet lips and feel her togue with mine.
 Oh god I didn't care if her dad came back and shot me.I felt like if i had 
 served my purpose of life.and In disbelief she lead me too her bed and told 
 me to make love to her.She was raped yesterday and now she wanted me to have 
 sex with her.Something wasn't right but I wanted too so much and I didn't 
 mind a bullet in the head it had already been worth it.We both strip and 
 the cd hit #11.It was my first time and her second but everything went 
 perfect.It was sweet again worht every last second.afterward we stay in bed 
 holding each other.I'd marry her if I could and I ask if she would and she 
 said yes but the chance of that happening.were pass the quintillions but 
 things were different.she told her if I didn't want my head to be blown off 
 We had to get up and clean up but I would have rather stayed in ber with her 
 the rest of my life which would be 15min but she got mad and start crying 
 again so I didn't.It didn't take long and when we went downstairs we were 
 confused.her mom & dad were back already,I guess we didn't notice them we 
 were in own which we had earned 4 so long.Luckly tha obvisously didn't know 
 what we had done because the gun was put away.I knew it was time 4 me to go 
 back yo my house and I did.I left.My parent were so worried I just shut 
 myself up in my room 4 the rest of the night.I sat at my computer.I was off 
 my high.I watched people logon and off of my board.not moving.I just sat 
 there listening to my boyz ][ men cd reacting ach monment in my mind so 
 slowly and so sweet. until it think it was 2:00 am knock knock It scared 
 the sh!t outta me.It was steph at my window and she didn't look too good.I 
 poped off my screen.I was expecting her sumhow.she came in and held me.when 
 she let go she said she was moving and as my empire fell I was glad it was 
 over.I was expecting this already but in my life there was 3 things that 
 kept me going my computer(skills),music,and her.I couldn't listen to music 
 w/o her and I wired her in my texts and computer already.I knew after she 
 was gone I had nothing left and I had a plan to kill myself.She told me 
 that she sneaked outta her room window and ran down here.She said that they 
 were leaving tommorrow and she wanted to spend her last night in Napa with 
 me.I smiled made sure my parents were asleep.I made her room on the bed and 
 we started to spent the night together.We both striped to our birthday suits 
 and got int he bed but we didn't want to make love I held her and she held 
 me.I told her about my plan to kill myself and she said "Don't" and thats 
 all she said.We both couldn't sleep we just keeped tossing and turning hold 
 each other tight and dear.I never planned on seeing her again.I got my money 
 and bought $100 worth of 40's and started to drink my problem away even 
 though I can stand alcohol.I woke up went home again and I slept a month 
 w/o waking up,not even going to school.She was gone and as far as I go,I 
 was dead.Then Life started crepping back into me and after a few year 
 Stephanie Berger was just a memory and after a few more that memory died.I 
 had married a girl I met in college and I owned a Successful computer store.
 Steph had just became that best friend u have in junior high liek every1 
 else had but somewhere in memories tucked way far back there in the smallest 
 corner I knew that she was more than just that.

	I loved U,steph, with all my heart
