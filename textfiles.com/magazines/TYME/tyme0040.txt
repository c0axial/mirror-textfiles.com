                             The Wolf
                             --------

    Pant, pant.
    
    Bushes brushing past, darkening skies, the smell of fear and the prey
  emenating it.
    
    Pant, pant.

    The wolf speeds through the thick forest, intent on capturing his prey,
  of which he has been chasing for over an hour now, yet time means nothing,
  only his family's dinner.

    Pant, pant, pant, CHOMP.

    His savage teeth clamp around the weak rabbit, crushing it's bones,
  tasting it's blood, eager to feast, and proud of himself. He has caught
  dinner for himself and his family.

    Sigh.

    The rabbit blood sprays wildly in all directions, carrying the thick
  stench of triumph and death. The small hare thrashes about in a mad frenzy,
  desperatly trying to get away, but the wolf subdues it, smashing it against
  the ground in an attempt to kill the damned thing once and for all.

    Hoooooowl...

    The wolf throws his head and belts out the most mournful wail of triumph
  the now dimly lit forest has heard in generations. This wolf does not kill
  for sport, but to support and survive. This wolf does not enjoy this sort
  of thing, because he has developed a healthy relationship with the small
  woodland animals. They have always helped him through his dry seasons, 
  bringing him help whe he was ill, bringing him water, small pieces of bark,
  and berries for him when he could not hunt for himself.

    The wolf lays down to think.

    Since the arrival of his mate and his pups, he has required much more
  meat to help his little ones grow. And the only way for this to happen is
  to start hunting more frequently, and for more animals to feed his growing
  pups.

    Clamp.

    He lifts the dead rabbit in his powerful jaws, carrying it to the edge of
  a cliff. He lays the rabbit down, and sits back on his haunches to stare at
  the rapidly growing moon. It was a few days off, yet, but he had time. He
  tosses his untamed scruff of hair back and stares silently at the moon,
  wondering why it was him that had to be chosen. He reflects on his short
  life, wondering WHY it was he that was condemmed to die.

    Grr...

    He snatches the carcass up from the ground and trots home, ears flattened
  back against his head, in case any other foolish enough tried to steal his
  hard earned dinner. It would not be pleasurable to kill again tonight.

    Thump, thump.

    His feet pound against the hard packed earth. Water has not been kind to
  the soild or his tired paws.

    Pant, pant.

    He finally reaches the den, set underneath a pile of rocks and leaves,
  concealing a large and sparse cavern containing his mate and six bright-
  eyed pups. He lolls his tounge out after dropping to food amongst the eager
  youngsters, and cocks his head at his mate.

    Whine.

    He makes an acknowledgment back to Her. Her soft eyes make contact with
  his icy sharp ones, and they exchange a mutual greeting.

    Slurp, smack.
    
    Glancing down at the floor, his Pups are busy devouring the dead rabbit.
  His quirks his jaw in a strange human parody, a human being something he
  has never seen before, and the look is somewhat of a smile. He bends down
  and with a quick snap and shake of his jaws, he tears a piece of the rabbit
  away, and proffers it to his mate. She accepts, and he rips out another
  large chunk for himself.

    Grr, snap, crunch, rip.

    He hungrily tears into the thick, yet tender, flesh of the hare, thinking
  again this was NOT an act he took pride in doing.

    Yawn.

    The rabbit meat has made him a drowsy wolf, so he tosses the pieces of
  bone aside and picks at the few bits of meat and drops of blood clinging
  to his whiskers.

    Yawn.

    After slowly grooming himself, the wolf lies his head down between his
  paws and drifts, thinking of when the weather was warm and the forest life
  were his friends, and not his prey.

    Zzz..

    But thoughts turn dark as he remembers his task to be set at the full
  moon in a few days. He dismisses the thought, and falls deeply into sleep.
