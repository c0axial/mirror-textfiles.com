TITLE: Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (MOVIE)
ARTIST: Gus Van Sant
PRICE: I paid $7.00 too much.
I really, really, really wanted to like this flick but sadly, this
thing is lame, lame, lame! Uma Thurman plays Sissy Hankshaw, a
woman who is born with two incredibly huge thumbs; a blessing and
a curse. They allow her to be the queen of hitchhikers. They look
like two huge flesh colored cigar tubes. But even if the makeup was
better, the film would still stink as bad as the N.Y.C. Subway on
a warm summer day.
     First off, this film is in some serious need of cohesion. The
story, in and of itself, is quirky and intriguing but the pacing of
the film is way, way off (maybe that's related to the fact that
poor ol' Gus had to edit and re-edit this thing a jillion times
before the studio would release it). Second, someone should have
called in the nepotism police when Rain Phoenix was cast in this
thing as Bonanza Jellybean. She can't act her way out of a
biodegradable paper bag. Thirdly--and lastly--great characters like
Julian Gitchie (Keanu Reeves), Delores Del Ruby (Lorraine Bracco)
and The Chink (Pat Morita) were never developed, expanded or
explained. Ugh, uggh, UGGGH! Gus has done better work in both
_Drugstore Cowboy_ and _My Own Private Idaho_. Rent them. Watch
them. Love them.

=================================================================
TITLE: American Bar (CANDY)
ARTIST: Fujiya
Very rich and chocolatey stuff from those fine candy makers in
Japan. A huge 6 inch long monster of a chocolate bar filled with
nut chips and cookie crumbs. Yum! I almost forgot to mention the
little air-bubbles in this thing which makes it literally melt in
your mouth. Absolutely, dee-lish-uss! But here's a word of warning
for all you candy loving people out there. Don't _ever_ do what I
did and eat this thing at 4 in the morning when you can't get to
sleep and you start to have some severe munchie-like urges.
     Although the taste _will_ make you feel good, believe me
buddy, within minutes you _will_ feel nauseous as hell! Not mention
the fact that sugar and theobromine (the stuff in chocolate that
gives it that caffeine like kick, FYI) doesn't help _anyone_ with
normal body chemistry get to sleep. So don't be a putz--like moi--
and eat stuff like this in the middle of the night, okay?

=================================================================
TITLE: Absolute Beginners (ZINE)
ARTIST: Absolute Beginners Club
ADDRESS: Andrea Vaughn (P.O. Box 413, Saint James, NY 11780)
PRICE: It goes for $2.00 post paid (USA) and $4.00 post paid
(WORLD)
It's 1994 and mods still exist. And out in the seemingly sterile,
suburbia-like land of Long Island of all places. This zine is
filled with mod manifestos, ramblings and related popish and
punkish miscellany. It's totally great! While I don't totally agree
with some of the politics and such that are espoused in this thing,
there is enough balance between serious and light-hearted stuff in
this zine to make it very readable and enjoyable.
     I loved the essay on the joys of doing origami (which includes
diagrams of course). I liked the short interview with Michael G.--
who along with Andrea Vaughn, founded the Absolute Beginners Club--
since he echoes a lot of feelings I have about the art and music
scene here in New York. And the piece on Andrea meeting
Kerokerokeropi is really, really neat. I especially loved the part
where the jaded author sums up her experience in the line "Sanrio
should just stick to what they really do well--making stuff that's
useless and fun. Kind of like life."  So true. So, so true.

=================================================================
TITLE: Prince Polo (CANDY)
ARTIST: Olza S.A.
Poland based Olza self-describes this stuff as "crisp cocoa wafers
with chocolate coating". Yeah, they are chocolate coated crisp
cocoa wafers--very good tasting chocolate crisp cocoa wafers, if I
do say so myself--but they forgot to mention the most important
thing about their product. Prince Polo bars are cheaper than
dirt!!! A box of 15 of these bars goes for about 4 bucks when you
buy it from most any of the Russian vendors in Little Odessa (which
is more commonly known as Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.A.
for those who don't know). That comes out to about 25 cents per bar
folks; a damn tasty and thrifty deal. The only gripe I have stems
from a little "note to customers" Olza encloses in each box of this
stuff.
     For the most part, it's nice and cordial and thanks you for
buying their product, but then they tell you that "under the
influence of heat, chocolate may become grey, what does not
influence its taste or nutritive value."  Broken english aside,
nobody is _ever_ going tell me that eating grey chocolate is a good
thing. Grey chocolate? Bleagh! I'd rather eat that white chocolate
stuff (which, to me, is not really white or really chocolatey at
all). And "nutritive value"? What's up with that?!? Nobody I know
consumes chocolate for it's "nutritive value". That is unless it
has peanuts in it. Peanuts are a good source of protein, you know.

=================================================================
TITLE: Shonen Knife and Combo Congas (LIVE SHOW)
ARTIST: Pretty obivious, I think.
WHEN: June 5, 1994
WHERE: Osaka, Japan
[Review by Matt Kaufman]
I saw Shonen Knife yesterday (June 5, 1994) and they were amazing.
They did all the songs they used to do before they signed to Virgin
such as _Bananafish_, _Fruit Loop Dreams_, _Public Bath_ etc. The
only bad thing about the show is that since school is out in the
United States a lot of yuppie types are coming to Japan to visit
their friends and stuff. There were a couple of jerks who pushed
their way up to the front without any consideration for others.
     Naoko talked about being on _Late Night with Conan O'Brien_
with John Goodman, and either the streaker or the inside-out body
guy came on but I couldn't hear because the two yuppies started
yelling "Yay Conan" at the top of their lungs. But the show was
still great and anyone who says they can hardly play their
instruments has got to be insane. Oh, they also had a flea market
in which they sold clothes and stuff.
     I got a leather jacket (Made in England) for my girlfriend for
only 10 bucks! I bought a hooded sweatshirt thingy for 2 bucks and
I got this Koala button that they picked up on tour in australia
for a dime (See review below). The opening act was this power pop
duo called _Combo Congas_ and they were incredible. Kind of like
Shonen Knife's little brother band. For the encore both bands came
out and did _Cycling is Fun_ and a cover of the 60s swinger,
_Heatwave_.
[ SETLIST (Shonen Knife): _Miracles_, _Banana Leaf_, _Summer Time
Boogie_, _Elephant Pao Pao_, _Chocobars_, _Bananafish_, _I Am a
Cat_, _Ice Cream City_, _Public Bath_, _Cherry Bomb_ (Runaways/Joan
Jett cover) and _Lazybones_. ENCORE (w/Combo Congas): _Cycling is
Fun_, _Fruit Loop Dreams_ and _Heatwave_. ]

=================================================================
TITLE: "I LOVE KOALA" Button (MISC)
ARTIST: Someone
This button would be your average run of the mill cute kiddie
button, except for a few things. First, he is chewing some sort of
funny looking flower in his little koala mouth. Second, the koala
has this spacey, goofy, giddy smirk on his little koala face.
Third, his little koala paw is buried in his little koala crotch.
What the heck _is_ this koala doing? What type of flower _is_ he
chewing on? This may be an _I LOVE KOALA_ button, but I personally
think this koala is doing a pretty good job of loving him/herself.
Yes-sir-eee.

=================================================================
TITLE: Nutty New Yorker (CANDY)
ARTIST: New York's Finest Chocolate Company
I've been seeing these chocolate bars in stores all over the place.
But something instinctually kept me from trying this new junk food
product. Yet eventually, in a desperate need for food, I caved in
and bought one. Cookie chips, almonds and milk chocolate. Sounds
good, huh? Normally that's not a bad combination, but man oh man,
there is definitely something wrong here. Eating this thing was a
big, nay, _humongous_ mistake. After eating this thing, I felt
incredibly nauseous. I haven't felt this sick since I ate a screwed
up hot dog back when I was eleven. I haven't puked since. This
thing may break might break record. Uggh! I'm going to lie down
now.

=================================================================
TITLE: Now Here (CD)
ARTIST: The San Francisco Seals
ADDRESS: Matador Records (676 Broadway, New York, NY 10012)
PRICE: I paid $10.99
Barbara Manning, driving force and co-producer of this thing, can
do no wrong. This whole album is one great collection of guitary,
folksy, jangly pop. This is the kind of stuff I kill for, and I
love this thing to death! Swingin' original tracks like _Back
Again_ and _Day 12_ mix in perfectly with cover tracks like _Baby
Blue_ and _Janine's Dream_. Most of the audio non-sequiturs that
pop up all over this album are fun and neat, with one exception.
The alarm-like bells near the end of _Back Again_ really throw the
song off-kilter; they are _way_ too distracting. But who cares
about nit-picky stuff like that. As a whole, this is well worth
listening to.

=================================================================
TITLE: Crunky Kids (CANDY)
ARTIST: Lotte
This Japanese candy gives _DEAN Chocolate Candy_ (See Slambook #1)
a serious run for the money. Little bite-sized, pillow shaped dark
chocolate squares filled with crispy rice. This stuff is damn good
eating! Not too sweet. Not too bitter. And the crispy rice stuff is
actually spread evenly throughout each little piece of chocolate.
How _did_ they do that? And if that wasn't enough to convince you
that this stuff kicks, check out the neat packaging.
     The chocolate comes in a little box with a drawer that slides
out when you want a piece of chocolate and neatly slides back so
you can save some for later (so you can save some for later and not
be a pig, FYI). Works a lot more effectively than the little "fold
in the flap" contraptions that are on most boxes of American
chocolate. The fine people at Lotte put a lot of thought and care
into this thing. Only wish the marketing team came up with a better
name. _Crunky Kids_? Who would want to eat a Crunky Kid? What's
next? Moody Bastards?

=================================================================
TITLE: Sorry Again (CD)
ARTIST: Velocity Girl
ADDRESS: Sub Pop (1932 First Avenue, Suite 1103, Seattle, WA 98101)
E-MAIL: info@subpop.com
PRICE: I paid $7.00.
This maxi-single sounds okay... Well not really... But, I dunno...
I mean geez, this isn't the _Velocity Girl_ that _I_ remember. But
I guess I remembered them wrong? Or maybe they're reinventing
themselves? Who knows. The title track--which comes off of their
second full-length album _Simpatico!_--is really great guitar pop.
I definitely could listen to more stuff like this. But the other
tracks really fall flat and do nothing for me.
     _Marzipan_ is decent, but not to die for. _Diamond Jubilee_ is
the only track on this maxi-single sung by Archie, and it doesn't
really come off well on any level. _Labrador_ is just totally
unbearable to my ears. The synthesizer stuff in it just reminds me
too much of the riffs that you hear mainly on early 80s "new-wave"
songs. Ugggh! Overall, the sound is too smooth and calculated for
my taste. It didn't grab me in the same way that Velocity Girl's
older material did. *sigh*
      Oh well, things change. That's life. Time to chew some gum.

=================================================================
TITLE: Black Black (CANDY)
ARTIST: Lotte
You haven't lived until you've tried _this_ stuff. It's been highly
recommend to me by many sugar jockey friends of mine, but I'll be
damned if I ever consider _Black Black_ to be "sugary" in any way.
This is the weirdest candy I have _ever_ tasted. The flavor changes
and mutates the longer you chew it.
     First, it tastes like licorice--really gritty, bitter and
strong licorice. Then it gets minty--sharp and mouth stingingly
minty. Then it gets mentholy--much more mentholy than even most
throat lozenges get. If you keep on chewing it, before you know it,
it tastes like your mouth has been swabbed down and scrubbed out
with some kind of industrial strength cleanser. Bleagh! Although it
tastes horrific, it does have a purpose. Its potent flavor can help
clean out, wash away and destroy any unwanted odors or aftertastes
in your mouth. Bad tasting _and_ useful.

=================================================================
TITLE: Anti-Social Commentary #1 (COMIC)
ARTIST: Emily Ryan Lerner
ADDRESS: Emily Ryan Lerner (P.O. Box 12, Old Chatham, NY 12136)
PRICE: It goes for $.50 plus two first class stamps.
This small collection of comics by Emily is extremely likeable. The
artwork is very simple, doodly and scrawl-like. The stories are
neat and well paced. _Conversion of the High Schoolers_ is an
amusing commentary on religious "right wing old men in suits" who
pass out bibles, and try to convert kids in and around school
campuses. I almost died laughing at _An American Love Story_. It's
the heartwarming the story of a crazy man named Bob who falls in
love with a monster who is roaming the city in search of health
food ("anything organically grown"). One of the best lines comes
when the relationship between Bob and the monster goes sour, "Bob
lived with the trees until Christmas season."  Surreal _and_ funny.
A neat combination.

=================================================================
TITLE: Jonny Cohen (PERSON)
ARTIST: Jonny Cohen
ADDRESS: TeenBeat (P.O. Box 3265, Arlington, VA 22203)
Jonny Cohen is namesake, head honcho and driving force of TeenBeat
rock sensation, _Jonny Cohen's Love Machine_. The Love Machine's
sound can be called anything from rockish to punkish to popish to
whatever. Although you can't pin a label on the Love Machine, Jonny
himself is definitely creative, funny and has a weird sense of
humor. This interview was done in May, 1994.
[SLAM]    Is there any basic rule you stick by as far as the whole
          creative thing goes? As far as keeping your focus goes?
[J.C.]    I find that not hearing too much about what the public
          thinks helps a lot.
[SLAM]    So it's better to concentrate on yourself.
[J.C.]    I find it better to just do your stuff. Not leave
          yourself vulnerable to what people say. I always want to
          hear what people have to say, but I find that it's better
          not to hear it.
[SLAM]    Does _Jonny Cohen's Love Machine_ do live gigs?
[J.C.]    We play in Washington, D.C. quite a bit.
[SLAM]    Is that with the lineup that's off of _Getting Our Heads
          Back Together_?
[J.C.]    No, it's changed a little bit since then. We have a new
          a drummer who was on _Getting Our Heads Back Together_
          but someone who played bass for _Getting Our Heads Back
          Together_ isn't in the band anymore. And we have someone
          who's playing guitar with the other guitar player. And
          the guy who played piano on _Getting Our Heads Back
          Together_ is playing bass, just because it was
          convenient. When you have friends and they want to do it-
          -and it seems like good there's chemistry--you shift a
          bit.
[SLAM]    How did you get started in the whole punk/indie-rock
          thing?
[J.C.]    It's really a thing where you could say I just did it
          because my friends did it. I just thought "Hey! I can do
          this."   So I just thought that I could do it, and I
          guess I had a sense of fun about it.
[SLAM]    For me that's the neatest thing about it. It sounds like
          it's totally spontaneous.
[J.C.]    I kind of went nuts. I just thought it was really fun. In
          some ways I don't understand the where I come off, the
          way I come off. Like with _Time Loop_ (from the self-
          titled first album), all I was thinking in _Time Loop_
          was that it sounds circular. And I thought "Wow, that's
          really fun."
[SLAM]    So it's all spontaneous fun, as opposed to stiff,
          calculated expertise.
[J.C.]    Expertise can be an excuse for not showing yourself.
[SLAM]    Is your singing related to that? Since a lot of people's
          first reaction to your music is "Uggh, _he_ can't sing!"
[J.C.]    I really don't realize too well that I can't sing. So, I
          just think it's a good time and that I'm getting my words
          across and everything. I don't really recognize that I
          can't sing. That's part of the reason I'm able to do it.
          If I was really aware that people hated my singing I
          don't know if I could do it. What was I thinking was "I
          hope they get crazy and catch on to the circularness and
          run around in circles and just smash each other and stuff
          like that."
[SLAM]    Just get into the whole sound of it.
[J.C.]    The whole visual effect. I think it's psychedelic and
          it's the funness of it. I could just imagine everybody
          dancing in circles and hitting each other and having fun.
[SLAM]    Does that ever happen?
[J.C.]    No. That doesn't happen. (laughs)
[SLAM]    So what do people end up doing at live shows?
[J.C.]    That was a big disappointment to me; I think I was very
          naive. I thought that for each song people would start
          doing different things and stuff like that. It didn't
          happen. Some things happen that make it hard. I don't
          project as well as I would like to live, so people can't
          hear the words a whole lot.
[SLAM]    Does the audience just stand around and stare, or do they
          mosh like idiots?
[J.C.]    No, no. They just stand around. People who do mosh tend
          to not be that interested; they do it as a joke and then
          leave. And then I get excited because they do that--
          because that's what I want these people to do--and then
          it turns out that they're not interested. It's funny that
          way.
[SLAM]    Where do the shows happen?
[J.C.]    We play at the _15 Minute Club_. We have a regular gig
          there right now. We get occasional shows at other places,
          but I like the _15 Minute Club_. We also played at the
          _Simple Machines Working Holiday Three-Day Weekend_.
[SLAM]    How did that go off?
[J.C.]    I have a hard time getting a feel for live shows, but I
          thought we had a real good show. The band we had at that
          was very spontaneous. It's getting to be more of a
          straight rock and roll thing than a gimmick thing. That's
          just the way it's going. At first I had gimmick idea and
          nobody responded to it.
[SLAM]    Gimmick?
[J.C.]    I came up with a gimmick for most of my stuff. _Time
          Loop_ = People dancing around in circles. _Civil
          Underminer Engineer_ = People putting on sunglasses and
          acting cool. I kind of had a gimmick for every song. Now
          I kind of went off that, and just started trying to make
          interesting sounds and stuff and start to go in a rock
          and roll direction. Another thing with the songs is that
          I try to make them unique and interesting musically. I've
          been going more in that direction, partly from people not
          latching onto my gimmicks and partly as a kind of
          confidence in my own musical ideas. I don't have a good
          voice. I have good ideas. I'll stick to that.
[SLAM]    What drives you? Where do the ideas comes from?
[J.C.]    Being half crazy and wanting to express myself. And
          actually, I don't know where my ideas really came from.
          I liked pop music as a kid, but I don't see it too much
          in the stuff I do. I do see it partially. You know the
          songs in 70s like _How Do You Do_ and stuff like that.
          Where the melody would convey certain emotions. It was
          very based on the melody. And the melody would have a
          goofy sound. And I think I was thinking I wanted to do
          that, and kind of have it with more of an edge. More
          exciting. Less restrained. More all out. So in a way it's
          like putting an edge on commercial pop from the 70s which
          I like, but I wish they would have gotten more creative.
[SLAM]    So you'd call your sound more of a punk/pop sound?
[J.C.]    You can call it punk _Captain and Tenelle_. That kind of
          is what I was thinking. People with good ideas but they
          were too restrained. I do think the visual side of
          melodies can really be fun. I like hearing a song and
          getting pictures in my head from the melody and from
          everything, actually. I think I have more of a problem
          just feeling the motions of the beat and everything. I
          kind of see music like seeing images in my head more than
          feeling it.
[SLAM]    So there's a whole visual aspect to your stuff. Anything
          else?
[J.C.]    Another big thing about it is that I've gone through my
          whole life feeling like everything I do is mediocre and
          nothing I do is worthwhile. And you just think that and
          you say "Screw that."  You know, what am I going to do?
          Just live my life and have everybody tell me that I am a
          mediocre person, or am I going to try something and say
          "To hell with it." I think a lot of people get
          discouraged in general because they are taught none of
          their ideas are very good.
[SLAM]    So it's better to just say "Fuck it" and do it.
[J.C.]    It seems to me that's almost what you have to do to do it
          at all. You have develop that attitude. That's certainly
          what I had to do.
[SLAM]    What input does the band have in things?
[J.C.]    The guitarist Pete (Nelson) has done all my records and
          he's really great and me and him a great rapport. His
          feelings and my feelings mesh really well. He definitely
          plays the songs as an individual; he has his own style
          and everything. But that's good, I think that in art you
          have to compromise and not compromise.
[SLAM]    Balance things out.
[J.C.]    We have struck a balance. It seems like he really makes
          my stuff go. He's been very vital. These days we have
          another guitarist working with him.
[SLAM]    Are there plans to put out any new material?
[J.C.]    We have some ideas, but I did kind of start off with a
          bang where I just went crazy and then I cooled off.
          That's just the way I am. When I have an idea sometimes
          I just go crazy with it and then I sort of start to think
          and then things slow down. Something will happen and then
          I'll think about it and I'll ease off quite a bit.
[SLAM]    Eternal procrastination?
[J.C.]    At first I'm just real excited about something and just
          go crazy. And then I'll start to think a little and some
          of the edge goes out of it.
[SLAM]    The _Space Butterfly_ material sounded a lot different
          from all your other stuff.
[J.C.]    That was more of an arty thing. I actually wanted to just
          put out _Getting Our Heads Back Together_ next, but
          things went slow and I had to keep things going and I got
          together another talented musician (Ward Shortridge) with
          Pete again and Ward's brother (Matt Shortridge) who plays
          fiddle. I started working with another friend whose thing
          is folk music and he does it very well, and it's much
          different than rock music. So it gives it a real
          different feel and that's definitely a good thing about
          my songs is that they're very adaptable. I mean I
          originally wrote the songs with the idea that if I didn't
          get any help, I'd sing them by myself. So when that
          happens, the instruments tend to just be gravy. Because
          if you can just sing a melody and it has the feeling of
          the song in itself, I think that all the musician has to
          do is play the song with the feeling. And that's it.
[SLAM]    So it flows because it's simplicity.
[J.C.]    Just as long as the musician feels it. I think actually
          on different cuts and stuff you can hear the musicians
          feel it more or less in the different ways that they're
          done.
[SLAM]    _I'm Not an Anorexic_ (from the _Space Butterfly_ 7" EP)
          was really weird in a good way.
[J.C.]    _I'm Not an Anorexic_ I wanted to do as a rock song. But
          I don't know, it doesn't sound as good as a rock song.
[SLAM]    It's a real scary sounding thing.
[J.C.]    Mark (Robinson) helped to produce that song and the scary
          idea was partly his and I'm scared of that stuff because
          I like the songs to be straightforward and not confusing.
          And that song is confusing.
[SLAM]    What was the concept behind that one?
[J.C.]    The idea is to have this punk rock song about anorexics.
          The idea was to play it like a rock song and have these
          anorexic girls dancing around hitting each other. I
          always have ideas of people smashing each other.
[SLAM]    Man oh man, what a visual you just gave me!
[J.C.]    That was the idea. Having an anorexic rock band playing
          _I'm Not an Anorexic_ and all these skinny girls hitting
          each other and stuff.
[SLAM]    That's really surreal.
[J.C.]    Mine is a happy anorexic song that I think that a real
          anorexic band would play. But it's a fantasy. I'm just an
          optimist you know.
[SLAM]    Any else you want to say?
[J.C.]    One thing. With art and performance. It's just tricky.
          You don't want to give too much of yourself away. There's
          got to be a balance or it can drive you crazy. It'll ruin
          the whole thing.
