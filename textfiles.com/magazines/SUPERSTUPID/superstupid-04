TITLE: God Don't Make No Junk (CD)
ARTIST: The Halo Benders
ADDRESS: K (Box 7154, Olympia, WA 98507)
PRICE: I paid $12.99.
Calvin Johnson's latest non-Beat Happening side project is one of
the funnest things I've heard in a long time.  Ten ultra-neat lo-
fi, poppy and punky, garage rock songs about girl, guys,
relationships and all of the fun junk that falls in between those
categorical cracks.  So lyrically, _God Don't Make No Junk_ is what
most of us Beat Happening fans--and most of us are, right?--are
used to.  Musically, it's a slightly different story.
     The Halo Benders aren't as minimalist in sound as Beat
Happening--thanks to a noticeably fuller rhythm section on most of
the tracks--and there's little, if any, of the typical guitar
feedback in this collection.  Glue that together with some great
Steve Fisk mixing, and you got yourself one fine album.  Standout
cuts include _Will Work For Food_, _Freedom Ride_ and my personal
fave, _Don't Touch My Bikini_.  Just the mere idea of Calvin
singing about bikini's from the first person voice is enough to
make me like it.  Oh yeah, for some reason the track _Scarin_
sounds like a Jeff Lynne/ELO ballad on a bagful of peyote.  Haven't
decided if that is a bad or a good thing, but you've been warned.

=================================================================
TITLE: Piyochan's Lemon Chewing Gum (CANDY)
ARTIST: Creative Yoko Co., Ltd.
Piyochan is a cute little yellow chick-bird who likes lemons.  This
cute little bird is also the ever lovable pitch-person for some
damn fine tasting lemon flavored chewing gum.  The flavor can only
be described as being some funky gimmish of massive citrus tartness
and gushing sugary sweetness.  Insanely good stuff.  But while the
flavor is great, I don't like the way the flavor dies off.  It
doesn't fade away like other types of gum or candy. It just plain
disappears, not even leaving an aftertaste behind.  *sigh*  What's
up with that?

=================================================================
TITLE: Your Silent Face/You're So Good To Me (7" SINGLE)
ARTIST: Velocity Girl
ADDRESS: MERGE Records (P.O. Box 1235, Chapel Hill, NC 27514)
PRICE: It goes for $3 post paid.
Indie pop people, Velocity Girl, do the cover-song thing with this
two cut hunk o' vinyl.  _Your Silent Face_, one of my all-time fave
New Order songs, gets redone via a synthesizerless, sugary and
harmonica accompanied arrangement.  Not as moody--a bit too cheery-
-than the original, but not too bad either.  The other side,
_You're So Good To Me_, is a great version of a good song by
everyone's fave Beach Boy, Brian Wilson.  Velocity Girl's guitar
pop-sound was meant for tunes like this.  One of the guys--Archie
I assume--sings the lead on this, accompanied by some great twangy
guitar, and Sarah's la-la-las.  No badness on this one at all.

=================================================================
TITLE: ACEROLA Chewing Gum (CANDY)
ARTIST: Lotte
What do you think of when you read the word, ACEROLA?  For some
reason, when I first read the label on this gum I thought of some
ol' gruff old bastard looking at me and saying "Hey kid!  You don't
know shit from acerola!"  And frankly, I don't.  So sue me.  A
quick gander in Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary tells me that
acerola is "a West Indian shrub with mildly acid cherry-like fruits
very rich in vitamin C", which is a pretty accurate description of
what this gum tastes like.
     It has an incredibly tart cherry taste that stings my
tastebuds; which is a good thing.  The flavor is so sweet and
strong that even after the gum is gone, it leaves a yummy cherry-
like aftertaste floating through my mouth.  *sigh*  Chewing gum
heaven.  Worth getting your hands on at any cost.

=================================================================
TITLE: Sof' Boy Volume 2, Issue 2 (COMIC)
ARTIST: Archer Prewitt
ADDRESS: Simple Machines (P.O. Box 10290, Arlington, VA 22210-1290)
PRICE: I paid $1.50, but I'd send them a stamp/IRC for a current
catalog to make sure this is still available from them.
I'm gonna cut to the chase, Archer Prewitt, of Chicago swingers
lounge swingers Coctails, has put together one of the best mini-
comics I have ever seen.  Gush city on this one, so stop reading
this review if you're incurably misanthropic, and hate ultra-happy
reviews, okay?
     Technically speaking, this mini-comic _is_ actually a _mini_
comic.  Four-color separations and everything in a lovely 4.25" x
5.25" package.  Considering that most mini's are black and white
xerox jobs that are hastily collated and stapled together, this one
definitely stands out from the crowd.
     Sof' Boy, our cute protagonist, looks like a relative of the
Pillsbury doughboy, acts as naively benevolent as Barney the
Dinosaur, and has the magical ability to put/pull himself back
together like the '70s cartoon fave, the Shmoo.  He is such the
loveable, and eternally optimistic, dork!  I guess you have to be
when you live in the nasty world he lives in.
     It's a world filled with vagrants who feel him up, steam
rollers that run him over, kids who pump him full of lead, old men
who beat him up with canes and speeding cars that decapitate him. 
Wouldn't _you_ be an optimist if _you_ lived in such a world? 
Regardless of what's thrown at him, Sof' Boy pulls through it all
with a big dorky smile on his face, and that's why I love him.  My
fave moment of Sof' Boy cheerfulness occurs when he's mistakenly
arrested for gun possession.
     His ass is kicked into paddy wagon, then he's photographed,
finger printed and thrown into a dark and dingy prison cell that's
equipped with only a toilet and cot as furniture.  "What a
comfortable cot..." he says as lays down in it.  As I said, he is
such the optimistic dork.

=================================================================
TITLE: The Heart's Tremolo (CD)
ARTIST: Tsunami
ADDRESS: Simple Machines (P.O. Box 10290, Arlington, VA 22210-1290)
PRICE: It goes for $10.00 post paid.
Listening to _The Heart's Tremolo_ was a big kick in the head to
this Tsunami fan.  Individually, their songs and singles have
always been great but their first full-length album, _Deep End_,
really sounded like it was rushed.  Everything on that LP just
seemed to be tossed together with no particular rhyme or reason. 
This time around all of the things that make Tsunami great fall
into place perfectly.  Songs flow smoothly from one to another in
a really neat and well thought out package.
     Soft melodies in tracks like _Quietnova_ and _Fits and Starts_
do a nice job of bridging and balancing the more rockin' din of
_Loud is as Loud Does_, _Cowed by the Bla Bla_ and _Be Like That_. 
There's even a groovy instrumental, _Slaw_, which has a guitar
section that sounds like it was lifted straight off of--I'm not
kidding you folks--Black Sabbath's _War Pigs_.  The track does a
pretty good job of dividing the CD's 10 tracks; not mention making
me dig up my war-torn copy of _Paranoid_ just to satiate my aural
delusions.  The only cut that sounds a bit weak is _Kidding on the
Square_, but lyrics like "do you have the guts to pick up a penny
off the ground" make it totally unhateable.

=================================================================
TITLE: Tsunami & Codeine (LIVE SHOW)
ARTIST: Pretty obvious, no?
To say that lovely New York City--and most of the east coast--
was hotter than hell the day of this show at CBGBs is a major
understatement.  It was a zillion-gajillion degrees, and then some. 
But I'm rambling...
     Tsunami was great, doing lots of new material off of _The
Heart's Tremolo_.  Can't remember the names of all the songs they
played--who can remember or think when they're slowly
dehydrating--but I do remember them doing _Slaw_, _Sometimes a
Notion_, _460_, _Be Like That_, _Le Bride De Elegance_, _Fast Food
Medicine_ and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Jenny and Kristin were
great doing their guitar/vocal thing.  Andrew's bass was slightly
sluggish, but okay.  And John's jazzish drumming was incredibly
refreshing (Fuck, I sound like Kramer...)
     Miscellany-wise, Kristin had a good rant about the utter
stupidity of wearing polyester shirts in gym class (I hear ya...)
and Jenny had a neat sales-pitch/story about almost losing a whole
bunch of Tsunami t-shirts on a flight from Chicago.  A very well
composed and polite band, considering that the crowd was literally
filled with frat-boys--or people who just enjoy looking like them--
shouting about how they wanted to "do a mosh pit". *sigh*  Not to
mention this drunk bud-boy who was standing on the chair next to me
talkin' about how cool it was when he and some buddies trashed up
some place at some Mighty Mighty BossTones show.  *sigh*  I get's
better, read on...
     Buddy almost falls off the chair, so I grab him.  I ask "You
okay?"  He say "Nahh.  I wasn't worried, there's more than enough
cleavage here to brace my fall, ya know [nod, wink, nudge]..." 
*sigh* ad infinitum.  Is there some tour bus--maybe one of those
double-decker jobs that you see all over New York City--that
guarantees to drop off losers at CBs on Saturday nights?
     Codeine was as sluggishly great as they always are, although
it was mildly depressing to see that tons of people cleared out
after Tsunami.  What's up with that?  Hath people no taste.  Is
Simple Machines Sub Pop's next big threat?  Hmmmm... The mind
wobbles...

=================================================================
TITLE: Marvin the Album (CD)
ARTIST: Frente!
ADDRESS: Mammoth/Atlantic (Or is that Atlantic/Mammoth? 
Regardless, most any of the overpriced chain record places will
have this thing.)
PRICE: Costs more than pizza.  Not to mention, it's less filling.
Back in junior high school, our spanish teacher made us memorize
inane conversation-like scripts in hopes of making everyone bi-
lingual.  It didn't work.  Neither does this album.  Join me as I
write this review in a tribute-like fashion in honor of my junior
high spanish teacher, Ms. Bentham.

     NOT ME:   Mi amigo, donde esta mi _Frente!_ grabacion?
     ME:       Tu _Frente!_ grabacion es en basura...
     NOT ME:   Hay dios mio!
     ME:       Lo compadazco.  _Frente!_ es un conyo mas grande...
     NOT ME:   Tu esta muy boracho!
     ME:       Si.  Mi favorito jugador de beisbol es Fernando
               Valenzuella!
     NOT ME:   Tu esta _muy_ boracho!

CONCLUSION: My spanish sucks, and so does this album.

=================================================================
TITLE: Twenty Six Panel Sex Comic (COMIC)
ARTIST: Ron Rege
ADDRESS: NiB Comics (P.O. Box 382163, Cambridge, MA 02238)
PRICE: It goes for $2.00 post paid.
All you nutty, koo-koo-crazy, indie-rock kiddies have probably have
seen Ron Rege's work on Swirlies album covers, t-shirts and other
assorted miscellany.  In fact, one of the best comics he's ever
done, _Beauty Section_, is part of the album art to the Swirlies
LP, _Blonder Tongue Audio Baton_.  But that's besides the point. 
This comic is great in it's own way.
     First, you get what you pay for, 26 full-page panels that
poetically philosophize and analyze that wonderfully mysterious
thing that drives us all, sex.  But all you sleaze-balls can just
back off and put your hairy palms back in your pockets.  This isn't
a pornographic jizz-fest like _Cherry Poptart_ or other "adult"
comics.  Ron has a brain and uses it.
     On orgasms?  "It doesn't matter if I draw a half-assed attempt
[at visually explaining orgasms] because no matter what I or anyone
draws no image can come close to what this feels like."  On lust? 
"I remember my heart fluttering over the girls in kindergarten.  I
am very sensitive to the fact that it is no fun to be a woman,
being ogled by men all the time."  On homosexuality? "If it feels
right to you, then by all means, I'm all for it!"  On love? "Love
exists!"  Combine statements as cooly honest as that with some
funky primitive/abstract art and you have one great comic.  Very
much worth the money.  And if you're too cheap to buy his stuff,
send him a S.A.S.E. and he'll send you something cool.

=================================================================
TITLE: Juicy & Fresh (CANDY)
ARTIST: Lotte
Ugggh!  Bealgh!  P-tooey!  What a friggin' lie and sham the name of
this gum is. Juicy _and_ Fresh?  I don't think so.  Juicy?  Nah, it
has a taste reminiscent of the gritty, bitter taste one gets when
one bites into an unripe piece of produce.  And fresh?  No way!  No
matter how long chew this stuff, it never manages to lose its
chemical-like, mothball rich taste.  Yikes!  An el cheapo pack of
good ol' American _Juicyfruit_ tastes a helluva lot better than an
ultra-expensive pack of this Japanese confectionery travesty.

=================================================================
TITLE: Prescription drugs that Jeff had to take (DRUGS)
ARTIST: Jeff, Jeff's dentist and various pharmaceutical companies
ADDRESS: X Magazine (P.O. Box 1077, Royal Oak, MI 48068-1077)
E-MAIL: xmag@world.std.com
PRICE: No loser, he will _not_ sell you these, or any drugs, so
don't even _think_ about asking.  But you can send him $3.00 for a
sample issue of X Magazine--It's Cyberlicious!
[Reviews by Jeff Hansen]
PENICILLIN: Pretty straightforward. You'd have to be born under a
            rock not to know that this is an anti-biotic. You may
            not know, however, that it goes with either red or
            white wine.
            [SIDE EFFECTS: decreases effectiveness of oral
            contraceptives; diarrhea.]
PERCOCET:   I was originally given these pills to combat Wisdom
            Teeth Removal Pain (sounds like the Chi Peps' new
            album). I was told to take a pill IMMEDIATELY. However,
            because of the numbness of my lower lip and general
            hilarity, I shot the pill clear across the bathroom
            along with a large amount of water. I didn't find it
            until five (miraculously) pain-free hours later. This
            pill will make you feel groggy, groggy, groggy. But a
            good kind of groggy. My sister had to dip into my
            supply for some post-op pain she had; she informs me
            that it (an accidental double-dose) makes Saturday
            Night Live seem funny, so you KNOW it's powerful goo.
            [SIDE EFFECTS: mentally/physically dependent; sleepy;
            foosball.]
V-CILLIN:   This is a stronger version of PENICILLIN. I was given
            this after I acquired an infection from the wisdom
            tooth surgery. Isn't this one of the members of Public
            Enemy?
            [SIDE EFFECTS: same as PENICILLIN, except stronger (go
            figure).]
FLAGYL:     Arrrrrrrrrrrghhh! This is the nastiest drug I've ever
            had to take: It's big. It tastes like chalk and
            cigarettes. And lint. It has the worst side effects.
            One thing they don't mention is the possibility that
            you will react to the drug in the wrong way and develop
            a kidney stone that, according to the nurse hunched
            over your fetal, quivering form, is the "worst kind of
            pain there is". Great, you've made it, boola! This is
            also THE drug to take if you have a wide array of
            sexually-transmitted diseases. So, hey, kill two birds
            with one kidney stone.
            [SIDE EFFECTS: dizziness; dry mouth; darkened urine;
            emergency room visit.]
DEMAROL:    I was given this in the hospital intravenously to
            combat the pain associated with my kidney stone. It
            makes everything serene; the only problem is you have
            to concentrate to focus your eyes.
            [SIDE EFFECTS: knighthood; desire to fish naked.]
VICODIN:    My latest drug, and the biggest pill yet. I was given
            it for any follow-up pain, but I haven't had to take it
            yet. Its size, however, says to me: "I mean BUSINESS!"
            Can't WAIT!
            [SIDE EFFECTS: sleepy; physically/mentally dependent;
            dressing up in opposite gender's clothes.]

=================================================================
TITLE: Relax (CANDY)
ARTIST: Lotte
Ever wonder what it would taste like to take a nice long lick of
one of those cardboard car air fresheners?  You know, those little
pine-tree-like thingies.  Well, dream no more candy lovers, because
Relax gum tastes _exactly_ like what I'd imagine one of those air
freshener thingies would taste like.  As strong, putrid and
"unique" in taste as _Black Black_ (reviewed in Slambook #3) but
unlike _Black Black_, it has no character or personality
whatsoever.  Really sucky stuff.  Definitely not something to waste
your hard earned junk-food cash on.  Inhaling copier toner seems
more appealing.

=================================================================
TITLE: The Guy Who Lived Under a Picnic Table (PERSON)
ARTIST: Dan, the guy who lived under a picnic table
ADDRESS: Same as the SLAMBOOK
PRICE: If you'd like to own or rent someone who lives under a
picnic table, you're more screwed up than you think.  But this
grade "A", certifiable, true story originally ran back in the
Summer/Fall, 1993 issue of EXILE; a zine that Matt and his brother
Spencer put out whenever they feel like it.  The next issue--due
out in the fall--will be an ultra huge thing devoted to the
underground scene in Osaka, Japan.  If you're interested in the
super-mega-total-all-star-Osaka-a-go-go issue of EXILE, you can
contact Matt and Spencer via the SLAMBOOK's luxurious and elegant
New York City P.O. Box.  They love to get postcards, FYI.
[Interview by Matt Kaufman]
[SLAM] Why did you go to Hawaii in the first place?
[DAN]  I was teaching English in Japan and I went to Hawaii for
       three weeks because my visa was running out.  Then I decided
       to stay.
[SLAM] How did you end up living under a picnic table?
[DAN]  At the end of three weeks, I went to some island named
       Somali and I camped out one night with a friend of mine. 
       The I got the idea of camping all the time.  I started out
       in a tent, but the tent got stolen.  So I lived under a
       picnic table.
[SLAM] What did you do to support yourself?
[DAN]  I worked as a security guard at a housing project.  I cooked
       all of my food at the campground on propane burners.
[SLAM] Did you ever get anything ripped off?
[DAN]  Not too much.  Some.
[SLAM] Did you have any bad experiences while you were living under
       the picnic table?
[DAN]  I was at the campgrounds and there were these big Samoan
       dudes with a '56 Chevy.  They asked me where the bathroom
       was and I showed it to them.  In the bathroom, they
       threatened to beat me up.  But I talked them out of it and
       we actually became friends.  We cruised around in the '56
       Chevy.
[SLAM] What advice do you have for other people who are thinking of
       going down to Hawaii to live under picnic tables?
[DAN]  Hawaii is expensive.  The key thing is to get a motor
       scooter.  Then you'll be able to go anywhere.
[SLAM] So what are you doing now?
[DAN]  I'm living in Chicago studying for my actuarial exams.  I
       want to write a book about college graduate who is homeless
       for eight months, and works as a security guard to support
       himself.  It ends when he becomes a successful businessman.

| This was SUPER STUPID SLAMBOOK #4 (JULY 1994)                 |
| All contents (c) 1994 Jack Szwergold, all rights reserved.    |
| And after saying all that, I realize  that this is an elec-   |

| be  duplicated with  little or no  effort. So this is to let  |
| you know that distribution is free. You can copy and send it  |
| to as many people and places as you want. But the content is  |
| mine, and plagiarism is just not a nice thing. Which is the   |
| only reason why I stuck a copyright statement on this thing.  |
| So be nice, and don't claim authorship to things you didn't   |
