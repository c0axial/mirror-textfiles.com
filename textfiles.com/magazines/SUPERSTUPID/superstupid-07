|      [ Hey Jack. What's up with this gossamer schmate? ]      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
     My name is Mr. Slambook.  In September 1992 my car was
     repossessed and the bill collectors were hounding me like you
     wouldn't believe. I was laid off and my unemployment checks
     had run out. The only escape I had from the pressure of
     failure was my computer, my modem, a bottle of vodka and
     Oprah. I longed to turn my advocation into my vocation. This
     January 1994 my family and I went on a weekend sojourn to
     Coney Island. I bought a Yugo for CASH in February 1994.
          I am currently building a tree house on the West Coast of
     Queens, with an above ground pool, a dog house, and a
     beautiful view of the driveway from my breakfast room table
     and patio. I will never have to work again. Today I am rich! 
     I have earned over $400.00 (F-O-R-E  H-U-N-D-R-E-D  D-O-L-L-E-
     R-S) to date and will become stinking rich within 4 or 5
     decades. Anyone can do the same. This money making program
     works perfectly every time, 100 percent of the time. I have
     NEVER failed to earn $5 or more whenever I wanted. Best of all
     you never have to leave home except to go to your mailbox or
     the post office or the corner store to play lotto. But that's
     all I'm going to tell you about the secret of my success.
     Because if I told you any more, I'd compromise the stability
     of my Rockefeller-like existence.


I own a mansion and a yacht,

TITLE: The Decline and Fall of Heavenly (CD)
ARTIST: Heavenly
ADDRESS: K (Box 7154, Olympia, WA 98507)
PRICE: It goes for $10.00 post paid
No more wait!  New Heavenly has arrived, and how wonderful it is. 
Honest.  I mean, can this Oxford quintette ever put out a bad
album?  No.  Never. They can't.  And this is yet more tangible
evidence of this immutable law of pop nature.  More loveable tunes
filled with peppy keyboards, jangly guitars and some of the
happiest singing you'll ever hear.  What more would you want, you
misanthropic fool?  For the senseless who need to know, read on.
     My fave track is _Skipjack_.  It has a great beat thing going;
accentuated by a cowbell, natch. _Sperm Meets Egg, So What?_ gets
extra brownie points for creative titling.  Whoops!  Almost forgot,
_Sacramento_ which is a groovy instrumental that does a job of
splitting the tracks kindasorta in half.  Kinda.  I mean, you can't
properly say that the fifth cut in an eight cut release is the dead
center, can you?  But who care's about math.  This is reality,
babe.  Dig it.

=================================================================
TITLE: New Bottle (CANDY)
ARTIST: Orion
Well, I got two bottles of this stuff.  Yeah bottles.  It comes
packaged as little liter sized soda bottles.  But they're not liter
size soda bottles, they just look like them.  They're actually
about 2.5 inches high.  One of them looks like a Fresca bottle. 
The other one looks like an orange soda bottle.  But don't let that
fool you.  The candy in both tastes the same.
     Sugary chunks of stuff that are just a tad bigger than Pixie
stick powder, and slightly smaller than Nerds.  The taste most
definitely leans more towards the Pixie stick powder side of the
spectrum.  But there's one important difference.  Unlike Pixie
sticks, Nerds and other similar candy treats, this stuff sucks. 
Despite the candy being virtually hermetically sealed in this
little bottle, the candy tastes like it's been sitting and molding
in some storage closet somewhere.  Who the hell want's to willfully
eat stuff that tastes like that?

=================================================================
TITLE: The Arthur Lee/Love Experience (PERSON)
ARTIST: Glenn Susser, Arthur Lee, a cab and a radio
Glenn likes music and likes that groovy group Love, which is yet
another victim of another tribute album.  Below is one of Glenn's
youthful memories of picking up Arthur Lee as a cab fare.  Yes,
Glenn was a cabbie.  Yes, he was a cabbie in New York City.  And I
don't care what anyone says.  You deserve a medal for doing that.
[Memory by Glenn Susser]
It's ancient history already.  I drove in the city over 20 years
ago during school breaks.  Those were the days when cabbies still
spoke English and obeyed a few of the laws.  Was easily the most
interesting job I had.  Everyday it was something else.  Didn't
pick up too many celebrities, but the most memorable was Arthur Lee
of Love.  He gets in and is going to a recording studio... I didn't
recognize him although I was a big fan.  Hendrix is on my portable
FM and he asks me to turn it up, which I was more than happy to do. 
Hendrix was Lee's idol.  After the song, he just asks me if I knew
who he was. When I told him no, he sez, like it's a big deal (which
it really was to me) "I'm Arthur Lee of Love."  Well, if you know
anything about Love, you'd know that they were almost completely
unknown at the time.  I was probably the 1 in a 1,000 that knew
them.  He was such a conceited asshole you wouldn't believe it.

=================================================================
TITLE: Kiss Mint: Sampler Pack (CANDY)
ARTIST: Glica
After bitching and moaning about how horrid the Kiss Mint for Wake
up was in a previous issue, a pal clued me into this little thing. 
A sampler pack of some of the less useful Kiss Mint flavors.
     Unlike Kiss Mint for Wake Up, which is designed with some sort
of tangible, utilitarian angle, in mind this stuff is really flaky. 
Kiss Ming for Refresh?  What the heck is that?  Don't the concepts
of "refresh" and "wake-up" overlap in some way?  Or is this gum for
one of those days that I have that "not-so-fresh" feeling?  Or Kiss
Mint for Elegance?!?!  Unless Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, and Audrey
Hepburn chew this--which I doubt since they're all dead--I don't
think the elegance seal of approval applies to this sugar product.
Oh, and get _this_ one.  Kiss Mint for...  for... for... Etiquette. 
What the fuck?!?!  Do you turn into a Letitia Baldrige or Henry
Kissinger after chomping on a stick? Man, these Kiss Mint people
have really taken the phrase "truth in advertising" lightly.

=================================================================
TITLE: Alien i.D. (CD)
ARTIST: Kicking Giant
ADDRESS: K (Box 7154, Olympia, WA 98507)
PRICE: It goes for $11.00 post paid
Last year Kicking Giant gave us all the wonderful _Halo_ CD, which
was the first CD release by this previously cassette only duo. 
This year they give us their first "proper" album--as all the Brits
say--and it's pretty damn good.  Same minimalist setup of an
electric guitar a la Tae Won Yu and a stand-up kit drum setup a la
Rachael Carns.  But the sound seems to be much fuller for some
reason.  Better production?  I would say that has something to do
with it.  But not everything to do with it, since Tae and Rachel
are pretty damn talented sans the bells and whistles of production;
see them live to see what I mean.
     Standout tracks include _This Song_, _She's Real_ and _Lucky_. 
The one track that I could absolutely, positively do without is the
_The Town Idiot_ which is basically a spoken word piece by Sue P.
Fox with Kicking Giant providing the backup music.  It's disturbing
and interesting on the first listen.  But after that it gets stale
fast, and seems really out of place on this otherwise neat
collection of tunes.

=================================================================
TITLE: Booing: Ginger Ale (CANDY)
ARTIST: Kanebo
Unless the soda candy that you consume is cola flavored, it's bound
to suck.  This is the best evidence yet.  The package smells like
flat ginger ale _before_ you even open it.  The gum tastes like
some bastard concoction of maple syrup and ginger candy.  And mind
you Faithful Reader (tm), I actually like the way pure ginger candy
tastes.  This stuff just wreaks of bad over-sugary, syrupy gunk. 
Bleagh!  The gum itself comes in pretty big portions. And the
flavor last a real, real, real long time. Which would be a good
thing if its tasted okay.  But it doesn't taste like anything you
want to savor.  So this is _not_ a positive factor.  No sir.

=================================================================
TITLE: Popeye/Felix The Cat Notecards (MISC)
ARTIST: Graphique de France and the original artists
ADDRESS: Graphique De France (46 Waltham Street, Boston, MA 02118)
PRICE: They go for $1.50 each, but you can buy a whole box of 12
for $22, I think.
Let's face it.  Most greeting cards really suck.  The sappy, syrupy
shit that passes for prepackaged sentiments really makes me wretch
sometimes.  What to do?  Go get some blank cards.  Frankly, buy
only blank notecards.  Write your own damn greetings.  Its much
more personal and infinitely better as a result.  And a good place
to get some of the best notecards that I've seen come from this
place, Grahique de France.
     Slightly pretentious name aside, the cards that they make are
really neat.  Heavy stock paper, with really nice, heavy lines and
strong, saturated color.  What else would you want?  It also helps
that this company graces their cards with two of the coolest
cartoon characters ever made, Popeye the Sailor Man and Felix the
Cat.
     The Popeye line comes with neat portraits of the spinach
eating seaman himself, as well as the lovely Olive Oyl, the non-
sequiturish Jeep and that baby of babys, Swee' Pea.  The Felix the
Cat line is my personal fave, with scenes of Felix lounging,
dancing, painting, sleeping and laughing his ass off.  A damn fine
role model that Felix is, if you ask me.  Much better than those
Mighty Annoying Power Rangers.

=================================================================
TITLE: Pavement, Guided by Voices and David Kilgour (LIVE SHOW)
ARTIST: See above, buddy...
So there I am.  In the middle of the Roseland in lovely midtown
Manhattan.  The Roseland used to be a huge old dancehall; which
makes going to shows here really depressing.  You know, the whole
by-gone era and things like that thing.  Cool art-deco stuff, but
there's something haunting about it.  It seem's hollow in some way. 
But enough about that.  You want to know how the show was, right? 
Right...
     David Kilgour stunk.  Derivative, wall-paperish bulljunk, just
like most of the things that get played on many mainstream
"alternative" stations.  Guided By Voices was slightly better,
although I'll be the first to say that I just really don't like
them.  They're sound just doesn't click with me; live or on album. 
But I do have to give them credit for being one of the few bands I
can think of who brings a cooler filled with beer out on the stage;
and promptly takes it off the stage when they are definitely
leaving the stage. Oh yeah.  Kim Deal did a guest spot.  Supposedly
singing, but you couldn't really hear her, so the crowd mainly had
the pleasure of seeing Ms. Deal bob her head drunkenly on stage
with the rest of the Guided By Voices crew. Pinch me. But enough of
this sarcastic shit.
     Pavement came on, and they were really great.  Last time I saw
them, it seemed to be a pretty academic, paint-by-numbers set of
songs.  Not this time.  They were loose and on the ball in a big
way.  Steve was great.  So was Mark.  Heck, I even like Scott a
little more.  Fuck that, Scott was the best!  Songs included a
healthy dose of old stuff like _Debris Slide_, _Summer Babe_, _Two
States_, _Trigger Cut_ and _Box Elder_ as well as lots of new stuff
like _Silence Kit_, _Range Life_, _Elevate Me Later_ and _Cut Your
Hair_.  No _From Now On_.  No _Forklift_.  So I'd have to grade the
set an A minus.  But nitpicking aside, this was definitely one of
the more satisfying shows I've seen in a long time.

=================================================================
TITLE: Caught In Flux #3 (ZINE)
ARTIST: Mike Appelstein
ADDRESS: Caught In Flux (P.O. Box 7088, New York, NY 10116-7088)
PRICE: It goes for $2.00 post paid
Reading through this special  "How I discovered music" issue is
really a mind blower. Well, maybe mind blower is the wrong way to
describe it.  But basically by focusing on this one thing and
interviewing--or allowing the subject to write a short essay--Mike
has managed to add a different, and more thoughtful, twist on the
same old song and dance.
     We've all probably read interviews with Barbara Manning, but
did you know that she accidentally crushed her pet hermit crab
while going nuts at a screening of The Who's _The Kids are Alright_
when she was a kid?  Or that the ever-so-schmoozy Jessica Willis,
who does music reviews and interviews for the New York Press, has
secret dreams of being a slutty groupie?  Or that Indie-List and
Telegraph electronic publishing mogul Sean Murphy really has a
thing for Del Shannon's tunes?  Well, whatever. If I say anymore,
I'll destroy all the fun that contained in this zines pages.  But
I will tell you that other musical discovery moments are shared by
Jenny Toomey (Tsunami), Kristin Thomson (ditto, Tsunami), David
Nichols (Cannanes), Stuart Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Anne
Rubenstein (Comics Journal), Mark Eitzel (American Music Club),
Lois Maffeo (Lois, duh) and Mike Schulman (Slumberland).  Buy it,
or else I'm gonna have to get medieval on your ass.

TITLE: Sam Henderson (PERSON)
ARTIST: Sam Henderson
ADDRESS: Sam Henderson, The Cartoonist (14 Bayard Street #3,
Brooklyn, NY 11211)
Sam is one of the most prolific and productive mini-comic people
that I know of.  His mini, _The Magic Whistle_ is one of the few
consistently funny things one can buy for $2.00 nowadays.  So send
him $2.00 and he'll send you a copy.  Ask for #5 and you can read
the fake letter his roommate Mike wrote on his behalf to the
National Endowment for the Arts.  The first sentence of the letter
is "If you give me a grant of $6000 I will spend it on whores for
my friends and myself."  Let's wish him luck and hope he gets the
grant! This interview was done in August, 1994.
[SLAM]    When did you start drawing cartoons?
[S.H.]    I don't know when I started drawing cartoons.  But I've
          been self-publishing when I was 10.  I put out a book. 
          It was actually my elementary school that published it. 
          In junior high, I did comic called _Captain Spaz_, with
          my pal Bobby Weiss.  It was a super hero parody.
[SLAM]    Are you ever going to reprint that stuff?
[S.H.]    Well that was then, but I still might reprint it anyway. 
          I did do a reprint the first thing I did when I was 10.
[SLAM]    How did _The Magic Whistle_ mini-comic start out?
[S.H.]    Basically, before _The Magic Whistle_ I just did several
          mini-comics under different names and I eventually wanted
          to have some kind of identity and also a way people could
          easily keep track of what I was doing. Before that, there
          was no way that people could keep track of what I did.
[SLAM]    I remember also seeing that one mini-comic tribute you
          did on C3PO?  Where did that come from?
[S.H.]    We only made about 25 copies of that.  My roommate Mike
          Rex and I just did that in one night.
[SLAM]    That one was neat. I remember reading that and laughing
          my ass off in big way.
[S.H.]    We pretty much just gave the copies to Jim Hanely's
          Universe and a couple of other places.  My roommate is a
          real Star Wars nut, so we just thought up all of gags
          about C3PO one night.
[SLAM]    The one with the two kids cursing him out [VISUAL AID:
          C3PO is quietly walking down the street while two kids
          yell "Hey, C3PO!  Up yours!" and "I saw your mom naked,
          you dork!"]  It's so stupid yet it's so true.  That's
          exactly what would happen to him. And the thing is, that
          when I watch the Star Wars films now, I'm becoming more
          aware of what a real dork C3PO really was.  He was just
          the most useless character.
[S.H.]    The thing that spawned the mini was when Mike Rex did the
          one strip with C3PO dancing and going "Woo! Woo! Woo!"
          and this guy points at him and says "Hey!  Little Richard
          is inside C3PO."  And so I did the other one, and we just
          kept on rolling.
[SLAM]    Why did you decide to call the mini _The Magic Whistle_?
[S.H.]    I was just making up sitcom plots in my head.  I'm always
          doing stuff with stereotypes and cliches.  And I just
          came up with the idea of this sitcom where the lead
          character finds a magic whistle.  I just thought that was
          really funny at one point.
[SLAM]    It reminds me of that Sid and Marty Kroft _H.R.
          Puffinstuff_.  You know.  The magic flute that kid had.
[S.H.]    Yeah.  _H.R. Puffinstuff_.  H.R. supposedly stood for
          _H_and _R_olled.  There was thing in Film Threat about
          all the drug references in all of the Sid and Marty Kroft
          shows a couple of years ago.
[SLAM]    All of the Kroft stuff is screwed up.  Well, not the new
          stuff.  Like the new _Land of the Lost_.  The sleestacks
          suck in the new one.
[S.H.]    I haven't seen any of that stuff for about 15 or 20
          years.
[SLAM]    Just memories.
[S.H.]    Yeah and with all this seventies retro stuff, all these
          things are just coming back to me.
[SLAM]    Well, back to comics.  The _F Hat_ mini, where did that
          one come from?
[S.H.]    Actually, I saw someone in the street selling a hat with
          the word "Fuck" on it.  And I was wondering, what type of
          person would wear this?  And if he did, would everybody
          think he was a great person because he had this hat?
[SLAM]    Yeah.  That was the funny ending in that one.  Where
          everyone who was talking about how great the guy's hat
          was, turned around and said that they lied and it was all
          a big joke.  They were all making fun of him.  Even the
          guy who sold him the hat.
[S.H.]    That was kind of a cop-out ending.  I couldn't think of
          a way to end it.
[SLAM]    Yeah, but that's kind of like what would happen, in a
          paranoid sort of way.  I mean, did you see Adrian
          Tomine's letter in HATE?  The one where he told Peter
          Bagge that he bought a HATE hat and was walking around
          San Francisco with it and was getting all kinds of shit
          from people on the street?
[S.H.]    That hat's actually a big seller for Fantagraphics, now. 
          Just because of the word "Hate", even people don't buy
          the comic buy the hat because of that.
[SLAM]    Yeah.  I know tons of people who bought the HATE T-shirt
          just for that reason. But back to your stuff. What about
          the visual stuff. Like those wordless strips you have in
          _Nickelodeon Magazine_?
[S.H.]    The first one I did for them was originally in _The Magic
          Whistle_; the one with the guy and the animal taking each
          others eyes and noses off. I submitted a bunch of my
          stuff to Nickelodeon, most of it just being from my mini-
          comics, and many of them inappropriate for them to print.
          I just wanted to show them what I could do.  And that one
          being one of the only ones that wasn't dirty, I guess
          that's why they accepted it.  Then they asked me to do
          more stuff with those characters.
[SLAM]    That was a kick in the head for me.  I think I was in
          Penn Station flipping through _Nickelodeon Magazine_,
          when I saw your stuff.  Then I saw Mark Newgarden's
          stuff.  Then Kaz's stuff.  Even David Mazzucchelli had a
          strip in it, and I was going "What the hell is this?" 
          The comics section in it is great.  It's like the RAW for
          kids.
[S.H.]    An editor at magazine, Anne Bernstein, has done a few
          underground comics herself.  She went to school with Mark
          Newgarden and Kaz.  And I worked with Newgarden at Topps
          on few projects, so he hooked me up with Nickelodeon.
[SLAM]    What did you do at Topps?
[S.H.]    I did some concept art and writing.  Most of the things
          I did will never see the light of day.  But they put out
          some of the _Wacky Packages_ I wrote.  They also have
          another series called _Gruesome Greetings_.  And it was
          funny, because I did the roughs and the artists--who draw
          really realistically--just copied directly from my
          roughs.  So in the final product, it looks like my
          characters but they're three dimensional; done in
          acrylics, watercolors and everything.
[SLAM]    Here's a stupid question.  Where did you get your style
          from?
[S.H.]    Oh, just because I'm lazy.
[SLAM]    It's doodlish, but it's cool.  It reminds me a lot of
          Sergio Aragones stuff.
[S.H.]    Yeah, a lot of people compare me to Aragones.  Basically,
          when I started out in art school I was just trying to
          show how realistically I could draw and everything.  And
          these characters I do, I began to doodle them when I was
          on the phone.  But I realized with the type of humor I
          do, it's much funnier with my doodle style.  Which is
          quick and spontaneous.
[SLAM]    The stories are really great also.  You've done a few
          written, non-comic things.  Like _The Greatest Teen Movie
          Ever Made_, that's another thing I was laughing out loud
          to.
[S.H.]    There are things I do that are just funny without visuals
          at all.  I've always thought it would be just funny to
          write them out and let somebody else imagine what they
          would look like in their head.
[SLAM]    Well, with _The Greatest Teen Movie Ever Made_, if you
          put visuals to it, it would just ruin it.  If you grew up
          watching any of those teen flicks you don't need any
          visuals to laugh at it.
[S.H.]    Yeah.  A lot of people think I watch teen movies all the
          time.  Some people call me when there's something on.
[SLAM]    Like any of the _Porky's_ films?
[S.H.]    Basically.  It's not as much that I like these films and
          like to watch them, I'm just fascinated that they were
          even made at all. That people spent, more or less, a year
          of their lives working on these films.
[SLAM]    Do you ever see one now that you saw when you were a kid
          and thought was so great.  And then you watch it again
          and you're like "Shit!  I actually _liked_ this?"
[S.H.]    Actually, much entertainment I liked as a kid is like
          that.  I remember I was in eighth grade and when Porky's
          came out and everybody said "This was _the_ funniest
          movie."  And this one kid I knew who was allowed to see
          R rated movies, he was like telling everybody about how
          great it was.  It took him about five hours to explain
          how great a film it was.
[SLAM]    Was that where the strip where the guy is over-analyzing
          _Porky's_ in _The Magic Whistle_ #5 came from?
[S.H.]    Nah, that was more made up.  I don't think any eighth
          grader could come up with that kind of stuff.  It's just
          like my whole philosophy of being into stupid humor and
          this whole idea of intellectualizing something as stupid
          as _Porky's_.
[SLAM]    Well, then what do you think about the current trend in
          ultra-realism in comics.  Like Batman getting his back
          cracked in half.
[S.H.]    What?  Is that what happened?  I dunno.
[SLAM]    You don't know?  Well it's like everything is getting
          painfully ultra-realistic.  Like do you remember when
          Marvel did that special issue of Spider Man where his
          uncle molested him?  Or the Iron Man where Tony Stark was
          revealed to be an major alcoholic?
[S.H.]    Well, I read Marvels for a period, between '80 and '84. 
          So I'm not up on that kind of stuff anymore.
[SLAM]    Well, okay.
