  Welcome to issue four of the W.A.R.E.Z. Magazine..One quick introduction..

  Issue 4 and issue 5 were release a week ago, but were bad files and were
  taken off the W.A.R.E.Z. Issue list..at least issue 4 was..THIS IS THE NEW
  ISSUE 4..Issue 5 will be released in a little bit. Issue five will have
  some very good information in it for ansi bomb makers and phreakers.

  Okay, I am now going to tell you about a wonderful and FUNNY FUNNY experience
  I had on a BBS these past few months. Well I went under my undercover handle,
  (Hell, I have a billion of them) and heh, this time instead of those totally
  /<-rad 3133+ boardz flaming me, I actually got those "LAME PDBUTTFUCKS" flaming
  me. Hahahaha, now ain't that funny. Overlord, the totally /<-rad PDBUTTFUCK
  tried to actually flame me. Man-0-Man what is happening to the BBS World?
  Later on in this issue I will put in some actuall QUOTES that the people say
  to me. It's a total joke. For some reason, the f00lz think I am a 12 yr. old.
  Hahaha, then, this Overlord d00d finds out who I REALLY am and says,

  "Oh hey man, So I hear you guys (Me and another W.a.R.e.Z. Mag writer) are
  hackerz and phreakerz and stuff, is that true?"

  Then later he just says to me,

  "Hey man I wasn't trying to flame you or anything, I was just trying to find
  out who the hell you were!"

  Hahahha..so, the little /<-rad Overlord is getting a lil' scared eh..Why the
  fuck would he kiss my ass..only little L4m3rz would do that..Heh..

  Anyways, Sorry I couldn't pull out any txt for you to identify these fucking
  lamerz. But remember :
