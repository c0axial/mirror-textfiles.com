                  PART ONE--More iNFo oN THe WaReZ d00dz!
                  PART TWO--REAL hacking is NOT...blah blah

        I have come across an interesting point about thoze HaRD C0Re WaReZ
        d00dz...AGAIN..heh these guys never stop..what the hell is their pro-
        blem? Anyways, there was this KID, 13, maybe 14 years old. I have
        a board that is dedicated to H/P..yet, SOME (very little) warez. Well
        this little fucker thinks he is hard core, and tells everybody that
        he can get ANY THING for anybody..Well, any f00l could tell that this
        l00zer getz all his WaReZ from friends. Hahaha, so, he claims that he
        is NOT a lamer. This idi0t was flamed to hell on a PD board! Now who
        the HELL does he think he is? So, anyways this dumby posts a few
        messages on my board..He had posted a message, "Hey my board will be
        up from ?pm to ?am..nobody better hack it though."
        0h, isn't that like a prime target now for some LAME hacker to hack
        the shit outta his board? (See part 2 for more info on a "LAME" hacker.
        So, this other guy who is really into h/p stuff mentions to this kid,
        "HAHAHA, do you think somebody is really gonna hack your board? That
        is NOT what hacking is all about."

                Heh, next this c00l wanna-be WaReZ d00d, replied and said,
        "FUCK YOU! YOU LAMER!"
                HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHHAHAH!!!! Is that a joke or what? Now
        what did the other guy say for that kind of remark to be said back?
        NOTHING AT ALL! That is a TRUE TRUE TRUE sign of those FUCKING lameass
        WaReZ d00dz! That is what you will see in the message bases at ANY
        warez board (if there is a "lamer" on that board) It is sorta funny,
        you see the message base topic as maybe "Feedback to Staff" or "BBS
        ADS"/ heh then you say hey, lets take a look at some bbs ads...
        READ MSG 1...

        making jokes/storys about those lame l<-radz out there. But, there will
        be more issues to come! C-ya next time!
