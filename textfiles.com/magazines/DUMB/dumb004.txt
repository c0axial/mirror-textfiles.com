        as if you couldn't tell, i'm really really bored.  i can't think of
 anything better to do, so i'll just release several issues of dumb.  why?
 because i can.  har.  har. 

        oh yeah.  this story is another result of sitting in creative 
 writing.  guess what i got on this one;  a 95!

        ernie knew it was time to get funky when he whipped out his delux
 pla-do factory toy set from inside the toy chest. 

        red pla-do, green pla-do, orange pla-do, yellow pla-do, blue pla-do, 
 the specially combined ultra pla-do mix of dull purple, the happy rainbow
 pizza shop pla-do factory machine  -  all there.  bewn.  time for some 
 serious pla-do action.

        spitting in his palm, ernie dug right into the pla-do.  shaping, 
 forming, crushing, and destroying.  ernie mixed, matched, shredded and tore. 
 pla-do was all over the walls, the floor, and the windows.  it got in 
 ernie's mouth, hair, and ears.  the pla-do was _everywhere_. 

        "mommy." ernie hollored down the stairs.

        "yes dear."

        "uh.  nothing."

        once again ernie ravashed the pla-do.  creating and destroying like
 he was some kind of angry god.  red stars, purple balls, green diamonds,
 orange pla-do people  -  all passed through ernie's hands, only to die as 
 they were crushed, minced, and shredded in the pla-do factory.

        "MOM!" ernie yelled once again.

        "yes dear."

        "uh.  is it lunch time yet?"

        "no dear."

        "grrr," he muttered "i'll just eat some pla-do!"

        grabbing up scoops of pla-do, ernie began stuffing his face. "yom, 
 yom, yom."
