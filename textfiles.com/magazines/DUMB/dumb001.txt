                            dumb issue number 001.  
               
               "irc  -  you're not missing anything." by, mogel

        look.  it's like dumb... and stuff.  don't get me wrong, this 'zine, 
 if you want to call it that, is nothing really serious.  basically all it 
 does is provide me with a place to put some of my writing that i don't think
 is fit for a real 'zine.  as if.  if anyone else would like to put some of 
 their writing that they don't think is fit for any other 'zine  -  it's all
 good.  i'm not picky, i'll put just about _anything_ in here.  don't look 
 forward to a lot of issues, this is just a little side project of mine.  
 there will be _no_ rules, no set dates when it will be released, none of 
 that jazz.  it's just "dumb".  

        oh.  thank you mogel you big lub muffin for letting me use this as
 the first dumb article.  w00.  
 
 belial  -  are you going to hump that?
