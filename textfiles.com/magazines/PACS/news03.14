WALTON RESIGNS AS CLSI PRESIDENT
 
Bob Walton, President of CLSI, has issued the following
statement:
 
     This is to announce that on August 4, 1992, I tendered my
     resignation as President of CLSI, Inc. to Michael J.
     Timbers, President and CEO of IHS Group.  I will continue to
     serve as President until October 9, 1992.
 
     After serving as CLSI President for over two years, the
     timing of my departure follows the fulfillment of the three
     primary objectives I set out to accomplish: CLSI has re-
     established a very strong and aggressive financial position
     to enable it to aggressively continue to compete for new
     business and to invest in new products in an increasingly
     competitive library automation marketplace.  Secondly,
     significant improvements in CLSI's customer and field
     service operations are establishing a new standard in the
     industry.  And, most recently, CLSI has successfully
     introduced the new, second generation LIBS 100plus software
     into active service in representative libraries in each of
     CLSI's primary markets--the United States, Europe, and
     Australia.  While I have enjoyed my time in New England, the
     timing of my departure also reflects the desires of my
     family to return to the West.

     During my tenure at CLSI, I have had the privilege of
     working closely with hundreds of CLSI customers.  I am
     indebted to those librarians who have contributed
     significantly to improving my understanding of and
     appreciation for customer service which is, of course, the
     objective of our efforts at CLSI.  I am happy to report that
     I now count many of these professional colleagues as
     personal friends.
 
     Certainly, I am indebted to the loyalty and enthusiasm I
     have witnessed by CLSI managers and staff.  Without
     question, they have contributed the lion's share of talent
     and resources resulting in CLSI's turnaround and recent
     successes.  In particular, Jim Hofbauer, who previously
     served with me as Executive Vice President, will continue to
     lead CLSI's forward movement in his new capacity as CEO.
     Having worked closely with Jim since the summer of 1990, I
     am very confident that given his understanding of the CLSI
     and IHS Group organizations, combined with the management
     talents and insights he has demonstrated during the last two
     years, CLSI will safely continue to grow as a leading
     company in the library automation industry.
 
     My immediate plans are to begin a long overdue vacation,
     relocate my family, and seek new employment in some
     meaningful capacity in the service of libraries and their
     patrons.
 
In a related announcement, CLSI confirmed that James A. Hofbauer
had been promoted to President and CEO of CLSI and noted that:
 
     The Office of the Executive structure provided CLSI the
     opportunity to have two senior managers, Bob Walton and Jim
     Hofbauer, work closely together and learn from each other on
     a daily basis.  Decisions were made with mutual input since
     both co-managed CLSI.
