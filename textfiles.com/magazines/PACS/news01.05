JOINT CATALOG AND INDEX ON CD-ROM
 
Auto-Graphics, Inc. and EBSCO Electronic Information have
announced a project to provide access to a library catalog and
periodical articles through a single CD-ROM workstation.  From a
single menu, library patrons can search for books and other
materials in the CD-ROM catalog using Auto-Graphics' IMPACT public
access catalog, or search for information published in over 300
periodicals indexed and summarized by EBSCO's Magazine Article
Summaries (MAS).  A local holdings feature allows libraries to
identify whether the library receives the magazines.  Testing of
the system is being conducted by the Orange County (CA) Public
Library and the Baltimore County (MD) Public Library.  For more
information contact: Tim Collins, EBSCO (800-221-1826), or Joel
Lee, Auto-Graphics (800-325-7961).
