NOTIS PACLINK RELEASED FOR TESTING
 
NOTIS Systems has shipped its Z39.50-based PACLink software for
testing.  Indiana University, Bloomington; Indiana State
University; the State University of New York at Binghamton; and
the State University of New York at Stony Brook will test the
software.  PACLink is scheduled for general release in the first
half of 1992.
 
Utilizing PACLink, users will be able to select a remote NOTIS
OPAC from a menu, search it using local OPAC commands, and
retrieve results formatted according to local OPAC conventions.
PACLink utilizes the NISO Z39.50 standard, Information Retrieval
Service Definition and Protocol Specification for Library
Applications, and TCP/IP Internet connectivity.  It is
anticipated that a future release of PACLink will permit linkage
to non-NOTIS OPACs that utilize Z39.50.  Other planned
enhancements include patron-initiated ILL requests and the
ability to search several remote NOTIS catalogs simultaneously.
