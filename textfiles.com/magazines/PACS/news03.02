UMI/Data Courier and the Research Libraries Group (RLG) announce

As part of the agreement, RLG and UMI will offer users access to
full-text article delivery of UMI's Article Clearinghouse
collection of 12,500 titles.  Delivery options include
first-class mail, express courier, fax, and Ariel, RLG's new
proprietary document-delivery system that enables high-resolution

BLACKWELL AND CARL WILL DEVELOP SYSTEM LINKS
 
Blackwell North America and CARL Systems, Inc. have announced a
system development effort that will make several Blackwell
services accessible through the CARL system in 1992:
 
     o    Access to Blackwell's NTO (New Titles Online) database
          enriched with abstracts and tables of contents.
 
     o    Electronic ordering of materials from both Blackwell
          North America and B. H. Blackwell Ltd.
 
     o    Electronic distribution of LC MARC cataloging enhanced
          with tables of contents and processed through
          Blackwell's authority control system.
 
     o    An interface to CARL's System Authority Control Module
          that will provide several services, including
          retrospective conversion, immediate updating of new
          records, and maintenance of CARL files in constant
          accordance with current LC practice.
 
The Internet will be used to connect systems from the two
vendors.

UPDATE ON EFF ACTIVITIES
 
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is currently advocating that:
 
     o    Congress establish an open telecommunications platform
          featuring Personal ISDN.
 
     o    The open platform be created with legislative
          safeguards that ensure a level playing field for all
          those competing in the information services market.
 
     o    The NREN serve as a testbed for new voice, data, and
          video services that will eventually be offered over our
          National Public Network.
 
     o    Electronic bulletin boards be afforded the same First
          Amendment protections enjoyed by other media.
 
     o    Citizens who use computers for communications purposes
          be  afforded the full protection of the Fourth
          Amendment.
 
     o    An Electronic Freedom of Information Act be passed that
          will grant citizens access to the electronic version of
          public information consistent with the public's right
          to know.  Technical means be mandated to insure the
          privacy of personal communications carried over
          cellular and other radio-based communications systems.
 
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is also a co-sponsor (along
with the Consumer Federation of American and the ACLU) and the
principal coordinator of the Communications Policy Forum, which
is designed to explore the means for achieving the communications
goals of consumer organizations.  Over 28 consumer groups, from
the OMB Watch to the NAACP participate in forum activities.  The
Communications Policy Forum is funded by foundations as well as a
diverse group of computer and communications firms.

Washington, was established a year and a half ago by Mitchell
Kapor, who started the Lotus Development Corporation, and John
Perry Barlow.
