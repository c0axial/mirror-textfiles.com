-----------------------------------------------------------------

The 1990s offer libraries significant opportunities for
developing innovative computer systems--powerful computer
platforms and sophisticated software tools have become
affordable, and they continue to drop in price and improve in
performance.
     How can libraries take advantage of this opportunity?  Grant
funding offers one way to foster innovation, and, for large-scale
projects, it may be essential; however, there are limited
opportunities to secure such funding and many small projects may
not warrant it.  When grant funding is sought, the library's
proposal is strengthened if it can demonstrate prior effort and
expertise in the proposal area.  Every opportunity to secure
grant funding should be seized; however, libraries should not
limit themselves to this funding option.  Here are some brief
guidelines for encouraging technical innovation without depending
on grant funding.

     (1)  Cultivate staff technical expertise and encourage
          interdepartmental cooperation.  As computing and
          networking technologies evolve, the effective
          application of these technologies in libraries requires
          a considerable breadth and depth of technical
          expertise.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for a
          single staff member to master all relevant aspects of
          these technologies; a team approach is often required.
               Typically, libraries have small systems
          departments that provide a core of technical expertise.
          Increasingly, staff in other departments are mastering
          computing tools that have direct relevance to their job
          duties.  These technical experts should be encouraged
          to broaden and deepen their skills through academic
          courses, training seminars, and self-study
          opportunities.  As the budget permits, libraries should
          provide leave time and funding for technical training
          opportunities, and they should formally recognize the
          acquisition of technical skills for promotion and
          tenure purposes.

+ Page 20 +

               Libraries should encourage experts in different
          departments--and at different levels of the
          organization--to work together on technical projects.
          Matrix project management can be challenging; however,
          it can also create productive new bonds between staff
          that have both short- and long-term benefits.

     (2)  Provide seed money for pilot projects. [1]  Libraries
          do not need to invest massive amounts of money to make
          progress; however, they do need to establish a
          technical innovation fund that staff can tap to create
          small-scale pilot projects.  Although a variety of
          funding strategies are possible, a straightforward
          approach would be to allocate a fixed budget for this
          purpose at the start of the fiscal year and to use it
          to fund projects that have a predetermined maximum
          funding ceiling.  At this stage, funding a number of
          small projects is preferable to funding a few very
          expensive ones.
               A simple procedure for requesting funds should be
          established that encourages administrators to make
          swift decisions.  Librarians should complete a brief
          proposal form that provides project objectives and
          benefits, a timetable with a firm completion date,
          staffing needs, and required hardware and software.
               Given budget constraints, not every meritorious
          project can be funded.  The goal is to fund enough
          proposals to produce a few projects that show
          significant promise.

     (3)  Build on success.  Some pilot projects will have an
          immediate payoff; they can used as is without further
          development effort.  Additional money may or may not be
          required to implement the system.  For example, a
          library may want to install a microcomputer-based
          reference advisor system at different service desks and
          public-access clusters throughout the library.  If the
          appropriate hardware and software is in place to
          support the system, no additional funds will be
          required to implement it.  If not, needed hardware and
          software will have to be purchased.

+ Page 21 +

               Other pilot projects will show promise, but will
          require additional money, time, and effort to reach
          fruition.  Often this is because the task is more
          complex than anticipated.  If they are not so
          complicated that they defy solution, complex problems
          are good problems--the systems that solve these
          problems are likely to have significant benefits.
          However, hard problems are usually best approached by a
          successive approximation strategy: solve one part of
          the problem at a time, accepting the imperfection of
          each interim solution, until the whole problem is
          solved.

     (4)  Reward effective innovation.  The efforts of staff who
          develop successful systems should be rewarded.  If
          system development activities are recognized when
          decisions are made about merit pay increases,
          promotion, and tenure, more staff will be interested in
          engaging in these activities.  Other types of
          recognition are also effective, including institutional
          awards and publicity in library publications.

     (5)  Accept failure.  The hunt for the guilty when a project
          fails accomplishes little, but it does make other staff
          reconsider taking risks in the future.  If the resource
          investment in pilot projects is kept small, little is
          lost.  Often valuable lessons can be learned from
          failure: dead ends are identified, new avenues of
          inquiry may be revealed, and parts of the failed system
          may form the core of a successful, new effort.

With the proper encouragement, staff can develop systems that
improve library operations; however, to foster technical
innovation, libraries must prudently invest scarce resources and
take calculated risks.

1.0  Introduction

As an increasing amount of diverse material is made publicly
available on campus computer systems, universities face some
provocative new areas of concern.  When the University of
California at Berkeley's Information Systems and Technology (IST)
department began developing its Infocal campus information
service, we were fully aware of the headlines of the time: porn
on the Internet, racist jokes in newsgroups, and constant
copyright violations.  We saw it as an important responsibility
to develop Infocal so that the University's vulnerability to
legal action and adverse publicity was minimized.
     In short, we decided that we needed a formal information
policy for Infocal, and we established it by means of an advisory
committee. [1]  In July 1991, the committee finalized its
recommendations.  These recommendations have been implemented,
and it has been reassuring to know that they provide a solid
basis for guiding the operation of the system.

2.0  Infocal

We call Infocal an "information service" instead of a campus-wide
information system (CWIS) because these systems can have far more
functionality than we are dealing with.  Someday our campus may
develop a coherent, integrated, comprehensive CWIS, but Infocal
is not that system.  What we wanted to build was simply a vehicle
for the online distribution of information.  As John Kunze [2]
described in a prior article, the decision to use Z39.50 to
communicate with other servers complicated things a bit, but the
basic Infocal concept was a simple one.

+ Page 5 +

     We envisioned a distributed system with multiple servers.  A
campus unit might choose to have its own server because IST
didn't have enough disk space or because the unit wanted to
administer their server independently.  Other servers would be
administered by other institutions, including other campuses,
libraries, software vendors, and value-added data vendors.  Local
clients could query these servers, and the queries could pass
through one server to another.  For example, one choice within
Infocal might be to access a departmental server.
     Infocal queries might come from multiple types of clients.
A new client could be built because a new computer platform was
acquired or because a specialized user interface was required.
Users could employ clients that met their needs.  Communicating
via the Z39.50 protocol, the client could query the server,
irrespective of client/server differences in platform,
administrative authority, or originating source.
     For example, a user might employ a menu-driven client,
running on a UNIX workstation, to query many servers, including
MELVYL--an OPAC that runs on an IBM mainframe.  (The Infocal
server currently runs under Ultrix on a DEC 5900.)  The user
would view MELVYL through his or her client, and it might not
look very much like native MELVYL.  Another user might be
querying the same servers for the same information from a
graphical user interface (GUI) client running on a Macintosh.  In
turn, MELVYL devotees might be viewing the information on Infocal
through a MELVYL-oriented client.  We expected users to want
their clients to behave as much like their normal computing
environments as possible.

3.0  Defining the Problem

There were two principles that we established early on, which
helped to restrict the policy areas we needed to worry about.
First, Infocal would be, for the users, a read-only system.  Only
authorized information providers could post information.  This
decision has kept us out of issues that proved troublesome for
many bulletin boards.  Second, we always intended to have a
client/server arrangement, with our server connected to other
servers through the network.  Consequently, we confined our
efforts to our own server--we never tried to establish policies
for all servers in the University.

+ Page 6 +

     The advisory committee concurred with our early ideas about
the scope of Infocal: it was for the distribution of
"institutional information"--information distributed by the
University as well as information needed by the University for
its own internal business purposes.  Under the former heading is
material such as class schedules, campus job listings, and public
notices.  The second category might include material from outside
the campus (e.g., course catalogs from other UC units or a
suitably licensed dictionary) or access to external systems.
This definition excludes, for example, a faculty member's
thoughts on 18th century French economics; however, we would
encourage the faculty member (or his or her department) to use
our software to set up another server to distribute this
information.
     Within the Infocal environment, we also envisioned a
distributed data provision system where campus units would be
responsible for providing and updating data that "belonged" to
them; these units would have considerable influence about the way
their data appeared on Infocal clients.  Since most campus
information is originally entered on computers, this seemed to
present the possibility of achieving wider information
dissemination without great additional effort by the originating
units.  However, we would need to be able to use information in
many different file formats (e.g., word processing and database
management system formats) and from many kinds of computers
(e.g., PCs, Macs, and various mainframes).  Information would be
provided both by network transmission and by dial-up access.  In
a service with so much distributed responsibility, it would be
easy to let anarchy reign and find ourselves quickly mired in
inappropriate, inaccurate, out-of-date, or incomplete
information.
     Thus, we had a situation in which policies were clearly
important, but there was no obvious avenue to establish those
policies.  Infocal was a bootstrap operation, which meant that we
had to identify, define, and seek resolution to problems on our
own.  There was no higher level authority saying "thou shalt" or
"thou shalt not."  This independence was exhilarating; however it
was desirable to have rules to guide our actions.  We did not
want to be perceived as acting capriciously, either by acting as
censors or by establishing inappropriate priorities.  Computing
centers have less experience than libraries in dealing with
difficult information provision issues.

+ Page 7 +

4.0  The Advisory Committee

Probably the most important step I took was to ask my superior,
former Vice Provost Curtis Hardyck, to set up an advisory
committee drawn from various parts of the University to address
Infocal issues.  This was an ad hoc committee consisting of eight
members, six from the Berkeley campus and two from the UC Office
of the President.
     In suggesting possible committee members to the Vice
Provost, we sought two kinds of expertise: first, people who knew
and understood existing university policies, and, second, people
with significant experience in the public dissemination of
information.  Most of the committee members had little experience
with computers, but this wasn't a problem.  Although we
frequently had to explain certain technical aspects of Infocal,
all of the committee members contributed important perspectives
and experience.
     The committee members were from the following UC units:

          Berkeley campus:

               Academic Senate
               Business and Administrative Services
               Human Resources and Public Safety
               Information Systems and Technology (Chair)
               Legal Affairs
               Public Information Office

          UC Office of the President:

               Division of Library Automation
               Office of the General Counsel

Two lawyers on the committee were unable to attend our meetings
regularly, but they did attend when the agenda seemed to require
them.  Despite the logistic difficulties introduced by having the
lawyers on the committee, their involvement was of great value
since we would have felt far less secure moving forward using
policies that had not undergone informed legal scrutiny.  Also,
the lawyers were able to educate us about the legal basis for
some University policies that would otherwise have been
unfathomable.

+ Page 8 +

     For example, a strict uniformity of application underlies
many University rules.  Legal vulnerability is minimized if the
University can demonstrate that the same rules apply to all
outside organizations.  Thus, if we do not allow local record
stores to advertise their wares on Infocal, we cannot allow local
computer vendors to place ads.  However, if a campus department
like IST chooses to announce that a computer vendor is giving a
demonstration, this becomes institutional information under the
sponsorship of that department.
     Of the other committee members, one left the University
toward the end of our deliberations and was not replaced; another
became too busy with other things and sent a replacement.  The
choice of committee members from such diverse units stood us in
good stead because upper-level administrators were reassured by
having representation on the committee.
     The committee members felt that the most critical
requirement was a statement of purpose, and we spent most of our
time working on that.  The statement of purpose has proven to be
more effective than I had expected, and it has helped to define
priorities.  The final section of the statement, which promotes
the use of compatible software and standards, was a little
difficult for the nontechnical committee members to support.  As
it turned out, their difficulty with this was truly a matter of
misunderstanding, not of disagreement, and, on two occasions,
technical briefings resolved this problem.
     Once the statement of purpose was settled, the other parts
of the recommendations were more easily written.  As a result of
this process, the committee became concerned about the education
of information providers, especially about what constituted a
real data security issue.
     The committee also made some recommendations regarding the
maintenance of good relations with information providers.  These
are not reflected in the formal recommendations, but we try to
follow them in spirit.  I was particularly pleased that the
committee spontaneously chose to include a paragraph regarding
the quality of the online information, since I had imagined this
to be a truly obscure (though important) point.

+ Page 9 +

5.0  Issues

The following are the areas of concern that the committee felt
needed attention; another institution may have a radically
different list.

     o    Audience: Who was our audience?  Just the UC Berkeley
          campus or the entire UC system?  Did our audience
          include the affiliated labs (Lawrence Livermore,
          Lawrence Berkeley, and Los Alamos), University
          Extension, and other units?

     o    Control: How much control over the information was in
          our hands and how much was in the hands of the
          information providers?  Were we merely in an advisory
          role, or could we say "No"?  Conversely, could we
          insist on posting information despite its "owner's"
          resistance?  Would we want to?

     o    Quality: We were increasingly convinced that the
          accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and authoritative
          value of the information were the most compelling
          factors in the success of a campus information service.
          Could we ensure the quality of Infocal information?

     o    Confidentiality: We didn't have to worry about truly
          confidential material, such as grades or payroll data,
          but what about borderline privacy issues, such as home
          telephone numbers?  This issue included the privacy of
          the user of the information, an important area in its
          own right, but one that is beyond the scope of this
          article.

     o    Legality: There were numerous legal issues, including
          disclaimers of liability, censorship, and theft of
          proprietary material.

     o    Taste: Since Infocal wasn't a bulletin board-type
          system, there would be minimal opportunity for
          demonstrating bad taste, unless a known information
          provider was malicious or careless.

     o    Commercial information: What about commercial
          information?  We knew that we wouldn't be running
          advertisements, but what about milder forms of
          commercial involvement, such as the announcement of a
          demonstration put on by a computer vendor?

+ Page 10 +

     o    Priorities: How should our work on different datasets
          be prioritized so that our limited resources were used
          wisely?  Whose needs should come first?  IST?  The
          campus?  The UC system?

     o    Policies: What about the application of existing
          policies?  Like any other large university, UC had
          existing policies on just about everything that
          predated computers.  How much of the existing canon
          could be of use in this new context?

     o    Adequate computing power: What about potential system
          overload?  The crippling load experienced by McGill's
          Archie system in its early days indicated that this was
          not a frivolous concern.

     o    Connections to other servers: When a request was
          redirected via Z39.50 to another server, our clients
          would alert the user that a redirect was occurring.
          Was that all that we should do about it?

The committee's recommendations, which address these issues, are
presented in Appendix A.  Some issues deserve additional
discussion.
     Our intended audience has not been explicitly defined, but
the statement of purpose makes it clear that the priorities are:
(1) UC Berkeley, (2) the rest of the UC community, and (3) the
public.
     We haven't run into real problems with any information
provider as to whether certain information should be made
available online or not, so this is another area that will have
to be worked through in the future.
     From our perspective, all we can do about the quality issue
is to take care that the source and date of the information are
conspicuously included in Infocal.  If we aren't comfortable
about a potential information provider, we may have to recommend
that they run their own server.
     Generally, we have managed to stay a few steps ahead of the
information providers on sensitive confidentiality matters such
as home telephone numbers--we have identified the problem, done
some research, and developed a proposal before the information
provider realized that the problem existed.
     If a campus unit takes responsibility, commercial
information becomes "institutional information," thus avoiding
the nonuniform application of University rules.

+ Page 11 +

     To help set priorities, we are setting up a second advisory
committee, intended to be an ongoing one, whose primary purpose
will be to identify and assess proposed datasets and determine
implementation priorities.  One of the secondary charges to this
committee is to extend the work done by the previous committee as
new areas of concern are identified and as the needs of the
campus change.
     Finally, when users connect to another server, we will
notify them that they're leaving Infocal.  There is no way to
require another server to identify itself accurately, nor is
there any way to require other clients to present any particular
information.

6.0  Conclusion

Although Infocal is not yet available over the network (due to
our inability to fully support it with current staff), we have
released a pilot version on dedicated library terminals, as a
joint venture with the campus library.  The pilot release
initially contained the class schedule, the campus telephone
directory, a listing of job vacancies, a list of faculty
research funding opportunities, and the IST newsletter.  Each of
these datasets is carefully tended and updated by the
organization providing it, and several are definitely superior to
their printed versions because they are up-to-date.
     We did run into some unpredictable problems just as the
pilot version was released because, at the same time, the
Registrar's Office ran out of printed class schedules and the new
campus dial-in registration system was overloaded.  This happened
just before the beginning of fall semester, and it put an
immediate load on the pilot release, which was suddenly the only
source of this timely and essential information.
     We haven't run into any new areas of concern that were not
anticipated, but I'm sure that we will.
     Given our experiences, I strongly recommend that any
institution planning a CWIS develop appropriate policies early in
the process.  Establishing a formal policy was more important
than we realized at the outset, and involving other campus units
in policy making was an immensely valuable byproduct of the
process.  The committee's deliberations occurred simultaneously
with the technical development of Infocal.  They didn't hold up
progress, and having the policies in place has enabled us to move
quickly.

     Berkeley is a campus where every group is vocal, empowered,
and demanding.  Berkeley lives up to its reputation; however,
it's not a unique situation.  In these times of tight budgets, a
computer center doesn't expect to satisfy all of its users, but
it doesn't want to alienate them either.  IST's Infocal
information policy has enabled us to walk this tightrope with
some comfort and confidence.

Appendix A.  The Advisory Committee's Recommendations

Statement of Purpose

The server and clients administered and maintained by IST
(Information Systems and Technology) have the following purposes:

     (1)  To distribute institutional information to the Berkeley
     campus community, and secondarily, to other UC campuses.
     This includes information from IST as well as from other
     campus academic and administrative units.

     (2)  To make institutional information that is applicable
     for wide distribution, such as job listings, publicly
     available online.

     (3)  As budgets allow, to distribute to the campus and UC
     communities UC business-related information of wide utility,
     including proprietary information such as a dictionary,
     where licensed for this purpose and method of distribution.

     (4)  To encourage other campus units, UC campuses, and
     external institutions and organizations to use compatible
     software and standards in developing servers of their own.

Policies regarding the content and administration of the
information resident on the IST server are described separately.

Information Policies

General Comments

Any given server may be administered by any set of policies--as
other campus units develop their own servers they may choose to
follow different policies regarding the information on their
servers.  The policies below apply specifically to the IST
Information Server.  Both the policies and the guidelines that
follow were determined by an Advisory Committee drawn from
several Berkeley Campus and Office of the President units.
     The content of this server is to be in accordance with all
relevant UC and Berkeley Campus policies.  Different policies
will be more or less applicable to individual information
providers, but the following policies should certainly be
considered:

     o    University staff policies regarding what is public
          information and what is not;

     o    University policies regarding employee organizations;

     o    University policies regarding politically-oriented
          material;

     o    University policies regarding commercial advertising
          and vendor relationships;

     o    University policies regarding protection of copyrighted
          or proprietary material.

IST will actively seek legal advice when questionable issues
arise.


Policies Regarding External Servers

Information may come to campus users from other servers as well.
On the advice of General Counsel's office, a disclaimer will be
displayed by IST user interfaces when information comes from a
server that is not an institutional University of California
server.  The administrator of any external (i.e., non-IST) server
is responsible for its contents.

Guidelines for Units Providing Information

Each participating department will need to consider for each
piece of information whether it is appropriate online, and
determine and follow an internal approval and authority process.
If the information is also to be made available on paper, perhaps
when the printed version is approved, the (matching) online
version may be automatically approved.  However, there may be
situations in which separate approval steps are necessary, for
instance, if the two versions differ significantly, or if the
provider is not convinced of the wisdom of offering the
information online.
     In other situations, information is intended to be made
available only online, and providers will need to develop
internal procedures to handle its review and approval.  For
example, does your department consider an "electronic signature"
to be the equivalent of a written signature?  Do those in the
department who would need to be involved in the review process
have ready access to computers?  Internally, IST has followed the
premise that information to be viewed online should be reviewed
online as well.
     It is also important that the editorial and quality control
process applied to online information be as rigorous as that
applied to printed information.  Spelling and other errors are
just as unacceptable online as on paper, even though they may be
repaired more quickly.  Online information raises new quality
control issues as well; for example, information may be expected
to be more up-to-date than printed material.


Things to Consider

     (1)  Each information-providing unit should consider what
          level of access is appropriate for each piece of
          information, and inform IST accordingly.  The following
          are the three levels of access available:

               (a)  All information will be available to known
                    Berkeley campus network hosts.  This includes
                    networked personal computers, workstations,
                    and shared systems.  Anyone with a user
                    account on any campus host, including the IST
                    shared systems, will have access to the
                    information.  Users from off campus who have
                    such accounts will also have access to this
                    information.

+ Page 15 +

               (b)  A more limited set of information will be
                    available to hosts (as described above) known
                    to be on any UC campus, the Office of the
                    President, the labs, etc.

               (c)  The most limited set of information will be
                    available to anyone who can dial in or access
                    the server over the network.  This means
                    basically anyone.

     (2)  Each information-providing unit should consider the
          frequency with which they might update their
          information, and inform IST accordingly.  A given piece
          of information might be subject to updating hourly,
          daily, or monthly.  A very stable set of information,
          such as a unit's newsletter, might not be subject to
          updating at all--when it is published, it is published.

     (3)  Each information-providing unit should consider the
          life span of a given piece of information.  To use the
          unit's newsletter example again, the unit might wish to
          make the most recent six issues available.  A balance
          should be maintained between making only the most
          recent information available versus using the server as
          an archive.

     (4)  Information providers should keep in mind that
          restrictions on viewing this material are no more
          secure than restrictions on account access (login name
          and password) and on the underlying network.
          Individuals with valid access to campus-only material
          may inappropriately share that access with others.  The
          server is no place for restricted or confidential
          information.
               On the other hand, the integrity of the
          information itself is fairly well protected.  No one
          except the known information provider will be able to
          change or install it, so information providers have the
          responsibility of protecting passwords and other write-
          access restrictions themselves.

Problem Resolution

     (1)  When problems of inappropriate information come to
          IST's attention, IST will attempt to resolve them
          through normal University channels.  However, if the
          problems seem to be unresolvable, or recurring, IST
          will cease putting that particular information on the
          IST server.

     (2)  In the future, some campus departments may decide to
          act as sponsors for information coming from other
          agencies such as student groups, user groups, etc.  Any
          campus department that chooses to do this will be
          responsible for the appropriateness of the other
          group's information, and should carefully consider
          University policies, including those mentioned above:

               o    University staff policies regarding what is
                    public information and what is not;

               o    University policies regarding employee
                    organizations;

               o    University policies regarding politically-
                    oriented material;

               o    University policies regarding commercial
                    advertising and vendor relationships;

               o    University policies regarding protection of
                    copyrighted or proprietary material.

If there is any doubt about adherence to these or other
University policies, the sponsoring department should consult
with the appropriate campus authorities for clarification.
Again, if problems appear that are unresolvable through normal
University channels, or are recurring, IST will cease putting
that particular information on the IST server.

Appendix B.  CWIS Resources

There are many more resources about this topic now than there
were when our advisory committee was formed.  The following is an
informal list of some other resources that we have found
valuable.

     o    The CWIS-L@WUVMD list distributes ideas and experiences
          on many relevant topics.  This is also a good place to
          ask questions about specific concerns.  To join this
          list, send an e-mail message to LISTSERV@WUVMD that
          says: SUBSCRIBE CWIS-L First Name Last Name.

     o    ACM's SIGUCCS (Special Interest Group on University and
          College Computing Services) often has presentations on
          related topics at its fall User Services Conferences.
          In particular, see: Timothy J. Foley, "Developing a
          Computing and Information Policy," in Proceedings ACM
          SIGUCCS User Service Conference XVIII (New York:
          Association for Computing Machinery, 1990), 127-130.

     o    The Coalition for Networked Information and EDUCOM are
          two organizations that focus on these issues:

               Coalition for Networked Information, 1527 New
               Hampshire Ave., N.W., Washington, DC 20036, (202)
               232-2466.

               EDUCOM, 1112 16th Street, N.W., Suite 600,
               Washington, DC 20036, (202) 872-4200.
