A Gateway Between the World-Wide Web and PAT: Exploiting SGML
Through the Web

     By John Price-Wilkin (pp. 5-27)

This technical paper discusses how the World-Wide Web can be
linked to the PAT system, Open Text's search engine that supports
access to SGML-encoded documents.  This Web-to-PAT Gateway
utilizes the Web's Common Gateway Interface (CGI) capability and
SGML-to-HTML filter programs.
     After briefly overviewing key technical concepts, the paper
explains the operation of the Web-to-PAT Gateway, using several
examples of how it is employed at the University of Virginia
Libraries, including access to text files such as a Middle
English collection, the Oxford English Dictionary, and the Text
Encoding Initiative's Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange.
