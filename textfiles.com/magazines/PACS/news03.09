PACS REVIEW ALSO AVAILABLE IN PRINT FORM
 
The first volume of The Public-Access Computer Systems Review is
now available as a printed book.  The volume has just been
published by the American Library Association's Library and
Information Technology Association (LITA).  LITA will publish the
second volume of the PACS Review in the near future.  Walt
Crawford produced camera-ready copy for the volume using Ventura
Publisher and he also indexed the volume.
 
At the urging of the PACS Review Editorial Board, the University
of Houston Libraries published the print annual in order to
provide wider access to the journal, especially for individuals
who do not have network access.  The electronic version of the
PACS Review will continue to be free, and all article files will
still be available at LISTSERV@UHUPVM1 (the print version
provides instructions for retrieving these files).  Any revenue
from the print volume will be used to help support LITA
activities.
 
Volume one has an in-depth symposium about staffing issues and
public-access computer systems, plus a special section on SPIRES
that describes how this system is being used for locally mounted
databases and campus-wide information systems.  It also has
articles about Carnegie Mellon University's Library Information
System II and other innovative library automation systems, text
management software, CD-ROM LAN implementations and network
licensing agreements, Z39.50, and other topics; columns by Walt
Crawford and Martin Halbert; and book reviews.

VTLS DEVELOPS PROTOTYPE ELECTRONIC ENCYCLOPEDIA
 
Supported by a grant from BRA BOCKER (publishers of the Swedish
National Encyclopedia), VTLS has developed a prototype electronic
encyclopedia.  A Hewlett-Packard 3000 computer acts as a server
for the full-text file, which is accessed from VTLS Intelligent
Workstation clients.  In the future, images will also be
accessible.  Users can access the encyclopedia via the VTLS OPAC.
Hypermedia links permit users to find related materials in the
library's collection.
