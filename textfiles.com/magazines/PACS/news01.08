UNCOVER GATEWAY ESTABLISHED IN MINNESOTA
 
The Minnesota State University System's Project for Automated
Library Systems (MSUS/PALS) has announced an agreement with CARL
Systems, Inc. to establish a Gateway to provide access to CARL
System's UnCover database.  UnCover provides access to nearly one
million journal articles, from over 9,500 individual titles with
access current within 24 hours of issue receipt.  The agreement
will make UnCover available to the network of 44 Minnesota state
universities, community colleges, private colleges and State
Agency library members of MSUS/PALS.

IAC DATABASE ACCESS EXTENDED TO CARL USERS OUTSIDE COLORADO
 
The Information Access Company and CARL Systems, Inc. have
reached an agreement which allows other CARL System users or
Gateway participants with proper license agreements to access any
IAC databases on the CARL System.  Currently available through
the CARL System's Public Access Catalog are Magazine Index (TM)
and Trade & Industry Index (TM).  Linked to these databases are
online full-text articles from IAC's Magazine ASAP (TM) and Trade
& Industry ASAP (TM).  Users of the CARL System can search the
online indexes, locate articles of interest, and then order those
articles to be delivered, either online to the screen or offline
through telefacsimile.

Users are able to charge their document delivery orders using
VISA or MasterCard numbers, which are entered online to the CARL
System and validated immediately through a major Denver bank.
Access to the IAC databases have been available to Colorado users
since April of this year.  This recent agreement allows both
organizations to extend this access beyond Colorado, providing
appropriate system usage and database license agreements have
been reached.

agreements, contact Todd Miller at IAC, 362 Lakeside Drive,
Foster City, CA 94404 (415-378-5200).  For more information about
