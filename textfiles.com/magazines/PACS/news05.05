UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI OFFERS NETWORKED ACCESS TO JOURNAL
CITATIONS THROUGH OCLC SITESEARCH

The faculty, staff and 61,000 students of the four campuses of
the University of Missouri now have networked access to journal
citations through OCLC SiteSearch software.  Four elements were
key in the selection of OCLC SiteSearch for this project: OCLC
SiteSearch complies with the Z39.50 protocol; it provides the
level of control needed; OCLC's options for licensing OCLC
SiteSearch offer maximum flexibility; and the Newton database
engine provides the indexing and searching power required for
these types of databases.

Initially, the University of Missouri is mounting four databases:
Expanded Academic Index, Legal Resources Index, Business Index
from Information Access Corporation, and Current Contents from
the Institute for Scientific Information.  On the client side,
the University of Missouri has licensed the FirstSearch
interface, the Z39.50-compliant interface developed by OCLC for
its FirstSearch service.  Future plans will be based, in part, on
user response, determined through surveys and focus groups.

+ Page 2 +

The OCLC SiteSearch system provides retrieval software based on
client/server architecture using the Z39.50 communications
protocol--the same software used for OCLC's online products.
With OCLC SiteSearch, libraries can offer one interface to local
databases and the 44 databases available through FirstSearch.
Libraries may choose to use the FirstSearch interface or any
other Z39.50-compatible client interface.  OCLC SiteSearch is
available for the following UNIX platforms: IBM RS/6000, SunOS
and Sun Solaris, DEC Ultrix, DEC Alpha.  The software is licensed
on a per-user site-license basis.

OCLC AWARDS THREE RESEARCH GRANTS

The OCLC Office of Research has awarded three Library and
Information Science Research Grants (LISRG) to university
researchers for 1994.  The grant recipients and their projects
are:

o    Alexandra Dimitroff, Ph.D., assistant professor, and Dietmar
     Wolfram, Ph.D., assistant professor, University of
     Wisconsin-Milwaukee Graduate School:  "Hypertext
     Bibliographic Retrieval: A Comparison of Linkage
     Environments."  This research will investigate the
     effectiveness of different types of hypertext linkages in
     two hypertext-based information retrieval systems for
     bibliographic records.

o    Karen M. Drabenstott, Ph.D., associate professor, and Amy J.
     Warner, Ph.D., assistant professor, University of Michigan:
     "End-user Understanding of Subject Headings."  The purpose
     of this project is to study end-user understanding of
     subject headings.

o    Lei Zeng, Ph.D., assistant professor, Kent State University:
     "Developing Control Mechanisms for Intellectual Access for
     Discipline-based Virtual Libraries--A Study of the Process."
     This study proposes to identify basic and important
     considerations as part of the process of developing such
     control mechanisms; to explore new approaches in knowledge
     organization; and to present a model which demonstrates one
     of the approaches for developing such mechanisms.

The OCLC Library and Information Science Research Grant program
awards grants of up to $10,000 to help foster quality research by
faculty in schools of library and information science.  Projects
are generally completed within one year, and findings are
published in the OCLC Research Report series and in the public
domain.  Application materials for 1995 are now available.

SMART VALLEY, INC., IS MAKING PUBLIC ACCESS A REALITY IN SILICON
VALLEY

In conjunction with the recent announcement by the Clinton
Administration that it is making federal government and White
House information publicly available over the Internet, Smart
Valley, Inc., announced Smart County Public Access Network
(SCPAN), a project chartered with developing and installing
Internet public access sites throughout Santa Clara County.  With
the objective of realizing the concept of an "information
superhighway" at a local level, SCPAN will provide public access
to tools, information, and services available on the global
Internet, in addition to a variety of local community services
and information.

SCPAN sites will be located in public libraries, city and county
administrative centers, and retail outlets throughout Santa Clara
County, and will provide users with high speed connections to the
Internet and the ability to access information using applications
such as Mosaic, MacWeb and Lynx.  Smart Valley's collaborative
partners in the SCPAN project include:  Andersen Consulting,
Apple Computer, Cisco Systems, Enterprise Integration
Technologies, Pacific Bell, Regis McKenna, the South Bay
Cooperative Library System, SVPAL, and Tele-Communications Inc.
(TCI).

The City of Palo Alto's vision of local public access was
realized in February 1994 when it became the first city in the
nation to provide its citizens with full, two-way leading-edge
Internet capabilities via Mosaic and using high-speed
telecommunication lines.  The City of Palo Alto WWW Server
provides worldwide access to a myriad of local information,
including a directory of city government, a map of downtown Palo
Alto and its highlights, CalTrain schedules, Chamber of Commerce
information, local news, and access to the Stanford University
server.

OCLC CONTINUES RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION OF TITLES FROM UNIVERSITY
OF OXFORD

The OCLC retrospective conversion of some 1.8 million titles from
the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, is running quite
smoothly in its third month, according to Maureen Finn, director
of OCLC's conversion and contract cataloging services division.
The Oxford project involves the conversion of titles from the
Bodleian Library's post-1920 collection.  The collection includes
a full range of subjects and Roman-alphabet languages.  OCLC's
highly trained operators will attempt to find a matching record
for each of these titles in the OCLC Online Union Catalog, using
its RETROCON service.  Records for which no match is found will
be created through OCLC's Conversion Keying service.  The project
began in July and is expected to take four years to complete.  By
1998, the Oxford University catalog will be fully automated.

THE CARNEGIE LIBRARY OF PITTSBURGH RECEIVES NTIA FUNDS TO BUILD
PHOTOGRAPHIC DATABASE AS PART OF LOCAL CONSORTIUM

In collaboration with Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh (CK:P), The
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh will be participating in a project
to create a database of photographic images from the Library's
Pennsylvania Department which will be available via the World
Wide Web (WWW or Web) on the Internet.  CK:P is a joint project
of the Pittsburgh Public Schools, the University of Pittsburgh,
and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.  The group received
$551,000 from the Department of Commerce, National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, to
electronically link three Pittsburgh schools, the Hill House and
The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and the Internet.  The
database will also be available to library patrons through the
computer terminals located in The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
as well as local municipal libraries as they become connected to
the Allegheny County Library Electronic Information Network.

As part of the grant, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh will
receive Web server equipment, software, communications equipment,
and a very high speed internet connection.  An extensive
collection of materials on the history of Pennsylvania is located
in the Pennsylvania Department, Main Library, Oakland.  The
Department also houses the Pittsburgh Photographic Library, a
collection of over 57,000 negatives and prints offering a visual
history of Pittsburgh.  Through this grant-funded project, a
portion of these visual images will be scanned and made available
on the Internet by mid-1995.

FOUR BOOK VENDORS NOW SIGNED ON TO PROMPTCAT SERVICE

Academic Book Center, Baker & Taylor, and Blackwell North America
have agreed to collaborate with OCLC to offer PromptCat, a new
OCLC service that will automatically provide cataloging copy to
libraries for approval plan and firm orders.  They join Yankee
Book Peddler, the first vendor to agree to participate in OCLC's
PromptCat service, which OCLC will introduce in spring 1995.
With PromptCat, when items are sent to a library, the vendors
will notify OCLC electronically.  OCLC will automatically
transfer cataloging records (via cards, tapes, electronic
dataexchange, or the PromptCat file on PRISM) to the library and
add the library's holding symbol to specified records in the
Online Union Catalog.

For more information, contact: Pam Kircher, (614) 764-6459,
pam_kircher@oclc.org.


OCLC MEMBER LIBRARIES CAN NOW SUBMIT CORRECTIONS TO ONLINE UNION
CATALOG THROUGH INTERNET ELECTRONIC MAIL

OCLC member libraries are now submitting corrections to the OCLC
Online Union Catalog through Internet electronic mail.  The new
Electronic Error Reporting service is designed to complement
existing error reporting mechanisms, allowing libraries to choose
the option that best fits their own internal workflow.  Using two
different report forms--one to report nonbook duplicate records
and one to report all other kinds of changes--member libraries
can fill in the basic information, describe the recommended
action and send the reports in a matter of minutes.  OCLC online
data quality control staff members monitor the account throughout
the day and changes may be made the same day the library
identifies the need.

An instruction file and the two reporting forms are available
through electronic mail from OCLC's listserv.  To retrieve this
information through Internet e-mail, address the message
to:listproc@oclc.org.  Then type the "get" command in the body of
the e-mail message, followed by the file name.  To get the
Electronic Bibliographic Change Report, type the
"bib.change.report" file name; type the "dup.report" file name to
get the Electronic Duplicate Report; and type the
"bib.instructions" file name to get Instructions for OCLC's
Electronic Error/Duplicate Record Reporting.

+ Page 7 +

An informal survey posted last spring on AUTOCAT, an Internet
listserv, found the majority of respondents favored the idea of
allowing errors to be reported by Internet electronic mail.  OCLC
tested the concept during the summer with volunteers from five
libraries.
