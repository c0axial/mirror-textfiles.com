NOTIS DEMONSTRATES Z39.50 INTEROPERABILITY
 
On June 4, 1992, NOTIS Systems, Inc. demonstrated full NISO
Z39.50 Version 2 interoperability with the Coalition for
Networked Information (CNI) test bed site at the University of
California's Department of Library Automation (DLA).  As part of
the test, the NOTIS client exchanged standard Z39.50 protocol
elements with the DLA server and performed several intersystem
searches.  Since that time NOTIS has interacted successfully with
servers at OCLC, AT&T, UC Berkeley, Penn State, and M.I.T.
 
Z39.50 is the standard for communication between computers for
information retrieval.  It provides for the retrieval of
bibliographic records independent of the type of system on which
they are stored.
 
For information contact Jane Burke, NOTIS, 1007 Church Street,
Evanston, IL  60201-3622, or call (708) 866-0170.

NOTIS ANNOUNCES INFOBASE AND PACLINK
 
NOTIS Systems, Inc. has announced InfoBase, an information
storage and retrieval system for UNIX-based computer systems that
offers a cost-effective means of mounting and accessing local
databases.  It uses a full-feature search engine built on Z39.50
communication protocols.  The system provides multiple
simultaneous users with access to local databases stored on CD-
ROM or magnetic media.  The search engine supports Boolean,
proximity, and adjacency search functions.  It is compatible with
NOTIS online catalogs and includes a hook to serials holdings for
citation databases.
 
PACLink interconnects a library's OPAC to other libraries'
holdings through an OPAC to OPAC connection, and it automatically
processes requests for document delivery and interlibrary loans.
PACLink is fully integrated into the current OPAC, and it
communicates with remote libraries using Z39.50 via TCP/IP on the
Internet.
 
PACLink was developed in cooperation with the state universities
in Indiana and the graduate centers of the State University of
New York (SUNY).
 
For more information, contact Jane Burke, NOTIS, 1007 Church
Street, Evanston, IL  60201-3622, or call (708) 866-0170.

SYRACUSE PUBLISHES STUDY ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE INTERNET
 
Syracuse University's School of Information Studies announces the
availability of a year-long study investigating the role of
public libraries in developing and exploiting the next generation
of national networks embodied in the Internet/NREN.  The study
was funded in part by OCLC's Library and Information Science
Research Grant Program.  Public Libraries and the Internet/NREN
was written by Charles McClure, Joe Ryan, and William Moen.

ZEN AND THE ART OF THE INTERNET, 2ND EDITION
 
The second edition of Zen and the Art of the Internet: A
Beginner's Guide has been published by Prentice Hall.  Zen is
primarily written for people who are comfortable with computers,
but may not have had much, if any, exposure to networks in
general.  No one operating system is targeted; it's purposely
"operating system-neutral."
 
Zen discusses how to decipher domain names; e-mail basics; what
telnet is and what's available using it; Usenet news; FTP &
Archie; the various services that are on the Internet; and a
variety of other topics.
 
The second edition offers roughly 30 pages of new information,
and every page has been rewritten or changed in some way.  It has
a more complete glossary than the first edition, an extensive
bibliography, and a number of other reference features.
 
Zen costs $22, and its ISBN is 0-13-010778-6.  Discounts are
available for large quantity and educational orders.
 
For more information or to offer comments on either edition,
please contact: Brendan Kehoe, Sun Network Manager, Widener
University, guide-bugs@cs.widener.edu.
