DATA RESEARCH LINKS DISPARATE SYSTEMS WITH Z39.50
 
Data Research Associates, Inc. has connected a DEC VAXStation
3100 running VMS 5.4 and prototype DRA software to two systems:
(1) a DECSystem 5810 running ULTRIX 4.2 at the University of
California, Berkeley, and (2) an IBM 3090 running MVS/ESA and the
MELVYL software at the University of California's Division of
Library Automation.  In each case, a MARC record was successfully
retrieved from the server system.
 
DRA President Michael J. Mellinger said: "While many vendors have
made widely varying claims concerning Z39.50, this represents
what is to the best of our knowledge the first connection using
this protocol of a commercially available system with a disparate
system."

THREE MORE WILSON INDEXES AVAILABLE ON FIRSTSEARCH AND EPIC
 
Business Periodicals Index, Wilson Business Abstracts, and
Humanities Index have been added to OCLC's EPIC and FirstSearch
Catalog systems.
 
Business Periodicals Index (July 1982-) and Wilson Business
Abstracts (July 1990-) provide citations and abstracts for 345 of
the leading English-language business magazines.
 
Humanities Index (February 1984-) contains citations from nearly
350 journals and magazines.
 
Readers' Guide Abstracts and Readers' Guide to Periodical
Literature were mounted on FirstSearch and EPIC in December.
 
The following Wilson indexes will be added to FirstSearch and
EPIC later this year:  Applied Science & Technology Index, Art
Index, Bibliographic Index, Biography Index, Biological &
Agricultural Index, Book Review Digest, Cumulative Book Index,
Education Index, General Science Index, Index to Legal
Periodicals, Library Literature, and Social Sciences Index.
 
The FirstSearch Catalog enhances the Wilson databases by
attaching holdings symbols of libraries that subscribe to the
journal to each citation retrieved.

OCLC SERIALS UNION LISTS AVAILABLE ON CD-ROM
 
The 9,868 libraries that have serials union lists on the OCLC
Online System can now receive their lists on CD-ROM as well as on
paper, microfiche, or tape. The Serials Union List serves as the
public access catalog of serials holdings for library groups.
 
The CD-ROM version gives librarians and library users various
levels of searching sophistication and up to five scoping levels
(e.g., searching within their department, library, city, state,
or regional group).  It also offers an optional link to the OCLC
Interlibrary Loan Subsystem so that users can place ILL requests
which librarians process through the OCLC system.

PAIS DATABASE AVAILABLE ON OCLC REFERENCE SERVICES
 
PAIS, the Public Affairs Information Service database, is now
available on OCLC's online reference services, the FirstSearch
Catalog and EPIC.  The complete index is available on EPIC and
the last 10 years, PAIS Decade, is available on FirstSearch.
 
The Public Affairs Information Service indexes over 1,400
periodicals, specialized journals, books, agency reports, and
statistics.  Its scope is the public policy aspects of business,
economics, government, public administration, law, international
relations, and other social sciences.
 
The PAIS file on EPIC contains over 340,000 records.  PAIS
editors describe the contents of indexed items, providing
abstract-like contents notes for most of the records.  PAIS
includes documents in six languages--English, French, German,
Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.  Documents in non-English
languages are indexed with English-language terms and
mini-abstracts in English.
