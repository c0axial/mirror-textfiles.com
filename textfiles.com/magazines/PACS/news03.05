DIRECTORY OF ELECTRONIC JOURNALS, NEWSLETTERS, AND ACADEMIC
DISCUSSION LISTS (2ND EDITION) PUBLISHED BY ARL
 
Responding to the library and academic communities' increasing
use of and interest in the burgeoning number of electronic
publications, the Association of Research Libraries has published
the second edition of its hard-copy Directory of Electronic
Journals, Newsletters, and Academic Discussion Lists (ISSN
1057-1337).
 
The Directory is a compilation of entries for 769 scholarly
lists, 36 journals, 80 newsletters, and 17 "other" titles
including some newsletter-digests--an increase in size of close
to 50% since the first edition was published in July 1992.  The
directory provides specific instructions for electronic access to
each publication.
 
The Directory includes a reprint of scientist Stevan Harnad's
visionary description of "scholarly skywriting" originally
published in The Public-Access Computer Systems Review (volume 2,
number 1) as "Post-Gutenberg Galaxy: The Fourth Revolution in the
Means of Production of Knowledge."

Author/compiler of the journals and newsletters section is
Michael Strangelove, Network Research Facilitator, University of
Ottawa.  Diane Kovacs of the Kent State University Libraries
created the scholarly discussion lists and interest groups
section.   The printed ARL directory is derived from widely
accessible networked files maintained by Strangelove and Kovacs
(see below).
 
The Directory is produced in 8 1/2" by 11" paper-bound format.
Scholarly lists are grouped by broad subject areas, and journals
and newsletters are in alphabetical order.  The Directory is also
available in either DOS or Macintosh 3.5" diskette form.
 
The publication is available to ARL member libraries for $12.50
and to non-members for $25.00.   These charges include domestic
postage and handling.  All countries outside North America pay
additional postage.  All orders must be prepaid and sent to the
Association of Research Libraries.  ARL can supply an order form
via e-mail.

ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION OFFERS
GRAPHICS
 
The Journal of Technology Education, launched three years ago as
a refereed scholarly print journal, has initiated simultaneous
publication of an electronic edition with its first issue of
1992.  The new publication includes graphics--one of the first
electronic scholarly journals to do so.
 
The current issue of the journal, which is published twice a year
by the Technology Education Program at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, is now available in electronic
form without charge via Bitnet and Internet.  The text of the
journal's articles are offered in ASCII format, which is
traditional for many network-based electronic journals.  A single
graphic illustration of one of the articles is available as a
separate PostScript file.  In the future, more graphic
illustrations will be offered.
 
JTE, as the journal is known, is co-sponsored by the
International Technology Education Association and the Council on
Technology Teacher Education.  The electronic version is
published with the cooperation of Virginia Tech's Scholarly
Communications Project, which earlier this year initiated the
publication of an electronic version of the 20-year-old print
journal Catalyst.
 
To become an electronic subscriber of the JTE, send the following
e-mail message to LISTSERV@VTVM1 (BITNET) or to
LISTSERV@VTVM1.CC.VT.EDU (Internet):
