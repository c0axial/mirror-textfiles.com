NEW PACS-L MODERATOR
 
Charles W. Bailey, Jr., who founded PACS-L in 1989 and has served
as its Moderator since, has resigned from that post.  Mr. Bailey
will continue to act as Editor-in-Chief of The Public-Access
Computer Systems Review and as Co-Editor of Public-Access
Computer Systems News.  Mr. Bailey also co-edits Advances in
Library Automation and Networking.  He said: "The scope and
complexity of the services offered on PACS-L has grown
significantly since the conference was founded.  It has been an
honor to serve as PACS-L Moderator, but it is time to focus my
energies on editorial duties and other professional activities."
 
Dana Rooks, Assistant Director for Administration at the
University of Houston Libraries, has been appointed as PACS-L
Moderator.  Jill Hackenberg will continue as the Associate
Moderator of PACS-L.
 
Ms. Rooks has served as Co-Editor of the Public-Access Computer
Systems News since its inception and became Associate Editor,
Communications for The Public-Access Computer Systems Review this
year.  She instituted and has coordinated the Texas Conference on
Library Automation since 1982.  In addition, she holds an
appointment as Adjunct Professor with the University of North
Texas Graduate School of Library and Information Sciences.
 
Ms. Rooks has presented a number of papers and has published
widely in the areas of human resources management and
organizational development as related to the effects of library
automation.  Her book, Motivating Today's Library Staff: A
Management Guide, was published by the Oryx Press in 1988.  She
has reviewed manuscripts for many of the leading library journals
and has served on the ALA/RASD Publications Committee.

She was selected to participate as a member of the UCLA Senior
Fellows Program this past summer.  Active in professional

ALA/RASD Collection Development and Evaluation Section.
 
Prior to joining the University of Houston, Ms. Rooks served as
Head of Public Services at the University of Missouri, St. Louis
and Head of the Undergraduate Library at the University of
Oklahoma.  She holds an M.L.S. from Louisiana State University
and an M.A. in Public Administration from the University of
Oklahoma.
 
Ms. Rooks said: "As Charles moves on to other endeavors, I will
attempt to justify his trust and your hope that Jill and I will
continue to meet the standards for quality, timeliness, and
relevance which Charles established for the conference.  So as we
begin this transition, keep those comments, concerns, questions
and issues coming in to PACS-L.  Jill and I will do our best to
continue the traditions, explore some new horizons, and
hopefully, serve as able successors."
 
 
NAL PICKS INFOSTATION FOR MULTIMEDIA PROJECT
 
The National Agricultural Library (NAL) has selected the VTLS
InfoStation to link full text, images, and audio information to
the NAL online catalog.  The project will allow a library patron
in a remote location to access and print records in the NAL
database that have been linked to full text, image, and sound.
 
The InfoStation, configured on a NeXT computer, serves as a front
end to the VTLS library system running on a Hewlett-Packard 3000
computer.  It supports high-resolution graphics in black and
white and in 12-bit/24-bit color, overlapping transparent images,
and high-fidelity sound.
 
Initially, the hardware for the NAL project will comprise three
public access InfoStations linked together using a local area
network.  The hardware will be configured to provide 10,000 pages
of scanned black and white images, 1,000 color images, 10 seconds
of recorded voice per scanned page, and 2,500 characters of text
per page for each scanned image.
