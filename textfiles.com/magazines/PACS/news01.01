AAAS and OCLC to Pursue Electronic Publishing
 
The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and
the OCLC Online Computer Library Center have agreed to pursue a
joint electronic publishing venture.  AAAS is the country's leading
general scientific organization, with over 132,000 individual
members and nearly 300 affiliated scientific and engineering
societies and academies of science.  AAAS publishes two journals,
Science and Science Books & Films, as well as scientific books.
OCLC is a nonprofit computer library service and research
organization whose computer network and products link more than
10,000 libraries in 39 countries.
 
"By merging the editorial capabilities of AAAS with the
computerized delivery capabilities of OCLC, we are moving to the
forefront of electronic publishing," said Dr. K. Wayne Smith,
President and Chief Executive Officer of OCLC.  "We are working
with a new mode of publication that is primarily, not secondarily,
electronic.  We believe it will benefit both the individual
information users, who are members of AAAS, and the institutional
information users, whose libraries are members of OCLC."
