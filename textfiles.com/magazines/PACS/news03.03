ESTABLISHED PRINT JOURNAL IS ALSO OFFERED AS FREE E-JOURNAL
 
CATALYST, a refereed print journal that has been serving
community college educators for more than twenty years, will be
distributed as an electronic journal in addition to its print
version.  Subscriptions to the electronic version of the journal
are now available free of charge via BITNET and the Internet,
according to Dr. Darrel A. Clowes, editor of the journal and a
member of the faculty at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University.
 
The quarterly journal is published by the National Council on
Community Services and Continuing Education, an affiliate council
of the American Association of Community, Junior and Technical
Colleges.  The journal is being made available in its electronic
form by the Scholarly Communications Project of Virginia Tech.
 
Initiated in 1971, CATALYST is the second oldest continuously
published journal in the community college field.  It publishes
practitioner-oriented articles on practices in
continuing/community education as delivered by community
colleges, including papers on research in the field.  CATALYST
currently is distributed in print form to dues-paying members of
the Council, as a benefit of their membership, and to libraries
and other non-members at subscription prices of $20 per year in
the U.S., $25 outside the U.S.
