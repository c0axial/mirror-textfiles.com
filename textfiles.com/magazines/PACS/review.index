              Five-Year Index to The Public-Access
              Computer Systems Review (1990-1994)

                    By Charles W. Bailey, Jr.

The Public-Access Computer Systems Review (PACS Review) is an
electronic journal about end-user computer systems in libraries.
It is distributed at no charge on the Internet and other computer
networks.  The journal publishes papers on topics such as
campus-wide information systems, CD-ROM LANs, document delivery
systems, electronic publishing, expert systems, hypermedia and
multimedia systems, locally mounted databases, network-based
information resources and tools, and online catalogs.  It is
published by the University of Houston Libraries.
     The PACS Review was established in 1989.  The first issue
was published in 1990.  The journal became refereed in 1991; the
first refereed paper was published in 1992.
     The PACS Review has two sections: Communications (papers
selected by the Editor-in-Chief and the Associate Editor,
Communications) and Refereed Articles (papers that are peer
reviewed by Editorial Board members using a double-blind review
procedure).  The PACS Review also includes columns.  It is
published on an irregular basis.  Issues may contain a single
article or multiple articles.
     The PACS Review is associated with the moderated PACS-L
list, which serves over 9,020 users in 69 countries.  (There is
also a PACS-L USENET feed that serves a large number of users.)
PACS-L was founded in 1989 by Charles W. Bailey, Jr.; it is
currently moderated by Dana Rooks, Jill Hackenberg, and Linda
Thompson.  PACS-L users have an automatic subscription to the
PACS Review.  To join PACS-L, send the following e-mail message

A second list, PACS-P, was established in 1991 for libraries and
other users who want to receive the PACS Review and other PACS-L
publications, but who do not want do receive messages from PACS-L
users.  The PACS-P list serves over 2,910 users in 55 countries.
To join PACS-P, send the following e-mail message to

The first four volumes of The Public-Access Computer Systems
Review are also available in book form from the American Library
Association's Library and Information Technology Association
(LITA).  The price of each volume is $17 for LITA members and $20
for non-LITA members.  All four volumes can be ordered as a set
