CARLYLE INTRODUCES IMAGEOPAC
 
As part of its new Voyager Series of library automation systems,
Carlyle has introduced a new product called ImageOPAC.  The
system features state-of-the-art image and scanning technology
and provides quick access to digital images associated with
bibliographic records, allowing linked images to display on the
screen of an online catalog terminal or workstation.
 
ImageOPAC uses true color scanning to allow photographs, maps, or
other visual materials to be scanned online.  Searching for
images is done with Voyager's graphical user interface (GUI),
which incorporates multiple windows, pull-down menus, and
powerful database searching.  After retrieving a set of records,
the user can display any record as well as the associated image.
The system supports zooming and panning, reductions,
enlargements, and image cropping.  Edited images can be saved to
a PostScript file for printing.
 
For information, contact Sabina Ahmed, Carlyle Systems, Inc.,
415-345-2500.

WLN EASY ACCESS SYSTEM AVAILABLE THROUGH INTERNET
 
Easy Access is a new searching interface to the WLN online
system.  It combines and reduces the dozens of sophisticated WLN
commands to a few essential search types.  Easy Access assists
the untrained or infrequent user in searching the WLN database.
 
The WLN database currently contains nearly 7.5 million
bibliographic records--in all formats and a broad range of
languages--and over 16 million holdings.  The cost of accessing
the WLN system through the Internet is $15.00 per hour.  Credit
card billing is available.  Easy Access is also available by
dial-up and from leased-line workstations.
 
To access WLN, type TELNET WLN.COM or 192.156.252.2 at your
system's prompt.  Then just follow the instructions.

(206) 923-4000; or info@wln.com.
 
 
TWO NEW OCLC DATABASES PROVIDE ACCESS TO JOURNAL ARTICLES
 
OCLC has introduced two new tools on the FirstSearch Catalog and
the EPIC service: ContentsFirst (a serials table-of-contents
database) and ArticleFirst (a database of article citations).
 
ContentsFirst contains the complete texts of the table-of-
contents pages of over 80,000 issues of 7,000 serial titles, most
of which are in English and have been published since January
1990.  It is updated daily, with information for the most
frequently published titles going online within 48 to 72 hours of
publication.  ContentsFirst contains each publication's entire
contents page, including news stories, editorials, reviews, and
letters to the editor, in the subject areas of science, fine
arts, engineering, health sciences, business, humanities, and
social sciences.
 
ArticleFirst, which contains 1 million citations for the articles
in the same 7,000-title database, can be searched by subject or
author across the whole database.
 
Libraries holding the journals cited in ArticleFirst will be
listed from the holdings of the OCLC Online Union Catalog.
ArticleFirst can be searched in 18 different ways, including
author keyword, author phrase, title keyword, title phrase,
abstract keyword, journal title keyword, journal title phrase,
article type keyword, and publication date.

The ContentsFirst and ArticleFirst databases will expand to over
11,000 titles and will grow by 1 million articles per year.
Document ordering and delivery service will be available for
articles found in ArticleFirst.  Ordering information, including
delivery methods (e.g., fax, overnight delivery, first-class
mail, and overseas mail) and the payment options (i.e., credit
cards and account numbers) will be displayed on the screen, and
searchers can enter the appropriate information to receive the
articles promptly.
 
 
RLG DEVELOPS Z39.50 SERVER FOR INTERNET USE
 
The Research Libraries Group (RLG) has developed a Z39.50 server
for searching its RLIN and CitaDel databases, and 14 institutions
nationwide have now successfully tested the server over the
Internet.  The Z39.50 server, when fully implemented, will make
it easier for users of other online catalogs to search RLG's
databases.
 
Z39.50 is a national standard (ANSI/NISO Z39.50) for computer-to-
computer information retrieval that enables users to search other
online library catalogs and information sources using the same
commands they use to search their local online catalog.

VTLS TO CREATE VIRGINIA ONLINE UNION CATALOG
 
Virginia State Library and Archives has contracted with VTLS Inc.
for the CAVALIR ONLINE Database Creation Project.  The aim of the
project is to create an online union catalog containing holdings
of all participating libraries in the State of Virginia.

CAVALIR is the first stage in the implementation of the Virginia
Library and Information Network (VLIN).  More than 2.8 million
records of selected Virginia colleges, universities, and public
libraries will be loaded in the first phase, which is scheduled
for completion by March 1993.
