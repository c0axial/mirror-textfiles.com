VIRTUAL REALITY CONFERENCE
 
The 1st Annual Virtual Reality Conference will be sponsored by
Meckler, December 10-11, 1990, at the Cathedral Hill Hotel, in
San Francisco.  "Virtual Reality:  Theory, Practice and Promise"
will explore the science, art, and philosophies of the emerging
field of computer generated artificial reality, cyberspace, and
virtual reality.  Sessions are planned to provide an integrated
overview of virtual reality that includes its fantasy, research,
societal implications, and potential for commercial application.
 
The three major components of the conference will focus on theory
--the ideological and philosophical as well as the scientific,
cognitive, and psycho-social principles; practice--presenting
actual virtual environments; and promise--future development and
implementation in a variety of applications.  The cultural
implications of widespread usage of virtual reality will also be
discussed.
 
Registration is $195 per day before November 30, $225 thereafter,
or $380/$430 for both days.  For information or to register call
toll free 800/635-5537 or 203/226-6967 or write Meckler
Conference Management, 11 Ferry Lane West, Westport, CT 06880.

NOTIS STARTS JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF Z39.50 LINK
 
NOTIS Systems have announced their participation in a joint
effort with Indiana University and the State University of New
York to develop host-to-host linkage software based on the Z39.50
standard.  Called PACLink, the software will allow a NOTIS OPAC
user at one site to have a seamless connection to the NOTIS OPAC
at another site.
 
Included in the project are six NOTIS installations in Indiana:
Ball State, Indiana State, Indiana, Purdue Universities, and the
Universities of Evansville and Notre Dame, as well as the State
University of New York at Binghamton, Buffalo, and Stony Brook.
 
Initial testing of the software is expected by the second half of
1991.  The PACLink software will eventually allow any NOTIS site
to connect to any local system supporting the Z39.50 standard,
thus enhancing opportunities for cooperative collection
development and resource sharing.
 
For additional information or a functional description of PACLink
contact Stuart W. Miller, NOTIS Systems, Inc., 1007 Church
Street, Evanston, IL 60201-3622, or call 708/866-0171, FAX
708/866-0178.
