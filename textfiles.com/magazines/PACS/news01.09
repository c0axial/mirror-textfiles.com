NOTIS LINKS LIBRARY HOLDINGS WITH LOCALLY-MOUNTED DATABASE
RECORDS
 
NOTIS Systems, Inc. has announced the successful completion of
the beta test of Release 1.1 of its Multiple Database Access
System (MDAS).  MDAS allows NOTIS system users to search locally-
mounted databases with the same commands that they use to search
the online catalog.  In the new release, a user can search a
locally-mounted database, then display local location, call
number, order status, and holdings information for linked records
in the OPAC.  For example, a user could retrieve a citation for a
journal article, then display information from the OPAC about the
journal the article is published in.
 
MDAS Release 1.1 also allows users to print formatted citations
from locally-mounted databases along with the linked information
from the OPAC, and it offers redesigned screen displays.
 
MDAS currently supports the following databases: Compendex Plus,
Current Contents, ERIC, H. W. Wilson indexes, Information Access
Company indexes, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO.
