GETTY ART HISTORY INFORMATION PROGRAM LAUNCHES INITIATIVE ON
DIGITAL-IMAGING STANDARDS

The Getty Art History Information Program (AHIP) has announced
the formation of an international Imaging Initiative to address
issues related to the use of digital images in the arts and
humanities.  The Initiative will foster the development of
standards necessary to ensure that scholars, teachers, students,
and the general public have access to images of art and cultural
objects over electronic communications networks.

Recent technological developments make it possible to transmit
and view digital images over computer networks, but many barriers
remain to universal access.  In March of this year, AHIP brought
together representatives from the various constituencies involved
in the issue--including image providers (museums, libraries, and
archives), legal experts, and computer network specialists--to
identify these barriers and pinpoint areas where AHIP could act
most effectively.  Three principle concerns were recognized:

o    Standards: Currently, there are no common standards for the
     description, capture, storage, and transmission of images
     within the arts and humanities community.  Networked
     collections, accurate description, and high image quality
     and resolution are needed to build the critical mass of
     images necessary to change effectively the teaching and
     research methods used in the arts and humanities.  The
     Imaging Initiative will work to form a common understanding
     of who uses digital images, how they use them, and the image
     quality they require.  This effort will also include the
     development of standards for describing a digital-image
     file, ensuring that scholars can evaluate the digital images
     they use in their studies.

o    Intellectual property rights: Many image providers see
     electronic access to their collections as a great
     opportunity to reach new audiences, yet the issues related
     to compensation and the intellectual property rights of
     digital images remain largely undefined.  The Initiative
     will develop and test a model for the licensing of images of
     works of art, setting up a mechanism for the reliable
     distribution of images that preserves image integrity and
     prevents misuse.

+ Page 5 +

o    Common vision: Currently, a wide range of technical options
     are available to information providers, yet few serve the
     long-term goals of universal access.  Museum directors and
     library administrators are often ill-informed about computer
     technology, its potential, and its hazards.  The Imaging
     Initiative will develop a tutorial with noted
     digital-imaging expert Howard Besser to inform image
     providers about the benefits and challenges of electronic
     imaging.  The resulting information will be distributed
     through brochures, fact sheets, white papers, and as an
     interactive site on the Internet where users can work
     through materials, make comments, download reports, and view
     samples of digitized art.

The Getty Art History Information Program, one of six operating
programs of the J. Paul Getty Trust, seeks to make art-historical
information more accessible to scholars and researchers through
the use of advanced computer technology.  It does so by promoting
common perspectives and standards among international
institutions and organizations on projects in three general
areas: coordinating vocabularies to facilitate consistent data
entry and retrieval; providing bibliographic services; and
assembling art-historical databases.  AHIP plays a catalytic role
in helping to focus attention on the collective challenges facing
the information community in the coming decades.  Among AHIP's
projects are the Art and Architecture Thesaurus, the Bibliography
of the History of Art, the Avery Index to Architectural
Periodicals, the Provenance Index, the Witt Computer Index, and
the Getty Study of Online Searching by Scholars.

Affairs, The J. Paul Getty Trust, 401 Wilshire Blvd, Suite 900,

DRA ADDS SUBJECT AND KEYWORD SEARCHING TO ITS LC MARC DATABASE

Data Research Associates, Inc. (DRA) announced that it has
increased the flexibility and accessibility of one of its most
popular resources, the LC MARC database, when it added the
ability to search by subject or by keyword.  These searches are
in addition to past search capabilities, including author, title,
and various identification numbers.  Keyword searching provides,
among other functions, the ability to perform a search for a
series title and the ability to search for current popular
topics.

+ Page 6 +

Via DRA's Z39.50-compliant server, the LC MARC database can be
accessed from any Z39.50-compliant client, whether or not that
client is a DRA product.  The server supports all Z39.50 Version
2 facilities, allowing for a wider range of search capabilities,
including:

o    search qualifiers (such as author, title, subject, call
     number, LCCN, ISBN, etc.)

o    truncation in search terms

o    named search sets (enabling the combination of previous
     search result sets with new search terms)

Available for more than a decade, the LC MARC database consists
of more than four million records representing bibliographic,
serial, map, and other items cataloged by the Library of
Congress.  Hundreds of libraries across the globe use this
database daily, via either the Internet or Open DRANET, to serve
as a reference tool.  Or, if they are using the DRA cataloging
module, they use the database to copy bibliographic records to
their own system.  Recent average use included more than 5,200
connections per day, with more than 1,200 records copied.

ISSNs NOW IN PAIS DATA RECORDS ON TAPE

Public Affairs Information Service, Inc. (PAIS), publishers of
the premier international index of public affairs and social
policy information, is pleased to announce that its magnetic tape
format of the PAIS International bibliographic database now
includes the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).

In 1993 PAIS introduced a new magnetic tape format providing
distinct data fields, such as Library of Congress number, journal
name, or Superintendent of Documents number, which had previously
been formatted in a single citation field.  The new tape format
is designed to provide data elements in separate fields in order
to make index-building easier and consequently to improve search
results.

The ISSN, while provided as a data element in the separate
Periodicals Authority file, the complete listing of periodicals
used for PAIS indexing documents, was not provided in the
periodical bibliographic entry.  Now the bibliographic entries
for 94% of the PAIS periodical articles includes the ISSN.

+ Page 7 +

PAIS expects the provision of the ISSN in the bibliographic entry
to prove valuable.  One anticipated benefit is in the area of
document delivery.  It will be easier to order documents
identified in the PAIS International database with the ISSN
number in the bibliographic entry.  Subscribing organizations can
also use the ISSN as a match element to identify periodicals held
in their collection.

Public Affairs Information Service, Inc., founded in 1914, is a
nonprofit educational corporation, chartered by the Regents of
the University of the State of New York, providing online,
printed, and optical bibliographic indexes to the public policy
literature of business, health, law, government, political
science, and other social services.
