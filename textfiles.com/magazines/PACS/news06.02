CARL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES WORLD WIDE WEB SERVER

CARL Corporation has made access to databases, product
information, newsletters, and more available over the Internet
via the CARL Corporation World Wide Web Server.  The CARL
Corporation Web Server provides information about products and
services, news, documentation updates for current customers,
downloadable demos of microcomputer-based software, and links to
library and information resources across the Internet.

Documents on the Web are encoded in Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML), which allows users to view the documents with browsers
such as Lynx or Mosaic and "jump" through hypertext links to
other documents anywhere on the Internet.  The address for the
CARL Corporation server is http://www.carl.org/carl.html.


NOVELIST NOW AVAILABLE IN WINDOWS-BASED GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE

NoveList readers' advisory software, introduced by CARL
Corporation in September 1994, is now available in a Windows-
based format with a graphical user interface, as well as in DOS.
Two new features have been added; context-sensitive help is now
available in every component of NoveList, and a new editing
feature has been made available that allows library staff to add,
change, or delete bibliographic records through every major
function.

+ Page 2 +

There are four major functions of the GUI software.  "Match a
novel" uses a reader's favorite author or title to retrieve a
list of titles with similar content.  Matching is done from a
database of over 10,000 subject headings offered through a
cooperative agreement with the Hennepin County Public Library
System. "Describe a plot" uses keywords provided by the user to
go into a subject browse, or uses those keywords to find titles
that may be of interest.  "Explore fiction types" uses genre
headings in an icon-based environment, to retrieve titles of
interest for the user.  "Best Fiction" is totally customizable
and can feature awards, such as the Pulitzer and Nebula prizes,
bestsellers, or local favorites.  The editing feature allows for
timely updates for these locally created databases.

The Windows/GUI format of NoveList will be available as a stand-
alone product, as well as through CARL Corporation's Everybody's
Catalog public access GUI.  Over 34,000 adult fiction titles with
more than 10,000 subject headings and 2,500 ALA Booklist reviews
are included in the NoveList package.  A library of icons and
"Best Fiction" titles are provided as well.

For more information, contact Dodie Ownes at (303) 758-3030; E-
mail: downes@carl.org.


AMERITECH LIBRARY SERVICES ANNOUNCES NETPUBLISHER

Ameritech Library Services recently introduced NetPublisher, a
Windows-based publishing tool for internal networks and the
Internet.  Available early this year, NetPublisher will provide
library staff with a system to make information widely available
to patrons.

NetPublisher is a World Wide Web, Gopher, and Z39.50 server that
helps libraries catalog and organize resources of all media types
including text, image, audio, video, and multimedia.  The system
features point-and-click cataloging for information such as
annual reports, product brochures, sales presentations, customer
support, and other useful data.

Unlike other World Wide Web servers, NetPublisher eliminates the
need to learn HTML (hypertext markup language) to deliver
documents.  A unique template feature lets users customize
layouts by prompting them for headers, footers, and other
graphical information.  NetPublisher then automatically delivers
this information as an HTML page.

An online NetPublisher demo can be viewed on World Wide Web via
http://netpub.notis.com.  To request a media kit and screen
shots, please provide your name and message via phone: (708) 866-
0141 or e-mail: BBrodley@amlibs.com.

UTAH CONSORTIUM INSTALLS PROQUEST POWERPAGES

UMI announced that the Utah Academic Library Consortium has
installed a ProQuest PowerPages information-retrieval and
document-delivery system.  It will serve eleven sites, including
Brigham Young University and its affiliates.  All sites will have
access to UMI's General Periodicals Ondisc (GPO), a CD-ROM-based
information resource that offers indexing and abstracts for
articles in 1,600 business, academic, and general-reference
journals.  It also offers complete electronic images of articles
from many of the titles most frequently cited and accessed by
researchers.

The ProQuest PowerPages system makes GPO and other databases
available over local- and wide-area-networks.  It offers
simultaneous access for multiple users and instant document
delivery through laser printers and fax machines.

For more information, contact Thomas Pack at (800) 626-2823, ext.
223.


UNICORN INSTALLED AT TRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT CENTRE LIBRARY

SIRSI announced that its UNICORN Collection Management System is
installed at the Transportation Development Centre Library,
located in Montreal, Canada.  UNICORN is installed on a DEC host
computer.  The library has licensed the Authority Control,
Bibliographic and Inventory Control, Circulation, Enhanced Public
Access, and Request Modules.

The Transportation Development Centre is the central research and
development organization for Transport Canada, the Canadian
department of transportation.  Open to the public, the library
houses over 20,000 documents and 400 active serials.  The
collection covers subject areas such as marine, air, road, and
rail transportation and transportation accessibility.

For more information, contact Greg Hathorn at (205) 922-9825.


UNCOVER REVEAL AWARDED PRODUCT OF THE YEAR BY ONLINE MAGAZINE

UnCover Reveal, an electronic table of contents alert service,
received the 1994 Online Magazine Product of the Year Award for
best online searching product.  UnCover Reveal is just one
service of UnCover, a database that provides table of contents
indexing from nearly 17,000 journals worldwide.

+ Page 4 +

UnCover Reveal, introduced in 1994 by the UnCover Company, allows
UnCover users with profiles to create a list of journal titles in
which they are interested.  When the next issue of any of those
titles is entered into the UnCover database, the table of
contents is automatically e-mailed to them.  Currently, this e-
mail table of contents alert service is free.  Documents may be
ordered through reply e-mail and are delivered by fax for a
service charge and copyright fee.

The UnCover database may be accessed through the Internet by
telnetting to database.carl.org, or by dial-up at (303) 756-3600.
There is no charge for searching the database.  Copies of
articles from the titles may be ordered through the database for
delivery via fax (for service charge plus copyright fees).  For
more information, contact Brenda Bailey, The Uncover Company, at
(303) 758-3030 or send e-mail to uncover@carl.org.
