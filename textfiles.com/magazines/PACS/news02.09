WILSON ANNOUNCES SUBSCRIPTION CHANGES
 
H. W. Wilson Company announces that an initial subscription to
any of its nineteen WILSONTAPE databases now includes four years
of retrospective data plus monthly updates for current year.
Additional retrospective data is also available.  For further
information, contact Becky Clarke, H. W. Wilson Company, 950
University Ave., Bronx, New York 10452, (800) 367-6770, ext.
2758.
 
Wilson also has announced a new no-charge network and remote
access policy that applies to all nineteen WILSONDISC databases.
For school and academic libraries, no network or remote access
fees will be assessed for faculty, staff, and student access at a
single campus or school.  For public libraries, the policy will
apply to branches of a single public library.  In addition,
public library patrons may dial in from homes and offices with no
restriction on the number of simultaneous users.  Previously
announced policies for corporate libraries and for access by
patrons of non-associated institutions remain in effect.  For
further information, contact Michael Page, (800) 367-6770, ext.

ISI SOFTWARE UPGRADE FOR CITATION DATABASES
 
The Institute for Scientific Information has announced the
October 1991 release of Version 3.0 search and retrieval software
for its Science Citation Index Compact Disc Edition and the
Social Sciences Citation Index Compact Disc Edition.  Changes
will provide users with streamlined start-ups; an increased
number of on-screen messages; an indexed, more in-depth help
system; and customized record formats for printing and saving to
disk.
 
The new release also includes the related records feature which
links and displays bibliographic records that have references in
common.  When one record of interest is found, researchers are
quickly led to additional records related to their searches.  The
display of shared references in Version 3.0 offers users the
ability to review which of the references are shared between the
original article retrieved and its related records.  For further
information, contact Barbara Nagy-Teti, Institute for Scientific
Information, 3501 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA, (800) 336-
4474.
 
 
CLSI DEVELOPS ROBOTICS INTERFACE
 
The new Bordeaux Public Library, France, opened the doors to its
new eleven-floor library equipped with a CLSI online public
access catalog and robotic shelving and retrieval of non-
circulating materials.  CLSI developed an interface to the
automated system that directs the robot.
 
After CLSI's online catalog module produces the search results, a
request is sent to the robot via one of six personal computers.
The PC assigns a number to each user's request, and item barcode
numbers activate the robot to retrieve the items, usually
completed within five minutes.  The system informs the user that
the items have been delivered by automatically listing the
assigned number on an overhead sign.  To shelve the materials, a
PC scans the items' barcodes, and the robot returns the materials
to the correct locations in the library.
