NEW VERSION OF LE PAC SOFTWARE
 
Brodart Automation has released the latest version of its Le Pac
CD-ROM public access catalog software, designed to benefit
libraries with multiple locations.  The revised version adds
location qualifiers for author, title, and subject lists to allow
display of items at the specified location only.  The Expanded
Search feature allows the user to expand the search from a
location qualifier to the entire consortium-wide catalog, if
search results are not sufficient, while Multi-Level Location
Searching automatically scopes the entire database if the
location qualified search yields no matches.  For information
contact Brodart Automation, 500 Arch St., Williamsport, PA 17705
or call 800-233-8467, ext. 640.
 
 
DYNIX INTRODUCES NEW MODULES
 
Dynix, Inc. has announced two new software modules, Journal
Citation and Community Resources.  Journal Citation incorporates
the loader software as well as the index and search routines for
accessing periodical indexes through Dynix public access
catalogs.  Currently Dynix has agreements with Information Access
Company, H. W. Wilson, and ABI/Inform to load files for its
clients.  The module is designed to allow libraries to decide
which indexes they load, how many years of the retrospective
index they want, whether to load abstracts and, if so, whether to
index them or display them only.  In addition, libraries may
choose to load all records or only those periodical titles to
which they subscribe.
 
The Community Resources Module permits PAC users to access
information about local organizations and events, search library-
generated indexes of local newspapers, pose questions to staff,
or find answers to frequently asked reference questions.
 
For information contact Patricia Jones, Dynix, 151 E. 1700 South,
Provo, UT 84606, or call 801-375-2770.
