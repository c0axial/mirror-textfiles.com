MECKLER DEVELOPING INTERNET SERVICE
 
Meckler Publishing is working with JvNCNet to establish an
Internet service.  It is anticipated that the complete current
contents of fourteen Meckler periodicals (1991-present) as well
as the contents of selected books will be available for no-cost
searching on the Internet.  Indexes to the last five years of
Computers in Libraries and six years of CD-ROM Librarian, the
full Meckler publication catalog, and Meckler conference programs
will also be available.  An electronic document delivery
capability will complement the bibliographic access tools.
