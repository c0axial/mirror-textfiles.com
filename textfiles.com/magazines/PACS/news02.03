RLG DEVELOPS NEW DOCUMENT TRANSMISSION SYSTEM
 
The Research Libraries Group has developed a new document
transmission system called ARIEL.  Using an IBM PC/AT or
compatible, H-P scanner, H-P laser printer, and RLG proprietary
software, users can scan and store articles, photos, and similar
documents, transmit the highly compressed images over the
Internet to other workstations, and then print them on a laser
printer.
 
According to RLG, the system is faster, more reliable, and less
expensive to use than fax and produces images of greater
resolution and quality.  The system has been tested at Colorado
State University, Dartmouth College, University of California at
Berkeley and Davis, University of Michigan, and University of
Pennsylvania.

III DEVELOPS EXPORT TO PRO-CITE
 
Innovative Interfaces, Inc. is developing a direct-export feature
that enables users of the INNOPAC online catalog to export
catalog records into Pro-Cite databases.  This feature transfers
to a PC or a Mac used as a terminal on the INNOPAC system a file
of records in the specific "comma-delimited" format required by
Pro-Cite.  After using the INNOPAC export command, users complete
the process by executing the Pro-Cite import command.  Users are
not required to have Biblio-Link software in order to do this.
With their data now in a Pro-Cite database, users can search,
sort, index, manage and generate bibliographies formatted in any
bibliographic style of their own selection of records derived
from INNOPAC.  Innovative will make available the new export
command as an option in the upcoming Release 7 of the INNOPAC
system.
