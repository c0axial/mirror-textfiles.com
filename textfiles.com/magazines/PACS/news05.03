INTERNET BOOK SHOP OPENS FOR TRADE

A new service has been set up to allow you to browse/buy books
online.  It is totally free to users, and represents all of the
information that book publishers would normally put into their
catalogs.

So far, Blackwell Publishers (Oxford, UK, and Cambridge, MA) have
agreed to start the ball rolling, and their entire geography
catalog has been mounted for you to look at.  There are 120 books
and journals dealing with ecology, pollution, land formations
etc.  If you would like to check it out, then access via WWW to

LEADING IMMUNOLOGY JOURNAL TO GO ONLINE IN 1995

Elsevier Science and OCLC will launch Immunology Today Online in
January 1995 on OCLC's Electronic Journals Online (EJO) system.
Immunology Today Online will join several other journals already
available through EJO, including the Online Journal of Current
Clinical Trials, Electronics Letters Online and the Online
Journal of Knowledge Synthesis for Nursing.

Immunology Today is the first of the high-profile science review
magazines published by Elsevier Trends Journals to become
available online.  The launch is part of a series of strategic
initiatives in electronic publishing to be taken by Elsevier
Science.

Immunology Today Online will build on the strengths of Immunology
Today, the world's leading immunology review journal, offering
scientists and students instant desktop access to the world of
immunology through OCLC's highly intuitive graphical interface,
Guidon.

Immunology Today Online contains many new features complementary
to the print version.  The features include:

o    Full hypertext functionality allows users to move through
     related articles at the click of a button.

o    Hypertext links to abstracts of cited papers, from the
     Excerpta Medica bibliographic database, will reduce time

     procedures for new books and journals.

ANTIQUARIAN BOOKSHOP ON THE INTERNET

Meyer Boswell Books, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has put
a catalogue of its books on the Internet.  The bookshop, which
specializes exclusively in rare and scholarly law (including
constitutional law), has been in business since 1979, and is a
member of the American Association of Antiquarian Booksellers.
Its catalogue consists of the approximately 6,000 books presently
in its inventory, and is easily searchable by e-mail; orders for
the books may also be placed.

+ Page 4 +

To receive a Help file which describes both how to search and how
to order, send an e-mail message to rare-lawbooks@netcom.com.  In
the subject field put the word help, and likewise in the message
field put the same word.  Your message will thus read:

     To:  rare-lawbooks@netcom.com
     Subject:  help
     Message:  help

For those who would care to dive right in, here is an example of
a basic but powerful search for every book we have in stock by or
about Blackstone:

     To:  rare-lawbooks@netcom.com
     Subject:  search
     Message:  search Blackstone

Here is another example, this time of a basic subject search:

     To:  rare-lawbooks@netcom.com
     Subject:  search
     Message:  search constitutional law

After you have sent your e-mail message, we will send you an
e-mail reply; this usually takes a few minutes (depending where
you are). In the case of a search, you will receive back a list
of those books which satisfy your search.

CHAPMAN & HALL PURCHASES ONLINE JOURNAL OF CURRENT CLINICAL
TRIALS

Chapman & Hall has purchased the Online Journal of Current
Clinical Trials from the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS).  Based in London since 1830, Chapman & Hall
has become a major international scientific, technical and
medical (STM) publisher owned by the International Thomson
Publishing Group.  Chapman & Hall established a North American
presence in 1992 to develop books, journals and electronic
products in science and medicine.  Editorial, marketing and
promotion responsibilities for the Online Journal of Current
Clinical Trials will be executed from the New York office of
Chapman & Hall.

+ Page 5 +

The Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials is distributed
through the OCLC Electronic Journals Online service, which
provides full-text searching, hypertext linking capabilities,
related document linking, and access 23 hours each day to the
journal via dial access or through the Internet.  OCLC's Guidon
interface software presents the full text of the journal,
including figures, tables, and equations, in a quality that
rivals the typeset page.

The Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials is the first
electronic product in Chapman & Hall's expanding journals program
that includes American Journal of Therapeutics, Journal of
Wilderness Medicine, Microcirculation, and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging in Physics, Biology, and Medicine.  Chapman & Hall plans
to pursue more electronic publishing opportunities in the future.

OCLC ELECTRONIC JOURNALS ONLINE TO OFFER CURRENT OPINIONS
JOURNALS

Six Current Opinions journals in the biological sciences and 24
Current Opinions journals in clinical medicine will be available
electronically through the OCLC Electronic Journals Online
service.  The Current Opinions journals, from the Current Science
Group, will be organized in two "clusters" for electronic
delivery.  Current Opinions in Biology, from Current Biology
Ltd., and Current Opinions in Medicine, from Current Science
Ltd., will be available in early 1995.

The Current Opinions journals were developed out of the
recognition that it is increasingly difficult for specialists and
researchers to keep up to date with the expanding volume of
information published in their respective subject areas.  Current
Opinions in Biology and Current Opinions in Medicine keep
subscribers current by providing: the views of experts on the
latest advances in a clear and readable form; selections,
annotated by experts, of the most interesting papers from the
great wealth of original publications; and comprehensive
bibliographic listings from several hundred journals.

+ Page 6 +

With the OCLC Electronic Journals Online service, the Current
Opinions journals will be available to readers just 48 hours
after acceptance.  With a single subscription, subscribers can
browse the contents of journals, or search the entire collection
by a variety of indexes, Boolean operators, wildcard and
proximity indicators.  The Current Opinions journals also offer
unlimited SDIs, and links to the MEDLINE database from the
FirstSearch service, an OCLC online reference service.

Subscribers to the electronic journal clusters access the
journals with Guidon, Windows-based software developed by OCLC
that combines intuitive, full-text browsing or searching with
sophisticated color and halftone graphical images and equations
in the same typeset quality presentation that one would expect to
have in scholarly print publications.

Institutions can subscribe to either journal cluster directly
from OCLC, or through OCLC's regional networks.  Subscriptions
for the Current Opinions in Medicine and Current Opinions in
Biology electronic journal clusters will be offered at
substantial cost savings over the print versions.

Current Opinions in Biology includes the following journal
titles:

Biotechnology                Immunology
Cell Biology                 Neurobiology
Genetics and Development     Structural Biology

Current Opinions in Medicine includes the following journal
titles:

Anaesthesiology              Obstetrics & Gynecology
Cardiology                   Oncology
Cosmetic Dentistry           Ophthalmology
Critical Care                Orthopedics
Dermatology                  Otolaryngology & Head & Neck Surgery
Endocrinology & Diabetes     Pediatrics
Gastroenterology             Periodontology
Hematology                   Psychiatry
Infectious Diseases          Pulmonary Medicine
Lipidology                   Rheumatology
Nephrology & Hypertension    Surgical Infections
Neurology                    Urology
