CD-ROM NETWORKING SOLUTION
 
Meridian Data has introduced the CD Net Model 100NC, designed to
integrate up to 8 CD-ROM drives on a standard local area network.
The system runs on a variety of network operating systems
including LAN Manager, Novell, 3Com, and Ungermann-Bass.  The
system can be configured for ARCNET, Ethernet, or Token-Ring
networks, and it features up to 4MB of cache memory to enhance
access speed.  CD Net 100NC connects to LANs like any other node.
A single CD-ROM drive configuration of the CD Net 100NC is priced

Z39.50 IMPLEMENTATION
 
A partnership of the University of California (UC), Data Research
Associates (DRA), and Digital Equipment Corporation is developing
software to comply with the National Information Standards
Organization's (NISO) emerging Z39.50 protocol.  Z39.50 provides
a standard method of information transfer among automation
systems using different hardware, software, and operating
systems.
 
The software and supporting record transfer formats developed as
part of this partnership will ultimately link the University of
California's MELVYL online catalog and UC Davis's new DRA library
automation system, permitting transparent access to MELVYL from
UC Davis OPAC terminals and display of UC Davis item status
information in MELVYL.

1276 North Warson Road, P.O. Box 8495, St. Louis, MO 63132 (1-
800-325-0888).
