"The Need for Machine-Readable Authority Records for Topical
Subdivisions," by Karen M. Drabenstott, Associate Professor,
School of Information and Library Studies, University of
Michigan.
 
Abstract: This paper recognizes the limitations of the existing
file of Library of Congress (LC) subject authority records for
subject heading assignment and validation.  It makes
recommendations for a new machine-readable file of authority
records for topical subdivisions and for enhancements to the
existing subject authority file.  The recommended changes would
enable online systems to assist in subject heading formulation
and verify, with limited assistance by human intermediaries, the
individual components of subdivided headings.  A study of
subdivided subject headings in a large bibliographic database
forms the basis of the recommendations.

"Nonroman Scripts in the Bibliographic Environment," by Joan M.
Aliprand, The Research Libraries Group.
 
Abstract: The representation of nonroman scripts in Latin
characters causes information to be distorted in various ways.
USMARC now provides for "alternate graphic representation," so
that text in the authentic script(s) may be included in
bibliographic records.  As more library systems with nonroman
capability are developed, conformance to standards for the
encoding of nonroman data becomes more critical.  The development
of a single global character set standard is a significant change
that must be accommodated in USMARC.
 
"The Development and Implementation of the USMARC Format for
Classification Data," by Rebecca S. Guenther, Library of
Congress, Network Development and MARC Standards Office.
 
Abstract: This paper discusses the newly developed USMARC Format
for Classification Data.  It reviews its potential uses within an
online system and its development as one of the USMARC standards.
It provides a summary of the fields in the format, and considers
the prospects for its implementation.  The paper describes an
experiment currently being conducted at the Library of Congress
to create USMARC classification records and use a classification
database in classifying materials in the social sciences.
