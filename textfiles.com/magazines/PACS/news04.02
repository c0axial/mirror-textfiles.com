COUNTERPOINT OFFERS FIRST DAILY FEDERAL REGISTER VIA INTERNET

Counterpoint Publishing, Inc. has announced a new service
providing same-day availability of the complete Federal Register
(FR) via the Internet.  The Counterpoint FR service will provide
the fully indexed text of the complete Federal Register as
recorded on magnetic tape by the GPO.

Counterpoint's simplified menu-driven software allows end-users
to view the daily FR by table of contents, keywords in any and
exact order, article type, full-text or heading only, agency,
date or range of dates, or citation.  The software does not
require graphical interfaces, a mouse or function keys, thus
making it easy to use on a variety of computing platforms.
Routine searches can be stored and replayed.  Documents in the FR
are exportable in ASCII format with text exportable to E-mail,
any word processor, or printer.

+ Page 5 +

Counterpoint also will provide alternative access to the FR to
better address the unique needs of the global Internet community.
Using such distribution and access mechanisms as Usenet News
(NNTP), Mail (SMTP), Gopher, WAIS, and World Wide Web,
Counterpoint will provide the daily FR in the most cost efficient
and timely manner possible.

This new Counterpoint service is provided through arrangement
with Internet.COM  -- Internet Consulting Services of Cambridge
MA.  For additional information contact Counterpoint,
800-998-4515 or Internet: fedreg@internet.com.


AT&T TO PROVIDE DIRECTORY & DATABASE SERVICES TO NSFNET

AT&T has announced that it has signed a cooperative agreement
with the National Science Foundation to provide directory and
database services for NSFNET, the National Science Foundation
national data network that is part of the Internet.  Under the
terms of the agreement, AT&T will develop and maintain a
Directory of Directories which will serve as a pointer to
numerous resources on the Internet.  It will include lists of FTP
sites, lists of various types of servers available on the
Internet, lists of white and yellow page directories, library
catalogs, and data archives.  The Directory of Directories will
enable even novice users to obtain references to needed
information through simple, easy-to-use interfaces  As part of
its database services, AT&T will establish database servers to
extend and supplement the resources of the NSFNET, including
databases of contributed materials of common interest to the user
community and communications documents.  AT&T also will offer
database design, management and maintenance services to
organizations and groups for inclusion on the Internet.

Initially, access to all services will be provided through
several currently popular interface methods.  Over time, it is
anticipated that X.500 technology will become the primary method
of access.

In providing these services, AT&T will work cooperatively with
two other organizations: CERFNet, a General Atomics project,
which was awarded a similar agreement for information services;
and Network Solutions, Inc., which was awarded a similar
agreement for registration services.  The three corporations will
collaborate under a common concept called INTERNIC.

The cooperative agreement is for a five-year period, with annual
reviews.  It is expected that NSF will contribute approximately
one-third of the costs, with another third provided by AT&T and
the remainder recovered in user fees.  The user fees, which have
been proposed for maintenance of special databases and extensive

+ Page 6 +

directory listings, are consistent with Federal Networking
Council cost recovery guidelines.

Science Foundation, 202-357-9717, dmitchel@nsf.gov; Mary Bloch,
