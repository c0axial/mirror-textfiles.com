DIALOG CD-ROM PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR APPLE MACINTOSH
 
Dialog Information Services has announced the release of DIALOG
OnDisc software for the Apple Macintosh computer.  All 27 titles
available in the DIALOG OnDisc CD-ROM products, except
TRADEMARKSCAN-FEDERAL, can now be used with the Macintosh.
 
The software for the Macintosh contains several features not
included in the current DOS version.  The search history can be
viewed and search steps deleted at any point.  Searchers can also
highlight words or phrases within a record and then search those
words or phrases without re-keying.  In addition, records can be
sorted by two fields as is possible with DIALOG online.  Finally,
the size of type that displays on the monitor can be changed
within the program.
 
Equipment specifications include a Mac Plus, or greater, with a
hard disk; system version 6.0.2 or later and Finder version 6.1
or later; at least 1 MB of RAM and 1 MB of free space on the hard
disk; Apple CD-ROM SC, Pioneer CD-Changer, or other Macintosh-
compatible CD-ROM drive that conforms to the ISO 9660 standard.

involved.  Specify DOS or Macintosh version on the order form, in
order to receive the appropriate manual and software.

MERIDIAN DATA RELEASES CD NET CD-ROM SERVER SOFTWARE
 
Meridian Data, Inc. has announced a software package that
integrates multiple CD-ROM drives into a standard local area
network (LAN).  Called CD Net Software, the product is available
for use on Novell Netware and NetBIOS-based network applications.
The CD Net Software can transform a standard personal computer
with one or more CD-ROM drives into a CD-ROM server for a
network.  To facilitate integration and operation, the CD Net
Server then acts as a self-contained node so it can connect
directly to the network as a workstation.  CD Net Software allows
CD-ROM network access by mini computers and Macintoshes through
the use of PC Host Servers, such as hardware systems from Gandalf
Data and Virtual Microsystems, and software systems such as
pcAnywhere.

To enhance performance, the CD Net Software incorporates data
caching capabilities that increase the access speeds of the CD-
ROM drives on a network.  Using sophisticated "read ahead"
algorithms, the CD Net Software anticipates requests for CD-ROM-
based information.  This allows the end user to retrieve
information at faster access times than a single-user CD-ROM
drive.  The software's multi-tasking capability permits
simultaneous access on multiple CD-ROM drives.  In addition, CD
Net Software includes CD-ROM application administration and
application menuing software tools.  This allows the user and
network administrator to create their own custom menus.
 
Price begins at $499.95 with additional network licensing
available.  Meridian Data sells its products through
distributors, VARs and direct sales.
 
For more information, Meridian Data, Inc., 5615 Scotts Valley
Drive, Scotts Valley, CA 95066, 408/438-3100.

1985 forward.  Details on pricing and coverage will be announced
later.
 
For more information, University Microfilms International, 300
North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106, 800/521-0600.
 
 
NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE ON CD-ROM
 
Compact Cambridge will publish a CD-ROM edition of The New
England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) this fall.  The new product

record, report, editorial, letter to the editor or book review
published in the last five years, or browse material on a topical
basis.
 
For information, contact Michael Miyazaki, Compact Cambridge,
7200 Wisconsin Ave., Bethesda, MD 20814, 301/961-6761.

STAR SOFTWARE AVAILABLE ON 386 AND 486
 
Cuadra Associates has adapted its STAR text management and
information retrieval applications to run on 386 and 486 systems.
Cuadra has also dropped the price for entry-level STAR software
packages to $2,000 and eliminated all links between price and
hardware platform used.  STAR's ability to run on 386 and 486
systems, make it suitable for work environments with only a few
users, as well as for larger PC- and UNIX-oriented environments,
where multiple users need to share access to the same databases.
 
Further information available from Cuadra Associates, 11835 W.
Olympic Blvd., Suite 855, Los Angeles, CA 90064, 213/478-0066.
