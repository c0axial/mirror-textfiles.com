INFORMATION MACHINE DISTRIBUTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON
 
The University of Houston Libraries is now the distributor of the
Information Machine, a microcomputer reference assistance program
that can be adapted for use in other libraries.  The Information
Machine has been in use at the University of Houston Libraries
since 1987.
     An Information Machine presentation is menu-driven and may
contain information such as search strategy, locations, hours,
and policies.  Because the program can contain text on any topic,
non-library organizations may find it useful as well.
     An Information Machine presentation is created by capturing
screens from the display of a "clean screen" word processor such
as the DOS version of WordPerfect, then preparing a script that
directs the presentation.
     The Information Machine requires an IBM-compatible computer
with 256 KB RAM and a clock/calendar.  A color monitor is
recommended and a hard disk will be needed for all but very small
presentations.
     The University of Houston Libraries cannot offer formal
software support, but assistance will be provided as time
permits.  No upgrades to the software are guaranteed.
     The Information Machine is sold via the Library Copy Service
for the costs of disks, copying, postage, and handling.  The cost
is expected to be $30 for U.S. purchases.  All orders must be
paid by check or money order.

AUTO-GRAPHICS UPGRADES GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS DATABASE
 
Auto-Graphics has upgraded its Government Documents Catalog
Service (GDCS) database, an enhanced CD-ROM version of the
Monthly Catalog of U.S. Government Publications.  The upgrade
combined valuable and unique information and deleted redundant
data from otherwise duplicate records.  The process allows the
continued offering of the GDCS database on a single CD-ROM disc.
     The enhancement preserves the serials availability records
that contain unique information about individual publications,
map series records, and records for individual maps issued in
series.
     For additional information, contact Ruth Rubio-Rogerson at
Auto-Graphics, Inc., 3201 Temple Avenue, Pomona, CA 91768-3200;
