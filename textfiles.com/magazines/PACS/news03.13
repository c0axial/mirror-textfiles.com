APPLE LIBRARY PRESENTS AWARDS TO NETWORK CITIZENS
 
The Apple Library has given "Network Citizen" awards to Charles
W. Bailey, Jr., Diane K. Kovacs, David Robison, and Roy Tennant.
The text of the announcement follows:
 
     Apple Library of Apple Computer, Inc. is presenting awards
     to four librarians who have demonstrated the initiative and
     spirit of sharing through their efforts at electronic
     publishing on BITNET and the Internet.
 
     As the Internet continues its rapid growth, many librarians
     have begun exploring the information resources and forming
     communities of interest for colleagues and other people on
     the network.  Certain individuals have gone beyond the
     casual sharing of ideas and information via electronic mail.
     They have spent many hours, weeks, and months organizing the
     raw materials, moderating mailing lists, and turning out
     useful network resources without any financial gain.

     To recognize their efforts Apple Library has chosen the
     designation of Network Citizen for four librarians who have
     made significant contributions to the good of the network by
     their efforts.  The four people chosen for 1992 are:
 
     Diane K. Kovacs, Kent State University, for the work she has
     done as compiler of the Directory of Scholarly E-Conferences
     and as a LISTOWNER and Co-Editor of LIBRES, LIBREF-L,
     Arachnet, and GovDoc-L.  Her sources are cited by many users
     outside of the library profession.
 
     Charles W. Bailey, Jr., University of Houston, for the work
     he has done since 1989 in starting and promoting the PACS-L
     list, The Public-Access Computer Systems News and The
     Public-Access Computer Systems Review (PACS Review).  By
     making use of the available tools and resources on BITNET
     and enlisting the volunteer efforts of other scholars and
     librarians he has helped enrich the computing and
     information environment for thousands of information
     professionals around the world.  Until he started PACS-L the
     efforts in electronic communications between librarians were
     fragmented and without much impact.  Both the list and
     journal have inspired other librarians to publish other
     works and organize other discussion groups on the network.
 
     David Robison and Roy Tennant, University of California
     Berkeley, for the work they have done in assembling Current
     Cites, an electronic periodical that has provided terse,
     relevant abstracts of interesting articles that have
     appeared in both print and electronic formats.  By providing
     this at no cost to the network user, they have enriched both
     the community and have saved time and energy for overloaded
     researchers and librarians who are trying to keep up with
     the latest developments.  David is the editor of the journal
     and Roy is the coordinator of the Library Technology Watch
     Group which contributes to the publication and whose other
     members include: Mark Takaro, Teri Rinne, Vivienne Roumani,
     and Lisa Rowlison.
 
     Each Network Citizen will receive a certificate of
     appreciation, a PowerBook 145, Claris Works software, and a
     carrying case.  Apple Library is proud to support the
     efforts of these and other librarians who effectively mix
     the devotion to service with achievements using advanced
     technology.

fee for the file (or files) of their choice, and their users
receive unlimited searching.
 
Full-text copies of articles cited in ABI/INFORM, Ei Page One,
Newspaper Abstracts, and Periodical Abstracts can be ordered
online through CitaDel.  Document delivery options include first
class mail, fax, and Ariel (RLG's document transmission system
for the Internet).

OCLC ISSUES LINKING STRATEGY FOR THE INTERNET AND THE NREN
 
"OCLC's Linking Strategy: Internet and NREN," has been sent to
the OCLC membership.  The three-page document describes OCLC's
plans and policies between 1992 and 2000 with respect to linking
with the Internet and the emerging National Research and
Education Network (NREN).
 
Between 1992 and 1995, OCLC will continue to provide Internet
access to its Reference Services and move to broaden access to
the Internet and the NREN.  It will provide batch-file transfer
of MARC records on the Internet.  It will also explore providing
cataloging and resource sharing services on the Internet.

Between 1995 and 2000, OCLC intends to play a key role in a 21st
century telecommunications infrastructure that integrates voice,
data, and images on the same communications lines in a truly
global information network.
 
To obtain a copy of "OCLC's Linking Strategy: Internet and NREN,"

Dublin, Ohio 43017-3395.
 
 
RLG TO OFFER RUSSIAN DATABASES THROUGH CITADEL SERVICE
 
The Research Libraries Group has signed an agreement with INION
(the Institute of Scientific Information in the Social Sciences,
which is part of the Russian Academy of Sciences) to make all
INION databases available through CitaDel for a period of three
years beginning as soon as the necessary technical arrangements
can be made.
 
INION is responsible for abstracting and indexing humanities and
social science periodicals published in what is now the
Commonwealth of Independent States and other nations in Eastern
Europe.  INION produces printed bibliographies in anthropology,
archaeology, economics, history, law, literary criticism, and
philosophy.
