DIALOG ACQUIRES INTEREST IN PERSONAL LIBRARY SOFTWARE

Dialog Information Services, Inc., a Knight-Ridder company, and
Personal Library Software (PLS) have announced completion of an
agreement for Dialog to invest in PLS.  The significant minority
investment of Dialog in PLS allows the two companies to share
technology and explore product and market synergies.

PLS is best known for its innovative information retrieval
products, pioneering the application of advanced search tools such
as concept searching and relevance ranking.  These products
complement Dialog's own development in online and CD-ROM search and
retrieval systems, document management and delivery, and
integration of external and internal databases.  One of the first
areas targeted for joint development will be in Dialog's fast-
growing CD-ROM business.

UMI & FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE TO CREATE NEW CD-ROM DATABASE

University Microfilms International and the Federal News Service
(FNS) have signed an exclusive contract to create a new CD-ROM
product making use of the FNS Transcript Service.  This service
provides a verbatim account of what is said at every U.S.
government event.

It is expected the new CD-ROM database will have wide audience of
users, from corporations wanting to track regulatory hearings that
affect their industry to secondary school students doing political
science and civics projects.  Presently, some of the most frequent
users of FNS are embassies, foreign governments, news wires,
newspapers, broadcast media, and lobbyists.

The CD-ROM database will be ready for release in early 1994.  It
will cover the current year of data plus two years of retrospective
coverage.  The format is full-text (ASCII) and the annual
subscription price will be approximately $1,600 or $1,200 for
secondary school libraries.

The agreement between UMI and FNS offers the opportunity to create
CD-ROM databases utilizing the other services FNS provides.  A
decision on additional CD products will be made in the future.  In
addition to the FNS Transcript Service, FNS also offers:

     *    FNS Russian Service.  Verbatim transcripts in English of
          press briefings, speeches, and statements by major
          Russian leaders;

     *    FNS Spanish Service.  This Spanish language service
          provides business, political, and social news from all
          over Latin America;

     *    United States Supreme Court.  FNS is one of a small,
          select group chosen by the Supreme Court to receive its
          online transmission of the Court's opinions and orders;

     *    FNS Daybook.  Provides listings of government actions and
          private events;

     *    United Nations Services.  Provides coverage of Security
          Council resolutions, General Assembly actions, as well as
          the activities of various U.N. groups like UNICEF.

DIALOG ANNOUNCES MIGRATION TO DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Dialog Information Services, Inc. has announced an agreement with
Sun Microsystems Computer Corp. (SMCC) to assist in the initial
phases of transforming Dialog's massive centralized computing
environment into a networked, client-server system that will enable
Dialog to quickly, flexibly, and cost-effectively create products

searchers and the clientele they serve, making possible:

     *    Custom corporate information systems that meet specific
          requirements of individual departments and markets;

     *    Display of integrated documents, including both text and
          graphics;

     *    International offerings of local data;

     *    Delivery of data to customers' desktop computing
          environments of choice;

          allowing aggressive third party reseller development.

technology marketplace to craft customer-driven information
solutions.
