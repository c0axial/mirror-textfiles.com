ONLINE JOURNAL OF CURRENT CLINICAL TRIALS IS DATABASE'S PRODUCT
OF THE YEAR
 
Database magazine has named The Online Journal of Current
Clinical Trials (OJCCT) its Product of the Year.  OJCCT is an
electronic, full-text, peer-reviewed science journal that
includes graphics.
 
OJCCT, which began publication on July 1, is a joint venture
between the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS), which developed the editorial content and focus, and the
OCLC Online Computer Library Center, which developed the
interface and distributes the journal on its international
telecommunications network.
 
The electronic journal publishes medical findings as soon as they
have been reviewed by medical experts, giving physicians faster
access to results of research on new and re-examined medical
treatments.
 
Subscribers access the journal using GUIDON, a graphical user
interface developed by OCLC.  GUIDON supports searching by
subject, title, author, keyword, date, and a full range of
Boolean and proximity operators.  It displays full text, figures,
tables, and equations in quality that rivals the printed page.
OJCCT is available on a subscription basis to individuals or
institutions.

OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS TO PUBLISH POSTMODERN CULTURE
 
 
Oxford University Press and Postmodern Culture have announced a
new partnership in electronic publishing.  Beginning in January
1993, Oxford will publish Postmodern Culture.
 
Postmodern Culture is a peer-reviewed electronic journal of
interdisciplinary criticism on contemporary literature, theory,
and culture.  It is currently published at North Carolina State
University, and it is supported by the NCSU Department of
English, the NCSU Libraries, NCSU Campus and Engineering
Computing, the NCSU College of Humanities and Social Sciences,
and the NCSU Research Office.  Postmodern Culture has appeared
three times a year since September 1990.  Currently, it has over
2,300 subscribers in more than 40 countries.
 
Oxford University Press established an electronic publishing
research unit in late 1985 and released their first electronic
products in 1988.  Oxford currently publishes more than fifty
electronic packages in science, medicine, general reference, and
the humanities and social sciences: Postmodern Culture will be
Oxford's first electronic journal and its first networked
electronic publication.
 
 
INDIANA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ESTABLISH SCHOLARLY ELECTRONIC TEXT
SERVICE
 
The Indiana University Libraries have recently established a
Library Electronic Text Resource Service (LETRS), coordinated by
Mark Day, to provide a focus for the increasing number of faculty
and students in the humanities who need to work with scholarly
texts in electronic form.
 
Among the first texts to be made available in electronic form
are: (1) the Bible in a variety of English translations and in
the original Greek and Hebrew; (2) the sacred writings of other
religions, such as the Islamic Quran and Hadith; (3) the complete
corpus of classical Greek literature from Homer up to 500 AD; (4)
various editions of the complete works of Shakespeare; (5)
numerous works by well-known American writers such as Jefferson,
Emerson, Twain, and Cather; and (6) the literary output of many
other world-famous authors, such as the complete works of the
German author Johann Wolfgang Goethe.

Numerous tools in electronic form for aiding scholars and
students in their interpretation of these original sources also
have been acquired.  There are four basic types of tools: (1)
reference works on computer, such as the Oxford English
Dictionary Second Edition on Compact Disc; (2) writing tools,
such as multi-lingual word processors that can work with a
variety of non-Roman scripts; (3) text analysis programs that can
manipulate natural language data and output scholarly aids such
as a complete concordance of all the words used by a particular
author; and (4) instructional programs that help students and
scholars to study anything from a single text up to entire
languages and cultures.  An example of the later is the recently
acquired multimedia Perseus Compact Disc for the Macintosh that
provides an interactive gateway to ancient Greek literature,
history, art and archaeology.
 
In addition to facilitating the acquisition of these electronic
texts and tools and the hardware needed to support them, LETRS
also plans to provide: (1) basic assistance to patrons in their
use on both PC and Macintosh computers at its central location in
the Reference Department of the Main Library; (2) faculty and
graduate student workshops on available electronic text resources
as part of the Library's Instruction and Orientation program; (3)
consultations with individuals on scholarly research projects;
and (4) development of campus-wide network access to electronic
texts when and where feasible.
 
 
FIRSTSEARCH AND EPIC ADD SOCIAL SCIENCES INDEX AND EVENTLINE
 
OCLC's online reference services, The FirstSearch Catalog and the
EPIC service, now provide access to Social Sciences Index and
EventLine.
 
Produced by the H. W. Wilson Co., Social Sciences Index (SSI)
covers 350 English-language periodicals that are considered to be
the core of the social sciences literature, covering such fields
as anthropology, economics, geography, international relations,
political science, psychology, social work, and public welfare.

EventLine, from the Elsevier Publishing Group, contains
information on 120,000 international conferences, trade shows,
symposia, workshops, and seminars.  EventLine can be searched by
the subject of the meeting, its location, or the time period.  It
is compiled from news of international meetings covered in
Elsevier's 1,000 publications.
