SIRSI RELEASES PROCITE EXPORT OPTIONS

Adding to its line of client service capabilities, SIRSI has
released the ProCite Interface for UNICORN/STILAS users.  With
UNICORN/STILAS Version 7.1, users will be able to use
UNICORN/STILAS bibliographic records with ProCite bibliographic
management software.  SIRSI's new E-mail and Download Marked
Results options convert UNICORN/STILAS bibliographic records to
the ProCite format.  The converted records can then be used to
create databases, bibliographies, and item lists.

When searching the UNICORN/STILAS database, users are able to
flag records using the MARK button.  Marked citations can then be
downloaded using the E-mail or Download Search features of
UNICORN and STILAS.  Unlike other library systems, UNICORN/STILAS
provides for all of the bibliographic work forms offered in
ProCite.  The entire process is completely automated.  Users
spend no time manually rekeying information.

Once bibliographic records are in ProCite, users have tools for
generating and printing various types of bibliographies and
lists.  Information can be presented as needed using any of
ProCite's 28 different bibliographic styles, including University
of Chicago, Turabian, and American Psychological Association.
Other bibliographic styles can also be added.

SIRSI's ProCite Interface software is available for purchase with
the 7.1 release of UNICORN and STILAS.  For a limited time,
customers purchasing the ProCite Interface will receive a coupon
redeemable with PBS, Inc., for a 25% discount on ProCite.

For more information, contact Greg Hathorn at (205) 922-9825.


NEW UNCOVER CONTRIBUTOR LIBRARY TO DEEPEN SCIENTIFIC COLLECTION

The Marine Biological Laboratory/Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution Library (MBL/WHOI) has just become UnCover's newest
contributing and supplying library.  The MBL/WHOI Library
supports the research efforts of scientists from two private
laboratories and two federal government facilities located in
Woods Hole, a village in the Town of Falmouth on the southwestern
corner of Cape Cod.

Because of the diversity of the research conducted in Woods Hole,
the library collection includes a wide variety of scientific
materials.  Journals from areas as diverse as marine biology,
radioanalytical chemistry, fisheries, geology, pesticides,
physics, natural history, and petroleum geology are included in
their collection.  Teresa Mullins, Database Development
Coordinator for UnCover, is in the process of examining the list
of their holdings, and will begin adding new titles to the
database during the spring of 1995.  The MBL/WHOI Library will
begin supplying articles as soon as equipment has been installed.

For more information, call UnCover at (303) 758-3030.


VTLS INFOSTATION TO RUN ON NEXT, INTEL, HP, SUN, AND DEC

The VTLS InfoStation, a multimedia information access system and
front end to online public access catalogs, will soon be running
on two more major hardware platforms.  Currently, InfoStation
runs on Motorola-based NeXT hardware, on Intel-based 486 and
Pentium machines, and on RISC-based Hewlett-Packard 700 series
workstations.  InfoStation will soon be running on SPARC
processor-based hardware from Sun Microsystems, Inc., and on
Alpha AXP-based hardware from Digital Equipment Corporation
(DEC).

The multimedia VTLS InfoStation features hypermedia links and
annotative and authoring capabilities for library automation.  It
provides seamless integration between bibliographic and
multimedia information, letting online public catalog users
retrieve audio, textual, graphical, animated, and full-motion
video objects linked to cataloged items.  In addition, users can
access information on the World Wide Web.

+ Page 3 +

Integrated fully with image scanners and OCR software, the
InfoStation can also serve as an image browser for an online
catalog linked to scanned documents.  With the browser, users can
search for, view, magnify, and edit scanned images that reflect a
variety of image formats and compression schemes.

The InfoStation supports multiple distributed databases via
TCP/IP and multimedia objects on the network via NFS, FTP, and
Novell NetWare.  It will soon support the z39.50 protocol.

Clients currently using the VTLS InfoStation include Princeton
University, National Agricultural Library, National Library of
Switzerland, and the Library of Virginia.  For more information,
contact Gail Gulbenkian, VTLS, Inc., at (703) 231-3605.


UNCOVER ANNOUNCES ACCESS ON WORLD WIDE WEB

The UnCover Company has now made access to its UnCover database
and other services available via a home page on the World Wide
Web.  UnCover provides table of contents indexing from nearly
17,000 journals worldwide.

In addition to database access, UnCover's home page provides
information about services, pricing, and a copy of the current
UnCover Update newsletter as well as back issues.  A list of all
UnCover titles is also there and will be updated on a monthly
basis.  This list can even be downloaded via FTP.  Future plans
include a glossary of UnCover terminology and a quick guide for
using UnCover.

UMI's NEW DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEM NOMINATED FOR
COMPUTERWORLD/SMITHSONIAN AWARD

UMI's new Advanced Document Delivery System (ADDS) has been
nominated for the Computerworld/Smithsonian Award, widely
recognized as one of the premier awards programs in the
information technology industry.  ADDS is a new document delivery
system that opens up access for researchers, students, and
business people to a large amount of information, including
magazine articles, news transcripts, newspaper stories,
dissertation summaries, and more.  Users access ADDS with a
personal computer and modem and dial in to UMI's client-server
host located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The system, which debuts
this summer, is scheduled for 24-hour availability.

+ Page 4 +

What differentiates ADDS from other services is the fact that
users have unparalleled flexibility in how they view and have
information delivered.  Articles can be ordered in abstract-only
form, full text, full image (a complete scan of the original
article) or full text with graphics.  And users can then dictate
how they want their information delivered, whether by fax,
express mail, electronic mail, or regular mail.

The Computerworld/Smithsonian Award was started in 1989 as a
means to recognize corporations, organizations, and individuals
who are changing society through innovative uses of information
technology.  Finalists will be announced at the end of April and
will be honored along with the winners at the seventh annual
awards dinner at the National Building Museum in Washington,
D.C., on June 5, 1995.

For more information, contact Jonathan K. James, UMI, at (800)
521-0600, x3340.


NETWORK VERSION OF NOVELIST NOW AVAILABLE

CARL Corporation's new electronic readers' advisory resource,
NoveList, is now available for networks.  NoveList can now be
loaded on most local area networks (LANs) or any shared file server
system, such as Novell networks and LANtastic.  The new Windows-
based version of NoveList with a graphical user interface will also
be available for LANs or any shared file server system.

NoveList is an online readers' advisory resource that helps
readers find books based on books they've read or topics in which
they are interested.  Readers enter a title or author they like or
describe a book they would like to read, and NoveList finds books
in its database with matching subject headings.  NoveList provides
enhanced subject access to approximately 34,000 adult fiction
titles.  NoveList's enhanced subject access is provided by the
Hennepin County Public Library.  In addition, over 3,000 full-text
book reviews are also included in the NoveList database.  These
reviews are supplied by Booklist, the American Library
Association's reviewing journal.  In addition to these sources, the
Windows-based version of NoveList also includes the 4th edition of
Genreflecting by Diana Tixier Herald (1995, Libraries Unlimited).

NoveList allows local users to modify and enhance the product's
database through the use of editing utilities.  These utilities
allow for the addition of authors and titles that are popular
locally as well as provide a means for a library's adult fiction
experts to incorporate their knowledge into the product.

Individuals interested in learning more about NoveList should
contact Duncan Smith at (919) 416-0908; e-mail: dsmith@carl.org.
