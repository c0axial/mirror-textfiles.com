Coalition for Networked Information Established
 
The Association of Research Libraries, CAUSE, and EDUCOM have
announced the formation of the Coalition for Networked Information
(CNI) to promote the provision of information resources on existing
and proposed networks.  An initial priority of CNI will be to link
libraries to these networks.
 
CNI was formed following the National Net '90 Conference.  A
primary goal of the conference is the pursuit of the National
Research and Education Network (NREN), an advanced computer network
proposed to interconnect more than 1,000 colleges, universities,
and research organizations.
 
CNI will address the policy, technical, operational, and economic
issues of such a network along with questions of intellectual
property rights, standards, cost recovery models, and other public
policy issues.
 
The work of CNI will be accomplished through a Task Force composed
of representatives of member and sponsoring organizations.
