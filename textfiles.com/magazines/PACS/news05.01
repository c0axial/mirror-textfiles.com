COMINDEX SOFTWARE RELEASED

The non-profit Communication Institute for Online Scholarship
released recently the new 1994 version of its ComIndex
bibliographic software system, which provides a self-contained
electronic index to the primary scholarly literature of the
communication field (speech, mass communication, rhetoric,
journalism).

The ComIndex software system was winner of the 1993 "Prize for
Excellence in Information Services" from the International
Communication Association's Council of Communication Libraries.

This low-cost software can be licensed for libraries, departments,
individuals, or institution-wide.  Instructions for obtaining a
free evaluation copy are included below.

Obtaining a Demonstration Copy of ComIndex:

The ComIndex demonstration program is exactly the same as the
regular ComIndex program except that the demonstration version
contains data from only 20 articles from each of the 49 serials and
annuals covered by the full ComIndex system.

+ Page 2 +

A demonstration version of ComIndex can be obtained in two ways--
on diskette through the U.S. post or over the Internet using the
anonymous FTP process.  To request a demonstration copy through the
U.S. post, call the CIOS message service at 518-887-2443 and leave
your name, address, disk requirements (i.e., either 5.25 inch 360K
or 3.5 inch 720K), and phone number.

You can also obtain a demonstration copy of ComIndex using the
Internet anonymous FTP procedure.  Use the FTP procedure to connect
to host:  128.113.33.17

Login as user "anonymous" (without quotation marks).  No password
is necessary.  Set the FTP transfer mode to "binary" or "image" and
then "get" the file:  CIDEMO.EXE

If you need to further transfer the file to a PC from an
Internet-attached mainframe or mini-computer, be sure to use a file
transfer method that is appropriate for a compiled, executable
program.  In some cases, this will mean that you will need to
explicitly set the transfer method to BINARY in your PC/mainframe
file transfer program (e.g., this would be the case in MS-Kermit).

The file you receive should be exactly 306,364 bytes in size.
Place the file CIDEMO.EXE on the hard disk of an IBM or compatible
computer, type CIDEMO, and press the return/enter key.  The file
will unpack automatically into the set of files that comprise the
ComIndex demonstration program.  The unpacking process will place
these files in a directory that will be created named CIDEMO. When
the files are unpacked type CI and press the return/enter key to
explore ComIndex.

Descriptive information is contained in a file named README.1ST,
which will be placed on your machine along with the other files.
This file can be printed or you can view it with a text editing
program or word processor.


RLG ADDS ANTHROPOLOGICAL LITERATURE TO ITS CITADEL SERVICE

The Research Libraries Group (RLG) has added Anthropological
Literature--a file of over 87,000 citations compiled by Harvard's
Tozzer Library--to its CitaDel citation and document delivery
service.  The file is the most comprehensive index to research in
anthropology available today.

+ Page 3 +

File citations refer to articles from over 800 scholarly journals
and 200 monographic series on anthropology and related fields from
the Tozzer Library collection.  Coverage, dating mainly from 1984
to the present, includes research articles and reports,
commentaries, review essays, and obituaries.  Subjects include
archaeology, cultural and social anthropology, biological and
physical anthropology, linguistics, sociology, history, economics,
art history, religious studies, music, and area studies.  Materials
are in a variety of languages.  Online records contain English
translations of the title if supplied by the journal or edited
work.

Anthropological Literature will be updated quarterly with
approximately 2,000 new citations.  In addition, Tozzer Library is
working on the retrospective conversion of approximately 200,000
article entries in its card catalog that date from the late 1880s
through 1983.  These entries will be added to the file over the
coming year.

Copies of all materials referenced in Anthropological Literature
are available by interlibrary loan directly through Tozzer Library.

Access to Anthropological Literature is available by annual
subscription.  Institutions with subscriptions to Eureka/RLIN or to
another CitaDel file are eligible to receive discounts on
Anthropological Literature subscriptions.

For more information contact an RLG sales associate at
800-537-7546 or send e-mail to bl.sal@rlg.bitnet or
bl.sal@rlg.stanford.edu.

OCLC EXPANDS ENHANCE PROGRAM AFTER CIP UPGRADE TEST

The result of a three-month pilot project that tested the upgrading
of cataloging-in-publication (CIP) records is that OCLC will
authorize all Enhance program participants with Books
authorizations to upgrade CIP records in the Online Union Catalog
(OLUC).

National libraries, including the Library of Congress, the
National Library of Canada, and the British Library, catalog
printers' galleys for forthcoming books and enter CIP records in
the OLUC.  These records help libraries catalog new acquisitions
by providing authorized name and subject headings and basic
cataloging format for items before they are printed and
distributed.  Until now, libraries using the CIP record had to
verify titles and fill in the number of pages, size of the item,
and whether it had illustrations.

From August through October 1993, OCLC sponsored a pilot project
that allowed Enhance libraries to upgrade CIP records in the
Online Union Catalog rather than waiting for a national library
to upgrade them.  The 10 participating Enhance libraries upgraded
1,686 records during the test.  To evaluate the records for
accuracy and correctness, OCLC used software programs developed
by its office of research that compare two records and identify
their differences.  OCLC was able to see the changes that
pilot-project libraries had made and used this data in preparing
the final guidelines for upgrading CIP records.

+ Page 5 +

The libraries that participated in the pilot project were:
o   American Museum of Natural History
o   Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
o   Hunter College
o   Oberlin College
o   San Diego County Law Library
o   University of California, San Diego
o   University of Florida, Gainesville
o   University of Illinois, Chicago
o   University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Health Sciences
    Library
o   University of Wisconsin, Madison

Through the Enhance Program, 112 OCLC member libraries have
volunteered to upgrade Online Union Catalog records by adding
information and correcting certain types of errors.  In 1992/93,
93,892 records were enhanced, bringing the total of records
enhanced since the program began in 1984 to over 750,000.

Nita Dean 614-761-5002.


CHANGES MADE TO CONSER NEWSLETTER

The Library of Congress and OCLC announce  name, format, and
distribution changes for the newsletter, CONSER, which has provided
news of the Cooperative Online Serials program since 1976.

Effective January 1994, the new newsletter, CONSERline, will be
issued only in electronic format.  CONSERline will be
transmitted semiannually, in January and June, with additional
issues released as needed to relay information of timely
interest.

Like its predecessor, CONSERline will be a cooperative effort
of the CONSER program and will contain contributions from program
members as well as news of the CONSER program and related serials
cataloging issues.

There is no charge for CONSERline.  Subscriptions may be
obtained by sending an e-mail message--SUBSCRIBE CONSRLIN,
followed by your name--to:  listserv@sun7.loc.gov.  Back issues
of CONSERline will be made available through LC Marvel, a
campus-wide information system of the Library of Congress, and
through the listserver.

Topics of interest or suggestions for CONSERline may be
forwarded to the editors:  Jean Hirons, serial record division,
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., 20540-4160, or Liz
Bishoff, OCLC member services division, OCLC, 6565 Frantz Road,
Dublin, Ohio, 43017-3395.

+ Page 6 +

CONSER, the Cooperative Online SERials program, is a source of
authoritative bibliographic records and standardized documentation
for cataloging serials.  The 18 national and full-member
participants in the CONSER program authenticate serials records in
the CONSER database, which resides in the OCLC Online Union
Catalog.  CONSER records are now linked to the journals cited in 10
reference databases available in The FirstSearch Catalog and the
EPIC service, which assists users in determining whether the serial
titles in which they find citations are available in their local
library or if they need to place an interlibrary loan or document
delivery request.


ELECTRONIC NURSING JOURNAL NOW AVAILABLE

The Online Journal of Knowledge Synthesis for Nursing, published by
Sigma Theta Tau International, Honor Society of Nursing and OCLC,
is now available.

The new electronic peer-reviewed journal for nurses makes current
research findings available for the immediate use of clinical
nurses, academicians, and researchers and provides critical
reviews of research literature to guide nursing practice and
research.

Electronic journal articles will include a statement of the
practice problem, a summary of the research, annotated critical
references, practice implications, research needed, search
strategies, and references used.  The electronic format will
allow timely access to information without long publication
delays.  Readers can search articles directly for information of
interest to them and review, download, or print relevant
information in whole or in part.

Sigma Theta Tau provides the journal's editorial content and
offers subscriptions, and OCLC provides the electronic publishing
and delivery capabilities.

Jane Barnsteiner, RN, Ph.D., and fellow of the American Academy
of Nursing, is the journal's editor.   Dr. Barnsteiner is
associate professor and director of the Pediatric Critical Care
Graduate Program at the University of Pennsylvania School of
Nursing in Philadelphia.  She is also director of nursing
practice and research at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

+ Page 7 +

Subscribers to the Online Journal of Knowledge Synthesis for
Nursing access the journal using GUIDON, a graphical user
interface developed by OCLC, or a command-driven ASCII user
interface.  GUIDON runs in the Microsoft Windows environment on
an 80386 or higher PC.  It supports searching by subject, title,
author, keyword, date, and a full range of Boolean and proximity
operators.  GUIDON displays full text, figures, tables, and
equations in quality that rivals the printed page.  The ASCII
interface runs on a terminal or PC with software emulating a
VT100 terminal.

The journal is available on an annual subscription basis to
individuals ($60) or institutions ($250).  Each subscription
includes an access package with GUIDON software, optional
automatic notification of new documents published in areas of
interest, connect time, ability to print locally, and downloading
of document files.  Typeset-quality prints delivered by mail or
fax are available for additional fees.

The journal can be accessed through the Internet, the OCLC
telecommunications network, and CompuServe Dial Access.

FIRST ELECTRONIC JOURNAL TO BE INCLUDED IN INDEX MEDICUS

The Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials (OJCCT) has become
the first electronic journal ever to be included in Index Medicus,
the National Library of Medicine's internationally used abstracting
and indexing service.  Acceptance by Index Medicus (and its
database counterpart MEDLINE) is a mark of high distinction for any
journal, and is especially notable in the case of OJCCT, which
launched a mere 18 months ago as the world's first electronic
peer-reviewed medical journal with typeset quality text, tables,
and line images.  Of the more than 3,800 medical journals indexed
by MEDLINE, OJCCT is the first to be distributed solely through
computer networks.

Most of the world's biomedical researchers turn to MEDLINE
when seeking information of significance to their work.  Its
acceptance into MEDLINE promises to heighten the journal's appeal
among clinical trial researchers.

+ Page 8 +

Articles submitted to OJCCT--which concern medicine and all its
subspecialities--undergo rigorous peer-review and, if accepted, can
be published within 48 hours.  Subscribers receive the articles
simultaneously, worldwide, and can elect to receive special
notification by fax or mail of any new articles of particular
interest to them.  Thanks to the powerful interface software
developed by OCLC, subscribers can easily navigate documents,
search for any previously published articles, and call up MEDLINE
abstracts on all references, among other features.  Launched July
1, 1992, OJCCT received the 1992 Product of the Year Award from
Database Magazine in recognition of its pioneering contribution to
electronic publishing.

OJCCT is owned and published by the American Association for
the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in a joint venture with the
Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC).  Besides OJCCT, the
Washington, D.C.-based AAAS also publishes the prestigious weekly
journal Science and is the world's largest general science
organization.  For more information, please contact Nan Broadbent
in the AAAS Office of Communications at 202-326-6436.


NOVA UNIVERSITY'S GRADUATE CATALOG ON INTERNET

Nova University's Center for Computer and Information Sciences is
pleased to announce that its graduate catalog is now readily
available to the Internet community.  For an online graduate
catalog, send an e-mail message to:

        cciscat@alpha.acast.nova.edu

This system is automated.  The catalog is nearly 5700 lines, so
you may want to redirect the output into a temporary directory.

Internet users will find the catalog especially interesting in
that the Center for Computer and Information Sciences has a
variety of programs and degree offerings using a continuum of
real-time and delayed-time computer-mediated communication.


VTLS Z39.50 CLIENT NOW INTERFACES WITH NCSA MOSAIC FOR MS WINDOWS

VTLS Inc. announces that it now has a World Wide Web server and
has developed a means for its VTLS Z39.50 client to interface with
WWW browsers such as NCSA Mosaic for MS Windows.  The interface
means that Mosaic users who have the VTLS Z39.50 client on their
workstations will be able to search the client by simply clicking
on a hyperlink in the WWW browser. A simple change in Mosaic's
configuration is all that's required to implement the interface.
The interface gives users the advantage of creating WWW hypermedia
links to Z39.50 servers, which can then be incorporated into WWW
hypertext documents.

+ Page 9 +

As a standalone product, the VTLS Z39.50 client lets users search
for and access bibliographic records residing on any database
server, regardless of its hardware or software configuration, as
long as the server's retriever software complies with the Z39.50
standard. Since no commands are required, first-time users can
navigate the client aided only by screen icons and menus. Users can
type in any word or combination of words to perform a variety of
searches on a remote server and can assign up to six attributes to
a search item in order to narrow the search field. Further, with
the Z39.50 client users can view multiple result sets
simultaneously.

For additional information, contact Dimitri Krinos, VTLS Inc.,
703-231-3605, Fax: 703-231-3648.
