VTLS CREATES NATIONAL UNION CATALOG FOR FINLAND

The Automation Unit of Finnish Research Libraries, Finnish
Ministry of Education has contracted with VTLS Inc. to create a
national, online union catalog containing holdings of all the
Finnish academic and some other research libraries.  The union
database is part of the automation plan known as LINNEA (Library
Information Network for Academic Libraries), consisting of 22
libraries throughout Finland that use the VTLS integrated, online
library software.

The national union catalog, called LINDA, will reside on a
dedicated Hewlett-Packard 3000/992/100DX computer.  The machine
is located at the Computer Center of Helsinki University and is
connected to FUNET, a data communications network already linking
the local area networks of Finnish universities.  The dedicated
machine is configured for 400 simultaneous users.

The project is taking place in two phases.  In the first phase,
which began in November 1992, VTLS extracted the bibliographic
and authority records from nine of LINNEA's libraries.  In the
second phase, the records will be loaded into the union database.
After the initial load, LINDA will contain approximately 1.8
million records, and will grow by 250,000 records annually
thereafter.  All the records will be stored in FINMARC.

For additional information contact Gail Gulbenkian, VTLS, 703-
231-3605.

AUTO-GRAPHICS TO OFFER GPO DATABASE EXTRACTION SERVICE

Auto-Graphics, Inc. will offer libraries the ability to extract
profiled bibliographic records for government publications from
its Government Documents Catalog Service (GDCS) database, both
retrospectively and on a continuing basis.  The service will
begin March 31, 1993.

The Auto-Graphics service will include a number of options:

     One-time retrospective extraction of GPO records from the
     GDCS database for load to online systems, performed by Auto-
     Graphics, based on a predefined profile.  Single or multiple
     holding library codes can be accommodated.

     Ongoing extraction of new GPO records (adds, changes,
     deletions), processed locally by the subscriber from the
     current GDCS CD-ROM disc.  Users may change their extraction
     profiles monthly.

     Corresponding LC name and subject authority records, barcode
     number generation, record printouts, and shipping list
     records.

Subscribing libraries will select materials for which they want
records extracted using an easy-to-use item selection disk
program provided by Auto-Graphics.

For additional information contact Ruth Rubio-Rogerson, Manager,
Library Subscription Products, Auto-Graphics, 3201 Temple Ave.,
Pomona CA 91768, 909-595-7204 or 800-776-6939, ext. 323, or fax:

BIP TO UNDERGO MAJOR CONVERSION

On April 1, R.R. Bowker will launch a new system of data
acquisition, validation, and delivery--called BowkerPower--and
begin transforming its database from repositories of information
into dynamic, intelligent, information networks.  Books in Print,
the first database to be converted, will not only be able to
communicate directly with other databases, but will even scan,
scrutinize, and correct its own records.

Over the spring and summer of 1993, Bowker's traditional methods
of communication, classification, and output will be changed by
the following three-part program:

+ Page 3 +

1. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

Books in Print soon will be on duty 24-hours a day, ready to
capture and disseminate new data as quickly as the telephone line
will allow.  Through EDI, publishers will be able to download
bibliographic information from their own computers directly into
Books in Print via modem or dedicated line.  All the latest
titles, prices, and other data changes can be transferred to
Books in Print just hours after they have been recorded by the
publishers themselves.

The system also will extract and automatically configure
information stored on magnetic tape or diskettes containing
commercial database programs.  For publishers without electronic
transmission resources, Bowker will provide a special software
program developed to interface with the BIP database.

Even manual methods of input and feedback will be accelerated.
Within 48 hours of receipt, data supplied on printed Advance Book
Information forms will be entered into the system.

2. Internal Quality Control & Validation

Through a rigorous program of internal and external data
comparisons, virtually every element that enters the BIP database
will be checked and rechecked for accuracy and consistency.  For
uniform categories such as authors and languages, Bowker will use
Library of Congress authority files.  For categories where no
definitive standards exist--mass-market titles, audience codes,
and series--Bowker will create new authority files based on
industry convention and Bowker standards.  This combination of
universal and customized "authorities" will enable Books in Print
to monitor each title's classification and each bibliographic
component for consistency and error.

To ensure that the internal quality controls are functioning
properly, the BIP database will be compared against LC MARC
tapes; records from Ingram, the leading tradebook distributor;
and many other authoritative sources.  Any discrepancies--from
mismatching ISBNs to price changes--will be identified
immediately and corrected.

3. Customized Delivery Systems

In addition to print, microfiche, online, and CD-ROM versions of
BIP, Bowker will introduce a new species of custom-tailored
products, delivered on magnetic tape or even downloaded directly
into the subscriber's own computer system.  For example, a
scientific research library could select BIP information on
biomedical titles alone, updated on a weekly basis.  The range of
data, update frequency, and delivery format can all be determined
by the individual user.

In addition to revamping its BIP database, Bowker is in the
process of working with others in the book industry to create
universal standards for categories such as audience codes and
mass-market titles.  Future Books in Print enhancements might
include Table of Contents data; separate indexes for anthologies,
collections, and series; and inventory data.

For additional information contact Joan Silinsh, Bowker, 121
Chanlon Rd., New Providence NJ 07974, 908-665-2818.


OCLC TESTS MULTI-SYSTEM ACCESS SOFTWARE

A field test of the OCLC Gateway Software, a UNIX-based package
that provides easy and simultaneous access to various computer
systems, is under way at the University of Cincinnati; the
University of California, San Diego; and the University of
Pittsburgh.

OCLC Gateway Software connects OCLC Cataloging, Interlibrary
Loan, and Reference Services to a wide variety of workstations
and terminals wired to campus networks.

OCLC Gateway Software can provide multiple simultaneous
connections to available services so that users can toggle
between (or among) various systems, such as, PRISM Cataloging and
the library's local system.  Users will not have the
inconvenience of logging off one system to log on to another.
Users need OCLC authorizations and passwords to use the systems,
but additional wiring is not necessary if the hardware is
connected to the institution's network.

OCLC Gateway Software is compatible with many kinds of computer
equipment, ranging from OCLC workstations and PCs running
PASSPORT (OCLC communications software), to Apple and other
computers running VT100 emulation packages, IBM 3270 terminals,
commonly used local system terminals, and other public-access
machines.  All of these can have full PRISM access to OCLC.  They
can also access other computerized services available on the
institution's network.

or Nita Dean 614-761-5002.

INTERNET ACCESS TO LC INFORMATION FILES

The Library of Congress has announced a major new initiative
to increase the availability of its resources to the public.
In a statement before the House Legislative Branch
Appropriations Subcommittee on January 25, 1993, during
hearings on the Library's fiscal year 1994 budget request,
Librarian of Congress James H. Billington said that the Joint
Committee on the Library had approved online access to the
Library's automated information files through Internet beginning
in late April 1993.

These files, containing more than 28 million records in over 30
files, have been available to congressional offices, state
libraries, and cooperative cataloging libraries in the past.  The
files to be offered by the Library include all LC MARC
(machine-readable cataloging) files; copyright files, 1978 to the
present; public policy citations, 1976 to the present; and
federal bill status files.  Both the technical
processing/cataloging system (MUMS) and the reference/retrieval
system (SCORPIO) will be accessible for searches over the
Internet.

The Library has experimented with various forms of remote access
to its public files--initially in a pilot project called ROLLUP,
and most recently in its LC DIRECT fee-based service to state
library agencies.  Online access to Library of Congress databases
is useful to a variety of libraries.  The Internet will provide a
means by which access can be had at minimal cost to all.  No fees
will be charged.

The Library of Congress is able to offer remote access to its
public databases via Internet as a free service, but must limit
its customer support to documentation download over the Internet.
The Library will begin by providing system availability to 60
simultaneous Internet users to ensure that service to Congress
and on-site users is not degraded.  Usage will be monitored to
determine if this number can be expanded if needed, but service
to congressional users will continue to be the Library's primary
goal for its online systems.

Specific details regarding when and how one can connect to the
Library's public online files through Internet will be available
in April.

NEW RLG MEMBERS

The Library of Congress has joined the Research Libraries Group
(RLG) as a general member, formalizing a long-standing
relationship that began in the 1970s.

In addition, the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, Rice
University, and the California Historical Society have joined RLG
as special members, bringing total RLG membership to 126.
