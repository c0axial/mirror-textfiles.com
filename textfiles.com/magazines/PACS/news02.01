FULL-TEXT IMAGE DATABASE IN DEVELOPMENT
 
UMI and H.W. Wilson Company have embarked on a joint effort to
develop a new social science image database to be called Social
Sciences Index/Full Text.  Wilson's Social Sciences Index will
serve as the bibliographic component and UMI will supply
expertise in full-text and imaging technology.  The database will
be updated monthly and will contain full articles from the more
than 350 journals indexed in Social Sciences Index.  Coverage
will be from 1989 forward, and will introduce a new search
software program that features pull-down windows, color schemes,
and easy-to-use menus.
 
Scheduled for release in September 1991, annual subscriptions are
$16,500, which includes the index disc, full-text discs, complete
image workstation, disc storage cabinets, documentation, and user
aids.  There will be a 10 cent charge per printed article.

PHOTO IMAGE ACCESS IN ONLINE CATALOG
 
CARL Systems, Inc. and the Boulder Public Library have announced
the development of photo image access in the CARL System Public
Access Catalog.  The process links photo images to corresponding
MARC records in BPL's bibliographic database, and allows the PAC
user at a PC-compatible terminal to display the images on demand
in the online catalog.  The process supports both color and black
and white photos.
 
CARL Systems and the Boulder Public Library Foundation are
jointly marketing the imaging process and linking software.  For
more information, contact CARL Systems 303/861-5319.
 
 
VTLS ANNOUNCES PROJECTS FOR 1991
 
VTLS, Inc. has announced it will focus on five projects for 1991.
First, the company plans to deliver VTLS on IBM to their
customers.  Second, they plan to create and distribute an
Annotated OPAC, which will permit sound, image and text editing
of image and text documents.  Third, they want to introduce a new
version of Micro-VTLS--a microcomputer-based library system for
smaller collections--that will support integrated graphics and
images.  Fourth, the company is implementing an improved system
of internal quality control that involves every aspect of their
operation--product development, documentation, delivery,
training, support and marketing.  Lastly, they will be making
major enhancements to the OPAC and the Authority Control
subsystem.

HYPERTEXT SYSTEM DEVELOPED FOR CARLYLE PAC
 
Researchers at Indiana University of Pennsylvania used hypertext
and a graphical user interface (GUI) in a project to improve
subject access in the online catalog.  The project is designed to
help people retrieve a more reasonable number of highly relevant
hits from subject searches in large online catalog databases.
 
The test GUI uses icons for author, title, subject, and combined
searches and gives the user a choice of layman, professional and
scholarly search levels.  In addition, it offers a menu of
databases, including books, non-print, ready reference,
magazines, papers, and journals.  It prompts the user to expand
the search if zero hits are retrieved and to narrow the search if
more than 21 hits are retrieved.
 
Dr. Mary Micco, Associate Professor in Computer Science at IUP,
was Principal Investigator for the project and Dr. Linda Rambler,
Associate Director, University Libraries at IUP, served as
Project Director.  For more information, contact Kathy Kane,
Carlyle Systems, Inc., 415/428-3900.
 
 
INFOTRAC 2000 AVAILABLE THRU CARLYLE
 
Carlyle Systems, Inc. has signed an agreement with Information
Access Company to offer the InfoTrac 2000 service through the
Carlyle online catalog.  Network access is also available to
branch libraries and through dial-in access.  Fixed annual site-
license fees follow a sliding scale tied to the library's annual
book budget.  For more information, contact Kathy Kane, Carlyle
Systems, Inc., 415/428-3900.
