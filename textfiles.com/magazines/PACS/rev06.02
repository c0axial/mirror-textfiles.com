Carol Pitts Hawks, OhioLINK: Implementing Integrated Library
Services Across Institutional Boundaries

     This paper discusses the issues and challenges associated
     with the implementation of the OhioLINK system, which
     primarily serves public academic institutions in Ohio as
     well as the State Library.  It provides a brief history of
     OhioLINK, discusses its organizational structure, presents
     decision-making procedures, examines public relations
     strategies, and analyzes issues related to cooperative
     circulation, collection development, and database management
     efforts.
