IDI SELLS ZYLAB

OCLC announced that its subsidiary, Information Dimensions Inc.
(IDI), has sold its ZyLab division to ZyCo Incorporated, a newly
formed corporation controlled by C-CUBED Corporation of
Alexandria, Va.  ZyLab develops and markets ZyIndex, a document
retrieval system for personal computers, and markets ZyImage, a
Windows-based document imaging and retrieval system.  In a
related transaction, ZyCo acquired ZyImage software from PT
Partners, a Maryland partnership.

Jim Hackbarth, IDI president and chief operating officer, said
the sale of ZyLab allows IDI to focus resources on its core
products--the BASIS suite of document database management systems
designed for the client/server environment.  Mr. Hackbarth said
IDI will continue to market ZyLab products and retains a license
to continue to use ZyLab products that are embedded in IDI
products.

Information Dimensions Inc. is an international software company
specializing in information management technology.  According to
independent studies conducted by Delphi Consulting Group, Gartner
Group and International Data Corporation, Information Dimensions'
BASISplus is the leading relational database management system
for documents.
