NEW INTERNET NEWSLETTER

Internet Business Report (IBR) is a primary information source for
vendors and business users looking to create commercial
opportunities on--and thereby bring value to--the global
Internet.

Published monthly, IBR will deliver timely and valuable
information in a concise 8-page format that helps readers to
stay abreast of the vast array of new technologies, services and
products appearing on the net each day.  In addition, Internet
Business Report will track the business alliances being created
to support this fast-emerging new market.

More than a mere pastiche of news clips and sound bytes, IBR will
surface and explore those critical trends and developments
shaping the evolution of the Internet's culture and commercial
infrastructure.  The premiere issue includes a special 8-page
supplement with contributions from:

          Bill Braasch, president of Data Base Architects,
          on how even small firms can use the Internet to
          develop international markets

          Esther Dyson, editor and publisher of Release 1.0,
          on the Internet's potential dark side

          Ed Krol, author of The Whole Internet (O'Reilly &
          Associates), on the whole USENET

+ Page 2 +

          John Markoff, Silicon Valley reporter for The New York
          Times, on getting all the news all the time

          Brad Templeton, president of ClariNet Communications
          Corporation, on selling information services on the net

As well as articles on the Commercial Internet Exchange, The
Electronic Newsstand, the changing policies of commercial
services with regard to Internet mail, and the Internet as the
primary locus of new technology-related business development in
the 1990s.

THE GLOBAL NETWORK NAVIGATOR

O'Reilly & Associates launches a new experiment in online
publishing, The Global Network Navigator (GNN), a free Internet-
based information center that will initially be available as a
quarterly.  GNN will consist of a regular news service, an online
magazine, The Whole Internet Interactive Catalog, and a global
marketplace containing information about products and services.

The Global Network News provides a continuously updated
listing of interesting news items by and about the users of the
Internet, including announcements of new information services.
Each issue will present articles developed around a common
theme, such as government or education.  Regular columns will cover
such topics as how to provide information services on the Internet
or help for new Internet users.  It will have several innovative
departments, such as Off The Wall Gallery, that exhibits in digital
form the works of new artists, and Go Find Out, a section
containing reviews of the Internet's most interesting resources.

One of the most popular features of O'Reilly's The Whole
Internet User's Guide and Catalog, by Ed Krol, is the catalog of
information resources on the Internet.   GNN features an expanded,
interactive version of this resource catalog that can be used
online to navigate to the Internet servers containing those
resources.  The Online Whole Internet Catalog organizes Internet
resources in the following categories:

     - The Internet             - Arts
     - Current Affairs          - Libraries, Reference & Education
     - Science                  - Government and Politics
     - Technology               - Business
     - Humanities               - Work and Play

In the Online Whole Internet Catalog, subscribers can not only read
about these resources, they can actually connect to them with a
click of the button.

Getting good information from a company about their products
or services is almost as valuable as the product or service itself.
The Global Marketplace provides referrals to companies providing
this kind of information online through the Internet.  The Global
Marketplace also contains commercial resource centers in which
subscribers may find white papers, product brochures or catalogs,
demo software or press releases for the companies advertising in
GNN Marketplace.

Global Network Navigator is an application of the World Wide
Web (WWW), developed at CERN in Switzerland.  Users can choose any
WWW browser, such as Mosaic (available for UNIX, Windows, and the
Mac) from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.  In
addition, O'Reilly & Associates will make available Viola, an
X-based hypermedia software environment in which we've developed a
sophisticated WWW graphical browser.  Viola makes it possible to
distribute object-oriented documents that use formatted text,
graphics, icons, and scripts.  All World Wide Web browsers can be
used to access network services such as gopher and WAIS,
independent of the Global Network Navigator.

The Global Network Navigator is available over the Internet
as a free subscription service during its launch.  GNN will be
funded by sponsors who provide commercial information of interest
to our readers in GNN Marketplace and through advertising in GNN
News, GNN Magazine and the Online Whole Internet Catalog.

CONCISE COLUMBIA ELECTRONIC ENCYCLOPEDIA AVAILABLE ON FIRSTSEARCH

Quick, easy access to information in the Concise Columbia
Encyclopedia has been made quicker and easier with its full-text
inclusion in The FirstSearch Catalog, OCLC's online information
service designed for library patrons.

The Concise Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, published by
Columbia University Press, comprises over 18,000 succinct entries
that extend beyond definitions found in dictionaries and includes
cross references to help locate additional information.  A team of
academic advisers reviews each entry for currency and accuracy, and
the Concise Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia is updated monthly.

The encyclopedia is located under the "General and Reference"
category on the FirstSearch topic selection screen.  Article
headings and text are included in a subject search.  Help screens
are designed to assist the user through the searching process.

The Concise Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia is the fourth
full-text database to be made available on FirstSearch.
Disclosure Corporate Snapshots, a database of approximately
11,000 companies filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission; the Business Organizations, Agencies, and
Publications Directory, a guide to international business
information sources; and EventLine, with entries on conventions,
conferences, and symposia, are also available in full text in
FirstSearch.

The FirstSearch Catalog is available from OCLC on both a
per-search and subscription basis.

The FirstSearch Catalog is designed for library patrons, with an
end-user interface that allows patrons to move easily through the
online search process in just a few simple steps, without
training or online searching experience.  With the addition of
the Concise Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, FirstSearch now
offers 38 databases to users.

RLG'S EUREKA NOW AVAILABLE

Eureka, the new easy-to-use patron-oriented search system from the
Research Libraries Group, is now available to interested
institutions.  The system, designed for novice as well as
sophisticated online searchers, provides access to the rich
resources of the RLIN bibliographic files and CitaDel
article-citation and document-delivery service.  Eureka is
ideal for institutions wishing to supplement their local online
services with unlimited campuswide access to these important
resources.

Eureka was previewed by 15 institutions between January and August
1993, with users logging over 60,000 Eureka searches during that
time.  From their feedback, Eureka was modified and enhanced to
become the powerful search system that is available today.

Users require no formal training or special documentation to be
able to perform even the most complex Eureka searches from the
start.  Readily available online help assists users step by step.

Eureka is available by annual subscription or by search block.
With an annual subscription, institutions get unlimited access to
the RLIN bibliographic files.  Subscribing institutions also
automatically receive free access to the newest CitaDel file,
Inside Information, the table-of-contents database just introduced
by the British Library, and a free copy of Ariel, RLG's document
transmission software for the Internet.  A Eureka annual
subscription to the RLIN files also entitles institutions to
substantial discounts on all CitaDel file subscriptions.

Eureka has been designed for easy integration into existing local
online library and campuswide information networks.  It is
accessible from any terminal or personal computer with VT100
terminal emulation; telecommunication options include the Internet,
SprintNet, and direct dial.

For more information about Eureka and annual subscriptions, please
contact the RLIN Information Center, 800-537-7546; e-mail:
bl.ric@rlg.bitnet or bl.ric@rlg.stanford.edu; fax: 415-964-0943.


OCLC EXTENDS REFERENCE SERVICES HOURS AROUND THE WORLD

OCLC Reference Services are now available 23 hours a day Monday
through Saturday, and 20 hours on Sunday.  The FirstSearch Catalog,
The EPIC service, and Electronic Journals Online can be accessed
through the Internet from 3 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Saturday,
and from 6 a.m. Sunday to 2 a.m. Monday, U.S. Eastern Time.

+ Page 6 +

The services are available through other telecommunications systems
from 3 a.m. to midnight Monday through Saturday, and Sunday from
noon to midnight, U.S. Eastern Time.  Later this year, OCLC will
offer its Reference Services 23 hours a day, seven days a week
through all telecommunications methods.

The new hours of availability will be particularly helpful to users
in Europe and Asia.  In London, OCLC Reference Services are
available all day except from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. Monday through
Saturday, and Sunday from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.  In Tokyo, the system
is up all day except from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday,
and Sunday from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Prior to the Aug. 28 extension, OCLC Reference Services were
available 114 hours each week.  Now Reference Services are
available 158 hours each week over the Internet, and 138 hours each
week using other access methods.

As a result of the change, OCLC's PRISM Keyword Searching feature,
which uses Reference Services indexes, will be available beginning
at 4 a.m. instead of 6 a.m., its previous start-up time.  With
23-hour availability, databases will be updated "live"--while the
system is available to users.

For additional information, contact Nita Dean 614-761-5002.
