UMI ACCEPTING NOMINATIONS FOR THE LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AWARD

UMI is now accepting nominations for the Library Technology
Award.  Established in 1991 in cooperation with Learned
Information, Inc., the award honors a librarian who has used
technology to better serve library patrons.

Last year's winner was Randal Putnam, Systems Operator and
Librarian at the Washoe County Library in Reno, Nevada.  He
established an electronic bulletin board system for the
Reno-Sparks area to provide community access to the library
catalog, the Internet, White House press releases, and public
domain files.

Mr. Putnam will serve as the judge for the 1995 Award.  The
winner will receive $1,500, which will be presented in May at the
National Online Meeting in New York.

VTLS AUTOMATES TWO LIBRARIES IN KUWAIT WITH UNIX VERSION OF
SOFTWARE

VTLS, Inc., announced that Kuwait University and the National
Scientific and Technical Information Center (NSTIC) of Kuwait
have chosen the UNIX-based VTLS integrated library automation
software to automate their libraries.  At Kuwait University the
system will run on a Hewlett-Packard Series 9000/800 Model G-40
computer, which supports 69 microcomputers, 14 of which will be
for public access.  At the NSTIC the system is already installed
and running on an IBM RISC System/6000 Model 550 computer that
supports 18 microcomputers, five of which are for public access.
Both systems support Arabic and English via the Windows-based
VTLS EasyPAC, a client interface to the online public access
catalog.

The basic VTLS software package consists of the online public
access catalog, circulation control, keyword searching,
cataloging, authority control, serials control, reserve room
control, reporting and collection management, status monitoring,
and parameters and library profiling.  In addition to the basic
system, Kuwait University is installing the following optional
subsystems and microcomputer-based products: acquisitions and
fund accounting, document delivery, inventory control, journal
indexing, materials booking, UTLAS interface, VTLS Cataloging
Client, and VTLS InfoStation.  With an annual circulation of
113,684, the university libraries house 164,206 volumes, 52
percent of which are non-Arabic books, and 4,512 periodicals, 82
percent of which are non-Arabic.  Kuwait University is the only
national university in the country that is supported by the
government.

In addition to the basic system, the National Scientific and
Technical Information Center has installed the following optional
software: acquisitions and fund accounting, journal indexing,
locally mounted database secondary account, and VTLS InfoStation.
Before the invasion of Kuwait, NSTIC housed 50,000 book titles,
1,300 journal titles, 3,000 technical reports, and 300,000
reports on microfiche.  Today, the library houses only 5,800 book
titles, 757 journal titles, and 2,300 cataloged technical
reports, but the collection is growing.  The library serves 1,200
patrons and has an annual circulation of 5,000.  The NSTIC is a
major library in Kuwait and can be accessed by 400 microcomputers
used by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research.

INTERNET ON-RAMP DESIGNED FOR LIBRARIES

CARL Corporation has announced the availability of its new
Gateway Server product, a pre-packaged, seamless on-ramp to the
Internet designed especially for libraries.  The Gateway Server
is a Unix workstation with prepackaged software, designed to
provide a front-end to any existing hardware platform, local area
network, or mainframe computer.  The server acts as a pathway to
and from the Internet, providing World Wide Web access, Internet
electronic mail capabilities, Gopher search and retrieval,
Telnet, FTP, WAIS, and Z39.50 data transfer services.

CARL Corporation has carefully selected packages included with
the Gateway Server to meet known library needs; for example, a
terminal emulation package is included to insure that any library
terminal or PC using the Gateway Server can emulate a VT100 or a
variety of other terminal types required by Internet hosts.  The
product has been designed to serve any library, not just those
using a CARL system.  CARL Corporation offers a full array of
additional services, including set-up, support, and network
