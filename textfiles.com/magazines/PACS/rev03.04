1.0  Introduction

HYTELNET is a hypertext browser that allows a user to gain almost
instant access to all telnet-accessible sites on the Internet.
It is written for use on an IBM-compatible personal computer,
running as a terminate-and-stay-resident program.
     The purpose of this paper is not to explain the history and
operation of the program (that information can be found in a
previous article). [1]  Rather, this article describes the
different kinds of Internet resources that a user can connect to
with the help of the program.

2.0  OPAC Access

Typically, the program is started from its own subdirectory by
running HR.EXE.  This brings up the START.TXT file (see Figure
1). [2]

If a user selects the SITES1 file, he or she will be presented
with a list of countries that have Internet-accessible OPACs
available for browsing (see Figure 2).

                     <HK000>   Hong Kong
                     <NZ000>   New Zealand
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Selecting any of the files will bring up a list of sites within a
particular country.  The user then selects the library to access.
Each library has its own file, complete with telnet address and
any special login instructions.  Currently, a user can connect to
about four hundred libraries worldwide, including those subsumed
under consortia.
     One feature that users find helpful is the ability to view a
file describing the particular OPAC software in use.
     Also included in the program are lists of sites that use a
particular software interface.  At least twenty-one such
interfaces are in use: BLCMP, BuCAT, CATS, DOBIS/LIBIS, DRA
Altas, Dynix, Geac, Geac Advance, GvB, Inlex, INNOPAC, Libertas,
LS/2000, Multilis, NOTIS, PALS, UNICORN, URICA, UTCAT, VTLS, and
Z39.58.

+ Page 17 +

For example, if a user wishes to see which libraries use URICA,
the file SYS012 would be retrieved (see Figure 3).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

<AT018> University of Canberra
<NZ002> University of Canterbury
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It is then a simple matter of moving the cursor to the
appropriate file and hitting the return key.  Figure 4 shows the
screen that the user sees when he or she chooses the Australian
National University.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

2.    At login, type LIBRARY

OPAC = URICA <OP015>

To exit, use the TELNET escape key.

E-mail contact is helpdesk@library.anu.edu.au
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The user then simply keys in the telnet instructions and connects
to the remote site.  Currently, the IBM PC version of the program
does not make automatic connections.

+ Page 18 +

3.0  Access to Other Resources

Of course, there are other kinds of resources available on the
Internet besides OPACs.  This can be shown by invoking the SITES2
file from the START.TXT file (see Figure 5).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

               <DIR000>  Whois/White Pages/Directory Services

               <OTH000>  Miscellaneous resources

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Let's look at these Internet resources in more detail.
     Archie is a program that identifies what Internet archives
hold a particular software package or text file.  A user can then
retrieve the desired file using anonymous file transfer (FTP).
There are Archie servers in eight countries.
     Campus-wide information systems typically contain general
information about a particular university or college.  Some of
these systems run sophisticated software that allows keyword
searching of appropriate files (e.g., telephone directories).
     There are a number of databases and bibliographies available
on the network, including the Choice book reviews, the Central
Statistical Office Macro-Economic Time Series Data, the Global
Land Information System, and the Meeman Archive (environmental
journalism).  In most cases, the databases are fully searchable.

+ Page 19 +

     Distributed file servers include instructions for connecting
to the latest breed of Internet services: Gopher, Wide Area
Information Servers (WAIS), and the World-Wide Web.
     Many electronic versions of public-domain literary works and
some commercial services are available for searching on the
Internet (e.g., the complete works of Shakespeare, the Lewis
Carroll novels, the Oedipus trilogy, and religious texts such as
the King James Bible and the Koran).
     Free-Net systems are among the most popular sites accessible
on the Internet.  There are currently five Free-Nets available,
with more to be added shortly.  These systems are generally
operated by volunteers, and they contain a wealth of information
on almost every topic.
     General bulletin boards include the traditional library
bulletin boards, plus many FidoNet boards that are now making
connections to the Internet.  Many sites require users to pay a
fee in order to use their boards, and this information is duly
noted in HYTELNET.
     Earl Fogel of the University of Saskatchewan's Computing
Services Department recently adapted HYTELNET so that it can run
on UNIX/VMS machines and make remote logins for users.  To see
this version in action, telnet to access.usask.ca using VT100
emulation and login with "hytelnet" in lower case.  Many other
sites have loaded this software and they will be noted in future
versions of the program.
     Many NASA databases are now fully accessible, including the
Astronomical Data Center, NASA Science Internet Online Network
Data, and the Pilot Land Data System.
     Information concerning other networks subsumed under the
Internet can be found in the files listed in the NET000
subdirectory (listed as "Network Information Services" in Figure
5).  For example, a user can find files describing the activities
of networks in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United
Kingdom, and the United States.  Again, very sophisticated
software is in place for searching.
     A new subdirectory in Version 6.2 of HYTELNET lists various
types of directory services, including USENET contributor e-mail
addresses, white and yellow page telephone directories, and WHOIS
services.
     Finally, there is a file containing miscellaneous resources
that have not been classified.  These resources include such
services as flight plan filing systems, ocean information,
publishers' services, and supercomputer facilities.

+ Page 20 +

4.0  Other HYTELNET Features

Two other files which assist the user in making the most of their
Internet accounts are GLOSSARY and TELNET.  The former lists
terms that a user will encounter during network travel, while the
later gives tips and tricks for using the telnet program.

5.0  Where to Find HYTELNET

Version 6.2 of the program is available via anonymous FTP.  To
FTP the program:

     (1)  At your system prompt, enter: ftp access.usask.ca.

     (2)  At the user prompt, enter: anonymous.

     (3)  At the password prompt, enter: your e-mail address.

     (4)  At the command prompt, enter: binary

     (5)  At the command prompt, enter: cd pub/hytelnet/pc.

     (6)  At the command prompt, enter: get hyteln62.zip

     (7)  At the command prompt, enter: quit.

You will need the PKUNZIP program to "unzip" this file (this
program is also in the pub/hytelnet/pc directory).
     For information regarding the UNIX/VMS version, write to
Earl Fogel at fogel@skyfox.usask.ca.
     For information regarding the Macintosh version, write to
Charles Burchill at burchil@ccu.umanitoba.ca.

6.0  Updating HYTELNET

New sites join the Internet almost on a daily basis.  Members of
the LIB_HYTELNET mailing list, now numbering over 400 people in
twenty countries, forward information to me which I, in turn,
forward to the list.  New and updated files may also be
downloaded via anonymous FTP from the access address above.
Completely new versions of the program are issued every two
months.  To be added to the LIB_HYTELNET list, send a request to
scott@sklib.usask.ca.  (Berkeley UNIX users can obtain
information about the latest version of the program by issuing
the following command at the system prompt: finger
scottp@herald.usask.ca.)
     If you discover any new sites on the Internet, please send
full details to scott@sklib.usask.ca.  You may also send
corrections to login procedures and/or telnet addresses.

+ Page 21 +

7.0  The Future

The author is committed to keeping HYTELNET up-to-date, a task
that will be less burdensome if Internet users provide
assistance.  Telnet-accessible sites will soon be available in
Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, and they will need to indexed.
If you wish to help your Internet colleagues in gaining access to
the rest of the world's knowledge, then sign up!

1.0  Introduction

Navigating the Internet to locate and utilize OPACs and other
information systems is a considerable challenge for network
users.  Users need to: (1) identify what telnet-accessible
systems are available on the network, (2) determine the telnet
addresses for these systems, (3) find out what information
resources are available on each system, (4) use the telnet
command to access desired systems, (5) login to these systems,
(6) search them, and (7) exit and return home to their local
systems.
     Just over fourteen months ago, the only tools available to
network users to help them connect to telnet-accessible OPACS and
other library-oriented systems were two large directory files,
which were often referred to as the Art St. George directory and
the Billy Barron directory.  Both directories provided telnet
site addresses and access instructions.  These documents could be
obtained via anonymous FTP and stored on a local system.
     Several telnet-based network access tools have evolved from
these two directories.  These tools help users identify
appropriate information resources on remote systems, and they
automatically initiate telnet connections to systems that the
user selects.  However, the user is still required to login to
remote systems, and the user must cope with searching a variety
of systems that may differ markedly from his or her local library
system.
     The best known of these telnet-based network access tools
are LIBS from Sonoma State University, California; HYTELNET from
the University of Saskatchewan, Canada; LIBTEL from the
University of North Carolina; and CATALIST from the University of
Delaware.  It is the first of these network access tools, the
LIBS Internet Access Software, that is the subject of this paper.

+ Page 5 +

2.0  Brief History

The LIBS Internet Access Software, or the Sonoma software as it
is often called, is the work of Mark Resmer, Director, Computing,
Media, and Telecommunications at Sonoma State University in
California.  The LIBS software first became available as the
program LIBS.COM in June 1991.  On June 17, 1991, Art St. George
posted a message to the PACS-L list to thank Mark Resmer for
converting the document Internet-Accessible Library Catalogs and
Databases into a searchable database with the facility for
automatic telnet connection.  Mark Resmer announced the first
"production quality" version (1.0) on July 30, 1991 along with a
message about a related list (inet-opacs@sonoma.edu) that he set
up to allow sites to receive announcements about the availability
of new versions of the software.  On February 17, 1992, Mark
Resmer announced to the inet-opacs list that a version for BSD
4.3 UNIX (Berkeley UNIX) systems, LIBS.SH, had been "derived by
running it (the VMS version) through a series of mechanical
translation processes."
     Since then the LIBS software has been further developed to
include not only telnet connections to the over 300 OPACs
available on the Internet, but also to numerous miscellaneous
databases, information services, and campus-wide information
systems.  LIBS also provides for telnet connections to the other
currently available wide-area information access tools: Archie,
Gopher, Netfind, WAIS (Wide Area Information Servers), and World-
Wide Web (W3).

3.0  Current Version

The LIBS software is, like other access tools for networked
information resources, an ever-changing phenomenon.  Currently
available are the VMS version, LIBS.COM 1.5A, and the UNIX
version, LIBS.SH 1.3U.
     It is unfortunate for UNIX sites that the VMS and UNIX
versions are now out of synchronization, and we all await the
promised revision that will bring the two versions into line.
     As with other software developments for access tools to
networked information resources, feedback on bugs and suggested
improvements is welcomed by the developer.  These can be e-mailed
to Mark Resmer (resmer@sonoma.edu).

+ Page 6 +

4.0  Obtaining LIBS

The LIBS software is available for anonymous FTP.  The VMS file
is 345,267 bytes, and the UNIX file is 189,158 bytes.  The latest
updates are May 15, 1992 for the VMS file and February 17, 1992
for the UNIX file.
     Follow these directions to FTP the software from the Sonoma
archive:

     (1)  At your system prompt, type: ftp sonoma.edu.

     (2)  At the user prompt, type: anonymous.

     (3)  At the password prompt, type: your e-mail address in
          the form user@host.domain (e.g.,
          stanton@portia.csu.murdoch.edu.au.).

     (4)  At the command prompt, type: cd pub.

     (5)  At the next command prompt, type: get libs.com (or get
          libs.sh).

     (6)  At the next command prompt, type: quit.

You do not need to use binary mode to transfer these files.

5.0  System Requirements

LIBS runs under VMS 5.0 (or later) or BSD 4.3 UNIX.  The standard
terminal for both LIBS versions is a VT100 (or VT100 emulation).
     Apart from a connection to the Internet, or regional TCP/IP
network, VMS systems must also have appropriate TCP/IP software.
For example, a product such as TGV Multinet or Wollongong is
ideal.  Users of Digital's UCX or the public domain CMU-TEK
software will find that the implementation of telnet in these
packages is not sufficient for all purposes required by the LIBS
software (i.e., sites that require TN3270 cannot be accessed).
     UNIX users do not need any additional TCP/IP software, since
TCP/IP functionality is standard on nearly all UNIX systems.
However, TN3270 software is required and can be found at many FTP
sites.

+ Page 7 +

6.0  Installation

For most sites, it is probably ideal if the software is installed
centrally and updated regularly by a system administrator.  This
is preferable to users having their own copies of the script in
their own account.
     The LIBS software is easy to install, and updates, although
irregular, have been frequent.
     VMS administrators can simply copy the DCL command file into
a common area, grant world read access, and install an
appropriate abbreviation in the system login.com to ensure that
users can easily run the software.
     UNIX administrators can take a similar approach, copying the
shell script into a common area such as usr/local/bin and setting
the correct access permissions.

7.0  Maintenance

The only maintenance requirement is to obtain a replacement for
the software when a new version is announced on the mailing list,
remove the older version, and install the replacement version.

8.0  Local Customization

Some sites may choose to edit the software to reduce the number
of telnet sites that their campus network users can access via
the LIBS software.  Other sites may choose to emphasize access to
local resources and, rather than run the LIBS software as is,
append it to local software.  This can easily be done.  At
Murdoch University, the LIBS software is appended to a local
software application (NetLib).  In this way, campus network users
have an initial menu with options for access to local OPACs in
their state, to OPACs in other states and territories of
Australia, and to international OPACs.  Like the LIBS software,
the NetLib software is made available for both VMS and UNIX
systems.

+ Page 8 +

9.0  Evaluation of LIBS

The features of the LIBS software can be examined in four areas:
(1) software, (2) the user interface, (3) coverage of network
resources, and (4) connections to other wide-area information
access tools.

9.1  Software

Overall, the LIBS software works very well.  The only observation
that most sites would make, and that Mark Resmer mentions in his
announcements, is the time it can take to load the large script
file.

9.2  User Interface

The initial screen offers a menu item for first-time users of
LIBS (see Figure 1, item 6). [1]  By choosing this menu item,
users can view basic information about utilizing remote systems
with LIBS, which includes an explanation of how to exit from
these systems.

When a user selects a particular information resource, the
following screen will display a description of that resource (see
Figure 2 for an example).  Most importantly, the description is
provided prior to the telnet connection and ensures that the user
is informed of login instructions and terminal type information.
The user is always given the options to connect (or not connect)
to the resource and to exit from the LIBS program.

EDIN

The Pennsylvania State Data Center maintains this database of
population and economic statistical data which includes, among
other things, the Commerce Business Daily.  EDIN is accessible
through the EBB service of Penn State.

Note the following instructions carefully

There is a consistent user interface; however, the numbered menu
options are not always in alphabetical order.  This is
particularly true of the screen for "Scientific
Databases/Information Systems."
     The screen messages at all times assist the user to navigate
the system.

9.3  Coverage of Network Resources

LIBS provides access to OPACs, CWIS systems, and other resources.

9.3.1  OPACs

The LIBS software provides users with access to over 300 OPACs.
The initial screen allows the user to select between United
States OPACs and OPACs in other countries.  The United States
menu presents a numbered display of states in alphabetical order.
The other menu presents a numbered display in alphabetical order
by country.  Fourteen countries are included: Australia, Canada,
Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Mexico,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom.
     Once selected, some of these options include OPAC coverage
and collection strength information.  This information is
provided for sites that have given these details to Art St.
George.  This type of information is not comprehensive throughout
LIBS (and also potentially not up-to-date) since it depends on
the contributions made by individual sites to the compiler of the
directory.

9.3.2  Campus-Wide Information Systems

The initial screen also provides access to campus-wide
information systems that are currently available via telnet.
These systems are available in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.  Again, this is a numbered
alphabetical listing; however, the states of the United States
are interspersed with entries for other countries.

9.3.3  Other Databases and Information Services

Numerous databases and information services that cover a wide
range of topics are included.  In earlier versions of the LIBS
software, these resources were presented as a straight
alphabetical listing.  The current version provides for subject-
based access in five broad areas (see Figure 3).

+ Page 11 +

-----------------------------------------------------------------

         Press RETURN alone to see previous menu

         Press Control-C Q <return> to exit at any time

         Enter the number of your choice:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an explanation of these choices:

     o    Agricultural: Two options are available in the current
          version of LIBS.  These options are CSU Fresno
          Agricultural Information and PENpages.

     o    Arts/Humanities: The three options are the American
          Philosophical Association, the Catalogue of Projects in
          Electronic Text, and the Dartmouth Dante Databases.

     o    Business: The option here is for EDIN, a database
          accessible through Pennsylvania State University.

     o    Education: Included here are two options.  The first is
          for the International Centre for Distance Learning
          (Open University) and the second is for the National
          Education BBS.

+ Page 12 +

     o    Science: This subject area is well served with a total
          of sixteen options that include databases and bulletin
          board services.  They are:

               American Mathematical Society BBS (e-MATH)
               Brookhaven National Laboratory
               Environmental Protection Agency
                    Online Library System
               GenBank--Gene Sequence Information
               Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI)
               MEDINFO (University of Pennsylvania Medical
                    School)
               NASA Extragalactic Database
               NASA News
               NASA Spacelink
               National Nuclear Data Center
               National Science Foundation Information Service
               National Space Science Data Center
               Southwest Research Institute Data
                    Analysis/Display System
               Supernet International
               U.S. Naval Observatory Automated Data Service
               World Ocean Circulation Experiment

     o    Weather/Time/Earthquake Information: The three options
          here are for Earthquake Information from the USGS and
          the University of Washington, the National Bureau of
          Standards Time Service, and Weather Information from
          the University of Michigan.

     o    Other: This option is a miscellany of 10 types of
          services, including the Chess Server, DRA Library of
          Congress catalog, FEDIX/MOLIS, and the Geographic Name
          Server.

9.4  Connections to Other Wide-Area Information Access Tools

This front-menu option is a welcome revision to the earlier
versions of LIBS.  The user can now carry out telnet sessions
with five network access tools.  Each of these options includes a
description and, as elsewhere in LIBS, the option to connect.
     The tools listed are Archie, Gopher, Netfind, WAIS, and
World-Wide Web.  The Gopher Server available here is the
University of Minnesota's Gopher.  The WAIS option is for a
connection to the Thinking Machines Server site.  The World-Wide
Web option connects the user to the site in Cern, Switzerland.
     Helpful descriptions of these wide-area information access
tools are provided in LIBS.

+ Page 13 +

10.0  Comparison With HYTELNET

The LIBS software may be compared with another network access
tool that provides automatic telnet connections: HYTELNET, the
work of Peter Scott (University of Saskatchewan).  HYTELNET uses
a hypertext interface for accessing networked information
resources.  Like the LIBS software, in addition to automatic
telnet connections to information resources, it provides the user
with telnet connections to other access tools such as Archie,
Gopher, WAIS, and World-Wide Web.
     HYTELNET evolved from a memory-resident, DOS-based online
directory to telnet-accessible sites to an access tool for both
VMS and UNIX systems.  Initially based on Billy Barron's
directory (UNT's Accessing On-Line Bibliographic Databases), it
now has a much wider scope.  Its coverage is very similar to the
LIBS software, but it is currently much more extensive.  What it
does not have is the subject-based approach to accessing
information resources.
     While the current version of LIBS.COM gives users access to
one site with a Gopher Server, one site with a WAIS Server, and
one site with a World-Wide Web, this is not the case with
HYTELNET.  The latest version of HYTELNET (version 6.2) offers
more than one site for users to explore these additional access
tools.
     The disparity in coverage now apparent between the LIBS
software and HYTELNET may have implications for the longevity of
the LIBS software.  It also raises the question of how sites
choose which type of software to implement for their local
setting.  Another question that is now becoming an issue on some
campuses is the best way to accommodate access to telnet
resources while implementing a Gopher Server.  There are varying
solutions in place around the networks.

11.0  Conclusion

The LIBS Internet Access Software provides a simple and easy-to-
use menu system that assists both new and experienced network
users in accessing the wealth of information resources on the
Internet.  The software is available free of charge and its
installation is simple.  The developer announces new versions and
welcomes information about new sites and software bugs.  The LIBS
software is highly recommended for any and all Internet sites
with a need to provide users with easy access to networked
information resources.
