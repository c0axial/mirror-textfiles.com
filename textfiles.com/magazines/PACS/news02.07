ISI ANNOUNCES NEW CITATION INDEXES
 
The Institute for Scientific Information is developing a new line
of CD-ROM bibliographic citation indexes, with abstracts, for
release in the fall of 1991.  These citation indexes will offer
coverage of the significant published literature in
neurosciences, chemistry, and biotechnology.
 
Each of the three CD-ROM databases will feature searchable author
abstracts as well as ISI's related records feature that links
articles sharing one or more common bibliographic references.
The new databases will also be searchable by keywords, title
words, cited works, authors' addresses, and other options.
 
For further information, call Jacqueline Trolley at ISI, (215)

CARNEGIE MELLON TO IMPLEMENT FUTURISTIC LIBRARY SYSTEM
 
Carnegie Mellon University has teamed up with University
Microfilms International to implement a state-of-the-art
information system providing access to both bibliographic and
full-text databases in the areas of business, social science, and
humanities (general interest databases will also be offered).
The system will employ locally-mounted bibliographic databases on
CMU's multiple-server Library Information System II (LISII) as
well as CD-ROM jukeboxes developed by UMI, which will hold 7.2
million scanned page images.

The system will include a print server and jukeboxes containing
240 CD-ROMs, which will contain scanned articles.  Users
searching databases on LISII will be able to request an article
from a server by electronic mail; the server will then
communicate with the jukeboxes to print the document.  The system
will offer access to over 1,000 journals in full-text and image
formats as well as more than 2,300 journals in abstract and index
formats.

North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 (800) 521-0600, ext. 2210.
