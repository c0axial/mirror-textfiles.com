          In such a night as this
               /bred from the wrong genes
          in such a night
               /seeded within the wrong delta

          will countless letters be inscribed

Before You Were Born
ş Toad the Wet Sprocket
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

        How can it happen that every time
        You ask us this question the answer seems like a lie
        You know what we're saying and you know what it means
        But it never gets through to where you need
                Before you were born someone kicked in the door
                There's no place for you here, stay back where you belong
                Before you were born someone kicked in the door
                You are not wanted here, stay back where you belong
        God damn the people who left you in pain
        God damn the father without face, without name
        God damn the lovers who never showed up
        And God damn the wounds that show how deep a word can cut
                Before you were born someone kicked in the door
                There's no place for you here, stay back where you belong
                Before you were born someone kicked in the door
                You are not wanted here, stay back where you belong
        And how can it happen now that you know the cause
        That nothing is changing and everything's wrong
        But pain is the healing and the tears sting like alcohol
        Just keep on there breathing
        We'll help you down the long, long road back home

Bitter And Shaken
ş Julie Marquardt
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Remember -
the instant you swore you'd never forget...
the moment when you first met. 

when in his eyes -
you saw no lies -
(only ties)
little did you realize...

you had been taken.
sadly mistaken.

and when you discovered
that second lover -
you parted ways.
lonely strays.
forever.

and now it seems -
he is in your dreams...
always.

when you're awaken
bitter - and - shaken
the sheets twisted beneath you
HE IS THERE -

HE IS THERE...

inside you.

beside you.

like glue.

with each night that passes
ever so slow,
you grow to know -
you WILL never forget -
the instant you REGRET...

the moment
when you first met.

 most importantly, humanity - collide."  Ä Hole's 1991 biography




Dying In Your Absence
ş Twilight
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

the rigid cold of the metal chair
shoots up my spine
the cloud of grey loneliness
suffocates, blankets, chokes me
a hole pierces right through
my now empty heart
for inside, you have died
you have left me.
i mourn you, i mourn my loss
but yet, you breathe still
you just have forgotten me.
too busy, wrapped up in your own life
while i, constricted by mine
still made the time for you,
my love, my one source
of pure happiness and consolation.
who would have ever thought
that my comfort
would become my despair...
i fear that you will lose me,
i do not trust my aching heart
for as it found yours in its time of need
it may find another...
another in this pool of neglect
in this riptide of gripping sadness
that plagues me in your absence
that is so prolonged...
will you not come to me
will you not let me know how much
i am loved...
in not only meaningless words
that soothe only temporarily
as the real pain endures...inside.
if one cannot make time...
then what is the point
in loving at all?
come to me, live inside of me
show me that you care
for i surely will die as well
enduring this death of you.





First Time
ş Calvin Sayles
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

gentle lights lift us
featherlight, aloft, we bathe.
smiling, spinning, circling,
humming, black-dizzy, anxious fainting
surrendering to the darkness.
crossing over
no touching, yet bonded...
a desperate and pleasing ache.
dance with me,
high in the cool night air
while points of light encircle us.
explosions, phosphorous green,
eruptions, burning cinders of red
ice blue flame, so pure, only the mind can see.
white shimmering radiance.
engulf me now...and I will engulf you
swallow me, and I will you
drown in me...drown me
whispering, whispering
drown in me

Fistfuls
ş Gena Schwam
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Throwing fistfuls of dried leaves
at your window
they can't break the glass
but i like to watch the
orange reds and yellow greens 
dance around in the air
a party outside your window

the glass makes a whistling sound

i'm clenching fistfuls of chestnuts
just found 'em today
on the sidewalk 
irregular brown blotches
so similar to your eyes
hard and cold
pinching my skin
i throw them at your glass
breaking
shattering the window
how brittle for 
the musky air of October

now i've got fistfuls of blood
from where my nails
pressed too hard into the 
soft flesh of my palms
i can't throw it at you
like the leaves and the nuts
but i can smear my red heat 
on your shattered window pain
a signature

a last reminder
tiny red half-moon shapes
but you're not home again




"  'Meow', she moans, mimicking a cat.  'Meow'.
   'That's what the kitty says.  And what does a doggy say?' Love asks.
   'Woof, woof, woof!' Frances Bean barks.
   'And what does a ducky say?'
   'Quack, quack, quack!'
   'And what does Frances Bean say?' I ask.
   The child lifts her head from her mother's pillowed chest, then raises her
 hands in the air like claws.  Suddenly she begins to growl in a voice as 
 terrifyingly grizzled as any angry, grunge-encrusted rocker's.  'Arrrgggrr!'
 she lets loose.
   Love pretends to be scared and hides her face in her hands.
   Frances Bean laughs at her mother's fright and growls again.
   'Arrrgggrrr!'
   Love hides her face.
   'Arrrgggrrr!'
   Surprising Frances Bean, Love ferociously begins to growl right back.
 'Arrrgggrrr!' she goes, mimicking her daughter's inherent Kurt-like cry.
 'Arrrgggrrr!'
   Frances Bean stops her laughter.
   'Don't scream.  Don't scream, Mommy.'
   Love stops her cry.
   The child places her tiny hands on her mother's cheeks.  'We be gentle.'"

Frantic Zone
ş Nicole Couch
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

Skylight's dim
Sonic's freight
Uncontrollable misfit
Contractable fate
The seduction began
Realized too late
Easy to see
There's no escape

A regression of time
An intrinsic state
Been sabotaged
With too many weights
A solid approach
To the tailored plans
To hold on to
The ultimate game

In the frantic zone
Taking hostage by insanity
In the frantic zone
Intangible security
Look around
It's not so hard to believe
Hear the sounds
The answer is so hard to see

The showage of
Starts with sanitude
The masterminds 
All break rules
The seduction began
Realized too late
It's easy to see
There's no escape

In the frantic zone
Taking hostage by insanity
In the frantic zone
Intangible security

Hiding Out On Halloween:  Videos To Ease The Guilt
ş Drew Feinberg
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

Halloween is almost upon us, coming quicker than Hugh Grant in a BMW.  As 
Meg Tilly so brilliantly asked in the cinematic disaster known as Body
Snatchers, "Where ya gonna go?  Where ya gonna run?  Where ya gonna hide?"
Eloquently, she voices the dilemma of millions of Americans every
October 31.  I've done them all, with less than optimum results.  Let's 
run through the options, shall we? 

Okay, first there's trick-or-treating.  Being a greedy bastard and 
visiting every house within a 20 mile radius, hitting them up for the
goods, is socially acceptable as child, but, three years ago, when I was 
dressed as Zsa Zsa Gabor and asked all of my neighbors to "Give me some 
candy, DAHLING, or I'll give you a slap," the results were less than 
desirable.  From what I can remember I got assorted candy bars, candy
corns, rocks, kitchenware, lollipops, and a jack o'lantern, still lit -
THROWN at me, with great velocity.  I can't even spell the names people 
called me, and I was told to do things to myself that aren't even 
physically possible, lord knows I've tried.  One grandmotherly looking 
woman was actually kind to me, and gave me some popcorn.  My faith in 
mankind had been restored, that is, until I heard the muffled call to her 
husband "Come see this poor slow boy.  It's lovely to see the mentally 
challenged out and about."  At the tender age of 23, I retired from trick- 
or-treating forever. 

The next year I opted to stay home, watch some scary movies, and give
wondrous candy to the the legit trick-or-treaters.  The candy aisle at the
supermarket was pure pandemonium.  I might as well have been looking for
the last green Power Ranger on Christmas Eve.  I didn't want to be one of
those houses that gave out nickels, fruit, hard bubble gum, cream soda
Dum-Dums that stuck to the paper, black licorice, those awful dark
chocolate Hershey's Miniatures, or Smarties.  Honestly, do people ever BUY 
Smarties for themselves?  I made a quick scan of what was available, and 
I saw some variety packs of assorted good chocolate stuff that the 
others had apparently not seen.  I made a mad dash to get two packs.  I 
popped 'em in my cart and very confidently strolled to the checkout 
counter.  The line was huge, and I noticed the elderly woman behind me had 
nothing in her cart but a box of Metamucil, so I let her go in front of 
me.  I started to sing along with the muzak..."Precious and few are the 
moment we two can shaaaaaaare..."  CRASH!  I looked to my side and saw 
this huge pyramid of canned beets topple over.  "Hope that wasn't my 
singing," I thought to myself, then turned back.  Quicker than I could say 
"The cast of Wings should be sterilized," my treasures were GONE!  I was 
completely bewildered.  I was shocked when I looked in the cart ahead of 
me.  The woman I had sacrificed selflessly for had two bags of assorted 
chocolates along with her Metamucil.  I tried to conceal my anger and 
kindly said to the woman "Excuse me, I think those are my Halloween 
candies there."  I believe she mouthed the words "Bite me."  I walked 
right up to her cart and reached in and picked up what was rightfully 
mine.  That's when she started bawling hysterically, which caused the 
entire supermarket to glare in my direction.  I was frozen like Jennifer 
Tilly would be if you aimed a flashlight at her eyes.  I was never so 
furious AND so humiliated; I just stood there with my hand in the 
metaphorical cookie jar.  I slowly backed out of the store, and still 
candyless, I decided to go to a convenience store, where I bought 50 
Chunky bars.  A mixture of chocolate nuts and raisins makes my stomach 
turn, but hey, I didn't have to eat 'em.  I had enough Chunky bars to 
feed a small South American country, or Marlon Brando.  I sat down and 
started to watch Halloween.  Before the opening credits were
finished, the doorbell rang. "Trick Or Treat," I was greeted by a child
and his mother.  "Here ya go, fella," I smiled as I handed him a Chunky. 
The child glowed; the mother frowned.  "Michael is ALLERGIC to nuts. 
Don't you have anything else?" she inquired.  "Umm...n-n-no..." I
stammered.  The mother ripped the treat from her son's hand and handed it
back to me, setting Michael into a temper tantrum.  "I'm really sorry," I
managed to say.  "Thank you, thank you VERY much, it was his first
Halloween and you ruined it for him.  Aren't you proud of yourself?" she
sneered as she stormed off.  I sighed, shrugged, and went back to my
movie.  Five minutes later, more doorbell.  Two teenage girls dressed
up - looked like the girls from Clueless, gum chewing and all.  "Like,
trick or treat." I handed them two Chunky bars, which appalled them. 
Clueless #1:  "Like HELLO, do you KNOW how many grams of fat are in a
Chunky?  Only like a MILLION!"  and handed it back to me.  Clueless
#2:  "Geez Louise, don't you have any like Snackwells or fat-free potato
chips?" and deposited El Chunky back in my hand.  And so it went all
night.  Kids whining about chocolate, kids complaining about raisins, kids
bitching about options; in 4 hours I got through about 15 minutes of my
movie.  And got stuck with 45 Chunky bars.  Hey, you want a Chunky? 

Last year I tried another great Halloween option - the costume party.  I
bopped on down to "Costumes R Us" to rent one, which was oh-so-wise to do
on Halloween day.  Sparse selection?  The place was emptier than Jenny
McCarthy's skull.  Let me tell you, all eyes were focused when I stumbled
in the door as a huge orange box of Tide.  I felt about as mobile as
Gilbert Grape's mother.  I scanned the room and saw assorted Beavises,
Ticks, Shannon Dohertys, Newt Gingriches, and one big orange blob.  I
went straight to the punch bowl and then mingled about.  Everybody bored
me, and they all seemed to be staring at the monstrosity that was my
costume.  Then I saw her, the woman I would spend forever with, the woman
who wouldn't bitch at me for drinking milk out of the carton.  She was a
twin of Mia Wallace (a.k.a. Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction), and she looked
me straight in the eye, walked up to me, and what followed was a few hours
of engaging conversation; this and my never-empty punch cup kept me in
seventh heaven.  In the middle of debating which was more torture,
watching the OJ trial or watching a Mickey Rourke movie, she blurted out
"Do you always talk so much before you a kiss a girl?"  That was all the
invitation I needed.  I wrapped my arms around her and kissed.  It was just
like the movies...the world started to spin in a little circle, like in a
DePalma film, except it made me dizzy, and I suddenly realized it wasn't
the kiss, but the heavy imbibing at the punch bowl.  I lost my balance,
which is not a smooth thing mid-kiss.  The huge Tide box caused me to
stumble and I held my love tight, knowing she would be my rock and prevent
my imminent falling, but my feet became entwined with hers and I fell
forward, taking Mia Wallace with me.  I could see her expression of horror;
the girl I so wanted to impress was being crushed by Mr. Tide himself.  I
believe the words that she used were "Jesus, I can't feel my legs!"  I
struggled and squirmed, as Batman and Thor managed to pull me off of her,
but by then it was too late.  Physically, Mrs. Wallace was fine, but she
was none too pleased with my squashing her, inadvertent as it was.  In
fact, everybody at the party just sort of glared and pointed at me until I
left in utter shame.  No more Halloween parties for ME, thank you very
much. 

Don't walk down the same unpaved road as I did.  Learn from my mistakes,
my friend.  This Halloween, hide out with some friends, turn off on the
lights and rent some movies.  Try a couple of these; you'll thank me
later.  Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, Frankenhooker, Carrie, The
Shining, Evil Dead 2, Dead Alive, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The
Exorcist, and Re-Animator.  When the doorbell rings, don't answer it.  
There's no shame.  In fact, I've found that detaching the doorbell all 
together makes things much more pleasant.  And if you turn the volume up 
really loud, you can't even hear those little fists knocking.

I Am Trash Too
ş Carolyn Hitt
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

rage to be delivered from the slippery catacombs of your innocence and 
your youth thinking i am a god but I am simple though you would make me a 
novel a painting a work of art I am trash too i am trash too i am trash 
too and maybe if you peeled the honey glazed wax from your eyes you would 
see that i am trash too and i though a granite slab may seem am but 
mortal in my confusion so don't tempt me with the virgin bulge in your 
leather because what's to say i won't bite my fangs are sharp and pierce 
without recognition and you won't know what sucked the life out of you 
til you are lying there helpless like raw chicken on the concrete the 
shards of me slicing at what you thought you owned - so don't fuck with 
what you don't know

            I'd watch you above in crinoline
            Upon the border of white beach and wave
            Arboreal, you'd sway on the interface
            Of endless ocean under endless sun.

            I'd wash you over in off-white gingham
            To your hair afix a pewter pin
            Remove the sand of yet one more day
            And shower you in kisses.

I drew up my knees
In second class
And watched in the blue light

Strangers beside me
Strangers across from me
They've closed their eyes
So far away from home
The empty stations echo
As we go dreaming by

I miss you like crazy
I wish that you were here
Holding me

So many times
I see something
I want to show you
Like the crazy man
Crying on his violin
I game him two drachmas for you

And every city square
Pigeons everywhere
Fountains and painters
I sit upon the step
My chin upon my knees
I watch lovers go by

I miss you like crazy
I wish that you were here
Holding me
Because you give me peace
You give me hope
I love you

Of course - there are other men
Sharing in the sways and bends
Of Paris and Rome
And though I do not know
Exactly what the difference is
I never asked them home

It made me realize
How beautiful and strange
Is the bird of love
It flies so differently
Cries so differently
From the bird of whatever the other

I miss you like crazy
I wish that you were here
Holding me
Because you give me peace
You give me hope
I love you
Do I give you something too

I was on a train
Somewhere in Spain
Sometime in the night
I drew up my knees
In second class
And watched in the blue light

Inside
ş Twilight
ùúùúùúùúùú

echoing, the silence
ricochet against concrete walls
resounding emptiness
void of nothingness

alone in the crowd
red haze infests eyes
prickly skin of armor
stay away

false love won't seep in
for long
no need, self-sufficient
go away, begone

hurt
bludgeoning innards
turmoil trapped within
no escape

hate the ones i love
ghost of a face
i don't exist
i don't care

but i do.




"When she was in second grade in Eugene, Oregon, she was having a lot of 
 nightmares.  I had no idea what to do.  I took her to a psychiatrist just
 to try to find some way to bring her some solace.  The psychiatrist said
 part of the problem with her was that she needed to join Girl Scouts.  She
 needed to be in normal kid activities.  I dutifully went to a Brownies
 meeting with her...I could tell it was really hard for her to be in this
 room with all these kids.  The person who was the Brownies leader suggested
 they have an art show.  She asked all the kids to draw something.  The
 things that Courtney drew were always startling.  She didn't draw sunsets
 and apple trees.  She would draw sort of...*wounded figures*.  I can still
 see her that day - her little face so intense with those crayons.  At the
 end of that, the teacher told the troop that they were going to see what
 drawing they liked the most by holding them up one by one and everyone
 applauding.  I knew that this would be terrible for her.  When it got to
 hers, she just grabbed it and ran over to me, and we left.  At that time,
 when a child was exhibiting the kind of pain Courtney was exhibiting - a
 lot of nightmares and a lot of crying and hating school and hating 
 *everything* - the treatment was pretty much to try and make that child 
 what they called 'normalized' rather than saying, What kind of creature is
 this, and how can we make her be O.K. with who she is?  That whole belief
 system was really awful for her."  Ä Linda Carroll, mother of Courtney Love

You withdrew your tongue

"Courtney is very strong-willed and *not* afraid.  I tend to be like that,
 too, but that can work to your detriment, because people think you're just
 loud and obnoxious when it's just having a point of view...People are 
 intimidated by a woman who has an opinion...Rocksters spend a lot of time
 debating whether she's a junkie, or she's a bad mom, or did Kurt write her
 last album.  Gossip focuses on the negative.  But that fuels her.  The more
 you hate her, or slag her off, that inspires her.  She takes all that stuff
 and puts it into her work."  Ä Amanda de Cadenet




Last Waves
ş Gena Schwam
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

It seems they're dead
lifeless squalls
no more thrashing whitecaps
like whipped cream 
capping the great blue waters
so vast and tumultuous
the waves are gone

squalid pools lie everywhere
the ocean is still
the blue-green screaming hushed
looks like velvet 
a cloth covering for the
muddy crust
dead sand piled up high
debris settles across the floor

the waves have stopped 
standing water
like piles of liquid filth
you can't even walk anymore
the water has died
the fish now float
everywhere bloated scaly bodies
insipid mist on the horizon
where used to be seaspray
damp humid fishy air
has replaced the glory of
the waves
the colossal rainbows
the foamy mist

i stood and watched them die
on the cliffs 
the last wave crashed at my heels
saturating me
i am the witness
the only one
the blood-lined mist curled
around me
sealing me in the present
trapping me in the sorrow
i was too a fish
lacking oxygen
gasping helplessly as
the waves ended

Loved Ya To Pieces

Such a lovely day
The sun was shining down on cell thirty-seven
God, turn this water into whiskey sour
Pay you back if I get to heaven
No one to love or need, think I'm lonely
Judge wouldn't pardon me, he only gave me
A life long lease in a house that's ugly,
And a maid that's big and mean

Loved ya to pieces more than life
Loved ya to pieces, cut like a knife
Preacher spoke and grown men cried,
Rest in pieces from your sweet little wife

It was my last cigarette 
And I was looking back on you
You were so damn sweet, lying in my sister's,
Lying in my sister's bed
Turn the other cheek, that's what they told me
Lasted for a week, then they sold me
A six-inch blade with your name written on it,
A gift from me to you

Loved ya to pieces more than life
Loved ya to pieces, cut like a knife
Preacher spoke and grown men cried,
Rest in pieces

Now I might sound a little bitter, baby
But you know what I'm talkin' about
You know it's cold inside, cold inside
Yeah, I loved you too much
Couldn't stand to see you
Touching someone else
Why not me

Loved ya to pieces more than life
Loved ya to pieces, cut like a knife
Preacher spoke and grown men cried,
Rest in pieces

Loved ya to pieces more than life
Loved ya to pieces, cut like a knife
Preacher spoke and grown men cried,
Rest in pieces from your sweet little wife

I see your face just above the waves
I hear your voice whispering away
I wish you would come to stay
but you're not here, and I'm alone again...

I see your shadow overcast by the moon
you feel so close I could almost touch...

Alone, breathing in the dark
empty eyes greet me every night
volatile words born up in mid-flight
beautiful shapes with empty arms hold me tight.

When you're not here, my world isn't such.
king of misery and beggar of love
my chaos goes up in flames of alcohol
as daybreak shines upon my restless soul.

I may not be right, my heart could lie
time could play cruel games on us
life is not life, and the future may die
but I know our shadows were not meant to part.

I was wrong.




Motherlove
ş Marco Morales
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Torn apart by the wrong of a child
who, disobedient, left the house
in dubious company, with older lads
dirty, rotten in their smoke and drugs
cries the mother, to see her child depart
so innocent, so sweet, so far.

She awaits in sorrow, in the dark
on a solitary chair in an empty house
void of laughter, pregnant with silence
looking blearily at the wall, white, stark.
pondering what woeful wrongdoings
might her stolen sibling act.

Sadly, the unforgiving hours drag,
while by the minute, she falls apart
in the spinning room of her heart.
Impotent, letting out a quiet cry
her tears burn her blinded eyes,
'til her blood runs thick, sad, dry.

On a blue tiled floor she lies,
lost in frilled remembrance of the past
when her suckling toddler
a breast greedily grabbed,
when falling, taking refuge in her hand
as he walked for the first time.

Then, after many years and a day
in a sudden, angry sway
the cherubin became a young man
drawn to concrete jungles, rage,
rejection of the love of a mother
because he was older in age.

Without a kind letter or parting goodbyes
he left, with a pack of prowling fiends.
He shaved his head, lived his sins
while burning, unwatched, her mother's eyes.
Now she mourns, now she weeps
her cries blue, infinite as the skies.

With echoing noises, pots and pans
forced from the cupboard, with a hand
she wipes her tears, prepares dinner
opens his bed, sees herself thinner
and motherly, with the heartfelt hope
that her son will, soon, come back home.

My Maple Tree Holds Green...

                my maple tree holds green
                close to its heart
                clutches it there
                to try to keep it longer
                while hot color implacably
                touches leaves hundred by hundred
                faster each crisp day
                tips turned crimson like
                a young girl's painted fingers
                here and there a flagrant cluster
                bleeds lipstick red
                in gold
                profusion.

                i think it dreams
                and dreads 
                knowing winter is coming on
                remembering outer branches stripped naked
                diamond bright fused with ice and
                aches knowing
                no futile hope.
                (how many times has it known death)
                it gives a little more to the cold
                each night.  remembering.
                how little time it will hold any green
                and how its core will hold onto
                pain after the killing frost
                remembering
                the summer that was lost.




My Misery
ş Phantom Blue
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

God only knows that sometimes
It's hard to even fake a smile
It gets so old looking at these city lights
So dark and lonely, but I'll be all right
I'm praying

My misery, 
Bring it down, come and take it from me
My misery
Love is careless in just who it might see
My misery

So far away
Closer than those who are surrounding me
Something's reaching, something unseen
Keeps coming over me and calling my name

My misery

 which she is.  It's about speaking in the voice of the anguish of the

Naked My Maple No Longer Shelters Me...

        naked my maple no longer shelters me
        from the eyes of the neighbors across the parking lot.
        all summer curtained in green
        i had no need to pull the shades or draw the drapes.
        now overnight stripped of foliage
        i am exposed to the world and 
        no longer can lie uncovered on my bed
        basking in sunlight that streams
        east of verdant shadows onto my sheets
        caught in a baroque cluster of dangling crystals
        refracted on my walls in a flutter of rainbows.
        i console my tree - but you are still beautiful
        naked branches in crisp line 
        reaching cleave the sky just as bones
        stripped of flesh have beauty
        piercing unlike the tender applecheeks of youth
        with all that is easy torn away
        so what remains of bones
        stark empty branches
        shape of true beauty one can hold
        run a finger along the underlying structure
        hardness of joint snap of twig
        think - mystery of cell and cell wall
        electricity to make the fluid flow
        urge the surge of sunlight driven sap in spring
        and know the quiet waiting
        the patience of winter.
        my maple tree flows now in dark lines
        silhouetted against the white sky
        a delicate extension upward
        fragile and elegant
        a graceful fall of branches 
        bends with its own weight
        curves toward the glass of my window.

The last breath has left me
empty
my diaphragm caving in
the soulless night cracking
above me into
rain
endless and shameless
bleating whispers
pleading with the sky
not to break
not to rain

my carcass will decay
my beauty will cease,
fleeing from the taut dried
flesh that once pulsated
in rhythm with my heart
my cheeks rose and fell
imperceptibly
they have fallen 
finally

so i lie here
not a woman anymore
a corporeal female body
in the slush
in the rain
my eyes match the sky
drained and wet
dripping all it has left
pouring out all the tears
one final time
a sigh into the bliss

no more dreams
an alternate reality
here beneath the hidden moon
my hair grows no longer

 have no quest for that - I talk about her more than anything else in these
 posts because she is special.  She knows I have hopeful and loving feelings
 towards her even though I think she has an impossible and continuing
 destructo vibe.  Drugs make her (and just about anyone I've known)
 confused/confusing and lousy to be around.  Her existence and consciousness
 since Kurt's suicide is so extremely traumatized that I will never fathom her
 self-impression.  I can only hope she can get away from body-politic as
 body-mutilation.  She knows I know she's beautiful, but chemical obliteration
 clouds the reward and the romance.  She likes music for the musician - who is
 the hero (who she can be).  And she wants Buddhism - which is the worshipper
 worshipped.  She can have all this without being crushed by inner and
 societal conflict.  I see her happy, forgiven and pure.  She's gonna have to
 believe in herself this way for the good of her own being and for that of

Throwing myself down,
Flung upon the ground -
The Earth embraces me
As my elbows dig trenches 
Into the dirt so soft...
Packed, yet still...comforting
Pillows of protection.
Into my mouth,
I taste the rusty scent -
Pouring down my throat,
Choking my gasps
As teardrops fall all about
To form tiny droplets of shiny, new mud
In my now tangled swarm of tresses.
Shoveling underneath my fingernails,
I scratch until they bleed -
Furrowing rows into the soil -
Like a rake.
Trying to become one
With that of a lost soul,
Someone taken away so abruptly from me...
Crying helplessly -
Come back...
Torn up and tattered -
I can't go on without you...
Upon this grave -
Oh, please God, PLEASE...
Of yours.

The Betrayal
ş Marco Morales
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

I - The Fall

Her soft hands and sweetness blinded my soul, how was I to know?
As I fell I touched the sun, and its burning, twisting flames
devoured my love in a ravenous rave of wrenching glow.

My mind burnt and buried, wriggling worms wreck body and being
Ripping skin, reducing organs to a rotting wound
while the cemetery's black earth, cold, cruel, cranks my lifeless limbs.

The stone-grey skin, pierced by skewing roots weaves into decay
to feed blind trees, deeply rooted into hellbound graveyards.
Flaming screams, churning my throat, burning coal through my innards,
push tears of fire through a tight grimace, sending my soul astray.

How can anything hurt so much?  I crave physical pain
to liberate the mind from the broken pieces I am.
No freeing death nor comforting oblivion from pain's dart,
condemned to coexist with love, that hot claw clenching my heart.


II -  Undead

A thousand million worms feast in my intestines,
their acid vomit dissolving a shredded cry.
Love is the door to suffering; a deceiving reception
to the dark, murderous hell of separation.

Is the initial pleasure worth the torments of the soul?
An instant of sublime heightening, fond affection of someone dear
and a lifetime of dreaded sorrow and harsh, lone fear.
Undead by numbness to reality, abandoned to the unknown.

History repeats itself as young lovers burn up in flames
blinded by the folds of love which nurtures their feelings,
mocks affection and posesses the soul like a spider, weaving
the destruction of the poets, plotting, creeping.


III - Solitude

And the worst torment - solitude.  Loneliness, as extense
as the Pacific seas, where there is nothing but blue.
Alone, like the hangman's tree in the open field, rotten through
against the rage of the weather, unbeloved, misunderstood.

The solitude of the lone wolf, sick and old, left behind to die
is like the lonely grievance of a thousand men, quietly drinking,
anonymously hanging onto the bottle, absently singing
voicing the emptyness of their hearts in a howling cry.


IV - Abandonment

Would death help me forget, then come sweet and swift,
lift me off this thoughtless world, and rock me to sleep.
I yearn for dreamless nights and absent days
to die at dawn and repose at night.

Let the blood come gushing out, my life slowly consuming away.
I want to smoke away, to disintegrate, and forget,
like a candle, suddenly blown away.

What else is left in this pompous heart?  Great monuments to knowledge,
hidden treasures and mighty deeds.
What is the use, when there is no reason to live?
Without you.  I merely exist.

Death would forgive me, the pain ease.
but I am unforgiven, unaccounted, undead.  Cannot repose in peace.
Damned to lurk the surface of this earth tormented, mutilated, pierced,
eyes torn out of their housing when lovers kiss.

I still remember how it used to be...


V - Regrets

HOWL!  SCREAM!  CRY OUT!  Let me die, let me out!
Is it so much to ask?  Will no one hear my shout?
I don't eat, I don't smile.  Life is just a buffoon's act.  Watch me laugh!

Angela, Angela, Angela!  'Tis your name in fire branded on my heart.
For every letter, a thousand sufferings,
for every thought, a million tears of blood.

Angela...

That word capable of inflicting the most excruciating pain.
The word that brings lost memories, desperation and anguish
And yet, it was my choice to love you.
What a fool!!  Didn't I know the price to pay?

Did I not know this black day
would finally come, to take you away.
I only want to forget,
and dull the pain.




"And one never knows if letting someone in beyond the barrier, beyond the
 mask that we all pose to the world, letting them see who and what you
 really are, is worth what that one soul can do with this knowledge of all
 your happiness & hardships..."  Ä Robb Buchanan




The Bird
ş Zowie Mills
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

She swoops low, mangled destiny, deliverer of death,
and gathers me up in her unloving arms to soar again. 
Off to the clouds of despair, and to places
untouched by kindness, and unknown to lover's dreams.

In this twisted solace of this my final summit I look out
over a domain cast down, trodden under the feet of Her,
She who so quickly turns away love as if it were a gentle,
but unwanted rain.  Advances over, daunted, my gaze drops.

Times of passion and love return, if only in mind, 
and deliver their mocking messages of pain and darkness.
I look up into the bird's eyes, and what do I see? 
The cold, steel-hard gaze as she looks at her prey of me.

My heart yearns both for release from her talon, as much as
to feel the warmth of her breast.  Indecision is my plague,
inaction my dominion.  Frozen in this abyss, I neither struggle
nor advance. 

And what becomes of the prey?  Perhaps Dianna would tell,
were she here to guide me, as the to-be slain, 
the still-walking dead, am I. 




The Burning
ş Janet Kuypers
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

I take the final swig of vodka
feel it burn its way down my throat
hiss at it scorching my tongue
and reach for the bottle to pour myself another.
I think of how my tonsils scream
every time I let the alcohol rape me.
Then I look down at my hands -
shaking - holding the glass of poison -
and think of how these were the hands
that should have pushed you away from me.
But didn't.  And I keep wondering
why I took your hell, took your poison.
I remember how you burned your way
through me.  You corrupted me
from the inside out, and I kept coming back.
I let you infect me, and now you've 
burned a hole through me.  I hated it. 
Now I have to rid myself of you,
and my escape is flowing between the
ice cubes in the glass nestled in my palm.
But I have to drink more.  The burning
doesn't last as long as you do.

"What Courtney has in her she *came* with.  The reason that I'm a therapist 
 is that I began taking her to therapists by the time she was two, and could
 really find so little help and empathy for both of us in the people I went
 to.  She was in *so much pain*.  And that manifested itself ever since she
 was a little girl in ways in which I had no clue how to deal with.  I had 
 no idea of any way to help her except just to love her and hold her.  When
 I started taking her to therapists, one of the awful things that happened
 was they began to pathologize her, which is what psychology has done with
 what they don't understand.  I think that Courtney came with a tremendous
 sense of pain in her...She's not that different than she was when she was 
 two years old...Yet there are times, even as a small child, she would be 
 really, deeply touched by something.  And when that would happen it was as 
 though every part of her went soft for a little while - including her heart.  
 Even then she was touched by oppression and pain.  It was a part of her 
 that I think was genuinely touched by Kurt.  They were very alike.  I don't 
 know if this is true, because I didn't know Kurt when he was only two, but 
 I suspect that Kurt was pretty different until he was about 9 or 10.  I 
 don't think Courtney was.  I think she has carried this grief longer, and
 maybe that's why she's a survivor, because she came with it and she had to
 learn how to survive with it from the beginning...Strangely enough, she
 was an absolutely, unimaginably calm and happy baby.  She hardly cried."
  Ä Linda Carroll, mother of Courtney Love




The Cheval Glass And The Fountain
ş Jenniffer L. Lesh
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

The old cheval mirror was tired
of its life.  _I'm always
everyone but myself_, it thought,
and walked away from the boudoir.
It wandered through the house and felt
architectural elements move fleetingly
across its surface - crown molding,
sconces, corbels, wainscoting.
Being the echo of this large house,
however solid its contents,
wasn't enough.

The mirror walked outside and filled
to overflowing with the riches
of a garden.  Roses bloomed
in its path and said, _You are too kind
in your compliments_.
Then it met with a woman
stooping by the fountain
who put a withered hand to her face
and fled, crying _You are too harsh!
I hate you!_

The mirror shuddered silverly
and tilted back, clouds skating
across the empty heavens of its gaze.

_I am nothing more than an eye
without a mind behind it_, it murmured.
Waters gurgled assent in the fountain
and the mirror turned towards the sound
and found itself wrinkling
and smoothing on a happy surface.  
The mirror moved closer
and then paused.

Even today,
it stands sentinel there,
reflecting itself infinitely
against this reciprocal welcome,
fascinated beyond belief. 




The Insane People That Are Notably Sane
ş Kylie Johnson
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Shadowed white night
Stark naked you stand
Looking at the land
Eyes obscure from all reality
Stains on your face
Show us not a race
Nor all your grace
But I know
What you are searching for
And how you are alone
And how you fear us
They don't listen
I do, so listen
Listen to me too.

Shadowed white night
Life is all too short
And you need support
With me you will survive
Ne'er perish under this day
Keep memories at bay
Forever I shall stay
Because I know
What you are searching for
And how you are alone
And how you fear us
They don't care
I do, so tell
Tell me if I speak truths.

If you believe me
Then let is show
Sparkle and glow
Show me yourself
Help me to unveil you
For you show the strength
Of more people than those that live.

Shadowed white night
Pictures all aglow but bare
Of things so beautiful and rare
Like things we imagine much
A fantasy world as such
Full of life and love
Pure as a twilight dove
All alive in your mind and mine.

Because I know
What you are searching for
And how you are alone
And how you fear us
But you are my saviour
For I am your shadow
And with you I shall go.




Thinking Of The Dead Child
ş Maree Jaeger
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

The mother
the father
the dead child
and the child
sit together

and the father
(thinking of the dead child)
butters his bread
and says to the child
look at the huge boat sailing
out to sea

The mother
thinking of the dead child
(always thinking of the dead child)
nods and smiles
and stares at the boat
sailing out to sea

and the child
(thinking of the dead child)
looks at the father
buttering his bread
looks at the mother
nodding, smiling, staring, out to sea

and softly half to himself -

I wonder if boats
really go anywhere?

Through The Faces
ş Marisa VanDyke
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

I am here, at the circus
you are there, in the crowd

I may be only 4 feet tall in your world
of many places traveled, many girls romanced
but this feeling is drawing me to you
through all the faces
and I'm walking the tight rope
balancing myself only on empty air
to get to you, before you leave

all past lovers, forgotten friends
are reaching out thier hands
yet I seek your help only
through all the faces
of love, fame, or money
all I see is you

and the gypsy woman tells me
to remove my suit of armour

so I stand vulnerable
waiting to recieve a blow
but strong arms rescue me
and it is you




"What's the season of love if you can't have everything
 What's the reason of love if you can lose everything
 What's the meaning of love, it's a crime if anything
 What's the meaning of love, it's grand..."  Ä Kurt Cobain

Love has taught me well
How to forgive---but not forget
How to smile---but more to frown
How to laugh---but more to cry
How to share---but more to hide
How to treasure---but more to abhor
How to communicate---but more to sulk
Honesty
Trust
Commitment
Togetherness

Why do I let such painful memories haunt my existance and force me to hide
deep within my tough shell?
Well-protected and well-isolated
I shall never give in

Not without a fight

Seems all it was
---fights
Can you remember any particular week that passed in which hurting words
were not a part?

Me neither

Seems a shame two friends and lovers ended this way

At least the way I am

You
You have learned to love again
Or are you hiding yourself behind a false sense of security?

Me
I have not allowed myself that freedom which you possess,
which would ignite my heart and soul, once more to give the happiness once
rendered me

Seems like every time I get the chance, a false set of circumstances
arises which shadows the reality of it all

I cannot let go
I cannot let go
My tenacious claws grab for true love
But cling and lock to the wasted time I have allowed myself for falling in
love again
I cannot let go of the emptiness of my heart
Without you
By my side
holding me
comforting me
I cannot let go of the memories which haunt me
yes, haunt me
Scare me to death
Will I ever be able to cast that demon aside who is so delicately perched
upon my heart and in my soul?
That love bird gone awry
I cannot let go of the fact that you are the only man I have ever loved
and the fact that I have not stopped loving you
I cannot let go
I cannot let go

Cast your fears aside and come inside
Let me shelter you
Protect you
I will not harm you as I have been harmed 
Cast your fears into that pit of despair and open your heart
to the true you
Answer its questions
Hear it call for TRUE love
Hear it call my name
Come to me
Come to me

Come
 in
 me

Let me feel your strength and warmth
inside
of 
me

Kiss after kiss
Lick after lick
Stroke after stroke
Thrust after thrust
Moan after moan

As we lay there naked
bodies intertwined
Let me
feel
the love you have for me
again
again
again

Comfort me
Love me
Hold me
Never let me go

Teach me 
Teach me love again

Teach me well.




"As you dig into drawers while someone is away, being overly suspicious
 and untrusting, trying to find some evidence of unfaithfulness, stop and 
 reflect for a minute.  Are you wrongfully accusing and/or snooping for no
 real reason?  Then perhaps you are projecting your own character of 
 infidelity onto this person, and the actual person you might need to trust
 in first...is yourself."  Ä Twilight

Memories slicing my mind open
revealing the cancerous thoughts 
that permeate my unconsious.
These thoughts twist and mutilate
my logic, clouding my vision
and attacking my need for life.

Darkness is where I cower,
I hide from poisonous emotions,
emotions that will tear me from reality
and throw me to the demon.
His mouth wide open, revealing
a cancerous tongue that longs 
to lick my blackened heart.

My legs are split open so u
can use and abuse what was never
really mine.
MUTILATE ME!  KNIFE ME!  STRETCH ME!
Don't worry, I won't feel the pain
because pain is something I am now
immune to.

C'MON DEMON LOVER, FUCK ME DEEP INSIDE
WITH YOUR PHALLIC KNIFE!!
Engrave my heart, carve my soul and mind,
leave me here, sickened, twisted and cold.
I'll walk away enveloped in darkness
ready to face my next demon
who I will fuck, twist and mutilate.
Then I will be the one with my mouth wide
and open, waiting to lick someone's blackened heart.




"Courtney has that element of danger.  You never know what she's going to do 
 next.  We're not used to seeing that in a woman.  We're used to seeing that 
 from Jim Morrison, or Iggy Pop, or from Johnny Rotten in the early days of 
 the Sex Pistols.  She's a rock star in the sort of unpredictable, volatile 
 way that people voyeuristically expect."  Ä Syndicated columnist Lisa 
  Robinson, seeing Courtney Love, ironically, as the latest in a long line
  of male rockers

I came out to see you
but you were not there
Someone else was in your place
same eyes, same lips, same hair

At first it struck me funny
This stranger by my side!
But he held such loath and hatred
He stripped away my pride

"Where's the man I love?" I asked
"What have you done with him?"
But he just stared a dead man's stare
and gave a ghastly grin

Then I looked into his eyes
and caught a glimpse of you
Somewhere in this stranger's soul
was the man that I once knew




Vows
ş Mike Randall
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

before you left
you should've taken those flowers
shadows race over the roof
and leaves choke and fall
littering your earth
shake now
and all my rooms are empty
bare walls 
that click with your heels
watching nothing but the dust 
collect where, well you used to know
and you forgot the faucet.
still drips anyway
outside the trees stand naked
shake now
because when that door closed
so did i 
and now i'm left with one less thing 
without sounds and smiles
without scents and feelings
color...and now i'm shaking
and nothing's left
except the ghost of a child 
playing a toy piano
in the corner. 




Wasted Moments
ş Angela Dawn Soutar
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

Sand slips through his fingers
as the waves crash to the shore
and birds soar overhead.
Yet, it all goes unnoticed
He sees only the brilliant images
flashing incessantly in his mind
He yearns for the past,
for the way things used to be.
But he can't go back.
So instead, he sits
in the midst of life,
not realizing 
that every moment passing by
is becoming yet another
wasted moment.

I found you
I know where you're at
I'm so tired of sleeping 
Through these nights, lonely nights
Close my eyes sometimes

Go now, you're free
Walk away from me
Go now, you're free
I was so blind
Slow mind
Go now

Hearts breaking, shattered in two
You kept on pushing through
You heard me crying lately
Bought what you said, yeah yeah
All those lies you told me,
Have gone to your head -

Go now, you're free
Walk away from me
Go now, you're free
I was so blind
Slow mind
Go now

Is this how it's ending?
That's all there was to say
Backed in a corner, give it a break
Not made of mercy
You get what you give
Misunderstanding how much I'd take

Go now, you're free,
Walk away from me
Go now, you're free,
I was so blind
Slow mind
Go now
