A Pale Rain
ş Firefly
ùúùúùúùúùúù

The rain is waiting.
She sits inside her silent prison,
Crying blood red tears on a cold pale concrete floor.
The walls are bare but for the etchings,
She has scraped in their unforgiving surface
With her crimson fingernails,
Now chipped and scrapped down to the quick.
Her eyes are torrent and full of grey sky's storm clouds.
The rain is coming.
Her hair and rags that taunt her are limp and tattered
From hours of playing in the ashes,
From savoring their charcoal sweetness.
Her skin is a dark shade of pale,
But has the look of porcelain
compared to the grizzled abyss she lies in.
Beyond the relentless iron bars that guard the window,
Her only link to the outside world,
Awaits a long vermillion fall
to the cold pale concrete of a forgotten world.
The rain is falling.




About Our Hats
ş Ray Heinrich
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

thin black hands
reach 
out of the backs of our heads
holding up
our heaven hats
so
when we face each other
it seems 
there is a sky
complete with stars

After Repeated Attempts
ş Pamela Gray
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

after repeated attempts
to get over you

i've decided to just
give up

accept the fact that
fifty years from now

i'll be sitting in a wheelchair
in the Home for Aged Dykes
muttering your name

some cute volunteer
in a dungaree jacket
will pat me on my wrinkled arm
saying "there, there,
maybe she'll come tomorrow"

my weak heart will flutter
each time a phone rings
or a visitor's announced

oh and i'll get visitors:
all the women I wouldn't
sleep with over the years
because i was waiting
for you

they'll show me pictures
of their collective land
in the country
their alternatively
reproduced grandchildren

occasionally they may ask,
"have you heard from..."
and i'll lower my gray head
"well," they'll say,
"she must be very busy"

at night, rereading
my tattered antique copies
of 'Twenty-One Love Poems'
and 'Beginning with O',
looking through the yellowed
photographs of our vacation
in P-Twon, fifty years back,

i'll ask myself
what it was about you

and i won't remember

Artificial Gods
ş Raven Caine
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Black roses, red wine
A sense of completion
Bodies entwined

He haunts my soul
Like a pagan god
sacrificial altar, cold stone

Blood splattered walls
Forces behind masks of clay
An insane smile in the dark

Long narrow hallways
Moon washed, featureless secrets
A long forgotten grave

He hides within mirrors
Gathering strands of thought
Creating confusion and lies

Blood red lips, black flashing eyes
Paper mache memories
The moment slips and dies

Blackbird
ş The Beatles
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly.
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment
to arise.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see.
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to
be free.

Blackbird fly, Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.
Blackbird fly, Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly.
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to 
arise.

Blood Roses
ş Autumn Silver
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

The crystal seeker, at the dawn,
sheds his crimson tears,
and echoed in a silver mind
are his deepest fears.

Tomorrow's light will shed its rays
on agony and pain;
silver dancer calls the clouds
and sings into the rain.

Crimson petals at the feet
of a silver dancer fair;
with sweetest smile she tangles crystal
moonbeams in her dark hair.

Silver cat with deadly grace
searching for a home,
shadows crystal and chases shadows,
yet remains all alone.

Quiet child of time and sun
draws her siblings' eyes,
but crimson silver rages in the night,
and the wholeness dies.

In quiet fields the last one roams,
and sunlight fills his eyes;
he looks to the distant stone
as the crystal seeker cries.

And from the tears, a kiss of life,
spreads patterns on the stone;
sweet blossoms, roses, silver thorned,
the Queen of Sorrow's throne.




Charcoal
ş Stephen Lush
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

Lost tears in the dishpans set
 under our beds
eyes like magnets sear exposedly
alone in the dark
with dreams and shallowing left alone
rapier shining knife bent bright
 in the echoed shriek of Luna
gas comes, it lets itself in
breathe no more in the profile
 of shadows
little boy wishes and plastic
 burns in the wall
car security lights bleed agedly
whimpers from the rusted sewer
 beasts
brittle soddy truth
loveless stockings pulled to midthigh
black taffy lipstick painted
liver stains speckled of overexposure
broken corners, welcome fatigue
slide into
the effortless weight of the end.

Clouds
ş Joni Mitchell
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel it
As every fairy tale comes real I
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So so many things I could've done
But clouds got in my angel dust

Gets in your eyes your hair
On acid stars your getting there
My body's assembled into
A little itty bitty gift to you
When you die i've looked at life that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
So so don't let them inside, don't let them know
Don't give yourself ohh away

But now my friends are acting strange
They shake their heads man they say I've changed well
Well something's lost rearranged
From living every every every I've

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's just illusions I recall
I really don't know i really don't know
I really don't know i really don't know
I really don't i really don't clouds at all
Why are we here...terrified terrified wow

Death
ş Mark Wood
ùúùúùúùúùúù

Awake, please self, awake!
Death, he works on me.
No, don't drain the fluid from my body!
Awake, I must awake.
Mad dream.
Confined in a casket.
I'm so cold, they file past.
Seems so real, they touch me.
I'm alive I tell you, torment me not.
Nothing works, Get away!
Now I fade... Pain... Scream in the night.
Death laughs, rush into the void,
I shall laugh with him throughout eternity.
Time passes... slowly... time passes,
The worms!  the worms!  the worms!
In us all the time.
Filling my mouth, consuming flesh!
Climbing out the head of my penis.
Bloated belly, swollen with gas.
I rot, split apart at the edges.
Blue meat without form.
Nothing left but bones and a timeless scream.




Fight
ş The Cure
ùúùúùúùúùú

Sometimes there's nothing to feel
Sometimes there's nothing to hold
Sometimes there's no time to run away
Sometimes you just feel so old
The times it hurts when you cry
The times it hurts just to breathe
And then it all seems like there's no one left
And all you want is to sleep

Fight fight fight
Just push it away
Fight fight fight
Just push until it breaks
Fight fight fight
Don't cry at the pain
Fight fight fight
Or watch yourself burn again
Fight fight fight
Don't howl like a dog
Fight fight
Just fill up the sky
Fight fight fight
Fight 'til you drop
Fight fight fight
And never never
Never stop

Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight

So when the hurting starts
And when the nightmares begin
Remember you can fill up the sky
You don't have to give in
You don't have to give in

Never give in
Never give in
Never give in

Four Essential Questions
ş Christopher Stolle
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

I.  How can I believe in religion if I know not what God is?

Just a moment ago, I thought I was visited by God
but he betrayed me, so to Hell with prophets.

Oh Satan, I have sinned with pride and joy
as I took a bite from the fruit of the apple tree
and disgraced the obscenity of gratitude.

II.  How can I believe in technology when I know not what politics are?

Light bulbs are twisted from their fixtures
for broken glass resembles a crystal prism
that light can no longer shine through.

Cable cords and telephone wires
stretch all the dismal distances
that are apart at the seams.

III.  How can I believe in this if I know not what that is?

Nature is nature and soil is soil
while grass is grass and a rose is a thorn.

Everything is everything and nothing is nothing
while the sun only shines at the stroke of midnight.

IV.  How can I believe in myself when I know not who I am?

Conceited beliefs and self-sufficing means
make me more stable among the fallen
as those on a pedestal know not at all
where their angry thoughts border.

When all I can see is my reflection,
in the shadow of a street light,
I feel something that's a novelty
and maybe it's just my hand on my face.

Grand Theft
ş Twilight
ùúùúùúùúùúù

Like a perfect oyster
I lift the roughened shell
Coated with years of barnacles.
Prying open
Showing the fleshy pink.
And I giggle as you tickle me.
You embrace my pearl
Like a toy
Gleefully playing
But always putting it back into place
Before the latch went down.
But when no knife
Not even a crowbar
Could lift my little house
Somehow, some way
Unbeknownst to me
You tricked your way in.
So secretly, so deceptively
And stole my precious sphere of white
My glowing ball.
Leaving your dark footprint
And the lonely, empty dent.
Taking the key, breaking the hinge
And leaving me wide open.
Beneath the red-hot, sizzling sun
I shriveled into an unidentifiable format.




"I've got a blister from
 Touching everything I see
 The abyss opens up
 It steals everything from me"  Ä Courtney Love




How Hard This Time?
ş Cheshire
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

How hard will you hit me this time, Father?
Hard enough to forget your grief?
to forget your pains?
How long will you lock me away from you
and the rest of the world...
long enough to bring her back to you?
It doesn't matter you know,
it can't take away the fact
that she's gone because of you.
You can't change the fact
that she's left you, and soon I'll be gone too.
And the harder you hit,
the more you scratch,
all the pain you cause is just a warm-up
for the years of neglect
loneliness,
pain,
and regret that will be your only reminders
of a family that loved you.
So hit me harder, Father...
your strength is your own undoing.




In My Life
ş The Beatles
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

There are places I'll remember
all my life, though some have changed,
some forever, not for better,
some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments,
with lovers and friends I still can recall,
some are dead and some are living,
in my life I've loved them all.
But of all these friends and lovers,
there is no one compared with you,
and these mem'ries lose their meaning
when I think of love as something new.
Though I know I'll never lose affection
for people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them,
in my life I'll love you more.
Though I know I'll never lose affection
for people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them
in my life I'll love you more
in my life I'll love you more.




In Plaster
ş Sylvia Plath
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

I shall never get out of this!  There are two of me now:
This absolutely white person and the old yellow one,
And the white person is certainly the superior one.
She doesn't need food, she is one of the real saints.
At the beginning I hated her, she had no personality -
She lay in bed with me like a dead body
And I was scared, because she was shaped just the way I was

Only much whiter and unbreakable and with no complaints.
I couldn't sleep for a week, she was so cold.
I blamed her for everything, but she didn't answer.
I couldn't understand her stupid behaviour!
When I hit her she held still, like a true pacifist.
Then I realized what she wanted was for me to love her:
She began to warm up, and I saw her advantages.

Without me, she wouldn't exist, so of course she was grateful.
I gave her a soul, I bloomed out of her as a rose
Blooms out of a vase of not very valuable porcelain,
And it was I who attracted everybody's attention,
Not her whiteness and beauty, as I had at first supposed.
I patronized her a little, and she lapped it up -
You could tell almost at once she had a slave mentality.

I didn't mind her waiting on me, and she adored it.
In the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun
From her amazingly white torso, and I couldn't help but notice
Her tidiness and her calmness and her patience:
She humoured my weakness like the best of nurses,
Holding my bones in place so they would mend properly.
In time our relationship grew more intense.

She stopped fitting me so closely and seemed offish.
I felt her criticizing me in spite of herself,
As if my habits offended her in some way.
She let in the draughts and became more and more absent-minded.
And my skin itched and flaked away in soft pieces
Simply because she looked after me so badly.
Then I saw what the trouble was:  she thought she was immortal.

She wanted to leave me, she thought she was superior,
And I'd been keeping her in the dark, and she was resentful -
Wasting her days waiting on a half-corpse!
And secretly she began to hope I'd die.
Then she could cover my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
And wear my painted face the way a mummy-case
Wears the face of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.

I wasn't in any position to get rid of her.
She'd supported me for so long I was quite limp -
I had even forgotten how to walk or sit,
So I was careful not to upset her in any way
Or brag ahead of time how I'd avenge myself.
Living with her was like living with my own coffin:
Yet I still depended on her, though I did it regretfully.

I used to think we might make a go of it together -
After all, it was a kind of marriage, being so close.
Now I see it must be one or the other of us.
She may be a saint, and I may be ugly and hairy,
But she'll soon find out that that doesn't matter a bit.
I'm collecting my strength; one day I shall manage without her,
And she'll perish with emptiness then, and begin to miss me.

Just Like A Woman
ş Bob Dylan
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can't be blessed
'Til she sees finally that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that -

I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl.




Landslide
ş Stevie Nicks
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

I took my love, I took it down
Climbed a mountain and I turned around
I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Til the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you get bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too

Oh, take my love, take it down
Climb a mountain and turn around
If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down

If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down




Losing Me
ş Quinn
ùúùúùúùúù

I'm so sick of hiding
my true self locked up
I feel as though I might lose the key,
and then where would I be?
my actions are false,
though my feelings are true
Oh, what I would give to show them to you
I wonder what you would do
what you would think
if you got a glance at the real me

Do you ever look beyond my fake laugh?
have I hidden my feelings so well,
that looking into my eyes is like
looking into tinted glass?

I'm so scared I'll lose myself in this game we play
but I sink in more and more
day by day

Is that worse than losing you?
could losing myself be worse
than seeing rejection staring back at me?

If you saw my tears,
my worries and fears,
would you forget my smiles?

by keeping you,
I'm losing me




Missing You
ş Cat-a-lyst
ùúùúùúùúùúùú

The sands of time seem to flow
Like winter molasses.
The hours pass like clouds overhead,
Slowly and all the same.

Turning my eyes inward I see
Spun threads of love tangle
From my heart and soar over the miles
To yours.  I feel you.

If only I could whisper to the moon,
"Tell her I love her..."
If only the moon had ears and voice
To carry my message to her.

Yet I feel her heart as mine own
And I know that she too burns.
The hottest fire, doused only
By the purest water.

We are burning water.




Nobody's Hero
ş Neil Peart
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

I knew he was different in his sexuality
I went to his parties as the straight minority
It never seemed a threat to my masculinity
He only introduced me to a wider reality

As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that he was gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart
But he's nobody's -

Hero - saves a drowning child
Cures a wasting a disease
Hero - lands the crippled airplane
Solves great mysteries

Hero - not the handsome actor
Who plays a hero's role
Hero - not the glamour girl
Who'd love to sell her soul
If anybody's buying
Nobody's hero

I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family
All their lives were shattered in a nightmare of brutality
They try to carry on, try to bear the agony
Try to hold some faith in the goodness of humanity

As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that she was gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart
But she's nobody's -

Hero - is the voice of reason
Against the howling mob
Hero - is the pride of purpose
In the unrewarding job

Hero - not the champion player
Who plays the perfect game
Not the glamour boy
Who loves to sell his name
Everybody's buying
Nobody's hero

As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that you were gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart

Nobody's hero...


               

One Day It Happens
ş Silvia Curbelo
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

One day it happens:  your lover
lights your last cigarette and becomes
a feather of smoke rising through your fingers,
a handful of nothing, a shaft of air.

It is the story of a man
running after a train
or whistling down some alley
while you stare at the long hallway
of his leaving, wondering
*how will I live without?*

One day the night rides in through the window
and unpacks its usual stars.
You lie on the thin bed
and feel the room
opening up like breath
when the last door slams behind you
final as a shot.

One day you lie alone
remembering the short barrel of his heart,
its single bullet.




"Endings are horrible, almost impossible.  We are deeply instilled with the
 belief that love will last forever, even though the statistics give us quite
 a different perspective.  I have had ten major breakups so far in my life and
 hope never to have another, but I'm far from confident.  I am perplexed by
 the rapidity and ease with which passion, desire and shared dreams simply
 fade away or deteriorate into boredom and animosity.  Last year I broke up
 with someone and believed I would never fall in love again.  This year I've
 fallen in love with someone and believe we will never break up.
 
 My last breakup was devastating, a phantom pain of the heart.  I thought I'd
 never love or be loved again.  I started smoking, took two-hour baths so I
 could cry without interruption, and listened to Nanci Griffith continuously.
 Days passed in which I was unable to eat, sleep, or leave my home.  I thought
 I needed a jumpstart, some incredible jolt to my nervous system in order to
 feel alive again.  What I needed was simply to grieve.  For months.  Many
 prior losses surfaced which I also grieved.  My hypnotherapist, the support
 and love of my friends, my writing, my dreams and the passing of time pulled
 me through.  Love comes with no guarantee.  The alternative is to display
 my scars and close my heart.  A price I'm not willing to pay."

Our Lady Examines Her Anger
ş Nita Penfold
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

like a foreign object
turning it over, looking for cracks
flaws in the obsidian surface.
She is angry at him
for going on with his life
as if she were not maimed
as if she had not lost an arm to him,
a foot, hobbling around now
trying to grow them back.
Each memory of their life together
an obstacle to trip over:
the little boy who wanted approval
from his father, the little girl who needed
her mother's love, two artists attempting
support through the hardness,
holding each other's tears in the night.
She loved the soul of this man who
reflected back her own undetected strengths,
who could transform himself into roles
with rich masks, who played like
a gleeful boy, who showed her
that happiness was indeed possible
but must be made, joy
could be found if you are open
to the moment.  So she opened,
and he closed to her.
But most of all, as she catches
her distorted face in the shiny whorls,
she is angry because
loving him was
the closest she had ever come
to loving herself.

Quitters Never Win
ş Cheshire
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

     ...and it doesn't matter anyway, not down there on the mean, crowded
streets and not up here on top of this sleazy second-rate apartment building
I used to call home.  It never matters how hard you swing, 'cause they can
always hit you harder the next time.  It doesn't matter how much you care,
because nobody else does.  And it doeesn't matter how much you cry - trust me
on that one.
     Yeah, I was young and naive like the rest, and I believed them -
"Work hard and you'll come out on top.  Try harder and you'll get it."  Nobody
thought to tell me that no matter *how* hard you try, they can still take it
all away from you.  I had just graduated after heavy struggling when my
father's company called, telling us how unfortunate it was that my father's
own negligence led to his "accident".  He was buried day after I walked across
the stage.  Mom was nothing short of useless after that.  She stayed home
a lot, cried a lot, and drank more than that.  She took *herself* away in a
blaze of glory called a car crash.
     I was creeping through college at the time and didn't have any legal 
eagles guiding me <like I could pay for one, pshaw!> so Ole Uncle Sam couldn't
help me past life insurance, and that hardly covered tuition, so I had to drop
out.  Everything I worked for tossed away, because some factory worker forgot
to put out the "floor wet" sign after he mopped.
     I stuck it out for a while, got my own place and a job waiting tables.
I guess I thought maybe I could put it all back together.  Maybe it'll
somehow turn out okay.  Then some junkies broke in and stole everything I
owned.  Everything I EVER owned.
     So here I am.  I'm tired of the lies.  Tired, ya know?  They build up
your hopes and dash them into a million billion pieces on the street.  But 
I'm following *my* dreams...
     The crowds are forming now.  I guess my crazy old landlady figured
out all by herself that I'm not up on the roof to sunbathe <heh>.  Now the
news crews - and the firemen who will try to tell me that it'll all be okay
if I come down.  More lies, more deception.  Channel 6, channel 11...and some
radio crews too.  Good, they can all know the truth.
     Now here's the firewoman with her pretty shiny ladder to talk me
down with sweet soothing speech, and I dont hear a word.  Fevered newscasters
give their dramatic reports of a desperate suicidal young woman with
her whole life ahead of her.  Mothers hold their sons close, Fathers shield
their sons' eyes, and now I fall over the edge. 
     ...and I never was a winner anyway.

Life is funny
Just when you think you have everything figured out
It throws you a curve ball
And turns your orderly little world upside down

Anger intense and white hot
Fear consuming and cold as winter's breath
Flash through your mind
In rapid succession

What right does life have...
Changing without your permission
How will you survive
What roads do you travel from here

These feelings are expressed with your mind
But felt, for the first time
With your heart
And your realize
That you are alive
For you have begun to feel

Deeply
Albeit painfully
And in this one way
It is good
For you are growing
In ways that you never knew you could
And never wanted to try

And it is for these reasons
You see some light
Feel a little hope
That you will survive this
that you will be stronger for it

You find that suffering leads to growth
And growing to truth
And truth to living
Not just existing

You find that you are no longer a silhouette
An outline of the best parts of yourself
You are whole and reborn
And damned if it doesn't feel a little good

When she held another.

It would yell and jump up and down
And beat at the walls of its cage
In rage, leaving bruises.
It would try to climb out of my throat
Just to set things to its fancy.

So I killed it.  I removed it
With a sword forged of wisdom,
Hewn razor keen by tears of the past.
Impaled on the naked blade,
I severed the muscle from my being.

And what is to come of this?
Will it be seen by a stone statue
Or a human with tears of her own?
Tomorrow will see what today parades
Behind a veil of darkness, the night.

Has died for my sins.

The Wishing Box
ş Sylvia Plath
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

   Agnes Higgins realized only too well the cause of her husband Harold's 
beatific, absent-minded expression over his morning orange juice and 
scrambled eggs.
   "Well," Agnes sniffed, smearing beach-plum jelly on her toast with 
vindictive strokes of the butter-knife, "what did you dream *last* night?"
   "I was just remembering," Harold said, still staring with a blissful, 
blurred look right through the very attractive and tangible form of his 
wife (pink-cheeked and fluffily blond as always that early September 
morning, in her rose-sprigged peignoir), "those manuscripts I was 
discussing with William Blake."
   "But," Anges objected, trying with difficulty to conceal her irritation, 
"how did you *know* it was William Blake?"
   Harold seemed surprised.  "Why, from his pictures, of course."
   And what could Agnes say to that?  She smoldered in silence over her 
coffee, wrestling with the strange jealousy which had been growing on her 
like some dark, malignant cancer ever since their wedding night only three 
months before when she had discovered about Harold's dreams.  On that first 
night of their honeymoon, in the small hours of the morning, Harold
startled Agnes out of a sound, dreamless sleep by a violent, convulsive 
twitch of his whole right arm.  Momentarily frightened, Agnes had shaken 
Harold awake to ask in tender, maternal tones what the matter was; she 
thought he might be struggling in the throes of a nightmare.  No Harold.
   "I was just beginning to play the 'Emperor Concerto'," he explained 
sleepily.  "I must have been lifting my arm for the first chord when you 
woke me up."
   Now at the outset of their marriage, Harold's vivid dreams amused Agnes.  
Every morning she asked Harold what he had dreamed during the night, and he 
told her in as rich detail as if he were describing some significant, 
actual event.
   "I was being introduced to a gathering of American poets in the Library of 
Congress," he would report with relish.  "William Carlos Williams was there 
in a great, rough coat, and that one who writes about Nantucket, and 
Robinson Jeffers looking like an American Indian, the way he does in the 
anthology photograph; and then Robert Frost came driving up in a saloon car 
and said something witty that made me laugh."  Or, "I saw a beautiful 
desert, all reds and purples, with each grain of sand like a ruby or 
sapphire shooting light.  A white leopard with gold spots was standing over 
this bright blue stream, its hind legs on one bank, its forelegs on the 
other, and a little trail of red ants was crossing the stream over the 
leopard, up its tail, along its back, between its eyes, and down on the 
other side."
   Harold's dreams were nothing if not meticulous works of art.  Undeniably, 
for a certified accountant with pronounced literary leanings (he reads E. 
T. A. Hoffman, Kafka, and the astrological monthlies isntead of the daily 
paper on the commuters' special), Harold possessed an astonishly quick, 
colorful imagination.  But, gradually, Harold's peculiar habit of accepting 
his dreams as if they were really an integral part of his waking experience 
began to infuriate Agnes.  She felt left out.  It was as if Harold were 
spending one third of his life among celebrities and fabulous legendary 
creatures in an exhilarating world from which Agnes found herself 
perpetually exiled, except by hearsay.
   As the weeks passed, Agnes began to brood.  Although she refused to 
mention it to Harold, her own dreams, when she had them (and that, alas, was 
infrequently enough), appalled her:  dark, glowering landscapes peopled 
with ominous unrecognizable figures.  She never could remember these 
nightmares in detail, but lost their shapes even as she struggled to 
awaken, retaining only the keen sense of their stifling, storm-charged 
atmosphere which, oppressive, would haunt her throughout the following 
day.  Agnes felt ashamed to mention these fragmentary scenes of horror to 
Harold for fear they reflected too unflatteringly upon her own powers of 
imagination.  Her dreams - few and far between as they were - sounded so 
prosaic, so tedious, in comparison with the royal baroque splendour of 
Harold's.  How could she tell him simply, for example:  "I was falling":  
or, "Mother died and I was so sad":  or, "Something was chasing me and I 
couldn't run"?  The plain truth was, Agnes realized, with a pang of envy, 
that her dream-life would cause the most assiduous psychoanalyst to 
repress a yawn.
   Where, Agnes mused wistfully, were those fertile childhood days when she 
believed in fairies?  Then, at least, her sleep had never been dreamless 
nor her dreams dull and ugly.  She had in her seventh year, she recalled 
wistfully, dreamed of a wishing box land about the clouds where wishing 
boxes grew on trees, looking very much like coffee-grinders; you picked a 
box, turned the handle around nine times while whispering your wish in 
this little hold in the side, and the wish came true.  Another time, she 
had dreamed of finding three magic grass-blades growing by the mailbox at 
the end of her street:  the grass-blades shone like tinsel Christmas 
ribbon, one red, one blue, and one silver.  In yet another dream, she and 
her young brother Michael stood in front of Dody Nelson's white-shingled 
house in snowsuits, knotty maple tree roots snaked across the hard, brown 
ground; she was wearing red-and-white striped wool mittens; and, all at 
once, as she held out one cupped hand, it began to snow turquoise-blue 
sulfa gum.  But that was just about the extent of the dreams Anges 
remembered from her infinitely more creative childhood days.  At what age 
had those benevolent painted dream worlds ousted her?  And for what cause?

Meanwhile, indefatigably, Harold continued to recount his dreams over 
breakfast.  Once, at a depressing and badly-aspected time of Harold's life 
before he met Agnes, Harold dreamed that a red fox ran through his kitchen, 
grievously burnt, its fur charred black, bleeding from several wounds.  
Later, Harold confided, at a more auspicious time shortly after his 
marriage to Agnes, the red fox had appeared again, miraculously healed, 
with flourishing fur, to present Harold with a bottle of permanent black 
Quink.  Harold was particularly fond of his fox dreams; they recurred 
often.  So, notably, did his dream of the giant pike.  "There was this 
pond," Harold informed Agnes one sultry August morning, "where my cousin 
Albert and I used to fish; it was chock full of pike.  Well, last night I 
was fishing there, and I caught the most enormous pike you could imagine - 
it must have been the great-great-grandfather of all the rest; I pulled and 
pulled and pulled, and still he kept coming out of that pond."
   "Once," Agnes countered, morosely stirring sugar into her black coffee, 
"when I was little, I had a dream about Superman, all in technicolor.  He 
was dressed in blue, with a red cape and black hair, handsome as a prince, 
and I went flying right along with him through the air - I could feel the 
wind whistling, and the tears blowing out of my eyes.  We flew over 
Alabama; I could tell it was Alabama because the land looked like a map, 
with 'Alabama' lettered in script across these big green mountains."
   Harold was visibly impressed.  "What," he asked Agnes then, "did you 
dream last night?"  Harold's tone was almost contrite:  to tell the truth, 
his own dream-life preoccupied him so much that he'd honestly neer thought 
of playing listener and investigating his wife's.  He looked at her pretty, 
troubled countenance with new interest:  Agnes was, Harold paused to 
observe for perhaps the first time since their early married days, an 
extraordinarily attractive sight across the breakfast table.
   For a moment, Agnes was confounded by Harold's well-meant question; she 
had long ago passed the stage where she seriously considered hiding a coy 
of Freud's writings on dreams in her closet and fortifying herself with a 
vicarious dream tale by which to hold Harold's interest each morning.  Now, 
throwing reticence to the wind, she decided in desperation to confess her 
problem.
   "I don't dream anything," Agnes admitted in low, tragic tones.  "Not 
anymore."
   Harold was obviously concerned.  "Perhaps," he consoled her, "you just 
don't use your powers of imagination enough.  You should practice.  Try 
shutting your eyes."
   Agnes shut her eyes.
   "Now," Harold asked hopefully, "what do you see?"
   Agnes panicked.  She saw nothing.  "Nothing," she quavered.  "Nothing 
except a sort of blur."
   "Well," said Harold briskly, adopting the manner of a doctor dealing 
with a malady that was, although distressing, not necessarily fatal, 
"imagine a goblet."
   "What *kind* of goblet?" Agnes pleaded.
   "That's up to you," Harold said.  "*You* describe it to *me*."
   Eyes still shut, Agnes dragged wildly into the depths of her head.  She 
managed with great effort to conjure up a vague, shimmery silver goblet 
that hovered somewhere in the nebulous regions of the back of her mind, 
flickering as if at any moment it might black out like a candle.
   "It's silver," she said, almost defiantly.  "And it's got two handles."
   "Fine.  Now imagine a scene engraved on it."
   Agnes forced a reindeer on the goblet, scrolled about by grape leaves, 
scratched in bare outlines on the silver.  "It's a reindeer in a wreath of 
grape leaves."
   "What color is the scene?"  Harold was, Anges thought, merciless.
   "Green," Agnes lied, as she hastily enameled the grape leaves.  "The 
grape leaves are green.  And the sky is black" - she was almost proud of 
this original stroke.  "And the reindeer's russet flecked with white."
   "All right.  Now polish the goblet all over into a high gloss."
   Agnes polished the imaginary goblet, feeling like a fraud.  "But it's in 
the *back* of my head," she said dubiously, opening her eyes.  "I see 
everything way in the back of my head.  Is that were you see *your* dreams?"
   "Why no," Harold said, puzzled.  "I see my dreams on the front of my 
eyelids, like on a movie-screen.  They just come; I don't have anything to 
do with them.  Like right now," he closed his eyes, "I can see these shiny 
crowns coming and going, hung in this big willow tree."
   Agnes fell grimly silent.
   "You'll be all right," Harold tried, jocosely, to buck her up.  "Every 
day, just practice imagining different things like I've taught you."
   Anges let the subject drop.  While Harold was away at work, she began, 
suddenly, to read a great deal; reading kept her mind full of pictures.  
Seized by a kind of ravenous hysteria, she raced through novels, women's 
magazines, newspapers, and even the anecdotes in her 'Joy of Cooking'; she 
read travel brochures, home appliance circulars, the 'Sears Roebuck 
Catalogue', the instructions on soap-flake boxes, the blurbs on the back of 
record-jackets - anything to keep from facing the gaping void in her own 
head of which Harold had made her so painfully conscious.  But as soon as 
she lifted her eyes from the printed matter at hand, it was as if a 
protecting world had been extinguished.
   The utterly self-sufficient, unchanging reality of the *things* 
surrounding her began to depress Agnes.  With a jealous awe, her 
frightened, almost paralyzed stare took in the Oriental rug, the 
Williamsburg-blue wallpaper, the gilded dragons on the Chinese vase on the 
mantel, the blue-and-gold medallion design of the upholstered sofa on which 
she was sitting.  She felt choked, smothered by these objects whose bulky 
pragmatic existence somehow threatened the deepest, most secret roots of 
her own ephemeral being.  Harold, she knew only too well, would tolerate no 
such vainglorious nonsense from tables and chairs; if he didn't like the 
scene at hand, if it bored him, he would change it to suit his fancy.  If, 
Agnes mourned, in some sweet hallucination an octopus came slithering 
towards her across the floor, paisley-patterned in purple and orange, she 
would bless it.  Anything to prove that her shaping imaginative powers were 
not irretrievably lost; that her eye was not merely an open camera lens 
which recorded surrounding phenomena and left it at that.  "A rose," she 
found herself repeating hollowly, like a funeral dirge, "is a rose is a 
rose..."
   One morning when Agnes was reading a novel, she suddenly realized to her 
terror that her eyes had scanned five pages without taking in the meaning 
of a single word.  She tried again, but the letters separated, writhing 
like malevolent little black snakes across the page in a kind of hissing, 
untranslatable jargon.  It was then that Agnes began attending the movies 
around the corner regularly each afternoon.  It did not matter if she had 
seen the feature several times previously; the fluid kaleidoscope of forms 
before her eyes lulled her into a rhythmic trance; the voices, speaking 
some soothing, unintelligible code, exorcised the dead silence in her 
head.  Eventually, by dint of much cajolery, Agnes persuaded Harold to buy 
a television set on the installment plan.  That was much better than the 
movies; she could drink sherry while watching TV during the long 
afternoons.  These latter days, when Agnes greeted Harold on his return 
home each evening, she found, with a certain malicious satisfaction, that 
his face blurred before her gaze, so she could change his features at 
will.  Sometimes she gave him a pea-green complexion, sometimes lavender; 
sometimes a Grecian nose, sometimes an eagle beak.
   "But I *like* sherry," Agnes told Harold stubbornly when, her afternoons 
of private drinking becoming apparent even to his indulgent eyes, he begged 
her to cut down.  "It relaxes me."
   The sherry, however, didn't relax Agnes enough to put her to sleep.  
Cruelly sober, the visionary sherry-haze worn off, she would lie stiff, 
twisting her fingers like nervous talons in the sheets, long after Harold 
was breathing peacefully, evenly, in the midst of some rare, wonderful 
adventure.  With an icy, increasing panic, Agnes lay stark awake night 
after night.  Worse, she didn't get tired any more.  Finally, a bleak, 
clear awareness of what was happening broke upon her:  the curtains of 
sleep, of refreshing, forgetful darkness dividing each day from the day 
before it, and the day after it, were lifted for Agnes eternally, 
irrevocably.  She saw an intolerable prospect of wakeful, visionless days 
and nights stretching unbroken ahead of her, her mind condemned to perfect 
vacancy, without a single image of its own to ward off the crushing assault 
of smug, autonomous tables and chairs.  She might, Agnes reflected sickly, 
live to be a hundred:  the women in her family were all long-lived.
   Dr. Marcus, the Higgins' family physician, attempted, in his jovial way, 
to reassure Agnes about her complaints of insomnia:  "Just a bit of nervous 
strain, that's all.  Take one of these capsules at night for a while and 
see how you sleep."
   Agnes did not ask Dr. Marcus if the pills would give her dreams; she put 
the box of fifty pills in her handbag and took the bus home.
   Two days later, on the last Friday of September, when Harold returned 
from work (he had shut his eyes all during the hour's train trip home, 
counterfeiting sleep but in reality voyaging on a cerise-sailed dhow up a 
luminous river where white elephants bulked and rambled across the crystal 
surface of the water in the shadow of Moorish turrets fabricated completely 
of multi-colored glass), he found Agnes lying on the sofa in the living 
room, dressed in her favourite princess-style emerald taffeta evening gown, 
pale and lovely as a blown lily, eyes shut, an empty pillbox and an 
overturned water tumbler on the rug at her side.  Her tranquil features 
were set in a slight, secret smile of triumph, as if, in some far country 
unattainable to mortal men, she were, at last, waltzing with the dark,
red-caped prince of her early dreams.

she rains down upon my hands
and whispers
washes it away
been that way so long
forever
i know that it won't stay

standing by the road
flowers for her hair
i give them away
says she doesn't care

standing in an empty field
no sense of time
falling
no sense of what is real

i can't believe...
i can't believe
she's gone now
she turned away to go
i should've tried...
i should've known
she'd leave me here
alone

subtle pounding beneath flesh something can't get out
overwhelmed with necessity lost the chance to try
saw her standing on the stairs tried to move my mouth
night was almost over didn't want to see the light

the restless feeling will not leave have to leave it soon
the bugs have finally overrun time to leave at dawn
find a place where no one lives and go to it with you
swing an axe around my head 'til all the trees are gone

take the bottle down again and take another drink
wishing i could see you here but knowing you're with him
getting so damn drunk tonight i just don't want to think
break the thoughtless bottle just to cut away my skin

   thinking about everything
   leaving without anything
   living without anyone
   dreaming about you

Hollow inside
forgotten pain
cold black blood
denied lies
why can't you just die
why can't you go away
fade...
fade away...
fade away to nothing.
Why must you torture me
sing your song some other day
you're nothing to me
but a reminder of what i used to be
you only bring back the hate
the pain you made me feel
so long ago...
yet so real
can't you just let it go
let me drown in my own sorrow
let me live another day
let me cry another day
i did not want this
don't turn back
just go...fade away...
into the black nothingness
bury me deeply...
so that I might not see
what you do to yourself
and what you've done to me

Flickering slowly in front of me
Taunting me with every twitch
The sunshine yellow and sparkling orange

Temptation overcame my strongest inhibitions

Reaching out slowly at first
Trying to capture just a bit of you
The warmth felt so good against my skin

Jumping out to sear my flesh
I caught my first glimpse of pain
My first look at the real you

Still I played the foolish game
Attempting to grab hold of something better
Soon my hands were charred and bleeding

The flame had long since been out
Yet still I picked at each wound
And still I remembered my time with you

i search my soul, every crevice, every crack.
i peer into the depths of my heart looking -
for one last trace of who i used to be with you.

i try to remember what we meant, what mattered.
it's so lonely.
and i'm so cold.

my heart burns with a frozen fire of hate and misery.
you touched me once and i melted beneath your fingers.
my skin crawled with excitement and my body numbed itself.

now you touch me and i jump.
i back away from any warmth.
my flesh shudders at the thought of you being near me.
your voice sends chills down my spine.

fuck you for caring.
fuck you for thinking i cared.
go away and take your love with you.
i don't want it.
i don't need it.
everyone goes away sooner or later.
you will too.
go now while i have my heart braced.

never look back for you'll never see me again.
not the me you knew.
my expression now one of hate and dismay.
the joy drained from my eyes as time slips by.

my life is a joke.
and our memories are as jaded as death.

i hate you being near me.
your voice sends chills down my spine.

fuck you for caring.
fuck you for thinking i cared.

No good-bye's, no C-ya's, no hugs; just
the perpetual silence of the dial tone.
 When something disappears walk
towards the familiar.
At first eyes brush against nothingness
in this isolated place.
Though the disfigured circle hides
in the background.
Waiting, watching for the simple cue
that brings things to life.
 Smile here, laugh at that part, move
over there.
Mechanics of the actor are a little out of
touch and somewhat insane.
Finding, playing a part much easier
than watching the rain.
 The face lingers in the halls, voice
echoes in the crowd
   Rewinding, Fastforwarding
      Replaying History
Life outside the box set stage falls
upon the actors lap.
 Trapped in a poetic prison, the room
pours with desperation and hope.
Always raining, weather knives thrust
forward stabbing at blades of grass or
falling softly to the rhythm of love.
Catching the rain in a glass, a hand
curves script around a page, wondering
if it ever rains in New Mexico.

Making a leap into nowhere
Throwing my emotions down into the unknown
Hoping my soul will land safely
Instead it crashes roughly on a floor made of stone

In time I know
Trust will come naturally
For right now, though
Our love is misery

The bittersweet taste of your kiss
Both passion and pain all in one tender touch
The tenderness of my caress
Letting you know that I need you so much

The pleasure I feel
This pain is so real
Our destinies apart
I won't let your love tear up my heart

When it all comes back from afar
Will I still be standing here or will I disappear
Will you still remember my name
Will you have brought to life all my darkest fears

Turn back around (don't leave me alone)
The tears on my fact show the weakness inside
Tell me you love me, tell me you need me
Before you tell me goodbye

Standing alone in the darkness
No one else around me to help heal my deep wounds
Memories shredded like canvas
It all loses meaning when I can't love you

Don't turn around (you left me alone)
The tears in the dust show my strength deep inside
I told you I loved you, I told you I needed you
But now I'm telling you goodbye




Where Is The Light?

something has got me down
and I don't now what it is
creeping up on me like a storm
as it wreaks my total existence
and my fears run deeper and deeper
I stood on solid ground that was loose
all my functions began to dissolve
so I ran, I ran, to where do I run
then I hit the end of a road
and I smashed into a wall
can't wait for the savior
time are short and sour
I couldn't climb a ladder
so I climbed a mountain
and I fell on a bed of roses
I sleep with ease and peace
my ego never was visible
so I cry, I cry, to whom do I cry
and when I awake I'm alone
in this overpopulated world
so where is she, where is she
that woman in my dreams
and where, where is the light

Years Of Water

i dream
of water                     
and the seals
barking                           
on the rocks 
and i dream
of a deep lake
of navigating 
the shores
of the lap and pound
of years of water
of willow strands 
growing in a hidden path
of dark waves eating 
through wet years 
of escaping                        
and searching
for you
of the touch 
of the water
of the fossil cliffs
rising over us

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know 
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know 
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
