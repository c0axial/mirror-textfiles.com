A New Day's Frost 
ş Blue Powder
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

There is a lone voice
that fills the air
and echoes in despair
And to the moon
it cries at night
on its endless flight
Seeking an answer
Finding a way
On to another day

There is a fading light
that has no eyes
to seek out the lies
It flickers out
and it grows dark
as I wear the mark
Seeking a truth
Finding a way
On to another day

There are no thoughts
and little emotion
just the ocean
of many feelings
and nothing to feel
while we heal
Seeking a peace
Finding a way
On to another day

Challenge Me.
ş Zidjian
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

- Challenge me.
- That's all I want.
- Just challenge me.

> I challenge you.

- Good, now you're dead.

> What do you mean?

- Look at yourself.
- Are you there?
- Are you sure?
- Look again.
- How can you be there
  if you're dead?

> I'm not there.

- Look at your hand.
- What do you see?
- Do you see a hand?
- Or something else?

> I'm not sure.
> I don't want to challenge you.
> I want to run.

- Run?
- Run where?
- You're locked in a room
  with no walls.

> Where's the door?

- There is no door.

> How do I get out?

- You don't.

> Why are you doing this?

- You challenged me.

> Stop the room.
> I want to get off.

- It's too late for that.

> I'm sorry.
> God, I'm sorry.

- You're dead.





- Challenge me.




Control
ş Falling Leaves
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

Tell me what to do.
That's what I need.
If you don't, who will?
I can't do anything on my own
I need to be controlled.
Control me.
Make me your desire.
That's what I need.
Make my every thought be of uselessness.
I am vulnerable
I am in love.
This sickening disease
that helps you to control me.
I am no longer myself.
What do you want from me?
I am not who I used to be.
I am you.
You control me.
Control me.
Let me die my horrible death.
I will be your burden no more
just let me die now
so I can be as you wish when I die
in your control.
Let me be me
because I don't want to be you any more.




Cheating
ş Twilight
ùúùúùúùúùú

Look at you.
God, look at that smile...
You're mixing me up
Fuckin' messin' with my brain
...and my heart.
I'm in love, you fool!
Don't mess with me
My affection belongs elsewhere
and I can't go on lending it -
to you.
Tellin' ya to leave me alone
Go way, I can't look at you
But...I want to.
I need to...
You turn me on.
You send me for rides 
on the emotional roller coaster
Travelin' from place to place
Doomed to repeat past mistakes
What should I do?
Should I give you a chance
Don't want to never know your love
But will it be both ways?
Cuz...I have it already...
I have love -
Right *here*.
Don't want to regret
giving up a good thing...
for nothing.
Is it really that good, though...
Should I move on -
and fall into your arms...
that enticing embrace...
Damn you.
Damn you and the confusion you bring.
Can't choose...one or the other 
But...lust is safe
Lust doesn't hurt
As long as it doesn't turn to love.




Dancing Blood
ş Angel Alice
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Music blasting through my brain,
Pounding on my body, 
I surrender and let it seduce me, 
Like a gypsy's swirling skirt and golden earrings.
Wild hair is lifted by the fingers of the wind.
Barefoot on the grass, I dance.
Fast and hard, like the rhythm of two pulsing bodies.
Mine, and the music.
Passionate virgin lovemaking.
The night sings in rage and fury.
The moon shines lucidly.
The scent of jasmine intoxicates my body,
The scent of passion intoxicates my soul.
The ground tears my feet, the blood flows freely. 
My blood, my dancing blood, spills to the earth, 
Where it is swallowed.
Faster the music beats me,
Around and around.
Faster the steps,
Faster the blood flows,
Faster the wind blows,
Faster the world spins,
Harder.
Faster.
I am flying.

But I'm just a silent wave

As a meaningless thought

You say you want me
But I'm desired as much 
As a soul in bliss
Wants to be freed

I Remember You
ş Twilight
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

Where have you gone...
What has happened to you...
Black and white against a page
From four years ago...
Lying here, staring, thinking,
So suddenly, I remember you...
And I remember seeing you again
And that you must be in here -
In this book of pictures.
Flipping feverishly through the pages,
My finger running down the names;
The printed text...
Looking for the R's - and yes,
You are here.
A little older than how I first remembered you,
But still, it is you.
As I stare into the unknowing eyes
Made of numerous pixels,
My mind races back -
Back to my innocence, my youth.
Caught in a whirlwind...
Me in a ponytail, bobby socks,
You, on your bike -
And oh yes, soon after - the talks we shared,
The "Love you!" before the click...
Before I could reciprocate.
The things we saw, 
So fuzzy in my memory,
But I remember you...
Hell, yeah - you and your army jacket,
The grass, the games, the -
"I want to know *everything* about her!"
Excuse me; I must blush...
Looking fondly back on the memories
Just as I look fondly upon you now...
Missing the carefree happiness,
The excitement of two young spirits
Sharing their youths together
In new-found electricity.
Sigh...then I heard you became a father,
And I recognized you, watched you,
But you were too caught up in your new life...
Only saw past me.
Yet, I was different;
I had changed.
You did not give me the chance to say hello
Before you left once more...
Did you move...?  Drop out...?  Get married...?
What happened to you...
And most of all -
Do you remember me...
Do you know I am here -
Writing about you...
Thinking about you...
Even short-lived, what wonderful times we shared...
Together.
I was merely a pebble in your ocean,
But alas, you will never know
How you were a milestone in mine...
"Let me be the one who loves you -
'Til the end of time..."




"If you think lips are cool, wait 'til you wake up one morning next to your 
love, her naked back facing you, a window behind, silhouetting the curve of 
her body as she sleeps peacefully.  You snuggle up close and put your arm 
around her, holding her tight as if the world were about to end..."  Ä Shadou




I'll Be a Friend to You
ş Angst 
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Not to hurt you
Not to desert you
Not to turn you out the door.
Not to own you
Not to disown you
I just want to love you more.
There's so many ways i need
to learn to love you.
There's so much I want to do
There's so many ways I need
to show you that I
will be a friend to you.
Not to tame you
Not to defame you
Not to even up the score.
Not to make you
Not to forsake you
I just want to love you more.

My love betrayed by a Judas Kiss
what kind of holy cross is this

in a crippled land where evil walks

what foolish faith is this
this misplaced trust in innocents
what twisted joy is this
this self-inflicted penitence

what saving grace is this
to save one life while another dies
what hidden truth is this
dead and buried in myths and lies

ş Twilight
ùúùúùúùúùú

Afraid...
Fearing that Jack is awaiting me,
Ready to pounce
from underneath the red and plastic lid
Scratching his way out -
Let me out!  Let me out!
But the nice painted box tries to play the fool.

I listen to the haunting melody,
Fearing each new note as it tinkers out
into the stillness of the ominous air.
Thick and suffocating.
yet...enchanting...
Holding my breath
As each slight turn of the handle
Does not yet bring the beast to my throat.

But, as the song progresses,
That one note will indeed come -
It is unavoidable.
But still, I hope.
I hope that...perhaps...
This box is broken -
That maybe *this* time, it'll be different.
The real self will not emerge...
Yes, I'm fooling myself,
But yet, I turn the key...
and POP!...

Unsuspecting, but in my darkest recesses,
I really did know.
But still, I run back for more
And so now, Jack strangles me - 
Clawing at my chest, clenching at my heart
Yes, the wounds do heal with time
And the weasel will retreat back into his burrow...
But I, the hoping fool -
Will pick up the box, turn the handle
and listen to the frightening tune...
Again.

When you were there for me and held me close
I thought you loved me
When you laughed heartily at my jokes
I thought you loved me
When you whispered sweet nothings into my ear
I thought you loved me
When you said that of course, you cared
I thought you loved me.

When you opened up and poured out your soul
I thought you loved me
When you picked up the guitar and played me a song
I thought you loved me
When you cried, "Don't you go leaving me"
I thought you loved me
When you said that you could not make it alone
I thought you loved me.

But now I know the truth -
All the lies, promises in vain
All the heartache, and all the games...
The sweet smile of satisfaction on your lips
As you cause me pain.
I thought you loved me
And I was wrong.

[After dialing, he sat patiently, waiting for her to answer the phone].

Hi.  Judy.  It's me.

Yeah.  [laughs]  It HAS been a while!

Oh, I'm doing OK.  I've been real flaky for the past few days.  In fact, 
that's why I called... I think I'm in love!

No, nothing like that!  [laughs]  She's amazing!  I just can't stop
thinking about her.  She's constantly on my mind.  Uh, can I get your
opinion on something, you know, from a woman's point of view?

Well, we met on Wednesday.  Yeah, just a few days ago.  Anyway, I'll never
forget how we met.  I was just driving along and there she was!  I looked
up from the tape deck and I saw her amazing body fly over the hood of
the car.  And then I saw her pretty face hit the windshield.  I knew
instantly that I was in love.

Yeah, you'd think that, but I really think she loves me, too.  I just
wish her jaw weren't wired shut, so that she'd be able to tell me.  As it
is, she can only grunt.  I visited her in the hospital and took her
flowers and told her how much I love her.  She was overcome.  She has this
laptop computer that she uses to communicate.  She tried to type back to
me, but she was so moved that she couldn't type right.  She threw the
computer at the wall in desperation, and it almost hit me!

Well, her family was there, and I think they're jealous of our love.
They had me kicked out of the hospital.  I don't like to think this about
her family, but I think it's some kind of insurance rip-off.  Some kind of
scam they're pulling.  I mean, why else would they keep two lovers apart?

Yeah, well, I still think she's the most amazing thing to happen to my
life.

Oh?  You met a man?

He fell at your feet?

From the thirteenth floor?

Wow.  That's true love.

From across the room, I watch
As you bring your drink to your lips
You don't know me
But, God, I wish you did

I imagine how your skin feels
Soft, smooth, perfect
As you lick the moisture from your mouth
I feel my loins stiffen in response

My hands itch to caress your naked body
My mouth burns to be pressed upon yours
I can taste you on my tongue
I can smell your heat

Imagining your touch
Sends trails of fire across my flesh
I can almost feel your breath on my neck
As you moan your desire

I don't know you, but to have you
Beneath me, subjugated, mine
I would give you anything you desired
My heart, my life, my soul

Our bodies intertwined
Sweat running down my back
As I thrust into you
Grunting in animalistic passion

One night
One dream
One desire
You.

ş J.D.
ùúùúùúùúùúùúù

Past the memory of yesterday and
The uncertainty of tomorrow
I see life for the first time
From the other side of sorrow.
I leave behind the images
Of all forgotten faces
And lose the grief my heart has hidden
In secret, buried places
To give the stranger I call myself
The years I need to grow
And search my soul for answers
I've never come to know
Beneath the veil of illusion
That for years has dimmed my sight
I rise in arrogance to test
My wings in their new flight
And bid them carry me far
From the anguish of my past years
When I could not find myself
At the bottom of my tears
The mask that good intent would mold
I have flung aside and shattered
To strip my soul of trivial things
That never should have mattered
I have robbed cruelty of its power
Stripped memory of its pain, and
Returned from the other side of sorrow
To find myself again.

Under the stars of a midnight sky
I watched you play with that look in your eyes
You were so far away and so easy to touch
And as your fingers strummed the strings
I knew you had the touch

It drew me away to a far away place
It made my heart break.  It made my pulse race
In that moment I felt so alive
And so real again
Inside I cried.

Your music brings me back
From a world of shattered dreams
Where my soul was trapped by memory
Where nothing was as it seems

Your music sets me free
And fills my heart with light
I could have stayed forever
Under that starlit night

Never stop playin'
Don't try to hide your soul
Its beauty showed me how to live
When I thought my life was gone
Like a single precious rose
In spring ends winter's sleep
You've gone too far.  You can't stop now
Your music goes too deep.

Your music sets me free
And fills my heart with light
I would have stayed forever.
I could have stayed forever.
I wanted to stay forever
Under that starlit night.

This heart has been no barren place
It felt, it cried,
It has had blood to pour...
But now...
You ask of hate, of pain?
(And hope to hear of love...)
What heart can do that
When it beats no more?
Thre had been love,
That much I recall.
Perhaps I gave it all?
Perhaps there's more in store?
But though I try-
For you-
My heart can beat no more...

Its hungry lips, burning a sanguine red, were starved for attention and
love.
Its crystal blue eyes, gleaming a steamy haze, prayed to the heavens
above.
		 The flames have engulfed her.
		 The gleam has taken her sight.
		 He was never compassionate enough to admit she was right.
Now is the time to pack up, and now is the time to move on.
But, he has no idea this rare creature is gone.

Its wavy auburn hair, framing a halo around its face, illuminated it to
an angelic degree.
Its smooth olive skin, emitting a wondrous lucidity, shimmered upon the
placid sea.
		 The frame has encaged her.
		 The ocean her grave.
		 He never reached out a hand -
		 her life he could have saved.
He should keep moving forward and understand the fact...
She will never forgive him...
And she is isn't coming back.

I knew you better than I thought I did.
Not your name, but your game.
I knew your race, I knew your face.
You're not just another statistic.
Not another accident...
Not another political incorrectness.
Suicide blonde, I knew you better than I thought.
I saw you every day, on the corner of fifth and main.
Smoking your cigarettes, drunk by sex.
I never talked to you, I never said a word.
I passed you by, and you looked away.
I knew you even then, but I didn't say a word.
I thought you were filth, but I was wrong.
Maybe you did wear too much lipstick,
And maybe you did smoke more than enough.
but now you're gone for good.
I miss you, even those leather boots with spiked heels,
And blue eyes with black lashes.
I wish you were alive, even if you were never quite sober;
Even if you always looked like you had just been crying.
Even with your bleached blonde hair.
Suicide blonde, you made a choice.
The wrong one, and now I have to live with it.
Because now, you see, I'm just like you.
Now I know you.
Not your name, but your game.
I'm trapped, like you were, with only one way out.
Now I'm a suicide blonde, too.

	Through early morning fog I see
	Visions of the things to be

	I realize and I can see that

	Suicide is painless
	It brings on many changes
	And I can take or leave it if I please.

	All our little joys relate
	Without that ever-present hate
	But now I know that it's too late, and
	
	Suicide is painless
	It brings on many changes
	And I can take or leave it if I please.

	The game of life is hard to play
	I'm going to lose it anyway
	The losing card I'll someday lay
	And this is all I have to say, that

	Suicide is painless
	It brings on many changes
	And I can take or leave it if I please.
  
	The only way to win is cheat
	And lay it down before I'm beat
	And to another give a seat
	For that's the only painless feat, 'cause

	Suicide is painless
	It brings on many changes
	And I can take or leave it if I please.

	The sword of time will pierce our skins
	It doesn't hurt when it begins
	But as it works its way on in
	The pain grows stronger - watch it grin

	Suicide is painless
	It brings on many changes
	And I can take or leave it if I please.
	
	A brave man once requested me
	To answer questions that are key
	Is it to be or not to be?
	And I replied, "Oh why ask me?", 'cause

	Suicide is painless
	It brings on many changes
	And I can take or leave it if I please.

Once his chapels gleamed with light
Once his churches crawled with life
Once He gave the starving bread
Once his hands could raise the dead
Once He spoke of what was right
Once He gave the darkness light
Once He drowned the fires of Hell
Once He stumbled ...and then He fell

Heaven is a ghosttown
And all the Gods are dead
Valhalla had diminished
When the last of our heroes fled

The Devil is out doing
All the things he knows he should
Civilization's dying
Things are looking pretty good

Now the world's decaying
And you know he won't come back
Yet I see that you're still praying
In his ornamental shack

Read his crumbling parchments
And do his dying will
But his deafened ears can't hear you pray,
His ice-cold hands can't feel

His books will do you no good now
The Light is all but gone
And I'd really like to help you
But I'll kill you later on

The Hope you think you're feeling
Is nothing but a dream
You'll find your situation's not
As bright as it may seem

To Be or Not to Be
ş Twilight
ùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùúùú

I have endured the stages -
From the frequent soliloquy of anguish
to the sparse acts of joyous jubilee.
The mental torment...  (the cerebral onslaught)
Finally...slain before the break.
An awkward bow as the crowd applauses...
The curtain falls - uncertain.

The critics jeer and poke and scrutinize
Insecurity thickly rolls ashore
A huddled mass, naked and unarmed
Struggling, shielding, hiding...
from the stabs and shocks of pain.
I silently weep to unlistening ears
I cry, alone...to myself.

Rebirth!  I have been reborn!
Never have I felt a warmer sun
As his glowing arms embrace me...
But only in my box of inclusion
do I exist in insulation -
For ahead of me he does not shine
The forward path remains...unlit.

Stumbling over rocks in the way,
Abrasions don't seem to heal well 
I lie motionless as life escapes me -
A helpless hemophiliac...in constant misery.
'Sadness was always there, my friend -
 One cannot fool himself
 Nothing here is everlasting -
 not love, not life, nor healing skin'...

The only light that aids me now -
is but a ray peeking through closed doors
into an estranged, dark cellar.
And as I sit wallowing in my mildew,
Oh, is it damp...and dank...
This phoenix has engulfed itself
in the same fiery womb of its birth
An inaudible shriek - a silent scream
as the flames die down, 
and twilight soothingly coats the sky...

An empty soul...wandering aimlessly -
Unguided, perhaps misled.
Left to find my own way among the seashells
Sucking in my breath, holding in my cries
as I step on broken glass -
ungratefully left in careless apathy
I thought I'd never care -
I couldn't have been more wrong.

'We never quite appreciate
 how much the other cares or tries'...
And as I sit and ponder, sidetracked
Alongside this lightless path
No longer in my own Thermos do I serve
as the shivers sneak into my rigid spine
So, now, I wonder what I'd welcome more
in this chaos of emotion and perception -
The heavenly chime of bells...
Or the solemn wail of the melancholy trumpet.

ùúùúùúùúùúùú

Ripped raw from the womb
I watched you being carried off
Cold, blue and unfeeling
Drained your life away
              Two for the price of one.

Separated by hearts
Left bleeding and hurt
By your own choice
Never to return
              Wouldn't let me say goodbye.

My screams were not heard
No flinch, no head turned my way
But you continued on in your red haze
Thinking only of your mission
              And not and nothing of me.

Blinded in oblivion
Shoving all and everything out
Stubborn, uncaring, and unyielding
With this newly-found strength (...of cowardice)
              Even punching me.

Escaping,... fleeing
Forgetting to take me along
You thought all the pain would end
But I'm the one who lives.
              You have killed me.

In a bit, I will be comsumed with hatred.
As for now, I am in love.
Funny it may seem to you.
But that's what you've done.

Cool to warm to hot to cold.
That's how quick the emotions fly.
The reactions you provoke,
But you never see.

Because I have a happy mask.
I can hide behind it.
You'll never know.
No one ever knows.

It hides the hurt, the pain, and the love.
Picturesque in its simplicity,
It is almost too fake to believe.
Yet, real enough to deceive.

Nonchalance it what it shows.
Happiness is all you see.
The friend, the fiend, it will always be.
For they are one in the same.

You may only see the caring side.
But the other is there.
Awaiting its unveiling.
To lash out with all the pain.

But, do not dwell on the hurt.
A friend is what you are looking for.
A friend is what you will get.
On goes the mask once again.

I wish you would run away with me
We would be forever free
Two hearts as one
Together following the sun
I could show the things
That are in your dreams
And you would never be alone
Just you and me
Following the sun
Never stopping
Never finding our way back
Just following the sun
A neverending dream
Like off a movie screen
We would have our piece of mind
And our dreams to find
Together following the sun
No time frame
Living by the moment
Together as one
One creation
And one flame
Together following the sun




"To be human is to dream.  Pipe dreams, daydreams of perfect love or a 
 brilliant career - we all pay rent on castles in the air.  But sometimes 
 there's a dream that doesn't fade, an impossible dream that just might come
 true with the right breaks and a lot of hard work.  Those are the dreams we'd
 be fools to give up on."  Ä Jo Coudert

When soft summer wind touched your cheek,
Please think of me.
When the water and the sand on the beach
Come up between your toes and you feel as
One with them,
Please think of me.
When on a moonlight night, the shadows fall
Over you like my lovings arms long too,
Please think of me.
When you feel the warmth inside you
That you always brought me,
Please think of me.
When you reach out and touch the stars,
and remember that you were my every dream,
Please think of me.
Even when you hear the callous words
Of a heartless time, know that I still
Loved you and...
Please think of me.
And if the final sleep were to ever
Take me from you,
Please DON'T think of me.

For I love you too much,
To ever want you to die with me.

But for a thousand eternites,
I'll always remember you.

Cement and rubble, smoke, barbed wire, pools of blood growing under limp, 
dead, wounded human soldier bodies.  Smell of burned flesh, of smoke, of 
death, of drying blood, of...  pollen.

A field of green grass, blue sky, a breeze that could hold a kite in the air. 
A kid, a child, gently guiding that kite in the air.  He's 7.  He has 
beautiful blond hair that the wind pushes into his eyes.  It's fall. Pollen 
count is up.

Mom and dad sneeze, wear coats. They notice how late it's getting, and call to 
the young child, who resists.  'If you don't come now, we'll leave without 
you,' they threaten.  'Very well.  Go ahead.' is the reply.

A seven year-old girl is running across the war-torn street.  She has long, 
beautiful black hair and is wearing a flowered dress, which the smoky wind 
flaps and wrinkles.  She skips, she sings a little song to herself, soldiers' 
wounds heal as she passes by, skipping, singing a little song to herself.

Through gunfire, an eight year-old boy in a blue sweater walks toward a man 
with a rifle, walking slowly, deliberately, knowing he can't be seen.  No 
bullet touches him.  He does not choke on tear gas.  He lightly touches the 
man's rifle, and it runs out of ammunition.

A field of green grass, red sunset sky, a breeze that could hold a kite in the 
air.  A breeze which grows stronger as night falls.  The kite is pulled ever 
higher by the mounting wind.  The boy with beautiful blond hair runs out of 
twine so he pretends, and that is enough.  Higher goes the kite.

A red-headed boy, eight years old, hops up onto a pile of sandbags, merrily, 
easily.  He looks down at a scared and inexperienced young soldier who is 
frozen in fear.  He hops down into the foxhole, gently pulls the rifle barrel 
out of the soldier's mouth, and skips away happily, into the fog.

A six year-old girl. The most beautiful the boy has ever pretended, with long 
flowing hair and frosted features.  A white gown which floats, which glides, 
which shimmers.  She floats through the sky, above the smoke and flak.  
Movement above the battlefield, a shimmering movement.  The moon is rising. 
Fighting can stop for the night.

A field of green grass, indigo nighttime, no wind.  A kite, high in the sky. 
A boy, pretending.

up at a window                and quiet thunder
watch the rain                beating on my head
try to let it                 never to see the sun
wash away my pain            
                              welcome to my hell

memories                     
of a better day              
									  
it rained on the day         
when you took it all away    
the rain stopped in the sky

		 I walk along this path
		 Into this clearing
		 These woods...
		 Of you and I

		 This place we shared
		 Alone...
		 This place of peace and solace
		 This place
		 Of you and I

		 This place we danced
		 Under the moonlight
		 That bathed us in its radiance
		 Where the sun chased us to shelter
		 And the night was ours, my darling...
		 The nights were ours
		 You and I

		 I remember this place
		 I look upon it now
		 In fond memory
		 Of you and I

		 This place...
                 This beautiful place
		 That is all I have left
		 Of you and I

		 This place where need and want and desire
		 were filled
		 And trivial problems were washed away
		 By the beautiful night
		 That belonged to only
		 You and I

		 Where we danced
		 And sang
		 And wept
		 To the glorious intertwining
		 Of you and I

		 Now you have left me
		 For something better perhaps
		 And I need to see you
		 I need to touch you
		 I need to be with you
		 One more time
		 ...But all I have left is this
		 This place
		 This wonderful, beautiful night sky
		 Where I can let go once again
		 And be free once more
		 With you
		 Forever
		 In this place we shared
		 ...Of you and I.

	 "I have been to hell
	 And it is cold
	 Very cold..."
	 Maybe....<shrug>
	 But we create out own hell.......
 
              And I wallow in mine
	 Mine is dark, and dank
	 And in it my heart is made of glass,
              of ice,
              of steel
	 And I sit alone waiting
	 Waiting for you to come 
	 To wisk me from my stage
              My hell
	 To melt my heart of glass,
              of ice
              of steel.
	 To take me again
	 To stand before me like an angel
	 Just like an angel you were
	 Standing taunt, outstretching your arms to me
	 Engulfing me, willingly, in your arms...
	 And you led me up....
              up so high...
	 On your golden wings
	 That would fail and send us falling to the ground if I did not have 
	 total faith in you
	 But I did....I always did...
	 And I still do
	 You brought me high beyond my dreams 
	 Far past the beautiful clouds 
              Past the darkness and the cold unfeeling world that I had made 
              for myself
	 Beyond my hell we rose
	 Far behind we left it

	 But as we ascended upward,
              I glanced down, feeling the pain as I stared down at that
              gruesome thing
              that I had become

	 And in my pain, you faltered
              and we fell...
	 Oh so fast we fell
              Until you whispered in my ear and my soul was uplifted again
              and we rose once again...
	 With great speed we flew into that embracing light...
	 "I saw eternity last night
	 A great ring of pure and endless light"
	 Yes, that light englufed me in its arms
	 Making nothing matter but the light....your light
              So that in my moment of pure joy I could not tell the difference 
              between 
	 your arms and the light
	 I did not want to...
	 Did not need to
	 All I wanted was for you to hold me in that light....With that light...
	 And I was happier then ever before...
	 
	 So now I sit waiting 
	 In this room with no walls that locks me in it's cold, dark embrace
	 Longing for that light....
               your light...  
	 That you shared with me
	 That I will never forget
 
	 Please...hold me in that light forever........

The history of our vital and endangered earth is characterized by the music of
the times.  Likewise, music is the cornerstone of all future life.  Music is 
not a product of the age in which we live, but the opposite; the age is a
product of its music - and it has been so throughout all time.  Music is to 
the soul what breath is to the body.  It is the fundamental ingredient of
dreams, of inspirations, yes - of live evolving.  Music has little to do with 
logic; people don't listen to music just because they are logical.  Music has
everything to do with live and living.  Music is universally inspiring - a 
common language that transcends all boundaries of culture or country, of race
or religion, of sex or station.  So, it stands to reason that music will be 
the primary force to guide us into a new consciousness - a new age.  If the
coming years are to bring a safer world - a more prosperous lifestyle - a
restoration of all that we have destroyed - it will be orchestrated by a new
music.  Therefore, since music forms the times in which we live...and music is 
power...perhaps we should start channeling that power responsibly and 
positively - to heal rather than harm - to bring a little joy and light into
the world one song to one person at a time...

...when I see the girl I "liked"...  A girl who
"liked" me in turn...  after a long time of not seeing her...
It hits me...  Maybe because I haven't seen her in such a long time
And it's been a long time since I
have talked to her...  Just how truly beautiful she looks up there...
And all the memories start coming back...
           Memories of her and of another...  Memories of one intensified by
           memories of the other...
           and the damnable place.
But I see her with another guy...
I mean, it should have happened by now...
I curse myself for being such a coward when I had the chance...
The chance to say I cared...
The chance to say we had a lot in common...
The chance to say... simply... "I love you"
And I find my eyes watering rapidly
And have to walk away
To avoid being seen by one of my friends, whose presence she acknowledged;
His presence.  His, with a smile and an ejaculation of, "Crusty!"
But not mine...
Perhaps that splitsecondglance
Was intended for me, to give my existence meaning
Because I've committed some crime...
It may be that she felt the same way I did
and, "Look at me now, look at where I am, it's all because of _you_."
And the memories come back in a flood of falling tears
           good memories.  Memories of us together.  Of us talking.  Of a
           person approaching her, of her response:
           "GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME."
           Of her smile
           O, but even then she was beautiful.
           <and you loved her>
           <you did, you fool>
tears which I must dry, quickly, lest my friend see them...
But I hide not from my friend my melancholy mood...
Hoping he'll see what exactly is going on...
And the day is made more miserable...  As the memories start again and try
to take control of me as I try to stop the tears from slowly escaping.
And when I am asked if I enjoyed myself
That day, I must lie
(and tell the truth at the same time, for I was content in my misery)
And say "yes" and that I'd like to go again...
Although the place itself is dedicated to
how was it
letting go of your cares?
I will go again.
I must bask in the horror of good memories turned bad...
And entertain ideas that it will someday be made right.  Perhaps I will
receive a phone call...  Yes, that would be nice
A phone call from her...
(I know what I would say!  "Who is he?
i love you") 
and more
But I know that can't be, for what reason does she have to be calling me
so I listen to depressing songs
Thinking of playing them to an audience, saying why these songs are so
important
to me
And explaining why, in the middle of performing this song, I broke down
And the tears began again
As the memories returned.
I think of going back there - maybe she will return...  but why would she
Why should she
She has been there already.
So I will go there
Again.
I will return
In the glory of horrors, of a pitiful person's pitiful actions
As I muse
love lost, love never had, love never met
And how wonderful it could have truly been...
How wonderful it should have truly been...
How wonderful...
How wonderful...it may still be.
But with whom?
With her.  With her...
There are brighter, more brightly shining stars in the sky
I saw them
I thought nothing of them... of she...
And discarded her before she was mine...
Before I was hers

decrepid house, decaying if not defiant
falling fence, gardens growing over
clapboards clapping as the wind whips
the witching hour approaches
new moon out,
and only stars to light the sky
a million points of bright pierce the dark of night
like a voyeur you creep closer
and closer still over the window sill
and enter brilliance
the light of a thousand candles
pin pricks of luminescence illuminate the room
flames flare white, orange, fade to red
as fire wavers in the breeze
a bed in the corner
soft and warm, inviting
sinking your head into the pillow
sinking into sleep
sleeping off your day
dreaming of a woman
she comes in the night
you wake, but just barely
appearing angelic
flowing capes of white gauze transparent
and you see her perfect body beneath
soft and warm, inviting
her lips like red red wine
her smile generous
tangible, tantalizing
your body tingles as you reach out
for shelter in her arms
those burgundy lips part
as she gasps when you touch
electric pleasure of pleasures
she grazes your cheek with a touch of those lips
a nibble on your ear, and the sinks lower still
another kiss on your neck, a vampire kiss
and she feeds as you bleed
sucking your blood as you fall in love
like in a dream unreal
early morning you awake
groggy, alone
light from the sun seeps in
over the window sill and closer still
glorious golden light, you reach out to touch
and pain fills you with remembrances
of the love you shared, and the vampire kiss
you scream and bolt through the door, floorboards creak as you
run through the house, into room after room, and there it is...
the velvet lined black box, soft and warm, inviting
